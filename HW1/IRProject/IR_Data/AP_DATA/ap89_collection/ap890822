<HEAD>Israeli Minister Meets Cardinal On Convent Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's religious affairs minister,
Zevulun Hammer, met with Cardinal Franciszek Macharski on Tuesday in
an effort to resolve the dispute over a Roman Catholic convent at
the former death camp at Auschwitz.
   Hammer was the first high-ranking Israeli official to visit
Poland since diplomatic relations were severed more than 20 years
ago.
   Any conclusions reached by Hammer and the Krakow cardinal during
their 1{- hour meeting of Krakow were not released.
   Members of Hammer's family died at Auschwitz and he visited the
site before meeting the cardinal, said a spokesman for the Israeli
interest section in Warsaw.
   Macharski announced this month that the convent would not be
moved from the camp's perimeter as promised in an international
accord signed by Jewish and Catholic leaders in Geneva.
   Catholic leaders initially agreed to transfer the Carmelite nuns
by Feb. 22 to an interfaith prayer center to be built farther from
the camp. But Macharski said the agreement would not be honored in
an ``atmosphere of aggressive demands.''
   Protests by Jewish groups increased after the deadline passed. In
one highly publicized incident on July 14, an American rabbi and six
students demonstrating at the convent were roughly evicted by
workmen at the site.
   Jewish groups and others have viewed the convent as an offensive
intrusion of Christian symbols at the camp, where an estimated 2.5
million Jews died.
   Poland, with the rest of the Soviet bloc except Romania, cut
diplomatic ties with Israel in 1967 after the Arab-Israeli war. But
contact has been steadily increasing. Israel now has an independent
interest section in Warsaw.
   Hammer will also meet Polish political leaders during his
five-day visit that began Sunday.

   Texas Rangers pitcher Nolan Ryan struck
out his 5,000th batter Tuesday night, becoming the first to reach
that milestone when he fanned Oakland's Rickey Henderson in the
fifth inning.
   But the Oakland Athletics took away some of the thrill by beating
the Rangers 2-0.
   Ryan went into the game needing six strikeouts. He struck out the
Oakland Athletics' Jose Canseco in the first inning, Dave Henderson
and Tony Phillips in the second, Rickey Henderson and Ron Hassey in
the third. He finally got Rickey Henderson swinging on a 3-2
fastball leading off the fifth.
   Ryan tipped his hat to a thundering standing ovation while rookie
catcher Chad Kreuter ran the historic ball out to the mound. Ryan's
teammates on the field surged to congratulate him and the scoreboard
flashed ``5,000'' as hundreds of flash bulbs popped in the stands.
   He finished the game with 13 strikeouts, walking two and allowing
only five hits. That gave Ryan 5,007 strikeouts.
   A sellout crowd of 43,000, including Commissioner Bart Giamatti
and Rangers owner George Bush, son of the president, gave Ryan three
standing ovations before the game even started. The fans cheered
loudly every time he got two strikes on a batter, and Ryan rarely
disappointed them.
   Ryan struck out the first batter of his career, Atlanta pitcher
Pat Jarvis, as a 19-year-old with the New York Mets on Sept. 11,
1966. He reached 1,000 on July 3, 1973, with California, got to
2,000 on Aug. 31, 1976, hit 3,000 on July 4, 1980, with Houston and
got to 4,000 on July 11, 1985.

<TEXT>
   Chalk it up to campaign stress: ghosts are
talking to Mayor Edward I. Koch, and he's talking back.
   Robert Moses, New York's planning czar who died in 1981, recently
stopped by to chat with Koch, the mayor said Monday.
   Koch, in the middle of a tough primary contest for his fourth
term, said Moses relayed two requests.
   ``First, he wants me to be mayor,'' Koch said. The second request
was that Koch bring the World's Fair to New York sometime in the
mid-1990s, he said.
   Koch was speaking to a black tie crowd attending a 50th
anniversary celebration of the 1939 New York World's Fair.
   Koch reported that he told Moses, ``If I didn't see him in person
between now and then, I'll do it.''

   The John Candy vehicle ``Uncle Buck'' took first
place in the weekend box office revue, beating the highly touted
``Parenthood,'' ``The Abyss'' and ``Casualties of War.''
   Director John Hughes' comedy grossed $8.8 million, according to
figures released Monday by Exhibitor Relations Inc. The movie stars
Candy as a peculiar relative struggling to babysit his nephew and
two nieces.
   Meanwhile, attendance at ``A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream
Child'' dropped by nearly 50 percent and the film finished eighth in
its second week of release, indicating Freddy Krueger's final demise
may arrive sooner rather than later.
   Ron Howard's ``Parenthood'' finished second after two weeks in
first place. A bittersweet commentary on the American family,
``Parenthood'' stars Steve Martin and Jason Robards and had ticket
sales of $7.6 million.
   The underwater spectacular ``The Abyss'' continued to generate
steady business in third with a box-office take of $7.2 million. The
movie features Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio trapped on
the ocean floor in a special-effects laden epic.
   ``Casualties of War,'' the new Vietnam movie starring Michael J.
Fox and Sean Penn, opened with an unimpressive $5.2 million in wide
release to claim fourth place. Directed by Brian De Palma,
``Casualties of War'' tells the story of the rape and murder of a
Vietnamese girl by a group of U.S. soldiers.
   ``When Harry Met Sally...,'' the romantic comedy pitting Billy
Crystal and Meg Ryan as best friends who become lovers, finished in
fifth by collecting $4.9 million. It was followed in sixth by
``Lethal Weapon 2,'' the action-adventure sequel with Mel Gibson and
Danny Glover, which grossed $4.5 million.
   In seventh was the police comedy ``Turner and Hooch,'' featuring
Tom Hanks, on receipts of $4.3 million. In eighth was ``A Nightmare
on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child.'' The film's take, $8.1 million in
its opening week, fell to $4.1 million.
   Rounding out the Top 10 were ``Batman'' in ninth with $3.4
million and the new family film ``Cheetah'' in 10th with $2.6
million. ``Let it Ride'' opened weakly in 12th place with sales of
$1.9 million.
   Both ``Young Einstein'' with Australian import Yahoo Serious and
``Lock Up'' with Sylvester Stallone dropped out of the Top 10.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.
   1. ``Uncle Buck,'' Universal, $8.8 million, 1,804 screens, $4,875
per screen, $11.9 million, one week.
   2. ``Parenthood,'' Universal, $7.6 million, 1,316 screens, $5,780
per screen, $43.3 million, three weeks.
   3. ``The Abyss,'' 20th Century Fox, $7.2 million, 1,538 screens,
$4,690 per screen, $24.7 million, two weeks.
   4. ``Casualties of War,'' Columbia, $5.2 million, 1,487 screens,

<TEXT>
   A quarter-century ago, Betty Friedan called the
oppression of American women ``the problem that has no name.'' But
Japan today has a name for Meiri Marimo's problem: She's ``leftover
Christmas cake.''
   Miss Marimo, in other words, has grown a bit stale as a
marriageable commodity _ at least that's what her mother complains.
In Japan, where many marriages are still arranged, a woman is
considered to have a shelf life of about 25 years.
   When Miss Marimo was 28, she left for New York _ alone.
   Sumiko Morikawa sits next to the ``No Smoking'' sign in her
Waldorf-Astoria office and lights a cigarette. At 39, she says she's
looking for a new man. She isn't particular about his background _
as long as he isn't Japanese.
   ``Japanese men and women, they cannot understand how to love,''
says Miss Morikawa, the owner of a translating service. Three years
ago, she ended a 16-year marriage undertaken to please her
tradition-minded brother in Japan. No passion, she says.
   ``Japanese businessmen are very nice, but they are so totally
quality-controlled. They see themselves as company men. And their
wives also, they say, `I'm a Mitsubishi wife.' It kills the
individuality of people.''
   It is 11:30 a.m. Renko Isowa, 42, pauses over a dish of vanilla
ice cream as she cheerily recalls the strict training of her youth
in the traditional female skills.
   ``I learned flower arrangement, tea ceremony and cooking for two
years. I was totally dead,'' says Miss Isowa, vice president of a
television production company here.
   ``I wanted to start working. I wanted to be a member of real
society.''
   Twenty-six years after ``The Feminine Mystique,'' Friedan's
manifesto of women's rights, helped kindle feminism in the West,
only a trickle of women in Japan are able or willing to live out its
creed. But many of those few come to the United States to try.
   The three expatriates above may seem refreshingly liberated, but
in Japan many would consider them wild-eyed radicals. They insist on
standing out in a society where wa, or group harmony, dictates ``the
nail that stands out is hammered down.''
   ``Japanese women haven't been raised to have aspirations,'' says
Jane Condon, author of ``A Half-Step Behind: Japanese Women of the
'80s.'' ``They're still facing boundaries we broke through 20 years
ago.''
   ``To be good American, you have to be an individual. To be a good
Japanese, you'd better damn sight not be,'' says Steven Fochios, a
New York City psychiatrist who counsels many Japanese women.
   ``The women who ... come to the U.S., then get into the machinery
of the country, are able to enjoy the kinds of freedoms they had
never dreamed of,'' he says. ``And these women are tough. They are
tough.''
   Miss Marimo's family frets, to no avail. To her friends, she is
an ``incredible oyahuko,'' a bad daughter. A few years ago, she
moved into her own apartment in Tokyo, watching defiantly as the
social pressures that mold a Japanese woman's life _ a cycle of
temporary employment, marriage and child-raising _ claimed her
schoolmates one by one.
   Her old friends ``spoke to me as if they were accusing me,
criticizing me very severely,'' recalls the lithe, long-haired Miss
Marimo, a free-lance writer.
   ``I didn't care at all. I don't want to be involved in
housekeeping. I smiled a Japanese smile'' _ and left.
   In the United States, disaffected minorities organize, as
American women did in the 1970s. In Japan, it has always been easier
to jump ship than to rock the boat. Until recently.
   Today, the glacial rigidity of Japanese society _ ``otoko no
shakai,'' the man's world _ shows signs of thawing after more than a
century of uneasy integration with the West. Japan's giant
corporations, facing chronic worker shortages as the economy surges,
are beginning to open management jobs to women. Traditionally they
are hired as tea-pouring ``office ladies'' while pursuing their real
vocation: marriage.
   Japanese women are even making an impact on politics. A record 22
women won seats in the July 23 elections for Parliament's upper
house. Female voters had been angered by allegations that Japan's
just-departed prime minister, Sousuke Uno, kept paid mistresses.
   The election also showed, however, that much has not changed.
Many of the victorious female parliamentary candidates had portrayed
themselves not as feminists but as simple housewives immune from
corruption.
   Indeed, apart from the odd individualist who ventures abroad to
live, few Japanese women want change.
   ``If you go to a party here and introduce yourself as a
housewife, people will think you're strange. But in Japan it's OK.
Being a housewife doesn't bother Japanese women, because they have a
social position,'' says Kako Nakagawa, the executive editor of New
York Yomiuri, a newspaper published for Japanese in North America.
   ``I think in the United States you have no secure place for
women,'' she says. ``Here there are opportunities for women, so if
you don't try anthing hard, then you feel guilty. ... But in Japan
there are no opportunities so there's no such struggle. It's easy.''
   ``When I go to Japan, the Japanese women I see are very
content-looking, very happy,'' says Naoko Adams, a researcher for
Sunstar Corp., a Japanese company with offices in New York. When I
come back to America, I notice the women look very unhappy,
frustrated.''
   While women in Japan are largely blocked from positions of power,
they provide a vital temporary worker base that absorbs economic
downturns, allowing large Japanese companies to maintain their
much-vaunted ``lifetime employment system'' for permanent workers.
In addition, they are the linchpin of an economic system that allows
men to spend long hours working and, as is expected, socializing
afterward.
   With the men otherwise occupied, women often control family purse
strings, and so completely control their children's destinies that
surveys have shown the central relationship in a Japanese man's life
is not between him and his wife but between him and his mother.
   So strong is such patterning of Japanese women, in fact, that
leaving it behind sometimes causes deep emotional problems for
expatriates, who must spurn what they have been taught since
childhood and embrace alien values.
   ``Some of them say they feel guilty about being free as an
American,'' says Fochios, the psychiatrist. ``They feel inferior to
a Japanese woman because they don't have the capacity to be a good
Japanese wife.''
   Some expatriate women, however, simply decide to ignore American
values.
   ``Japanese women are better off. I don't think I would like to
marry an American man,'' says Kiyomi Koizumi, a 65-year-old
neurophysiologist who came to the United States in 1949 and married
a Japanese.
   ``I always say my husband is like air _ you would miss it if it's
not there, I can't live without it, but you don't feel it. An
American man might be around me too much.''

<HEAD>Civilian Politicians Seek To Get Along with Chile's Military</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The political opposition is pursuing an
unprecedented dialogue with the armed forces, seeking a formula for
peaceful co-existence when Chile returns to civilian government in
March.
   The military, which has ruled since 1973, has indicated a
willingness to negotiate, but only under certain conditions.
   Both sides agree that the lack of communication in the past had
led to a mutual animosity and distrust that both sides agree must be
eliminated if the future government is to enjoy stability.
   Patricio Aylwin, the presidential candidate of a united
center-left opposition and heavily favored to win the presidential
election Dec. 14, recently remarked: ``We want an approach, an
exchange of views.''
   ``The isolation that has existed for years among civilians and
military is not good for the country and must end,'' Aylwin added.
``The time has come for a dialogue.''
   Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the right-wing army commander who has been
president since seizing power in September, 1973, was obliged to
call December's general elections after losing a referendum in
October on extending his rule to 1997.
   Aylwin and other opposition leaders want the dialogue to take
place before the new government takes office March 11.
   Experts expect several highly conflictive items will be on the
agenda.
   Ignacio Walker, a leading adviser to Aylwin on military matters,
said the talks would include the role of the armed forces under the
civilian government, the continuation of the present
commanders-in-chief in their posts, the defense budget and, probably
the most sensitive problem, how the new government will deal with
the human rights violations during Pinochet's rule.
   After the 1973 coup, which toppled the elected government of
Marxist Salvadoe Allende, the military launched a campaign of
political repression. Thousands of leftists were arrested, many were
tortured, killed or sent into exile. Human rights groups have
documented more than 700 cases of dissidents who disappeared after
being arrested by seurity agents.
   The opposition has said that it will investigate all pending
cases of rights abuse and try those responsible.
   Its leaders have also said they will seek to repeal an amnesty
law, issued by Pinochet, that pardoned violations occurred from 1973
to 1978.
   That announcement by the opposition prompted a stern warning from
the military ranks. Gen. Fernando Matthei, the air force commander
who is considered politically moderate and has expressed support for
a dialogue, said repealing the amnesty law could unleash ``an
unpredictible reaction'' by the armed forces.
   ``Those wanting to repeal the law do not realize how serious that
could be,'' Matthei added.
   He noted that Pinochet himself has warned that an attempt to try
military officials could lead to an interruption of the democratic
transition.
   Opposition leaders have insisted they seek ``truth and justice,''
not vengeance against the military. They are under heavy political
pressure from human rights groups representing victims of repression
or their relatives.
   Another highly controversial subject is the constitutional clause
that allows the military chiefs, including Pinochet, to retain their
military commands under the civilian government. Pinochet has said
he will remain the army's leader for as long as the constitution
allows _ until 1998.
   Even some pro-government politicians contend the new leadership
must be empowered to make changes in the military command. But the
armed forces have vowed to make no concessions on the point. A
statement issued by the army warned the armed forces are prepared to
``use legitimate force'' to uphold constitution, which was drafted
by the military and approved in a referendum.
   And military commanders insist that their mission includes
ensuring internal stability as well as defending the country against
foreign attack. That is considered another potential area of
controversy, but opposition leaders say they are prepared to talk
about it, too, in spite of the risks and difficulties.
   ``The peaceful end of military dictatorships has never been easy,
and Chile cannot be an exception,'' wrote Rene Abeliuk, a Social
Democratic leader, in a newspaper column.
   The Roman Catholic Church also has urged civilians and military
to talk about their differences ``to help the transition to
democracy.''

   An old guidebook says: ``One thing a foreigner in
Beirut need never worry about is making friends.'' That was long
ago, before a civil war devastated the city and nation, before the
hostage-taking. Here is a report on what it was like, by an AP
correspondent who lived in Beirut in those days.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By NICK LUDINGTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   I remember when Beirut was the playground
of the Middle East, a vibrant crossroad between the Orient and the
West. The bright Mediterranean sun glinted from its high-rise
buildings and its vaults were full of oil money.
   Beirut was a stimulating intellectual center then, and a vital
contact point for businessmen.
   Now, it is a shambles strewn with garbage, a city brought low by
14 years of vicious civil war.
   Those of us who lived there remember Beirut before the war as a
place where 100,000 foreigners mingled with Middle Eastern princes,
high-rollers, emigres, adventurers and 17 Christian and Moslem sects.
   A veneer of Western culture was superimposed on the fragile
sectarian structure created by the French when they granted Lebanon
independence in 1943. A dormant volcano of hatreds seethed beneath
the exuberance and sophistication.
   Luxury hotels, apartments and office blocks gleamed between the
blue Mediterranean and pine-covered mountains.
   Non-Lebanese Arabs, constrained at home by puritanical Moslem
rules or dictators, could kick up their heels with liquor, women or
$300 roulette chips and voice their political opinions freely in the
Arab world's only working democracy.
   Westerners came to tap the oil money that poured into Beirut,
buying into several dozen Lebanese banks or opening their own
offices.
   Citibank of New York decorated a full floor of its office annex
at the Holiday Inn with imported carpets and furniture.
   A few months later, we watched from the Associated Press office
nearby as it was looted and destroyed by rival militias battling for
strategic high-rise buildings along what became the line dividing
Christian and Moslem sectors of the city.
   Westerners found Beirut intriguing for its combination of modern
amenities with the oriental flavor of the old gold market, its
cosmopolitan society, the Middle Eastern food at such restaurants
such as Ajami's.
   I still have a dusty, English-language guidebook, the last
published before the war. ``Everywhere you will feel the warm
eastern hospitality,'' it says. ``One thing a foreigner in Beirut
need never worry about is making friends.''
   Fourteen years later, scores of foreigners have been kidnapped,
most of them by virulently anti-Western Moslem groups. Sixteen still
are held, including Terry Anderson, an AP colleague.
   More than 150,000 Lebanese, most of them civilians, have been
killed in the war and 1 million have been displaced.
   Burned-out hulks of the St. Georges, Palm Beach, Phoenicia and
Holiday Inn hotels cluster in what once was Beirut's tourist center
and now is a wasteland inhabited only by snipers.
   I recall sitting in the St. Georges restaurant in the good old
days, watching water skiers skim behind needle-nosed Italian
speedboats.
   There also was the less-costly, though fastidious, Myrtoum House
restaurant and pension run by Hans Matschek, an Austrian expatriate.
Regulars said it was the only place in Lebanon's sunny climate to
risk eating steak tartare.
   An attraction at night was the great Casino de Liban, north of
the city in what is now Christian territory, where one could gamble
or watch two imported floor shows.
   Those with the right connections might attend functions dominated
by the doyenne of high society, Isabelle Soursock. She was from an
old-money Lebanese Christian family and became Lady Isabelle when
she married Sir Desmond Hamilton.
   A vivid memory is of a visit to the home of Henri Pharaon, a
bachelor shipping millionaire who lived among priceless Islamic art
treasures and pictures of horses he raced against those of Saudi
princes.
   The racetrack on the city's dividing line is a ruin now, a
nightmare scene of bullet-splintered trees and shell holes.
   An unusual establishment, even for Beirut, was the Surprise. It
was the size of a packing crate and had a bartender, four stools,
one hefty prostitute and a remarkable number of customers bidding
for her favors.
   The American University of Beirut and large numbers of Arab
intellectuals who fled persecution in their own countries gave the
city a more serious side.
   ``The Arab emigres contributed to the city more than the Lebanese
socialites,'' said Charles Snow, an oil economist who spent many
years in Beirut and moved to Cyprus in 1976.
   The American University and medical school once had 5,000
students and produced a great share of the professional, academic
and political leaders in the Arab world.
   Among the graduates was Dr. George Habash, whose Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine carried out airline hijackings in
the 1970s.
   A 5-month-old artillery war between Syrian and Christian soldiers
has forced the university to close temporarily. Several of its
officials have been kidnapped.
   Adjoining the park-like university campus was the American
Community School, where children of expatriate families studied and
played Little League baseball. Some tried the pinball machines at
Anwar's, where many British and American boys, including my two
sons, learned Arabic insults from local youngsters.
   Beirutis could ski at Faraya on Mount Lebanon, play tennis or
squash and race in motor rallies.
   An American journalist who played at the Golf Club of Lebanon,
next to the now-closed airport, as late as 1983 wrote that the
safest places on the course were the sand traps.
   The luxurious Delamiyeh Country Club, with a gorgeous sea view
from a ridge south of the city, was abandoned after Palestinian
guerrillas took it over early in the war.
   Will the old Beirut ever return?
   No one knows, but I remember Khaled Saab, owner of Summerland, a
functioning hotel built during the war. A television reporter asked
why he made the investment, and Saab replied:
   ``Did you, as a child, ever kick over an anthill? Did you see how
quickly the ants rebuilt? That's Lebanon.''

   For centuries, the Thames has been a working river,
a winding highway where barges, tall ships, then steamers brought
the wealth of the world to one of its major commercial centers.
   Now it's also a popular excurison river, and Sunday's fatal
collision of the pleasure cruise boat Marchioness and a dredger many
times its size raises questions about whether there is room for both.
   Transport Minister Michael Portillo said Monday the government
``will obviously be looking very carefully'' at whether to ban
pleasure cruisers from the river.
   The opposition Labor Party called for an immediate conference
involving the Port of London Authority, the police and river users
to discuss what can be done to improve safety.
   The Port of London Authority says the Thames is like ``an
eight-lane motorway,'' traveled by 37,000 vessels annually, but
insists it is still one of the safest rivers in the world.
   ``There are very few incidents indeed on the River Thames,'' a
spokesman said. ``It's one of the safest in the world.''
   The port says 25 companies are licensed to operate 40 river
cruise boats, like the Marchioness, on the London stretch of the
Thames between Greenwich and Hampton Court Palace.
   ``They have certainly increased, the popularity has increased,''
said port spokesman Terry Hatton, although river cruise operators
disagreed.
   A ferry service was also launched last year, taking passengers
from central London's business and financial districts to the
booming Docklands residential and commercial development.
   An ocean liner dropped anchor in the Thames for the first time in
a decade last year, the first of 25 booked up to 1991.
   The river cruisers carry about 2 million passengers annually. By
day, they're full of tourists viewing London from a different angle,
sailing past the Houses of Parliament, the Tower of London, or the
Kew botanical gardens.
   By night, they become floating restaurants, cocktail lounges or
discos, chartered for private parties.
   ``In recent years the growth of tourist boats on sightseeing
trips has been accentuated by the popularity of business
entertaining by firms hiring crafts to take customers up and down
the river,'' said Conservative lawmaker Robert McCrindle.
   ``Add in the evening party types and the commercial traffic still
using the river, and the feeling that the river may be catering for
too many small ships leads me to call for reassurances about
safety.''
   David Jeffery, chief executive of the Port of London, said
Sunday's accident involving the 90-ton Marchioness and the 1,475-ton
dredger Bowbelle was ``clearly a navigational matter,'' and that the
rules governing the passage of boats on the river may have to be
reviewed.
   Jeffery said taped VHF radio messages from the Bowbelle to the
Thames Navigation Center were being examined. Commercial vessels
must report their positions and progress along the river,
particularly near bridges, but pleasure craft do not.
   ``If we required every small craft to report its every movement,
the airwaves would be so cluttered it would be difficult to get out
of that a picture of the really important pieces where things could
possibly go wrong,'' Jeffery said.
   Commercial ships have plied the Thames for 2,000 years, berthing
originally at natural indentations in the river. Vessels later
docked in the center of the river and loaded their cargoes onto
barges to be taken ashore.
   River traffic surged in the 1890s when locks were built to
control the strong tidal flow, and trade peaked in 1964 when 64
million tons were handled.
   When container shipping was introduced in the mid-1960s, cargo
ships moved to deeper ports like Tilbury at the river's mouth.
London's docks weren't big enough to handl the new, larger container
ships.
   Pilots on the river have to undergo a five- or seven-year
apprenticeship to become Freemen of the Watermen and Lightermen's
Company of the City of London, which dates from 1514. Members are
also designated Queen's Watermen, responsible for rowing Queen
Elizabeth II on the rare occasions she travels the Thames.

<HEAD>Today's Poland, Prague Anniversary Show Times Have Changed</HEAD>

   Twenty-one years after it sent tanks to crush the
``Prague Spring'' reforms in Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union is
watching quietly as Poland takes its political changes even further,
breaking the communist monopoly on power.
   The Soviet reaction to events in Poland, including the nomination
of Solidarity journalist Tadeusz Mazowiecki as prime minister,
indicated how Mikhail S. Gorbachev has shaken up the Kremlin's
relations with its Eastern European allies since Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact forces halted Czechoslovakia's reforms on Aug. 21, 1968.
   In contrast with Leonid I. Brezhnev, Gorbachev is willing to
allow his allies to find their own way as he experiments with reform
at home and grapples with nationalist movements on his own side of
the border.
   Even in Hungary and Poland, where reforms have proceeded the
furthest, they apparently have not gone beyond what is now
acceptable to the Kremlin. It is no longer certain where that limit
is.
   ``The formation of a government in Poland is an internal affair
of the Polish people,'' Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri A.
Gremitskykh told a news briefing Monday.
   ``At the same time, we are not indifferent to it. Poland is a
neighbor and an ally,'' he said. ``We hope the political forces in
the country will act constructively to find a way out of the
crisis.''
   Gremitskykh was reiterating the cautious Soviet reaction to
events in the past several months as Soldiarity has been legalized
and carried out a successful election campaign.
   In the meantime, Poland's Communist Party has not been able to
form a government and President Wojciech Jaruzelski was forced to
turn to Solidarity for a prime minister.
   Soviet officials last week expressed satisfaction at Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa's statement that even a Solidarity-led government
had responsibilities to the Warsaw Pact.
   In 1981, Jaruzelski crushed Solidarity after it grew into a
national movement, ending speculation that Brezhnev would again use
Soviet soldiers to bring a wayward ally back in line.
   Official Soviet TV and radio are reporting the events in Poland
but generally refraining from making judgments about the political
situation.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda on Monday painted a grim
picture of shortages of meat and other goods. It said Poland was on
the brink of ``hyperinflation.''
   Prospects of a coalition of Solidarity and two minor,
non-communist parties were ``becoming all the more realistic,''
Pravda said. In contrast, it said the Polish Communist Party was
``living through one of the most difficult periods of its history.''
   Gorbachev has said several times in trips to Eastern Europe that
the Soviet Union believes its allies should be free to find their
own road to developing socialism, depending on local conditions.
   Twenty-one years ago, on Aug. 21, 1968, Brezhnev and the Warsaw
Pact sent soldiers to Czechoslovakia to end a reform spearheaded not
by an organized opposition, but by Alexander Dubcek and the
Czechoslovak Communist Party.
   Gorbachev is reported to be frustrated with the conservative
leadership in Prague that has been in power since 1968 and continues
to block reform.
   But the Soviet reaction to the anniversary of the invasion
indicates a continuing sensitivity.
   The Soviet Union has never said that it made a mistake in sending
soldiers into Czechoslovakia.
   In response to a question Monday about how the Soviet Union now
views the invasion, Gremitskykh said only that it had to be
understood in the context of the times.
   Izvestia, the Soviet government newspaper, on Saturday printed
remembrances of soldiers and Soviet officials who took part in the
invasion.
   Kiril T. Mazurov, then a member of Brezhnev's Politburo, said
Soviet leaders had learned of plans ``to provoke a nuclear attack on
the Soviet Union.''
   ``The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia
had lost control of the media. In the difficult international
environment, we had just one wish _ to unite even more, to prevent a
war, to survive together,'' he said.
   ``It was hard to imagine that a bourgeois parliamentary republic,
swarming with West Germans and afterward Americans, might appear
next to our borders,'' he said.
   V.V. Nefyodov, a 19-year-old paratrooper when he was sent to
Prague in 1968, told Izvestia he could not understand why he was
sent to a country where the people didn't want him.
   ``I was ashamed,'' he said. ``Forgive us, Prague.''

<HEAD>Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Interior Dismissed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department has fired an acting
deputy assistant secretary who failed to pass a security check,
officials said Monday night.
   The official, Katherine Chang Dress, had agreed to resign in
June, efffective July 31, but changed her mind last week and decided
not to submit a resignation, said Steven Goldstein, press spokesman
for Interior Secretary Manual Lujan.
   ``She was terminated,'' Goldstein said. He said she was ``a fine
employee'' and would not elaborate on why she was fired.
   The spokesman said Dress told her staff she was dismissed because
she failed to pass her security investigation, something confirmed
by other officials who spoke on condition they not be identified.
   Dress had been acting deputy assistant secretary for territorial
and international affairs since early May. She had had no access to
classified information pending completion of her security check,
when she would have stepped up out of the ``acting'' category,
Goldstein said.
   The department's Office of Territorial and International Affairs
is in charge of the Virgin Islands and relations with the trust
territories and other U.S. dependencies in the Pacific. Just what
classified information is involved was not immediately clear, but
the Pacific areas contain U.S. military bases.
   The deputy assistant's job does not require Senate confirmation.
Dress previously served in the Peace Corps and the Commerce
Department. After her appointment was announced, she attended a Rose
Garden Ceremony where President Bush praised her as one of the
highest-ranking Asian-Americans in his administration.
   A woman who answered the telephone at the Dress home Monday night
said she was ``not available.''

<HEAD>Chinese, North Koreans Get By With a Little Help From Friends</HEAD>

   North Korea and China have pursued different
paths in recent years, but they still have a lot in common. Here is
a report by one of several Beijing-based reporters recently invited
to Pyongyang as the government there shows signs of seeking to end
its long isolation.

   How does a North Korean buy a fancy
watch, leather shoes and Japanese cigarettes in a country where such
things theoretically require foreign currency?
   ``I have a lot of friends,'' said a North Korean with all three.
   As in China, one cultivates friends not just for company, but to
skirt regulations and get access to scarce goods.
   Friendless North Koreans are worse than lonely: they are
condemned to walk in flimsy plastic or cloth shoes and wait on long
lines for the few public buses or trolleys that ply the broad
avenues of this sprawling capital city. There are no private
vehicles and no bicycles are allowed in downtown.
   ``I have friends who are (official) drivers,'' said the well-shod
North Korean. ``If I want to take my family somewhere, I ask them,
and they say, `Sure.''' That could mean a trip in a Mercedes-Benz or
at worst in a Toyota Nissan or Volvo, the only cars in North Korean
official fleets.
   There is much in North Korea to remind of life in China, its
socialist big brother across the Yalu River: slow service, careful
checks of travelers' identification and lots of uniformed soldiers
around, although most are simply walking or standing along the road.
   As in China, interviews with officials often begin with a ``brief
introduction'' that turns into an hour-long recitation of statistics
and the official line. Officials give interviews in pairs: one who
is introduced and who answers questions, and one who is never
introduced but silently supervises.
   China's separate currencies for locals and foreigners confuse and
annoy many visitors, but North Korea has three currencies.
   Ordinary pink-and-green won can buy the bare necessities: the
cabbages, eggplant and hard-looking apples and pears on display at a
Pyongyang green-grocer's one recent morning.
   Foreigners who convert Soviet rubles get red bills and have a few
more choices. But only holders of blue money, changed from U.S.
dollars, can buy Coca-Cola, Kirin beer, Japanese televisions and
British cigarettes.
   ``Friends who are diplomats and traders give (blue money) to
me,'' said the well-connected North Korean, puffing on a Japanese
Mild Seven cigarette.
   North Korea doesn't have China's hordes of youths openly trading
the various currencies for illegal profit on the sidewalks, or the
dozens of other symptoms in China of crumbling official control.
   Chinese officials trying to reinstall past ideological unity
after spring pro-democracy protests might well look to North Korea
for reminders on how it is done.
   Political slogans have faded from most walls in China in the past
decade, as senior leader Deng Xiaoping stressed economic development
over ideology. But signs every few hundred meters in rural North
Korea still exhort, ``Long live the Great Leader Kim Il Sung. Long
live the glorious Workers' Party of Korea.''
   North Korea never let its political education mechanisms rust, as
China did. Professor Kim Wonsok at the National Economic Institute
said that in workplaces, ``political work is as important as
production work.''
   Perhaps most important, citizens in North Korea have not been
allowed the sense of independence that comes from being one's own
boss. Private businessmen were key supporters of China's protests,
but private farm plots in North Korea are kept tiny and there is
virtually no other private economic activity.
   How far China has strayed from such basics of old-time socialist
rule was illustrated by the comments of two ethnic Korean women who
live just inside the Chinese border. They spoke of visits to North
Korea much as overseas Chinese used to talk of visiting China: ``You
and I can sit here and say what we like about Deng Xiaoping,'' said
one, ``but they can't do that about Kim Il Sung.''
   North Korea is helped in its task of control by a smaller
population _ 20 million people to China's 1.2 billion _ and strong
non-ideological unifying forces: a sense of outside threat, from
South Korea, and the common goal of national reunification. Ordinary
Koreans and officials spoke of these much more often than of juche,
the official philosophy of Marxism and self-reliance.
   In the 1950s and 1960s, post-war reconstruction and the fear of
U.S. or Soviet attack helped unify China, but the 1970s and 1980s
have seen increasing concern with individual goals.
   But the North Koreans have not given up all personal happiness
for the glory of the nation. Even in a brief visit it was clear they
still remember how to have a good time.
   Accordion music could be heard coming from several homes. A youth
with a guitar serenaded friends on the sidewalk one night in Kaesong
City, near the border with the south.
   And on a sunny afternoon, several dozen young men in dirty blue
work clothes went carousing at the nearby Pagyon Waterfalls.
Red-faced and a bit wobbly, they sang and danced down the road home.

<HEAD>Two Arrested on Technology Conspiracy Charges</HEAD>

   The U.S. Customs Service arrested a West German
and an Afghan here Monday for allegedly conspiring to export a
sophisticated military computer to the Soviet Union.
   The arrests of German national Egbert Partesuis, 46, and Abdul
Aziz Ahmad, 40, capped an eight-month investigation into what Thomas
McDermott, special agent in charge, said was a ``significant case.''
   ``The technology is such that it's being sought by the Soviet
Bloc and there are people attempting to obtain it in this country
for them,'' McDermott said.
   Partesius was in the United States on a visitor's visa; Ahmed was
a resident alien living in Alexandria, Va.
   Customs spokesman Charles Conroy said agents believe that
Partesuis, Ahmed and Hady Azimi, who remained in West Germany,
conspired to purchase and export a digital equipment VAX 8820
mainframe computer, which requires a validated export license from
the U.S. Department of Commerce.
   The VAX 8820 has military capabilities and is not eligible for
licensed export to Soviet bloc countries, Conroy said.
   McDermott said the men intially paid $28,000 to agents working
undercover for an IBM computer with military applications and
shipped it to West Germany.
   ``At that purchase they came forward with the deposit to purchase
the VAX 882 and gave a initial deposit. Then last Thursday they came
forward with the balance of the $596,000,'' McDermott said.
   Parthesuis and Ahmed were charged in U.S. District Court with
violating a 4-year-old federal arms export control law and with
conspiracy and money laundering. If convicted on all counts, each
defendant could receive up to 35 years in prison and a $2.5 million
fine.
   The two are being held as federal prisoners at the Maricopa
County Jail without bond, McDermott said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy investigation of the USS Iowa
explosion which killed 47 sailors has found ``various things wrong''
with procedures aboard the battleship but none of them can be
determined to be the specific cause of the blast, a defense official
Monday.
   ``It does not point to the cause of the problem,'' the official
said, ``The report cites a probability.''
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was asked
about reports that crew members of the No. 2 gun turret that blew up
April 19 were not properly certified for their jobs or failed to
follow maintenance procedures designed to prevent breakdown in the
turret.
   The Washington Post reported in its Tuesday editions that the
naval investigation has found the crew faled to perform certain
unspecified preventive maintenance procedures, but the newspaper
added it was not known whether the faulty maintenance caused the
explosion.
   The Post reported the No. 2 turret's guns passed pre-firing
checks before the explosion.
   In a separate story, the Daily Press of Newport News, Va.,
reported the Navy failed to properly qualify the sailors who worked
with the explosives in the turret. The report said the Navy requires
that all who work at such posts be certified by a qualified board in
order to handle the weapons.
   Michael Drowns, one of 11 sailors who escaped turret No. 2 after
the April 19 explosion, told the Daily Press a qualification board
was never convened on the Iowa during his three years on the ship.
   Gunner's Mate 2nd Class John Mullahy and a third Iowa survivor,
Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall Truitt, said one of the sailors who
lacked a qualification book showing facts about the guns was
Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Robert W. Backherms, the rammerman of the
center gun where the explosion occurred. Truitt said Backherms
joined the ship shortly after Christmas, was inexperienced and may
have caused the blasts by ramming the bags of explosives into the
gun too fast.
   Navy and Pentagon officials would not confirm the details in the
two newspaper reports.
   They said the results of the investigation are still in the chain
of command and the review process is not completed. ``Until then, we
are not in a position to comment,'' said Defense Department
spokesman Fred Hoffman.
   Navy spokesman Cmdr. Mark Baker said the investigaive process is
not finished while the report remains in the chain of command and
the chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Carlisle Trost, has not made it
public.
   ``As far as we're concerned, it's all still under
investigation,'' Baker said.
   The Defense Department is expected to make the report public in
early September.
   The report was prepared under the guidance of Rear Adm. Richard
Milligan and was sent last weel to top officials at the Pentagon,
where it is being reviewed by ``a very tightly controlled group of
people,'' another Pentagon source said.
   ``Only a few people currently are working on it. As far as I know
there are no civilians in the group and it's next stop will be on
the desk of the chief of Naval Operations,'' the source said.
   However, the defense official said he was told the report will
show a number of ``lapses in procedures,'' but he said he could not
identify them.
   ``The investigation found various things wrong about procedures.
But none of them has been found to be the cause,'' the official said.
   The official said the investigation has gone deeply into details
of the ship's operations, which means multiple problems could be
found in such a complex operation as a battleship firing its guns.
   ``There were lapses in procedures, but to cite just maintenance
problems would be nitpicking. It does not point to the cause of the
problem,'' the official said.

   Here are some facts and figures about Colombia:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Colombia is bordered on the northwest by Panama, on
the north by the Caribbean, on the east by Venezuela and Brazil, on
the southwest by Peru and Ecuador, and on the west by the Pacific.
   With 456,500 square miles of territory, it is about three times
larger than California. It is mostly tropical on the coast and
eastern plains and cooler in the highlands.
   The capital, Bogota, is the largest city with over 4 million
residents. The other main cities are Cali, Barranquilla and Medellin.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ With more than 29 million inhabitants, Colombia is
95 percent Roman Catholic. The main ethnic groups are mestizo, 58
percent; Caucasian, 20 percent; mulatto, 14 percent; African
descent, 4 percent; mixed African- Indian, 3 percent; Indian, 1
percent. The predominant language is Spanish.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ The chief crops are coffee, accounting for about
half the country's $6 billion in annual exports, which also include
bananas, flowers, sugar, oil, clothing, textiles, cotton and
tobacco. Illegal cocaine earnings bring home an estimated $500
milllion to $1.2 billion annually. Colombia has crude oil reserves
of about 3.2 billion barrels. Mineral resources include gold,
copper, lead, coal, iron and nickel. Colombia's gross national
product grew 3.7 percent last year. Annual inflation is 28 percent.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   POLITICS _ In 1957, the Liberal Party and Conservative Party
formed the ``National Front'' under which they jointly governed,
alternating the presidency every four years and alloting parity in
all elective and appointed offices.
   That arrangement ended ``la violencia,'' a period of warfare
between the parties that killed an estimated 200,000 people from
1948-58. The power- sharing arrangement was phased out during the
1970s.
   The current Liberal Party president, Virgilio Barco Vargas, was
elected in May 1986 and took office three months later.
   Colombia is battling urban leftist guerrilla groups, of which the
April 19th Movement, also known as M-19, is the most aggressive and
best-organized.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Established as the Spanish colony of New Granada in
1549, Colombia proclaimed its independence and formed the Republic
of Greater Colombia in 1819. The nation has been one of the few
functioning democracies in South America for nearly all of its
post-independence history.

<HEAD>Texas Town Says No to Pentagon Plan for Massive Underground Blasts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A south Texas city is fighting to protect the
springs that make it a desert oasis from a Pentagon proposal to rock
a nearby ranch with a series of massive underground explosions.
   The proposed explosions on the Buck King Ranch near Del Rio,
Texas, are an important element in U.S. strategic deterrent
capabilities, says the Defense Nuclear Agency.
   The non-nuclear explosions are designed to simulate the impact of
nuclear blasts on subterranean missile silos and military command
centers.
   But 12,000 of the 40,000 Del Rio residents have signed petitions
asking the agency to take its explosives elsewhere. They say they
don't want to take any chances with the Texas border city's only
source of water, the San Felipe Springs.
   ``We depend on San Felipe Springs for survival,'' says City
Manager Jeffrey Pomeranz. ``The city of Del Rio is not willing to
play a what-if game with our water and the future of our city.
   ``No one in Washington has offered us any guarantees, nor can
they, that if our water supply was adversely affected, the federal
government would step in and correct the situation,'' he said.
   Mexico also has expressed concern to U.S. officials about the
potential impact of the explosions near the border, said Leonardo
French, a spokesman for the Mexican Embassy.
   Defense Nuclear Agency officials, however, say a final decision
to conduct the tests hinges on geological and environmental
assessments of the area that are not yet completed.
   The agency spent two years choosing the site 25 miles north of
Del Rio for the graduated series of explosions.
   The explosions would start with a 1,000-pound charge in 1990,
increasing to 470 tons _ equivalent to 300 tons of TNT _ in November
1992.
   Defense spokeswoman Cheri Abdelnour said the tests would be
performed with the same conventional explosives used by the mining
industry, and do not involve nuclear or radioactive devices.
   Jack M. Bachkosky, director of plans, programs and requirements
for the defense agency, said the tests are ``important to the
continued credibility and viability of our strategic deterrent.''
   ``As an agency, our primary responsibility to the Department of
Defense is to ensure the survivability of our strategic assets and
the effectiveness of those same assets when used against anyone who
might threaten our security,'' he said.
   Del Rio officials were told the purpose of the tests was to
``determine the survivability of underground missile silos and
foreign missile silos and other underground military facilities,''
Pomeranz said.
   But Del Rio residents say water in West Texas is more important.
Last week they became even more skittish when an underground cave-in
contaminated their water with an unknown substance, forcing them to
drink boiled or bottled water for two days.
   Just as the springs are tied to the city's future, they are part
of its past, with the first Spanish explorers writing about the
springs in their chronicles. Long before it was settled, Del Rio was
an oasis on the long, dry trail between San Antonio and San Diego,
Pomeranz said.
   ``Del Rio's entire growth and development is centered around the
San Felipe Springs,'' Pomeranz said.
   On Friday, Pomeranz and Mayor Alfred Gutierrez Jr. met with
Bachkosky and Vice Adm. John T. Parker Jr., Defense Nuclear Agency
director, to ask that the drilling for the core samples be abandoned.
   ``What we're saying is, we've got 12,000 signatures of Del Rioans
who want the project stopped and the city of Del Rio is going to do
everything possible to protect our citizens,'' Pomeranz said.
``Therefore, let's stop the test drilling now, and look for another
site.''

   Federal Reserve policymakers, meeting privately
today, likely will decide against lowering interest rates soon
despite pressure from the Bush administration, analysts say.
   The Federal Open Market Committee, which controls the benchmark
federal funds rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans,
is devising the central bank's monetary strategy for the next six
weeks.
   But, as usual under the committee's procedure, the results won't
be publicly disclosed until Oct. 6, three days after the next
meeting.
   Most analysts expected the Fed to hold interest rates steady
unless it sees unexpected signs that economic growth is fizzling.
   ``I don't think they're going to do much of anything right now,''
said economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   ``They can say their policies are working pretty much as desired.
The economy is still moving up and the inflation numbers have been
fairly good.''
   The central bank, which tries to regulate the nation's economy by
manipulating interest rates, has been engaged in a delicate
balancing act over the past 18 months.
   It is trying to hold inflation in check by moderating economic
growth but at the same time keep the country from toppling into what
would be the first recession since 1982.
   President Bush tried last week to tip the balance in favor of
lower rates, which would stimulate economic growth and revenue to
the government. Bush endorsed comments by his budget director,
Richard Darman, who said it would be the Fed's fault if the economy
falls into a recession.
   Steinberg, however, warned that such lobbying of the Fed, a
fiercely independent agency, may backfire.
   ``If anything, it causes them to dig in their heels,'' he said.
   The Fed believes economic growth of only a little more than 2
percent a year is sustainable without fueling inflation, but the
administration is looking for growth closer to 3 percent this year
to help it reduce the federal budget deficit.
   ``In a $5 trillion economy, that's not peanuts,'' said David
Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government securities dealer in
New York. ``In fact, for every 1 percent increase in growth, Mr.
Darman gets an extra $25 billion in revenue to help ease the budget
deficit.''
   Jones said there is a split in the 12-member FOMC, which consists
of seven Federal Reserve Board governors _ although there is one
vacancy _ and five presidents of regional Federal Reserve Banks.
   Board members have tended to favor easier money, while regional
bank presidents have leaned toward tighter policy, he said.
   Board member Wayne Angell told the Kansas Livestock Association
on Friday that he believed the Fed has succeeded in curbing
inflation, which he predicted would decline from about 5 percent a
year to about 3 percent.
   Earlier last week however, Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Cleveland, and Gary Stern, president of the Fed in
Minneapolis, told bankers at a University of Wisconsin forum that
they believed economic growth was accelerating, a sign that
inflation won't subside.
   At least for now, it's hard to say for sure which faction is
right, economists say. The Fed only recently began easing its tight
money policy.
   From March 1988 to March 1989, the Fed pushed short-term interest
rates up by 3 percentage points in an effort to curb the economy and
bring inflationary pressures under control.
   It paused for several months and then in early June, as signs of
sluggish growth emerged, reversed course and began to push rates
lower.
   Now, as economic reports come in for July, it appears the Fed has
exactly what it wants. The most recent data suggests the economy has
recovered a bit from sluggishness in the April-June quarter.
   The Fed's index of industrial production rose in July after
falling the two previous months. And new home construction rebounded
in June and July from four consecutive monthly declines.
   Consumer price inflation, which from January through May soared
at the worst rate in seven years, averaging 0.5 percent to 0.6
percent each month, fell to 0.2 percent in both June and July.

   When a new home is offered for sale, even in
the heart of big-city suburbia, it very often adds to farm income
with an eye-catching display of freshly planted shrubs and green sod
almost ready to mow.
   Add cut flowers and floral arrangements for weddings, funerals,
lovers, Aunt Sophie and sick friends and you have horticulture _ one
of the fastest developing sectors in U.S. agriculture.
   Since 1982, says an Agriculture Department economist, the
horticulture industry has grown an average of 10 percent a year.
   Preliminary figures for 1988 show that producers of horticultural
products had cash receipts totaling $6.9 billion, which was more
than 9 percent of the $72.4 billion received by farmers last year
for all crops.
   For example, according to USDA statistics, the $6.9 billion for
flowers, shrubs, sod and other greenery exceed 1988 cash receipts
for cotton, $4.7 billion, and tobacco, $2.04 billion, and was
creeping up on feed crops _ including corn _ $7.68 billion.
   Doyle Johnson of the department's Economic Research Service said
the industry was in two sectors. Floriculture includes cut flowers,
potted flowering plants, bedding plants and cut cultivated greens
such as ferns used in arrangements.
   The other is environmental horticulture, which includes all other
nursery and greenhouse products.
   Johnson's analysis of the rapid growth of the horticulture
industry is in the September issue of Farmline magazine.
   ``One of the reasons for the increase in horticultural sales is
that the housing industry is spending more for sod and other
landscape ornamentals,'' the report said. ``Also, cities are doing
more landscaping in the inner cities as well as in parks and along
highways.''
   California accounts for about 23 percent of total horticultural
sales, followed by Florida, nearly 15 percent, and Texas, 7 percent.
   Of 2 million farms in the United States, there are fewer than
38,000 horticultural operations. But in 1987, the most recent
statistics available, those had sales averaging $154,818 each,
compared with $65,165 for all farms.
   There are an estimated 57,000 retail floral outlets in the United
States, the report said. Mass-market outlets, mostly grocery stores,
account for 21,000, but the majority, an estimated 36,000, are
independent retail floral shops.
   According to 1986 figures, grocery store sales of flowers and
plants amounted to $1.49 billion, averaging $28 per square feet of
store space, compared with $8 to $12 for other produce, the report
said.
   The United States is the world's largest producer of flowers and
plants, and American growers control about 95 percent of the
domestic market, the report said. But imports are important,
totaling $451 million last year.
   Colombia is the largest source of the imports, the report said.
Others include the Netherlands, Canada, Costa Rica and Mexico.

   British wine drinkers offer a potential growth
market for U.S. producers, the Agriculture Department says.
   Robert Fondahn, the U.S. agricultural trade officer in London,
says per capita wine consumption in the United Kingdom grew from 2
liters in 1967 to 12 liters in 1987.
   ``It currently is the only growth market in Europe for wine,'' he
said. ``With 41 supplying countries, the United Kingdom has become
the most sought after wine market in the world.''
   Fondahn said in the September issue of AgExporter magazine that
the U.K. imports 57.4 million cases of wine annually, compared with
domestic production of 9.4 million cases.
   Although the U.S. market share is less than 1 percent, last
year's sales of American wine to the U.K. rose 20 percent to 550,000
cases, he said.
   Consumers prefer white wines over red, although there has been
substantial increases in red and rose wines lately.
   ``The most dramatic development in wine sales in recent years has
been the establishment of wine bars,'' Fondahn said. ``These
establishments have introduced a large segment of the population to
a variety of wines. Many of the wine bars offer their wines by the
case for home consumption.''
   Fondahn said that as a member of the European Economic Community,
the U.K. must comply with EEC requirements for the importation of
wine.
   These requirements can be stringent and, in some cases, can
hinder the sale of U.S. wine in the U.K., he said.

   Catfish production continues to increase, but
the Agriculture Department says producers are getting lower prices
than they did a year ago.
   Production in July totaled 27.8 million pounds of live weight
delivered to processing plants, the department said Monday in its
monthly report. That was up 17 percent from July 1988.
   But prices paid to growers averaged 71 cents per pound, down 9
cents a pound from a year earlier, the report said.
   Production through the first seven months of 1989 totaled 196.6
million pounds, up 16 percent from the same period last year.

<HEAD>Budget Director Warns of Possible Program Cuts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's battles against drugs, AIDS, tax
cheats and dangerous airways could be undermined unless Congress
implements an agreement to cut the budget deficit, the Bush
administration says.
   Such spending programs may have to be arbitrarily cut _ and $8.1
billion taken from the military budget _ unless the 1990 deficit is
reduced to the level allowed by law, says Richard G. Darman,
director of the Office of Management and Budget.
   However, in a report to President Bush and Congress on Monday,
Darman said across-the-board spending cuts are avoidable.
   ``It remains my hope, and my cautiously optimistic expectation,
that necessary legislation'' cutting selected programs and raising
revenues can be enacted when Congress returns Sept. 5, Darman said.
   The government can avoid the across-the-board reductions if
Congress will implement a budget-cutting agreement reached with Bush
in April, Darman said. He noted that almost none of that agreement
has been enacted into law.
   The deficit is on a path that, in the absence of further
congressional action, would lead to $116.2 billion of red ink during
the 1990 budget year, which begins Oct. 1. That's down from about
$170 billion this year.
   The law limits the 1990 deficit to $100 billion.
   As a result of the estimate, Darman told reporters, Bush will
issue an order Friday to cut _ ``sequester'' in Washington jargon _
$16.2 billion worth of spending, half from the military budget and
half from most non-military programs. But that order will be only a
warning; the real cuts would not be ordered until Oct. 15.
   In his report, Darman listed specific cuts that would be required
in specific programs, ranging from a $1 billion slash in salaries
and benefits for the Army to a $7 million reduction in health
benefits for retired federal workers.
   Among the effects that could occur, Darman said, are:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _A cut below this year's level in funds for the Drug Enforcement
Administration, which ``could undermine its ability to wage an
aggressive war on drugs.'' The Coast Guard might have to ground
aircraft needed for critical interdiction activities.
   _Reductions ``would severely hamper the Public Health Service's
efforts to prevent HIV (the AIDS virus) transmission and conduct
research into therapies and vaccines.''
   _The effect on the Federal Aviation Administration ``could
include a furlough of up to three days per month of all FAA staff,
including air traffic control and maintenance personnel.''
   _Internal Revenue Service funding would be reduced; the agency
could lose 4,700 workers, meaning 10 million fewer
taxpayer-assistance calls could be answered and fewer returns could
be audited.
   _About 1 million needy college students would lose federal
education grants.
   _The Defense Department might be forced to cut 160,000 personnel.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, senior Republican on the House
Budget Committee, predicted that once the smoke clears, ``Congress
is going to lurch across the finish line'' and avoid the arbitrary
cuts.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the committee, cautioned
that ``Congress should not be lulled to sleep by OMB's artificially
low deficit projections. Even with these dubious economic and
spending assumptions, we face the possibility of harsh
across-the-board spending cuts this fall ... and ... we still need
$30 billion to $60 billion in additional deficit reduction for
1991.''
   Darman also noted a greater effort will be required a year from
now to cut the deficit further. But Bush's opposition to a tax
increase is unchanged, he said.
   ``We still say revenues (tax increases) don't have to be on the
(negotiating) table for 1991.''

   For American parents, the old-time preference
for boys seems to be giving way to a desire for a child of each sex.
   Parents with two boys or two girls are quicker to have a third
child than those with one of each gender, report researchers Paul T.
Schollaert and Jay D. Teachman.
   And, contrary to their expectations, parents who have a son first
try again slightly sooner than those who start with a daughter, they
report in the August edition of Demography, the journal of the
Population Association of America.
   ``The American norm really is a boy-girl family,'' Schollaert, of
Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., said in a telephone
interview.
   That finding, he added, could ease fears that the ability to
select the gender of children could lead to an excess of boys.
   ``Our results are straightforward. The gender of children affects
birth timing. Yet it is not whether a child is a boy or a girl that
is important,'' reported Teachman and Schollaert.
   ``Women with two boys or two girls are more likely to time a
third birth rapidly than are women with a boy and a girl,'' they
said.
   Their conclusions were based on an analysis of births to more
than 2,000 women, reported in the National Survey of Family Growth
in 1973, 1976 and 1982.
   By recording births every six months they were able to compare
whether women in one group had births before those in other groups.
They did not report the actual length of time between births,
however.
   Were they surprised that parents who had sons first were quicker
to have a second child than those who had a daughter first?
   ``Oh, we were,'' responded Schollaert.
   In many societies there is a strong preference for boys, leading
to the killing of female babies in some countries, Schollaert said.
   Past studies in this country have indicated a slight preference
for boys. ``So, logic is that if you tried once and had a daughter
you'd be more likely to go try again quickly,'' he said.
   ``What, we found, to the contrary, was that those who had sons
were more likely to have a rapid (second) birth,'' he said.
   However, he explained that the slight preference for boys still
might be the reason.
   Schollaert said he and Teachman found that ``couples that have
sons are slightly more likely to stay married, and, of course, the
most powerful determinant of whether you have another child in short
order is `are you married.'''
   Tradition has it that people prefer boys, and that slight
preference in American society has a bearing, he said.
   Fathers are ``more likely to be involved with their sons than
their daughters. This involvement leads to greater familial ties and
interdependencies that work against marital dissolution,'' said
Teachman and Schollaert. Studies have found that parents who have a
daughter first are somewhat more likely to divorce than those who
have a son.
   Thus, women with sons were more likely to remain married and to
have a second child. Women with daughters, being more likely to be
divorced or separated, had a reduced likelihood of having second
children, they concluded.

<HEAD>Fed Won't Penalize Japanese-Owned Securities Companies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board is passing up an
opportunity to penalize Japanese-owned securities companies in the
United States, instead praising Tokyo for making ``substantial''
progress in opening its markets to U.S. companies.
   The board voted 5-1 Monday to allow Japanese-owned companies to
continue operating as primary dealers of U.S. Treasury debt. A staff
report concluded the Japanese government offered U.S. companies a
fair chance to participate in its debt sales.
   ``Much progress has been made,'' the report said. ``The structure
of the (Japanese) market now compares favorably with the state of
development in other industrial countries, and the actions that have
been taken in recent years to open the market are substantial.''
   In the United States, any company may buy Treasury debt. However,
only 42 _ 11 fully or partly Japanese-owned _ are designated by the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York as primary dealers, eligible to
trade securities with the central bank as part of its regulation of
the economy.
   Omnibus trade legislation passed by Congress a year ago required
the Federal Reserve to remove foreign-owned companies from the
primary dealer list if their nations didn't afford ``the same
competitive opportunities'' to U.S. companies.
   The United States runs a persistent deficit with Japan in the
trade of goods. One of the ways it makes up part of that gap is
through the trade of services such as those offered by securities
companies.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who pushed for the securities
provision in the trade bill, said he agreed Japan had made enough
progress to avoid sanctions. However, he said the central bank
should have been more critical.
   ``The Fed's decision that Japan's markets are fully competitive
is premature,'' he said in a statement. ``While I agree Japan has
made progress ... the markets are not even close to fully
competitive.''
   Legislators have warned that unless the United States insists on
full access to Japanese financial markets, the U.S. brokerage
industry will slip behind in international competition, as have U.S.
auto and steel companies.
   The Fed staff conceded the barriers to U.S. participation in
Japanese government debt markets had existed, but noted a major
improvement this year.
   In April, Japan began selling 40 percent of its 10-year bonds,
the most important government security issued, through a competitive
auction, leaving 60 percent to be sold through negotiation with a
syndicate of securities companies and banks.
   Previously, all 10-year bonds had been sold through the
syndicate. The staff also noted that foreign participation in the
syndicate has increased from about 1 percent in 1986 to 8 percent
last year.
   The Japanese buy about a third of the U.S. government's long-term
bonds, according to analysts.
   Board member Martha Seger dissented, noting that the law requires
Japan to offer ``the same competitive opportunities,'' not simply to
improve.
   In particular, U.S. companies still complain that Japanese
officials provide advance information to Japanese companies on
government economic data, putting other companies at a disadvantage.
   However, the central bank staff said the Japanese have taken
steps to curb this abuse and that ``further steps are expected.''

<TEXT>
   The federal deficit through July is running 13
percent behind last year, but analysts and the government say
savings and loan bailout spending will swell the budget gap in
August and September.
   The Treasury Department said Monday that the government posted a
smaller-than-expected deficit of $18.2 billion in July, the 10th
month of the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.
   It attributed the 20.4 percent decline from July 1988 to a shift
in payment dates for military salaries, veterans' benefits and
Supplemental Security Income. Those payments, normally made July 1,
were shifted to June 30 because July 1 fell on a Saturday.
   The shift caused the government to record a smaller-than-usual
$7.8 billion surplus in June, normally a more positive month because
people and corporations make quarterly tax payments.
   Through July, the deficit totals $123.8 billion, 13 percent lower
than the same period for fiscal 1988.
   ``This is a good news-bad news story,'' said economist David
Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government securities dealer in
New York. ``The good news is the July deficit is lower than
expected. The bad news is that August and September will see
substantial increases in Treasury borrowing because of the S&amp;L
bailout.''
   The thrift rescue law signed by President Bush on Aug. 9 will add
$20 billion in borrowing. So far this month, the Treasury has
expanded its borrowing by $5 billion and officials say they intend
to borrow the remaining $15 billion in the next six weeks.
   The Bush administration had been forecasting a 1989 deficit of
$148.3 billion, an improvement over the 1988 red ink of $155.2
billion. But, Budget Director Richard Darman said Monday the
administration expects just under $170 billion in red ink. The
Congressional Budget Office forecasts a $161 billion deficit for
this year.
   Revenue last month totaled $66.3 billion, up 9.2 percent from a
year ago, while spending was up only 1.1 percent to $84.5 billion.
   As usual, the government's largest spending category last month
was military spending, which totaled $20.5 billion in July and
$241.8 billion so far this year, up 2 percent from 1988.
   Other large spending categories were:
   _Interest on the national debt, the fastest growing item: $16
billion last month and $207.3 billion so far in fiscal 1989, up 12.9
percent from the previous year.
   _Social Security: $18.6 billion in July and $188.7 billion so far
this year, up 6 percent from 1988.
   _Other programs in the Department of Health and Human Services:
$13.1 billion last month and $141.6 billion so far in 1989, up 8.3
percent from a year earlier.

   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins is offering
to negotiate with 11 governors over environmental monitoring of
federal nuclear facilities within their borders.
   The states _ California, Ohio, Florida, Idaho, Missouri, Nevada,
New Mexico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington _ are
hosts to a variety of Energy Department defense nuclear facilities,
including nuclear reactors, processing plants, weapons assembly
facilities and waste treatment and storage operations.
   The department said Monday that it wanted to reach agreements
that would allow the states to independently validate the
department's own environmental monitoring data, and to involve the
states in setting priorities and schedules for nuclear waste cleanup.
   Henson Moore, the deputy energy secretary, said the proposed
agreements would be ``unprecedented in their scope and in the degree
of access to DOE facilities that will be provided to the states.''
   He said the accords would be similar to a model agreement signed
June 28 by Watkins and Colorado Gov. Roy Romer over state access to
the Rocky Flats nuclear plant near Denver.
   The Reagan administration had vigorously opposed state actions to
enforce hazardous waste laws at defense nuclear facilities, but
President Bush has taken a more accommodating view in the wake of
disclosures about mismanagement and possible criminal violations of
environmental laws at some plants.

<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia Court of Appeals says
Dr. Elizabeth Morgan must remain in jail until she reveals the
whereabouts of her daughter in a bitter custody dispute.
   The full court ruling came shortly after a three-judge panel
ruled 2-1 that Morgan should be released. The court, in its one-page
order, called for a new hearing on Morgan's appeal of the civil
contempt of court citation that has kept her at the city jail for
two years.
   The prominent plastic surgeon was jailed Aug. 28, 1987, by
Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon for failing to produce her
daughter, Hilary, for visits with Dr. Eric Foretich, Morgan's former
husband and the girl's father.
   Morgan said she hid the girl because Foretich had sexually abused
the child. Foretich denies the allegations.
   Hilary, whose 7th birthday was Monday, remains hidden. Foretich
was joined on the Capitol steps by about a dozen relatives and
supporters to mark his daughter's birthday.
   In Monday's majority opinion by the three-judge panel, Judge John
M. Ferren said Dixon's attempt to coerce Morgan into divulging the
girl's whereabouts had failed.
   Meanwhile, Foretich has filed a $220 million suit against CBS and
six other defendants in connection with the program ``People
Magazine on TV.'' The Aug. 16 program carried a story about the
custody dispute.
   The suit, filed Friday, alleges that Foretich was defamed,
subjected to emotional distress, suffered an invasion of privacy and
was portrayed in a false light.
   CBS spokeswoman Anne Morforgen said she had not seen the suit and
could not comment.

<HEAD>Report Outlines Possible U.S. Bases in Singapore</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The administration is studying a classified
report on the feasibility of establishing U.S. bases in Singapore, a
State Department official says.
   The report, compiled by a technical military team that visited
the tiny Asian city-state in June, was submitted to the chief of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and other government agencies, a department
official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Monday.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the United States
and Singapore ``have been discussing the possibility of greater
security cooperation for some time. ... We've made no decisions nor
any commitments with regard to how we might follow up on these
discussions.''
   The report comes as the administration prepares to negotiate with
the Philippines to renew the lease of six U.S. military facilities
that expire in 1991.
   Boucher said the discussions with Singapore were not linked with
the Philippines talks.
   Other officials say Singapore would be far too small to hold
Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay Naval Base and the four other

<HEAD>$3.4 Billion Needed for Cleanup of 10 Sites: Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Creative financing such as taxes on polluters
should be considered to pay for the multibillion-dollar cost of
cleaning up the Great Lakes, a new study says.
   The Northeast-Midwest Institute, which does research for members
of Congress from 18 states, estimated that up to $3.4 billion will
be needed to restore 10 of the lakes' dirtiest areas.
   ``The real challenge right now ... is how to pay for the
cleanup,'' Michael J. Donahue, executive director of the Great Lakes
Commission in Ann Arbor, Mich., said Monday.
   Federal funds are available through a variety of programs to help
with the cleanup, such as the Superfund for toxic wastes. But the
institute report urges Congress to establish a trust fund, or
``aquafund,'' with money from new taxes on water users and
manufacturers of the chemicals found in harbor and river sediment.
   A U.S.-Canadian commission has classified 42 areas as so polluted
they are unfit for swimming, drinking, fishing and, in some cases,
navigation.
   Estimates of cleanup costs have been made for 10 of those areas:
Fox River-Green Bay and Milwaukee Harbor in Wisconsin; Waukegan
Harbor in Illinois; Grand Calumet River-Indiana Harbor in Indiana;
Saginaw River-Saginaw Bay, Clinton River and Rouge River, all in
Michigan; Black River and Ashtabula River-Harbor in Ohio; and
Rochester Embayment in New York.
   The estimated cost of cleaning up all 10 areas is $2.9 billion to
$3.4 billion, the report said. However, it said that estimate is
probably too low because cleanup costs have been set for only 19 of
the 55 contamination sources identified at the sites.

   Patricia Diaz Dennis will resign her seat at
the Federal Communications Commission on Sept. 30 to return to
private law practice.
   Dennis, a Democrat, said Monday that she would join the
Washington firm of Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue as partner and
chairwoman of its communications section. She said she had asked
President Bush not to consider her for reappointment to the FCC post
she has held since June 1986.
   Dennis' three-year term expired June 30.
   Her departure will give the five-member commission its only
vacancy. FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes was sworn in earlier this month
and Commissioner Sherrie Marshall was sworn in Monday by
Commissioner James Quello, a Democrat who will remain.
   Andrew Barrett has been confirmed by the Senate and awaits

<NOTE>GAO Report: Staff Shortages Hurt AIDS Education Efforts</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Centers for Disease Control doesn't have
the staff it needs to monitor local AIDS prevention programs and
coordinate education efforts, the General Accounting Office says.
   The center sought 65 additional employees this year, but money
was available for only 35 positions.
   The report released Monday was prepared at the request of Sen.
John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee.
   ``We must make sure that every dollar spent on (AIDS) prevention
counts, and this report raises serious questions in my mind as to
whether this investment is being managed wisely,'' Glenn said in a
statement.
   ``The Reagan administration refused to give CDC all the tools it
needed to fight this deadly disease. How many lives has this rigid
frugality cost?''
   Dr. James O. Mason, assistant secretary of the Department of
Health and Human Services, complained to Congress earlier this month
that it too often has authorized programs but failed to come through
with the cash needed to run them.
   Last month, the number of Americans diagnosed as having AIDS
surpassed the 100,000 mark. More than 58,000 have died.

<TEXT>
   A high-ranking Interior Department official is
out of a job after failing to pass a security check, officials say.
   Katherine Chang Dress was fired as acting deputy assistant
interior secretary, said Steven Goldstein, press spokesman for
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan.
   Dress agreed in June to resign effective July 31, but changed her
mind last week and decided not to submit a resignation, Goldstein
said Monday night. He said Dress was ``a fine employee'' and would
not elaborate on why she was fired.
   The spokesman said Dress told her staff she was dismissed because
she failed to pass her security investigation. That was confirmed by
other officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Dress had been acting deputy assistant secretary for territorial
and international affairs since early May. She had no access to
classified information pending completion of her security check,
when she would have been moved from the ``acting'' category,
Goldstein said.
   The department's Office of Territorial and International Affairs
is in charge of the Virgin Islands and relations with the trust
territories and other U.S. dependencies in the Pacific.
   The deputy assistant's job does not require Senate confirmation.
Dress previously served in the Peace Corps and the Commerce
Department. After her appointment was announced, she attended a Rose
Garden Ceremony where President Bush praised her as one of the
highest-ranking Asian-Americans in his administration.
   A woman who answered the telephone at the Dress home Monday night
said she was ``not available.''

<HEAD>Investigation Finds Many Problems, No Cause of Iowa Blast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Procedures aboard the USS Iowa are the focus of
a Navy investigation into an explosion that killed 47 sailors, but a
Defense Department official says the specific cause of the blast
can't be determined.
   Reports published in The Washington Post and The Daily Press of
Newport News, Va., say the Navy report found that crew members
failed to perform preventive maintenance and that sailors weren't
properly certified for their jobs.
   The Navy, which says the report on the April 19 explosion will be
made public next month, refused to comment on either story.
   ``As far as we're concerned, it's all still under
investigation,'' said Navy spokesman Cmdr. Mark Baker.
   The Defense Department official, who spoke Monday on condition of
anonymity, said the Navy report ``does not point to the cause of the
problem. The report cites a probability.''
   The Washington Post reported in today's editions that the
investigation has found the crew failed to perform certain
unspecified preventive maintenance procedures. However, the
newspaper said it was not known whether the faulty maintenance
caused the explosion.
   The No. 2 turret's guns passed pre-firing checks before the
explosion, the Post said.
   The Daily Press reported Monday that the Navy failed to properly
qualify the sailors who worked with explosives in the turret.
   Navy regulations require that all sailors and civilian employees
who work with explosives be certified at their posts by a
Qualification Board. Sailors who lack certification are permitted to
handle weapons only in the presence of a supervisor.
   Michael Drowns, one of 11 sailors who escaped turret No. 2 after
the explosion, told the Daily Press that a Qualification Board was
never convened during his three years on the Iowa. Drowns received
an honorable discharge from the Navy Aug. 11.
   Other Iowa sailors and a Navy officer familiar with the
investigation confirmed Drowns' statements, but asked that they not
be identified for fear of retribution by the Navy.
   Adm. Richard Milligan, who headed the Navy's probe, said no
records of a Qualification Board had been found on the Iowa, a
source told the Daily Press. Milligan has declined to comment
publicly.
   NBC News reported last month that investigators believed the
explosion was the result of suicidal sabotage by Gunner's Mate
Clayton Hartwig. Navy spokesman Lt. Greg Smith said July 19 that the
conclusion of suicide was not based on official Navy reports.
   The defense official said Monday that he was told the report
would show a number of ``lapses in procedures,'' but he said he
could not identify them.
   ``The investigation found various things wrong about procedures.
But none of them has been found to be the cause,'' he said.
   The investigation has gone into details of the ship's operations,
which means multiple problems could be found in such a complex
operation as a battleship firing its guns, he said.
   ``There were lapses in procedures, but to cite just maintenance
problems would be nitpicking. It does not point to the cause of the
problem,'' the official said.
   Drowns and another survivor, Gunner's Mate 2nd Class John
Mullahy, said the turret's senior enlisted man, Senior Chief
Gunner's Mate Reginald O. Ziegler, was concerned before the
explosion about the lack of qualification booklets.
   Ziegler, one of the 47 sailors who died, had given photocopied
pages of the Performance Qualification Standard booklets to some
sailors.
   Navy regulations require that sailors have the books.
   Mullahy and another survivor, Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall
Truitt, said one of the sailors who lacked a book was Gunner's Mate
3rd Class Robert W. Backherms, the rammerman of the center gun where
the explosion occurred.
   Truitt said Backherms joined the ship shortly after Christmas,
was inexperienced and may have caused the blast by ramming the bags
of explosives into the gun too fast.

   A panel of 12 churchgoers was selected to
try Jim Bakker while the PTL founder's wife pleaded on the couple's
television show for money from the faithful.
   The jury selected Monday includes Baptists, Presbyterians and
Catholics, most of whom said they attend church regularly and give
to their church, but do not watch PTL or other religious television
programs.
   ``Our faith is in God,'' Bakker proclaimed as he strode into the
U.S. District Courthouse with his attorneys and daughter.
   Back in Orlando, Fla., Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye, carried on
their live television broadcast, urging viewers to send money and
pray for her husband.
   ``Everything that has to do with Christian television is on trial
when Jim walks in that courtroom,'' she said shortly after the ``Jim
and Tammy Show'' opened Monday morning.
   Bakker, who has pleaded innocent, is charged with eight counts of
mail fraud, 15 counts of wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit mail
and wire fraud. If convicted on all counts, he could face 120 years
in prison and $5 million in fines.
   Earlier this month, former PTL Executive Vice President Richard
Dortch, who was indicted with Bakker, pleaded guilty to charges of
fraud and conspiracy. Last month, former Bakker aides James and
David Taggart were convicted of tax evasion. All three are potential
government witnesses.
   In jury selection Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter
questioned 49 people about their religious affiliation, whether they
had ever donated to television evangelists, how regularly they
attended church and whether they had ever been ``born again,'' had a
deep religious experience or felt they had been called by God into a
vocation.
   Seven jurors were dismissed, including four who said they could
not put aside their opinions to give Bakker a fair trial.
   Potter warned the jurors not to discuss the case with anyone
before opening arguments begin next Monday. Prosecutors and defense
attorneys are under a gag order imposed by Potter, and would not
discuss jury selection.
   Bakker left by a side door after jury selection was completed.
   Besides the Taggarts and Dortch, Potter said the potential
witnesses at the trial included several former PTL board members,
including actor Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and Charles Cookman, the
Assemblies of God superintendent from Dunn, N.C.
   Mrs. Bakker was listed as a possible defense witness.
   Jessica Hahn, whom PTL paid money to stay quiet about a sexual
encounter with Bakker, and Virginia evangelist Jerry Falwell, who
took over the PTL empire in Fort Mill, S.C., after Bakker quit in
March 1987, were not mentioned as possible witnesses.
   Bakker and his attorneys have declined to discuss their defense
strategy, but he has said he knew little about PTL's finances.
   Mrs. Bakker stayed in Orlando, where Bakker transplanted his
ministry, to carry on their daily live broadcast.
   ``We need you to really pray for him,'' a tearful Mrs. Bakker
told viewers.
   The Bakkers have pleaded with supporters to contribute $1 million
for Bakker's defense fund. A letter sent two months ago said half of
that amount had to be raised by the end of the month.
   Ministry officials have declined to say how much has been raised.
   It was earlier appeals for $1,000 donations to buy ``lifetime
partnerships'' at the PTL ministry that landed Bakker in federal
court.
   Prosecutors say he and top aides at the Heritage USA ministry
diverted more than $4 million of the $158 million contributed under
various partnership programs to their personal uses.
   The Bakkers lived in a $1.3 million parsonage in Tega Cay, S.C.,
where they had an air-conditioned dog house. Their condo in Florida
had gold-plated faucets and mirrored walls that would give a view of
the ocean from all directions.

   Tammy Faye Bakker says she is confident her
husband will be acquitted of fraud and bribery charges in the
diversion of $4 million from the now-defunct PTL television ministry.
   While Jim Bakker went on trial Monday in Charlotte, N.C., Mrs.
Bakker continued their new ``Jim and Tammy'' shows to eight cable TV
outlets around the country.
   In a live broadcast from their makeshift TV studio at a shopping
mall in Orlando, Mrs. Bakker said the government was doing
everything it could to keep their church off the air.
   But she added, raising a fist, ``We're going to win!''
   Bakker, who has pleaded innocent, is charged with diverting $4
million from the PTL treasury to support a lavish lifestyle.
   During the television show, Mrs. Bakker shed tears, giggled and
prayed with her guests and 35 members of a studio audience.
   Mrs. Bakker said there were ``terrible things happening in
Charlotte. ... It's like a circus.
   ``Not only Jim is on trial, but I believe the church is on
trial,'' she said.
   She blew a kiss to her husband, whom she said would be watching
the program, and said: ``I love you sweetheart. Be a brave soldier.
Don't you dare give up.''
   She also urged supporters to call a special pledge line to make
donations, saying that the new TV ministry, which began broadcasting
from here earlier this year, may have to go off the air because of
``a mountain of finances'' and debts of $200,000 she and her husband
incurred months ago.
   But she made no direct mention of a special $1 million legal
defense fund which the Bakkers started last month.
   Phones jangled sporadically throughout the broadcast as
volunteers answered callers pledging money.
   The show also included inspirational stories from the Rev. Roy
Harthern of the Grace Covenant Baptist Church in Orlando and the
Rev. John Dawsey of the Lake George Ministries Retreat in Lake
George, Fla., where the Bakkers were given ``spiritual refuge'' for
several months after leaving their home near Charlotte.
   Harthern told the TV audience that ``Jim has repented and he's
sincere.'' Later, the minister told reporters that he was there
because ``Bakker needs a friend. I'm not trying to condone or
condemn. If he's guilty, only God and Jim know whether it was
intentional. I'm convinced there is sincere repentance.''

   Robert DeNiro, whose widely varied roles included
an architect in the movie ``Falling in Love,'' is overseeing the
conversion of an eight-story building in lower Manhattan to house
his new production company.
   ``This is my first production company, and the first time I'm an
executive,'' DeNiro was quoted as saying in the September issue of
Manhattan, inc. ``I don't know, maybe I'm creating some security for
myself in my old age. Ten years ago I wouldn't have done this. Five
years ago, I don't know.
   ``But I was thinking, if I'm ever going to do this, I'd better do
it now.''
   The former Martinson Coffee factory in the city's Tribeca
section, where DeNiro has lived for 10 years, will become a
60,000-square-foot film production center, complete with editing
facilities and a screening room.
   On the first floor will be the Tribeca Bar and Grill, backed by
DeNiro and some buddies: Bill Murray, Sean Penn, Mikhail
Baryshnikov, Christopher Walken, Peter Max and others.
   ``I thought, this would be like a community center, a place that
was responsible for making good movies,'' DeNiro told the magazine.
``But it'll take on its own life.''

   Actor Rob Lowe says there is nothing wrong with
his ethics, but he admits he made a mistake when he videotaped a sex
encounter with two young women in Atlanta during last year's
Democratic National Convention.
   ``I could be the poster boy for bad judgment,'' the actor said in
an interview to be broadcast on NBC TV's ``Today'' show on Wednesday.
   ``I'm not making excuses for myself. I'm a man and I stand up to
mistakes I've made,'' he said. ``Thing is, I knew it immediately
after making the mistake.''
   Lowe, who was interviewed on the Los Angeles set of his new
movie, ``Bad Influence,'' said he knew the story would surface
eventually.
   ``I knew that any day I could pick up the paper and,
theoretically, see my picture on the front page. It was no fun,
believe me, and it was very stressful. It still is,'' he said.
   Lowe has agreed to perform 20 hours of community service to avoid
prosecution for allegedly seducing one of the women, then
16-year-old Jan Parsons.
   A suit against Lowe filed by the teen-ager's mother is pending.

   A $38.8 million hospital for critically ill
newborns and women with high-risk pregnancies is preparing to open,
thanks to fund-raising efforts by golfer Arnold Palmer.
   The Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children &amp; Women is billed as one
of only four of its kind in the nation. The 255-bed facility, which
will serve all of central Florida, is located on the campus of the
Orlando Regional Medical Center in Orlando.
   ``I saw the children's hospital as an opportunity, as having an
impact on the whole state of children's health care for the entire
region,'' said Dr. John Tilelli, a pediatric intensive care
specialist at the hospital who came from St. Paul, Minn., two years

   Palmer headed the fund-raising program, and about $4.5 million
can be attributed directly to his association with the project, said

   Palestinians are in a state of political turmoil
as sharp differences have emerged over the future direction of the
20-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation.
   The tensions, which coincided with greater violence aimed at
Israelis and among Palestinians themselves, come at a time of rising
frustration over the lack of progress in the U.S.-PLO dialogue and
in efforts to arrange negotiations with Israel.
   Prominent Palestinians argue the internal debate has not shaken
the underlying commitment to continue the intefadeh, or uprising, as
the only way to spur negotiations and achieve an independent state.
   ``Internally, we have some difficulties. We are in the midst of a
re-evaluation of our tactics. But the dialogue is healthy,'' said
Ghassan Khatib, a lecturer at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank.
   Leftists are urging the PLO to make no further compromises on the
diplomatic front, and some are pushing for more violent actions,
such as the use of weapons, to pressure Israel in what they see as a
long-term war of attrition.
   At the same time, some of the uprising's more ambitious tactics
have flopped, increasing fears among some Palestinians that the
credibility of the underground leadership could be undermined.
   For example, many workers in the West Bank ignored a call from
the pro-PLO underground to stage a week-long sympathy strike for
collegues in the Gaza Strip who were refusing to accept new Israeli
identity cards.
   ``The leadership shouldn't make calls that they can't
implement,'' said Khatib.
   Disunity also arose recently in public in several West Bank
schools where PLO chief Yasser Arafat's followers urged students to
attend classes during a general strike and met opposition from
leftists who feared it would undermine solidarity.
   In Al Askar refugee camp, about 150 supporters of Arafat's
mainstream Fatah wearing black headdresses engaged in fistfights
over the school issue with 50 members of Marxist PLO factions
wearing red headdresses.
   Daoud Kuttab, a Palestinian journalist said ``lack of
discipline'' in the uprising also was apparent in a new tendency by
Palestinians to break with a publicly proclaimed PLO policy of
restraint and launch individual actions, some of them violent.
   The underground leadership is ``asking people daily to sacrifice
their lives, but people are not seeing tangible changes and their
endurance and patience with the leadership becomes thin,'' Kuttab
said.
   As a result, he said, there were more ``uncontrolled actions''
such as the lone Palestinian who, to avenge the beating of a friend
by soldiers, forced a bus off a highway July 6, killing 16 Jews and
injuring 25 others.
   Despite a PLO order not to use weapons, army statistics obtained
by The Associated Press show there were 12 incidents of Palestinians
using firearms against Israelis and alleged Arab collaborators from
July 9 to Aug. 9 _ more than in all of 1988.
   Overall, there also appears to be a new hard line developing.
   At an eight-day conference in Tunisia this month, Arafat's Fatah
produced a final communique reaffirming the guerrilla faction's
commitment to armed struggle. The statement contrasted with Arafat's
earlier pledges to abandon terror and accept Israel.
   Arafat also hinted to reporters in Baghdad that more violent
actions were under consideration, saying a lack of progress in the
U.S.-PLO talks could result in the uprising becoming a ``nationwide
rebellion ... and we may take another step after the rebellion.''
   The more militant mood was also evident in the latest leaflet
issued by the PLO-backed United National Leadership of the Uprising.
It advocated a greater use of knives in attacks on Israelis.
   The communique also reflected leftist views in taking an
unexpectedly strong position against Palestinians meeting with
Israeli officials such as Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
   Jamil Tarifi, a West Bank lawyer from Ramallah, left for Jordan
and skipped a planned conference with visiting U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State John Kelly after graffiti threatened his life for
earlier meeting with Shamir.
   ``Shame on Jamil Tarifi and anybody who meets with killers of our
people,'' said one slogan on a wall in Ramallah.
   Assad Saftawi of Gaza City, a Palestinian activist with close
ties to Arafat, said that despite the warning he would press ahead
with a 10-point peace proposal he recently presented to Rabin.
   ``I call on my brothers not to be quick in taking decisions
before they see the results of such meetings,'' he said in an
interview.
   Other signs of internal upheaval include leaflets accusing
prominent activists of corruption and a surge of attacks on
Palestinians who are accused of collaborating with Israel.
   The attacks, usually carried out at night by masked enforcers,
have claimed 97 lives and been criticized as harming the uprising's
non-violent image. Israeli troops have killed 540 Palestinians
during the uprising, which began Dec. 8, 1987.
   The Rev. Audeh Rantisi, former deputy mayor of Ramallah, said in
an interview that, ``It's not right to take the life of anyone,''
adding, some killings may mask ``personal rivalries.''

   The head of a leading Hollywood
video entertainment firm and his wife were slain in their mansion,
and police searched for witnesses, motives and possible links to
organized crime.
   The bodies of Jose E. Menendez, 45, and Mary Louise ``Kitty''
Menendez, 44, were discovered late Sunday by their sons in their $4
million Mediterranean-style home, police said Monday.
   Menendez was chief executive officer and chairman of the board of
LIVE Entertainment Inc., an affiliate of Carolco Pictures Inc. in
the video and music software distribution business. He also once
headed RCA@Ariola records and the U.S. rental car operations for
the Hertz Corp.
   The couple, casually dressed, had been shot repeatedly. Menendez'
body was found slumped over one end of a couch and his wife's body
was on the floor at the other end of the couch, said coroner's
investigator Craig Harvey.
   Police gave no motive in the killings and declined to reveal the
type of weapon used. Several people were questioned by police and
released.
   Investigators found no signs of a struggle or burglary. The
couple's death was placed by the coroner's office at between 8 p.m.
and 11 p.m. Sunday.
   Officers went door-to-door on the Menendez' tree-lined street,
one of Southern California's most affluent, looking for witnesses to
the first Beverly Hills homicide in more than a year.
   The Menendezes moved to the house in October 1988, property
records show. Over the years, the house had been leased for up to
$35,000 a month to celebrities including singers Elton John and
Prince, the U-2 rock band and several Arab sheiks.
   Carolco is best known for producing the ``Rambo'' films starring
Sylvester Stallone, which have been one of its major sources of
income.
   Although no motive was offered, Beverly Hills detectives called
the Los Angeles Police Department's Organized Crime Intelligence
Division, asking for any information on Menendez, the Los Angeles
Times reported today.
   A source told the Times the LAPD had no immediate information on
the executive.
   In 1988, LIVE Entertainment acquired Strawberries Records, Tapes
and CDS, a Milford, Mass.-based retail chain owned by Morris Levy, a
New York City record executive with alleged ties to organized crime,
the Times reported.
   Levy allegedly has long acted as a business front for Vincent
``The Chin'' Gigante, reputed by law enforcement officials to be an
underboss of the Genovese crime family, according to authorities and
records.
   Levy was sentenced last year in New Jersey to 10 years in federal
prison and fined $200,000 for conspiring to extort money from a
Philadelphia-area record distributor.
   Menendez was an executive vice president and board member of
Carolco, which has a 48 percent voting interest in LIVE. Carolco
finances, produces and leases motion pictures for exhibition in
domestic and foreign markets, and for later release in such media as
video and pay and free television.
   ``All of us at Carolco are shocked by the apparent murder of Jose
Menendez and his wife,'' Carolco Pictures President and CEO Peter
Hoffman said in a statement.
   In 1986, Menendez left RCA to run International Video
Entertainment (IVE), which holds the video rights to more than 1,300
titles. A year later, IVE bought an interest in Minneapolis-based
Lieberman Enterprises, which delivers video and music software to
major retailers, to create LIVE Entertainment Inc.
   Menendez was covered by a $15 million ``key man'' insurance
policy with LIVE Entertainment as the beneficiary, according to a
Securities and Exchange Commission registration statement filed this
year and obtained by the Times.

   The FBI has been called in to help investigate the
mailing of a gas bomb to the southeastern regional headquarters of
the NAACP in what is believed to have been a racially motivated
attack.
   Eight people, including a 4-month-old, were injured when the bomb
went off Monday as workers at the NAACP office opened a package that
arrived by mail earlier that morning.
   Caustic gas, ``similar to tear gas,'' spread from the office of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
through air-conditioning ducts into surrounding offices in a
two-story brick building near downtown Atlanta, said Assistant Fire
Chief Walter Campbell.
   No one was seriously hurt, according to officials at Grady
Memorial Hospital and Georgia Baptist Medical Center.
   Officers from the Postal Service, the FBI, the Atlanta police and
the Atlanta Fire Bureau arson squad were investigating the bombing,
Campbell said.
   ``We'll be looking to see what jurisdiction, if any, we've got.
... Our interest is from the point of view of civil rights,'' said
FBI Special Agent Diader Rosario.
   ``Anytime something like this would come to the NAACP office, you
have to believe it's racially motivated,'' said Democratic Rep. John
Lewis, a veteran of the civil rights movement who was speaking
nearby to a community group when he heard about the bombing.
   ``This is just a terrible experience,'' said Murlene Murray, a
staff secretary in the office. ``We've never experienced anything
like this before in the 20 years I've worked here.''
   The package arrived via Postal Service ``Priority Mail,''
Shinhoster said. It was addressed to the NAACP and not to anyone in
particular.
   The return address proved to be a law office on Peachtree Street
in downtown Atlanta. Police interviewed people at the firm, but said
they suspect the address was listed as a hoax.

   Black community leaders, citing racial
factors in legal proceedings against the nation's longest-standing
death row inmate, are urging that his life be spared.
   William Andrews, on death row nearly 15 years, had faced
execution today for his role in the torture-murders of three whites
at an Ogden stereo shop. The victims and two survivors were forced
to drink liquid drain cleaner before being shot in the head.
   The 34-year-old former airman from Jonesboro, La., won a reprieve
Saturday when a federal appellate court ordered a stay based on a
writ of habeas corpus that claimed the court showed a racial bias in
excluding a black man as a juror in Andrews' trial.
   James Gillespie Sr., president of the Ogden chapter of the NAACP
and father of the juror who was excluded, said the death sentence
reflects prevailing attitudes in Utah, which he labeled a ``racist
state.''
   Then-prosecutor Robert Newey has acknowledged that race played a
part in his decision to exclude James Gillespie Jr. as a juror.
   Defense attorneys incorporated that statement into their appeal,
but the state has countered that Andrews' trial attorney concurred
in a motion to dismiss the younger Gillespie, because he was a state
lawman at the time.
   The younger Gillespie, now an administrator in the state prison
system, has not disputed the logic behind his exclusion as a juror,
but said race had played a part in the case.
   In his writ that led to the stay by the 10th Circuit Court of
Appeal, Andrews argued that a mistrial should have been declared
during his trial when a juror found a note in a restaurant during a
lunch break saying, ``Hang the niggers.'' The juror gave the note to
the judge; its origin was never determined.
   The elder Gillespie noted that avowed white supremacist Joseph
Paul Franklin had been sentenced to life imprisonment for gunning
down two black men, Ted Fields and David Martin, at a Salt Lake City
park in 1980.
   ``No one seemed upset when Mrs. Fields and Mrs. Martin's sons
were killed,'' Gillespie said. ``That was premeditated murder.''
   He said Andrews had gotten the death sentence because, ``It's a
black person that killed a white person.''
   Franklin, convicted of two counts of first-degree murder, was
given concurrent life sentences when the jury could not agree on the
death penalty. He also was convicted in federal court and is serving
life terms for violating the victims' civil rights.
   Martin's mother, Johnnie Maye Martin, attended a service Sunday
at the Calvary Baptist Church, saying she had come to pray for
Andrews, his family and all black children because ``there is no
justice for them.''
   ``Utah is a pretty good state, yes, if you are white,'' said
Alberta Henry of the Salt Lake chapter of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People. ``William Andrews, he may
still die even after this stay. But God help Utah if he does, for
Utah will never live it down.''
   University of Utah political science professor J.D. Williams, a
civil right activist, said he did not feel race was the dominant
issue in the case.
   He noted that Andrews and his co-defendant, Pierre Dale Selby,
who was executed in 1987, together forced their bound victims to
drink caustic drain cleaner. Moreover, he said, a woman was raped
and one of the survivors had a pen kicked into his ear.
   ``Pencils, Drano, rape and murder ... shocking and indefensible
crimes,'' said Williams, who opposed capital punishment on
principle. ``It was not racism, it was heinous crime.''
   Calvary Baptist Pastor France Davis said racial attitudes in
Utah, where 92.3 percent of the 1.7 million population is white,
stem from the Mormon Church's history of barring black men from the
lay priesthood.
   It wasn't until 1978 that then-President Spencer Kimball opened
the clergy to blacks. About 70 percent of Utahns are Mormons.
   Andrews' long stay on death row stems from Utah's lengthy review
policy for capital cases. Besides Selby, the two previous executions
occurred after the criminals had abandoned the appeals process.

<HEAD>Official Historian Says Soviets Responsible for Katyn Massacre</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government historian reversed the
official view of Poland's most painful wartime memory, and blamed
the Soviet Union for the World War II massacre of Polish soliders at
Katyn.
   Jarema Maciszewski, Poland's chairman of a Polish-Soviet
commission set up to investigate ``blank spots '' in history, said
there was ``no doubt'' the Soviets were responsible, the state PAP
news service reported Monday.
   It was the first direct statement from the commission on the
subject and appeared the culmination of Poland's yearlong
reassessment of the masssacre of 15,000 Polish officers at Katyn and
two other Soviet camps.
   The official Soviet and Polish version had been that the officers
were shot by the Nazis in 1941 after Germany invaded the Soviet
Union.
   Maciszewski said a communique from the 1944 Soviet Burdenko
commission that investigated the slaying is false. He said it was
contradicted by other information, including evidence from Nuremberg
trial investigations and Red Cross representatives.
   Poland had said earlier that circumstantial evidence pointed to
Soviet guilt. But Maciszewski's conclusions published in the Aug. 19
issue of Polityka and reported by PAP, said Soviet responsibility
was definite.
   ``There is no doubt about the Burdenko commission's opinions
departing from the truth or about full responsibility of the Soviet
secret police for the Katyn crime and the deaths of the officers at
the Starobelsk and Ostashkov camps,'' PAP quoted Macizewski as
saying.
   About 4,000 officers, the cream of Polish society called up from
the reserves and interned by the Soviets shortly after the outbreak
of the war, were shot in the back of the head and dumped in mass
graves in Katyn, near the Soviet city of Smolensk.
   The fate of the remaining officers, interned at two other Soviet
camps, has never been revealed. They also are presumed to have been
executed.
   Historians in the West and most Poles have long believed the men
were killed on Stalin's orders in spring 1940.
   The Katyn massacre is considered the most vivid symbol of Soviet
atrocities against Poland during the war.
   For decades Katyn was a taboo subject in Poland and a permanent
monument to the victims was not allowed until 1985.
   The Polish-Soviet commission has reported tentative findings, but
has yet to present a final report. Polish historians have called on
the Soviet Union to open its archives to resolve all questions
surrounding the crime.

   Officials made a mistake counting votes on
a riverboat gambling initiative, it was announced Monday, and the
revised results show that only one of three counties voted in favor
of authorizing the gambling.
   Two other counties along the Mississippi Rivewr were voting
Tuesday on the measure, and four other river counties will vote next
week.
   An official canvass showed that election officials in one Clayton
County precinct reversed the ``yes'' and ``no'' votes in last week's
referendum to authorize floating casinos. When the error was
discovered, the new total showed the measure lost in the county by a
91-vote margin, said Gerald Palas, a member of the county board of
supervisors.
   Dubuque County voted in favor of the referendum. Lee and Des
Moines counties vote on the measure Tuesday.
   Iowa's riverboat gambling law allows gambling on excursion boats
beginning April 1, 1991, in counties where voters first approve it
in a referendum.
   Last week, voters in Dubuque approved the referendum by a 2-1
margin. The issue was rejected by voters in Allamakee County, and
initially, election officials in Clayton County said it was approved
by a vote of 1,122 to 1,060.
   But Palas said that those results from the Aug. 15 election
reflected a mixup in Cass Township, which first reported gambling
was approved 130-54. The canvass determined the actual vote should
have been reversed in that precinct, leaving the issue defeated
countywide by a vote of 1,046 for floating casinos to 1,137 against.
   Next week, voters in Scott, Clinton, Muscatine and Jackson
counties will vote on the proposal.

   The nation's only university institute to study
gambling has opened here as more local governments legalize what
some people still view as a vice.
   ``Some people still look at gaming as quite a ways down on the
morality list,'' said Judy Cornelius, acting associate director of
the institute. ``But the attitude toward gaming is definitely
changing as states see this as a legal way to generate revenue.''
   Ms. Cornelius' said Monday that only three states do not have
some form of legalized gambling _ Hawaii, Indiana and Utah.
   The new Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial
Gaming, which plans to offer undergraduate minor degrees, opened
July 1 at the University of Nevada-Reno.
   ``The institute is relly intended to be an umbrella organization
that will ... further the understanding of gambling's effects on
society,'' said UNR economics professor William Eadington, an
analyst of the gaming industry which provides more than half of
Nevada's funds to run state government.
   The Reno institute will focus not only on economic gaming issues,
but also will delve into ethical, moral and legal issues to discover
why people gamble and why sometimes they become addicted to risk
taking.
   ``There's so much gaming activity going on now that there needs
to be a research center where information from all over the world
can be gathered,'' Ms. Cornelius said.
   In the education area, the institute plans to start slowly by
offering non-degree courses through the UNR Division of Continuing
Education this fall for people involved in the casino industry at
middle management positions.
   Then, existing gaming and gambling-related university courses
will be consolidated into the equivalent of an undergraduate minor
with a specialization in gambling or casino management.
   ``Gaming really is big business all over the world now,'' Ms.
Cornelius said. ``Even in the Midwest where charitable gaming is
really big.''
   Voters in an Iowa county recently approved riverboat gambling and
Deadwood, S.D., has approved casino games.
   In some areas where there has been resistance to legalized
gambling, people are approving games of chance with the caveat that
the business operators also tell people how to get help if they're
addicted to gambling, Ms. Cornelius said.
   ``There's a new trend in lotteries in which a small percentage of
the money is earmarked toward treatment of pathological gambling,''
she said, adding that some lottery machines must have on them phone
numbers of gambling addiction treatment centers.
   ``It's a bit of a twist to get voters to approve gambling.''

   An Eastern Airlines flight was delayed
about 90 minutes while security officers searched for a bomb a

   No bomb was found Monday night, police said, and the passengers
were later allowed back on board the aircraft, which departed for
Atlanta.
   The DC-9 was preparing for takeoff about 7 p.m. when the pilot
cut power and directed the jetliner to a taxiway.
   The 80 passengers and crew members aboard Eastern Flight 679 were
evacuated and the plane and luggage were searched by security
officers and bomb-sniffing dogs, police Sgt. Fred Robinson said.
   Calls to Eastern Airlines' Columbus desk were not answered Monday
night.
   The bomb threat had been called into the airport control tower
and relayed to the pilot, Robinson said.
   Police had no motive or suspect in the incident, he said.

   About 8,000 gallons of gasoline spilled
while being pumped from a barge into storage tanks, forcing hundreds
of people to temporarily evacuate their homes.
   Mayor Eddie Bassitt said early today that tests revealed the
threat of explosion had passed, and 450 to 500 residents who had
been evacuated were being sent home.
   The leak occurred about 9 p.m. Monday as gasoline was being
pumped from barges into eight large holding tanks along the Kanawha
River just downstream from the mouth of the Coal River in western
West Virginia.
   ``They were pumping so many lines it's hard to tell what's
leaking. Apparently one of the lines overflowed and one of the
shutoff valves didn't work,'' said Linda Farnham of the Kanawha
County Emergency Services office.
   Kanawha County Commissioner Duke Bloom said emergency crews
brought in foam to coat the spilled gasoline, and the gasoline was
being pumped into tanker trucks.
   The evacuees were sent to St. Albans High School.
   Farnham said officials were concerned both with the threat of
explosion and the health risk posed by breathing gasoline fumes.
   ``They said it was dangerous and to get out of there. I didn't
take time to smell it,'' said Sarah E. Davis, who with her son fled
her home in the Amandaville section just west of St. Albans.
   ``I'm just thankful that we're alive and here,'' she said as she
sat at the high school.

   A streak of bad luck has Montana Lottery
officials moaning that they can't give money away.
   Lottery workers have been frustrated for the past 18 months by
the failure of any contestant in the weekly Big Spin game to hit the
jackpot.
   ``Unfortunately, the wheel of fortune has run against the
lottery,'' says Chuck Brooke, the lottery director. ``We haven't had
any big winners, and that's what the lottery needs.''
   In addition to making a lucky contestant $1 million richer, a
jackpot hit might help reverse a slump in ticket sales, which fell
50 percent in the lottery's second year.
   ``The one thing that drives ticket sales is the publicity that
goes to the winners,'' Brooke says.
   The last jackpot winner was Keith Dunn of Billings, who won
$950,000 on Feb. 17, 1988. Since then, 219 contestants have spun the
Big Spin wheel without hitting the jackpot. The wheel has 100 slots
representing various payouts.
   Entries for the Big Spin also have slumped. Only about 35,000
people enter the drawing each week now by sending in losing
instant-winner tickets, compared to about 120,000 a week during the
game's opening months two years ago, lottery spokesman Ron Duda says.
   In an effort to spread more wealth, lottery officials altered the
wheel last September. They upped the lowest prize from $1,000 to
$3,000, added new $50,000 and $100,000 slots, and created two
jackpot slots that pay $1 million each.
   The old format had one jackpot slot that began at $250,000 and
increased $25,000 each time a contestant failed to hit it. There
were four winners under the old system.
   But even with the increased odds of 50-to-1 for a jackpot winner,
none has materialized yet. The extended streak of bad luck for an
office whose phone number is 442-LUCK has become a running joke at
lottery headquarters.
   ``We'd love to have some million-dollar hits,'' Brooke says.
``That money is sitting there waiting to be won. There's nothing
else we can do with it.''
   By law, at least 45 percent of lottery revenue must be paid out
in prizes. The money sits in a state account, earns no interest for
the lottery and cannot be spent on anything but prizes.
   To make sure the wheel is operating properly, lottery officials
spin it six times before and six times after the spins by the three
weekly contestants. The wheel also must be spun 100 times after it
is moved to ensure its random nature.
   Duda says the jackpot slots have been hit several times during
the warm-up spins. In one instance, it came up twice in a row.
   The lottery's instant-winner ticket sales fell to about $12
million in the year ending June 30, down from $23 million during the
game's first year. Ticket sales of more than $1 million in May ended
a seven-month decline, and Brooke said he hopes sales will hit $18
million during the current fiscal year.

<HEAD>Prosecutors: Trafficker Implicated More Top Cuban Officials</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is investigating additional top Cuban
officials named by a drug trafficker whose revelations led to the
execution of four high-ranking members of Fidel Castro's government.
   The attorney for smuggler Reinaldo Ruiz said Ruiz had implicated
Castro and his brother Raul, the defense minister, in cocaine
trafficking.
   The case of Ruiz, sentenced Monday to 17 years in prison, also
brought testimony that former Haitian military leader Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy supported drug smugglers, Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas
Mulvihill said.
   Ruiz, 51, indicted on 27 drug counts in February 1988, has
cooperated fully with the government since his arrest last year,
Mulvihill said.
   Ruiz had faced a life sentence on the charges, but his sentence
could be reduced even further if he continues to tesfify, said U.S.
District Judge Thomas C. Scott. Ruiz must also pay a $1.1 million
fine.
   Mulvihill said Ruiz had given the names of ``four or five'' more
smuggling groups headed by leading Cuban officials, and said those
cases were under investigation.
   Ruiz's attorney, Fred Schwartz, said his client ``told the
government that both Raul and Fidel Castro are involved in drug
trafficking,'' but Mulvihill refused to confirm the two Cuban
leaders were targets of the continuing probe.
   The prosecutor acknowledged, however, that Ruiz's information
``has been pretty accurate so far.''
   Ruiz was present at a Cuban air base with Raul Castro's
bodgyguards when at one point cocaine spilled out of the cigar boxes
Ruiz used to disguise his cargo, according to the prosecutor and
defense attorney.
   The bodyguards spurned the cocaine, but said they would like any
marijuana Ruiz had available, the prosecutor said.
   In addition, a secretly made videotape of a convicted member of
Ruiz's gang, Elias Carvil, showed him telling drug pilots before his
arrest that they had no reason to fear turmoil in Haiti.
   ```It's OK to go in there because Namphy is narcotics trafficking
too _ all you have to do is pay the price,'' the prosecutor
recounted Carvil as saying. Namphy was ousted from power in
September 1988.
   Ruiz took the stand briefly, saying he wanted to make up for the
damage he had done through his drug smuggling.
   ``I am willing to testify, cooperate, to go to any kind of extent
... even on my own expense,'' Ruiz told the judge.
   Ruiz pleaded guilty in March to heading a cocaine-smuggling ring
that shipped at least 1,000 pounds of cocaine into the United State
via a Cuban air force base and other points. His son, Ruben Ruiz,
and girlfriend, Ligia Cruz, also pleaded guilty and are awaiting
sentencing.
   Ruiz, a Cuban exile, had set up a smuggling ring that handled
everything from getting Cubans out of their homeland to bringing
Puerto Rican lottery tickets to the United States.
   He eventually made contact with a cousin in the Cuban military
who introduced him to many of the officials who since have been
arrested or executed in their country.
   Fidel Castro has acknowledged that revelations from the case,
which he said matched information from Colombian sources, prompted
the investigation that led to the June arrest and execution of four
top Cuban officials, including the decorated war hero Maj. Gen.
Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez.

   The U.S. dollar lost ground against the Japanese yen
Tuesday in Tokyo while stock prices fell marginally.
   The dollar closed at 142.78 yen, down 0.57 yen from Monday's
close of 143.35 yen. After opening at 142.78 yen, it ranged between
142.70 and 142.87 yen during the day.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which gained 77.69 points Monday, shed 26.48
points, or 0.08 percent, closing at 35,114.35.
   Currency dealers said the trading remained light as many market
players are still on vacation. They also said the anticipation of
the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's open market committee meeting to be
held in Washington later Tuesday, is making traders take a ``wait
and see position.''
   The Fed committee is expected to discuss its fund rates and other
economic matters in the meeting.
   Securities dealers said most stocks were bearish in light and
directionless trading.
   A dealer at Nikko Securities Co., speaking anonymously, said a
40.97-point decline in the Dow Jones Stock Average during Monday's
New York trading discouraged institutional dealers from activity on
the market.

   Thomas Root said he won't fly again until
he knows what happened during the 800-mile flight that ended with
his crash in the Atlantic Ocean and an unexplained bullet wound in
his abdomen.
   Root, a Washington, D.C., communications attorney, was rescued
after his plane plunged into the ocean near the Bahamas July 13.
Military aircraft had been shadowing the plane after Root radioed
his controllers he felt ill, then did not respond to repeated
attempts at contact.
   Root told The Columbus Dispatch in an interview published today
he doesn't know why he passed out at 10,000 feet.
   He denied speculation that he was trying to kill himself during
the flight.
   ``It's incomprehensible to me that if I wanted to commit suicide
that I would give myself a painful but non-lethal wound in the
abdomen, and then crash my plane in the ocean, and then swim for
it,'' he said.

<DATELINE>BURLINGTON, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two counties along the Mississippi River
were voting on riverboat gambling in the second round of referendums
on the floating casinos.
   The issue passed last Tuesday in Dubuque County, and was defeated
in Allamakee and Clayton counties. Lee and Des Moines counties vote
on the measure today; four more counties will vote next week.
   Iowa's riverboat gambling law allows gambling on excursion boats
beginning April 1, 1991 in counties where voters first approve it in
a referendum.
   Next week, voters in Scott, Clinton, Muscatine and Jackson
counties will vote on the proposal. No one in Iowa's tenth
Mississippi River county, Louisa, has asked for a referendum.
   Along the Missouri River, Woodbury County supervisors last week
set a referendum for Sept. 26 and petitions were being circulated in
Mills County, but a date for a referendum hasn't been set.
   The Legislature this year voted to authorize riverboat gambling,
limiting betting to $5 per play and setting a $200 nightly limit on
losses. Boats can offer blackjack, roulette, slot machines, dice
games and video gambling.
   In Clayton County, in northeast Iowa, officials initially
announced that voters had approved last week's referendum. They
announced Monday that a review of the vote count showed the measure
had lost.
   An official canvass showed that election officials in one
precinct had reversed the ``yes'' and ``no'' votes. When the error
was discovered, the new total showed the measure lost in the county
by a 91-vote margin, said Gerald Palas, a member of the county board
of supervisors.

   An unemployed construction worker jumped into a

a ferry and blacked out.
   Felipe Diaz, 33, dove off the Manhattan-bound Staten Island ferry
at 5:15 p.m. and kept the unconscious woman afloat for ten minutes
until a Coast Guard boat arrived.
   ``Hey, she drowns, and Jesus Christ told me to save her, and that
was that,'' said Diaz.
   Asked if he was scared, he replied, ``Nah, nah.''
   The woman, 19-year-old Carol Desailes, told police she dropped a
pendant, lost her balance trying to catch it and went over the
railing.
   The ferry circled and a ferry worker threw her a life jacket.
   Diaz then jumped in the bay and held onto Desailes until the
Coast Guard pulled the two from the water.
   Desailes was in stable condition at a hospital early today.
   Diaz was treated for exposure and released.

<HEAD>Harvard Researcher Says Current War on Marijuana a Losing Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration should shift its
billion-dollar effort to curtail marijuana use toward education
because the current interdiction strategy isn't working, says a
Harvard University researcher.
   The funds poured into stemming the flow of marijuana in the
United States could easily be cut in half because ``it's pretty
clear there's nothing the federal government can do with its
enforcement efforts to reduce the abuse,'' researcher Mark A.R.
Kleiman said in an interview Monday.
   Kleiman, a lecturer at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of
Government, released a new study that urges federal officials to
move away from a broad ``war on drugs'' and instead focus on
practical solutions to the problem.
   The annual federal marijuana enforcement budget nearly doubled
between 1982 and 1988, growing from $526 million in 1988 dollars to
$968 million. But the funding has curtailed neither availability nor
abuse of the drug, Kleiman said.
   He contends the ``war on drugs'' mentality prevalent in
Washington since the early 1980s is an emotional, rather than
practical, appeal that has backfired in several ways.
   Interdiction efforts on the international level have restricted
the flow of drugs into this country, but resulted in encouraging a
wider domestic marijuana industry that produces an even more potent
form of the drug.
   ``Some consumers are literally growing it at home and domestic
production has gone from possibly 10 percent of the U.S. marijuana
market to probably a third today by weight,'' the researcher said.
   Kleiman said he based his domestic production figure on federal
drug enforcement reports. The National Narcotics Intelligence
Consumer's Committee placed the 1988 figure at about 25 percent.
   The current marijuana enforcement strategy has also encouraged
violence by giving criminal organizations an edge in the trade,
Kleiman said.
   ``The more enforcement there is, the better violence and
corruption pay,'' he wrote. ``The natural effect of ordinary drug
enforcement is to drive out the weakest drug dealers and increase
the profit of the rest.''
   Larry Cirignano, a spokesman for national drug policy coordinator
William Bennett, declined to comment on Kleiman's study, but said a
new drug strategy scheduled for unveiling this fall would target
``not just drug dealers but users.''
   Instead of pouring funding into enforcement programs, Kleiman
said the money should be directed toward educational programs that
would make marijuana use less acceptable.
   ``The best way to reduce adolescent drug abuse is to teach them
the skill of gracefully declining the offer of something they don't
want to do,'' he said.

<HEAD>Kohl Fires Party Leader in Bid to Recover Support</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl fired the
manager of his conservative Christian Democratic Union in an
apparent bid to bolster the sliding fortunes of the party before the
national election.
   Heiner Geissler told reporters at a news conference late Monday
that Kohl told him he would not be renominated at the party's
national conference, which begins Sept. 10 in Bremen.
   ``I regret this,'' said Geissler, who has been party general
secretary for 12 years. ``I think it sends the wrong political
signal.''
   Kohl planned a news conference today to discuss party issues as
well as the government's plans for responding to a flood of refugees
from East Germany.
   Like Kohl's reorganization of his 19-member Cabinet in April, the
party shakeup appears aimed at winning back voters who have been
defecting to other parties the past two years.
   The Christian Democrats fared poorly in the European Parliament
elections in June, and it lost control of the Berlin and Frankfurt
city governments in other elections this year.
   Although West Germany's economic performance has continued
strong, voters have become increasingly disenchanted with the Bonn
government's policies toward sharing of NATO defense burdens and the
steady stream of refugees and asylum seekers entering the country.
   That dissatisfaction has sent many traditional Christian Democrat
voters to the political fringes, boosting support for both the
ultra-rightist Republicans and leftist parties like the Greens.
   Public opinion polls conducted over the past few months have
repeatedly shown the Christian Democrats running a few points behind
the left-leaning Social Democrats in popularity.
   The liberal Free Democratic Party, currently aligned to Kohl's
conservative-led coalition, has also hinted recently that it may
switch allegiances before the next national elections in December
1990 if the party continues its slide at the polls.

<HEAD>Official: Diplomatic Ties with Britain Could be Restored</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Iranian official was quoted today as
saying Iran and Britain could restore diplomatic ties that were
severed during the Salman Rushdie dispute if London shows respect
for Islamic values, the state news agency reported.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
quoted Mahmoud Vaezi, deputy foreign minister for America and
Europe, as saying ``relations with Britain can be restored even
today.''
   ``But this must be conditional on the British government being
able to convince members of the Majlis (Parliament) that its
intentions are genuinely motivated and it will be willing to respect
Islamic principles and values,'' he said in an interview with the
government-supervised Tehran Times.
   The Majlis voted in March to sever ties with Britian after the
government refused to denounce the British novelist because of his
novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   The late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, claiming Rushdie had
blashphemed Islam, sentenced him to death and the Indian-born author
went into hiding with British police protection.
   While recognizing the book might offend some people, the British
government said Rushdie was excercising his right of free speech.
   Fourteen Western nations withdrew their ambassadors temporarily
from Tehran because of the death sentence.
   Vaezi said the ups-and-downs in relations with the West are
caused by its lack of concern for Islamic values, the foundation of
the Islamic Republic.
   He said ties with London could have remained strong were it not
for the ``unpardonable mistake of supporting Salman Rushdie.''
   Vaezi meanwhile linked the case of jailed Briton Roger Cooper, a
longtime resident of Iran imprisoned on spying charges, to that of
Kourosh Fouladi, an Iranian he said was serving an unjust 10-year
sentence in Britain.
   Fouladi, a former doorman at the Iranian Embassy in London, was
arrested in 1980 following a bungled car bombing attack in London.
   The only survivor of a gang of three bombers who blew themselves
up, Fouladi was jailed for 10 years in 1982.
   ``Cooper is charged with spying during the Iran-Iraq war and only
the judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran can decide on his case
based on the charges filed against him,'' Vaezi said.

   A large collection of Andy Warhol's art may find
a home in a proposed museum in Pittsburgh, where the artist grew up,
according to negotiators for the project.
   The museum would become ``the most ambitious single-artist museum
in the country,'' said Phillip M. Johnston, the director of the
Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh.
   Johnston said Monday the museum would be operated as an
independent arm of the Carnegie Museum and would consist of works
donated by the Dia Art Foundation and the Andy Warhol Foundation for
the Visual Arts, both based in New York.
   Talks have been going on for a year and a director has been
tentatively chosen, but Johnston declined to release the name or
give other details until negotiations were complete.
   Charles Wright, Dia's executive director, confirmed that
negotiations were progressing but declined to say anything about the
project.
   Warhol died in 1987 at age 58. A major retrospective of the
artist's work was shown earlier this year at the Museum of Modern
Art in New York City.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle said the United States
has an obligation to continue humanitarian aid to the Contras until
democratic conditions exist in Nicaragua.
   Quayle said Monday the aid should continue despite a plan
approved by Central American presidents to dismantle the Contras by
Dec. 5.
   ``The bottom line is that they should not be forced to go back to
Nicaragua until it is safe for them to do so and until conditions
have been established for their normal reintegration into Nicaraguan
society,'' the vice president said.
   Quayle's comments, in a speech before the annual Veterans of
Foreign Wars convention, represented an elaboration of the
administrations' position that the Central American presidents' plan
was premature.
   The Contras, backed by the United States since 1981, have been
fighting to oust Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government and are
now mostly camped along the Honduran border with Nicarague.
   The vice president said it is ``indisputable that safe and
democratic conditions do not exist in Nicaragua today, and until
they do exist, it will remain a moral obligation of the United
States to continue its humanitarian assistance to those people.''
   Members of Congress from both parties have said that the Dec. 5
demobilization deadline could set the stage for a confrontation
between the administration and Congress because the humanitarian aid
program set up for the Contras is subject to congressional review
and could be halted on Nov. 30.
   Quayle aligned himself with conservatives who maintain that the
Contras should remain intact as a fighting force until after the
leftist Sandinista government holds elections on Feb. 25, 1990.
   ``We believe that maintenance of the resistance as a cohesive
force provides a unique incentive to the Sandinistas to live up to
their pledge to allow free elections,'' he said.
   The plan signed by the presidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador,
Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala does not mention the mechanics
for disarming the rebels. It calls for an international commission
to aid the Contras in resettling in their homeland or a third
country. Honduras has said the rebels must leave their base camps
near the Nicaraguan border.
   Quayle challenged the Sandinistas to ``guarantee the integrity''
of the February election by allowing for a non-government television
station, permitting voting by exiles and lifting all restrictions on
foreign election observers.
   The vice president, who visited several Central American
countries in June, also called on Nicaragua, Cuba and the Soviet
Union to stop arming leftist guerrillas in El Salvador.
   Quayle was given a polite but restrained reception by the
veterans, some of whom had complained about his appearance because
of the controversy during last year's campaign over his National
Guard service. The speech was interrupted only twice by applause,
though most of the delegates rose to applaud when the speech was
over.
   Quayle interrupted his vacation and flew to Las Vegas from the
ranch of Sen. Malcom Wallop of Wyoming. He was to resume his
vacation at a family compound on the Colorado River in Arizona.

<HEAD>Pacific Telesis Settlement Raises Hope in Other Phone Strikes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Tensions remained after the settlement of a telephone strike in
California and Nevada, while vandalism and demonstrations mounted in
a strike in the Northeast.
   Elsewhere, there was hope the Pacific Telesis agreement would
give new impetus to resolve strikes in the Midwest and mid-Atlantic
states.
   About 42,000 strikers returned to work Monday at San
Francisco-based Pacific Telesis after negotiators reached agreement
with the Communications Workers of America over the weekend on a
pact that will raise salaries by 11 percent over three years. The
agreement is scheduled for a ratification vote by Sept. 22.
   But hard feelings remained among those who went on strike and
those who stayed on the job.
   ``They're not talking to us,'' said one directory assistance
operator who had crossed the picket lines because he couldn't afford
to strike. ``I'm a very mild-mannered person. I just ignore them.''
   More vandalism was reported in the strike against NYNEX, which
serves New York and the Northeast. A judge in Albany, N.Y., issued a
temporary injunction ordering strikers not to engage in mass
picketing or interfere with operations at New York Telephone, a
NYNEX subsidiary.
   There were at least 13 incidents of vandalism to New York
Telephone lines last weekend, causing phone service outages for more
than 4,000 customers, company spokesman Peter Muller said.
   In Indianapolis, CWA spokesman L. Keith Dooley said he thought
the Pacific Telesis contract could serve as a guide for negotiations
between the union and Ameritech, which serves five Midwestern states.
   Both CWA and Ameritech officials said they were willing to go
back to the bargaining table, although neither side expressed a
willingness to initiate new talks.
   There also were hopeful signs in Philadelphia, where negotiations
continued between workers and management at Bell Atlantic, which
covers the mid-Atlantic states and Washington, D.C.
   Mary O'Hara, an adminstrative assistant for the CWA, said union
officials ``have still got hope'' of resolving the issues with Bell
Atlantic by midnight Tuesday. Both sides agreed to the deadline.
   The three continuing strikes involve more than 150,000 workers.
   In Albany, Judge Lawrence Kahn issued a restraining order that
instructs the CWA to have no more than 10 pickets at an entrance to
a New York Telephone building. In addition, pickets must remain at
least 15 feet away from company vehicles and employees and cannot
vandalize company equipment, he said.
   But striking union members said they had been advised by their
attorneys that Kahn had no jurisdiction over the matter and that
they could carry on with their picketing as usual.
   ``Essentially it means nothing,'' said William Sullivan,
president of Local 1126 in Utica, N.Y.
   In Providence, R.I., a man was arrested for disorderly conduct in
a demonstration outside a NYNEX building as police escorted about
200 management employees to their jobs.

   Dozens of people threw rocks at police
and passing cars after rumors spread that a police dog bit a man
while he was being arrested on drug charges.
   Monday's disturbance took place in a mostly black neighborhood
where protests broke out for more than a week earlier this year
after the death of a black man in police custody.
   The latest incident lasted about 45 minutes, and produced no
injuries and no arrests, police said.
   The outcry began after members of the county prosecutor's
fugitive unit saw Robert J. King Jr., 21, on a street. King, who is
black, was being sought for failure to appear in court to face
charges of cocaine possession, police said.
   Officers using dogs tracked down King in nearby woods.
   King resisted and kicked one of the arresting officers, Mayor
David Manahan said. The officer's dog nipped King on the buttocks,
but did not break the skin, he said.
   A crowd of about 50 people, many of them teen-agers, confronted
the officers as they led King to a patrol car.
   King yelled to the crowd that the dog had bit him, police said,
and some residents also said they had seen a police dog bite him.
   Police said some in the crowd then began shouting and throwing
rocks. Within minutes, the crowd swelled to at least 200 people.
   ``They were saying things like `No more Tony Jackson,'''
Patrolman Jim Lonergan said. ``I get the feeling a lot of
frustration was being vented.''
   John A. ``Tony'' Jackson, who was wanted by police on a traffic
warrant, collapsed and died in January after officers chased and
arrested him in the same neighborhood.
   His death sparked several days of demonstrations in the town by
protesters who alleged policy brutality. There was no violence
during those protests.
   Dr. Ernest E. Tucker, Morris County medical examiner, ruled
Jackson died from heart failure brought on by cocaine use.
   Thirty officers from five police departments answered a call for
help from Morristown police during the rock-throwing, Lt. Pete
Demnitz said. The crowd also threw rocks and bottles at cars on
several thoroughfares near a low-income housing project in the
neighborhood, officials said.
   No one was injured in the incident, but one officer from a
neighboring police department broke his leg in a car accident as
drove to the disturbance, Demnitz said.
   Officer James Mabin, reading from a news release, said King had
suffered scratches running through the woods and was taken to
Morristown Memorial Hospital and given a tetanus shot.
   Manahan said King at first said he had not been bitten by the
dog, then said he had. As rumors spread through the neighborhood,
officials allowed community leaders to talk with King at the county
jail to satisfy themselves he had not been mistreated, Manahan said.

<HEAD>FAA Issues Directive To Improve Fire Safety on Certain Aircraft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA SHUCHMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered
airlines to tighten fire safety measures on many aircraft after
studying the 1987 crash of a South Africa Airways Boeing 747 that
caught fire in the air.
   In a directive made public on Monday, the FAA said the
operational and equipment changes were ordered to avoid ``an
uncontrolled cargo fire that could cause systems and structural
damage, leading to the loss of the airplane.''
   The plane models affected by the Aug. 10 directive include
certain Boeing 707s, 727s, 737s, 747s and 757s, and McDonnell
Douglas DC-8s, DC-9s _ including MD-80s _ and DC-10s. Approximately
40 airplanes currently operated by U.S. carriers are affected, the
FAA said.
   The FAA also said there are about 278 Boeing planes and 124
McDonnell Douglas planes affected worldwide. Only U.S. carriers are
required to follow FAA rules, although foreign carriers usually do.
   The aircraft affected by the FAA ruling are equipped with Class B
cargo compartments, located on the main deck which also carries
passengers.
   The planes are designed so that the same area of the aircraft can
be used for passengers, cargo or both, said Dick Meyer, an FAA
spokesman in Seattle.
   On these planes, crew members are responsible for walking back to
the cargo compartment and extinguishing any fires, KIRO-TV in
Seattle reported. The South Africa Airways jet that crashed into the
Indian Ocean on November 28, 1987, killing 159 people, had a Class B
cargo compartment.
   ``Although no formal findings have been issued by the foreign
authority having jurisdiction over the accident investigation, there
is firm evidence that an inflight fire occurred in a Class B cargo
compartment, which contributed to the loss of the airplane,'' the
FAA said.
   The FAA presented two options to improve fire safety aboard the
aircraft. The planes can be refitted with Class C cargo compartments
which would be located on a different deck from passengers,
self-contained and better equipped to handle and control a fire. The
FAA noted that there are no known cases of aircraft lost due to fire
in Class C cargo compartments.
   A second option would require design changes, including
installation of smoke or fire detection and fire extinguishing
systems, and having aboard an individual ``trained to fight cargo
fires,'' the directive said.
   The agency estimated that retooling to Class C cargo departments
could take three years after the ruling goes into effect Sept. 25.
The alternative design changes could be accomplished in one year.
   The cost of converting a Class B cargo compartment to Class C
would be approximately $2.5 million for each wide body airplane and
about $1 million for a standard body, the FAA estimated. The costs
of the alternative design changes were estimated at $800,000 for
each standard body plane and $2.2 million for each wide body.
   The ruling goes into effect Sept. 25.

<HEAD>Solarz Calls for International `Insurance Policy' for Hong Kong</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. representative today called for an
international ``insurance policy'' under which many Hong Kong
residents wary about Chinese rule that begins in 1997 could quickly
escape.
   Stephen J. Solarz, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the
House Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, said such a
multilateral program involving the United States, Britain, Canada
and other countries would help restore confidence among Hong Kong
people.
   The 5.7 million people of this British colony have long been
concerned about what will happen to Hong Kong when it reverts to
Communist China in eight years. Fears over the future increased
after the Chinese military quashed the pro-democracy movement in
Beijing in June.
   Solarz said he envisioned a program under which Hong Kong people
could move permanently to a foreign country without first meeting
existing residency requirements. He said perhaps several hundred
thousand local people could meet qualifying criteria set by the host
countries for the program.
   Hong Kong residents who qualify for the program would have ``the
confidence to remain here, where I think most of them would like to
stay, knowing that if worse came to worse they would have the
opportunity to relocate elsewhere,'' Solarz told a news conference.
   He said such a program might ``give the authorities in Beijing an
even greater incentive to conduct themselves ... in a way that is
sensitive to the concerns of the people in Hong Kong, knowing ...
that if they botch it all up when they arrive in 1997 a lot of the
people who make Hong Kong go would no longer be around.''
   Solarz said he would discuss the issue, which he described as ``a
kind of multilateral immigration insurance policy,'' with the Bush
administration when he returns to Washington and that he might hold
hearings. He said the support of Britain would be crucial.
   London has refused to grant most Hong Kong residents the right to
live in Britain but has spoken of an international relief effort if
the situation deteriorates in the territory.
   Tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents have besieged local
consulates in bids to emigrate before the Chinese take over.
   Solarz also said the manner in which Hong Kong deals with its
rapidly expanding population of Vietnamese boat people will help
determine the willingness of the international community to assist
Hong Kong people.
   More than 50,000 Vietnamese who fled their Communist homeland by
boat for this colony are now languishing in crowded Hong Kong camps.
   Hong Kong continues to offer temporary refuge to all arriving
Vietnamese, despite calls by many residents to scrap the policy. The
government has started a screening policy, however, under which
Vietnamese who cannot prove they fled persecution will be forcibly
sent back to their homeland once Hanoi agrees.
   But Solarz said, ``It cannot be in the interest of Hong Kong if
people are en masse forced to return'' to Vietnam. He suggested boat
people who are determined not eligible for refugee status be given
several months to volunteer to return home.

<HEAD>370 Detained as Police Break up Anniversary Protests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 370 people, including dozens
of foreigners, were taken into custody during protests marking the
21st anniversary of the invasion of Czechoslovakia, a newspaper
reported today.
   Authorities blamed foreign media and ``provocateurs'' for
Monday's demonstrations for more freedom and the withdrawal of
Soviet troops who rolled in to crush Communist reform on Aug. 21,
1968.
   At least three protests were dispersed by baton-wielding police,
and several people were beaten. However, the Communist Party daily
Rude Pravo reported that there were no injuries.
   The daily quoted an Interior Ministry official, Josef Dvorak, as
saying 320 Czechoslovak citizens were detained as well as 50
foreigners. It did not say where they were from. Officials earlier
declined to give any specific figures or to elaborate.
   Czechoslovak activists said late Monday at least four Hungarians
were among those arrested. A Polish journalist said he was told by
Polish diplomats that ``several'' Poles were also detained.
   The nation's entrenched leaders, installed by Moscow after 1968
but now under mounting pressure to introduce reform, blamed what the
government news agency CTK called foreign ``provocateurs'' from
Italy, Hungary and Poland for the protest and said they would be
punished under valid Czechoslovak laws.
   Rude Pravo reiterated those accusations and also accused Western
news agencies and other media of inciting protest by reporting plans
for mass demonstrations before they happened.
   The busloads of riot police sent in to quell the protests were
seen leaving the capital today.
   The demonstrations marked the invasion led by the Soviets and
joined by all Warsaw Pact nations except Romania, which ended the
``Prague Spring'' reforms begun by former Communist Party leader
Alexander Dubcek.
   In the protests, at least 4,000 people marched round the city for
hours chanting calls for freedom and the withdrawal of Soviet troops
and shouting to police ``Let our brothers go!'' each time arrests
were made by hundreds of helmeted riot police.
   The show of force contrasted with reforms under way in Poland,
Hungary and the Soviet Union, which have encouraged many
Czechoslovaks to demand similar changes.
   Hungarian government television on Monday broadcast interviews
with former leaders who introduced the reforms of Prague Spring,
interspersed with footage of burning tanks and of other emotional
memories of the invasion.
   Other clips during the 30-minute broadcast showed clashes between
Czechoslovak riot police and protesters.
   In a previously unshown interview, former Deputy Premier Ota Sik,
who fled to Switzerland after the invasion, said the present
Czechoslovak leadership is ``dancing on a thin rope. ... it is
really hoping that (Soviet President Mikhail S.) Gorbachev is going
to fall and that it can survive that long.''
   The Hungarian Communist Party and government each strongly
disassociated themselves last week from the 1968 invasion, with
Premier Miklos Nemeth saying Sunday that his government condemns
Hungary's participation in the invasion.
   The Polish Parliament stung Czechoslovak leaders with a strongly
worded resolution last week condemning the invasion as a violation
of international law.
   The Soviet Union, the traditional role model for Czechoslovakia's
Communists, was more cautious. Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri A.
Gremitskykh made clear Monday, however, that the 1968 invasion could
be seen only in the context of the times.
   East Germany, which has also resisted reforms, was the only one
of Czechoslovakia's Warsaw Pact allies to come out with a clear
statement supporting the invasion as a necessary move to thwart
counterrevolution in Czechoslovakia.

   Troops today fatally shot a Palestinian woman in
the occupied Gaza Strip and residents in a West Bank refugee camp
found the body of a youth shot in the chest, Arab reports said.
   A 14-year-old Palestinian girl also died today of wounds suffered
in a clash with soldiers last week, hospital officials said. Her
funeral in the Al Askar refugee camp reportedly sparked a clash with
troops after youths covered her body with the outlawed Palestinian
flag and threw stones at soldiers.
   The army said it was checking the three reported deaths.
   A senior army officer was sent to investigate reports that a
youth was found dead from a chest wound at the West Bank's Al-Amari
refugee camp, near Ramallah.
   It was the second mysterious killing in the area north of
Jerusalem in a week. On Friday, a shepherd found the body of a
Palestinian-American boy who had been shot in the chest at close
range in El-Bireh, adjacent to Ramallah.
   In the Gaza Strip, doctors at Ahli hospital in Gaza City said
Maha Awad Abu Hadaf, 20, died after she was shot in the head with a
rubber-coated metal ball of the type used by the army to disperse
riots.
   Arab witnesses in Deir El-Balah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip
said Ms. Hadaf was hit by a stray shot. They said she was shopping
in the camp market when a clash erupted nearby between
stone-throwing youths and Israeli troops.
   Meanwhile, doctors at Ramallah hospital said Najla Aadel El-Nadi,
14, died of a bullet wound to the head after being shot by soldiers
during a protest in the Askar refugee camp near Nablus a week ago.
   At least 545 Palestinians have been killed by Israel troops or
Jewish settlers in the 20-month uprising against Israeli rule in the
occupied territories. Thirty-eight Israelis have also been killed.
   In the West Bank, residents in the Al-Amari camp told Arab
reporters they found the body of Nasser Khalil Shahin Abu Katrina,
17, with bullet wound to his upper torso.
   An army spokeswoman said the army viewed the reports as ``very
serious'' and sent a senior officer to investigate.
   The residents said troops opened fire during clashes in the camp
Monday night. The army spokesman, who is not identified by name
under military regulations, said he could not confirm any clashes
occurred.
   Soldiers put the camp under curfew this morning, ordering
residents into their homes and barring outsiders from entering.
   After a similar death last week, the army exhumed the body of a
14-year-old Palestinian-American, Amjad Jibril Tawil, whose family
said they believed the boy was in army custody before he was found
dead of a gunshot wound.
   After an investigation and autopsy the army said it determined
that Tawil had not been shot by security forces, based on movements
of troops in the Ramallah area.
   However, the Jerusalem Post daily today quoted an informed
security source as saying the army's findings ``did not rule out a
killing during security forces operations, they do not exclude
independent action by an individual soldier, security operative,
settler or Arab assailant.''
   The U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv asked Israel to investigate the
death of the youth, who was born in Denver, and lived for a time in
Miami. He returned to his family's hometown of El-Bireh in 1983.
   Gil Sherman, a spokesman for the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem,
said Israeli authorities agreed to turn over results of the autopsy
to U.S. officials and to allow the family to have an independent
pathologist examine the corpse.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Backs Tanker-Free Zones As Oil Industry Bickers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK REYNA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   OPA-LOCKA, Fla. (AP) _ U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Paul Yost
has agreed to support a proposed ten-mile tanker-free zone off
Florida's coast, but the plan quickly drew criticism from the oil
industry.
   Gov. Bob Martinez won Yost's backing for his plan to shift major
shipping lanes to 10 nautical miles from the coastal reefs after the
two officials flew down the coast to the Florida Keys on Monday.
   ``All we can do to prevent a catastrophe in Florida needs to be
done,'' Martinez said. ``Establishing a tanker-free zone would
create a buffer between Florida's coast and tanker traffic, which
would provide additional response time to deal with any oil spills.''
   Yost said the Coast Guard would seek federal and international
backing for the plan, and agreed to study Coast Guard participation
in a major oil-spill drill with Florida authorities within the next
12 months.
   But Ken Leonard, transportation director for the American
Petroleum Institute, said the plan has ``significant problems that
need to be worked out'' and would require lengthy international
negotiations.
   Leonard also said the proposal could make shipping more dangerous
by forcing southbound tankers into the lane normally used by
northbound tankers.
   Shipping lanes currently pass as close as two miles from shore at
some points along Florida's coast, though both Martinez and Yost
noted that most fully laden tankers heading north normally take
advantage of strong Gulf Stream currents farther out to sea.
   More than 5,000 ships pass in and out of the Gulf of Mexico
through the Florida Straits each year, carrying ``tens of billions''
of gallons of petroleum products, the governor's office said.
   Vessels entering Florida ports carry an estimated 12 billion
gallons of petroleum products each year. Most of it goes to Port
Everglades near Fort Lauderdale _ the nation's second largest port
for oil-tanker traffic.
   While the United States and many other nations support a 12-mile
international limit, Yost said international support for the
proposed change would require lobbying at the International Maritime
Organization, which oversees shipping worldwide.
   Yost cautioned that it could take years to get other nations to
agree to the move and to overcome expected opposition from the
shipping industry.
   Martinez agreed.
   ``This is not something that can be changed overnight,'' the
governor said. ``Ships will have to slow their speed, travel farther
and use more fuel. So we expect that will figure in the industry
view.''
   Yost said he found the proposal especially important since the
tanker Exxon Valdez hit a reef in Alaska and spilled about 11
million gallons of crude into the pristine waters of Prince William
Sound in March.

   Kandu, the giant killer whale that gave birth
before thousands of people last fall, was killed when she collided
with another killer whale during a performance at Sea World, park
officials said.
   Kandu, who weighed about 6,000 pounds, and Corky, who weighs
about 8,000 pounds, were starting their 4 p.m. show in the
performing tank at Shamu Stadium when the accident occurred, Sea
World officials said.
   The show was canceled and several thousand visitors who witnessed
the bloody accident were escorted out of the stadium. Park officials
said it's uncertain when the popular whale shows would resume.
   ``It's very obvious to you, as it is to us, that (Kandu) is
bleeding,'' the announcer at Shamu Stadium told the audience.
``We're not really sure what happened ... We want to see if we can
get the whales calmed down.''
   Park veterinarians and animal-care staff were preparing to
perform an autopsy on Kandu, who gave birth to Baby Shamu in the
same stadium last September.
   Corky, who apparently was not injured, completed part of a
shortened performance before the audience was led away, witnesses
said.
   ``The two adult whales were coming into the show pen when it
seemed like they collided,'' said Jim Barnes, who was at the show
while on vacation from Stansbury Park, Utah.
   ``They got the mother whale into about six inches of water _ the
baby was laying right there next to her _ and the blood was really
bad,'' he said.
   Gary Gregg told KFMB-TV he saw the accident from a high seat in
the back of the stadium.
   ``The two large whales apparently collided at a high rate of
speed, about 35 to 40 mph,'' he said.
   ``I did see a tail section come out of the water and the whales
did a complete circle, then when the mother came out she spewed a
large amount of blood from her blowhole,'' he said.
   Corky is about 25 years old and 20 feet long. Kandu was about 14
years old and measured 17{ feet, said a Sea World spokeswoman, who
asked that her name not be used.

   Juan Luis Merced takes his message
about AIDS to park benches, gay bars, soup kitchens and crack houses.
   He goes door to door in mostly Hispanic neighborhoods handing out
fliers about where to go for information and testing for El Sida _
AIDS in Spanish.
   As the AIDS virus seeps into the nation's smaller cities, there
is a growing need for people to take AIDS education to those who
need it most: intravenous drug users, minorities, the homeless, the
poor.
   ``Those people are the ones who are missed through the more
traditional modes of health education,'' says Imani Thompson, a
health education specialist for the national Centers for Disease
Control in Altanta. ``It makes sense that people in smaller
communities are trying to figure out methods to deal with this
because this problem is everywhere.''
   The tests here are conducted at the Heartside Clinic, which began
the AIDS program in May with state funding.
   The clinic is located in a tiny storefront in the heart of the
city's ``skid row,'' which attracts a large percentage of the city's
transient population, drug and substance abusers and prostitutes.
   Of those coming to the clinic, about 80 percent are considered at
high risk of contracting AIDS. Of about 80 tests conducted since
May, 14 people have tested positive.
   Outside God's Kitchen, the city's biggest soup kitchen, Merced
greets many of the dozens of men and women who form a line halfway
down the block for a free meal.
   ``I try to be a friend first and get their trust,'' says the
29-year-old Merced. ``They know me as the AIDS man. And that's OK.''
   Merced, a native of Puerto Rico, has been successful in getting
indigent members of the city's Hispanic community into the clinic
for free testing.
   ``We've been flooded since we got someone who can break the
language barrier,'' says project director Pat O'Connor. ``That's not
easy to find in this part of the country.''
   For those who test positive for the HIV virus, counselors
construct a ``life plan,'' arranging for medical care, housing and
food.
   ``This is such a disenfranchised group of people, you can't tell
them that they'll have to go to one place to fill out a form, go to
another halfway across town to get their medical care and another to
get food. ... The next time you'll see them, they'll be in the
emergency room,'' O'Connor says.
   In the beginning, some people questioned whether such a program
was needed in this conservative western Michigan city of 180,000,
said Dr. David Baumgartner, medical director of the program.
   ``There was and continues to be a tremendous amount of denial in
this community that HIV is a problem,'' Baumgartner said. ``But it's
like a ball rolling downhill, gaining momentum. As word gets out, we
keep seeing more and more people coming in.''
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   As of July 31, 1989, the federal Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta had recorded a cumulative total of 102,621 cases of AIDS in
the United States, with 59,391 deaths.
   CDC estimates that 1 million to 1.5 million Americans have
already been infected with the AIDS virus, and of that total, 20 to
30 percent will develop AIDS by the end of 1991.

<HEAD>Dingo-Baby Couple Still Fighting for Compensation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lindy Chamberlain, the mother in
Australia's dingo-baby case, says she is owed millions of dollars in
compensation promised nearly a year after she was found innocent of
charges she killed her infant daughter.
   Mrs. Chamberlain, who claims her 6-week-old daughter was snatched
by a dingo, a native Australian wild dog, while on a camping trip in
the Outback, says the notoriety has left her broke and prevented her
family from living a normal life.
   Mrs. Chamberlain, 41, who in the past has resented her trial by
media, called a news conference with selected journalists Monday to
generate publicity to force the Northern Territory government, which
prosecuted her and later pardoned her, to pay compensation for the
3{ years she spent in jail.
   Her ordeal, regarded as one of the miscarriages of justice in
Australian legal history, and her fight for compensation have been
front-page stories for years in Australian newspapers.
   But despite eight best-sellers about the case, Mrs. Chamberlain
claimed she had not received much money. She also said money she
received from the 1988 movie ``A Cry In The Dark,'' in which Meryl
Streep played her role, covered little more than her expenses.
   Husband Michael, 45, a former pastor with the Seventh Day
Adventist Church, said he eked out a living chopping firewood and
selling it for $26 a trailer load. Mrs. Chamberlain said she could
not afford to buy new shoes for her three school-age children.
   ``People think a couple so famous should be rich,'' she said.
``Our anonymity has been blasted; we can't live a normal life. You
can't plan for the future because you don't know what that future
is.''
   The family's saga has captivated the Australian public since
1980, when Mrs. Chamberlain claimed a dingo killed her daughter
Azaria in the Outback.
   Mrs. Chamberlain was prosecuted for murder by the Northern
Territory government but was released following the discovery of
vital new evidence while a Royal Commission, the highest form of
investigation available, reviewed the case.
   Mrs. Chamberlain was finally pardoned last November. The
Chamberlains have refused to reveal the amount of compensation they
were promised, but a figure leaked to the media by the Northern
Territory government put it at around $3 million.
   Officials for the Northern Territory government could not be
reached for comment today or Monday.
   ``Maybe an apology is a little hard to swallow and let's face it,
compensation is an apology,'' Mrs. Chamberlain said.
   The couple said they owe about $1 million in legal costs, mostly
to the Seventh Day Adventist Church, which supported them through
their court battles.

   A West German and a relative of the former king of
Afghanistan have been charged with plotting to ship a computer to
the Soviet Union in violation of U.S. export restrictions.
   Egbert Parthesuis, 46, and Abdul Aziz Ahmad, 40, were ordered
held without bail following their arrest Monday. Ahmad was
identified in court papers as a nephew of Mohammad Zahir Shah,
deposed as king of Afghanistan in a 1973 coup.
   The pair were scheduled to appear before U.S. Magistrate Morton
Sitver for a bail hearing Thursday.
   The Customs Service said its undercover agents set up an export
company as part of an eight-month investigation to crack a ring
allegedly intending to ship sophisticated military data-processing
equipment to Soviet bloc nations.
   Parthesuis, Ahmad and Hady Azimi, believed to be Ahmad's cousin
living in West Germany, conspired to purchase and export a Digital
Equipment VAX 8820 computer, customs spokesman Charles Conroy said.
Government regulations bar the export of that type of computer to
Soviet-bloc nations, officials said.
   Agents allowed Parthesuis and Ahmad to buy a relatively
unsophisticated IBM computer with military applications and export
it to West Germany, Customs agent Thomas McDermott said.
   At the time of that $28,000 purchase, the two allegedly put down
a deposit on the VAX 882, he said.
   ``Then last Thursday they came forward with the balance of the
$596,000,'' McDermott said.
   Parthesuis allegedly also gave agents a list of other computers,
antennas and related equipment he intended to buy, officials said.
The equipment was to be flown to London, then trucked to Budapest,
Hungary, for a flight to Moscow or Leningrad, they added.
   Customs officials are working with West German police in an
attempt to arrest Azimi, officials said.
   Parthesuis was in the United States on a visitor's visa, and
Ahmad was a resident alien living in Alexandria, Va., officials said.
   Parthesuis and Ahmad were charged in U.S. District Court with
violating the 4-year-old Arms Export Control Act as well as with
conspiracy and money laundering. If convicted on all counts, they
could each receive up to 35 years in prison and a $2.5 million fine,
officials said.

   A dating service secretly recorded
its clients as they disclosed the intimate details of their love
lives, according to a lawsuit.
   The complaint filed by Kathleen Nunes, a three-year employee of
Great Expectations Inc., alleged the service taped its clients as
they talked about past romances, and used the recordings in sales
pitches.
   ``It was an appalling situation that my client routinely
protested,'' said Nunes' attorney, Kathy Mount. ``People would be
baring their souls in an intimate way.''
   Nunes, 32, claims she was fired as a saleswoman last September
when she refused to cooperate in the tapings. She filed a complaint
last month seeking an undisclosed amount of damages from the company
in Walnut Creek, about 20 miles east of San Francisco.
   California law prohibits the taping of private conversations
without the consent of the people involved.

were found in a village northeast of the capital at the spot where
Sinhalese radicals ambushed an army convoy, sources said today.
   Also today, military officials said Sinhalese radicals killed at
least 20 relatives of police and army officers, and Indian officials
said their forces killed five Tamil rebels.
   The 18 bodies, all with gunshot wounds, were found in a roadside
crater at Mahawehera, 85 miles from Colombo, according to the
sources who spoke on condition they were not identified further.
   The crater was formed when Sinhalese radicals detonated
explosives under a passing Sri Lankan army patrol Sunday, killing at
least five soldiers and a civilian driver.
   The sources said the 18 were suspected radicals who were killed
in revenge for Sunday's attack. Government officials denied
knowledge of any retaliatory violence in Mahawehera. However, in the
past, senior government officials said privately that members of the
security forces have committed ``excesses'' in efforts to halt the
radicals' campaign of assassination and terror.
   Sinhalese radicals oppose the Sinhalese-dominated government's
agreement to grant limited autonomy to Tamils in the north and east.
Most Tamils are Hindu and say they are discriminated against by the
Buddhist Sinhalese majority.
   The killings today and Monday of 20 family members of officers
came after radicals threatened to kill the relatives of officers who
refused to resign by last Sunday, said military officials, who
cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   In Colombo, radicals hurled a bomb into a police jeep in the
northern suburb of Maradana, they said. Six policemen were injured.
   At least 4,000 people have been killed since ultranationalist
Sinhalese launched an anti-government campaign in July 1987, when
the government agreed to a peace plan with the Tamils. The radicals
say a peace plan aimed at ending the rebellion gave too many
concessions to the Tamils.
   They also say the deployment of Indian soldiers in the
Tamil-dominated north and east to enforce the plan compromises Sri
Lanka's sovereignity.
   A statement from the Indian High Commission or embassy said its
soldiers Monday killed five Tamil rebels belonging to a group that
rejected the 1987 plan. India sponsored the plan because of the
sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils for their Sri Lankan
brethren but got bogged down in fighting rebels who renounced it.
   At least 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have
been killed since Tamils launched their separatist war in 1983,
complaining of discrimination by the Sinhalese majority.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
Sinhalese make up 75 percent.

<HEAD>Syrian-Christian Clashes Follow Aoun's Peace Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clashes raged overnight between Syrian and
Christian forces in Beirut, the central mountains and north Lebanon
despite a peace offer by Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun,
police said today.
   Three people were killed and 47 were wounded in the dusk-to-dawn
clashes with howitzers, multi-barreled rocket launchers, mortars,
tank cannons and machine guns, the police said.
   By police count, 788 people have been killed and 2,187 wounded
since March 8, when the current round of violence broke out pitting
Aoun's 20,000 mainly Christian troops against 40,000 Syrian soldiers
and allied local forces.
   The ``Operations Room'' of Syrian-backed leftist factions said in
a statement that its gunners opened fire on six ships in Lebanese
territorial waters and prevented them from docking at Christian
ports.
   The command claimed its gunners ``scored direct hits on the lead
ship, forcing the whole group to sail away.''
   A spokesman for Aoun's command, speaking on condition of
anonymity, described the claims as ``baseless.''
   The Christian enclave northeast of Beirut has been under siege by
Syrian and allied forces for more than five months with the declared
objective of preventing Aoun from receiving Iraqi-supplied war
material by sea.
   The Aoun spokesman also said Syria had provided its leftist and
Moslem allies with 130mm Soviet-designed howitzer guns, capable of
hitting targets within a 15-mile range.
   But Syria's allies ``do not have the computerized radar equipment
needed to detect mobile maritime targets, determine their speed and
calculate the target data,'' the spokesman said.
   Moslem security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Syrians also were sending additional tanks, howitzers and
mortars to the 22,000-strong Moslem army units of Maj. Gen. Sami
Khatib as well as Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive
Socialist Party militia.
   One source said the Syrians ``have been flooding their allies
with weapons and ammunition for more than a week now. It seems they
are preparing them for a major battle with Aoun.''
   John McCarthy, the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, told reporters
after a 45-minute meeting with Aoun that, ``There's obviously no
military solution to the problem for Lebanon.''
   McCarthy said the purpose of his meeting with Aoun was to
``emphasize that the military confrontation is not taking us
anywhere.'' He also said Washington favors a cease-fire.
   Also today, acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who
heads the Syrian-backed Cabinet vying for power with Aoun's, refuted
the Maronite general's offer Monday for negotiations.
   ``It is a minefield. Any response to it is highly unlikely,''
Hoss said in a statement broadcast by Voice of the People radio.
   Syria did not comment on the offer and Jumblatt described it as
``a trick to allow Aoun a breathing spell to re-arm and marshall his
forces.''
   Aoun had declared a ``war of liberation'' against the Syrian
troops in Lebanon, charging the Damascus government has betrayed its
1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab league by supporting Moslems
against Christians in the 14-year-old civil war.
   Two civilians were wounded by Israeli shelling of villages in
southeastern Lebanon, known to be strongholds for pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem extremists, police reported today.
   They said at least 10 houses were damaged in overnight
bombardment that hit the villages of Yohmor, Sohmor, Zillaya, Kilia,
Ein el-Tineh and Maydoun outside the zone Israeli troops and allied
militiamen control in south Lebanon.
   In Paris meanwhile Defense Ministry sources said a anti-submarine
frigate and an oil supply ship are joining six other French naval
ships off the Lebanese coast.
   The Meuse left the French port of Toulon early today, maritime
sources there said. The Jean de Vienne left France over the weekend,
according to the Defense Ministry.
   French officials have denied Lebanese Moslem allegations that
France may intervene militarily and have said the flotilla could be
used to evacuate some 7,000 French passport holders from Lebanon if
the fighting worsens.

<TEXT>
   United Mine Workers won a victory in court
but were less successful in the field, where they mounted a
demonstration against a coal company that no longer exists.
   Circuit Judge Donald McGlothlin, who has fined the union $7.5
million for violating strike restrictions, on Monday dismissed
contempt charges against UMW Vice President Cecil Roberts and other
union leaders who took part in an outlawed sit-down demonstration
against the Pittston Coal Group Inc.
   ``This is your victory today,'' Roberts told cheering union
members after the three-hour trial. ``You can feel you are balancing
the scales of justice. If the system treats us fairly we're going to
beat Pittston.''
   The UMW has been on strike against Pittston since April in a
dispute over wages and benefits. The strike affects 1,900 Pittston
miners in West Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky. About 46,000 fellow
union members stayed off the job for about a month in wildcat
sympathy strikes.
   Roberts and five other members of the union's international
policy-making board, along with 13 rank-and-file members, were
arrested July 25 for sitting in a road to block the entrance to
Pittston's main coal preparation plant in Russell County.
   McGlothlin tossed out the contempt charges against the union
officials after ruling that the prosecuting attorney failed to show
that the union leaders were aware of a provision in his injunction
that prohibited people from blocking coal truck traffic.
   Special prosecutor Bob Detrick argued that the ban on sit-down
demonstrations, which has led to more than 2,000 arrests in the past
four months, was common knowledge.
   Meanwhile, in Huntington, W.Va., a few dozen UMW workers, joined
by about a dozen members of the Communications Workers of America,
staged a demonstration outside the headquarters of the Chafin Coal
Co., but found the company no longer existed.
   After finding an empty building where the coal company's
headquarters were once located, they went to the only building in
town named after a Chafin, but found the Chafins were no longer
affiliated with it.
   They settled for a downtown bank where John Chafin, the company's
former president, is on the board of directors.
   Then it rained, forcing the group to disband.
   The mine workers, wearing camouflage, said the coal company
disbanded and subleased its Logan County mines as a way to get
around using union labor.
   ``They've opened some new mines at the hollow but they haven't
called the laid-off fellows back to work,'' said Fred O. Hartman, a
roof bolter furloughed two years ago.
   There was no indication that Chafin was at the bank, or even in
Huntington. Calls to his home telephone went unanswered; a telephone
at the home of John Chafin Jr., a company vice president, had been
disconnected.

<HEAD>Turkish Visa Requirement For Ethnic Turks From Bulgaria In Effect
Today</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beginning today, Turkey is requiring visas
for ethnic Turks from Bulgaria until an immigration accord is
negotiated with the Warsaw Pact country, an official said.
   The new requirement, which opposition leaders attacked, will
allow Ankara to exert more control over an exodus that has brought
300,000 Bulgarian Turks into Turkey the past three months, Foreign
Ministry officials said.
   Turkey has been having trouble providing jobs and housing for the
immigrants. Many are temporarily housed in school buildings closed
for the summer.
   The semi-official Anatolia News Agency, reporting from the Edirne
border province, quoted Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., as saying he
had seen 10,000 ethnic Turks lined up in cars waiting to get into
Turkey.
   An official at the Kapikule border post on the Turkish-Bulgarian
border said he was told the visa requirement goes into effect today.
   Erdal Inonu, leader of the main opposition Social Democrat
Populist Party, said the foreign policy of Turkey had been
discredited by what he called a policy reversal.
   But a Foreign Ministry statement said the government decision was
prompted by Bulgaria's refusal to start talks toward an immigration
agreement protecting the rights of ethnic Turks coming to Turkey.
   The immigrants say they are fleeing a harsh assimilation campaign
that has forced them to change their Moslem names to Slavic ones.
They say they have also been fined and beaten for speaking Turkish
in public and for practicing Islamic rites.
   The Foreign Ministry said Turkey is still determined to accept
all Bulgaria's ethnic Turks who want to come, but within the
framework of an immigration agreement keeping families united and
allowing compensation for property left behind and for accumulated
social security.
   There are an estimated 1.5 million ethnic Turks in Bulgaria, and
about 3,000 to 5,000 ethnic Turks have been streaming daily into
Turkey.
   Leaders of the immigrant community in Turkey expect the influx to
increase after the harvest season in September. They said the total
could go as high as 900,000 if Turkey continues open-door policies.

<HEAD>University Suspends Provision of its Anti-Discriminatory Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Michigan said it would
have suspended part of its policy on racial harassment even if a a
civil rights group had not charged the policy violates
constitutional free speech rights.
   ``While we believe that the entire harassment policy can
withstand legal scrutiny, we also knew from the beginning that the
policy would be refined and improved as we gained experience from
its implementation,'' Elsa Kircher Cole, the university's general
counsel, said Monday.
   The policy, which applies to all students enrolled at the Ann
Arbor school, prohibits harassment or discrimination based on race,
ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, creed, national
origin, ancestry, age, marital status, handicap or Vietnam-veteran
status.
   The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan filed a federal
lawsuit in May, saying the policy violated constitutional guarantees
of freedom of speech. The case is pending.
   The suspended provision prohibits behavior in academic settings
that creates an intimidating, hostile or demeaning environment for
educational pursuits, employment or participation in University
sponsored extracurricular activities.
   Michigan will continue to enforce its anti-harassment policy
against behavior that victimizes an individual, the university said
in a written statement.
   ``The ACLU suit has probably focused our attention on certain
aspects of the policy which would have been discussed during the
continuing review process this fall, but I have no doubt the review
would have led to the same outcome,'' Cole said.
   The policy on discrimination was adopted in April 1988 following
a series of racial incidents on campus.
   The ACLU said in its suit that the policy was intended ``to
create a chilling effect on the expression of certain ideas because
of the content of those ideas,'' and is too broad and vague.

<HEAD>No Fanfare in China on Deng's 85th Birthday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government held no public celebration today on
the 85th birthday of senior leader Deng Xiaoping, but major
newspapers carried one of his speeches rejecting mass democracy for
China.
   The papers devoted a half-page to the full text of his 1957
speech that said Communist Party members must be supervised by the
party, the masses and non-Communist parties if they are to do their
jobs well.
   ``If we refuse to accept supervision or ignore promoting
democracy within the party and the nation, we will inevitably be
divorced from the masses and make big mistakes,'' Deng said in the
speech.
   However, he went on to say that China must not implement ``big
democracy,'' which the papers referred to the ``large-scale clash of
public opinions and unrest'' that is found in Western-style
democracies.
   A footnote to the speech said the term was first used by
revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung in 1956.
   ``We can do without such democracy only if we have small
democracy,'' Deng said, meaning the masses should have channels for
expressing their opinions to the party.
   Party organization officials are in the middle of a major meeting
to discuss strengthening the 47 million-member party, including
better policing members who express opinions contrary to the party
line.
   Today's papers quoted Premier Li Peng as saying the meeting
``will play an important role in eliminating the erroneous effects
of Comrade Zhao Ziyang on party building.'' Zhao was ousted as party
chief in June after a top-level power struggle over how to handle
the spring student democracy movement.
   The new party chief, Jiang Zemin, was quoted as saying that ``the
masses of the party workers had long expressed dissatisfaction with
Comrade Zhao for his mistakes in trying to weaken the leadership of
the party.''
   Zhao has become China's national scapegoat since his purge, and
nearly all of the nation's problems have been blamed on him.
   The papers did not mention Deng's birthday, and many people
seemed unaware of the date. By contrast, even 13 years after his
death the nation still notes the birthday of Chairman Mao Tse-tung
on Dec. 26 with special essays in the newspapers.
   ``Is today Deng's birthday?'' said a cab driver. ``We're all
waiting for him to die. He doesn't have much longer.''
   Deng, whose health has declined gradually in recent years, is now
reported to be seriously ill with cancer. He has not been seen in
public since June 9, when he spoke to martial law troops in Beijing.
The most recent photo of him, printed in newspapers Monday, was
taken more than seven weeks ago.
   No sign of Deng's birthday was seen anywhere in central Beijing,
even along the main thoroughfare, Changan Avenue, which is always
colorfully decorated with flags and banners on special occasions.
   Deng's birthday was not celebrated in past years, but since the
June 3-4 military crackdown there have been hints of a possible
emerging personality cult.
   The press has quoted him regularly and released several past
essays by him, a new volume of his collected writings has been
issued, a book of reminiscences about his early career has come out
and a major movie has been made about his role in leading a
Communist uprising in 1929. The China Art Gallery now displays a
bronze bust of him.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for self-described hotel queen Leona
Helmsley ended their defense after calling an accountant who told
the jury in the tax evasion case that the defendant and her husband
overpaid $581,000 in taxes in 1983-85.
   The accountant, Gerald W. Padwe, testified Monday that the
federal overpayment stemmed from underreporting the depreciation of
property in Helmsley-controlled partnerships.
   Padwe was the last of four witnesses called by attorneys for Mrs.
Helmsley, who is accused of evading $1.2 million in federal taxes in
1983-85 by charging personal expenses to businesses.
   Lawyers for Mrs. Helmsley's two co-defendants, Frank Turco and
Joseph Licari, also rested Monday but without calling any witnesses.
Turco and Licari, who were former top aides in the Helmsley
organization, are charged with assisting Mrs. Helmsley in the tax
evasion scheme.
   Turco and Mrs. Helmsley are also charged with conspiring to
extort payoffs and merchandise from vendors doing business with
Helmsley companies.
   The prosecution closed its case last Tuesday after six weeks of
testimony. Lawyers will present closing arguments Wednesday.
   On cross-examination by Assistant U.S. Attorney James DeVita,
Padwe acknowledged that his review was selective and that the
Helmsleys could have underpaid taxes in the following years.
   DeVita also implied that the calculation method was part of a
strategy to reduce the amount of taxes paid in the long run.
   Padwe acknowledged that there could be a tax advantage to
spreading out the depreciation and said it would be ``clearly
improper.'' He said, however, that he did not know if the
calculations were deliberate or by mistake.
   DeVita had opposed the defense lawyers' request to call Padwe to
the stand. The prosecutor said the evidence was irrelevant and could
confuse the jury.

<HEAD>Orders for Big-Ticket Goods Decline for Fourth Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods fell
1.9 percent in July, the fourth decline this year, the government
said today in a report that showed manufacturing continuing to
struggle despite recent interest rate declines.
   The Commerce Department said demand for durable goods, items
expected to last three or more years, totaled a seasonally adjusted
$122.9 billion last month, the lowest level since October 1988.
   Durable goods, one of the most interest rate-sensitive sectors of
the economy because consumers often borrow to buy them, also had
declined in January, February and May.
   The latest drop came despite moves by the Federal Reserve Board
since early June to nudge interest rates lower. Earlier, the central
bank had been raising rates to dampen economic vigor and
inflationary pressure.
   However, last month's bad news was somewhat offset by a sharply
revised increase of 1.4 percent in durable-goods orders in June,
previously reported at up only 0.4 percent.
   Excluding the defense category, which swings widely from month to
month, orders fell 0.9 percent in July after an 0.3 percent gain a
month earlier.
   Military orders plunged 14.7 percent to $7.6 billion in July
following a 17.4 percent rise in June.
   The other major decline came in non-electrical machinery, which
plummeted 9.7 percent last month to $21.1 billion, following a 4.8
percent rise in June. The Commerce Department attributed half the
decline to a drop in orders for engines and turbines.
   In a sign of strength, however, the closely watched non-defense
capital goods sector rose 5.0 percent to $41.1 billion following a
5.1 percent gain in June. Economists use this category as a
barometer of business investment plans.
   The department offered these other details of July activity:
   _Electrical machinery, up 1.3 percent to $19.8 billion, following
a June gain of 4.8 percent.
   _Primary metals, including steel, up 0.8 percent to $11.9
billion, following a 5.1 percent drop.
   _Transportation equipment, up 2.3 percent to $34.2 billion after
a 0.1 percent drop. A large increase in aircraft orders offset
declines in motor vehicles, shipbuilding and tanks.
   Shipments of durable goods fell 3.0 percent to $118.1 billion in
July, following drops of 1.0 percent in June and 0.3 percent in May.

   The bodies of U.S. Rep. Mickey
Leland and eight other Americans who died in a plane crash in
Ethiopia two weeks ago were on their way home today after a memorial
service at the airport.
   The coffins of the nine Americans, draped in U.S. flags, were
loaded onto a C-141 after a two-hour ceremony.
   The U.S. military cargo plane left Ethiopia's international
airport shortly after noon and was scheduled to arrive in Washington
Wednesday afternoon after stopping overnight in Frankfurt, West
Germany.
   Leland, D-Texas, the other Americans and seven Ethiopians died
Aug. 7 on their way to a refugee camp along Ethiopia's southwestern
border when their twin-engine plane slammed into a mountainside. All
16 on board are believed to have died instantly.
   The bodies were found a week later after a massive search effort
by U.S. and Ethiopian officials. Retrieval of the bodies took
several days and identification of the remains took nearly a week.
   In Washington, the State Department said it was planning a
memorial service for the government officials that died in the crash.
   Leland's family is planning a private service in Houston, and the
State Department will hold its service Wednesday at the Lincoln
Memorial.
   During the airport service here, Leland was eulogized by
American, Ethiopian and U.N. officials as a man of compassion.
   ``The fact that he met his tragic death while on a humanitarian
mission is ample testimony of his dedication to the well-being of
people,'' said Tesfaye Wolde-Selassie, Ethiopia's minister of
internal affairs.
   The coffins containing the 16 victims were accompanied by an
honor guard. A band played solemn music as they were transported
from a makeshift clinic, where their remains were identified, to the
tarmac.
   Work at the aiport stopped and airport employees joined senior
Ethiopian officials, U.S. Embassy staff and their families, and
relatives of the Ethiopian victims at the ceremony. The air was
filled with the sound of Ethiopians wailing in grief and sympathy.
   Leland, chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger, was
heading to the Fugnido refugee camp when the crash occurred. The
camp is one of four that house more than 300,000 Sudanese fleeing
war and famine in that neighboring country.
   It was the 44-year-old congressman's fifth visit to Africa and
his second this year.
   The other Americans who died in the crash were:
   _Patrice Johnson, 35, a Leland aide.
   _Hugh A. Johnson, 34, a member of the House Select Committee on
Hunger.
   _Ivan Lee Tillem, 33, a New York City lawyer and Leland friend
who was investigating prospects for food-relief projects he had
proposed for Ethiopia.
   _Joyce Francine Williams, 39, an aide to U.S. Rep. Ron Dellums,
D-Calif., and an expert on child health and nutrition issues.
   _Robert Woods, age unavailable, a political and economic officer
with the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa.
   _Gladys Gilbert, 43, special projects officer for AID in Addis
Ababa.
   _Thomas J. Worrick, 48, the deputy AID representative in Addis
Ababa.
   _Roberta Worrick, 48, wife of Thomas Worrick and a contract
employee of the AID mission in Addis Ababa.

<HEAD>Arkansas City Revises Stockade Ordinance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DERMOTT, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parents of delinquents no longer face a
stockade, but those who don't keep their kids in line can still draw
hefty fines and jail time.
   The city council revised its 2-week-old ordinance Monday, leaving
a provision that said parents of wayward youngsters could face up to
30 days in jail, but deleting the part that said two of those days
could be spent on public display in a stockade.
   The law didn't define a stockade, the city doesn't have one and
the council didn't vote the money to build one when it passed the
law initially.
   A provision in the earlier ordinance to publish photographs of
parents of delinquents also was dropped, as was a requirement that
such parents place bumper stickers on their cars identifying
themselves as irresponsible.
   It was time to revise the ordinance because it had done its job
of calling attention to the problem of juvenile crime in this city
of 4,500 with a seven-member police force, said City Attorney
Charles Sidney Gibson.
   But, he said, a tough ordinance was needed because, ``We're going
to have a dangerous situation here. We're going to pull some kid in
some night and he'll be dead.''
   The old ordinance was passed following a street fight that drew a
crowd of 250 people and because of an overall increase in crime
during the summer that Police Chief Jerry Melton said could be
attributed mostly to juveniles.
   Like the old ordinance, the revised version says parents will
receive a warning the first time their children are caught violating
an 11 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. curfew. The second time, parents will face
up to 30 days in jail and up to a $500 fine or 20 hours of community
service.
   Under the new ordinance, parents may not permit their children to
possess drugs or permit their children to have firearms without
parental supervision.
   Some people at Monday's meeting strongly objected to a provision
saying parents cannot leave children under 12 unsupervised for more
than an hour. But Gibson insisted that it would take only an hour to
produce a potentially deadly situation.
   Parents also objected to a part of the ordinance that prohibits
gatherings of two or more minors ``with riotous conduct.''

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh is under fire
for saying that investigators may subpoena telephone records of
reporters who have been leaked government information.
   ``While we feel strongly about leaks, forcing reporters to
disclose their sources is anathema to the First Amendment,'' Reps.
Don Edwards, D-Calif., and Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Monday in a
letter to Thornburgh.
   ``We are opposed to forcing reporters to disclose their sources,
through compulsory process or subpoenas for reporters' telephone
records.''
   Thornburgh's contention on Sunday's NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press''
that Supreme Court actions indicate such a search would be permitted
under the First Amendment also drew criticism from Jane Kirtley,
executive director of the Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the
Press.
   ``I am repeatedly appalled that the attorney general seems to
feel justified in ignoring guidelines that have served both the
interests of the news media and the Justice Department very well for
10 years,'' Kirtley said.
   ``I think it shows a total lack of appreciation of the First
Amendment interests that were recognized by his predecessors,'' she
said.
   Kirtley said the Supreme Court declined to hear a 1978 case that
addressed the issue, Reporters Committee vs. AT&amp;T.
   The Justice Department has been investigating a news leak this
spring that led to a CBS News report on an FBI investigation
involving Rep. William Gray, D-Pa. Various department officials have
been questioned by FBI agents and at least one has appeared before a
grand jury.
   As stories about Gray abounded in the midst of the House party
leadership election, the Justice Department took the unusual step of
announcing that he was not the subject of an investigation.
   Gray was elected House Democratic whip.
   A source said Monday that the Justice Department was considering
subpoenaing the telephone records of CBS reporter Rita Braver, who
first reported the story. The network learned about the possible
subpoena and contacted the department, the source said.
   Tom Goodman, a New York-based spokesman for CBS, said the records
had not been subpoenaed. Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian
declined to comment.
   Edwards, chairman of the subcommittee on civil and constitutional
rights, and Schumer, who chairs the subcommittee on criminal
justice, also denounced the department's plan to prosecute
government officials for leaking information.
   ``You are invoking the statute on theft of government property
which really has nothing to do with leaks,'' Edwards and Schumer
wrote. ``Congress has not adopted a criminal statute for leaks, and
certainly never intended the theft of property law to be used in
this way.''
   The revision of the department's 11-year-old policy, intended to
protect whistleblowers and reporters from prosecution, was announced
Aug. 2 in testimony submitted to Congress.
   Thornburgh said Aug. 3 that he wouldn't prosecute reporters who
obtain news leaks about criminal investigations but would charge
federal officials who are their sources.
   ``The statute clearly calls for prosecution of those involved in
misusing sensitive information that comes to them in an official
capacity,'' Thornburgh said.
   Accurate leaks ``have a tendency to compromise ongoing
investigations,'' he said. ``If they are inaccurate, they have a
tendency to unjustifiably smear the reputations of persons who are
the subject of the leak.''

<HEAD>Azerbaijani Workers Strike to Back Territorial Demand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers at dozens of factories and businesses were
on strike for a second day today in the republic of Azerbaijan to
press ethnic demands for control of a disputed territory.
   Workers at about 25 businesses walked out Monday.
   Nine factories were at a standstill today, said Natan Barsky,
editor-in-chief of the Azerbaijani news agency Azerinform. He spoke
in a telephone interview from the southern republic's Caspian Sea
capital, Baku.
   Local residents and activists claimed the strike was still
broader today, affecting almost 100 enterprises and involving
hundreds of thousands of Baku residents.
   The walkout was organized by the Azerbaijani People's Front, a
grassroots group fighting for Azerbaijani control over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian region taken away from
Azerbaijan this year. Armenians in their neighboring republic were
protesting to annex the area, and the Kremlin put it under its own
direct control this year in an effort to calm tensions.
   Journalist and interpreter Nazim Ragimov said today's stoppage
included an oil refinery, several defense plants, an air-conditioner
factory and five loading docks.
   The strike was planned to end later today, but organizers have
threatened to prolong it or call a general strike on Sept. 2 if they
are not satisfied by the official response.
   The People's Front has been sponsoring mass rallies in Baku for
weeks.
   It is also demanding annulment of this spring's legislative
elections and freedom for group militants detained in Baku rallies
late last year.

   An inquest opened today into the sinking of a
pleasure boat on the River Thames, and new safety regulations went
into effect. Police raised the death toll to 26 after another body
was discovered.
   Police said 31 others are missing and believed dead from the
accident Sunday, in which the Marchioness was rammed by a
sand-and-gravel dredger, the Bowbelle, and 79 survived.
   Earlier, police said 37 were missing and 87 survived.
   The Transport and General Workers Union said crewmen based at
Westminster Pier, near the Houses of Parliament, decided at a mass
meeting early today to cancel all pleasure boat sailings until the
wreckage is removed.
   ``The men feel very sad about what has happened and they feel
they just can't operate while the Marchioness wreck is still lying
there,'' said union spokesman Michael Cashman.
   The latest body was found near Battersea, about 2 miles upstream
from the wreckage, police said.
   The Marchioness was resting on a sandy bank at the riverside near
the accident site, exposed to view at low tides.
   A young crowd of guests from the worlds of fashion and banking
were partying aboard the 90-ton pleasure boat, which sank in the
fast-flowing tidal river within a few minutes.
   At a London coroner's court, the inquest into the 16 bodies which
have been identified opened briefly and was then adjourned by
coroner Dr. Paul Knapman. It will resume after other inquiries are
completed. Under British law, the inquest had to open before the
victims could be buried.
   Two new regulations for pleasure boats on the busy Thames went
into effect today. They were announced Monday by Transport Secretary
Cecil Parkinson.
   One covers checks on passenger numbers. Captains are already
required to count passengers to ensure the boats are not overloaded.
Now they will have to leave a record of passenger totals at their
headquarters before sailing.
   Tidal Cruises, the company that owns the Marchioness, has denied
the vessel was overcrowded.
   The vessel, hired for the 26th birthday party of London financier
Antonio Vasconcellos, went down shortly after leaving on a 1
a.m.-to-dawn trip.
   The dredger struck the Marchioness from behind and then ran it
over, shearing off the pleasure boat's top deck. The wreckage
carried underwater scores of people who had been drinking and
dancing below deck.
   Vasconcellos and the captain, Stephen Faldo, were among those
still missing.
   The other new regulation says pleasure boat passengers must be
given more information about what to do in an emergency. Up to now,
passengers have not normally been given any instructions about
escape routes or safety equipment.
   A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said Monday that police investigators
are considering bringing criminal charges over the disaster. She
said charges of ``unlawful killing,'' roughly similar to
manslaughter, and other related charges are being considered but she
refused to elaborate.
   Police on Monday said they had released the dredger's captain and
second mate, who were arrested and questioned after the sinking.
They said they also interviewed the five other members of the
dredger's crew.
   Along with police, the Department of Transport's Marine Accident
Investigation Branch and the Port of London Authority were
investigating the accident.
   The Independent and Evening Standard newspapers on Monday
reported a disagreement had developed between the two captains over
which vessel had the right of way under the central span of
Southwark Bridge, where the collision occurred.
   ``It seems that both captains thought that they were in the
right, but technically the actions of both could be held up to
scrutiny,'' the Standard quoted an unnamed river authority source as
saying.
   But Jane Carmichael of Tidal Cruises said that although smaller
craft usually stick to the side arches, Faldo was correct to move
through the center Sunday because of tide conditions.
   ``We do not know what went wrong,'' she said. ``Our captain was
acting totally correctly.''
   Police said they listened tape-recorded radio traffic between the
captains of both vessels and shore control for clues into the cause
of the crash.
   Scotland Yard declined to comment on the newspaper reports.

   A relief organization of Lebanese Americans
today announced an emergency campaign to collect medical and
pharmaceutical supplies for four besieged hospitals in Beirut.
   The Save Lebanon organization said it received telephone calls
recently from doctors in Beirut appealing for urgent donations of
insulin, oxygen, bandages, hospital linens and cooking gas.
   The Lebanese capital has been devastated by five months of
fighting between Syrian troops and their Moslem allies and the
Christian forces controlling Lebanon's army. Nearly 800 people have
been killed and more than 2,000 wounded. Thousands have fled.
   Khatmeh Osseiran, Executive Director of the non-sectarian Save
Lebanon organization, said the medical supplies would be flown by
Royal Jordanian Airlines to Amman and trucked from there via Syria
to Lebanon.
   She said Syria has been allowing relief supplies through its
territory, but if these shipments are blocked, they can be rerouted
through Cyprus.
   The supplies will be distributed to two hospitals in Christian
East Beirut _ St. George Orthodox Hospital and Hotel Dieu _ and two
in Moslem West Beirut _ American University Hospital and Berbir
Medical Center, she said.

   President Bush is planning a

   Details of the Alaska leg of the mid-September trip remain to be

   White House chief of staff John H. Sununu said Monday that Bush
``wants to hit as many of the centennial states as possible. There

<TEXT>
   A career Marine infected with the same AIDS virus
that killed his wife and son testified in his $55 million lawsuit
that government doctors passed the disease to his family through a
tainted transfusion.
   Dressed in civilian clothes and maintaining a stoic demeanor,
Chief Warrant Officer Martin Gaffney told the court Monday that
government doctors botched his wife's pregnancy and eventually
decimated his family.
   Gaffney's testimony came on the opening day of his non-jury trial
in his lawsuit against the federal government in U.S. District Court.
   His daughter, Maureene, 6, the only member of the family to
escape infection, sat in the courtroom with a relative who gave her
a coloring book.
   Gaffney has said he filed the lawsuit primarily to provide for
his daughter, since she may well become an orphan.
   ``It's a relief just to finally be here,'' Gaffney said.
   At issue is Gaffney's charge that doctors at the Navy Regional
Medical Center in Long Beach, Calif., were negligent in the handling
of his wife's 1981 pregnancy. The couple's son was stillborn, and
Gaffney's wife then was given a blood transfusion tainted with the
deadly virus, the lawsuit alleges.
   The couple's 13-month-old son, John, born after an ensuing
pregnancy, died in 1986. Tests determined he and the parents all had
the AIDS virus. The mother, Mutsuko Gaffney, 38, died in May 1987.
   ``Had Mrs. Gaffney received appropriate treatment, the Gaffney
family today would be intact and happy,'' Gaffney's attorney Jaclyn
McKenney said before U.S. District Judge Rya Zobel.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Marianne Bowler countered that Navy
doctors maintained an adequate and ``professional standard of care''
during Mrs. Gaffney's pregnancy.
   Gaffney, who tested positive for the AIDS virus but so far shows
no symptoms of the disease, testified that a Navy doctor in Long
Beach saw his wife sometime around her due date in August 1981 and
declined to induce labor, saying he ``likes to have these things
happen naturally and let nature take its course.''
   When Mrs. Gaffney went to the hospital on Sept. 19 complaining of
abdominal pains, she was seen only by a nurse who sent her home,
Gaffney testified. On Sept. 21, she returned to the hospital with
similar pains and was told her baby had died sometime over the past
two days.
   Mrs. Gaffney underwent a Cesarean section and was then given two
units of blood. One of them,was infected with the AIDS virus,
McKenney said Monday.
   Navy officials and a Massachusetts General Hospital internist who
treated Mrs. Gaffney traced the two donors, one of whom tested
negative for the AIDS virus. The other, discharged from the Navy for
homosexual activity, refused to be tested.
   Gaffney and his daughter now live on base at the South Weymouth
Naval Air Station, about 15 miles south of Boston.
   Shortly after Gaffney was transferred there, base officials
refused to allow Maureene to attend the day care center because of
the family's history of AIDS infection. Gaffney called upon Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy to intervene and Maureene was eventually allowed
to attend.
   Doctors said there is no explanation why some children born to a
woman with AIDS get the disease and others do not. They also say it
is unlikely Maureene will develop AIDS at this late date.

<HEAD>Hungarian Party Leader Says He Will Step Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Karoly Grosz, general secretary of the
ruling Communist Party, said in remarks published today he is ready
to step down to avoid a power struggle within the political
leadership, but the party must decide.
   Grosz's statement in an interview with the party daily
Nepszabadsag was the first time he acknowledged the power struggle,
and it appeared to signal his defeat by party reformers.
   ``Many people believe that the main cause of the current problems
is the power struggle within the party .... I would not like to have
a power struggle, as it would not do any good to either the party or
the country,'' Grosz said in interview excerpts carried today by the
state news agency MTI.
   However, he was also quoted as saying, ``Even if I myself want to
retire, it is the ... party that will bring the decision.''
   Grosz gave no date for whenhe might retire. A party congress is
scheduled to start Oct. 6.
   On Sunday, party secretary Pal Ivanyi told a rally marking the
day of St. Stephen, the founder of the Hungarian state, that Grosz
was planning to resign.
   In a June interview with the independent daily Mai Nap, Grosz
said he wanted to quit after elections next year.
   The Communists have said they will allow candidates other than
their own to run in those elections, due by June. They would be the
first freely contested races in this country since the Communists
consolidated power in 1948.
   Grosz became Communist Party leader in May 1988. He is considered
a party centrist who jockeyed for middle ground between the
reformers and party conservatives wary of moves toward a multi-party
system.
   The general secretary, however, was forced into the background
two months ago during a leadership reshuffle when his post was
included in a four-man leadership group controlled by party
reformers.

<HEAD>Prison Guard Says He's Been Made Scapegoat in Helicopter Escape</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A prison guard says he's been made a
scapegoat in the prison break by two inmates whose wives allegedly
commandeered a helicopter, and adds that he never got an order to
shoot at the craft.
   Guard Russ Ellis was suspended with pay following the spectacular
escape Friday from the Arkansas Valley Correction Facility. He had
been stationed in a tower and armed with a .308-caliber rifle.
   He said his finger was on the trigger and he was ready to shoot
if he had gotten an order from prison superintendent Jim Brittain.
   Convicts Ralph Brown and Freddie Gonzales were captured with
their wives about eight hours later in Holdrege, Neb., 400 miles
away, after a shootout with law enforcement officers. They had
transferred from the helicopter to a van a few miles from the
prison, leaving the helicopter pilot tied up but unhurt.
   The inmates and their wives, Patricia Gonzales and Rebecca Brown,
were charged Monday in Nebraska with attempted murder. Bail was set
at $1 million for all of them except Brown, whose arraignment was
postponed until later today because he is still under treatment for
a hand wound suffered in the shootout.
   On Monday, Ellis, 25, gave his first detailed account of what
happened when the helicopter landed in the prison exercise yard.
   ``Radio traffic became heavy and everybody was yelling on the
radio,'' Ellis said. ``I was prepared to use lethal force when
(Brittain) gave the order. I never heard the order to shoot.''
   Ellis, a guard at the prison since December 1987, is to appear at
a hearing Wednesday that will determine if he will keep his job.
   He disputed Brittain's assessment that he froze up.
   ``It wasn't that I couldn't pull the trigger,'' Ellis said. ``I
could have. That's my job. I was prepared but I didn't hear the
order.''
   He said he heard Brittain order another tower to use lethal
force, but he did not hear that order directed to the tower where he
was stationed.
   In addition, he said: ``Tower 1 was in my line of fire, plus the
helicopter was still in the compound. If I would have shot it, it
would have exploded and crashed into the cellblock. A lot of people
would have been killed.''
   Brittain said Monday he would not respond to Ellis' account of
the helicopter escape.
   ``That's what the personnel hearing is all about,'' Brittain
said. ``He's had the weekend to think it over and he's come up with
some interesting suggestions.''
   Sometimes radio transmissions are recorded at the prison, but
Ellis said Friday's escape happened too fast and no recordings were
made.

   The battle to build the county's first
synagogue got the backing of religious leaders in the face of
resident opposition and defacing of signs at the proposed site with
swastikas.
   Residents opposed the site at the county planning board's meeting
last week, but the board unanimously recommended approval. The
county commission was scheduled to review the proposal tonight.
   About 15 clergy from several faiths _ including Baptist,
Unitarian and Catholic _ met Monday with officials from the American
Jewish Committee at the First United Methodist Church of Snellville
after several of the residents' comments were called anti-semitic.
   The clergy issued a joint statement that read in part:
   ``It is our perception that the majority of the people of
Gwinnett County support religious liberty and respect the religious
pluralism of our community. ... We Christian ministers and religious
leaders here assembled reject anti-semitism in all its forms,
welcome the establishment of Temple Beth David Synagogue and pledge
our complete support and love.''
   ``The real story here is a positive one,'' said Richard Baroff,
rabbi of Temple Beth David Inc. ``There will come a day when there
are Hindu and Buddhist groups in Gwinnett County. It's all part of
becoming a cosmopolitan county.''
   ``There are no Jews in this neighborhood,'' Snellville resident
Pat Garmon complained at the Aug. 15 planning commission meeting.
   A synagogue in her neighborhood, she said, ``would be like us
going into an all-French neighborhood and building a Baptist church.
It's odd.''
   A sign on the site of the proposed synagogue has twice been
defaced with swastikas.

   Huey Newton, former Black Panther leader,
was found fatally shot in an Oakland street early today, police
reported.
   Newton, 47, was found in west Oakland about 5:30 a.m., said
Oakland Police Officer Terry Foley.
   A 10-foot pool of blood marked the spot where the 47-year-old
Newton was found suffering from multiple gunshot wounds, including
at least one shot in the head.
   About a dozen officers cordoned off the city block in a
low-income neighborhood in west Oakland. Several hours later,
Newton's body had been taken away from the street in front a gray,
two-story house.
   ``I saw him laying down on the street. I called my wife to the
window,'' said a resident of the neighborhood, Roy Johnson. He said
he did not hear any gunshots and did not call the police.
   Foley said no further details were immediately available.
   With Bobby Seal, Newton was co-founder of the Black Panthers, the
now-defunct radical black liberation group, in the 1960s and served
as its defense minister.
   Newton's career was marked by many clashes with the law. Last
year, he served two months in San Quentin prison for a parole
violation.

   Explorers set out for the wreck of
the Edmund Fitzgerald today, hoping to use an underwater robot to
get new explanations for the Lake Superior disaster almost 14 years
ago.
   The 729-foot steel freighter took on water and snapped in two
during a storm in November 1975, sending it and all 29 crewmen to
the bottom of Lake Superior. No bodies were recovered.
   The three-day expedition began early today from Whitefish Point
under rainy skies. Researchers will use a robot carrying video
cameras to reach the wreck 556 feet beneath the surface, said Tom
Farnquist, director of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society
and one of three expedition leaders.
   The search will test newly developed video equipment and its uses
for underwater archeology.
   Science aside, ``the carrot in there is: `Wow, we get to see the
Fitzgerald,''' Farnquist said Monday.
   The wreck of the Fitzgerald lies about 17 miles northwest of
Whitefish Point on Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
   The Fitzgerald was hauling more than 27,000 tons of iron ore from
Superior, Wis., to Detroit when it ran into a gale on the eastern
end of Lake Superior. The boat disappeared from radar without even a
distress call.
   The wreck was memorialized in song by Gordon Lightfoot and
remains the subject of public fascination, Farnquist said.
   ``It's the most historic of the recent wrecks, and it shouldn't
have happened, in this modern age of sailing,'' he said from his
home in Sault Ste. Marie.
   A U.S. Coast Guard team in 1976 used a cable-controlled device to
record black and white video images of the boat, the front half of
which still sat upright in the mud bottom. Farnquist said this
week's expedition should provide clear footage that could shed light
on what exactly caused the boat to break.
   The federal Fish and Wildlife Service is loaning its research
vessel Grayling for the expedition. Television station WQED from
Pittsburgh will film the search for the National Geographic Society.
   The camera-carrying robot, from Deep Sea Systems International of
Falmouth, Mass., can venture 150 feet away from its submersible
cage, allowing researchers to cover 300 feet of the wreckage at a
time.
   ``It's going to be great,'' Farnquist said.

   National police said today they started
proceedings to hand over a reputed cocaine finance chief to the
United States in a test of a new emergency plan for extraditing
alleged top narcotics traffickers.
   Eduardo Martinez Romero, arrested during the weekend in the
northern Department of Sucre, is wanted in the United States in
connection with the laundering of vast sums of cocaine profits.
   Col. Oscar Carmona, chief of the national police force's judicial
investigations division, told reporters that proceedings for
Martinez' extradition began this morning. The government, responding
to a wave of assassinations, launched an emergency crackdown on the
drug underworld on Friday that included a new extradition program.
   Carmona said the procedure included notes to the Justice Ministry
and to the U.S. Embassy informing them of the detention of Martinez,
a 35-year-old economist.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said he had no immediate comment on
Martinez' arrest.
   According to Col. Alfonso Arellano, the police commander for
Sucre, Martinez was nabbed in a raid on a rural estate in the
Caribbean coastal town of Tolu, about 340 miles north of Bogota.
   ``There was no resistance, really because of the surprise with
which they (police agents) acted,'' Arellano said in an interview
broadcast Monday night by the private national radio network Radio
Caracol.
   The Bogota daily El Tiempo on Monday reported that, when
arrested, Martinez had none of the heavily armed bodyguards that
customarily accompany drug lords. It said that, in statements made
while jailed in Bogota, Martinez declared his innocence.
   ``At no time have I had links to the Medellin cartel and I don't
know any of its members,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The arrest raid was one of more than 300 carried out nationwide
since an emergency crackdown launched by the government late Friday,
in response to the assassinatin by the cocaine cartels of a
presidential candidate, a police colonel and a magistrate. More
raids were being reported regularly.
   According to national police headquaters today, 10,972 people
have been detained nationwide in 467 raids by police and military
forces so far in the crackdown.
   Police said a total of 473 arms, many of them high-powered
automatic weapons, have been seized. Authorities impounded 1,140
cars and trucks, 22 yachts, 135 planes and 15 helicopters, police
said. They said that, in many cases, the aircraft were being
grounded only until the owners could prove they had been
legitimately purchased and were being used for legal activities.
   As part of the crackdown, President Virgilio Barco also signed a
decree empowering his government to summarily extradite suspected
traffickers without approval by Colombia's judges, many of whom have
been threatened or killed by hitmen. U.S. officials had been
pressuring Barco to take the action since the Supreme Court in 1987
nullified a 1979 extradition agreement.
   In Washington, a spokesman for the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, Frank Shults, said as many as 100 Colombians are
being considered for possible extradition, including three leaders
of the Medellin cartel: Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, Pablo Escobar and
Jorge Luis Ochoa.
   The drug cartel is believed responsible for bringing up to 80
percent of the Colombian cocaine into the United States, authorities
say.
   President Bush on Monday praised the steps Barco was taking and
offered ``appropriate assistance as rapidly as possible,'' a White
House statement said. It said Barco told Bush that sending in U.S.
troops was not necessary.
   Officials in Washington said Monday that the United States is
preparing to send a small team of police experts to Colombia to
advise judges, magistrates and journalists on how to improve
security. The special $5 million program was approved by Congress
more than a year ago.
   According to officials, Martinez narrowly escaped capture by U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration agents earlier this year in Panama.
He was allegedly in charge of finances for the powerful cartel of
Medellin, an industrial city that serves as the world's principal
trafficking center for cocaine.
   Other reputed cartel leaders continued to elude arrest.
   ``We haven't yet been able to capture the drug cartel chiefs, but
we have struck hard against their immense fortunes,'' army Gen.
Manuel Bonnet Locarno said Monday in the southwestern city of Cali,
another trafficking center.
   The military claimed the raids and property seizures were
inflicting a painful blow on the dealers' economic empire.
   Early Monday on Bogota's northern fringes, the army swarmed over
an opulent compound owned by Rodriguez Gacha.
   The estate included tennis, soccer and basketball courts, a duck
pond with a water wheel, a modern gym with weight-lifting equipment,
an indoor swimming pool, billards and ping pong tables and a pet
eagle. Soldiers guarding the compound said it was just one of dozens
of properties owned by Rodriguez Gacha.
   Scores of other properties owned by Rodriguez Gacha, Escobar and
Ochoa also were raided.
   Ronald Caffrey, special agent in charge of the Atlanta office of
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, confirmed Monday that
Martinez Romero was a defendant in the ``Polar Cap'' investigation
of drug money laundering involving the Medellin cartel. Caffrey said
it was unclear whether he would be extradited to stand trial in the
United States.
   One former cartel leader, Carlos Lehder, was extradited to the
United States in 1987, before the Colombian Supreme Court struck
down the extradition treaty. Lehder is now in federal prison in
Marion, Ill., serving a life sentence without parole plus 135 years.
   In the last eight years, drug traffickers in the South American
nation have killed more than 50 judges, including a dozen Supreme
Court justices, as well as a justice minister, an attorney general
and several journalists.

   A Bronx couple were arrested today and charged
with raping and sodomizing nine of their children, and three other
children were missing and believed murdered, police said.
   The identities of the 34-year-old mother and the 45-year-old
father were not immediately released. Both were charged with nine
counts of sodomy and rape, according to police spokesman Capt. Steve
Davis.
   The investigation which led to the charges began on May 25, when
the Bureau of Child Welfare took the nine children, who ranged in
age from 4 months to 16 years, away from the couple.
   Detectives discovered the couple had three other children during
interviews with people who knew the family, but could not account
for the missing children, who they believe were murdered.
   Diggers were scheduled to begin unearthing a vacant lot where the
bodies of two of the children were believed to be buried.
   The whereabouts of the third child's body was not known, Davis
said.

   Striking Eastern pilots said they felt betrayed by
the failure of their union's executive board to agree to a national
work stoppage.
   ``We have a whole lot of Eastern pilots who are extremely,
extremely disappointed,'' Gary Kosak, a spokesman for Eastern pilots
in Miami, said Monday. ``We see a tremendous lack of leadership, a
lack of guts, a lack of moral fiber.''
   Meeting in Washington on Friday, the Air Line Pilots Association
board also rejected a proposal by Eastern pilots that they be
allowed to keep their seniority if they are hired by other airlines.
   ALPA's national leadership in Washington did not respond to
repeated requests for comment Monday. In Miami, Eastern spokesman
Robin Matell said the airline had no comment.
   More than 600 pilots have crossed the picket lines since
Eastern's strike began March 4. Eleven days ago, Eastern announced
it had filled its quota of 1,700 pilots for its smaller, reorganized
operation. The ALPA has about 3,500 striking members.
   There has been no industry-wide strike by pilots since the 1930s,
according to the Airline Industrial Relations Conference.

   Two men arrested on charges of plotting to
kidnap, molest and kill a boy in a pornographic videotape had
advertised in computer bulletin boards, according to a court
document.
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson disclosed Monday that Dean Ashley
Lambey, 34, of Richmond, Va., and Daniel Depew, 28, of Alexandria,
were arrested Aug. 14 after a six-month investigation involving more
than 100 FBI agents in San Francisco, Richmond and the Washington,
D.C., area. They were being held without bail pending grand jury
action.
   The two men, charged with conspiracy to kidnap, had not targeted
a particular child, Hudson said. ``The plan was to kidnap a child
from northern Virginia or purchase the child through a group of
people,'' he said.
   Lambey and Depew used computer bulletin board networks to
advertise their sexual preference.
   One of the men said he could buy a child for $12,000 from an
out-of-state source, according to an official who spoke to The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
   Authorities said the boy would be videotaped while being tortured
for up to two weeks and his body washed in acid to remove evidence
before being disposed of in a marsh in Maryland.
   The investigation began in February when an undercover California
police officer tapped into a computer bulletin board system
``designed to assist people seeking contact with others interested
in diverse sexual pursuits,'' according to a court affidavit
unsealed in Richmond on Monday.
   The officer placed a message in the bulletin board seeking
individuals interested in children. Lambey, a real estate agent,
responded, saying he liked boys between the ages of 8 and 13, and
was interested in making a sexually explicit movie with children,
the document said.
   Lambey said in a telephone conversation with the police officer
that ``I think the pleasure of doin' it would be worth it,'' the
affidavit said.
   San Jose, Calif., Police Chief Joseph McNamara, whose officers
were involved in the probe, called the case a ``model of national
law enforcement cooperation'' and singled out three undercover men
for praise.
   Authorities said the California officers traveled to Virginia
several times and met with the suspects, discussing the purchase of
the child for use in the video, before contacting federal officials
who took over the case.
   Hudson said ``FBI agents from Richmond and Washington followed
them 24 hours a day to make sure no child or citizen was placed in
danger.''
   Depew, who works as a computer clerk, stored detailed
descriptions of his sadomasochistic acts under the heading of
``vital info'' on an office computer, the affidavit said.
   The two men face life in prison if convicted, Hudson said.

<HEAD>Five Groups File Suit Seeking Use Of Devices To Protect Turtles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five conservation organizations sued Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher, claiming he is legally bound to require
that shrimpers use devices protecting endangered sea turtles from
drowning in their nets.
   Mosbacher suspended the regulations on the turtle excluder
devices after shrimpers, angry about having to use devices they
claim reduce their catch by as much as one-third, blockaded shipping
channels along the Texas Gulf Coast.
   Under a court order to protect endagered sea turtles in a
separate lawsuit filed by the National Wildlife Federation,
Mosbacher then ordered shrimpers who don't use devices to limit
their trawling times to 105 minutes.
   The latest lawsuit, filed late Monday in U.S. District Court,
seeks to force Mosbacher to resume enforcement of the suspended
regulations.
   The principal known cause of death for the endangered or threated
sea turtles of breeding or sub-adult age is drowning in shrimp nets,
the lawsuit said. The Commerce Department estimates more than 11,000
sea turtles will drown annually in the nets of American shrimp
fishermen who do not use the excluder device.
   Comment on the lawsuit was not immediately available from the
Commerce Department today.
   ``Defendant's action in suspending the ... regulations and
replacing them with ineffective, inadequate interim regulations is
causing irreparable harm to plaintiffs and their members by
depriving them of the opportunity to study, observe, photograph and
otherwise use and enjoy living sea turtles on their nesting beaches
and in coastal waters,'' the suit said.
   The five conservation groups say suspension of the regulations
and the limited trawls ``fail to provide for the effective
conservation'' of five endangered species of sea turtles.
   Mosbacher's actions were taken in ``disregared of the clear
requirements'' of several laws, including the Endangered Species Act
and the National Environmental Policy Act, the lawsuit said.
   Filing the lawsuit are the Environmental Defense Fund, National
Audubon Society, Center for Marine Conservation, Greenpeace-U.S.A.,
and Defenders of Wildlife.

   Victoria Brucker is a Little League
slugger with pierced ears and shoulder-length hair.
   Victoria is the leading home-run hitter for San Pedro, Calif.,
one of eight teams competing in the Little League World Series this
week. She's also the first American girl to play in the series,
which also will have its first woman umpire.
   ``She's just one of the guys,'' said Victoria's teammate James
Santos.
   But while the rest of the team sleeps in a bunkhouse on the
Little League complex, Victoria stays with a chaperone at a nearby
hotel.
   Victoria, a first baseman, led San Pedro with nine home runs as
the 12-year-olds advanced to win the Western Regional title and a
spot in the series. She also pitches on occasion.
   ``It's fun,'' said the shy right-hander.
   Betty Speziale, a 35-year-old mother of two from Dunkirk, N.Y.,
drew the assignment of umpiring at first base for today's World
Series opener between Far East champion Kaohsiung, Taiwan, and
European champion Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
   ``I'm not here to be the first woman. I'm here because I worked
at it and they gave me a chance,'' said Speziale. ``It's a dream
come true.''
   Victoria is the second girl to play in the 43 years the Little
League World Series has been held.
   Victoria Roche, a substitute for European champion Brussels,
Belgium, was the first in 1984.
   Players on San Pedro's team said opposing pitchers learn quickly
not to take the 5-foot-3, 137-pound girl lightly.
   ``They just pitch her fastballs and she hits them out. They think
she's a girl so they just pitch fastballs,'' said Anthony Pesusich,
a backup third baseman.
   Lately, though, she has been gaining respect.
   In one of San Pedro's 17 tournament games en route to the Little
League World Series, the opposing team walked her intentionally
after she hit a home run.
   ``She's pretty good,'' San Pedro Manager Joe Dileva said.
   For her part, Victoria appears most excited about her first trip
out of state.
   ``Who would have thought in the first trip out of state to be in
the World Series?'' she asked.
   San Pedro opens in the World Series Wednesday against Southern
Regional champion Tampa, Fla., at 2 p.m. Victoria said she doesn't
remember exactly how she started playing baseball, but she began
competitively at age 9. She said she wants to continue playing
competitively with Senior League next year.
   Victoria's 8-year-old younger brother, Adam, plays baseball.
Younger sisters Veronia, 10, and Audrey, 8, play softball.
   Last year, Victoria watched the Western Regional finals between
teams from Hawaii and Idaho.
   ``I thought it would be pretty nice getting in there,'' she said.
   Little League doesn't keep records on how many girls play
baseball in the program. Little League also offers softball for
girls.
   Creighton J. Hale, Little League president, said teams send
rosters to the headquarters but many have only first initials and
some first names could be boys or girls.
   ``We don't see many girls at high-level tournament play,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Disbarred Lawyer Again Mum Before Senate Impeachment Panel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disbarred lawyer William Borders today refused
for a third time to testify in the impeachment trial of federal
Judge Alcee L. Hastings and was warned that his silence would mean a
return to jail.
   ``We do not have any interest in putting you in jail, but that is
the established procedure,'' Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., told Borders
after the one-time political power broker refused to answer
questions.
   A Senate committee is gathering evidence against Hastings, a
52-year-old federal judge from Florida accused of plotting with
Borders to obtain a $150,000 payoff and lying about it to a jury
that acquitted him in 1983. He also is charged with improper
disclosure of wiretap information.
   Once the panel finishes its report, the Senate will vote on
whether to remove Hastings from the bench and thus take away his
$89,500 salary. The House impeached him last year.
   Borders served 33 months in federal prison following his 1982
conviction on the conspiracy charge. He has been disbarred and shorn
of the considerable political influence officials say he wielded
here in the late 1970s.
   He was arrested in October 1981 as he pulled out of a suburban
Virginia motel with a garment bag packed with $125,000 and a retired
FBI agent masquerading as a racketeer by his side.
   Borders refused to answer questions from the Senate committee on
July 24 and July 27, even though he already had been granted
immunity from prosecution. He said requiring him to testify would
violate his constitutional rights, including his 5th Amendment right
against self-incrimination.
   A court on Aug. 17 directed him to return to the Senate committee
and answer its questions or face jail for contempt of court.
   Specter, the only senator on hand for today's session, appeared
to be irritated when Borders sought to fence with him verbally over
legal technicalities. Borders questioned why it was necessary to ask
10 questions when it was clear he would not answer.
   ``When we're dealing with the integrity of a federal judge
perhaps no number of questions would be excessive,'' Specter said.
   Borders also complained that he should not have to answer
questions because a quorum of the 12-member committee was not
present.
   But Specter reminded him that before Congress went on its August
break, the panel agreed that one lawmaker would constitute a quorum
for purposes of hearing testimony from Borders.

Soviet Union in 1940 was an ``international crime.''
   The report by a commission of the republic's Supreme Soviet, or
parliament, was published in the official press on the eve of the
50th anniversary of the 1939 agreement between Stalin's Soviet Union
and Adolf Hitler's Germany that led to Soviet annexation of
Lithuania and its sister Baltic states, Latvia and Estonia.
   Thousands of Lithuanians were expected to gather later today for
a rally in the capital, Vilnius, to mark the anniversary. On
Wednesday, organizers are predicting that 1.5 million Baltic
residents will form a human chain from Tallinn, Estonia, on the Gulf
of Finland to the Polish border.
   ``The realization of the illegal German-Soviet agreements of
1939-1941 constitute an international crime,'' said the published
report.
   ``Elimination of the consequences are not only an internal matter
of the U.S.S.R., but a matter of Europe and the entire society of
world governments.''
   The agreements ``pre-determined a loss of sovereignty and
independence of the Lithuanian republic, and its forced inclusion in
the U.S.S.R.,'' said the report, which later will go before the full
parliament.
   A commission of the Congress of Peoples Deputies national
parliament in Moscow also has investigated the pact and in a
preliminary draft said it should be declared ``null and void.''
   But it stopped short of criticizing the incorporation of the
then-independent Baltic states into the Soviet Union.
   The Lithuanian report goes much further than Moscow has been
willing to go and reflects how strong the grassroots reform
movement, Sajudis, and its backers have become in the republic.
   Soviet Communist Party Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev, in
an interview with the party newspaper Pravda, said last week there
was no connection between the secret protocol under which Stalin and
Hitler divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence and
Lithuania's decision to join the Soviet Union.
   Yakovlev is a close adviser to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
the Soviet Communist Party's chief ideologist. He also is chairman
of the national commission on the Stalin-Hitler agreement.
   However, at a news conference in Vilnius, the Lithuania Communist
Party's chief ideologist, Justas Paleckis, told reporters that,
``All Lithuania is striving for sovereignty and independence _ we
aren't afraid of that word.''
   He said independence could not be achieved soon, and the exact
nature of it remains to be determined.

   Forecasters today upgraded Tropical Storm Erin to
hurricane status but said the season's third hurricane continued to
pose little threat to land.
   A report from a ship that passed near Erin's center led
forecasters today to upgrade the mid-Atlantic storm to a hurricane
with 75 mph winds, the National Hurricane Center said.
   The ship relayed its observations after the storm pushed through
a low-pressure trough that boosted its strength, forecasters said.
Earlier in the day, the storm's winds had been estimated at only 45
mph.
   Erin's center was located at 10 a.m. EDT about 1,100 miles
southwest of the Azores near 29.7 north latitude and 44.7 west
longitude, said forecasters at the hurricane center in suburban
Coral Gables.
   The system moving north-northwest at about 17 mph was given
little chance of making it to the United States as a hurricane,
forecasters said.
   While the hurricane posed no danger to land, it was touching
shipping lanes.
   ``It's like the I-95 of the ocean between Bermuda and Puerto
Rico,'' said Bob Ebaugh, weather service specialist, referring to
the interstate highway that runs along the East Coast.
   The weather service routinely requests information from ships
sailing within 300 nautical miles of a storm, he said.
   Erin formed as a tropical depression Friday off Africa and became
a named storm Sunday night when sustained winds reached 39 mph.
Hurricanes are formed when winds hit 74 mph.
   There have been seven depressions in the current Atlantic
hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Before Erin,
four had become named storms and two of those had developed into
hurricanes.

Swedish media reported.
   The doctor, 62, was shot five times at the Bjorkhagen private

   Police declined to comment on the case.
   The Swedish national news agency TT quoted the suspect as telling
police he was going blind and the doctor was ``a crook.''
   The patient, who had no appointment, walked into the doctor's

   The Bush administration said today it
is ready to provide a wide array of assistance to help Colombia
battle drug lords, but it reiterated that U.S. troops are not an
option.
   President Bush did not offer Colombian President Virgilio Barco
Vargas military assistance in a telephone call Monday night, ``nor
did President Barco request it,'' said White House spokeswoman Alixe
Glen.
   Barco, during his conversation with the vacationing president,
reinforced earlier statements by Bush aides that U.S. troops would
not be dispatched to Colombia, according to a White House statement
issued late Monday.
   ``We are always prepared to give Colombia the assistance and
support they request'' short of sending U.S. troops, Ms. Glen said
at a news briefing today.
   However, she said Barco's government has not said what additional
help it wants. ``There haven't been any specific requests for
anything other than what the United States has been doing,'' she
said.
   ``We'll provide training, research, operations like that,'' Ms.
Glen said. She said one possibility would be to give Colombian
judges the same anti-terrorist training given to U.S. diplomats _ if
such help were requested by Colombia.
   U.S. officials said one of the biggest helps to Barco's crackdown
on drug traffickers may be the promise to begin extradition
proceedings against drug figures wanted in the United States.
   ``They (drug lords) fear extradition and they don't want to be
prosecuted in the United States. It's a real weapon he (Barco) can
use,'' said presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Monday's White House statement said Bush called Barco to express
condolences over the assassination last week of the leading
Colombian presidential candidate, Luis Carlos Galan.
   ``The president assured President Barco of his strong support,
and expressed his admiration for the steps he has taken to restore
law and order,'' the statement said.
   And, while the statement said the Bush administration would
``render appropriate assistance as rapidly as possible,'' it added:
   ``President Barco indicated he had read press speculation about
the use of U.S. troops in Colombia. He affirmed to the president
that U.S. troops would not be necessary.''
   Earlier, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu voiced a similar
view.
   ``I think the tradition in the Western Hemisphere has been a
reluctance on the part of anybody to ask for troops and I think
there's a reluctance on the part of the president to commit troops
unless the situations are extreme,'' Sununu told reporters.
   Sununu, whose Monday meeting with Bush included a discussion of
the president's upcoming anti-drug plan, said the United States has
no plans to use U.S. troops to combat drug trafficking in Colombia
or anywhere else in South America.
   His comments seemed an effort to soften Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh's suggestion Sunday that the United States should
consider sending military troops to Colombia if requested by the
government of that violence-torn nation.
   Bush today again had no public events on his schedule as he
enjoys a vacation marked by morning jogs, tennis, boating and golf.
   First lady Barbara Bush, however, was returning to Washington for
an eye examination at Walter Reed Army Hospital for a lingering
condition stemming from Graves disease, a thyroid imbalance.
   Despite treatment earlier this year with radioactive iodine, Mrs.
Bush continues to be troubled by eye irritation and some double
vision, aides said.
   Sununu said Bush's anti-drug package, which the president will
unveil in a televised speech to the nation Sept. 5 from the Oval
Office, is largely complete.
   The aide put the final price tag at from $7.5 billion to $8
billion. To a large extent, the program will involve shuffling funds
from existing anti-drug programs into expanded new ones.
   The program also will call for $1 billion to $2 billion in new
annual federal spending.
   Sununu said the plan's focus is on the domestic side.
   ``It involves dealing with the issues associated with law
enforcement within our country, with rehabilitation assistance to
those who are addicted to drugs.''
   ``It deals with programs on education, and that's the primary
thrust. But there is a component of additional assistance for
countries around the world that may ask for some economic aid ... to
allow them to fight the problem,'' Sununu said.

   Police today arrested nine
white anti-apartheid activists in Durban, and witnesses said
authorities used tear gas to break up student protests of next
month's segregated elections.
   Conflict between police and activists has escalated over the past
few days as a mass defiance campaign against apartheid laws and
emergency restrictions spread to most major cities.
   Anti-apartheid groups today mounted the greatest number of
protests since they began the campaign earlier this month. Protest
organizers announced plans to extend the civil disobedience to
whites-only schools.
   Police arrested the activists outside city hall in the port city
of Durban while they were tying yellow ribbons around palm trees and
handing out pamphlets calling for an end to mandatory military
service for white males.
   The activists belong to the End Conscription Campaign, which
vowed Monday to operate openly though it is banned by the white-led
government.
   Police arrested five people Monday at a demonstration by the
organization, which seeks a system of alternative national service
for white men who don't want to serve in the military.
   In Cape Town, students at several mixed-race and Indian schools
set up barricades of burning tires on streets near their schools.
Students in the mixed-race township of Athlone township also stoned
a fire engine, forcing firefighters to flee.
   At an Indian high school, students used the flagpole to raise the
green, gold and black banner of the outlawed African National
Congress guerrilla movement. Students at several schools hung
banners calling for a boycott of the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections
that exclude the black majority.
   Police used tear gas to disperse the demonstrators at four
schools, witnesses said.
   A number of leading anti-apartheid groups have unilaterally
declared themselves ``unbanned'' as part of the defiance campaign,
which began Aug. 2. The organizers say they are mounting non-violent
protests to end segregation of hospitals, neighborhoods, schools,
beaches and other facilities.
   Police have responded by banning or breaking up some rallies and
arresting or detaining without charge dozens of activists.
   Hundreds of activists released from detention have been placed
under restriction orders that limit their movements and political
activities.
   A spokesman for Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok said today
that people who violate those orders ``will sooner or later have to
appear in court to answer criminal charges.''
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   The Mass Democratic Movement, a loosely based coalition
organizing the protests, said black teachers and students would
began presenting themselves at whites-only schools in coming days.
The coalition set no exact date or location for the protests.
   Police said a small mine exploded before dawn today at a post
office outside Cape Town. It caused no injuries, and there were no
immediate claims of responsibility.

<HEAD>Man Jumps to His Death After Fireworks Accident Kills Son, 7 Others</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALICANTE, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man distraught by the explosion of a
fireworks-laden car that killed his son and seven others jumped to
his death from a six-story building Tuesday, police said.
   Joaquin Rigal Martinez had been questioned Sunday about the
explosion the previous day, according to a police spokesman in this
southeastern Mediterranean port city.
   Rigal Martinez, 55, had been depressed about the accident, the
spokesman quoted neighbors as saying.
   Alicante province Civil Governor Pedro Valdecantos said the elder
Rigal and his son distributed fireworks for a factory, Pirotecnica
Levantina, which had been ordered closed Aug. 3 for safety
violations.
   The blast occurred in the parking lot of a supermarket in the San
Juan suburb of Alicante, killing Rigal's 22-year-old son; a
23-year-old passenger in the car; and six other people. Thirty were
injured, two seriously.
   The blast, initially believed to be a terrorist car bombing, has
provoked a national debate about fireworks and safety regulations
involving them.
   Thousands of patron saint festivals in towns and cities across
Spain, particularly in the summer, include huge fireworks
spectaculars.

<HEAD>Drop in Durable Goods Orders Indicates Slowing Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for ``big ticket''
durable goods tumbled 1.9 percent in July to the lowest level in
nine months, the government said Tuesday, providing further evidence
of a weakening economy.
   It was the fourth drop this year in the sector, which includes
items, from washing machines to warships, expected to last three or
more years. The sector is considered a bellwether of the economy's
performance.
   The Commerce Department said demand for durable goods totaled a
seasonally adjusted $122.9 billion last month, the lowest level
since October 1988.
   Orders rose faster than expected, increasing 1.4 percent in June.
That followed a 4.5 percent plunge in May, the steepest drop in 10
months. Orders had risen in April and March and fallen in February
and January.
   ``The numbers are up and down, up and down, but overall the downs
outweigh the ups in 1989,''said economist Cynthia Latta of
DRI@McGraw Hill Inc., a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm.
   The latest drop came despite moves by the Federal Reserve Board
since early June to nudge interest rates lower. Earlier, the central
bank had been raising rates to dampen economic vigor and
inflationary pressure.
   The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank panel
controlling short-term interest rates, was meeting privately Tuesday
to set monetary policy through early October.
   Even with the latest sign of sluggishness, most economists said
the Fed would not lower interest rates further anytime soon.
   ``The Fed's focus is on inflation and it's not going to want to
loosen as long as inflation is running between 4.5 percent and 5
percent,'' Latta said.
   Durable goods are among the sectors most sensitive to interest
rates because consumers and businesses usually borrow to buy them.
   ``The durable goods industry is one of the unfortunate casualties
of the Fed's high interest rate policy,'' said economist Lawrence A.
Hunter of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   ``It clearly is time for the Fed to show sympathy ... and to
cease fire by lowering interest rates,'' he said.
   Most of the weakness in July came in military orders, which swing
widely from month to month, and non-electrical machinery, an
important category which includes computers and a wide variety of
industrial equipment.
   Military orders plunged 14.7 percent to $7.6 billion in July
following a 17.4 percent rise in June. Excluding the defense
category, orders fell 0.9 percent in July after an 0.3 percent gain
a month earlier.
   Non-electrical machinery plummeted 9.7 percent last month, the
steepest drop in more than three years, to $21.1 billion. That
followed a 4.8 percent rise in June. The Commerce Department
attributed half the decline to a drop in orders for engines and
turbines.
   In a sign of strength, however, the closely watched non-defense
capital goods sector rose 5.0 percent to $41.1 billion following a
5.1 percent gain in June. Analysts use this category as a barometer
of business investment plans.
   Economist Michael K. Evans, a Washington-based consultant, said
he expected durable goods sales to turn up later this year. Housing
has begun to rebound in response to recent interest rate declines
and that in turn will generate sales of appliances and furniture.
   Also, consumer spending is strengthening now that a surge in
inflation earlier this year has subsided, he said.
   The department offered these other details of July activity:
   _Electrical machinery, up 1.3 percent to $19.8 billion, following
a June gain of 4.8 percent.
   _Primary metals, including steel, up 0.8 percent to $11.9
billion, following a 5.1 percent drop.
   _Transportation equipment, up 2.3 percent to $34.2 billion after
a 0.1 percent drop. A large increase in aircraft orders offset
declines in motor vehicles, shipbuilding and tanks.
   Shipments of durable goods fell 3.0 percent to $118.1 billion in
July, following drops of 1.0 percent in June and 0.3 percent in May.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl escaped a
``possible catastrophe'' Tuesday when a U.S. military jet he was on
aborted takeoff in West Berlin after a bird flew into an engine, a
source close to Kohl said.
   The incident occurred as Kohl was leaving West Berlin's Templehof
airport for Bonn aboard a small two-engine U.S. Air Force jet, the
source said.
   As the plane was rolling down the runway for takeoff, there was a
``tremendous blast'' from an engine, said the source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The American pilot quickly aborted takeoff, ``avoiding a possible
catastrophe,'' the official said.
   Mechanics discovered a bird had flown into one of the engines,
the official said.
   The source said Kohl was shaken by the incident, but the
chancellor appeared calm and jovial at a news conference shortly
after his return to Bonn.
   He had made a brief overnight trip to Berlin to take part in a
conference of historians discussing the start of World War II.
   Kohl normally flies aboard a U.S. military jet between West
Germany and Berlin for protocol reasons. West Berlin is under the
formal administration of the three Western allies: the United
States, Britain and France.

   Four people were killed and 50 wounded in
a night of shelling that followed the Christian commander's offer to
talk peace with Moslem adversaries, police said Tuesday.
   Syria had not replied by Tuesday to Gen. Michel Aoun's proposal,
but its militia allies rejected the offer.
   France dispatched two more warships to the eastern Mediterranean,
bringing the number to eight, including an aircraft carrier. The
French, who governed Lebanon by mandate until 1943, have said their
purpose is to evacuate the 7,000 French nationals in the country if
necessary.
   Police said artillery and rocket exchanges tailed off at dawn and
settled into a pattern of intermittent mortar fire across the line
that divides Moslem west Beirut from the Christian eastern sector.
   By police count, 789 people have been killed and 2,190 wounded in
the artillery war that began March 8 between a Moslem alliance led
by Syria, which has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon, and the 20,000 men
of Aoun's Christian army command. Nearly all the casualties have
been civilians.
   Acting Premier Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem leading a Syrian-backed
Moslem cabinet, issued a statement calling the Maronite Catholic
general's offer ``a mine field. Any response to it is highly
unlikely.''
   Since a political crisis a year ago, the Hoss government has
competed with one led by Aoun.
   On Monday, Druse chieftain Walid Jumblatt described the general's
offer as ``a trick to allow Aoun a breathing spell to rearm and
marshall his forces.''
   A spokesman for Aoun said privately the Syrians were ``under Arab
and international pressure to stop their involvement in Lebanon''
and were ``issuing fake statements on behalf of their allies to give
the impression that Lebanese parties are involved in the conflict,
not them.''
   In an interview published Monday, Aoun expressed willingness to
discuss Lebanon's future with leaders of the other side. He did not
make his customary demand that talks could not begin until Syrian
forces withdrew.
   Syrian troops are in Lebanon under an Arab League mandate issued
in 1976, the year after the beginning of the sectarian civil war, in
which more than 150,000 people have been killed.
   Aoun calls them an occupation army and has declared a ``war of
liberation'' to drive them out.
   U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy met with Aoun and told reporters:
``There's obviously no military solution to the problem for
Lebanon.''
   McCarthy said he met with Aoun to ``emphasize that the military
confrontation is not taking us anywhere,'' and added: ``We are
delivering the same messages to Damascus.''
   Sheik Mohammed Rashid Kabbani, acting religious adviser of
Lebanon's Sunni Moslems, said ``violence cannot produce solutions.''
He cautioned France to use its naval force ``with great wisdom.''
   Defense Ministry sources in Paris said the anti-submarine
destroyer Jean de Vienne and oil supply ship Meuse would join the
six other vessels already sent to the area. They include two other
destroyers and a frigate in addition to the aircraft carrier Foch.
   Syria's militia allies describe the naval buildup as an attempt
by France to reassert dominance over the region.
   Iranian newspapers printed warnings to the West that any
interference in Lebanon would further aggravate the situation.
   Iran backs Moslem extremists believed to hold most of the 16
Western hostages in Lebanon, who include eight Americans, and has
about 2,000 Revolutionary Guards in Syrian-controlled east Lebanon.
   The Nationalist Front, a group of leftist militias allied with
Syria, said its artillerymen fired on six ships before dawn and
prevented them from reaching ports on the Christian-held coast north
of Beirut.
   A Nationalist Front statement said the gunners ``scored direct
hits on the lead ship, forcing the whole group to sail away.'' It
did not identify any of the vessels.
   The spokesman for Aoun's command denied the claim.
   ``To begin with, there were no ships heading to our ports this
morning,'' he said, on condition of anonymity. ``Also, no force in
Lebanon but the Syrian army is capable of detecting and opening fire
at a moving maritime target.''
   Syrian and allied forces have besieged the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave north and east of Beirut since March 12, four days
after the battle began.
   They shell the coast to keep Aoun's forces and the 1 million
Christians in the enclave from receiving supplies. Iraq, the main
Arab foe of Syria, supplies most of Aoun's arms.
   Moslem security sources said the Syrians were providing tanks,
howitzers and mortars to the 22,000 Moslem soldiers led by Maj. Gen.
Sami Khatib and to Jumblatt's Druse militia, Syria's closest ally in
Lebanon.
   One said the Syrians ``have been flooding their allies with
weapons and ammunition for more than a week now. It seems they are
preparing them for a major battle with Aoun.''
   Khatib's forces, poorly equipped, have stayed out of the fighting.

   State Attorney General Charlie Brown has
abruptly resigned in exchange for an end to a grand jury
investigation of allegations that he lied under oath and of his
campaign financial records.
   And today the grand jury indicted a former secretary to Brown on
charges that she tried to extort money from him in exchange for
keeping quiet about allegations that he got her pregnant.
   Under an agreement with Kanawha County Prosecutor Bill Forbes,
Brown cannot discuss his innocence or guilt regarding the grand jury
investigation.
   ``I don't believe in beating dead horses. I believe justice was
done,'' Forbes said at a Monday night news conference.
   ``If you resign from the attorney general's office of the state,
that's a pretty darned harsh penalty,'' Forbes said.
   At a news conference today, Brown said his decision to resign was
based on family obligations, including concerns he had to protect
his young daughter, who is at the center of a child custody dispute
that gave rise to the perjury allegation.
   ``No public official is more important that the office he or she
holds,'' Brown said. ``But my biggest fear was something much worse
_ ublicity about my child's life, welfare and current home
environment.''
   It is the second time this year a major West Virginia state
official has quit amid allegations of misconduct. Treasurer A. James
Manchin, who was accused of mismanaging a state investment fund that
lost an estimated $279 million and was impeached by the House,
resigned last month just before his Senate trial was to begin.
   It also was the second criminal case against Brown since he took
office in 1984.
   Brown's resignation was effective at 5 p.m. Monday.
   ``It was in the best interest of the state, the best interest of
Mr. Brown, and the best interest of all concerned,'' Forbes said.
   Gov. Gaston Caperton will appoint an interim attorney general,
who will serve until the next election.
   Forbes said his office worked ``very intensely'' on the
investigation for four weeks. He said Brown's attorney called his
office about noon Monday and agreed to the arrangement, which Forbes
said the prosecutor's office first offered about a week ago before
the grand jury began meeting.
   Brown, 39, a Democrat, had testified Thursday, Friday and Monday
before the grand jury. Forbes said he had planned to ask for a vote
on charges sometime Monday afternoon or today.
   In 1986, Brown was acquitted on charges that he solicited his
staff for campaign contributions. The jury agreed with his defense
that, because he solicited the contributions after the 1984 election
to help pay off his campaign debts, the actions did not violated a
state law prohibiting state officials from soliciting contributions
for future campaigns.
   The latest grand jury investigation centered on Brown's testimony
in a child custody hearing involving his ex-wife, Alice Sue
Hypes-Brown, and their 5-year-old daughter.
   Forbes has confirmed that the grand jury was looking into a
report that Brown had denied writing a note that was introduced as
evidence in the hearing, then later admitted writing it.
   Brown acknowledged that he denied writing the note but said that
it was a mistake and that he realized it almost immediately. He said
he requested a brief recess, and when the hearing resumed he
corrected his testimony.
   In a statement today, Brown said that even though he had
corrected the statements he made during the hearing, he still would
have faced ``potential months of protracted litigation'' if indicted.
   The Charleston Gazette reported two weeks ago that the note
involved a request for $50,000 from Brown's former secretary, who
the paper said had been impregnated by Brown, had an abortion and
demanded the money to keep quiet.
   The secretary, Brenda K. Simon, 35, of Columbus, Ohio, today was
indicted on one count each of extortion and obtaining money under
false pretenses. The extortion count carries a maximum penalty of
five years in prison, while the false pretenses charge carries a
maximum penalty of 10 years.
   Shortly after the indictment was announced this morning,
attorneys for Simon withdrew a $3 million libel lawsuit against the
Gazette, saying they didn't want the suit to jeopardize Simon's
criminal defense.
   Forbes said he don't know how much money was allegedly extorted,
saying reports have varied from $7,500 to $50,000.
   There was no immediate comment from Simon; telephone calls to her
home went unanswered.
   In addition, the grand jury subpoenaed Brown's campaign records
from 1984 through 1988.
   Brown's brother, Sherrod Brown, is Ohio's secretary of state.

<HEAD>Report: One Arrested in Adamson Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One person was arrested in the slaying of
George Adamson, a source at the conservationist's remote camp said
Tuesday, but officials could not confirm the report.
   An army officer at the camp in Kora National Reserve said a
Somali shopkeeper from the nearby town of Mbalambala was arrested
Monday, one day after Adamson died in an encounter with armed
robbers.
   The officer, who declined to be identified by name or rank, said
the suspect had been taken to the police station in the provincial
capital of Garissa for questioning. The army and police are
searching for the killers.
   Officers at the national police headquarters in the capital,
Nairobi, were not immediately available to comment on the report.
Wildlife Director Richard Leakey, who was helping direct the hunt
for Adamson's killers, said he could not confirm an arrest.
   A source with experience in security and wildlife matters said
even if there had been an arrest, it was not certain the man
detained was involved in Adamson's death.
   ``It's happened before that we've arrested people only to find
they're not involved,'' said the source.
   A survivor of the attack, in which two of Adamson's assistants
also were slain, identified the shopkeeper as one of the assailants,
the officer in Kora said.
   Adamson, 83, gained international fame for his efforts along with
his wife, Joy, to return lions to the wild. Their exploits were
detailed in the film ``Born Free'' and in a sequel, ``Living Free.''
   Both movies were based on books by Joy Adamson, who was killed at
the northwestern Shaba game reserve in 1980 by servant she had
dismissed on suspicion of theft.
   Adamson had lived at the Kora reserve since 1971 helping dozens
of lions learn to survive in the African bush before turning them
loose.
   He and Joy, who separated in the 1960s, had no children.

<HEAD>Soviets Expect 200,000 to Emigrate This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 200,000 Soviets are expected to emigrate this
year and more than 2 million will make visits abroad because of
eased travel restrictions, the head of the country's visa agency
said Tuesday.
   About 107,000 Soviets already have received permission to leave
for good this year, said Rudolf Kuznetsov, head of the agency known
as UVIR.
   The agency also approved 1,700,000 applications for visits abroad
in the first six months of 1989, three times the number for all of
1987, he said.
   Most of the emigrants go to the United States and West Germany.
   The strict Soviet restrictions on travel and emigration have long
been a target of censure from the West. Tens of thousands of Jews
and other Soviets were refused exit visas, becoming known as
``refuseniks,'' and the U.S. Congress linked tariffs on imported
Soviet goods with emigration to try to pressure the Soviets to let
more people out.
   Now, Kuznetsov said at a briefing, fewer than 1 percent of
applications are turned down, and almost always for reasons of
secrecy. Those refused say officials still apply the criterion of
secrecy arbitrarily.
   A draft law on the liberalization of Soviet travel control is
almost ready to be submitted to the legislature, which will meet
next month. It brings Soviet emigration rules closer in line with
Western practice but still requires would-be emigres to receive an
invitation from a firm, friend or relative.
   ``Lots of our citizens don't know the language and other
things,'' he said, ``and they should at least be met by someone.''
   In general, however, the new law takes the approach of ``Let's
assume that all our people are honorable people,'' instead of
meriting only suspicion and tight control, Kuznetsov said.
   He cautioned that even with passage of the law, Soviet travel
would still be subject to technical snarls and red tape.
   International tickets on Aeroflot, the Soviet airline, are in
such hot demand that people must wait months and even years to buy
them. They also have to wait days or weeks in line to change rubles
into dollars or other hard currency.
   ``We held people back for a long time, and now we're resolving
things, but give us time to solve a series of technical problems,''
Kuznetsov said.
   U.S. Embassy officials say Soviets are registering their intent
to emigrate to the United States at an annual rate of 120,000.
   About 50,000 have left this year for West Germany, primarily
ethnic Germans.
   President Bush has said if the Soviets enact the proposed changes
in the travel law, he will urge Congress to pass a one-year waiver
of the amendment that links the tariffs with emigration.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Najib said Tuesday the Afghan
people are tired of the 11-year-old civil war and his Marxist
government ``is prepared to accept any suggestion'' that will end it.
   In outlining a new peace plan, he called for an international
peace conference attended by Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, India and
China, with the United States and Soviet Union as guarantors of an
agreement.
   His plan includes elections six months after a cease-fire, does
not meet demands by Moslem guerrillas that the 42-year-old former
intelligence chief step down.
   ``Our people are fed up with the continuation of this war of
attrition ... in which innocent people are dying. The government of
Afghanistan is prepared to accept any suggestion toward a peaceful
settlement,'' Najib told reporters at the Gulkhana presidential
palace.
   Western experts had predicted the U.S.-supported guerrillas would
oust Najib's government soon after Soviet military forces withdrew
on Feb. 15. Six months later, they have failed twice to capture
Jalalabad, 75 miles east of Kabul, and are squabbling among
themselves.
   Kabul government officials said the Najib plan makes a new
concession to the guerrillas: Talks on forming a broad-based
Consultative Council would be held before a cease-fire rather than
after, to quiet suspicion that the government would not negotiate in
good faith.
   A six-month truce leading to elections would begin when the
council was established. The council would organize a broad-based
coalition government to draft a new constitution and electoral law,
which would be approved by a traditional Loyah Jirga, or grand
assembly of prominent Afghans.
   Guerrilla leaders have rejected previous government peace plans
because all include Najib and his ruling Communist Party in a
coalition.
   Najib said he was ready to give up the presidency and even his
life to achieve peace, but added that ignoring the reality of the
party, armed forces and current situation in Afghanistan would only
``intensify the war.''
   ``Billions of dollars have been spent here,'' he said. ``All
kinds of deadly weapons have been accumulated here. Are all these
efforts to get Najib to step aside? Does that mean all the
atrocities committed in the country are just to get rid of Najib?
   ``In our opinion, instead of talking about the removal of the
party or the person, let's talk about the participation of people
and parties in trying to achieve peace,``
   Najib claimed the United States was supplying rockets with
cluster bombs to the guerrillas, and was guilty of the ``mass
massacre'' of civilians as a result.
   He also said judgments about the Afghan government by other
nations, including those in the West, were ``being radically
changed.''
   ``We are confident that ... even the U.S. administration is
realizing the futility of the continuation of war and will consider
the realities of Afghan society as a basis for making new
policies,'' he declared.
   If the guerrillas ``honestly want a settlement of the problem,
and they say they control 85 percent of the country,'' he said,
``why are they afraid of elections? Why are they using rockets of
mass killing?''
   Najib said the United States and Pakistan believed the
U.N.-mediated agreement ended with the Soviet withdrawal, ``but the
main issue was to stop intervention in Afghanistan and provide for
the return of Afghan refugees.''
   ``If all sides remain faithful to the provisions of the Geneva
agreement, it is my opinion that peace soon will prevail in our
country,'' he said.
   At an international conference, Najib said, ``we are ready, that
if prestigious and credible international guarantees are given, we
can tackle questions of the permanent neutrality of Afghanistan and
the demilitarization of the country.''
   The Geneva agreement was signed by Afghanistan and Pakistan,
where about 3.5 million Afghan refugees live and many guerrillas are
based, with the United States and Soviet Union as guarantors.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April
1978. Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and an
estimated 115,000 were in the country when the withdrawal began on
May 15, 1988.

   Astronomers who predicted that Neptune
would not have rings were surprised to discover a faint but complete
ring around the planet today in pictures sent by Voyager 2.
   Researchers first hailed the image on Voyager's photos as the
rediscovery of the ``ghost arc,'' a partial ring identified by the
Voyager 2 spacecraft on Aug. 11, but further analysis showed that
the arc was a continuous ring around the planet.
   ``It is Neptune's first ring,'' said Bradford Smith, leader of
the spacecraft imaging team. ``The inner arc, the one we were unable
to find since the discovery (Aug. 11) images, is there, and it is
continuous, all the way around.''
   Voyager, launched in 1977, is in the final stages of its 4.4
billion-mile trip to Neptune. It will pass by the outermost planet
at 8:55 p.m. PDT Thursday, beaming images back to Earth.
   Observations of Neptune from Earth had led astronomers to predict
that the planet would be encircled by ring arcs _ partial rings. The
newly discovered ring is so faint that it was not visible from Earth
or from earlier Voyager photographs, Smith said.
   ``It just isn't enough material to be detected from the ground,''
he said.
   The ring appeared in a series of 16 photographs of the arc
region. They included better views of the other arc discovered Aug.
11. Researchers said that they expect to find more arcs as Voyager
passes behind Neptune and scans the arc region while it is lit from
behind by the sun.
   Ring arcs, unlike anything seen around the other planets, are
composed of debris that could be the remnants of moons torn apart by
gravitational forces or collisions, researchers said.
   Voyager's observations of Neptune on Monday revealed a churning,
turbulent atmosphere, with huge white clouds of frozen natural gas,
and a string of storms trailing behind an Earth-sized cyclone.
   One small collection of clouds called the ``scooter'' is whirling
around the planet's surface once every 16 hours, faster than
anything else so far seen on Neptune, said Bradford Smith, head of
the Voyager imaging team.
   Photographs of the planet's biggest moon, Triton, show it is
brighter, cooler and smaller than scientists had thought. Smith said
the shots suggest Triton may be partly covered with snow and frozen
water.
   ``It may snow there from time to time,'' he said Monday.
   The pictures also show dark spots near Triton's equator and a
pinkish cast that may be from discolored frozen natural gas, or
methane. Researchers had speculated that Triton might have oceans of
liquid nitrogen, but Smith said any such oceans would have to be
frozen over.
   ``Triton is an especially intriguing object,'' Smith said. ``It's
in the wrong orbit. It's going backwards around Neptune. Something
truly catastrophic must have happened some time in its past.''
   Scientists believe Triton could have been a comet that collided
with one of Neptune's moons because it rotates in the opposite
direction from the planet, unlike most moons in the solar system.
   Edward Stone, the Voyager project scientist, said such a
collision could have slowed Triton enough to allow it to become
trapped in a long, oval orbit around Neptune. As that orbit
gradually became more circular, tidal forces would have caused the
moon to heat, perhaps turning Triton into a ball of molten rock and
water for 1 billion years, he said.
   If that were the case, more detailed photographs later this week
should show that Triton has fewer meteorite craters than it
otherwise would have.
   ``It's very difficult right now to say anything about what's
going on on Triton,'' Smith said.
   Voyager continued to snap pictures of Neptune and Triton today as
it moved toward its closest encounter with Neptune at 8:55 p.m. PDT
Thursday, when it will pass 3,000 miles from the planet.
   It also searched for auroral lights over Neptune's south pole and
made further observations of Neptune's weather and variations in
brightness on Triton's surface.
   The pictures of Triton showed it has a diameter of 1,740 miles,
about four-fifths the size of Earth's moon and about half the size
scientists previously thought.
   Researchers puzzled over the unexpected discovery of the intense
weather on Neptune.
   ``Neptune is an extremely dynamic planet'' with weather
resembling Jupiter's but ``with less than 50 percent of Jupiter's
energy,'' Smith said.
   New photographs show that the Great Dark Spot, an Earth-sized
cyclone discovered earlier by Voyager, is leaving in its wake a long
tail of swirling storms.
   Voyager observed winds on Uranus similar to those now being seen
on Neptune, but without the turbulence.
   Neptune contains more heat than Uranus, and the turbulence could
be the result of warmer material bubbling up from deep inside the
mostly liquid planet, Smith said.
   On Aug. 13, scientists issued their first weather forecast for
Neptune, predicting with fairly close accuracy where the Great Dark
Spot would be last Sunday.
   ``It's not perfect, but weather forecasting isn't a perfect
science,'' Smith said.
   James Warwick, the scientist in charge of radio astronomy aboard
Viking, estimated that Neptune's day _ the time it takes to complete
one rotation on its axis _ is 16 hours.
   That estimate was based on observations of intense bursts of
radio waves every 16 hours from Neptune's magnetic field, which
varies with the planet's rotation.
   Smith said observations of the atmosphere suggest that Neptune's
day may be longer than 16 hours. Warwick emphasized that his
estimate was only a preliminary calculation.

   Funeral directors and families now may make
burial arrangements during weekends and holidays at national
cemeteries, the Department of Veterans Affairs has announced.
   Under a new policy in effect for the 113 cemeteries operated by
VA, calls made outside of the normal business week will be referred
to staffs at three major national cemeteries that are open every day
of the year.
   The three cemeteries are at Riverside, Calif., Calverton, N.Y.,
and Jefferson Barracks near St. Louis, Mo.
   VA Secretary Edward J. Derwinski said the change will prevent
delays in making cemetery arrangements when a death occurs late in
the week or on a weekend or holiday.
   The National Cemetery System is expected to provide burials for
more than 58,000 eligible veterans and family members this year, VA
said in its announcement last week.

   The Environmental Protection Agency began
filing lawsuits today in nearly a dozen states against demolition
companies that allegedly failed to take proper precautions while
working on asbestos-ridden buildings.
   Civil lawsuits were filed by the Justice Department in eight
cities and additional court papers were expected to be filed later
in the day naming a total of 34 defendants in connection with
violations of asbestos removal requirements, the EPA said.
   ``Today's coast-to-coast effort to punish violators is a message
to those who ignore the law,'' said Henry Habicht, EPA deputy
administrator. ``Asbestos is a known cause of cancer in humans, and
it can be a killer.''
   Habicht said the agency intends to enforce requirements for
safety measures when dealing with asbestos removal by seeking civil
penalties from companies that do not comply with the safeguards.
Fines could range up to $25,000 for each violation.
   The EPA officials declined to name all the defendants until the
court papers were filed. The eight lawsuits filed today involved
work on school buildings in Missouri, Kansas and Washington state as
well as various buildings from warehouses to restaurants in
Virginia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Nevada.
   Papers also were being prepared for civil action involving work
on at least 80 school buildings in New York City, officials said.
   Federal law requires certain precautions when removing asbestos
from buildings so that its microscopic fibers are not spread through
the air. Violators can be subject to up to $25,000 fine per
violation and face criminal prosecution in some cases.
   The inhalation of asbestos fibers is known to cause lung cancer,
asbestosis, a scarring of the lung, and mesothelioma, a cancer of
the chest and abdomen. Asbestos was used in past years in insulation
and other building materials.
   Improper removal practices pose health risks to construction
workers and people who return to the building or to other nearby
buildings since asbestos particles often linger in the air for a
long time, EPA officials said.
   The EPA estimates that up to half of all asbestos-involved
renovations may be done without the precautions required by the
federal Clean Air Act.
   The EPA officials said none of the new actions involves criminal
charges, but that civil penalties in some of the cases could be over
$250,000.
   Agency sources, who asked not to be identified by name, said
papers were also to be filed later in the day as a result of
violations in New York, California and Florida.
   The projects cited include work on at least 80 New York City
school buildings; public schools in Woodinville and Kent, Wash.; a
high school in Kansas City, Mo.; a junior high school in Holyrood,
Kan.; and colleges in Pittsburg, Kan., and Berea, Ohio.
   In one case, a contractor was being cited for transporting wine
tanks by helicopter from a winery in San Jose, Calif., without
removing asbestos insulation pads, causing asbestos particles to
scatter over miles of countryside.
   Other cases involved a Nevada casino; an apartment building in
Philadelphia; a boiler room at the Marine Corps base at Quantico,
Va.; the Seattle-Tacoma Airport, and two Seattle restaurants.
   The EPA crackdown comes only weeks after a Harvard University
study indicated that in many cases the improper removal of asbestos
from buildings may pose more of a health risk than leaving the
material in the building.
   The study by Harvard's Energy and Environmental Policy Center
suggested that if precautions are not taken the ``removal of
asbestos may actually increase exposure to building occupants'' as
well as workers involved in the renovation.
   The EPA has estimated that more than 730,000 commercial buildings
in the country still contain some asbestos material. Last year it
received about 50,000 notifications of renovation projects involving
asbestos, and that number is expected to increase by about 30
percent this year, according to agency officials.
   By law, the EPA must be notified when renovation or demolitions
involve buildings containing asbestos.

   A burned-out cabin light on a United
Airlines 727 emitted smoke shortly after takeoff today, forcing the
plane carrying 115 passengers to return to San Francisco airport,
airline officials reported.
   ``There was no fire, just smoke,'' said United spokesman Joe
Hopkins from the airline's Chicago headquarters. Earlier reports
from airport tower officials had said there was a fire on board.
   Hopkins said the smoke stopped when the plane's captain turned
off the electricity in the area of the light.
   ``The passenger reaction was quite good,'' said Hopkins. ``In
fact, one passenger joked and said he thought this was a no-smoking
flight.''
   The plane had just taken off for Los Angeles when the emergency
happened. It turned around near San Jose, a few minutes out of San
Francisco, and landed back in San Francisco about 9 a.m. and taxied
to the gate, where passengers were let off, said tower spokesman Joe
Pitts.
   The incident was under investigation by emergency personnel and
the Federal Aviation Administration, airport administration
officials reported.

<HEAD>Judge Hears Ringo Tape in Suit To Block Release of Ex-Beatle's Album</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A recording by Ringo Starr debuted in court
Tuesday, blaring from a boom box as a judge weighed whether the song
would be a $3.5 million hit or is an alcohol-marred embarrassment,
as the ex-Beatle claims.
   Music industry executives have said the record would be a
``guaranteed No. 1 hit,''an attorney for Memphis, Tenn., producer
Chips Moman said as he played the tape for Fulton County Superior
Court Judge Clarence Cooper.
   The song, ``I Can Help,'' is one of 14 Starr recorded with Moman
in 1987. Moman wants to release an album to coincide with Starr's
current smash U.S. concert tour, but Starr says he is unhappy with
his performance and the album would hurt his reputation.
   Cooper did not rule immediately on whether to extend a 30-day
order blocking the record's release. The restraining order expires
Thursday.
   The judge, after telling attorney Thomas Washburn to ``turn it
down,'' listened patiently to Starr's upbeat rendition of Billy
Swan's 1975 hit.
   Starr, who recently completed a much-publicized treatment for
alcoholism, also objects to ``Whiskey and Soda,'' a part of the
collection, his attorney, Robert O. Fleming Jr., said Tuesday.
   ``That is not a song Mr. Starr is eager to have released on an
album with his name and his picture on the cover,'' Fleming said.
   Alcoholism ``is an addiction he was suffering from when this
music was recorded,'' Fleming said of his client.
   Neither Starr nor Moman attended Tuesday's hearing.
   Though Starr continued to enjoy high recognition, his recording
career had stagnated when he came to Moman in 1987, Washburn said.
Moman, whose work includes producing Elvis Presley in the late
1960s, has a reputation for reviving careers, he said.
   ``The point is this: Two people came together for the purpose of
resurrecting a career,'' Washburn said. ``This album would do this
for Ringo Starr. Ringo Starr hasn't had a hit since 1975.''
   Washburn said the album, if released now while Starr is on tour,
could make $3.5 million.
   Fleming claimed, however, that the album would hurt Starr at a
time when his career has been boosted by his tour with his
``All-Starr Band.'' Fleming said that while the record features
Starr singing, he does not play drums on it.
   ``All an artist has is his style, his name, his professional
reputation and his image,'' Fleming said. ``Here, we've got an album
with one of the most famous drummers in music history and he's not
playing drums. He doesn't want that.''
   Moman has contended he invested $146,239 in the Starr project,
and said he rejected an offer by Starr of $100,000 to kill the album.

   Relatives of those killed on Pan Am
Flight 103 met Tuesday with police officers investigating the
bombing of the New York-bound flight and said they were confident
the killers would soon be found.
   Bert Ammerman, U.S. president of the Victims of Pan Am Flight
103, called it ``the most positive meeting we have had so far.''
   ``I am very, very confident after this meeting that the
terrorists, the people who carried this out, are going to be
identified and the next stage is to try to apprehend them,'' he said.
   ``The police are very confident it is going to take place and the
terrorists are going to be identified, we hope in the very near
future.''
   Asked why he though police would soon identify the bombers,
Ammerman replied: ``You are not naive enough and I am not naive
enough to think that they (the police) are going to give us
information about the criminal investigation.
   ``There was a specific overview which makes us feel everything is
being done and done most appropriately,'' he said.
   Ammerman stayed Monday night with the Rev. Patrick Keegans, a
Roman Catholic priest whose Lockerbie house was destroyed when parts
of the jumbo jet crashed on the southern Scottish town on Dec. 21,
1988. All 259 people aboard were killed along with 11 people on the
ground.
   Ammerman and five other Americans were accompanied by Jim Squire,
head of the British relatives' group.
   ``Eight months after Lockerbie it appears to us that nothing has
been done to increase security at Heathrow Airport,'' Squire said on
the way into the meeting.
   The relatives had a private meeting with Detective Chief
Superintendent John Orr, the senior investigating officer; George
Esson, Chief Constable of the Dumfries and Galloway regional police
force; and Norman McFadyen, a senior Scottish law officer.
   The relatives later visited a building where the Flight 103
victims' clothing and possessions, not yet returned to next of kin,
were stored.
   They saw rows of cardboard cartons and on top of one, a battered
gray suitcase. Several police officers wearing overalls and
protective gloves were sorting through shirts, shoes and other items
of clothing.
   ``This part was maybe the toughest part of the trip,'' Ammerman
said. ``It was very emotional.''
   On Monday, the relatives met Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson
and junior Transport Minister Michael Portillo who rebuffed their
call for an immediate public inquiry into the gaps in airline
security that allowed the bomb to be placed aboard the plane.
   Portillo said there was a frank exchange of views, but Ammerman
said he told Portillo, ``We are definitely at odds with some of the
statements and the approach'' of his department.
   ``Mr. Portillo is well aware that we are not pleased with his
statements and we were not reassured,'' he said. ``We are not
satisfied on the position that the Department of Transport has taken
regarding the inquiry and regarding airport and airline security.''

<HEAD>Engineer Who Proposed Voyager Path Returns to Lab to Celebrate</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Voyager-Neptune Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The engineer who proposed Voyager 2's
``grand tour'' 24 years ago as an intern at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in California is returning there Thursday to view the
flight past Neptune.
   Gary Flandro, now a professor of mechanical engineering at the
University of Utah, was a graduate student at the California
Institute of Technology in 1965 when he calculated flight paths for
interplanetary space probes.
   Those projections became a central part of the eventual flight
paths and launch dates used by Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, which were
launched in the 1970s.
   Flandro found that by using the gravitational fields of the
planets to redirect the spacecraft and ``slingshot'' it toward the
next planet, the speed and distance traveled by the probes could be
dramatically increased.
   ``At the time, it was thought that if you needed to get to
Neptune, it would be a 40-year flight time,'' he said. ``Using
rocket motors to gain that kind of energy is very costly.''
   The gravity-boost idea isn't new, he said. ``The early
astronomers knew that a comet's energy changes dramatically when it
passes close to a planet.''
   Flandro will be a guest at the Pasadena laboratory Thursday as
former co-workers and friends celebrate and watch Voyager 2 on TV
screens as it comes within 3,000 miles of Neptune. The craft already
has passed by Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
   After leaving Neptune, Voyager will continue into deep space,
relaying pictures and information until its nuclear-powered
generator runs out of fuel in about three decades.
   ``I found that in the early 1980s all of the outer planets would
be on the same side of the sun and aligned so that a space vehicle
could efficiently visit each one,'' he said. This alignment only
happens every 170 years.
   He gave his idea the name it still uses, the ``grand tour''
concept.
   ``I did get it started and did the initial selling to NASA, but
it's really the Jet Propulsion Lab's engineers that made it work,''
he said.
   Voyager 2 has traveled nearly 4.5 billion miles since it was
launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in
1977, using a launch date that almost exactly matched the one
Flandro had calculated 12 years earlier.
   He said Jupiter, by far the largest planet in the solar system,
was the key to the ``grand tour'' plan because of its huge
gravitational field.
   Many of his Caltech colleagues doubted him when he first proposed
the idea because it was thought that any energy a spacecraft gains
as it approaches a planet it would give up as it leaves.
   The exchange of energy takes place at various times during both
the spacecraft's approach and departure, Flandro said, but Voyager
will have substantially more kinetic energy when it leaves than when
it arrived.
   ``The energy is not free,'' he said. ``Jupiter loses a little bit
of its energy as the spacecraft speeds up, but Jupiter is so large
that it doesn't make much difference.''
   Still, he said, there was a group of people who organized a
protest against the initial plan because they thought Jupiter would
fall out of its orbit. ``They called themselves the Pasadena Society
for the Preservation of Jupiter's Orbit, but I guess no one took
them seriously.''

<HEAD>Police Accept Alibi Of `Suspect' For First Set of Serial Killings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who had been dubbed a ``viable suspect''
in the Green River killings was out of town when the series of
murders of prostitutes began, authorities said.
   An investigator said Monday that a task force had confirmed an
alibi offered by William Jay Stevens II, apparently clearing the
onetime law student of at least the first four of the 40 or more
serial murders linked to the mysterious killer.
   King County Police Capt. Robert Evans, head of the task force,
said Stevens was apparently vacationing on the East Coast during
July 1982, when the first victims were killed. His comments were
reported in today's editions of The Seattle Times and were confirmed
by his spokesperson, Cecil Ray.
   ``He's still considered a `person of interest.' He is not being
dropped,'' Ray said today.
   Stevens' family called a news conference in Spokane last week and
produced credit card receipts and photographs to document a family
vacation they said proved Stevens was not in the Seattle area when
the first murders occurred.
   Police have attributed the killings of 40 young women in the
Seattle and Portland, Ore., areas, to one or more killers. The women
disappeared during 1982 through 1984.
   The case takes its name from the south King County river where
the first victims were found. Police say at least 40 and possibly as
many as 48 murders are involved in the nation's worst unsolved
serial murder case.
   Evans said the investigation of Stevens would continue.
   ``This means we appear to have verified one piece of the
equation,'' Evans said. ``We will continue our work until we're
satisfied he has no involvement in any unsolved crimes in King
County.''
   Stevens, a former Gonzaga Law School student, is serving time in
the King County Jail in Seattle for a 1981 escape from work release
after a conviction for possessing stolen property. He is scheduled
for release Sept. 25.
   He was identified as a ``viable suspect'' in an affidavit used
last month to obtain a search warrant of two Spokane residences
where he lived. That search yielded 1,800 videotapes, police
uniforms and extensive credit card records.
   Since the search, investigators have referred to Stevens as a
``person of interest.''
   Stevens has not been arrested or charged in connection with the
Green River killkngs. He issued a statement through his attorney
denying his involvement.

   Workers at the Alamo discovered graffiti that
may have been left by an Alamo defender in 1836 on a door of the
mission.
   ``We found original mission plaster,'' Alamo Curator Steve Beck
said. ``There is graffiti in which the dates 1894 and 1897 are
written in pencil, and the name Mills is inscribed into the surface.
The name is about 4 inches long and 1{ inches tall.''
   The name may have been carved by William Mills of Tennessee, who
was among the 189 men known to have died March 6, 1836, defending
the Alamo in the struggle for Texas independence.
   ``We don't have any solid proof it was William Mills, but it's a
good possibility,'' Beck said.
   Beck and stone mason Baltazar Espinosa discovered the graffiti as
they worked on the north side of the Shrine of Texas Liberty as part
of an ongoing preservation project. The door dates to the early
1700s, Beck said.

   Cinematographer Joseph W. La Shelle, who
worked on ``How the West Was Won'' and ``The Apartment'' and won an
Academy Award for the classic ``Laura,'' has died. He was 89.
   La Shelle died Sunday of natural causes, said his son-in-law,
Dave Gardner.
   La Shelle received several Oscar nominations in a career that
spanned five decades, but won only once, in 1944 for ``Laura.''
   The movie, directed by Otto Preminger and starring Dana Andrews
and Gene Tierney, was about a detective investigating a murder who
fell in love with the victim after seeing her portrait.
   La Shelle began his entertainment career as a laboratory
assistant in 1923. He moved up to assistant cameraman two years
later and made his debut as a cinematographer with the 1943 movie
``Happy Land.''
   He was nominated for Academy Awards for his work on the movies
``My Cousin Rachel,'' ``The Apartment,'' ``How the West Was Won,''
``Irma La Douce,'' ``The Fortune Cookie,'' ``Career,'' ``Come to the
Stable'' and ``River of No Return,'' the latter starring Marilyn
Monroe and Robert Mitchum.
   His last movie was ``Eighty Steps to Jonah,'' in 1969.
   He is survived by a daughter, Barbara Gardner of Fullerton; a
son, Joseph W. La Shelle Jr. of Santa Barbara; and a sister, Audrey
Russell of Ojai; four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
   Private services will be Wednesday in San Diego, Gardner said.

<HEAD>Medical Economist Considered to Head Medicare, Medicaid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of the Department of Health and Human
Services said Tuesday that Dr. Gail R. Wilensky, a health policy
analyst who has advised Congress on medical issues, is the top
candidate to head the Medicare and Medicaid health care programs.
   The White House is considering Wilensky, who has the backing of
HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, and could formally announce her
nomination soon if she clears background checks, said the officials,
who requested anonymity.
   Wilensky said Tuesday that she is undergoing a background check
by the FBI. If President Bush nominates her, she said, Senate
confirmation hearings could be held in late October or early
November.
   If approved, Wilensky would become chief of the Health Care
Financing Administration, which oversees the $130 billion Medicare
and Medicaid programs. Medicare provides health care for the elderly
while Medicaid helps finance medical services for the poor.
   Wilensky, 46, is a vice president of Project Hope, a foundation
in Chevy Chase, Md., that trains medical workers and provides
emergency care in poor nations and analyzes health issues in this
country and abroad.
   In a telephone interview, she declined to discuss her views on
several topics, such as whether federal assistance for abortions
should be limited. She said it would be ``premature'' for her to
make policy statements.
   But she said she believes her views would not anger conservative
Republicans in the administration or in Congress, who have blocked
prior would-be appointees favored by Sullivan.
   ``As best as I can tell, and I've asked around to try to get a
sense, there is not any opposition to my nomination,'' said
Wilensky, a Republican.
   She advised the House Ways and Means Committee last year when
Congress extended Medicare to cover the costs of lengthy, serious
illnesses of the elderly. Several senior citizen groups have
complained that the program is too expensive, and lawmakers are now
considering rolling it back.
   She has provided advice to Congress on problems of the elderly
and of people without medical insurance, escalating health care
costs and other issues.
   Wilensky, who has a doctorate in economics from the University of
Michigan, said she has published about 60 studies on medical issues.
   One of them was a 1982 report that concluded that the government
spends as much on health care for the poor as for the well-to-do,
when tax breaks for health insurance and medical payments are
factored in.
   Wilensky would be the third person chosen for the job since the
Bush administration took office.
   Sheila Burke, chief of staff to Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., withdrew from consideration in April. Her husband is vice
president of the Aetna insurance group, which handles Medicare
claims under contract to HHS. Sources said there were fears of a
potential conflict of interest.
   Last month Drew Altman, New Jersey human services commissioner,
decided not to seek the job after drawing opposition from
conservative Republicans.
   In June, Sullivan's selection of Robert Fulton to head the Family
Support Administration, which oversees the welfare program, was
withdrawn after conservatives expressed opposition.

<TEXT>
   The bodies of Rep. Mickey Leland and
eight other Americans were flown home in flag-draped coffins
Tuesday, two weeks after they died in a plane crash while on a
humanitarian mission.
   The coffins were loaded onto a C-141 transport after a two-hour
airport ceremony and left Addis Ababa shortly after noon. Officials
said the aircraft was expected in Washington about 3:15 p.m.
Wednesday, after an overnight stop in Frankfurt, West Germany.
   In Washington, the State Department said it planned a memorial
service Wednesday at the Lincoln Memorial. Leland's family plans a
private service in Houston.
   Leland, the other Americans and seven Ethiopians were killed Aug.
7 when their chartered plane crashed into a mountain en route to the
Fugnido refugee camp near the Sudanese border. All 16 aboard are
believed to have died instantly.
   Fugnido is one of four camps run by the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees that house more than 300,000 Sudanese who fled famine
and civil war in their country. Leland, a 44-year-old Texas
Democrat, was chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger.
   Searchers found the crash site a week later. Retrieval of the
bodies from the mountainside, and identification, took nearly
another week.
   At the memorial service in Addis Ababa, Leland was eulogized by
U.S., U.N. and Ethiopian officials as a man of compassion.
   ``The fact that he met his tragic death while on a humanitarian
mission is ample testimony of his dedication to the well-being of
people,'' said Tesfaye Wolde-Selassie, Ethiopia's interior minister.
   Work at the aiport stopped and employees joined Ethiopian
officials, U.S. Embassy staff and relatives of Ethiopian victims for
the ceremony. The Ethiopians wailed in grief and sympathy.
   Albert-Alain Peters, representative in Addis Ababa of the U.N.
refugee agency, said Leland had died for a ``noble cause.'' It was
the congressman's fifth visit to Africa and his second this year.
   The sky was clear for Tuesday's ceremony, a contrast to the rain
and heavy overcast of the day Leland's party took off for the camp.
The bad weather is believed to have had a role in the crash.
   A guard of honor accompanied the coffins of all 16 victims, and a
military band played solemn music as they were moved from the
makeshift clinic where the bodies were identified.
   When the ceremony was over, the band played the two national
anthems. The coffins of the Americans were taken to the aircraft,
and those of the Ethiopians to hearses.
   The other Americans killed were:
   _ Patrice Johnson, 35, a Leland aide.
   _ Hugh A. Johnson, 34, of the House Select Committee on Hunger.
   _ Ivan Lee Tillem, 33, a New York City lawyer and friend of
Leland who was investigating prospects for food-relief projects he
had proposed for Ethiopia.
   _ Joyce Francine Williams, 39, an aide to Rep. Ron Dellums,
D-Calif., and an expert on child health and nutrition issues.
   _ Robert Woods, age unavailable, a political and economic officer
with the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa.
   _ Gladys Gilbert, 43, special projects officer of the Agency for
International Development in Addis Ababa.
   _ Thomas J. Worrick, 48, deputy AID representative in Addis Ababa.
   _ Roberta Worrick, 48, wife of Thomas Worrick and a contract
employee of the AID mission.

   A seaplane crashed while trying to land
during windy weather on Great Slave Lake in Canada's Northwest
Territories, killing the pilot and five fishermen, officials said.
   A spokesman for Canadian Forces Base Edmonton Rescue said there
were no survivors from the crash, which occurred Monday morning
about 600 miles north of Edmonton.
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said all the victims were
Canadian. No identities or hometowns were immediately available.
   The de Havilland Beaver, owned by Plummer's Great Slave Lake
Lodge, crashed in the lake about 18 miles from the lodge while
trying to land so the passengers could fish, said Clouter.
   ``I heard the plane was partially submerged and then came back to
the surface and caught on fire _ probably because the gas tank
exploded,'' he said.
   Pilot Carl Clouter said he had been told the crash is being
blamed on strong gusts on the lake, the fourth largest in Canada.
   ``The wind has been really gusty there for the last couple of
days and they probably caught a gust of wind and crashed into the
lake,'' he said.
   Bill Rouse, an official with the territorial government, said the
plane had apparently been flying between two cliffs when the gusts
forced it to plummet into the lake.
   ``The wings came off. Wreckage was scattered around, and part of
the cabin was above water while the other part was below,'' said
Rouse.
   A spokesman for the Canadian Aviation Safety Board said an
investigation crew was en route to the crash site Monday night.

   Huey Newton, whose Black Panthers preached
``the power of the gun'' in a war against white authority in
America, was found fatally shot in an Oakland street early today,
police reported.
   Newton, 47, whose violent career was marked by many clashes with
the law and who spent time as a fugitive in Cuba, was found about
5:30 a.m., said police officer Terry Foley.
   A 10-foot-round pool of blood marked the spot in a low-income
neighborhood of west Oakland where Newton was found suffering from
multiple gunshot wounds, including at least one shot in the head.
   Police got a report of gunshots fired at 5:29 a.m. and arrived a
minute later, said Sgt. Dan Marcado. He said Newton was taken to
Highland Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 6:12 a.m.
   Marcado declined to say whether there were any suspects, or
reveal any further details surrounding the fatal shooting.
   ``I saw him laying down on the street. I called my wife to the
window,'' said a resident of the neighborhood, Roy Johnson. He said
he did not hear any gunshots and did not call the police.
   Another resident, who asked not to be identified, said: ``He
(Huey) hadn't been down here in years. This is where he used to
organize. This is really his old stomping grounds.''
   Newton and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panthers, the
now-defunct radical black liberation group, in the 1960s in reaction
to police brutality in Oakland. Newton served as its defense
minister.
   Panthers walked the streets in black berets and black leather
jackets to ``protect'' black people from the authorities they
reviled as ``pigs.''
   Bobby Rush, a former leader of the Panthers who is now an
alderman in Chicago, said: ``The Huey that I remember was a student
of the world and made a commitment to change the conditions in the
world.''
   He ``made a contribution to the advancement of the ideals of
freedom, justice and equality for all Americans,'' said Rush, who
left the Panthers nearly 20 years ago.
   But Tom Orloff, deputy district attorney for Alameda County who
prosecuted Newton in 1974, called him ``a man who lived by violence
and outside the law'' and ``nothing but a gangster.''
   A Black Panther party poster distributed nationally during the
organization's heyday pictured Newton on an African wicker throne
bearing a shotgun and a spear.
   In California, the state Senate subcommittee on un-American
activities said in August 1970 that the Black Panthers were
controlled by the Communist Party of the United States to ``serve as
shock troops on the front line of the revolution.''
   Then-FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover described the Panthers as a
``black extremist organization'' consisting mostly of ``hoodlum-type
revolutionaries'' who stockpiled weapons, espoused Marxist-Leninist
doctrines and terrorized black communities.
   Newton, in turn, once commented in an Associated Press interview:
``The most dangerous groups to the people of the world are the
Pentagon, including the CIA, the U.S. military, the local police,
the avaricious businessmen and the lying politicians. All are guilty
of crimes against the people and the verdict is death.''
   Nine years ago, he donned a cap and gown to receive a doctor of
philosophy degree at age 38 from the University of California at
Santa Cruz. His dissertation was titled: ``War against the Panthers,
a study of repression in America.'' But his life was marked by
repeated clashes with the law.
   He was convicted of manslaughter for the shooting death of an
Oakland policeman on Oct. 28, 1967, and was sentenced to 2 to 15
years. But that conviction was overturned on appeal after he served
two years in prison. The charge was dropped after two retrials ended
in hung juries.
   Newton, convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in 1964, was
convicted of being a felon in possession of weapons after a 1974
incident in which he allegedly pistol-whipped his tailor and police
found two guns in his apartment.
   He then fled the country and lived for three years in Cuba. He
was acquitted of a charge of assault in connection with the incident.
   Tom Orloff, deputy district attorney for Alameda County who
prosecuted Newton in the 1974 case, called him ``a man who lived by
violence and outside the law'' and ``nothing but a gangster.''
   Earlier this year, Newton drew six months in jail after pleading
no contest to misappropriating $15,000 in public money earmarked for
a school the Panthers ran in the early 1980s. He was already in jail
at the time for parole violation.
   The Panthers eventually died out because of infighting, arrests,
deaths, imprisonments and differing philosophies, especially between
Newton and Eldridge Cleaver, the one-time Panther information
minister and author of ``Soul on Ice'' who fled the country for
several years in the 1960s after a shootout between Panthers and
police.

   Communist Party General Secretary Karoly
Grosz, a centrist who has lost ground recently to reformists,
suggested in an interview published Tuesday that he will step down
to prevent a power struggle.
   Grosz did not specifically say he would resign, but the official
MTI news agency reported that he did not contradict a reporter for
the party daily Nepszabadsag who asked ``why he intended to leave
the political scene.''
   ``Many people want to believe that the main cause of the current
problems is the power struggle within the party,'' Grosz was quoted
as saying. ``I would not like to have a power struggle, as it would
not do any good to either the party or the country.''
   He did not elaborate, either on his political future or his views
on the party conflict. But he apparently was alluding to
expectations that an extraordinary party congress Oct. 6 would be
dominated by a battle between reformers and their opponents.
   Grosz became general secretary of the party 15 months ago,
replacing Janos Kadar, the leader of 32 years who had become
associated with political and economic stagnation.
   Grosz assumed power amid expectations he would head reforms while
maintaining discipline and good terms with party conservatives. But
he was left behind as reformers forced the pace of political and
economic liberalization.
   In the past two years, the surge of reformist sentiment within
the party has led to the endorsement of a multiparty system and of
free elections, by mid-1990 at the latest.
   A draft manifesto published in Nepszabadsag on Friday, ahead of
the special party congress scheduled for Oct. 6, reiterated the
communists' intention to ``introduce a multiparty system, in which
the source of power is the will of the people manifested in free
elections.''
   The reformers formally consolidated strength in June, when three
of them were appointed to share power with Grosz.
   The shakeup placed reform economist Rezsoe Nyers in the new post
of party chairman, a position he has described as ``first among
equals.''
   Grosz had been a scheduled speaker at a party rally honoring St.
Stephen, the 11th century king who founded the Hungarian nation. But
he was absent.
   Party official Pal Ivany said at the rally that Grosz was
planning to resign. Grosz already told the independent daily Mai Nap
in June he planned to step down after the elections, but he told
Nepszabadsag it was up to the party to decide whether he would step
down.

<HEAD>Baltics Call Soviet Annexation a `Crime,' Equate Hitler, Stalin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baltic residents Tuesday mourned the
loss of their independence a half-century ago as an ``international
crime'' that must be swept aside by a tide of reform, and they
vilified Hitler and Stalin as ``monsters of the 20th century.''
   About 50,000 people gathered in Vilnius, the capital of
Lithuania, on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a treaty between
Adolf Hitler's Germany and Josef Stalin's Soviet Union that brought
Soviet tanks rolling into Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
   Baltic residents plan to mark the anniversary of the 1939
agreement on Wednesday with a human chain stretching 370 miles from
Tallinn, Estonia, on the Gulf of Finland, to the Polish-Lithuanian
border. Activists predict 1.5 million people will join it.
   A Lithuanian legislative commission in a report published Tuesday
declared that ``the realization of the illegal German-Soviet
agreements of 1939-41 constitute an international crime.''
Grassroots activists issued a statement in Riga, Latvia, demanding
the absorption of the republics be recognized both inside the Soviet
Union and internationally as an act of aggression.
   Commemoration of the anniversary in the Baltics, as well as other
regions such as the Western Ukraine and Moldavia, illustrated the
Kremlin's dilemna dealing with ethnic minorities clamoring for
greater freedom. Soviets now more than ever are free to criticize
Stalin, but an official finding that annexation of the Baltics was
illegal would raise the question of total independence.
   Showing the power that independence movements have accumulated in
the Baltic governments, the commission of the Lithuanian Supreme
Soviet declared that approving annexation was beyond the powers of
the Lithuanian parliament of the time and ``absolutely against the
will of the citizens of Lithuania.''
   The report will be forwarded to the full Supreme Soviet in
Lithuania and a spokesman for Sajudis, the People's Front
organization of Lithuania, said it may eventually form the basis for
a republic-wide referendum on future relations with the Soviet Union.
   A representative of a Russian cultural organization in Vilnius
told the rally that Hitler and Stalin, ``two monsters of the 20th
century, personally ruined the fate of millions of people.''
   Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the Lithuanian Sajudis, or
People's Front movement, told the Vilnius rally that annulment of
the pact is ``not only a historic and political question but a moral
one of the liquidation of Stalinism.''
   Landsbergis spoke as several dozen yellow, red and green
Lithuanian national flags fluttered. Youths climbed light towers to
get a better view of the stage and children were hoisted on their
parents' shoulders.
   After the Soviets seized control, thousands of Baltic residents
were shot or deported for their anti-Soviet sympathies. After the
war, others were similarly punished for real or alleged
collaboration with the Nazis.
   Baltic residents increasingly have come to equate the actions of
Stalin and Hitler, who divided Eastern Europe into spheres of
influence on the eve of Hitler's attack on Poland the started World
War II. Posters in the Vilnius crowd showed a skull and crossbones
imposed over the Soviet and Nazi flags.
   The official Soviet media struggled against that impression in
two reports from Tallinn criticizing a new monument to an Estonian
pro-Nazi group and cards showing a hammer and sickle and swastika
together.
   Recalling the Soviet struggle to turn back Hitler's invasion, the
national daily Socialist Industry said, ``No one has the right to
spit on our graves.''
   In a statement released at a conference of East European
activists in Riga, leaders of the grassroots People's Front
organizations of the Baltic republics said that in the years since
it annexed them, ``The Soviet Union has done everything to remove
the republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania from the memory and
the map of Europe, from your libraries and textbooks, your sense of
justice, your grief and your minds.
   ``Let us unite our voices to demand that the Hitler-Stalin pacts
together with their secret protocols be declared null and void from
the very moment of their signing! Let us declare the annexation of
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania unlawful,'' it said.
   A two-day conference of Eastern European activists that wrapped
up Tuesday in Riga called for an ``end to the occupation of the
Baltic states'' and asked European countries to seek U.N. action
declaring it an act of aggression.
   The Soviet Union for decades denied the existence of a secret
protocol to the Aug. 23, 1939, non-aggression treaty that divided
Eastern Europe into spheres of influence.
   A commission of the Congress of Peoples Deputies national
parliament in Moscow is investigating the pact and has said it
should be declared ``null and void.'' But it stopped short of
criticizing the incorporation of the then-independent Baltic states
into the Soviet Union.
   Communist Party Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev, in an
interview with the party newspaper Pravda, said last week there was
there was no connection between the division of Eastern Europe and
the incorporation of the Baltic republics.
   Yakovlev is a close adviser to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
the party's chief ideologist. He also is chairman of the national
commission on the Stalin-Hitler agreement.

   A federal judge on Tuesday ordered disbarred
attorney William Borders to jail for refusing to answer questions
from a Senate panel gathering evidence in the Alcee L. Hastings
impeachment trial.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Pennfield Jackson found Borders in
contempt of court and gave him until 10 a.m. Friday to put his
affairs in order and surrender to federal marshals.
   Jackson acted hours after Borders refused for the third time in a
month to answer questions posed by the Hastings impeachment
committee.
   The committee is gathering evidence concerning charges that
Hastings, a 52-year-old U.S. district judge from Florida, conspired
with Borders to obtain a $150,000 payoff and lied about it before a
jury that acquitted him in 1983.
   Hastings, who was impeached by the House in August 1988, is also
accused of improperly disclosing information that government
investigators obtained through a court-approved wiretap.
   Once the committee finishes its report, the full Senate will vote
on whether to remove Hastings from the federal bench and thus take
away the $89,500 annual salary he continues to collect.
   While Hastings was acquitted by a federal court jury, Borders was
convicted of the payoff conspiracy charges in 1982. He was
disbarred, sent to prison for 33 months and shorn of the political
influence officials say he wielded in the Washington of the late
1970s.
   At the request of the Senate, Jackson held Borders in civil
contempt of court for refusing to testify after being granted
immunity from prosecution for anything concerning the payoff plot
that he might say in the proceeding.
   ``This court ... confines him to the custody of the U.S. marshal
until he purges himself,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson said Borders could win his release whenever he wished,
simply by answering questions from the committee. If he remains
silent, however, he will remain behind bars until the Senate votes
on whether to remove Hastings from the bench, most likely before
mid-October.
   Borders on Tuesday refused to answer 10 questions posed by Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa. They ranged from whether Hastings received any
payoff money to the reported relationship between Borders and the
late Florida Mafia boss Santo Trafficante.
   In reply to each of the questions, Borders cited a statement he
read to the panel July 27, when he had remained similarly silent. In
it, he refused to answer questions on grounds that they violated his
constitutional rights, including his 5th Amendment right against
self-incrimination.
   Borders was arrested in October 1981 when he drove out of a
suburban Virginia motel with a garment bag containing $125,000 in
cash and accompanied by a retired FBI agent masquerading as a
convicted racketeer in quest of leniency from Hastings.

<HEAD>3 Palestinians Reported Killed, Palestinians Meet Israeli Lawmakers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israeli troops fatally shot a Palestinian woman
Tuesday in the Gaza Strip and two other Arabs were reported killed
in the West Bank, raising to six the number of Palestinian deaths in
the past two days.
   Also Tuesday, a group of prominent Palestinians met with Israeli
legislators in the occupied Gaza Strip despite warnings from
underground leaders of the uprising not to do so.
   The rash of fatalities in the occupied lands prompted commercial
strikes in Arab east Jerusalem as well as in the Palestinian towns
of Ramallah to the north and Bethlehem to the south.
   Palestinian school officials said the army told them the violence
also would delay the reopening of classes for high school sophomores
and juniors. Teachers earlier were told the classes would resume
Wednesday.
   West Bank schools were closed for most of the uprising, but have
been reopened in phases since July.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, 20-year-old Maha Awad Abu Hadath was
killed by a stray shot when a clash erupted between soldiers and
masked, stone-throwing youths in the market of the Deir El-Balah
refugee camp, Arab witnesses said.
   Doctors at Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City said she was hit in
the head by a rubber-coated metal pellet that troops use for riot
control.
   A military spokeswoman confirmed the death and said the army was
investigating the two other reported deaths.
   In the West Bank, 14-year-old Najla Aadel El-Nadi died of a
bullet wound to the head suffered during a stone-throwing
confrontation with soldiers a week ago in the Askar refugee camp
near Nablus, according to doctors at Ramallah Hospital.
   In the West Bank's Al-Amari refugee camp, Arab reporters said the
body of Nasser Khalil Shahin Abu Katrina, 17, was found Tuesday with
a bullet wound in his chest.
   Residents said troops opened fire during clashes in the camp
Monday night, but the army spokesman's office said it could not
confirm if there was any shooting.
   Reporters were banned from entering the camp because of a curfew
confining residents to their homes.
   The deaths raised to at least 545 the number of Palestinians
killed since the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule began in
December 1987. Thirty-eight Israelis also have died in the violence.
   Palestinians have killed 97 fellow Arabs, many suspected of
collaborating with Israeli authorities.
   The death in Al-Amari camp was the second mysterious killing in
the area north of Jerusalem in a week.
   On Friday, the body of a Palestinian-American boy was found near
El-Bireh, adjacent to Ramallah. He had been shot at close range in
the chest.
   The family alleged that the boy, 14-year-old Amjad Jibril Tawil,
born in Denver, was in army custody before his death and that the
body showed signs of beating and torture.
   The army exhumed Tawil's body for an autopsy and announced Monday
that his death ``was not caused by Israeli security forces.'' It did
not say who killed him.
   Dr. Derick Pounder, a Scottish pathologist brought in by the
Tawil family to conduct an independent autopsy, said Tuesday he was
unable to do so immediately because of ``bureaucratic problems''
with Israeli authorities.
   In Gaza, Palestinians met with lawmakers from the left-leaning
Labor Party and the leftist Citizen's Rights Movement.
   Labor member Amir Peretz told Israel radio that some Gazans
scheduled to attend the meeting stayed away, apparently because of
unwillingness to meet with Israelis in the ruling parties.
   ``This meeting is not considered disobedience of the orders of
the United National Leadership of the Uprising,'' Gaza lawyer
Mohammed Abu Shaaban told reporters. ``We met with people that have
no authority.''
   The latest leaflet from the underground leadership last week
warned that Palestinians should ``reject meetings with any Israeli,
official or unofficial.''
   Peretz told Israel radio that the meeting was part of ongoing
efforts to discuss human rights problems in the territories and to
review options for advancing the government's peace plan.
   The plan calls for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip to choose local Palestinians to negotiate with Israel on
limited autonomy for the territories.

   Voyager 2's encounter with Neptune caps a
string of successes for an aging but still nimble spacecraft that
was supposed to have been abandoned years ago.
   Voyager 2 was launched on Aug. 20, 1977, on a five-year mission
to explore two new worlds: Jupiter and Saturn.
   NASA scientists knew, however, that if the spacecraft held out it
could theoretically go on to Uranus and Neptune, which were in
precisely the right alignment. That happens only once every 175
years.
   Twelve years after its launch, Voyager 2 is almost 3 billion
miles from Earth and about to pass 3,000 miles from Neptune, its
closest approach to any object in the solar system since leaving
Earth.
   Voyager 1, launched Sept. 5, 1977, passed Jupiter and Saturn on a
course that then took it out of the solar system.
   The two Voyager spacecraft encountered Jupiter in 1979. The
biggest surprise was the discovery of at least nine active volcanoes
on Jupiter's moon Io. Eruptions spewed material up to 190 miles
above the moon's surface.
   A thin ring was discovered around Jupiter, and the identification
of three new moons brought Jupiter's total to at least 16.
   The two spacecraft passed Saturn in 1980 and 1981. Saturn's
rings, which had seemed simple and distinct from Earth, were
revealed to be a nearly continuous layer of complex rings. One was
delicately braided from three strands of material.
   Wind on Saturn was observed at staggering speeds of up to 1,100
mph.
   Saturn was known before the encounters to have 11 moons. It is
now known to have at least 17.
   As Voyager 2 continued alone to Uranus, it discovered that the
planet had a strange magnetic field with a corkscrew-shaped tail
extending millions of miles into space.
   Uranus's moon Miranda was shown to have been dramatically
fractured by internal forces, a finding that researchers have still
not explained. Ten new moons were found, bringing the total to 15.
   Voyager found two new rings around Uranus, in addition to the
nine previously known. A high layer of smog was found over the south
pole, which was in direct sunlight.
   Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 took more than 100,000 pictures of
Jupiter and Saturn, and Voyager 2 sent back 7,000 pictures from
Uranus.

<HEAD>Beatles Tapes Flop at Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three tapes recorded by the Beatles were snubbed by
bidders Tuesday, although John Lennon's sunglasses and a pair of
high heels worn by Marilyn Monroe in ``Some Like It Hot'' fetched
higher-than-expected prices.
   Two other tapes, in which the Fab Four sang and read from the
Bible, were sold for about $18,700 to a private German buyer who bid
by telephone.
   The auctioneer, Sotheby's, had set minimum prices of $16,000 each
for two of the unsold tapes and a minimum of $24,000 for the third.
   The disappointed owner of the tapes, former Beatles' chauffeur
Alf Bicknell, said he may put them back in the tool shed where they
were kept since 1966.
   ``We were expecting about 50,000 pounds ($80,000) more coming
from the Beatles' tapes,'' said Sotheby's spokeswoman Susu Elliot.
   Ms. Elliot said the auction house was required to read a
statement from the Beatles' record company, EMI, before the tapes
were auctioned that warned buyers they would not be able to
broadcast or sell copies.
   ``Perhaps that put people off,'' she said.
   Bicknell, the Beatles' chauffeur from 1964-66, said Lennon gave
him the reel-to-reel tapes in 1966, thinking they had been sent by
fans.
   The tapes had been in Bicknell's tool shed in Wales until last
year when, in the course of writing a book about the Beatles, he
listened to them and found that the group had made the tapes on a
portable machine.
   Bicknell, 60, sat out the sale at a nearby pub because he was too
nervous to watch.
   He said he was selling the tapes because he has had some lean
years while writing the book ``Baby You Can Drive My Car,''
co-authored by Gerry Marsden of Gerry and the Pacemakers, another
Liverpool band.
   A Puerto Rican collector, who gave his name only as Lawrence,
paid $8,800 for the 4{-inch black Ferragamo heels worn by Miss
Monroe in ``Some Like It Hot.''
   Paul Trees, from northern England, successfully bid $3,000 for
Elton John's black jacket.
   ``I would have paid 2,750 pounds ($4,400),'' said the director of
a nursing home company who sports an eight-inch tattoo of Elton
John's single ``Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting'' cover on his
right arm.
   Lennon's sunglasses sold for $3,500.
   It was standing room only at Tuesday's memorabilia sale of 536
items. The gallery held a mixed crowd of heavy metal fans with
shaved heads wearing all black, 1960s survivors in bright patterns
and the conservative coiffed crowd which frequents Bond St. where
Sotheby's is located.
   The auction netted $364,000, compared with 1987's rock
memorabilia sale that brought in $360,000. Last year Sotheby's held
an Elton John sale, instead of the rock 'n' roll memorabilia sale,
which made $8 million.

<HEAD>Investigation Finds Problems, No Specific Cause of Iowa Blast</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Navy report on the blast aboard the USS Iowa
that claimed 47 lives will not pinpoint a specific reason for the
explosion but will cite ``a probability'' about its cause, defense
sources say.
   One defense official said investigators have attempted to look at
all the circumstances that may have led to the explosion, but that
none appears to have been the overriding reason for the disaster.
   The official said he was told the report will show a number of
``lapses in procedures,'' but he declined to define them
specifically.
   Asked about reports that such problems as lapses in preventative
maintenance of the gun turret had been uncovered, or that some of
the sailors had not been properly certified to operate the ship's
complex firing mechanism, the official said:
   ``The investigation found various things wrong about procedures.
But none of them has been found to be the cause.''
   ``The report cites a probability,'' said the official, who spoke
only on condition of anonymity.
   The long-awaited report _ said to fill three feet of a file
drawer _ is under study by the staff of the Chief of Naval
Operations, Adm. Carlisle A. H. Trost, at the Pentagon.
   Trost is expected to brief Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett and
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney before he releases it to the public.
Both officials are traveling and will not return to the Pentagon
until next week.
   Navy investigators have worked for months to find the cause of
the April 19 tragedy, when powder exploded in the battleship's No. 2
gun turret during open seas gunnery practice near Puerto Rico.
   Although Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams has said the report is
expected to be made public at the end of August or the beginning of
September, it now appears that a September release appears more
likely, the Pentagon source said.
   ``They're poring over everything with a magnifying glass,'' the
official said. ``In any investigation of this magnitude, they have
to look at everything.''
   Another Pentagon official familiar with the type of study that
has been undertaken said it is very difficult to find a specific
reason when so many have been killed who might have offered a clue
to the blast.
   There were 11 survivors inside the turret, which extended six
decks down into the ship. The survivors were all on the lowest deck
loading power from the ship's magazines at the time of the blast.
   Besides delving into the mechanical problems that could have
caused the blast, it researches the possibility that human action
may have been the reason for the explosion.
   The Washington Post reported in Tuesday's editions that the
investigation has found the crew failed to perform certain
unspecified preventive maintenance procedures, but the newspaper
added it is not known whether the faulty maintenance caused the
explosion.
   The Post reported the No. 2 turret's guns passed pre-firing
checks before the explosion.
   In a separate story, the Daily Press of Newport News, Va.,
reported that the sailors who worked with the explosives in the
turret had not been properly cleared to man their posts.
   The Navy requires that all who work at certain posts be certified
by a qualifying board, which determines whether they are able to
handle weapons or other procedures.
   Michael Drowns, one of 11 sailors who escaped the explosion, told
the Daily Press a qualification board was never convened on the Iowa
during his three years on the ship.
   Another Iowa survivor, Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall Truitt,
has said one of the sailors who lacked a qualification book showing
facts about the guns was Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Robert W.
Backherms, the rammerman of the center gun where the explosion
occurred.
   Truitt said Backherms joined the ship shortly after Christmas,
was inexperienced and may have caused the blasts by ramming the bags
of explosives into the gun too fast.

<HEAD>Congressman Says Forbes' Party Shouldn't Be Tax Deductible</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It's one thing to fly the world's rich and
famous to Morocco for a lavish 70th birthday party, but the expenses
shouldn't be tax deductible, says a California congressman.
   Democratic Rep. Fortney ``Pete'' Stark, reacting to news accounts
of publisher Malcolm Forbes' big party, said in a letter to Internal
Revenue Service Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg, ``There are reports
in the society pages that Malcolm Forbes thinks some of the expenses
of his `Party of the Century' are tax deductible. I hope not.''
   In published reports about the bash that drew the likes of
actress Elizabeth Taylor, designer Calvin Klein and opera diva
Beverly Sills who sang ``Happy Birthday,'' the billionaire magazine
owner was quoted as saying: ``Some of it is a business expense.''
   That raised the ire of Stark, a member of the House Ways and
Means Committee.
   ``The public's support of the tax system is destroyed by reports
of tax deductible birthday bashes by belly-dancing billionaires,''
he wrote to the IRS.

<HEAD>Two Plead Innocent To Charges Of Trying To Supply IRA With Arms</HEAD>

   Two people pleaded innocent Tuesday to charges they
conspired to supply the Irish Republican Army with weapons,
including anti-helicopter rockets.
   U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone ordered Martin Peter
Quigley, 27, an Irish citizen, to continue to be held without bail.
Mazzone said Quigley, who lived in Bethlehem, Pa., has no family in
the United States, no job and only has a vistor's visa.
   Quigley and Christina Leigh Reid of Sunnyvale, Calif., pleaded
innocent to charges they conspired to violate federal arms export
control laws and regulations.
   Mazzone allowed Ms. Reid to remain free on a $10,000 signature
bond, but restricted her travel to California and Massachusetts.
   Ms. Reid and Quigley are among five people indicted earlier this
month.
   Two other defendants, Richard Clark Johnson of Harwich and Gerald
Vincent Hoy of Easton, Pa., pleaded innocent Friday and were freed
on bail.
   A fifth man, Peter Eamon McGuire, is a fugitive and is believed
to be in Ireland.
   The indictment specifically mentioned ``a missile and rocket
system to be used against British Army helicopters in Northern
Ireland.''
   Quigley asked Mazzone to release him.
   ``I come from a good Irish family and my parents brought me up to
know right from wrong,'' Quigley told the court. ``I have every
intention of staying here and fighting these charges. I can give you
my word of honor that no matter what conditions you lay down, I will
abide by them.''
   Quigley's attorney, Richard Bachman, argued the only reason
Quigley was being held without bail was because he is Irish.
   ``He assures me he intends to appear in court and fight these
charges,'' Bachman said. ``This is a situation because, and only
because, he is a citizen of a foreign country.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Stearns opposed bail.
   The judge told Bachman he would reconsider bail if he was
presented with additional evidence to back up the likelihood of
Quigley appearing in court.

<TEXT>
   A committee of African leaders on Tuesday
asked President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire to try to put faltering
Angolan peace efforts back on track.
   The special eight-member peace committee on Angola also called
for Mobutu to work toward mediating an end to military operations by
the rebel Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   At the end of five hours of talks, the committee issued a
statement reaffirming Mobutu's role as the main mediator between the
two sides in Angola's 14-year civil war.
   The statement said the African leaders reiterated their support
for a cease-fire reached by Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos and
rebel leader Jonas Savimbi on June 22.
   President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, who heads the international
committee, said Savimbi had agreed to accept exile during peace
talks as called for in the June accord.
   In addition to dos Santos, Kaunda, and Mobutu, the leaders at
Tuesday's meeting were President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe; Gen.
Denis Sassou Nguesso of Congo; Omar Bongo of Gabon; Joaquim Chissano
of Mozambique; and Manuel Pinto Da Costa of Sao Tome and Principe.
   The Angolan rebels did not sent representatives to Tuesday's
talks.
   Soon after Savimbi and Dos Santos agreed to the truce and peace
talks, both broke down in renewed fighting. New talks between the
Marxist Angolan government and the rebels began Aug. 12.
   The rebels have been fighting, with U.S. and South African
backing, to force the government to share power since shortly after
Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   Mugabe opened four days of meetings in Harare on Monday. A summit
of Portuguese-speaking African states convenes in Harare on
Wednesday, and the leaders of a nine-nation economic alliance of
Southern African nations will meet Thursday.
   In another development, two leaders of the struggle for Namibian
independence were reported to have postponed their return there
indefinitely.
   Sam Nujoma, president of the South-West Africa People's
Organization, and Secretary-general Toivo Ja Toivo previously
announced they would return to the South African-ruled territory
this month to prepare for U.N.-supervised elections Nov. 1.
   But Ja Toivo, who was attending the Harare summits, was quoted by
the Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency as saying he and Nujoma had
been advised by group officials inside Namibia to defer their return.
   The interview did not say why. It quoted Ja Toivo as saying only
that he believed group officials were still preparing for the
homecoming.
   Guerrilla forces have waged a war against South African rule
since 1966. In recent years, Nujoma has directed guerrilla
operations from bases in Angola, Namibia's northern neighbor.
   South Africa signed accords with Angola and Cuba in December,
agreeing to begin the independence process in Namibia in exchange
for withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola.

   An escalating Sinhalese uprising took
at least 61 more lives, and the government arrested 100 suspected
radicals, officials and independent sources said Tuesday.
   At least 18 bodies were found Monday in the central village of
Mahawehera, where ethnic Sinhalese radicals ambushed a military
convoy the previous day, said sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The bodies were dumped in a roadside ditch formed by buried
explosives that were detonated under the passing convoy, the sources
said. The attack killed at least six soldiers and a civilian driver.
   The sources said the bodies were of suspected radicals killed by
government forces in revenge for Sunday's attack. They said the
suspects had been shot.
   Government officials said they knew of no retaliatory violence in
Mahawehera, 85 miles northeast of the capital of Colombo.
   However, senior government officials have in the past
acknowledged privately that members of the security forces sometimes
commit abuses in trying to halt the radicals' campaign of killing
and terror.
   At least 10 other bodies were found near the village of
Atturugiriya, 15 miles northeast of Colombo, said police officials
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   There were no details on how the victims died. The bodies were
burned and could not be identified, police said.
   Human rights groups have blamed most of such killings on
government forces and pro-government vigilante groups that support
the official campaign to put down the uprising.
   In other violence reported since Monday, at least 11 radicals and
two policemen were killed in three separate shootouts in the
Sinhalese-dominated south and center of the island, military sources
said.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 100
suspected Sinhalese radicals were arrested during the same period.
   At least 4,000 people have been killed in the Sinhalese campaign
launched in July 1987 to protest government peace overtures to
rebels from the minority ethnic Tamil community.
   The radicals say a peace plan aimed at ending the rebellion gave
too many concessions to the Tamils. They also say the deployment of
Indian soldiers in the Tamil-dominated north and east to enforce the
plan compromises Sri Lanka's sovereignty.
   Military officials also said 20 relatives of soldiers and police
officers were killed Monday and Tuesday by Sinhalese radicals.
   The killings are follow threats against relatives of those
soldiers and police officers who refuse to heed a call from the
radicals to resign. The deadline for the ultimatum expired Sunday,
said the officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   At least 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have
been killed since Tamils launched their separatist war in 1983.
   Indian diplomats said Indian soldiers killed five Tamil rebels
Monday.
   The Tamils say they suffer discrimination by the Sinhalese
majority.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people. The Buddhist Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the
population.

   A 14-year-old boy was arrested on drug
charges after police found him carrying $50,000 worth of pure
cocaine, authorities said.
   Two boys were seen Monday afternoon near a parked car, engaging
in an apparent drug transaction, police said.
   The boys fled after they noticed police nearby. But one of the
officers knew where one of the boys lived, and was waiting when they
returned to the house. One boy was grabbed and the other escaped.
   Police said the 14-year-old was carrying 4 ounces of high-grade
cocaine and 96 packets of cocaine, worth $10 each.
   He was charged with possession of narcotics, possession of
narcotics with intent to sell and conspiracy to sell narcotics.
   The boy, whose name was not released, was referred to juvenile
authorities, police said.

   The rebound in U.S. feed grain production this
year will help lower feed costs and stimulate use, an Agriculture
Department report said Tuesday.
   Total output of feed grains _ corn, sorghum, barley and oats _
for 1989 was estimated at 217.6 million metric tons, based on Aug. 1
production estimates announced earlier this month.
   That is up 46 percent from last year's drought-reduced harvest of
149.2 million tons. Part of the increase is due to a 14 percent
boost in harvested acreage.
   But total feed use in 1989-90 is expected to be about 226 million
tons, up 5 million tons from the 1988-89 forecast. Domestic feeding
is forecast to increase by almost 9 million tons, but exports may
drop because of greater foreign competition.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn. The department uses metric tons to measure overall feed
supplies and use, and bushels when referring to specific grains.
   ``With use likely to exceed production, U.S. stocks (in 1989-90)
may drop more than a tenth,'' the report said. ``However, prices are
also expected to decline because of lower loan rates and reduced
drought psychology in the market.''
   World production of coarse grains such as corn is projected at
800 million tons, up 10 percent from 1988-89, the report said. That
includes U.S. output.
   ``While (total) foreign production may be nearly unchanged,
significant increases are expected in the major competing exporters,
except for the (European Economic Community) and South Africa,'' it
said. ``A tightening in the world coarse grain supply-use situation
appears likely in 1989-90.''
   The report said world feed grains consumption is expected to
increase in 1989-90, exceeding production for the third straight
year.
   In a related government report, the Joint Agricultural Weather
Facility said its weekly survey for Aug. 14-20 showed that the
nation's corn crop was ``in good to fair condition'' and that 68
percent of the acreage was in the dough stage of kernel development
or beyond.
   An estimated 26 percent of the corn was in the final dent stage
of kernel development.
   Both the dough and dent stages are lagging the usual pace for
corn development in most of the major production states, the report
said.
   The facility, which is operated by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments, reports on weather and crop conditions during the
season. The Agriculture Department will issue the next production
estimate on Sept. 12.

<TEXT>
   Heritage USA, the booming resort that grew
from Jim Bakker's fund-raising talents, hangs on in the shadow of
its glory days, before the TV evangelist resigned and was indicted
on fraud and conspiracy charges.
   The Heritage Grand Hotel and the sprawling water park remain
open. They are bordered by the half-finished spectres of a 20-story
hotel and the fiberglass turrets and towers of a hamburger castle.
   There's no longer enough traffic to wear down the grass that pops
through the concrete of the massive parking lot at the water park. A
giant crane looms over the unfinished hotel, shadowing the shops of
Main Street USA, Heritage's indoor shopping mall.
   ``Used to be, you couldn't even get a seat in here,'' said Ken
Daneilson of Turlock, Calif., as he watched a handful of shoppers
drift along Main Street. ``Whenever a service would let out or
something else was going on, you could forget about getting into the
ice cream shop over there.''
   Bakker envisioned Heritage USA as a retreat for Christians that
would feature family entertainment and religious services.
   Now it's owned by a Canadian developer and Bakker goes on trial
Monday. Prosecutors say he and other PTL executives used at least $4
million of the $158 million they raised through ``lifetime
partnerships'' in the ministry to pay for their own luxurious
lifestyles.
   Danielson was one of those who donated at least $1,000 to Bakker
for a partnership in 1984 in exchange for three nights lodging a
year at Heritage USA for the rest of his life. Several hotels were
proposed, but the Heritage Grand Hotel was the only one finished and
opened.
   Danielson soon switched his partnership from the uncompleted
towers to the Heritage Grand Hotel. The switch meant he got to use
his partnership, unlike many others.
   ``I felt like I got my money's worth out of it,'' said Danielson.
``I switched that first year and then came at least two more years.
With rooms running $90 or $100 a night, it worked out about even.''
   Danielson said he had not been to Heritage USA in a couple of
years, and he could immediately see a difference.
   ``All the limousines are gone from the front of the hotel,'' he
said. ``They used to be all over the place out here. Every day we'd
see Jim Bakker pull in with his limousine and chauffeur.''
   The Bakkers' likenesses are virtually absent from the shops along
Main Street. A small table in the Victor Music Shoppe held books
written by Jim and his wife, Tammy Faye, which were once used as
premiums for faithful contributors. Tuesday, they were on sale at 75
percent off the retail price.
   Records by Tammy Faye and her daughter, Tammy Sue Chapman, were
selling for as little as 98 cents.
   Manuel Cantu Sr., who owns a snack bar on Main Street, saw the
end of PTL's heyday. ``I got this just two weeks before it all
started to unravel,'' Cantu said, referring to Bakker's resignation
in March 1987. ``It's been kind of tough.''
   Cantu said the former owners, who also operated the ice cream
shop and popcorn stand, did $10,000 worth of business on a Fourth of
July four or five years ago.
   ``Ten thousand dollars in a single day, can you believe it?''
asked Cantu, who lives on the Heritage USA grounds and also works as
an evangelist helping refugees from Central America.
   ``That's how busy it used to be around here,'' he said. ``There
were so many people you could hardly move.
   ``Now, it's OK on weekends, but hardly anybody during the week,''
he said. ``There's a healing conference going on this week, so you
have maybe 40, 50, 60 people here for that. That's helped pick it up
a little, but it's not like it was.
   ``And I honestly doubt if it ever will be again.''

<HEAD>Police Believe 57 Perished in Pleasure Boat Sinking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police believe 57 people perished in the sinking of
a pleasure boat on the Thames, authorities said Tuesday as inquests
began into the worst accident on the river in this century.
   The 90-ton Marchioness, carrying revelers on a late-night party
cruise, sank after being hit by the 1,475-ton sand-and-gravel
dredger Bowbelle near Southwark Bridge in central London.
   Among the victims identified Tuesday was 28-year-old Julian Kent
Tremain, born in Pittsburgh and later a London resident.
   New safety regulations announced following Sunday's sinking took
effect Tuesday. Captains now must leave ashore a record of passenger
totals before setting sail and must give airline-style safety
instructions to passengers.
   ``Seventy-nine survived and 57 are now believed to have been
lost,'' said a spokeswoman from Scotland Yard, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Police said 31 bodies were recovered and 26 people were missing.
   Police Detective Chief Superintendent Michael Purchase testified
Tuesday that blood alcohol tests on the Bowbelle's seven crew and
the Marchioness' surviving crew member proved negative. The pleasure
boat's captain is among the missing.
   Purchase gave evidence at the opening of an inquest into 16
victims. Under British law the inquest had to open before the
victims could be buried.
   ``We have had some difficulty in discovering exactly how many
people were on the vessel. But from my inquiries, I am confident
that the certified capacity of that pleasure vessel was not
exceeded,'' said Purchase.
   The Marchioness, hired for the 26th birthday party of a London
financier, was licensed to carry 149 passengers and two crew.
   Purchase told Westminster Coroner Paul Knapman he hoped to give
the Director of Public Prosecutions a report by weekend.
   The inquest was adjourned until Sept. 20 when other inquiries are
expected to be completed.
   The worst previous accident on the Thames was in 1878, when 700
people died after the Princess Alice paddle steamer was struck by a
collier. About 170 people survived the accident.
   Thames crews based at Westminster Pier, near the Houses of
Parliament, decided Tuesday to cancel pleasure boat sailings until
the wreckage of the Marchioness is removed, said the Transport and
General Workers Union. Pleasure-boat operators had canceled all
cruises Monday but some resumed service Tuesday.
   The Marchioness lay on a sandy bank near the accident site,
exposed to view at low tides.
   The Italian Foreign Ministry said the bodies of two Italian
citizens _ Lino di Girolamo and Marino Drusetta _ had been recovered.
   Among foreign-born victims identified at the Westminster inquest
were Dianne Frances Lim, 25, and Angela Marie Plevey, 29, both
natives of Sydney, Australia, and Vida Shamash, 21, born in Iraq.
All were London residents.

<TEXT>
   An investigation leading to kidnap
conspiracy charges against two Virginia men began after one
contacted an undercover police officer through a computer message
system asking about young boys for a pornographic ``snuff'' film, an
FBI affidavit says.
   The affidavit, filed as part of the case, quoted one of the men
as saying his ``main interest'' was in killing the child.
   It quoted Daniel T. Depew, 28, of Alexandria, as saying, ``I want
to strangle the kid, I want to hang the kid, I want to suffocate the
kid.''
   Depew and Dean A. Lambey, 34, of Richmond, were arrested Aug. 14
after a six-month investigation by the FBI and the San Jose, Calif.,
police department.
   The investigation began in February when a California police
officer, in his investigative work, listed himself in a computer
``bulletin board'' system ``designed to assist people seeking
contact with others interested in diverse sexual pursuits,'' the
papers said.
   Over the course of numerous contacts, Lambey told the undercover
officer he was interested in making a sexually explicit movie with
children, according to the affidavit filed in Richmond.
   During one telephone conversation with his police officer
contact, the affidavit said, Lambey said, ``I think the pleasure of
doin' it would be worth it.''
   According to the affidavit, at a July 21 meeting at a hotel near
Dulles International Airport, Depew said he would accept a boy as
young as 12 ``but 13 or 14 is more along my lines.''
   More than 100 FBI agents were involved in the investigation, U.S.
Attorney Henry Hudson said Tuesday. ``FBI agents from Richmond and
Washington followed them 24 hours a day to make sure no child or
citizen was placed in danger,'' the prosecutor said.
   Hudson urged parents to keep track of their children. ``There
are, as this case illustrates, people out there who choose to prey
on children.''
   Authorities said that under the scheme they are alleging the men
had in mind, a child would abducted or purchased. The FBI affidavit
quoted Lambey as saying he knew someone in Florida who would sell a
child for $12,000. He said $5,000 of that amount would be returned
if the child were returned, according to the affidavit.
   During one conversation with agents, Depew said he had previously
attempted to molest and kill an American teen-ager in Greece and a
boy from Washington, D.C., who ``looked about 15,'' the affidavit
said.
   Both men are charged with conspiracy to kidnap and were being
held Tuesday pending grand jury action.

   He was the picture of revolutionary chic: a spear in one hand, a

   He was Huey P. Newton: Black Panther co-founder, Black Panther
minister of defense; ex-con, expatriate.
   He's dead now, like so many others who bought the credo he
adopted from Mao Tse-tung: ``Political power grows out of the barrel

``pig'' in the national lexicon, and shocked a naive and non-violent
generation into the chilling realities of racial warfare.
   They prowled urban streets in shiny black shoes and black leather
jackets, insolent berets and starched blue shirts tucked neatly into
pressed black slacks. Their weapons were shotguns, law books and
tape recorders.
   They were out to protect the community. Only the Panthers weren't
on the look-out for muggers, rapists and robbers _ they were scoping
cops. Their self-proclaimed mandate was to prevent police brutality
against ghetto blacks, who were sometimes beaten during arrests and
whose civil rights were at times violated.
   ``The Panthers created an image of defiance and organized
resistance to police forces that did not take into consideration the
rights and basic human dignities of the black community,'' Bobby
Rush, one-time Panther deputy minister of defense and former leader
of the Chicago chapter, said in a 1983 interview with The Associated
Press.
   ``A lot of the reform in police departments across the country
today is directly related to the heated controversy of Panthers vs.
police.''
   Rush, now a Chicago alderman, called it a controversy. Others
called it a war, including J. Edgar Hoover. Then director of the
FBI, Hoover called the Panthers ``the most violence-prone of all the
extremist groups.''
   Hoover's secret war was devastating to the Panther organization.
The FBI launched a secret campaign involving fake documents and
letters, infiltrators and informants, which was disclosed by a
Senate investigating committee in 1976. It was part of Hoover's
COINTELPRO operation in the '60s and '70s to disrupt and discredit
civil rights and anti-war organizations.
   In 1969, Black Panthers Mark Clark and Fred Hampton were killed
in a pre-dawn police raid at their Chicago headquarters. Police had
ostenstibly been searching for weapons.
   Clark and Hampton's relatives, and other survivors of the raid,
successfully sued city, state and federal officials and were awarded
$1.85 million in 1983.
   Bobby Seale, who helped Newton create the Panthers in 1966, once
told the AP that law officers killed 26 Panthers and that the
Panthers dispatched their share of police and FBI agents.
   ``They wounded 60-odd of us, we wounded 32 of them. I think the
reason we killed less and wounded less was because they had ... more
equipment,'' said Seale, who today writes cookbooks and cooks
barbecue, and has a cameo appearance in the movie ``Rude Awakening.''
   Initially, the Panthers were non-violent. They appeared at the
scene of an arrest merely to observe the police. The police resented
their presence, and the non-violent Panther patrols soon led to
altercations and eventually shoot-outs.
   Eldridge Cleaver, the former Panther minister of information and
author of ``Soul on Ice,'' was charged with assaulting a police
officer in an Oakland, Calif., gunbattle in 1968. He jumped his
$50,000 bail and fled to Algeria.
   He returned in 1975, saying he had a ``religious conversion.'' He
pleaded guilty to the charges, was given probation and ordered to do
2,000 hours of community service.
   Newton was released from prison in 1970 after serving almost
three years for the 1967 murder of an Oakland police officer. The
verdict was later overturned because of errors by the trial judge.
He also was twice tried for the 1974 slaying of a young prostitute.
The charges were dropped after both trials ended in hung juries.
   Newton went into self-exile in Cuba shortly thereafter. He
returned to the United States in 1977.
   The Panthers, said Seale, never became economically
self-sufficient by creating their own businesses and investments.
Instead, they relied on donations from white liberal organizations
and individuals _ which began to dwindle in the '70s.
   The Panthers were good at raising money from the captains of
industry and culture, such as those who attended ``that party at
Lenny's'' _ the Park Avenue fund-raising bash given by
composer-conductor Leonard Bernstein in 1970. Guests included
filmmaker Otto Preminger and socialite Cynthia Phipps. The take for
the Panthers was $10,000.
   ``If business won't give us full employment, then we must take
the means of production and put them in the hands of the people,''
said Donald Cox, a Panther field marshal who spoke at the
fund-raiser.
   ``I dig absolutely,'' said Bernstein.
   The FBI's counter-intelligence program also helped to shatter the
Panthers.
   Seale and other former Panthers, who eventually wound up in
Washington congressional offices, civil service jobs and corporate
positions, contend that FBI infiltrators posing as Panthers
committed robberies and incited shoot-outs to help undermine the
organization.
   The Panthers had a purge, dropping hundreds of members they
thought might be undercover agents.
   But what the FBI counter-intelligence program also did, Seale
said, was to stop black organizations from merging.
   Panther rhetoric, and the fear it caused, also smothered the
organization.
   Seale's unsuccessful campaign for Oakland mayor in 1973 dealt a
major blow to Panther ranks. Members from chapters around the
country had been called to California to help in the campaign.
Disillusioned when he lost, they quit the party.
   The meager remnants of the Black Panthers huddled together in
Oakland. With Newton in Cuba, party leadership fell to Elaine Brown
who ran for City Council in 1973 and 1975, finishing second both
times.
   Under her leadership, the Panthers instituted a number of
community activities, such as shopping assistance for the elderly, a
community school for ghetto youngsters, child care and student lunch
programs. The school program was closed in 1982 amid allegations
that federal and state grants were misused.
   Today, the Panthers prowl no more.
   But they left an important legacy, Seale said: ``One thing it did
is that it let the Ku Klux Klan and other overt racist organizations
know that if these young blacks had the audacity to shoot it out
with the police, then those groups had a hard way to go.''

   A federal judge denied the National Wildlife
Federation's request Tuesday that shrimp fishermen be required to
equip their nets with devices designed to protect endangered sea
turtles from drowning.
   Wildlife Federation attorney Robert Irvin said he would appeal
the decision by U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Harris to the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
   The federation had asked the court to require the Commerce
Department to enforce regulations requiring shrimpers to equip their
nets with turtle excluder devices, or TEDs.
   Five conservation groups, meanwhile, filed suit against Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher, alleging his actions on behalf of
shimpers have virtually assured the drowning of thousands of
endangered sea turtles.
   In a lawsuit filed late Monday in federal court here, the
organizations claim Mosbacher acted unlawfully when he suspended
regulations that require shrimpers to use TEDs, which prevent sea
turtles from becoming ensnarled in their nets and drowning.
   The lawsuit also seeks to force Mosbacher to resume enforcement
of the suspended regulations on TEDs.
   Mosbacher suspended TEDs regulations after shrimpers, angry about
having to use the devices, which they claim reduce their catch by as
much as one-third, blockaded shipping channels along the Texas Gulf
Coast.
   Under a court order to protect endagered sea turtles in a
separate lawsuit by the Wildlife Federation, Mosbacher then ordered
shrimpers who don't use TEDs to limit their trawling times to 105
minutes at prescribed intervals.
   Michael J. Bean, an attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund,
said there has been ``no sign'' that Gulf Coast shrimpers are
complying with the limited trawl times.
   Commerce spokesman Brian Gorman said the department is waiting
``for the courts to make a judgment about the appropriateness of our
course of action'' but declined to comment further because the
matter is in litigation.
   According to the lawsuit, Mosbacher's decision suspending the
TEDs regulations ``and replacing them with ineffective, inadequate
interim regulations is causing irreparable harm to plaintiffs and
their members by depriving them of the opportunity to study,
observe, photograph and otherwise use and enjoy living sea turtles
on their nesting beaches and in coastal waters.''
   Filing the suit are the Environmental Defense Fund, National
Audubon Society, Center for Marine Conservation, Greenpeace-U.S.A.
and Defenders of Wildlife.

<HEAD>Iranian Leader Rules Out Change In Policy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's new
spiritual leader, indicated Tuesday the pragmatists of President
Hashemi Rafsanjani's government may find him on the oppisite side if
they try a more open foreign policy.
   ``Arrogant powers like the United States and its allies are not
only against Islam, but religion itself,'' he told Foreign Ministry
officials and Iranian ambassadors, according to a Tehran radio
report.
   Iran should ``adopt Islamic positions in forging our country's
foreign policy,'' he said. ``Our foreign policy will not change in
the future and we will continue with the same policy as before.''
   Rafsanjani seeks more private investments and links with the West
to obtain the technology and money needed to rebuild an economy
shattered by the eight-year war with Iraq.
   Khamenei, appointed spiritual leader after the death June 3 of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, is believed to support Rafsanjani on
many domestic issues. But he spoke out last week against negotiating
with the United States about 16 Western hostages held in Lebanon,
most of them by pro-Iranian extremists. Eight of the 16 hostages are
Americans.
   Also Tuesday, heated arguments broke out in the parliament when
hard-liners attacked an editorial published the day before in the
conservative newspaper Ettelaat.
   The Farsi-language daily suggested many of Iran's economic woes
were because of hostility toward the West in the early days of the
revolution that overthrew the monarchy in February 1979.
   One member shouted that the editorial writer was ``a new Salman
Rushdie,'' a reference to the Indian-born British author of ``The
Satanic Verses.''
   On Feb. 14, Khomeini ordered his followers to kill the novelist,
who was born into a Moslem family, for blaspheming Islam. Rushdie
has been in hiding in Britain since Khomeini's order.
   Another respresentative said: ``No one will ever be allowed to
take a step against the line of the Imam (Khomeini).'' The man then
shouted ``Death to America!'' three times, with other members
joining in.
   Tehran radio broadcast the parliamentary session live and it was
monitored in Nicosia. There was no way to identify the members
making the comments.
   In the chair was Hojatoleslam Mehdi Karrubi, who succeeded
Rafsanjani as speaker of the 270-seat Majlis (parliament) earlier
this month after Rafsanjani was elected president.
   Last weekend Rafsanjani submitted his proposed 22-member Cabinet
to the Majis for approval. Confirmation debate is to begin Saturday.
   Rafsanjani generally has appointed moderate, educated technocrats
rather than ideologically committed revolutionaries.

<HEAD>Doctors Change Mrs. Bush's Medication to Fight Eye Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First lady Barbara Bush was ordered onto new
medication Tuesday after her doctors concluded there has been no
improvement in a bothersome eye condition triggered by Graves
disease, her spokeswoman said.
   However, Press Secretary Anna Maria Perez said the specialists
who examined Mrs. Bush during a two-hour session at Walter Reed Army
Hospital also agreed that the disease's most serious threat _ an
attack upon her thyroid gland _ has been controlled.
   Mrs. Bush, 64, interrupted her Maine vacation with the president
to have the condition re-evaluated because of continuing problems
with the irritating side effects involving her eyesight, including
tearing and occasional double vision. Her doctors prescribed
prednisone, a mild form of the steroid drug cortisone, in an attempt
to stem the irritation, Ms. Perez said.
   The first lady's press office issued this formal statement:
   ``In the scheduled visit today to Walter Reed Army Hospital in
Washington, Mrs. Bush's Graves disease was again evaluated by her
physicians, Dr. Burton Lee, Dr. Kenneth Berman and Dr. Frank
Lapiana, in consultation with other specialists from the Mayo
Clinic, Walter Reed and George Washington University.
   ``The thyroid function is under control, but the eye
manifestation of the disease, which has included double vision,
tearing and irritation, has not improved. For that reason, Mrs. Bush
will begin a daily treatment of prednisone, a form of cortisone. Her
condition will be monitored over the next several months to
determine whether further treatment is necessary.''
   Prednisone, a steroid hydrocarbon, often is used in the treatment
of inflammatory conditions, including arthritis and allegic
disorders. It is regarded as having fewer side effects than
cortisone.
   Mrs. Bush did not talk with reporters during the hospital visit.
She left immediately afterward for nearby Andrews Air Force Base in
Maryland and a flight back to Kennebunkport on an Air Force
executive jet.
   ``She was in fine spirits,'' Ms. Perez said. ``She said she
didn't want me to think she was just goofing off up at
Kennebunkport. She said she was helping Millie on the book.''
   Millie is the first family's dog. Mrs. Bush ``co-authored'' a
children's book with an earlier Bush hound, C. Fred, several years
ago.
   ``She thanked the doctors for taking the time out of their
schedule,'' said Ms. Perez. She quoted the first lady as saying
``I'm not going to stay long.''
   Earlier this year, Mrs. Bush was treated with radioactive iodine
to render her thyroid gland inactive, and has since taken other
medication maintain adequate hormone levels. Thyroid secretions
regulate body growth and metabolism.
   Graves disease results from a mixup in the body's
disease-fighting immune system. The body produces antibodies that
mistakenly attack the thyroid gland as an enemy. Instead of harming
the gland, they stimulate it to grow and work non-stop, producing
too much thyroid hormone. Though the tendency is passed from parent
to child, no one knows precisely what triggers the antibody attack.
   Left untreated, Graves disease can be life threatening, but it
generally responds to therapy.

<HEAD>Anti-Noriega Envoy Plans To Close Embassy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Panamanian Embassy in Washington, which has
been under the control of forces opposed to Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, will be closed next week until democracy is restored to
Panama, it was announced Tuesday.
   Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, who has used the embassy as an
anti-Noriega headquarters for the past 18 months, made the
disclosure in a telephone interview on the eve of an Organization of
American States foreign ministers meeting on Panama.
   Sosa was appointed ambassador to Washington by then-President
Eric Arturo Delvalle two years ago. Delvalle was deposed by
Noriega's allies in February 1988 but the United States continues to
regard him as the legitimate authority in Panama.
   It also has continued to recognize Sosa as Panama's official
envoy.
   Sosa said he has decided to close the embassy on Aug. 31 because
Sept. 1 is the date on which Delvalle's term was scheduled to expire.
   ``We have always maintained we are fighting for a constitutional
principle,'' Sosa said, adding he and his family are vacating the
embassy and will move to an apartment in Washington. He intends to
continue his struggle against Noriega, he said.
   Sosa said State Department officials have informed him they
concur with his decision to close the embassy.
   Panamanian President Manuel Solis Palma attempted to replace Sosa
last year but the envoy, with U.S. goverment support, refused to
relinquish control of the embassy.
   Sosa has had partial access to Panamanian government funds in the
United States which were frozen by the Reagan administration to
prevent Noriega from having access to them. Sosa has used the funds
to keep the embassy functioning.
   Sosa said he held little hope that an OAS mediating team set up
three months ago will be able to fulfill its mandate of achieving a
democratic transfer of power in Panama.
   The crisis arose in Panama last May when, amid widespread
allegations of fraud, Panamanian authorities threw out the results
of the country's national elections. Independent observers said the
anti-Noriega candidate, Guillermo Endara, appeared to have won by a
large margin.
   The OAS mediators were due to return to Washington Tuesday night
and will present their report to the OAS foreign ministers on
Wednesday.
   U.S. officials, asking not to be identified, said it appear
likely Noriega will arrange for Solis Palma, a Noriega loyalist, to
be replaced by an equally reliable successor on Sept. 1. Noriega
would retain behind-the-scenes control of Panama's political life.
   This would fall short of the Bush administration's objectives for
Panama.
   ``We've supported the OAS mission,'' State Department deputy
spokesman Richard Boucher said Tuesday.
   ``We've supported the mandate they have to achieve a transfer of
power. We've stated very clearly that for that to occur Noriega must
go. We've stated very clearly our policy that there will be no
accommodation with the Noriega regime,'' he said.

   The Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health
Administration released a proposal Tuesday that would reduce the
permitted level of dust in mines as part of a general overhauling of
workplace air quality standards.
   The proposal would require operators to implement new
requirements for medical evaluation and transfer of miners exposed
to certain carcinogens, a summary of the proposal said.
   The proposal would reduce the permitted amount of dust in the
air, avberaged over an eight-hour shift, from 10 milligrams per
cubic meter (1.3 cubic yards or 35 cubic feet), measured as
non-quartz dust, to 5 milligrams of all breatheable dust not covered
by a separate substance standard.
   The proposed new standard would cover more situations, the agency
said.
   The separate standard for coal mines, 2 milligrams per cubic
meter, the agency said.
   Among other things, the new standard for asbestos would be
200,000 fibers per cubic meter instead of 2 million fibers. This
would bring the asbestos standard for mines into conformity with the
general workplace standard adopted by the sister Occupational Safety
and Health Administration in 1986.
   The public may submit comments on the proposal until Nov. 27.

   Leftist guerrillas burned buses,
bombed a government office and attacked army posts, killing 14
people and wounding 24 in two days, the military said Tuesday.
   In San Salvador, rebels burned three buses and exploded a bomb at
the Land Transportation Office to protest an increase in bus fares
that took effect three weeks ago. No one was injured and the office
was only slightly damaged.
   The attacks in the capital were part of rebel sabotage that began
when bus fares were raised from a flat rate equivalent to six cents
to a graduated scale ranging up to 14 cents. At least 35 buses have
been damaged or destroyed.
   Nine soldiers and five guerrillas were killed on Monday and
Tuesday at military posts in five provinces, and 12 rebels and 12
soldiers were wounded, the communique said, and three government
offices were heavily damaged
   In a broadcast on the clandestine radio Venceremos, the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front said Tuesday that rebels killed
seven soldiers and wounded 37 Monday in eastern Morazan and San
Miguel provinces.
   Three government helicopters were damaged, the broadcast said. An
armed forces spokesman said there were no reports of damaged
helicopters.
   Col. Sigifredo Ochoa Perez, president of the national power
utility said electricity supplies had fallen by as much as 21
percent since guerrillas destroyed four main power lines Thursday.
   He said electricity would have to be rationed if the sabotage
continued.

   A board of examiners of the U.S. Parole
Commission on Tuesday recommended that Anne Henderson-Pollard,
jailed in the espionage affair of her husband, Jonathan, be denied
early parole, her lawyer said.
   The panel heard her case at the Danbury, Conn., federal
penitentiary where she is serving a five-year sentence as an
accessory after the fact in the case, said Hamilton P. Fox. The
panel's recommendations will now pass to a regional parole
commissioner for a ruling, Fox said.
   ``This is a cruel blow,'' said Morris Pollard, her father-in-law.
He said Mrs. Pollard had lost some 70 pounds during her
incarceration because of a digestive tract ailment, and now weighs
86 pounds. She had hoped for an early release so she could treat her
medical problems, which he said prison authorities have neglected.
   Her first appeal for parole was denied last year.
   Mrs. Pollard was sentenced March 4, 1987 and is almost certain to
be granted mandatory parole under current prison guidelines at the
end of March 1990, once she has served two-thirds of her sentence.
   Her husband is serving a life sentence at the federal prison in
Marion, Ill., for selling secrets to Israel while he worked as an
intelligence analyst with the U.S. Navy.

<HEAD>Britain's Wartime Radio Doctor Dead At 85</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lord Charles Hill of Luton, once a government
minister but better known as the ``radio doctor'' dispensing advice
on aches and pains, died Tuesday, his family said. He was 85.
   Hill died at a nursing home near his home in Harpenden, 25 miles
northwest of London. The cause of death was not announced.
   A chubby pipe-smoker with an avuncular voice and the common
touch, Hill became a household name by using language clear to
everyone when he gave medical advice on the British Broadcasting
Corp. in World War II.
   ``A pain in the belly is a pain in the belly and not a discomfort
in the abdomen'' was one of his comments.
   Discussing his theories about nutrition, Hill said: ``Better
nutrition, better facilities for leisure and more security are more
important to the health of this country than all the doctors,
hospitals and clinics.''
   Hill put himself through secondary school and Cambridge
University on scholarships when his mother was widowed early.
   He trained at London Hospital, became a family physician, and in
1944 was appointed secretary of the British Medical Association.
   In 1948, Hill represented the doctors in negotiations with the
new Labor government to set up the state National Health Service,
which physicians initially opposed but now support.
   Hill's broadcasts for the Conservative Party from 1950 were
credited with helping it regain power under Sir Winston Churchill in
1951.
   Hill was elected a Conservative lawmaker in 1950.
   He held a string of government posts, including postmaster
general, chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and minister of
housing. He was also appointed chairman of the Independent
Television Authority, which oversees commercial TV, and chairman of
the governors of the tax-funded BBC.
   He was given a life peerage in 1963, taking his title from the
town of Luton, which he served as lawmaker for 13 years.
   Hill is survived by his wife, two sons and three daughters.

   The recent assassinations and the resulting government anti-drug
crackdown in Colombia are the latest upheaval in a years-long
struggle between authorities and the cocaine cartels in that South
American nation. Here is a chronology:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Sept. 14, 1979 _ Colombia and United States sign reciprocal
treaty to combat drug trafficking. In time, extradition becomes the
only fear of drug dealers, who halt effective prosecution in
Colombia through bribery, threats and assassination.
   Dec. 2, 1981 _ Colombia's top drug traffickers organize Medellin
cartel, which evolves into major cocaine smuggling operation
responsible for 80 percent of Colombian cocaine that enters United
States.
   March 10, 1984 _ Police raid cartel's Tranquilandia laboratory
complex, seizing 30,360 pounds of cocaine.
   April 30, 1984 _ Motorcycle gunmen murder Colombian Justice
Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla. Government declares state of siege
and announces it will enforce extradition treaty with United States.
   Nov. 6, 1985 _ Leftist guerrilla group M-19 takes over Palace of
Justice, holding dozens of hostages. Eleven Supreme Court judges are
among the 115 people killed. Authorities later say guerrillas were
connected with drug barons and destroyed hundreds of files on drug
trafficking.
   Feb. 19, 1986 _ Colombian hit team ambushes federal witness Barry
Seal in Louisiana.
   Nov. 18, 1986 _ U.S. prosecutors in Miami indict Medellin cartel
as ``international criminal enterprise.''
   Dec. 17, 1986 _ Guillermo Cano, editor of the daily El
Espectador, killed by motorcycle assassins.
   Feb. 4, 1987 _ Following gun battle at his mansion in Medellin,
Carlos Lehder Rivas, called ``the embodiment of a narco-terrorist''
by prosecutors, is arrested in Colombia and within hours extradited
to the United States to face drug-smuggling charges.
   June 1987 _ Supreme Court in Colombia declares extradition treaty
with United States unconstitutional.
   Dec. 31, 1987 _ U.S. extradition hopes dashed when Medellin's
reputed second-in-command, Jorge Luis Ochoa Vasquez, in prison for
importing contraband bulls, is prematurely released. Attorney
General Carlos Mauro Hoyos orders investigation and two judges and
four government officials are fired.
   Jan. 25, 1988 _ Hoyos assassinated by group known as ``Los
Extraditables,'' who announce they will kill anyone else in favor of
extraditing alleged drug traffickers. Since 1981, assassins working
for drug barons have killed 220 judges, magistrates and judicial
aides, plus two newspaper editors and scores of police officers and
soldiers.
   Jan. 27, 1988 _ President Virgilio Barco announces emergency
measures to battle traffickers and creates 5,000 new posts in
national judiciary system.
   July 20, 1988 _ Lehder sentenced by federal judge in Florida to
maximum life sentence without parole plus 135 years and fined
$350,000 for cocaine smuggling.
   Aug. 18, 1989 _ Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, leading presidential
candidate and outspoken foe of drug lords, assassinated. Galan
killing, combined with murders of a judge and a police colonel the
day before, sparks nationwide crackdown and imposition of emergency
measures such as allowing extradition without judicial review. More
than 11,000 people arrested.

<HEAD>Government Calls For Completion of Damage Studies by February</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed government plan for determining
damages from the Exxon oil spill released Tuesday called for
environmental studies to be completed by next February, a time
critics said was too short.
   The plan, drawn up by the Interior Department, is a broad outline
of procedures to be used in the assessment process that eventually
will determine how much the Exxon Corp. will have to pay to restore
Alaska's environment, including long-term damages to wildlife and
other natural resources.
   A group of government trustees, who are charged under federal law
to make the long-term damage assessment, asked that interested
parties comment on the broad outline by the end of September before
it becomes final.
   The 258-page proposed plan makes no damage assessments nor does
it set a dollar value on possible damages.
   However, the report directs that all environmental studies that
are to be used in determining damage should be completed over the
next six months. ``No further studies will be conducted after Feb.
28, 1990,'' the document says.
   If any additional studies are to be conducted after February they
may be only at the recommendation of the government trustee council
and scientific and legal review groups ``as being necessary to
promote restoration and to support assessment of legally recoverable
natural resource damages,'' the document said.
   The short timetable brought almost immediate criticism from some
environmental groups, who claim that significant damages from the
spill last March off southern Alaska will not be known for years. In
fact, cleanup efforts are not even likely to be completed by then,
resulting in cases where oil may still be causing new damages, the
critics maintained.
   ``This plan could lead to a serious underestimation of harm to
the environment and a limited recovery of damages from Exxon,''
maintained Sarah Chasis, an attorney for the Natural Resources
Defense Council. ``The first year's damages will tell only part of
the story.''
   Ms. Chasis said there also is concern that the plan does not make
clear the role of the Exxon Corp. in the assessment plan. Exxon
executives have said they want to participate in the determination
of damages to wildlife and natural resources as a result of the
March 24 spill that dumped 11 million gallons of oil into pristine
Prince William Sound.
   The proposed assessment plan said a decision on whether to allow
Exxon to participate and if so, to what extent, has yet to be made.
   Bob Walker, an Interior Department spokesman, acknowleged that
there had been discussions on whether to allow longer studies of
environmental damages before moving ahead to making actual damage
assessments. According to other sources, who asked not to be
identified, some participants argued that in some cases as long as
five years may be needed to determine damages to certain wildlife.
   ``The trustees wanted to get to restoration as fast as possible
and not take a leisurely approach to studying whatever needs to be
studied,'' said Walker.
   He said the timetable is not necessarily final and objections can
be raised by intrested parties during the comment period.
   Some of the studies to be completed by February already are under
way, said Walker.

<HEAD>Bulgaria Protests Turkish Decision on Refugees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Tuesday accused Turkey of
hyprocrisy for its decision requiring that ethnic Turks immigrating
from Bulgaria first obtain visas.
   Turkish border officials said they had strict orders, beginning
Tuesday, to turn away the refugees waiting to cross into Turkey.
However, the semi-official Turkish news agency Anatolia said 522
were allowed to cross without visas anyway.
   The refugees say they are fleeing a harsh assimilation campaign
in Bulgaria.
   The Turkish government announced its move Monday, saying it would
require the visas because Bulgaria's communist leaders have refused
to start talks on an accord to protect the emigrants. Turkish
officials said the new requirement would give them more control over
the influx.
   However, Turkish opposition parties accused the government of
backing away from its pledge to accept all ethnic Turks who want to
come.
   Turkey's ambassador to Sofia was summoned to the Foreign Ministry
on Monday to hear Bulgarian complaints about the ``exceedingly harsh
predicament'' of thousands of Bulgarian Turks en route to Turkey,
the official Bulgarian BTA news agency said.
   ``The Turkish government's decision to close its border to
Bulgarian citizens proves the hypocrisy and the instigation of the
Turkish mass media and officials who used to claim that unobstructed
admission will be secured for all Muslim Bulgarians,'' BTA quoted
the Communist Party daily newspaper Rabotnichesko Delo as saying.
   ``This decision debunked a myth which has been persistently
propagated by the stage managers of the anti-Bulgarian propaganda:
that Turkey is the `mother country,' the real homeland of Moslem
Bulgarians,'' the newspaper said.
   Bulgaria blames Turkey for refusing to hold talks on reaching an
immigration agreement, BTA said.
   About 310,000 Bulgarian Turks have flooded into Turkey in the
past three months. They say the assimilation campaign, begun in
1984, has prevented them from using their Turkish names, speaking
Turkish or practicing Islamic rites.
   About 1.5 million ethnic Turks live in Bulgaria.
   Turkey says an immigration accord should stipulate that those who
leave be compensated for property left behind and accumulated social
security. It also says families should be kept together.
   Turkish officials say ethnic Turks can now obtain visas from
Turkey's consulates at Burgas and Sofia in Bulgaria.
   Anatolia said Turkish authorities tried to turn back the refugees
who crossed at the Kapuikule border post Tuesday without visas.
However, some of the refugees tried to jump from the windows of the
train they were in, and officials agreed to let the group cross, the
agency said.
   In Istanbul, Turkey, members of a U.S. congressional delegation
criticized Bulgaria.
   Senators Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz, and Frank R. Lautenberg,
D-N.J., and Rep. Bob McEwen, R-Ohio, said they interviewed ethnic
Turks in Bulgaria who were waiting near the border on Monday to go
to Turkey.
   ``It was painfully obvious that the Bulgarian government had
forced, by its policies of discrimination against Turks in Bulgaria,
hundreds of thousands of men, women and children out of their homes
with only the possessions they can carry,'' DeConcini told a news
conference Tuesday in Istanbul.
   The Americans are members of the congressional Helsinki
Commission, which monitors the Helsinki accords on human rights
signed by 35 nations in 1975.

<TEXT>
   State-run media on Tuesday blamed
foreigners visiting under the guise of tourists for stirring up
protests by thousands on the 21st anniversary of the 1968 Soviet-led
invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   Authorities said 370 people, including 50 foreigners, were
arrested.
   By Tuesday night, no word emerged on the fate of Hungarians,
Poles and Italians arrested when hundreds of helmeted riot police
wielding truncheons broke up crowds demanding freedom and withdrawal
of Soviet troops who crushed the ``Prague Spring'' reforms 21 years
ago.
   Hungarian consul Lajos Taba said his embassy received telephone
calls indicating nine Hungarians were detained. Polish press attache
Kzrysztof Opalski said he heard on state radio that three Poles were
held, but that the Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry had given his
embassy no official word on detentions.
   Extra police remained on patrol Tuesday in Prague's central
Wenceslas Square, checking the papers of bystanders and Western
journalists. A folk group and brass band played on the spot where
Monday's protests erupted.
   Prague radio asserted that 1,000 Italians and 3,000 Polish
Solidarity activists had come to the capital under what it termed
``tourism in disguise'' to stir up the demonstrations.
   ``The provocation was brought about by those who traveled under
the guise of tourism,'' said a similar commentary on TV. ``They came
here to give us advice. Nobody likes this and we Czechoslovaks are
no exception.''
   The commentaries were an apparent attempt by Czechoslovakia's
entrenched leadership to ignore domestic pressure for reform and
depict such pressure as the work of outsiders.
   In a dispatch from Prague, Poland's official PAP news agency
challenged Czechoslovak media reports.
   ``It is worth stressing that there is no proof that Poles and
Solidarity representatives took part in the disturbances in downtown
Prague,'' PAP said.
   It said the Polish Embassy was unable to obtain the identities of
any Poles detained and sent a note to the Foreign Ministry seeking
information so it can ``get in touch with them and explain their
legal position.''
   In Rome, Italy's Foreign Ministry summoned Czechoslovakia's
charge d'affaires to complain that the detention of the Italians was
``unjustified'' and the behavior of Czechoslovak authorities was
``in clear contradiction with the new climate of faith and openness
characterizing East-West relations.''
   The Italian news agency ANSA, quoting ministry sources, said
eight Italians were arrested in Prague.
   Czechoslovak authorities and media had campaigned for weeks prior
to the anniversary against independent groups and warned that force
would be used to break up protests.
   Police have cracked down hard on independent activists in recent
weeks, harassing several and cutting their telephones. Charter 77
spokeswoman Dana Nemcova said Tuesday that dozens of people were put
in preventive detention over the weekend.
   Some of those were free Tuesday, but others were still
unaccounted for, said Nemcova, who with her activist son, David, was
under house arrest from early Sunday until late Monday night.
   Many other leading activists were warned to stay out of Prague
and other big cities. Some, including prominent human rights
campaigner Vaclav Havel, appealed against street protests, fearing
bloodshed.
   Several of the 370 people the Communist Party daily Rude Pravo
said were detained Monday were beaten by police. But the newspaper
said no one was seriously hurt.
   Police attacks on Western journalists drew strong criticism
abroad.
   Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock condemned what he termed the
``aggressive behavior'' of the police, who detained two Austrian
cameramen, sliced their camera cable with a knife, and struck one of
the crew.
   Italy protested the rough handling of two Italian journalists
who, the Italian television channel Rai Due said, were punched by
plainclothes men and had their cameras damaged.
   A West German TV crew also was detained briefly Monday in what
appeared to be an attempt by police to limit footage shown on
Western TV stations that can be received in Czechoslovakia and to
curb damage to Prague's reputation abroad.
   The Communist leadership put in power after Moscow crushed the
1968 reforms has come under mounting pressure at home and from East
bloc reformers to adopt some of the changes under way in Hungary,
Poland and the Soviet Union.

   An East German was shot to death in a
struggle with Hungarian border guards, officials said Tuesday,
intensifying a diplomatic crisis caused by thousands of East Germans
fleeing their rigid communist regime.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl repeated an offer to meet with East German
leader Erich Honecker on the refugee problem, but said only reforms
would halt the flow.
   West Germany said it was closing its embassy in Prague,
Czechoslovakia, to refugees because it was overwhelmed by East
German refugees. Government sources said more than 100 East Germans
had packed the embassy to demand emigration help.
   Bonn closed its embassy in Budapest and its mission in East
Berlin this month because of the crush of East Germans trying to get
to West Germany.
   About 200 East Germans fled across the Hungarian-Austrian border
Tuesday in the second mass flight in four days, border guards and
police said in Vienna, bringing the total of East Germans arriving
in Austria on Tuesday to about 500.
   The Hungarian news agency MTI reported the first death resulting
from the wave of escapes.
   It said Kurt-Werner Schulz was shot about 30 feet inside Austria
Monday night while trying to cross the border with his wife and
6-year-old daughter. MTI described the shooting Monday as an
accident. It said the wife and child were unhurt and were in
Hungarian custody, adding that the family failed in an earlier
border-crossing attempt.
   Hungary began dismantling its barbed-wire barrier with Austria in
May. Until the Schulz incident, no serious injuries were reported in
the illegal exodus, but hundreds were caught and detained for short
periods.
   East Berlin authorities can take years to process applications
for legal emigration and often reject specialists and younger
workers because of the nation's widespread labor shortage.
   Travel visas to Hungary are relatively easy for East Germans to
obtain, and some of the estimated 200,000 traveling in Hungary this
month have taken their chances with what appeared to be a new escape
route to the West.
   Bonn's Foreign Ministry said of the Schulz case that it
``disturbed over the death of a fellow German.'' It demanded a
detailed explanation and Hungarian assurances that armed force would
not be used to halt East German escapees.
   The rate of escapes and emigration to West Germany this year is
the largest migration from East Germany since the Berlin Wall was
built in 1961, and may exceed 100,000 by the end of the year.
   More than 65,000 East Germans have arrived in West Germany in
1989, including more than 2,000 who escaped illegally in recent
weeks by sneaking through recently relaxed borders between Hungary
and Austria.
   Refugees flooding the main West German transit camp in Giessen
have said they left after losing hope that Honecker's leadership
would ever ease restrictions on travel, emigration and expression.
   The latest mass escape took place Tuesday evening near
Klingenbach, Austrian customs officers said. They said buses would
take the 200 East Germans to the West German Embassy in Vienna,
which is providing hotel accommodation for newly arriving East
Germans.
   Earlier Tuesday, about 300 East Germans crossed into Austria from
Hungary at various border points, hours after Schulz was shot.
   A mass escape of East Germans took place Saturday when 661 people
walked into Austria after a border barrier, normally closed, was
opened for an international picnic.
   The shooting occurred near Lutzmannsburg, about 15 miles south of
Sopron, western Hungary.
   MTI said Schulz knocked a guard down with his bag and kicked him
in the head after two border patrols fired warning shots and ordered
the family to stop. The fray took the participants into Austrian
territory, it said.
   The agency said Schulz tried to seize the guard's gun and it went
off, fatally wounding Schulz.
   He died while guards were taking him back to Hungary for medical
aid, MTI and the Austrian Interior Ministry reported.
   Most of the 171 East Germans in the West German Embassy in
Budapest are people caught in escape attempts. Despite East German
assurances they won't be punished if they return voluntarily, they
refuse to leave.
   Under the West German constitution, East Germans are entitled to
immediate citizenship in West Germany.
   East German authorities have told Bonn relations could suffer if
West Germany's embassies in Budapest, East Berlin, Prague and Warsaw
continue to shelter the refugees.
   ``We don't want a confrontation,'' Kohl said. But he made clear
that changes must be made within East Germany to halt the escape
trend.
   Kohl dismissed East Berlin's contention the escape spree is the
result of Western enticement.
   ``The pressure for change is not coming from the West, but from
Poland and the Soviet Union and Hungary,'' Kohl said, applauding the
reform movement sweeping those countries.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev made
clear Tuesday that Poland cannot solve its problems without the
Communist Party, a party spokesman said.
   Gorbachev, who leads the Soviet Union's Communist Party, spoke
for 40 minutes by telephone with Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, head of
Poland's Communist Party, said party spokesman Jan Bisztyga.
   ``Gorbachev expressed confidence that the Polish party would
successfully solve the social and economic problems in the interest
of socialism and voiced the conviction that solving these problems
is impossible without'' the Communist Party, Bisztyga said.
   Poland's Communist Party is pressing for maximum representation
in the new Cabinet.
   The conversation came as Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the Solidarity prime
minister-designate, held talks on forming the East bloc's first
government led by non-communists.
   Mazowiecki met with leaders of Poland's political factions and
said he hopes to form his government within a week.
   The parliament vote to confirm his nomination as prime minister
was postponed from Wednesday to Thursday to allow further
consultations, said Sejm Speaker Mikolaj Kozakiewicz.
   Although there are enough votes for Mazowiecki's election, even
without support from the Communist Party, the prime
minister-designate faces the delicate task of balancing competing
interests in the new alliance.
   Mazowiecki met Jan Janowski, the floor leader of the Democratic
Party, outgoing Prime Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak and Marian
Orzechowski, the parliamentary leader of the Communist Party.
   The long, one-on-one meeting with Kiszczak at an undisclosed
location was ``serious and interesting,'' Mazowiecki said afterward
at the offices of the Solidarity weekly he edits.
   Later at the National Assembly, Mazowiecki said he had ``a very
intensive conversation about problems which interest us'' with
Orzechowski. He also met with the speakers of the Sejm and Senate,
the two chambers of the National Assembly.
   The distribution of portfolios and the name of future ministers
are the capital's most sought-after secret, and the competition for
them among parties apparently is intense.
   Mazowiecki has so far given no details of his intentions, saying
only that he wants the ``broadest possible'' coalition of pro-reform
forces from every party.
   However, the Communist Party was promised the defense and
interior ministries, controlling the army and police, as part of
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa's agreement with President Wojciech
Jaruzelski, who is allowing Solidarity to take charge of the first
non-communist government in Eastern Europe in more than 40 years.
   The Communist Party, in a Central Committee resolution Sunday,
demanded more than those two ministries and has said it wants to be
treated as a full governing partner. The two minor parties that
joined a coalition with Solidarity are also pressing for the maximum
number of seats.
   ``Are there enough portfolios?'' the opposition newspaper Gazeta
Wyborcza asked in an ironic headline.
   There are 19 government ministries or government leve offices,
but the number could be expanded or reduced. For instance,
Solidarity has discussed creating a ministry for national minorities.
   According to the newspaper, the United Peasant Party wants five
ministries plus a deputy premiership.
   The Democrats want three to four ministries and one deputy prime
minister, Janowski said in a statement issued by PAP. The Democrats
favor ``the principle of avoiding a decisive domination of any of
the forces participating in the government,'' he said.
   The Communist Party has said it must have enough ministries to
correspond to its ``political and state potential,'' but has not
said what that number is. Orzechowski declined to comment on his
party's demands after meeting Mazowiecki.
   The party's top body, the Politburo, met Tuesday to consider its
stance on the government. The Communist Party is ``ready to take up
co-responsibility determined by the responsibilities which are
created for it,'' according to a statement carried by PAP.
   Tensions emerged between the Communist Party and its former
coalition partners as the Democrats and Peasants issued statements
critical of an Aug. 19 Central Committee resolution that said a
Solidarity-led government would be ``destabilizing.''
   As Mazowiecki, a longtime adviser to Walesa, began steps to
assemble a government, there were signs of anxiety about the future
of a non-communist government.
   The opposition newspaper carries a front-page cartoon showing a
wall with graffiti saying, ``The summer is yours, the ZOMO (riot
police) are ours.''
   A war of words continued between the Communist Party and Walesa,
with the party daily criticizing the union leader's statement Monday
in which he warned the party to abandon ``threats and blackmail.''
   ``It is a pity there are only generalities (in Walesa's
statement). It would be worthwhile to point out the parts of the
Central Committee stands which are `threats and blackmail,''' the
editorial said.
   ``These are sharp words which should not be used by either of the
two main political forces in Poland,'' that is Solidarity or the
party, the editorial said.
   It said the party is only being reasonable when it says it will
withhold support from the Mazowiecki government until it learns its
program. It said the party cannot agree that Solidarity has ``common
and unlimited support'' in Poland.

   A former secretary for ex-Attorney
General Charlie Brown was indicted Tuesday on charges she extorted
money from Brown to keep quiet about a pregnancy he allegedly was
responsible for.
   The indictment came one day after Brown abruptly quit rather than
face a grand jury investigation.
   The indictment charged Brenda K. Simon of Columbus, Ohio, with
one count of extortion and one count of obtaining money under false
pretenses.
   In addition, her attorneys dropped a $3 million libel suit filed
Aug. 11 against The Charleston Gazette, citing the criminal
investigation.
   The Gazette had reported that Simon, 35, who worked for the
attorney general in 1985 and 1986, demanded $50,000 from Brown to
keep quiet about getting pregnant by him and having an abortion in
1986.
   Both Brown and Simon denied the allegations when they were made
by the Gazette. Simon said she had a baby girl in July 1986, but the
child died the next day. She said the father was Kenneth Dale
Thaxton, her husband.
   The indictment said she obtained at least $200 from Brown, which
is the legal minimum to bring the felony charge, said Kanawha County
Prosecutor Bill Forbes. The indictment said Brown had appeared
before the grand jury that indicted Simon.
   Forbes said the state had reports that Simon obtained $7,500 to
$50,000 from Brown from January to December 1986.
   ``She signed a note saying she had an abortion,'' Forbes said.
Asked if Brown was the father of the child, Forbes said,
``Obviously, he thought so.''
   If convicted of extortion, Simon faces up to five years in
prison, Forbes said. The false pretenses charge carries a maximum
penalty of 10 years and a $500 fine on conviction.
   Brown, a Democrat, resigned Monday. In return, the Kanawha County
prosecutor's office dismissed the grand jury probe into allegations
that Brown lied under oath and grew to include his campaign
financial records.
   Gov. Gaston Caperton will name a successor to Brown.
   Lawyers for Simon filed a notice Tuesday in Ohio County Circuit
Court asking for the dismissal of the lawsuit against the Gazette.
According to her lawyers, Simon's testimony in her civil suit would
compromise her in the criminal investigation.
   Crady Swisher, an attorney for Simon, declined comment on the
indictment and dropping of the lawsuit. Thaxton, reached at the
couple's home in Columbus, Ohio, said his wife would have no comment.
   Brown, 39, whose brother is secretary of state of Ohio, read a
statement to reporters Tuesday morning, saying he was stepping down
from the post to shield his 5-year-old daughter from continuing
publicity about the case. He declined to answer questions.
   Brown said he did not lie during sworn statements at a child
support hearing in May, when he corrected himself after misspeaking
at one point in questioning. The questions allegedly dealt with
Simon and the funds, the Gazette said.
   Brown's financial records from 1984 and 1988 were subpoenaed as
part of the grand jury investigation, but Forbes declined to say
what they were looking for. He said the case is closed.
   Brown, first elected in 1984 and re-elected in 1988, was found
innocent in 1986 on eight state misdemeanor counts of soliciting his
staff for campaign contributions.
   He is the second top state official to resign this year.
Ex-Treasurer A. James Manchin quit July 9 rather than face an
impeachment trial in the Senate.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on Tuesday
announced the top 12 alleged Colombian drug traffickers the Justice
Department wants extradited and said the United States should not
bow to fears that it might become the target of the violence that
has plagued Colombia.
   ``Whatever consequences ensue from our enforcing the law are part
of the risk that we assume in a society that depends upon the rule
of law,'' Thornburgh said during a sidewalk news conference.
   ``We can't succumb in this country to what has already brought
the criminal justice system to its knees in Colombia,'' he said.
``They are rising from their knees, they are standing up to these
drug traffickers and they deserve every bit of support that we can
give them, and that support will be forthcoming.''
   The ``Dozen Most Wanted'' list includes the leadership of the
Medellin and Cali cocaine cartels, but not the one alleged Medellin
money-launderer who has been arrested in Colombia, Eduardo Martinez
Romero.
   However, Thornburgh said, ``We are taking steps to provide the
necessary documentation to secure his extradition to the United
States.''
   A Colombian official said in Bogota that the first moves toward
extraditing Martinez had already been made.
   In all, about 80 alleged Colombian drug traffickers are under
indictment in the United States, but their cases have languished
since the Colombian Supreme Court overturned its extradition treaty
with the United States in 1987, the department said.
   Colombian President Virgilio Barco instituted emergency measures
over the weekend to allow the immediate resumption of extraditions.
His action was triggered by the assassination Friday of Luis Carlos
Galan, a leading presidential candidate and an outspoken foe of the
drug traffickers.
   Colombian drug gangs assassinated more than 50 magistrates and
judges in recent years, and had almost terrorized all other civil
and military authorities into acquiescence to their operations.
   Thornburgh praised the Colombian government's crackdown that has
resulted in the arrests of some 11,000 people.
   ``We are very grateful for the ... kind of courage that has been
displayed'' by the Colombians, Thornburgh said. The efforts, he
said, ``can lead to better cooperation in securing criminal
convictions of these very prominent figures in the drug cartels.''
   Included in the list of the top 12 are reputed Medellin cartel
leaders Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria, 39, Jorge Luis Ochoa Vasquez,
40, and Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, 42.
   Also on the list are:
   _Two of Ochoa Vasquez's brothers, Fabio, 32, and Juan David, 41,
along with Gustavo de Jesus Gaviria Rivero, 42, and Gerardo Moncada,
42. All are allegedly members of the Medellin cartel.
   _Jose Ivan Duarte Acero, 37, a former policeman who allegedly
works with the Medellin cartel. He is ``the gunman ... who was
responsible for the attempted murder of two of our agents down
there,'' said Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Con
Dougherty.
   _The reputed leaders of the Cali cartel: Gilberto Jose Rodriguez
Orjuela, 50; Miguel Angel Rodriguez Orjuela, 45; and Jose Santacruz
Londono, 45. Also on the list is alleged Cali cartel member Jamie
Raul Orjuela Caballero, 46.
   ``Facing trial in the United States is what these drug lords fear
the most,'' Thornburgh had said earlier in a statement. ``This list
of a dozen priority offenders is only the first phase of our
extradition efforts. Our review of those whom we seek for trial is
on-going and the list is likely to be supplemented in the near
future.''
   Thornburgh said during the news conference that in addition to
supplying the names to the Colombians, the names have also been put
on the INTERPOL network to encourage international efforts to find
those that may have fled Colombia because of the crackdown.
   ``We don't know the whereabouts of any of these individuals,'' he
said.
   Asked what the Colombians need the most to fight the drug
cartels, Thornburgh said the ``enormous appetite for drugs'' must be
curbed.
   ``Every cocaine sniffer and crack smoker in this country
contributes to the violence and the enormous profits that are reaped
by the Colombian drug traffickers,'' he said.
   The Drug Enforcement Administration said the complete list of
people whose extradition may be sought numbers from 50 to 100. The
Justice Department is reviewing that list to determine which
extraditions should be sought if the targets are arrested.

   A Bogota newspaper reports there may have
been an Arab connection in the assassination of Sen. Luis Carlos
Galan. It was the latest suggestion foreign mercenaries are involved
in Colombia's drug-related bloodshed.
   Earlier accounts in the news media have said there were
indications British, Israeli and South African mercenaries were
training assassination teams for the drug cartels.
   Galan, the nation's leading presidential candidate, was shot on
Friday at a political rally. The killing prompted an emergency
declaration by authorities and a crackdown on the powerful drug
cartels.
   According to the conservative Bogota newspaper El Siglo, police
are investigating what appears to be an Arab link to Galan's murder.
   It quoted an unidentified witness on Monday as saying that just
before the killing the man who shot Galan was heard speaking to an
accomplice in a foreign language, and the killer left behind at the
scene a copy of the Egyptian newspaper Al Ahram.
   El Siglo carried a photograph of the newspaper, dated June 3,
1989.
   Police said the drug cartel based in the industrial city of
Medellin, the world center for cocaine trafficking, had offered $1
million for Galan's assassination. An attempt to kill him on Aug. 4
was frustrated by authorities.
   Military and police authorities also say the drug cartels are
using some of their billion-dollar profits to arm and train squads
of hired assassins in a loose association with right-wing extremists.
   On April 10, local newspapers cited national police documents as
saying that Israeli and British mercenaries were providing training
to the death squads at camps in a rural northeastern Colombia.
   Shortly after those reports a national television chain broadcast
a video tape it said was received from the death squads. It showed
men in military-style uniforms training with high-powered automatic
weapons. The video included an interview with a purported trainer,
who spoke Spanish with a foreign accent and kept his back turned to
the cameara.
   In the United States, NBC Nightly News on Monday showed videotape
it said was obtained from Colombian television of ``drug assassins
in training at a secret base camp somewhere in Colombia.'' It said
the video was made available by the cocaine cartel, ``apparently as
a kind of video warning of what the cartel would do if the
government moved against it.''
   The reporter, Brian Ross, said Colombian and American authorities
identified some of the trainers shown in the video as ``Israelis and
South Africans, former military men now training Colombian drug
armies in assassination and terror techniques.''
   On Aug. 13, the Sunday Times of London reported that British
mercenaries are being used by a drug cartel based in the city of
Cali that is engaged in a bloody, 18-month-old feud with the
Medellin cartel.
   The newspaper said British mercenaries were hired to kill
Medellin cartel leader Pablo Escobar by bombing a rural ranch he
owns from two helicopters. It said one helicopter was too weighted
down with arms and crashed on June 4, and the other turned back.
   The paper said that upon learning of the attempt, Escobar
launched a similar plot to kill Cali cartel boss Gilberto Rodriguez
Orijuela, but mechanical failure forced the Escobar helicopter to
make an emergency landing July 12.
   Authorities have confirmed accidents involving helicopters on the
dates cited in the reports. In both cases, police pilots were
involved, officials said. In the July 12 incident, authorities
reported finding $259,000 in cash abroad the aircraft.
   But officials cast doubt on the report. ``The newspaper reports
events that really have taken place but it frames them in a novel
situation that goes beyond qualification,'' said police Gen. Carlos
Casadiego.

   Showers and thunderstorms drenched the Midwest and Southeast on
Tuesday, and thunderstorms developed in Texas, where flash flood
watches were in effect.
   Warm, humid Gulf of Mexico air continued producing showers and
thunderstorms from Kansas to central Missouri and the lower Ohio
Valley. Up to 1{ inches of rain drenched lower Michigan and Ohio.
Nearly half an inch of rain fell in 20 minutes at Indianapolis.
   The moist, unstable air also triggered showers and thunderstorms
across the central and eastern Gulf Coast, Florida, the Tennessee
Valley and the southern Atlantic Coast.
   Thunderstorms were developing again across southwest Texas, which
recently received heavy rains, and officials feared additional
rainfall could produce flooding. A flash flood watch was in effect
in the area.
   A wind advisory was posted for western Nevada because of a cold
front moving out of the Pacific Northwest that was expected to
generate winds up to 40 mph. The front has has been producing
showers from the northern Rockies into Oregon.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Baker, Ore., to 99 degrees at Beeville, Texas.
   The low for the lower 48 states was 35 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   Wednesday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
the northern and middle Atlantic Coast to the central Appalachians,
the upper Ohio Valley, the upper Great Lakes region, the Gulf Coast
and sections of the central Plains. Rain showers and a few
thunderstorms were predicted for the northern Rockies and the
Pacific Northwest.
   Temperatures were expected to climb into the 90s across much of
the nation, the 60s and 70s in the Pacific Northwest and the
northern Rockies, the 70s and 80s along the California coast and in
Nevada, the upper Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes, the upper
Ohio Valley and New England; and between 100 and 110 degrees in the
desert Southwest, the interior valleys of Southern California and
near the Big Bend of the Rio Grande in Texas.

   A 9-year-old girl who trudged through snow
and rain last winter selling Girl Scout cookies in hopes of meeting
the governor finally gets her chance Wednesday, long after writing
an essay titled ``I Didn't Meet the Governor, But I Got to Know
Myself.''
   Robyn Rivard of Hartford wrote the eight-page essay after she
sold 1,504 boxes of cookies _ more than any other Hartford-area
Brownie or Scout sold last winter _ but still hadn't met Gov.
William A. O'Neill, as someone had mistakenly promised her she would.
   In the handwritten essay, Miss Rivard tells of her inspiration
for selling the cookies _ her grandmother's challenge and the
promise of a photo opportunity with the governor. She also recounts
some of the things she learned during two cookie-selling seasons.
   ``I learned that selling cookies for 6 hours strate made my legs
real tired and my hands froozen,'' she wrote.
   ``I learned that people buy cookies best when you sell them
during a snowstorm. Because I looked so sad and helpless standing
there with icesickles hanging off my nose.
   ``Sometimes when I called up people on the fone and they would
hang up on me before I got to say what I wanted to say. I would call
them back and say `Excuse me but we were acsidently cut off! Now as
I was saying ...' And then they would usually buy cookies and mommy
and I would laugh and laugh!''
   After selling 1,165 boxes in the winter of 1987-88, second-best
in the Hartford area, Miss Rivard set out last winter with her
mother and her brother Jayson and earned top sales honors.
   Prizes included a videocassette recorder, but not a meeting with
the governor.
   ``I still wish I could meet the governor though,'' the
fourth-grader wrote. ``Maybe he'd like to buy a box or two of
cookies.''
   The essay, written at her mother's urging last December, was
published in a Girl Scout newsletter and eventually found its way
into O'Neill's hands.
   ``He read the story and said it was a remarkable
accomplishment,'' said gubernatorial press secretary Jon Sandberg.
``He asked us to find her and ask her if she wanted to come in.''
   In a telephone interview Tuesday, Miss Rivard looked forward to
her visit to the Capitol and offered advice to other would-be cookie
moguls: ``Always look adorable.''
   Also, she said, ``I always ask people if they would like to try
the honey-glazed chocolate chip.''

   They're making moonshine at the West
Virginia State Fair, but the revenuers need not worry _ it's not for
sale or consumption.
   Claude Minton and Don Tripplet of North Wilkesboro, N.C., have
set up their steam-powered still at the festival to give fairgoers a
closeup view of how moonshine is made.
   ``We're not allowed to let anyone carry it off and we can't sell
it,'' said Minton. But he will offer a sniff to anyone interested.
   ``It's 160 proof,'' he warned.
   Minton has shown off his licensed moonshine plant at fairs and
festivals for 10 years. He says his license lets him operate the
still in the Carolinas, Virginia and West Virginia.
   Minton says he was introduced to ``white lightning'' when he was
13 years old.
   ``I lived by an old man who made moonshine, and he got me into
peddling it for him,'' he said. ``If my dad had found out, he would
have busted my pants.''
   Minton said he stopped selling moonshine years ago.

<TEXT>
   Workers at 25 state factories and businesses in the
republic of Azerbaijan were on strike for a second day Tuesday to
press ethnic demands for control of a disputed territory, according
to local sources.
   In the republic of Moldavia, workers walked off the job for the
second time in five days to protest proposed legislation that would
make Moldavian that republic's official language.
   Nine factories were closed in Azerbaijan on Tuesday, Natan
Barsky, editor in chief of the Azerinform news agency, said from the
capital of Baku.
   But other local residents said the strike was much broader,
affecting almost 100 businesses and involving hundreds of thousands
of Baku residents.
   Nazim Ragimov, a journalist, said the work stoppages included an
oil refinery, several defense plants, an air-conditioner factory and
five loading docks.
   The strike was schedulewd to end Tuesday night, but organizers
have threatened to prolong it or call a general strike for Sept. 2
if they are not satisfied by the government response.
   The walkout was organized by the Azerbaijani People's Front, a
group that is fighting for Azerbaijani control over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian region taken from Azerbaijan
earlier this year.
   The region was put under the Kremlin's direct control to settle a
dispute over it between the republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia.
   The People's Front has sponsored mass rallies in Baku for weeks.
   Among its other demands are that the results of spring
legislative elections be annulled and that People's Front activists
detained in Baku rallies in November and December be freed.
   The Soviet Tass news agency reported from Kishinev, the capital
of Moldavia, that workers were on strike at factories in Tirasapol
to protest the draft language law.
   A law making Moldavian the official language of the small
republic that borders Romania will be considered by the republic's
legislature on Aug. 29.
   Most workers in Tiraspol are non-Moldavian speakers such as
Ukrainians and Russians.
   Tass did not say how long the strike was expected to last or how
many people took part.

   A single-engine float

catch a commercial flight at Yellowknife.
   ``After it settled in the water there was a fire,'' said Harry

   Eduardo Martinez Romero, seized in a weekend
sweep by Colombian authorities, had escaped arrest last spring in
Panama on the day U.S. officials announced his indictment in
connection with a $1.2 billion money-laundering operation.
   Martinez, described by Colombian officials as a 35-year-old
economist, was indicted in March as part of ``Operation Polar Cap,''
which resulted in charges against 127 people and two Latin American
banks.
   ``He's one of the Medellin cartel's financial chiefs, not the
biggest one, but certainly an important one,'' Drug Enforcement
Administration spokesman Frank Shults said Tuesday. ``His arrest is
the arrest of a significant figure in that investigation.''
   Polar Cap uncovered a money-laundering operation that reached
across the United States into South America and to England, with
direct ties to the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia, Justice
Department officials said. It laundered an estimated $1.2 billion
over two years, they said.
   Martinez was arrested during the weekend in the northern
Department of Sucre, and Colombian national police said they started
proceedings Tuesday to hand Martinez over to the United States in a
test of a new emergency plan for extraditing people alleged to be
top drug traffickers.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the United States is moving
to extradite Martinez, despite the fact that his name was not on a
list of the ``Dozen Most Wanted'' drug traffickers Thornburgh sent
Tuesday to the Colombian government. The list focused on the leaders
of the Medellin and Cali cartels.
   ``We are taking steps to provide the necessary documentation to
secure his extradition to the United States,'' Thornburgh said. The
attorney general said Martinez is the ``only individual facing
indictment in the United States that we know of who has been picked
up'' by Colombian authorities.
   Thornburgh's chief of staff, Robert Ross, said later that it was
not clear how long the process would take.
   ``The quickest thing that could happen is they could put him on a
plane and send him to the United States'' without waiting for any
additional paperwork, Ross said.
   Martinez was among 11,000 people arrested in an emergency
crackdown triggered by Friday's assassination of a leading
presidential candidate who was an outspoken foe of drug traffickers.
   The Bogota newspaper El Tiempo reported Monday that Martinez
declared his innocence in statements made while jailed in Bogota.
``At no time have I had links to the Medellin cartel and I don't
know any of its members,'' he was quoted as saying. The newspaper
said that, when arrested, he had none of the heavily armed
bodyguards who usually accompany drug lords.
   On March 29, the day the Polar Cap indictments were announced,
Thornburgh told reporters that Martinez was holed up in a bank in
Panama, surrounded by Panamanian Defense Forces seeking to arrest
him for U.S. authorities. Martinez had been scheduled to meet that
day with undercover agents in Panama, he said.
   However, later in the afternoon, Martinez somehow managed to
escape from the bank, said Bruce Pagel, a trial attorney with the
Justice Department's narcotics section.
   The Panamanian Defense Forces are headed by Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, who is under indictment in the United States on federal
drug-trafficking charges.
   Martinez is described in the indictment as an associate and agent
of Geraldo Moncada, whom the U.S. government accused of organizing,
supervising and managing for the Medellin cartel the importation,
sale and distribution of cocaine in the United States, and, in
particular, New York.
   According to the indictment, issued in Atlanta, Martinez was
involved mainly with ``La Mina,'' or ``The Mine,'' the name the drug
world uses for the money-laundering operation.
   Martinez directly contracted with ``La Mina'' and the undercover
agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration to launder the illegal
drug proceeds of the cartel, the indictment says.
   ``Eduardo Martinez acted as a `broker' in negotiating with
various money-laundering groups as to their cost and services in
laundering the cartel's drug monies,'' the indictment says.
``Eduardo Martinez paid monies to co-defendants William Guarin and
Clara Garcia to ensure that laundered drug proceeds which had been
transferred to co-defendant Banco de Occidente were not seized by
law enforcement authorities.''
   The Banco de Occidente SA, a Panamanian institution, pleaded
guilty earlier this month to laundering more than $400 million in
drug money through wire transfers that government agents traced to
the Medellin cartel. The Panama branch agreed to pay a $5 million
penalty in a plea bargain in which the U.S. government agreed to
dismiss all charges against the Colombian parent company and release
$72 million in frozen assets in North America and Europe.

   A 3-ton killer whale died before thousands of
horrified spectators in a bloody fight with another whale over the
captive mammals' pecking order during a show at Sea World, officials
said Tuesday.
   Kandu, a 14-year-old whale who gave birth to a calf in the same
tank during a show last year, suffered an upper jaw fracture when
she struck Corky, an 8,000-pound female believed to be about 25, on
Monday, Sea World veterinarians said.
   The fracture triggered a massive hemorrhage into Kandu's nasal
passages, and she bled to death within 45 minutes, said veterinarian
Jim McBain. Spectators saw the whale spouting blood.
   Kandu and Corky were seen circling the 5 million-gallon tank and
gathering speed in the moment before the collision, which occurred
in a holding pen next to the show pool area, witnesses said.
   ``The two adult whales were coming into the show pen when it
seemed like they collided,'' said Jim Barnes of Stansbury Park,
Utah, who was at the show.
   Trainers called Kandu to the pool's side, and her baby,
11-month-old Baby Shamu, followed, said another spectator, Stephanie
Hass.
   ``They gave her that little pat signal, and she rolled over and
the little baby rolled over, too,'' Hass said, ``and the blood came
out and it was all over the sidewalk and everywhere.''
   Corky escaped the collision with minor rake marks from Kandu's
teeth. Baby Shamu and Knootka, a third adult female killer whale at
the park, were not involved in the collision.
   Kandu and Corky had several skirmishes before the fatal episode,
McBain said. He described the behavior as a ritualized combat
initiated by the younger Kandu to assert her dominance.
   ``Kandu was the dominant female,'' McBain said. ``Periodically,
Kandu would assert herself so that Corky knew that Kandu was still
the superior of the two individuals.
   ``What was not part of the normal scenario was the way she
impacted because what ended up happening ... is Kandu did fatal
damage to herself,'' McBain said.
   Kandu ``essentially was battered to death,'' said Brian Gorman, a
Washington, D.C.-based spokesman for the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration. NOAA is the parent agency of the
National Marine Fisheries Service, which is looking into Kandu's
death.
   Gorman said the federal agency received a preliminary report from
Sea World, and had no problems with the park's decision to resume
its popular killer whale shows Tuesday.
   Killer whales and marine mammals in general often fight, ram,
chase and nip each other as part of maintaining a social hierarchy,
said Ken Norris, a professor at the University of California, Santa
Cruz, who has studied whales for 35 years.
   McBain said it was best to maintain some semblance of normalcy
and go on with the shows for the well-being of the park's three
remaining whales. The shows have been scaled down, and trainers are
not being allowed in the water for the time being.
   All three whales ``know something is different,'' McBain said.
The two adults seem to have adjusted to Kandu's loss, but Baby Shamu
took it harder.
   ``The baby was showing a little confusion ... and then acts as if
she's expecting mom to show up at any time,'' McBain said. ``She was
agitated last night but she's much more relaxed now.''

<TEXT>
   A 12-party opposition coalition would
return confiscated land and dismantle much of the army if elected in
February's scheduled balloting, according to a document obtained
Tuesday.
   The opposition platform also envisions maintaining state control
of foreign trade while freeing the domestic market.
   Members of the National Opposition Union, a loose coalition
ranging from communists to conservatives, debated the plan Tuesday
and the Associated Press obtained a copy. The final version was
expected to be released later this week.
   Nicaraguans are scheduled to vote in a general election February
for the first time since the Sandinistas won a civil war and came to
power 10 years ago. The balloting comes under democratic reforms the
leftist regime promised in exchange for U.S.-backed rebels ending
their 7-year-old war against the Sandinistas.
   The opposition is expected to announce its candidates for
president and vice president this week.
   The coalition platform covers a broad political range.
   It states the intent of the coalition's ``Government of National
Salvation'' to protect private property and guarantees workers'
right to unionize, participate in managing enterprises and share
profits.
   At the same time it promises to advance some measures of the
Sandinista programs such as the literacy campaign, while eliminating
the military draft.
   But in trying to please all sides of the coalition the plan
treads on shaky ground.
   One of the strongest cards held by the ruling Sandinista National
Liberation Front is its commitment to giving land to peasants.
   Responding to this, the coalition document says ``to the poor and
middle-income peasants will be guaranteed the legitimate property of
the land they have in their possession.''
   But it also says ``to peasant families who have been
dispossessed, inasmuch as is possible, their farm will be returned,
or they will be compensated with another (farm).''
   ``To the dispossessed of the countryside, they will be given
state land with the right to acquire it for free as their legitimate
property.''
   Since taking power in 1979, and as recently as June, the
Sandinistas have seized land belonging to the late President
Anastasio Somoza and his supporters and to private farmers in
retaliation for political opposition. The Sandinistas led the revolt
that ousted Somoza in July 1979. The Somoza family had ruled
Nicaragua for decades.
   The distribution of land to peasants, although often resulting in
a drop in production, has garnered the Sandinistas popular support.
   The 14-page document says the country would have a military but
mentions several times the intent to restructure and drastically
reduce it ``according to the country's economic capacity and social
needs.''
   With the war between the Sandinistas and rebels, known as
Contras, over, troops on both sides ``should dedicate themselves to
study and production,'' the platform said.
   The Sandinistas army, estimated to have 200,000 members in a
country with a population of 3.5 million, is the largest in Central
America and receives 60 percent of the annual national budget.
   The most likely opposition candidates for president are Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro, whose family owns the opposition newspaper La
Prensa, Enrique Bolanos Geyer, a businessman, and Virgilio Godoy of
the Liberal Independent Party.
   President Daniel Ortega used the opening Tuesday of a new relay
station for the government radio network to appeal to Contras based
in Honduras to demobilize.
   ``You can put down your arms, accept the peace plan,'' Ortega
said. ``You're not going to be put in jail, you're not going to be
put on trial. ... The Nicaraguan people will give you the
opportunity to rejoin society.''
   About 11,000 rebels and 12,000 dependents are in camps in
Honduras. The Sandinista government says 2,500 more are inside
Nicaragua.
   Ortega said the new transmitting station, which relays broadcasts
from Managua, will beam reports to the camps in Honduras.
   He said the station in Esteli, 93 miles north of Managua, was
built with Soviet aid.
   ``The contribution from the Soviet Union is exemplary and should
be (the example) the United States follows in its relations with
Latin American countries and in particular, Nicaragua,'' Ortega said.

   A reputed drug lord facing extradition from
Colombia is among the alleged criminals caught up in ``Operation
Polar Cap,'' which has been described as the biggest
money-laundering probe in U.S. history.
   The multi-agency investigation involved more than two years of
infiltrating and unthreading a tangled web spun from a bogus gold
shipping and smelting scam, tons of drugs, hundreds of millions of
dollars and fast and free-wheeling foreign bank deals.
   Ronald Caffrey, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration's office here, confirmed that Eduardo Martinez
Romero, a 35-year-old Colombian economist and reputed financial
wizard behind the Medellin drug cartel was a Polar Cap suspect. The
cartel is believed to be responsible for most cocaine shipments to
the United States.
   Romero was among thousands arrested in Colombia in recent days in
a crackdown on drug kingpins that followed the assassination Friday
of a presidential candidate and the slayings earlier that week of a
judge and a police official. Romero faces extradition to the United
States.
   Papers filed in federal court in Atlanta say the money-laundering
operation, known by its users as La Mina _ ``the mine'' _ laundered
about $1.2 billion in drug money between 1987 and February 1989.
   Operation Polar Cap investigators uncovered the operation and
found evidence that led to a guilty plea by Banco de Occidente of
Panama to charges it laundered drug money. The plea was entered
earlier this month in U.S. District Court in Atlanta.
   Banco de Occidente of Panama forfeited $5 million to the United
States, Canada and Switzerland. Similar charges against the bank's
parent institution, Banco de Occidente of Cali, Colombia, were
dismissed as a result of the plea.
   A government document filed with the plea said the probe also led
to the arrest of Sergio Hochman and Raul Vivas, who apparently set
up La Mina in mid-1985. Hochman pleaded guilty to money-laundering
charges this spring and named Vivas and others as accomplices.
   La Mina involved the money from the drug sales going to Vivas and
Hochman, who took commissions of up to 12 percent, the government
said.
   The owners of the money provided the two with account numbers in
Panama or Colombia. Hochman then would telephone a firm in Uruguay
and order gold equal to the amount of money from the drug sales,
minus the commission.
   But the gold that was sent actually was lead, covered with enough
gold to pass a ``scratch test'' should one be given.
   The ``gold'' was taken by courier to the United States to
refineries owned by the two or to a New York City financial
operation involved in the money laundering.
   The refinery would certify that the ``gold'' was real and buy it.
The money was wired back to La Mina accounts in Uruguay, then was
wired to a Panama bank or to black-market exchange houses in
Colombia, ending up in the bank accounts of drug traffickers.
   Polar Cap investigators infiltrated the money-laundering network
by offering an Atlanta money-laundering service.
   The U.S. attorney's office in Atlanta called Polar Cap ``the
largest narcotic money-laundering investigation ever conducted by
U.S. law enforcement agencies.''
   It involved hundreds of agents and cooperation from Canada, Great
Britain, the Caribbean island of Montserrat, Switzerland and West
Germany, and has resulted in charges against 127 people and two
foreign banks.

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 62-year-old woman who was put on 10 years
probation for killing her husband spoke Tuesday of years of broken
bones and bruises she suffered at his hands.
   A ruptured eardrum, a separated shoulder and a broken leg were
part of the pain during their 12-year marriage, Marianne Biesenbach
said. On a hellish day in March 1988, her husband Max threatened to
slice her throat with a butcher knife. Given his violent nature, Ms.
Biesenbach believed him.
   She ended the nightmare by fatally shooting him in the driveway
of their home on March 5, 1988. It was something she had tried to do
at least twice.
   A state district judge in San Antonio on Monday ordered Ms.
Biesenbach to serve 10 years probation after she pleaded no contest
to involuntary manslaughter. The plea was negotiated by defense
attorney Richard ``Racehorse'' Haynes.
   ``Today, I don't feel guilty anymore. I feel I did what I had to
do to stay alive,'' Ms. Biesenbach said Tuesday in a telephone
interview from her home in Kerrville, 70 miles northwest of San
Antonio.
   ``I gave up. I didn't care. That's why I wouldn't accept even the
word `voluntary manslaughter.' I didn't plan that. I don't know how
I did it. It was through primitive brain _ self preservation,'' said
Ms. Biesenbach, who has four children and seven grandchildren.
   Max Biesenbach, 59, had threatened her as they drove home from
dinner, she said. She had hidden a .357-caliber Magnum revolver in
their van, where she slept occasionally to escape his rage, she said.
   Before he could hurt her again, Ms. Biesenbach shot him three
times in the chest.
   The killing followed years of abuse from a husband she described
as a ``Jekyll-and-Hyde drinker.''
   When he was sober, she said, he was as kind as Santa Claus,
taking his grandson fishing. Then he would turn violent in private,
often after drinking heavily.
   ``It's indescribable, the hell that you live in,'' she said.
``You forget that there's another world out there with sunshine and
love.''
   Ms. Biesenbach tried to divorce her husband three times and went
through with it once after he broke her leg, she said. But he always
returned.
   At the time of the killing, they were married under common law.
   Haynes said a trial, which could have lasted two weeks, would
have been hard on Ms. Biesenbach.
   ``She would have had to relive that nightmare that was her
existence with Mr. Biesenbach,'' Haynes said.
   However, he said he believes a jury would have acquitted her and
that recent publicity about battered women would have helped her.
   ``I think all the national publicity has caused us to focus on it
as something that for too long was kept behind closed doors,'' he
said.
   State District Judge Pat Priest accepted Haynes' request that Ms.
Biesenbach receive deferred adjudication, meaning that if probation
requirements are met, there will be no record of guilt.

   Huey P. Newton was shot to death Tuesday
in the same troubled neighborhood where he co-founded the militant
Black Panther Party 23 years ago to protect blacks from police
violence. He was 47.
   Newton was found lying in a pool of blood in a rundown section of
Oakland where residents fear they are losing the war against drug
dealing and poverty.
   Newton, along with Bobby Seale, founded the Black Panthers to
protect black neighborhoods against what they perceived as a pattern
of police violence against blacks.
   The group was itself frequently associated with violence,
although it also helped organize daycare centers, free breakfast
programs, health clinics and a school in Oakland.
   Newton, the party's minister of defense, was recalled as ``a
person who rebelled against the status quo in all forms'' by Chicago
Alderman Bobby Rush, who once headed the Panther's Chicago chapter.
   ``The Huey that I remember was a student of the world and ...
made a contribution to the advancement of the ideals of freedom,
justice and equality for all Americans.'' Rush said.
   ``I would like Huey P. Newton to be remembered as a guy who took
civil disobedience and put it on the cutting edge where heightened
contradictions would come to light,'' Seale, now a community liaison
with Temple University's African-American studies program.
   ``Huey Newton and the Black Panther party were romantic symbols
in the civil rights movement. Their operational style was
provocative and dramatic,'' Roy Innis, chairman of the New
York-based Congress of Racial Equality, or CORE.
   Newton was shot several times, including at least once in the
head, according to Officer Terry Foley. The shooting was reported to
police at 5:29 a.m., and Newton was pronounced dead at Highland
Hospital at 6:12 a.m., said Sgt. Dan Mercado.
   Investigators swarmed the crime scene early Tuesday but declined
to describe details of the shooting.
   At a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Lt. Mike Sims said there
were no supects and no apparent motive in the slaying.
   ``At this point, there's no evidence to indicate that it was
drug-related,'' said Sims, adding that Newton was found on his back.
   Audrey DePalm, 29, who lives across the street from the site of
the shooting, said she heard one shot about 5:15 a.m., followed
seconds later by three more shots.
   Shooting is not uncommon in the neighborhood, Ms. DePalm said,
but usually it is followed by yelling, screeching tires or other
signs of a dispute. This time, she said, there was silence.
   Longtime residents recalled that Newton began his work with the
Black Panthers in the same neighborhood, working with local churches
to serve free breakfasts to youngsters.
   Newton and Seale founded the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense
when a new militancy was taking hold among black youths impatient
with the slow progress of the civil rights movement.
   Influenced by Malcolm X, Newton and Seale helped define the Black
Power movement with their strident criticisms of police and the
political establishment. They epitomized a new image for black
youth, with their Afro haircuts, black leather jackets, black
berets, pressed shirts, law books _ and guns.
   The Panthers frequently clashed with police. Newton, like other
Panther leaders, accumulated a long criminal record, and was tried
five times in two slayings.
   Huey Percy Newton was born in Louisiana in 1942, the youngest of
seven children. His father, a New Orleans minister, moved the family
to Oakland a year later and took a job with the city Streets
Department.
   Newton attended several public schools in his early years and
said he became aware early of white teacher prejudice against black
students. Because black students often were in the slow-reading
group, he said in a 1968 interview, ``blacks concluded that the
whites were smart and they were dumb.''
   ``To compensate for this lack of ability we saw in ourselves, we
would say that whites were smarter but we were stronger,'' he said.
``We didn't understand that the white boys had gotten a head start
from their families because many of them were middle-class, and
through the experience of hearing their families exchange ideas over
the dinner table they learned to cope with ideas. We, the blacks,
didn't have this advantage.''
   The black students, he said, learned to deal with white
authorities by fighting them or outmanipulating them or skirting
their rules, and that led to bitter confrontations with the police.
   He was convicted of manslaughter for the shooting death of an
Oakland policeman on Oct. 28, 1967, and was sentenced to two to 15
years. But that conviction was overturned on appeal after he served
two years in prison. The charge was dropped after two retrials ended
in hung juries.
   Newton's trial in the 1974 shooting death of a 17-year-old
Oakland prostitute also ended in a hung jury. A retrial ended in a
hung jury.
   Newton, convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in 1964, was
convicted of being a felon in possession of weapons after a 1974
incident in which he allegedly pistol-whipped his tailor and police
found two guns in his apartment.
   He then fled the country and lived for three years in Cuba. He
was acquitted of a charge of assault in connection with the incident.

   Tom Orloff, deputy district attorney for Alameda County who
prosecuted Newton in the 1974 case, called him ``a man who lived by
violence and outside the law'' and ``nothing but a gangster.''
   But others saw a different person.
   ``To us, Huey Newton was a hero,'' said Audrey DePalm's brother,
Fred, who was awakened by the gunshots Tuesday morning. ``The Black
Panthers were a thing to identify with, along with Malcolm X and
Martin Luther King.''
   Charles Garry, Newton's lawyer for many years, hailed him as the
founder of ``the renaissance of the black liberation movement.''
   Garry said he never saw a violent side of Newton.
   ``I saw a very sweet side, a humane side a dignified side, a man
who was theoretically in favor of a better world.''
   Garry said Newton became paranoid and his personality changed
years ago when he was targeted by the FBI, whose agents tried to
infiltrate and disrupt the Black Panthers through an operation known
as COINTELPRO. The counterintelligence program, set up to destroy
civil rights organizations, has been credited with _ or blamed for _
helping destroy the Black Panthers.
   When Newton received a doctor of philosophy degree at age 38 from
the University of California at Santa Cruz, his dissertation was
titled: ``War against the Panthers, a study of repression in
America.''
   The Black Panthers eventually broke apart amid infighting,
arrests, deaths, imprisonments and differing philosophies,
especially between Newton and Eldridge Cleaver, the one-time Panther
information minister and author of ``Soul on Ice,'' who underwent a
startling transformation into a born-again Christian and Republican.
   Earlier this year, Newton drew six months in jail after pleading
no contest to misappropriating $15,000 in public money earmarked for
a school the Panthers ran in the early 1980s. He was already in jail
at the time for parole violation.
   In 1969, Panthers Mark Clark and Fred Hampton were killed in a
pre-dawn police raid at their Chicago headquarters. Police had
ostenstibly been searching for weapons.
   Clark and Hampton's relatives, and other survivors of the raid,
successfully sued city, state and federal officials and were awarded
$1.85 million in 1983.
   At one point, in 1977, the Panthers flirted with conventionality
when Newton and other Panther leaders accepted a resolution from two
state assemblymen commending the Panthers for their Oakland
Community School.
   The visit, which included an escorted tour of the state Capitol
with 10 of the children, took place a decade after about 40 Black
Panthers marched through the Capitol on May 2, 1967, carrying loaded
rifles, pistols and shotguns to protest a bill restricting the
carrying of arms in public. The Panthers left the Capitol peacefully
after guards confiscated the weapons, unloaded them and returned
them.
   Twenty-four Panthers had been arrested that day on conspiracy
charges, although no shots were fired and there were no injuries.
Most charges were later dropped.
   Newton didn't participate in the incident, but appeared at the
arraignment, saying there was a ``conspiracy against the black
world. ... We will not tolerate any more of this action. We'll let
the consequences speak for themselves.''
   During the more peaceful 1977 Capitol tour, Newton told
reporters: ``Our basic goals and our basic ambitions have not
changed. There has been some change in tactics.''
   ``There are changes in the United States, changes in awareness,
but not in structure. ... We have always been dedicated to
progressive change, and we're glad that other people are joining
us.''

   The cry was ``Get your red hots, comrade'' on
Tuesday as the head of a fast food chain served up samples of the
hot dogs his company plans to begin selling this fall in the heart
of Red Square.
   For less than 1{ rubles _ about $2.25 _ a Nathan's Famous stand
in Moscow's GUM department store will sell hot dogs flown in from
the United States and served on a Russian-made bun.
   ``Nathan's hot dogs have been hailed as a most succulent slice of
American democracy since they were first served in 1916 at Coney
Island, and we are confident that Muscovite shoppers and tourists
will feel that same sensation,'' chairman Stuart A. Benson said.
   ``They'll be able for the first time to have at a reasonable
price, quality food,'' Benson said at a news conference at a
Nathan's Famous on Broadway, where he served free hot dogs to
Soviets at the announcement and passers-by.
   Sergei A. Goryachev, mayor of the Lenin District of Moscow,
credited perestroika _ Mikhail Gorbachev's drive to restructure the
Soviet economy _ with bringing American fast food to the Soviet
Union.
   Soviet and Nathan's officials said the hot dog stand, which they
hope to open by October, would be the first of its kind in the
country. Pizza Hut and McDonald's also have plans to open outlets in
the Soviet Union, the officials said.
   ``What people will get is a different experience,'' Goryachev
said through a translator. ``If they want to eat quickly they can
eat quickly. If they don't want to eat quickly they can go to a
restaurant. Anything that they want they can have.''
   Nikolai Vladimirov, who heads the Food Trust overseeing eateries
in the Lenin District, said Soviets have a sausage similar to a hot
dog, but it is breaded and fried.
   While probably not what Vladimir I. Lenin had in mind for his
country when he led the Communist revolution of 1917, the joint
venture would be good for both sides, Goryachev said.
   ``The main thing is that Americans and Russians are working
together, eating together, and they will become friends,'' he said.
   And some of the capitalistic values of their new American friends
apparently has already rubbed off.
   ``We wish you from our delegation a good spirit and to help
people and to serve the people,'' Goryachev said in a toast. ``And
most importantly, to have a profit.''

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
said Tuesday the opposition made ``an historic error'' when it
refused what he said was an offer to share in the government
starting Sept. 1.
   Talks between the Noriega-controlled government and the
opposition to resolve the country's political stalemate ended Monday
with no solution in sight.
   The opposition refused an offer to form a joint government to
rule after the current administration's term ends Sept. 1.
   And the government rejected the opposition demands that it
recognize the opposition's claim that it won the May 7 elections and
that Noriega step down as commander of the Defense Forces.
   ``More than was given cannot be given,'' Noriega said. ``They
have committed an historic error. We offered half the government and
they with the great economic capacity and with the support of the
United States could have seized all the government. It was an error
of idiots who were programmed to say no to everything.''
   Noriega spoke after a military ceremony commemorating the return
of the Rio Hato military base to Panama by the United States in 1970.
   Both sides said they would await Wednesday's Organization of
American States meeting in Washington before deciding what action to
take. The OAS arranged and mediated the talks, which have been held
sporadically since mid-July.
   ``I insist, they were offered everything, absolutely everything,
in an operation of goodwill on the part of the negotiators,''
Noriega said.
   He said Romulo Escobar, a government representative to the talks
``offered more than he was authorized to offer, and that would have
been a big problem for Romulo.''
   Asked what Escobar had offered, he said ``he was handing over
half of all the government.''
   International observers said opposition presidential candidate
Guillermo Endara was ahead 3-1 in the May balloting when Noriega had
the election annulled.
   The opposition wants to take office Sept. 1 when the terms of
Acting President Manuel Solis Palma and the legislative assembly
expire.
   Endara said Monday the opposition did not agree to govern jointly
because ``we are not going after power. They are offering part of
the power. We are going after democracy, justice and freedom.''
   The United States has been using economic and diplomatic pressure
to try to force Noriega to step down since he was indicted on
federal narcotics trafficking charges in Florida in February 1988.
   Noriega denies the charges and says the United States wants to
avoid giving Panama full control of the Panama Canal at the end of
1999 as specified in 1977 treaties.
   ``It is an insult that foreign countries, that some foreign
leaders, want to dictate to us what we have to do,'' Noriega said
Tuesday. ``That is humiliating. We are not a tribe. We know what we
have to do.''
   ``Here what we want is respect, nothing more,'' he said.

<HEAD>U.S. Checking into Problem of Contaminated Export Grain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Early detection of aflatoxin, a cancer-causing
substance, prompted cancellation of some recent shipments of
American corn to Japan, Saudi Arabia and Spain and a U.S. inspector
has gone to India to check complaints of contaminated corn there, an
Agriculture Department official said Tuesday.
   The grain sent to India under an American aid program in June was
also inspected before leaving the United States and all samples
tested free of aflatoxin contamination and fit for human
consumption, said Steve Tanner of the department's Federal Grain
Inspection Service.
   After delivery, the Indian Grain Cooperative Marketing Federation
complained of aflatoxin contamination to Lyle Sabranek, agricultural
counselor of the American Embassy in New Delhi, the Indian Embassy
in Washington said.
   The embassy had no additional details but Tanner said the U.S.
inspector and other concerned American and Indian officials are
thoroughly investigating the matter in India.
   The report from India prompted the Agriculture Department to
recheck its samples of the shipment, confirming that the corn was
uncontaminated at the time it left Seattle, Tanner said.
   Aflatoxin is a potent carcinogen produced by a fungus during hot
and dry weather that theoretically could materialize during
shipment. The poison appeared in Middle Western U.S. States during
the 1988 drought and again this year in Texas.
   The Wall Street Journal said Tuesday the appearance of aflatoxin
in India could be an ``example of poisoned corn leaking through''
the inspection system or ``a case of the fungus producing aflatoxin
after the grain had left U.S. ports.''
   The Journal said it obtained incomplete records showing that more
than 24 million bushels (more than 600,000 metric tons) of U.S. corn
exports, amounting to 24 shiploads, contained some contamination
between October and April in what the newspaper described as a lax
and imperfect inspection program.
   While confirming that intended destinations included Japan, Saudi
Arabia and Spain, Tanner said he had no additional information and
asserted that the government would not knowingly permit shipment of
contaminated grain cargo.
   He said reports from India left many questions unanswered, such
as how much of the almost 4 million bushels (100,000 metric tons) of
corn loaded for India arrived contaminated and what detection
techniques were being used.

   Sometimes, history is less than great
events and memorable dates. Sometimes, it's coverlets and plows,
soda bottles and signs.
   Sometimes, the commonplace is evidence of the past.
   ``A `colored-only' sign makes a beautiful piece of history,''
said Alferdteen Harrison, director of the Margaret Walker Alexander
Research Center at Jackson State University.
   ``Put the sign up and it immediately communicates an era, a
place,'' she said recently. ``See it now, it's completely out of
character.''
   Harrison has used other less painful relics to depict black life
in Mississippi during the segregation era. Her work was the basis
for ``Those That Stayed Home During the Great Migration
1915-Present,'' a companion exhibit to the traveling version of the
Smithsonian Institution's ``Field To Factory: Afro-American
Migration 1915-1940.''
   The exhibits opened Sunday at the Smith Robertson Museum and
Cultural Center in Jackson. Smith Robertson and Jackson State are
co-sponsoring the exhibits.
   Other activities associated with the exhibits include a national
symposium on the ``Great Migration,'' Sept. 14-15 at Jackson State.
   While ``Field to Factory'' examines the forces that led 600,000
black Mississippians to move North, ``Those That Stayed Home'' looks
at the lives of blacks who remained in the South.
   Both presentations tell their stories through ordinary objects
essential to daily life.
   ``In my mind, it's three-dimensional objects that are remnants of
people's lives that come before us,'' said Spencer Crew, curator of
the Smithsonian exhibit. ``It's our way of beginning to see, feel
and study that aspect of their lives.''
   Over the years, the most pedestrian items have turned into
historical treasures.
   ``The hardest thing to find was a broom that a factory janitor
would use,'' Crew said, explaining that the broom illustrated the
change in tools as workers went from planting crops to punching
clocks.
   Harrison, however, said she had no difficulty finding artifacts.
Donations of items have flowed in since Smith Robertson mounted its
first exhibit in the early 1980s.
   ``The museum caught on,'' she said. ``If people had kept up the
effort, we wouldn't have a place to put stuff.''
   One benefactor gave the entire contents of a country store,
including a glass display case, empty bottles of Vernor's Ginger
Ale, Mason's Root Beer, and Orangette Lemonade, and a full bottle of
666 Tonic.
   Those bottles ``carry the essence of culture,'' Harrison said.
   ``Culture is the way people live from day to day. It's made up of
technology, instututions, art and language.''

   USAir said Tuesday it asked federal officials
for details of charges that its pilots have been annoying air
traffic controllers in an apparent protest over the pace of contract
talks with the carrier.
   The Federal Aviation Administration reported the trouble in a
letter from Peter Bernhard, air traffic manager at Greater
Pittsburgh International Airport, to USAir pilots.
   ``I have never been so concerned about our working relationship
with professional aviators as I am now,'' Bernhard wrote.
   The trouble apparently began Aug. 5, the day USAir merged with
Piedmont Airlines. USAir's 6,000 pilots have been working under an
extension of their old contract for the last year.
   Bernhard said USAir jets have taxied at unusually slow speeds and
pilots have blocked or slowed communications with the tower.
   Pilots also have insisted on using bad weather landing procedures
in good weather, requiring controllers to space planes farther
apart, and they have reduced airspeed without first notifying the
tower, he said.
   Bernhard said his Aug. 10 letter ``was an appeal to their
professionalism. My controllers are frustrated.''
   The job actions were not a threat to safety, Bernhard said,
because ``there are not enough pilots participating. If it was more
widespread we'd be concerned about safety. Right now it's more of an
annoyance to controllers.''
   USAir spokesman John Bronson in Pittsburgh said the airline's
flight records show no evidence of concerted action by pilots. He
said Joseph McLaughlin, USAir's vice president of flying, asked the
FAA to provide the airline with details that might help identify
pilots.
   McLaughlin told the FAA he was shocked and dismayed by the
reports.
   ``While I understand some of our pilots are unhappy with the
progress of our current contract negotiations, I fully expect them
to continue to conduct themselves in the professional manner that
you have long grown accustomed to,'' he said in a letter.
   John Mazor, spokesman for the Airline Pilots Association, said he
was unaware of any slowdown order for members at USAir.
   USAir was fined $2,000 last month after its pilots were caught
deliberately jamming conversations between the Philadelphia tower
and Eastern Airlines pilots. The pilots' union is striking Eastern.

   White House officials appeared to
close the door on any possibility of sending troops to help Colombia
fight drug traffickers Tuesday as the South American nation moved to
extradite one man who faces drug charges in the United States.
   Asked for a second day about reports that the administration was
considering sending military help to Colombia, White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said simply, ``It's not going to happen.''
   President Bush, vacationing at his seaside resort home,
telephoned Colombian President Virgilio Barco on Monday night to
express condolences on the assassination of presidential candidate
Luis Carlos Galan, reported to have been gunned down by drug
traffickers.
   In that conversation Barco specifically said he did not want U.S.
troops to get involved, according to Fitzwater.
   The Bush-Barco conversation and further statements from White
House officials on Tuesday squelched earlier suggestions from Bush
himself and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh that the United States
might be considering military troops as an option if Colombia
requested such aid.
   Barco has made no such request, nor did he seek non-military aid
to deal withhis country's heightening drug-related crisis, said
White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen.
   She said the Justice Department was working on the extradition
matter, following Barco's action easing procedures that have impeded
extraditions to the United States since 1988.
   In Washington, the Justice Department named the ``Dozen Most
Wanted'' alleged Colombian drug traffickers that it would like to
extradite, including the leadership of the Medellin and Cali cocaine
cartels. The list did not include an alleged major money-launderer,
Eduardo Martinez Romero.
   Colombian authorities said they had arrested Martinez, who is
under indictment in the United States where he is suspected of being
a financial chief of the Medellin drug cartel. Colombian national
police said they started proceedings Tuesday to extradite him.
   Ms. Glen said the United States will continue its current support
to Colombia, including U.S.-made helicopters, Drug Enforcement
Agency agents to work with Colombian officials, and Defense
Department advisers to the Colombian military.
   She denied reports the United States is sending a special team of
security experts to Colombia, saying, ``We're not aware of any team
going there.''
   Officials who spoke on condition of anonymity had said the
administration was preparing to send security experts to advise
judges, magistrates and journalists _ groups who have been targets
of drug gangs _ on how to improve security. A $5 million program
along those lines was approved by Congress over a year ago.
   The developments on the international drug scene came as Bush was
getting word from a new poll that Americans approve of his handling
of anti-drug efforts even before the official announcement next
month of the administration's anti-drug strategy.
   The ABC News-Washington Post poll said respondents in a sample of
1,509 people questioned by telephone Aug. 17 to Aug. 21 approved of
Bush's anti-drug efforts, 54 percent to 40 percent. The poll said it
had a likely margin of error of three percentage points either way.
   Bush, on an extended vacation with family members, continued his
holiday pattern of jogging, tennis and boating.
   His wife Barbara, however, returned to Washington for an eye
examination due to continuing eye irritation stemming from Graves
disease, a thyroid imbalance.
   Doctors at Walter Reed Army Hospital switched her medication from
cortisone to prednisone because her eye symptoms had not improved.
They said her thyroid problem was under control.
   The president told reporters who jogged with him that his wife's
eyes had been bothering her again, although she felt fine otherwise.
   Aides said she suffered double vision, despite treatment earlier
this year with radioactive iodine.
   In late morning, Bush piloted his speedboat Fidelity, filled with
several of his children and grandchildren, close to the shore by the
hotel that houses the traveling press working area.
   He stopped and called across the water to a small group that
gathered on the rocky shore, chatting about the beautiful weather
and his plans to spend most of the day on the water.
   He had his fishing gear with him.
   When he said the water temperature was nice, reporters asked if
he wanted to repeat his impromptu leap into the sea that he
performed Saturday on a dare from his children. The president
declined.

<HEAD>`Privates on Parade,' A Play by Peter Nichols, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>

   War is hell, but peace isn't any easier,
particularly if you're a member of a British army entertainment unit
presenting a tacky ``Jungle Jamboree'' to the troops in Malaya in
1948.
   Out of such show biz misery comes ``Privates on Parade,'' Peter
Nichols' quasi-autobiographical remembrances of British imperialism
in decline after World War II.
   The play with music, which opened Tuesday at off-Broadway's
Roundabout Theater, is a gloriously funny evening of caustic social
and political commentary interspersed with hilarious song and dance.
   And ``Privates on Parade'' works on both levels. Nichols tweaks
the nose of the British establishment, personified in the play by
Maj. Giles Flack, who won't let anything _ not even the theater _
interfere with God and country.
   Flack, played by the unflappable and marvelously comic Simon
Jones, stands in contrast to his charges, members of SADUSEA, Song
and Dance Unit South East Asia. They may have been drafted
unwillingly into show business but once on stage, can't get it out
of their blood.
   The play chronicles the adventures of this ragtag bunch of
performers, particularly the young and impressionable Pvt. Steven
Flowers, played with just the right amount of innocence and earnest
righteousness by Jim Fyfe.
   It's Flowers' introduction, indoctrination and assimilation into
the troupe that takes up much of the action in ``Privates on
Parade.'' The performers are led by Acting Capt. Terri Dennis, a
flamboyant, frustrated musical comedy star, played on the edge of
manic outrageousness by Jim Dale.
   Dale is a music hall marvel. He has a rapport not only with the
other performers but with the audience as well. It's Dale who gets
most of the musical turns, decimating in drag such campy icons as
Marlene Dietrich, Carmen Miranda, and Vera Lynn. He also does a
devastating turn as Noel Coward wondering why things have turned out
so rotten even though the Allies won the war.
   Nichols' lyrics, when they can be heard in the Roundabout's
sound-deadening auditorium, are witty. The music by Denis King
affectionately echoes the old songs he is spoofing. And there's one
little rouser, a catchy title tune that begins as a march and ends
in a high-kicking chorus line fashioned by choreographer Daniel
Pelzig.
   The play's nearly two dozen scenes blend fluidly into each other.
Director Larry Carpenter uses a front cloth, much like a curtain in
old vaudeville theaters, to separate scenes as well as the musical
numbers from the dramatic action.
   Nichols, author of ``Joe Egg,'' another fine Roundabout
production, has been generous to the other actors in the play. Each
gets a chance to shine, particularly John Curry, as the troupe's one
decent member who understands what the British have done wrong in
Malaya, Ross Bickell as a foul-mouthed corporal, Edward Hibbert as
the world's most inept magician and Donna Murphy, the company's sole
female and love interest for young Flowers.
   For all its comedy, ``Privates on Parade'' has a serious _ and
violent _side. Nichols doesn't let the audience forget the
consequences of British rule, not only for the ruled but for the
rulers themselves.
   The play was first done in London in 1977 and had its American
premiere at the Long Wharf Theater in Connecticut four years ago.
Why it has taken so long to get to New York is anybody's guess. Just
be grateful that ``Privates on Parade'' has finally arrived.

   The Voyager 2 spacecraft found at least
one complete ring of debris orbiting Neptune, surprising scientists
who discovered it while trying to relocate a partial ring dubbed the
``lost arc,'' NASA said Tuesday.
   Two partial rings _ called ring arcs _ appeared in pictures
Voyager made Aug. 11 as it approached the solar system's fourth
largest planet, but the arc that orbits 17,000 miles above Neptune's
cloudtops couldn't be found in subsequent images, prompting
researchers to dub it the lost arc or ``ghost arc.''
   When scientists rediscovered it in a series of 16 photographs
sent back Tuesday, ``It seemed reasonable that this was indeed the
lost arc our imaging team raiders were looking for,'' team leader
Bradford Smith said.
   ``But instead of being an arc, it turns out to be a complete
circle, a complete ring. ... It goes all the way around _ Neptune's
first complete ring,'' Smith said during a news conference at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   The new photos also show the second and larger arc, which orbits
23,300 miles above Neptune's cloudtops, extends farther around
Neptune than previously believed, suggesting that it also may be a
complete ring, but with ``regions of greater and lesser amounts of
material in it,'' Smith said.
   He said the answer may not come until Neptune's ring system is
photographed while backlighted by distant sunlight. That will happen
after Voyager makes its closest approach to Neptune by passing 3,000
miles over the planet's north pole cloudtops at 8:55 p.m. PDT
Thursday.
   Voyager already has discovered four Neptunian moons in addition
to Nereid and backward-orbiting Triton, which were discovered from
Earth.
   Asked if Voyager has found more moons, Smith replied: ``Suspects
have been seen here and there. ... I would expect several more
satellites (moons).''
   By 9 a.m. PDT Wednesday, Voyager will be 2.747 billion miles from
Earth and 1.386 million miles from Neptune, speeding toward the
giant planet at 37,855 mph. The spacecraft has traveled a curving
4.4-billion-mile path since it was launched in 1977.
   Voyager's activity list Tuesday included taking 39 more photos to
look for ring arcs or rings, six photos of the recently discovered
moon 1989 N1; 22 images of Triton and 66 pictures of Neptune's
surprisingly active weather patterns, which include a variety of
clouds, 400-mph winds and an Earth-sized cyclone called the Great
Dark Spot.
   The spaceship also was programmed to make 73 ultraviolet images
of the planet, some of them to look for southern and northern
lights, or auroras, created as electrons are sucked toward Neptune's
poles along magnetic field lines.
   Voyager also used a light sensor Tuesday to look for variations
in Triton's surface brightness, providing clues to the moon's
structure and makeup. The moon's polar icecaps may extend to the
equator during winter at each pole, Stone said. Smith said the moon
may have snowstorms of frozen methane, or natural gas, at times.
   Stone said Voyager's infrared sensor was measuring heat patterns
near Neptune's poles in an attempt to understand the planet's
turbulent weather.
   The discovery of at least one complete ring around Neptune was
surprising. Stone said two months ago that the planet might be
orbited by 50 to 100 partial rings of debris.
   He backed away from that prediction Tuesday, saying it was based
on the possibility that the gravitational pull of some
still-undiscovered moon, inclined out of the planet's equatorial
plane, might ``shepherd'' dozens of rings arcs.
   Instead, it looks like two of the moons discovered by Voyager
might be shepherds for the complete ring and ring arc. Both moons
orbit the planet's equator.
   Scientists had said ring arcs could be the remnants of moons torn
apart by gravitational forces or collisions. Smith said it isn't yet
known if the ring material seen so far consists of boulder-, pebble-
or dust-sized debris.

   A giant elevator on the USS John F.
Kennedy ruptured a hydraulic line during an open house Tuesday,
spraying oily fluid on visitors and sparking a panic that caused
dozens of injuries.
   The rupture caused the elevator, one of four on the aircraft
carrier capable of hoisting bomb-laden jets, to come to an immediate
stop, Navy Cmdr. Shawn Etter, a ship's officer, said.
   The jolt and spray of hydraulic fluid caused riders to panic and
stampede off the platform, he said.
   ``Panic seems to have been what caused most of the problems and
injuries,'' Etter said. He added that he had never before seen such
a hydraulic problem with the elevator, which is designed to carry up
to 120,000 pounds.
   There were an estimated 60 people on the elevator platform and
about 30 suffered some kind of injury, said Dominic Lanza, district
supervisor of Broward County's emergency medical services.
   Two people were admitted to Broward General Medical Center.
Dorothy Klaer, 61, of Fort Lauderdale, complained of chest pains,
and Francis Harrington, 61, of Margate, had a possible stroke. Both
were listed in fair condition Tuesday night, said hospital spokesman
Craig Biles.
   The rest of the injured were treated for minor bumps and bruises,
and had hydraulic fluid flushed from their eyes in the ship's
infirmary, Lanza said.
   ``It happened so quickly _ one minute we were riding the elevator
and the next it was a stampede,'' said Tom Boehm of Fort Lauderdale.
   ``All of a sudden we heard this loud hissing noise and people
started running and pushing to get away from it,'' said Karen Nitsch
of Fort Lauderdale. ``I didn't see anyone seriously injured, but we
were all scared to death.''
   The Navy quickly canceled the day's tours on the ship and
evacuated all civilians on board. Officers didn't say immediately
whether the planned two-day open house would resume Wednesday.
   The ship, which is the length of 3{ football fields and carries a
crew of about 3,000 sailors, docked Monday at Port Everglades near
Fort Lauderdale. The JFK is the world's largest steam-powered
aircraft carrier.

<HEAD>Largest U.S. Fraternity Eliminates Pledging; Second in a Week</HEAD>

   Tau Kappa Epsilon, the nation's largest
college social fraternity, announced Tuesday that it had ended
pledging in an effort to stop dangerous hazing, making it the second
fraternity in a week to do so.
   ``Hazing has long been a problem in the fraternity system,'' said
T.J. Schmitz, the fraternity's executive vice president. ``We have
tried numerous programs to eradicate it from the fraternity, but so
far none have accomplished the task.''
   Legislation banning pledging was passed by undergraduate
delegates from the fraternity's more than 280 chapters during the
45th national convention here last weekend.
   Instead of a pledge period, new TKE recruits will be initiated
immediately. TKE has more than 177,000 initiated members and 16,000
active undergraduate members.
   Last week, Zeta Beta Tau announced that it was eliminating the
traditional pledge period.
   Pledging evolved in the late 19th century and was meant to be a
rite of passage for new recruits before their initiation as full
members. It has come under fire recently after scattered deaths of
freshmen pledges in initiation rites that have included heavy
drinking and humiliation.
   Eileen Stevens, founder of the New York-based Committee to Halt
Useless College Killings, spoke to delegates during the convention
and urged them to ban pledging.
   ``More than 50 students have died from hazing incidents during
the last 10 years. Whenever you have a two-tiered system where there
are members and pledges, the opportunity for hazing exists,'' said
Stevens, whose son died in a hazing incident.

   Nine children lived as virtual prisoners in a
dark, filthy apartment where they were sexually or physically
assaulted by their parents, authorities said Tuesday. There may have
been three other children who did not survive their first month and
were secretly buried.
   ``There were 11 people living in a darkened apartment with little
access to the outside world. They only knew this way of life. They
were not born in a hospital, they were born in the apartment,'' said
Deputy Chief Joseph DeMartino.
   It appeared that the eldest girl, 14, was the only one who had
ever gone to school, he said.
   Herman and Frances McMillan, 42 and 34 respectively, were
arrested Monday after three months of delicate questioning of the
children disclosed a pattern of rape, sodomy and beatings in three
gloomy rooms from which the six boys and three girls never emerged.
   The children were taken from their parents three months ago.
   ``The oldest children suffered most from the sexual abuse and the
younger children from physical abuse,'' DeMartino said.
   Police dug up a slope where McMillan told police he had buried
two infants. No bodies were found Tuesday.
   Police said they believed those two children were born within the
last 3{ years and died at less than a month of age, but whether of
violence, disease or neglect was not known.
   ``We have no reason at this point to believe they were killed by
the parents,'' said DeMartino. ``They disposed of the bodies.''
   The last of the missing children may have been stillborn,
DeMartino said. Police and city welfare officials went to the
McMillan's one-bedroom apartment in the New York City borough of The
Bronx on May 25 in response to neighbors' complaints that the
children were being neglected.
   ``When the people went into the apartment, they found it to be
extremely dark,'' DeMartino said. ``No electricity, filthy, strewn
with dirty clothing and newspapers. ... Windows covered with dirty
rags and sheets and the children appeared frightened and dirty.''
   Welfare officials immediately took the children _ boys of 16, 12,
10, 5 and 2 years and a 4-month-old, and girls of 14, 8 and 6 years.
   Detectives returned for the parents Monday. They arrested the
father on two counts of rape, four of sodomy, 13 of felonious
assault, two of incest, two of reckless endangerment, nine of
endangering the welfare of a minor and one of sexual abuse. The
mother was charged with two assaults and nine endangerings.
   ``We don't have any information that they were hyperreligious,
cultish,'' said DeMartino. ``He was protective of his family. He
believed his way of life was best, that he knew best how to educate
his children ...
   ``They were recluses. The husband would come and go occasionally.
The wife remained in the apartment. The children remained in the
apartment. They did little or nothing,'' he said.
   DeMartino said that although the building was a known drug
location, there was no evidence of narcotics in the apartment.
   Neighbors said McMillan never spoke and ignored greetings as he
came and went in the building.
   The children were heard but rarely seen. A man next door said
that if any of the children looked out the kitchen window, McMillan
``would grab them back and used to hit the kids and beat them.''
   McMillan, originally from North Carolina, did occasional work as
a laborer and received $554 a month from Social Security, the chief
said. His wife came from Connecticut. It was not known how long they
have lived in the city.

   Police said they arrested five suspects
Tuesday night in the assassination of leading presidential candidate
Luis Carlos Galan at a campaign rally. Authorities have blamed
cocaine traffickers for his death.
   The five were presented to local reporters at national police
headquarters and shown on television. They were dressed in casual,
well-worn clothing.
   All five are Colombians, police said, and identified them as
Armando Bernal Acosta, Norberto Morillo Charalca, Pedro Zembrano
Delgado, Luis Gonzalez Chacon and Jubis Hazvumb.
   Police said the five men were arrested at a downtown apartment.
No other details were given.
   Police also announced that proceedings began Tuesday to extradite
a purported manager of drug money to the United States, where he
faces conspiracy charges involving a billion-dollar money-laundering
scheme.
   Authorities reported more raids and seizures on the fourth day of
their nationwide crackdown on the drug underworld. The country's
judges planned to return to their duties, ending a strike called
after a judge and police official were killed Thursday.
   The extradition of Eduardo Martinez Romero, said to manage funds
for the notorious Medellin cartel, was seen as a test of a
government pledge to hand over cocaine traffickers wanted in the
United States. The powerful cocaine cartels have cowed the courts in
the past through a systematic campaign of terror.
   Martinez escaped arrest last spring in Panama on the day U.S.
officials announced his indictment in connection with the
drug-laundering scheme. The indictment followed an investigation
which resulted in charges against 127 people and two Latin American
banks.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in Washington that the
United States is moving to extradite Martinez, even though his name
was not on a list of the ``Dozen Most Wanted'' drug traffickers
Thornburgh sent Tuesday to the Colombian government. The list
focused on the leaders of the Medellin and Cali cartels.
   On Tuesday, columnist Francisco Santos expressed the public's
outrage at the Friday murder of Sen. Galan, an outspoken foe of the
drug lords.
   ``The killing of Galan has to be the drop that makes the cup
overflow'' and end the terror that has paralyzed the Colombian
establishment, he wrote in the daily El Tiempo. ``Let the country's
bloody assassins know that the Colombian state indeed can fight them
with energy and will.''
   Officials said Martinez was being held under strict security at
the headquarters of the national police department's judicial
investigations division.
   Martinez was captured in a weekend raid on a rural estate at
Tolu, on the Caribbean coast 550 miles north of Bogota. Police said
he offered no resistance.
   In an interview with a local reporter, Martinez said: ``At no
time have I had links to the Medellin cartel and I don't know any of
its members.''
   Col. Oscar Carmona, chief of the judicial investigations
division, said the extradition process began Tuesday with the
dispatch of notes to the Justice Ministry and U.S. Embassy informing
them of the arrest.
   Radio reports, quoting unidentified government sources, said
officials at the Justice Ministry and President Virgilio Barco's
office were drawing up specific procedures for handing Martinez over
to the United States.
   One of several emergency measures Barco announced Friday gave his
government the authority to extradite drug dealers without judicial
review, relieving the besieged judiciary of responsibility.
   Since 1981, assassins working for the cocaine barons have killed
220 judges, magistrates and judicial aides.
   Martinez would be the first drug suspect sent to the United
States since 1987, when the Supreme Court nullified an extradition
treaty that had been used to deliver 14 purported drug dealers.
   Invoking powers under the state of siege in effect since 1984,
Barco also authorized confiscation of the property of alleged drug
dealers. A nationwide seizure of estates, ranches and businesses
continued Tuesday.
   Police said 10,972 people had been detained in 467 raids by
police and military forces since the sweep began. A communique from
national police headquarters said 473 weapons were seized.
   Authorities impounded 1,140 cars and trucks, 22 yachts, 135
planes and 15 helicopters, police said. In many cases, they said,
aircraft were being grounded only until the owners could prove were
purchased legitimately and were used only for legal activities.
   Antonio Suarez, president of the National Judicial Employees'
Association, said Colombia's 4,500 judges and magistrates were
ending their strike and forming ``a single front for the salvation
of Colombia's justice system.''
   Barco included funds in his emergency package for protection of
judges.
   On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Julio London Paredes repeated
Colombia's refusal to let U.S. troops assist in the anti-narcotics
campaign.
   ``The Colombian government will not ask for or permit the
presence of foreign troops,'' he said, but added that Colombia
needed U.S. logistical aid. He also said the United States and other
countries should act against the citizens who provide the market for
cocaine.

   A retired State Patrol officer upset after
a fight with his wife and armed with rifles and handguns held police
at bay for 19 hours before surrendering Tuesday.
   Marlin Wicklund, who also had a police radio, a portable radio
and walkie-talkies that let him monitor authorities from his mobile
home in this central Minnesota city, was taken to a hospital after
surrendering, police said.
   ``That was the agreement we made through the negotiations, that
he would be allowed to talk to a doctor,'' said Police Chief Ralph
Hitchens.
   Wicklund, 56, served with the patrol for 31 years before retiring
in 1985.
   Police said Wicklund years, had a fight with his wife, Norma,
Monday night and was drinking heavily before Mrs. Wicklund called
police. Hitchens said Wicklund had threatened a pizza delivery boy,
and after his wife stepped in to calm him, accosted her before she
fled the house.
   Neighbors were evacuated from about 25 trailer homes during the
standoff, and 15 officers remained on duty throughout the night,
said Crow Wing County Sheriff Frank Ball.
   Around 2 a.m., Wicklund stepped outside and fired a small-caliber
pistol into the air twice.
   No injuries were reported.

   Prosecutors said Wednesday they have
enough evidence to indict the leader of South Korea's largest
opposition party in connection with a legislator's secret trip to
North Korea.
   A statement issued by the prosecutor's office said it will decide
whether to bring formal charges against Kim Dae-jung after further
investigation.
   Prosecution sources said Kim, head of the Party for Peace and
Democracy, would not be physically detained.
   ``Should the prosecution indict me, I will fight squarely in
court,'' Kim told reporters. ``I am innocent and I expect truth to
be established.''
   Kim was released early Wednesday following 15 hours of
interrogation, the second time in three weeks he has faced
questioning about the illegal trip to communist North Korea by
National Assemblyman Suh Kyung-won.
   Prosecutors said they have enough evidence to indict Kim on
grounds he knew about Suh's August 1988 trip to North two months
before the case was made public in June 1989. They said they also
have evidence he received $10,000 from Suh who had received the
money from North Korean agents.
   Kim has vigorously denied the allegations and accused the
government of harassment and trying to embarrass and discredit his
party.
   The statement issued by the prosecutor's office said Kim Won-ki,
the party's floor leader who was questioned Tuesday, may also be
indicted in the Suh case.
   Suh, who was arrested June 28, has been charged with espionage,
violating a ban on unauthorized travel to North Korea and receiving
$120,000 from communist agents.
   Suh, a 52-year-old farmer elected to the National Assembly in
April 1988, was expelled from the Party for Peace and Democracy
after his trip to the north was made public. The Seoul government
prohibits unauthorized visits to the North and failure to report
knowledge of such a trip is also a crime.
   Prosecutors quoted Suh as admitting he met with North Korean
President Kim Il Sung in Pyongyang in August 1988 and giving $10,000
to Kim Dae-jung in Seoul.
   The prosecutors also claimed that Suh in mid-April told Kim
Dae-jung about his secret trip. That would be two months earlier
than Kim said he was informed.
   Lawyers who belong to the opposition party said Suh was forced to
make a false confession to incriminate the party leader.

   Hurricane Erin posed a danger to ships in the North
Atlantic on Tuesday, but had little chance of reaching land with its
75 mph winds, forecasters said.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, the hurricane's center was located near 30.7
degrees north latitude and 46.7 degrees west longitude, or about
1,050 miles southwest of the Azores in the central North Atlantic.
The storm was moving west-northwest at about 12 mph.
   Higher gusts were blowing north of the center, and the storm was
expected to maintain its strength for the next 12 to 24 hours, the
center said.
   ``It's not going to have any effect anywhere,'' said National
Weather Service specialist Bob Ebaugh. ``All in all, it looks like
it's just going to be hanging out in the ocean. The only effect it
will have is possibly on some shipping in the North Atlantic.''
   Erin formed as a tropical depression Friday off Africa and became
a named storm Sunday night when sustained winds reached 39 mph.
Hurricanes are formed when winds hit 74 mph.
   There have been seven depressions during the Atlantic hurricane
season running from June 1 to Nov. 30. Erin is the third hurricane
of the year.

   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat on Tuesday
compared the killing of Palestinian collaborating with Israel to the
slaying of Europeans who aided Nazi occupation forces during World
War II.
   He also hinted that the Palestine Liberation Organization would
reconsider its policies if what he called ``Israeli crimes''
continue, but said the organization stands by its peace proposals.
   Asked at a news conference about increasing Arab attacks on
purported collaborators in the Israeli-occupied territories Arafat
responded: ``Are you against it? Are you against it?''
   ``They are quislings, those who are coordinating with our
enemies.''
   ``How many quislings were killed in Europe during the Nazi
occupation? And even after the withdrawal, you remember what
happened in Paris?'' he asked, referring to attacks on French people
who collaborated with German forces during World War II.
   But he said Arabs collaborating with Israel should be given a
chance to repent and should be singled out for punishment only by
the Palestinian leadership, not individuals.
   Arabs have slain 97 Palestinians accused as collaborators during
the 20 months of the uprising against Israeli occupation. Israeli
troops and settlers have killed at least 545 Palestinians during the
uprising and 38 Israelis have perished.
   The underground leadership of the uprising this month accused
Israel of trying to divide Palestinians by inspiring leaflets that
falsely accused Arab patriots of being collaborators. Among those
accused was PLO Executive Committee member Mohammed Milhem, who sat
near Arafat on Tuesday and helped translate his remarks.
   Arafat arrived in Amman Sunday and held talks with King Hussein
and senior aides. He left for an undisclosed destination after the
news conference.

   President Bush is offering to help
Colombia battle cocaine cartels, but that country's president says
U.S. troops are not needed to restore peace to his violence-torn
nation, the White House says
   Colombian President Virgilio Barco Vargas' statement, during a
Monday evening phone conversation with the vacationing Bush,
reinforced earlier statements by Bush aides that U.S. troops would
not be dispatched to Colombia except in extreme cases.
   A White House statement said Bush called Barco to express
condolences over the assassination last week of the leading
Colombian presidential candidate, Luis Carlos Galan.
   ``The president assured President Barco of his strong support,
and expressed his admiration for the steps he has taken to restore
law and order,'' the statement said.

   Federal Reserve policymakers, meeting privately
today, likely will decide against lowering interest rates soon
despite pressure from the Bush administration, analysts say.
   The Federal Open Market Committee, which controls the benchmark
federal funds rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans,
is devising the central bank's monetary strategy for the next six
weeks.
   But, as usual under the committee's procedure, the results won't
be publicly disclosed until Oct. 6, three days after the next
meeting.
   Most analysts expected the Fed to hold interest rates steady
unless it sees unexpected signs that economic growth is fizzling.

   A south Texas city is fighting to protect the
springs that make it a desert oasis from a Pentagon proposal to rock
a nearby ranch with a series of massive underground explosions.
   The proposed explosions on the Buck King Ranch near Del Rio,
Texas, are an important element in U.S. strategic deterrent
capabilities, says the Defense Nuclear Agency.
   The non-nuclear explosions are designed to simulate the impact of
nuclear blasts on subterranean missile silos and military command
centers.
   But 12,000 of the 40,000 Del Rio residents have signed petitions
asking the agency to take its explosives elsewhere. They say they
don't want to take any chances with the Texas border city's only
source of water, the San Felipe Springs.

   Black community leaders, citing racial
factors in legal proceedings against the nation's longest-standing
death row inmate, are urging that his life be spared.
   William Andrews, on death row nearly 15 years, had faced
execution today for his role in the torture-murders of three whites
at an Ogden stereo shop. The victims and two survivors were forced
to drink liquid drain cleaner before being shot in the head.
   The 34-year-old former airman from Jonesboro, La., won a reprieve
Saturday when a federal appellate court ordered a stay based on a
writ of habeas corpus that claimed the court showed a racial bias in
excluding a black man as a juror in Andrews' trial.
   James Gillespie Sr., president of the Ogden chapter of the NAACP
and father of the juror who was excluded, said the death sentence
reflects prevailing attitudes in Utah, which he labeled a ``racist
state.''

<HEAD>Director of Commercials Gambles on a Movie</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ``Let It Ride'' opened Aug. 18</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joe Pytka's name might be unfamiliar to
moviegoers, but his commercials certainly aren't.
   From Madonna's short-lived Pepsi spot (``Go ahead, make a wish'')
to Bo Jackson's celebrity-filled Nike plug (``Just do it''), Pytka's
TV ads rattle with vivid visuals of his eclectic, offbeat style.
   But in making a movie _ ``Let It Ride,'' starring Richard
Dreyfuss _ the attention-grabbing director had to tone it down and
make his bold camera work disappear.
   ``In a commercial, you kind of grab people by the back of the
neck and shove them in,'' said Pytka, who also directed the ``Dirty
Diana'' and ``The Way You Make Me Feel'' music videos for Michael
Jackson.
   ``In commercials, I become a performer for my clients,'' he said.
``In a film, I was just one of the crew. I was invisible on this
film. In a film, you have to let people participate. I think that
films that tend to be bombastic wear you out before they're over.''
   ``Let It Ride'' is a comedy about a compulsive gambler named Jay
Trotter (Dreyfuss) who has a really good day at the races. Joining
Trotter at the track are his unlucky pal, Looney (David Johansen,
also known as the musician Buster Poindexter), and his frustrated
wife, Pam (Teri Garr). The movie also co-stars Allen Garfield,
Jennifer Tilly and Michelle Phillips.
   At 90 minutes, ``Let It Ride'' runs substantially longer than any
commercial or music video Pytka has made. Among other things, the 11
weeks of filming showed him that the movie business operates on an
entirely different level than the ad world.
   ``The level of performing you work with in a film like this is so
far beyond what would be available to you in a commercial,'' Pytka
said. ``Most commercials are populated by models and attractive
people. They're not actors.
   ``Commercial spots are usually cast visually. You cast
stereotypically in a commercial _ somebody has to look like somebody
because you only have 30 seconds and that's it. You cast businessmen
who look like businessmen; mothers who look like mothers. And the
performance is usually just one note; you don't have climaxes and
you don't have to work with range.
   ``Here, the care and feeding of the performer is the primary
concern. This is a performance film, totally. This film will live
and die on the merits of its performance.''
   In its first weekend of release, ``Let It Ride'' failed to make a
killing at the box office. It debuted at No. 12 on the charts,
grossing $1.9 million.
   Pytka said he has wanted to make a dramatic feature films for
years.
   ``I started out doing documentaries, and I got frustrated,'' he
said. ``A film is the natural extension of any desire to work in
film. It's the ultimate for an actor, it's the ultimate for a
filmmaker.
   ``Richard was attached to the project when the script was given
to me. And you don't turn down an opportunity to work with a person
of that caliber. For me, as a first-time film director, to be able
to work with somebody like Dreyfuss is a thing you don't turn down.''
   Though pleased with his debut performance, Pytka is bothered that
movies invite far less daring than commercials.
   ``I would love to do a film like my commercials,'' he said. ``But
you can't get surreal in films too much. Filmmaking is a public art.
It needs a big public response.
   ``I just did a commercial where these lumberjacks are being
chased by a yeti. They run into their truck. Their truck is too
small to carry them all. So they get out of the truck, they pull on
the truck and stretch it into a bigger truck, get into the truck and
drive away.
   ``The yeti just misses them and kicks the dirt. That is surreal.
When you try to do something like that (in the movies) it doesn't
get a response.''

<HEAD>Space Engineer's End-Time Scenario Meets Criticism</HEAD>

   He's at it again, trumpeting the beginning of the
end, ``the rapture.'' Edgar Whisenant misdated it before,
incorrectly exciting a lot of people. But now he's touting a new
deadline _ next Friday.
   ``Everything points to it,'' says the retired NASA rocket
engineer. ``All the evidence has piled up.''
   This time, however, warning criticisms were being sounded against
buying his revised end-time scenario, although there were
indications of another Bible Belt surge of attention to it.
   Heavy circulation of Whisenant's new, 96-page book, ``The Final
Shout: Rapture Report _ 1989,'' was reported across the South, in
many cases in free mailings by the Nashville, Tenn., publisher,
World Bible Society.
   ``The time is short,'' says Whisenant. ``I'm telling people the
end is near and to get their children and everyone they care about
under the blood of Jesus.''
   The Rev. Bill Gordon of Atlanta, associate director of the
Southern Baptist interfaith witness department, issued a paper
urging people not to be deceived by Whisenant's ``rapture''
predictions.
   ``Whisenant builds his predictions upon misinterpretation,
misapplication and conjecture,'' Gordon says. ``He constantly takes
Scriptural passages out of context and gives them meanings which the
biblical writers would find strange.''
   Gordon says Whisenant's book reads more like an ``Indiana Jones''
movie than good theology.
   Whisenant, 56, of Little Rock, Ark., said in a telephone
interview, ``I don't care what they call me, or what they say about
me as long as they've heard what I'm telling them.
   ``Like Ripley, they can believe it or not. They don't have to be
surprised when it happens unless they choose to be.
   ``If I didn't tell them, then their blood would be on my hands.
God would hold me accountable. No matter what they say, I'll say
what I think even if it kills me when I believe it's the truth and
it's important.
   ``I'm giving it my best shot. Win, lose or draw, I'm home free
with God.''
   Whisenant, formerly a Kennedy Space Center electrical engineer
involved in the early rocket launches and moon-landing program,
retired in 1968. He said he has concentrated since then on analyzing
biblical prophecy.
   ``It's an obsession,'' he said. ``But it's not an ego trip. It's
a fear trip, the fear of God.''
   He first gained public notice with his small book, ``88 Reasons
Why the Rapture Will Be in l988,'' with a reported 4.5 million
copies sold or given away.
   Whisenant said he was mistaken in setting the date as September
1988, chiefly because his mathematical calculations were off by one
year due to a quirk in the modern Gregorian calendar.
   Comments Gordon: ``The amazing thing is that so many Christians
took him seriously.'' Citing reports indicating another huge
distribution of the revised prognostications, Gordon says:
   ``The Lord Jesus will come again when the Father chooses and not
according to Mr. Whisenant's timetable.''
   Whisenant said he previously failed to consider that the calendar
counts only 99 years in the first century, beginning with A.D. 1
instead of a zero year. Other centuries begin with a zero year, such
as 1900.
   He said that detail, plus a maze of other numerical computations
and allusions from Scripture and historical events, put the date
ahead to this coming Sept. 1, 1989.
   ``I'm confident about it, more strongly than before,'' he said,
adding that he was 96 percent certain, with the other 4 percent
allotted to the next four years up to 1993.
   He said he had concluded that last year actually was intended as
a preliminary notice or shout that ``the Bridgegoom cometh,'' as
mentioned in Matt: 25:1-13, before actually appearing.
   ``This shout gave God's people a one-year awakening so they would
be ready,'' Whisenant said.
   At the ``rapture,'' he said, 40 million born-again Christians
will undergo an instantaneous chemical body change, their new bodies
able to appear and disappear and pass through walls.
   He said they'll remain on Earth up to nine days before joining
Christ in heaven's third level after which there will be seven years
of earthly tribulation, including three nuclear wars before a final
Armageddon.
   At that point, he said, Jesus will descend with his angels,
victorious in the final war, and beginning a 1,000-year reign of
peace and prosperity before the Last Judgment.
   Whisenant said his book last year earned $5.5 million for the
publisher, but he himself took no royalty. ``I'll get all my reward
in heaven,'' he said. He said it's OK if the publisher prefers
rewards in this world, adding:
   ``I'll take mine in the next. I don't think I'm wrong. I've put
my life on it. I just believe the Bible, the way it's written. .. .
Get your heart right with Jesus. It's like picking up a
thousand-dollar bill on the sidewalk. It's that simple.''

   Nationwide, late at night, about four million
people keep company with four men before turning off the television.
   Faithful viewers of ``Late Night With David Letterman'' know
these men as ``The World's Most Dangerous Band.''
   ``Dave started it,'' explained the kinetic bass guitarist Will
Lee, referring to the origin of the band's name. The sardonic host
tossed out a number of nicknames on air _ The Party Boys of Rock 'n'
Roll, The NBC Orchestra and, repeatedly, The World's Most Dangerous
Band.
   That one stuck.
   Rounding out the band are Sid McGinnis on guitar, Anton Fig
playing drums, and Paul Shaffer as keyboardist and frontman.
   Together and individually they have developed a devoted
following, almost cult-like.
   ``We get quite a lot of mail,'' said the drummer in the band's
dressing room, which is just large enough for a small couch and
water cooler.
   ``Especially this guy,'' interjected Lee, indicating Fig. ``He
gets mail, he gets clothes, he gets trailer houses. Some woman sent
him a casino one time. He's doing great.''
   Letterman himself is also a genuine fan. ``He loves musicians.
And airline pilots. And professional sportsmen,'' said Fig.
   ``They're the most entertaining and best part of the show each
night,'' Letterman said in a telephone interview. ``The band is
always a constant source of energy regardless of whatever else goes
tumbling down.''
   The band is an integral element of the one-hour talk show.
Although they play music for a total of four to five minutes, the
band creates a mood.
   Their ``break tunes,'' going into and coming out of commercials,
raise the energy level of the studio audience. Often, the songs are
chosen on the spur of the moment to play off a remark made by
Letterman or a guest.
   Sometimes the right song is one they've never played before.
   ``We have a basic song list that we fall back on. But through the
whole show we're whispering over there,'' said McGinnis, who is seen
most nights wearing his yellow and black sneakers that match the
bumble bee color scheme of his guitar.
   The band also plays with the show's healthy spectrum of musical
guests: from the Bee Gees to Iggy Pop, Yma Sumac to Miles Davis and
Phil Collins. In one week ``Late Night'' had Jackson Browne, Pete
Townshend and XTC.
   ``We all have to do our homework and play like we're in that
band,'' said Shaffer, whose bespectacled Elton John look dates from
his days arranging music for ``Saturday Night Live.''
   ``Our duty is to back up the artists. We dissect the record, see
what style we have to play each day.''
   Band members receive tapes of the chosen performers the day
before that particular show, but there's usually little time for
group rehearsal outside the roughly 45 minutes the band has with the
featured guest before taping begins at 5:30 p.m. (The show, in its
eighth season, airs weeknights at 12:30 a.m. EDT.)
   ``It's getting easier _ it's like, listen to the song on the way
to the show and you got it,'' said Fig.
   The ``Late Night'' band is active off camera, performing at
various festivals, concerts, and with artists such as Donna Summer,
Was Not Was, The Neville Brothers and Hall and Oates.
   They even did a wedding.
   ``It was a favor to a good friend,'' said Lee. ``And we needed
the rehearsal.''
   ``We played the set we were going to play the next night for our
concert,'' added Fig. ``The wedding was sort of incidental.''
   That concert was their first live recording for two songs on
Shaffer's debut album, ``Coast To Coast,'' released this month on
Capitol Records. Shaffer collaborated with artists he admired,
including the members of the World's Most Dangerous Band, producing
music ranging from guitar rock to blues, surfing instrumentals to
``a marriage of doo-wop and hip-hop.''
   Guest artists include Valerie Simpson, Carole King, Dion, Johnny
Maestro, Allen Toussaint, Bobby Womack, Joe Walsh, Brian Wilson and
The Fresh Prince.
   ``Maybe so many of them did the album because they could hear
themselves in my music,'' speculated Shaffer. ``They understood what
I was doing.''

<TEXT>
   Among the affects of Public Law 100-418, which is
supposed to enhance American competitiveness, is to convert the
nation's forests into massive piles of studies that few people will
read.
   As those paper mountains grow, so will the bureaucracy needed to
tend them _to store them and index them, for example, and to exhume
them now and again for seminars and conferences that produce nothing.
   These are some of the results of the law, whose full
identification is the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.
   In the name of competitiveness and the furtherance of it, the law
contains at least 272 reporting and paperworks requirements. It
mandates new studies, reports, advisory committees, interagency
groups, meetings, seminars and conferences ``to feed the insatiable
curiosity of members of Congress.''
   The phrase in quotations marks is from Murray Weidenbaum, chief
economic adviser in the early months of the Reagan administration.
He is appalled at the legislation, which he says would flunk a
truth-in-labeling test.
   After reading the 467-page law, Weidenbaum describes it as ``an
example of the inability of Congress to control itself.'' Under the
guise of dealing with competitiveness, he says, it responded to
pressure groups and idle curiosities.
   It also reversed the recent trend toward reducing the federal
paperwork burden.``Ecologists should mourn for all the trees that
will be cut down to provide paper for what will literally be an
endles array of studies,'' he says.
   Weidenbaum now heads the Center for the Study of American
Business, an academic-type institution at Washington University, St.
Louis, that affords him the time to indulge in a study of the
massive document. While in Washington, he never could have done so.
He doesn't think many of those now there will either.
   For the president alone, he says, the law dictates four one-time
reports, two periodic reports, two open-ended reports and two new
committees. Is this the way to increase American competitiveness, he
asks?
   Such a burden is awesome, he says, and he suggests it becomes
depressing to dwell on the possibility, indeed the likelihood, that
many of those reports will never be read, especially by members of
Congress who demanded them.
   Every time the president makes a trade agreement with a foreign
country he must _ in addition to telling Congress what if anything
they must do to implement the agreement _ send them a report on
efforts he has made to obtain international exchange rate
equilibrium.
   The report must also indicate what effect the agreement will have
on ``increased international monetary stability.'' In addition, his
report must describe the extent to which any country signing the
agreement maintains a ``noncommercial state trading enterprise''
that may impair U.S. benefits.
   The law is an omnibus, to be sure, adding new duties to the
Departments of Agriculture, commerce, Defense, Education, Labor,
State and Treasury. It involves the Federal Communications
Commission, the General Accounting Office, the Office of Management
and Budget and the Small Business Administration.
   Under the guise of dealing with trade and competitiveness, the
statute responds to ``all sorts of pressure groups and personal
curiosities of members of Congress,'' says Weidenbaum.
   In quite a few instances, he adds, it appears that Congressional
approval of new studies are little more than consolation prizes for
members whose substantive legislative proposals were rejected.
   The Secretary of Agriculture must study the market for lamb in
the United States. If appropriate, ``the report should include
proposals on ways to bring about a long-term increase in per capita
consumption of lamb meat products.''
   The law, concludes Weidenbaum, ``illustrates the unrestrained
nature of congressional mandates at a time when national policy
ostensibly is to focus on improving U.S. efficiency and
productivity.''
   He asks: ``Can the taxpayer expect the members of Congress to
read the detailed reports they require?''
   Good question. Obvious answer. If they were to be so industrious
as to read these reports they'd have little time for anything else.
But maybe they should. Maybe that's the way to prevent more omnibus
laws from getting passed.

<HEAD>Baptists And Catholics Find Basic Accord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southern Baptists and Roman Catholics, the
nation's two largest denominations, generally have been regarded as
doctrinally far apart, but their scholars find they basically agree.
   Despite varied terminology and some real differences, ``we do
share a basic understanding of what it means to be followers of
Jesus Christ by the grace of God,'' says their joint report.
   After 10 years of periodic discussions, the Baptist-Catholic
dialogue group, quoting Ephesians 4:5, concludes, ``We not only
confessed but experienced `One Lord, one faith and one baptism.'''
   The 163-page report is seen as the most full-scale, mutual
examination of respective positions of the two traditions. Achieving
it was an unprecedented experience for Southern Baptists, commonly
averse to ecumenical affairs.
   Both sides admitted past unfairness toward each other, with
predominantly Roman Catholic countries discriminating against
Southern Baptist missionaries and the latter laboring among
Catholics without respecting their faith.
   Such ``competition and conflict'' in missionary work ``can become
a stumbling block to those who have not heard the gospel,'' the
dialogue team said.
   Its report was issued recently in a special issue of
``Theological Educator,'' a journal of the New Orleans Baptist
Theological Seminary, and in a book called ``To Understand Each
Other,'' published by Paulist Press.
   The Rev. Fisher Humphreys, a Southern Baptist theologian and
participant in the dialogue, said it was a rare process for his
denomination, which generally has shunned ecumenical efforts for
Christian unity.
   The talks, sponsored by the Catholic Bishops' Committee on
Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs and the Southern Baptist
Department of Interfaith Witness, involved 18 meetings beteen 1978
and 1988.
   There were about 20 participants in each meeting, but due to
turnover through the decade, 39 people altogether took part. A new
set of meetings is to begin next March.
   Dealing with such topics as Scripture, salvation, spirituality,
church and ministry, grace, missions and escatology (end of time),
the team agreed ``that the ultimate authority and object of faith is
the triune God'' _ Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
   Participants concurred that the ``primary source of our knowledge
of God'' is the Bible, which is ``the inspired Word of God,
authoritative for faith and practice.''
   But the report notes that Baptists, while valuing past tradition
in understanding the Bible, say tradition must be tested by
Scripture, while Catholics say interpretation of Scripture must be
measured by tradition.
   ``The Bible has always been the center of Southern Baptist
life,'' the report notes, adding that since the reforming Second
Vatican Council of 1962-65, Catholicism ``has also become strongly
biblical.''
   On the central Christian task, the report says: ``We all agree
that the proclamation of the offer of salvation to all peoples is
the prime mission of the church.''
   However, the report says Baptists ``stress the experience of
salvation when, in faith, a person accepts Jesus as ... personal
Savior,'' while Catholics stress the redemptive ``work of Christ''
through faith and church sacraments.
   ``We both set the highest priority on seeking a conscious
relationship with God in this life and on striving for the ultimate
goal of living in glory with God in heaven,'' the report says.
   ``We affirm that our love for God is best achieved in a close
relationship with Jesus, coupled with a Christ-like love of
neighbor.''
   Noting that Catholic devotion to Mary and the saints ``has been a
source of division and misunderstanding,'' the report says:
   ``While Roman Catholics affirm with Baptists the sole
mediatorship of Christ,'' they also honor the Virgin Mary as
``inseparably linked'' with her son's ``saving work'' and invoke her
support in prayers.
   Baptists ``honor Mary as the mother of Jesus Christ'' but
consider the ``communion of saints as primarily a present reality
among Christians,'' and don't pray to Mary or ``deceased Christians
lest such infringe the sole mediatorship of Jesus Christ.''
   However, ``great progress has been made in mutual understanding''
on this matter, the report says, with Catholic devotion to Mary
undergoing ``significant change'' since the Second Vatican Council,
seeing her more in biblical terms.
   ``Both Southern Baptists and Roman Catholics agree that salvation
is God's free gift of grace, unmerited by any human works or
righteousness,'' the report says.
   The report says both Baptists and Catholics regard the church as
``the body of Christ,'' but Baptists stress the individual
congregation, while Catholics see the church in broader dimensions
as the entire ``People of God.''
   Catholic and Baptist worship differs ``in tone and style,''
Catholic worship centering on liturgical prayers and Holy Communion,
while Baptist worship centers on preaching, singing and prayer, the
report says, adding:
   ``Both groups have a strong sense both of human sinfulness and of
God's love even amid our sins and failings; both stress strong
family life and sexual morality; both stress active engagement in
church life.''

   Questions about the ``brave new world'' of
biotechnology and its uses to eliminate fetuses of unwanted sex or
those with likely handicaps are raised in this year's Respect Life
Program manual.
   The year-long program, sponsored annually by the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, is linked to the Oct. 1 observance
of Respect Life Sunday in parishes and schools around the country.
   In the manual, Pope John Paul II is quoted as saying that
``America's dedication to improving the quality of life ... offers
mixed blessings, its arguments sometimes used to imply some lives
are less worthy of protection than others.''

for three of the past four years, the number of new non-resident
inactive church members, those who move away and do not join another
church, has far exceeded the number of new resident church members.
   ``That means we are losing from the participating membership in

consultant with the Southern Baptist Sunday School Board.
   He says that when non-resident inactive members are growing at

   Repesentatives of two Orthodox branches that
split in the fifth century over presumed differences about the
nature of Christ have agreed on a joint statement of common faith.
   The agreement, developed by a joint commission, was seen as
overcoming a major obstacle to restoration of full communion between
Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy after 1,500 years of separation.
   They divided in the fifth century when the Orientals did not
participate in the Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon, which defined
two natures of Christ, divine and human. Orientals affirmed one
united divine-human nature.
   The joint statement says, ``Those among us who speak of two
natures in Christ do not thereby deny their inseparable, indivisible
union; those among us who speak of one united divine-human nature in
Christ do not deny the continuing dynamic presence in Christ of the
divine and the human ...
   ``We neither separate nor divide the human nature in Christ from
his divine nature, nor do we think that the former was absorbed in
the latter and thus ceased to exist.''

   Colstrip, Mont., spends $5,148 per pupil. The district's
6-year-old high school is flush with computers, up-to-date labs,
even a greenhouse and indoor pool.
   This eastern Montana district, with a tax base enriched by the
presence of four power plants, offers high school pupils several
foreign languages and such electives as zoology, microbiology and
geology.
   Superior, in the western end of the state, spends about $3,000
per pupil. The newest school building is 28 years old. There are no
science electives beyond basic biology, chemistry and physics, in
labs described as ``woefully inadequate'' by former superintendent
William Donahue.
   Indoor swimming pools or greenhouses like in Colstrip?
   ``Those would be dreams,'' said Donahue.
   Such contrasts between rich and poor districts, endemic to
virtually every state, put school finance at the top of the
education reform agenda this past year.
   As 43 million children prepare for a new school year, an
Associated Press survey found 11 states defending against lawsuits
brought by parents or school districts challenging the
constitutionality of school funding systems _ systems that critics
have long held discriminate against those living in communities with
lower property tax revenues.
   ``While many people talk about the importance of educational
reform, children in low-wealth districts would be helped a lot just
to be brought to where high-spending districts now are,'' said
Arthur Wise, a school finance expert at The RAND Corporation, a
Washington think-tank.
   States with active lawsuits or court orders concerning school
finance are Alaska, Connecticut, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota,
Montana, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oregon, Tennessee and Texas.
   A coalition of poor Alabama districts says it will probably sue
that state this fall.
   In Florida, 22 districts sued the state in 1986. The state won a
summary judgment in 1987.
   Montana, under court order since February to reform its funding
system, held a special legislative session this summer, which
boosted state education spending by $61 million but which critics
say failed to solve the equity problems.
   Oklahoma legislators likewise have been meeting in special
session this summer to consider sweeping proposals by Gov. Henry
Bellmon that would substitute income and other taxes for much of the
school property tax. So far, nothing has been decided.
   The equity issue has reasserted itself in the school reform
agenda this year for several reasons. Chiefly, many state funding
systems are simply out-of-date, formulated in the early 1970s during
the last great wave of school finance reform.
   ``In many states, you have a finance system dating from the early
1970s. You still have that system in 1989 when the school
expectations, the demographics and the economics are all different.
You can take me to any state from Michigan to Iowa to Montana, and I
could tell you that same story,'' said Kent McGuire who follows such
money matters for the Education Commission of the States in Denver.
   And school reform, with its mandates requiring rich and poor
districts alike to fund smaller classes, higher teacher pay and
other costly measures, has pushed many small, tax-poor districts to
their financial limits.
   ``It's clear that as the reform agenda moves on, that's anted up
the cost,'' McGuire said.
   In many states, the school finance issue is pitting rural
districts with poor tax bases against bigger, wealthier ones. With
farm values declining and fewer children interested in pursuing
agricultural careers, the quality of schools in rural districts has
become a more urgent concern.
   In North Dakota, nine school districts and 48 parents filed suit
in June, claiming the state's system of providing aid to schools is
unconstitutional.
   A school district's ability to finance eduction is ``unfairly and
inequitably linked'' to its property wealth, said Calvin Rolfson, a
Bismarck attorney representing the plaintiffs.
   In Texas, where a lawsuit brought by a group of smaller districts
is pending before the state Supreme Court, lead attorney Al Kauffman
said, ``They have no chemistry, no physics, no calculus, foreign
language, pre-kindergarten, or college prep, no extra-curricular, no
band, choir, football, no debate. They have 96 percent low-income
students. Those students are not being given a chance in this
society.''
   ``We've managed to just squeak by year after year,'' said Antonio
Parra, a spokesman for the San Elizario school district. ``But
taxpayers in our school district will probably face another tax
increase. How long can you stretch a rubber band?''
   In Connecticut, Oregon and New Jersey, by contrast, the poor
children suing the state live in metro areas.
   The non-profit Education Law Center, in a suit on behalf of 20
school-aged children in Camden, Irvington, East Orange and Jersey
City, N.J., won its first victory last summer when Administrative
Law Judge Steven Lefelt ruled that the 1975 state formula for
funding public education has failed and is unconstitutional.
   In a scathing ruling, Lefelt found that poorer, urban districts
are overcrowded, have fewer teachers, poor equipment, decaying
buildings, and more limited course offerings than wealthy suburban
districts.
   State education commissioner Saul Cooperman has rejected those
findings, as has Gov. Thomas H. Kean who dismissed Lefelt's ruling
as ``an interesting liberal treatise.'' The state Supreme Court is
scheduled to hear arguments Sept. 25.
   In Connecticut, where the state is being sued by a group of urban
schoolchildren and parents, assistant superintendent Daniel Shamas
in Bridgeport said his district fights a constant budget battle.
   Bridgeport spends $5,431 per year on each of its 19,270 students.
Affluent Westport, just 10 miles away, spends $8,299 per pupil.
   ``If you look at the state as a whole, you see two
Connecticuts,'' one rich and one poor, Shamas said. ``If you look at
what we're spending per pupil and what other (more wealthy) towns
are spending, that tells the whole story.''
   Westport Schools Comptroller Frederick J. Nigri rejects the
argument that rich and poor towns offer substantially different
educational opportunities.
   ``For the basic educational program, a child can get a great deal
out of a big-city system if they're motivated,'' Nigri said. ``We
may have some better enrichment programs, perhaps a little better
drama program, but I like to think there's some education equality.''
   While not yet the subject of a lawsuit in Michigan, school
finance has become one of that state's thorniest issues. After
failing to solve the problem, the legislature has placed two
competing referendums for voters to decide in November. One would
raise some $400 million in school funds with a sales tax hike; the
other would hike sales taxes by $468 million but offer $1.3 billion
in property-tax relief.
   ``There has never been a time that I've been told by the
districts and educators that we've provided enough money,'' said Ken
Nelson, a legislator in Minnesota where 48 school districts have
filed suit claiming that state's funding formula is unfair. ``Nobody
knows what really is enough money. That's a judgment call.''

   NEW HAMPSHIRE _ Districts pay an average of 85 percent of
education costs, chiefly with property taxes. Voters in 1984 passed
constitutional amendment saying state government had to pay for
programs it mandates. Many feel state is not abiding by the law, and
Claremont School Board is considering suit.
   
   NEW JERSEY _ State Supreme Court scheduled to hear arguments
Sept. 25 in lawsuit on behalf of 20 school-aged children in Camden,
Irvington, East Orange and Jersey City. Group won a victory last
summer when an administrative judge ruled state's school funding
formula unconstitutional because of disparities between rich and
poor districts.
   
   NEW MEXICO _ Since 1986 when a state law limited school property
taxes, more than 95 percent of the operational funds for public
schools come from state appropriations. But with school spending
still lagging, some now support increasing reliance on property
taxes so long as it's equitable.
   
   NEW YORK _ Long Island voters, angered by property tax increases
of as much as 60 percent, rejected school budgets in 28 districts
this spring, greatest number in at least a decade. Governor's
commission recommended changes in state aid formula, but Legislature
took no significant action.
   
   NORTH CAROLINA _ Most school funding comes from state, and all
counties get same amount of funding. But state sources say
Reidsville City School System is considering suing state over its
funding formula.
   
   NORTH DAKOTA _ Nine school districts and 48 parents filed suit
against state in June, claiming North Dakota's system of providing
aid to public schools is unconstitutional. Suit pits urban
districts, which have more students but less property wealth,
against rural districts, with fewer students and more property from
which to draw tax revenue.
   
   OHIO _ Lawmakers have for years debated dozens of proposals that
backers say would close the funding gap among Ohio schools; none
have passed. Last year, Legislature approved local-option income tax
provision. Some 85 districts as of July 7 had taken initial steps to
compute income tax rates.
   
   OKLAHOMA _ Legislators this summer considering Gov. Henry
Bellmon's ambitious plan to replace most of the property tax with a
special school tax and a system of income tax surcharges. Bellmon
says his plan would add $281.5 million for Oklahoma schools; it
faced stiff opposition.
   
   OREGON _ Federal lawsuit filed this spring on behalf of three
Portland high school seniors challenges state's school funding
method. Group of school districts plans similar challenge. State
pays about 30 percent of costs of local schools; local property
taxes pay most of remainder.
   
   PENNSYLVANIA _ Voters in May trounced referendum backed by Gov.
Robert P. Casey designed to rework the way local governments tax
residents. Plan sought to reduce residential property taxes by
allowing local governments and school officials to impose new income
and sales taxes.
   
   RHODE ISLAND _ Legislature voted in 1985 to limit local property
tax increases to 5.5 percent a year in exchange for increased state
education aid. The state, which contributed 40 percent of local
education costs in 1985, now kicks in 50 percent; goal is 60 percent
by 1993.
   
   SOUTH CAROLINA _ The Education Finance Act passed in 1978
includes formula to calculate tax-paying ability of each school
district. Assessors must meet minimum standard for that school
district, then the state provides additional funds.
   
   SOUTH DAKOTA _ The Legislature froze local property taxes
effective July 1 at request of Gov. George Mickelson. Local
governments have the power to exempt themselves. The freeze was
imposed to give state time to study school funding methods, which
depend almost solely on property and sales tax.
   
   TENNESSEE _ Sixty-six school districts have sued state claiming
smaller districts come up short in school funding and state fails to
make up the difference. No court date set. State provides about 50
percent of school funding, virtually all from sales tax.
   
   TEXAS _ Group of school districts has sued state claiming funding
method is discriminatory. The districts won lower court ruling,
which was reversed by appeals court. Case pending before Texas
Supreme Court.
   
   UTAH _ State's funding system, the ``weighted pupil unit,'' is
among the most equal in the nation, providing about $2,400 per
student in state funds. But per pupil spending still ranks near
bottom.
   
   VERMONT _ State equalization formula changed over the last three
years to take property tax rates into account, and state money for
local schools doubled from $71 million in 1985 to $137 million.
Still, property tax rates have soared in several large districts;
Bennington and Middlebury defeated school budgets.
   
   VIRGINIA _ Legislative commission created this year looking at
ways to ease school property taxes. State budget for 1988-90
included a $550 million-plus boost in school aid, with state
increasing its share of local school costs from 50 percent to 52
percent over the two-year period. Gov. Gerald Baliles has set goal
of 55 percent.
   
   WASHINGTON _ Ten-year-old court ruling required state to fully
fund education. Local levies permitted only for enrichment, and now
average about 17 percent of the state allocation. Voters this fall
will decide a ``Children's Initiative'' to increase spending.
   
   WEST VIRGINIA _ State remains under 1982 court order declaring
school finance system unconstitutional and ordering Department of
Education to draw up a plan to correct inequities. Second ruling
declared state's property tax system unconstitutional. Changes would
cost $1.3 billion, but entire state budget is only $1.7 billion.
   
   WISCONSIN _ State Supreme Court in February upheld school funding
formula under which state apportions about $1.3 billion a year among
districts. Milwaukee school officials argued unsuccessfully that
children in large cities have special high-cost problems.
   
   WYOMING _ Superintendent of Public Instruction Lynn Simons in
August urged Legislature to add a 1 percent sales tax to ease
financial problems in state education funding to raise $50 million a
year. Simons suggested increase to make up for Wyoming's dwindling
oil and gas money reserves that have been used to fund school
programs.

<HEAD>Julie Sommars is Matlock's Courtroom Opponent and Love Interest</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>

   Julie Sommars plays both Andy Griffith's
courtroom adversary and his love interest in NBC's ``Matlock.''
   ``I'm frequently the prosecutor going up against defense attorney
Matlock, so that makes me the loser of the week,'' Sommars said.
``I'm the modern-day Hamilton Burger, who was defeated every week by
`Perry Mason.'
   ``Andy said we have to have a show where I win a case. ...
Actually, I did win once. Matlock was accused of jury tampering. I
quit my job with the district attorney's office and defended him. I
was wonderful and he got off.''
   Sommars made a guest appearance on the show near the end of the
first season in 1987. It was to be a one-time appearance. But she
did a second episode that season and was put under contract as a
recurring character at the opening of the second season.
   Battling lovers is an old dramatic custom that Shakespeare used
and that Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn honed to perfection in
their movies. Griffith as Ben Matlock and Sommars as Julie March
generally confine their confrontations to the courtroom.
   ``Andy writes most of our scenes together, which is why they work
so well,'' she said. ``He wants our relationship to be entertaining
but he also wants it to be mature and grownup. He makes it work and
that's why they keep asking me back.
   ``We can't do what they do in `L.A. Law.' We can't jump into the
shower. It has to be a relationship. This is an eight o'clock show.
When you have two people talking together, yet you have to show
love, that's very hard to write. I don't know if they've ever been
to bed. But I think they have and that's the way I play it. I don't
know if Andy's playing it that way.''
   Although ``Matlock'' generally runs second to ABC's comedy block,
it was 14th in the ratings for the 1988-89 season. It leads off
NBC's Tuesday night schedule and is followed by ``In the Heat of the
Night'' and ``Midnight Caller.''
   Sommars celebrates her 30th year in show business this year, but
``Matlock'' is only her second series.
   She co-starred with Dan Dailey as his daughter in ``The Governor
and J.J.'' from 1969 to '72. She won a Golden Globe as best actress
in a comedy series in 1969 for the role.
   ``I came here right out of high school in Aberdeen, S.D., and the
very first thing I did was on `The Loretta Young Show,''' she said.
``I played her daughter. I had no wardrobe of my own, but it turned
out Loretta Young and I were the exact same size. She let me wear
some of her wardrobe. The hairdresser said, `She must like you.
She's never done that before.'
   ``I wore a pair of her earrings and on the first day she came by
and told me to take good care of them because they were emeralds.
Any time I wasn't on camera I had my hands on my ears to protect the
earrings. Loretta Young saw me and said, `I was only kidding.
They're not really emeralds. I just wanted to impress upon you not
to believe everything people tell you in this business.' I wish I'd
taken her advice.''
   Sommars said a guest spot on ``Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' led to a
role in the feature film ``The Pad'' and to ``The Governor and
J.J.'' One of the writers on ``U.N.C.L.E.'' was Dean Hargrove,
co-executive producer of ``Matlock.''
   She's married to an attorney and has a 16-year-old daughter from
a previous marriage and two stepchildren.
   ``A recurring role is great for me,'' she said. ``It's nice to be
part of a series family but it's also nice not to have to go to work
every day. Andy is the hardest-working actor I've ever known. He not
only knows his lines, he knows your lines, too.
   ``Betty Davis is like that, too. We were on an episode of
`Gunsmoke.' I was the sweet young thing and she was the mean ranch
owner. I was the low man on the totem pole, so they did my close-ups
last. They'd tell her she could leave but she always stayed to read
her lines off-camera to me.''

<HEAD>War Forever Changed America's Role, Vision of Self</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Adolf Hitler's troops crossed into the
stubble fields of western Poland on Sept. 1, 1939, The New York
World's Fair was beguiling visitors with its vision of ``The World
of Tomorrow.''
   Now, 50 years later, the America you see around you may not bear
much resemblance to some of the predictions of that exposition in
Flushing Meadows, but it was shaped irreversibly by the world
conflagration touched off in Poland.
   The fair demonstrated that television pictures could be
transmitted not only in the New York metropolitan area but to
viewers all of 130 miles away. There were other glimpses of the
future, some accurate and some not.
   But as the New York Times observed in an editorial, the world of
tomorrow still had ``a great deal of unfinished business in it.''
   In Baltimore, the young poet Karl Shapiro observed a robbery in
his neighborhood, ``an unheard of thing, an augury of things to come
after the war.''
   The war. To Americans of Shapiro's generation, the words would
mean only one thing: World War II.
   When it started, America was a nation of 132 million people,
struggling out of the Great Depression. It had an Army of 189,839
men, including the Air Corps, and a Navy of 125,202. The federal
government employed a civilian work force of 905,000.
   Except for the wealthy and a handful of expatriate artists, few
Americans went abroad. Republican Alf Landon, warning in that last
pre-war summer against being drawn into ``the balance-of-power
game'' in Europe, said, ``Never has there been a more urgent call to
be Americans, first, last, and all the time.''
   Looking back at that time, Roger Beaumont, a Texas A&amp;M military
historian on leave to teach at the U.S. Naval Academy, said in a
recent interview, ``There was a long period of the United States
having a very weak willingness to be involved in world affairs
except during that very tiny moment during World War I, when the
United States lunged onto the stage and then looked kind of
bewildered and jumped back off again.
   ``We've got a completely different history behind us now,''
Beaumont said.
   What a history! Pearl Harbor. Bataan. Rosie the Riveter. The
Marshall Plan. The Cold War. Vietnam. Radar. Computers. The atomic
bomb.
   ``For most people my age, the war and its aftermath were the most
intense experience of our lives,'' Telford Taylor, chief American
prosecutor at 12 of the 13 Nuremberg war crimes trials, told oral
historian Studs Turkel.
   By the time the war ended, 293,986 Americans would have died in
combat, nearly as many as the total enlistment in the Army and Navy
in 1939.
   Today, in a nation of 247 million people, more than 2.1 million
Americans wear their country's uniform and 3.1 million work for the
federal government as civilians. The latest Commerce Department
figures for a 12-month period show 14.4 million Americans traveling
abroad, not including trips to Canada and Mexico. The nation enjoys
unprecedented affluence, but its cities are beset by crime and drugs.
   When war came, ``millions of people were itching to get to
work,'' said Beaumont. ``The war gave them a chance to get to
work.'' Many of the millions were women. When peace returned, many
kept on working. The Census Bureau says 11,178,000 women 14 and
older were employed in 1939. In 1989, counting only those 16 and
older, the figure is 52,997,000.
   In world affairs, an America that had been reluctant to get
involved emerged from the war to find itself a superpower confronted
by another. In Korea, in Vietnam, in the Middle East, in Europe, it
would be involved as never before.
   Television signals bouncing off satellites in space bring live
pictures of turmoil abroad into American living rooms. The radar
screens perfected during World War II to track enemy ships and
planes now catch speeders on the interstate highway system, itself a
legacy of Dwight Eisenhower, World War II general turned president.
   In the popular Futurama exhibit at the New York World's Fair,
architect Norman Bel Geddes predicted an America fueled chiefly by
liquid air. Atomic energy would have only a minor role. The bombs
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki changed all that.
   As the war began, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's isolationist
ambassador to Great Britain, Joseph P. Kennedy, harbored hopes that
his eldest son would enter politics and perhaps become president.
But in the summer of 1944, Lt. Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. was killed when
his Navy plane exploded over the English Channel.
   It would be John F. Kennedy, the ambassador's second son, who
would succeed the wartime hero Eisenhower as president. JFK, whose
father had opposed aid to England and said the war in Europe was not
``our fight,'' would proclaim in his inaugural address that
Americans were ``unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of
those human rights to which this nation has always been committed,
and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.''
   The vision of the United States as a world policeman would come
under attack as the war in Vietnam deepened, and in succeeding years
public opinion polls would show disenchantment with it.
Nevertheless, few believe that America will ever return to the kind
of isolationism that prevailed in the 1930s.
   The change in America, says historian Beaumont, is ``a huge
complex phenomenon, which is almost equivalent to the waves of
immigration that had gone on to settle America from Europe.''
   That's an academic talking. The poet Shapiro, now 75 and writing
his memoirs, puts it more succinctly. Speaking of himself and his
friends in the Baltimore of 1939, he writes:
   ``The war was hanging over their heads like a cobra ready to
strike.''

   ``Rain Man'' (MGM Home Video. VHS-Beta, $79.95. Rated R)
   
   ``Rain Man,'' Barry Levinson's compelling drama about an autistic
savant and his hustler brother, won the Academy Award for best
picture of 1988 by beating out one of the decade's most original and
artistic gems, ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit.''
   Where the innovative and fresh ``Roger Rabbit'' was a movie best
seen on the large screen with Dolby sound, ``Rain Man'' is in many
respects ordinary and more comfortable on the home screen. And
without the star presence of Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise, that's
exactly where the movie would have been launched _ on television.
   Cruise is the slick younger brother who kidnaps his
institutionalized sibling to fight a will. After using him at the
blackjack tables in Las Vegas, he begins to understand his brother,
becomes protective and forges a relationship.
   Hoffman gives an excellent performance as the autistic older
brother who has an uncanny talent for computing numbers, storing
baseball statistics and recalling isolated and esoteric facts, such
as Qantas being the only airline never to have suffered a crash. At
times, though, he comes on like a grown-up Benjamin Braddock (``The
Graduate''), fumbling, troubled, raging.
   Similar performances by Peter Sellers as the illiterate gardener
in ``Being There'' and Cliff Robertson as the retarded genius in
``Charly'' somehow evoked more pathos but tiptoed around the laughs
Levinson managed to squeeze out of the inspired script by Ronald
Bass and Barry Morrow (based on Morrow's story).
   ``Rain Man'' is a nice little movie almost tailor-made for home
video.

   ``I'm Gonna Git You Sucka'' (MGM Home Video. VHS-Beta, $79.95.
Rated PG-13)
   
   Filmmaker Keenan Ivory Wayans was sitting around with a couple of
friends one day laughing about the absurd blaxploitation movies of
the 1970s. Light bulb! Fireworks! An idea.
   And what a jewel of an idea it was _ the enormously funny ``I'm
Gonna Git You Sucka,'' a fast-moving flick that manages to skewer
just about every so-called ``black'' movie ever made.
   ``Sucka'' opens with the death of Junebug Spade, who ``OG's'' or
``over-golds'' _ he wore so many gold chains, necklaces, bracelets
and belts that his face and body were almost obscured.
   ``He was ready to die!'' the preacher says at his funeral.
   Junebug's cleancut brother, Jack, returns from the Army to help
capture those responsible for his brother's death. Assisting Jack
are an aging band of superheros, geriatric Shafts and Superflies
played by Jim Brown, Bernie Casey and Isaac Hayes, who composed the
theme to ``Shaft.''
   John Vernon, the dreaded Dean Wermer of Faber College in ``Animal
House,'' plays the villain Mr. Big. He's the evil person behind the
proliferation of gold chains.
   Wayans has a nice touch for satire, and keeps the pace and
dialogue fast. There also are wonderful, outrageous moments: Watch
for ``The Street Gang Olympics,'' in which rival gangs must best
each other in stripping cars or outrunning Dobermans while carrying
color TVs.

   The Federal Reserve Board will allow Japanese
firms to continue participating in the U.S. government securities
market despite concerns that U.S. investment companies face
discrimination in Japan.
   By a 5-1 vote Monday, the board approved a report that found
Japan had made ``much progress'' in opening its government debt
market to foreign firms.
   A year-old trade law required the Federal Reserve to remove
foreign-owned firms from being ``primary dealers'' if their nations
did not afford ``the same competitive opportunities'' to U.S. firms.
Primary dealers trade government securities with the central bank as
part of its regulation of the economy.

   Efforts to cut the federal deficit to the level
set by law will require decisive action by Congress if $16.2 billion
in automatic spending cuts are to be avoided, President Bush's chief
budget official says.
   Richard G. Darman said Monday in a letter to the president that
the automatic cuts can be avoided if Congress fully implements the
budget agreement worked out with the White House in April.
   Legislation to carry out the agreement will be the chief business

   Industry analysts say that California's plan to
partially deregulate local phone rates could influence other states
that are considering such steps.
   About 30 other states already have moved away from traditional
rate-setting methods to improve efficiency and bring new services to
homes and businesses. Because of the state's size and the research
behind the proposal, the California plan is likely to be examined
closely by states that haven't made major changes, analysts said
Monday.

   Economists believe the Fed is unlikely to make another move on

   BAT Industries PLC Chairman Patrick Sheehy has
rebuffed financier Sir James Goldsmith's offer to negotiate the
terms of his hostile $21 billion bid for the British conglomerate.
   Sheehy on Monday also unveiled his company's defensive strategy,
aimed at persuading shareholders they will profit more by holding on
to their BAT stock than by tendering it to Hoylake Investments Ltd.,
the investor group led by Goldsmith.
   BAT also said Monday its earnings for the quarter ended June 30
rose nearly 22 percent.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board has given Citicorp
permission to more closely coordinate its savings and loan
subsidiaries in California, Illinois and Florida with its banking
operation.
   The central bank, as directed by savings and loan legislation
signed by President Bush on Aug. 9, lifted previous restrictions
Monday that had prevented Citicorp, the nation's largest banking
company, from operating the thrifts ``in tandem'' with its
commercial banks.
   The restrictions were designed to prevent bank holding companies
from buying up S&amp;Ls in states where they would otherwise be
restricted under interstate banking prohibitions from buying
commercial banks.
   But as part of an effort to attract more capital to the thrift
industry, Congress decided to permit bank holding companies for the
first time to buy healthy S&amp;Ls and run them without the operating
restrictions.
   In a related action, the Fed lifted the tandem restriction
imposed on Michigan National Corp.'s operation of Beverly Hills
Federal Savings Bank.
   Citicorp and Michigan National were the only two bank holding
companies that owned thrifts subject to the restriction.

<HEAD>Steinhardt Partners Has 6.9 Percent of Eastern Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group headed by New York financier Michael H.
Steinhardt disclosed that it has a 6.9 percent stake in the junior
preferred stock of strikebound Eastern Airlines.
   According to a filing Monday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the stake in Eastern's $3.12 cumulative junior preferred
stock is split among Steinhardt Partners, a New York limited
partnership, and two British Virgin Islands corporations.
   Preferred stock has a fixed, and usually guaranteed, dividend and
has priority over common stock in the event of liquidation of
assets, such as after a bankruptcy. But preferred stock usually has
no voting rights.
   Junior preferred is a lesser class of preferred stock that is
subordinate in the payment of dividends.
   Miami-based Eastern has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection since March 9, five days after the start of a strike
against the carrier. Eastern, whose common stock is owned by Texas
Air Corp., is seeking to reorganize at two-thirds its size before
the walkout.
   Steinhardt Partners owns 71,737 shares, or 3.1 percent of
Eastern's preferred; SP International owns 79,520 shares, or 3.4
percent; and GamCan Limited owns 8,504 shares, or 0.37 percent of
the preferred shares outstanding, according to the filing.
   Under SEC rules, ``Michael H. Steinhardt may be deemed to own
beneficially the shares of preferred stock owned'' by all three
which ``constitute approximately 6.9 percent of the shares
outstanding,'' according to the filing document.
   Steinhardt Parners purchased 23,982 shares at $11 per share for a
total of $215,600 between May 19 and August 16, the filing stated.
   During that same period, SP International purchased 26,270, also
for $11 per share, or $234,300 total, and GamCan Ltd. bought 3,109
shares at between $10.80 and $11 per share, for a total of $28,580.
   The filing, an amendment to one filed in April, did not specify
the purpose of the stock purchases.

   Patricia Diaz Dennis says she will resign her
seat on the Federal Communications Commission on Sept. 30 to return
to private law practice.
   Dennis, a Democrat, said Monday she will join the Washington law
firm of Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue as partner and chairwoman of its
communications section. She said she had asked President Bush not to
consider her for reappointment to the FCC, a post she has held since
June 1986.
   Dennis' three-year term expired June 30, and she was not
renominated by Bush during the last two months, when he offered
three new commissioners for Senate confirmation.
   She had made no secret that she was job-hunting and had announced
earlier that she would not take part in the telephone proceedings
that involved Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue or MCI Communications Corp.
   She also had been mentioned as a possible candidate to head the
bureau of international communications and information policy at the
State Department.
   Prior to joining the FCC, Dennis, 42, was a member of the
National Labor Relations Board from May 1983 to June 1986. From June
1979 to May 1983, she was an assistant general attorney with
American Broadcasting Co.'s department of labor relations and legal
affairs.
   Dennis' departure will give the five-member commission its only
vacancy. New FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes was sworn in earlier this
month and Commissioner Sherrie Marshall was sworn in Monday by
Commissioner James Quello, a Democrat who will remain.
   Andrew Barrett has been confirmed by the Senate and awaits
swearing-in.

<HEAD>California Rate-Change Plan Could Be Influential Elsewhere</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California, often a trend-setter, could influence
the way other states set local phone rates by moving ahead with its
plan for partial rate decontrol, analysts say.
   The California plan is designed to speed up rate decisions while
giving phone companies an incentive to cut costs and introduce new
services. State regulators will vote on it next month.
   The state's size, the thoroughness of its 350-page plan and its
reputation as a source of new ideas all could help make its
rate-setting proposal a model for other states, say analysts.
   ``In a way, California was embarrassed a few years ago because
other states had started moving in this direction and it hadn't,''
Robert Morris III, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. in San
Francisco, said Monday. ``But there's a benefit in being late in
that they've been able to pick and choose from what the other states
have done.''
   Vermont and Nebraska have almost totally deregulated local phone
rates, while states such as Florida, Iowa and New Jersey have
introduced some free-market features to their rate-setting
mechanisms. Texas, at the other extreme, still has a conventional
rate-of-return system. Massachusetts and Illinois are exploring
changes now, Morris said.
   In all, about 30 states have taken at least small steps away from
traditional rate-setting methods, at least in small ways. New York
is planning to take another look at a modified rate-setting method
that has not worked as intended, said Eli Noam, a member of New
York's Public Service Commission.
   A proposal by an administrative law judge that was made last week
to California's Public Utilities Commission combines features of
plans that have been tried elsewhere at the state and national
level. The commission is expected to approve the plan, possibly with
modifications, next month.
   The plan represents a compromise among the state regulatory
staff, consumer advocates and the state's two biggest phone
companies, Pacific Bell and GTE California.
   The plan would give the two phone companies a profit incentive to
be efficient by allowing them to keep half the profits they make
above a benchmark 12.75 percent rate of return on assets. Above a
16.75 percent return, all profits would go back to ratepayers.
   In traditional rate-setting methods, all profits above the
benchmark go back to ratepayers. That has tended to discourage
efficiency and encourage ``gold-plating'' _ spending excessively to
increase the asset base and thus increase total allowable profits.
   The plan assumes that phone companies will be able to achieve 4
percent improvements in productivity each year, so that if the
inflation rate were zero they would be required to cut rates by 4
percent. If inflation hit 5 percent, they would be allowed a 1
percent rate increase.
   That is a higher standard than the 3 percent imposed by the
Federal Communications Comission on American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co. earlier this year when AT&amp;T was given a price-cap rate-setting
mechanism.
   Still, it is lower than the 6 percent standard some California
consumer advocates had sought.
   The 4 percent productivity standard is tough but probably
achievable, officials of San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis Group,
the parent of Pacific Bell, told security analysts Monday at a New
York briefing.
   ``That is definitely a hurdle. It will definitely create
challenges for management and the company,'' Executive Vice
President Gary McBee said.
   ``There are a lot of people who are nervous about 4 percent,''
McBee said later in an interview.
   ``If California's economy stays as strong as it's been we ought
to be able to manage that as long as we manage our business well,''
George F. Schmitt, vice president for state regulatory affairs, said
in an interview. ``I don't like it but I don't know what the heck to
do about it.''
   In addition to pricing flexibility, Pacific Bell would be given
the right to spend more than $400 million to replace outdated
switches that relay calls. One switch in Mojave, Calif., was
installed in 1934, Schmitt said.
   ``This is what we consider a real win-win decision for all the
major parties,'' said Lap Lee, a Salomon Brothers Inc. analyst.
   If it really is win-win it is bound to be copied by other states,
where the issue of phone rates is lose-lose politically.
   ``There are a lot of regulatory bodies that would like to get out
of the pervasive regulation business,'' said Peter Bernstein, a
senior analyst at Probe Research Inc. in Cedar Knolls, N.J.

<HEAD>Japanese Drug Maker Launches Lyphomed Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ROCKS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese pharmaceutical maker that owns 30
percent of Lyphomed Inc. has launched a $649 million takeover bid
for the drug maker, which has suffered quality-control problems but
gained fame for its drug used to treat AIDS-related pneumonia.
   Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals Co. has offered $31 per share for the
stock of the suburban Rosemont-based drug company it does not own,
Lyphomed announced Monday.
   Industry analysts said the move would give Fujisawa the largest
U.S. presence of any Japanese drug maker.
   ``This gives (Fujisawa) a better-trained sales force and
increases their visibility'' in the United States, said Leonard
Yaffe, a health care analyst with Montgomery Securities in San
Francisco. ``It makes a ton of sense.''
   John N. Kapoor, Lyphomed's chairman and founder, has agreed to
sell his 14 percent stake in the generic drug company to the suitor
if Lyphomed's board approves the deal, a company said.
   ``Fujisawa has been a (stock)holder for a long time,'' Lyphomed
spokeswoman Melissa Marsden said. ``We have had a friendly
relationship with them and we have some projects under joint
development.''
   News of Fujisawa's offer sent Lyphomed stock soaring $7.75 a
share to close at $30.25 Monday in heavy over-the-counter trading.
   Fujisawa has owned 30 percent of Lyphomed _ about 9 million of
the company's 29.9 million outstanding shares _ since October 1986,
Ms. Marsden said.
   But an agreement with Lyphomed requires board approval if
Fujisawa, based in Osaka, Japan, wants to buy more than 30.1 percent
of the stock before Jan. 11, 1991.
   The offer was presented to Lyphomed over the weekend, Ms. Marsden
said. She said Lyphomed was consulting with financial advisers and
considering the proposal.
   The company rose to national prominence for its sales of
pentamidine, a drug used to treat AIDS-related pneumonia. Company
sales soared from $4 million in 1981 to $172 million in 1987.
   But quality-control violations discovered by the federal Food and
Drug Administration at several Lyphomed plants soured the company's
financial performance, and Lyphomed lost $21.1 million in 1988.
   Lyphomed has since shuffled top management and Ms. Marsden said
the proposed buyout was not connected with Lyphomed's troubles.
   For the first six months of 1989, Lyphomed posted a profit of
$105,000 on revenue of $71.7 million.
   Meanwhile, Lyphomed said Monday that the FDA had approved
production at the company's plant in Canovanas, Puerto Rico.
Lyphomed plans to manufacture pentamidine, antibiotics and
cardiovascular drugs there.
   Tetsuro Nuki, chief executive of Fujisawa-SmithKline Corp., a
wholly-owned, Philadelphia-based subsidiary of the Japanese company,
said Fujisawa was not concerned about Lyphomed's quality control.
   ``Fujisawa believes Lyphomed has already cleared up that issue,''
Nuki said. ``We don't see any problem at this point.''
   Fujisawa had sales of $1.56 billion in 1988, Ms. Marsden said.
   Michael Harshbarger, an industry analyst at Hayes and Griffith, a
Chicago firm that specializes in health-care investments, said that
with the support of Kapoor, who shepherded the company through its
success, it was unlikely the Lyphomed board would reject the deal.
   Harshbarger said the deal would give Fujisawa the largest U.S.
presence of any Japanese pharmaceutical company.
   ``I think it's part of Fujisawa's overall strategic plan _ they
want to become the first Japanese company to stake out a major part
of the U.S. market,'' Harshbarger said.

<HEAD>Industry Pushed To Pollute Less By Using Less Toxic Material</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM KRATTENMAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRIDGEPORT, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Though the Monsanto Chemical Co. plant
here sports a new device to ``scrub'' pollutants from its emissions,
company officials say that's not enough to reach their goal of a 90
percent reduction in air discharges.
   Monsanto, like a growing number of companies, says it now must
concentrate on reducing pollutants before they come out of its
plants by using and producing less toxic materials in the first
place.
   ``This is the wave of the future, the whole notion of preventing
pollution rather than continually seeing ourselves in the position
of having to clean it up,'' said Margie Alt, toxics program director
for the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group.
   Massachusetts and Oregon passed laws last month requiring
industries to work to reduce the amount of toxic chemicals they use.
Similar bills are being pushed in the legislatures of California and
New Jersey.
   The challenge, says Greenpeace toxics campaign director Dave
Rapaport, ``is not disposal, but how not to generate waste in the
first place.''
   Noting that waste reduction makes good economic sense in a time
of soaring disposal costs, companies like Monsanto say they're
already doing the best they can to use and make less hazardous
materials.
   Monsanto has declared a goal of reducing air emissions by 90
percent by 1992 and solid waste by 70 percent by 1995. Du Pont
quickly followed suit, announcing its own ambitious waste reduction
goals.
   It is the idea of mandatory, government-ordered steps that irks
the petrochemical plants that line the Delaware River south of
Philadelphia.
   Chemists and plant managers are wary of legislators forcing them
to tinker with the delicate reactions and processes that produce
everything from pharmaceuticals to vinyl floor coverings.
   The Monsanto Bridgeport plant makes ``plasticizers,'' basic
building blocks for a host of products. They are made from benzyl
chloride, the fruit of a chemical reaction between toluene and
chlorine, hazardous substances that are mixed in a vacuum chamber in
precise amounts.
   Besides the desired product, the process yields an unwanted toxic
residue.
   ``Believe me, we've been working very hard to reduce that,'' said
Donald Hoegel, a Monsanto environmental specialist. ``We really
don't want to make it. ... But it's very hard not to.''
   So far, Monsanto chemists haven't figured out a way. Yet under a
bill pending in the New Jersey Legislature, the state would not
accept no for an answer anymore. The proposal would force the
state's industries to reduce their use of hazardous materials and
production of hazardous waste by 50 percent over five years.
   The California Legislature, meanwhile, is considering a bill to
require industries to develop source-reduction plans. To help,
legislators propose establishment of a hazardous waste reduction
institute in the state's university system.
   The Massachusetts bill passed with one-sided votes after a rare
bit of cooperation between the environmental community and a
business coalition.
   ``There are a lot of companies that want to get ahead of
environmental issues and not just react to them,'' said Jim Segal, a
lawyer and former state legislator who represented the business
coalition.
   But at the Monsanto plant here _ which produces less than one
unit of waste for every 100 units of product _ reducing toxic
byproducts by half in a few years could prove impossible, Hoegel
says.
   ``It's very hard to dictate a fixed number for reduction because
it's very much dependent on the chemical process itself,'' he said.
``If you're already very efficient, to get that extra little bit out
may be absolutely infeasible.''
   In the case of pharmaceutical makers, all-important U.S. Food and
Drug Administration approval hinges on a product's precise
chemistry. Altering the process to make less waste may harmfully
alter the product, said Hal Bozarth, a lobbyist for New Jersey's
powerful chemical industry.
   But environmental leaders in New Jersey say it isn't good enough
to trust industry's pace or good intentions.
   ``It's great that some companies out there are pursuing (toxics
reduction) aggressively, but without legislation there's no way
you're going to make this happen in a comprehensive manner,'' said
Lincoln Bormann, environmental advocate for New Jersey PIRG.
   Bormann says it's hardly a coincidence that shellfish from the
industry-heavy lower Delaware are unfit for human consumption.
Decades of industrial discharges have left sediments laden with
chemicals and altered the mix of plants and animals in the river.
   ``While Monsanto may be setting a goal, there are a lot of
companies that aren't,'' he said. ``I think the fact New Jersey has
the worst water quality in the country speaks for itself.''

   The U.S. dollar firmed against most foreign
currencies in early European trading today in the absence of any
major market-moving news.
   Gold prices were steady.
   Foreign currency dealers said they expected the dollar to
continue trading in a narrow range in the near term.
   ``The market will be dominated by technical trading strategies,''
one trader in Rome predicted.
   ``I expect a few days of quiet consolidation,'' said another.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.57 yen to a closing 142.78 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 143.15 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.9593 West German marks, up from 1.9520; 1.6885
Swiss francs, up from 1.6810; 6.6115 French francs, up from 6.5805;
2.2056 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2070; 1,403.50 Italian lire, up

   In London, the dollar eased slightly. It cost $1.5750 to buy one
pound, compared with $1.5745 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at $366.40 a troy ounce, compared with late
Monday's $366.25. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $366.
   The bid price in Zurich was also $366, unchanged from late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 1 cent to close at $366.90.
   Silver was quoted in London at $5.23 a troy ounce, down from

   The U.S. dollar dipped against the Japanese yen
today for the second consecutive day while share prices fell
marginally on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 142.78 yen, down 0.57 yen from Monday's
close of 143.35 yen. After opening at 142.78 yen, it ranged between
142.70 and 142.87 yen. The dollar had fallen 0.17 yen on Monday.
   Currency dealers said today's trading was light and stayed in a
narrow range as many market players still were on vacation.
   ``Because of the lack of market-affecting incentives, players
find it difficult to take positions,'' said a dealer at the Bank of
Tokyo.
   Dealers said players also were awaiting a meeting of the U.S.

issues, which gained 77.69 points Monday, fell 26.48 points, or 0.08
percent, closing at 35,114.35.
   Securities dealers said trading was light, with first section
volume estimated at 450 million shares.
   A dealer at Nikko Securities Co. said a 40.97-point decline in
the Dow Jones Stock Average during Monday's New York trading
discouraged institutional investors from activity in the market.
   Shares of Victor Co. of Japan, however, were actively bought

<HEAD>Philly and Amex Exchanges Restrict Trading in `Stock Baskets'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Philadelphia and American exchanges have
limited trading on their new ``stock basket'' products while
denouncing a Chicago federal court ruling that has thrown the
products' legitimacy into question.
   ``The real loser in this controversy is the American investor,''
said Kenneth Leibler, president of the American Stock Exchange.
   The exchanges began offering stock baskets to investors three
months ago.
   Philadelphia Stock Exchange President Nicholas A. Giordano said
the Friday decision by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was ``a
major step backward in the regulation and development of innovative
new products.''
   Stock baskets are financial innovations priced to reflect changes
in broad market indexes such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index. Investors receive quarterly cash payments equal to a
proportionate share of any regular cash dividend declared on the
stocks in the index.
   The exchanges said trading in stock baskets would be largely
restricted to liquidation, meaning holders would be able to sell
them for cash. Market makers at the exchanges are obligated to buy
them if no other buyers emerge, ensuring an orderly market and
preventing panic selling.
   The uncertainty over stock baskets was raised Friday by the
Chicago court, which ruled that such products resemble commodity
futures, such as those for pork bellies and grain, and should be
monitored by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, not the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The Philadelphia and American exchanges began trading May 12 on
stock baskets after receiving approval from the SEC.
   The Philadelphia exchange calls its product a Cash Index
Participation and the Amex calls its product an Equity Index
Participation.
   The Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
had asked the SEC to delay trading on the baskets, saying they were
thinly disguised stock index futures that must be approved by the
CFTC.
   When the SEC refused, the two futures exchanges appealed the
decision to the 7th Circuit Court, which agreed with them.
   The SEC said in a statement it had not had a chance to review the
decision and thus had no comment.
   A CFTC spokesman said in a statement: ``We believed that they
were futures contracts when they were initially submitted, and we
are pleased to find the court agrees with our interpretation.''
   The New York Stock Exchange is planning to introduce its own
basket, but NYSE spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin predicted it would not be
affected by the appeals court ruling.
   ``Our product is very different from theirs,'' she said. ``The
index participation baskets only represented an index of stocks.
With ours, you are actually buying the stocks themselves and there
is actual ownership.''
   The basket, known as the Exchange Stock Portfolio, is still
awaiting SEC approval but the exchange hopes to begin offering it
around the end of September, Ms. Gamsin said.
   The Philadelphia exchange is exploring what strategy to take as a
result of the court's decision, Giordano said, but he predicted
federal legislation would be needed to resolve the question.
   ``The real loser here is the individual investor for whom Cash
Index Participants were originally designed,'' Giordano said.
   ``The regulation of CIPs as futures would dramatically diminish
their potential distribution to individual investors and effectively
nullify their potential to allow individuals to compete in financial
markets dominated by institutions,'' Giordano said.

<HEAD>Kroger Denies Claim the Grocer Knowingly Sold Tainted Juice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kroger Co., one of the nation's largest
supermarket chains, has denied a television report's claim that it
knowingly sold adulterated orange juice produced by a Chicago
company.
   CBS News reported Monday that a series of Kroger memos from 1979
to 1982 indicate the company continued to sell as 100 percent pure
orange juice a product bought from Bodine's Inc. despite laboratory
tests showing the juice was tainted.
   A federal grand jury in Chicago indicted two former owners and a
top executive of the now-defunct Bodine's July 25 on charges the
company sold orange juice concentrate from 1978 to 1985 that
contained waste water and illegal additives such as beet sugar.
   Kroger spokesman Paul Bernish denied that the grocer knowingly
sold the adulterated juice, and said Kroger repeatedly sought and
received written quality assurances from Bodine's.
   Bernish said the Chicago indictment would show that Bodine's
``lied to its customers, including Kroger, and provided explanations
that satisfied us but, seen in retrospect, were part of a pattern of
apparent deception that was used against us.''
   Cincinnati-based Kroger owns supermarkets, convenience stores and
food-processing plants in 32 states. Bernish said Kroger sold
Bodine's orange juice from 1979 to 1985 under the grocery chain's
Cost Cutter and Avondale brand names.
   The U.S. attorney's office in Chicago said consumers who drank
the orange juice were not at risk because of the additives, but one
person suffered a negative reaction to the sugar in a can of juice.
   Bernish said a federal grand jury in Cincinnati has convened to
investigate the case.
   CBS said a series of Kroger memos from company employees
recommended the grocer stop using Bodine's juice because of the
impurities. But Kroger continued to sell it because Bodine's charged
less than market price, saving the grocer $2 million annually,
according to the broadcast.
   Bernish said the company bought Bodine's orange juice because the
company charged less than other generic suppliers. He said Kroger
asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to test the orange
juice, but the FDA reported there were no tests that could confirm
the product's purity.
   Bernish said that after the company developed its own tests for
orange juice, it discovered ``results that seemed to be a problem.''
   After the tests and the 1983 discovery of excessive preservatives
in some juice, Kroger sought and received written guarantees of
purity from Bodine's, Bernish said.
   The broadcast quoted a Kroger lawyer it did not identify as
saying Kroger ignored the warnings from its own laboratories and the
Florida Department of Citrus that said Bodine's orange juice wasn't
pure. Instead, Kroger cited independent tests that said the juice
was pure, according to CBS.
   Bernish declined to comment on the unidentified lawyer's comments.

<TEXT>
   Bingo, once a quaint game played in church
basements and fraternal clubs, has become such a big business in
North Dakota that one city has started cracking down on bingo
parlors.
   Bingo is the fastest growing of a variety of games of chance that
the state has allowed charitable organizations to run in the past
decade. But there is some concern that gaming has encouraged
problems ranging from cheating and theft to excessive gambling.
   The bingo action attracts players like Merrlyn Meland, a
58-year-old widow from Moorhead, Minn., just across the state line
from Fargo. She comes to Fargo three or four times a week for the
prospect of big money, prizes and companionship.
   ``I think a lot of it is just to get away from the house,'' she
said during a recent session. ``I can't stand being around that
place. I have to get out where there's people.''
   Meland finds plenty of company at Big Top and Prairie Public
Broadcasting, which operate the largest of Fargo's five bustling
bingo parlors.
   Prairie Public, the network for the state's public radio and
television stations, has had as many as 490 people playing in its
modern facility, which sports electronic scoreboards and video
monitors. Prairie Public uses the funds from its gambling operations
to run its broadcasting operations.
   Bingo, raffles and pull tabs _ a paper simulation of a slot
machine _ were the first games introduced 12 years ago after North
Dakota allowed gambling for charitable purposes.
   Since then, sports pools, parimutuel horse racing, blackjack,
poker and video poker have been legalized. Ironically, voters have
rejected a proposed lottery.
   In June, 327 organizations held gambling licenses at 576 sites
across the state. State regulations list more than 100 ways
charitable gambling proceeds may be used, including broad categories
of educational, religious and fraternal activities. Eligible uses
also include a category called ``other.''
   Among the organizations supported by bingo or other gambling
revenues are Bishop Ryan High School in Minot, a Roman Catholic
school; the Red River Dance and Performing Company in Fargo; and the
Souris Valley Humane Society.
   Overall, gamblers wagered a record $205 million last year, with
$18 million going to charitable groups. The state also gets a cut,
with taxes ranging up to 15 percent of revenues and sales tax
charged on bingo cards and some other gaming items.
   The revenue is welcome in a state with a troubled farm economy.
But there are also worries that gambling has brought other problems
to the state.
   Recently, the Grand Forks City Council voted to limit the number
of bingo parlors.
   ``Bingo, in fact, is large gambling, and gambling is not like any
other business,'' Councilwoman Gwen Crawford said.
   Social problems are evident in the number of groups like Gamblers
Anonymous, said Nicholas Spaeth, the state's attorney general.
   ``Ten years ago, you couldn't open up a newspaper in the state
and find such a group,'' he said. ``But now there isn't a major city
in the state that doesn't have one.''
   Cheating and theft also have been a problem, although how much
goes on is hard to determine, Spaeth said.
   Still, bingo is still accepted in most places outside of Grand
Forks.
   Charities operating the games don't express any qualms that they
may be encouraging excessive gambling. Spaeth said he expects the
bingo business _ which grew 28 percent in 1988 to a total of $41.1
million _ to keep growing.
   ``It's the lure of the big jackpot that draws people in,'' he
said.
   Prairie Public, the biggest bingo operator with revenues of
nearly $8.5 million last year, offers nightly prizes that include a
car and a $20,000 payout to anyone who blacks out a card in 50
numbers or fewer.
   Players can call 24-hour bingo hotlines that give a rundown of
the day's biggest prize offerings.
   Meland's winnings have included a $1,300 prize and a trip to Las
Vegas.
   ``It's fun to win, but I'm not like some people who are hooked on
it,'' she said.
   Bingo is nearly a 24-hour activity at Big Top, run by the Plains
Art Museum in Moorhead.
   Six days a week it offers a morning brunch bingo, two afternoon
matinees, evening and moonlight sessions and, on weekends,
``red-eye'' bingo that runs until 4 a.m., said Sue Haaland, the
museum's gambling manager.
   ``I find a parking lot of a bingo facility rather interesting,''
Haaland said. ``You see everything from Fords to Saabs in most lots.
We have people from all socioeconomic groups playing.''
   The large number of halls in Fargo is a good thing, Haaland said.
   ``It's absolutely great for the bingo player,'' she said. ``And I
believe the competition has been good for the organizations, too. It
keeps them sharp and makes us all run a good, honest game.''

<HEAD>Dealer Profits Continue Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hot, five-year car and truck selling pace has
not stemmed the decline in profits for U.S. dealerships, and 10
percent of them may be out of business next year, the National
Automobile Dealers Association says.
   NADA said Monday in a report received in Detroit profits have
dropped from 2.4 percent of total dealership sales in 1984 to 1.7
percent last year. The report forecast a continuing trend.
   ``The steady decline in dealership profits concerns all dealers,
especially in light of the record profits the manufacturers have had
in recent years,'' NADA President Ron Tonkin said.
   However, General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. last month
reported their second-quarter earnings were down 3.4 percent and
15.4 percent, respectively, compared with the second quarter of
1988. Chrysler Corp. profits were 6.6 percent higher than the
quarter last year.
   The NADA, which represents 20,000 businesses holding more than
41,000 separate car and truck franchises, forecast a decline in the
number of dealerships in the next two years.
   The study said some large, highly leveraged dealerships in
metropolitan areas have gone out of business, and ``NADA expects
more such failures to occur in the near term.''
   The declining profitability of dealerships comes amid forecasts
of a weaker car and truck selling market ahead. Each of the Big
Three automakers has estimated vehicle sales for this year to be
around 1 million units fewer than last year's 15.8 million, the
second-best year in history.
   The NADA originally forecast sales of 15 million cars and trucks
for 1989, but has reduced that to 14.5 million.
   The report said dealership parts departments showed an increase
in profits, but other aspects of the business, including new vehicle
sales and service, showed falling profits.

   Stock prices weakened in early trading today
after dropping in the previous session by the biggest amount in
nearly two months.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 6.26 to 2,640.74
in the first half-hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers more than 2 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 288 up, 646 down and
548 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.72 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Matching the decline in stock prices was weakness in the bond
market, where the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was off 3-16
point, or nearly $2 per $1,000 in face value.
   New factory orders for durable goods fell a seasonally adjusted
1.9 percent in July, the Commerce Department said. Bond prices
briefly rose in reaction to the report, since a weak economy holds
down inflation, the enemy of fixed-income securities. But traders
began to focus on an upward revision in June durable goods orders,
to 1.4 percent from 0.4 percent, and bond prices fell.
   In early trading on the NYSE, Navistar was down [ at 4}. American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph was down { at 37}, BankAmerica was unchanged
at 30~, Baxter Travenol was down \ at 23}, and General Electric was
down { at 56.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
0.31 to 189.66. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 0.56 at 376.02.
   On Monday the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 40.97
points to 2,647.00, for its biggest one-day loss since it dropped
46.47 points on June 29.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 3 to 1 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 371 up, 1,164 down and 423 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 136.80 million shares, against 145.81

   HAL Inc. stock declined further in early trading
today on the news that investors including former baseball
commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth would buy control of the parent
company of troubled Hawaiian Airlines for far less than the market
price.
   HAL's board of directors unanimously accepted a tender offer of
$22 a share from the group headed by J. Thomas Talbot, a former
airline executive from Newport Beach, Calif. Investors include
Ueberroth and his brother, John.
   Last spring, Talbot and Peter Ueberroth headed a group that
unsuccessfully bid $464 million for strikebound Eastern Airlines.
   HAL stock was down 87{ cents at $24.37{ a share in early American
Stock Exchange trading today. The stock, which has been boosted in
recent months by takeover rumors, fell $6.37{ a share on Monday in
heavy trading.
   A source close to the deal, who asked not to be identified, said
Talbot and Peter Ueberroth were equal partners in the buyout and
that Talbot would likely become chief executive officer and
Ueberroth co-chairman of the company.
   The group plans to buy at least 51 percent of HAL's stock. At $22
a share, it could purchase a majority of the company's 1.95 million
outstanding shares of common stock for about $21.9 million.
   Honolulu stockbroker Randy Havre of J.B. Havre Securities Inc.
said the offer was reasonable and estimated the stock's true value
at $15 to $20 a share.
   ``The bottom line is the employees are going to win on this
because they're getting new management which will reduce the
instability caused by financial losses over the past few years,''
said Havre.
   John H. Magoon Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of HAL,
owns about 57 percent of the company. An airline spokesman said
Monday that Magoon would sell enough of his shares to ensure the
deal, but he was expected to stay on as chairman or co-chairman.
   HAL lost $13 million in the first half of this year and has lost
a total of $30.6 million over the past 2{ years.
   Last year, a subsidiary of Japan Air Lines paid almost $20
million for a 20 percent stake in the company.
   In a critical article in June, Forbes magazine blamed Magoon for
the airlines' poor performance during an economic boom, saying he
``has managed to run the state's leading carrier almost into the
ground.''
   Hawaiian consistently has ranked among the industry's leaders in
consumer complaints compiled by the U.S. Department of
Transportation.
   Last week, John Ueberroth witnessed such discontent when his Los
Angeles-bound Hawaiian flight departed four hours late, sources said.
   Talbot acknowledged the airline's problems but said his group
would solve them by infusing the company with capital to buy better
planes and equipment.
   The investors, who were attracted by the airline's routes in the
Pacific Basin, also said they would boost Hawaiian's image by
improving and expanding service and sticking to schedules, he said.
   ``Performance is the key and making sure we operate on timely
schedules will be a top priority,'' he said. ``These changes won't
happen overnight, but they will happen.''
   The 60-year-old airline is the state's largest inter-island
carrier. It also serves Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Las
Vegas, Alaska, Australia, New Zealand, American Samoa, Guam, Tahiti
and other Pacific points. Its 31 planes carried 5.5 million
passengers last year.
   After graduating from San Jose State College in California in
1959, Ueberroth worked here for Trans International Airlines as an
operations manager and vice president through 1962.
   He has earned a reputation in professional baseball and as head
of the Olympics for turning problem enterprises into moneymakers.
   The tender offer must clear several hurdles, including the
airlines' unions, several government agencies and the company's
shareholders, HAL said.

inflation among bond investors. Although orders fell a seasonally

   Anchor Glass Container Corp. said today its
board of directors rejected as inadequate a $280 million takeover
bid from Vitro SA.
   Anchor also said it was exploring alternatives to the unsolicited
$20-per-share offer from the Mexican manufacturer.
   Anchor, the country's second-largest glass maker behind Corning
Glass Works, said the board's unanimous decision to reject the Vitro
offer was based in part on an opinion from its financial adviser,
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc.
   The board also adopted a ``poison pill'' shareholder rights plan
that would make a hostile takeover of the company prohibitively
expensive.
   The plan provides for Anchor stockholders to buy additional
shares at a steep discount, driving up the cost of a buyout.
   Anchor Chairman Vincent J. Naimoli, in a letter to shareholders,
said the plan was intended to protect the interests of stockholders
in light of the Vitro offer.
   It was not intended to prevent an acquisition of the company that
would be in shareholders' best interests, he said.
   Vitro has called Anchor a struggling company that cannot control
its future and claimed Anchor's plants needed upgrading. Anchor
denied Vitro's claims.
   Vitro has said it wants to merge Anchor with its Latchford Glass
Co. of Huntington Park, Calif.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Lower On Rainy Weather</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures were mostly lower in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, largely in
response to badly needed rain in some critical growing areas of the
Midwest.
   Some stations in central Illinois reported an inch or more of
rain since Monday morning.
   Analysts said the U.S. corn crop is nearly finished and not
likely to be altered by changes in the weather.
   But the soybean crop is still in its sensitive pollination phase,
when moisture is essential.
   ``You can still add five bushels an acre with good rain at this
time of year,'' said Gerald Zusel, manager of Board of Trade floor
operations for Balfour Maclaine Corp., a commodities brokerage firm.
   A National Weather Service six-to-10-day outlook issued Monday
predicted above-normal rainfall in the Midwest in the early part of
next week.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.89 a bushel; corn was \
cent lower to { cent higher with September at $2.34{ a bushel; oats
were \ cent to } cent lower with September at $1.38 a bushel;
soybeans were 1 cent to 3 cents lower with the August contract,
which expires today, at $6.25 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mixed in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .20 cent lower with September at
74.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent lower to .08 cent
higher with August at 84.20 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent
lower to .08 cent higher with October at 40.60 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .15 cent to .20 cent higher with August at 26.95
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled lower on Monday.

inflation among bond investors. Although orders fell a seasonally
adjusted 1.9 percent in July, they were up a revised 1.4 percent in
June. In addition, the widely watched category of non-defense

<HEAD>Michter's Files For Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEBANON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's oldest operating distillery has
filed for bankruptcy court protection, apparently thwarting an
attempt by a bank seeking to recover 585,000 gallons of whiskey it
owns.
   Michter's Distillery, owned by Aquarii Holding Co. of Delaware
and its subsidiary, Pennsylvania Sour Mash Distilleries Inc., filed
on Friday for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy
Act. That section of the law frees the company from creditors'
lawsuits until it can develop a plan to put its finances in order.
   The action came three days before before the company was
scheduled to appear Monday in Lebanon County Common Pleas Court for
a hearing on a dispute with Commonwealth National Bank over more
than 6,000 barrels of whiskey.
   The bank, which loaned $4.8 million to the distillery's former
owner, T.D. Veru, seized the whiskey and other assets when that
company declared bankruptcy.
   In 1987, the bank sold the distillery to Aquarii but retained
ownership of the rye, corn, bourbon and sour-mash whiskey, valued at
$842,000. A dispute over insurance for the whiskey caused the
company to ban the bank from the distillery.
   The bank later agreed to insure the whiskey and pay nearly
$62,000 in back taxes, but the distillery would not allow the bank
to remove or sample the liquor until the tax was paid.
   The bank was trying to negotiate with the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms to reduce the tax.
   Under a court order in June, the bank was allowed to sample the
whiskey, which remains stored at the distillery.
   Michter's was established in 1753 and continues to operate.

<NOTE>Japanese Set Sail for Graves on Soviet-Held Island</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of 46 Japanese set sail Tuesday to visit the
graves of their ancestors on a Soviet-held island off northern
Japan, an official said.
   It was the first grave visit in 19 years by Japanese to Kunashiri
Island, one of Japan's ``northern territories,'' said Hirotoshi
Kawata, an official in the city of Nemuro.
   The visits were suspended in 1970 partly because of a Soviet
requirement that Japanese obtain Soviet visas before traveling
there, Kawata said.
   The issue of the Kuril islands has been a major stumbling block
in relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, with Japan claiming
sovereignty over them and Moscow saying a dispute does not exist.
The problem has prevented the countries from concluding a peace
treaty formally terminating their hostilities in World War II.
   The visit to Kunashiri came after then Foreign Minister Sousuke
Uno and Soviet officials agreed in May that Japanese be allowed to
go to the Soviet-held island without visas or passports, Kawata said.
   About 17,000 Japanese lived on the northern islands, including
7,300 on Kunashiri, before they were forced to leave when Soviet
forces took over in 1945.
   The group will land at Yuzhnokurilsk, a port on Kunashiri, to
hold a memorial service for their ancestors, and return home
Wednesday, Kawata said.
   Another group of Japanese will make a four-day grave visit to the
islands of Shiotan, Taraku and Shibotru, all small islands near
Kunashiri, beginning Thursday, Kawata said.

<TEXT>
   Farm machinery-maker Deere &amp; Co. on Tuesday
reported a 21 percent rise in net income for the third quarter of
its fiscal year, reflecting strong sales across all its product
lines.
   Deere said its net income totaled $98.2 million, or $1.30 a
share, for the three months ended July 31, compared with $81
million, or $1.11 a share, for the same period a year ago.
   The 1988 results included a one-time gain of $8.7 million from
tax benefits, Deere said in a news release.
   The company's third-quarter sales to dealers totaled $1.7 billion
versus $1.4 billion for the third period of 1988.
   Chairman Robert A. Hanson said retail sales of John Deere
agricultural equipment were much stronger in the third quarter,
continuing a pattern established in the first and second quarters.
   Hanson also noted increased retail sales of Deere's lawn and
grounds-care products in the third quarter, reversing a trend of
declining sales set in the previous two quarters.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Deere reported net
income of $277 million, or $3.69 a share, an 18 percent improvement
over net income of $234.9 million, or $3.25 a share, for the first
nine months of fiscal 1988.
   Revenue for the first three quarters totaled $4.5 billion,
compared with $3.9 billion for the same period a year ago.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar declined in late European trading
Tuesday, pressured by a few large sell orders in a thin market and
the West German mark's strength against the Japanese yen.
   Gold prices rose.
   Currency dealers said news that U.S. durable goods fell 1.9
percent in July, a larger-than-expected rate, and big sell orders
depressed the dollar. The dollar also was hurt by the mark's rise
against the yen, they said.
   The dollar was quoted at 1.9410 West German marks, down from
1.9520 marks late Monday.
   ``The 1.95-mark level was a big chart point,'' said one dealer.
``When the dollar broke through that level it triggered a lot of
stop-loss orders which pushed it lower.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.57 yen to 142.78 yen. It closed lower in London at
142.52 yen.
   In London, it cost $1.5840 to buy one pound late Tuesday, a gain
for the British currency from late Monday's rate of $1.5745.
   Other late dollars rates compared with late Monday: 1.6730 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6810; 6.5555 French francs, down from 6.5805;
2.2035 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2070; 1.1742 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.1744; and 1,403.00 Italian lire, unchanged.
   Gold settled in London at a bid price $366.75 a troy ounce, up 50
cents from Monday's late price. The bid price in Zurich was also
$366.40 an ounce, up from $366.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 1 cent to close at $366.90 an
ounce.
   Silver settled at $5.24 a troy ounce in London, equaling Monday's
rate.

<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency began
filing lawsuits today in nearly a dozen states against demolition
companies that allegedly failed to take proper precautions while
working on asbestos-ridden buildings.
   Civil lawsuits were filed by the Justice Department in eight
cities and additional court papers were expected to be filed later
in the day naming a total of 34 defendants in connection with
violations of asbestos removal requirements, the EPA said.
   ``Today's coast-to-coast effort to punish violators is a message
to those who ignore the law,'' said Henry Habicht, EPA deputy
administrator. ``Asbestos is a known cause of cancer in humans, and
it can be a killer.''
   Habicht said the agency intends to enforce requirements for
safety measures when dealing with asbestos removal by seeking civil
penalties from companies that do not comply with the safeguards.
Fines could range up to $25,000 for each violation.
   The EPA officials declined to name all the defendants until the
court papers were filed. The eight lawsuits filed today involved
work on school buildings in Missouri, Kansas and Washington state as
well as various buildings from warehouses to restaurants in
Virginia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Nevada.
   Papers also were being prepared for civil action involving work
on at least 80 school buildings in New York City, officials said.
   Federal law requires certain precautions when removing asbestos
from buildings so that its microscopic fibers are not spread through
the air. Violators can be subject to up to $25,000 fine per
violation and face criminal prosecution in some cases.
   The inhalation of asbestos fibers is known to cause lung cancer,
asbestosis, a scarring of the lung, and mesothelioma, a cancer of
the chest and abdomen. Asbestos was used in past years in insulation
and other building materials.
   Improper removal practices pose health risks to construction
workers and people who return to the building or to other nearby
buildings since asbestos particles often linger in the air for a
long time, EPA officials said.
   The EPA estimates that up to half of all asbestos-involved
renovations may be done without the precautions required by the
federal Clean Air Act.
   The EPA officials said none of the new actions involves criminal
charges, but that civil penalties in some of the cases could be over
$250,000.
   Agency sources, who asked not to be identified by name, said
papers were also to be filed later in the day as a result of
violations in New York, California and Florida.
   The projects cited include work on at least 80 New York City
school buildings; public schools in Woodinville and Kent, Wash.; a
high school in Kansas City, Mo.; a junior high school in Holyrood,
Kan.; and colleges in Pittsburg, Kan., and Berea, Ohio.
   In one case, a contractor was being cited for transporting wine
tanks by helicopter from a winery in San Jose, Calif., without
removing asbestos insulation pads, causing asbestos particles to
scatter over miles of countryside.
   Other cases involved a Nevada casino; an apartment building in
Philadelphia; a boiler room at the Marine Corps base at Quantico,
Va.; the Seattle-Tacoma Airport, and two Seattle restaurants.
   The EPA crackdown comes only weeks after a Harvard University
study indicated that in many cases the improper removal of asbestos
from buildings may pose more of a health risk than leaving the
material in the building.
   The study by Harvard's Energy and Environmental Policy Center
suggested that if precautions are not taken the ``removal of
asbestos may actually increase exposure to building occupants'' as
well as workers involved in the renovation.
   The EPA has estimated that more than 730,000 commercial buildings
in the country still contain some asbestos material. Last year it
received about 50,000 notifications of renovation projects involving
asbestos, and that number is expected to increase by about 30
percent this year, according to agency officials.
   By law, the EPA must be notified when renovation or demolitions
involve buildings containing asbestos.

   Share prices ended lower, and sharply below session
highs, Tuesday on the London Stock Exchange as a weak opening on
Wall Street undermined the London market.
   The market opened lower following Wall Street's sharp decline
Monday, rallied around midday as several key stocks attracted
investor interest, and then slid back into negative territory as
Wall Street opened weaker.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended down 3.9
points, or 0.2 percent, at 2,370.8, down from a session high of
2,385.2. The index opened at its low of 2,361.5, a loss of 13.2
points.
   Dealers said, however, that the retreat occurred in thin trading,
and didn't reflect significant profit-taking.
   Volume totaled 391.6 million shares, up from 349.7 million traded
on Monday.
   ``The market is still very short of stock,'' one dealer said.
``Although private clients are sticking to the sidelines, most
institutions are still on the lookout for a good, reasonably priced
line of stock.''
   The Financial Times 30-share index ended down 2.7 points at
1,966.3. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 2.93 points to
1,330.64.
   At the London close, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was

   A late flurry of technically inspired buying
pushed most grain and soybean futures prices to a higher close
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Most of the action was in the soybean complex following the
expiration at noon of the contracts for August delivery of soybeans,
soybean meal and soybean oil, analysts said.
   Some traders sold the August contracts and bought those for
September, October or November delivery. The result was a sharp drop
in the August price and strong rallies in most of the later-delivery
contracts.
   Reports of badly needed rain in critical crop-growing areas had
sparked selling of soybean and corn futures at the opening of the
session but those markets closed with substantial gains.
   Buying of soybean futures accelerated when the November
contract's price surpassed the Monday session's high of $5.92 a
bushel.
   August soybeans went off the board at $6.06 a bushel, 22 cents

<TEXT>
   Warner Bros., already soaring on fees for
merchandise from the movie ``Batman,'' is teaming up with pro
baseball in a licensing deal for Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Sylvester
the Cat and other ``Looney Tunes'' characters.
   LCA Entertainment, Warners' licensing unit, announced Monday it
has entered into a joint venture that will pair the characters with
the 26 major league teams' trademarks.
   Looney Tunes baseball garb is expected to be in stores by the
first of the year, with toys and novelty gifts soon after that.
   Generally, the joint venture is to receive a royalty of between 9
percent and 12 percent on licensed merchandise, with the 26 teams
dividing baseball's share equally.
   Richard White, head of major league baseball properties, said the
idea sounds like a hit.
   ``We're combining two American icons with this campaign,'' White
said. ``There's no limit where it could go.''
   LCA has been flying high this summer with ``Batman'' merchandise.
The products, sold through 150 licensees, are producing hundreds of
millions of dollars in retail sales.
   ``You can't compare this program to `Batman,''' said Karine
Joret, manager of marketing for LCA. ``We hope it will be as big,
but we don't expect it.''
   Warner Bros. is a division of Warner Communications Inc., which
is in the process of merging with Time Inc. After their combination
is completed, the company will be known as Time Warner Inc.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC said Tuesday that starting Labor Day weekend
it will try to sell its new fall prime-time lineup at Sears, Roebuck
and Co. through an ambitious publicity campaign also geared toward
boosting sales at the nation's No. 1 retailer.
   The month-long joint program, which was first disclosed last
spring, is seen by industry experts as an important step by the
television networks in halting the erosion of audiences to cable,
independent TV outlets and video tapes.
   CBS and K mart Corp. announced a similar arrangement in May.
   The networks provide air time for the retailers and their
products in exchange for help in publicizing TV programs to a wide
range of retail customers. Both the NBC and CBS promotions include
contests.
   Network executives hope the promotions will encourage people to
tune in to the shows at least once, and possibly become regular
viewers.
   ``It really uses the strength of both,'' John Miller, senior vice
president for NBC Entertainment, said of the network-retail tie-in.
``What we're trying to do is make people aware of the new shows and
interested in the new shows.
   ``This gives us broad-based reach, which is very important.''
   NBC, CBS and ABC _ the three major networks _ claimed only 67
percent of the audience in prime time during the 1988-89 TV season,
down from 70 percent in the 1987-88 season and 92 percent a decade
ago.
   NBC's ``America's Brightest Stars: NBC, Sears and You''
promotion, which begins Sept. 3 and will continue for the next four
weeks, attempts to entice viewers and advertisers to five new TV
series through a combination of games, store displays,
advertisements and direct mail.
   In the past, the networks touted their new shows mainly by
running promotional spots on their own network or placing ads in
newspaper TV listings. Last year NBC ventured into other marketing
techniques by including its fall schedule on some cereal boxes.
   NBC says it will begin traditional promos on Wednesday, and take
those a step further by running ``prommercials'' on closed-circuit
sets at Sear's 850 retail stores next month.
   Chicago-based Sears will also insert an eight-page brochure about
NBC's shows in its catalog and in bills to its 20 million
charge-card customers.
   Sears said it hopes to increase sales and store traffic, now at
around 2.2 million people daily, as a result of the contest and
joint publicity effort.
   Included in the promotion is a weekly sweepstakes beginning Sept.
3 that offers winners, among other things, a small part on one of
the new prime-time NBC series: ``Baywatch,'' ``Hardball,'' ``Mancuso
FBI,'' ``Sister Kate'' and ``Nutt House.''
   Contestants must answer questions about NBC programs in a
questionnaire that will appear in Sears advertising supplements.
   Those playing the CBS game will have to watch specific shows to
see if they have won, while those participating in NBC's contest
will be able to find the answers in the advertising supplement
itself.
   Continental Airlines, a subsidiary of Houston-based Texas Air
Corp., will also provide round-trip tickets to Hollywood, Calif., to
the NBC grand prize winners, in addition to 300 pairs of tickets to

   Stock prices were mixed today after dropping in
Monday's session by the biggest amount in nearly two months.
   Wall Street appeared to be following the bond market, where
interest-rate worries sent the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
down 23-32 point, or more than $7 per $1,000 in face value.
   Weighing on the bond market was a Commerce Department on durable
goods orders that was interpreted by bond investors as an indication
of healthy economic growth. Strong growth is often accompanied by
inflation, which hurts bond prices.
   Although durable orders fell a seasonally adjusted 1.9 percent in
July, they were up a revised 1.4 percent in June. In addition, the
widely watched category of non-defense capital goods was up 5
percent in July after a 5.1 percent rise in June.
   A late rally brought the market roughly even after having been
down nearly the entire session.

   The dollar fell sharply Tuesday against most key
currencies in thin, nervous trading, pressured by concern that West
Germany's central bank could be raising interest rates soon.
   Gold prices also slipped after gaining overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed 50 cents lower at $367.90 a troy ounce. Republic
National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at $366.25 an
ounce, down 10 cents from Monday. Currency dealers said speculation
that the West German Bundesbank plans to boost interest rates at a
regular meeting later this week sent the dollar tumbling against the
mark. In both U.S. and European trading, the dollar slipped below
the psychologically important 1.95-mark level.
   ``The 1.95-mark level was a big chart point,'' explained one
dealer in Europe. ``When the dollar broke through that level it
triggered a lot of stop-loss orders which pushed it lower.''
   Higher interest rates tend to support a currency partly because
they make securities denominated in that currency more attractive to
foreigners.
   Trevor Woodland, chief corporate trader for Harris Trust &amp; Co. in
Chicago, said the dollar also was depressed by a drop in the stock
and bond markets. But he said the dollar showed little reaction to a
government report showing durable good orders tumbled 1.9 percent in
July to the lowest level in nine months.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.57 Japanese yen to 142.78 yen. It closed at 142.52
yen in London, and at 142.145 yen in New York, down from 143.05 yen
late Monday.
   The pound rose in London and in New York. It cost $1.5840 to buy
one pound in London, up from late Monday's $1.5745. Sterling fetched
$1.5891 in New York, up from $1.5717.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday,
included: 1.9398 West German marks, down from 1.9570; 1.6720 Swiss
francs, down from 1.68625; 6.65125 French francs, up from 6.5980;
1.1735 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1746; and 1,389.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,400.50.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday, included:
1.9410 West German marks, down from 1.9520; 1.6730 Swiss francs,
down from 1.6810; 6.5555 French francs, down from 6.5805; 2.2035
Dutch guilders, down from 2.2070; 1.1742 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1744; and 1,403.00 Italian lire, unchanged.
   Gold settled in London at $366.75 an ounce, up 50 cents from
Monday's late price. The bid price in Zurich, Switzerland, was
$366.40 an ounce, up from $366.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 1 cent to close at $366.90 an
ounce.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery fell to $5.221 a troy ounce from $5.227 Monday.
Silver settled at $5.24 an ounce in London, unchanged from Monday.

   Stock prices pulled out of a skid with a late
rally Tuesday, ending roughly even one day after the biggest decline
in nearly two months.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished up 3.99 at
2,650.99 after having been down roughly 20 points in late-morning
trading. Other indicators were mixed.
   Tuesday at first appeared to be a repeat of Monday's decline,
when the Dow Jones industrials fell 40.97 points. But stocks rose
from their bottoms around noon, leveled off, and then erased all
their losses with a spurt of program trading in the final hour.
   Traders said there was no major news to account for either the
early decline or the late recovery. Although stocks were dragged
down initially by weakness in the bond market, they climbed back
even though bonds remained weak.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was off about $7 per $1,000
in face value at the time Wall Street went home.
   The stock market is stalled short of the 1987 all-time high of
2,722.42 on the Dow Jones industrials by the doldrums in the bond
market, said Lincoln Anderson, a Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. economist.
   ``The bond market is interpreting everything negatively. I don't
know what you could give the bond market right now that would turn
it around in the short run,'' Anderson said.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
629 up, 835 down and 538 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 141.93 million
shares, up from 136.80 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 171.11 million shares.
   Strong gains by two Dow Jones industrials components led the
average higher: Philip Morris rose 2 to 157 and International Paper
gained 2] to 55\.
   Georgia Gulf leaped 7| to 58~, exceeding the $55-a-share offer
for the company by Harold Simmons' NL Industries. It was the most
active NYSE issue, with composite volume of 2.6 million shares.
   Anchor Glass Container closed unchanged at 20. The Tampa,
Fla.-based company rejected a $20-a-share takeover offer from
Mexico's Vitro SA, and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. said it holds a 9.7
percent stake in the company.
   Lyphomed led the over-the-counter stocks in trading volume,
unchanged at 30\. Japan's Fujisawa Pharmaceutical has offered $31 a
share for the generic drug maker.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $2.43 billion, or 0.07
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.14 to 190.11.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.95 to 390.50, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index rose 0.52 to 341.19.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
0.03 to 458.36. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index fell 0.72 to 375.86.

<HEAD>Georgia Gulf Gets Stock `Enhancement' Plans From Simmons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas billionaire Harold Simmons, through one of
his holdings, has contacted the head of Georgia Gulf Corp.,
suggesting a variety of moves that could ``enhance'' the value of
the Atlanta company's stock, of which Simmons owns almost 10 percent.
   Georgia Gulf stock jumped $6 a share following the release of the
letter Tuesday, but analysts said the correspondence was vague and
shed little light on the Texan's intentions.
   The letter, dated Monday, was signed by J. Landis Martin,
president and chief executive officer of Houston-based NL Industries
Inc., a chemical and oil service company acquired by Simmons last
year. It was released in Atlanta by Georgia Gulf.
   Georgia Gulf officials declined to comment on the letter, saying
in a statement ``it would be given appropriate consideration in due
course.''
   Simmons owns 2.3 million shares of Georgia Gulf, a chemical and
polymer spinoff of Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific Corp. In a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month,
Simmons said his interest in the company was ``no longer held solely
for the purpose of investment.''
   The SEC filing set off speculation that Simmons might launch a
takeover bid and kept Georgia Gulf's stock price rising. Two months
ago, the price was $35 a share; it closed Tuesday at $58.75 on the
New York Stock Exchange, up $7.25.
   ``We believe that the value of Georgia Gulf's common shares would
be enhanced by a transaction in which shareholders receive $55 per
share in cash,'' said the letter to James R. Kuse, chairman of
Georgia Gulf.
   ``Such a transaction might take the form of a leveraged
recapitalization, merger or other transaction. In our present view,
Georgia Gulf's foreseeable cash flow could service the amount of
debt required to fund such a transaction as well as fund needed
capital expenditures,'' the letter read.
   Martin said NL Industries was ready to participate in such a
transaction, for example, by contributing its existing holdings to
fund a new equity base.
   ``I see it as just another pressure tactic,'' said John Garcia,
an analyst with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. in New York. ``There's
nothing concrete in the statement. He's not saying he's going to buy
the company.''
   Because no offer has been made, Garcia said, Georgia Gulf doesn't
have to respond. A possible move, however, might be for Georgia Gulf
to establish an employee stock ownership plan to fend off a hostile
takeover attempt, he said.
   Analysts previously have said a takeover is unlikely without the
consent of Georgia Gulf management because the company's managers
own 25 million shares and the company has little debt.
   Simmons has built a fortune estimated at more than $1.6 billion
by buying and selling major corporations. His holding company,
Dallas-based Valhi Inc., had 1988 sales of $2.25 billion. He got NL
Industries in a $1 billion deal, his largest, last year.
   Georgia Gulf, created in 1985 by Georgia-Pacific, had 1988 sales
of $1.06 billion.

<HEAD>Sugar Futures Surge On Rumored Indian Buying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sugar futures prices rose sharply Tuesday amid rumors that India
had made a long-expected purchase of refined white sugar on the
world market to partly offset its projected shortfall of nearly 1
million metric tons.
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures finished mostly
higher while livestock, oil and precious-metal futures were mixed.
   Sugar futures settled .42 cent to .60 cent higher on New York's
Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange with the contract for delivery in
October at 13.95 cents a pound.
   World sugar stocks are so low, due to several years of poor
sugar-cane crops and steadily rising consumption, that any hint of
new purchases by large-scale consumers like India, China or the
Soviet Union tends to throw the market into a bullish frenzy.
   There was no confirmation of Tuesday's rumor, which began on the
United Terminal Sugar Market in London.
   Analysts said Indian buying had been expected for months. India's
government recently approved emergency funds to buy refined white
sugar, known as ``whites'' in the trade, to offset an expected
shortfall of nearly 1 million metric tons.
   ``They're talking 200,000 to 300,000 tons,'' said analyst Kim
Badenhop of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. ``They may just take
that tonnage in one clip, and the whites situation is so tight that
it's really going to have an impact on prices.''
   But another analyst, Harry Schwartz of Cargill Investor Services
Inc. in New York, said the India rumor had surfaced only to justify
heavy computer-based buying by commodity funds.
   He conceded that supply and demand factors pointed to higher
prices but contended that Tuesday's buying was triggered by the
market's failure on Monday to significantly extend the sharp losses
registered Friday.
   ``When the market lacked this followthrough, it found itself in
an oversold condition and buy-stops today propelled the advance,''
Schwartz said.
   A late flurry of technically-inspired buying pushed most grain
and soybean futures higher on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Most of the action was in the soybean complex following the
expiration at noon of the contracts for August delivery of soybeans,
soybean meal and soybean oil, analysts said.
   August soybeans went off the board at $6.06 a bushel, 22 cents
lower than Monday's settlement prices.
   Wheat settled \ cent lower to { cent higher with September at
$3.90{ a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 4 cents higher with September
at $2.38\ a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 2\ cents higher with
September at $1.41 a bushel; soybeans, excluding August, were 6{
cents lower to 9 cents higher with September at $6.03 a bushel.
   Most cattle futures prices rose on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in line with higher spot-market prices for fed cattle. Hog
futures were mixed while pork-belly futures advanced on expectations
of stronger demand for bacon.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .35 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in September at 74.10 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .02 cent lower to .15 cent higher with August at 84.20
cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent lower to .25 cent higher with
October at 40.65 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .02 cent to
1.08 cents higher with August at 26.82 cents a pound.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled unchanged to 12
cents higher in lackluster trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, where the September contract expired at $19.08 a barrel
and the October contract climbed 5 cents to $18.69. Heating oil
settled .03 cent to .13 cent lower with September at 51.79 cents a
gallon; unleaded gasoline was .46 cent to .76 cent higher with
September at 53.58 cents a gallon.
   Gold finished unchanged to 50 cents lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange with August at $367.90 a troy ounce; silver was 0.3 cent to
0.8 cent lower with September at $5.235 a troy ounce.

<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices ended mixed Tuesday in
uneventful trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The September contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, closed flat at $19.08 a barrel, unchanged
from Monday, despite the final day of trading on the contract.
Contracts for delivery later in the year posted slight gains.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasoline
for September delivery rose 0.76 cent to 53.58 cents a gallon. Other
contracts had smaller advances.
   Domestic heating oil for September slipped 0.10 cent to 51.79
cents a gallon and later contract months also declined.
   Traders said that except for two brief buying spurts, one early
and another shortly before the closing bell, activity was slow with
products leading the way.
   Crude for September delivery dipped to $18.88 during the session,
but strong selling in the gasoline market helped recover some of the
losses.
   ``Strength in gasoline helped hold up crude,'' said Jack Unger,
energy broker with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   Analysts said anticipation of a drop in U.S. gasoline stocks
helped boost prices. The American Petroleum Institute releases
weekly inventory statistics on crude and refined products after the
close of trading on Tuesday.
   Traders expect a rise in heating oil stocks and only minimal
changes in crude supplies, Unger said.

<HEAD>Mazda Shows Three New Models for '90, Plans Brand ID Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOUTHFIELD, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mazda Motor Corp. on Tuesday introduced
three new 1990-model cars, two of them subcompacts, and unveiled an
advertising campaign aimed at making the Japanese automaker's name
more recognizable to U.S. buyers.
   The new models include the 929 S, which basically is the same as
Mazda's flagship 929 sedan but with a 190 horsepower engine,
compared with the 158 horsepower engine in the standard 929.
   The more powerful engine will add $1,500 to the 929 base price of
$23,300. The 929's base price for 1989 is $20,900.
   Mazda also introduced two new subcompacts, a restyled 323
Hatchback and the 323 Protege sedan. Mazda will keep the 323
designation in front of the Protege for a year then drop it. The 323
Hatchback's base price is $6,599, the same as in 1989, and the
Protege's is $9,339.
   In other product news, Mazda said it was offering a
four-wheel-drive version of its MPV minivan and would begin building
1990 models of its 626 sedan at its plant in Flat Rock, south of
Detroit. Mazda also makes its MX-6 coupe and the Ford Probe at the
plant.
   By the time 626 production at Flat Rock reaches full production
of 54,000 cars a year, that plant will produce most of the 80,000 or
so 626 cars it expects to sell in the United States next year.
   That gives the company more room in its import quota for the
Miata two-seat, convertible sports car, which has met with heavy
demand. The company plans to import 40,000 of the cars a year,
although it doesn't plan to boost availability in the United States.
   Mazda began a new series of brand-identification advertisements
earlier this month and will show off its 1990 cars and trucks in
another series of ads beginning in September, said George McCabe,
deputy general manager and group vice president for sales of Mazda's
U.S. marketing arm.
   ``Compared with Honda and Toyota, Mazda consistently trails in
the areas of brand image and brand familiarity,'' McCabe said. ``Our
image is generally positive, yet it is not nearly as well defined as
Honda's or Toyota's.''
   He said the campaign would focus on a new theme involving the
Japanese concept of ``kansei engineering,'' or incorporating a
driver's five senses into design and engineering of a car.
   The company's new advertising slogan will be ``It just feels
right.''
   Separately, a Mazda executive said the company is exploring
development of a second dealer network to market luxury cars as
Honda Motor Co. has done with Acura.
   This fall, Toyota Motor Corp. will deliver Lexus cars to a second
dealer network and Nissan Motor Corp. plans the same with its
Infiniti line.
   Yoshinori Taura, president of Mazda Motor of America, said his
company is studying what Honda, Toyota and Nissan are doing, but a
target date hasn't been set for deciding whether Mazda would develop
another dealer channel for luxury cars.

<HEAD>Request Delay of Federal Court Decision on `Stock Basket' Securities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Stock Exchange said Tuesday it had
asked a federal appeals court to delay an order that would halt
trading in a new type of security that is based on the value of
broad stock market indexes.
   Amex spokesman Robert Shabazian said the exchange made the
request partly to give investors who have bought these securities,
known as ``stock baskets,'' more time to liquidate them for cash.
   A ruling Friday by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago
threw into question the legitimacy of stock baskets, which have been
traded on the Amex, Philadelphia Stock Exchange and Chicago Board
Options Exchange for three months.
   Agreeing with a complaint brought by the Chicago futures
industry, the court ruled that the securities resemble futures
contracts, not stocks. As such they should be regulated by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission and not the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which originally sanctioned them.
   The American and Philadelphia exchanges denounced the court's
decision, saying it reflected a jurisdictional dispute between two
federal regulatory agencies and inevitably would harm small
investors for whom the baskets were designed.
   Baskets are priced to reflect changes in indexes such as the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials. Investors receive quarterly cash payments equal to a
proportionate share of any regular cash dividend declared on the
stocks in the index.
   The appeals court gave holders of stock baskets until Sept. 8 to
liquidate their positions.
   But the Amex, in its request for a delay of that deadline, said
late September was a more logical deadline time, because it would
permit holders to receive a regularly scheduled dividend payment
Sept. 15 and give the Amex time to complete the settlement process.
   Shabazian said it was too early to say whether the Amex would
join the Philadelphia exchange in appealing the federal court ruling.
   He said 229,000 baskets were traded Tuesday on the Amex, compared
with 817,000 Friday, and it didn't appear that investors were
rushing to dump them.

<HEAD>Anchor Board Rejects Takeover Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anchor Glass Container Corp. said Tuesday its
board of directors has recommended that shareholders reject a $280
million buyout offer from Vitro SA of Monterey, Mexico.
   The recommendation came after the board rejected a $20-a-share
takeover bid from the Mexican manufacturer, saying it wasn't in the
best interest of the shareholders.
   Anchor, the nation's No. 2 glass maker after Corning Glass Works,
said the board's decision was based in part on an opinion from its
financial advisor, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc., which called the Vitro
offer financially inadequate.
   Vitro said it had offered a good price.
   ``We believe that the price we are offering shareholders is full
and fair,'' the company said in a statement. ``Market analysts have
uniformly concluded that the $20 price is not only fair but
generous.''
   The Mexican company said Anchor's stock was trading at a price
below $10 a share the week before its offer was made.
   In a related development, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., a New York
investment banking company, has bought 9.7 percent of Anchor stock,
raising speculation of a possible bidding war for the glass company.
   According to a report filed Monday with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Goldman, Sachs paid $26.6 million or $19.70 a
share for Anchor common stock from Aug. 9 through Aug. 14. The
report said the purchase, which started the day Vitro announced its
offer, was for ``investment purposes only.''
   But Goldman, Sachs said it will continually evaluate Anchor and
reserves the right to change its plans.
   ``I think they've left the door more open than a typical passive
investor would,'' said Greg Corso, an attorney for the SEC's
tender-offers office in Washington.
   Anchor said its board also has instructed management to work with
the company's legal and financial advisors to explore and
investigate a ``variety of alternative courses of action intended to
maximize stockholder values.''
   Vitro, which holds 10.3 percent of Anchor's stock, had called
Anchor a struggling company that could not control its future and
claimed that Anchor's plants needed upgrading.
   The Mexican company, which intended to merge Anchor and Latchford
Glass Co. of Huntington Park, Calif., had already chosen Latchford
President Clifford L. Jones to head the merged operations.
   Vitro said Tuesday that it saw ``no sign that Anchor's management
can reverse the deteriorating situation.
   ``Anchor's board claims to be exploring alternatives, including
the payment of a special dividend,'' Vitro said. ``But Anchor has
previously stated that it cannot pay any dividends because of
covenants in its debt agreements.''
   Anchor said the board has unanimously adopted a shareholder
rights plan, which it said was similar to defensive plans adopted by
many other publicly traded companies.
   The plan provides for preferred stock-purchase rights which will
be distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share
of common stock held as of the close of business on Sept. 1, 1989.
   In a letter to Anchor shareholders, Vincent J. Naimoli, chairman,
president and chief executive officer, said the plan is intended to
protect the interests of shareholders in light of the Vitro offer.
   It is not ``intended to prevent an acquisition of the company
pursuant to an offer for all outstanding common stock on terms that
are in the best interests of all stockholders and it will not be
used for that purpose,'' Naimoli added.
   Vitro said it may reconsider its proposal.
   ``Giving this deteriorating financial condition and the Anchor
board's apparent intent to try to block our offer,'' Vitro
``reserves its right to reevaluate its offer if it is delayed in
consummating the transaction,'' the company said in a statement.

<DATELINE>LEBANON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's oldest operating distillery has
filed for protection under federal bankruptcy law, apparently
stalling an attempt by a bank seeking to recover 6,000 barrels of
whiskey it owns.
   Michter's Distillery's filing under Chapter 11 of the Federal
Bankruptcy Act on Friday came just days before before the company
was scheduled to appear in Lebanon County Court for a hearing on the
liquor dispute with Commonwealth National Bank.
   That hearing, scheduled for Monday, was stayed by the filing.
Chapter 11 frees a company from creditors' lawsuits until it can
develop a plan to put its finances in order.
   The contested whiskey was seized with other assets by the bank
after Michter's former owner, T.D. Veru, declared bankruptcy; the
bank had loaned Veru $4.8 million.
   In 1987, the bank sold the distillery to its present owner _
Aquarii Holding Co. of Delaware and a subsidiary _ but retained
ownership of the 585,000 gallons of rye, corn, bourbon and sour-mash
whiskey, valued at $842,000.
   The company banned the bank from the distillery after a
disagreement over insurance. Under a court order in June, the bank
was allowed to sample the whiskey, which remains stored at the
distillery.
   ``We own the whiskey. I don't think there is a whole lot of
dispute about that. But what we're going to do at this point, we're
not really sure,'' said James Nealon III, an attorney for the bank.
   Nealon said he planned to meet with bank officials later this
week.
   Michter's officials declined to comment.
   A distillery has been operated at the Michter's site since 1753.

   Losses by the nation's savings institutions
rose to $3.7 billion in the April-June quarter, the worst in a year,
regulators said Tuesday. They warned that the red ink won't end soon
despite enactment of a multibillion-dollar industry bailout.
   The second quarter loss was up from $3.5 billion in the first
three months of 1989 and was the worst since the record $4.1 billion
in the same period of last year, the Office of Thrift Supervision
said.
   For the first half of the year, losses were mounting at a rate
that could make 1989 the worst year for the savings industry since
the Depression, topping 1988's record of $13.4 billion.
   The law signed Aug. 9 by President Bush is intended to end the
hemorrhaging by shutting down failed thrifts or selling them to new
owners. Eventually, the legislation, which will pump $50 billion
into S&amp;Ls over the next 26 months, should put the industry on an
even keel, but not right away, warned James R. Barth, chief
economist of the thrift office.
   ``You should not expect losses to instantly go away because of
the signing,'' Barth said, adding, ``I would not be totally
suprised'' to see no improvement in the industry's earnings in the
quarter ending Sept. 30.
   As in the past, losses were concentrated in Texas, but for the
first time California and Arizona rivaled the oil-producing states
in Southwest, which have been plagued for several years by bank and
S&amp;L failures.
   Texas losses totaled $1.3 billion, a little more than a third of
the $3.5 billion in red ink recorded in the state during the same
period a year ago.
   California thrifts lost $950 million, the second-worst total in
the nation, a sharp turnaround from profits of $126.7 million a year
ago. They were followed by Arizona S&amp;Ls, which lost $515 million, a
marked deterioration from the $58 million loss a year ago.
   Barth said thrifts nationwide suffered from rising interest rates
during the second quarter, but the California loss was heavily
influenced by two large institutions which were taken over by
regulators and forced to recognize losses from sour loans.
   Lincoln Savings and Loan Association in Los Angeles posted a $788
million loss, while Gibraltar Savings of Beverly Hills lost $332
million, he said.
   Arizona, meanwhile, is suffering from a severe real estate
downturn.
   Other measures of the industry's health declined as well. The
number of insolvent S&amp;Ls rose from 394 at the end of the first
quarter to 401 at the end of June. Only 68 percent of the nation's
2,934 thrifts earned a profit, down from 73 percent in the first
quarter. Profitable thrifts earned $1.2 billion, which was more than
swamped by $4.9 billion in losses at the other institutions.
   The industry's capital _ the cushion between losses and
government deposit insurance funds _ slipped from 2.89 percent of
loans and other assets to 2.59 percent.
   Barth said the industry's loss rate should improve as the
government closes institutions or finds new owners and the embedded
losses are transferred to the government's books.
   At a separate briefing for reporters, officials of the Resolution
Trust Corp., the new agency created to dispose of failed S&amp;Ls, said
they have already injected $921 million into 11 badly insolvent S&amp;Ls
in an effort to cut interest rates paid on deposits and reduce
losses.
   The agency expects to inject an additional $14 billion to $15
billion by the end of next month, which it estimates will trim the
industry's losses by $500 million a year.
   ``It is a way to instantly cut down the $20 million a day that is
being lost,'' said L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., which is staffing the new agency. ``The
reason institutions are losing money is they are paying more for
their money than they are receiving. That's bad business.''
   Barth said it is clear from S&amp;Ls' balance sheet that the industry
will undergo a massive restructuring under the legislation passed
earlier this month.
   A key requirement of the law is that thrifts raise more capital.
Excluding the 293 most deeply insolvent S&amp;Ls, only half of the
remaining institutions, representing 85 percent of the industry's
assets, meet capital requirements going into effect by the end of
this year, he said.
   He said those institutions will either have to shrink their
operations or find new investors to inject $30 billion in fresh
capital.
   Also, one in four institutions can't meet the new requirement
that they maintain 70 percent of their assets in housing-related
loans. The old standard was 60 percent.
   Thrifts are already moving to meet one requirement of the law, a
prohibition on junk bond ownership taking effect in five years. S&amp;Ls
owned $12.6 billion in junk bonds at the end of June, down from
$14.4 billion three months earlier.

<HEAD>Ice Cream Maker to Campaign Against Hormone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WATERBURY, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ice cream maker famous for its campaigns
to save the rain forests and promote peace has targeted another
issue: the use of hormones to increase milk production in cows.
   Ben and Jerry's Homemade Inc. of Waterbury says it will use 6
million of its ice cream pints to lobby against bovine growth
hormone. The pints will be labeled with a message to ``Stop BGH,
Save Family Farms.''
   News of the campaign prompted officials from Monsanto Co., a lead
developer of the hormone, to fly to Vermont on Tuesday to meet with
company officials.
   ``If the intent of the program is to try to stop the product, I
think it's unfair, it's unfortunate, it's misinformed and
discouraging,'' Montsanto spokesman Lawrence O'Neill said in a
telephone interview from the company's headquarters in St. Louis.
   O'Neill also suggested that Ben &amp; Jerry's not turn its back on a
technology that could potentially help Vermont dairy farmers.
   Bovine growth hormone, which is expected to win federal approval
next year, is a genetically engineered copy of a naturally occurring
protein. When injected in cows, it can increase milk output by up to
15 percent.
   Monsanto, one of four companies developing the hormone, argues
that BGH is a management tool that can help dairy farmers produce
more milk with the same number of cows.
   But many farmers, as well as some industry leaders and
economists, fear that greater milk production will decrease milk
prices paid to farmers and force smaller producers out of business.
   ``We feel it presents a clear threat to the dairy industry as we
know it here in Vermont, and to small-scale, family-based dairy
farming around the country,'' said Ben &amp; Jerry's spokesman Alan
Parker.
   Ben &amp; Jerry's is one of the nation's leading producers of
super-premium ice cream and, consequently, a major purchaser of milk
and cream.
   The 6 million pints have been labeled with the anti-BGH message,
as well as a telephone number, 1-802-BGH-FARM, Parker said. Callers
will hear a recorded message from company founders Ben Cohen and
Jerry Greenfield opposing the hormone technology.
   ``We don't think the big companies that are hoping for big
profits by selling BGH are taking into account the human and social
costs of putting more and more small farms out of business,'' the
recording will say when it begins this fall.
   Cohen and Greenfield also will ask for callers' names and
addresses so that they can send materials about the hormone.
   Parker said the pints will be distributed in more than 35 states
in September and October.
   To help save rain forests, Ben &amp; Jerry's is donating 40 percent
of the profit from its Rainforest Crunch bars to rain forest-based
organizations to protect these areas.
   Last year, Ben &amp; Jerry's launched a campaign to promote peace by
donating 1 percent of the profits from sales of its Peace Pops to a
lobbying effort to have 1 percent of the U.S. military budget spent
on peace promotion.

   The Chicago Board Options Exchange said Tuesday it
had disciplined five people for rules violations stretching back to
May 1984.
   In the most serious case, Davis H. Roenisch Jr., a former
exchange member, was permanently barred from association with any
exchange member for allegedly failing to repay his clearing firm,
First Options of Chicago Inc., a debt of about $189,000 after
selling his membership in 1987.
   Roenisch failed to answer the exchange's allegations and was
deemed by an exchange committee to have admitted the charges.
   James D. Rieker, a former broker for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Rockford, was permanently barred from association with any exchange
member for allegedly failing to pay $15,000 of a $32,500 trading
debt stemming from transactions he made in April 1986, and for
impeding an exchange investigation.
   Rieker did not answer the allegations and was deemed by an
exchange committee to have admitted the charges, the exchange said
in a statement.
   Alan M. Galac, a former broker for Thomson McKinnon Securities
Inc. in Buffalo, N.Y., consented to censure and a three-month
suspension from association with any exchange member for allegedly
making unauthorized trades in a customer's account in 1985. Galac
neither admitted nor denied the rules violation.
   Paul H. Fried, a broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Boston,
was censured and suspended from association with any exchange member
for two years for making unauthorized trades in customers' accounts
in July 1986 and misrepresenting to customers the risks of options
trading. Fried neither admitted nor denied violating exchange rules.
   Akiva Bar, a broker with PaineWebber Inc. in Monterey, Calif.,
consented to a five-year suspension from associating with any
exchange member, a censure and a $10,000 fine for making
unauthorized trades in customers' accounts and various other
offenses beginning in May 1984. Ms. Bar neither admitted nor denied
violating exchange rules.

<HEAD>Arbitrageur Fined in Polaroid Phone Caper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In two hearings Tuesday, a stern Delaware
Supreme Court told lawyers and speculators in the high-stakes
corporate takeover business that the justices will not tolerate
violations of their orders or courtroom rules.
   Saying that sneaking a portable telephone into the courtroom was
``reprehensible,'' the justices found New York lawyer and
arbitrageur Alexander M. Metviner in contempt of court and fined him
$1,000.
   Metviner was accused of lying to the justices about having a
portable telephone in the courtroom during the Shamrock Holdings
Inc. battle for Polaroid Corp.
   In a hearing immediately following, the court dismissed contempt
proceedings against Barbara Robbins, a partner with the New
York-based law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz. The court
said it was convinced she mistakenly released confidential documents
to The New York Times concerning the Paramount Communications Inc.
bid for Time Inc.
   But the court chastised Herbert M. Wachtell, one of the nation's
top corporate lawyers and Robbins' attorney, for not apologizing to
the court for the ``discomfort the mistake caused the court.''
   The newspaper reported the documents had been released by the
Delaware Supreme Court.
   Metviner, who works for Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York, ran afoul
of the court in March when he prematurely left the courtroom after
the justices dealt a major blow to Shamrock Holdings' $3.2 billion
bid for Polaroid. At a March hearing in which Metviner was found in
contempt, he said he had merely ``jumped the gun'' in his effort to
reach his portable telephone hidden in bushes outside the building.
He denied having the phone in the courtroom in violation of court
rules.
   Twenty days later, however, he admitted he had the phone with him
in the courtroom during the entire proceeding.
   Chief Justice Andrew D. Christie told Metviner the dignity of the
court was at stake and ``violations need to be taken seriously.''
   ``We need to send a message to those who act in a very unseemly
way in the courtroom. We need to send a message this will not be
tolerated ... a very strong message,'' Christie said.
   In the Robbins case, the court said it felt a responsibility to
prevent any future mistakes. The justices suggested New York lawyers
consult with Delaware attorneys before releasing documents, or that
they contact lawyers who request confidentiality on behalf of their
clients.

<HEAD>Group Including Goldsmith Buying 25 Percent Of Mexicana Airlines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN WRIGHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A partnership that includes British investor
Sir James Goldsmith and a Mexican investor group are jointly buying
25 percent of Mexico's state-run airline, Mexicana de Aviacion, the
government announced Tuesday.
   The foreign partners, which include Chase Manhattan Bank of New
York and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. _ are pumping in slightly less
than half of the $140 million total investment, with the private
Mexican investors adding the rest, officials said.
   ``So the airline can face its nesessities in the future, it will
need, as does the rest of the sector, significant investment,''
Jacques Rogozinski, head of the Finance Ministry advisory council,
said at a news conference.
   Rogozinski said that within the next two weeks, the government
will release more specific details of the deal. He emphasized that
the $140 million is made up of fresh capital, none of it ``swaps''
for Mexican debt owed to foreign creditors.
   Mexicana has been plagued by cash-flow problems related to its
debt, which totaled $253.6 million at the end of 1988.
   The federal government, which now owns 51 percent of the airline,
will own 40.05 percent under the new plan. Current private investors
will own a maximum of 34.95 percent.
   Mexicana posted a profit of $136.3 million last year on revenues
of $753.2 million. Total capitalization of Mexicana will be $550
million.
   The government envisions an investment of more than $3 billion in
the airline over the next 10 years and adding 21,500 employees to
the airline's current 14,000 workers, Rogozinski said. He said in
the future, the government share of the airline will steadily
decrease, perhaps to zero.
   The Mexican government, saddled with the second-highest foreign
debt among developing countries, $107.4 billion, has liberalized
rules governing foreign investment to attract additional capital.
   Goldsmith is one of Britain's wealthiest investors. He currently
is involved with a group that has launched a hostile takeover of BAT
Industries PLC, a British tobacco-retailing-insurance conglomerate.
   In the past, he has taken control of Crown Zellerbach Corp. and
Diamond International, among others. He also attempted to take over
Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. in 1986.
   Chase Manhattan is the second-largest U.S. commerical bank, while
Drexel Burnham is an investment house.
   Mexicana _ Mexico's largest and oldest airline _ flew 8 million
passengers on 80,000 flights last year, company data show. Of that,
70 percent were domestic flights. Of all flights between Mexico and
the United States, Mexicana accounted for 40 percent of the
passenger traffic, the company says.
   The airline, established as a private business in 1924, was
nationalized in 1982.
   Mexicana's sister airline, Aeronaves de Mexico, or Aeromexico,
was grounded by bankruptcy in April 1988, but has since reorganized
under 65 percent private ownership.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Slightly, Share Prices Rise</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Nikkei morning close, comments.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was up slightly from its opening
against the Japanese yen Wednesday morning, while share prices on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose moderately.
   The dollar started trading at 142.30 yen, and moved in the narrow
range of 142.20 to 142.45 yen. It was changing hands at 142.42 yen
at late morning, down 0.36 yen from Tuesday's close of 142.78 yen.
It closed at 142.13 yen in New York overnight.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which shed 26.48 points Tuesday, won back 63.52 points, or
0.18 percent, to end the morning session at 35,177.87.
   Currency dealers said the dollar opened low following its
downswing Tuesday in New York, but moved slightly upward after
fluctuating in a narrow range.
   ``It was another quiet day in Tokyo,'' said a dealer at the
Daiichi Kangyo Bank, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Most
dealers find it difficult to make substantial moves because of lack
of incentives. Institutional investors are not placing large orders,
either.''
   Dealers also said market participants were looking for the
results of a two-day meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's
open market committee in Washington, which will end Wednesday. Among
topics to be discussed in the committee were interest rates.
   Securities dealers said the stock market also started the day
with light trading and moved in a narrow range because of a lack of
market-affecting incentives.
