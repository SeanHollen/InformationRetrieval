   Authorities issued an arrest warrant for
the tanker captain suspected of drinking before his ship ran
aground, causing a 1,000-square-mile oil slick that expanded
Saturday under shifting wind and currents.
   A prosecutor said the captain admitted drinking on board the
tanker before it went aground, according to court papers obtained
by The Oregonian of Portland newspaper.
   One of the first investigators to board the Exxon Valdez asked
Joseph Hazelwood what the problem was, and the captain replied, ``I
think you're looking at it,'' the newspaper reported in its Sunday
editions.
   Meanwhile, Alaska's governor threatened to close the
Trans-Alaska Pipeline if the oil industry fails to protect against
future spills.
   The bulk of the 10.1-million-gallon slick began moving toward
Cordova about 50 miles southeast of here, threatening the home
waters of fishermen who have struggled to save endangered fish
hatcheries.
   About 800 miles of beach have been tainted so far in the biggest
oil spill in the nation's history, officials said.
   Gov. Steve Cowper said the state will require ``absolute proof
that equipment is in place'' to combat future oil spills. ``If it's
not done, we're authorized to close the pipeline,'' he said.
   Some 85 percent of the state's $2 billion budget comes from the
pipeline, and although the state has a $10 billion savings account,
oil production on Alaska's North slope accounts for 25 percent of
U.S. production.
   Alaska Attorney General Doug Baily said Saturday that criminal
charges were filed late Friday against Hazelwood, 42, captain of
the tanker that crashed into Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound on
March 24.
   Exxon fired Hazelwood on Thursday, the same day the National
Transportation Safety Board revealed blood and urine tests taken
about nine hours after the accident showed he had been under the
influence of alcohol.
   Charges filed in Valdez District Court accuse Hazelwood of
operating a motorcraft while under the influence of alcohol,
reckless endangerment and the negligent discharge of oil, all
misdemeanors.
   The three offenses carry combined maximum sentences of two years
and three months in prison, and fines totaling up to $10,000.
District Attorney Larry Weeks said if convicted, Hazelwood would
have to spend at least 30 days in jail because he has two prior
drunken driving convictions in the past five years.
   Valdez Magistrate Tracee Schnell signed the arrest warrant for
Hazelwood, and set bond at $50,000. Authorities believe he left the
state several days ago, but Baily said the state would seek his
extradition.
   Police in Hazelwood's hometown of Huntington, N.Y., said
Saturday they did not know his whereabouts.
   The Oregonian said two crewmen told authorities they saw
Hazelwood drinking in Valdez before the ship left port.
   A statement filed by Leonard M. Linton, an assistant district
attorney in Valdez, said one crewman saw Hazelwood consume four
alcoholic drinks while still in port.
   Linton's affidavit said two other unidentified witnesses said
they smelled alcohol on Hazelwood's breath when the captain was on
the bridge, the newspaper reported.
   ``One witness said that Hazelwood appeared to be under the
influence of intoxicating beverages and that his balance was not
good,'' Linton said in the affidavit.
   However, all crewmen interviewed by Alaska state troopers have
said Hazelwood ``did not appear to be intoxicated,'' Linton wrote.
   Hazelwood apparently told investigators he drank one beer before
leaving port and a couple of bottles of ``moussy,'' a beverage
containing 0.5 percent alcohol, after he returned to the ship,
Linton said.
   FBI officials in Washington say they're investigating possible
felony violations of the Clean Water Act, which prohibits the
``negligent discharge of a pollutant into navigable waters.''
   Exxon is liable for millions of dollars in fines under state law
if it is proven to be negligent in causing the spill and cleaning
it up.
   Shifting wind drove the main body of the slick east toward
Hinchenbrook Island, which forms the primary boundary between the
sound and the Gulf of Alaska.
   The movement of the oil toward the rich fishing grounds at the
mouth of the Copper River stirred fear in Cordova, which lies on
the east side of the sound. Some Cordova fishermen, who had mounted
a bold effort to protect the hatcheries on the west side, headed
back toward their home port to battle the oil there.
   Larry Dietrick of the Alaska Department of Environmental
Conservation praised the Cordova fishermen as the ``backbone'' of
the cleanup and containment effort so far.
   Leaders in the fishing and tourist town of Seward, the first
community downstream from Prince William Sound to the west, also
went on the offensive, deploying 10,000 feet of boom the town
ordered from a Massachusetts manufacturer to protect salmon river
habitats.
   ``We're not going to let it happen,'' said Harry Gieseler, mayor
of the town 125 miles southwest of Valdez. ``We're taking our own
initiative.''
   At the Kenai Fjords National Park, near Seward, a team was sent
out to survey wildlife and evaluate the state of the park before
oil reaches the rocky shores, spokeswoman Dixie Dies said.
   The park will count on the city of Seward for boom and other
protective measures, she said.
   The Coast Guard rejected a plea from oil producers to ease
restrictions placed on tanker traffic into Valdez following the
spill. The Atlantic Richfield Co. said tanker movement from the
marine terminal of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline needs to be
stepped up to ensure adequate supplies on the West Coast.
   On Friday, wholesale gasoline prices surged as commodities
traders speculated that the squeeze in oil supplies caused by the
disastrous spill won't ease soon. Gas prices at the pump jumped by
as much as 10 cents a gallon in parts of California.
   Normally three to four loaded tankers leave Valdez daily. Since
the spill, only five have made it out. The Coast Guard has ordered
tugboat escorts until the tankers pass the grounded Exxon Valdez.
Local harbor pilots are required to accompany the tankers for
longer distances than usual.
   The Coast Guard said the restrictions would not be lifted until
the Exxon Valdez is refloated and moved to a safe anchorage,
possibly next week. Workers continued Saturday to pump oil from the
crippled tanker onto the Exxon San Francisco.
   Biologists walking beaches have counted 520 oiled birds
representing 20 species, fish and game officials said. Ten sea
otters and 27 oiled birds were taken to Valdez for cleaning, and
federal bird experts said more than 1,000 tainted birds _ some
alive, some dead _ had been spotted on a single island. They
expected the number to increase dramatically.
   Wildlife experts also were considering the possibility of
sending some sea otters to other states for care and
rehabilitation. Biologists say they expect to be inundated by
otters, the marine mammal most vulnerable to oil contamination
because of the loss of insulation and buoyancy of their fur.
   A sablefish harvest set to open today was canceled because of
the spill. Officials previously halted the shrimp harvest, which
was open for about two weeks before the spill and was to have run
until mid-April.
   Meanwhile, another in a series of class-action lawsuits was
filed Friday. A class-action complaint by San Francisco attorney
Melvin Belli, on behalf of area fishermen, asked for $2 billion,
half of it in punitive damages.

   South Africa reported major clashes
with guerrillas hours before Namibia began its transition to
independence Saturday and said it may ask the U.N. force monitoring
the process to leave.
   Government-run radio said early Sunday that 36 guerrillas were
killed and two captured in fighting Friday night with South-West
African police, who suffered two deaths and nine injuries.
   The figures, attributed to a spokesman for territorial
Administrator-General Louis Pienaar, slightly revised those given
Saturday by South African officials.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha of South Africa said Saturday that 38
guerrillas and two territorial policemen were killed when
guerrillas of the South-West African People's Organization, or
SWAPO, infiltrated from Angola on Friday evening.
   ``This is a most serious development,'' said Botha.
   The reported attack came hours before a formal cease-fire took
effect and a 20-nation U.N. peacekeeping force began overseeing the
end of South Africa's 74-year rule over Namibia.
   Police blocked thousands of SWAPO supporters who tried to march
in the capital to celebrate the transition.
   Botha accused the rebels of a flagrant violation of a pledge to
halt hostilities and said he had complained to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Unless there is a satisfactory response from the United Nations,
Botha said, South Africa would feel compelled to ask the
peacekeeping force to leave ``until SWAPO can be brought to its
senses.''
   In New York, U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes released a statement
from Perez de Cuellar saying: ``The secretary-general is greatly
concerned that such incidents have been reported. He has told Mr.
Botha that UNTAG (the U.N. Transition Assistance Group) is
immediately sending a team to investigate the reports.''
   U.N. Special Representative Martti Ahtisaari sent four senior
U.N. military, civilian, and police personnel to northern Namibia
to investigate the South African report. He was expected to make
his report by Sunday evening.
   An official of SWAPO, which has waged a war for independence
since 1966, said the organization would need a day or so to
determine what had happened but added that SWAPO ``has gone out of
its way to avoid conflict.''
   According to Botha, Perez de Cuellar indicated he might agree
that South Africa could reactivate its troops to guard against
SWAPO operations. But the U.N. spokeswoman said the
secretary-geeneral would have no comment on Botha's remarks.
   Later at a news conference, Botha said South African troops will
be allowed to leave their bases to search for the guerrillas
involved in the fighting if police can't control the situation.
   South African and SWAPO forces were confined to their bases as
of Saturday under the U.N. plan but Pienaar said SWAPO units had
not complied.
   Botha interrupted his airport news conference to take a call
from Pienaar. He then said that Pienaar, Ahtisaari and Gen. Prem
Chand, the UNTAG commander, said certain South African units would
be released from their bases to provide support to the police and
the U.N. group would monitor the South African movement.
   Fewer than 800 of the 4,500 military personnel assigned to the
UNTAG have arrived in Namibia.
   There had been no fighting since September between South African
and SWAPO forces, which were supposed to be restricted to their
bases as of midnight Friday under U.N. Resolution 435.
   The resolution establishes a process for elections in November
leading to independence early next year for Namibia, Africa's last
territory.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, completing an African
tour, flew into Windhoek to meet with Botha, U.N. officials and
British members of the U.N. monitoring force.
   Mrs. Thatcher said a special session of the U.N. Security
Council should be called to consider the alleged SWAPO incursion.
   ``This a most serious challenge to the authority of the United
Nations and the agreement, and we condemn it totally,'' she said.
   There was a tense 30-minute standoff outside the capital when
about 100 policemen confronted up to 20,000 SWAPO supporters
marching to Windhoek from the black township of Katatura, seeking
to celebrate the start of the independence process.
   Church leaders persuaded the marchers to return to Katatura,
where celebration rallies by rival political factions were held
during the day.
   About 400 SWAPO supporters reached downtown Windhoek and held a
rally across from a luxury hotel. About 30 policemen watched but
did not interfere as the crowd chanted, ``SWAPO, we win!''
   Until independence, administration of the territory and
responsibility for law enforcement will remain in the hands of
Pienaar, appointed by South Africa.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia since it captured the territory
from the Germans in World War I.
   U.N. peacekeepers will monitor the election in November of a
constituent assembly. The assembly will later set up a black
majority government. Of Namibia's 1.3 million residents, about
70,000 are white.
   SWAPO is favored in the pre-independence elections, but whether
it can gain the two-thirds support needed to have complete control
over the drafting of a constitution is uncertain.
   The South Africans agreed to a U.N. independence plan for
Namibia in December as part of a southwestern Africa accord that
also calls for Cuban troops to be withdrawn from Angola.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Coast Guard intercepted a
728-foot cargo ship Saturday after the crew told the agency the
captain appeared drunk and was piloting the ship erratically,
officials said.
   A Coast Guard patrol boat intercepted the Japan-bound ``Century
Hope'' near the Channel Islands about 100 miles off the coast of
California. The captain, who was not identified, submitted to a
blood alcohol test and turned over command to the first mate, said
Petty Officer Brad Smith.
   Results of the test were not available late Saturday.
   ``The vessel is anchored in Long Beach Harbor and has been
detained by the Captain of the Port until the situation is
resolved,'' Lt. Donald Bruzdzinski said. Another captain was flying
from London to take command.
   The Century Hope, registered in Hong Kong and flying the British
flag, was carrying soy beans to Yokohama, Japan, Bruzdzinski said.
   The incident closely followed allegations that the captain
piloting the oil tanker Exxon Valdez was drunk when the tanker
rammed into Alaska's Bligh Reef on March 24th, creating the
nation's worst oil spill.

<TEXT>
   Hollywood song-and-dance man Gene Kelly was
released from the hospital Sunday after a bout with pneumonia.
   ``He's at home now, resting,'' said Beebe Kline, a publicist for
Kelly.
   Kelly, 76, had been admitted to Cedars-Sinai hospital Wednesday
under a pseudonym.
   ``He came in quietly,'' said hospital spokesman Ron Wise. ``His
physicians didn't want him to be bothered by phone calls or
visitors.''
   The illness forced the entertainer to cancel a weekend
performance of his one-man show, ``Evening with Gene Kelly'' at the
La Mirada Civic Center. Theater spokeswoman Beverly Hamlin said the
performance was not rescheduled and refunds would be given to 1,300
fans.
   Kelly starred in such films as ``An American in Paris'' and
``Anchors Aweigh,'' with Frank Sinatra. He is probably best known
for his splash dance in ``Singin' in the Rain,'' which he also
co-directed.

<HEAD>Sihanouk Says Would Meet Vietnamese-backed Cambodian Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Norodom Sihanouk, leader of a Cambodian
resistance coalition, said Sunday he has agreed to meet Hun Sen,
prime minister of Cambodia's Vietnamese-backed government.
   In a statement released from his residence in Beijing, Sihanouk
said he had been informed by a French diplomat that Hun Sen was
ready to make ``two concessions in regard to the problem in
Cambodia.'' He did not reveal the nature of the concessions.
   He said the meeting of Cambodia's four warring factions could
take place as early as May 2 in Indonesia or in September in France.
   Last month Hun Sen sent a letter to Sihanouk saying ``there are
elements that show that a fundamental agreement is possible''
between the government and resistance groups.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, drove out the radical
Khmer Rouge regime that defeated the U.S.-backed government in the
spring of 1975, and installed another communist administration.
   Hundreds of thousands of Cambodians were killed during the
nearly three years the Khmer Rouge was in power as it purged
opponents and drove people out of the cities to impose a harsh form
of agrarian communism.
   Prince Sihanouk, who was deposed in 1970, now leads a resistance
alliance of his supporters, the Khmer Rouge and Cambodians loyal to
anti-communist Son San.
   The three alliance members met in March in Beijing and formed a
National Defense Council, which they said would unify their
guerrilla forces.
   Hun Sen criticized the council, saying it was part of a Khmer
Rouge plot to regain power.
   On Sunday radio broadcasts by the resistance coalition denied
that allegation and said the Khmer Rouge would not seek exclusive
control of the future government and the council would not allow
any faction to harm the others by force.
   Representatives of the resistance groups and Cambodian
government met in February in Indonesia.
   The meeting ended without results when no agreement could be
reached on the formation of a transitional government to be
established following a withdrawl of the Vietnamese troops from
Cambodia. They also disagreed on how to monitor the Vietnamese
withdrawal.
   An estimated 70,000 Vietnamese military personnel are in
Cambodia. Vietnam has said it will withdraw its troops by September
if the Cambodian factions can agree on a political solution.

   Divers pulled seven bodies from a murky,
rain-swollen river Sunday where at least that many people died when
a 50-year-old U.S. highway bridge collapsed.
   The search for more victims continued but was hampered by bridge
debris and muddy waters, said state Highway Patrol Lt. Larry
Durham. The cause of the collapse was unknown.
   Searchers did not know how many victims might be in the river,
said Leroy Bledsoe, team director for nine divers working at the
site.
   Authorities said they had found a tractor-trailer rig and four
cars which plunged into the river when a large chunk of the
two-lane roadway fell 25 feet into the river about 8:45 p.m. CST
Saturday.
   They planned to continue to search ``until we're sure there are
no other vehicles or victims in there,'' Bledsoe said.
   The collapse left a 60-foot gap in the two-lane, northbound
bridge carrying U.S. Highway 51 over the Hatchie River five miles
north of here and about 45 miles north of Memphis. A companion,
two-lane bridge for southbound traffic was unaffected.
   Ron Collins of the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said
bridge-building experts planned to study the bridge to try to find
out why it collapsed.
   ``We've got the state Department of Transportation here. Their
bridge survey team is going to survey the pilings of both bridges
and do some soundings and we'll just have to go from there,'' he
said.
   State bridge inspectors plan to meet Monday morning with the
National Transportation Safety Board, according to Covington Fire
Chief Jerry Craig.
   The river is slightly swollen from heavy rainfall last month,
Craig said.
   ``We've had an unusual amount of rainfall last month. The river
is out of its banks, and there's backwater all over the place. But
this happens twice a year, every year, and has for the past 100
years,'' Craig said.
   ``The river is actually just barely out of its banks. We don't
feel it had any bearing on the collapse,'' said Craig.
   The Highway Patrol closed the southbound roadway shortly after
the collapse and traffic was routed around the area.
   One victim was identified as Billy Herron Sr. of Ripley,
believed to be 49 or 50, said Donna Pugh, a spokeswoman for Baptist
Memorial Hospital Lauderdale in Ripley. The names of the other six
were withheld until relatives were notified.
   The bodies of three victims, a man, a woman and a child, were
recovered Saturday night. They apparently had been riding together
in one car, Collins said.
   The Hatchie, which runs generally east to west across the middle
of West Tennessee, was at 14.7 feet, 2.7 feet over flood stage,
about where the accident occurred, the National Weather Service
reported. It was not raining at the time of the collapse, but it
had been raining in previous days.
   Bledsoe said swift currents and the dark water were hindering
the search.
   ``It's pitch black in there,'' he said.
   Larry Prater of Covington said residents have been concerned for
some time that the bridge was getting old. Prater said three of his
relatives were in a pickup truck that drove over the bridge not
long before it collapsed.
   ``I was telling my wife the other day, saying `That bridge with
as much water as we've had is a dangerous thing,''' he said.
   Aging highway bridges have collapsed in other states in recent
years. In April 1987, an upstate New York span collapsed, killing
10 people. In 1983, part of the Mianus Bridge in Connecticut
collapsed, killing three people.

   Israel is paying $5,000 a month to an American
serving a life sentence in federal prison in Illinois for stealing
U.S. secrets for Israel, according to a published report.
   Each month $5,000 is put in an Israeli bank account for former
U.S. intelligence analyst Jonathon Jay Pollard, according to the
April 10 issue of Newsweek magazine.
   Newsweek attributed the information to ``Territory of Lies,'' a
forthcoming book by Jerusalem Post correspondent Wolf Blitzer.
   Blitzer suggests Pollard will eventually make a deal to be
deported to Israel, where he'll get the cash, but no intelligence
work.
   ``He'll get some money and probably even a nice apartment. But
that's it,'' an unidentified Israeli official told Newsweek.
   Blitzer found no evidence that Pollard's activities were
authorized at the highest level in Israel, but said Israeli
investigators told him some cabinet ministers ``probably
suspected'' they had a spy in Washington ``but were willing to shut
their eyes to it.''

<TEXT>
   It will be another summer of confusion
in Union City, where the time of day is strictly a matter of
opinion.
   Residents of this city divided by the Indiana-Ohio state line
are victims of the time change that annually splits Union City into
what residents call ``slow and fast time.''
   When daylight-saving time went into effect nationwide at 2 a.m.
Sunday, most citizens of Union City, Ohio, went along. They are on
fast time.
   But those who live in Union City, Ind., stay on Eastern Standard
Time year-round, as do Hoosiers in 76 of Indiana's 92 counties.
They are on slow time _ most of them.
   ``Most people have adjusted to it, but there's still
confusion,'' said Scott Stahl, mayor of Union City, Ohio.
   Leroy Stentzil, a native of Ohio, has lived in Union City, Ind.,
since 1930 but still sets his clocks on Ohio time. ``It's a
nuisance until you get used to it,'' Stentzil said.
   A few years ago, Stentzil had clocks in his house labeled
``Indiana Time'' or ``Ohio Time.''
   ``I don't do that anymore,'' he said. ``But it does cause
confusion. I've been late lots of times. Now if I'm invited to
something in Indiana and I don't think about it, I'm there an hour
early. I keep reading material in my side pocket all the time.''
   In fact, most Union City, Ind., residents will experience the
anxiety of being an hour late for something during the coming
months, said John Ford, mayor of the Indiana side of Union City.
``But they'll make up for it by being early for something else.''
   The time change affects families who work on one side of the
state line but live on the other and merchants who must cater to
customers on both times, Stahl said.
   ``In some instances there are stores that stay on slow time no
matter what,'' Stahl said. ``The Ohio stores go on fast time. There
are some stores that might split it down the middle. It just gets
confusing.
   ``If they're normally open until 5 o'clock fast time, that would
be 4 o'clock slow time. So maybe they'll move it a half hour and
close at 5:30. That way it would be 4:30 slow time.''
   Ford said most of the larger industries in Union City, Ind., run
on fast time despite being in Indiana. Those include Union City
Body Co., which produces step vans, and Sheller-Globe Corp., which
makes auto trim.
   ``Most of the businesses in cities such as Detroit and New York
expect them to be following those hours,'' Ford said.
   However, Union City, Ind., schools and government stay on slow
time. As a result, some parents are leaving for work while their
children are just beginning to prepare for school.
   ``Part of the people in Indiana go on the Ohio time, just like I
do,'' Stentzil said. ``And part of them don't. I used to laughingly
say: `I don't care if they put ABCs on the clock. I'll get along.'
But I'm an old man now, and it just isn't so easy to adjust.''
   Stentzil said if Indiana legislators lived in Union City, they'd
think again about the wisdom of exempting Indiana from
daylight-saving time.
   Exemptions from daylight-saving time are Arizona, Hawaii, Puerto
Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa and part of Indiana,
according to The World Almanac. Daylight-saving time starts the
first Sunday in April and ends the last Sunday in October.

   Torrential rains along Australia's east
coast have caused flooding that that has claimed at least two
lives, police said Sunday.
   Two other people were missing and presumed drowned when a bridge
collapsed, the police said.
   Officials said a water department employee perished Saturday
when floodwaters overturned his boat in the Murrimbidgee River at
Casurina Sands, west of Canberra.
   A man died in Queensland state because of the flooding, police
said, but no details were available.
   Seven people were swept away when the rampaging Tweed River
collapsed a bridge at Murwillumbah in northern New South Wales
state. Police said five people were rescued early Sunday but two
are missing.
   Helicopters were sent to Murwillumbah to rescue victims of the
flooding that followed 48 hours of rain..
   One helicopter lifted 15 people from rooftops in the town and
navy helicopters rescued five schoolchildren stranded in the
Murwillumbah area, officials reported.
   Ted Pickering, the New South Wales minister of police and
emergency services, advised thousands of people living near the
Nepean, Hawkesbury and Georges rivers in the Sydney region to
prepare for possible evacuation.
   The Pacific Highway, the main road link between Sydney and
Brisbane, was flooded in several places.

   At least 20,000 people marched through
downtown on Sunday in a noisy abortion rights demonstration that
organizers called the largest pro-choice gathering ever held in the
San Francisco Bay Area.
   Police estimated the crowd at about 20,000, but organizers of
the ``March for Women's Lives'' said more than 30,000 people
participated in the march and rally at City Hall.
   Margaret Connell, 59, of Santa Barbara, marched with her
85-year-old mother and 30-year-old daughter. They carried a sign
that said ``Three generations for choice.''
   ``I think what's before us is a choice of whether abortion is
safe and legal or whether abortion is unsafe and illegal,'' said
Connell. ``It's not whether there's going to be abortion.''
   The march, which was expected to attract supporters from as far
away as Oregon and Washington state, was held in conjunction with a
scheduled April 9 abortion rights rally in Washington, D.C.
   In New York City, about 400 abortion rights activists, some
hoisting giant clothes hangers, pushed against anti-abortionists in
a demonstration in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral.
   In a rare show of civil disobedience marking what a rally leader
called ``a turning point'' in the abortion rights movement, nine
activists were arrested for trespassing on church property and
disorderly conduct.
   ``Cardinal O'Connor, we know your position, you are the head of
the new Inquisition!'' shouted the protesters, who say that
Cardinal John O'Connor and the Roman Catholic hierarchy are
endorsing violence against women by supporting radical
anti-abortionists.
   Neither O'Connor nor his spokesman returned messages seeking
comment on the protest.
   Activists on both sides of the issue have been galvanized by a
recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to hear a case that could
overturn legal protections for abortion that were guaranteed by the
court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision.
   Many participants said that threat prompted them to gather in
the streets to publicly express their views.
   ``It's the timing with the court,'' said Ann Murphy, 43, of
Berkeley. ``Our position doesn't mean we're telling people to have
an abortion, because there's nothing worse than a child that's
unloved and unwanted. ... It's a matter of respecting opinions.''
   The rally also comes at a time when several anti-abortion
groups, including Operation Rescue, have held numerous protests at
clinics around the nation.
   In Miami, a suburban abortion clinic was blockaded for more than
an hour Saturday by anti-abortion demonstrators. Police arrested
137 people on trespassing charges.
   On Friday, 83 people were arrested for blocking access to an
abortion clinic in Boca Raton, Fla., and an arson fire early Friday
caused $65,000 damage to an abortion clinic in Ocala, Fla.
   Sunday's San Francisco march brought a sharp reaction from
anti-abortion activists.
   ``Although the marchers purport to represent the women of
America, I think they are deluded by their own sense of
self-importance,'' Carole Hieatt of San Jose Pro-Life Council said
in a statement.
   In its most recent poll on the subject, the Los Angeles Times
reported on March 19 that 74 percent of the respondents in a
nationwide survey said they believed that abortion was ``morally
wrong,'' but also believed that it was a decision best left to the
individual.
   More than 100 organizations sponsored Sunday's demonstration,
including NOW, Planned Parenthood Association, the California
Abortion Rights Action League and the American Civil Liberties
Union.

<TEXT>
   Territorial police reported killing 44
guerrillas Sunday in widespread fighting that shattered a
cease-fire and threatened Namibia's day-old transition to
independence from South Africa.
   South Africa accused the rebel South-West African People's
Organization of infiltrating from neighboring Angola, but SWAPO
said its guerrillas were defending themselves.
   South Africa agreed to give up control of Namibia under a
U.N.-monitored process that began Saturday.
   Since late Friday, 120 guerrillas and six police officers hade
been killed, territorial police Lt. Kierie du Rand said Sunday
night.
   SWAPO president Sam Nujoma told a news conference in Harare,
Zimbabwe, that group officials told him at least 48 civilians also
had been killed in the confrontations, and many others had been
wounded. He said he could neither confirm nor deny the reports of
guerrilla deaths.
   Namibian police said there were more than 30 confrontations
between officers and guerrillas during the day Sunday, and that the
fighting continued into the night. No details about the clashes
were released.
   U.N. officials, including Gen. Daniel Opande of Kenya, deputy
commander of the peacekeeping troops, said the soldiers had neither
participated in nor seen the battles.
   Territorial police said the fighting was in Owamboland,
Namibia's northernmost tribal area, where the guerrillas have had
the most support during their 23-year bush war against South
African control of Namibia.
   The territorial army, due to be dismantled in mid-May as part of
a U.N. accord, suspended its demobilization process Sunday because
of the fighting and began reassembling some units.
   South African's foreign minister, Pik Botha, accused SWAPO of
ordering hundreds of insurgents to cross into Namibia from Angola
in violation of the U.N. agreement, reached in December.
   On Saturday, Botha said his government might order the 1,000
U.N. troops in Namibia to leave if it was not satisfied with a U.N.
response to the fighting.
   SWAPO accused South Africa of initiating the clashes and said
its guerrillas ``fired only in self-defense after being hunted down
and attacked.''
   ``It is the earnest desire of SWAPO to scrupulously observe the
terms of the cease-fire agreement,'' SWAPO said in a statement from
its headquarters in Angola. It did not explain why its fighters
were inside Namibia.
   Nujoma, in Zimbabawe for a conference on Namibia, said he was
``dismayed and shocked'' that the United Nations would allow the
territorial police to be redeployed.
   He told the semi-official Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency
that the guerrillas were under strict instructions to abide by the
cease-fire but that alleged violations were being investigated.
   Until Friday, there had been no fighting between South Africa
and SWAPO for more than six months as both sides observed an
informal truce.
   SWAPO urged the United Nations to deploy more peacekeeping
troops to monitor the truce. A total of 4,650 U.N.-sponsored troops
are to be sent to Namibia during the transition to independence.
   A spokesman for the U.N. force, Fred Eckhard, said SWAPO's
guerrillas were supposed to stay at least 100 miles inside Angola
as of midnight Friday. He said it was unclear whether the Namibian
police, who remain in charge of law enforcement until independence,
were entitled to operate against the guerrillas.
   Botha, in a statement Sunday issued in Cape Town, South Africa,
said some of the guerrillas were armed with surface-to-air
missiles, and that the U.N. Security Council should hold an urgent
meeting on the matter.
   Four U.N. officials Sunday inspected the scene of the initial
fighting and returned to Windhoek to report to the top U.N.
official in the territory, Special Representative Martti Ahtisaari
of Finland. They declined to comment on their findings, saying the
situation was too sensitive.
   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
issued a statement Saturday expressing alarm over the clashes. He
said U.N. officials in Namibia had confirmed an incursion by scores
of guerrillas.
   South Africa's white-minority government has ruled Namibia since
World War I. In December, South Africa agreed to the U.N.
independence plan as part of a regional accord that also calls for
withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.
   Until independence, administration of the territory and
responsibility for law enforcement will remain in the hands of a
South African-appointed official, Louis Pienaar, who is required to
oversee the government and elections impartially.
   Namibia is the size of France and West Germany combined, but it
has a population of only about 1.3 million, including roughly
70,000 whites.
   Iran on Sunday recognized Namibia's independence from South
Africa, and expressed hopes that the Namibian people would
establish a ``truly popular government,'' the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev received a
warm welcome Sunday as he arrived in Cuba for talks with President
Fidel Castro, who has criticized the Soviet leader's new pragmatic
brand of communism.
   Castro, wearing the green fatigue uniform that has been his
trademark for three decades, walked onto the rain-soaked tarmac
after Gorbachev's Ilyushin 62 jetliner landed and threw his arms
around the Soviet leader.
   It was the third meeting of the communist chieftains but
Gorbachev's first visit to Cuba, the island nation that for nearly
30 years has stood as a symbol of Soviet influence 90 miles off the
Florida coast.
   Castro kissed Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, on both cheeks before
escorting Gorbachev on a review of the presidential honor guard.
   Hundreds of thousands of Cubans mustered by local neighborhood
committees packed the arrival area at Jose Marti International
Airport and lined a 10-mile route through downtown Havana to the
official guest house where Gorbachev will stay during his four-day
visit.
   ``Everything is clear in our friendship, in our hearts, in our
soul, in our faces,'' Gorbachev said in a brief comment to Prensa
Latina, the Cuban news agency, upon his arrival at the guest house.
   ``Now the only thing left is to talk, and we do have somethingg
to talk about,'' he said.
   Formal talks between the Soviet and Cuban leaders were to begin
Monday.
   Gorbachev and Castro rode to the capital standing side by side
in an open, Soviet-built parade car. They waved to the cheering,
flag-waving crowd stacked several deep on both sides of the road.
   Although Castro is known for his ability to turn out thousands
of people in this city of 2 million, the welcome for Gorbachev
appeared genuinely warm.
   Official media in both countries have papered over ideological
differences to stress the closeness of Cuban-Soviet relations.
   But the contrast between Castro's doctrinaire Marxism and
Gorbachev's new-style openness and determination to modernize the
Soviet economy is evident just below the surface.
   ``Cuba needs perestroika and glasnost,'' one female church-goer
said Sunday when asked what she thought of Gorbachev's visit. ``God
has put Gorbachev in the world, and we are grateful.''
   The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said she hoped
Gorbachev would encourage Castro to permit more freedom in Cuba.
   Cuban security agents called a number of local dissidents to
suggest they stay away from the welcoming celebrations for
Gorbachev, said one source in the dissident community, which
remains largely underground.
   Political activity interpreted by the Communist regime as
``counterrevolutionary'' is punishable by lengthy prison terms.
   During his visit, Gorbachev is to hold several hours of private
talks with Castro, who has been openly critical of the Soviet
leader's pragmatic reforms for borrowing too much from capitalism.
   Soviet officials have suggested the Kremlin may reduce its
massive economic and military aid to the Caribbean nation as it
seeks to rebuild the Soviet domestic economy.
   ``We are going to discuss Fidel Castro's performance, just as he
is going to discuss our own performance,'' Soviet spokesman Gennady
Gerasimov told ABC-TV earlier Sunday in an interview from Havana.
``We will exchange views and experiences.''
   Before flying to Cuba, Gorbachev stopped in Ireland and met with
Prime Minister Charles Haughey, who suggested the next U.S.-Soviet
summit be held in Ireland.
   Gorbachev's first summit with President Bush will be held in the
United States later this year if the two nations follow the pattern
set during Ronald Reagan's presidency. However, no Bush-Gorbachev
meeting has been scheduled.
   Gorbachev's two-hour stop to the politically neutral, staunchly
Roman Catholic Ireland was the first by a Kremlin leader. It was
Gorbachev's first overseas visit since a December trip to the
United States.
   He was scheduled to do some sightseeing and address the National
Assembly before leaving Havana to fly to London on Wednesday for
meetings with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   He is to speak to financial and business leaders in a nationally
televised address Friday and will have lunch with Queen Elizabeth
II before returning to Moscow.
   During their meeting in Ireland, Gorbachev and Haughey were
photographed holding glasses of stout, the country's favorite
beverage. Gorbachev has championed an anti-alcoholism campaign in
the Soviet Union and has severely restricted sales of vodka.
   Gorbachev and Haughey, surrounded by their foreign ministers and
aides, met in a VIP lounge. Outside hung a vast oil painting of the
late John F. Kennedy that commemorated a 1963 visit by the
Irish-American president shortly before his assassination.

   Evie, an 8-year-old female giraffe, died
Sunday about 11 hours after falling on her side, zoo officials said.
   ``She passed away at 2:30 a.m.,'' said Ted Grannon, operations
curator for the Mesker Park Zoo. The body was taken to Purdue
University in West Lafayette for an autopsy to determine the cause
of death, he said.
   Zoo director Ron Young said Evie fell flat on her side Saturday
about 3:15 p.m., but he was not sure what caused the accident.
   ``She was kind of running around in the sun when all four feet
went our from under her and she landed on her side,'' Young said.
``We don't know if the wind was knocked out of her or whether she
hit her head.''
   Evie had been on her back since the accident, and attempted
about every 30 minutes to get back on her feet, zoo officials said.
   Zoo veterinarians Dr. Craig Butler and Dr. Stan Epperson treated
Evie Saturday night with relaxants, pain relievers and fluids, and
even took X-rays of her neck and her legs but found nothing broken,
Young said.
   Evie, worth $12,000 to $20,000, came to the zoo in 1982 from
Abilene, Texas. Her mate, Gerry, came from the Cheyenne Mountain
Park Zoo in Colorado Springs, Colo., in 1981, Young said.

   The Bush administration's new plan to provide
debt relief for Third World countries received a major boost on
Sunday when it won endorsement from the world's leading
industrialized countries.
   The endorsement was contained in a joint communique adopted by
the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and
Italy. It was issued following almost eight hours of closed-door
discussions conducted by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and
his foreign counterparts.
   The U.S. proposal was not mentioned by name in the three-page
joint statement, but the discussion of the changes needed in
current policy showed that the finance ministers were in general
support of the proposals outlined by Brady in a March 10 speech.
   ``Debt strategy should be strengthened by placing greater
emphasis on voluntary debt relief and debt service reduction in
agreement with the commercial banks as a complement to new
lending,'' the finance ministers said.
   Brady said that he was pleased with the endorsement contained in
the joint statement, saying it was unusually detailed on what
approaches now need to be taken and very specific on the need for
prompt action by the international lending agencies.
   ``There was broad support for strengthening the debt strategy
along the lines of the U.S. proposals,'' Brady told reporters after
the meeting had ended.
   Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson called the new debt
strategy an important step forward in solving the seven-year-long
debt crisis.
   ``We have a good agreement and we have good support demonstrated
for the proposal,'' he told reporters.
   A senior Treasury official, who briefed reporters, said that
while the communique did not mention specific support to be
provided by other countries, he expected such announcements would
be made later in the week. The administration is looking for
countries running large trade surpluses, such as Japan, to offer to
support the debt reduction effort by providing money for new loans.
   The Brady plan represents a major departure from the debt
approach pursued by the Reagan administration, which had repeatedly
rejected proposals for broad-based debt forgiveness.
   The $1.3 trillion burden of Third World debt has crippled the
economies of developing nations and sparked economic and political
unrest in many emerging democracies in Latin America. Riots left at
least 270 people dead in Venezuela in February after the government
announced a new austerity program to please that country's
creditors.
   The endorsement by America's major allies was the first step in
a sales strategy the administration has put together. Brady now
takes the proposal before meetings on Monday and Tuesday of the
steering committees of the 151-nation International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank.
   The two major lending organizations have key roles to play in
implementation of the new debt relief approach, which the
administration hopes will shave the current debt burden by 20
percent.
   In other comments, the seven industrialized countries reaffirmed
their commitment to stabilize the dollar, saying either a sharp
increase or decline in the greenback's value would be seen as
harmful to worldwide economic growth and would trigger joint
intervention by the nations to buy or sell dollars.
   The countries also told the United States that it needs to do
more to reduce its huge budget deficits and said countries, such as
Japan, which were running large trade surpluses should continue to
promote domestic demand in order to provide markets for foreign
goods.
   U.S. allies have been complaining that America's expected $170
billion federal budget deficit this year threatens worldwide growth
by driving up interest rates, a situation which also adds to the
debt payment burden of poor nations.
   The discussions took place at River Farm, an estate on the
Potomac River which once belonged to George Washington.
   Under the Brady debt plan, commercial banks would be asked to
forgive voluntarily a portion of the loans they have made to poor
nations. In return, the IMF and World Bank would provide assurances
that the remaining debt would be repaid.
   The administration has estimated that over the next three years
the plan could wipe out about $70 billion of the $340 billion in
debt owed by 39 of the most heavily indebted countries.
   The IMF and World Bank would be expected to contribute together
between $20 billion and $25 billion to back the debt reduction
effort with the United States looking to Japan and other countries
running large trade surpluses to assist in the effort by making new
loans.
   U.S. officials have indicated that Mexico, Venezuela and the
Philippines likely would be among the first beneficiaries of any
debt relief strategy.
   But the debtor nations are already complaining that the plan
does not go far enough to provide relief. Some experts have said
that any attack on the problem will have to write off 50 percent or
more of the debt.
   Large U.S. banks, who hold 30 percent of the outstanding Third
World loans, have reacted cautiously to the proposals, fearing that
they could cause a stampede by debtor nations demanding debt
forgiveness.
   Already, officials of Mexico have indicated that they will ask
their bank creditors in upcoming negotiations to either provide new
loans or slash the value of outstanding loans or the interest rates
being paid by half.
   Mexico, which owes $107 billion, is the Third World's second
largest debtor, behind the $110 billion owed by Brazil.
   The Brady plan represents a major departure from the Reagan
administration approach, which emphasized new lending and opposed
any broad-based proposals for debt forgiveness.
   The Reagan approach was crafted by then-Treasury Secretary James
A. Baker III. Baker, who is secretary of state in the Bush
administration, said in a speech last week that the new policy of
debt forgiveness would be negotiated on a country-by-country basis
with the relief going to those debtor nations willing to adopt
necessary economic reforms.
   At the IMF meetings on Sunday, debtor nations issued a statement
attacking the Baker approach to Third World debt while welcoming
the new approach outlined by Brady.
   Jean-Pierre Lemboumba-Lepandou, finance minister of Gabon and
chairman of the committee representing developing countries, said
the Brady plan was ``an important initiative and we are convinced
that it will bear fruit.''
   However, the Gabon finance minister sidestepped questions about
whether the U.S. proposal went far enough to reduce the debt
burden, saying the specifics of the proposal still needed to be
worked out in upcoming meetings.

   Elisabeth Ann Zinser, who was forced to
resign last year as the incoming president of the nation's only
university for the deaf, looks back on the incident without
bitterness and says she's ready for a new challenge as president of
the University of Idaho.
   ``I'm a pioneering person,'' she said. ``I feel I have to be
part of something that is poised for development.''
   In March 1988, Ms. Zinser became the focus of a national
controversy when she was selected over two deaf finalists to become
president of Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C.
   For the previous five years, Ms. Zinser had been vice chancellor
for academic affairs at the University of North Carolina at
Greensboro. She stayed at that post when the protest over the
Gallaudet job led her to withdraw before she took office.
   But now she's going to Moscow, Idaho, where she'll start July 1
as the first woman president of the Idaho's 9,500-student flagship
state university.
   She said she hopes to strengthen that school's research efforts
and its ties with the business community, and will work with
Idaho's Indian and Hispanic communities.
   And in an interview last week, she wondered aloud if her
interest in public service was enhanced by her experience with the
deaf students.
   ``I've got an intense desire to make my life count for
something,'' said Ms. Zinser, 49. ``That's why I can't just work
for any institution.''
   Her selection at Gallaudet touched off an immediate protest by
thousands of students, faculty members and their supporters at the
school _ which had never had a deaf president in its 124-year
history.
   The protesters shut down the university, marched and burned Ms.
Zinser in effigy. After three days, she resigned, citing a ``unique
civil-rights movement in history.''
   ``One of my objectives as president of Gallaudet University was
to be succeeded by a deaf person,'' she said with a smile. ``I
accomplished that, perhaps more quickly than I had planned.
   ``I never felt I quit,'' she continued. ``It wasn't a battle
between the students and Elisabeth Zinser, but an effort to reach a
common bond.''
   Ms. Zinser said farewell to the Gallaudet students by flashing
them the ``I love you'' sign. The students later gave her a
personal sign-language nickname: an ``E'' for Elisabeth, held over
the heart.

   Two bank executives and three other
people were arrested in the investigation of a Colombian-owned bank
accused in the United States of participating in a money laundering
operation, officials said.
   Attorney General Carlos Villalaz on Saturday identified the
bankers as William Guarin, a Colombian who is manager of the Banco
de Occidente in Panama, and Clara Garcia, a Panamanian who is the
bank's operations manager.
   He said the others arrested were Colombian pilots German Flores
and William Perez and Alonso Correa, a Colombian who was on the
plane that also carried Eduardo Martinez.
   Martinez is one of 127 people charged in the U.S. case that
involves more than a billion dollars in alleged drug trafficking
and money laundering.
   Martinez, of Medellin, Colombia, eluded capture Wednesday by
hiding in a bank and then escaping after troops from the Panamanian
Defense Forces surrounded the building, U.S. justice officials said.
   Villalaz did not say when the arrests were made.
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and FBI Director William
Sessions announced Wednesday that authorities had broken up an
operation that had laundered $1.2 billion in drug money the past
two years.
   U.S. officials said the operation was linked to Colombia's
Medellin drug cartel, which purportedly accounts for 80 percent of
the cocaine entering the United States.
   It was not clear if the pilots were the same ones U.S. officials
said had been detained Wednesday in Panama with Martinez' private
plane.
   The defense forces are headed by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
the country's leader, who is under indictment in Florida on illegal
drug charges.
   Villalaz said authorities had searched intensely for Martinez
but ``unfortunately we haven't been able to locate him.''
   Nivaldo Madrinan, director of the National Department of
Investigations, said Saturday that Martinez escaped ``because of
the lack of coordination between the capture in Panama and the
release of the news in the United States, where there was a news
conference that was heard by the fugitive.''

   More than 1,000 union members on Sunday
protested the high cost of living, the military draft and what they
called a lack of labor rights.
   The Workers' Permanent Congress organized the demonstration in
this city, 17 miles east of the capital of Managua.
   Eli Altamirano, secretary-general of the Nicaraguan Communist
Party, called the protest the beginning of ``a huge mobilization
against the Sandinista regime.''
   One sign carried by protesters said ``Next year the nine
leave,'' referring to the governing directorate of the left-wing
Sandinistas.
   In February 1990, Nicaragua is to hold general elections in
accordance with a peace plan the five Central American presidents
agreed to two months ago.
   ``The elections will not legitimize the Sandinistas. Rather,
they will be beaten,'' said Antonio Jarquin, a Social Christian
labor leader.
   The government has devaluated the currency several times this
year and slashed spending in the face of soaring inflation and
rising unemployment.
   There was no immediate reaction by the government to the Masaya
demonstratin.
   The workers' congress is a federation of unions including
centrist, socialist and communist members.
   Last June the congress called a strike that lasted several
months. Dozens of union leaders were detained but later freed.
   Some of the protesters Sunday tried to attack a cameraman from
government-run television and a photographer for the Sandinista
newspaper Barricada. Neither was injured and no other incidents
were reported.
   Carlos Duran, the Barricada photographer, told The Associated
Press that the demonstrators tried to take his camera but foreign
correspondents came to his aid.
