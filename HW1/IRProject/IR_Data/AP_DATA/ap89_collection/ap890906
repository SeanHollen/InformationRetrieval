   The Navy has concluded the explosion aboard the
USS Iowa that killed 47 sailors last April was ``probably caused
by'' a detonator put between gun powder bags by gunner's mate
Clayton Hartwig, who died in the blast, Pentagon sources said
Wednesday.
   The sources, who were briefed by Navy officers and who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the Navy investigation into the April
19 explosion in the battleship's No. 2 gun turret found foreign
material in the gun barrel after the explosion.
   This material led investigators to believe that Hartwig, who
oversaw the loading of the ill-fated gun, was in the best position
to have sabotaged the powder bags with the detonator.
   Congressional sources said the Navy's report, which was to be
released Thursday, said that ``an unlawful and illegal act'' by
Hartwig is pinpointed as the probable cause of the blast.
   The Navy was hampered in its four-month inquiry by the absence of
any seamen who had survived the explosion at close quarters. But
Navy sources had said in May that investigators were looking into
the possibility of homicide or suicide resulting from a falling out
between Hartwig and another sailor.
   Members of Congress received details on the Navy investigation
the day before the scheduled public release of the 1,100-page
report. Navy Cmdr. Mark Baker declined to comment Wednesday night on
the reports from congressional sources.
   Pentagon sources have said previously that the report ``cites a
probability'' that human action, calculated or otherwise, could have
caused the explosion. The officials have also said they ruled out
any specific mechanical cause for the blast.
   The explosion occurred as the No. 2 gun, the middle gun of three
in the second turret, was being loaded for firing practice while the
battleship was near Puerto Rico.
   The guns and turret were designed in the late 1930s and use
powder and shells manufactured more than 40 years ago in Word War
II. There had been early speculation that the powder could have
become unstable, but the Pentagon later discounted that theory.
   Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall Truitt, one of 11 sailors in the
base of the seven-deck turret who survived but did not witness the
blast, has criticized the Navy for leaking reports that the service
was investigating his relationship with Hartwig.
   Truitt has said investigators tried to suggest he'd had a sexual
relationship with Hartwig, or that Hartwig had committed suicide
after the two had a falling-out.
   Ellis Rubin, the Miami lawyer representing Truitt, said Wednesday
night, ``This is an underhanded attempt by the Navy to explain its
negligence in training the crew and forcing 50-year-old technology
onto the American public in order to preserve the battleship as a
weapon of war. ... The navy knows the cause of the tragedy and is
not going to reveal it. It's all part of a coverup and whitewash to
save the battleship.''
   Earlier this week, Seaman David Smith said Navy investigators
browbeat him into an admission that Hartwig had made a sexual
advance to him and had talked about how to set off an explosion with
a cheap timing device. Smith told ABC Radio he had received no such
proposition and had heard of no such timer.
   Hartwig's sister, Kathy Kubicina, said Smith's statements added a
strong boost to her campaign to clear her brother's name.
   She said Wednesday night, ``This is nothing I didn't expect. ...
None of the guys on the Iowa believe my brother blew up the
turret.'' She said family attorneys would outline their theory of
the explosion after a Navy briefing on Thursday.
   Pentagon sources had said previously that the report also would
outline numerous training and maintenance lapses on the ship, but
that none of those was identified as a cause of the explosion.
   The Navy plans to release its report Thursday morning with three
admirals, including the No. 2 officer of the service, briefing
reporters.
   Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Leon Edney; the investigating
officer, Rear Adm. Richard Milligan; and the head of the Naval
Investigative Service, Rear Adm. William Schachte will present the
long-awaited study at the Pentagon.
   The Iowa, meanwhile, is in Gaeta, Italy, as part of a tour of the
Mediterranean.

<HEAD>EDS: UPDATES with Shell saying two injured; conditions of workers,

<DATELINE>MARTINEZ, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An explosion at a Shell Oil refinery
touched off a huge fire Tuesday night that injured at least two
people and sent a plume of smoke thousands of feet into the air,
authorities said.
   ``It rattled all the windows in my home,'' said Robert Langston,
a Benicia resident who lives seven miles from the plant.
   Jane Tocher, an engineering assistant at Shell, said the plant
was shut down following the explosion about 6:35 p.m., but the fire
continued to burn out of control two hours later. Ambulances were
standing by at the refinery's main gate.
   Two contract employees for Shell were injured and taken to
Brookside Hospital in San Pablo. One man had second-degree burns on
25 percent of his body, mainly on his back and arms, said hospital
spokeswoman Cynthia Crawford. He was reported in good condition in
the hospital's burn unit.
   The other worker also was in good condition with second-degree
burns.
   The flames in the light-oil processing unit came from ``bleed-off
valves'' in pipes designed to burn off excess fuel during an
accident, said Shell spokesman Bill Sharkey. The unit, which
occupies about 15 acres of the 800-acre facility, is entirely
constructed of metal.
   The cause of the explosion and fire were unknown, he said.
   Neighborhoods were not being evacuated, but the sky over Martinez
was thick with black smoke that billowed several thousand feet into
the sky over the plant.
   The smoke gradually was being blown northeastward toward the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, which is sparsely populated. It
stretched for more than 15 miles by early evening.
   Residents throughout the region said they heard a big blast
followed by a loud rushing sound, which one San Francisco radio
caller described as ``like three jet engines starting up.''
   Langston said the roaring sound lasted five minutes.
   The big explosion was followed by more than a dozen smaller ones,
some of which could be felt as far away as the original blast and
several releasing large balls of fire over the proceccing unit.
   Shell firefighters were handling the blaze. Martinez city
firefighters were at the plant's gate, but had not been asked to
help. A county fire truck was loaned to Shell.
   The refinery is 40 miles northeast of San Francisco on the
Carquinez Strait, a 10 mile stretch of water that run from the San
Francisco Bay to the delta.

   Here is the text of President Bush's speech in
which he announced a $7.9 billion war on drugs.
   This is the first time since taking the oath of office that I
felt an issue was so important, so threatening, that it warranted
talking directly with you, the American people. All of us agree that
the gravest domestic threat facing our nation today is drugs.
   Drugs have strained our faith in our system of justice. Our
courts, our prisons, our legal system are stretched to the breaking
point. The social costs of drugs are mounting. In short, drugs are
sapping our strength as a nation.
   Turn on the evening news, or pick up the morning paper and you'll
see what some Americans know just by stepping out their front door:
Our most serious problem today is cocaine, and in particular, crack.
   Who's responsible? Let me tell you straight out.
   Everyone who uses drugs.
   Everyone who sells drugs.
   And everyone who looks the other way.
   Tonight, I will tell you how many Americans are using illegal
drugs. I will present to you our national strategy to deal with
every aspect of this threat. And I will ask you to get involved in
what promises to be a very difficult fight.
   This is crack cocaine seized a few days ago by Drug Enforcement
Administration agents in a park just across the street from the
White House. It could easily have been heroin or PCP. It's as
innocent looking as candy, but it is turning our cities into battle
zones, and it is murdering our children.
   Let there be no mistake: This stuff is poison. Some used to call
drugs harmless recreation. They're not. Drugs are a real and
terribly dangerous threat to our neighborhoods, our friends and our
families.
   No one among us is out of harm's way. When 4-year-olds play in
playgrounds strewn with discarded hypodermic needles and crack vials
_ it breaks my heart. When cocaine _ one of the most deadly and
addictive illegal drugs _ is available to school kids _ school kids
_ it's an outrage. And when hundreds of thousands of babies are born
each year to mothers who use drugs _ premature babies born
desperately sick _ then even the most defenseless among us are at
risk.
   These are the tragedies behind the statistics. But the numbers
also have quite a story to tell. Let me share with you the results
of the recently completed Household Survey of the National Institute
on Drug Abuse. It compares recent drug use to three years ago. It
tells us some good news and, some very bad news. First, the good.

<TEXT>
   As you can see in the chart, in 1985, the government estimated
that 23 million Americans were using drugs on a ``current'' basis _
that is, at least once in the preceding month.
   Last year, that number fell by more than a third. That means
almost 9 million fewer Americans are casual drug users. Good news.
   Because we changed our national attitude toward drugs, casual
drug use has declined. We have many to thank: our brave
law-enforcement officers, religious leaders, teachers, community
activists, and leaders of business and labor.
   We should also thank the media for their exhaustive news and
editorial coverage and, for the air time and space for anti-drug
messages.
   Finally, I want to thank President and Mrs. Reagan for their
leadership. All of these good people told the truth _ that drug use
is wrong and dangerous.
   But as much comfort as we can draw from these dramatic
reductions, there is also bad news _ very bad news.
   Roughly 8 million people have used cocaine in the past year,
almost 1 million of them used it frequently once a week or more.
   What this means is that, in spite of the fact that overall
cocaine use is down, frequent use has almost doubled in the last few
years. And that's why habitual cocaine users _ especially crack
users _ are the most pressing, immediate drug problem.
   What, then, is our plan?
   To begin with, I trust the lesson of experience: No single policy
will cut it, no matter how glamorous or magical it may sound. To win
that war against addictive drugs like crack will take more than just
a federal strategy. It will take a national strategy, one that
reaches into every school, every workplace, involving every family.
   Earlier today, I sent this document, our first such national
strategy to the Congress. It was developed with the hard work of our
nation's first drug policy director, Bill Bennett.
   In preparing this plan, we talked with state, local and community
leaders, law enforcement officials and experts in education, drug
prevention and rehabilitation. We talked with parents and kids. We
took a long hard look at all that the federal government has done
about drugs in the past. What's worked, and _ let's be honest _ what
hasn't.
   Too often, people in government acted as if their part of the
problem _ whether fighting drug production, or drug smuggling, or
drug demand _ was the only problem. But turf battles won't win this
war. Teamwork will.
   Tonight, I'm announcing a strategy that reflects the coordinated,
cooperative commitment of all federal agencies. In short, this plan
is as comprehensive as the problme. With this strategy, we now
finally have a plan that coordinates our resources, our programs and
the people who run them.
   Our weapons in this strategy are: the law and criminal justice
system, our foreign policy, our treatment systems, and our schools
and drug prevention programs.
   So the basic weapons we need are the ones we already have. What
has been lacking is a strategy to effectively use them.
   Let me address four of the major elements of our strategy.
   First, we are determined to enforce the law, to make our streets
and neighborhoods safe. So to start, I'm proposing that we more than
double federal assistance to state and local law enforcement.
Americans have a right to safety in and around their homes.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: ...around their homes.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   And we won't have safe neighborhoods unless we are tough on drug
criminals _ much tougher then we are now.
   Sometimes that means tougher penalties. But more often it just
means punishment that is swift and certain.
   We've all heard stories about drug dealers who are caught and
arrested _ again and again _ but never punished. Well, here the
rules have changed: If you sell drugs, you will be caught. And when
you are caught, you will be prosecuted. And once you're convicted,
you will do time.
   Caught. Prosecuted. Punished.
   I am also proposing that we enlarge out criminal justice system
across the board _ at the local, state and federal levels alike. We
need more prisons, more jails, more courts, more prosecutors. So
tonight, I'm requesting _ altogether _ an almost billion-and-a-half
dollar increase in drug-related federal spending on law enforcement.
   And while illegal drug use is found in every community, nowhere
is it worse than in our public housing projects.
   You know, the poor have never had it easy in this world. But in
the past, they weren't mugged on the way home from work by crack
gangs. And their children didn't have to dodge bullets on the way to
school. That is why I'm targeting $50 million to fight crime in
public housing projects _ to help restore order, and to kick out the
dealers for good.
   The second element of our strategy looks beyond our borders,
where the cocaine and crack bought on America's streets is grown and
processed.
   In Colombia alone, cocaine killers have gunned down a leading
statesman, murdered almost 200 judges and seven members of their
supreme court. The besieged governments of the drug-producing
countries are fighting back, fighting to break the international
drug rings.
   But you and I agree with the courageous president of Colombia,
Virgilio Barco, who said that if Americans use cocaine, then
Americans are paying for murder. American cocaine users have to
understand that out nation has zero tolerance for casual drug use.
We have a responsibility not to leave our brave friends in Colombia
to fight alone.
   The $65 million emergency assistance announced two weeks ago was
just our first step in assistance the Andean nations in their fight
against the cocaine cartels. Colombia has already arrested
suppliers, seized tons of cocaine and confiscated palatial homes of
drug lords.
   But Colombia faces a long, uphill battle, so we must be ready to
do more.
   Our strategy allocates more than a quarter of a billion dollars
for next year in military and law enforcement assistance for the
three Andean nations of Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. This will be the
first part of a five-year, $2 billion program to counter the
producers, the traffickers and the smugglers.
   I spoke with President Barco last week, and we hope to meet with
the leaders of affected countries in an unprecedented drug summit,
all to coordinate an inter-American strategy against the cartels. We
will work with our allies and friends _ especially our Economic
Summit partners _ to do more in the fight against drugs.
   I'm also asking the Senate to ratify the U.N. Anti-Drug
Convention concluded last December.
   To stop these drugs on the way to America, I propose that we
spend more than an billion-and-a-half dollars on interdiction.
Greater interagency cooperation, combined with sophisticated
intelligence-gathering, and defense department technology, can help
stop drugs at our borders.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: ...at our borders.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Our message to the drug cartels is this: The rules have changed.
We will help any government that wants our help. When requested, we
will for the first time make available the appropriate resources, of
America's armed forces. We will intensify our efforts against drug
smugglers on the high seas, in international airspace and at our
borders.
   We will stop the flow of chemicals from the United States used to
process drugs. We will pursue and enforce international agreements
to track drug money to the front men and financiers.
   And then we will handcuff these money launderers, and jail them _
just like any street dealers. And for drug kingpins, the death
penalty.
   The third part of our strategy concerns drug treatment. Experts
believe that there are 2 million American drug users who may be able
to get off drugs with proper treatment. But right now, only 40
percent of them are actually getting help. This is simply not good
enough.
   Many people who need treatment won't seek it on their own. And
some who do seek it are put on a waiting list. Most programs were
set up to deal with heroin addicts, but today, the major problem is
cocaine users. It's time we expand our treatment systems and do a
better job of providing services to those who need them.
   So tonight, I'm proposing an increase of $321 million in federal
spending on drug treatment.
   With this strategy, we will do more. We will work with the
states. We will encourage employers to establish Employee Assistance
Programs to cope with drug use. And, because addiction is such a
cruel inheritance, we will intensify our search for ways to help
expectant mothers who use drugs.
   Fourth, we must stop illegal drug use before it starts.
Unfortunately, it begins early _ for many kids, before their teens.
But it doesn't start the way you think, from a dealer or an addict
hanging around a school playground. More often, our kids first get
their drugs free, from friends, or even from older brothers or
sisters. Peer pressure spreads drug use. Peer pressure can help stop
it.
   I am proposing a quarter-of-a-billion-dollar increase in federal
funds for school and community prevention programs that help young
people and adults reject enticements to try drugs. And I'm proposing
something else. Every school, college and university _ and every
workplace _ must adopt tough but fair policies about drug use by
students and employees. Those that will not adopt such policies will
not get federal funds. Period.
   The private sector also has a role to play. I spoke with a
businessman named Jim Burke who said he was haunted by the thought _
a nightmare, really _ that somewhere in America, at any given
moment, there is a teen-age girl who should be in school, instead of
giving birth to a child addicted to cocaine.
   So Jim did something. He led an anti-drug partnership, financed
by private funds, to work with advertisers and media firms. Their
partnership is now determined to work with our strategy by
generating educational messages worth a million dollars a day _
every day for the next three years _ a billion dollars worth of
advertising, all to promote the anti-drug message.

   As president, one of my first missions is to keep the national
focus on our offensive against drugs. So next week I will take the
anti-drug message to the classrooms of America in a special
television address, one that I hope will reach every school, every
young American.
   But drug education doesn't belong in class or on TV. It must
begin at home and in the neighborhood. Parents and families must set
the first example of a drug-free life. And when families are broken,
caring friends and neighbors must step in.
   These are the most important elements in our strategy to fight
drugs. They are all designed to reinforce one another, to mesh into
a powerful whole. To mount an aggressive attack on the problem from
every angle. This is the first time in the history of our country,
that we truly have a comprehensive strategy.
   As you can tell, such an approach will not come cheaply. Last
February, I asked for a $700 million increase in the drug budget for
the coming year. Over the past six months of careful study, we have
found an immediate need for another billion-and-a-half dollars. With
this added $2.2 billion, our 1990 drug budget totals almost $8
billion _ the largest increase in history.
   We need this program fully implemented _ right away. The next
fiscal year begins just 26 days from now. So tonight, I'm asking the
Congress _ which has helped us formulate this strategy _ to help us
move it forward immediately.
   We can pay for this fight against drugs without raising taxes or
adding to the budget deficit. We have submitted our plan to Congress
that shows just how to fund it within the limits of our bipartisan
budget agreement.
   I know some will still say that we are not spending enough money.
But those who judge our strategy only by its price tag, simply don't
understand the problem. Let's face it, we've all seen in the past
that money alone won't solve our toughest problems.
   To be strong and efficient, our strategy needs these funds. But
there is no match for a united America, a determined America, an
angry America. Our outrage against drugs unites us, brings us
together behind this one plan of action, an assault on every front.
   This is the toughest domestic challenge we've faced in decades.
And it is a challenge we must face _ not as Democrats or
Republicans, liberals or conservatives _ but as Americans. The key
is a coordinated, united effort. We have responded faithfully to the
request of the Congress to produce our nation's first national drug
strategy.
   I'll be looking to the Democratic majority and our Republicans in
Congress for leadership and bipartisan support. And our citizens
deserve cooperation, not competition; a national effort, not a
partisan bidding war.
   To start, Congress needs not only to act on this national drug
strategy, but also to act on our crime package announced last May; a
package to toughen sentences, to beef up law enforcement and build
new prison space for 24,000 inmates.
   You and I both know the federal government can't do it alone. The
states need to match tougher federal laws with tougher laws of their
own _ stiffer bail, probation, parole and sentencing.
   And we need your help. If people you know are users, help them
get off drugs. If you are a parent, talk to your children about
drugs _ tonight.

   Call your local drug prevention program. Be a Big Brother or
Sister to a child in need. Pitch in with your local Neighborhood
Watch program. Whether you give your time or talent, everyone counts.
   Every employer who bans drugs from the workplace.
   Every school that's tough on drug use.
   Every neighborhood in which drugs are not welcome.
   And most important, every one of you who refuses to look the
other way. Every one of you counts.
   Of course, victory will take hard work and time. But together we
will win _ too many young lives are at stake.
   Not long ago, I read a newspaper story about a little boy named
Dooney, who, until recently, lived in a crack house in a suburb of
Washington, D.C. In Dooney's neighborhood, children don't flinch at
the sound of gunfire. And when they play, they pretend to sell to
each other small white rocks they call crack.
   Life at home was so cruel that Dooney begged his teachers to let
him sleep on the floor at school. And, when asked about his future,
6-year-old Dooney answers, ``I don't want to sell drugs, but I will
probably have to.''
   Well, Dooney does not have to sell drugs. No child in America
should have to live like this. Together, as a people, we can save
these kids. We have already transformed a national attitude of
tolerance into one of condemnation. But the war on drugs will be
hard-won, neighborhood by neighborhood, block by block, child by
child.
   If we fight this war as a divided nation, then the war is lost.
But if we face this evil as a nation united, this will be nothing
but a handful of useless chemicals.
   Victory. Victory over drugs is our cause, a just cause, and with
your help, we are going to win.

<TEXT>
   Rajiv Gandhi, the prime minister, flew to
southern India and became Rajiv Gandhi, the candidate, hopscotching
by helicopter across friendly and hostile political turf as part of
his upcoming re-election bid.
   With forceful voice and blistering rhetoric at odds with his
congenial, pink-cheeked appearance, Candidate Gandhi denounced those
who oppose him as relics of a feudal past, consorters with traitors
and assassins, potential instigators of religious wars.
   Under Indian law, he must call elections no later than Jan. 4.
   In less than five years, Gandhi has grown from political novice
to confident campaigner as he seeks to perpetuate the dynasty that
began in 1947 when his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, became India's
first prime minister as the vast Asian subcontinent was freed from
British colonial rule.
   The Nehru-Gandhi family's domination of the prime ministership
has been interrupted only twice _ for a total of three years. It was
personified and perpetuated by Nehru's daughter, the iron-willed
Indira Gandhi whose assassination in 1984 propelled Rajiv Gandhi, an
ex-airline pilot, into the leadership of the world's largest, albeit
flawed and unruly, democracy.
   The young man who rode to victory on a wave of sympathy for his
mother's slaying is now, at the age of 45, being put to the test of
harsher political realities.
   At last count, the Elections Commission was considering
applications of 216 parties or would-be parties for places on the
ballot for the elections. The problem for the opposition _ and the
advantage for Gandhi _ is that the closest thing to a well-organized
national political party in India is the Congress Party he inherited
from his grandfather and mother.
   The next best at the moment is the Janata Dal, or National Front,
an ever-shifting alliance of about half a dozen parties or movements
constantly at war within itself.
   It was the Janata Dal that Gandhi assailed in 13 speeches during
a 31-hour swing in August across the southern states of Karnataka
and Andhra Pradesh.
   To be sure, Gandhi has been trading barbs with Janata Dal's
president, Viswanath Pratap Singh, his former defense and finance
minister, for about three years.
   But he has now launched a frontal attack on N.T. Rama Rao, Janata
Dal's chairman.
   Rama Rao, the chief minister, or top elected official, of Andhra
Pradesh, is highly popular across India as a movie star who has
portrayed just about every major deity in the Hindu pantheon. He is
timing the release of his next film for the election campaign.
   Rama Rao, who routinely dresses in facial paint and bright orange
robes invocatory of the gods he portrays, is also the leader of
Telegu Desam, a political party operating only in Andhra Pradesh.
Nevertheless, it won the second highest bloc of national Parliament
seats in the 1984 election: 30 to the Gandhi party's 415 in the
544-seat chamber.
   In speeches to Congress Party rallies _ officially scheduled as
``public meetings'' _ in four economically depressed Andhra Pradesh
towns, Gandhi accused Rama Rao's state government of corruption,
exploitation of the poor and failure to provide protection from a
murky Maoist band known as Naxalites.
   By the time he got to Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh's state capital,
Candidate Gandhi had nominally reverted to Prime Minister Gandhi.
Seated beside Rama Rao at a news conference, Gandhi repeated some of
the same charges. When a reporter tried to ask Rama Rao a question,
the head of the prime minister's information office, Gopalaswami
Parthasarathy, stepped forward to say: ``This is not a joint press
conference.''
   The next day, according to the anti-Gandhi national newspaper
Indian Express, the 70ish movie star sniped at the prime minister as
an ``inexperienced young brat.''
   Still, a national opinion poll conducted for the news magazine
India Today in August projected Gandhi's Congress Party would win
315, or 58 percent, of the seats in the election.
   Even if the opposition parties as a whole captured a majority, 58
percent of the 10,399 registered voters surveyed in the poll said
they doubted the opposition would be able to form a government. And
if they did, 69 percent thought any such government would fall apart
before its five-year term was up.

   Police commanders and army generals who
fight them often say Colombia's billionaire cocaine barons have the
best weapons and politicians money can buy.
   Colombia's conscript soldiers are no match for the well-paid
private armies of drug lords. They are poorly trained, equipped, and
paid, typically earning only $2 a month, and most are teen-age farm
boys who just want to get home alive.
   The country's police generally earn $110 a month, $10 above the
minimum wage.
   Narcotics traffickers, with vast bankrolls, have a total army of
4,000 men who are paid as much as $2,000 a month each. They have
their own intelligence units and sophisticated global communications.
   Drug lords have plenty of the latest small weapons and even
airplanes and helicopters armed with machine guns, a source with
anti-narcotics police has said. They are known to have
shoulder-fired light anti-tank weapons and rifle grenades.
   Police sources say Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, one of the major
suspects, has a twin-engine Cessna airplane armed with
electronically fired M60 machine guns, and four helicopters, each
armed with two M60 machine guns.
   Colombia has an army of 200,000 men and a national police force
of 80,000, both under the Defense Ministry. A colonel at the Defense
Ministry said privately only about 20,000 of the total were involved
in day-to-day operations against drug traffickers and leftist
guerrillas.
   A U.S. narcotics officer in Bogota told The Associated Press
infiltration of the security forces was a serious problem. He said
an army colonel could earn up to $15,000 a month by tipping off
traffickers about raids and providing other information.
   A former Colombian army intelligence officer said one raid on a
drug traffickers' hideout turned up records showing he paid $100,000
a month for information.
   Drug cartels also are believed to exercise heavy influence on
Colombia's lawmakers and judges.
   The richest of Colombia's suspected drug traffickers, Pablo
Escobar, was a member of Congress while he was amassing his
cocaine-smuggling fortune.
   Everyone knew it, and no one seemed to care until it became a
major embarrassment to the Congress.
   Few cases actually come to light because proof is difficult to
find, but Colombians generally agree that many of their congressmen
are on the take from drug traffickers.
   No president or Cabinet minister has ever been proven to be
linked to drug traffickers.
   However, Colombia's political parties and the Congress have
refused to adopt legislation that would make life very difficult for
drug traffickers.
   For instance, they have failed to move rapidly to revamp
Colombia's antiquated courts and laws that make it easy for arrested
drug traffickers to slip through loopholes.
   They also have sent hamstrung security forces to fight the drug
traffickers.
   There are some small, elite units with up-to-date training and
equipment, such as a 2,000-member anti-narcotics unit attached to
the national police.
   However, the majority of the army and police labor away without
the resources to make a real dent in the drug smuggling that
provides most of the cocaine for U.S. markets.
   While soldiers in big cities generally look neat, troops in
remote areas often wear old, ill-fitting boots and carry rucksacks
that appear as if they are about to fall apart.
   It is common to find 30-year-old communications equipment that no
longer works.
   Army patrols have been seen flagging down rural buses for
transportation in the vast plains and jungle regions of southern
Colombia. They have sallied forth into anti-drug battles in the
north in banana-hauling trucks.
   An agent of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Colombia
once said Colombian anti-narcotics police had to beg gasoline from
the DEA before mounting a raid.
   Colombia normally gets $10 million a year in equipment and
training from the United States for fighting drug trafficking.
Another $5.5 million goes mostly for spare parts.
   In addition, President Bush has sent $65 million in equipment
from an emergency fund.
   Last week, a U.S. narcotics officer at the Embassy told reporters
that Colombia could use $200 million a year in foreign aid for
fighting drug smugglers.
   It remains to be seen how much the U.S. equipment will help.
   Two C-130 cargo planes that were turned over to the Colombians on
Sunday, for example, are each 30 years old, according to a U.S.
diplomatic source.
   The drug traffickers can often afford the best equipment and most
daring fighters.
   Bogota newspapers have said traffickers offered $500,000 for a
single killing: the assassination last month of leading presidential
candidate Sen. Luis Carlos Galan.
   Informants have told narcotics police that members of drug cartel
forces compete vigorously for murder contracts because success means
lots of money and favors that could make them rich.
   Rodriguez Gacha, who used to be a pig farmer, is now a
billionaire cocaine trafficker in the Medellin cartel.
   Another member of the cartel, Pablo Escobar Gaviria, ranked high
in Forbes magazine's ranking of world billionaires this year with
between $2 billion and $3 billion.
   He was once a car thief and pickpocket.

   Getting tough with deadly drug gangs may
be a macho job in a macho land, but the man who's doing it is 69,
with white hair and an unsteady voice, and has been depicted in
Colombian newspapers as a weak leader.
   Virgilio Barco, elected to a four-year term in 1986, looks more
like a university professor than the president of a violent nation.
   Polls have shown as many as 70 percent of Colombians disapprove
of his performance, but the number of serious problems he faces
simultaneously may be unprecedented for a president of this troubled
South American country.
   In addition to murderous drug traffickers, Barco has to deal with
an estimated 10,000 leftist guerrillas, a foreign debt of $15
billion and declining prices for Colombia's gold, oil and coal.
   He is a quiet man who thinks, reads and studies history. He does
not smoke and drinks only an occasional glass of white wine at
official receptions.
   His only sport is golf, which he is not able to play often, and
his handicap is a state secret.
   Aides say the president rises at 5 a.m. and begins his day with a
briefing on what happened during the five or six hours he slept.
   Barco graduated from the Massachussetts Institute of Technology,
is married to Carolina Isackson of York, Pa., and served as
ambassador to Washington. He became so Americanized and made so many
errors in Spanish grammar during his presidential campaign that the
cocktail circuit made him the butt of jokes.
   On Aug. 18, assassins hired by cocaine barons killed Sen. Luis
Carlos Galan at a rally. Galan was the leading presidential
candidate and an outspoken foe of the narcotics trade.
   If the drug lords had expected Barco to knuckle under, they were
wrong. In the toughest presidential speech Colombia's 30 million
people had heard in many years, he said the nation might face the
most bloodshed since a civil war four decades ago took 250,000 lives.
   He said he was sending police and soldiers to raid and confiscate
hundreds of luxurious villas, ranches and other property of drug
traffickers. His delivery may not have been forceful, but his
message is shaking the country from the high Andes to its vast
plains.
   In the most surprising announcement of all, Barco said he was
using emergency powers to extradite Colombians so those wanted on
drug charges in the United States could be tried there.
   The traffickers, who have said often they preferred tombs in
Colombia to jail cells in the United States, retaliated with a
rampage of terror, bombings and arson.
   What the outcome will be is not clear. Barco's term as president
has 11 months to run.

<HEAD>`Controlled Choice' School Desegregation Plan Set To Begin in Seattle</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>

   For the first time in more than a decade, back to
school should mean back to the same school for most children under a
revamped, relaxed desegregation plan, officials say.
   Three years in the making, ``controlled choice'' replaces a
system blamed for the loss of hundreds and perhaps thousands of
middle-class students to private, parochial and suburban schools.
   ``Anybody can pick at the edges of this plan,'' said Mayor
Charles Royer. ``I think the (school) administration has done a good
job.''
   Under one key feature, virtually all the system's 43,000 students
have been told they can remain at the same school from year to year
until they advance to the next level _ from grade school to middle
school, for example.
   Since 1978, when the city became the largest in the nation to
adopt a mandatory desegregation plan without a court order, students
have been switched from one school to another an average of three
times in grade school and once each in middle and high schools to
maintain racial balance.
   White students comprise 46.6 percent of Seattle's public school
system, with non-whites _ predominately blacks, Asians and Hispanics
_ at 53.4 percent, said Pat Patterson, a spokeswoman for the school
system. However, the desegregation plan concerns only balance
between blacks and non-blacks, and Ms. Patterson did not know the
breakdown of the student population in those terms.
   Superintendent William Kendrick convened an advisory panel to
begin work on the new plan shortly after he was hired in 1986. He
said it should cut reliance on mandatory busing in half this year
and could end busing entirely in as little as three years, although
he is making no predictions at this point.
   ``We're into a transitional period,'' Kendrick said. ``My goal is
a totally voluntary program.''
   The plan covers the entire city, including some predominately
white North End neighborhoods that had previously been exempt. It
also include kindergartners for the first time.
   Under the new policy, parents can choose any grade school from a
cluster of at least a half-dozen that includes one in their
neighborhood. Exceptions are allowed for 4th-, 5th-, 7th- and
8th-graders to remain in their current schools and, in some cases,
for students to attend the same schools as brothers and sisters.
   Despite a rocky start, with assignments delayed by computer
problems and uncounted parents registering children in public and
private schools, the plan shows signs of success, Kendrick said.
   Of the 43,293 children registered by Monday, 90 percent got their
first choice of schools, Ms. Patterson said Tuesday. Classes start
Wednesday.
   But parents who didn't get their first choices for their children
voiced their displeasure.
   ``It's been a horrible two weeks. All we've asked is for them to
be assigned together,'' said Mary Potts, whose first-grade son's
school assignment is an hour's bus ride from the school her
third-grade daughter will attend.
   For others, like Rochelle Mastin, the outcome was better. ``I
can't believe it,'' said Mastin, who moved to Seattle a year ago and
feared her 7-year-old daughter's request would not be granted.
   ``We've got a number of parents now who are coming in and saying
they're coming back from the private schools,'' Kendrick said. He
said he had no precise number, but that 300 parents had expressed
that sentiment recently at one of three special parent information
centers.
   Only after fall enrollment figures are tallied next month will
there be any solid indication of how many students the public school
system regained, he said.
   Kendrick said half of the 21,000 students who relied on buses
last year would have done so regardless of desegregation, 30 percent
were taking advantage of optional and special programs and 20
percent were transported solely to achieve racial balance.
   Mandatory busing should be cut to 10 percent this year and still
lower after two years, the end of the ``grandfathering'' period for
school assignments, he said.
   Despite improvements in the desegregation program, opponents of
mandatory busing in any form are pushing Initiative 34, dubbed SOS,
for Save Our Schools.
   It would reserve 6 percent of the city's sales tax revenue _
about $4 million a year _ for ``magnet'' programs in schools with
less than 33 percent white enrollment, but only if forced busing
were discontinued. The city now provides no money for operation of
the schools.
   The City Council and School Board have sought court action to
keep the latest measure off the Nov. 7 general election ballot. A
ruling is expected in about a week.
   ``My concern is that in all this furor over the initiative that
people give this new plan a chance,'' Royer said. ``I think the
(school) administration has done a good job.''

   A Trans World Airlines jet with 151 people
aboard had to dive suddenly Tuesday to avoid another plane directly
in its path at 37,000 feet, and five passengers were injured, an
airline spokesman said.
   Air traffic controllers in Chicago apparently steered the plane
onto the collision course, said TWA spokesman Don Morrison. But a
Federal Aviation Administration spokesman in Chicago disputed
Morrison's statement.
   ``We have no knowledge of air traffic controllers being
involved,'' FAA spokesman Mort Edlestein told The Associated Press.
   Morrison said TWA Flight 818 was approaching Detroit about 45
minutes after it took off from St. Louis Lambert International
Airport at 4:21 p.m., CDT, non-stop for Paris when contact was made
with Chicago air traffic controllers.
   The pilot ``was given a vector change, a direction change, by the
air traffic control system,'' Morrison said. ``He made that change
until (situated) at 37,000 feet, which was his assigned altitude.
   ``As he made the turn, he noted immediately in front of him an
airplane _ a foreign aircraft. He immediately dropped altitude to
avoid the aircraft. He avoided the aircraft, went underneath it,''
Morrison said.
   Edlestein said the incident involved the TWA jetliner and a
military aircraft but said it was not being classified immediately
as a near collision.
   ``The last we knew, the planes were eight miles apart,'' said
Edlestein. ``Why he took evasive action we won't know until we talk
to the (TWA) pilot.''
   Edelstein said the FAA and the National Transportation Safety
Board would investigate.
   Morrison said the TWA pilot returned to St. Louis because the
airline's main maintenance facility is located at Lambert. Flight
818's passengers were reboarded on other flights to Paris, he said.
The plane returned to St. Louis about 6 p.m., CDT.
   Morrison said the five injured people, one a flight attendant,
were taken to hospitals for treatment. None was believed to be
seriously hurt.

   Academics and cultural groups worldwide are
tentatively reaching out again to China, but the June crackdown the
pro-democracy movement and its aftermath have left both sides wary
of each other.
   Chinese officials say they want exchanges but accuse Western
countries of seeking to subvert China's socialist system by sowing
ideas about democracy and capitalism.
   ``Windows cannot be opened without a screen to keep flies and
bacteria from coming in freely,'' Vice Education Minister He
Dongchang said in a recent interview.
   In an example of the new arms-length approach, he said China will
send abroad fewer doctoral students but more short-term visiting
scholars who are less likely to ``fall in love with life abroad.''
Just 20,000 of the 80,000 students China has sent abroad in the past
decade have returned.
   On the other side, Western students and scholars say they want to
continue work in China but fear it could be interpreted as a sign of
unconcern or even support for the June 3-4 army attack on student
pro-democracy protesters in which hundreds of unarmed civilians were
killed.
   ``We are hopeful that scholarly exchanges will resume but only
under conditions with which we can feel comfortable ... and not
serve political purposes,'' said Michel Oksenberg, a Chinese
specialist and political science professor at the University of
Michigan.
   ``If anything the events of April through June underscore the
inadequacies of our understanding of each other's societies,'' he
said.
   Foreign academics also wonder if it will be possible to share
ideas as before, given the government's new emphasis on stamping out
the Western liberal influences it blames for the spring of student
protests.
   ``Don't talk about politics,'' Chinese university officials
warned several Americans who arrived to teach English.
   ``Last year we had a debate _ I was George Bush and my roommate
was Michael Dukakis'' _ the U.S. presidential candidates, said one
American teacher, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We went
through this whole spiel about how America elects presidents. I
wonder if they'd let us do that this year.''
   It is not yet clear how the dismissal of liberal Culture Minister
Wang Meng, announced by the government Monday, might affect China's
cultural ties with the outside world. Wang, a novelist who survived
two decades of persecution because of his candid works, actively
supported free expression and artistic exchanges with the outside
world.
   His apparent successor, former Propaganda Department official He
Jingzhi, is unlikely to change China's policy of encouraging
scientific, educational and cultural exchanges but will likely
require closer monitoring of foreign books, plays, movies and
performers for political messages.
   Before June, China's cultural exchanges with the rest of the
world were spiraling so rapidly that Bob Frame of the British
Council, which administers government cultural programs, said his
office had a hard time keeping up.
   But after the army attack, most exchanges with China came to an
abrupt halt. Foreign teachers and students were evacuated by their
governments amid fears of civil war, and some countries canceled
planned visits by Chinese performers.
   Suddenly, Frame said, his office had time to install a new
computer system.
   Over the past three months, however, what many foreign scholars
referred to as the ``trauma of June'' has subsided and the lure of
China has reasserted itself.
   With the new academic year, exchanges are tentatively resuming.
Programs that bring foreign scholars to China for short periods have
the highest percentage of returnees.
   No figures are available, but there seems to be a shortage of
foreigners to teach English at Beijing colleges, a job often taken
by recent American college graduates.
   ``They just begged me to stay,'' an American woman back for her
second year of English teaching said of her university officials.
   Other Americans said Chinese schools are so eager for native
English speakers that they were hired with the briefest of
interviews.
   Yale and Stanford, two major U.S. universities that send
graduates each year to teach English, will not this fall.
   Many European and American schools also are not sending Chinese
language students, placing them in Taiwan or Hong Kong programs
instead out of concern for their safety.
   But most say the move is temporary, and that they would like to
return to Beijing when it lifts martial law, now in its fourth month.
   The University of South Carolina is even thinking of starting up
a new program to send international business students to China.
``China will be a major player in the world economy,'' said the
university's Jeffrey Arpan, explaining his visit to Beijing to meet
Chinese educators.
   Western performing groups seem in no hurry to rush back to China,
partly in anger over the crackdown and partly because commercial
sponsors are reluctant. However, most foreign tours by Chinese
groups this fall are going forward.
   Most Chinese scheduled to go abroad to teach or study also appear
to be going, although the Ford Foundation said a few scholars
canceled U.S. visits because they are being investigated in
connection with the protests.
   Political investigations and re-education also have distracted
from planning new programs. Embassy spokesman Sheridan Bell said
Chinese officials say ``Let's wait until after Oct. 1, let's wait
until the new year'' when the embassy suggests exchange ideas.
   Oksenberg said putting exchanges on hold makes him nervous. It
reminds him, he said, of 1949 when the Communists took power.
   ``Things were postponed and it was thought to be temporary, but
it turned out to be for 20 years,'' he said.

   Jim Varney _ ``Ernest'' to fans of his
movies, commercials and TV show _ is taking his nosy, know-it-all
character abroad.
   Next year, Ernest P. Worrell will be showing up in
advertisements, television shows and films in Europe, Asia, Canada
and Australia.
   Ernest, whose signature phrase is ``Know whut I mean, Vern?'' is
returning from a nine-month hiatus from commercials and he's
sporting a new contract.
   Varney hit his stride in advertising, pitching a variety of
products. The Emmy-winning actor has appeared in hundreds of
commercials in about 150 U.S. television markets.
   The Shakespearean-trained actor one time feared the character
would be overpowering. ``I was a little sensitive at one time. I
felt like that character was overshadowing everything else I would
do. But you can't argue with success,'' Varney said.
   Varney, who lives on a farm north of Nashville, said the
character is successful because he's familiar to everyone.

   Singer Amy Grant no longer worries about
having all the answers, and said her goal is simply ``to write
better songs.''
   Grant has become somewhat of a ``Dear Abby'' to her fans, many of
whom consider the Nashville-born gospel-pop artist a personal
friend. She gets about 150 letters a week from fans, many seeking
advice.
   She said she tries to answer most of the letters herself but
sometimes asks friends or family to help. If a fan asks her advice
on a situation she has never experienced or is unfamiliar with, for
example, she said she feels inadequate to answer it.
   Grant, 28, is a multiple Grammy winner. Her ``Unguarded'' and
``Age to Age'' gospel-pop albums each have sold more than 1 million
copies.

   After chasing bad guys for six years as
the idealistic Lt. Henry Goldblume on ``Hill Street Blues,'' Joe
Spano decided he wanted to be one.
   When the series ended in 1987, Spano avoided typecasting and went
on to play villains. He concentrated on the theater, playing a
small-time hood in a David Mamet play and an 18th-century hypocrite
in a production of ``School for Scandal.''
   Now the 43-year-old Spano is ready to play heroes again. In ``A
Chorus of Disapproval'' by Alan Ayckbourn, he will dust off his
good-guy hat and play a shy, naive widower cast in a British
small-town musical who suddenly finds himself in the lead.
   ``I'm kind of getting back into playing nice guys,'' Spano said.
``What I've always wanted to do was a debonair, charming witty
person. I wanted to be Cary Grant.''

   Nugzar Ruhadze, a journalist from Soviet Georgia
who gave TV viewers in U.S. Georgia a new perspective, said he has
one overwhelming impression of Americans: their eagerness for peace
between the two nations.
   Ruhadze, the first Soviet journalist to work for an American
television station, left for home Tuesday after spending four months

<HEAD>Man Pleads Innocent to Birthday Party Multiple Slayings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who allegedly shot and killed his wife
and three other women at a birthday party pleaded innocent Tuesday
to four counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder.
   Raymond Navarro Jr., 26, pleaded innocent to the charges that
also included multiple murder special circumstance allegations,
which would make him eligible for the death penalty if convicted.
   Navarro was ordered held without bail pending an Oct. 11 court
appearance, said Deputy District Attorney Greg Denton.
   Maria Delia Navarro was celebrating her 27th birthday with about
20 family members and friends in her East Los Angeles home on Aug.
27 when Navarro allegedly burst in and began shooting a handgun.
   Mrs. Navarro was shot dead along with her aunts, Maria Garcia,
65, and Francisca Arizpe, 62. Family friend Leticia M. Dipp, 46, was
also killed.
   A third aunt, Berta Galvan, 47, and party guest Richard
Covarrubias, 43, survived gunshot wounds.
   Shortly before the rampage, a man called to warn Mrs. Navarro
that her estranged husband was coming to kill her. The woman called
the 911 emergency line for help, but was told to call back in what
officials later defended as standard procedure.
   ``The dispatcher did, in fact, function properly. She did not
violate any department policies or procedures,'' said Sheriff
Sherman Block.
   ``There are threats made all the time,'' the sheriff added.
``There is a difference between a threat and a clear and present
danger.''

   For sale: 450 units of old military
housing at Westover Air Force base at $1 for each two-, three- and
four-family unit.
   The hitch: they must be carted off by Dec. 15 and rehabilitated
at an estimated $77,000 each.
   Chicopee officials concede the deal they are offering is no
bargain.
   ``I'd be shocked if we got any offers,'' Community Development
Director Thomas Haberlin said Tuesday. ``They are not worth
$77,000.''
   But before the city can demolish the vacant apartments to develop
the surplus base property, state regulations require it to make
every effort to sell them, he said.
   ``The units are not in very good condition, but we thought we
ought to give it a shot even through it is unlikely that we will
find someone with a use for them,'' agreed Allan W. Blair, president
of the Westover Metropolitan Development Corp.
   The corporation is a regional group that has been working for 15
years to develop the base property declared surplus by the military
when it scaled back the former Strategic Air Command base.
   Blair said the 38-year-old housing was ``very modest'' even in
its salad days and has been vacant since it was abandoned by the Air
Force in 1973.
   The units are difficult and costly to move because they were laid
on concrete slabs with no basements or floor joists to hold them
together, he said.
   ``Before they can be lifted, you have to run steel rods through
the walls to hold them together and then you have to set them down
very precisely, because the utilities are run through the walls and
you have only a 4-inch margin of error,'' he said.
   After weeks of advertising, the development group has gotten
inquiries about just two units, Haberlin said. So far though, no
deals.

   Nancy Reagan, who launched an anti-drug
effort during her eight years as first lady, said education remains
the key in fighting drug abuse.
   She also told a women's conference Tuesday that her ``Just Say
No'' campaign produced positive results.
   ``They talk about Colombia and how terrible it is, which it is.
But they don't talk about the fact that at the lower age levels
there has been progress made,'' she said hours before President Bush
unveiled his $7.9 billion plan to attack drug abuse.
   ``I'd like to think that was a little bit due to the work that we
did.''
   Mrs. Reagan said education may be the ``long way around'' to
conquer drug abuse, but it is necessary.
   ``I think we have to take the customer away from the drug. We can
only do that through education,'' she said.
   Recently, U.S. attention has focused on violence sweeping through
Colombia because of the recent crackdown on cocaine traffickers.
Colombia's efforts were started after the assassination of a
presidential candidate opposed to the drug trade.
   ``They have to realize that, yes, there may be the cartels in
Colombia, or wherever. And it's sometimes easier to talk about that
than it is about the fellow on the corner who you can arrest or the
Wall Street broker who's dealing or using.
   ``Yes, the cocaine may be foreign-grown but the users are
homegrown,'' she said.
   Mrs. Reagan also talked about her years in the White House during
the speech to the Southern California Conference on Women.
   ``Everything is larger than life, the highs are higher .. by the
same token, the lows are lower,'' she said of life on Pennsylvania
Avenue.
   After moving from Washington back to California, ``I was
exhausted for a month,'' Mrs. Reagan said.

<HEAD>US Backs Mubarak On Palestinian Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, in a move to break a
diplomatic impasse in the Middle East, is seeking Arab and Israeli
support for a proposal by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for
holding Palestinian elections, U.S. officials say.
   Among the 10-point proposal's key elements are provisions for
voting by Palestinian residents of Jerusalem and for the temporary
withdrawal of Israeli troops from voting areas throughout the West
Bank and in Gaza.
   ``This is a start,'' an official said Tuesday. ``It's the kind of
thing we need.''
   But he and other U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said it was not clear if Mubarak's ideas were acceptable
to Israel or to the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   A plan pushed by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has the
administration's endorsement. The PLO, which has the power to block
its implementation, is cool to a key provision: temporary self-rule
but not statehood for the 1.4 million Palestinian Arabs who live on
the West Bank and in Gaza.
   The territories were captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967
Six-Day war and are under Israeli control. The PLO demands a state _
an outcome opposed by both Israel and the United States.
   Shamir's idea is to have elected Palestinians negotiate with
Israel a temporary arrangement for self-rule in the territories.
This would be followed by talks on an overall Middle East settlement
involving also Jordan and Egypt.
   Among Mubarak's suggestions, officials said, were the temporary
withdrawal of Israeli troops from polling areas and participation in
the balloting by Palestinians who live in East Jerusalem.
   Also, leaders of the Palestinian insurrection on the West Bank
and in Gaza who have been deported would have a role to play by
conveying their negotiating ideas to Palestinian residents.
   Israel, which has vowed never to relinquish control of Jerusalem,
its capital, is opposed to balloting by Palestinians who live in the
city. It is one of the main sticking points in the so-far
unsuccessful U.S. effort to launch negotiations.
   Mubarak's idea, the official said, is to have the Palestinians
vote outside Jerusalem and then return to their homes.
   The PLO, meanwhile, has denounced the election plan as a ploy to
ward off establishment of a Palestinian state.
   In light of these and other differences, Mubarak's proposal was
warmly received by the Bush administration.
   ``Mubarak's approach is a way of getting the election proposal to
take a few steps forward,'' an official said. ``He has offered
himself as a mediator, to bridge the gap.''
   Another U.S. official, also insisting on anonymity, said ``these
are interesting ideas. The Egyptians are trying to help the process
of getting to elections.''
   The officials said American diplomats had taken up the proposal
with Israel and with Arab governments. Meanwhile, no date has been
set for a resumption of U.S. talks with the PLO in Tunisia, where
Yasser Arafat's organization has its headquarters.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Anti-Drug Plan Already Embroiled in Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, the latest in a long line of
leaders to declare war against drugs, is tackling a $100
billion-a-year narcotics industry with a $7.9 billion program
already embroiled in political dispute.
   Bush describes the program he announced in his first nationally
televised address as a plan that ``is as comprehensive as the
problem.''
   To critics such as Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the
House select committee on narcotics, it is ``a thousand points of
light with no batteries.''
   ``Quite frankly,'' said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman
Joseph Biden, ``the president's plan is not tough enough, bold
enough or imaginative enough to meet the crisis at hand.''
   Quite simply, congressional Democrats are not willing to let Bush
seize the initiative or claim credit for leading a politically
popular cause.
   After all, it was the Democratic-controlled Congress that
overcame opposition from then-President Reagan and passed
legislation that required now-President Bush to develop the overall
drug strategy he announced Tuesday night.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley faults Bush's plan as too limited, but
also warns that it could increase pressure for a tax increase.
Biden, for example, is already calling for higher taxes on wine,
beer and cigarettes to finance the drug war.
   Bush, however, insists that the battle can be waged without
raising taxes or increasing the deficit. He proposed siphoning more
than $751 million from other areas, including juvenile justice,
housing, immigration and economic development.
   Politicians of every stripe recognize that Americans are anxious
for action. A Gallup Poll released at the White House last month
found that a record 27 percent of adults view drugs as the most
important problem facing the nation, more serious than poverty, the
economy, the environment and even fear of war. That survey was taken
even before the declaration of war by drug barons against the
government of Colombia.
   Despite efforts by every president for decades, the drug problem
in America has swollen to immense proportions, with cocaine more
plentiful, purer, cheaper and more in demand than ever.
   It's big business for drug lords in Latin America and their U.S.
lieutenants. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates illegal drug
sales at $110 billion annually, more than double the profits of all
the Fortune 500 companies combined.
   There are plenty of willing consumers. About 21 million Americans
have tried cocaine; 3 million still use it occasionally and 1
million report being heavy users.
   Those cocaine users are the chief targets of Bush's program.
Rather than emphasize efforts to intercept drugs before they reach
the United States, Bush's strategy is to go after the casual user.
   ``Where this country got off track in the late '60s and '70s was
believing the only people worthy of attention were the major
traffickers and kingpins, and not the individual users,'' said
William Bennett, Bush's national drug policy director and the author
of much of Bush's program.
   Bush's proposal encourages states to adopt harsher fines for
casual drug users, to seize users' cars, suspend their drivers'
licenses and send some offenders to military-style boot camps.
   Colleges and universities would be required to adopt drug
prevention programs as a condition for receiving federal funds.
   ``All of us agree that the gravest domestic threat facing our
nation today is drugs,'' Bush declared.
   ``American cocaine users need to understand that our nation has
zero tolerance for casual drug use.''
   He said the nation can win the war with hard work and over time.
   Yet, without directly pointing a finger at his critics, Bush
said, ``If we fight this war as a divided nation, then the war is
lost.''
   Democrats are anxious not to appear that they're dragging their
feet, even though they insist on reshaping Bush's program. ``We
don't oppose the president's plan,'' Biden said. ``All we want to do
is strengthen it. We don't doubt his resolve; all we want to do is
stiffen it.''

<HEAD>Tax-Deferred Savings Seen as `Cruel Hoax' For Many Retirees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many Americans should avoid tax-deferred
savings plans such as IRAs because they merely shift income to a
time when they'll be subject to higher tax rates, a private research
group says.
   Many middle-income retirees ``are discovering their marginal tax
rate is up to four times higher than the rate they paid while
working,'' the National Center for Policy Analysis, a non-profit
group based in Dallas, said in a report released Tuesday.
   ``For many people, the promise of tax-deferred savings is a cruel
hoax,'' the study said.
   Many retirees are worse off because they put their savings in
IRAs rather than ordinary savings accounts, the study said, adding
that many younger people also would be better off avoiding
tax-deferred savings programs, which include IRAs and 401Ks.
   The higher tax rates for the elderly exist because some Social
Security benefits now are taxed and some elderly people pay a new
surtax for Medicare coverage against catastrophic illnesses, the
report said.
   ``These two taxes combined can raise the marginal tax rates of
elderly retirees as much as 37 percentage points,'' said Aldona
Robbins, a former Treasury Department economist and a coauthor of
the study.
   For example, an elderly widow with $24,000 of income from
interest, dividends and a pension in addition to her Social Security
benefits faces a 1989 marginal tax rate of 48.3 percent on income
from savings, the study said. Without the Social Security and
Medicare taxes, she would be in the 15 percent federal income tax
bracket.
   ``The value of IRAs, company pensions and other tax-deferred
savings has been severely eroded for about 60 percent of today's
workers'' by the two taxes, the group said.
   The report warned that the higher tax rates for the elderly
jeopardize the nation's ability to stimulate the personal savings
needed to fuel investment in the U.S. economy and increase
productivity.
   ``Under the current system, about $70 billion per year is
deposited into tax-deferred savings by younger people not yet aware
that they are deferring taxes to the time when they will be facing
the highest marginal tax rates,'' the study said. ``Once this fact
is widely known, the effect on saving in the U.S. will be
devastating.''
   The study recommended abolishing both the Social Security and
Medicare taxes or at least changing the tax treatment of retirement
savings, perhaps by allowing people to pay taxes on deposits to
savings programs at the point when their marginal tax rates are
lower.
   Under the 1983 Social Security revisions, half of all Social
Security benefits are subject to federal income tax if half the
benefits plus all non-Social Security income exceed $25,000 for an
individual or $32,000 for a couple. For these people, 50 cents of
the Social Security benefit is taxed for each dollar of additional
income.
   The Medicare surcharge for the elderly was approved by Congress
last year to help finance coverage of catastrophic illnesses. In
1989, a 15 percent surtax is imposed on federal income tax
liabilities over $150, affecting about 40 of percent of those 65 and
older, with the surtax rising to 28 percent by 1993. The maximum
surtax payment is capped at $800 per person in 1989 and rises to
$1,050 in 1993.

<HEAD>Official Says Organizing Response Team Will Take Another Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The oil industry will be hard-pressed to
organize a nationwide network of oil spill response teams by the end
of next summer, according to a retired Coast Guard commander chosen
to direct the project.
   On his first day as president of PIRO Implementation Inc., John
D. Costello said Tuesday the industry-financed group hopes to get
the response teams fully equipped and ready for possible action
within one year.
   ``Even that's going to press us,'' Costello, 59, said in a
telephone interview.
   Costello's organization is charged with creating a Petroleum
Industry Response Organization, a coast-to-coast network of spill
cleanup experts and equipment that can respond quickly to a major
oil accident anywhere in U.S. waters.
   The idea was proposed in June by the major oil companies as the
industry's main response to the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska _
the largest oil spill ever in U.S. waters.
   Costello, who retired from the Coast Guard as a vice admiral in
July 1988, said he saw ``some exciting possibilities'' for quickly
improving the industry's capability of cleaning up shorelines hit
with large oil spills.
   But he stressed that it will take longer to develop ways to limit
the spread of spills as large as the Valdez accident in which the
Exxon tanker dumped 11 million gallons of crude into Prince William
Sound after ramming a reef.
   ``Current technology simply does not exist'' to contain spills of
that size, he said.
   The proposed industry network would include a headquarters in
Washington D.C. and regional ``response centers'' in New York;
Norfolk, Va.; New Orleans; Long Beach, Calif., and Seattle.
   Each center would be staffed around the clock by trained cleanup
specialists and would be equipped to handle a 30,000-ton oil spill _
about the same as the Valdez spill.
   The whole system, including PIRO Implementation, is being
financed by the major oil companies. The industry said last June in
announcing plans for the response system that it would spend $250
million on the project over five years.
   Costello capped a 36-year Coast Guard career with a four-year
stint as Pacific commander, based in Alameda, Calif., from 1984-88.
He previously was the service's representative on the National
Security Council, at the State Department and at the Justice
Department.
   Costello directed Coast Guard activities during the mass exodus
of Cubans to the United States in 1980, and during his tenure as
Pacific commander he played a role in directing the cleanup of
several oil spills off the West Coast.

<HEAD>Potato Farmers Held Down Plantings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Potato farmers didn't go overboard on plantings
this year despite the temptation of high market prices and brisk
consumer demand, Agriculture Department figures show.
   Last year's drought reduced potato output sharply and sent prices
upward, both at the producer and consumer levels.
   In the first six months of 1989, according to the government
index, consumer prices of fresh potatoes were up an average of about
37 percent from the first half of 1988.
   Prices paid to growers nearly doubled during the same period,
peaking at an average of $9.47 per 100 pounds, compared with $5.25 a
year earlier.
   Total U.S. potato output in 1988, hit severely in many states by
last year's drought, dropped to less than 350 million hundredweight,
down 10 percent from 1987.
   ``Potato prices in 1989 have been boosted by several factors, the
most important being last year's 10 percent crop reduction,'' says
the department's Economic Research Service. ``This decline tightened
stocks in the face of relatively strong demand, especially for
processing (largely freezing) potatoes.''
   With a shorter crop and rising prices, it made sense to expect a
big rebound in planted acreages this year, but there was only a
slight increase.
   The agency report said ``the lure of expected strong alternative
crops such as barley, sugarbeets and wheat'' helped hold down 1989
potato expansion, along with the feeling of many that the recent
boom would be followed by a bust, as often happens in the potato
industry.
   Other factors cited by USDA economists included a 49 percent
increase in seed potato prices, and poor weather in many areas at
the start of the 1989 growing season, prompting some farmers to
switch to later crops.
   Seed potatoes rose to an average of $10.60 per 100 pounds by
mid-April, up $3.48 from a year earlier. Assuming an average seeding
rate of 20 hundredweight per acre, that translated into $70 more per
acre for planting this year's crop.
   If production this year shows only a modest increase to around
375 million hundredweight, USDA analysts say rising processor demand
and continued export strength virtually ensure that the 1989-90
potato market will remain strong.
   Analysts cite several changes that lend optimism to the U.S.
potato outlook:
   _A long decline in fresh potato use has stopped or at least
slowed down. Fresh use averaged 47 pounds per person annually from
1986 to 1988, about the same as in the early 1980s.
   Contributing factors include promotion campaigns by the potato
industry and the convenience of microwave ovens.
   _The domestic use of frozen french fries and other frozen items
rose to 45 pounds per capita from 36 pounds in 1980.
   _Exports of frozen potatoes, particularly french fries, rose to
309.1 million pounds of product weight in 1988 from 84.5 million
pounds in 1980.
   Based on shipments through June, this year's frozen potato
exports are up 27 percent from last year, with french fries
accounting for 88 percent of the volume.

   An Agriculture Department scientist is trying
to make plant seeds take a nap and then wake up refreshed and ready
to germinate.
   Research chemist Sharon Sowa of the department's Agricultural
Research Service is seeking ways of preserving seeds from a wide
variety of plants, including wheat, passion fruit and guayule, a
natural substitute for rubber.
   The sleep technique also could be used to prepare seeds for
``surgery'' by scientists who want to develop new plant varieties
that can resist diseases, withstand drought or add additional
nutrients to diets.
   In a report by the agency, Sowa said her goal was ``to treat
seeds some day much like doctors treat their patients in surgery.
The same anesthetics such as nitrous oxide (laughing gas) that are
used to slow human respiration during surgery also slow the life
processes inside seeds.''
   Sowa works at the USDA's national seed laboratory, Fort Collins,
Colo., where vast collections of plant species are held in cold
storage. The facility is maintained as insurance against seeds
becoming extinct, and as a resource for plant breeders.
   ``Nitrous oxide is what we call a permeable molecule _ it goes in
and out of plant cells very easily, without causing any damage,''
she said. ``Exactly how it works to slow respiration in humans and
seeds is unknown.''
   Sowa said that on tests of snap beans, a mixture of 80 percent
nitrous oxide and air was blown over the seeds, slowing cell
respiration in the beans by 35 percent _ enough to anesthetize the
seeds.
   Half an hour later, she revived the seeds by exposing them to
fresh air. Sowa said all the seeds eventually woke up and germinated
normally.

   Dry weather in the West has created problems
for sheep producers and has raised doubts that the U.S. flock will
continue growing as it has in recent years, according to an
Agriculture Department report.
   The slaughter of mature sheep has increased dramatically,
particularly in Texas and New Mexico, where it is up 30 percent from
last year, says the report by the department's Economic Research
Service.
   ``Exports of live sheep to Mexico, which are typically cull
mature ewes, were 190,584 head (in the first half of this year),
compared with 31,766 head a year earlier,'' the report said.
   ``Increased slaughter and increased exports of live sheep raise
questions about the industry's ability to continue the production
expansion of the last two years,'' it added.

shoulders of a group of Washington-area students who will use the
linkup to ogle exotic animals in their natural habitat and discuss
conservation issues with wildlife experts in Kenya, Discovery
Channel officials said Tuesday.
   The one-hour cable television program, ``Student Safari: Africa
Watch,'' will be part of TDC's week-long series on Africa and will
use seven cameras throughout Kenya's Masai Mara Reserve _ four on
mobile vehicles and three in fixed positions.
   Four telephone lines will carry questions and replies back and
forth in what TDC officials said will be the first such
long-distance interactive classroom setup.
   Julian Pettifer of the British Broadcasting Corp., which is
co-producing the program, will play host from the Masai Mara, and
WJLA-TV news anchor Renee Poussaint will perform similar chores in
Washington. The students who participate in the linkup from a studio
in Washington will be from elementary through high school age.
   ``We believe that `Student Safari: Africa Watch' represents a
breakthrough, allowing for the first time _ live before a national
audience _ students to be linked by television to a country half the
world away,'' said Greg Moyer, TDC senior vice president@programming
group.
   ```Student Safari' represents all the exciting possibilities of a
global classroom,'' TDC Chairman John Hendrick said.
   The program will be broadcast from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. EDT as a
special edition of TDC's new ``Assignment Discovery'' series that is
designed for use in U.S. classrooms. The World Wildlife Fund will
provide each Washington student participating in the production with
background materials before the telecast, TDC said.
   The American Association of School Administrators, National
Education Association, National School Boards Association and
National Association of Secondary School Principals are
participating in the ``Assignment Discovery'' project.
   The Discovery Channel jumped into the burgeoning classroom cable
TV market in May when it announced ``Assignment Discovery'' as a
five-day-a-week teaching tool for this school year.
   Cable News Network just began a 15-minute current events show,
``CNN Newsroom,'' that teachers may tape for use in their
classrooms, and Whittle Communications of Knoxville, Tenn., is
offering schools free televisions and videocassette recorders if
they accept a 12-minute ``Channel One'' program that contains two
minutes of commercials.
   ``Assignment Discovery,'' which will be commercial-free, will
feature a particular subject area on each day of the week, starting
with science and technology on Monday, followed by social science on
Tuesday; natural science on Wednesday; arts and humanities on
Thursday; and world events and contemporary issues on Friday. It
begins Sept. 18.
   The BBC and TDC also are producing ``Safari Live! Africa Watch''
for American audiences Sept. 22-24 from the Masai Mara Reserve.

<HEAD>US May Prescribe Waiting Period For Some Soviet Jewish Emigrants</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States, after successfully
persuading the Soviet Union to lower its emigration barriers, is
trying to deal with the rising tide of Jewish emigres.
   The backlog of 35,000 Soviet Jews seeking entry to the United
States poses economic and philosophic problems. After encouraging
Moscow to lower barriers to emigration, it would be awkward for the
United States to restrict admission.
   A total of 22,462 Soviet immigrants _ not all of them Jews _
entered the United States in a nine-month period that ended June 30,
according to the State Department.
   Figures released Tuesday night showed a steep increase over a
four-year period: from 640 in 1985 to 20,421 in 1988.
   Under consideration to deal with the increase, a U.S. official
said Tuesday, is a six-month waiting period for emigres who don't
have close relatives in the United States.
   There also is a proposal to process refugees in Moscow, phasing
out the Vienna offices through which many of the emigres pass.
Processing the emigres in Moscow would mean the addition of dozens
of U.S. workers there to handle paperwork.
   But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, stressed
that no decision had been made, although one may be imminent.
   ``We are not prepared to announce any policy decisions at this
time,'' said State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   She estimated that more than 50,000 Soviets, not all of them
Jews, would apply to emigrate to the United States this year.
   Although most Soviet Jews file applications to go to Israel, the
vast majority opt for the United States once they reach Vienna.
   That distresses the Israeli government and many of its supporters
who see in the Soviet Jewish population the last large reservoir of
potential immigrants to help build up the Jewish state.
   It isn't clear whether closing the Vienna office would have the
effect of increasing the flow to Israel. Once an emigre goes there
or to any other country it is more difficult to gain admission to
the United States.
   ``There is no consensus at the State Department to close the door
on anyone,'' the official said, disputing a published report that
Soviet Jews who don't have close relatives in the United States
would become ineligible.
   However, the official said, they could be kept on hold for six
months in the Soviet Union. Those who didn't gain entry might apply
for parole status, which requires support from private organizations.
   Meanwhile, Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said the FBI
had expressed concern that a large influx of Soviet emigres could
increase the likelihood of spying.
   Although there have been discussions about curbing Soviet
immigration, ``the Justice Department has not signed off on any
proposal at this time,'' he said.

<HEAD>Navy Report Unable to Cite Cause of Blast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy is unable to cite a specific reason
for the explosion that killed 47 sailors aboard the USS Iowa, and is
expected to point only to the ``probability'' that human
intervention could have caused the tragedy, Defense Department
officials say.
   Three Navy admirals _ including the service's No. 2 man _ are
slated to release the report Thursday.
   The study wraps up the investigation into the April 19 explosion
in the battleship's No. 2 gun turret, which occurred during open
seas gunnery practice near Puerto Rico.
   Defense Department officials, speaking privately, say the report
is not expected to point to a single cause of the blast.
Investigators were hampered by the fact that no eyewitnesses
survived.
   ``There is no specific cause cited,'' said one official, who
spoke on condition his name not be used. ``It's very complicated,
and the report goes into a considerable amount of detail. It's very
complex.''
   Another official, who also spoke on background, said the report
``cites a probability'' that human action, calculated or otherwise,
could have caused the explosion.
   ``When they can't find a mechanical reason in an investigation,
they look to see whether there was a human factor involved,'' the
second official said.
   That official said investigators tried to look at all the
circumstances that could have led to the explosion, but that none
appears to have been the overriding reason for the disaster.
   The Naval Investigative Service launched a criminal investigation
into the allegations of murder and sabotage, but failed to come up
with any solid conclusions, and will instead provide a summary of
the evidence compiled through interviews, statements and other
research, the official said.
   The official said the report will show a number of ``lapses in
procedures,'' involving maintenance and the certification of sailors
to operate the ship's complex guns.
   But such problems were discounted as the primary causes of the
explosion, both officials said.
   At his daily briefing, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the
1,100-page report will be discussed by the Vice Chief of Naval
Operations Adm. Leon Edney and the investigating officer, Rear Adm.
Richard Milligan at a formal Pentagon briefing Thursday.
   ``It will be a very thorough briefing,'' Williams said.
   The two admirals will be joined by the head of the NIS, Rear Adm.
William Schachte.
   The long-awaited study has been the subject of much speculation,
including numerous television and newspaper reports.
   Officially, the Navy has withheld comment on the investigation,
as reports contended investigators were looking into the possibility
that suicide or murder was involved in the explosion.
   Gunner's mate 3rd Class Kendall Truitt, one of 11 sailors in the
base of the seven-story turret who survived but did not witness the
blast, has charged the Navy with leaking reports that it was
investigating his relationship with gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig,
who died in the explosion.
   Truitt has said the investigators suggested he'd had a sexual
relationship with Hartwig, or that Hartwig had committed suicide
after the two had had a falling-out.
   Truitt's lawyer, Ellis Rubin, has charged that the report ``will
find that there was defective equipment in gun turret No.2,'' as
well as unqualified personnel manning the guns.
   ``The report will hint at the possibility, through circumstantial
evidence, that gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig could have committed
suicide. I trust that the report will clear Kendall Truitt of any
prior knowledge or responsibility for the blast, whether he was
accused officially or not,'' Rubin said.

   Injury and damage claims are generally lower in
larger cars and vans, an insurance industry study has found.
   The Highway Loss Data Institute study released Tuesday said the
vehicles with the best results in both injury and damage claims were
the Pontiac Safari station wagon, the Plymouth Grand Voyager, the
Dodge Grand Caravan, the Mercury Grand Marquis station wagon and the
Ford Crown Victoria station wagon,
   Vehicles with the worst records had more than double the losses
of those with the best records, with damage results varying more
than injury results.
   Cars with the worst claim records in both categories were the
Isuzu I-Mark two-door, Ford Escort two-door and EXP and three
Mitsubishi models: Cordia, Mirage and Tredia, the institute said.
   ``Large domestic cars typically have good results for both injury
and vehicle damage. Small cars have poor results for injury and
damage,'' said Brian O'Neill, president of the institute, noting
that European models tend to have low injury results but high damage.
   The study measured how likely a particular car model is to be
involved in an injury accident and how costly damage to the vehicle
is when compared with the average likelihood of injury or damage for
all cars on the road.
   The results are adjusted for the number of cars of each model on
the road, for possible distortion due to driver age and for
variations in the deductible amount on insurance policies, the
institute said.
   No actual damage or injury claims figures are provided.
   O'Neill said the report covered 1986, 1987 and 1988 models, but
provides consumers with a guide to the loss potential of 1989 and
1990 model cars with no significant design changes because results
have proved to be consistent from one model year to another.
   The institute is a non-profit, public service organization funded
by the insurance industry and closely associated with the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety.
   The Mercedes-Benz SDL-SEL, for the second consecutive year, had
the best injury loss record, followed by the Saab 9000. Both cars,
however, showed much higher than average collision damage losses.
   Other cars with the best injury records included the Mercedes
560SL, Pontiac Safari Wagon, the Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser, the
Jaguar XJ6, the BMW 500 series, the Mercedes 260E-300D-E, the
Plymouth Grand Voyager, and the Dodge Grand Caravan. All had records
at least 43 percent below the average.
   Cars with the worst injury records were the Hyundai Excel
four-door, the Isuzu I-Mark two-door, the Chevrolet Sprint two-door,
the Chevrolet Spectrum four-door and two-door, the Ford Escort
two-door, the Mitsubishi Cordia and Mirage, the Yugo and the Hyundai
Excel.
   Vehicles with the best damage cost averages were the GMC Safari
Van and the nearly identical Chevrolet Astro Van, the Dodge Caravan
and Grand Caravan and the similar Plymouth Voyager and Grand
Voyager, the Pontiac Safari Wagon, the Mercury Grand Marquis and the
Chevrolet Caprice.
   Cars with the worst vehicle damage results included the
Volkswagen Scirocco, the Plymouth Conquest, the Porshe 944 Coupe,
the BMW 300 Series two-door, the Mitsubishi Cordia, the Chevrolet
Corvette, the Toyota Supra, the Nissan 300ZX, the Saab 900, the
Mazda RX-7 and MX-6.
   O'Neill said the study is based on examination of insurance
coverage and claim data involving millions of vehicles.

the United States of America, based on material from the American
Council for Drug Education, the National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse, the Urban Institute, the Justice Department, the House Select
Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, the Encyclopedia Americana
and The Wilson Quarterly.

   HOW MANY=
   _Some 72 million Americans, 37 percent of the population age 12
or older, have used illegal drugs at least once.
   _An estimated 14.5 million people had used illegal drugs within a
month of being asked last year.
   _About 21 million Americans have tried cocaine; 3 million still
use it occasionally and 1 million report being heavy users.

   WHO=
   _About 75 percent of illegal drug users are white.
   _Women constitute 41 percent of drug users, including 5 million
women of childbearing ages.
   _Eleven percent of babies born last year were exposed to illegal
drugs during the mother's pregnancy.
   _More than half those arrested for serious crimes in 14 major
cities, and who volunteered for drug testing, were found to be drug
users. In Philadelphia the figure was 82 percent.

   THE COST=
   _Cocaine-induced deaths totaled 1,696 last year, up from 604 in
1984.
   _Among the victims of cocaine have been comedian John Belushi and
basketball star Len Bias.
   _Hospital emergency rooms treated 46,020 cocaine users last year,
up from 8,831 in 1984.
   _Drug-related absenteeism and medical expenses cost businesses
about 3 percent of their payroll.
   _More than 6 million people are estimated to need treatment for
drug abuse problems, including 1.3 million intravenous drug users.
   _The Justice Department charged that a group of banks involved in
laundering money for drug dealers was sending $1.2 billion annually
to Colombian drug traffickers. The Drug Enforcement Administration,
however, says no estimate of the total value of the illicit drug
trade has been made.

<TEXT>
   THE DRUGS=
   _A California survey found that the purity of cocaine sold on the
street increased between 29 percent and 73 percent between 1982 and
1984 and has remained at the higher level since then. The price has
gone down in the meantime to under $100 per gram of the deadlier
drug.

percent of college students said they had used cocaine.
   _Occasional drug use by college students has declined from 17
percent two years ago 10 percent now.
   A survey of 9th and 10th graders in poorer Washington D.C.
neighborhood schools found that 28 percent carried a concealed
weapon and 13 percent admitted selling drugs.

   _Opium has been used for medical purposes for thousands of years,
but became popular for psychological effects in the 1700s.
   _By 1900 opiates were sold over the counter and as many as one in
400 Americans were using them regularly. Laudanum, a tincture of
opium, was popular with women as a medication.
   _In 1885 one major manufacturer was selling cocaine in 15
different forms including cigarettes, cigars, inhalants, a cordial,
crystals and a solution for injection.
   _Restrictions were imposed in 1914. A substitute offered was
heroin, which only later was found to be addictive.
   _``The illicit sale of (cocaine) ... and the habitual use of it
temporarily raises the power of the criminal to a point where in
resisting arrest there is no hesitation to murder: It is more
appalling in its effect than any other habit-forming drug used in
the United States.'' From a statement to Congress by President
William Howard Taft, 1910.

<HEAD>Schools Must Have Firm Drug Policies or Lose Aid</HEAD>

   Schools, colleges and universities stand to
lose federal aid unless they prove they have tough anti-drug use
policies with stiff penalties for use, sale or distribution of
illicit drugs.
   The anti-drug strategy unveiled by President Bush on Tuesday
night also would pay for altenative schools for youths with drug
habits and encourage states to declare schools as drug-free zones.
   Colleges and universities already have conditions for receiving
federal aid. New laws require them to ensure that illegal drugs are
not being used by employees on the job, and to have student-aid
recipients certify that they do not use drugs.
   The new strategy drafted by William Bennett, director of the
National Drug Control Policy Office, would require colleges to
develop specific punishments for students who use illegal drugs. The
plans will be required as a condition for any federal aid, including
grants and contracts as well as student aid.
   ``This is the primary goal of prevention: to see to it that
Americans _ especially school children _ never start down a slippery
slope of drug use that begins with `experimentation' but can
culminate in dependency,'' according to the drug strategy document.
``For those school children and adults who have already begun to use
drugs, the goal is a rather different one: to get them to stop.''
   Elementary and secondary schools would lose federal aid if they
failed to implement specific punishments for students caught
possessing, using or selling drugs.
   American schools have been educating students about drugs for
more than 20 years. Statistics show that about 99 percent of high
schools and 87 percent of elementary schools offer anti-drug
lessons, and even some kindergartens offer them.
   But the national drug strategy stressed that school-based
prevention programs should be reinforced by tough but fair school
policies on use, possession and distribution of drugs.
   Voicing his support for Bush's ``clear, tough blueprint for a
drug-free nation,'' Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos urged
educators and parents to ``resolve to eliminate once and for all
this threat to American education.''
   Keith Geiger, new president of the National Education
Association, agreed that Bush ``laid out a challenge for all of us''
and stressed that ``we're ready to work.''
   ``In general, (the proposal was) certainly well intentioned and
means to do the right thing but is not adequate to meet the
problem,'' said Lou Nayman of the American Federation of Teachers.
``It spoke to the goals, the kinds of things that need to be
accomplished but really did not supply any significant resources to
match the objectives.''
   Bennett singled out the ``simple and straightforward'' Anne
Arundel County, Md., drug policies that immediately expel any
student caught selling or distributing drugs. When a student is
caught using or possessing drugs, the school notifies the police,
calls his parents, and suspends him for one to five days.
   The Education Department has $354.5 million budgeted for drug
prevention programs in the current fiscal year, with 83 percent
going for state and local programs. That compares with only $3
million budgeted for drug education in 1986.
   In the next fiscal year, the administration is seeking $25
million more for emergency drug education grants, intended for urban
areas with major drug problems.
   The new strategy will encourage states to enact legislation that
protects schools as drug-free zones. About 14 states have failed to
propose or pass such legislation, said the document.
   Last year, New Jersey's drug-free school zones resulted in
arrests of 8,800 people statewide.
   The plan is for all public and private schools to become
drug-free zones where dealers and users caught on school grounds
will face penalties of five years for possession, and up to 40 years
and fines of $40,000 for distribution.

   Here are excerpts from the text of President
Bush's speech announcing a $7.9 billion war on drugs.
   
   This is the first time since taking the oath of office that I
felt an issue was so important, so threatening, that it warranted
talking directly with you, the American people. ...
   Drugs have strained our faith in our system of justice. Our
courts, our prisons, our legal system are stretched to the breaking
point. The social costs of drugs are mounting. ...
   Who's responsible? ... Everyone who uses drugs. Everyone who
sells drugs. And everyone who looks the other way. ...
   In 1985, the government estimated that 23 million Americans were
using drugs on a ``current'' basis _ that is, at least once in the
preceding month.
   Last year, that number fell by more than a third. That means
almost 9 million fewer Americans are casual drug users. ... Because
we changed our national attitude toward drugs, casual drug use has
declined.
   ... There is also bad news _ very bad news. Roughly 8 million
people have used cocaine in the past year, almost 1 million of them
used it frequently once a week or more.
   ... To win that war against addictive drugs like crack will take
more than just a federal strategy. It will take a national strategy,
one that reaches into every school, every workplace, involving every
family.
   Earlier today, I sent ... our first such national strategy to the
Congress. ... Tonight, I'm announcing a strategy that reflects the
coordinated, cooperative commitment of all federal agencies. ... Our
weapons in this strategy are: the law and criminal justice system,
our foreign policy, our treatment systems, and our schools and drug
prevention programs.
   ... Let me address four of the major elements of our strategy.
   First, we are determined to enforce the law, to make our streets
and neighborhoods safe. So to start, I'm proposing that we more than
double federal assistance to state and local law enforcement.
   ... I am also proposing that we enlarge our criminal justice
system across the board _ at the local, state and federal levels
alike. We need more prisons, more jails, more courts, more
prosecutors. ... I'm requesting _ altogether _ an almost
billion-and-a-half dollar increase in drug-related federal spending
on law enforcement.
   And while illegal drug use is found in every community, nowhere
is it worse than in our public housing projects. ... That is why I'm
targeting $50 million to fight crime in public housing projects _ to
help restore order, and to kick out the dealers for good.
   The second element of our strategy looks beyond our borders. ...
In Colombia alone, cocaine killers have gunned down a leading
statesman, murdered almost 200 judges and seven members of their
supreme court. ...
   But you and I agree with the courageous president of Colombia,
Virgilio Barco, who said that if Americans use cocaine, then
Americans are paying for murder. .... The $65 million emergency
assistance announced two weeks ago was just our first step in
assisting the Andean nations in their fight against the cocaine
cartels. ...
   Our strategy allocates more than a quarter of a billion dollars
for next year in military and law enforcement assistance for ...
Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. This will be the first part of a
five-year, $2 billion program to counter the producers, the
traffickers and the smugglers.
   I spoke with President Barco last week, and we hope to meet with
the leaders of affected countries in an unprecedented drug summit.
... I'm also asking the Senate to ratify the U.N. Anti-Drug
Convention concluded last December.
   To stop these drugs on the way to America, I propose that we
spend more than an billion-and-a-half dollars on interdiction.
   Our message to the drug cartels is this: The rules have changed.
We will help any government that wants our help. When requested, we
will for the first time make available the appropriate resources, of
America's armed forces. We will intensify our efforts against drug
smugglers on the high seas, in international airspace and at our
borders.
   We will stop the flow of chemicals from the United States used to
process drugs. We will pursue and enforce international agreements
to track drug money to the front men and financiers.
   And then we will handcuff these money launderers, and jail them _
just like any street dealers. And for drug kingpins, the death
penalty.
   The third part of our strategy concerns drug treatment. Experts
believe that there are 2 million American drug users who may be able
to get off drugs with proper treatment. But right now, only 40
percent of them are actually getting help. ... I'm proposing an
increase of $321 million in federal spending on drug treatment. ...
   Fourth, we must stop illegal drug use before it starts. ... I am
proposing a quarter-of-a-billion-dollar increase in federal funds
for school and community prevention programs that help young people
and adults reject enticements to try drugs. ... Every school,
college and university _ and every workplace _ must adopt tough but
fair policies about drug use by students and employees. Those that
will not adopt such policies will not get federal funds. Period.
   ... As you can tell, such an approach will not come cheaply. Last
February, I asked for a $700 million increase in the drug budget for
the coming year. Over the past six months of careful study, we have
found an immediate need for another billion-and-a-half dollars. With
this added $2.2 billion, our 1990 drug budget totals almost $8
billion _ the largest increase in history.
   ... The next fiscal year begins just 26 days from now. So
tonight, I'm asking the Congress ... to help us move it forward
immediately.
   We can pay for this fight against drugs without raising taxes or
adding to the budget deficit. ... To start, Congress needs not only
to act on this national drug strategy, but also to act on our crime
package announced last May; a package to toughen sentences, to beef
up law enforcement and build new prison space for 24,000 inmates.
... The states need to match tougher federal laws with tougher laws
of their own _ stiffer bail, probation, parole and sentencing.
   And we need your help. If people you know are users, help them
get off drugs. If you are a parent, talk to your children about
drugs. ... If we fight this war as a divided nation, then the war is
lost. But if we face this evil as a nation united, this will be
nothing but a handful of useless chemicals.
   Victory. Victory over drugs is our cause, a just cause, and with
your help, we are going to win.

   The following outlines components of President

strategy include:
   _ $350 million for states and local governments for criminal
justice, law enforcement and prison systems.
   _ $1.2 billion for construction of federal prisons.
   _ Requiring federally acceptable drug prevention programs and
policies as a condition to receive federal funds for schools and
colleges.
   _ Withholding federal criminal justice funds from states that do
not have drug testing for prisoners, parolees and people arrested,
and consider test results when determining sentencing, bail and
parole.
   _ $261 million to help the Andean countries of Peru, Bolivia and
Colombia fight drug lords.
   _ More money for domestic eradication efforts.
   _ Tougher regulations for federal housing projects to expedite
evictions of drug dealers, and expand drug prevention programs for
resident associations.
   _ Urges greater use of employee drug testing in state and local
government and the private sector.
   _ Encourages stiffer penalties for drug users.
   _ More federal money for community drug prevention efforts.
   _ Increased money for treatment programs to expand the number of
people who can be treated, the range of treatment programs, and
emphasize treatment for pregnant women who use drugs.
   _ Making receipt of federal treatment funds contingent on state
and local compliance with federal standards for effective drug
treatment programs.
   _ Expanded research and information coordination to evaluate and
develop more effective treatments.
   _ Greater border interdiction emphasis on drug-detection dogs,
document fraud, container inspection and other methods.
   _ More emphasis on air interdiction, and catching drug couriers
and money launderers.

<HEAD>Bush's Anti-Drug Plan Urges Crackdown on Casual Users</HEAD>

   Casual drug users could lose their cars, be
fired from their jobs, pay stiff fines, or suffer the embarrassment
of having their names published in the newspaper in an anti-drug
society envisioned by President Bush.
   Bush, in an national drug strategy announced Tuesday night,
called for more spending on law enforcement and drug treatment,
education and prevention. He also earmarked $261 million next year
to go after drug kingpins in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, the
beginning of a $2 billion installment over five years.
   But he also urged a crackdown on users, including non-addicts who
take drugs for so-called recreational purposes.
   ``American cocaine users need to understand that our nation has
zero tolerance for casual drug use,'' Bush said in his nationally
televised address.
   He said the government will withhold federal funds from schools
and colleges that don't have federally acceptable drug education and
prevention policies.
   Many components in Bush's drug strategy are merely
recommendations. Others include federal funding proposals.
   Among the principal spending plans outlined for fiscal year 1990:
   _ $350 million for law enforcement grants to cities and states, a
$200 million increase over the current authorization. To get the
money, states must impose drug testing for arrestees, prisoners,
parolees and those out on bail.
   _ $1.2 billion for construction of new federal prisons. That
money was already included in the crime package proposal he sent to
Congress earlier this year, and is included in an overall $1.6
billion figure for federal corrections spending.
   _ $925 million for drug abuse treatment, a 53 percent increase
from the current year's $604 million authorization.
   _ $1.2 billion for prevention and education efforts, 25 percent
over the current authorization of $943 million.
   _ $261 million for military and law enforcement aid for the three
South American countries that are the principal producers of
cocaine, more than four times the approximately $53 million they get
in the current budget.
   Total foreign aid to those countries, including the anti-drug
money, is almost $163 million in 1989. The $261 million is part of a
total $449 million to include economic aid that Bush proposes for
international anti-drug efforts.
   The 1990 proposal does not include the $65 million in military
aid Bush ordered for Colombia last month. The $2 billion envisioned
for the three countries over a five-year period will be conditioned
on evaluation of their efforts to quash the drug lords, said
national drug policy coordinator William Bennett.
   _ $250 million for courts, correctional institutions and
alternatives to jail and prison, such as boot camps and house arrest.
   The total $7.9 billion package also includes $3 billion for
border interdiction and other efforts including a campaign against
money-laundering.
   Marijuana eradication efforts would be doubled from $8 million to
$16 million.
   Giving a Democratic response to Bush's plan, Sen. Joseph Biden,
D-Del., said ``the president's plan is not tough enough, bold
enough'' to deal with the drug problems. He accused Bush of trying
to fight the drug wars ``on the cheap.''
   The numbers in the 154-page strategy reflect authorization
figures, not money that actually will be spent, and they do not
indicate where that money will come from. For example, because
prisons take a long time to build, only a small portion of the $1.2
billion for prisons will be spent in 1990.
   Bush is calling on the states to stiffen penalties for users.
   Bennett explained the philosophy, saying, ``Where this country
got off track in the late 60s and 70s was believing the only people
worthy of attention were the major traffickers and kingpins, and not
the individual users.''
   ``You can exercise sanctions without putting people in jail,''
Bennett said. ``You can take away their drivers' licenses, you can
fine them, you can take away their automobiles if they're using
their automobiles to hide drugs or to store drugs. You can notify
their employers. Employers can fire them.''
   Bush's strategy advocates imposition of such actions, as well as
publishing convicted drug users' names in newspapers.
   For the most hardened drug traffickers, Bush renewed his
endorsement of the death penalty.
   Other components include:
   _ Tougher regulations for federal housing projects to expedite
evictions of drug dealers and expand drug prevention programs for
resident associations.
   _ Urging greater use of employee drug testing in state and local
government and the private sector.
   _ More federal money for community drug prevention efforts.
   _ Expanded research and information coordination to evaluate and
develop more effective treatments.

<HEAD>More Signs That High-Fiber Diets Protect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high-fiber diet appears to inhibit the growth
of rectal polyps in people with an inherited tendency toward such
polyps that can lead to cancer, according to results of a four-year
study.
   A team from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York
and Cornell University Medical College selected 58 study subjects
from patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, an inherited
disorder characterized by a large number of polyps in the colon that
almost always will progress to cancer without treatment.
   The patients had had the colon _ the large bowel _ removed.
   The report appearing Tuesday in the Journal of the National
Cancer Institute used statistics to show that ``the ratio of rectal
polyps to baseline was uniformly negatively correlated with high
fiber'' _ that is, the higher the fiber, the fewer the polyps.
   Rectal polyps frequently decline spontaneously after removal of
the large bowel in this disorder.
   Members of the high fiber-group consumed an average of 22 grams
of fiber a day, about twice what is contained in an average diet,
through the inclusion of special cereals in their diet. Only about
10 percent of the population normally includes this much fiber.
   Several studies have suggested that high-fiber, low-fat diets
might protect against cancer of the rectum and the bowel. Studies
that follow patients on a prescribed diet for a long period _ four
years for the NCI group _ are rare, however.
   ``The results reported by these investigators are encouraging for
the management not only of patients with familial adenomatous
polyposis, but also others at risk of developing colorectal cancer,
the second most frequent cause of cancer mortality in the United
States,'' said an editorial in the journal.
   The researchers said it was not known whether the protective
effect of grain fiber might also work in patients at risk for
non-inherited polyps. ``Enough correspondences exist between the two
conditions to warrant active inquiry,'' their report said.
   The pre-cancerous benign tumors that develop in the two forms of
the disease are indistinguishable, noted the team of researchers led
by Jerome J. DeCosse.

<HEAD>Bush to Name Conservative Democrat as New Negotiator</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush will name James Woolsey Jr., a
conservative Democrat and weapons specialist, as the new U.S.
negotiator in 23-nation talks to reduce non-nuclear forces in
Europe, an official says.
   Security checks have begun on Woolsey, a lawyer chosen over two
other candidates, the official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said Tuesday.
   The other candidates were Stephen Ledogar, a career diplomat who
now holds the job, and Philip Karber, vice president of the BDM
Corp., the official said.
   The negotiations resume Thursday in Vienna between the 16-nation
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the seven-nation Warsaw Pact.
Ledogar, who was appointed by President Reagan in 1987 to help
arrange the talks, will remain in the post for the time being.
   Another official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Tuesday evening that NATO would press hard in Vienna for a treaty
provision for the stationing of monitors in the two alliance areas
across Europe.
   The Washington Post said in today's editions that the proposal
would mean inspection of virtually every military installation from
the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains dividing the European and
Asian parts of the Soviet Union.
   The official also said NATO was considering a proposal for the
expansion of the existing East-West requirements that each side
notify the other of certain military maneuvers, but questions
remained unsettled about what equipment should be covered by the
notice requirement and how big a maneuver area should be specified.
   Some compromises may have to be made on several questions.
   ``We don't want to table something and then have a squabble
within NATO ranks,'' the official said.
   Bush has raised expectations of an accord by the end of the year,
but that appears only a long-shot possibility.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler declined to assess
the prospects. She said Secretary of State James A. Baker III had
met Friday and Tuesday with aides to prepare for the resumption of
negotiations.
   The process of nominating Woolsey and having him confirmed by the
Senate could take several weeks.
   Woolsey, 48, has a reputation for political skill as well as
weapons expertise. He has close ties with Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, while retaining the
trust of defense-minded Republicans.
   He was undersecretary of the Navy in the Carter administration,
has served on the staffs of the National Security Council and the
Senate Armed Services Committee and has worked at the Pentagon.
   As an occasional adviser to the Reagan administration, Woolsey
joined with Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser, in
recommending development of the Midgetman missile, a mobile,
single-warhead long-range nuclear weapon.
   In April, Bush decided to proceed with a plan to buy and deploy
300 to 500 of the missiles on trucks and proposed that 50 MX
missiles housed in underground silos be put on rail cars.
   The cost of the two programs, if Congress provides the funds,
could exceed $40 billion.

<HEAD>Bush Cites Case of Maryland Boy in Drug Speech</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is promising a 6-year-old
Maryland boy named Dooney that he won't have to be a drug dealer
when he grows up.
   ``Not long ago, I read a newspaper story about a little boy named
Dooney, who, until recently, lived in a crack house in a suburb of
Washington, D.C.,'' Bush said Tuesday in a televised address on his
national drug strategy. ``In Dooney's neighborhood, children don't
flinch at the sound of gunfire. And when they play, they pretend to
sell to each other small white rocks they call crack.
   ``Life at home was so cruel that Dooney begged his teachers to
let him sleep on the floor at school. And, when asked about his
future, 6-year-old Dooney answers, `I don't want to sell drugs, but
I will probably have to.'''
   Bush, after outlining his anti-drug plan, declared: ``Dooney does
not have to sell drugs. No child in America should have to live like
this.''
   Dooney Waters was the subject of a Washington Post series in July
that detailed the fear and filth he lived in with his drug-addicted
mother.
   ``My mother don't take care of me,'' Dooney told the Post. ``All
she want is drugs.''
   The Post stories told how Dooney had to fend for himself in a
home where drugs users slept, dealers made their sales and police
made arrests. A reporter and photographer from the Post spent two
months observing Dooney's life.
   Before the series ran, Dooney's 32-year-old mother, Addie L.
Waters, checked into a treatment program to kick her drug habit and
the boy went to live with his father.

<HEAD>Half Could be Helped by Treatment, Administration Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 4 million Americans use illegal
drugs more than 200 times each year, and half are good candidates
for professional treatment, the Bush administration says.
   The national drug control strategy unveiled Tuesday calls for a
53 percent increase in federal funds for drug treatment _ from $604
million in the current budget to $925 million in the next fiscal
year.
   The federal funds, added to expected state and local
contributions, would increase the number of treatment slots from
324,000 to 650,000 to 700,000, said drug czar William Bennett.
   About 1 million people with serious drug problems could kick
their habits on their own, or with the help of friends, family and
clergy, according to the strategy.
   ``Another million are so addicted, so inclined this way, no
treatment and no kind of therapy is going to help them,'' Bennett
said.
   The strategy also calls for increasing the number of people
getting treatment by urging states to ``consider expanding the use
of `civil commitment' whereby addicts convicted of criminal offenses
are sent by the courts to treatment facilities, in lieu of or in
addition to incarceration.''
   ``Research indicates that voluntary and involuntary treatment
patients do equally well.''
   Only about 40 percent of those with the best chance of benefiting
from drug treatment actually received such help in 1987, the
strategy document said.
   One of the problems with treatment is the lack of help available
for cocaine addicts.
   ``Currently there are no proven successful treatment strategies
comparable to those for heroin addiction,'' the strategy said.

   The Department of Energy may be setting a
time-consuming precedent by asking for an environmental impact study
before the Shoreham nuclear power plant can be closed, a nuclear
watchdog group says.
   ``If the state of New York is required to submit a full EIS for
the dismantling of Shoreham, a plant which has operated for less
than 30 hours, a precedent would be established under which the
nation's nuclear utilities may likewise be required to submit full
EIS's for the decommissioning of their nuclear power plants, some of
which have operated for more than 10,000 hours,'' Public Citizen
said in a letter Tuesday to Energy Secretary James Watkins.
   The group was founded by consumer activist Ralph Nader. In July,
Watkins called for a full environmental review of the plan to close
Shoreham, which could delay its decommissioning by several years.

<TEXT>
   Along Blue Hill Avenue, where crack dealers openly
sell their wares and women stake out corners to sell their bodies
for drugs, cynicism was rampant as President Bush announced his $7.9
billion plan to fight drugs.
   ``It won't make any difference down here,'' said E.Z. Ty, 21, who
interrupted a conversation on a dingy corner in the Roxbury
neighborhood to say he sells crack.
   ``Drugs is very heavy down here. And you know why? McDonald's
doesn't pay anything. Cocaine is here to stay. It's not going
anywhere.''
   While he spoke, Ty, who wore heavy gold jewelry around his neck,
reached under his sweatshirt to flash a chrome-plated revolver stuck
in his waistband.
   ``It's bull,'' added 29-year-old Ronald Gardner, who said he uses
and sells drugs. ``They're not going to get rid of it. No way.''
   Farther up the avenue of dirty vacant lots and boarded up
storefronts, two members of the Humboldt Raiders gang, which police
said is known for drug dealing, declared Bush's anti-drug plan
pointless. The two wore fancy sweatsuits and heavy gold medallions.
   ``I think it's crazy,'' said Huckleberry Ross, 18. ``They ought
to go right to Colombia and do something. It won't do any good to
get rid of it here. You won't keep the gangs from selling it.''
   Ross' friend and fellow gang member, 19-year-old Tyrone Stevens,
said the White House should focus on providing more educational
opportunities for blacks to help keep them away from drugs.
   ``They say they're going to spend money to fight drugs but at the
same time they're taking money out of our public schools,'' said
Stevens, referring to the recent closure of several Boston public
schools. ``We can't get no education so we all do what we know best
_ try and make money off drugs.''
   Three young boys walking down Blue Hill Avenue who said they run
drugs for dealers were as pessimistic as the others.
   ``The gangsters all want to make money, it's bad,'' said Jerry
Tyler, 14. ``The only way they (the Bush administration) will do any
good is to pay them off with more money.''
   About a mile down the street, 37-year-old Billy Bush sat among a
group of men outside a convenience store and questioned the
president's plan.
   ``There ain't nothing he can do about the ghetto,'' said the
occasional sandblaster who acknowledged being a cocaine and heroin
user. ``He can't win. There's 10 times more crack down here than
heroin. They stopped heroin a little bit but they'll never stop
crack.''
   As he spoke, he gestured to a young woman standing on a nearby
corner waving at cars.
   ``See, women in the ghetto are selling themselves for base,'' he
said. ``Blacks are suffering because they're strung out on base.
There ain't nothing these guys can do. They can't infiltrate the
ghetto.''
   The conversation ended abruptly when an incoherent friend of his
approached and tussled with an AP photographer, tearing her strobe
light from her grasp and running away.

<HEAD>Hollywood Concludes Record-Setting Summer With $2 Billion in Ticket
Sales</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With a record $2.05 billion in ticket sales,
Hollywood posted its best summer ever mainly on the strength of such
films as ``Batman'' and the family comedies ``Honey, I Shrunk the
Kids'' and ``Parenthood.''
   Memorial Day to Labor Day box-office revenues were up 20 percent
from last summer's record of $1.7 billion, with ``Batman'' emerging
as at least the sixth most successful film in movie history on
ticket sales in excess of $240 million.
   The top five movies alone combined for more than $750 million in
sales, according to figures released Tuesday.
   ``Nobody in the business can predict how big a movie goes once it
goes big,'' Rob Friedman, president of worldwide advertising and
publicity for Warner Bros., said of ``Batman's'' spectacular summer.
``Did we know `Batman' was going to be a big movie? Yes. Did we know
how big? You never know.''
   John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Co., which compiles
box-office figures, said that ``Batman's'' smash showing encouraged
audiences to explore the entire summer slate.
   ``And once people arrived, there was a little bit of everything
out there, great variety,'' he said.
   Among those contributing to the record season were adult
moviegoers, who in recent years have stayed at home. Although exact
figures are unavailable, it is believed older patrons boosted the
grosses of ``Dead Poets Society,'' ``Parenthood'' and ``Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids.'
   The healthy summer season makes it likely that 1989 will break
last year's record of $4.46 billion.
   Five summer movies surpassed the $100 million mark: ``Batman,''
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' ($189.5 million); ``Lethal
Weapon 2'' ($131.3 million); ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' ($119.1
million) and ``Ghostbusters II'' ($109.9 million). Their combined
$788 million accounted for 40 percent of all summer tickets sold.
   Rounding out the top 10 were ``Dead Poets Society'' ($86.4
million); ``When Harry Met Sally ...'' ($66.6 million);
``Parenthood'' ($64.1 million); ``Turner &amp; Hooch'' ($57.1 million)
and ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' ($50.5 million).
   Among the high-powered flops were Clint Eastwood's ``Pink
Cadillac'' ($12.1 million); Sylvester Stallone's ``Lock Up'' ($19
million); Michael J. Fox's and Sean Penn's ``Casualties of War''
($14 million) and Dennis Quaid's ``Great Balls of Fire'' ($13.7
million).
   Several industry observers have pointed out that the summer
record was sparked by higher ticket prices, with some theaters in
New York and Los Angeles charging $7 for single admissions.
   But, the studios counter, today's movies must struggle for
audiences in a more competitive marketplace, fighting the broad
appeal of pay cable television and videocassette rentals.
   Among the studios, Warner Bros. led all comers during the summer,
with its ``Batman'' and ``Lethal Weapon 2'' helping the studio
account for 24 percent of all tickets sold.
   Disney, with no sequels and no over-publicized epics, quietly
claimed the No. 2 spot with its ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' and
``Dead Poets Society.''
   Among the major studios, Tri-Star and MGM-UA had the most
miserable summers, finishing last and next-to-last, respectively.

   An attorney for Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk
said Tuesday new evidence that could help his client has been found
in a garbage bin at the U.S. Justice Department, and he asked for a
delay of at least six months in the case.
   Attorney Yoram Sheftel accused people in the department of
concealing the evidence, which he said includes testimony
contradicting court rulings Demjanjuk was responsible for gassing to
death hundreds of thousands of Jews in World War II.
   Demjanjuk, 69, a retired auto worker from a Cleveland suburb, was
found guilty by an Israeli court in April 1988 of crimes against
humanity and crimes against the Jewish people and sentenced to death.
   His appeal was scheduled to be heard starting Nov. 1. In court
petitions, Sheftel asked for a delay of at least six months, citing
documents he said were found in a garbage bin at the Justice
Department's Office of Special Investigations. The office probes
suspected Nazi war criminals.
   The Israeli attorney accused the office of ``concealing important
evidence on the one hand and falsifying other evidence'' in
proceedings that stripped Demjanjuk of U.S. citizenship in 1981,
paving the way for his extradition to Israel five years later.
   There was no comment from the office. A spokesman in Washington
did not immediately return a phone call from The Associated Press.
   Demjanjuk's trial was Israel's first of an accused war criminal
in 25 years.
   Witnesses identified him as a sadistic guard known as ``Ivan the
Terrible'' who switched on the gas chambers at the Treblinka death
camp in Nazi-occupied Poland, where 850,000 Jews perished between
1942 and 1943.
   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk claimed to be a victim of mistaken
identity.
   Sheftel said in a telephone interview that the documents found
were ``of decisive importance to the results of the appellant's
trial'' because they challenge important testimony identifying
Demjanjuk as Ivan.
   He said one document shows that a key witness, former Nazi prison
guard Otto Horn, failed to identify Demjanjuk in a photo lineup.
During the trial, the court was told Horn did identify him.
   Another document would appear to challenge whether a witness at a
1980 trial to strip Demjanjuk of U.S. citizenship recognized
Demjanjuk in a photo from a Nazi identification card, the attorney
said. The card was a key piece of evidence in the trial.

   ``Uncle Buck,'' starring John Candy as an
obnoxious relative taking care of his two nieces and a nephew, was
the best box office ticket during the holiday weekend. ``Casualties
of War'' dropped out of the top 10.
   ``Uncle Buck'' held the top spot for the third-straight weekend,
this time on sales of $7.8 million, according to Exhibitor Relations
Co.
   In second place was ``Parenthood'' with $7.5 million. It was
followed in third by the underwater action film ``The Abyss,'' with
$5.5 million.
   ``Lethal Weapon 2,'' the action sequel reuniting Mel Gibson and
Danny Glover, was fourth with $4.7 million. In fifth with $4 million
was the romantic comedy ``When Harry Met Sally...,'' starring Billy
Crystal and Meg Ryan.
   Next was the police comedy ``Turner &amp; Hooch,'' pairing Tom Hanks
with a salivating canine, which grossed $3.8 million. ``Batman''
finished in seventh, adding $3.5 million.
   The lower-case, acclaimed character study ``sex, lies and
videotape,'' which has been playing in limited release, expanded to
347 screens and boosted its income to $3.4 million for eighth place.
   Rounding out the top 10 were ``Relentless,'' the new Judd Nelson
movie, which brought in $2.8 million, and ``Honey, I Shrunk the
Kids'' with $2.7 million.
   ``Casualties of War,'' the story of a group of U.S. soldiers who
rape and murder a South Vietnamese girl during the war, has proved
to be a flop. In just its third week of release, ``Casualties of
War,'' starring Michael J. Fox and Sean Penn, took in $1.9 million.
It has grossed only $13.7 million so far and is no longer among the
top 10.
   ``Shirley Valentine'' made a strong but limited debut, collecting
$245,422 on eight screens.
   Here are the top movies for the Labor Day weekend as tallied by
Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of
screens, average per screen, total gross and weeks in release.
   1. ``Uncle Buck,'' Universal, $7.8 million, 1,832 screens, $4,270
per screen, $34.7 million, three weeks.
   2. ``Parenthood,'' Universal, $7.5 million, 1,390 screens, $5,395
per screen, $64.1 million, five weeks.
   3. ``The Abyss,'' 20th Century Fox, $5.5 million, 1,532 screens,
$3,611 per screen, $40.7 million, four weeks.
   4. ``Lethal Weapon 2,'' Warner Bros., $4.7 million, 1,613

<TEXT>
   When bombs are exploding in Bogota and
other Colombian cities, so is the multimillion-dollar security
business in this violent country.
   A car bullet-proofing plant in Bogota recently was jammed to
capacity with 20 vehicles being armored at $50,000 to $60,000 each.
   The number of security companies in the city of 6 million people
has grown to 315 from just 20 a decade ago, and that is just the
number legally registered with the Defense Ministry.
   American and Colombian businessmen are spending up to $1 million
a year for personal security, a former Colombian army major, now the
vice president of a Bogota security firm, said in an interview.
   The violence comes from many directions: leftist guerrillas,
right-wing death squads, revenge-minded drug traffickers upset with
the government's extradition plans and common criminals.
   The former army major's security company offices were buzzing at
7 a.m. one recent day.
   ``Get two more men over there! Now!'' he yelled to an assistant
who had just received a call from a customer, an American company,
for more protection.
   ``We don't have enough men to fill all the jobs we're being asked
to do'' and new business is being turned away, he said.
   He asked that he and his company not be identified because he
fears for the lives of his wife and 3-year-old daughter.
   The former major was an intelligence officer twice decorated for
leading commandos that freed kidnapped people during states of siege
in Colombia, and he has made a lot of enemies in his work against
leftist guerrillas and common criminals.
   He said there are about 2,000 bulletproof cars in Colombia, many
of them imported. Drug traffickers have bulletproof cars that are
imported with bribe payments to customs officials, he said.
   A former U.S. ambassador to Colombia, Tom Boyatt, once told an AP
reporter that it took the embassy months to import his
bullet-resistant V-8 Cadillac limousine because eight-cylinder
engines are prohibited in Colombia.
   They consume too much gas, the government decided years ago.
   At the car bullet-proofing plant, Veimas, the noise was deafening
as employees swarmed around the cars, pounding, scraping, sanding
and sawing.
   Last year the company bullet-proofed 80 cars, said an execuctive
with the company, Eugenio Villegas. Business is increasing every
year, he said.
   The cars are armored with combinations of quarter-inch steel and
woven materials. The vehicles being armored during the visit were
mostly four-wheel drive types used by security men who follow an
executive and other guards in another bullet resistant car.
   In Bogota, it is common to be forced off the road by cars crammed
with men with submachine guns, shotguns and pistols who are trying
to stay on the bumper of the car they are protecting.
   On almost every block of Bogota's wealthy neighborhoods, in the
northern area of the capital, guards can be seen on the streets, in
doorways and in cars.
   Some of the guards come from security companies that pay them the
minimum wage of about $100 a month. They typically look like
gardeners, armed with rusty, single-shot shotguns.
   Others look more professional with modern weapons.
   The 315 registered security companies in Bogota offer bodyguards
and home security systems.
   Every morning at private schools limousines pull up and the
children who get out are surrounded by burly guards.
   Women on the way to the hair salon occasionally are seen
accompanied by up to 10 men with submachine guns, shotguns and
pistols.
   A few golfers at country clubs are accompanied by men carrying
Ingram submachine guns in leather briefcases that will flop open at
the flick of a finger.
   ``It's tough to get a foursome together when your friends know
someone might start popping away at you,'' an American once told an
AP reporter who was his golf partner.

<HEAD>Study: Pill Doesn't Raise Middle Aged Women's Breast Cancer Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers found reassuring evidence that birth
control pills haven't raised the breast cancer risk for middle-age
women. Now, they are starting a major new study to see if that's
true for a younger generation.
   Birth control pills became available in the early 1960s, and
women now in their mid-40s and 50s typically began using the pill
when they were in their mid-20s or beyond.
   Since then, however, millions of American women have begun taking
the pill while still in their teens.
   Troubling data has begun to emerge that these people may be at
substantially higher than usual risk of breast cancer.
   ``It really becomes very important to either refute that or
substantiate it in a clear way, since that kind of use is routine
for a large number of women,'' said Dr. Walter Willett of the
Harvard School of Public Health. ``If there is such a risk and it
continues throughout life, that's a major problem.''
   Willett and his colleagues began mailing questionnaires this week
to about 500,000 nurses across the United States between ages 25 and
42.
   That study will be called the Nurses' Health Study II, and is a
successor to a survey of 118,273 female nurses between ages 30 and
55 that began in 1976.
   Experts say the results of the first nurses study are reassuring
for women now approaching menopause.
   ``Past use of oral contraceptives does not appear to increase the
risk of breast cancer for women in their mid-40s and 50s,'' said
Willett.
   The new study is the largest of a series of reports this year
that have provided conflicting evidence about the possible role of
the pill in triggering breast cancer.
   Breast cancer, according to the American Cancer Society, will
kill an estimated 43,000 people this year and follows lung cancer as
the leading cancer killer of American women.
   Some doctors worry that taking the pill during the early
reproductive years may somehow increase the risk. Others note that
the amount and ratio of sex hormones in birth control pills have
changed since their introduction in the early 1960s, and this might
also have made the pill more hazardous.
   ``The epidemiologists are all confused, myself included,''
commented Dr. Samuel Shapiro of Boston University's Sloan
Epidemiology Unit.
   Shapiro was a co-author of a study of pill users under age 45.
Among those who took oral contraceptives for 10 years or more, the
risk of breast cancer was increased four times.
   A study from University Hospital in Lund, Sweden, found that
women who took the pill while teen-agers in the 1960s have about
five times the usual risk of breast cancer before they reach
menopause.
   An Oxford University study of women under age 35 who had been
early pill users found a 74 percent increase in the breast cancer
risk after eight years.
   ``Our study does not directly contradict those studies,'' said
Willett. ``It raises an element of doubt about them, but there is no
strong refutation, because it's possible that the effects really are
different in very young women.''
   The newly released Harvard study was published in today's issue
of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Willett said the
massive amount of data collected provides ``a very clear and
reassuring answer to the women of the age of those participating in
the study.''
   Forty-eight percent of the women had used oral contraceptives.
While 1,799 of the total participants developed breast cancer, there
was no difference in the cancer rate between those who had taken the
pill and those who did not.
   The study found about a 50 percent increase in the risk among
women who took the pill after age 40. Willett said this was
``biologically interesting'' but ``not of great practical
importance.'' Because the pill increases the heart attack risk among
older women, they are generally urged not to use the pill after age
35.
   In recent years, birth control pills have been changed to reduce
the amount and proportions of estrogen and progestin.
   Shapiro said the latest study is reassuring for women who took
the early pills. But he added, ``The issue is, What about the
medicine that has been in use for the last 10 years? This does not
tell you very much about that. They don't have much to contribute to
what's going on at the moment.''

<DATELINE>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has called for better
coordination and advanced technology to stop the flow of cocaine,
but a new military headquarters on the battlefront shows the
limitations of the armed forces.
   Joint Task Force 4 in Key West is intended to coordinate
information not only from all branches of the military, but from the
Customs Service, the Coast Guard, the Drug Enforcement
Administration and other civilian agencies.
   But the center was forced upon a reluctant military by Congress,
which designated the Defense Department as the lead agency for drug
intelligence, and backed that up with $450 million this year.
   Much of that information is to come from an array of equipment,
including radar balloons flying up to 15,000 feet, AWACS planes with
a radar radius of 250 miles or more, other aircraft bristling with
infrared cameras, hydrofoils so fast their speed is classified, and
presumably satellite reconnaissance.
   The center's second-in-command, Rear Adm. John Pearson, refuses
to confirm whether the center uses satellites, even though JTF-4 has
a satellite in its unit emblem.
   The idea is for all agencies to forward data to JTF-4, which then
will monitor suspected smuggling boats and planes.
   Pearson said the center, which began operations in the spring,
can track virtually every plane and boat that crosses the Caribbean.
A similar center in Alameda, Calif., covers the West Coast.
   ``I'd be crazy to say an airplane literally can't fly into this
country without being seen, but I can offer that there would be
damned few that weren't seen,'' the admiral said.
   But beyond tracking, what JTF-4 must do is ``sort'' innocent
traffic from suspicious targets, then find someone in a position to
board the boat or force down the plane.
   Resources to do that are meager, as illustrated by the
frustrations of an aerostat radar balloon ship operating out of Key
West, said Coast Guard Lt. Ronald Kochan, who heads that operation.
   The ship's balloon has an effective radar range of a little less
than 60 miles, and is usually stationed at ocean ``choke points''
through which seaborne drug boats must travel.
   ``Working with one cutter, we might detect 37 targets a day, and
on an average maybe two are boarded,'' he said. ``We'd have to bring
the whole East Coast Coast Guard down here to give us 10 cutters to
work with.''
   The more sophisticated drug traffickers know the ship's schedule
anyway, he said.
   Although JTF-4 touts the Coast Guard balloons as one of the key
sources for its radar data, Kochan told a dismayed group of visiting
congressmen that no electronic connection exists between the ship
and the new center.
   He added that no plan existed to make such a connection, and that
there was no equipment for it and no budget to buy the necessary
equipment in any case.
   But the biggest question hanging over the center is whether its
mission is even necessary.
   With much fanfare, the Coast Guard and Customs have set up their
own joint intelligence unit in Dade County intended to do much the
same thing as JTF-4.
   Pearson identified that unit as one of JTF-4's inputs but could
not explain how the Customs and Coast Guard role would differ with
the presence of the military, except to say those agencies may work
a little closer to shore.
   Customs officials see little new in the military effort.
   ``Our role hasn't changed that much,'' said Robby Viator of
Customs in Miami. ``A couple of years ago we were it _ now we have
other players.''
   Even the CIA has gotten into the act. In April, the director set
up the Counternarcotics Center with representatives from DEA, FBI,
Customs, Coast Guard and other federal agencies, with a mission to
advise policymakers on how to fight drug trafficking.
   The proliferation of ``coordinators'' has some involved in the
drug enforcement efforts disgusted, although none will go on the
record with their objections.

   Addicts at a drug treatment center say
President Bush is leading the charge up the wrong hill in his war on
drugs, attacking cocaine and threatening prison when his program
should focus on treatment.
   Frank, Terry and Richard, an alcoholic, watched the speech in a
room at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, which has a 27-bed
voluntary treatment program. The patients spoke on condition that
their last names not be revealed.
   ``He's talking like he's talking to a bunch of schoolchildren,''
said Frank, 33, who is being treated for his addiction to
painkillers.
   Terry said Bush's plan to spend $925 million for treatment of
addicts was far too little.
   ``He sounded like a third-grade schoolteacher,'' said Terry, 34,
who is battling heroin. ``He was banging those rocks on the table _
he didn't make it scary enough.''
   She referred to the plastic bag of rock cocaine the president
used as a prop during the speech.
   ``Treatment is expensive. Street addicts are not going to be able
to come to Cedars-Sinai ... and the state programs are a joke,'' she
said.
   ``He made one big blunder, calling cocaine the nation's No. 1
drug problem,'' said Dr. Ronald Gershman, medical director of the
Center for Chemical Dependency.
   ``Alcoholism is the No. 1 drug in the nation. I think they are
being very narrow to focus all their attention on cocaine. It's a
scapegoat,'' said Gershman, who has been treating addicts for 15
years.
   Gershman said Americans face a flood of drugs, including
domestically made illegal amphetamines, abuse of prescription drugs,
heroin from Asia and Mexico and so-called designer drugs, such as
ecstasy.
   ``He talks about cocaine fields in Colombia _ how about the
California marijuana fields?'' Gershman asked.
   ``The bottom lines on those programs is that they are
ineffectual,'' he said. ``He missed the point. What he outlined
won't work. Drug treatment is labor-intensive and expensive. It has
to be recognized as a major medical problem.''
   All three patients agreed that employee insurance should be
mandated to cover treatment programs.
   Richard said he believed his employer, a law firm, used its
employee health program to discover his alcohol addiction and find a
way to fire him.
   ``I thought my employer was backing me, but they were really
looking for any way they could to get rid of me,'' he said.
   The patients derided Bush's proposal to increase the size of
federal prisons and toughen sentences for drug users.
   ``When you have an addiction, you don't think about anything but
the drug,'' Frank said.
   ``The worst patient in our unit right now has spent most of his
life in San Quentin,'' Gershman said.

<HEAD>Bush Speech Reax: More Than Quick Fix Only if Neighborhoods Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DONNELLY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's plan of attack in the war on drugs will be no
more than a quick fix unless neighborhoods across America rally to
the cause, say some state and local officials.
   Others found the $7.9 billion plan proposed in a nationally
televised speech Tuesday night too small for an all-out war.
   The president's push drew plaudits from those on the drug front
lines who have said they needed him in the fight.
   ``Maybe at last we'll have a nation that is dedicated to
comprehensive solution and can get off the quick fixes and cliches
like the death penalty,'' said Cary Edwards, former New Jersey
Attorney General and author of the state's Comprehensive Drug Reform
Act of 1987.
   Bush's call for a battle fought ``block by block, child by
child'' struck a responsive chord in many communities.
   In a drug-infested Chicago neighborhood, Leola Spann, director of
the Northwest Austin Council, said residents have begun the fight.
   ``I think communities are coming out and saying we're going to
take back our communities. Law enforcement knows we're behind
them,'' said Spann, whose group has hung ``Drug-Free Zone'' signs
around a school.
   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez said Bush was correct in saying that
money was not the solution.
   ``Floridians have already spent tens of millions of dollars on
the drug fight and the crime rate continues to rise,'' the
Republican Martinez said.
   ``What the president emphasized tonight is that money alone is
not going to win this fight. What wins it is the will of the
American people.''
   Some said education remained the key to the drug war, but Los
Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates said U.S. troops also were needed.
   ``I think you're going to see the need for the U.S. military to
become more actively involved,'' Gates said. He advocated ``a
friendly invasion'' of Colombia and other drug-producing nations.
   But Miami-based U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen, whose office
prosecutes more cocaine cases than any other, advocated a fight
focusing on cutting demand for drugs.
   ``We are to blame, not some Latin American country. Until we
realize that, we will not be taking a realistic approach to cleaning
up our own act,'' he said.
   Bush for the first time pledged U.S. military help to any
government that requests it, but most of his initiatives were close
to home: harsher penalties for users and more money for prisons,
treatment and education.
   Many said Bush's plan offered too little.
   ``I feel a little bit like the man whose house is burning down,
only to find that my next-door neighbor brought over a garden hose
to fight the fire,'' said California Attorney General John Van de
Kamp, an expected Democratic gubernatorial candidate.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said the president's program provided
little comfort to states.
   ``Local governments that are the front line in the war against
drugs welcome the president's concern, but they would welcome more
the resources needed to win this war before more of our children
become casualties,'' said Cuomo, a Democrat.
   Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn, also a Democrat, found other faults.
He said the policy was ``an empty gesture'' because it doesn't
provide for mandatory drug education in the schools, mandatory
treatment on demand for drug addicts or for mandatory federal prison
sentences for convicted drug dealers.
   Some officials were already making plans for federal funds.
   Asked how he would use $1 million if the federal government
granted it to his department to fight drugs, St. Paul, Minn., Police
Chief William McCutcheon said he would give it to schools.
   ``What we do in law enforcement is really short-term,'' he said.
``We need to change attitudes. We need to tell the young people
there's something better than chemicals.''
   In California, Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates said educational

people should speak their minds on the issue.
   ``You have to stick your head out the window and say `I'm not

   Two young brothers who were found stabbed
to death in a park had told their father they were going to pick up
golf balls for pocket change, police said.
   Autopsies showed that William James Neer, 10, died of a stab
wound to the abdomen and his 11-year-old brother, Cole Laverne Neer,
died of a stab wound to the chest, said Clark County coroner Arch
Hamilton.
   Investigators searched the scene of the killings Tuesday for
clues, then shifted to an overgrown area across the road. Officers
said they had no suspects, witnesses or motive in the Labor Day
killings.
   ``This kind of stuff never happens in Vancouver,'' police Capt.
Ray Anderson told reporters. ``We're talking about the kind of stuff
you read about and hope never happens to you.''
   Acting Police Chief Bob King said the boys were stabbed
repeatedly in their chests, but there was no evidence they were
tortured or molested.
   A passerby found William dead in a ditch in a wooded section of
east Vancouver's David Douglas Park on Monday evening.
   Hours later, Cole's body was found off a trail about 100 yards
away.
   King said officers found the boys' bicycles on a trail about 50
yards from the spot where the younger boy's body was found.
   The boys' father, Clair Neer, began looking for them when they
failed to show up for dinner. They had left home in the afternoon,
telling their father they planned to go to the nearby Vanco Golf
Range to pick up balls outside the fence.
   They planned to sell the balls back to the range, authorities
said.
   The bodies were found about a half-mile north of their home and
about a half-mile east of the driving range, King said.
   The boys aunt Kay Lohnes said the family moved to the Vancouver
area about three years ago.
   ``They were just babies,'' she said. ``I can't imagine anyone
doing this to them.''
   The boys have a 6-year-old brother, Richard. Clair Neer said
Tuesday he was leaving his house with his surviving son and was
moving in with the boys' aunt in Hillsboro. The boys' mother lives
in North Dakota, Lohnes said.
   ``As soon as I step outside that door I'm gone,'' the father
said. ``I'm not going to lose my last son to this.''
   Neer said his two older boys were inseparable.
   ``They were like twins. Where one was, the other one was. If one
was lost the other one went out looking for him.''
   The bodies will be taken to Oberon, N.D., on Thursday to be
buried at their grandfather's side, Neer said.

   An inner city high school will offer lottery
prizes _ including a 1984 Pontiac Sunbird _ to students who improve
their grades, avoid absences and don't get detentions.
   Officials say the unique approach being implemented this week at
North Division High School should provide motivation for good grades
and attendance.
   ``We want to reach a special group of students and encourage them
to come to school,'' said Milwaukee County Sheriff Richard Artison,
organizer of the program. ``The prizes offered in the lotto are
tangible with immediate benefits, but the benefits one receives by
attending school are long-lasting.''
   A student can qualify by raising his or her average by 0.25 of a
point, and have a grade-point average above 1.0. There also must be
no homeroom or class absences and no detentions in a six-week
grading period. Honor roll students _ those with an average of 3.0
or higher _ are automatically included.
   Every six weeks, the school will announce the winners of various
prizes such as watches, bicycles and radios. A drawing for the major
prize, a car, is to be held twice a year.
   The Pontiac was donated by a car dealer.

   A nuclear-weapons protester said she was
able to swim unnoticed into a top-secret Navy research center and
beat on a Trident-missile-firing submarine with a hammer before she
was arrested.
   Jacqueline Allen, 24, of Voluntown, discussed the Labor Day
attack on the moored USS Pennsylvania after an appearance Tuesday in
U.S. District Court, where she and six others were charged with
trespassing on Navy property and with destruction of government
property.
   They were released by a magistrate after signing promises to
appear in court to face the charges.
   Allen said the protesters wanted to send a message to the Navy
that ``these weapons don't make us secure and you can't secure the
weapons.''
   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., said the incident raises
``grave questions about security at the underwater systems center.''
   ``From a political standpoint, you wouldn't want to equate an act
of protest with an act of sabotage. From a security standpoint,
however, the fact that protesters could actually climb up on a
nuclear sub at a naval installation suggests the potential for far
more serious mischief.''
   Security at the Naval Underwater Systems Center was appropriate
and no investigation was planned, said Navy Lt. Cmdr. John Ward, a
spokesman for the Groton submarine base, which has authority over
security at the New London center.
   The protesters swam and paddled in a blackened canoe to reach the
sub at its berth at the New London center, according to authorities
and the protesters.
   Allen said she swam under the dock alongside the Pennsylvania,
reached the sub at about midship, poured a bottle of her blood on
the hull, scratched the word ``death'' in the paint and began
pounding on the ship with a hammer. She said it was the banging that
caused the guards to notice her.
   Two other swimmers, including Anne Montgomery, a 62-year-old
Roman Catholic nun from New York, were discovered shortly before
they reached the sub, the protesters said. Both pounded the hull
with hammers, an action meant to symbolize the biblical admonition
to beat swords into ploughshares.
   The submarine was not damaged and the protesters were prevented
from boarding, the Navy said.
   The ship is to be commissioned into the fleet on Saturday.
   The attack was similar to one seven years ago when nine
anti-nuclear activists broke into a shipyard across the Thames River
from the research center and vandalized the Trident submarine USS
Florida.

<HEAD>U.S. Embassy Staff Leave Lebanon, `Deteriorating Circumstances' Cited</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES thruout with official U.S. confirmation of evacuation,
details. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. ambassador John McCarthy and his
American staff were evacuated from Lebanon early Wednesday after
hundreds of Christians besieged the U.S. Embassy compound to protest
Washington's policy in Lebanon.
   The 30 diplomats were taken by helicopter to Cyprus because of
``deteriorating local circumstances ... no longer permitted the
embassy to function effectively,'' said Keith Peterson, a spokesman
for the U.S. Embassy in Nicosia.
   Peterson stressed: ``The United States of America is not
abandoning Lebanon,'' dismissing accusations the traditionally
pro-American Lebanese Christians have repeated in recent days.
   He said the diplomatic staff would return ``when the situatioon
permits.'' The sudden decision to pull out of Lebanon, where
Christian forces and Syrian troops have been fighting for six
months, came after supporters of Christian army commander Gen.
Michel Aoun surrounded the embassy on Tuesday.
   The protesters hoped to force the United States to take a tougher
stance against Syria's military presence in Lebanon.
   Peterson added: ``The personnel were evacuated to Cyprus and are
being flown from Cyprus to their final destination.'' He would not
give details of their travel plans.
   An army spokesman at Aoun's headquarters in the Christian suburb
of Yarze said the American diplomats left aboard three helicopters.
   Unofficial sources in Cyprus, 100 miles west of Lebanon, said the
aircraft had landed at Akrotiri, one of two British bases on the
island. Officers at the base would neither confirm nor deny the
report.
   The Lebanese army spokesman, who insisted on anonymity, said the
Americans had notified Aoun of their ``intention to leave.''
   He said that after the departure of dependents and non-essential
staff during the past six months of renewed fighting, ``about a
dozen'' Americans had been left at the embassy.
   Beirut's leftist daily paper As-Safir had said Tuesday that the
U.S. Embassy ``has informed those concerned that it is prepared to
close down if it comes under harassment.'' It did not elaborate.
   The Christians besieging the embassy compound were angry at the
United States for not coming to their aid against the Syrian army
and its Moslem allies since hostilities began March 8.
   Since then, fighting between the factions has clained the lives
of 827 people and wounded 2,452.
   The siege reflected widespread anger among Lebanon's estimated 1
million Christians that the West has not come to their rescue. They
are trapped in a coastal enclave that is ringed by the Syrians and
their allies.
   The crowd had on Tuesday gone into a frenzy, shouting ``We
Sacrifice Our Blood for You, Oh Aoun,'' ``McCarthy Go Home'' and
``The Biggest Catastrophe Is McCarthy.'' They waved placards and
posters denouncing America.
   Christian sources said the embassy siege was designed by Aoun to
whip up anti-American sentiment among Christians inside and outside
Lebanon, to bring pressure to bear on the United States.
   The demonstrators said Tuesday that their peaceful siege would go
on ``until our demands are met.''
   They demanded that McCarthy submit his credentials to ``the
legitimate Lebanese authorities represented by General Aoun'' and
official U.S. recognition of Aoun's authority.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, is competing
for legitimacy with Aoun's three-member Christian Cabinet.
   McCarthy, who took up his post in September 1988, after the
emergence of the dual government, has not submitted his credentials
to either Cabinet. He has publicly criticized Syria for not
responding to a U.S. behest to negotiate with Aoun, but Aoun has
charged that Washington is not turning sufficient heat on Syria to
soften its intransigence.
   The demonstrators also demanded that Washington dispatch an
official delegate to Lebanon on a fact-finding mission like ``the
Soviets and French did'' and the lifting of the blockade imposed on
the Christians by the Syrians.
   The Christian enclave has taken a fearful pounding from Syrian
artillery since yjr fighting broke out between Aoun's mainly
Christian forces and an alliance of Syrian troops and Druse
miltiamen.
   Aoun launched his self-proclaimed ``war of liberation'' to force
the Syrians to withdraw their 40,000 troops in Lebanon.
   Even though his forces are outnumbered and outgunned, his
objective appeared to be to mobilize U.S. and European support for
the Christians.
   That startegy has patently failed. Washington has made
sympathetic noises, but has made it clear it has no intention of
getting drawn into the Lebanese quagmire again.

<HEAD>Salvadoran Rebels Call For Peace Talks To Begin Next Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TALLI NAUMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salvadoran rebels have discarded previous
conditions and accepted an offer by Salvador's new rightist
president to hold talks aimed at ending the country's 10-year-old
civil war, proposing they begin next week.
   ``We're taking away practically all obstacles,'' Ana Guadalupe
Martinez, a rebel commander, told a Mexico City news conference on
Tuesday.
   There was no immediate response from the Salvadoran government,
but it did announce a 48-hour cease-fire to begin Sept. 14 and
coincide with the celebration of Central America's independence from
Spain in 1821.
   If the Salvadoran government agrees to peace talks, it would be
the first meeting between representatives of the belligerents since
President Alfredo Cristiani took office June 1 and called for peace
talks.
   The guerrillas agreed at the time but the effort stalled because
of a failure to agree on the details.
   In a significant softening of previous rebel conditions, Ms.
Martinez said the rebels would bargain with any committee the
government names.
   Before, they had insisted that an army representative and
high-level officials be at the negotiating table. They rejected one
delegation the government considered on grounds its members would
not have the power to negotiate.
   The rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front represents
five left-wing guerrilla groups that have been fighting a succession
of U.S.-backed Salvadoran governments since 1979.
   In announcing the cease-fire Tuesday in El Salvador, Col.
Inocente Montano, the vice minister of defense, did not mention the
rebel proposal for peace talks. But he but told reporters the
cease-fire ``is a positive initiative ... as long as it is
respected'' by the rebels.
   A cease-fire for the independence festivities had been suggested
Monday by the Permanent Committee of the National Debate for Peace,
an organization representing more than 70 church, union,
humanitarian and civic groups.
   The government and rebel announcements followed a battle in
northeastern El Salvador Tuesday in which at least 16 soldiers were
killed. Salvadoran armed forces spokesmen reported the deaths and
said the rebels also suffered ``numerous casualties.''
   The rebels suggested the period of Sept. 10-14 as dates and
Mexico as a site for talks in a proposal sent to Cristiani on Friday
through Monsignor Arturo Rivera Damas, the Roman Catholic archbishop
of San Salvador, Ms. Martinez said.
   She added the front has not received a reply from the government
and said, ``We think with this block of measures there has to be an
answer before long.''
   But she said the rebels had received an unacceptable response to
a proposal that the government release all wounded rebels it is
holding as prisoners.
   Ms. Martinez said the proposal was made through Rivera Damas and
the government replied that it would release the wounded prisoners
if the rebels stopped sabotaging electrical installations and lifted
their bans on transportatrion.
   ``That point was not negotiable,'' she said.
   Mario Lopez, another rebel commander, told reporters new steps
would be announced on Thursday. ``Commanders will make public a
series of measures to create an atmosphere of confidence for the
negotiations,'' he said.
   He did not elaborate, but there was speculation the steps might
include a cease-fire. In the past, the guerrillas have opposed a
unilateral cease-fire, saying a truce would have be to be negotiated
at the bargaining table.
   The rebels, in their proposal for talks next week, held to their
condition that Rivera Damas be present. Cristiani has said the
archbishop should not be involved.
   The rebels have also insisted that delegates from the
Organization of American States and United Nations be present.
   No agenda is being proposed for the talks, Ms. Martinez said,
``because there has never been dialogue'' when topics have been
fixed in advance.
   Three rounds of talks with the government of former President
Jose Napoleon Duarte between 1984 and 1987 failed to make any
progress toward ending the nearly 10-year-old war. Duarte headed a
centrist Christian Democrat government.
   An estimated 70,000 people, the majority of them civilians, have
been killed in the fighting.

   Irving Azoff, who in six years
resurrected MCA Records from an also-ran to the No. 2 pop music
label, has quit to form his own entertainment company.
   ``Now it's time for me to gather up my stuff, move outside the
system and try slaying the dragon again,'' he said Tuesday in a
farewell letter to MCA Records employees. ``See you soon on the
charts _ at the top, of course.''
   Azoff decided in April 1983 to join MCA, which he said was ``to
the record business what strip-mining is to the ecology.''
   He broadened the label's base beyond rock and jazz into black
music, signing such acts as Klymaxx, Stephanie Mills, Patti LaBelle
and Gladys Knight, and contemporary country, with artists such as
The Judds, Lyle Lovett, George Strait and Reba McEntire.
   ``Today our roster boasts some of the most impressive names in
contemporary including ... Bobby Brown, Elton John, Boston, Tiffany,
Jody Watley, New Edition, Pebbles and Fine Young Cannibals,'' Azoff
said.
   Billboard magazine reported MCA had become the No. 2 pop label in
1988, behind CBS Records. MCA was ranked 12th in 1983.
   In 1983, MCA had nine gold and one platinum LPs; by 1988 the
figures were 17 gold, eight platinum, four double platinum, two
triple platinum and one quadruple platinum record. Gold records are
awarded for sales of 500,000 long-playing records, tapes and compact
disks, platinum for 1 million.

   It took some imagination to envision two
industrial sites and a cornfield as home to glittering gambling
casinos.
   But all it really will take is money.
   ``You could put grass on that and make it look like a pasture,''
said Steve Norton, executive vice president of Resorts
International, after viewing the sites with a legislative study
committee.
   The committee tour was part of a daylong hearing Tuesday on
legislative efforts to bring casino gambling to the city's ailing
economy.
   Mayor Thomas V. Barnes, who contends that casinos could bring
thousands of jobs and $60 million in tax revenues, said the
90-minute tour gave legislators firsthand knowledge of the sites.
   ``From then on, it's up to us to build our case for revenue and
job potential,'' he said.
   The move faces continued opposition.
   ``We need to be capitalizing on the strengths of people, not on
their weaknesses,'' the Rev. William D. Booth said before a meeting
of the study committee reviewing casino legislation.
   Booth said the lure of jobs and tax revenue hides the reality of
family disruption and wasted money brought on by gambling.
   ``We don't believe we will build a great city or build a great
people bringing into our circumstance this kind of enterprise,'' he
said.
   Booth is a co-chairman of No Casinos for Gary, a church
based-organization seeking oppostion votes in a non-binding
referendum.
   Barnes has been rallying votes for the Nov. 4 referendum while
urging the General Assembly to pass laws permitting casino gambling
in Gary.
   Resorts International operates a casino in Atlantic City, N.J.,
and joined Gary officials earlier this year in an unsuccessful
effort to win approval for casino gambling in Indiana.
   The General Assembly earlier this year approved the referendum
for Gary after rejecting the broader legislation.

   The dollar rose during trading to a two-month high
against the yen today but closed unchanged, while share prices on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined.
   The dollar opened at 146.90 yen, slightly above Tuesday's close
of 146.65 yen, and rose rapidly to 147.38 yen despite repeated
interventions by the Bank of Japan during morning trading, currency
dealers said.
   It was the first time the dollar rose above 147.00 yen since June
15, when it closed at 150.30 yen.
   The dollar turned bearish in the afternoon, however, following
speculation that Japan may increase its interest rates, the dealers
said. It closed at 146.65 yen, unchanged from Tuesday's close.
   The dealers attributed the dollar's strength in the morning to
the continued strong performance of the U.S. economy and reduced
anxiety about inflation.
   ``When it passed the 147-yen mark, the traders in the market were
beginning to feel it may be rising too fast,'' said a dealer at
Daiichi Kangyo Bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Then the
rumor about an interest-rate increase hit the market.''
   He said a report that quoted Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita as
saying the central bank would take every possible measure to stop
the yen's slide was taken as a warning of an interest rate increase.
   Dealers also said the dollar's firmness followed its surge in the
New York market Tuesday despite concerted interventions by central
banks in the United States and Europe.
   ``In the morning, the dollar's upsurge made us think it may
surpass the 150-yen mark before long,'' said the dealer at Daiichi
Kangyo.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, a 41.83-point loser Tuesday, shed another 170.64 points, or
0.48 percent, to close at 34,271.31.
   Securities dealers said the rising dollar had dampened investors'
buying enthusiasm, although the market's environment was thought to
be improving.
   ``All the market needs right now is stable exchange rates and I
think stock prices will regain strength shortly,'' said a dealer at
Nikko Securities Co., who also asked his name not be used.
   Dealers said speculation over an interest rate hike also
discouraged investors in the stock market.

   Clifford E. Vargas, who transformed a boy's
dream of the old-time circus into a revival of the traditional
three-ring big top, has died. He was 64.
   Vargas died Monday night of heart disease at his Hollywood Hills
home, according to a press release from his Circus Vargas.
   The grandson of Portuguese circus owners, Vargas grew up on a

   Later, he founded Circus Vargas with three trucks and eight
animals. In the early years, he served as ticket taker, ringmaster
and truck driver.
   The circus, which celebrated its 20th anniversary this year, grew
to include 150 animals and up to 300 employees. It is billed as the
largest traveling, tented circus in the world.Up to 3 million people
attend the circus each year in shows held in more than 100 U.S. and
Canadian cities.
   Vargas is survived by three brothers and a sister-in-law. Funeral

<HEAD>Mainland Chinese Pilot Defects To Taiwan</HEAD>

   .
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A Chinese air force pilot flew his MiG-19
jet fighter to the Nationalist-held offshore island of Quemoy today,
the Defense Ministry said.
   Lt. Chiang Wen-hao, 24, landed his fighter this afternoon after a
flight from Longxi airport in China's southern Fujian province, the
ministry said in a statement.
   Chiang, from the central Chinese province of Sichuan, was
attached to the 49th Chinese Air Force Division, the statement said.
   The pilot is the first Chinese airman to defect to Taiwan since
the June 3-4 bloody suppression of a pro-democracy movement in China.
   The last Chinese pilot to defect to Taiwan, Liu Chih-yuan, now
30, also flew a MiG-19 when he fled in 1987.
   The Nationalist government rewarded him with 412 pounds of gold,
then valued at about $3 million. He is now a member of Taiwan's air
force.
   The Taiwan government has a sliding scale of gold rewards for
Chinese military defectors, calculated on the type of aircraft they
bring out.
   Officials said 14 Chinese military personnel have defected to
Taiwan since 1949, when the Nationalists retreated to Taiwan after
losing a civil war to the Communists on the Chinese mainland.
   Seven of the 14 flew planes to South Korea, the only Asian nation
that has diplomatic ties with the Nationalists. They were eventually
allowed to settle in Taiwan, but South Korea kept the planes.
   Since the June crackdown, dozens of Chinese have arrived in
Taiwan in boats, claiming they wanted a better life, but they were
sent back to the Chinese mainland. Officials said they could not be
classified as defectors.
   Last month, a Chinese youth seeking political asylum in South
Korea was given a Taiwan passport and later left for El Salvador.
   Observers say the Nationalists are reluctant to accept Chinese
political refugees for fear the action would outrage Chinese
authorities.

   Black leaders told a judge that minorities in
Dallas have trouble gaining power within city government because the
election system is biased.
   Qualified black candidates typically have been beaten in city
council elections by whites ``because one face was black and the
other was white,'' Eddie Bernice Johnson, a state senator from
Dallas, testified Tuesday at the opening of a federal trial.
   Two unsuccessful black council candidates and an Hispanic group
have charged in a lawsuit that Dallas' apportionment system,
particularly the use of at-large districts, has resulted in the
underrepresentation of the minority community.
   The current council, governing a population estimated to be 51
percent minorities, consists of nine non-Hispanic whites and two
blacks.
   The plaintiffs are asking U.S. District Judge Jerry Buchmeyer to
order a restructuring. Voters approved a new structure last month
and some attorneys say the case jeopardizes the plan that was
approved overwhelmingly by voters.
   The plaintiffs would like the city to be apportioned in 15
single-member districts, their attorneys said.
   The city said the voters' right to pick their system of
government is at stake and its attorneys dispute charges that the
current system is discriminatory.
   ``In the last 14 elections, since 1983, the black preferred
candidate has been successful in nine races,'' Paul Pearce, an
attorney for the city, said during opening arguments.
   Johnson and state Rep. Fred Blair of Dallas criticized the use of
at-large districts, which they said sap the voting strength of
minorities.
   ``The at-large structure is a convenient way of maintaining
control of the city of Dallas. At-large council members don't make
themselves available to the concerns of the entire city,'' Blair
said.
   Last month, Dallas voters adopted a so-called 10-4-1 council
structure with 10 members elected from single districts, four from
quadrants or ``super'' districts and the mayor at-large.
   Pearce sought a dismissal of the case because the U.S. Justice
Department has not approved the plan. Buchmeyer rejected the motion,
saying he would not rule on the viability of the plan.
   Under Dallas' current system, eight members are elected from
single-member districts, and three, including the mayor, are elected
at-large.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Sweep Across Kansas, Mississippi Valley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Warm, humid air from the Gulf of Mexico and an upper air
disturbance produced showers and thunderstorms today across Kansas
and parts of the middle Mississippi Valley.
   Some of the storms produced locally heavy rainfall that flooded
roads, low-lying areas and basements in northeast Kansas.
   A cold front pushed through the northern Plains and central
Rockies, and strong, gusty winds blew through western parts of the
Dakotas and Wyoming.
   A high wind warning was in effect for western South Dakota.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered in eastern New Mexico,
and along the Gulf and southern Atlantic coasts.
   Laredo, Texas, reached 100 degrees Tuesday, the 100th day this
year temperatures reached triple digits there. Phoenix has had 116
days of 100 degrees or higher this year and is closing in on its
record of 122 days set last year.
   The nation's high Tuesday was 114 degrees at Bullhead City,
Ariz., and Palm Springs, Calif.
   Warm weather continued today in much of Texas, which had
temperatures in the 80s, and in the desert Southwest where readings
were in the 80s or 90s.
   Cool temperatures were behind the front moving across the
northern Plains and the central Rockies. Early morning readings were
in the 40s and 50s.
   Crisp, cool weather with clear skies prevailed across eastern New
York state and much of New England where temperatures were in the
40s and 50s. Temperatures also were in the 50s along the Pacific
Coast. The remainder of the nation generally had early morning
readings in the 60s or 70s.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
eastern Gulf Coast region across Florida into the southern Atlantic
Coast states, and from Kansas and western Missouri into eastern
Nebraska; widely scattered thunderstorms in New Mexico and the
southern Plateau, with possibly severe thunderstorms developing in
the eastern Dakotas and western Minnesota; showers from central
Montana to eastern Washington state, and snow in the higher
elevations of the northern Rockies.
   Fair to partly sunny skies should prevail in the rest of the
nation.
   Predicted highs: lower 90s across the Florida peninsula and the
lower Mississippi Valley, and from eastern Utah to western South
Dakota; 90s to above 100 in the southern Plains and the Southwest;
70s from the Great Lakes to the middle and northern Atlantic Coast,
across the northern Rockies, the Pacific Northwest, and along the
California coast. Highs elsewhere were expected to be in the 80s.
   The nation's temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 40 degrees at
Butte, Mont., to 95 at Blythe, Calif.

<HEAD>Probe to Pluto Could Be Piggybacked on Solar Mission, NASA Engineer
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A NASA engineer has proposed a relatively
quick, cheap way to send a spacecraft to Pluto, the only unexplored
planet in the solar system.
   Robert Farquhar, who manages the small missions program at NASA
headquarters in Washington, said a rocket designed to send a probe
to the sun also could hurl an unmanned spaceship to Pluto.
   ``It's a free ride,'' he said in an interview in Tuesday's Los
Angeles Times.
   Voyager 2's flight past Neptune last week leaves Pluto the only
planet unvisited by a spacecraft from Earth. There are no plans for
a Pluto mission, and such a flight won't be financially feasible for
decades, officials of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration have said.
   Farquhar, who masterminded the flight of the first spacecraft to
visit a comet, said his proposal would allow a probe to be launched
toward Pluto within about a dozen years and for less than $150
million. That's cheap compared with the twin-spacecraft Voyager
mission that visited four planets for $865 million.
   NASA plans to send a probe through the sun's searing atmosphere
right after the turn of the century.
   To approach the sun at an angle that would allow scientists to
monitor the probe throughout its flight, it first would have to be
carried around Jupiter.
   Farquhar said a lightweight Pluto probe could be carried on the
same Titan rocket. Once they reach Jupiter, the probes would part
for their respective targets. The Pluto probe, given a boost by
Jupiter's gravity, would reach Pluto around 2014.
   Pluto normally is the ninth and most distant planet from the sun.
But Neptune now is temporarily in that position because of Pluto's
elongated elliptical orbit.
   Farquhar's proposal is ``a very interesting possibility,'' said
physicist Bruce Tsurutani of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, who is planning the solar probe. Tsurutani said Farquhar's
proposal should receive strong consideration.
   Physicist Alan Stern, a University of Colorado expert on Pluto,
said the proposal is feasible. He suggested that any joint
solar-Pluto mission be named ``Fire and Ice.''
   If Farquhar's proposal is accepted, it won't be the first time
one of his ideas gains favor. Farquhar and the late Fred Scarf, a
physicist with TRW Inc. in Redondo Beach, persuaded NASA a few years
ago to redirect an aging spacecraft toward comet Giacobini-Zinner.
   The International Sun-Explorer 3, which had finished its main
mission of studying the solar wind, was renamed the International
Cometary Explorer and became the first to visit a comet. The probe
arrived at Giacobini-Zinner in 1985, just before five European and
Japanese spacecraft visited Halley's comet in 1986,
   Farquhar said he devised his Pluto proposal while examining plans
for the solar probe. NASA has made that probe a high-priority
mission because the sun has been relatively neglected in space
exploration.
   Under Farquhar's proposal, the Pluto probe would contain a
camera, a dust counter, an instrument to study the planet's
atmosphere and radio gear for communication and other studies. The
spacecraft also might send a package of instruments to Pluto's
surface as it darted past the planet.

<HEAD>TWA Jetliner Dives to Miss Military Plane; Five Injured</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A TWA airliner with 151 passengers dived to
avoid colliding with a military plane at 37,000 feet, slightly
injuring five people, authorities said.
   Across the state, an Air Midwest commuter plane carrying seven
passengers and two crewmen made a successful belly landing Tuesday
night at Kansas City International Airport, officials said. The
plane skidded 1,000 feet but no one was injured.
   TWA Flight 818, a Boeing 767 bound non-stop for Paris, took its
evasive action south of Lake Michigan Tuesday as it approached
Detroit, airline spokesman Don Morrison said.
   Morrison said a Chicago air traffic controller's instructions put
the TWA jetliner on a collision course.
   But a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration disputed
Morrison's claim.
   ``We have no knowledge of air traffic controllers being
involved,'' FAA spokesman Mort Edelstein said.
   The FAA said it will review voice tapes and radar recordings to
determine circumstances surrounding Tuesday's incident.
   A flight attendant and four passengers were hurt. Late Tuesday,
all but one of the injured had been released from hospitals, where
they were treated for bruises and minor cuts.
   Flight 818 had been gone about 45 minutes following its afternoon
takeoff from Lambert St. Louis International when its pilot came
into contact with Chicago air controllers, Morrison said.
   The pilot was given a vector change, a direction change, by the
air traffic control system, Morrison said. ``He made that change
until (situated) at 37,000 feet, which was his assigned altitude,''
Morrison said.
   ``As he made the turn, he noted immediately in front of him an
airplane _ a foreign aircraft. He immediately dropped altitude to
avoid the aircraft. He avoided the aircraft, went underneath it,''
Morrison said.
   Edelstein said the incident involved the TWA plane and a military
aircraft and was not being classified immediately as a near
collision. The type of military plane was not immediately identified.
   ``The last we knew, the planes were eight miles part,'' Edelstein
said. ``Why he took evasive action we won't know until we talk with
the pilot.''
   Morrison said most of Flight 818's passengers were boarded other
flights to Paris.
   In Kansas City, the landing gear of the Air Midwest commuter
failed to extend and lock in place properly, authorities said. The
twin-engine turbo-prop Fairchild Metro skidded 1,000 feet on the
runway before coming to a stop.
   Authorities said foam was used on the runway to prevent fire in
case of a fuel leak.

   The dollar eased in early European trading today,
knocked down by comments by Bank of Japan officials during earlier
Asian trading, foreign currency dealers said.
   Gold prices were little changed.
   An unnamed Bank of Japan official was quoted as saying the
central bank is willing ``to do anything, anytime'' to stabilize
foreign exchange rates.
   Later remarks by Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita indicating
his desire to see the dollar below 140 yen put renewed pressure on
the currency, dealers said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed at 146.65 yen, unchanged from Tuesday. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 146.50 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.9789 West German marks, down from 1.9895
   _1.7065 Swiss francs, down from 1.7170
   _6.6710 French francs, down from 6.7055

   _1,417.00 Italian lire, down from 1,425.50
   _1.1790 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1811
   The dollar fell against the pound in London. It cost $1.5485 to
buy one pound at midmorning, compared with $1.5385 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $359.50 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $358.25. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $360.00.
   The bid price in Zurich was also $360.00 a troy ounce compared
with $358.30 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.19 to close at a bid $360.47.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.09 a troy ounce,
up from Tuesday's $5.07.

<HEAD>Jury Finds Man Guilty of Planting Bombs Around Salem</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A jury convicted a factory worker in a
failed plot to blow up Salem with 13 bombs that were planted around
the southern Indiana city last year.
   The U.S. District Court jury deliberated for a little more than
seven hours before finding Jerry A. Conrad, 42, of Salem guilty of
all 29 counts against him. He faces up to 285 years in prison.
   Defense attorney Michael McDaniel said he planned to appeal the
conviction.
   As he heard the verdict, Conrad slumped in his chair and his
mouth sagged. One juror wept.
   ``My husband is innocent, and this is not over,'' said the
defendant's wife, Rose Mary, as she left the courtroom.
   Conrad made no comment to reporters as federal marshals led him
from the courthouse.
   ``We were confident from the outset the jury would convict on all
29 counts,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Stanley Powell told
reporters. ``The evidence in this case was overwhelming.''
   U.S. District Judge Sarah Evans Barker set no sentencing date.
   McDaniel said Conrad probably would not be sentenced until after
the trial of John M. Hubbard III, also charged in the case.
Hubbard's trial is set for Oct. 2, and Conrad is expected to testify.
   Conrad and Hubbard, 31, also of Salem, were charged with 14
counts of making bombs, 13 counts of attempting to destroy bridges
and buildings used in interstate commerce, and one count each of
illegal possession of dynamite and conspiracy.
   The bombs were found stashed behind buildings and beneath bridges
July 5, 1988. The government contends they were placed in the
downtown area partly because of Hubbard's feeling of rivalry for
state Rep. Frank Newkirk Jr., who also is the son of Salem's mayor.
The largest bomb was found behind Newkirk's law office.
   ``Ladies and gentlemen make no mistake about it. These were bombs
that were meant to go off and were meant to cause death and
destruction,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Linda S. Chapman said in
closing arguments Tuesday.
   ``But for the grace of God, Salem would have been literally blown
off the map that day,'' she told the jury.
   Three of the bombs ignited and fizzled, but none exploded, and no
one was hurt.
   During the trial, the government described Conrad as a
survivalist who collected books on making explosives but suggested
no other motive for his role in the bomb incident.

   Two men were badly burned in an explosion
at the Shell Oil refinery that shot flames and smoke hundreds of
feet in the air and shook homes seven miles away.
   The first blast, shortly before 7 p.m. Tuesday, was followed by
more than a dozen smaller ones during the next 2{ hours, said Jane
Tocher, an engineering assistant at Shell. Officials said they
planned to let the fire burn itself out. There was no damage
estimate.
   Two Shell employees were seriously burned and taken to a San
Pablo hospital, where they were listed in stable condition in the
burn unit. Both had second-degree burns on 25 percent of their
bodies, mainly on their back and arms, a hospital spokesman said.
   Some 150 industry firefighters brought the blaze under control
about 9 p.m, said Shell spokesman Igor Skaredoff. The cause of the
explosion and fire were unknown.
   Nearby residential neighborhoods were not evacuated, but the sky
over Martinez was thick with black smoke that billowed high into the
sky over the plant.

   A Soviet trawler collided with a Finnish
tanker and sank in the Baltic Sea today, and the coast guard said
the only Soviet sailor who was able to abandon ship died after being
pulled from the water.
   The other 14 Soviet crewmen were missing and presumed dead.
   ``Only one man, probably the radio operator, had managed to get
into the water, but he died upon arrival at the hospital,'' said
Waldemar Berlin, head of coast guard rescue operations.
   ``I've worked here for 30 years and I can't recall a more serious
accident'' in the Baltic, he said.
   The tanker Tebo Star collided with the trawler Labushkino at
12:11 a.m. 32 miles southwest off the Swedish island of Gotland.
   The Soviet trawler sank within minutes, Berlin said, and some
wreckage and an oil slick was all that marked the site.
   By this morning the search was scaled down to ``virtually
nothing,'' Berlin said. The operation had involved three navy
helicopters, four naval vessels and 14 trawlers from the Soviet port
of Kaliningrad that had been fishing in the area.
   The Soviet new agency Tass, in a brief dispatch from Moscow, gave
generally the same details but said the search continued for the
fishermen.
   The cause of the accident was not known. The weather was fair and
winds were moderate at 27 mph.
   The 6,000-ton Tebo Star sent out a distress signal immediately
after colliding with the 75-foot-long Labushkino. A nearby Soviet
trawler, the Matrosova, picked up the fatally injured sailor more
than an hour after the accident.
   According to rescue workers, the Finnish tanker veered to avoid a
collision with another Soviet trawler when it hit the Labushkino.
   Searchers found four empty life rafts, but ``they were detached
automatically, and no one had had the time to go into them,'' Berlin
said.
   A Finnish report broadcast on Swedish radio said the Soviet
trawler might have had its lights turned off at the time.
   Berlin said West German authorities will question the crew of the
Tebo Star, which suffered no damage, when it arrives in Kiel
Thursday morning. The tanker then will continue to its original
destination, Amsterdam.
   Berlin said no official explanation was expected before the
tanker returned to the Finnish capital of Helsinki.

of syndicated columns and comics; picks up 2nd graf, `Universal Press ...'.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only hours after their attorneys won a round in
court, editors of the Dallas Times Herald explained to readers why
some regular features were missing from the newspaper.
   A federal judge in Kansas City, Mo., late Tuesday denied
Universal Press Syndicate's request to prevent the Times Herald from
printing 26 comic strips and columns The Dallas Morning News wants
exclusively.
   But because an agreement between the syndicate and the Times
Herald permitting publication of the features expired Tuesday, the
newspaper was forced to pull the features from today's editions.
   A note accompanied the front-page story that apprised of the
development in Kansas City. In it, ``The Editors'' informed readers
of the ongoing litigation and the absence of the features. They
asked that readers ``accept our apology and be assured that we will
continue to fight to return all your favorite features to the Dallas
Times Herald.''
   In the section where readers were accustomed to finding ``Dear
Abby,'' the bold type read, ``Thanks for reading Dear Abby in the
Dallas Times Herald for the past 31 years.'' Below that, the
newspaper printed, ``We apologize for being unable to bring our
loyal readers Dear Abby in its usual place today. We are fighting in
court to return it to you. _ The Editor''
   Other boxed messages with apologies were on the comics pages
where eight Universal Press comic strips usually appear.
   Universal Press Syndicate has reached an agreement with the A.H.
Belo Corp., owner of the Morning News, that would give the newspaper
exclusive Dallas-area rights to the comics and features, which
include ``Dear Abby'' and ``Doonesbury.''
   Universal Press had filed a lawsuit and sought a preliminary
injunction to prevent the Times Herald from using its comics and
features beyond the cancellation date.
   On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge D. Brook Bartlett said he would
not approve the injunction because Kansas City-based Universal Press
had not convinced him one was necessary.
   Universal Press will continue fighting any efforts the Times
Herald might make in state courts to print the UPS features, said
David Oliver, an attorney for the syndicate.
   ``If we learn that tomorrow there are Universal Press features in
the Times Herald, then the Times Herald has run those features
without our consent and without a state order,'' Oliver said. ``That
would be a copyright infringement, and we would be right back here
in federal court.''
   Times Herald Editor Roy Bode said the newspaper has no intention
of using the material beyond the cancellation dates without the
permission of Universal Press or a legal authority.
   But, he added: ``It's an extraordinary thing for a syndicate to
withdraw its strips from one paper to take them to another paper. I
don't think it's a reputable practice.''
   John McMeel, president of Universal Press, said his company had a
30-day cancellation agreement on most of the comics and features
with the Times Herald. The cancellation date for all but two of the
comics and features was Saturday, but lawyers for the newspaper and
the syndicate agreed that the Times Herald could carry the material
through Tuesday's hearing.
   There was a 90-day cancellation agreement for Doonesbury, the
popular Pulitzer Prize-winning strip, and another comic, which runs
through Nov. 1.
   The Times Herald has sued in Texas state court seeking to prevent
its rival from gaining exclusive Dallas-area rights to the Universal
Press material.

<TEXT>
   NBC television has asked an ABC-owned production
company to create and produce a prime-time drama series. It would be
the first time one TV network has produced a show to run on a rival
network.
   The offer of the deal comes as federal regulations governing
television are being lifted, sparking changes in the traditional
network-studio relationship of television production, said Brandon
Stoddard, head of ABC Productions.
   Stoddard said he is considering the request by NBC for a drama
series that would air in a 10 p.m. slot, as well as a mini-series,
The New York Times reported in today's editions.
   Stoddard said he expected in five to seven years a ``network
studio system'' would develop in which the networks will produce
more of their programming.
   In 1990, a limit of five hours of prime-time programming produced
by the networks will be lifted. The new rules have prompted the
three networks to seek more of their own progamming.
   In the past, the major Hollywood-based production companies such
as Warner Brothers Inc., Universal and Paramount, produced the
majority of programming seen on television.
   Hollywood-based studios can reap high profits from syndicating
their programs. The networks have been prevented from taking a
percentage of the profits from the syndication sales.
   Congress has asked the networks and the studios to reach a
compromise.

   An explosion and fire wrecked part of a
top-secret Iraqi missile plant last month, killing at least 700
people and wounding up to 1,800, dissident Iraqi sources and British
news reports said today.
   There was no confirmation of their reports from officials in
Baghdad, the Iraqi capital. Iraq's state-controlled media has made
no mention of a major explosion in the area.
   But Western diplomats reached by telephone in Baghdad confirmed
there was an explosion at the heavily guarded facility more than two
weeks ago. The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
they could give no details.
   Such an explosion would be the worst disaster of its kind
reported in Iraq. There was no word on its cause and no immediate
indication of sabotage.
   London's Independent daily, quoting unidentified diplomats and
Middle East sources, said today the conflagration killed 700 people
when it engulfed the plant south of Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, on
Aug. 17.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. reported that Egypt's Defense
Ministry confirmed there was a big explosion at the facility with
many casualties.
   The Iraqis, with Egyptian help, are believed to be developing a
modified version of Argentina's medium-range, Condor-2
surface-to-surface missile, known as the Badr-2000, at the huge
plant between Al-Hillah and Ad-Diwaniyeh, 40 miles south of Baghdad.
   The complex, protected by an elite military force, reportedly
covered 970 square miles, indicating it included a missile
test-firing range. Sources said it is run by Iraq's Ministry for
Military Industries.
   An official of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, an outlawed
Kurdish movement fighting the Baghdad government, told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview that sources inside Iraq
said 700 bodies have so far been recovered.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
casualty toll from the night explosion and fire could be as high as
2,500 dead and wounded.
   The Independent reported that the casualties included Egyptian
personnel who were flown to Cairo in three Egyptian air force
transports on Aug. 18. The daily quoted Egyptian sources as saying
the casualties were taken to the Maadi military hospital in Cairo.
   The dissident group's official said the explosion at the plant
touched off a huge fire that destroyed at least 30 percent of the
complex, which includes laboratories, missile factories and living
quarters for workers.
   The Iraqis used firefighting aircraft to battle the flames, but
they were not able to bring it under control until Aug. 25, the
sources said. The number of personnel at the complex was not known.
   Other Kurdish sources, linked to other rebel groups fighting
Baghdad for an autonomous homeland in northern Iraq, said the
facility included a chemical weapons factory and that some of the
casualties had wounds consistent with contact with chemical agents.
   There was no independent confirmation of that report. But Iraq is
known to have several plants producing chemical and nerve gases.
   The United Nations blamed Iraq several times for using chemical
weapons, outlawed under a 1925 Geneva accord, during the 8-year war
with Iran.
   Western military analysts have been reporting for months that the
Iraqis were developing the Badr 2000 to carry nuclear and chemical
warheads with a range of up to 620 miles.
   The project has alarmed the Israelis because it would allow Iraq
to hit targets inside the Jewish state.
   The Israeli air force destroyed a nuclear reactor near Baghdad in
June 1981 in a long-range air strike. Israel said that plant was
close to being able to produce nuclear weapons.
   The Israelis have said that West German, French and Italian
companies have been involved in the Badr 2000 project.
   Prosecutors in Munich reported earlier this year that they were
investigating several West German companies for possible illegal
exports of technology to Iraq for missile development.

   Georges Simenon, creator of the French detective
Inspector Maigret and the most widely published author of the 20th
century, has died at his Swiss home in Lausanne, it was announced
today. He was 86.
   Simenon died Monday night, according to a Lausanne funeral home,
Pompes Funebres Generales. His family gave instructions for a
private funeral today, a spokesman for the funeral home said on
condition of anonymity.
   No cause of death was given, but Simenon had been ailing for some
time. He died peacefully, a spokeswoman at his Lausanne office said.
   The author stipulated that his ashes join those of his daughter
and favorite child, Marie-Jo, under a 250-year-old cedar outside his
house. She committed suicide in 1978 at age 25.
   ``I don't fear death, but I fear causing trouble by my death to
those who survive me,'' Simenon once said. ``I would like to die as
discreetly as possible.''
   Jean Richard, the French actor who played Inspector Maigret in
dozens of television films over 23 years, said of Simenon: ``For me,
he was the greatest popular French author without comparison. He was
the new Balzac.''
   The official Soviet news agency Tass eulogized Simenon in a brief
obituary as a ``master detective story writer.'' Maigret, the
contemplative Paris policeman, is a favorite of millions of Soviets.
Some of his adventures were recently reprinted by the popular weekly
magazine Ogonyok.
   A Belgian native, Simenon wrote 80 books featuring Maigret, the
compassionate, pipe-smoking Paris chief inspector who seeks to
understand criminals rather than condemn them.
   While best known for the immensely popular ``Maigrets,'' he
personally preferred the 132 ``non-Maigrets,'' psychological,
sometimes nightmarish novels about people in crisis that put his
name into literary encyclopedias.
   His books were translated into 55 languages, including Chinese,
Armenian and Yiddish, in 40 countries. In the Soviet Union some of
his novels had initial editions of 500,000 copies and his revealing
``Letter To My Mother'' is obligatory reading in French-language
school lessons.
   At the start of his career, Simenon also wrote about 300 pulp
fiction novels under more than 20 pseudonyms.
   A 1973 survey by UNESCO said sales of Simenon books totaled more
than half a billion worldwide. The books provided the basis for 52
feature movies and more than 300 television films. Charles Laughton,
Jean Gabin and Heinz Ruehmann were among the 22 actors who played
Maigret.
   About 50 biographies have been written about Simenon. His Paris
editor published 21 volumes of ``Dictees'' (Dictations), transcripts
of reflections and reminiscences tape-recorded during an eight-year
period when Simenon suffered from an ear condition that upset his
sense of balance.
   Apart from writing, which he called ``forced labor,'' Simenon
said he spent most of his life ``obsessed by a frantic sexuality.''
   In two 1977 interviews, he said he had slept with 10,000 women,
sometimes at the pace of three a day, ``to learn the truth'' about
``The Woman.''
   His fortune is estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars,
and a battle could develop over it. His will, he told the Belgian
newspaper Le Soir in 1978, would be ``so precise that many people
will be shocked.''
   To avoid a costly settlement, he refused to divorce his second
wife Denise.
   Simenon stipulated that his ashes join those of his daughter and
favorite child, Marie-Jo, under a 250-year-old cedar outside his
house. She committed suicide in 1978 at age 25.
   In 1981, his ``Intimate Memoirs'' came out, by far the thickest
book to carry his name, which he said would be the last to be
published during his lifetime.
   It was sparked by the suicide of his daughter and tells a
tempestuous story of despair and happiness, of love and sex, of
luxury and the longing to return to what he calls ``the little
people'' of his home country.
   Simenon was repeatedly said to be a candidate for the Nobel Prize
in literature.
   A friend, the late French Nobel laureate Andre Gide, described
Simenon as ``the most novelistic of novelists in French literature
today.''
   The older of two children, Simenon was born Feb. 13, 1903, in the
Belgian town of Liege, shortly after midnight on a Friday. But his
superstitious mother, of upper-class Dutch-German ancestry, had the
date officially registered as Feb. 12.
   The mother, outwardly fretful but inwardly iron-willed, left a
deep imprint on his work, as revealed in ``Pedigree,'' a first
autobiography covering his youth, and in ``Letter To My Mother.''
   His father, who suffered from a heart condition, was an
unambitious insurance company clerk of Breton descent.
   Simenon quit school at 16, going to work as a baker's apprentice
and a bookstore clerk before becoming a reporter for a local
newspaper. That career ended after a satire on his superiors and his
family, including his wealthy uncle who never spoke to him again.
   After the death of his father, Simenon moved to Paris in 1922 and
began churning out novels at a rate of 80 pages a day, chiefly for
consumption by housewives. He wrote anything that sold, from
sentimental stories to adventure books and travelogues, drawing his
basic information from the Larousse encyclopedia.
   In three years, he made enough to rent a chic apartment and own a
chauffeur-driven car and a yacht. His first efforts in serious
literature drew encouragement from the French writer Colette, then
literary editor of the Le Matin newspaper.
   After World War II, he lived for several years in the United
States and Canada, where he produced some of his finest works. In
the early 1960s, Simenon reached a furious peak, writing up to six
books a year.
   In the United States, he divored his French-born first wife of 27
years, Regine, and married Denise Quimet, a Canadian. They settled
in Epalinges, Switzerland, in a 26-room mansion.
   In his ``Intimate Memoirs,'' Simenon described that marriage as
an ``infernal symphony'' that once made him so desperate he
contemplated suicide. The two separated in 1969, with her drawing
alimony payments he said were higher than the salary of a French
prime minister.
   For most of his life, he remarked in one ``Dictee,'' Simenon was
``obsessed by a frantic sexuality.''
   Only after meeting Teresa, Denise's Venice-born chambermaid who
was 20 years his junior, did he find ``complete harmony,'' he
related once. They moved into the ``Maison Rose'' at Lausanne, a
plainly furnished farmhouse dwarfed by high-rise condominiums and
the 250-year-old cedar.
   Simenon is survived by Teresa, Denise and his first wife, Regine,
as well as three sons.

   Dutch voted today in a
parliamentary election that was expected to return longtime Premier
Ruud Lubbers to power but force him to veer to the left in order to
form a government.
   Voter turnout appeared to be high in crisp autumn weather.
   In Amsterdam, polling stations reported that 22 percent of the
electorate had cast ballots within the first three hours after polls
opened. In Rotterdam, that figure was 15 percent.
   Lubbers, the nation's highly popular premier who has led the
government since 1982, was expected return to office for a third
term.
   But pre-election polls predicted that Lubbers, a centrist, may
have to turn to the opposition Labor Party to form a new coalition
government.
   That would result in a swing to the left that could herald an
easing of his seven-year program of austerity and fiscal reform.
   A last-minute opinion poll, conducted Tuesday night, indicated
that although Lubbers' Christian Democrats would win 56 seats in the
150-member Dutch parliament, up two from their current strength, his
right-wing liberal coalition partner would loose at least five of
its 27 seats.
   The poll by the Maurice de Hond polling organization predicted
that the leftist Labor Party will remain at 52 seats, while the
center-left Democrats 66 party was expected to win three seats on
top of their current nine.
   The Green Left, an environmentalist coalition of four left-wing
fringe parties, will jump from three to eight, according to the
telephone poll.
   Such results would make Labor the obvious coalition partner for
the Christian Democrats. Though Lubbers said this week that a Labor
victory would bring ``bad politics,'' he has not ruled out forming a
coalition with any group.
   Voting booths, where the 10-million-member electorate had a
choice of 22 parties, were scheduled to close at 7 p.m. (1 p.m.
EDT). The first election returns were expected about an hour later.
   Lubbers center-right government fell on May 2 in a dispute over
an ambitious plan to clean up the heavily polluted Dutch air, soil
and waterways by the year 2010. A general election had been
scheduled for May 1990.

<TEXT>
   Pete Curley was pleased to supply the
slobbering but lovable canines for Tom Hanks' film ``Turner and
Hooch,'' but he's not all that happy when moviegoers drive to his
home hoping to see his Dogues de Bordeaux.
   ``It's when they pull into the driveway and run around the yard
that I stick my head out the window and say, `It's not open to the
public,''' Curley said.
   He became something of a sensation among his neighbors in rural
Merrimac after they saw him interviewed on cable television about
his contribution to the movie.
   The movie released this summer is about a fastidious detective
who reluctantly takes in a brown and white dog named Hooch after its
owner is murdered. Three of the four large, jowly dogs sold to the
moviemakers by Curley portrayed Hooch in various scenes. A
4-month-old pup also appeared in the film.
   Curley, 34, said the sale to Disney studios was a real boost to
his principal business, the import and export of rare breeds.
   But the movie has led to many calls from people who really
shouldn't own a Dogue de Bordeaux, he said.
   ``There are a lot of people who want to buy them for all the
wrong reasons,'' he said ``For some people it's a macho thing. ...
If someone asks how hard the dog will bite, I don't sell him a dog.''
   The question represents a misunderstanding of the dogs' real
nature, he said. ``Yes, they're very good guard dogs, but they're
also extremely tolerant of children,'' he said.
   Curley said that from his first glimpse of a Dogue de Bordeaux,
which is the national watchdog of France, during a Peace Corps stint
in Guatemala after graduating from the University of
Wisconsin-Stevens Point, he knew he wanted to own a dog like that.
   After the Peace Corps, he was determined to do something that
allowed him to work with animals and to travel. He started to breed
bull mastiffs.
   About eight years ago, he borrowed $1,800, flew to France and
bought his first Dogue de Bordeaux. Last September, his
prize-winning Auriela was named best of show at Ernee, France.
   ``I'm an American, and I beat them on their own turf,'' he said.

   A woman on trial for the slaying of
her lesbian lover will be allowed to use the ``battered spouse
syndrome'' as a defense, ruled a judge who said the type of
relationship makes no difference.
   ``It's a relationship among humans,'' Circuit Judge Tom Waddell
ruled Tuesday over prosecutors' objections that research on battered
women in lesbian cases is scant.
   Research on women battered by men could be applied to women
battered by women, Waddell said. ``I believe they are essentially
the same,'' he said. ``In other words, sex has nothing to do with
these problems.''
   The battered spouse syndrome has been used successfully by women
who killed their abusive male lovers.
   Annette Green, 30, admitted killing Ivonne Julio, her live-in
lover of 11 years, but said she had been beaten and tormented for
years.
   Neighbors, friends and co-workers testified Ms. Julio often beat
Ms. Green and inflicted broken bones, bruises and black eyes.

   Fourteen people packed into a sedan, none
wearing a seatbelt, survived a 70-foot plunge into a rock quarry
after the car was forced off the road, police said.
   The car carrying three women and 11 children crashed through a
chain-link fense Monday night and landed upright at the bottom of
the quarry, said Detective Michael Markey.
   ``It's a miracle that nobody was seriously hurt,'' Markey said.
``I'm really surprised. The car didn't roll over either. It just

   Passenger Vanessa Burns, 34, suffered a broken ankle and jaw and
was in stable condition at Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical

   Nine other passengers were hospitalized in stable to fair
condition. Four children were treated and released.
   The children ranged in age from 9 months to 16 years.
   Witnesses said a car swerved in front of the Oldsmobile Delta 98
and caused it to plow through the fence at nearly 40 mph.

<HEAD>More Teachers On Strike, Nearly 150,000 Students Nationwide Affected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers in two more Michigan districts walked picket lines
today, joining strikes that have idled nearly 150,000 students in
seven states.
   Pay and benefits were the major issues for the estimated 8,000
teachers across the nation on strike since early last week.
   In Michigan, teachers in four districts voted to walk out
Tuesday; two districts picketed on Tuesday and 310 teachers from the
other two marched today. In all, eight districts and 1,600 teachers
are on strike in Michigan.
   Strikes in 18 districts in Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania,
Washington, Montana, Ohio, and California have affected some 147,900
students.
   In the largest district on strike, Sacramento, Calif., the
teachers union said the the walkout could be long. Nearly 80 percent
of the 2,300 district employees represented by the union honored the
strike that began Tuesday.
   The teachers are seeking a 12.7 percent raise this year and 6.5
percent for last year.
   Teachers in Elgin voted to strike and officials called off
classes for today for about 27,000 students in the northern Illinois
district. Some 6,800 Quincy, Ill., students continued their summer
break in a week-long teachers walkout.
   In Montana's 12,500-student Great Falls district, negotiators
scheduled their first bargaining session in more than a week today.
But a negotiator for the district said the two sides are ``miles
apart'' on salaries.
   Classes were canceled today for 2,300 Bristol, R.I., students as
teachers gathered to decide whether to launch the state's first
teacher strike in three years.
   In Massachusetts, teachers in Everett voted to strike on the
verge of the 1989 school year.
   Their counterparts in Chelsea agreed to an unusual six-month
contract with Boston University, which will run the schools in the
city outside Boston under an unprecedented arrangement approved by
the Legislature earlier this year.
   Teachers in at least 30 Massachusetts cities and towns are still
without contracts as schools prepare to open over the next 10 days.

<HEAD>Survivors of Plane Crash Taken From Jungle, One More Dies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescue teams today began evacuating
survivors from a domestic jetliner that crashed three days ago in
thick Amazon jungle, killing nine of the 54 people aboard, an air
force spokesman said.
   A woman airlifted from the wreckage of the Varig airlines jet
died en route to Brasilia, said spokesman Col. Jose Maria dos Santos
said in Brasilia.
   Santos said an air force helicopter was ferrying 41 survivors
from the crash site to a ranch near Sao Jose do Xingu, in
north-central Mato Grosso state 1,050 miles northwest of Rio de
Janeiro.
   ``We've got 11 in the air and 30 more at the site, but we'll get
them all out today,'' Santos said by telephone.
   On Tuesday, four survivors walked hours through the jungle to the
ranch and radioed for help. Searchers had been unable to locate the
plane or to confirm the crash since the Boeing 737 went down Sunday.
   The jungle prevented the helicopter from landing at the crash
site, Santos said. He said it had to hover over the wreckage while
victims were raised by winch.
   ``The plane opened a clearing in the jungle when it crashed, but
it's not big enough for the helicopter to land,'' the spokesman said.
   A 3-year-old girl, identified as Bruna Costa, was flown out with
a concussion and a crushed leg, he said.
   The girl's mother, Marinez Coimbra, said those killed were mostly
sitting in the front of the plane.
   ``Those in the front suffered the worst,'' Mrs. Coimbra said in a
live televised interview from Brasila.
   The survivors were taken to the Curumare ranch, 28 miles away,
where a Brazilian-made, twin-engine Bandeirante plane took off from
a dirt airstrip and flew to the Serra do Cachimbo Air Force Base,
185 miles away in neighboring Para state, Santos said.
   From the Air Force base, the survivors would be flown to
Brasilia, he said.
   Medical teams first reached the crash site late Tuesday night,
but officials decided to wait until today to start removing
survivors. The Air Force parachuted in kits of food, water and
medicine.
   Officials said the survivors, including the four who walked out,
were generally in good condition.
   The plane disappeared Sunday on the last leg of a regularly
scheduled flight between the southeastern city of Sao Paulo and
Belem.
   Varig, the national carrier, said there were six crew members on
the flight and all survived. It said the crew and all of the
passengers on the domestic flight were Brazilians, it had no
information about the people who died.
   A television camerman aboard a search plane took some footage of
the crash site, but visibility was poor because of smoke from
burning brush fires and fog. The fuselage appeared to be intact, and
it was not clear if the plane may have landed in an area cleared by
ranchers.
   Air Force Ministry spokesman Col. Ronaldo Borges said the pilot
had reported problems in the navigational system Sunday, and plane
strayed far off course. Two hours after his scheduled arrival in
Belem, he radioed the airport at Carajas, 600 miles from Belem,
asking for permission to make an emergency landing.
   Ten minutes later, a Cruzeiro airline plane received the Varig
pilot's final message, saying he was running out of fuel, only one
engine was working and he would make an emergency landing in the
jungle, Borges said.

   Police are expected to recommend that six
Israeli reserve officers accused of training Colombian gunmen be
tried on charges of illegally exporting military expertise, a senior
police official said today.
   The police official also confirmed front-page reports carried by
three major dailies saying that investigators have found no evidence
to support suspicions that the Israelis trained assassins for drug
lords in Colombia.
   The six Israelis have said they were training farmers to defend
themselves against attacks by leftist guerrillas.
   Trying the officers would be an unusual crackdown by the defense
establishment on Israelis involved in overseas weapons deals. Often
such officers are protected by their reputations as wartime heroes.
   News of the army officers' alleged involvement caused a public
uproar, partly out of embarrassment over allegations of their links
with the Medellin drug cartel and its assassination campaign in
Colombia.
   The investigation of six Israelis of the security firm Hod
Hahanit, or Spearhead, began Aug. 27 after an American television
network showed a uniformed man speaking Hebrew during a training
session of supposed drug assassins.
   The senior police official said the investigation should be
completed early next week.
   Israeli reports said Colombian police have failed to give the
Israelis any evidence of narcotics-related crimes. The investigators
have questioned the suspects about their involvement and questioned
defense officials on licensing regulations. Their information
indicates the suspects violated Israeli law by failing to obtain a
license before holding military training courses overseas, the
police officer said.
   The charge carries a maximum punishment of seven years
imprisonment. A lesser charge could be brought following expected
plea bargaining, the police official said.
   Yediot Ahronot newspaper identified the Israelis likely to stand
trial as three reserve officers, Yair Klein, Amatzia Shoali and
Avraham Zadaka, as well as their associates Teddi Melnick, Dror Eyal
and Yitzhak Shoshani-Mariot, who mediated the deals in Colombia. All
six have been questioned by police.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has said he denied the officers a
license to train gunmen in Colombia.
   Klein, a lieutenant colonel in the reserves, has argued he did
not need a license because he was training cattle farmers, not
officials. He also has denied having anything to do with drug
dealers.
   Asked about rpeorts he will stand trial, Klein told Hadashot
daily: ``This is a technical violation. When it reaches the court,
I'm sure I will be acquitted.''
   Klein commanded an infantry batallion in Israel's 1982 Lebanon
invasion and began his career in weapons dealing by selling arms to
the Christian Phalange militia in Beirut after completing active
military duty in 1985.

<HEAD>School District Limits Drug-Test Plans to Athletes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FLOSSMOOR, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The school board has dropped a plan to
give random drug tests to all high school students in
extracurricular activities _ from the band to the math club _ and
decided to screen only athletes.
   More than 100 parents and students packed the board room Tuesday
night for the three-hour debate on amending the testing policy in
the Chicago suburb. Some parents complained about the cost of
widespread testing.
   The Homewood-Flossmoor School Board voted 5-2 to restrict the
tests to athletes. The board is expected to decide in two weeks how
to conduct the tests.
   Three weeks ago, the board adopted a policy that would have
tested every high school student in extracurricular activities. The
district's high school has 2,100 students; 1,500 were in
interscholastic activities last year.
   Superintendent Ed Rachford had said that all students
representing the school in after-school activities should be subject
to drug testing.
   Board member Robert Butler, who offered the amendment restricting
the tests, said limiting the tests to athletes would face less of a
constitutional challenge than widespread testing of many students.
   A federal appeals court last year unanimously ruled that a high
school near Lafayette, Ind., could randomly test athletes. Only a
handful of high schools across the country test athletes for drugs.

   An undercover federal agent was shot to
death and another was wounded today while investigating an alien
smuggling operation, police said.
   Officers sealed off a neighborhood near the shooting scene in the
parking lot of a convenience store and arrested four suspects, one
by one, by 7 a.m., about 5{ hours after the shootings, police said.
   The agents were members of an Immigration and Naturalization
Service smuggling unit and had arranged to meet with the suspects in
the parking lot, said police Sgt. Rene Martin.
   ``As the agents approached and attempted to make contact, the
suspects fired at the agents,'' Martin said. ``Two backup agents
came onto the scene and exchanged fire. Some of the suspects got
back into the vehicle, and the vehicle drove away.''
   The car was found abandoned a few blocks away.
   Arrested were three men and a woman, Martin said.
   One agent was pronounced dead at Valley Medical Center, and the
other was taken into surgery, police said.
   A Highway Patrol helicopter with a searchlight helped look for
the suspects in the dark.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Urge Tough U.S. Stand Toward Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 200 House members are asking Secretary
of State James A. Baker III to abandon the Bush administration's
hopes for a moderate leadership in Iran and recognize instead
Iranian resistance groups seeking to topple the government.
   In a letter initiated by Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., the
lawmakers also called on the administration to work with its allies
and impose an arms and oil boycott against Iran.
   President Bush has taken a conciliatory tone toward the new
government that took power in Iran following the death earlier this
year of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Bush has sent messages to newly
elected President Hashemi Rafsanjani saying Iran could end its
international isolation by releasing the eight Americans held
hostage by Iranian-backed militants in Lebanon.
   But the congressional letter, signed by 121 Democrats and 65
Republicans, warned the administration against ``continuing to
speculate and hope for the miraculous emergence of moderates from
within the present ruling clique.''
   It said ``those who have been identified as moderates, including
... Rafsanjani ... have continued the repressive policies of
Khomeini.''
   The lawmakers said it remains the responsibility of the Iranian
people, including the opposition group People's Mujahedeen of Iran,
to ``bring about change and a new order in Iran.''

<DATELINE>BAIKONUR COSMODROME, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two cosmonauts orbited the
Earth today and prepared to climb aboard the space station Mir after
a four-month break in the Soviet manned space program forced by
failures and cost disputes.
   Commander Alexander S. Viktorenko and engineer Alexander A.
Serebrov rode a trail of orange flame into a star-filled night sky
early today aboard a rocket emblazoned with advertising.
   Scientists at Baikonur Cosmodrome applauded when their Soyuz TM-8
capsule reached orbit nine minutes later, and official reports said
all was well with the crew. The capsule dropped two booster rockets,
one carrying a 150-foot-high ad for an Italian insurance company.
   The capsule is to dock Friday with Mir space station, which was
unmanned at the end of April because of criticism of the cost of the
space program and because two new modules were not ready.
   The government newspaper Izvestia today said the new modules will
add 60 square yards to the cramped living area in space, ``and more
important, sharply increase the research capabilities of Mir.''
   ``As a whole, the crew is getting the possibility of carrying out
on a contemporary level, work in the fields of geophysics,
astrophysics, technology and biology,'' Izvestia said.
   Officials said the new modules are nearly finished and the two
cosmonauts will attach them in October and February, before they are
replaced in March. Mir already is joined with Kvant, an astrophysics
laboratory.
   The first new module features a shower and sink, airlock for
spacewalks and incubator in which Japanese quail eggs will be
hatched to study the effects of weightlessness on heredity. The
second has a telescopic camera for studying the stars, a docking
port for the Buran shuttle and equipment to grow vegetables.
   Tass, in another effort to boost the space program, today
reported space research has brought $19 billion in profits through
improved weather forecasting, communications, navigation and
transport rescue.
   Viktorenko and Serebrov have a busy schedule during their
six-month mission, which also is an important public relations
exercise.
   Soviet officials have stressed such space flights can yield
practical dividends, and pounded home the theme in the final hours
before liftoff.
   To help their space program pay more of its own way, they even
allowed advertising.
   One of three stages of the 150-foot booster rocket, painted
orange, carried an ad for the Italian company Generali. Others, for
a Soviet electronics company and ``New Dawn'' perfume, were
displayed on a side of the launch pad and in a room where the
cosmonauts met reporters Monday night.
   Mir was unexpectedly vacated in April because two add-on modules
were not ready and the Kremlin did not want to keep a crew aboard
while legislators and ordinary people were demanding more spending
at home.
   ``If we had colossal sums, we could have had the two modules on
time, but we have limited resources like everyone else,'' Lt. Gen.
Vladimir A. Shatalov, head of cosmonaut training, told The
Associated Press.
   Leaving the Mir unoccupied for only the second time since its
February 1986 launch showed a new sensitivity to public opinion by
the Soviet space bureaucracy.
   Gorbachev's political reforms have given space officials
something in common with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
Administration: opposition from a skeptical public and legislators
trying to trim a budget deficit of $192 billion.
   Space officials invited reporters from all 15 Soviet republics
and several Western countries to watch the blastoff at the huge
Baikonur Cosmodrome, 1,560 miles southeast of Moscow in Kazakhstan.
   They also showed off the new space shuttle Buran and its ground
facilities.
   In a scene unlikely at NASA's Cape Canaveral, journalists were
even allowed on a flatbed railroad car that carried the 310-ton
capsule and booster assembly to the launch pad at dawn Monday.
   Chief engineer Yuri P. Semenov said Moscow spent $2 billion on
its civilian space program last year and the TM-8 mission cost
$138.8.
   He estimated potential economic benefits from the flight, such as
discovering mineral deposits using Mir's remote sensing equipment,
at $132 million.

   A train carrying hazardous material derailed

officials said.
   Five Cotton Belt Railroad cars jumped the tracks about 5:15 a.m.,
said Ray Briggler of the state Office of Emergency Services. The
sheriff's office said two cars caught fire. A column of black smoke
rose above the city.
   One burning car was hauling acetic acid, a flammable liquid used
as a food additive and in the production of petroleum products,
officials said.
   One person, believed to part of the train crew, was injured,
officials said. The extent of the injuries were not immediately
known.
   People living within a half-mile of the accident were moved from
their homes in this city of about 1,300 south of Little Rock,
Briggler said.

   AIDS victims should not be isolated or given
special treatment in U.S. schools, according to a new guide that
says up-to-date knowledge about the disease should quiet fears that
the virus can be easily transmitted.
   ``Until now, many people have been fearful that (AIDS) could be
transmitted at school,'' the National Association of State Boards of
Education said today in the booklet that updates guidelines issued
by the Centers for Disease Control in 1985. ``We have enough
information to stop worrying about this.
   ``What we do need to worry about _ and the place to put our
energy and concern is into education.''
   The guidelines, endorsed by a variety of health and education
groups, call for confidentiality but oppose mandatory testing of
school pupils or employees for AIDS.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a fatal disease
that destroys the body's ability to fight infection. The disease is
spread through the exchange of body fluids infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus, popularly called HIV.
   The guide said about 1.5 million people in the United States are
infected with the HIV virus. More than 102,000 cases of AIDS have
been diagnosed in this country since 1981, and more than 59,000 of
those victims have died
   The new booklet gives educators up-to-date knowledge about AIDS
and how the disease is spread, said Brenda Welburn of the school
board association. Previous guidelines suggested that schools be
cautious about children who bite or who weren't toilet trained, in
case the AIDS virus might be transmitted through saliva or handling
diapers.
   ``We now know that HIV is not transmitted through saliva or
urine,'' said Welburn. ``Even the possibility that the AIDS virus
would be transmitted through simple exposure to blood is extremely
low.''
   So the suggested policy is to allow students who are infected to
attend school and be entitled to all rights, privileges and services
received by other students, the guide said.
   ``No school employee shall be terminated, non-renewed, demoted,
suspended, transferred or subjected to adverse action based solely
on the fact that he or she is infected with HIV,'' it said.
   Those who become ill should be allowed to retain eligibility for
all benefits that are provided for other school employees with
long-term diseases or disabling conditions, the guide said.
   The main cause for concern would be if the infected person had a
secondary infection, such as tuberculosis, that might pose a serious
risk to others.
   Confidentiality is another key point in the new guidelines, which
were developed by a panel of 20 organizations representing law,
medicine, public health and education groups.
   It is now known that the AIDS virus is not transmitted through
casual interactions between individuals, so the guide said a school
official who learns that ``someone in school has AIDS'' can handle
the situation in a standard, confidential manner.
   ``It is not necessary to share the identity of a person who has
the AIDS virus with a large number of people,'' said Welburn, noting
that decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis.
   Mandatory testing has no place in the nation's schools, the
guidelines said. The suggested policy states, ``Mandatory screening
for communicable diseases that are not spread by casual contact,
such as HIV infection, shall not be a condition for school entry or
attendance, or for employment or continued employment.''
   The guide, entitled ``Someone at School Has AIDS,'' was developed
for state and local policymakers by the association in conjunction
with the Centers for Disease Control, based in Atlanta. About 15
national organizations are recommending the book to their
memberships.
   The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials
described the guide as ``clear, concise and straightforward
information,'' while the Council of Chief State School Officers
predicted the booklet ``will be of inestimable value'' because, ``It
is both scientifically accurate and sensitive to the mission of
schools.''
   Jim Williams of the National Education Association, Health
Information Network, said, ``We revised our policy on the issue of
confidentiality and testing of students'' based on the guide's
recommendation.
   Beverly Farquhar, director of the National Association of School
Nurses, added, ``This has really helped our cause a great deal.''
She explained that school officials, who in the past had been
reluctant, now enthusiastically allow the association to conduct for
teachers special workshops on the proper handling of bodily fluids.
   ``The guide reinforces universal techniques,'' she said.

   A bomb exploded at a restaurant in the
drug trafficking center of Medellin, and police said today that four
people were injured, including two American journalists.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast Tuesday
night, but drug lords recently declared war on the government after
it began cracking down on the traffickers for a string of bombings
and assassinations.
   Earlier Tuesday, two bombs exploded at banks in central Medellin,
injuring seven people, the radio network Caracol reported.
   In Bogota on Tuesday, the mayor banned large public gatherings,
fearing terrorist attacks by drug gangs trying to halt the
U.S.-backed crackdown, which police say has virtually paralyzed
Colombia's cocaine-producing labs.
   In Washington Tuesday night, President Bush declared war on drug
traffickers and users and praised the Colombian government's
2{-week-old offensive against the world's most powerful drug barons,
who are responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the
United States.
   The speech was broadcast live in Colombia.
   Also Tuesday, an army colonel's wife was shot to death on a
Bogota street, but police said it was not clear if the killing was
related to the campaign against the cocaine cartels.
   The restaurant bombing in Medellin occurred 9 p.m. Tuesday at the
Bella Epoca. It injured reporter Bernardette Pardo and cameraman
Carlos Ignacio Corrales, who work for the Miami-based,
Spanish-language station WLTV and for the Spanish language network
Univision. Both are U.S. citizens.
   Also injured were Jorge Saenz, an independent Colombian reporter
and documentary film maker, and his wife, Angela. Saenz was working
for Ms. Pardo as a local producer and assistant.
   Ms. Pardo said in a telephone interview from her hospital bed in
Medellin today that she had a broken shoulder blade, fractured
vertebrae and facial cuts.
   Corrales suffered a gash on the head, and the Saenzes suffered
bruises, she said.
   Ms. Pardo, a native of Cuba, said she and other injury victims
were sitting at a table on the restaurant's terrace when the bomb
exploded in the restaurant's bathroom.
   ``One minute we're sitting there. The next minute we're blown on
the floor. Everything fell on us,'' she said.
   She said police suspected a couple who had been in the restaurant
may have planted the bomb, she said. The couple left before the
explosion, she said.
   Police said the bomb was made of about 22 pounds of dynamite.
   President Virgilio Barco launched the anti-narcotics offensive on
Aug. 18 in response to the assassinations of a judge, a police
colonel and a highly popular presidential candidate, Luis Carlos
Galan.
   As part of the campaign, Barco revived extradition to the United
States, which had been nullified by Colombian Supreme Court rulings
in 1987 and 1989. In Bogota, the national capital and the most
populous Colombian city, Mayor Andres Pastrana on Tuesday decreed a
ban on public marches and demonstrations as a safety measure.
   ``The public order of the country, as well as that of the capital
of the republic, has been notoriously threatened in recent days,
putting the citizenry in imminent danger,'' said his decree. It
established a 60-day jail term and a fine of $150 for violators.
   About 6 million of the country's 30 million people live in
metropolitan Bogota.
   On Saturday, a powerful bomb blast injured 80 people and
destroyed the offices of El Espectador, a prominent Bogota daily
that has crusaded against drug trafficking. There have been almost
daily bombings and other attacks, most of them in Medellin, by drug
traffickers who declared ``total and absolute war'' in response to
the government crackdown.
   A nightime curfew has been in effect since last Wednesday in
Medellin, 150 miles north of Bogota.
   The National Police said Tuesday that since the crackdown began,
cocaine production in Colombia has practically stopped and that
prices should go up as a result. Authorities say they have destroyed
252 cocaine labs this year.
   The Bogota daily El Tiempo, citing unidentified police sources,
on Tuesday forecast a cocaine shortage in the United States. It also
said 2.2 pounds of cocaine, which now costs $1,500 in Colombia and
$10,000 wholesale in Miami, would go up in price ``considerably'' in
coming months.
   The government's offensive has included the seizure of drug
traffickers' mansions, office buildings and other real estate and a
fortune in helicopters, airplanes, cars, racehorses and other goods.
   The United States has responded by allocating $65 million in
military aid, including two C-130 transport planes, eight A-37
observation and attack jets and five UH-1H ``Huey'' helicopters
already delivered to Colombian anti-narcotics forces.
   According to a U.S. Embassy communique, more gear will arrive in
coming weeks.
   In his drug speech, Bush proposed spending $7.9 billion to fight
the drug problem. That money would include a fourfold increase in
the amount of military and law enforcement aid for Colombia, Bolivia
and Peru, to $261.2 million in 1990.
   He called it the downpayment on a $2 billion, five-year anti-drug
program in the Andean region.
   Bush also said he and Barco hoped to convene a summit to
``coordinate an inter-American strategy against the cartels.''

   Youngsters who look after themselves after school
for 11 or more hours a week are twice as likely to abuse alcohol,
tobacco and marijuana as children who aren't ``latchkey kids,'' a
report says.
   The study of nearly 5,000 eighth-graders in the Los Angeles and
San Diego areas found a higher risk of drug and alcohol abuse and
smoking in two-parent as well as single-parent households and in
affluent as well as poor ones.
   The authors speculated that time spent alone promotes
experimentation with drugs and alcohol.
   The study is published in this month's issue of Pediatrics, the
journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which is based in
suburban Elk Grove Village.
   Adolescents who abuse drugs and alcohol while caring for
themselves may be ``manifesting a desire to display their sense of
maturity and independence,'' said the study.
   The findings support recent articles that suggest some problem
behavior among youngsters can be linked at least in part to the
amount of time they spend without adult supervision, particularly
after school, the authors said.

<TEXT>
   At least 30 East Germans tired of
awaiting permission for a mass exodus to the West made a risky
overnight dash across the Hungarian border into Austria, the Red
Cross said today.
   In Bonn, West German officials acknowledged they were making
little progress in changing the minds of Communist East German
leaders who intervened with Hungarian authorities to block the
departure of about 5,500 refugees.
   East German officials on Tuesday set up camp outside a tent
community in Budapest sheltering many of the would-be emigres and
began trying to persuade them to return to East Germany. The
refugees hope to cross Austria and enter West Germany, where they
will automatically receive citizenship.
   The latest escape involved more refugees than those of recent
days, when increased Hungarian border patrols and prospects of an
imminent sponsored exodus apparently deterred East Germans from
fleeing illegally to Austria.
   Austrian Red Cross officials said the 30 East Germans made it
across the border, where Hungary began dismantling fortifications in
May but still maintains some stretches of barbed wire and other
barriers.
   In Budapest, refugees gathered near a brown-and-white trailer of
the East German Embassy towed into place across the road from their
camp.
   But none approached the door in the first hour, and several of
those waiting to leave for Austria and then West Germany derided
their hard-line Communist country's attempts to win them back.
   ``They must really be stupid to come here,'' said a heavy-set
East German who was among the first to set up residence at the
Zugliget tent camp when it opened mid-August. ``But I guess they
have no choice, it's either victory or Siberia for them.''
   ``It's a disgrace,'' yelled a woman in another small group. ``No
one is going to go in there anyway.''
   Relief worker Csilla Von Boeselager said camp residents have been
asked to refrain from ``unwise actions'' against the East German
diplomats or their trailer.
   First Secretary Dieter Grahmann of the East German Embassy told
reporters crowding their trailer that any refugees were free ``to
discuss the situation'' with him or Second Secretary Wolfgang
Forster.
   East Germany increased efforts Tuesday to persuade the refugees
to return home, with Grahmann handing out leaflets promising no
penalties for those who give up their quest to go West.
   He retreated after being mobbed by a hostile crowd.
   West German government spokesman Hans Klein told reporters in
Bonn today, ``There is no indication that East Germany is prepared
to change its position.'' He would not say when the refugees might
be allowed to leave.
   However, Foreign Ministry spokesman Juergen Chrobog said the West
German government remains confident a solution can be found soon.
   ``The Hungarian government knows how urgent a solution is,'' he
said. ``We are convinced that a humanitarian solution will follow
soon.
   Several refugees told reporters today that they are resigned to
long stays in Hungary, after officials deflated hopes that their
departure for West Germany was imminent.
   ``They're going to let us out anyway; there's no reason for
desperation,'' said one refugee. ``I've waited to leave for the West
for seven years at home, another few months won't matter.''
   With legal travel difficult to the West but relatively easy to
Hungary, a liberal Soviet bloc country, East Germans began fleeing
from Hungary to Austria in droves after Hungary removed some wire
barriers and observation posts from its 120-mile western border.
   Hungary has defied a bilateral agreement with East Germany and
refused to send back East Germans trying to flee their homeland.
   West German politicians said last week the Hungarian leadership
also has promised to let would-be emigres go to West Germany, which
grants them automatic citizenship and generous social benefits.
   Expectations were heightened last week when West German
authorities built five tent cities to house the East Germans in
Bavaria. But senior Hungarian officials cautioned Monday and Tuesday
that departure could be weeks away because Hungary still is seeking
grudging East German agreement.
   Peter Dickscheidt of the West German Maltesian Aid Organization
said about 5,500 would-be emigres were registered by early today at
the four Budapest camps and a fifth on Balaton Lake, 90 miles
southwest of the capital.

   The government held a general
election today that measured white attitudes toward apartheid,
specifically a proposal by the governing party to share limited
power with blacks.
   Hundreds of thousands of disenfranchised blacks staged a general
strike capping nationwide protests of the parliamentary election.
   Factories, businesses, schools and transportation services closed
down in major cities, where more than 90 percent of black workers
and most students stayed home.
   Police said they used tear gas, rubber bullets and birdshot to
halt protests at election booths and to stop crowds from throwing
stones and erecting barricades in black, Indian and mixed-race
townships. At least 15 people were arrested, including journalists.
   In a mixed-race suburb east of Johannesburg, police escorted
television crews away from a demonstration before using tear gas and
whips to disperse protesters. Witnesses said many demonstrators were
children. Police arrested two men.
   Police also arrested 13 anti-election protesters at a voting
station in Durban.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions said more than 1
million blacks participated in Tuesday's demonstrations, rallies and
strikes at which police arrested 500 people.
   Train service into Cape Town was delayed today by an early
morning explosion on the track, the South African Transport Service
said. No injuries were reported.
   Acting President F.W. de Klerk smiled, shook hands and enjoyed a
champagne breakfast at his Pretoria-area polling booth. Officials
say the vote is the most crucial since the governing National Party
came to power on promises of strict race segregation in 1948.
   De Klerk's Nationalists are expected to lose up to 30 of their
123 parliamentary seats, mostly to the Conservative Party which
favors strict race discrimination.
   Nevertheless, the Nationalists are expected to retain a majority
in Parliament's dominant white chamber after promoting a plan to
begin sharing some power with the country's 28 million blacks.
   The government said 3,170,667 whites were eligible to vote.
Turnout was reported sluggish because of freezing temperatures and
biting winds early today, but lines formed at polling places after
noon, government radio said.
   Whites voted for members of the white House of Assembly. More
than 665,000 Indians and 1.7 million people of mixed race were
eligible to vote for separate Parliament chambers with little power.
Blacks have no vote.
   The polls opened at 7 a.m. and were to close at 9 p.m. Final
election results are not expected until Thursday.
   Police armed with handguns were stationed at most polling booths.
Major black townships around Durban, Cape Town, Pretoria,
Johannesburg and eastern Cape cities were quiet.
   Virtually no taxi-vans were operating, and buses and trains to
the cities were 70 percent to 100 percent empty.
   Black worker absenteeism ranged from 72 percent in the industrial
heartland around Johannesburg to virtually 100 percent in the
eastern Cape cities of Port Elizabeth and Uitenhage, said the Labor
Monitoring Group at the University of the Witwatersrand.
   ``The stayaway is very comprehensive, with most companies
reporting absenteeism of over 70 percent,'' said Brian Angus,
director of the Steel and Engineering Industries Federation, whose
members employ 350,000 mostly black workers.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said, ``I'm not paying a great
deal of attention'' to the elections. ``I'm more interested in how
many people stay away. I would hope that white South Africans would
be aware that the bulk of the people in this country are not voting
and they should join us in getting rid of the system.''
   State television said low voter turnout would increase the
chances of a hung Parliament, in which no party would have a
majority. In that case, a coalition government would have to be
formed or a new election called.
   For the first time since 1953, political analysts predict the
Nationalists could receive less than half the white vote. But as
long as they poll more than 40 percent and retain 84 of their 123
seats, they will remain the governing party.
   The right-wing Conservative Party has 22 of the white chamber's
166 elected seats, the anti-apartheid Democrats have 20 and one seat
in the last Parliament was held by a now-defunct moderate party.
   The government-run Radio South Africa said the elections ``have a
vital bearing on how South Africa enters the future and how this
country will look in succeeding decades.''
   The Nationalistts have proposed negotiating a new constitution
giving blacks a share of national power within five years, but also
protecting against a loss of white power.
   The Conservatives say negotiating with blacks inevitably will
lead to black majority rule.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout
the country:
   Sept. 2
   Vicksburg (Miss.) Evening Post on Colombia:
   The legitimate government of Colombia in Bogota has, at last,
declared war on the shadow government of drug lords and thugs who
have been calling the shots from their own capital city of Medellin.
   The bad guys have been bullying and bribing government
authorities for years. Murder is the favorite tool of intimidation.
About 220 Colombian judges have been gunned down in the past eight
years.
   The Medellin kingpins, who are believed to traffic most of the
cocaine entering the United States, reportedly are most afraid of
being prosecuted in the U.S. justice system.
   Small wonder. The traffickers can always replace the guns and
livestock the government confiscates. But prosecution and conviction
in the United States would be a real blow that could take them out
of action for years.
   President Bush deserves credit for quickly offering U.S.
assistance to Colombian President Virgilio Barco Vargas. He doesn't
advise sending U.S. troops to Colombia to fight. Nor do we.
   But an effective extradition program could certainly let drug
terrorists know that they will find no safe harbor from U.S. law in
Colombia.
   At the same time, U.S. officials must reassure the Colombian
government that we are doing something to shrink the American
cocaine market that is fueling their civil war.

   The Herald, Everett, Wash., on war and peace:
   The European phase of World War II began 50 years ago, making it
a half-century since the start of the most ghastly conflict mankind
has ever seen. The war brought unparalleled destruction and
suffering, and left a legacy of atomic terror under which humanity
still lives.
   Both in Europe and the Pacific, the war stemmed from unchecked
aggression, self-delusion and virulent, racist nationalism. A
half-century later, many complex explanations can be brought to bear
to help clarify the course of events, but the fact of unrestrained
self-indulgences _ amounting to a monstrous evil _ continues to lie
at the heart of any sensible understanding of the roots of the war.
   Yet in the face of organized evil, an entire generation of free
men and women stood up. The fight was harrowing and costly, but it
was necessary and successful.
   One of the highest measures of the success stands in the general
peace that has prevailed since the end of the war. This peace stands
as a reminder that people of dedication and good will can prevail in
times of continued international tensions as well as in war.

   Los Angeles Herald Examiner on the outlook for unions:
   Labor unions represent only 17 percent of today's American work
force, down from 26 percent at its 1953 peak.
   There are few better examples of the dwindling clout of organized
labor than the United Auto Workers' humiliating defeat at Nissan's
Smyrna, Tenn., plant. Despite fervent union organizing, relatively
well-paid workers rejected the UAW by a 2-to-1 margin.
   From Atlanta to Houston, other cities have experienced a miniboom
in businesses, with industries relocating south of the Mason-Dixon
to take advantage of the general anti-union, right-to-work ethos
there.
   ... Is the U.S. destined to follow the lead of Japan, where
unions are basically a compliant arm of management? Not likely.
Traditions, even in America, are hard to kill. ...
   (Unions will) have to focus on what the new generation of workers
is increasingly demanding. ... Rather than bargaining for raises,
union negotiators will be asking for parental leave, flexible work
schedules and more employer help in caring for children and aged
parents ... (and with) medical costs rising, the basic family
benefit of health and hospitalization insurance already is a
controversial labor issue.
   ... Unions had better take an increasing interest in family
issues or risk being left out of employer-employee negotiations.

   The Flint (Mich.) Journal on credit cards for children:
   Our deficit-laden nation is trying to dig itself out of a
worrisome financial mess caused by a reckless credit-card mentality.
All around us are people who are up to the eyebrows in debt from
saying ``Charge it!'' too often. Economists are saying our country's
fiscal problems aren't going to improve unless consumers start
saving more.
   So what does Denver's Young Americans Bank, which caters to
youths, decide to do? Issue a kids-only MasterCard. Card holders
must be at least 12 and have a parent co-sign. The card carries a
$15 membership fee and 18.8 percent interest on unpaid balances.
Youngsters can't go on wild spending sprees with their new plastic.
The cards have a $100 credit limit.
   What it does not limit is reinforcement of the principle of
instant gratification. That's not something most children (and
government officials, come to think of it) have a problem
understanding. What they really need are lessons in the value of
working hard, saving and paying as you go.

   The Phoenix Gazette on education:
   If American University president Richard Berendzen's view of the
future is accurate, we are at a zenith in educational attainment.
How's that for a scary thought?
   At his annual back-to-school breakfast with reporters at the
National Press Club in Washington, D.C., recently, Berendzen
predicted declining college achievement standards for the 1990s and
beyond.
   He relates plunging standards to demographic trends and fierce
competition for high school graduates: ``Starting in 1993 the number
of 18-year-olds will rise ... but 80 percent of the increase will be
students who are black, Hispanic or Asian,'' he said.
   According to Berendzen, the real growth industry will be in the
community colleges, most of which will be providing remedial
education.
   Unfortunately, educators' repeated recitations of the link
between ethnicity, income and poor achievement doesn't contribute
anything that isn't already known.
   John H. Bunzel, president of San Jose State University, writing
in the The Wall Street Journal, suggests that schools stop focusing
on what is outside of their control and instead ``concentrate on
what should be their primary mission: strong instructional
leadership that will foster the academic preparation and performance
of students.''
   Unless public education is restructured to permit all parents,
not just wealthy ones, to choose schools that fit that description,
Berendzen's dismal prediction is almost certain to come true.

   Kennebec Journal, Augusta, Maine, on ambassadorial appointments:
   Should President Bush have named as ambassador to Spain a Florida
real estate developer who donated at least $100,000 to Bush's
presidential campaign _ but doesn't know beans about Spain?
   More than any recent president, Bush has rewarded wealthy
campaign donors with lengthy stays abroad. Of the 44 ambassadorships
he has filled so far, only 14 went to career diplomats, rather than
political appointees _ less than a third.
   By contrast, even Ronald Reagan, profoundly suspicious of federal
bureaucrats, and the State Department in particular, appointed about
65 percent from career civil servants.
   Not that ambassadors chosen from other fields don't sometimes do
a fine job. They do. But ability is important. There's a big
difference between an oil baron who'd like to live abroad and David
Bruce or Mike Mansfield _ to name two superb diplomats who came from
outside the State Department ....

   Sept. 4
   The Philadelphia Inquirer on President Bush's ambassadors:
   President Bush has doled out ambassadorships to so many cronies
that it's hard to single out someone as the least qualified. Former
Sen. Chic Hecht, who once argued that Nevada shouldn't get a
``nuclear waste suppository,'' liked being sent to the Bahamas
because of the golf links there.
   Then there's Peter F. Secchia, a building supply executive and
GOP stalwart, who kicked off his tour of duty as ambassador in Rome
with a little joke. The new Italian navy, he said, has
glass-bottomed boats _ so it can see the old Italian navy.
   Still, the most embarrassing nomination may be that of developer
Joseph Zappala, who gave the GOP more than $100,000, to be the main
man in Spain. A foreign affairs neophyte, he knows little about
Spain. Mr. Zappala can't even speak Spanish.
   Yet, unless the Senate says no, he might still be in the job in
1992 _ when Spain and the United States will honor the 500th
anniversary of Christopher Columbus' voyage to the New World. That's
when this envoy could turn to a translator, or a phrase book, to
toast U.S.-Spanish relations.

   Burlington County Times, Willingboro, N.J., on cost of the U.S.
Capitol Police:
   The U.S. Capitol Police, whose sole mission is to protect House
and Senate members and their staffs, will cost almost $60 million
next year.
   One wasteful feature is that the House and Senate branches of the
police force are administratively separate, with different pay
scales. But efforts to unify the two forces have been frustrated by
a clash between the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms. Neither
wants to relinquish control over personnel.
   This is one problem Congress cannot blame on the White House, and
it naturally raises a question. If they cannot handle a management
challenge of the sort that every mayor or city council takes for
granted, why should we trust their judgmemt on harder issues?

   Philadelphia Daily News on baby boomers and the Rolling Stones:
   Rolling Stones Mick Jagger and Keith Richards probably have
gathered a bit of moss. And Jerry Garcia's Grateful Dead ought to be
_ grateful, that is.
   But they are the hottest tickets in the oddly nostalgic world of
rock and roll. When word got around about a return tour for The Who,
we asked: Where? When?
   Why?
   For the same reason sports fans step over today's leading golfers
to join Arnie's Army or to follow Jack Nicklaus, for the same reason
they stay away from the fights until Ray Leonard or Roberto Duran
laces up the gloves.
   Because the baby boomers, who outnumber any other living
generation, make the decisions about what's worth paying for.
   And those who used to distrust anybody over 30 now cast a
jaundiced eye toward anyone who doesn't have at least an occasional
use for liniment.

   The Sun, Bremerton, Wash., on the Soviet economy:
   In the latest of several developments that threaten perestroika,
the Moscow city government has decided to bar non-residents from
buying items such as clothing from the Soviet capital's stores, due
to scarcities.
   That is far more serious than it might seem. Relatively speaking,
Moscow has long been an oasis in the desert of Soviet consumer
goods. Every week, hundreds of thousands of shoppers from elsewhere
have flocked there in search of meat, refrigerators and other
merchandise they cannot find in their hometown stores.
   In effect, the Soviets are moving toward internal protectionism.
This protectionism mirrors a new trend among other Warsaw Pact
countries, which are making it harder for each other's tourists to
take scarce goods home. Czechoslovakia and East Germany, for
example, recently outlawed foreign purchases of food and toilet
paper; the Soviets responded with their own ban on exports of
refrigerators and caviar.
   Whatever its immediate advantages for particular groups, in the
long run such protectionism will inevitably make the Eastern bloc's
economic woes even worse. Thoughtful Soviets realize this: The
government newspaper Izvestia strongly denounced Moscow's new
shopping rules.
   Gorbachev's entire reform agenda is in danger unless he can turn
the economy around. The only way to do that is to move far more
boldly toward a free market, not further away.

   Bangor (Maine) Daily News on the Polish economy:
   ... Poland, ironically, is back where it was a half-century ago,
the object of bargaining between East and West. The new Poland
cannot survive on the meager financial aid package offered by
President George Bush; but the United States and Europe, which must
be ready to make a substantial infusion of funds into the Polish
economy, cannot do so now out of self-interest. It must be clear
that public opinion will acknowledge Solidarity as the victor if the
new Polish government slays its economic monster. The credit cannot
go to the discredited and politically bankrupt communists in the
coalition.
   Like their countrymen in the lines outside the bakeries, the
Polish people will have to wait. It is difficult to ask for further
patience from people who have suffered and sacrificed for three
generations. But this time there is genuine reason for hope and gain
in the crumbling of the Soviet empire.

   The Milwaukee Journal on Fawn Hall:
   If the student association at Marquette University wanted to
squander $3,500 to hear Fawn Hall last Thursday give her
unenlightened version of the Iran-Contra scandal, that's their
business. But we have to wonder why undergraduates whose fees
support the Associated Students organization didn't rise up in
protest. Or were they just momentarily blinded by Hall's star status?
   And why did the student group roll over and play dead to the
demand by Hall, herself a media creation, that the news media be
kept out of the event? The ban _ a part of Hall's standard contract
for all speaking engagements _ didn't work very well at Marquette
anyway. Print journalists got in easily and even a television
reporter managed to hurl a loaded question at the
secretary-turned-celebrity before he was thrown out. Cynics might
think that the press restrictions were part of a clever plot by
Hall's handlers to generate still more news coverage of her
appearances.
   The real marvel is that there was an audience for the woman who
typed, filed and shredded for Lt. Col. Oliver North, the convicted
Contragater. She shed absolutely no light on the arms-for-hostages
debacle. She offered her same tired defenses of North's illegal
actions. And she showed a continuing contempt for the role of
Congress in setting foreign policy.
   Clearly, Fawn Hall's audiences don't come to hear a reasoned
analysis of national security issues. They come because: (1) She is
blond, leggy and attractive; and (2) notoriety sells. When Hall's 15
minutes of fame have expired, what will she and her fans do for an
encore?

   The Justice Department today opened a criminal
investigation of allegations that law enforcement officers committed
civil rights violations while quelling a weekend riot at Virginia
Beach, Va.
   A department spokeswoman, Deborah Burstion-Wade, said the FBI had
received two complaints from civilians who were in Virginia Beach,
the scene of rioting among a crowd of 100,000 youths over the Labor
Day weekend.
   Police and National Guard troops used clubs to disperse the
crowds, which largely consisted of students from predominantly black
East Coast colleges.
   Burstion-Wade said the FBI and the department's civil rights
division had formally opened a criminal investigation into possible
deprivation of civil rights.
   The spokeswoman said she couldn't provide specific information
about the two complaints against law enforcement officers that were
filed today with the FBI.
   The Justice Department was continuing to review published
accounts and videotapes of police and National Guard troops clashing
with the rioters, she said.
   Virginia Beach's mayor said earlier that she welcomed a federal
investigation into how the city handled the disturbances.
   ``I have nothing to fear in this city being open to scrutiny,''
Mayor Meyera E. Oberndorf said Tuesday. ``We want the opportunity to
have our name cleared.''
   Other city officials joined the mayor in supporting the police.
   According to perliminary counts, 1,235 people were charged with
1,346 offenses. Most of the charges involved disorderly conduct,
traffic offenses and public drinking.
   The rioters early Sunday and Sunday night were mostly black
college students attending the annual end-of-summer Greekfest. At
least 43 people were injured, including 30 police officers or
National Guardsmen.
   ``These statistics do not even begin to tell the story. When
you're in the middle of a riot, you don't have time to make arrests.
Your main concern is to get the streets secured,'' said Police Chief
Charles R. Wall.
   ``These officers were exposed to an extreme situation,'' City
Manager Aubrey V. Watts Jr. said. ``It's incredible that they were
able to restore law and order without firing a single shot or using
fatal force.''
   Watts said a city team will evaluate the millions of dollars in
damage, much of it attributed to looting, caused by a crowd of about
100,000 young people who attended the annual event known as
Greekfest. He also said he will gather reports from police, fire and
emergency personnel.
   Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., said he has alerted the U.S. Small
Business Administration to be ready to process requests for disaster
aid from more than 100 businesses damaged.
   Merchants and innkeepers said they would meet to discuss how to
avoid similar problems at next year's Greekfest.
   ``You can't do a whole lot,'' said Rick Kowalewitch, owner of
RK's Windsurf Shop on 17th Street. ``No matter what we do we look
like a racist.''
   Many of the young people who were chased off the streets by
police were black, but Kowalewitch said he and other whites were
ordered around by police as well.
   Greekfest participants were divided about whether they would
return.
   Brad Williams, 23, of White Plains, N.Y., said he has enjoyed the
gathering for five years and will come back.
   Muriel Steptoe, 26, and Alicia Dailey, 25, of Springfield, Mass.,
said they would not return because of the disturbance this year.
   ``If anybody comes back next year I think it will be the ones who
want to make trouble,'' Ms. Steptoe said.

<HEAD>Women's Cholesterol Levels Change for the Worse After Menopause</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For release at 6 p.m. EDT</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women's blood cholesterol levels worsen abruptly
after menopause, and this may help explain their increasing risk of
heart attacks, according to a study.
   While heart disease is rare in women before menopause, their risk
increases tenfold after age 55.
   In a study published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, doctors watched changes in two main components of
cholesterol _ high density lipoprotein, or HDL, and low density
lipoprotein, or LDL _ as women underwent menopause. HDL protects
against heart disease, while LDL increases the risk.
   The researchers found that women's HDL levels dropped 4
milligrams per deciliter of blood when they went through menopause,
while their LDL rose 12 milligrams.
   The findings support the idea that ``menopause does lead to
increased risk of coronary artery disease in women because of the
negative changes in lipids,'' said Dr. Karen A. Matthews, a
researcher at the University of Pittsburgh who directed the study.
   When menopausal women took estrogen supplements, there was little
change in their blood cholesterol levels, the study found.
   Matthews said more research is needed before researchers
recommend routine use of estrogen to protect against heart disease.
Estrogen supplements after menopause have been linked with an
increase risk of some forms of cancer.
   ``As women enter the period when they are likely to undergo
menopause, which is around 50, it's an ideal time for them to have
their cholesterol levels regularly checked,'' Matthews said. ``If
they begin to experience declines in HDL or increases in LDL, it
would be very useful to alter dietary factors and exercise to have a
more health-promoting lifestyle.''
   The study began with 541 women ages 42 to 50 who had not
undergone menopause. Over the next 2{ years, 101 of them stopped
menstruating, and 32 of these women began taking estrogen
supplements.
   Their HDL and LDL levels were compared with those of women the
same age who had not reached menopause.

<HEAD>Man Convicted In Tax Scam Featuring Celebrity Voices</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man was convicted of cheating investors out
of $12.6 million in a tax-shelter scheme featuring audio tapes made
by baseball manager Tommy Lasorda, singer Pat Boone and actor
Vincent Price.
   Johnathan D'Orio, 41, of Akron, Ohio, was found guilty Tuesday in
federal court of tax fraud, mail fraud and conspiracy.
   D'Orio told investors that for $10,000 they could take part in a
program allowing them to take 10 percent of the tapes' value off
their taxable income, resulting in a write-off of at least $18,000,
said Assistant U.S. Attorney David Katz.
   About 1,150 investors were bilked out of $12.6 million and the
government was cheated out of $20 million in taxes, Katz said.
   Lasorda, Price and Boone testified they were paid $10,000 to
$15,000, plus $250 per tape, to make recordings. Lasorda, manager of

   Hurricane Gabrielle churned toward Bermuda and the
East Coast with winds of 135 mph today, raising 10-foot swells up to
1,300 miles away on North Carolina's Outer Banks.
   Gabrielle's 500-mile wide spiral bypassed the Caribbean and was
expected to reach Bermuda by Friday or Saturday. The island got
15-foot swells today.
   Already the Atlantic season's biggest hurricane, it was upgraded
Tuesday evening to a Category 4 hurricane, with 5 the strongest.
   An Air Force reconnaissance plane flew over Gabrielle late
Tuesday and reported rising barometric pressure and a slightly
expanding eye in the hurricane, signs that strengthening could be
unlikely, forecasters said.
   But early today, Gabrielle's pressure decreased slightly and its
eye constricted again.
   As of noon, Gabrielle was centered near 24 north latitude and 59
west longitude, 610 miles south-southeast of Bermuda. It was moving
north-northwest at 12 mph and was expected to take a more northerly
course in the next 24 hours.
   Early today, a buoy on the Outer Banks recorded 10-foot swells
from the distant hurricane, said hurricane specialist Jim Gross.
   While it was uncertain how close Gabrielle would come to Bermuda,
its considerable size prompted forecasters to advise residents of
the island and the East Coast to monitor it closely.
   Forecasters said the storm rivaled last year's record-setting
Hurricane Gilbert at the same stage but was on a path more like
1985's powerful Hurricane Gloria, which did $900 million in damage
as it raced up the East Coast.
   Gilbert's winds reached more than 155 mph and had the lowest
central pressure measured this century at 888 millibars. Central
pressure governs wind intensity. Gilbert was ranked Category 5.
Gabrielle's pressure increased from 942 millibars to 945 millibars
late Tuesday.
   While Gilbert stayed on a westerly course across the upper
Caribbean, devastating Jamaica and landing in Mexico, Gabrielle
dodged past the Caribbean and headed up into the Atlantic.
   Gloria roared up the Atlantic in the fall of 1985 at an unusually
fast 30 to 50 mph, panicking thousands of East Coast residents. But
its winds dropped from 150 mph to minimal hurricane strength by the
time it reached land.
   In Barbados, the easternmost Caribbean island 550 miles southeast
of Puerto Rico, Gabrielle's tail caused 10-foot waves and some
flooding in beachfront homes and businesses in the capital of
Bridgetown. No injuries or serious damage were reported.
   Far to the north, meanwhile, Hurricane Felix's winds were 85 mph.
   Little strengthening was expected for Felix, which posed no
threat to land. At noon, its center was near 37 north latitude and
48 west longitude, or 910 miles west of the Azores. It was drifting
to the north-northeast.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy and his
staff were evacuated today from Lebanon after hundreds of Christians
besieged the embassy in a protest to demand action against Syria.
   It was the first time Washington has pulled its ambassador out of
Lebanon, despite 14 years of civil war.
   The 30 diplomats left because ``deteriorating local circumstances
... no longer permitted the embassy to function effectively,'' said
Keith Peterson, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Nicosia.
   The sudden decision to pull out of Lebanon, where Christian
forces and Syrian troops have been battling for six months, came
after hundreds of angry Christians surrounded the embassy compound
Tuesday.
   The protesters at the embassy in the Beirut suburb of Aoukar
dispersed several hours after McCarthy's departure today. But they
said in a statement they would besiege the compound again if the
ambassador returns.
   The Christian army leader, Gen. Michel Aoun, said in a statement
released by his office: ``It seems the American Cain couldn't endure
the stare of the Lebanese Abel so he left.'' Aoun has repeatedly
criticized the United States for failing to help the Christians in
their battle with the Syrians.
   The withdrawal of American diplomats represents the latest
setback for U.S. policy in Lebanon. On April 18, 1983, a bomb at the
U.S. Embassy killed at least 49 people while the United States was
involved in talks to arrange a withdrawal of foreign forces from
Lebanon.
   On Oct. 23, 1983, suicide bombers rammed trucks packed with
explosives into Marine and French peacekeeper posts, killing 241
Americans and 58 French. In February 1984, the U.S. Marines force
was withdrawn from Lebanon.
   In addition, eight of 16 Western hostages held by pro-Iranian
extremists in Lebanon are American. The longest-held is Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   In today's embassy evacuation, the ambassador and 29 American
staff were flown by helicopter to a British sovereign base in Cyprus.
   Three hours later, they took off aboard a military aircraft for
Italy, informed sources said. The sources, who insisted on not being
identified further, said the DC-9 aircraft departed at noon (5 a.m.
EDT) from the Akrotiri base in southern Cyprus bound for a NATO
military base in Sigonella, Sicily.
   In Washington, however, State Department spokesman Mark Dillen
said the diplomats would travel to a U.S. base in West Germany later
today. Officials said they would then head back to the United States
in a day or two.
   Dillen added, ``The evacuation does not represent a diminution of
our intention to try to help Lebanon.'' He said the United States
would work with Arab states, European allies, the Soviet Union, and
countries of the region on achieving a cease-fire, an end to
blockades of Lebanese ports, and political reconciliation in Lebanon.
   The U.S. Embassy is in the country's Christian enclave, where
about 1 million Christians have been trapped for six months, ringed
by the hostile Syrians and their allies and angry that the West has
not come to their rescue.
   One source said the helicopters airlifted McCarthy and the
diplomats from the embassy compound _ not from any of the regular
Lebanese army air bases in the Christian heartland.
   A diplomatic source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the British Embassy in Beirut was informed of the decision to
evacuate the American embassy staff Tuesday night.
   The Foreign Office in London said its diplomats had no immediate
plans to follow suit. About 15 British Embassy staff are in Beirut.
   A Lebanese army spokesman, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the Americans had notified Aoun of their ``intention
to leave.''
   The Christians besieging the embassy compound were angry at the
United States for not coming to their aid against the Syrian army
and its Moslem allies since hostilities began March 8. Fighting
between the factions has since claimed the lives of 827 people and
wounded 2,452.
   The crowd went into a frenzy Tuesday, shouting ``McCarthy Go
Home'' and waving placards and posters denouncing America.
   Christian sources said the embassy siege was designed by Aoun to
whip up anti-American sentiment among Christians inside and outside
Lebanon, to bring pressure on the United States.
   The demonstrators had demanded that McCarthy submit his
credentials to ``the legitimate Lebanese authorities represented by
General Aoun'' and official U.S. recognition of Aoun's authority.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, is competing
for legitimacy with Aoun's three-member Christian Cabinet.
   McCarthy took up his post in September 1988 after the emergence
of the dual government and has not submitted his credentials to
either Cabinet. He has publicly criticized Syria for not responding
to a U.S. request to negotiate with Aoun, but Aoun has charged that
Washington is not pushing Syria hard enough.
   The Christian enclave has taken a fearful pounding from Syrian
artillery since March, when Aoun launched his self-proclaimed ``war
of liberation'' to force the Syrians to withdraw their 40,000 troops
in Lebanon.
   Even though his forces are outnumbered and outgunned, his
objective appeared to be to mobilize U.S. and European support for
the Christians.
   That startegy has failed. Washington has made sympathetic noises,
but has made it clear it has no intention of getting drawn into the
Lebanese quagmire again.

   A train carrying 120 passengers and
traveling nearly 90 mph rammed into a stationary freight train
northwest of Madrid on Wednesday, and at least five people were
killed and 54 injured, officials said.
   A spokesman for the Alava province civil governor, who asked not
to be identified, said the dead were the passenger train's engineer
and four women.
   The collision took place just after noon when the northbound
Madrid-Gijon express rammed into the freight train at the station in
Arevalo, about 70 miles northwest of Madrid.
   The crash left twisted wreckage of both trains spread across
several rail lines. The spokesman said six of the 54 injured were in
serious condition.
   Alberto Garcia Alvarez, the zone director of the state railway
company RENFE, said the passenger train entered the station on a
secondary rail line onto which the freight train also had been
guided to permit the passage of the passenger train.
   An unidentified passenger told Spanish National Radio, ``All of a
sudden there was a crash and it was like we were in a blender,
flying over the seats.''
   Garcia Alvarez told reporters the express train was not scheduled
to stop in Arevalo and was going about 86 mph when it crashed.
   Another RENFE spokesman, Charo Delgado, said the express train
carried 120 passengers.
   The accident was the deadliest in Spain since March 1988, when
eight people died and 25 people were injured in the crash of two
passenger trains in a station in Valladolid, 112 miles northwest of
Madrid.

   The most populous city in South
Africa was quiet on election day.
   As the morning sun burned off the coal-smoke haze covering
Soweto, the township of 2.5 million blacks substituted its usual
weekday bustle for a day of silent protest Wednesday.
   The huge taxi depot near Baragwanath Hospital, where thousands
catch minibus taxis into Johannesburg each day, was nearly empty. A
wind sent swirls of dust across a deserted parking lot that normally
overflows with commuters.
   ``I'm not going to work for political reasons,'' said Martin
Mika, a salesman for the South African Breweries.
   Mika joined hundreds of thousands of blacks in a general strike
Tuesday and Wednesday to protest the segregated parliamentary
elections that exclude the black majority.
   No formal protest rallies were planned, but Soweto schools,
frequently the site of militant protest, were closed, as were most
stores. The Sowetan newspaper, the country's largest black-oriented
daily, did not publish.
   Taxi driver Fred Sadike estimated that only 20 percent of the
taxis, the primary means of transportation for most urban blacks,
were operating Wednesday. Most were traveling only inside the
township, not going to Johannesburg, he said.
   Sadike said he believed the election promise made by Acting
President F.W. de Klerk, who pledged to bring blacks into the
national government on a limited basis within five years.
   ``I think we'll be able to vote someday, but I don't know when,''
said Sadike, 32. ``I'd like to vote for the ANC,'' he said,
referring to the African National Congress guerrilla group.
   Blacks, who account for 28 million of the country's 37 million
people, are allowed to vote only in municipal elections or in the 10
tribal territories. Soweto blacks routinely boycott the local polls,
saying the candidates are collaborators with the white-led
government.
   In mixed-race and Indian townships, where residents can vote for
segregated houses of Parliament, those boycotting the polls
outnumbered those who cast ballots.
   In the Indian township of Lenasia, activists burned an effigy of
de Klerk on Tuesday night. ``Don't Vote'' signs vied for space on
light poles with campaign posters.
   ``I voted because the candidate promised to help get me a
house,'' said an Indian grocery store owner in Lenasia, who refused
to give his name. ``But I don't think too many people care who wins,
because the Indians don't have any real power.''

   The state-owned liquor store chain said
Wednesday it removed all bottles of a popular gin and grapefruit
drink from its self-service stores after an extortion attempt by
someone who claimed to have put poison in bottles.
   Ilkka Kaski of the sales division of the Alko chain said tens of
thousands of Gin Long Drink bottles were taken off the shelves in
the 51 stores immediately after the threat Tuesday.
   An anonymous telephone caller claimed he had put poisoned bottles
on a shelf of a self-service store and would retrieve them in
exchange for an undisclosed sum of money.
   Alko holds a monopoly on liquor sales in Finland.
   ``This is the first time such a thing has happened in the history
of Alko. We took it very seriously indeed,'' Kaski told The
Associated Press.
   Gin Long Drink is one of Alko's best-selling items, with 60
million bottles sold last year.

   A Cuban airliner that crashed on takeoff and
killed 170 people was buffeted by powerful winds from a thunderstorm
just before it plunged into a Havana suburb, Cuban news reports said
today.
   Of 126 people aboard the chartered Cubana de Aviacion plane, only
one survived. The plane carried mostly Italians returning from
vacation.
   Forty-five people were killed on the ground in the suburb of
Boyeros, a half mile from the airport, according to the Cuban
official news agency Prensa Latina monitored in Mexico City. Earlier
reports said 25 died on the ground.
   Dozens of people were injured, many critically.
   The Soviet-made Ilyushin 62 crashed moments after takeoff from
Havana in a thunderstorm Sunday night, destroying two square blocks
of homes in Boyeros.
   In a preliminary report, a Cuban government commission said that
at the time of the disaster, there was ``an abrupt worsening of the
meteorological conditions, which produced strong upward and downward
wind currents at low altitudes near the end of the runway,'' Prensa
Latina said.
   It quoted Gen. Rogelio Acevedo, head of the commission and
president of Civil Aeronautics Institute, as saying the information
came from two flight data recorders recovered from the plane.
   Carlo Civiletti, the Italian ambassador to Cuba, said
investigators were trying to determine whether the crash was due to
windshear, reports in Rome said. It was not clear if the Cuban news
reports were talking about drafts that would be defined as windshear.
   Windshear develops beneath thunderstorms. Scientists say it is a
downward flow of air that hits the earth and fans out in all
directions. Such winds are known to have caused airliner crashes in
Dallas and New Orleans.
   However, Civiletti said in an interview published today in the
Rome newspaper Republica that Cuban authorities had said the cause
of the crash was due to both pilot error and poor weather.
   Cuban investigators expect to report their conclusions in 15 to
20 days.

   Peaceful Buddhist monks, angry workers
and violent radical students protested separately today, demanding
the ouster of President Roh Tae-woo for allegedly suppressing their
rights.
   Police fired tear gas to stop 5,000 workers in the port of Masan
from marching from an export industrial complex to the streets, news
reports said.
   Protesters accused the government of trying to suppress the labor
movement. They demanded investigations into attacks on union offices
in the industrial complex, according to Seoul's Chosun-Ilbo
newspaper. Masan is 200 miles south of the capital.
   In central Seoul, 1,500 gray-robed Buddhist monks gathered with
their supporters at Chogyesa Temple shouting, ``Down with the
government which suppresses Buddhism!'
   The monks issued a statement vowing ``to terminate the
authoritarian rule of Roh's government.''
   They were protesting the arrest of Lee Ji-kwan, president of
Seoul's Buddhist-run Dongguk University, for allegedly selling
college places. Lee was freed, but Buddhists claim the government
trumped up the charge.
   Students rallied in three cities today to demand the release of a
radical student jailed for traveling illegally to North Korea.
   ``Overthrow the Roh regime which suppresses the masses!'' an
organizer told the Seoul rally, which included students from more
than 30 schools.
   ``Realize unification through struggles against the United
States,'' said a student statement supporting unification with
communist North Korea. Radicals, a small but vocal minority, feel
the presence of 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea hinders
unification.
   In Pusan, 1,600 students from three colleges battled riot police
with firebombs and rocks to demand the ouster of the government and
the release of Im Su-kyong, a 20-year-old student who traveled
illegally to North Korea to attend a youth festival in July, the
official Yonhap news agency reported. Peaceful rallies were held at
three other Pusan schools, it said.
   In Suwon, just south of Seoul, 700 students from eight schools
clashed with riot police in an anti-government protest on a street
in front of Sunkyunkwan University, and eight students were
arrested, Yonhap said.
   The most violent scenes took place in the capital, where more
than 1,000 combat-clad riot police and four armored vehicles firing
tear gas stormed onto Seoul National University campus to break up a
rally of 3,000 students.
   ``Overthrow Roh Tae-woo!'' students screamed before they fled,
coughing and choking in tear gas so thick campus buildings could not
be seen. They regrouped, pelting police with hundreds of large rocks
and lunging at them with metal pipes. But the black-helmeted police
held the campus gates.
   Witnesses said two dozen cars in a campus parking lot were
smashed by rocks thrown by both sides. There were numerous injuries,
but no arrests were made.

   President Bush, embarking on a campaign to sell
his $7.9 billion drug program, today visited a public hospital to
view babies abandoned by addicted mothers and defended his plan
against ``carping'' from Democrats.
   ``My response is, they're wrong,'' Bush said of the Democrats'
complaints that the plan doesn't go far enough and is inadequately
funded.
   ``It's a good plan. If people would stop just criticizing for
partisan reasons and get behind the program, and then if there's
something additional we should do, then let's do it,'' he said.
   Despite Bush's opposition to higher taxes, Democrats said he will
have to resort to that. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of
the House Ways and Means Committee, said: ``Unless the president
supports the tax increases that will be necessary to fight this war,
the drug dealers are going to win.''
   At a news conference with journalists specializing in drug and
crime issues, the president argued that his program is $2 billion
more than the amount being considered by the House. ``They're
carping,'' he said of his critics, dismissing their objections as
``those partisan comments.''
   In particular, he singled out Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.,
chairman of the House select committee on narcotics, who emerged
from a White House briefing on drugs Tuesday and declared that Bush
would have to raise taxes. The president said ``he couldn't wait to
get out on the lawn of the White House and say, `Raise taxes.'''
   On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said,
``I don't think the history of this issue has been a partisan
issue.'' He noted that anti-drug bills passed with bipartisan
support in 1986 and 1988. But he quickly recalled ``the
administration frustrated earlier efforts'' by Democrats to
immediately increase anti-drug spending.
   Bush's program calls for tougher penalties on drug users and more
money for law enforcement, prisons, drug treatment and education.
   ``Nobody is criticizing the strategy, no one is coming at us and
saying, `You've left this out' or `Left that out' ... the country's
fed up,'' he said. ``They don't want it to be a Republican answer or
a Democratic answer or a liberal or a conservative answer.''
   ``I haven't heard any real substantive attack on the strategy
itself.''
   Bush was noncommittal when asked about the possibility of
establishing an international military strike force to combat drug
lords, as proposed by Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del. However, Bush said
there was ``a lot of interest'' in such an idea and noted that he
had made such a proposal himself during his presidential campaign
last year.
   Bush also said he was open-minded about the possibility of
sending American troops to Colombia, if asked, to help battle the
country's drug barons. However, he said Colombian President Virgilio
Barco has made clear he doesn't want American troops, and that the
deployment of U.S. forces might anger the population there.
   On the other hand, Bush said, if troops were requested, ``We'd
take a very different look at this.''
   The president met with reporters after paying a visit to D.C.
General Hospital, where he stopped by a ward of babies abandoned by
their crack and cocaine-using mothers.
   The president, wearing a blue smock, quieted one 4{-month-old
baby boy by cradling him against his shoulder. The infant, one of 13
boarder babies at the hospital, beamed at Bush and his health
secretary, Dr. Louis Sullivan.
   In his first prime-time speech to the nation Tuesday night, Bush
held up a bag of crack cocaine seized across the street from the
White House and declared drugs the ``gravest domestic threat facing
our nation.''
   But he said, ``We can pay for this fight ... without raising
taxes or adding to the budget deficit,'' instead diverting money
from other federal programs.
   Bush, during his hospital tour, said, ``This isn't any time for
partisanship. We've got a good program ... we've got lots to learn,
all of us, but let's try this.''
   Asked if he would take full responsibility for the drug war, Bush
replied, ``I'll take all the responsibility in the world. You see
these kids and you want to try harder.''
   Twenty percent of the 2,000 babies born at the big municipal
hospital here show signs of drug use by their pregnant mothers. Most
of the boarder babies were abandoned by drug-addicted mothers
shortly after birth. Hospital staff said they may stay as long as
nine months awaiting a foster home, even though they no longer
require hospital care.
   Biden, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said on ABC's
``Good Morning America'' that Bush's battle plan ``is a very, very
positive start. He's going to get everything he asked for.''
   But, Biden said, ``The question is whether or not we're going to
take it a step further and really take hold of the problem or we're
just going to try to do ... only what the president is suggesting.''
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations narcotics subcommittee, was more critical, saying on ``CBS
This Morning'' that ``there simply isn't the kind of bold, overall,
sweeping initiative to win the war on drugs.''
   ``The proposal's overwhelming reliance on the criminal justice
system, its underfunding of treatment and prevention programs and
its utter disregard for the ever-worsening conditions in our
nation's inner cities dooms it to certain failure,'' the American
Civil Liberties Union said of Bush's anti-drug strategy.
   Bush called for expanded treatment and education programs, but he
also urged the country to demonstrate ``zero tolerance for casual
drug use'' and repeated his support for harsh penalties on users as
well as dealers.
   Still, it would be left to the states to carry out most of Bush's
recommendations targeting casual drug users, such as stiffer fines,
auto seizures, drivers' license suspensions and publication of
offenders' names in newspapers.
   The president said it ``promises to be a very difficult fight''
that will require ``an assault on every front,'' at home as well as
abroad.
   ``The war on drugs will be hard-won, neighborhood by
neighborhood, block by block, child by child,'' he said.
   Key elements of Bush's plan:
   _Authorization of $1.6 billion for corrections, a 118 percent
increase over 1989, to help expand the federal prison system by 77
percent.
   _Doubling the number of drug treatment slots to about 700,000
nationwide with the help of $925 million, a 53 percent increase.
   _Authorization for $1.2 billion for prevention and education, a
25 percent increase; $250 million to beef up the court system, a 20
percent increase; and $3.1 billion for law enforcement, a 12 percent
increase.
   _A more than two-fold funding increase for local law enforcement
efforts, from $150 million to $350 million, to finance a
street-level attack on drugs. Some of the money could be used to
develop plans for new jails and prisons.
   _A requirement that states impose drug tests on arrestees,
prisoners, parolees and those out on bail. States that did not
comply could lose criminal justice grants.
   _Similar threats to cut federal funding for schools, colleges and
universities that do not adopt drug prevention programs.
   _A call for insurance companies to cover drug treatment that
stopped short of proposing mandatory standards.
   Bush also promised stronger efforts to attack drugs at their
source, in South America and elsewhere.
   ``When requested, we will for the first time make available the
appropriate resources of America's armed forces'' to nations
fighting drug production, he said.

   Extra police patrols of drug-infested
neighborhoods in the District of Columbia have been suspended
indefinitely out of concern that officers are being overworked,
police officials said Wednesday.
   Police Chief Isaac Fulwood told police officers earlier this week
the overtime patrols would be stopped because of the physical and
mental toll the program is taking on the department's street patrol
officers.
   The announcement came the day after President Bush, in his
nationally televised address, cited drug-selling that has reached
the park across the street from the White House in detailing his
$7.9 billion anti-drug strategy.
   The extra foot patrols begun during the summer were a response to
the city's record murder rate believed to be fueled by drugs.
   ``It's a burnout factor that the chief had to take into account
for the wellbeing of his men,'' said police spokesman Sgt. Joe
Gentile. ``Right now, we don't have any idea if or when it will be
reinstated.''
   The city hopes to hire 700 more police officers with $127 million
in federal money, but approval is still tied up in Congress.
   Gentine said the extra patrols have been particularly taxing
because they followed almost three years of other extra-duty
programs.
   ``First you had Operation Clean Sweep (an anti-drug program begun
in 1987), and more recently there was the redeployment of officers
to bad neighborhoods and the six-day work week,'' Gentile said.
``There was a cumulative effect, especially since so many guys had
to make extra court appearances.''
   All of those programs, especially the mandatory six-day work week
and Operation Clean Sweep, relied heavily on overtime.
   In the recent plan, officers worked extra four-hour shifts three
days a week for the past month. Before that, officers volunteered to
work overtime on their days off or following their regular shifts.
   Fulwood has submitted a plan to Mayor Marion Barry to require all
officers to work 60 hours per week. Barry has not acted on the idea,
which police officials estimate will cost about $1 million per week
in overtime.

<HEAD>Police: Woman Who Says She Killed, Buried Baby Was `Pleading for
Help'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Marion F. Allen's agonizing secret stayed
buried for 37 years.
   Finally, when she began expecting to hear voices from a corner of
her back yard, she called police and convinced a skeptical detective
with 44 years on the job that there indeed was a baby buried there.
   Capt. Albert Prezio has seen and heard many strange things, he
said _ among them, people who claimed to have heard voices behind
their walls or in their water pipes. Allen, 68, claimed she had
killed her baby and buried it between the garage and the back-alley
fence soon after giving birth to the illegitimate child in 1952.
   And this particular woman had been under psychiatric care for
several years, family members told police. But there was something
about Allen that made Prezio listen.
   ``She was pleading for help,'' Prezio said. ``She was so sincere
we took the chance she was telling the truth.''
   After failing to reach any of her doctors Saturday to confirm
whether or not Allen's claims were a recurring hallucination, Prezio
decided to dig.
   Police unearthed a metal box containing the skeletal remains of a
baby. The body had been wrapped in plastic similar to the sheets dry
cleaners use to protect clothing, and the box was wrapped in more
plastic material, guaranteeing no odor would attract neighbors or
dogs.
   But the presence of the body just 40 feet from her back door
preyed on the woman's mind, Prezio said. Through 37 years she told
no one of the birth and then allegedly smothering the baby and
placing the body in a container the size of a fishing tackle box.
   The baby, Allen told police, was the result of an extramarital
affair with a man who died seven or eight years ago, Prezio said.
Police did not release the man's name.
   An autopsy performed Tuesday provided authorities with no
conclusive evidence of the baby's sex or how it died. Allen said it
was a boy, Prezio said.
   Allen, charged with second-degree murder, was ordered to undergo
a psychiatric evaluation and faces a court hearing Thursday.
   Allen kept her pregnancy from her husband, George, and son,
George Jr., Prezio said, by wearing baggy clothing. She gave up
sunbathing, a favorite pastime, to keep her secret.
   ``Her husband is totally clear,'' Prezio said. ``We believe his
story that he was completely ignorant. He said he never noticed any
change in his wife's physical appearance. Neither could their son. I
believe both of them.''
   The Allens' quiet, tree-lined neighborhood, a section of north
Troy called Lansingburgh, is made up of one- and two-story
single-family houses. It's a working-class neighborhood in a
blue-collar city where most of the Allens' neighbors, like the
Allens, aren't talking to reporters.
   Prezio speculates that Allen confessed because of ``what she
faced by just looking out her dining area window.''
   ``She said she expected to hear voices from that corner,'' Prezio
said. ``She worked herself into serious mental problems.''
   Police dug several holes without finding anything before Allen
asked Prezio if she could come out and show them the exact spot.
   ``She wasn't four inches off,'' Prezio said.

<HEAD>15 Soviet Fishermen Killed After Tanker Rams Boat</HEAD>

   An oil tanker trying to avoid a crash
with a Soviet fishing trawler Wednesday veered into another Soviet
boat, which sank in the chilly Baltic and killed all 15 crewmen,
officials said.
   One of the Soviet fishermen was pulled from the sea alive after
the accident but died as he was being flown to a hospital. The coast
guard and navy gave up the search for the other 14 crewmen eight
hours after the accident, saying there was no hope of finding
survivors in the 55-degree water.
   Coast Guard Cmdr. Topi Jarainen called it the worst maritime
accident in the Baltic since World War II.
   The 6,000-ton Finnish oil tanker Tebo Star, en route to Amsterdam
with a cargo of crude oil, crunched into the trawler Ladushkin just
after midnight in fair weather and moderate seas.
   Veikko Hintsonen, of the Suomen Petrooli shipping company, which
operated the tanker, said in Helsinki that the ship veered to avoid
a collision with another Soviet trawler when it hit the Ladushkin.
The Tebo Star was not seriously damaged, he said.
   The 75-foot-long trawler sank within minutes, said Waldemar
Berlin, head of the coast guard rescue operation. ``I've worked here
for 30 years and I can't recall a more serious accident,'' he said.
   Berlin said most of the Soviet crewmen probably were in their
bunks asleep when the tanker hit their ship, 28 miles southwest of
the Swedish island of Gotland.
   The Swedish navy pulled three helicopters and four vessels from
war games being held nearby to help in the rescue effort.
   The Ladushkin was resting on the seabed 50 yards below the
surface, Berlin said.
   Jarainen said accidents involving trawlers and tankers are rare,
but fishermen on Gotland island said passing tankers sometimes do
not pay enough attention at night when trawlers are at anchor.
   ``Tankers cut down on their crew to make their trips more
profitable,'' fisherman Ulf Norrby told national radio. ``Then some
don't keep sufficient watch at night.''

   The American Civil Liberties Union called the
Bush administration's anti-drug strategy ``counterproductive and
cynical'' Wednesday, saying it short-changes prevention and
treatment programs while putting ``overwhelming reliance on the
criminal justice system.''
   Ira Glasser, executive director of the 275,000-member
organization, told a news conference that the war on drugs outlined
by President Bush in his nationally televised speech Tuesday night
amounts to ``a full-fledged political hoax.''
   ``This is a joke,'' Glasser said. ``It is a hoax on the public.
It cannot work.''
   In a statement released at the news conference, the ACLU said
``drug czar William Bennett's long-awaited proposal for the Bush
administration's `war on drugs' is not simply unworkable; it is
counterproductive and cynical.''
   It said the administration's plan ``will do little to lessen the
problems caused by drug use while compromising civil liberties,
overcrowding prisons and costing the taxpayers millions of dollars.''
   ``The proposal's overwhelming reliance on the criminal justice
system, its underfunding of treatment and prevention programs and
its utter disregard for the ever-worsening conditions in our
nation's inner cities dooms it to certain failure,'' the statement
said.
   Also criticizing the administration's anti-drug strategy were
several other groups including the National Association of Criminal
Defense Lawyers, the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation and the
National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, known as
NORML.
   In its statement, the ACLU asserted that ``Bennett's proposal is
little more than another attempt to fool the public into believing
that prohibition can work, when all the evidence shows that it
cannot.''
   The New York-based civil liberties group assailed elements of the
administration's plan including more drug testing of workers, more
penalties for first-time and occasional users and more pre-trial
forfeiture of vehicles and other assets.
   ``None of these measures will have a significant impact on the
country's drug problem; all of them represent attacks on basic
American values like the presumption of innocence, the right to be
free from unreasonable searches and seizures, and the right to due
process of the law,'' it said.
   Neal R. Sonnett, president of the National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers, said the administration's plan ``shows no
leadership, and dooms us to repeat the failures of the past.''
   ``Instead of ensnaring more people into our already overburdened
criminal justice system and bursting jails, we need to find better
ways to divert first-time and non-violent, minor offenders into
treatment, rehabilitation and education programs,'' Sonnett said.
   Eric E. Sterling, president of the Criminal Justice Policy
Foundation, another Washington-based group, spoke out in favoring of
legalizing drugs.
   ``Congress can destroy the Colombian cartel through legalization
by changing the drug laws, but there is one law Congress can never
repeal _ the law of supply and demand,'' Sterling said.
   Donald Fiedler, national director of NORML, contended that the
administration's program amounts to ``declaring war on at least 25
million fellow citizens who are leading productive lives but for
their casual or regular use of marijuana.''

<HEAD>Most Would Pay More Under Plan to Rework Law</HEAD>

   Nearly 60 percent of elderly Americans would
pay more for Medicare's catastrophic illness coverage under a
congressional proposal to rework the program, according to a private
study released Wednesday.
   Those hardest hit by the House Ways and Means Committee plan
would be elderly people just above the poverty line and in the lower
middle class, according to Families United for Senior Action, an
advocacy group for the elderly poor.
   Many affluent senior citizens, meanwhile, would see their
payments decrease if the proposal became law, Families USA said.
   ``The most vulnerable older people in America ... will make up
more than half of the losers in the proposed change,'' said Ronald
Pollack, executive director of the group. ``Congress should be
protecting these people from rising medical costs, not hitting them
with new charges.''
   Losers would outnumber winners in all the states, but states with
lower income levels would tend to be hit hardest, Pollack said. In
West Virginia, for example, 61 percent of senior couples and
individuals would pay more while 16.2 percent would pay less.
   Overall, 57.5 percent of the nation's elderly individuals or
couples would pay more and 25.4 percent would pay less, Families USA
said. The rest would be unaffected by the change.
   The year-old catastrophic covrage program limits how much
Medicare beneficiaries must pay for hospital care, physician
services, medical supplies and certain outpatient drugs. It also
increases coverage for home health care, skilled nursing facilities
and hospice care and adds breast-cancer screening and respite care
benefits.
   Congress has been considering a variety of proposals to repeal or
revise the program in order to appease senior citizens angered at
their costs for the coverage. Critics of the proposed Ways and Means
revision say it would placate well-off _ and vocal _ complainers at
the expense of poor people who most need low-cost coverage.
   A Ways and Means Committee spokesman who asked not to be named
said the committee's proposal was the best plan that legislators
could agree upon to avoid outright repeal.
   Thirty-eight percent of those whose costs would increase under
the Ways and Means plan have incomes of 90 percent to 149 percent of
federal poverty guidelines, while 79 percent of those whose costs
would fall have income at 300 percent of the poverty line or above,
according to the Families USA report, researched by Lewin@ICF, a
division of Health and Sciences Research Inc.
   Seniors citizens with incomes at or below 90 percent of the
poverty guideline in 1990 and at 100 percent in 1992 are eligible to
have Medicaid pay their Medicare premiums and deductibles.
   Families USA said that despite senior protests, ``the best way to
protect these seniors is to retain current law.'' Should Congress
insist on revising the plan, at a minimum it should extend the
Medicaid coverage of Medicare costs to people at up to 100 percent
of the poverty guidelines in 1990 and 150 percent by 1992, it said.
   Under the current Medicare program, a 15 percent surtax is
imposed on federal income tax liabilities over $150, affecting about
40 of percent of those 65 and older, with the surtax rising to 28
percent by 1993. The maximum surtax payment, expected at affect
about 5 percent of the elderly, is capped at $800 in 1989 and rises
to $1,050 in 1993.
   The rest of the money comes from a flat supplemental premium,
levied on all but the poorest beneficiaries, set at $4.90 a month in
1990.
   Under the Ways and Means plan, the surtax rate would be cut in
half and the flat monthly premium would rise to $8.40 in 1990. In
addition, the plan would increase from $600 to $800 in 1991 the
amount that beneficiaries must pay for prescription drugs before
qualifying for drug benefits.

   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said today it is
unrealistic to expect a tax increase to pay for President Bush's
anti-drug package unless Bush supports one.
   ``Without the administration's support, the idea of raising taxes
is futile,'' the Washington Democrat told reporters.
   Bush has said consistently that no tax increase is needed to fund
his drug war, and that money should be diverted from other federal
programs to pay for it.
   But Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, said ``unless the president supports the tax
increases that will be necessary to fight this war, the drug dealers
are going to win.''
   Most Democrats were quick to praise the program's aims, announced
by the president in a nationally televised speech Tuesday night,
including tougher penalties for users, stepped-up interdiction and
more money for prisons, treatment programs, education and prevention.
   But many questioned the administration's plan to help pay the
bill by squeezing $716 million from existing programs, a subject
likely to come up Thursday when national drug coordinator William
Bennett defends the outline before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Foley predicted that Congress would approve spending ``at least
the amount the president recommended'' this year, and said, ``next
year, I expect we will be offering more than the president's
proposal.''
   ``I'm not going to outline it in detail,'' he said when asked
what programs could be cut to find the money. ``Trust us.''
   Foley said Tuesday following a White House briefing for
congressional leaders that ``it's very difficult to assume we can,
at leat over the long term, meet the cost of the drug war without
some additional revenue coming into the government.''
   ``This is a war on drugs, not a war on the American taxpayer,''
countered Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   Administration budget director Richard Darman said money can be
diverted from programs such as juvenile justice, economic
development and immigration reform to help pay for the $7.9 billion
drug plan Bush outlined Tuesday night.
   But Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said Bush should look
elsewhere for the money.
   ``He is suggesting that we do it out of funds the Congress isn't
going to cut,'' DeConcini said.
   The plan calls for cutting $320 million from grants to help
states pay for immigration legalization services, $194 million from
the Economic Development Administration, $40 million from juvenile
justice programs, $15 million to reclaim lost postal revenue, $50
million from public housing subsidies and $132 million from a
Defense Department radio project.
   Former President Reagan repeatedly tried to scrap the EDA, but
Congress always refused.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the tax-writing House
Ways and Means Committee, said that ``unless the president supports
the tax increases that will be necessary to fight this war, the drug
dealers are going to win.''
   ``As despicable as drug dealers are, they understand economics,''
Rostenkowski said. ``If you want to play, you've got to pay.''
   But House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., emerged from
a White House briefing to say that offsetting cuts should get the
program through its first year.
   ``And then after that we're going to have to take a look at it, a
continuing look, because it's not going to be won in one year, and
it'll be a costly venture,'' Michel said.
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., said in
the formal Democratic response to the president's remarks that the
plan needed more police, prosecutors, judges and prisons.
   ``Quite frankly, the president's plan is not tough enough, bold
enough or imaginative enough to meet the crisis at hand,'' Biden
said.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., however, accused the president of
going overboard.
   ``If the Bennett-Bush plan's promise to punish drug users were
carried through, America would become a police state,'' said the
former FBI agent and chairman of the House subcommittee on civil and
constitutional rights.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., expressed ``strong support'' for ``a
comprehensive plan and challenge to the nation.''
   ``An overwhelming majority of Americans are prepared to reject
totally the use of narcotics and to help relieve the suffering of
those previously addicted,'' Lugar said.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., predicted that ``there'll be some
differences about where the money comes from, but we can get the
money.''

   A federal judge today ruled Jim Bakker
competent to stand trial after a psychiatrist testified the TV
evangelist was not mentally ill but merely had a panic attack when
he finally grasped his downfall.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter said Bakker's trial on charges
of fleecing followers of his PTL ministry would resume later in the
day.
   The ruling came after a hearing for which Bakker was brought to
court from a prison psychiatric unit in leg irons and handcuffs. He
was committed for a psychiatric evaluation there on Thursday after
his personal psychiatrist reported he was hallucinating and cowering
under a couch.
   During the hearing, Dr. Sally Johnson, a psychiatrist at the
Federal Correctional Institution at Butner, testified Bakker was
competent to stand trial and ``has the capacity to get through it.''
   She said Bakker suffered a panic attack last week after a witness
collapsed during defense cross examination.
   ``For the first time in three years, the whole situation came
home to him and he began to cry,'' she testified. ``The weight of
all these things began to coalesce and he began crying. It was a
powerful emotional reaction and release.''
   Potter asked Bakker to stand and answer questions before he
released him from the custody of U.S. marshals.
   ``Do you understand what you are on trial here for?'' the judge
asked.
   ``Yes sir,'' Bakker responded quietly.
   Asked if he was able to assist his lawyers, Bakker said, ``I'm
very tired, but I believe I can.''
   His wife, Tammy, said as she left court, ``This should not be
allowed in the United States of America.''
   Potter did not immediately rule on a defense request for a
mistrial but said he expected the trial to resume at 2 p.m.
   Bakker, who resigned from the PTL ministry in 1987 in a sex and
money scandal, went on trial Aug. 28 on conspiracy and fraud
charges. Prosecutors said he used nearly $4 million in ministry
funds to live in high style.
   He could could receive 120 years in prison and more than $5
million in fines if convicted.
   Bakker showed little emotion during the hearing, which was
attended by his wife and other family members.
   Mrs. Bakker arrived with defense attorney George T. Savis shortly
after her husband this morning and brought him a suit, shirt, tie
and shoes. He was wearing gray pants and a sport shirt as he entered
the building.
   Defense attorney Harold Bender filed the mistrial request
Tuesday, maintaining the jury might blame the defense for the
collapse of government witness Steve Nelson last week during
grilling by Bakker's lawyers.
   Nelson swooned after testifying he warned Bakker ``someone could
go to jail'' over the ministry's fund-raising practices. Bakker
knelt and prayed at Nelson's side. Nelson came to within seconds and
said he was laid low by the flu.
   Johnson said she didn't detect any signs of mental disease.
``It's not abnormal for someone to be experiencing those symptoms in
a trial situation, especially if it comes on the heels of a major
disruption in a person's life,'' she said.
   She described Bakker's symptoms as ``moderate depression'' and
``situational anxiety'' and detected ``dependent features in his
personality'' and narcissism. She said Bakker was coherent and
cooperative during his evaluation.
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Bakker said her husband was not mentally ill.
``After 2{ years of sheer mental torture, he was just stressed
out,'' a sobbing Mrs. Bakker said on a broadcast of their ``The Jim
and Tammy Show.''
   When U.S. marshals took him away to the prison hospital at
Butner, Bakker was ``so out of it'' he thought he was being taken to
an animal hospital named Butler, Mrs. Bakker said.

   President Bush on Wednesday announced the
nomination of Evan J. Kemp Jr. to be chairman of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.
   Kemp, 52, a Washington lawyer who is already a member of the
commission, would replace Clarence Thomas, nominated by Bush to be a
U.S. Circuit Court judge for the District of Columbia.
   Kemp is a former executive director of the Disability Rights
Center.
   In other appointments, Bush announced he would nominate Jennifer
Joy Wilson to be assistant secretary of Commerce for oceans and
atmosphere.
   Mrs. Wilson, 36, is currently assistant administrator for
external affairs at the Environmental Protection Agency. She worked
in the White House communications office in 1976-77 and was a
campaign aide to former President Ford in 1976.
   The White House also announced Bush will retain T.S. Ary as
director of the Bureau of Mines. Ary, 64, has held the post since
last year. Before that, he was president of the exploration division
of Kerr-McGee Minerals.

   A fire in a squatters' settlement
destroyed more than 550 homes, and six people trying to flee the
flames in a boat drowned when the boat sank, police said Wednesday.
   The fire broke out Tuesday night in a settlement built over the
sea near Tawau, 730 miles east of Kuala Lumpur.
   Tawau Police Chief Chester Chong said 2,930 people were left
homeless and that 558 of the settlements' 1,818 houses were
destroyed. He said the casualty toll was expected to rise.
   Chong told the national news agency Bernama that the dead were a
50-year-old woman and five children whose boat sank as they fled the
fire.
   The cause of the fire was not known.

<HEAD>Film Directors on Hunger Strike to Protest Colleagues' Arrest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 20 South Korean movie directors
stopped filming Wednesday and began a hunger strike to protest the
arrest of two colleagues who allegedly released snakes into theaters
showing American films.
   In a statement, the directors demanded the release of the two
arrested men and a halt to distribution of American films in South
Korea by the Hollywood-based Universal International Pictures.
   The campaign against UIP began in September, three years after
South Korean authorities ended the monopolized distribution of
American films by Korean middlemen.
   The Korean movie industry received subsidies from the middlemen
and film workers contend their monopoly should have been allowed to
continue.
   Throwing snakes and liquid ammonia into theaters showing American
films became a common form of protest.
   On Monday, two directors were arrested for allegedly hiring a
snake dealer to release non-poisonous snakes into theaters showing
UIP films last year.
   Meanwhile, police said Yoo Dong-hun, one of two film workers
wanted by police for alleged sabotage attempts on UIP films, turned
himself in Wednesday for questioning.
   Yoo, chairman of the Korean Film Workers Association, had been
wanted since Seoul's Cine House was burned Aug. 13 in a fire
triggered by firebombs and tear gas was scattered at three other
theaters showing UIP films.

   Two thieves walked into a department store
during business hours, hammered their way through a display case and
stole about $600,000 in diamonds and other jewelry, police said.
   The men entered Foley's in downtown San Antonio on Tuesday, said
Detective Joe Oosterveen.
   ``One went in and walked around, and the other came around
carrying a bag like a doctor's bag,'' Oosterveen said. One man
pulled out a sledgehammer, he said.
   ``One of the employees said, `Hey, stop what you are doing,' and
he said, `Just step back,' '' the detective said.
   While one man acted as lookout, the other pounded a display case
with the sledgehammer. Employees told police the thieves had to hit
the thick glass several times to break it.
   Among the items taken was a $54,000 bracelet. The men put the
jewelry in a bag and left in a waiting car, police said.

<HEAD>Spraying Against Medfly to Begin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State agriculture officials
announced today they will begin immediate spraying to protect
California's $14 billion produce industry from an infestation of the
voracious Mediterranean fruit fly.
   The decision required a declaration of an emergency by Gov.
George Deukmejian, who signed the order today after 16 Medflies were
found in the Mountain View area since last week, said Gera Curry,
Food and Agriculture Department spokeswoman.
   The spraying of the pesticide malathion take place in northern
California's Santa Clara County.
   Ground spraying was to begin about noon, and an aerial spraying
will be done on Friday if the weather is clear, the department said.
   Beginning Sept. 18, the state will also release 30 million
sterile Medflies a week until biologists decide the infestation is
destroyed.
   Medflies lay eggs in 250 varieties of fruits and vegetables _
including all citrus fruits, apples, cherries, avocados and tomatoes
_ and are capable of devastating California's $14 billion annual
agricultural industry.
   When Medfly eggs hatch, the larvae feed on the fruit, which spoil
and fall to the ground.
   Immediate ground and aerial spraying of malathion was recommended
Tuesday by a group of international experts in pest eradication.
   The advisory group, which discussed the infestation during a
conference call from such locations as Guatemala, Hawaii and
Florida, said other options available involve quarantine or
treatment only of the affected plants.
   Under state law, aerial spraying of malathion requires at least
24-hour notice to each home in the area. A state study in 1987 found
no damage to people's health as a result of large-scale spraying in
the early 1980s.
   About 300 members of the California Conservation Corps were
distributing leaflets today to about 100,000 homes in the area, The
leaflets described time and place of spraying, possible health
hazards and steps to protect vehicles.
   A 1980-81 Medfly infestation in Santa Clara County caused a
bitter debate over the use of chemical sprays. Helicopter spraying
of malathion over eight San Francisco-region counties eventually
wiped out the pests.
   An infestation in the Los Angeles area last year cost $2 million
to eradicate by way of malathion spraying and the release of 700
million sterile flies. Another infestation in 1980-82 cost $100
million.
   In the early 1980s, the state spent more than $100 million to
eradicate the pest in parts of central California and Los Angeles.

   Fire caused $3,000 to $5,000 in damage to a

said.
   The Navy did not release information on the accident until crew
members contacted a Jacksonville newspaper.

   Students and workers clashed with
police in five towns Wednesday during demonstrations demanding the
resignation of President Roh Tae-woo and the withdrawal of U.S.
troops from South Korea.
   Police fired tear gas to break up the rallies in Masan, Seoul,
Pusan, Suwon and Taegu. Witnesses reported some arrests and injuries
but police had no figures.
   In the southern industrial city of Masan, 205 miles south of
Seoul, 5,000 workers fought police for hours, demanding the
government investigate violence against union leaders.
   Police and protesters clashed severral times after a scheduled
march by the demonstrators through downtown arreas was blocked.
``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Stop suppressing labor movement!''
the protesters shouted.
   In Seoul, more than 1,000 combat-clad riot police and four
armored vehicles firing tear gas stormed the sprawling campus of
Seoul National University to break up an anti-government rally.
   Students shouted ``Overthrow Roh Tae-woo!'' and hurled stones at
the police befoe being beaten back. Witnesses said some students
attacked police with clubs and metal pipes.
   There were many injuries but no arrests were reported.
   In Pusan, the nation's second-largest city, about 1,600 students
battled riot police with firebombs and rocks during rallies
demanding the release of a radical student arrested for making an
illegal trip to communist North Korea in defiance of a government
ban.
   Hundreds of radical students in Taegu and Suwon also clashed with
riot police after anti-government campus rallies in support of
workers, farmers and unionized teachers punished or reprimanded by
authorities.
   The demonstrations had strong anti-U.S. overtones. Many students
shouted slogans demanding the withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troops
stationed here under a mutual defense treaty. They claimed the U.S.
military presence hinders prospects of unification with North Korea,
a key demand by radicals.
   Radicals are a small but vocal minority in South Korea and have
little public support because of their extreme actions and views.
Officials estimate they number about 20,000 in a nation of 42
million.
   Also in the capital Wednesday, farmers opposed to U.S. food
imports protested for a second day outside a downtown hotel that is
the site of an American food fair. Several hundred police were
deployed to prevent violence. No clashes were reported.
   The farmers displayed placards and distributing leaflets
demanding a halt to American food imports.
   ``Farmers are losing their zest for life as prices of domestic
farm products plunge and debts of farming households snowball,'' one
appeal said. ``Let us block foreign pressure for the opening of
imports of farm products.''
   The two-day fair began Wednesday and is the first major American
food promotion staged in South Korea. It represents 57 food products
and organizations from 15 states.
   South Korean farmers have staged violent demonstrations demanding
the Seoul government halt imports of U.S. agricultural products,
which they say will dominate the domestic market and threaten their
livelihood.
   ``We have no problem at all with people demonstrating for what
they believe in,'' George Pope, agricultural counselor at the U.S.
Embassy, told a news conference. ``We realize the extreme
sensitivity of Korean liberalization (of food) to Korea and the
Korean farmers.''
   Under pressure from Washington, the Seoul government this year
agreed to relax controls on the import of 243 agricultural, marine
and forestry products, a move that angered Korean farmers.
   The United States imported $100 million worth of agricultural
products from South Korea in 1988, Pope said. Food exports to South
Korea were $2.3 billion, he said.

<HEAD>Poindexter Lawyers Say Reagan Authorized Letters to Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan authorized John Poindexter to
send letters to Congress on which part of the indictment against the
former national security adviser is based, Poindexter's lawyers said
today.
   Frederick Robinson, Poindexter's lawyer, told a hearing in
federal court that the former president's notes on various meetings
with his national security adviser should be produced for Poindexter
as part of his defense.
   Poindexter is charged in the Iran-Contra scandal with conspiracy,
two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of making false
statements.
   Robinson depicted Reagan as having approved administration
responses to Congress about the Nicaraguan Contras. The indictment
against Poindexter depends in part on those responses.
   Poindexter ``went to the president to talk about'' sending
letters responding to congressional inquiries, said Robinson.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene asked whether he was
suggesting that ``the president said, `You go ahead and do this'.''
   ``Yes,'' responded Robinson.
   The president was saying, ``I want these things done,'' Robinson
said.
   ``I think that the president's notes ... we believe will show ...
discussions about the letters that were sent to Congress and the
appropriateness of any response,'' said Robinson.
   The congressional inquiries to which the Reagan White House was
responding focused on whether the administration was assisting the
Nicaraguan Contras in violation of a congressional ban on military
aid to the rebel force.
   Two of Poindexter's responses referred to year-old answers his
predecessor, Robert McFarlane, sent to Congress denying that the
National Security Council staff was supplying military advice or
raising funds for the Nicaraguan rebels. McFarlane subsequently
pleaded guilty to withholding information from Congress in
connection with his letters.
   One of the charges against Poindexter is that he obstructed
Congress in July and August 1986 by sending the letters. He also is
charged with conspiracy to obstruct congressional inquiries in
connection with the letters.
   Robinson said Poindexter is entitled to a wide range of material
for his defense, including notes from then-Vice President Bush,
White House chief of staff Don Regan and Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger.
   Robinson said that ``any time'' Bush ``missed a meeting, Admiral
Poindexter briefed him.''
   Poindexter wants the judge to direct the office of independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh to obtain some of Reagan's notes so that they
can be turned over to the former national security adviser.
   Walsh's office obtained some typewritten excerpts of Reagan's
diaries for the Iran-Contra trial of Oliver North. North's lawyers
subpoenaed Reagan's diaries, but U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard
Gesell quashed the subpoena.

<HEAD>Second-Quarter Productivity Up Modestly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American workers posted a modest productivity
improvement in the second quarter of the year, with significant
gains by factory workers leading the way, the government said
Wednesday.
   The Labor Department said productivity in the non-farm portion of
the economy increased at an annual rate of 0.7 percent in the
April-June period, up from the 0.2 percent gain reported in
preliminary data last month and much better than the 1.3 percent
decline in the first quarter.
   The department said unit labor costs _ a key inflation indicator
_ increased at an annual rate of 4.9 percent in the quarter, down
from the 6.2 percent jump reported for the first quarter but
nonetheless a sign of persistent underlying inflation.
   Analysts said the small productivity gain was consistent with the
recent slowing of the economy's growth rate.
   But they said poor performance in the non-financial corporate
sector _ a category, including most service industries, in which
productivity fell and labor costs rose at a rapid 11.1 percent
annual rate _ suggested inflation was still around.
   ``The future in overall productivity growth is not encouraging''
because the service-producing sector makes up roughly 80 percent of
the economy, said Allen Sinai, chief economist for Boston Co.
Economic Advisors.
   ``The 0.7 percent increase is a low number but consistent with
the cyclical problems that typically occur as growth slows down,''
said economist Roger Brinner of DRI-McGraw Hill. ``Employers are
reluctant to trim their work force so that when the economy
downshifts you have to expect a dip in productivity growth.''
   The second-quarter improvement came as output grew at an annual
rate of 2.4 percent while hours worked expanded by 1.7 percent.
   Gains in productivity _ output per hours worked _ are seen as
vital to economic growth at times of near full employment and tight
labor markets in skilled jobs.
   Improved productivity in manufacturing also helps U.S.
competitiveness in world markets. Workers in manufacturing posted a
productivity gain of 2.9 percent at an annual rate in the second
quarter, up from the 2.4 percent increase reported in the
preliminary data.
   The Labor Department said hourly compensation rose at an annual
rate of 5.6 percent in the quarter, but consumer inflation continued
to more than erase the wage gains. Real hourly compensation _ hourly
compensation minus consumer inflation _ fell 0.7 percent, the
department said.
   The preliminary data had put the hourly compensation increase at
an annual rate of 5.5 percent and the decline in real wages at 0.9
percent. In the first quarter, hourly compensation rose at an annual
rate of 4.8 percent and real wages declined 0.6 percent.
   The 2.9 percent annual-rate productivity gain in manufacturing in
the second quarter followed a 2.1 percent gain in the January-March
period. Unit labor costs in manufacturing fell at an annual rate of
0.4 percent after increasing at an annual rate of 1.0 percent in the
first quarter.
   ``We have a lean and mean manufacturing sector,'' said Sinai.
``This is really something to cheer about in the continued strong
performance in productivity and cost control in the manufacturing
sector.''
   The second-quarter manufacturing gain came as output rose at an
annual rate of 2.9 percent while the number of hours worked held
steady after rising at an annual rate of 1.1 percent in the first
quarter.
   Factory workers saw their real wages fall at an annual rate of
3.7 percent in the second quarter, with inflation stripping away an
increase of 2.4 percent, at an annual rate, in hourly compensation
in manufacturing, the Labor Department said.
   A separate figure that includes the farm sector of the economy
showed that productivity rose at an annual rate of 1.3 percent, as
output climbed 1.9 percent while hours worked rose by 0.6 percent.
The report attributed that gain to improved productivity by farm
workers.

<TEXT>
   President Bush is largely responsibile for the
slow pace of filling key government positions and his complaint of
Senate foot dragging is ``unfounded and unfair,'' Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell said Wednesday.
   The Maine Democrat told the Senate that of the 432 full-time
Executive Branch positions requiring Senate confirmation, there are
200 jobs for which no nomination has been submitted or no
announcement made that the incumbent would be retained.
   ``Thus, nearly eight months after he took office, the president
has failed to make nominations for nearly half of the full-time
positions in executive departments and independent agencies which
require Senate confirmation,'' Mitchell said.
   ``Whose responsibility is that?'' he asked. ``It is certainly not
the Senate's.''
   Mitchell noted that after he met with Bush on Aug. 4 to discuss
nominations, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said,
``The president wanted to express his deep concern that these
(nominations) were being held up for artificial reasons not related
to the candidates themselves.''
   Mitchell said that, based on a careful review of the status of
the Bush nominations to date, he is ``urging that the president
discontinue such criticism.''
   ``It is unfounded and unfair,'' Mitchll said. ``The principal
problem is in the slow pace at which nominations are being made, not
in the pace at which nominations, once made, are being processed.''
   He said there are 48 leadership positions in government
departments that are ``totally vacant,'' with no nominations
submitted and no holdovers from the Reagan administration in place.
   ``Out of 14 Cabinet deartments, only the Department of
Transportation has no totally vacant positions,'' Mitchell said.
``There are five totally vacant positions in the Executive Office of
the President and another 20 in major independent agencies.''
   In the field of public health, Mitchell said, there is no nominee
for Surgeon General, commissioner of aging or for the position of
administrator of the Health Care Finance Administration.
   In education, he said, there are no nominees to fill assistant
secretary positions in elementary and secondary education or in
vocational and adult education and civil rights.
   ``The vital 1990 census is rapidly approaching and there is no
nominee to be director of the Census Bureau,'' Mitchell said.
``Whose responsibility is that?''
   Mitchell asserted that the Senate, by way of contrast, has
confirmed 212 Bush nominees, 90 percent of them within two months of
the time the nominations was received.
   Mitchell did not include in his count nominations for U.S.
ambassadors, U.S. marshalls or U.S. attorneys.

<HEAD>Spotted Owl Injunction Lifted</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court today lifted an
injunction blocking the cutting of old-growth timber on federal land
in Oregon but kept alive a lawsuit by environmentalists to protect
the northern spotted owl.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled that
a federal law backed by the timber industry prohibited the
conservationists from challenging the U.S. Bureau of Land
Management's logging plans.
   The court removed an injunction it had imposed June 7. The
injunction had prohibited cutting of old-growth timber within 2.1
miles of spotted owl nests.
   Scientists say the owl depends on old growth timber for its
survival, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is studying the owl
for possible designation as a threatened species.
   ``It's a stunning defeat for the conservation community,'' said
Boyd Peters, a spokesman for the environmental group Headwaters.
   It wasn't immediately clear when loggers would allowed to go in
to cut down more old growth timber, which is generally considered
trees that are hundreds of years old. Such trees coveted by loggers
for their superior timber.
   Timber interests argued the injunction posed a threat to the
Pacific Northwest's timber supply and would cost thousands of people
their jobs in wood products plants and mills.
   The appeals court said that under law, environmentalists could
not challenge an existing BLM timber management plan.
   However, the court revived the conservationists' claims that the
destruction of spotted owl habitat violated the Migratory Bird
Treaty Act and federal, Oregon and California law.
   A lower-court judge had dismissed those claims, saying they
should have raised earlier.
   The appeals court ordered U.S. District Judge Helen Frye to
reconsider the claims, saying environmental groups had acted as soon
as they could after getting new information about possible danger to
the owl.

<TEXT>
   Belgian author Georges Simenon, who created the
popular Inspector Maigret while churning out novels that sold more
than 500 million copies worldwide, has died. He was 86.
   Simenon died in his sleep Monday at his home in Lausanne,
Switzerland, Henri-Charles Tauxe, a Swiss journalist and friend of
the author, said Wednesday.
   Simenon's strength had ebbed over the past year and he was
confined to a wheelchair.
   His popularity stemmed from more than 200 novels, including 80
that centered on Paris detective Maigret, who tried to understand
rather than condemn criminals.
   His books were translated into 55 languages, including Chinese,
Armenian and Yiddish. Charles Laughton and German actor Heinz
Ruehmann were among those who played Maigret in about 50 film
adaptations.
   Jean Richard, a French actor who played Maigret in dozens of
television films, said: ``For me, he was the greatest popular French
author without comparison. He was the new Balzac.''
   French President Francois Mitterrand said Simenon's books ``will
remain the companions of generations of readers on all continents.''
   The official Soviet news agency Tass eulogized Simenon as a
``master detective story writer.''
   His novels were a staple in the Soviet Union.
   While best known for Maigret, Simenon himself preferred the 132
other novels, often dark accounts of people in crisis.
   ``The Cat,'' describing the love-hate relationship of a French
couple, was turned into an acclaimed movie starring Jean Gabin and
Simone Signoret.
   His 1981 memoirs were called ``Intimate Memoirs.'' Sparked by the
1978 suicide of his daughter, Marie-Jo, at age 25, its tempestuous
story encompassed despair and happiness, love and sex, luxury and
homesickness.
   Simenon said he spent most of his life ``obsessed by a frantic
sexuality'' and claimed he slept with 10,000 women ``to learn the
truth'' about the other sex.
   He also published 21 volumes of ``Dictations,'' transcripts of
thoughts and memories taped during an eight-year period when Simenon
suffered an ear condition that upset his sense of balance.
   Simenon also wrote about 300 early pulp fiction novels under
pseudonyms and more than 1,000 newspaper articles on his travels.
   Andre Gide, the late French Nobel laureate, once rated his friend
``perhaps the greatest and most genuine novelist'' of a generation.
   Simenon was born Feb. 13, 1903, in Liege, Belgium.
   He quit school at 16, working as a baker's apprentice and
bookstore clerk before reporting for a local newspaper. That career
ended after he wrote a satire about his superiors and his family,
including his wealthy uncle who never spoke to him again.
   Simenon moved to Paris in 1922 and began churning out novels,
chiefly for consumption by homemakers. He wrote anything that sold _
from sentimental stories to adventure books and travelogues _
drawing his basic information from the Larousse encyclopedia.
   In three years, he made enough money to rent a chic apartment at
the Place des Vosges and own a chauffeur-driven car and a yacht.
   He wrote his first Maigret work, ``The Strange Case of Pieter the
Lett,'' in 1929.
   After World War II, Simenon spent several years in the United
States and Canada. There, he produced some of his finest works,
including the 1947 ``Letter To My Judge'' and ``The Snow Was Dirty.''
   In the early 1960s, Simenon wrote up to six books a year on his
electric typewriter, picking the names of his characters from
international telephone books.
   Suffering from the ear problem, he put away the typewriter in
1972.
   In the United States, Simenon divorced his French-born first wife
of 27 years, Regine, and married Denise Quimet, a Canadian. They
settled in Switzerland and separated in 1969 but never divorced.
   Simenon said he found complete happiness only after meeting
Teresa, his wife's Venice-born chambermaid 20 years his junior. They
moved into a plainly furnished farmhouse in Lausanne.
   The author was cremated Wednesday with only closest family
present, a Lausanne funeral home said. According to his wish, his
ashes were scattered under a cedar tree outside his house beside
those of his daughter, Marie-Jo.
   Simenon is survived by three sons. His fortune is estimated in
the hundreds of millions of dollars.

   The nation's only state-run football pool
based on the point spreads of NFL games began taking bets today.
   ``The system is up and running,'' said Oregon Lottery Director
Jim Davey. He said retailers sold about $1,100 worth of bets
statewide in the game's first three hours, which he called ``pretty
good.''
   The National Football League has threatened legal action against
the state, charging that the pool, called Sports Action, will hurt
the integrity of professional football.
   But Oregon's move has inspired other states to consider offering
such pools. The pool was created as a way to generate money for
athletics and scholarships at Oregon's colleges.
   The point spreads are to be made each week by Michael ``Roxy''
Roxborough, an oddsmaker in Nevada. Sports Action bets can be made
as late as Sunday afternoon each week, provided that the games being
played haven't started.
   Players can bet on four to 10, or all 14, NFL games each week.
Wagers can be for $1-$5, $10 or $20 on each entry form.
   ``I imagine the betting will pick up toward the weekend,'' Davey
said. ``The first NFL game isn't until Sunday morning, so people
have lots of time to think about it.''

   Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the first Cuban-American
to serve in Congress, was sworn in Wednesday as a Republican member
of the House from Florida.
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, 37, succeeded the late Democratic Rep. Claude
Pepper, giving the House 176 Republicans and 255 Democrats. There
are four vacancies.
   In a brief maiden speech on the House floor, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen
said:
   ``As a Cuban-American whose family has fled the horrors of
communism, I think that this day serves to solidify the belief and
the truth that the United States truly is the land of opportunity,
where all of our dreams can be made possible if we try hard enough.''
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen was elected over Miami attorney Gerald Richman
in a special election last month. Pepper had represented the 18th
district since it was created in 1962.
   Her election was considered a victory not only for
Cuban-Americans, but also for the Republican National Committee,
which had targeted the seat. President Bush campaigned for Ms.
Ros-Lehtinen.
   A former state legislator who left Cuba as a child with her
parents, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen is married to Dexter Lehtinen, the U.S.
attorney in Miami.

   The State Department said Wednesday terrorist
attacks by leftist rebels in El Salvador must cease if proposed
peace talks are to have a chance for success.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler made the statement after the FMLN
rebel movement accepted an offer by Salvadoran President Alfredo
Cristiani to hold discussions aimed at ending the country's 10-year
old civil war.
   She expressed hope that if talks are held, the insurgents will
participate with a constructive attitude.
   ``We note, however, that the FMLN staged a major ambush
yesterday, killing 16 Salvadoran soldiers and that FMLN terrorists
have burned more than 40 privately owned buses over the past
month,'' she said.
   ``The FMLN must cease the violence in order for the talks with
the government to have a chance for success.''
   If peace talks are held, it would be the first meeting between
representatives of the belligerents since President Alfredo
Cristiani took office June 1 and called for discussions on ending
the war.

<HEAD>New Booklet Discourages Isolating AIDS Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students and teachers infected with the AIDS
virus should be free to attend class without fear their disease will
be made public, a new guide for the nation's schools said Wednesday.
   ``Someone At School Has AIDS,'' released by the National
Association of State Boards of Education, said the deadly virus ``is
not transmitted by casual, everyday contact'' so confidentiality
should be school policy.
   Parents shouldn't have to reveal their child's infection if the
decision is sanctioned by a physician, who finds the child does not
have secondary infections, such as tuberculosis, said the guidelines.
   The report suggests that school superintendents be notified, but
even those ``decisions should be approved by the infected person and
a student's parents or guardians.''
   The report, developed by a panel of 20 organizations representing
law, medicine, public health and education groups, is an update of
guidelines issued by the Centers of Disease Control in 1985.
   ``Until now, many people have been fearful that (AIDS) could be
transmitted at school,'' said the booklet. ``We have enough
information to stop worrying about this. What we do need to worry
about _ and the place to put our energy and concern _ is into
education.''
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a fatal disease
that destroys the body's ability to fight infection. The disease is
spread through the exchange of body fluids infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus, popularly called HIV.
   The guide said about 1.5 million people in the United States are
infected with the HIV virus. More than 102,000 cases of AIDS have
been diagnosed in this country since 1981, and more than 59,000 of
those victims have died.
   Lloyd Kolbe, director of CDC's division of adolescent and school
health, said about 1,276 children from birth up to 19-years-old have
been diagnosed with AIDS.
   In recent years, children infected by the AIDS virus have been
banned from classrooms and in a few cases the entire family forced
to leave town. Infected school staff have reportedly been harassed
or fired.
   The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials
described the guide as ``clear, concise and straightforward
information.'' The Council of Chief State School Officers predicted
the booklet ``will be of inestimable value'' because, ``it is both
scientifically accurate and sensitive to the mission of schools.''
   Jim Williams of the National Education Association's Health
Information Network said, ``We revised our policy on the issue of
confidentiality and testing of students'' based on the guide's
recommendation.
   Beverly Farquhar, director of the National Association of School
Nurses, added, ``This has really helped our cause a great deal.''
She said school officials, who in the past had been reluctant, now
enthusiastically allow the association to conduct special workshops
for teachers on the proper handling of bodily fluids.
   The new booklet gives educators up-to-date knowledge about AIDS
and how the disease is spread, said Brenda Welburn of the school
board association. Previous guidelines suggested that schools be
cautious about children who bite or who weren't toilet trained, in
case the AIDS virus might be transmitted through saliva or handling
diapers.
   ``We now know that HIV is not transmitted through saliva or
urine,'' said Welburn. ``Even the possibility that the AIDS virus
would be transmitted through simple exposure to blood is extremely
low.''
   So the suggested policy is to allow students who are infected to
attend school and be entitled to all rights, privileges and services
received by other students, the guide said.
   ``No school employee shall be terminated, non-renewed, demoted,
suspended, transferred or subjected to adverse action based solely
on the fact that he or she is infected with HIV,'' it said.
   Those who become ill should be allowed to retain all benefits
that are provided for other school employees with long-term diseases
or disabling conditions, the guide said.
   Since confidentiality is a key point in the new guidelines,
school officials are encouraged to handle the situation in a
standard, confidential manner.
   Mandatory testing has no place in the nation's schools, the
guidelines said. The suggested policy states, ``Mandatory screening
for communicable diseases that are not spread by casual contact,
such as HIV infection, shall not be a condition for school entry or
attendance, or for employment or continued employment.''

   The city and a group of parents told a judge
today that retarded people living at home are likely to backslide in
their skills because the state cut off money for workshops, training
and other services.
   The plaintiffs asked a Commonwealth Court judge to restore $7.9
million cut June 30 from programs that benefit 7,750 retarded people
living at home.
   Unless the aid is restored, thousands of retarded people may be
forced into institutions against their families' wishes in order to
get help, the city has charged.
   The state of Pennsylvania contends it is meeting its obligation
under law to dole out its limited resources fairly.
   David Ferleger, a lawyer for the parents, said that if the
parents prevail, he will then argue that all retarded people living
at home _ not just the 7,550 Philadelphians involved in the lawsuit
today _ have a right to the such services at home.
   Leona Fialkowski, whose son David, 27, was dropped from the
program on July 14, and Audrey Coccia, whose daughter Gina, 22, was
similarly removed, testified their children have been regressing
because of a lack of services.
   ``We are starting to see regression in David in his efforts in
walking and self-help,'' Mrs. Fialkowski said. ``He needs attention
to maintain what he has. He cannot walk now the distance he could
walk before. He is being harmed because of the lack of training and
the lack of physical therapy.''
   Mrs. Coccia said her daughter had been learning how to work and
was taught living skills. ``And now most of the time she watches
television, follows her father and me around the house,'' she said.
   Ferleger said that if he succeeds in proving that all retarded
people at home are entitled to such programs, thousands more
retarded people across Pennsylvania will receive services at home at
an additional cost to the state of about $30 million, of which
one-third would go to Philadelphia.
   ``This could involve more than 100,000 persons with retardation
across the country,'' he said.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently ruled that
reducing such services does not violate a retarded person's rights
under the U.S. Constititution. The court sent the case back to the
state courts.
   Richard Gold, first deputy city solicitor, said budget
constraints since 1983 in retardation programs have forced the city
in the last two months to end or reduce ``minimum essential
services'' to retarded people living at home.
   ``We contend they have a right to continue to receive those
services under state law, and the state is obligated to pay 90
percent of those costs while the city picks up the rest of the
bill,'' Gold said. He said the city's allocation from the state is
$7.9 million short.
   But Assistant Attorney General Gwen Mosley, representing the
state, said Pennsylvania is doing all it is required to do. She said
the state budgeted about $105.3 million, of which Philadelphia's
share is approximately $20 million.
   ``Some people need residential services and they can't get it,
and some need at-home services and they can't get it,'' she said.
``There are waiting lists. The need outstrips the resources
available.''
   Ms. Mosley said the state is required by law to distribute its
money ``in a fair and reasonable manner.''
   ``This means that all the counties will get some but not all the
monies they need,'' she said.

   An early version of the data computing system that
eventually will fly aboard the Freedom Space Station was delivered
to NASA, the makers of the system said Wednesday.
   The delivery by IBM is the first computer hardware and software
for Freedom's data management system.
   Engineers at NASA and its contractor companies will use it to
test their design for the space station's other subsystems.
Programmers will use it as a working model on which to write and
test software programs.
   The system will provide data processing and local communications
for the station's basic operations and its payloads.
   ``The data management system is the integrating element of Space
Station Freedom _ the `glue' that connects the many different
systems and helps them work together,'' said Michael W. Dawkins,
general manager of the IBM Systems Integration Division facility in
Houston that is developing the onboard computer system.
   IBM performed the work for McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co., a
major contractor for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.

   Chelsea High welcomed back its students
Wednesday with signs in English, Spanish, Cambodian and Vietnamese
reflecting its melting pot demographics. The signs also greeted a
newcomer, Boston University, which will run Chelsea's troubled
schools for the next decade.
   ``A lot of things are still tentative, but the students and
faculty are looking forward to change,'' Principal Mary Raimo said
of the unprecedented takeover of a public school system by a private
institution.
   Change will not come quickly to 80-year-old Chelsea High or the
five other aging schools in this poor community. Although there are
immediate plans for a school for chronic truants, computer labs and
new curricula, the university has loftier, longer-term goals.
   Officials talk of fostering children's education by schooling
parents in reading, nutrition and child care. The talk is of
creating an atmosphere that stresses education long before children
walk into school for the first time.
   ``This is not a cute little project involving some classrooms,''
said Peter Greer, Boston University's dean of education who will
oversee the management team. ``We're talking about a philosophy that
education can emancipate the underclass in the United States.''
   But, the university faces significant hurdles. Many in this
community of 26,000 remain wary about surrendering their children's
education to academicians. The teacher's union and Hispanic parents
have filed suit challenging the agreement. Others fret the
university won't raise the $2 million to $3 million a year it
promised for special programs.
   ``The money was supposed to come in hand over fist, but we
haven't seen it,'' said Elizabeth McBride, chairwoman of the Chelsea
School Committee.
   The unique agreement between the university and Chelsea follows
years of hard times for 3,500-student school system. An influx of
immigrants from Latin America and Southeast Asia swelled the school
population; declining tax revenues cut school budgets.
   Chelsea now spends $1,600 less per student than the national
average. Test scores, graduation rates and teacher salaries are
among the lowest in Massachusetts.
   The situation led to meetings with John Silber, the president of
Boston University who has long sought to use his school's resources
in public education. After months of negotiations among the school
committee, aldermen and the state Legislature, an agreement was
reached in June giving the university control of the schools.
   The school committee has advise and consent powers over BU
programs. It can negate university plans with a two-thirds vote but
cannot overrule personnel decisions.
   ``I feel that it's taking away the power of elected officials,
taking away voters' rights,'' said Mrs. McBride, who six of her
children through the community's schools.
   But if Chelsea residents have lost some political control over
their schools, BU wants to get them involved in a much more intimate
way.
   The university experimented with a literacy program this spring
for mothers and their young children. Twenty-three families met with
teachers and tutors two-hours a day for several weeks. While
children were introduced to reading, their mothers improved their
own reading and learned how to teach their children.
   ``If we're successful we will help parents be aware they instill
the love of learning,'' said Jean Paratore, an associate BU
professor who heads the program.
   The program is a precursor to BU's plans for greater involvement
of the family in education. Greer talks of adult classes on
nutrition, parenting, child care and even pre-natal care.
   ``Even if you pour zillions of dollars in classrooms and
teachers, it isn't going to work unless you have healthy students
supported by their parents,'' said Greer, former superintendent of
Portland, Maine's, schools.
   Yet money is an issue. BU officials talked of raising $50 million
through the life of its contract with Chelsea. While more money is
expected, only $726,000 in pledges were in hand by late August,
leaving many programs on hold.
   And there are other anxieties. Chelsea's teachers are mindful of
Silber's stormy relations with his university's unions; Hispanics,
fearful the new management might end bilingual education, went to
court to try to stop the takeover.
   Some rough road has been smoothed over for now. The BU management
team has several bilingual experts, including Diana Lam, a
Peruvian-born bilingual expert, picked to be Chelsea's new school
superintendent. The union has signed an interim contract with BU
that gives teachers an average bonus of $1,300.

<HEAD>Hundreds May Have Been Killed in Iraqi Missile Plant Explosion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Many sources report an explosion Aug. 17
at an Iraqi missile plant south of Baghdad and some put the death
toll at more than 700, but Iraq's obsessively secret government has
said nothing.
   Western diplomats reached by telephone Wednesday in Baghdad,
capital of Iraq, confirmed an explosion occurred at the huge missile
complex but said they had no details.
   No information was available on what caused the explosion, but
there was no immediate indication of sabotage.
   In London, the daily Independent quoted diplomats and Middle East
sources Wednesday as saying 700 people were killed, including
Egyptian engineers helping the Iraqis develop a new missile.
   An official of the rebel Patriotic Union of Kurdistan reported by
telephone that sources in Iraq said 700 bodies were removed from the
plant and the casualty toll might reach 2,500 dead and wounded. The
official, known to The Associated Press, asked that his name and
location be concealed.
   A British Broadcasting Corp. report said Egypt's Defense Ministry
confirmed the explosion, but an army general at the ministry said
privately: ``I have no knowledge of an explosion or of Egyptian
wounded coming to Cairo from Iraq.''
   The Independent said the casualties included Egyptian personnel
who were flown to Cairo in three Egyptian air force transports Aug.
18.
   Iraq, with Egyptian help, is believed to be developing a modified
version of Argentina's medium-range Condor 2, which the Iraqis call
the Badr 2000, at the plant 40 miles south of Baghdad.
   The Independent quoted Egyptian sources as saying Egyptian
casualties were taken to the Maadi military hospital in Cairo. The
report said the hospital was closed to civilians Aug. 19 and
specialists in skin grafts, burns and respiratory ailments were
brought in.
   A senior official of the hospital told the The Associated Press
on Wednesday it had not been closed to civilians. He denied reports
that large numbers of Egyptian casualties from Iraq had been taken
there.
   According to the Kurdish rebel official, the explosion started a
fire that destroyed at least 30 percent of the missile complex,
which is said to include laboratories, factories and living quarters
for workers.
   Several reports said the Iraqis used firefighting aircraft to
fight the blaze but could not bring it under control until Aug. 25.
How many people worked at the plant was not known.
   Sources linked to other Kurdish rebel groups said the facility
included a chemical weapons factory and that some casualties had
wounds consistent with chemical agents.
   There was no independent confirmation, but Iraq is known to
produce poison gases. The United Nations cited Iraq several times
for using chemical weapons, outlawed under a 1925 Geneva protocol,
during the eight-year war with Iran.
   Western military analysts have said for months that Iraq was
developing the Badr 2000 to carry nuclear or chemical warheads up to
1,000 kilometers, or more than 600 miles.
   The Kurdish sources said the missile complex was protected by an
elite military force and covered nearly 1,000 square miles, which
indicated it might include a test-firing range.
   Israel fears such weapons as the Badr 2000, which could reach
targets within its borders, will erode its traditional technological
superiority over its Arab neighbors. Its air force destroyed a
nuclear reactor near Baghdad in June 1981, which the Israelis said
soon would be capable of producing weapons.
   Officials in Israel say West German, French and Italian companies
have been involved in the Badr 2000 project.
   Iraq has warned Israel against another air strike at strategic
facilities and has tightened anti-aircraft missile defenses at key
installations.

   Little Edward saw the hospital room that has
been his home almost since birth 4{ months ago suddenly fill with
bright lights and big people, and he did what comes naturally to
infants.
   He cried.
   And President Bush, touring District of Columbia General
Hospital's ward for babies abandoned at birth by crack-addicted
mothers, did what comes naturally to a father of six and grandfather
of 11.
   He picked Edward up and cradled him against his shoulder.
   ``What's the matter with you? What in the world's the matter with
you?'' asked the president in a soft voice.
   Instantly, the baby stopped bawling and flashed a big smile.
   ``You just want a little attention, don't you? See, it works,''
the president, garbed in a blue hospital gown, told his health
secretary, Louis Sullivan.
   For Bush, the visit Wednesday to the pediatrics ward of D.C.
General was a chance to dramatize his new national strategy to fight
a menace that finds its youngest victims still in the womb.
   Edward and a dozen other infants at D.C. General are so-called
``boarder babies'' abandoned after birth by mothers addicted to
drugs.
   The babies, even after being cured of their own drug
dependencies, still must wait for months until foster care can be
found for them.
   At least one of the children has tested positive for the HIV
virus, which causes AIDS.
   Bush, out of sight of cameras, toured other rooms where the
hospital staff was nursing tiny, underweight infants to health, and
caring for others for whom the prognosis was grim.
   Dr. Stanley Sinkford, the chief of pediatrics, showed Bush one
infant who had bacterial meningitis, a swollen brain and has already
undergone several operations. The mother, who left a home phone
number that turned out to be a local barber shop, has not been found.
   In the room of an infant who tested positive for the AIDS
antibody, Bush asked, ``Does that baby have a chance to get well?''
   ``We don't know,'' Sinkford replied.
   In the intensive care nursery, Bush peered at the tiny, frail
babies hooked up to intravenous lines and monitors.
   ``What's this guy's problem?'' Bush asked about one infant.
   ``Just born too soon,'' said Sinkford.
   Twenty percent of the 2,025 babies born at D.C. General last year
were exposed to drugs in the womb, mostly cocaine, hospital
officials said.
   Fourteen to 15 percent are low-weight births, below the 5{-pound
mark that signifies danger. That is double the national rate.
   Edward and a dozen other boarder babies generally are healthy,
but homeless. They are not eligible for adoption because the mothers
never relinquished their legal rights before abandoning them,
hospital officials said.
   Marilou King, chairwoman of the D.C. General Hospital Commission,
said the hospital is considering opening an orphanage on its grounds
to meet the problem. Each boarder baby costs the hospital an average
of $100,000 a year.
   ``They cannot get maternal love in a hospital setting,'' said Dr.
Mehnur Abedin, the neonatologist in charge of the nursery.
   Later, back at the White House, Bush told reporters, ``I was
deeply touched by seeing these abandoned babies.''
   ``The commitment of these nurses and these doctors to these kids
that are born without hope is so encouraging. The only love they may
ever get in their lives is when they're a month old, and we've got
to change that,'' Bush said.
   He said it underscores the need for community involvement and
voluntary efforts to solve the drug problem.
   He promised to ``work my hardest'' to make the national drug
strategy work, but said, ``It's at the level of love, and the level
of local education and parental concern, neighbor involving with
neighbor ... in the life of another, that this problem is going to
be solved.
   ``I'm absolutely convinced of it. And I'm more convinced of it
than ever after holding in my arms one of those abandoned babies,''
he said.

   Torrential rains and flash floods on the
east coast of Spain and its Mediterranean islands drowned three
people and left three others missing Wednesday, police said.
   The storms also knocked out telephone and power service to
thousands of people and closed highways and airports, civil defense
workers said.
   On the island of Ibiza, Bruce McQueen of Britain and Francois
D'Hont of Belgium drowned in stormy coastal waters, said a civil
governor's spokeswoman on condition of anonymity.
   In Valencia, on Spain's eastern coast, rescue workers Wednesday
recovered the body of Jose Albert Marti, 24, of Alcacer, police
said. He drowned in rushing flood waters that carried him five miles
from his car, police said.
   On the island of Majorca, next to Ibiza, flood waters also swept
away a young Spanish woman and two children at Porto Colom, police
said. They remained missing.
   The torrential rainstorm began early Tuesday and dropped nearly
10 inches of rain along the 248-mile coastline, damaging buildings
and ruining crops, the Civil Defense Agency said.
   Telefonica, the national telephone company, said about 50,000
customers in Valencia province remained without service Wednesday.
Thousands of households also remained without power.
   The downpour mostly affected the provinces of Valencia, Alicante,
Murcia and Almeria, the National Weather Service said.
   The service predicted continued heavy rain for the region.
   The heavy rain forced authorities to close airports in Valencia
and Alicante, and they remained shut Wednesday. Floods also blocked
roads and rail lines across the region, the Transport Ministry said.
   Authorities declared a flood alert in Alicante Province, where
the Segura River threatend to overflow its banks, provincial
spokesman Enrique Simarro said.
   Civil defense workers and army troops plugged breaches along the
river near the town of Orihuela and dozens of families were
evacuated, Simarro said.
   In Valencia, a rich, agricultural region, rice growers estimated
their losses due to flooding at $16.1 million.

   Principal Barbara Erwin has found a way to
overcome gripes about the cafeteria food and get most pupils to at
least try everything they're served _ eating out with the principal.
   That's the top reward at Hayes Elementary School in a system
based on the number of paper tokens a class earns.
   ``We have four lunchroom rules, and one of them is that they must
take two bites of everything on their plates,'' Mrs. Erwin said.
``If they obey all four rules for five days, everyone in their room
gets a stick of bubblegum.''
   From there, students can advance to a sack of popcorn, a candy
bar or a poster until the final prize _ lunch at the end of the
school year with Mrs. Erwin at a hamburger shop.
   The other rules are no loud talking until the lunch is finished,
clean up the table and the area and no ``fussing on the
playground,'' Mrs. Erwin said.

<HEAD>Hersh: My Lai Story Sprang from Phone Call</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seymour Hersh, who 20 years ago was the first
reporter to describe the My Lai massacre, says he was put onto the
story by a telephone tip from a lawyer he barely knew.
   Writing in the October-November issue of Memories magazine, Hersh
recalls working as a free-lance writer in Washington on Oct. 22,
1969, when he got a telephone call from Geoffrey Cowan.
   Cowan told Hersh about a rumor he'd heard: The Army was going to
secretly court-martial a soldier at Fort Benning, Ga., for killing
civilians in South Vietnam. He asked Hersh if he was interested.
   ``To this day I'm not sure why I was,'' writes Hersh, who had
covered the Pentagon for The Associated Press and ``had come away
hating the war, convinced that ... its emphasis on body counts and
statistical success ... was turning the officer corps into
professional liars.''
   But Hersh says he also came to realize that many officers at the
Pentagon ``were as troubled as I was. Maybe it was that
understanding, dimly perceived, that set me to work on Cowan's tip.''
   Hersh confirmed the massacre with a Pentagon source and visited a
military defense lawyer in Utah. He went to Fort Benning, eventually
tracked down the key subject of the investigation, Lt. William L.
Calley Jr., and broke the story of how a platoon of Charlie Company
commanded by Calley killed about 400 civilians in the hamlet of My
Lai 4 on March 16, 1968.
   When he located Calley in quarters ordinarily reserved for senior
officers, Hersh writes, ``I think he understood in some primitive
way that we would talk and then I would write and his life would
never be the same again. He was right. Neither would mine.''
   Initially accused of killing 109 civilians, Calley was convicted
in 1970 of murdering 22, but served only three years before his
release. Hersh won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on the
incident.

   A drug baron whose capture and extradition
sparked anti-American riots that left five people dead in Honduras
was convicted of cocaine smuggling today.
   Honduran billionaire Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, 45, was
accused of overseeing a ring that distributed $72 million worth of
cocaine in Los Angeles. The Drug Enforcement Administration said he
controlled a narcotics empire worth up to $2 billion.
   The federal jury found Matta guilty of conspiracy, running a
continuing criminal enterprise, possession with intent to distribute
cocaine and distribution of cocaine.
   Matta faces 10 years and life in prison at sentencing Oct. 5,
Stolar said.
   Defense attorney Martin Stolar sought to portray Matta as a
legitimate businessman who was the largest employer in Honduras. The
government argued he was a kingpin of the powerful cocaine cartel
based in Cali, Colombia, that smuggled tons of cocaine into Arizona
and Southern California through Mexico.
   ``We're sending the right message that we want to send to the
Colombian government, that if they extradite drug kingpins we will
prosecute them to the full extent of the law,'' said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Jimmy Gurule.
   Stolar argued that Matta was illegally extradited from Honduras,
which does not have an extradition treaty with the United States.
   Police and troops arrested Matta in a pre-dawn raid on his
Tegucigalpa home in 1988 and deported him to the United States by
way of the Dominican Republic. The Honduran constitution forbids the
extradition of Honduran citizens.
   Enraged over the extradition, some 2,000 demonstrators burned the
U.S. Embassy annex. Five Hondurans died in a week of disturbances.
   The charges stemmed from a 1981 raid on a Van Nuys apartment
complex that netted $1.9 million in cash and 114 pounds of cocaine _
at that time the largest seizure of the drug in California.
   Also seized were ledgers tracing the drugs to ``El Negro,'' or
the Black One _ a name a witness said was used by Matta.
   Stolar said his client was a victim of overwhelming publicity
from Colombia and Washington that culminated in President Bush's
speech unveiling a battle plan for the war on drugs Tuesday night.
   Stolar said he had sent a telegram to the president asking him to
withhold his speech until the verdict was returned. He said he
received no response.
   ``The cocaine wars and the war against drugs have been front-page
news for three weeks, more than half the length of this trial,''
Stolar said. ``That kind of prejudicial publicity makes it difficult
for a jury to concentrate on what happens in the courtroom.''
   The government's key witness was Hector Barona Becerra, a former
Colombian cocaine trafficker who said he made smuggling flights for
Matta in 1981.
   Barona said he was introduced to the defendant in Cali and knew
him by the names ``Jose Campo'' and ``El Negro.'' Stolar argued that
``El Negro'' was a common nickname in Latin America.

<TEXT>
   The United States blamed a Christian military
commander today for forcing the evacuation of the American embassy
in Beirut by threatening to expose Ambassador John McCarthy and his
staff to a ``good dose of Christian terrorism.''
   While vowing that the United States would not abandon Lebanon
forever, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler also cited
as a reason for the pullout a reported statement by Gen. Michel Aoun
to a French newspaper that ``perhaps he should take 20 American
hostages.''
   She gave no indication when the 40 Americans might return to
their posts or if the United States had any new diplomatic
approaches to seek an end to the 15-year civil war that has torn the
Middle Eastern country apart.
   ``We have a responsibility to insure the safety of our
personnel,'' the spokeswoman said. ``We plan to go back to Beirut as
soon as conditions permit. The evacuation does not represent
diminution of our intention to try to help Lebanon in its time of
trouble.''
   Some 1,000 demonstrators backing Aoun had blocked the embassy,
while a protest leader threatened that the blockade would be moved
closer to the building and U.S. personnel could enter and leave only
``at their own risk,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   The unidentified leader warned that ``an indefinite next step
would take place'' today, she said, and a telephone caller
threatened to shoot down the U.S. helicopter that brought supplies
and messages to the embassy.
   ``As Gen. Aoun's threats and implications about the U.S. grew
nastier, the department and the embassy were in close touch through
the Labor Day weekend,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   After talking to McCarthy by telephone, Secretary of State James
A. Baker III met at 11 a.m. Tuesday with President Bush, who
approved their recommendation to evacuate the embassy.
   Bush, Baker, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft, White House chief of staff John Sununu and
Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly then met in the afternoon to
discuss implementing the decision, Ms. Tutwiler said.
   She said there was unanimous agteement on the move, despite
previous administration statements that the Beirut embassy had to
remain open despite the fighting between Christian and Moslem forces
in order to play a diplomatic role in trying to attain a cease-fire.
   ``We regret having to evacuate the embassy and the actions by
Gen. Aoun and his followers that made it necessary,'' Ms. Tutwiler
said.
   In an angry statement directed at the Christian leader, the U.S.
spokeswoman said, ``We were told yesterday by reliable journalists
on the ground that Gen. Aoun said that Lebanon needed a good dose of
`Christian terrorism.' and that ``on Friday, Sept. 2, Aoun told the
French newspaper Figaro that perhaps he should take `20 American
hostages.'''
   Abdallah Bouhabib, the Lebanese ambassador to Washington,
disputed the U.S. assessment.
   ``We think that there was no danger whatsoever for the American
diplomats there,'' he told The Associated Press. ``There have been
no real threats. The demonstration was democratic, like any
demonstration.''
   The ambassador, who said he was notified of the evacuation
Tuesday night, described the demonstration as ``a result of
frustration of asking for more assistance from a friendly
superpower.''

<HEAD>Senator Asks Redirection of International Aid Toward Environment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the
Agriculture Committee, called Wednesday for Congress to redirect
U.S. foreign aid to protect the world environment.
   He told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he will introduce
a bill aimed at helping countries develop economic alternatives that
will save forests and other natural resources.
   ``We must make some tough choices, focusing limited foreign aid
funds on critical problems: tropical deforestation and energy waste,
and in critical nations, even if we don't have programs there now,''
he said.
   According to a statement by Leahy's office, the ``International
Climate Change and Tropical Forestry Act of 1989'' would be aimed at
providing more aid to Third World countries where development often
means the destruction of tropical rain forests.
   The bill would authorize $10 million through the Agency for
International Development for programs to improve energy efficiency
and the use of renewable energy resources in developing nations. It
would also call for stronger forestry research programs, promote
international cooperation on reducing gas emissions.
   Leahy said rising world temperatures threaten farming in the
United States and other countries of the northern hemisphere. Many
scientists believe burning tropical forests and increased use of
coal and oil as fuels contribute to a general warming of the globe.
   Leahy has already introduced a bill that would force lower
emissions within the United States of gases such as carbon dioxide
believed to have the same effect.
   ``Global climate change is a major threat to agriculture
throughout the world,'' he said.
   ``With a doubling of carbon dioxide, corn production could be
reduced by 25 percent. Increased temperatures could cut world rice
production by as much as 40 percent.''
   Leahy told reporters India and Brazil are countries where more
U.S. aid could be used. India gets some direct U.S. aid, mostly in
loans to buy U.S. food, but the program has been reduced in recent
years. Brazil does not get U.S. economic help.
   Most direct U.S. aid goes to countries seen as important to U.S.
security, such as Israel, Egypt and the Philippines.
   But ``foreign military sales is not necessarily where we should
target,'' Leahy said in the interview. ``Traditional aid won't help
the environment.''

   A delegation of Chinese trade officials will
visit Washington to discuss with American officials China's
longstanding interest in joining the General Agreement on Trade and
Tariffs (GATT), the State Department said Wednesday.
   The United States has maintained an arms-length relationship with
China since the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in June but
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the upcoming
meeting was not inconsistent with that policy.
   No negotiations will be carried out during the consultations, she
said.
   The Chinese officials asked to visit the United States as part of
a lnger trip that would take them to Europe to discuss similar
issues with the European Community, she said. No date for the
meeting has been set.
   GATT is a 96-member grouping that seeks to regulate world trade.

   A little-known state assemblyman from Queens is
spending $400,000 this week to become a well-known state assemblyman
from Queens. A slightly better-known former schools chancellor is
spending $220,000.
   Their objective: to approach the fame of the very well-known
Elizabeth Holtzman. And, starting last week, she's spending $500,000.
   Such is life in the city comptroller's race, a contest for the
second most-powerful citywide elective office that has been
overshadowed by a close mayoral election and dominated by Holtzman,
a Brooklyn district attorney.
   But it is a fight the assemblyman, Alan Hevesi, and the
ex-chancellor, Frank Macchiarola, are waging with vigor. Jointly
they hope to hold Holtzman under 40 percent in the Democratic
primary, forcing a runoff. Individually each hopes to finish second
and thus emerge as her runoff opponent.
   The eventual Democratic nominee will face only token opposition
in the general election Nov. 7.
   ``We have a shot. Can't ask for more,'' Hevesi, 49, an 18-year
member of the state Assembly, said this week. ``We think the whole
thing will crystallize three days before the election.''
   With the primary this Tuesday, that leaves little time.
Macchiarola popularity polls put him in the teens. Hevesi has only
single-digit support, although Wednesday he was endorsed by a fourth
candidate, Assemblyman Jerrold Nadler, who dropped out.
   But while Holtzman leads solidly, she slipped to 37 percent in a
New York Newsday poll conducted last week and released Wednesday _
the first time she has fallen under the 40 percent threshold.
   ``If she gets under 40 the guy who comes in second has got a very
good chance of beating her,'' said Norman Adler, a veteran political
strategist. ``Liz is a mile wide and an inch deep. The only thing
people know about her is her name.''
   Holtzman, 47, made her name as a congresswoman in the 1970s, when
she served on the House committee on Watergate and on the Budget
Committee. She ran for the U.S. Senate in 1980, narrowly losing to
Republican Alfonse D'Amato, and won office as Brooklyn district
attorney in 1982.
   She was frontrunner from the start in the race for comptroller, a
seat vacated after 16 years by Harrison J. Goldin, who is running
for mayor. The comptroller, as the city's chief fiscal officer,
conducts audits and manages $30 billion in pension funds.
   Holtzman has conducted a confident campaign, steering clear of a
televised debate and dismissing Macchiarola, Hevesi and Nadler as
``the gang of three.''
   ``My candidates attack me for having name recognition as if it
were a disease,'' she said this week. ``It's not simply name
recognition that I have. It's what people know about me and
associate with me _ that I've worked hard, vigorously and well for
the people of this city.''
   But her opponents mention other attributes: a brittle public
persona and a reputation for staff disharmony. ``She has one major
problem,'' declared Nadler. ``Her atrociously incompetent conduct of
the D.A.'s office.''
   Less biased analysts have reached conclusions that are tamer but
still damaging. To serve as an effective comptroller ``will take
political grace and skill,'' The New York Times editorialized last
month. ``Those are not the first words that come to mind about Ms.
Holtzman.'' It endorsed Hevesi.
   So did two other dailies, the Daily News and New York Newsday,
points being hit by Hevesi in an avalanche of television ads
unleashed Tuesday. New Yorkers who miss it on the tube may catch it
in their mail: Hevesi is sending out 350,000 postcards this week
touting his endorsements.
   ``Nobody's ever heard of me,'' he said. ``After $400,000, a lot
of people are going to have heard of me.''
   Macchiarola, 48, who started his $220,000 television blitz last
week, has enlivened the race with ads touting him as ``the fighting
professor'' _ he's a business professor at Columbia University with
a combative style. In one debate, he called Holtzman ``thick.''

   A. Bartlett Giamatti, major league
baseball commissioner and former president of Yale University, was
laid to rest Wednesday after a private graveside service.
   The grave was in the Grove Street Cemetery, traditional burial
site for Yale presidents. Entrance to the cemetery was guarded
during the service, and the gates were locked immediately after
mourners left.
   At least 50 relatives and friends, including Yale President Benno
C. Schmidt Jr. and Mayor Biagio DiLieto, attended the 25-minute
service. The Rev. Harry B. Adams, the Yale chaplain, officiated.
   Giamatti served as president of Yale from 1978 to June 1986
before becoming president of baseball's National League. He became
baseball commissioner in April.
   Fay Vincent, deputy baseball commissioner, was named acting
commissioner until a successor is named.
   Giamatti, who was 51, died Friday after suffering a heart attack
at his summer home on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. He is
survived by his wife, Toni, and three children.
   The service was kept private at the request of the Giamatti
family. A public memorial service was planned, but no date was set.
   Most of Giamatti's 18 predecessors as president of Yale are
buried in the cemetery, which dates from 1796. The cemetery, located
along the Yale campus, also contains the graves of such famous men
as Eli Whitney and Noah Webster.
   Giamatti spent half his life at Yale, first as student, then 12
years as a teacher and then eight years as president.

its new Community Spirit Award.
   The award will be presented next month to a city or town whose
residents pitched in to achieve a mission, much like Midlanders came

   An artwork on exhibit at a state-run gallery
depicts Gov. Mario Cuomo as a puppeteer and has an official fuming
that tighter admissions procedures are needed.
   The work, showing Cuomo pulling the strings on efforts to build a
radioactive waste dump, is not appropriate for the display that
opened last Friday at the Vietnam War Veterans Memorial Gallery,
said Thomas Tubbs, a state Office of General Services spokesman. The
gallery is in the Empire State Plaza, a complex of government
buildings.
   The OGS plans to draw up formal review policies for artists who
want to display works in the future, said Tubbs, who also is a
Vietnam veteran.
   ``The Vietnam memorial was meant to commemorate my fellow
soldiers who were killed in Vietnam and those missing in action,''
Tubbs said Tuesday.
   The artist, Norman Roth, of Moon Beach in Cayuga County, said OGS
officials pressured him to remove his work.
   Tubbs denied that Roth was asked to remove the artwork and said
the piece will remain until the exhibit closes in mid-October.
   The governor was steering clear. His spokesman Tom Conroy said
Cuomo has not seen the work but that he would not call for its
removal.

   ``Everybody is pleased to meet me. When I'm out, they won't even

   Khashoggi, who is being tried in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan, is charged with having helped Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos
plunder the Philippine treasury. He faces up to five years in jail
and a $250,000 fine on each of the two charges.
   Khashoggi blames his indictment on the former U.S. District
attorney in Manhattan.
   ``It is Rudolph Giuliani who started this whole business. He is
dying to be mayor of New York and for this he has to prove how
active he is, how tough, a real fighter for justice,'' he said.

   Donald Trump, whose name already adorns two
casinos, a Manhattan skyscraper, an air shuttle, a bicycle race and
a board game, scrapped plans to go video Wednesday due to a
contractural snag, a publicist said.
   The billionaire developer was to join Thursday with executives
from Lorimar Television and Warner Brothers to announce plans for
``Trump Card,'' a new television series, but the deal fell through,
said Barry Stagg, spokesman for Warner Bros. Television.
   ``The announcement is off,'' said Stagg. ``There are last minute
contractural points that have to be worked out.''
   Stagg said the negotiations would continue, although there would
be no announcement on the show's status until next week at the
earliest. The shows intended format was not revealed.

   A leading anti-apartheid advocacy group
lambasted President Bush on Wednesday for not condemning the South
African government and not supporting the escalating defiance
campaign by the black majority.
   Transafrica urged the Bush administration to prevent the
rescheduling of $21 billion that South Africa owes U.S. banks. The
loans are due next June.
   ``Bush has been an extraordinarily indecisive president,''
Randall Robinson, executive director of Transafrica, told a news
conference. ``We can't afford an American president who fears taking
a moral position.''
   Bush has not made any statement since the defiance campaign began
several weeks ago with boycotts and demonstrations at segregated
public places. It was capped Wednesday with a general strike to
protest Wednesday's South African legislative elections, from which
blacks were excluded.
   At the White House, officials said Bush sent a letter several
weeks ago to Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a leading black South
African foe of apartheid. Tutu was tear-gassed by police and briefly
detained last week.
   The officials said the note expressed U.S. support for a
negotiated power-sharing agreement between blacks and whites.
   The State Department, meanwhile, criticized the South African
elections, with spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler saying the voting
``offers only part of the South African community a chance to voice
its views. The majority must be given an opportunity to peacefully
voice theirs.''
   Robinson called the State Department comments ``inadequate
utterances that give comfort to the South African government.''
   The only way to bring the South African government to the
negotiating table is to convince it that failing to do so would be
too costly, he said.
   The Bush administration is wrong to assume that acting President
F.W. de Klerk is more liberal than his predecessor, P.W. Botha,
Robinson said. De Klerk is ``smoother, brighter and better
educated'' but is ideologicallly just as segregationist, Robinson
added.
   The administration has invited De Klerk to visit the United
States and become the first South African leader on an official
visit in 30 years.

<HEAD>Report from Foot Soldiers in War Against Drugs: Bush Plan Not Enough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's pledge to fight drugs ``block by block, child by
child'' was a popular sound bite on newscasts Wednesday, but when
young people on one block were asked if the war on drugs could be
won, most were pessimistic.
   ``It's going to take a lot, because it's not just the students,
it's like everybody, you know, policemen, people like that, the big
people,'' said Yolanda Brown, 17, among students interviewed
Wednesday outside T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Va.,
about Bush's speech the night before.
   The students' skepticism was echoed by many of the rank-and-file
soldiers in the daily battle against drugs _ narcotics officers,
drug counselors and others who said Bush's $7.9 billion drug program
was simply not enough.
   Shane Berry, 17, another Williams student, was asked if he agreed
with Bush that people who look the other way when drugs are being
used are also responsible for the problem.
   ``You couldn't really say that, because you can't go telling on
your friends, especially if it's just something like pot or
something,'' he said. ``But crack, and cocaine, or heroin, I would
tell on my friend, because I know that could kill you the first
time.''
   In Philadelphia, Allen Dobson, 21, an admitted former drug
dealer, watched the Bush speech with his parents, Vera and William,
both recovering drug addicts.
   ``I know a lot of people don't want to hear this, but it's too
late for a whole generation of us. The bottom line is that we have
wasted lives, people from 17 to 25. Get the babies and start talking
to them now.''
   His mother disagreed, noting that she was 35 when she got help
and has remained drug-free for 22 years.
   Dobson said he quit selling drugs three years ago and sometimes
regrets the money and power he lost. ``It's hard for me to face the
fact that I'm broke.''
   The chairman of the Chicago Housing Authority, Vince Lane, said
on ``CBS This Morning'' that the president had taken an important
step by throwing down the gauntlet.
   ``I was surprised to hear that we did get $50 million allocated
to public housing. ... With about $30 million here in Chicago I can
clean up every troubled high rise in the city. So the money will be
very much appreciated.''
   Capt. Mike Smith, head of the narcotics division in the Harris
County Sheriff's Department in Houston, said of the president's
speech:
   ``The whole court system is already swamped. It would take more
money than he's talking about. Unless those people are locked up in
maximum security, they're not going to quit. We keep arresting them,
and all we're going is training them in the school of hard knocks.''
   The campaign that has made smoking socially unacceptable is the
type needed to turn people against drugs, suggested Michael
Sylvester, a narcotics sergeant with the Little Rock police.
   While law enforcement officials said more money was needed to
bust drug dealers and keep them behind bars, volunteers in treatment
centers said dollars spent on breaking the addiction would be more
effective in the long run in solving the drug problem.
   ``The state of Oklahoma has no resources to battle drug abuse.
Most state programs are primarily to treat alcoholics or marijuana.
We are the only one statewide to treat and rehabilitate drug
addicts,'' said Larry Carnes, head of the Life Improvement Center in
Oklahoma City.
   He said 120 people were in the center's methadone treatment
program. ``And that's not even the tip of the iceberg; it's just an
ice cube. Our program is 98 percent white. We haven't even begun to
impact the black population.''
   Bob Halford, executive director of the Metro Atlanta Council on
Alcohol and Drugs, said he was disappointed that Bush didn't commit
more money to treatment and drug education.
   ``I believe we could put all the military, all the enforcement
people in this country and line them up and down the shores ... and
I still think people would figure out a way to get drugs into this
country if they wanted them,'' he said. ``Somehow we've got to do
something from the demand side. If we don't get in the mode of
putting money into prevention programs, I think we're dead in the
water.''

<HEAD>Bush Says Critics Should Quit `Carping' About Drug Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Wednesday that skeptics of
his $7.9 billion drug war were just ``carping'' and should ``stop
criticizing for partisan reasons.''
   Democrats, meanwhile, said the government would have to raise
more revenue to mount an all-out fight against illegal drugs but
conceded it would be impossible to enact a tax increase for that
purpose as long as Bush opposes it.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, said, ``Unless the president supports the tax
increases that will be necessary to fight this war, the drug dealers
are going to win.''
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said, ``Without the
administration's support, the idea of raising taxes is futile.''
   Bush emphatically rejected the notion of higher taxes. ``Every
time you make a proposal,'' he said, ``you have somebody jump up and
say, `Raise taxes.' I am not in a mode to raise taxes.''
   Less than 24 hours after declaring a new war on drugs, Bush and
his critics sparred from a distance _ in speeches, on television
shows, and meetings with the press.
   Putting a human touch on the drug problem, Bush visited a public
hospital ward to see babies abandoned by addicted mothers. Wearing a
blue smock, Bush quieted one 4{-month-old baby boy by cradling him
against his shoulder.
   ``You see these kids and you want to try harder,'' Bush told
reporters later.
   The president's program emphasizes a crackdown on drug users and
proposes more money for treatment centers, law enforcement and
prison cells, as well as funds to attack drugs at their source in
Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. It would require a $716 million increase
in 1990 above the programs already in the budget.
   To meet the increased costs, Bush proposed diverting money from
elsewhere in government _ by abolishing the Economic Development
Administration and by cutting funds from juvenile justice programs,
public housing and other areas.
   Asked about Democrats' criticism that his plan is inadequately
funded and doesn't go far enough, Bush said, ``My response is,
they're wrong.''
   While digging in his heels against higher taxes, Bush signaled he
was open-minded about possible changes in his program.
   ``It's a good plan,'' he said. ``If people would stop just
criticizing for partisan reasons and get behind the program, and
then if there's something additional we should do, then let's do
it,'' Bush said.
   He said his program represented a $2 billion increase above a
drug program being considered in the House. Taking aim at his
critics, Bush said, ``They're carping (with) those partisan
comments,'' he said.
   ``Now, if somebody has a real sincere belief that you need more
in treatment and less in something, of course, the process will work
this out.''
   ``I've listened carefully,'' Bush said at a news conference.
``There has been little, if any, substantive criticism about this
national strategy.''
   Bush was asked anew about sending American troops to Colombia to
help fight the drug barons there.
   He said he did not want to raise ``the old timeworn specter of
American military intervention in Colombia.'' On the other hand, he
said, if troops are requested by President Virgilio Barco, ``we'd
take a very different look at this.''
   On Capitol Hill, Foley rejected any suggestion that Democrats are
guilty of partisanship.
   ``I don't think the history of this issue has been a partisan
issue,'' he said.
   Foley said anti-drug bills were enacted with bipartisan support
in 1986 and 1988. But he also said ``the administration frustrated''
efforts by Democrats to immediately increase anti-drug spending.
   A Democratic-controlled appropriations panel earlier this year
sought to boost anti-drug spending by $821 million for the current
fiscal year, but the figure was cut to $75 million after the
administration argued that federal agencies had all the money they
could spend for now.
   Foley predicted that Congress would add ``at least the amount the
president recommended'' this year, and ``next year, I expect we will
be offering more than the president's proposal.''
   Bush also snapped at Democratic critics during a meeting attended
by law enforcement officials, prosecutors and anti-drug
professionals and by about 30 ambassadors, including those from many
Latin American countries.
   While apologizing for getting ``down into the trenches of
domestic politics'' with the foreign diplomats present, Bush said,
``I couldn't help but notice that the minute I finished speaking,
there was the predictable response by some that we haven't done
enough.''
   ``Nobody expected that the members of the United States Congress,
particularly from the other party, would stamp this
enthusiastically,'' Bush declared.
   He also told the ambassadors: ``This really is a war the United
States cannot fight alone. We need to enlist the resources of other
nations in this battle.''
   Looking directly at Colombian Ambassador Victor Mosquera, who was
seated in the front row, Bush reiterated his decision not to send
U.S. troops there.
   ``I will not and should not unilaterally impose United States
troops into another sovereign country. And I don't care what the
emotions are,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>Astronauts Say Next Shuttle Mission Safe Despite Nuclear-Powered
Payload</HEAD>

   Five space shuttle astronauts said
Wednesday they will feel perfectly safe riding into space next month
with a planetary payload powered by two nuclear generators.
   ``I have absolutely no qualms about the devices,'' said Don
Williams, who will command the Atlantis mission that is to dispatch
the Galileo spacecraft to orbit Jupiter. ``There are some vocal
groups who feel there's a problem, but I feel they are entirely
safe.''
   Pilot Mike McCulley was more blunt: ``I can't imagine how it can
hurt anyone unless it hits him on the head, and that's pretty
remote. I think it is a complete non-issue except as a philosophical
issue to some people.''
   Galileo will be powered by a pair of 122-pound radioisotope
thermoelectric generators (RTGs), each containing about 24 pounds of
highly toxic plutonium-238 dioxide. Instruments called thermocouples
convert the heat released by the plutonium's decay into electricity.
   They are the only known devices that can power a spacecraft
traveling deep into the solar system far from the sun. Similar RTGs
provided power to the Voyager 2 probe that last month relayed
stunning photos from Neptune.
   The United States has launched 22 nuclear-powered spacecraft
since 1961, with all the plutonium packages encased in superhardened
material designed to survive the worst possible fire or explosion.
None resulted in the release of radioactive material, even though
one package was aboard a rocket that exploded and two survived
flaming re-entries through Earth's atmosphere after accidents.
   Some anti-nuclear and environmental groups have protested the use
of plutonium aboard Atlantis, citing the 1986 space shuttle
Challenger explosion as an example of how things can go wrong. They
contend a similar explosion could result in radioactive
contamination of the Cape Canaveral area and a subsequent increase
in cancer illnesses and death.
   Because of the nuclear material aboard, the White House has to
approve the mission, and a decision is expected within a few days.
   The opposing groups have said that if approval is given they
would seek a court order to block the launch, now scheduled for Oct.
12.
   NASA estimates the odds of another shuttle disaster at somewhere
between 1-in-80 and 1-in-800.
   The agency said an exhaustive post-Challenger safety review
indicates the chances of a launch accident in which substantial
quantities of plutonium, pulverized to breathable form, could be
released is about 1-in-2,700. And even then, NASA said, any
contamination would be minor.
   The five astronauts who will fly the Galileo mission were asked
about the potential danger at a news conference and in individual
interviews Wednesday.
   ``Testing shows that they are built to last and withstand about
anything you can imagine,'' said mission specialist Ellen Baker.
``Everyone I love will be at the launch, and I feel they will be
perfectly safe.''
   She noted that ``some environmental groups knowledgeable about
the RTGs have given their seal of approval on this.''
   ``NASA and the Department of Energy have done an excellent job
with the safeguards,'' said mission specialist Shannon Lucid.
   ``If the president doesn't sign off on the RTGs, I would be very
disappointed,'' said Franklin Chang-Diaz, another mission
specialist. ``We would have taken a step backward in space.
   ``Without RTGs we wouldn't have had those wonderful images from
Neptune or other planets, and the Galileo mission would not be
possible,'' he said.
   Once released from Atlantis, Galileo will embark on a six-year
journey to Jupiter. Once there it will fire a scientific probe into
the Jovian atmosphere and orbit the planet for 22 months of
extensive exploration.

<TEXT>
   Here are some facts and figures
on Wednesday's parliamentary elections in South Africa, where the
governing National Party faced its toughest challenge from white
opposition parties on the left and far right.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   WHAT WAS AT STAKE:
   A total of 763 candidates contested 166 seats in Parliament's
dominant white chamber, 80 seats in the chamber for people of
mixed-race, and 40 seats in the chamber for Indians. The two junior
chambers have no power to overrule the white chamber on matters of
national policy.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   WHO COULD VOTE:
   According to government figures, 3,170,667 of the country's 5
million whites were registered to vote, as were 1,775,751 of the
roughly 3 million mixed-race people and 665,870 of the estimated 1
million Indians.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   WHO COULD NOT VOTE:
   None of South Africa's 28 million blacks was allowed to vote in
national elections. They can vote only for municipal officials and
for the administrations of the country's 10 tribal homelands.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   KEY COMPETITORS:
   Because the Indian and mixed-race chambers have little power,
most attention focused on the white House of Assembly, where the
National Party held 123 of the 166 elected seats. It faced strong
challenges from the far-right Conservative Party, which held 22
seats, and the anti-apartheid Democratic Party, which controlled 20
seats. One seat was held by a now-defunct moderate party.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   WHERE THEY STAND:
   The Conservatives favor a strengthening of segregation laws and
oppose political rights for blacks. The Democrats favor abolishing
all segregation laws and granting universal political rights, with
some provisions for ensuring that whites and other minority groups
have a voice in government decisions. The National Party has
proposed a five-year plan for bringing blacks into the political
system on a limited basis. It wants to ensure that blacks cannot
overrule white interests, and it wants to maintain segregated
schools and neighborhoods for whites who want them.

   Critics mounted a last-minute challenge
Wednesday to legislation aimed at assuring the nation's 37 million
disabled the same protections minorities were given a quarter of a
century ago.
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of
Independent Business spelled out their disagreements with the
Americans With Disabilities Act in a joint news conference held as
the Senate neared consideration of the measure.
   They were pushing for amendments aimed at removing alcohol and
drug addicts from coverage under the act, lowering the penalties for
violations and exempting the smallest of businesses from lawsuits by
customers, clients and visitors.
   Students at Washington's Gallaudet University for the deaf, known
for an activist spirit that forced a change of its administration,
rallied to support the bill, gathering in front of the Capitol
before fanning out to lobby their homestate senators.
   The students support provisions requiring phone companies to
provide telecommunications services for the deaf, and at no higher
cost than regular service.
   Critics of the act say the cost of compliance _ including
modifying movie theaters, buses and restaurants to accommodate the
disabled _ is beyond estimation.
   The act would prevent against job discrimination because of
handicaps, a ban on discrimination in public accommodations,
including buses and restaurants, and enforcement through the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.
   Not only alcohol and drug addiction, but also affliction with
AIDS _ acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ would be considered a
disability.
   The measure had wide sponsorship in the Senate and cleared the
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee last month by a unanimous
vote. A House measure has been introduced but has yet to receive
hearings in any of the four committees that have jurisdiction over
it.
   The White House has also voiced support for the bill, saying it
uses ``reasonable measures, phased in over time.''
   Co-sponsor Tom Harkin, D-Iowa., speaking to 70 Gallaudet
students, likened the position of the disabled to that of blacks and
women before the landmark Civil Rights Act.
   ``You know before 1964 if you were black, or a woman or maybe
even Jewish, if you went into a place of business, they could throw
you out or not hire you ... But today, 25 years later, it is still
legal in this country to discriminate on the basis of handicap,'' he
said.
   I. King Jordan, president of the deaf university, pointed to
other landmark legislation from which the disabled are excluded. He
said that the 8 million to 9 million hearing- or speech-impaired
Americans have yet to benefit from the ``fleet interstate telephone
system'' created by the Communications Act of 1934.
   At the news conference, Chamber of Commerce attorney Nancy Fulco
said the requirement of ``reasonable access'' is too vague to be
defined anywhere but in court.
   ``Through its lack of fundamental guidelines and parameters for
businesses, along with its vague language, the measure promotes
lawsuits as a way of handling disputes between employers and the
disabled,'' she said.
   She said it will take the courts 20 years to resolve the
questions.
   ``This bill, as written, is a lopsided piece of legislation
loaded with traps and pitfalls that will be almost unavoidable by
small businesses. ...,'' said John Sloan, president of the
570,000-member National Federation of Independent Business. ``The
ADA bill would impose costly requirements on businesses and provide
for unlimited damage awards.''
   The federation said it could live with the bill if drug and
alcohol addicts were eliminated from protection; the maximum penalty
for the first violations reduced to $1,000 and $5,000 instead of
$50,000 and $100,000 and businesses with 15 or fewer employees were
exempted from lawsuits by customers, visitors and clients alleging
discrimination under the act.

   During the 25 minutes it took President Bush to
announce his $7.9 billion anti-drug plan, three people were arrested
for cocaine in Roxbury's drug-infested neighborhood and two men were
shot.
   ``It won't make any difference down here,'' said 21-year-old E.Z.
Ty, who interrupted a conversation on a dingy corner of Blue Hill
Avenue to say he sells crack and show off the chrome-plated revolver
in his waistband.
   ``Drugs is very heavy down here. And you know why? McDonald's
doesn't pay anything. Cocaine is here to stay. It's not going
anywhere.''
   Michael Williams, 25, was sitting on the steps of his apartment
building with three friends about 9:20 p.m. when a man came up,
cocked a pistol and opened fire. Police said the motive was unclear,
but like most violence in Roxbury, it was probably drug-related.
Williams was listed in stable condition Wednesday at Boston City
Hospital. A second man was hit in the incident by a ricochetting
bullet, but was not hospitalized.
   On Blue Hill Avenue, a desolate string of vacant lots and boarded
up storefronts through the heart of Roxbury, two members of the
Humboldt Raiders Gang said Bush's plan was pointless.
   ``I think it's crazy,'' said 18-year-old Huckleberry Ross, who
wore a fancy sweatsuit and heavy gold medallions. ``They ought to go
right to Colombia and do something. It won't do any good to get rid
of it here. You won't keep the gangs from selling it.''
   Ross' friend and fellow gang member, Tyrone Stevens, 19, said the
Bush administration should provide more educational opportunities.
   ``They say they're going to spend money to fight drugs, but at
the same time they're taking money out of our public schools,'' said
Stevens, referring to the recent closure of several Boston schools.
``We can't get no education so we all do what we know best _ try and
make money off drugs.''
   Billy Bush, 37, who sat in a cluster of men outside a corner
convenience store about a mile down the street from the gang
members, said he uses cocaine and heroin.
   ``There ain't nothing he can do about the ghetto,'' Billy Bush
said of the president. Billy Bush said he works sometimes as a
sandblaster. ``He can't win. There's 10 times more crack down here
than heroin. They stopped heroin a little bit but they'll never stop
crack.''
   Billy Bush gestured to a young woman standing on a nearby street
corner waving at cars. ``See, women in the ghetto are selling
themselves for base,'' he said.
   The conversation ended abruptly when a man, who appeared to be
under the influence of drugs and smelled of alcohol, approached and
tussled with an Associated Press photographer, tearing her strobe
light from her grasp and fleeing.

   NATO plans to propose limits on military
maneuvers by Western and Soviet armed forces in Europe, the first
time the alliance has suggested non-nuclear military constraints,
NATO officials and diplomats said Wednesday.
   Negotiators for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will
likely offer detailed plans for restricting military activities
during the third round of negotiations aimed at reducing non-nuclear
arms in Europe, said an alliance official, who demanded anonymity.
   The talks begin in Vienna on Thursday.
   The discussions between the 16 NATO nations and the seven Warsaw
Pact countries began in early March to cut troops, tanks, combat
aircraft and helicopters, and armored personnel carriers. The
bargaining covers an area spanning the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural
Mountains in the Soviet Union.
   The negotiations are designed to produce a treaty setting equal
ceilings on NATO and Warsaw Pact tanks, artillery, armored troop
carriers, aircraft, helicopters and possibly manpower.
   President Bush said in June he wanted to complete the agreement
within a year, but the two alliances have not agreed on a number of
basic issues, including measures to verify how an agreement would be
kept.
   The latest NATO proposals mark ``the first time Western countries
are planning to introduce military constraints,'' said a NATO
official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``Major military activities should be cut, like maneuvers,'' he
said.
   The proposals would set a threshold limiting the size of these
exercises to several tens of thousands of soldiers or several
hundreds of battle tanks, he said. One maneuver exceeding the limit
could be held every two years.
   Also, officials were working on details of proposals for
exchanging information on force structures and verifying compliance
with a treaty.
   In Vienna, a Western diplomat demanding anonymity said ``some
tough issues'' remain to be resolved on verification.
   He specifically mentioned divisions between countries like the
United States and Canada, which want maximum surveillance, and
European nations, which are concerned about constant visits by
Soviet-bloc military personnel.
   The Europeans, he explained, ``say, `I don't want to live with
Soviet inspectors climbing in and out of my bases all the time.'''
   Another Western diplomat, who spoke on condition he not be
further identified, said he expected the verification proposals to
be presented during the current six-week session.
   The senior NATO official said the Western nations want to set up
ways to monitor in detail the arms cuts called for in the treaty.
   ``Once the reductions are achieved ... we want to have
confirmation by intrusive measures of compliance,'' he said.
   He said the allies want regular on-site inspections of places
where equipment targeted in the treaty would be located. ``Each
participant is liable to receive on its territory an agreed quota of
such inspections,'' he said.
   A separate package of proposals, he said, would cover the
exchange of information between the East and West on the command
structure of their ground and air forces.
   It also would give the locations of units singled out for
reductions, storage depots and armored vehicle launched bridges.
   NATO has proposed both sides be limited to no more than 5,700
combat aircraft and 1,900 combat helicopters each. No country could
have more than 3,420 combat aircraft and 1,140 combat helicopters.
   Other suggested limits are 20,000 tanks, 16,500 artillery pieces
and 28,000 armored troop carriers for each alliance.
   It has also proposed allowing the United States and the Soviet
Union to station no more than 275,000 troops in Europe, outside of
their national territories.
   This would amount to a 20 percent cut in U.S. combat troops in
Europe, reducing overall U.S. troop strength by about 10 percent.
There are about 150,000 U.S. combat troops in Europe and more than
150,000 support personnel.
   The Soviets have an estimated 625,000 troops in Eastern and
Central Europe. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has already offered
to cut to 350,000 and has proposed equal ceilings of NATO and Warsaw
Pact forces of 1.35 million.

<TEXT>
   Reputed drug kingpin Francesco Gambino and
four associates have been convicted for their roles in a
Sicilian-based network that imported and sold millions of dollars
worth of heroin between 1984 and 1988.
   Gambino, 48, of New York City, was found guilty Tuesday by a
federal jury on charges of conspiring to smuggle and distribute
heroin. Gambino and his co-defendants face up to 30 years in prison.
No sentencing date was set.
   Also convicted were Ignazio Antonino Mannino, on charges of
conspiring to import and distribute heroin; Emanuele Salvatore
Mannino and Grace Pulitano Mannino, both on the two conspiracy
charges and a charge of money laundering; and Enzo Varisco, on a
charge of conspiring to distribute more than five kilograms of
cocaine.
   One defendant, Carlo Fodera, was found innocent. Varisco was
found innocent of conspiring to distribute heroin.
   District Judge Louis C. Bechtle revoked Gambino's bail and
ordered him taken into custody. Gambino had been confined to his
house, wearing a security bracelet and having his telephone calls
monitored.
   His attorney, David Breitbart, said the conviction would be
appealed. He contended during the trial his client had been targeted
because authorities mistakenly believed he was related to the late
New York mob boss Carlo Gambino.
   Authorities have said 68 people were charged in the United States
and 133 in Italy after a three-year FBI undercover operation in
which agents traveled to Italy and posed as interested buyers who
discussed making major drug buys.

<HEAD>Army Generals Resign to Allow Pinochet to Reorganize High Command</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All 47 army generals handed in their
resignations Wednesday to allow the president and army commander,
Augusto Pinochet, to reorganize the high command, the government
said.
   The resignations came at the end of a four-hour annual meeting of
the Army Qualification Board headed by Pinochet, according to a
brief statement from the presidential press office.
   Every year, the board meets to decide promotions and new
assignments within the army high command. Pinochet makes the final
decision.
   Wednesday was the first time all the generals resigned.
   They are giving Pinochet ``freedom of action'' to decide on
changes, the government statement said without elaborating.
   Press reports in recent days indicated this year's army
reorganization would be more far-reaching than in recent years in
anticipation of the end of 16 years of military rule and the
generals' move from politics to the barracks.
   Chileans vote Dec. 14 on a successor to Pinochet. The new
president is to take office March 11.
   Pinochet, who seized power in a bloody 1973 military coup, was
forced to call the election after voters in an October national
referendum rejected a military proposal to extend his rule until
1997.
   Patricio Aylwin, 70, a moderate former senate president and
candidate of a 17-party opposition coalition, is widely favored to
win the election.
   Government sources say changes in the army will include cutting
the number of generals from 47 to 38, not including Pinochet. One
reason for the reduction is because the army no longer will assign
senior officers to government posts, the sources say.
   Under the constitution, Pinochet, 73, can remain army commander
after he steps down from the presidency, and he has said he intends
to do so despite opposition from dissidents and even some of his own
supporters.
   The government did not say when Pinochet will announce his
reshuffle of the high command, normally announced in October.

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international panel of experts Wednesday
concluded public hearings on the role of multinationals in South
Africa and said they expect to make an ``extraordinarily tough''
report to the United Nations.
   Canaan Banana, co-chairman of the U.N.-appointed panel examining
the role of multinational corporations in South Africa, said
parliamentary elections Wednesday would lead to little change in the
country.
   Lowell Weicker, a former U.S. senator and panel member, urged the
United Nations to increase pressure on the South African government
to end its policy of apartheid, which denies the black majority a
voice in national affairs.
   The panel's report to the United Nations will aim for greater
compliance with internationally agreed upon economic sanctions,
especially regarding withdrawing investment from South Africa,
Weicker said.
   ``I expect this report to be extraordinarily tough,'' he told a
press conference.
   Banana, who was the first president of Zimbabwe, said one of the
central themes in the report would be the tightening of financial
sanctions.
   This would particularly concern the rescheduling of loans to the
country, he said. He refused to give further details.
   South Africa has a foreign debt of $22 billion, according to U.N.
figures. Half of this is covered by an agreement with creditor banks
that is due for renegotiation in 1990.
   Banana said sanctions are the most effective way of weakening
South Africa's economy so that it cannot afford to maintain
apartheid.
   South African and multinational business leaders Tuesday said
further sanctions would hit the black population hardest and
increase the conservative backlash against change.
   The panel heard testimony from groups including the African
National Congress, the largest South African guerrilla group, and
the World Council of Churches, which repeated calls for mandatory
and comprehensive sanctions.
   The 11 experts, mainly former leading public officials, held
three days of public hearings. Their report, to be published by the
end of the week, will be discussed by the U.N. General Assembly in
New York.

<HEAD>House Committee Hears Problems of Subsidized Housing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is unrealistic to simply prohibit the owners
of federally subsidized housing from converting their buildings to
private rental units or taking them condo, a housing consultant told
a House panel Wednesday.
   ``You're just buying yourself a problem if you do that,'' Emily
Achtenberg of Boston told Rep. Joseph P, Kennedy II, D-Mass.
   Responding to a question from the congressman, Ms. Achtenberg
acknowledged that extension of a two-year ban on such conversions
would save money in the short-range.
   ``In the long-run it is not a solution,'' said Ms. Achtenberg,
who works with non-profit, low-income tenant groups to help them
preserve their homes _ either by buying the buildings themselves or
working out new rental subsidy agreements.
   Because of the 1986 tax revisions that removed certain tax breaks
for rental investment property, Ms. Achtenberg said many owners of
subsidized low-income rental properties are ``paying taxes on income
they're not actually receiving.''
   Given that situation, she said, it is not reasonable to expect
the owners to maintain the low-income units beyond the time they are
legally required to do so.
   Hundreds of thousands of low-income rental units were constructed
in the 1960s under a program that provided tax and other financing
incentives for private developers _ but also gave them the option to
pay off their subsidized mortgages after 20 years and making their
properties private.
   Many of those 20-year arrangements are eligible for conversion
and Ms. Achtenberg said the logical way for Congress to proceed is
to arrange ``a graceful exit'' for owners who want out rather than
try to keep them in economically unfeasible arrangements.
   For one thing, she said, owners in a money-losing arrangement
would not maintain the properties, leading to an even worse
situation in the future.
   Although the housing and community development subcommittee that
conducted the hearing is responsible for housing policy legislation,
several members noted that the appropriations committee ultimately
would have to come up with the money to pay for whatever solution is
suggested.
   Kennedy noted that ``back of the envelope'' estimates have raised
the possibility it would cost about $7.5 billion in federal money to
reserve for low-income renters the units facing conversion to the
private market.
   Rep. Bruce F. Vento, D-Minn., asked the panel of advocates for
low-income rental groups whether many owners threatening conversion
might be ``bluffing'' in an effort to extract more federal
assistance.
   Sara Johnson, president of the National Housing Trust, said such
bluffs are not a significant factor because some of the owners
really are in a losing financial situation because of new tax laws
and that others ``are just fed up and want to get out'' of the
subsidized housing business.

   Youngsters who are home alone after school for 11
or more hours a week on a regular basis are twice as likely to abuse
alcohol, tobacco and marijuana as children who aren't ``latchkey
kids,'' a new report says.
   The study, analyzing data on almost 5,000 eighth-graders in the
Los Angeles and San Diego areas, found that higher risks of
substance abuse occurred in two-parent as well as single-parent
households and in affluent as well as poor homes.
   The substance abuse showed up regardless of sports and church
involvment, watching television after school or spending time with
friends, said the study, published in this month's issue of
Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, based
in suburban Elk Grove Village.
   Adolescents who turn to alcohol, cigarettes and marijuana may be
``manifesting a desire to display their sense of maturity and
independence,'' said the study, led by Jean Richardson of the
University of Southern California School of Medicine in Los Angeles.
   She and her colleagues suggested that the relationship between
self-care and substance abuse may be partly due to the tendency to
take risks that can result from being alone, having friends who
smoke or being in situations where cigarettes are offered.
   Lillian M. Beard, a Washington, D.C., pediatrician, said in a
telephone interview Wednesday that the findings were not surprising,
``because young people ... whose energies are not directed,
particularly during early adolescence, are at greater risk for not
only substance abuse but all kinds of risk-taking behavior,''
including truancy, shoplifting and even joinging gangs.
   Loraine Stern, a Los Angeles-area pediatrician and a member of
the academy's communications committee, said, ``There is something
intangible, especially during the adolescent years, about having an
anchor.
   ``And there's no doubt in my mind, from experience and
philosophically, that latchkey children are at greater risk not only
for substance abuse but for emotional difficulties,'' she said in a
telephone interview Wednesday.
   The study's findings support several recent articles that suggest
some types of problem behavior among early adolescents can be
linked, at least partly, to large amounts of time spent without
adult supervision, particularly after school, the authors said.
   Researchers collected data by questionnaires given to 4,932
youngsters in 47 public schools, and validated the findings with
data from 2,185 parents of the youngsters. All data were collected
in February 1987.
   The researchers found that students in self-care for 11 or more
hours per week after school were twice as likely to have consumed a
high level of alcohol, 2.1 times more likely to have a high
cigarette consumption and 1.7 times more likely to have smoked
marijuana than children who had adult supervision.
   High alcohol consumption was defined as 11 or more drinks in
one's life, and high cigarette consumption was defined as one or
more packs smoked.
   The researchers said the number of U.S. latchkey children _ now
estimated at 2 million to 6 million _ is likely to rise, due to the
increase in the number of dual-career and single-parent families and
the decrease in traditional extended family arrangements.
   They suggested developing more alternatives to self-care,
including after-school programs at schools, libraries, recreation
centers, churches or other locations.

   Police broke up an international
narcotics ring that imported drugs in cans labeled as fruit and
tripe, and 10 people were arrested, news reports said Wednesday.
   Authorities also seized 440 pounds of cocaine, the reports said.
That amount of drugs would have a street value of about $50 million
in Portugal.
   Police arrested five Spaniards, three Portuguese, one Colombian,
and a Cuban-born American, according to the Portuguese news agency
Lusa. It did not identify them.
   It said they were suspected of importing drugs by ship from
Colombia and Equador, Lusa said.
   No police spokesman was available to comment, and the reports did
not say when or where the arrests and seizures were made.
   The drugs marked as fruit and tripe were destined for other
European countries, Lusa said.
   Police also seized six cars and $78,000, Lusa said.

   A Soviet spokesman Wednesday declared support for a
U.S. campaign to combat international drug trafficking but said
American troops should not be sent to other countries to do it.
   ``It's one thing for states to join efforts for a mutual fight
against narcotics,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim P.
Perfiliev. ``It's another to send military regiments to another
country.''
   Perfiliev's remarks at a government news briefing came the day
after President Bush announced a $7.9 billion plan to fight drug
sales and use.
   The United States has already given military hardware to the
government of Colombia, center of the world cocaine trade, to help
fight drug trafficking.
   Bush also said he was ready to ``make available the appropriate
resources of America's armed forces'' to other countries to help cut
drug production.
   Without referring directly to Bush's proposals, Perfiliev
expressed Soviet backing for U.S. and Colombian efforts to fight the
drug business.
   ``However, it's impossible not to note that there are attempts to
send American armed forces to that country,'' he said. ``Such an
action would be nothing less than an intervention into the internal
affairs of another state.''

   Former Communist Party leader Bosko
Krunic has been stripped of his party membership after being accused
of separatist leanings, an official report said Wednesday.
   Krunic was ousted along with three other Communist leaders from
Vojvodina, a province in the Serbian republic, the state news agency
Tanjug said. All were accused of showing separatist tendencies.
   Under its populist leader Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia has
strengthened its control over its nominally autonomous provinces of
Vojvodina and Kosovo.
   Kosovo is dominated by an ethnic Albanian majority that resisted
the changes in riots that left 24 dead last spring.
   Communists allied with Milosevic took over the Vojvodina
organization after mass demonstrations in the province's capital,
Novi Sad, a year ago.
   Krunic, 59, was one of several Old Guard politicians who stepped
down in the national party elite in the past year during an official
drive to rejuvenate the leadership.
   He held the annually rotating presidency of the League of
Communists in 1987.
   Krunic was also member of the 23-man ruling presidium, or
Politburo, of the party until last year.

   Here is a brief chronology of U.S.
involvement in Lebanon.
   July 15, 1958: President Dwight Eisenhower sends U.S. Marines to
Beirut at the request of Christian President Camille Chamoun to
quell an uprising by Chamoun's rivals. However, the Marines never
took part in any fighting, and they were quietly withdrawn soon
afterward.
   Aug. 25, 1982: Following Israel's June 1982 invasion, 800 U.S.
Marines, part of a 5,400-man peacekeeping force with British, French
and Italian units, go ashore to oversee the evacuation of Israeli,
Syrian and PLO forces from Beirut. The U.S. force was later
increased to 1,800 men.
   April 19, 1983: A Shiite Moslem suicide bomber rams an
explosives-packed van into the seaside U.S. Embassy in west Beirut,
killing 63 people, including 17 Americans.
   Oct. 23, 1983: A Shiite suicide bomber attacks the U.S. Marine
base near Beirut airport, killing 241 men. Another suicide bomber
hits a French paratroopers' base, killing 58 men.
   Dec. 5, 1983: U.S. Navy fighter-bombers attack Syrian missile and
artillery batteries in Lebanon, inflicting ``significant damage,''
after reconnaissance planes are fired on.
   Dec. 14, 1983: The battleship USS New Jersey bombards Moslem
positions with 250 shells from its 16-inch guns as the situation
deteriorates.
   Feb. 26, 1984: As Lebanon's civil war breaks out again, the
Marines are pulled back to U.S. warships off Beirut, beginning the
final withdrawal after an ill-fated 22-month peacekeping operation
in which 264 U.S. servicemen were killed.
   Sept. 20, 1984: Suicide bomber hits U.S. Embassy annex in north
Beirut, killing 12 people and wounding 96, including the U.S.
ambassador.
   March 16, 1985: Four armed kidnappers drag Terry Anderson, the
chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, from his
car in Beirut. He is the longest held of 16 foreign hostages in
Lebanon, eight of them Americans.
   Sept. 6, 1989: Staff of U.S. Embassy evacuates after hundreds of
Christian protesters besiege the facility to demand that the United
States help the Christians in their 6-month-old battle with Syrian
forces.

<HEAD>Defense Lawyers Say Reagan Told Poindexter to Answer Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan directed his national security
adviser, John Poindexter, to give responses to congressional
inquiries that led to Poindexter's indictment in the Iran-Contra
scandal, Poindexter's lawyers said Wednesday.
   At a court hearing, Frederick Robinson said prosecutors should be
ordered to request Reagan's notes of various meetings so that they
can be turned over as part of Poindexter's defense.
   Notes from then-Vice President George Bush should be turned over
for Poindexter's review, Robinson said, as well as notes from former
White House Chief of Staff Don Regan and then-Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger.
   Poindexter's lawyers assert that all of Poindexter's actions were
approved by higher-ups in the Reagan administration and that ``a lot
of people took notes,'' Robinson told U.S. District Judge Harold
Greene.
   He said the defense needs those notes ``so that we can ... test
their credibility'' if the notes' authors are called as witnesses at
Poindexter's trial.
   Robinson referred to numerous statements by Bush and others that
the then-vice president wasn't present at key Cabinet-level meetings
in the Iran-Contra affair. But ``any time he missed a meeting,
Admiral Poindexter briefed him'' afterwards, Poindexter's lawyer
said of Bush.
   Robinson focused on what he said was a meeting in mid-1986
between Reagan and Poindexter. It related to questions from House
committees asking whether the administration was assisting the
Nicaraguan Contras during a congressional ban on military aid to the
rebel force.
   One of the charges against Poindexter is that he obstructed
Congress in sending responses to Congress in July 1986 that referred
to letters sent a year earlier by his predecessor, Robert McFarlane.
   McFarlane's letters denied that North and the National Security
Council staff were supplying military advice or raising funds for
the rebel force.
   McFarlane subsequently pleaded guilty to withholding statements
from Congress in connection with the letters.
   The indictment against Poindexter says he ``well knew and
believed'' McFarlane's 1985 letters ``were false.''
   Poindexter ``went to the president to talk about'' the
congressional responses, Robinson told the judge.
   Greene asked Robinson whether he was suggesting that ``the
president said, `You go ahead and do this.'''
   ``Yes,'' said Robinson. The lawyer asserted that Reagan said in
effect, ``I want these things done.''
   ``I think that the president's notes ... will show his
discussions about the letters that were sent to Congress and the
appropriateness of any response,'' Robinson added. He said the
meeting would show ``presidential approval and ratification of that
activity.''
   Poindexter wants the judge to direct the office of independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh to request some of Reagan's notes so that
they can be turned over to the former national security adviser.
   Christian Mixter, a lawyer for the prosecution in the Poindexter
case, noted that in the Iran-Contra criminal case against Oliver
North, ``we were quite willing to make requests of the president
ourselves'' to obtain typewritten excerpts of Reagan's diaries.
   But Mixter noted that was a case of ``voluntary compliance'' and
that when North's lawyers subpoenaed Reagan, the Justice Department
asked to be heard on the question of executive privilege. U.S.
District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell quashed the subpoena for Reagan
at the North trial.
   ``I believe the independent counsel is not obligated to provide
materials from the former president,'' said Mixter.
   Poindexter's lawyer responded that White House lawyers ``have
directed us back to the independent counsel'' on requests for
documents from the Reagan administration.
   Poindexter is charged in the Iran-Contra scandal with conspiracy,
two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of making false
statements.

<HEAD>Post Office Will No Longer Accept $100 Bills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Florida's post offices will no longer accept
$100 bills because 93 fake ones were unwittingly accepted by Miami
postal workers in three days last week.
   ``In the one-year period just before this, only 120 counterfeit
bills of all denominations were passed at the postal offices,'' said
Karen Schultz, spokeswoman for the Miami division of the Postal
Service.
   Most of the phony bills were used to buy money orders, and
officials suspect one person is responsible. So far, no other post
office in the division has been hit by the counterfeiter, Schultz
said.
   Last year, $1.9 million worth of counterfeit bills were passed in
the Miami area, said Secret Service special agent Allan Cramer. That
puts Miami ahead of $1.8 million passed in New York and $1.4 million
in Los Angeles.
   The Miami division of the Postal Service is considering buying
counterfeit detectors for its 155 offices in Broward, Palm Beach,
Dade, Monroe, Lee, Hendry and Collier counties, said Schultz.
   The detector machine, which costs $200 to $1,000, works on the
premise that an educated user will be able to see the magnetic or
fiber contents of genuine bills, said Paul Hackenberry, assistant
special agent in charge of the Secret Service's Miami office.
   But expert counterfeiters can fool the machine and its user, he
said.
   ``We do believe these bills were manufactured outside the United
States,'' Hackenberry said. ``The person was passing those bills by
using them at the post office. If (counterfeiters) go somewhere and
have a successful pass, they continue going to a place like it.''

   Second-grader Brandon Schlund had
the honor of ringing the bell and raising the flag when school
opened on this island in the Straits of Mackinac.
   He also was first down the slide at recess, first to answer the
math questions, first to finish lunch.
   Brandon is the only school-age child on Bois Blanc Island, where
school-for-one began Tuesday in the one-room Pines School.
   ``I like it fine,'' he said.
   Teacher Lani White said Brandon will do fine with his studies,
but he'll miss something by not having playmates.
   Clover Schlund agreed, even though she sees some humor in her
son's status. He'll have a problem with the teeter-totter, she noted.
   ``It bothers me, the social part,'' she said. ``Academically,
we've pretty well been guaranteed that he'll be the smartest kid in
school.''
   The island school had four students last year, but three moved.
In the last 35 years, the student body has never numbered more than
13.
   Island children attend the Pines school through the eighth grade.
For high school, they move in with friends or relatives in
Cheboygan, five miles across the water.
   The school has a budget of about $49,000, including $27,000 for
White's salary, said School Board President Judy Wriska. On the
average, other districts in Michigan spend less than $4,000 per
child.
   Up to 2,000 people summer on Bois Blanc, but the winter
population is fewer than 50.

   The secret to long life is to be
``born with a lot of vitality,'' says a woman who celebrated her
105th birthday with congratulations from more than 30 friends and
relatives.
   Sadie Purnell received a letter of congratulations from President
Bush and his wife, Barbara, and a citation from Gov. Edward D.
DiPrete at her party Tuesday, held one day after her birthday.
   ``How grand I am,'' she declared at the height of the party.
   Mrs. Purnell told stories of her childhood in Waterville, Maine,
where she was the oldest of 15 children. She told of playing hide
and seek on the banks of the Kennebec River, of wearing snowshoes to
a school run by Ursuline nuns, and of feasting on her mother's
pancakes.
   At 15, she began working as a weaver in the textile mills, where
she later met her husband, Francis, who died in 1963.
   Mrs. Purnell moved to South Kingstown about 2{ years ago to live
with Richard Purnell, one of her 10 grandchildren.
   Purnell said his grandmother has 17 great-grandchildren, 13
great-great-grandchildren and three great-great-great-grandchildren.

   Now that Congress has passed the savings and
loan rescue, it should consider changes in deposit insurance,
including a reduction in the $100,000 coverage limit, the chairman
of the House Banking Committee says.
   ``I believe it wouldn't hurt any to reduce it a few thousand
dollars. I think it'll make the stockholders and the depositors a
little bit more careful about what they're doing with their
institution,'' said Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas.
   The S&amp;L bill, signed into law Aug. 9 by President Bush, directs
the Treasury Department to finish a study of the deposit insurance
issue in 18 months. But Gonzalez says action may be needed sooner.
   ``They've had studies galore. ... The pressure on the deposit
insurance fund continues,'' he said in an interview Tuesday.
   The S&amp;L legislation provided taxpayer dollars to rescue failed
thrift institutions and shored up the commercial bank fund by nearly
doubling insurance premiums charged to banks, but Gonzalez said the
system is still vulnerable to ``unexpected but not unforeseen
events'' such as a dramatic deterioration of heavily indebted
corporations or Third World countries.
   Gonzalez said he wants to hear testimony on the issue before
making up his mind but said he currently favors reducing the maximum
insurance coverage from $100,000 and limiting the number of insured
accounts per depositor.
   However, proponents of the current system argue that it has
successfully prevented a recurrence of the wave of bank failures
that struck the nation in the Depression.
   And, they argue that reducing deposit insurance would favor large
banks over small ones. Depositors would shift their money to big
institutions, believing regulators would not close a big bank for
fear of the shock of a large failure to the financial system, they
say.
   Gonzalez said he also favors examining uninsured money market
mutual funds, which he called the ``loose cannon'' of the financial
system.
   ``It is a source of worry,'' he said. ``I'll guarantee you that
nine out of 10 people that have their money in those mutual money
markets, uninsured, don't know that they're not insured. ... That
has to be looked at.''
   Commercial banks hold about $2.4 trillion in deposits, followed
by S&amp;Ls with $960 billion, money market mutual funds with $330
billion and credit unions with $195 billion. All except mutual funds
are federally insured.
   Part of deposit insurance reform will be a look at banks' use of
their deposits, including investing in leveraged corporate buyouts
and in securities underwriting, Gonzalez said.
   Any attempt to reform federal deposit insurance is sure to spark
fierce debate in Congress. In January, just before President Reagan
left office, White House economic advisers suggested that deposit
insurance ought to be ``curbed.''
   But even that vague recommendation provoked strong criticism from
members of Congress, including Gonzalez. Although he didn't reject
reducing deposit insurance then, he chastised the timing of Reagan
advisers who floated the idea at the height of depositor concern
over S&amp;Ls.
   In recent weeks, the topic has been raised in banking circles
more frequently. William Isaac, former chairman of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp.; Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal
Reserve Bank in Cleveland, and John S. Reed, chairman of Citicorp,
the nation's largest bank company, have all outlined proposals for
forcing large depositors to assume some losses in a bank failure.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the banking
committee's financial institutions subcommittee, has scheduled
hearings Sept. 19-21 to examine the health of the insurance funds
for commercial banks and credit unions.

<HEAD>Bennett Says `Just War' on Drugs Will Succeed</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bush-Drugs Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National drug policy director William J.
Bennett predicted Wednesday that the war on drugs outlined by
President Bush will win passage in Congress and then succeed against
illegal drugs in America.
   There will be no ``Batman through the transom'' flashy solutions
to the drug problem, Bennett said. But he added, ``If we follow this
strategy, pursue and apply this pressure consistently over time, and
if we do our job and the states do their job, and others who are
called on do their job, this problem will get better and America
will win this war on drugs.''
   Bennett, launching his campaign to sell the $7.9 billion program
to Congress and the country, expressed confidence that the American
people are ready for what he called this ``just war.''
   ``Most Americans ... understand what this problem is, they are
impatient about it and they want something to be done,'' he said.
   As for winning congressional approval, he said he was heartened
that much criticism so far from Democrats has concerned money to pay
for the proposal, not the basic tenets.
   The strategy, which Bennett played a key role in developing,
calls for a law enforcement crackdown on all levels of drug
trafficking, from drug kingpins overseas to casual users in America.
It also seeks a 53 percent increase in funding for treatment
programs, a 25 percent increase in prevention efforts and a vast
expansion of the federal prison system to house drug offenders.
   A number of congressional Democrats have said the program doesn't
go far enough and that Bush should recommend a tax increase to pay
for it instead of proposing to take money from other programs.
   ``I did not hear anyone taking issue in principle with an Andean
strategy, with the strategy which talks about user responsibility,
with the strategy that talks about our efforts in public housing,
that talks about accountability in treatment, that talks about
measurable objectives and the like,'' Bennett said.
   The Andean strategy calls for $261 million to be spent next year
in military and law enforcement anti-drug aid to Colombia, Peru and
Bolivia, the three main cocaine-producing countries. In addition,
the administration plans to offer some $2 billion more over the five
following years to those countries in economic and other aid once
they demonstrate solid efforts to cut down on the drug trafficking.
   As for those who say the $7.9 billion is inadequate to fight the
war on drugs, Bennett said, ``I'm just not going to be all that
receptive to criticism of the figure of $8 billion from people whose
correct mark is $6 billion.''
   The criticism wasn't only coming from Congress, however.
   The American Civil Liberties Union called the Bush
administration's anti-drug strategy ``counterproductive and
cynical,'' short-changing prevention and treatment programs while
putting ``overwhelming reliance on the criminal justice system.''
The plan will compromise civil liberties and cost the taxpayers
millions of dollars, said Ira Glasser, ACLU's executive director.
   Neal R. Sonnett, president of the National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers, said the administration's plan ``dooms us
to repeat the failures of the past.'' The nation needs ``to find
better ways to divert first-time and non-violent, minor offenders
into treatment, rehabilitation and education programs,'' Sonnett
said.
   And Donald Fiedler, national director of the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said the program
declares ``war on at least 25 million fellow citizens who are
leading productive lives but for their casual or regular use of
marijuana.''
   Bennett defended the strategy's emphasis on punishing casual
users _ including requiring colleges to take action against them if
they want to continue receiving federal funds.
   ``It is not to be mean and vindictive,'' Bennett said. ``The user
is the person who is the carrier. ... Casual users give out drugs,
because they like company in what they're doing.''
   Although Bush rejected Bennett's plan to require states to impose
strict punishment on casual users _ including the revocation of
drivers' licenses and seizures of autos used to obtain drugs _ if
the states wanted to receive federal highway funds, Bennett
continued to press states to pass such laws.
   Casual users may not need to go to prison, he said, ``But there's
a lot of things people can do as a way of ... making restitution to
the community. They can pay fines, they can give up their property
if it's used for their crime. They can do community service. They
can fill potholes.''
   On other issues, Bennett said:
   _Those who criticize the plan's call for increased security at
public housing projects _ such as identification cards and the
eviction of drug dealers _ are failing to see that poor people
should have the same safety enjoyed by the wealthy.
   _More research is needed in drug treatment to develop methods to
get people off cocaine. ``The simple fact is that crack (cocaine)
has caught on as an addiction and as a criminal activity ahead of
the researchers. And the legitimate research community needs to
catch up.''

<HEAD>Little People Liberation Responds to Dwarf Throwing With Anthem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Billy Barty and his Little
People Liberation have battled ``attitudinal and architectural
barriers'' for years, but the bizarre barroom sport of dwarf
throwing is too much to bear.
   ``It's a problem because it's very demeaning,'' Barty said of the
growing entertainment phenomenon. ``They are trying to spread it and
we are trying to get little people away from that.
   ``I can't deprive anybody from making a livelihood. But when
you're talking about people in bars that drink and throw _ that's
sad. I think it should be outlawed.''
   The 3-foot-9-inch Barty made his remarks after a news conference
to announce the upcoming release of the Little People Liberation
anthem recording and video ``From Where I Stand.''
   ``We should be looked up to. We should not be judged by our size
but for the space between our ears,'' said Barty, flanked by 15
other dwarfs who were introduced by Barty.
   They were identified as a lawyer, electronics technician,
stuntman, circus performer, actors and actresses. Barty then
introduced an Internal Revenue Service secretary _ his daughter,
Lori.
   ``My son would be here but he's 5-foot-11,'' said Barty, whose
movie credits include ``The Day of the Locust,'' ``Under the
Rainbow,' ``Foul Play,'' ``Willow'' and the upcoming ``UHF'' and
``Lobster Man From Mars.''
   The anthem has a ``We Are the World'' gospel flavor featuring
singer Carl Anderson and is designed to unite people on behalf of
the disabled. A toe-tapping Barty moved his lips to synchronize with
the lyrics as it was played for reporters.
   ``It is a positive outlook toward life,'' Barty said of the
recording and video being released next month. Proceeds will go to
the Billy Barty Foundation, which funds scholarships and other
programs for little people.
   ``The song is a message of dignity, determination and joy. The
toughest part is for the bigger world to understand. Don't judge us
by our size,'' Barty said.
   Barty, 65, founded Little People of America in 1957 to help
dwarfs. He said there were 1.5 million little people in the United
States and 200 types of dwarfism.
   One of his biggest concerns is creating a barrier-free
environment, the implementation of such innovations as windows that
crank open and voice-activated controls.

   A federal grand jury on Wednesday indicted
the man police have labeled a suspect in the Green River serial
killings on charges he possessed a firearm while a fugitive,
authorities said.
   William Jay Stevens II, 38, is serving a sentence for escape in
the King County Jail after walking away from a work-release facility
while serving a term for possessing stolen property in 1981. He is
due to be released Sept. 25.
   The Green River Task Force, investigating the deaths or
disappearances of at least 40 young women, described Stevens as a
``viable suspect'' after his arrest here in January.
   The description was contained in an affidavit used to obtain a
search warrant for two Spokane residences where Stevens had lived.
That search yielded 1,800 videotapes and police material, including
uniforms and weapons.
   Stevens was a third-year student at Gonzaga University Law School
at the time.
   He has not been charged in any of the Green River killings. It
was not immediately clear how the charges issued Wednesday might
affect his release.
   U.S. Attorney John Lamp had no immediate comment on Wednesday's
indictment.
   The Green River murders, which take their name from the south
King County river where the first victims were discovered, involve
the deaths of as many as 48 young women in the Seattle and Portland
areas during 1982-84.

<HEAD>Judge: Man Has Right Not To Answer Questions About War Activities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 80-year-old man fighting deportation over
accusations he committed Nazi atrocities has a constitutional right
to refuse to answer questions about his wartime activities in
Latvia, a federal judge has ruled.
   The fear of Edgars Inde are reasonable that he will be prosecuted
for war crimes if his U.S. citizenship is revoked and he is
deported, U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson said Tuesday.
   The ruling means Inde may invoke his Fifth Amendment right in the
civil proceeding against him instituted in a lawsuit for deportation
by the U.S. Justice Department in 1988.
   The Minneapolis man is accused of belonging to a political police
organization that helped Nazi SS troops execute thousands of Latvian
Jews in 1941. The government sued Inde on grounds that he lied about
his wartime activities when he applied for entry into the United
States following the war.
   Inde has denied that he was involved in the execution of Jews.
   The United States does not prosecute war criminals, but some
countries, including Israel, the Soviet Union and West Germany, have
done so.
   Inde's attorney, Ivars Berzins, of Babylon, N.Y., told Magnuson
at a hearing in May that Inde fears he will be deported to one of
those three countries and prosecuted for war crimes.
   ``This is a civil proceeding in name only,'' Berzins said. ``Our
client stands accused of nothing less than murder. He has a real
fear of foreign prosecution.''
   Magnuson said in his order that Inde's fear is not ``trifling or
imaginary. In view of the nature of the charges, it is reasonable to
assume that the only country willing to accept him (in the event of
deportation) would be one that would prosecute him.''
   Berzins, reached at his office by telephone Wednesday, declined
to comment on the ruling and refused to say what the next step in
the proceedings would be.
   Telephone messages for comment from Alan Held, attorney for the
U.S. Justice Department, were not immediately returned.
   The Justice Department had argued that Inde may decline to answer
questions only if he fears prosecution in the United States. The
department also contends it is unlikely any other country would
prosecute Inde for war crimes.
   Magnuson's order overturns one issued in May by U.S. Magistrate
Floyd Boline. Boline said that fear of foreign prosecution is not a
basis for claiming privilege against self-incrimination and that any
statements made by Inde in a deposition could be sealed to protect
him from foreign prosecution.
   Magnuson said sealing the transcript might not adequately protect
Inde.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. ambassador and his last 29
American staff members were forced out of Lebanon on Wednesday by
Christians, including about 1,000 massed outside the embassy, who
claim the United States supports Syria.
   Two helicopters landed at the compound about 7:30 a.m. and a
third hovered overhead, apparently providing cover, while the 30
Americans were evacuated, a witness said.
   It is the first time an American ambassador has been pulled from
Lebanon since the sectarian civil war began 14 years ago, and the
move at least temporarily ended the American diplomatic presence in
the country.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler angrily blamed the
Christian army commander, Gen. Michel Aoun, for the move, saying he
threatened to expose U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy and his staff to
a ``good dose of Christian terrorism.''
   She said that before the evacuation, an unidentified telephone
caller had threatened to shoot down the U.S. helicopter that brought
supplies to the embassy and that an unidentified protest leader said
people in the embassy entered and left ``at their own risk.''
   The Americans will return when ``conditions permit,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said.
   On arrival at the U.S. military's Rhine-Main Air Base outside
Frankfurt, a weary McCarthy told reporters Wednesday night that ``as
soon as those questions of security and safety can be resolved ...
it would be important for us to resume the work that we were doing
in Beirut.''
   McCarthy and his staff flew in on a U.S. Air Force C-130
transport plane from Cyprus. They are expected to leave West Germany
for the United States on Thursday but no further details were
immediately available.
   ``It just seemed to me that in the last several days it was no
longer possible for me to guarantee to Washington that the safety of
my staff was secure and it was for that reason that we left,''
McCarthy said.
   ``But as soon as those questions of security and safety can be
resolved, it seems to be that it would be important for us to resume
the work that we were doing in Beirut.''
   In Christian east Beirut, youths who had blockaded the gates of
the embassy compound for 24 hours dispersed at 1 p.m.
   The Movement for Supporting Liberation threatened in a statement
to resume the embassy siege if McCarthy returned before Washington
recognized Aoun's Christian Cabinet as the ``legitimate Lebanese
government.''
   Aoun, who has fought an artillery war with Syrian troops six
months, said of the evacuation: ``It seems the American Cain
couldn't endure the stare of the Lebanese Abel, so he left.''
   Aoun accuses the United States of supporting the presence of
40,000 soldiers in Lebanon, which he calls an occupation army. The
Syrians are in the country under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping
mandate.
   Syrians and Christians exchanged intermittent artillery fire in
and around Beirut on Wednesday, killing one person and wounding
three.
   By police count, 828 people have been killed and 2,455 wounded
since the fighting began March 8 between the 20,000 men of Aoun's
Christian army units and a Moslem alliance led by the Syrians.
   McCarthy arrived a year ago, but to avoid extending recognition
to either Aoun's government or the competing Moslem Cabinet of
acting Premier Salim Hoss, he did not present his credentials.
   In Aoun's statement, issued in English, the U.S.-trained general
said: ``I am not surprised at all by the apparently precipitate
departure of our American guests early this morning.
   ``I used the term `guests' since, as the American ambassador did
not see fit to present his credentials to my government, his status
and that of his officials was, strictly speaking, that of visitors.
   ``Such puzzling and petulant behavior by Mr. McCarthy merely
reflects the nature and conduct of the U.S. State Department's
policy toward that part of Lebanon free of Syrian occupation.''
   An-Nahar, an independent Beirut newspaper, said an undisclosed
number of American diplomats left Beirut on Saturday after Aoun told
a news conference the United States had ``sold Lebanon to Syria.''
   He claimed U.S. policy was ``dictated exclusively by concerns
over the eight remaining American hostages in Lebanon.''
   The eight are among 16 Western captives, most believed to be in
the hands of Shiite radicals loyal to Iran. Held longest is Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   A resident of Aoukar, the Christian suburb where the embassy is
located, said: ``Two helicopters landed at the embassy compound
around 7:30 a.m. while the third, which appeared to be armed with
machine guns, hovered overhead at a medium altitude in an apparent
protection mission.
   ``Several people boarded the helicopters seconds after they
landed. They also loaded big sacks and several bags on the aircraft,
which took off a few minutes later.''
   Keith Peterson, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Cyprus, said:
``This move was in response to deteriorating local circumstances
which no longer permitted the embassy to function effectively. The
United States is not abandoning Lebanon. ... its personnel will
return when the situation permits.''
   American diplomats moved to the Beirut facility, an embassy
annex, after a Shiite Moslem suicide bomber rammed a van packed with
explosives into the seaside embassy in Moslem west Beirut on April
19, 1983, killing 17 Americans and 46 other people.
   A suicide bomber attacked the east Beirut annex on Sept. 20,
1984, killing 12 people and wounding 96, but the embassy remained
there.

   Cocaine prices in Miami rose in the past few
weeks, but it's still unclear whether the Colombian government's
crackdown on narcotics traffickers slowed the flow of the drug into
the United States, the Drug Enforcement Administration said
Wednesday.
   The retail price of cocaine in South Florida has gone from an
average of $11,000 to $16,000 per kilogram to about $19,000 to
$20,000, based on sales of five to 15 kilograms, DEA spokesman Frank
Shults said.
   The DEA was not aware of any change in price to individual
cocaine users, as agents did not make any such spot check purchases,
Shults said. Instead, they bought in quantities of five, 10 and 15
kilograms, he said.
   The increase in prices, Shults cautioned, has been noticed for
the past three weeks, since slightly before Colombian President
Virgilio Barco issued emergency measures that allow for the
extradition of alleged drug traffickers to the United States to
stand trial and for the seizure of the traffickers' property.
   Barco launched the nationwide attack on drug traffickers
following the Aug. 18 assassination of leading president candidate
Luis Carlos Galan, a foe of the drug trade.
   ``We have not made any judgment about the impact of the events in
Colombia about the availability of cocaine in the United States,''
Shults said. The DEA is ``reviewing intelligence trends and various
other indicators and we'll be making that assessment,'' he said.
   However, Shults said that even if cocaine is not becoming scarcer
because of a disruption in the drug traffickers' operations, some
retailers who are raising their prices may be capitalizing on
buyers' fears that the drug is becoming harder to obtain.
   ``It may just be individual entrepreneurs capitalizing on
perceived market pressures,'' he said.
   Since Barco announced the emergency measures, drug traffickers
have launched a ``total war'' on the government, including bombings
in Medellin _ home to one of the world's largest drug cartels _ and
in the capital city of Bogota, and a shooting spree at the Bogota
airport.
   While the raw material _ coca leaf _ for most of the U.S. supply
of cocaine is grown in Peru and Bolivia, Colombia is the base for
the major traffickers who process the leaf into cocaine and
distribute it overseas.

   The head of the AFL-CIO, other union leaders
and several members of Congress joined striking Eastern Airlines
workers at the end of a 26-day, 3,000-mile march Wednesday to
support the six-month-old walkout.
   Several hundred members of unions representing pilots, flight
attendants and mechanics paraded to the White House after a rally of
speeches, songs and chants against Texas Air Corp. owner Frank
Lorenzo on the west steps of the Capitol.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland demanded that the Senate bring to
a vote a measure to force resolution of the strike. The House
already has approved such a bill after President Bush refused to
follow a National Mediation Board recommendation in March that he
appoint an emergency board to investigate the labor dispute.
   Appointment of such a board would have banned a strike for 60
days.
   ``We're in a tough battle against one of the worst employers in
the country,'' Kirkland said.
   ``We know which side the president of the United States is on.
He's made that abundantly clear,'' said Kirkland.
   The rally came at the end of a march and caravan that started in
Miami on Aug. 12. Thirteen Eastern employees were introduced who,
leaders said, traveled the entire route. Hundreds of others
participated in mile-long relays of a symbolic picket sign along the
East Coast route that included New York and Boston.
   The unions accuse Lorenzo of planning to strip away Eastern's
assets until the airline is dead. Lorenzo said he is gradually
building it back up to a major carrier and has been adding flights
and personnel since filing for court protection from creditors and
reorganization under bankruptcy laws.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., saying ``working men have to stick
together'' to fight for the Eastern workers, said he would push for
Senate approval of the emergency legislation.
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., said the strikers were ``fighting for
justice for all American workers.'' He said Lorenzo was trying to be
a ``modern-day robber baron.''
   Rep. Charles Hayes, D-Ill., said congressional inaction would be
support for Lorenzo.
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., put on a red shirt that urged a boycott
of Eastern and Lorenzo-owned Continental Airlines, and said, ``I
believe Frank Lorenzo is vicious and greedy.''

<HEAD>Communist Former Prime Minister Reported Offered Government Post</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki has
offered his communist predecessor, Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, a post in
the new government, the state PAP news agency reported Wednesday.
   The full list of nominees to the first non-communist-led
government in the East bloc will be made public Thursday, a
secretary in Mazowiecki's office said.
   A brief PAP dispatch said Mazowiecki received Kiszczak at his
office Wednesday and offered him a position, but did not say what
position or if Kiszczak accepted.
   An army general who for eight years headed the Interior Ministry
with control of the police, Kiszczak would appear a likely candidate
to head either the Interior Ministry or the Ministry of Defense.
   Two communist party leaders also met with Mazowiecki on Wednesday
and said a good atmosphere prevailed but ``certain details'' remain
unsettled and require more talks Thursday, according to PAP.
   The party Politburo was reviewing the proposed government makeup
and will inform Mazowiecki on Thursday of its final stance on taking
part in the coalition, PAP said.
   Longtime Solidarity activist Mazowiecki was elected prime
minister on Aug. 24. He has crafted a coalition Cabinet giving the
largest share of ministerial portfolios to members of his movement,
followed by the communist Polish United Workers Party, the United
Peasant Party and the Democratic Party, according to legislative
officials.
   The Democrats said they were offered three ministries. The
Peasants confirmed their acceptance of four. The communists are
offered at least four, legislative sources said, and Solidarity
would take the rest.
   There are currently 16 ministries but the number could change.
   The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
   One source said it appeared Solidarity would get two of the most
highly contested posts _ foreign affairs and chairmanship of the
committee that administers state television and radio.
   The Democrats and Peasants each will also be given a deputy
premiership, leaders of those parties said. The two minor parties
provided the swing votes needed to shift the government power away
from the communists for the first time since World War II.
   The Sejm, or lower house of parliament, elected Kiszczak as
premier on Aug. 2, but President Wojciech Jaruzelski accepted his
resignation Aug. 19 after Kiszczak failed to put together a
communist-led ``grand coalition'' government.
   Jaruzelski then accepted Solidarity leader Lech Walesa's proposal
to let Mazowiecki assemble a Solidarity-led government in coalition
with the Peasants and Democrats.
   Mazowiecki will meet Thursday with members of the Solidarity
parliamentary caucus to present his choices for approval, caucus
leader Bronislaw Geremek said. Some Solidarity lawmakers have
complained about the tight secrecy that has been kept on the
government formation.
   Geremek said the final list of nominees would be given to Sejm
speaker Mikolaj Kozakiewicz after the meeting. Kozakiewicz said Sejm
commissions will hold hearings for three days to consider the
candidates, and full Sejm will vote on them next Tuesday.
   ``We know it is not going to be the government of our dreams, but
a result of many concessions,'' said a commentary Wednesday in the
pro-Solidarity Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper.
   Mazowiecki met Wednesday with communist parliamentary leader
Marian Orzechowski and Central Committee Secretary Leszek Miller,
who has been representing the party in coalition talks.
   PAP quoted them as expressing the conviction later that remaining
items will not prevent a Sejm vote on the government Tuesday.
   The communists were promised the ministries of defense and
interior from the start. A legislative source close to the
negotiations said they also would get transportation and either the
Ministry for Foreign Trade or the Office of Economic Planning.

   Azerbaijanis will continue a general strike,
originally called for three days, until a top Soviet official visits
the area, a leading activist in Baku said Wednesday.
   Ekhtibar Mamedov, spokesman for the People's Front political
movement, said by telephone from the southern republic's capital
that hundreds of thousands of people attended a rally late Wednesday.
   The People's Front wants Azerbaijan to reassert full control over
the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which now is being governed from
Moscow, and to recall its national parliament representatives.
   Neighboring Armenia also claims Nagorno-Karabakh, whose
population is predominantly Armenian, and violence has torn the
region for 18 months.
   Mamedov said the strike, scheduled to end Wednesday, would
continue until President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Vice President
Anatoly I. Lukyanov or Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov visit the area.
   He said the People's Front wants such a visit because ``the
republic's government is not in a position to solve this question''
of Nagorno-Karabakh. If no-one comes, Mamedov declared, the
political movement may change its platform to call for independence
rather than greater autonomy.
   Abdul-Rakhman Vezirov, head of the republic's Communist Party,
recommended more complete Kremlin control over Nagorno-Karabakh
region.
   Vezirov made the statement in an interview released in Moscow by
the Foreign Ministry. It contradicted a claim made by Activist Aiden
Amirbekov late Tuesday that Vezirov wanted control returned to
Azerbaijan.
   Official media have given wide coverage to ethnic disputes in the
Baltic republics and in Moldavia, which borders Romania, but have
said little about the strike in Azerbaijan.
   The People's Front says the strike has affected 95 percent of
factories in Baku and paralyzed rail transportation throughout the
republic. Journalists for the official Azerinform news agency have
said the strike is not so widespread.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said a strike by
Russian-speaking workers in Moldavia against a law making Moldavian
the official language continued despite appeals by the local
leadership and a national commission.
   Strikers met with a national legislative commission and the
Moldavian party chief, president and premier, Tass said.
   The strikers want Russian as a second official language in the
republic. Of the republic's 4.2 million people, 64 percent are
ethnic Moldavian and 36 percent Ukrainian, Russian, Bulgarian,
Jewish and Turkish.

   The U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday it has
begun an investigation of complaints that law enforcement officers
used excessive force to quell a Labor Day weekend riot at the
Virginia Beach oceanfront.
   ``We've received at least three complaints,'' said Tom Love, an
FBI special agent in Norfolk.
   Justice Department spokeswoman Burstion-Wade said the FBI and the
department's civil rights division had formally opened a criminal
investigation into possible deprivation of civil rights.
   She said the department was reviewing published accounts and
videotapes of the riot, which broke out early Sunday during
Greekfest.
   The annual college student gathering drew more than 100,000 young
people from predominately black East Coast colleges to the
oceanfront over the holiday weekend. Police and National Guard
troops carrying clubs dispersed the crowd after about 100 downtown
stores were damaged by looters and vandals.
   ``We welcome the investigation,'' said Virginia Beach Mayor
Meyera E. Oberndorf. ``I thought that our police used extraordinary
restraint.''
   Preliminary police counts showed that 1,235 people were charged
with 1,346 offenses, most of them involving traffic violations,
public drinking or disorderly conduct. Police arrested 220 people.
At least 43 people were injured, including 30 police officers or
National Guardsmen.
   Merchants who suffered millions of dollars in property damage
said they were not sure how to prevent a recurrence next year, but
some said they would consider closing Labor Day weekend.
   ``I do not want to see a return of this group or any group this
large,'' said William L. Dillon, owner of Abbey Road Restaurant and
president of the Virginia Beach Restaurant Association.
   Several motel owners said tourists had canceled reservations
after hearing about the rioting.
   Steve Luchik, general manager of the Holiday Inn on the Ocean,
said his hotel has lost more than $30,000 from cancellations in the
past few days.
   ``Now I'm getting groups cancelling, not only individuals,''
Luchik said, explaining that a Chicago business organization just
canceled its reservations.
   ``Their last words to me were, `When things cool down there,
we'll reconsider.' I said, `Well, it's over.' They didn't care,''
Luchik said.
   ``We've got to promote a safe, comfortable, relaxing atmosphere''
to lure tourists back, said James Capps, president of the Virginia
Beach Hotel and Motel Association.
   Flo McDaniel, executive director of the innkeepers' association,
said it could take years for the city to restore its tarnished image.
   ``We still have the surf. We still have all the things going for
us we had before,'' she said. ``What we have gotten is about $100
million in adverse advertising.''

<HEAD>Survey: Penny Stock Swindles Are No. 1 Threat to Small Investors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American investors have been cheated out of at
least $2 billion a year by crooked schemes involving low cost, high
risk penny stocks, according to a survey by state securities
regulators on Wednesday.
   ``Penny stock swindles are now the No. 1 threat of fraud and
abuse facing small investors in the United States,'' said the report
on a 50-state survey by the North American Securities Administrators
Association (NASAA).
   The report comes just as Congress turns to examine the problem.
   The House telecommunications and finance subcommittee has
scheduled a hearing Thursday on the effect of penny stock swindles
on small investors.
   ``The likelihood of losing money in penny stocks now runs at
about 90 percent,'' said Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., the
subcommittee chairman. ``Penny stocks make a night at the casino
look like a shrewd investment,'' he added.
   Markey's subcommittee was scheduled to hear testimony from a
convicted penny stock swindler with alleged organized crimes ties, a
Powder Springs, Ga., couple who were victimized by penny stock scam
artists and John Baldwin, director of the Utah Division of
Securities and president of NASAA, a Washington-based organization
of state-level securities regulators.
   Penny stocks, inexpensive but highly risky securities that
usually aren't listed on stock exchanges, are legal, but they are
usually issued by new companies with an untested or uneven earnings
history.
   While their price, a few cents up to a few dollars, makes them an
attractive to small investors with limited funds, they pose a risk
because information is often hard to obtain and fraudulent claims
are difficult to dispute.
   ``The penny stock industry increasingly is dominated by utterly
worthless or highly dubious securities offerings that are
systematically manipulated by repeat offenders of state and federal
securities laws,'' the NASAA report said.
   The report went on to note that investors in legitimate penny
stocks ``are believed to lose all or some of their investment 70
percent of the time and the presence of fraud pushes up that figure
to 90 percent.''
   While penny stock fraud is not new, the report noted, it has
grown from the the phony mining stock scams of the 1940s and 1950s
that were confined mainly to the Far West, to widespread interstate
schemes.
   In Florida, only 5 percent of the registered brokers specialize
in penny stocks but they accounted for 40 percent of investor
complaints in fiscal year 1988-1989.
   According to the 50-state survey NASAA conducted:
   _Pending state-level probes of penny stock schemes rose 97
percent from 1987 to 1988, from 375 to 737;
   _The number of investigations into penny stocks that state
regulators have concluded jumped from 262 in 1987 to 395 in 1988;
   _Consumer complaints about penny stocks have risen from 1,767 in
1987 to 2,660 in 1988.
   ``Several states have indicated that their offices have been
swamped so far in 1989 with new penny stock investor complaints,''
according to the 98-page report.
   The surge in investor complaints has been echoed in Securities
and Exchange Commission statistics. The federal agency, which
oversees the markets in stocks, bonds and other securities, said it
received 1,510 penny stock complaints in all of fiscal year 1988 and
has already gotten 2,462 in the first half of this year.

   Otto G. Obermaier, a Manhattan defense lawyer
who specializes in white-collar cases, was nominated Wednesday to
succeed Rudolph Giuliani as U.S. attorney for the Southern District
of New York.
   President Bush announced his nomination of Obermaier in a news
release. Obermaier said he was ``delighted'' to be nominated.
   Giuliani stepped down Jan. 31 to run for the Republican
nomination for mayor of New York, Since then, Benito Romano has been
the acting U.S. attorney.
   Obermaier, 53, was recommended for the job in January by Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., over the objections of Giuliani.
   Giuliani opposed Obermaier because several of his firm's clients
are targets of federal insider-trading investigations. Giuliani said
he would present his views to the Justice Department, which reviews
a candidate for a federal prosecutor's job before the president
sends the nomination to the Senate for its approval.
   On Wednesday, spokesman Charles Perkins said Giuliani ``wishes
him well in the confirmation process'' and ``believes he's qualified
for the position.''
   Shortly after his nomination, Obermaier said he did not think
that his work as a defense lawyer would create conflicts for him as
a federal prosecutor. He said he would step aside if, as U.S.
attorney, he encountered a case in which his firm had a role.
   ``I don't think they're all that numerous, but clearly I'm
ethically obligated to do that,'' he said.
   Obermaier was quoted in the National Law Journal in 1987 as
saying securities violations were being handled too often by
prosecutors as crimes rather than by the Securities and Exchange
Commission as civil matters.
   On Wednesday, he said that his comments ``certainly represented
the thinking at the time.'' He said he could not name any recent
Wall Street cases that he believed had been wrongly prosecuted.
   As U.S. attorney, Giuliani was at the forefront of investigating
Wall Street scandals, prosecuting numerous cases of insider trading
and stock manipulation.

<TEXT>
   A former premier of the Uzbekistan republic was
convicted of bribery Wednesday and sentenced a labor camp for nine
years in the latest episode of a corruption scandal that led to the
Kremlin.
   Tass said a court sitting in Moscow found N. Khudaiberdiev,
premier from 1971-84, guilty of taking more than 15,000 rubles in
bribes and giving bribes of 50,000 rubles. The ruble figures are
equivalent to $23,000 and $80,000 at the official rate of exchange.
   Several regional party officials in Uzbekistan have been executed
for corruption since trials began last year.
   Testimony linked Khudaiberdiev to a 50,000-ruble bribe given Yuri
Churbanov, son-in-law of the late President Leonid I. Brezhnev, who
was convicted in December and given a 12-year prison sentence, the
official news agency reported.
   It said the court ordered Khudaiberdiev's property confiscated
and sent him to a strict-regime labor camp.
   The defendant was quoted as telling the court bribery had so
enveloped the Uzbekistan government and Communist Party that
officials had to participate ``in order to live and work more or
less normally.''
   Two prosecutors, Telman Gdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov, became heroes
by uncovering the trail of corruption that led from Uzbekistan to
Brezhnev's Kremlin, where Churbanov was first deputy interior
minister.
   After both were elected to the new parliament this year, however,
their tactics came under criticism and they were taken off the case.
   Tass said supporters of Gdlyan and Ivanov attended
Khudaiberdiev's trial, and the judge had to caution them to stop
interfering.

   Premier Ruud Lubbers' Christian
Democrats won Wednesday's national election, giving Lubbers a third
term in office and a mandate to strengthen environmental cleanup
laws.
   With 92 percent of the vote counted, Dutch Television projected
that Lubbers' middle-of-the-road Christian Democratic Appeal would
keep its 54 seats in the 150-seat Dutch Parliament and remain the
largest single group in the legislature.
   The largest parliamentary party traditionally gets the
premiership in the Dutch system. The results showed voters rallied
behind Ludders, the longest-serving Dutch leader in 30 years.
   The television projection said the right-wing Liberals, junior
partners in the center-right coalition government, would lose five
of their 27 seats, and indicated a loss of three of its 52 seats for
the Labor Party.
   The Liberal loss, combined with longstanding tensions within the
coalition, could open the way to a center-left alliance, with Labor
getting its first share of power after seven years in opposition.
   Lubbers' center-right coalition government crumbled in May over
environmental policy in a clash that also reflected years of
irritation among the Liberals at having to accept Christian
Democratic programs.
   The Christian Democrats form the fulcrum of power in Dutch
politics and traditionally join forces with either Labor or the
Liberals.
   Lubbers said the Liberals' loss was ``tough, very tough'' for his
former coalition partners but did not rule out entering a new
alliance with them.
   However, Lubbers also said in the television interview that
``there's no reason'' why he might not build a coalition with Labor.
   Most electoral gains went to the opposition Democrats '66 Party,
which steers close to Labor, and Green Left, an upstart alliance of
environmentalists and anti-NATO activists that includes the
Communist Party of the Netherlands. Both parties picked up three
seats, giving 12 seats to the Democrats '66 and six for the Green
Left.
   Queen Beatrix now will appoint an official to supervise the
building of a new coalition and getting it to agree on a government
platform and the division of ministerial posts.
   The Chrstian Democrats' parliamentary floor leader, Bert de
Vries, said in a television interview it would be a ``pretty
complicated business'' for his party to agree on a new center-right
alliance with the Liberals.
   The highly popular Lubbers came to power in 1982 on a platform of
economic recovery focused on bringing down the nation's budget
deficit, then at 10 percent of net national income, and its 17
percent unemployment rate.
   The budget deficit is expected to be down to 5.25 percent next
year, with 610,000 people, or 11.3 percent of the working
population, still unemployed.
   But as economic prospects looked up, Lubbers turned to the
environment and fielded an ambitious, $3.3 billion plan to clean up
the heavily polluted Dutch soil, air and waterways.
   The plan sparked his government's fall when the Liberals rejected
Lubbers' proposal to partly finance it by ending income tax breaks
for the nation's car-driving commuters.
   If the Christian Democrats and Labor form a new Cabinet, that
could herald a substantial easing of the austere economic programs
that earned Lubbers his media nickname ``Rude Shock.''
   Labor has been accusing Lubbers of unfairly burdening low-income
groups like the 3 million people living on subsistence-level social
benefits as well as the sick and elderly.

   East German diplomats set up office near
a refugee camp Wednesday to try to persuade thousands of their
countrymen they had nothing to fear at home and to give up dreams of
a new life in the West.
   West Germany meanwhile expressed hope a solution to the refugee
crisis was near.
   By late Wednesday, about 5,600 East Germans hoping to flee West
had registered to do so, said officials of West German charities who
have helped to care for the refugees since mid-August. Hungarian
charity officials said a sixth refugee camp had been opened, with
more planned if needed.
   Thirty East Germans, apparently frustrated at waiting for a
promised freedom convoy from Hungary to the West, fled illegally
Tuesday night to Austria, Red Cross officials there said.
   The number going over the border zoomed in recent days,
indicating refugee desperation over recent discouraging Hungarian
statements hinting that the start of an organized mass exodus could
be weeks away.
   Hungary has partially cleared the border of barbed wire and other
barriers.
   West German officials had seemed optimistic last week that mass
transit westward could begin in days. They now are more cautious,
but several suggested that a move west still was not too far away
for the East Germans.
   The official MTI news agency quoted West German Ambassador
Alexander Arnot as saying ``the refugee situation will be resolved
in the forseeable future.''
   In Bonn, where West German officials have been negotiating with
hardline communist East German leaders over the refugee standoff,
government speaker Hans Klein said East Germany showed no
flexibility.
   But Foreign Ministry spokesman Juergen Chrobog said Bonn remains
confident of a solution soon.
   Hungary has angered East Germany, its Soviet bloc ally, by
effectively breaking an agreement obliging it to return all East
Germans trying to flee.
   It has also pledged they would be allowed to leave for West
Germany, which grants them automatic citizenship. But Budapest's
communist leaders are thought to be seeking at least grudging East
German acquiescence before giving the go-ahead for the mass exodus.
   Few young working East Germans can travel to the West legally,
but are relatively free to go to Hungary. More than 6,000 East
Germans have fled through Austria to West Germany since Hungary
began clearing its westernmost border in May.
   East Berlin promised refugees they face no persecution if they
return.
   First Secretary Dieter Grahmann of the East German Embassy on
Tuesday began distributing leaflets at the Zugliget refugee camp
repeating his country's promises, but left quickly after an angry
crowd gathered. He returned Wednesday, and set up with a colleague
in a car trailer across from the camp.
   Around them were cars of East German refugees _ some with bumper
stickers of a European cigarette company declaring ``Let's Go
West,'' or of a West German charter airline saying ``Nothing Like
Getting Out of Here.''
   Small groups gathered near the trailer shortly after it was
manned at 9:45 a.m., but no one approached and several would-be
refugees were openly derisive.
   ``They must really be stupid to come here,'' said a heavy-set
East German from Dresden. ``But I guess they have no choice, it's
either victory or Siberia for them.''
   Grahmann told reporters any refugees were free ``to discuss the
situation'' with him or a colleague.
   But several East Germans said after the trailer closed for the
day at noon that the two diplomats had had little to do.
   ``I didn't see one person going in there, outside of Western
journalists,'' said the Dresden man, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. The East German Embassy said the trailer would reopen
Thursday.
   Hungarian charity official Csilla von Boeselager said camp
residents were asked to refrain from ``unwise actions'' against
diplomats or trailer.
   Hungarian Red Cross officials at nearby Csilleberc camp said an
East German diplomat carrying leaflets was barred entry, because
``it would have been difficult to guarantee the safety of said East
German,'' MTI reported.

<HEAD>Pressure on Britain Over Financial Ties with South Africa</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-South Africa, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain should take a ``hard look'' at its
financial links with South Africa as part of international efforts
to end apartheid, Canadian Foreign Minister Joe Clark said Wednesday.
   Britain's financial ties with South Africa are of special
importance, said Clark, who indicated at a London news conference
that Britain's 47 Commonwealth partners will exert pressure over the
links at a meeting next month.
   Clark spoke as thousands of blacks struck in South Africa to
protest their exclusion from voting in Wednesday's national
election. Before the poll, President F.W. Clerk of the governing
National Party pledged reforms to give blacks a role in government.
   ``If South African loans were rescheduled for say only one year
at a time, that would enable us to see how much progress is made in
the reform program. We feel that loan pressure can be an effective
instrument in helping the reform program,'' Clark said.
   ``Talk of reform in South Africa is not in itself enough. There
must be clear evidence that a reform program is being implemented,''
he said.
   Clark met earlier with Britain's Foreign Secretary John Major to
explain the decisions of the Commonwealth foreign ministers
committee last month in Canberra, Australia. Britain is not a member
of the committee.
   Clark said: ``The British position on sanctions has been clear
from the beginning. They believe sanctions are not effective in the
fight against apartheid. In my view, Britain is as committed as
anyone else to the ending of apartheid.''
   ``We hope that we may persuade the British government to take a
hard look at the financial links with South Africa and the role of
South Africa in loan negotiations,'' he said.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will meet with other leaders of
the Commonwealth of Britain and its former colonies in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, on Oct. 18-24. The meeting is expected to assess the
prospects for reform in South Africa following the general election.
   Britain is the biggest foreign investor in South Africa.
   The Anti-Apartheid Movement in London estimates total direct and
indirect investment in South Africa by British companies at about
$10.24 billion, down from $12.6 billion in 1987. Britain is South
Africa's third-largest trading partner behind Japan and West Germany.
   More than 200 British companies have subsidiaries in South Africa
and the 120 largest employ 230,000 people.
   The largest of the British companies is Consolidated Gold Fields
PLC, with a 38 percent stake in Gold Fields of South Africa, which
mines gold and coal and employs 102,000 people.
   Mrs. Thatcher has said mandatory economic sanctions would hurt
the black population and neighboring black states more than the
governing white minority.
   Later, a rally by about 180 anti-apartheid demonstrators in
Trafalgar Square, near the South African embassy, turned violent
when some tried to sit in the road, Scotland Yard said.
   A spokesman, refusing to be named, said the problems began after
about half the demonstrators broke away from the evening rally to
march across the square to the embassy.
   About 40 then tried to sit in the road, causing police to remove
them, he said. Three people were arrested and one policeman was
taken to the hospital with broken ribs, he said.

   A federal judge ruled Jim Bakker competent
to stand trial on fraud charges Wednesday after a government
psychiatrist testified the PTL founder was not going crazy when he
broke down last week.
   Bakker's trial resumed nearly a week after he was found hiding
under a couch and hallucinating in his lawyer's office last
Thursday. He was sent to a federal prison in Butner for psychiatric
evaluation.
   ``For the first time in three years, the whole situation came
home to him and he began to cry,'' Sally Johnson, chief of
psychiatric services at the prison, told U.S. District Judge Robert
Potter.
   ``He is not going crazy,'' Ms. Johnson testified with jurors
absent. ``He has no hidden mental illness. The stress that he's
feeling is normal. I can't rule it out that it won't happen again,
but I can't rule it in either.''
   Potter ordered Bakker released from federal marshals' custody and
asked Bakker, who was brought to court in leg irons and handcuffs,
to stand and answer questions.
   ``Do you understand what you are on trial here for?'' the judge
asked Bakker, who is accused of fleecing followers of his PTL
ministry.
   ``Yes sir,'' Bakker responded quietly.
   Asked if he was able to assist his lawyers, Bakker said, ``I'm
very tired, but I believe I can.''
   Bakker, 49, showed little emotion, sometimes hanging his head and
staring at the floor. He wore a suit his wife, Tammy Faye, had
brought him.
   Mrs. Bakker, who attended the hearing with other family members,
has protested her husband's treatment at the federal prison hospital.
   ``This should not be allowed in the United States of America,''
was her only comment as she left the courthouse.
   Potter, after meeting with attorneys in chambers, also denied
defense lawyers' motions for a mistrial, for a continuance and for
dismissal of the indictment against Bakker.
   Bakker, who resigned from the PTL ministry in 1987 during a
sex-and-money scandal, went on trial Aug. 28 on conspiracy and fraud
charges. Prosecutors said he used nearly $4 million in ministry
funds to live in high style.
   If convicted on all 24 counts against him, he could could receive
120 years in prison and more than $5 million in fines.
   After Wednesday's lunch break, former PTL Vice President Steve
Nelson, who collapsed under defense cross-examination last
Wednesday, resumed testifying for the prosecution.
   Questioned by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller, Nelson said
he went to Bakker and Richard Dortch, another ex-PTL vice president,
to express his concern over the number of ``lifetime partnerships''
sold at Heritage USA, the Christian retreat and amusement park
created by Bakker.
   Prosecutors contend that Bakker oversold partnerships despite his
statements on TV and in promotional literature that there was a
limit. A $1,000 donation gave a partner free lodging in the 500-room
hotel three nights a year.
   ``I told them we had problems getting people in there,'' Nelson
said. ``I told them we could not sell more. ...'' He said Bakker and
Dortch told him to keep selling the partnerships.
   Dortch, indicted with Bakker, pleaded guilty to four counts of
fraud and conspiracy and was sentenced to eight years in prison and
a $200,000 fine.
   Defense attorney Harold Bender, who was questioning Nelson last
week when the witness fainted, chose not to cross-examine him
Wednesday. In the mistrial motion, Bender said the collapse had
prejudiced the jury against Bakker.
   Bakker appeared more alert during Nelson's testimony. He smiled,
chatted with attorneys and reviewed documents. Mrs. Bakker did not
attend the afternoon session.
   Court was recessed for the day around 5:30 p.m. As Bakker left
the courthouse, he waved at photographers and said, ``I'm glad to be
out of where I was.'' He also said he had the flu, then got into
Bender's BMW sedan and left.
   During the morning session, Ms. Johnson said her preliminary
diagnosis of Bakker was that he had suffered a panic attack after
Nelson's collapse. Nelson had testified that he had told Bakker
someone could go to prison because of the ministry's financial
practices.
   Bakker didn't come to court the next day, and lawyers told Potter
he was hallucinating and hiding his head under a couch at their
office.
   Asked if she thought Bakker had faked his emotional collapse, the
doctor said no.
   ``It was a powerful emotional reaction and release,'' Ms. Johnson
said. ``The weight of all these things began to coalesce. ...
   Ms. Johnson also said Bakker suffered narcissism, or excessive
self-absorption, and depression.
   The psychiatrist said the panic attack was not caused by Bakker's
taking an anti-depressant prescribed by his private psychiatrist,
but could not rule out that it had had an impact on his mental
state. She also testified that Bakker had taken aspirin and is
taking an antibiotic for a cold.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller asked Ms. Johnson if she
felt Bakker was hallucinating when he left court last week.
   ``I did not label it as hallucinatory phenomena,'' she replied.
   She said Bakker told her he hadn't felt well and that radio and
television news crews gathered at the courthouse took on the form of
frightening animals. She said he told her they appeared as ``large
ants with antennae.''
   Ms. Johnson said Bakker insisted he hadn't lost touch with
reality.
   ``He did not lose sight that they were actually the press,'' she
said. ``It was an experience in which he was very frightened and
there was a large number of people in the crowd.''

   Authorities arrested a consul general who
allegedly sold forged Mexican passports and broke up a gang that
smuggled Central American aliens into the United States, officials
said Wednesday.
   The government news agency Notimex said Fidel Alvarez Lopez, the
Mexican consul general in Calexico, Calif., and two unidentified
accomplices were brought Tuesday to the border city of Tijuana under
heavy police escort.
   Notimex did not say when or where they were arrested.
   All three face preliminary charges of forgery and abuse of
authority, the agency said in a dispatch from Tijuana. Alvarez
refused to talk to reporters as he was escorted to jail.
   A spokesman at the Attorney General's Office in Mexico City,
which investigated the case, confirmed the arrest but refused to
give details, saying the probe still had not been completed. The
spokesman spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Notimex said a preliminary investigation showed that Alvarez was
involved in selling the forged passports for $600-700 apiece.
   In a separate case, 10 people were arrested in Tijuana in
connection with a shakedown scheme that preyed on illegal aliens
from Central America trying to sneak into the United States, the
Attorney General's office said in a news release.
   Six of the arrested were Guatemalan citizens, including a brother
and two sisters. The news release said Federal Judicial Police
picked them up as they tried to cross the border into San Diego.
   Officials said the six will be deported to Guatemala.
   Also arrested were a Mexican immigration service officer, a
junior officer trainee, a former immigration officer and a former
judiciary police agent, all of whom demanded bribes of about $100 to
let the aliens travel through Mexico into California, the news
release said.
   The four are held on charges of abuse of authority, accepting
bribes and violating Mexico's immigration laws.
   In recent months, Mexico has stepped up efforts to crack down on
crime along the border, particularly drug trafficking and illegal
migration.
   The crackdown and increased cooperation between U.S. and Mexican
border authorities was announced by President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari after he took office in December.

<HEAD>Jury Finds Honduran Kingpin Guilty in Case Linked to Drug War</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Honduran drug kingpin, whose extradition
triggered deadly riots in his homeland, was convicted of cocaine
smuggling Wednesday in what prosecutors hailed as a victory for the
U.S. war on drugs.
   Prosecutors had called Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, 45, one of
the most significant narcotics traffickers in the world, but his
lawyer portrayed him as a legitimate businessman and the single
largest employer in Honduras before his arrest.
   U.S. District Court jurors found guilty of masterminding a
California drug ring linked to a Colombian cocaine cartel. He was
convicted of one count of conspiracy, one count of running a
continuing criminal enterprise, one count of possession with intent
to distribute cocaine and four counts of distribution of cocaine.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration claimed Matta ran a
narcotics empire worth up to $2 billion. He was accused of
overseeing a network that distributed $72 million worth of cocaine
in Los Angeles.
   ``The conviction of Ballesteros is a major blow to the gangsters
who run the international drug rings,'' Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh said in a statement from Washington.
   Matta's extradition triggered outrage in his homeland and 2,000
demonstrators burned the U.S. Embassy annex. Five Hondurans died in
the disturbances, which lasted a week.
   Matta's lawyer called him a victim of massive publicity
surrounding joint U.S.-Colombian efforts to extradite major drug
kingpins. But U.S. Attorney Gary Feess said: ``He was convicted by
evidence, not publicity.''
   Defense attorney Martin Stolar said he sent a telegram to
President Bush Tuesday urging him to delay his address to the nation
about drugs until the jury returned its verdict. He received no
response.
   ``The cocaine wars and the war against drugs have been front-page
news for three weeks, more than half the length of this trial,''
Stolar said. ``That kind of prejudicial publicity makes it difficult
for a jury to concentrate on what happens in the courtroom.''
   Feess said Matta was the kingpin for a powerful cocaine cartel
based in Cali, Colombia, that funneled thousands of pounds of
cocaine to Arizona and Southern California through Mexico.
   He said Matta's power was comparable to that of Carlos Lehder,
the powerful drug lord convicted earlier this year in Miami. Feess
said Matta was one of the largest drug kingpins ever convicted.
   The charges against Matta stemmed from a September 1981 raid on a
Van Nuys apartment complex that netted $1.9 million in cash and 114
pounds of cocaine _ at that time the largest seizure of the drug in
California history.
   U.S. District Judge Pamela Ann Rymer scheduled sentencing for
Oct. 5. Feess said Matta could be sentenced to a maximum of life
imprisonment without parole.
   Stolar said he would appeal.

<HEAD>Stroh Officials Drops Sponsorship Of Audubon Specials</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of Stroh Brewery Co. said
Wednesday the Detroit-based company was withdrawing its sponsorship
of National Audubon Society television specials but insisted the
action had nothing to do with a threatened boycott by Northwest
loggers.
   ``We sought to keep these issues separate and unrelated,'' Peter
Stroh, said in a statement, adding the decision to drop
underwiriting of the series reflected the company's mounting
financial problems.
   Northwest loggers, upset with an upcoming program on the region's
ancient forests, had begun a loosely-organized campaign in which
they threatened to boycott the brewery's products unless Stroh
dropped its support for the specials.
   Environmental sources, who asked to remain anonymous, had earlier
said that Stroh requested that changes be made in the program,
``Ancient Forests: Rage Over Trees,'' and when the Audubon Society
refused the company decided to drop its $600,000 in underwriting.
   ``It had been the intention of the Stroh Brewery Co. to first
resolve the issue in the Pacific Northwest regarding the upcoming
special before discussing our ability to continue underwriting the
World of Audubon Specials,'' Stroh said.
   Stroh said his company was ``diligently'' looking for financial
partners and ``the fact we were reviewing our sponsorship of these
specials was due to questions raised from our ongoing discussions
with other brewers.
   ``However, in light of the confusion and uncertainty which has
arisen since the issues became intertwined, we have decided it would
be best for us and for the National Audubon Society to announce we
are now going to relinquish our sponsorship of future programs
already produced in order to facilitate the Audubon's search for a
successor sponsor.''
   The timber industry and environmentalists have been locked in a
bitter struggle for months over future logging in the Northwest's
old-growth forests, which provide prime habitat for the northern
spotted owl.
   The Audubon Society is among the environmental groups that have
sought to have the owl protected as a threatened or endangered
species and logging in the ancient forests halted.
   Audubon Society officials have insisted that the special on the
ancient forests, which will be shown on cable television on Sept. 24
and on public television later, was ``fair and balanced.''
   Stroh has provided about half the funding for the four-show
series with the balance coming from Turner Broadcasting System.
   Kirsten White, a Turner spokeswoman, said Wednesday that her
company had also received calls from loggers concerned about the
content of the show.
   White said Turner had no plans to drop the show.
   ``It will still air,'' she said.

   A quadriplegic is entitled to have the ventilator
that keeps him alive modified so that he can shut it off and end his
life at will, a state judge ruled Wednesday.
   Larry McAfee's right to refuse continued life-sustaining medical
treatment outweighs the state's interest in preserving life, ruled
Fulton County Superior Court Judge Edward Johnson after an emotional
45-minute hearing.
   Five family members and two friends testified that McAfee, an
avid sportsman paralyzed from the neck down since a May 1985
motorcycle accident, had repeatedly told them he wanted to die
rather than continue as he is.
   Doctors have said his condition is irreversible.
   Attorney Randall Davis said McAfee, who has been in an Alabama
nursing home since mid-August, will be brought back to an
Atlanta-area apartment.
   There was no immediate indication when he might be returned from
Alabama.
   The judge ordered the state to appeal his decision immediately to
the Georgia Supreme Court but said McAfee does not have to wait on
the court to hear the appeal to be fitted with the switch-off
device, which McAfee designed.
   ``The ventilator to which he is attached is not prolonging his
life; it is prolonging his death,'' said the judge, adding that he
found McAfee to be a rational, competent, intelligent adult capable
of making that decision.
   McAfee had asked that he be given a sedative when he shuts off
the machine and that the court promise that no one will restart the
breathing apparatus.
   A petition filed last month in Fulton County Superior Court
included an affidavit stating ``I understand turning off the
ventilator will result in my death,'' signed by a shaky ``X'' made
with a pencil held in McAfee's mouth.
   Davis said the matter is in the courts to assure that no criminal
or civil challenges arise against those who help McAfee end his life.
   State Attorney General Michael Bowers said last month that
suicide is not a crime in Georgia and that McAfee has a legal right
to refuse medical treatment and that there is no opposing public
interest that overrides those rights.
   McAfee spent a year in a spinal rehabilitation center after his
accident, then seven months in his own apartment with
round-the-clock nursing care until his insurance ran out. Since
then, he has had a struggle finding a home. The only nursing home
his family could find that would take him for what Georgia's
Medicaid program paid was in Ohio.
   He was sent away from there after nursing home officials said he
was verbally abusive. In January, he went to Atlanta's Grady
Memorial Hospital, a public institution that, by law, could not turn
him away.
   He was transferred to a nursing home in Alabaster, Ala., last
month pending a ruling on his petition.

   A Roman Catholic Church commission said
Wednesday more talks are needed to resolve the issue of the convent
at the Auschwitz death camp, which has severely strained relations
with the world's Jews.
   Cardinal Franciszek Macharski, whose archdiocese includes the
camp, has angered Jews by refusing to honor an agreement of Feb. 22,
1987, to move the convent to an interfaith prayer center farther
away.
   In a statement released by the official news agency PAP, the
Commission for Dialogue with Judaism said: ``The conflict around the
Carmelite convent ... has led to an almost complete breakdown of
Christian-Jewish dialogue in the world.
   ``Resumption of dialogue seems impossible without solving this
conflict. All this confirms the urgent need of building the
(interfaith) center. However, we state with regret the idea of the
center has not received appropriate interest and understanding on
the Jewish side.
   ``Taking up talks in the spirit of the Geneva meetings, without
additional conditions, will allow, we trust, the finding of
realistic possibilities of building the center.''
   The commission of clergy and lay intellectuals said, ``There is a
special obligation to take advantage of all possible means to remove
the existing tensions and conflicts'' because of the camp's
significance as a memorial.
   An estimated 4 million people died at Auschwitz, 2.5 million of
them Jews. The Carmelite convent of 14 nuns is in a former theater,
used by the Nazis as a storehouse, just outside the fence.
   Jews say it is deeply offensive to have Chrisitan symbols,
including a tall wooden cross, at a place where millions of Jews
were killed in the Nazi extermination program.
   According to the commission, Cardinal Macharski's statement
refusing to uphold the 1987 agreement was not inconsistent with
previous church positions. It said Macharski felt obliged to act
because polemics and violent protest had become a threat to the
interfaith center.
   In a newspaper interview published Saturday in Italy, Cardinal
Jozef Glemp, Poland's Catholic primate, said he agreed the nuns
should not be moved and indicated he would like more negotiations
with Jewish leaders.
   Theo Klein, who led the Jewish delegation at the Geneva talks,
said renegotiation was out of the question.
   Cardinals Godfried Danneels of Brussels, Jean-Marie Lustiger of
Paris and Albert Decourtray of Lyon, who signed the agreement along
with Macharski, issued a joint statement saying it must be carried
out.

<TEXT>
   Legislation to ease the debt burden of Poland's
new non-communist government and to provide an aid fund of up to
$300 million a year was introduced on Wednesday by Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill.
   The proposal, which is significantly larger than the $100 million
in U.S. assistance proposed earlier this year by President Bush,
also would include $25 million to modernize Poland's telephone
system.
   Simon told the Senate his request is based on conversations in
Poland last year with Solidarity union leader Lech Walesa and other
Polish leaders and officials.
   ``I think it is important that the United States act and act
swiftly and act generously,'' Simon told the Senate. ``If Poland can
shift over to a free-enterprise system, that will affect Hungary and
eventually the Soviet Union as well. It is going to change the
political map of the world.''
   Simon said his proposal would suspend interest on Poland's debt
to U.S. financial institutions for three years and reduce it for an
additional two years.
   Poland, Simon said, has a $39 billion foreign debt, of which some
8 percent is owed to U.S. banks.
   He said diplomatic representatives of at least two other nations
with outstanding loans to Poland have expressed interest in the plan
to ease interest payments.
   The Simon proposal calls for the creation of a revolving fund of
$300 million a year over a three-year period.
   He said $100 million of the total would be earmarked for
agricultural purposes, especially grain production.
   He said the plan includes safeguards permitting the president to
suspend the aid program at any time.
   ``This is not a substitute for Poland facing its own problems,''
Simon said.
   ``But what we have now is a very critical time period in which we
have to move,'' he said. ``America must come through.''

   In Congress' first legislative response to
President Bush's anti-drug campaign, a Senate effort to bolster
treatment programs by cutting funds for congressional mailings was
halted Wednesday by a single senator.
   The measure, proposed by Republicans and accepted by Democrats,
would slash the $80 million pot proposed for congressional mail for
next year to $35 million. The other $45 million would be transferred
to a treatment program for pregnant women addicted to crack cocaine
and other drugs.
   But a vote was blocked by Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who argued
that such a sharp reduction in the mail lawmakers send their
constituents would deprive Alaskans of an important source of news.
Stevens said many Alaskans get no daily newspapers and learn of news
from Washington only from radio and brief television broadcasts.
   ``This is wrong,'' Stevens said. ``This is a nation that has been
kept together by communications.''
   Stevens' objections forced Senate leaders to postpone a vote
until at least Thursday.
   The measure was proposed by Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., a
supporter of tougher efforts against drug abuse, a long-time critic
of the burgeoning costs of legislators' mailings and a candidate for
governor of California.
   ``My purpose is not to denigrate the newsletter,'' Wilson told
his colleagues. ``It is instead to point out that there is a far
more urgent, a far more compelling priority making a claim upon
those same funds.''
   The proposal put Democrats in a difficult position by forcing
them to choose between assisting an anti-drug program serving a
vulnerable segment of society, or maintaining their ability to
pepper their constituents with newsletters.
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., chairman of the Appropriations
legislative subcommittee, said Democrats would accept Wilson's
proposal.
   The proposal was offered as an amendment to legislation providing
$2 billion for Congress' own expenses for the 1990 fiscal year,
which begins Oct. 1. The House version of the bill contains no such
reduction in funds for mailing, and negotiators from the two
chambers will eventually have to decide its fate.
   In his Tuesday evening speech presenting his $7.9 billion drug
campaign, Bush proposed spending $300 million for treatment
programs. He listed initiatives to help pregnant drug users as part
of the effort, but did not specifically say how much should be spent
for them.
   ``As important as newletters may be and notices for town meetings
may be, are they as important as what the president outlined last
night on the war on drugs?'' asked Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan.
   Wilson said that 400,000 babies are born annually in the United
States to drug-addicted mothers.
   The program the money would go to, created in 1988, is supposed
to spend up to $10 million annually for addicted pregnant women,
especially for those who use crack. This year, only $4.5 million has
actually been spent, Wilson said.
   The legislative spending bill is perenially a battleground for
fights between the House and Senate.
   One of those disputes this year is over congressional mailing
costs. The $1.6 billion House version of the bill, approved July 31,
contained $124.7 million for mailing.
   As approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee, the bill
would provide $80 million for congressional mailings: $48 million
for the House and $32 million for the Senate. The House has 435
members, while the Senate has 100.
   The Senate bill would also reduce from six to two the number of
district-wide mailings permitted each year, except for notices of
town meetings. Legislators could send more, but would have to pay
for them out of the funds each receives for general office expenses.
   This year's congressional mail expenses are expected to total
$53.9 million. But traditionally, lawmakers' mailings increase
dramatically in election years, and 1990 is one of those.
   Critics of congressional mailings have argued that they are often
little more than taxpayer-assisted publicity for incumbents.
   The legislation also establishes a health club, which would
include exercise classes, for Senate members and employees.

   The U.S. ambassador to Lebanon
said Wednesday that he is ready to return to Beirut as soon as the
safety of his staff can be guaranteed.
   Ambassador John McCarthy and members of his staff arrived at the
U.S. military's Rhine-Main Air Base outside Frankfurt late Wednesday
on a U.S. Air Force C-130 transport plane from Cyprus.
   Earlier in the day, he and 29 staffers were airlifted from
Beirut, where Christians had threatened to expose the American
diplomats to a ``good dose of Christian terrorism'' for what they
said was U.S. support of Syria.
   At an airport news conference, a weary McCarthy said he left
Lebanon ``with great reluctance.''
   ``It seemed to me that we were doing important work there. The
relationship between us and the Lebanese has always been a very warm
one.''
   But McCarthy said developments in recent days left him little
alternative but to close the facility.
   ``It just seemed to me that in the last several days, it was no
longer possible for me to guarantee to Washington that the safety of
my staff was secure and it was for that reason that we left,''
McCarthy said.
   ``But as soon as those questions of security and safety can be
resolved, it seems to be that it would be important for us to resume
the work that we were doing in Beirut.''
   Asked about the fate of 16 foreign hostages in Lebanon, McCarthy
said, ``One of my considerable regrets is that I had very little
opportunity to make an impact on the hostage situation.
   ``The hostages are held in west Beirut or in other areas in
Lebanon that are basically closed to me and have been for some time.
   ``We would once in a while pick up the odd rumor, but aside from
that, we were not in a good position to do very much for the
hostages,'' the ambassador said.
   The hostages held in Lebanon included eight Americans.
Longest-held is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   McCarthy said he and the embassy staff had worked hard to close
the facility when word came to evacuate.
   ``We spent all last night trying to clear the embassy _ about 10
hours _ putting things away, destroying things,'' the ambassador
told reporters.
   About 1,000 Christians massed outside the embassy to protest what
they said was U.S. support of Syria. That country entered Lebanon in
1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate but later sided with
Moslems in the 14-year-old sectarian civil war.
   It is the first time an American ambassador has been pulled from
Lebanon since the civil war began. The move at least temporarily
ended the American diplomatic presence in the country.
   The ambassador and his staff were first flown to Britain's
Akrotiri air base in nearby Cyprus. They are expected to leave for
the United States on Thursday.

   Financially strapped federal agencies lack the
staff and equipment to handle a major oil spill in the Great Lakes
and plans for such an emergency are weak, experts told a Senate
panel Wednesday.
   The government also is doing a poor job of preventing and
cleaning up the hundreds of smaller oil and toxic chemical leaks
that pollute the Great Lakes each year, witnesses told the
Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government
Management.
   The subcommittee launched an investigation of the federal
government's handling of Great Lakes spills in the wake of the March
24 Exxon Valdez disaster off the Alaskan coast. Sen. Carl Levin,
D-Mich., the subcommittee chairman, said the lakes situation was
disquieting.
   ``The Great Lakes are far more vulnerable to spills than most
people realize, and there are far more inadequacies in our spill
response and prevention capabilities than we can or should
tolerate,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the
subcommittee.
   The question is whether enough well-trained people and equipment
can be transported to a major spill quickly enough to contain it,
said David F. Hales, director of the Michigan Department of Natural
Resources.
   ``I'm afraid ... the answer is that we are not prepared,'' Hales
said.
   The largest tankers on the lakes hold only 120,000 barrels, less
than 9 percent of what the Exxon Valdez carried, Hales acknowledged.
But Levin and other witnesses said a spill from such a vessel could
be just as damaging because the lakes are less capable of dispersing
pollutants than the oceans.
   ``The Great Lakes are a closed system _ a bathtub whose waters
can take hundreds of years to leave the system,'' Levin said.
   Hales criticized the oil industry for announcing plans to open
five emergency response centers for oil spills along the ocean
coasts, but none along the lakes.
   The American Petroleum Institute said in a statement its New York
response office would handle Great Lakes spills. ``Equipment from
the ... center could be rapidly airlifted to any Great Lakes port,''
the statement said.
   An increase in spills in recent years has occurred simultaneously
with Environmental Protection Agency cutbacks on inspections of
onshore oil storage facilities and the Coast Guard's 50 percent cut
in marine safety and environmental protection programs since 1980,
Levin said.
   There were 401 oil and chemical spills in the lakes in 1986, 384
in 1987 and 492 in 1988. Some were large, such as the 1984 discharge
of 1 million gallons of fuel oil from a storage tank in New York and
a 1984 spill of 200,000 gallons of toxic ammonia from a Michigan
industrial plant.

<HEAD>Hurricane Gabrielle Makes Waves in the East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Gabrielle curved northward and away from the U.S.
mainland on Wednesday, but the storm's 130-mph winds helped produce
waves up to 13 feet high along sections of the East Coast.
   Thunderstorms continued along much of the south Atlantic and Gulf
coasts, and showers and thunderstorms swept over sections of the
Midwest, bringing heavy rain to the Kansas City area during the
morning rush hour.
   Winds were gusty over Utah and behind a front over the northern
High Plains. Sunny skies prevailed across most of the West and
partly cloudy skies predominated in the East.
   The hurricane, which threatened to sideswipe Bermuda, was about
540 miles southeast of the island Wednesday evening. It was moving
north northwest at 14 mph, and was expected to turn more to the
north Thursday, keeping it well away from the coast.
   The storm combined with a high-pressure system south of Canada's
Maritime Provinces to generate 5- to 13-foot swells from Maryland to
Florida, forecasters said. Heavy surf advisories were up from New
Jersey to North Carolina, and North Carolina's Outer Banks were
under a coastal flood warning.
   The Southern thunderstorms were most numerous in southest Texas
and much of Lousiana. A section between Lavaca and Indianola, Texas,
reported more than 2{ inches of rain in just one hour Wednesday
morning.
   Showers and thunderstorms fell from northeast Missouri to
southeast Iowa, northern Illinois and southern Michigan. The Kansas
City area received nearly 2 inches of rain during the morning rush.
Almost 2{ inches fell in Moline, Ill., from 1 a.m. to 1 p.m. CDT.
   Winds gusted to 30 mph behind a cold front extending from eastern
North Dakota to southern Wyoming and northern Nevada, and winds were
gusty over southern Wyoming and Utah. Gusts of 47 mph were clocked
in Cedar City, Utah.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 49
degrees in Hailey, Idaho, to 105 degrees in Imperial, Calif. The low
for the Lower 48 states was 31 degrees in Gunnison, Colo.
   The forecast for Thursday called for showers and thunderstorms
from south central Texas to the Gulf Coast and Florida, scattered
showers and thunderstorms from Kansas, Nebraska and eastern sections
of the Dakotas to the upper Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes
region and the central and southern Applachians; and rain showers in
the northern High Plains.
   High temperatures were expected in the 60s in the northern
Rockies, in the 90s in Florida, the lower Mississippi Valley, the
southern half of the Great Plains, much of New Mexico and
California's inland valleys; 100 to 110 degrees in the Big Bend
region of southwest Texas and the desert Southwest; and in the 70s
and 80s elsewhere.

<HEAD>Army Arrests 27 Palestinians Without ID Cards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army has arrested 27 Palestinians for
illegally crossing into Israel since new identity cards were first
distributed in the occupied Gaza Strip three months ago, an army
spokesman said Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, the military commander of the Gaza Strip said violence
is increasing in the Israeli-occupied territory.
   In the Gaza Strip, eight Palestinians were shot and wounded in
clashes with soldiers, hospital officials said. The army said it was
investigating the reports and confirmed two wounded in a West Bank
village.
   At least 558 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops or
civilians since the uprising against Israeli rule of the occupied
territories began in December 1987. Thirty-nine Israelis have died
in the violence.
   Also Wednesday, an opposition member of Parliament asked Israel's
attorney general to ensure that the computerized identity cards are
not used for collective punishment.
   The army spokesman said the Arabs detained for crossing into
Israel without cards were given the choice of paying a $250 fine or
spending two months in prison. Israel radio said one Palestinian was
acquitted.
   The plastic cards are only issued to Gazans who have paid their
taxes and passed security checks.
   Israel says they are necessary to improve security, but
Palestinian leaders say they undercut Arabs' ability to work in
Israel. An estimated 50,000 Gazans hold jobs in Israel.
   The cards have sparked a political tug of war, with Palestinian
activists sometimes collecting the cards by force and burning them.
   Army radio said over the past four days, an average of 5,000 to
10,000 Palestinians have crossed daily from Gaza into Israel, about
one-quarter the total before the new cards were issued.
   The radio said it was unclear whether workers were intimidated by
Palestinian activists or were sleeping in Israel instead of
commuting.
   Meanwhile, the army commander for Gaza, Maj. Gen. Matan Vilnai,
said violence has increased in Gaza and that the uprising has
changed from mass demonstrations to hit-and-run attacks by masked
Palestinians.
   The masked youths enforce uprising directives and often kill
fellow Arabs suspected of collaborating with Israel. At least 108
Palestinians have been killed in this way.
   ``We are meeting them more and more and attacking them more and
more,'' Vilnai said on Army radio.
   In a strongly worded letter, Dedi Zucker of the left-wing
Citizens Rights Movement called for strict controls ``so that the
cards are used for legitimate security purposes and not for
collective punishment and collective sanctions.''
   He asked Attorney General Yosef Harish to rule on whether Gazans
denied the new cards by the army could be blocked from entering
Israel to visit hospitalized relatives or prisoners.
   Zucker also asked whether troops could ban entry to Arab workers
from a village if they wanted to punish the community for activities
stemming from the 20-month-old uprising against Israeli rule.
   In the West Bank town of Tulkarem, Arab residents said seven
Israeli security men, disguised as uprising activists arrested two
brothers in a raid Tuesday night.
   The brothers were identified as Issam and Samir El Sarougi. Arab
reports said Issam had been wanted for anti-Israeli activities the
past year.

   West German businessmen and
bankers told Solidarity leader Lech Walesa on Wednesday they are
willing to help revive Poland's economy, but said the Poles want too
much too soon.
   Walesa said he understood the caution, but renewed his appeal for
more West German investment.
   ``The banking experts at the moment still have reservations
because the conditions in my country are not good,'' he said to
journalists after meeting with the Eastern Committee, an influential
industry organization that coordinates business dealings in the East
bloc.
   Walesa said he told the committee: ``We want to work intensely
with you. We want to invite you to help build ... a different
economic system.''
   Otto Wolff von Amerongen, head of the Eastern Committee, said,
however, that ``wishes on the Polish side'' for a comprehensive
program of new credits cannot be met.
   In London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's office said she had
urged the United States, West Germany and France to give Poland more
support. A spokesman said she sent messages to President Bush,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand saying:
   ``There is a historic opportunity for the West to help Poland's
reforms succeed and demonstrate that a country can successfully make
the transition from communism and from an entirely state-run
economy.''
   Wolff, the Eastern Committee chairman, told journalists ``all
relevant political forces in Poland should themselves reach a
consensus over the necessary program to cure the economy.''
   ``Western capital aid should only be one element'' of the
program, he said, adding that the new, Solidarity-led government
cannot expect quick investment by West Germans because of the huge
financial risk involved while Poland is overhauling its its economy.
   ``Changing over from one system to another is more difficult than
starting from scratch, as is the case here,'' Wolff said. ``It would
be an illusion to believe this could be achieved quickly.''
   Nonetheless, Wolff promised Walesa he could count on West German
assistance in rebuilding the Polish economy.
   He said his committee would be consulting with Polish joint
venture specialists about ways to improve their country's investment
climate.
   Walesa arrived in West Germany on Tuesday for five days of talks
with politicians and businesspeople to center on economic aid and
reform in Poland.
   Poland's economy suffers from widespread shortages, more than 100
percent annual inflation, a $39 billion foreign debt, and
unprofitable and outmoded industries.
   Earlier in the day, in a speech to labor union officials, Walesa
appealed to Western countries to ease terms of Poland's foreign debt.
   He also said Solidarity is under tremendous pressure from the
Polish people now that it controls the government.
   ``Our country is a total economic catastrophe,'' Walesa said in a
speech before the national coordinating committee of the powerful
German Federation of Labor Unions.
   Since Solidarity activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki became the East
bloc's first non-Communist government leader last month, Poles have
turned their hopes for improved living standards to the trade union.
   ``Some doubt whether Solidarity really has an economic program. I
want to give these people an answer. We know full well what we are
striving for,'' he said.
   Before Walesa spoke, Ernst Breit, chairman of the Federation of
Labor Unions, called on the West German government to make a quick
decision on financial assistance for Poland.
   Referring to Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland 50 years ago that
started World War II, Breit said, ``Germans have a moral
responsibility to take the leading role in helping Poland achieve
economic stability.''

<TEXT>
   The House on Wednesday approved the spending of
up to $529 million next year for ocean and coastal programs, far
more than President Bush had asked for the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.
   The measure, sent to the Senate on a 343-44 vote, included $197
million for research, nearly double Bush's request for the fiscal
year that begins Oct. 1, and $173 million for coastal managment,
mapping and pollution monitoring.
   The research money includes $64 million for the Sea Grant program
and $14 million for the National Undersea Research program, neither
of which was funded in Bush's budget request. Another $8 million was
authorized for Great Lakes water quality and environmental research.
   On a voice vote, the lawmakers added a provision authorizing $54
million over the next five years to build a marine research center
in Baltimore, Md.
   In separate action, the House also provided $2.6 billion over the
next three years for the National Weather Service, a new nationwide
network of Doppler weather radar systems, and research into how to
improve prediction of tornadoes and hurricanes, acid rain, ozone
depletion and climate change. The vote on that measure was 380 to 1.
   Of that amount, $866 million is for operation of the Landsat
satellite program, the Geostationary satellite system and the polar
orbiting satellite program.

   Georgia's 156-year-old law that makes it a
felony for a husband and wife to engage in sodomy cannot be applied
to consenting married couples, a judge ruled Wednesday.
   ``Government has no business with a married couple's private
consensual sexual practices,'' wrote DeKalb County Superior Court
Judge Robert Castellani.
   In his five-page decision, Castellani said James D. Moseley had
been imprisoned illegally more than 18 months after being convicted
for violating that law.
   Moseley, 35, a carpenter, had been sentenced to two years. He was
ordered released on bond by Castellani last week pending his
decision.
   ``This court believes the petitioner's right to marital and
domestic privacy has been violated by the sodomy law as applied to
him,'' Castellani wrote.
   Moseley had been charged with two counts of rape, two counts of
aggravated oral sodomy and two counts of aggravated anal sodomy in
February 1988 after his common-law wife, Bette Roberts, filed
complaints against him, saying he had forced himself on her after
they were separated.
   He denied using force but testified that the couple had engaged
in oral sex with Ms. Roberts' consent. He was acquitted on five
counts but was convicted on a lesser charge of oral sodomy.
   Castellani noted that during recent U.S. Supreme Court
considerations that upheld application of the sodomy law against
homosexuals, both the majority analysis and state Attorney General
Michael Bowers ``recognize the problems in applying this law to
married consenting couples.''
   ``Insofar as (the judge) holds as a matter of law that the sodomy
statute can't be applied to a married couple, that ... is exactly
what we had said,'' Bowers said Wednesday.
   But he said a decision on whether to appeal the ruling would be
delayed until he has a chance to examine it fully.
   The state had argued that Moseley should remain in jail because
``the record ... supports an inference the victim did not consent to
the sodomy,'' Castellani wrote. But the judge said the jury's
acquittal of Moseley on the rape and aggravated sodomy charges meant
it decided no force had been involved.
   ``We're very pleased with (the) decision. Our client is now
free,'' said Julie Edelson, one of the American Civil Liberties
Union lawyers who argued Moseley's case in court.
   Moseley could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Telephone
messages left for him with the ACLU were not returned.
   He had said last week that Ms. Roberts had filed charges against
him as part of a lengthy domestic dispute.
   ``I only did what she wanted me to do, and then she used it
against me to get custody of the kids,'' he said. He said he was
granted no visiting rights to see his sons.
   Ms. Roberts responded by repeating her assertions that Moseley
forced himself on her.

<HEAD>Attorney General Declines To Meet With Washington Mayor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh will not meet
with Mayor Marion Barry to discuss news leaks in a grand jury probe
into Barry's ties to a convicted drug dealer, a spokesman for
Thornburgh said on Wednesday.
   ``It's not appropriate for the attorney general to meet with him
at this time,'' Thornburgh spokesman David Runkel said.
   He declined to elaborate.
   Barry, angered over news reports that former city employee
Charles Lewis has told prosecutors he and Barry smoked crack cocaine
together, had said he wanted to meet with Thornburgh to ask him to
investigate alleged Justice Department leaks to the news media.
   Thornburgh's refusal to meet with Barry is the second legal
disappointment for the mayor in as many days. On Tuesday, U.S.
Attorney Jay B. Stephens said that he is forbidden by law from
releasing Barry's testimony before a federal grand jury
investigating his ties to Lewis.
   Barry, who spent more than five hours testifying on his visits to
Lewis' hotel room last December, had sought to release the testimony
in an effort to prove that he had truthfully denied using drugs with
Lewis.
   Barry has steadfastly maintained he is not the target or the
subject of the Lewis probe, but Stephens cited a law that bars the
testimony of potential witnesses from being released prior to a
trial.
   Barry spokeswoman Lurma Rackley said the mayor has not received a
formal denial from Thornburgh on their proposed meeting and will not
comment until he has.
   Thornburgh is already investigating whether Justice officials
leaked information on a preliminary FBI investigation into alleged
payroll irregularities in the office of Rep. William H. Gray III,
D-Pa.
   The news reports, which came in late May as Gray was positioning
himself to run for House Democratic whip, prompted Gray to charge
that the leaks had been politically motivated.
   Thornburgh promptly wrote a letter to Gray telling him the matter
would be investigated, although he rejected Gray's request that an
independent prosecutor be appointed to look into the matter.
   Gray ultimately was elected to the whip's post, which is the
third-ranking House leadership post, while Justice officials are
still trying to determine the source of the news leaks.
   Stephens has already asked the Justice Department to investigate
whether the reports on Lewis were leaked from his office.

   Police said they arrested 116 British
soccer fans who rampaged through Stockholm's shopping district
Wednesday before a World Cup qualifying match.
   Police Inspector Gunnar Skold said 71 other people were arrested,
including four Britons, outside Rasunda Stadium during and after the
Sweden-England game, which ended in a 0-0 tie. One of those arrested
was hospitalized.
   ``It was less than we had expected,'' Police Superintendent Sture
Hoglund told Swedish television.
   Hoglund said about 1,000 British fans watched the game at the
stadium from a separate standing area and no incidents were reported.
   Skold told The Associated Press the fans seized in downtown
Stockholm probably would not have been admitted to the game in any
event because most of them had no tickets and appeared drunk.
   The rowdies, apparently teen-agers for the most part, ran through
the shopping area shouting abuse, slapping passers-by and ripping
clothing from stores' outside display racks. Police with riot
shields gave chase and scuffled with them.
   Skold said the arrested Britons would be sent home as soon as
possible.
   Scattered incidents of brawling and vandalism were reported
earlier in restaurants and on trains, as about 2,000 visitors
filtered through the city awaiting the match.
   The Swedes had prepared for a dose of British soccer hooliganism
after one fan drowned Monday when he jumped overboard from a ferry
in the North Sea that was bringing hundreds of fans to Stockholm.
British police said he was under the influence of drugs and panicked
when companions sprayed him with a fire extinguisher.
   British soccer clubs were banned from playing in European club
competition after their fans were blamed for a 1986 riot-sparked
stampede in Belgium that killed 39 specators, mainly Italians. The
ban did not apply to the national team.
   Wednesday's events in Stockholm could affect a decision earlier
this year by the UEFA, the French-based European soccer clubs'
governing body, to readmit the British clubs next year if
troublemakers are brought under control.
   Security was unprecedented for a Swedish sporting event. Police
assigned 600 officers to the stadium in suburban Stockholm, and
Swedish Radio said authorities were ready to stop the match if
trouble broke out.
   The Swedish Football Association said that at the request of its
British counterpart, it withheld nearly 4,000 tickets it normally
would have put on sale in Britain.
   ``The (British) FA told us they didn't want any tickets sold in
England because of the trouble with hooligans when England has
played in other countries abroad,'' said Lena Linborg, the
association's ticket manager.
   Specators were to subjected to body searches, and television
cameras were placed to monitor the crowd. Riot fences surrounded the
stadium.
   Five Britons were arrested Monday after they rampaged through a
restaurant. Three were released and two were held on charges of
assault and causing serious damage.
   On Wednesday, about 20 fans helped themselves to beer at a
self-service cafe without paying. One was apprehended by a patrolman
and the rest fled.
   Ferry companies and travel agencies refused to accept group
bookings from Britain to Sweden preceding the match. The Tudor Arms,
which claims to be the only English pub in Stockholm, closed its
doors to avoid trouble.
   ``Everybody recognizes there is a problem with the hooligans in
England,'' the British charge d'affaires, Brian Austin, said in a
radio interview.
   Austin, responding to calls in the Swedish media to expel the
British soccer fans, said it is difficult to distinguish between
``people who want to see the match and who genuinely like football,
and the other sort.''

   Leon `Pop' Williams, a nationally known

   Williams, 79, was killed about 12:30 p.m. in an accident with a
tractor-trailer rig on Interstate 55 west of McComb and was
pronounced dead at the scene, the state Highway Patrol said.
   Williams of Smithville, Miss., was best known for managing his

<HEAD>Opposition Squabbling Over Vice Presidential Candidate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A split in the main opposition bloc
appeared to widen Wednesday over the choice of a former Sandinista
labor minister as its vice presidential candidate in February
elections.
   The National Opposition Union asked the Supreme Electoral Council
to extend by two weeks the Friday deadline for applying for legal
recognition as a bloc, Silviano Matamoros of the National
Conservative Party said Tuesday.
   The request indicated the coalition was not sure how many of its
14 parties, ranging from communists to conservatives, would stick
together for the Feb. 25, 1990, general election.
   Since the Opposition Union picked its ticket on Saturday, the
leading topic for radio talk shows, television and newspapers has
been the choice of politician Virgilio Godoy over businessman
Enrique Bolanos.
   Few people have disputed the choice of Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro, publisher of the opposition newspaper La Prensa, as the
Opposition Union's presidential candidate.
   How the discord is resolved will greatly influence, if not
determine, the election results. Only a united opposition could
unseat the Sandinista government.
   None of the 20 opposition Nicaraguan parties could
single-handedly win a race. Three parties outside the Opposition
Union have announced their own candidates but their power is
considered negligible.
   President Daniel Ortega is expected to run for re-election but
the government has yet to announce its ticket.
   The two figures at the center of the Opposition Union feud are
trying to avoid a split.
   Godoy, an able politician, is lobbying all sides trying to glue
the bloc back together.
   Bolanos is avoiding the public light.
   When asked to comment on the Opposition Union infighting, Bolanos
said: ``It's not prudent. My opinion is of no import at this time.
... I'm simply observing, nothing more.''
   He said he might speak publicly on Friday during ``Free
Enterprise Day,'' designated by the Superior Council of Private
Enterprise. He is a former president of the council.
   Godoy, president of the Independent Liberal Party, said he was
talking to various parties ``to see how we can contribute to avoid''
further squabbling.
   ``I think we'll be able to overcome this (so) that the blood
won't reach the river,'' Godoy said.
   Cracks in the Opposition Union began to show late Saturday, just
minutes after Godoy was chosen with Mrs. Chamorro. The ticket
obtained 10 votes out of a possible 14.
   Leaders of three parties abstaining left the meeting after the
final vote. One party's ballot was annulled.
   On Tuesday, Matamoros said the Opposition Union's politicial
council was reviewing the votes because there was a dispute over the
way a fifth party marked its ballot.
   Godoy is linked to an unpopular system of salary levels created
while he was labor minister from 1979 to 1984.
   The business community felt wages for workers were too high,
professionals thought their salaries were too low and most people
thought the issue was best decided between employer and employee.
   Godoy was thought to balance the ticket with Mrs. Chamorro, whose
membership in the Nicaraguan aristocracy pleases conservatives.
   But some have said Godoy's politics are too far to the left.

   Rescue helicopters on Wednesday
airlifted to safety the survivors of a Varig jetliner that
crash-landed in the Amazon rain forest, killing at least 10 of the
54 people aboard.
   ``It's incredible that we came out alive,'' said Regia Acevedo,
who was thrown from the plane Sunday night with her husband when the
Boeing 737-200 went down about 1,050 miles northwest of Rio de
Janeiro.
   The plane ``seemed to bounce'' when it first hit the tops of
100-foot trees, survivors said. It cut a 120-foot by 300-foot swath
through the jungle and both wings were ripped off but the fuselage
remained nearly intact, they said.
   ``It was as if a giant claw had scratched the body of the plane.
First there was a deafening screech and then a silence, and then
absolute darkness,'' said Ms. Acevedo, 29.
   ``I thought, `My God, I'm going to die!'' said Jose Maria
Gadelha. ``Suddenly there was a flash of lightning, I lost
consciousness, and when I woke up I was outside the plane and
alive.''
   ``We were ready to die but the hand of God guided our descent,''
said Epaminondas de Sousa Chaves, 36, one of four people who walked
through the jungle to a remote ranch Tuesday to report the location
of the plane.
   Medical teams first reached the crash site Tuesday night, but
officials decided to wait until first light Wednesday to start
removing survivors.
   The survivors were taken 28 miles to a ranch, where a
Brazilian-made, twin-engine Bandeirante plane took off from a dirt
airstrip and flew to the Serra do Cachimbo air force base, 185 miles
away in neighboring Para state, said an air force spokesman, Col.
Jose Maria dos Santos.
   He said two passengers died Wednesday, bringing the death count
to 10. He said a man trapped in the wreckage died Wednesday morning,
while a woman airlifted from the crash site died later on a rescue
plane en route to Brasilia.
   Passenger Marinez Coimbra said those killed were sitting closest
to the cockpit. ``Those in the front suffered the worst,'' she said
in a televised interview.
   Six people were in serious condition.
   The plane disappeared Sunday after taking off from Maraba on the
last leg of a regularly scheduled flight between the southeastern
city of Sao Paulo and Belem.
   An Air Force Ministry spokesman, Col. Ronaldo Borges, said the
pilot had reported problems in the navigational system and the plane
strayed far off course.
   Epaminondas de Sousa Chaves said the plane had been flying in
circles for 90 minutes before the crash.
   ``The captain ... said that he was having trouble finding
Belem,'' he said. ``I got nervous then and started praying.''
   ``Minutes later, with a calm voice, the pilot asked for
forgiveness and told us ... we had 15 minutes of fuel left and he
couldn't see a single clear spot in the jungle.
   ``Suddenly, the engines shut down and I don't know if 10, 15 or
one minute passed. It was agony.''
   The Brazilian airline did not give the cause of the accident.
Varig president Helio Smidt did not rule out a navigational error,
but said, ``We shouldn't jump to quick conclusions.''

   A mortar-fired grenade broke a window in
the government telecommunications company building and injured a
woman who was working inside, a company spokesman said Wednesday.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, the 26th in a
seven-week-old wave of violence that has claimed at least four lives.
   Francisco Ramirez, manager of the company, Guatel, said the
grenade was fired from about 100 yards away and struck the third
floor of the building, where international telephone offices are
located.
   Delfina Ramirez de Ruiz, 30, suffered minor injuries. About 50
other employees in the office escaped injury, he said.
   Two people have been killed and 20 injured in the attacks on
buildings. Danilo Barillas, 49, a leader of the Christian Democratic
Party, was assassinated Aug. 1 and banker Ramiro Castillo Love was
killed Aug. 24.
   Leftist guerrillas, fighting for 27 years to overthrow
Guatemala's military or military-dominated governments, attack
sporadically in the provinces. The country also has a history of
terrorism by far-right groups.

   Italian police arrested a member of the Abu Nidal
terrorist group during a major sweep aimed at breaking up remnants
of the Italian Red Brigades, authorities said Wednesday.
   Khalid Hassan Hussein Birawi Thamer was one of 11 people arrested
in the month-old operation against the Red Brigades that has
involved both Italian and French police.
   Thamer, 29, a Jordanian, was arrested Tuesday in Rome, police
said. Three Italians believed to be Red Brigades members were also
arrested Tuesday, police said at a news conference Wednesday.
   Thamer was arrested at Frankfurt airport in February 1985 with 23
pounds of explosives, as well as detonators and falsified documents
identical to those used in attacks by the Abu Nidal Palestinian
group.
   He was extradited to Italy on charges of involvement in Abu Nidal
assaults, but authorities released him from prison in August 1988.
   Abu Nidal's group has been blamed for more than 100 attacks
across Europe, Asia and the Middle East since 1972.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, split from Yasser
Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization in 1973.
   Police did not clarify the alleged connection between Thamer and
the Red Brigades, a leftist group that carried out scores of violent
attacks in the 1970s and early 1980s aimed at toppling the Italian
government.
   Thamer and the three Italians arrested Tuesday were charged with
subversive association and participation in an outlawed group,
police said.
   The Italians were identified as Caterina Calia, 29, detained in
Rome; Riccardo Maria Antonini, 37, arrested in the northern city of
Viareggio; and Alberto Marino, 23, detained in Cesa in southern
Italy.

<TEXT>
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa on
Wednesday asked security forces to restrain themselves when dealing
with Sinhalese extremists who are trying to topple his government,
officials said.
   ``In other words, the president told the military and police not
to shoot first, treat those arrested under law, and win the
confidence of people,'' the government officials said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Opposition politicians, human rights groups and residents accuse
the military of killing hundreds of civilians during crackdowns on
extremists of the People's Liberation Front. The government denies
it, but senior officials privately admit killings by pro-government
vigilante groups.
   Premadasa's appeal came at a meeting in Colombo with senior
military, police and intelligence officers, the officials said.
   ``Premadasa advised them to act firmly against terrorism, but to
always remember they are dealing with their own brothers and
sisters,'' they said.
   The officials said the meeting was called to brief officers on a
proposed meeting of all political parties on Sept. 13 aimed at
resolving this island nation's ethnic troubles.
   Premadasa invited the Front to the meeting. It has not yet
responded. The ultranationalist group rejected earlier government
peace offers.
   Military officials said Wednesday that in the latest crackdown,
security forces arrested 224 suspected Front members since Monday
and that 153 militants surrendered.
   The arrests were made in central and southern Sri Lanka, the
Sinhalese heartland where the militant campaign is centered.
   The northeast is ravaged by a Tamil insurgency for an independent
nation that the government tried to end with an India-sponsored
peace accord in 1987.
   The accord, supervised by Indian peacekeeping troops, angered the
Sinhalese militants, who complained it conceded too much to the
minority Tamils. They began a violent campaign that the government
says has claimed 5,000 lives. The militants also said the Indian
presence compromised Sri Lanka's independence.
   The 6-year-old Tamil war has killed 11,000 more people, including
1,000 Indian soldiers.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, say they are discriminated in jobs
and education by the mainly Buddhist Sinhalese majority.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people, the
Sinhalese 75 percent.
   India became involved because of political pressures from its own
60 million Tamils, most of whom live in southern Tamil Nadu state. A
narrow strip of sea separates Tamil Nadu from Sri Lanka.

<HEAD>Woman Testifies She Killed Lesbian Lover in Self Defense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman on trial for the murder of
her lesbian lover testified Wednesday that she shot to death her
companion of 11 years to defend herself from abuse.
   The so-called ``battered spouse'' syndrome is being used by
defense attorneys in the first-degree murder trial of Annette Green,
the first time in which the psychological state has been applied to
a lesbian case, attorneys say.
   ``I never wanted to do anything to her. I never wanted to hurt
her,'' Ms. Green testified. ``I was just trying to defend myself.''
   Ms. Green, 30, had been beaten and tormented for years before she
fired a single shot from a .38-caliber pistol into the head of her
live-in lover Ivonne Julio, 32, last October, defense attorney
William Lasley contends.
   Palm Beach Circuit Judge Tom Waddell ruled Tuesday to allow the
battered spouse defense in the lesbian case, saying the type of
relationship made no difference.
   The defense has been used successfully before to excuse women who
killed their male lovers.
   Neighbors, friends and co-workers have testified that Ms. Green
often was beaten viciously by Ms. Julio, and suffered broken bones,
bruises and black eyes. They said the fatal shooting followed a
night of arguing between the couple at a Halloween party.
   Ms. Green testified that after the shooting she was shocked at
what she had done and even considered suicide.
   ``I had the gun to my head,'' she testified. ``Why did I have the
gun to my head? I was going to kill myself ... because I loved her.''
   Mary Ann Dutton-Douglas, a psychologist at Nova University in
Fort Lauderdale who specializes in battered women cases, testified
Tuesday that the shooting should be interpreted as a response to
years of abuse.
   ``I believe that she was trying to figure a way out of the
situation,'' Ms. Dutton-Douglas said. ``But she was backed into a
corner.''
   Earlier efforts by Ms. Green to leave failed because Ms. Julio
would find her at work or win her back by promising to change, Ms.
Dutton-Douglas said.
   ``Leaving didn't mean her partner would leave her alone,'' Ms.
Dutton-Douglas said.
   Assistant State Attorney Robert Johnson questioned the
reliability of Ms. Dutton-Douglas' conclusions, suggesting that Ms.
Green could have falsified answers to psychological tests to appear
to be suffering from the syndrome.
   Closing arguments are scheduled for Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Two protesters swinging on ropes from a
building and about 50 other animal rights activists called on H.J.
Heinz Co. on Wednesday to stop buying Pacific Ocean tuna caught in
nets that also ensare dolphins.
   Heinz Chairman Anthony J. F. O'Reilly said his company wants to
save dolphins, too, and will spend more than $100,000 on research to
keep the mammals out of tuna nets.
   The protesters, led by the San Francisco-based Earth Island
Institute, picketed Heinz's annual shareholders meeting at a
downtown hotel, chanting, ``Boycott tuna. Boycott Heinz.''
   Two protesters lowered themselves from a nearby eight-story
building and unfurled a banner reading, ``Heinz, Stop Killing
Dolphins,'' before police arrested them on disorderly conduct,
trespassing and criminal mischief charges.
   Another protester briefly disrupted the shareholders meeting by
screaming, ``You're slaughtering dolphins. What kind of world do you
want to live in?''
   Protesters and company officials agreed that thousands of
dolphins are being killed when they school with yellowfin tuna in
the eastern Pacific Ocean and are caught in large, encircling nets
set mostly by foreign fishermen.
   Protesters claimed a boycott of tuna products has hurt Heinz's
StarKist Seafood Co. subsidiary and other tuna producers. But Heinz,
in its first-quarter earnings report issued Tuesday, credited tuna
sales with contributing to a 15 percent increase in earnings.
   O'Reilly told shareholders the killing of dolphins was a
legitimate concern. ``We're doing everything we can to save the
porpoise,'' O'Reilly said.
   He said a new $100,000 research program, announced by StarKist on
Thursday, promises to find ways of using sound to lure dolphins away
or out of nets.
   None of about 3,000 Heinz shareholders at the meeting questioned
O'Reilly about the dolphin issue.

   The family of a sailor implicated in the April
19 turret explosion aboard the USS Iowa hopes to clear his name in
court.
   A Navy investigation into the April 19 explosion in the
battleship's No. 2 gun turret found foreign material in the
immediate area of the blast, according to sources familiar with the
Navy's report to be made public Thursday.
   The sources said ``an unlawful and illegal act'' by gunner's mate
Clayton Hartwig is pinpointed in the Navy's report as the probable
cause of the blast.
   Kathy Kubicina, Hartwig's sister and the Hartwig family's
spokeswoman on the investigation, expects lawyers representing the
family to file a lawsuit after the report is released, but she would
not provide details of the legal plans Wednesday night.
   She said the Navy has promised to send an official to brief the
family Thursday morning.
   The family hired lawyers June 1. Two lawyers held a briefing Aug.
3 outside the federal courthouse in Cleveland, during which they
outlined the Hartwig case.
   At that briefing, lawyer Krieg Brusnahan said Hartwig had no role
in the Iowa disaster, adding: ``We have a possible theory as to the
cause of the blast that we will release after the Navy's report has
been released.''
   ``This is nothing I didn't expect,'' Ms. Kubicina said from her
residence Wednesday night. ``I fully expected the Navy to try and
pin this on my brother. ...
   ``It makes me wonder where the Navy investigation would have
turned to if I hadn't written the letters to the officers aboard the
Iowa in seeking help.''
   She contacted Iowa officers after learning about an insurance
policy Hartwig held that named Iowa crewman Kendall Truitt as
beneficiary. She said her brother and Truitt had been close friends
but their friendship had waned.
   ``I now know the (Naval Investigative Service) conducts witch
hunts for homosexuality in the Navy,'' she said. ``But then, I just
wanted Ken to turn the money over to my parents, and I wrote the
officers for help. I guess they gave the letters to the NIS.
   ``I knew there was nothing legally we could do (about the
insurance policy). I thought they would be able to persuade him,
because Truitt and my brother were no longer friends.''
   Ms. Kubicina has said her brother, to the best of her knowledge,
was not a homosexual. She previously has released romantic letters
he wrote to a woman she knows.
   ``None of the guys on the Iowa believe my brother blew up the
turret,'' she said. ``As far as I'm concerned, the report is another
hurdle for us to get over. We are definitely filing suit.''

<HEAD>President Cristiani Says Salvador Peace Talks Begin Next Week</HEAD>

   President Alfredo Cristiani said
Wednesday that the government and leftist rebels will begin peace
talks next week, the first such talks in two years.
   He told a news conference his government accepted a rebel
proposal made Tuesday that first exchanges be held in Mexico between
Sunday and Sept. 14. But he cautioned the contacts would be
essentially preparatory.
   Marxist-led rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front have waged an insurrection for nearly 10 years against a
series of U.S.-backed governments. The war has killed an estimated
70,000 people, mostly civilians.
   ``This meeting next week is to make the preparations for and
provide the beginning of a dialogue process, and it is not something
from which substantive conclusions and accords are going to emerge.
It is to come to agreement in general terms on how to carry out the
process within which substantive subjects will be addressed,'' he
said.
   Cristiani said contacts in coming days would determine exactly
when and where the talks would take place.
   Cristiani, a rightist who took office June 1, said he would swear
in the government commission to the talks Thursday. He declined to
identify members, but leaks have indicated the delegation will
include two Cabinet ministers.
   The government and rebels held two rounds of unsuccessful peace
talks in 1984 and further talks in October 1987.
   ``The time has passed for propagandistic or tactical dialogue,''
the president said. He said the new talks will have the serious aim
of finding peace and incorporating the rebels ``in the peaceful life
of the country.''
   Rebel commander Ana Guadalupe Martinez said in Mexico on Tuesday
that the guerrillas want Monsignor Arturo Rivera Damas, the Roman
Catholic archbishop of San Salvador, to be moderator for the talks.
   Rivera Damas is touring Europe and the United States until
mid-September, and Cristiani said his participation in initial
exchanges ``is physically impossible.''
   The rebels have also insisted that delegates from the
Organization of American States and United Nations be present.
   Talks with the government of former President Jose Napoleon
Duarte, a centrist Christian Democrat, failed to advance the search
for peace.

   An undercover U.S. Border Patrol agent was
shot to death and his partner wounded Wednesday while posing as
employers offering cash for an illegal alien farmhand, investigators
said.
   The smugglers opened fire on the agents as they tried to make
arrests at a convenience store parking lot in Fresno, police said.
Four people were arrested after authorities sealed off the
residential neighborhood and searched on foot and with a helicopter.
   The dead agent was identified as Keith Connelly, 42. Agent Ted
Jordan, shot in the chest, was in serious condition at a hospital,
authorities said.
   The two had arranged through an informant to make the swap at the
convenience store, said chief U.S. Border Patrol Agent J. William
Carter. The informant did not tell agents that the smugglers would
be armed, Carter said.
   The informant was the illegal alien with whom the agents first
made contact on Saturday. He was among those arrested.
   ``The exchange would have been that our agents would have
consummated the deal by paying the smugglers a fee'' of about $500
for a farm laborer, Carter said. ``The deal went sour about 1:40
a.m.''
   One of the downed agents fired at the suspects before backup
agents arrived and began shooting, Carter said.
   Two suspects sped off in a station wagon, and two others ran in
opposite directions, said Sgt. Jerry Dyer, head of a SWAT team that
sealed off the area. It was not known if any suspects were shot, but
Dyer said one was bleeding.
   The suspects' car, with a shattered window and a bullet hole in
the driver's door, was abandoned a few blocks away. A .357-caliber
Magnum revolver and a .380-caliber automatic were recovered, Carter
said.
   Residents, awakened by helicopter spotlights and SWAT officers
combing the neighborhood, said they saw the suspects climbing over
fences and running between bushes.
   ``God, what a night of hell,'' said Mark Dawson, 22. ``I was
awake. I couldn't sleep, and I heard all the gunshots. One of them
came through the back yard. I saw him climbing up over the telephone
pole in the backyard corner near my fence.''
   Police arrested Rosura Rodriguez, 22, of Los Angeles hiding near
the shooting scene less than an hour later, and two other suspects
were captured by 5 a.m. The final suspect was dragged out of a side
yard around 7:20 a.m., witnesses said.
   The other suspects were identified as Lorenzo Macias Arreola, 41,
and Florentino Nunez Mujica, 31, both of Los Angeles, and Albert
Serrano Saldana, 18, of Costa Mesa. Carter would not say which one
was the informant.
   All four were booked on suspicion of murder and other,
unspecified charges.

<DATELINE>SUVA, Fiji (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 16-member team of American aviation
historians arrived Wednesday hoping to solve the riddle of where
Amelia Earhart disappeared on her 1937 attempt to make the first
trans-Pacific flight.
   The International Group of Historic Aircraft Recovery based in
Wilmington, Del., plans to leave Suva on Monday for two remote
islands in the South Pacific hoping to find evidence that Earhart
crashed there.
   The group, led by Richard Gillespie, has chartered a converted
Japanese trawler, the 125-feet, 100-ton Pacific Nomad, to reach the
Phoenix Islands of McKean and Nikumaroro in the Kiribati
archipelago, 1,000 miles northeast of Fiji.
   U.S. Embassy official Robert Benzinger said the group had
``fairly persuasive'' evidence that Earhart went down much further
eastward than previously thought.
   ``The group is arriving with very thorough, well-documented
research,'' said Benzinger. ``They have two basic theories about
where Earhart crashed, and if they find the evidence it will be
sensational.''
   Meanwhile, an Australian woman pilot, Gaby Kennard, is attempting
to fly solo around the world in a single-engine plane as a tribute
to Earhart, whose exploits achieved legendary status in the United
States.
   Kennard, a 44-year-old mother of two, flew this week to Atchison,
Kan., Earhart's hometown. Kennard is a member of the 99 Association
of Women Pilots, which Earhart founded.
   She expects to complete the journey to Australia via Europe, the
Middle East and Asia later this month.
   Benzinger said that the government of Kiribati, a group of 33
islands straddling the equator, gave permission for the month-long
expedition.
   Kiribati, formerly the Gilbert and Ellice islands, was a major
battleground during World War II and has a population of about
61,000.
   Theories abound about why Earhart crashed after setting off for
Howland Island in 1937 from Wau, Papua New Guinea, to the north of
Australia.
   Howland lies north of the Phoenix Islands and has an airstrip
that Earhart had planned to use as a refuelling stop on the flight
to Hawaii with a navigator.
   Various theories suggest Earhart crashed on the then-Japanese
controlled Marshall Islands in Micronesia and that she was executed
after stumbling onto a military base.
   Benzinger, himself an amateur aviation hobbyist, said the
American expedition hopes to show that Earhart crashed much further
eastward, about 1,500 miles east of the islands then controlled by
Japan.
   ``There are two theories,'' he said. ``The first one requires
that you assume the plane was extremely off-course to the north,
which would mean the plane carried at least two more hours worth of
fuel than was previously thought.
   ``If you put yourself in the navigator's position of trying to
reach Howland Island and not making it, you would try to find the
nearest logical place to put the plane down and that would include
McKean and Nikumaroro atolls.''
   Benzinger said that research by the Americans shows that the U.S.
Coast Guard in Hawaii received distress signals from the plane after
it crashed and that the SOS now had been pinpointed approximately to
McKean and Nikumaroro.
   Benzinger, who has been in constant touch with the group, said
the expedition believes Earhart and her navigator died from thirst
or injuries some days after the crash. The wreckage of the plane
probably has been swept away by a hurricane, he said.
   McKean is a half-mile long, about 800 yards wide and only 17 feet
high. Nikumaroro, also known as Gardener, has a rim of land a
quarter-mile-wide around its V-shaped lagoon. Both islands are
uninhabited.
   Benzinger said the expedition was equipped with diving gear and a
sidescan sonar system which might detect wreckage of Earhart's plane.

   Reputed Medellin cocaine cartel money launderer
Eduardo Martinez Romero was flown Wednesday night by U.S. officials
out of Colombia bound for the United States, an administration
official disclosed.
   Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Frank Shults said,
``He's in the air; coming into the United States sometime in the
early morning.''
   Martinez was flown out of Bogota on a DEA plane, Shults said.
   Shults did not say where the plane would land, but the U.S.
Marshal in Atlanta, Lynn Duncan, said Martinez was bound for Atlanta.
   ``All I can tell you is he'll be at the federal building tomorrow
(Thursday),'' said Duncan, who added that he did not know what time
Martinez would appear in U.S. District Court.
   Martinez faces charges arising from an allegedly illegal
money-laundering operation.
   Duncan would not say where the airplane carrying Martinez would
land. ``For security reasons, I can't answer that right now,'' said
Duncan.
   Martinez was arrested during the first weekend after Colombia
President Virgilio Barco launched a crackdown on drug traffickers in
his country triggered by the Aug. 18 assassination of leading
presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan, an outspoken foe of the
drug trade.
   The Bogota newspaper El Tiempo quoted Martinez after his arrest
as saying he was innocent.
   ``At no time have I had links to the Medellin cartel and I don't
know any of its members,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying.
   In the emergency measures imposed by Barco was a re-institution
of the extradition agreement with the United States that had been
thrown out by the Colombian Supreme Court in 1987.
   Martinez, 35, was indicted in March in Atlanta as a result of an
investigation code-named ``Operation Polar Cap'' that federal
officials said revealed an operation that laundered billions of
dollars in cocaine profits through U.S. and foreign banks. Charges
were brought against 127 people and two Latin American as a result
of that investigation.
   Drug traffickers in Colombia, who supply an estimated 80 percent
of the cocaine consumed in the United States, are said to fear
extradition to the United States because they believe they will not
be able to escape conviction and prison sentences.
   In response to Barco's crackdown, the traffickers declared
``total war'' on the government and have carried out bombings and
shootings in Medellin, home of the world's largest drug cartel and
the second largest city in the country, and in Bogota, the largest
and the capital.
   The last trafficker to be extradited was Carlos Lehder, a leader
of the Medellin cartel who was sent to the United States in early
1987 and is serving as life sentence in the federal prison in
Marion, Ill.
   The day the indictments were announced, Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh said Martinez was holed up in a bank in Panama surrounded
by the Panamian Defense Forces who were there to arrest him.
However, Martinez escaped from the bank later in the day.
   The Panamanian Defense Forces are led by Gen. Manuel Anonio
Noriega who has been indicted in Florida on drug-trafficking charges.
   Martinez was not on the list of the dozen most wanted Colombians
issued by Thornburgh last month, but he was already in custody at
the time. The list includes leaders of the Medellin and Cali cartels.
   The U.S government responded to the outbreak of violence in
Colombia by sending $65 million equipment and other aid _ airplanes,
helicopters and vehicles _ as well as military advisers to the South
American country.
   In addition, plans were accelerated to send some $2.5 million
worth of help to protect Colombia judges, dozens of whom have been
killed by drug gangs.
   In his national drug control strategy announced Tuesday night,
Bush said military and law enforcement aid to the three main cocaine
producing countries _ Colombia, Peru and Bolivia _ would increase
from an estimated $53 million this year to $261 million next year.
The administration also promised an additional $2 billion over the
following five years to the three countries if they demonstrated
their comitment to cracking down on drugs.
   ``We have a responsibility not to leave our brave friends in
Colombia to fight alone,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>Judge Grants Sir Rudolf Bing Annulment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state judge on Wednesday granted an annulment
to former Metropolitan Opera impresario Sir Rudolf Bing over the
objections of his mentally ill wife, ending their 33-month marriage.
   The 87-year-old Bing, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, and
Carroll Douglass, 50, had lost touch with reality, their attorneys
told Judge Carmen Ciparick.
   Bing is in a nursing home and Ms. Douglass is hospitalized in a
psychiatric ward.
   Ciparick also denied Ms. Douglass any part of the Bing estate or
alimony, said her attorney, Harvey Sladkus.
   The judge ordered Bing's estate to pay the expenses for Ms.
Douglass' hospitalization for mental problems last summer, Sladkus
said.
   ``I haven't spoken with her yet, but we can still go before the
appellate court or make a motion to re-appeal,'' said Sladkus. Ms.
Douglass' sister and brother in Washington will also confer on the
next legal move, Sladkus said.
   Bing's attorney, Paul Goldhamer, said he was gratified by the
judge's decision, but was sorry it took so long. The annulment trial
began in May 1988 and closing arguments were made March 15.
   ``Time is certainly not on Sir Rudolf's side,'' Goldhamer said.
``It's a great tragedy that could only have happened under these
peculiar circumstances.''
   Bing's legal guardian, Paul C. Guth, was on vacation and was not
available for comment.
   Attorneys for Bing, the opera's general manager for 22 years, had
claimed he was mentally incompetent and had no idea what he was
doing when he married Ms. Douglass on Jan. 9, 1987, in a civil
ceremony in Arlington, Va.
   Almost half the couple's marriage was spent in court.
   During the annulment trial, a psychiatrist testified that Bing
was suffering from Alzheimer's disease and did not recall being
married.
   Ms. Douglass was hospitalized last August after she ``lost touch
with reality,'' her lawyer said.
   Goldhamer charged that Ms. Douglass had abused her husband
verbally and physically during the early part of their marriage.
   Ms. Douglass' erratic behavior during the trial compelled
Ciparick to bar her from seeing Bing for six hours each day.
   Earlier this year, Bing was forced to sell off a Grandma Moses
painting worth more than $35,000 to cover the cost of the nursing
home.
   Goldhamer said his client's funds were depleted because Bing had
to hire guards to keep Ms. Douglass away.

<TEXT>
   Courts-martial are scheduled for
six men charged in Operation Punchout, a 2{-year undercover probe
culminating with the theft of three F-16 jet engines from the base,
the Air Force said Wednesday.
   The announcement marked the first word of additional charges in
the case since three people were indicted for the engine thefts
almost two months ago.
   The investigation was expected to result in prosecution of more
than 100 people, federal authorities said at first. But on Wednesday
the Air Force said there are more than 260 suspects in thefts from
military bases in the West and Southwest.
   In all, 54 of the suspects worked or formerly worked at Hill, the
Air Force said. Three of the suspects were civilians at the time of
their alleged crimes.
   The Air Force said courts-martial were scheduled for the
following men:
   _ Staff Sgt. Joseph A. Damato, 25, of Sleepy Hollow, Ill.,
charged with unlawfully selling military property worth $894. His
trial is set for Sept. 28.
   _ Tech. Sgt. David A. Jaeger, 31, of Laona, Wis., charged with
selling property worth $577. His trial is Oct. 5.
   _ Staff Sgt. Timothy M. Eastabrook, 28, of Inez, Texas, charged
with selling and stealing military property worth $5,304. His trial
is Sept. 21.
   _ Staff Sgt. James J. Mathews, 30, of Sanford, Fla., charged with
selling property worth $131. His trial is Sept. 13.
   _ Tech. Sgt. Michael J. Tarancon, 33, of Milpitas, Calif.,
charged with selling property worth $39. His trial is Sept. 15.
   _ Sgt. Jeffrey A. Moses, 22, of Boss, Mo., charged with selling
property worth $575. His trial is Sept. 12.
   Hill's legal office said it expected to conduct at least seven
courts-martial in the 29 cases it is handling.
   The other 22 cases are considered minor, the Air Force said, and
are being disposed of out of court through procedures including
commanders' reprimands. About half of those cases already have been
concluded.
   By agreement with the Air Force, the U.S. Attorney's office in
Salt Lake City will handle the cases of three Hill civilians and
military personnel who were discharged prior to announcement of
Operation Punchout.
   The U.S. attorney also will handle the cases of five of the 34
servicemen still at Hill.

   Back in the days when a sneaker was a smelly
construction of canvas and rubber, statisticians told us the typical
American household had 2.5 children.
   Now, that's the average number of pairs of athletic shoes owned
by every man, woman and teen-ager in the United States, according to
a nationwide study by a sportswear trade group.
   The Athletic Footwear Association said it also discovered that
while some consumers are troubled by the escalating prices for
athletic shoes, comfort is still the top priority amid the space-age
designs and physics-lab features that have pushed the prices of many
top brands over $100.
   ``For a long time _ and in the last 10 years in particular _ the
whole idea about sneakers has heen evolving,'' said Gregg Hartley, a
spokesman for the North Palm Beach-based group. ``Today, it's
recognized that there are different sneakers for different sports,
but they can be fashionable, too.''
   The ``sneaker revolution'' has also altered our vocabulary, said
Hartley. The generic sneaker has been replaced by classifications
such as running shoes, aerobic shoes and even mall-walking shoes.
   ``Just about the only thing called sneakers these days is a $7.99
pair found in a discount store,'' he said.
   The six-month survey of 1,200 people, which began in November and
was released Tuesday by the footwear association, which represents
more than 100 manufacturers worldwide. The survey had a margin of
error of plus or minus 2 percent.
   Athletic shoe sales have grown about 15 percent a year and now
comprise about 40 percent of the total footwear sales in the United
States. About half of the $9 billion U.S. market is shared by Nike
Inc. and Reebok International Inc.
   The study found that young black males are the top sneaker
buyers, with an average of 4.8 pairs. Adults 18 to 35 were next with
an average of 4.1 pairs. Older adults owned 1.4 pairs on average.
   Men paid an average of $34 a pair and women spent $26, according
to the survey.
   Although 83 percent of all respondents said comfort was the
principal factor in buying an athletic shoe, teen-agers put fashion
first.
   The study found that 93 percent of all Americans over 12 own at
least one pair of athletic shoes.

   The government on Wednesday put a
$250,000 price tag on the heads of Colombia's top two reputed
cocaine cartel bosses, and a U.S. official said a reputed drug
financier was extradited to the United States.
   Eduardo Martinez Romero was flown Wednesday night on a DEA plane
out of Colombia bound for the United States, said Drug Enforcement
Administration official Frank Shults.
   ``He's in the air; coming into the United States sometime in the
early morning,'' Shults said from Washington. Another U.S. official
said Martinez was being flown to Atlanta to appear before the U.S.
District Court.
   ``All I can tell you is he'll be at the federal building tomorrow
(Thursday),'' said U.S. Marshal Lynn Duncan in Atlanta.
   U.S. and Colombian officials in Bogota declined comment late
Wednesday on the reported extradition, the first since Colombia
declared war on drug traffickers 2{ weeks ago.
   U.S. officials in this capital, speaking on condition of
anonymity, have predicted even greater bloodshed in this
violence-wracked country if anyone is extradited because the cartel
has warned it would kill 10 Colombian judges for each person sent
out. Drug traffickers in particular fear extradition.
   The last Colombian trafficker to be extradited was Carlos Lehder,
a leader of the Medellin cartel who was sent to the United States in
early 1987 and is serving a life sentence in the federal prison in
Marion, Ill.
   Martinez, 35, was indicted in Atlanta as a result of an
investigation code-named Operation Polar Cap that federal official
said disclosed at least $1.2 billion in money laundering of cocaine
profits through U.S. and foreign banks.
   Martinez had faced summarry extradition under emergency measurres
since his arrest Aug. 20. Barco ordered his ``administrative
extradition'' to the United States.
   The Justice Ministry announced on national TV that the reward on
Pablo Escobar and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha would be paid to anyone
providing information leading to the arrest of one or both men, and
showed ``wanted'' posters of the two.
   The television later reported without elaboration that Martinez
had been extradited.
   Escobar and Rodriguez Gacha, now in hiding, are also wanted in
the United States. Both are said to be billionaires and were on the
list of the 12 most wanted Colombians that was issued last month by
the U.S. government. Martinez was not on that list.
   The government also announced that under present emergency
legislation in the fierce anti-narcotics fight it can, if necessary,
fire mayors and place cities under temporary military control. This
could happen, a proclamation said, in case of ``abnormal
situations.''
   President Virgilio Barco on Wednesday thanked President Bush for
backing Colombia in its drug war, but said the United States and
other developed countries with lots of drug users have more to
answer for than cocaine-producing Colombia.
   Bush on Tuesday night announced a $7.9 billion war on drugs and
said specifically that Colombia will get U.S. anti-drug aid.
   ``This is a very favorable start,'' Barco said in a statement
responding to Bush's announcement.
   ``Colombia certainly needs international help so it can fight its
own battle against internationally organized drug trafficking.''
   He added, however, that such help, including possible military
support mentioned by Bush, ``cannot be a substitute for the
responsibility each nation has for controlling the various links in
this criminal chain.''
   The Colombian president said that ending drug use ``is a
responsibility of the whole international community. We hope that
other countries assume the responsibility that corresponds to them.''
   A Defense Ministry spokesman in Bogota said police and soldiers
had made more than 2,042 raids since Aug. 18, when Barco invoked
emergency powers after the assassination of Sen. Luis Carlos Galan,
the leading presidential candidate and an outspoken foe of the drug
lords.
   The United States has a list of 12 so-called ``Extraditables,''
the men said to be Colombia's most important drug kingpins. All but
economist Martinez are at large. Cartel bosses said they would
rather die in Colombia than go to jail in the United States.
   Acting Justice Minister Carlos Lemos said Wednesday this South
American country cannot fight the drug barons successfully unless
the United States, the world's biggest cocaine consumer, curbs its
appetite.
   Bush made the same point Tuesday night.
   The Defense Ministry said police and soldiers had seized 880
properties, including some palatial estates, and hundreds of
vehicles and aircraft in its war on narcotics traffickers.
   Police in Medellin, home of the most powerful cocaine cartel,
said they were searching for a couple suspected in the latest
bombing in the cartel's counterattack _ an explosion in a restaurant
that injured four people, including two U.S. journalists.
   Colombians reacted favorably to Bush's speech, and the country's
largest newspaper said an editorial Thursday would carry the
headline, ``We Are Not Alone.''
   In addition to the hundreds of homes, office buildings and other
real estate believed owned by cocaine barons, authorities had
confiscated 1,190 weapons, more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition,
499 vehicles, 48 boats and 358 aircraft, the Defense Ministry
spokesman said..
   He said more raids and seizures were taking place daily. By
custom, the spokesman's name was withheld.
   Violence in Colombia continued Wednesday. Two men shot and killed
Luz Amparo Gomez, 30, a lawyer, on Bogota's north side, police said.
   Ms. Gomez had defended a local politician who had been wounded in
a fight involving the smuggling of Colombian emeralds.

<HEAD>Chinese Leader Sees Lingering Threats of Subversion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng said his government
cannot lift martial law because of lingering threats of subversion
and infiltration from foreign countries, a French newspaper reported
Wednesday.
   In an interview with the conservative daily Le Figaro, Li said
the People's Liberation Army troops in Beijing must assist police
with the ``latent dangers'' from subversives and armed infiltrators.
   Li characterized the Communist regime as ``stable'' and declared
that China would continue reforms to modernize its economy despite
sanctions imposed by Western governments in response to the
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in June.
   ``We think that these types of sanctions are harmful to the
Western countries also,'' he was quoted as saying during the
two-hour interview Friday. ``If your capitalists want to lose the
Chinese market, they can. It's their business.''
   The newspaper said Li cited ongoing joint ventures with French
and British firms as evidence that Western investors have adopted a
more realistic line toward China than their governments since a
military assault June 3-4 ended six weeks of student-led protest
against the Communist Party leadership.
   Li was quoted as saying that 18.5 percent annual inflation,
corruption in the party and uneven distribution of wealth led to the
protests. The government is taking measures to correct the
imbalances and end nepotism, he said.
   But Li asserted that ``dissatisfaction and rebellion should be
separated,'' Le Figaro said. While suggesting clemency for
demonstrators not involved in ``looting, arson, homicide or violence
against the military,'' Li ruled out a general amnesty, it said.
   Dismissing Western condemnation of human rights violations
committed during the crackdown, Li accused two of his leading
critics _ France and the United States _ of ignoring human rights
during different periods in their histories, Le Figaro said.
   ``Before the arrival of the Europeans, there were Indians in
America,'' Li was quoted as saying. ``Where have they gone now? They
have been parked on reservations. For those people, where are human
rights?''
   Li also accused television of distorting the truth, especially in
the widely viewed image of a lone man blocking a column of tanks on
a Peking street.
   ``This image made President Bush say that this man was really
extraordinary,'' Li was quoted as saying. ``But there is another
explanation. If we examine this scene objectively, doesn't it
demonstrate the humanity of the Chinese army and record the
gentleness of the commander?
   ``As if a man could stop a tank by himself!''

<HEAD>Judge Defers Decision on Philadelphia Request for More Funds for
Retarded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE LINDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state-forced cutback in a program for 4,000
mentally retarded Philadelphians living with relatives threatens
them with the prospect of ``regression and institutionalization,''
the city argued in court Wednesday.
   State officials countered that they merely allocate money that
the Legislature provides _ in this case, a $7.5 million shortfall in
the state's allocation for a city program of vocational education,
day care and therapy.
   Commonwealth Judge James Crumlish Jr. did not say when he would
rule on the city's request for an injunction against Gov. Robert
Casey and Public Welfare Secretary John White.
   The city's lawsuit contends that until the programs are restored,
the retarded will suffer ``irreparable harm (and) risk regression
and possible institutionalization.''
   ``We contend that state law provides that those persons who got
the services before should continue to get them,'' said Deputy City
Solicitor Richard Gold said.
   Leona Fialkowski was one of two mothers who testified that the
cutback already has hurt their children.
   ``We are starting to see regression in David in his efforts in
walking and self-help,'' said the woman, whose son is 27. ``He needs
attention to maintain what he has.''
   The city successfully challenged a state cutback in court last
fiscal year, but earlier this year, a federal appeals court held
that the U.S. Constitution does not give the retarded the right to
the same level of treatment provided institutionalized patients.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals court acknowledged that its
ruling could force more people into hospitals at greater cost to
taxpayers.
   According to testimony at Wednesday's hearing, about $20 million
of a total of $120 million for the state was allocated to
Philadelphia. By state law, the state must pay 90 percent of the
cost of services for the retarded.
   Assistant Attorney General Gwen Mosley, representing the
defendants, said she does not doubt Philadelphia needs more money,
but questioned whether the city is entitled to it under the law.
   ``We say it is not,'' she said. ``We can allocate only what is
appropriated by the Legislature, and we must distribute it fairly.''
   Joseph Gueltier, director of the state Bureau of Mental
Retardation, said Philadelphia has about 14 percent of the state's
total population and is getting about 18 percent of the money
allocated for non-residential programs.
   Attorney David Ferleger disagreed. ``These people have the right
to these services, and the state must fund it,'' he said. ``The
state has intentionally underfunded Philadelphia year after year
after year.''
   Ferleger represents the Philadelphia Police and Firemen
Association for Handicapped Children, which joined the city's
lawsuit.
   If Crumlish rules for the city, Ferleger said he will ask the
judge to expand the program to all retarded people living at home in
Philadelphia, affecting an additional 3,800.
   ``We aim to give people with retardation and their families a
chance to have a normal life in their own homes, instead of being
forced by the state into large institutions which will be the result
if the shortfall continues,'' he said.
   ``Nobody needs an institution when they can live in their own
home.''
   The expansion would cost the state $30 million, Ferleger said.

   Hurricane Gabrielle veered northward in the Atlantic
on Wednesday, taking its 130 mph winds away from the U.S. mainland,
but threatening to sideswipe the island of Bermuda.
   Gabrielle lashed the seas all the way to the East Coast, forming
swells of 5 to 13 feet from Maryland to Florida, said Bob Sheets,
director of the National Hurricane Center.
   ``We have a very large wind field around this hurricane,'' Sheets
said. ``It's generating swells over almost the entire western
Atlantic.''
   Winds 40 mph or higher stretched 550 miles across the storm's
path as it curved to the north out in the mid-Atlantic, forecasters
said.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Gabrielle's center was near 27 degrees north
latitude and 60 degrees west longitude, or about 460 miles southeast
of Bermuda. It was heading north northwest at 15 mph, and was
expected to turn more to the north by Thursday.
   Gabrielle is the largest and most powerful hurricane of the
season, rating just below last year's Hurricane Gilbert, which
ravaged the Caribbean with its 155 mph winds.
   Sheets cautioned that Gabrielle's course could not be predicted
with precision, but said it appeared the hurricane would graze
Bermuda by Friday with tropical storm-strength winds.
   ``They may not get the core of it at all, but they are already
getting 15- to 20-foot swells,'' he said. ``They'll get some
showers, some winds, and definitely some surf problems.''
   Minor flooding was reported in beachside areas of the eastern
Caribbean island of Barbados as Gabrielle passed Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, far to the north, Felix maintained its status as a
minimal hurricane, with winds of 75 mph. The storm was drifting
slowly out in the Atlantic, and was no threat to land, forecasters
said.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Felix's center was near 37.5 degree north
latitude and 47.5 degrees west longitude, or about 850 miles from
the westernmost Azores.
   Satellite pictures indicated that Felix was drifting toward the
north northeast at less than 5 mph.
   Felix was the sixth and Gabrielle the seventh named storms of the
1989 Atlantic hurricane season. Storms are named when their winds
reach 39 mph, and are classified as hurricanes when they grow to 74
mph.

   President Bush is embarking on a public
relations campaign to sell his ``block by block, child by child''
war on drugs, but Democrats complain the $7.9 billion program
doesn't go far enough and relies on cuts in other federal programs
for financing.
   In his first prime-time address to the nation Tuesday night, the
president held up a bag of crack seized across the street from the
White House and declared drugs the ``gravest domestic threat facing
our nation.'' But he said, ``We can pay for this fight ... without
raising taxes or adding to the budget deficit.''
   Bush called for expanded treatment and education programs, but he
also urged the country to demonstrate ``zero tolerance for casual
drug use'' and repeated his support for harsh penalties on users as
well as dealers.

   Researchers found reassuring evidence that birth
control pills haven't raised the breast cancer risk for middle-age
women. Now, they are starting a major new study to see if that's
true for a younger generation.
   Birth control pills became available in the early 1960s, and
women now in their mid-40s and 50s typically began using the pill
when they were in their mid-20s or beyond.
   Since then, however, millions of American women have begun taking
the pill while still in their teens. Troubling data has begun to
emerge that these people may be at substantially higher than usual
risk of breast cancer.

   Congress should consider lowering the $100,000
federal deposit insurance limit now that the savings and loan
industry bailout is in place, the chairman of the House Banking
Committee says.
   The S&amp;L bill, signed into law Aug. 9 by President Bush, directs
the Treasury Department to finish a study of the deposit insurance
issue in 18 months. But Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of
the banking panel, says action may be needed sooner. ``They've had
studies galore. ... The pressure on the deposit insurance fund
continues,'' he said Tuesday in an interview with The Associated
Press.
   Although stressing that he wants to hear testimony on the issue
before making up his mind, Gonzalez said he currently favors
reducing the maximum insurance coverage from $100,000 and limiting
the number of insured accounts per depositor.

   The Bush administration, in a move to break a

support for a proposal by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for
holding Palestinian elections, U.S. officials say.
   Among the 10-point proposal's key elements are provisions for
voting by Palestinian residents of Jerusalem and for the temporary
withdrawal of Israeli troops from voting areas throughout the West
Bank and in Gaza. ``This is a start,'' an official said Tuesday.
``It's the kind of thing we need.''

   Salvadoran rebels have discarded previous
conditions and accepted an offer by Salvador's new rightist
president to hold talks aimed at ending the country's 10-year-old
civil war, proposing they begin next week.
   ``We're taking away practically all obstacles,'' Ana Guadalupe
Martinez, a rebel commander, told a Mexico City news conference on
Tuesday.
   There was no immediate response from the Salvadoran government,
but it did announce a 48-hour cease-fire to begin Sept. 14 and
coincide with the celebration of Central America's independence from
Spain in 1821. If the Salvadoran government agrees to peace talks,
it would be the first meeting between representatives of the
belligerents since President Alfredo Cristiani took office June 1
and called for peace talks.

   Four illustrators and a historian are
capturing the flavor of Plains, the friendly town that gained world
renown in 1976 when Americans elected a peanut farmer to serve as
their 39th president.
   Under a program known as the Historic American Building Survey,
the five have been working since June 12, studying and sketching
historic buildings that eventually may be included in the Jimmy
Carter National Historic Site.
   ``It's a privilege to work on this project,'' said architect John
Westberg of Tempe, Ariz. ``He's making a difference on this planet.
He seems less concerned about his own life than what he can do for
other people.''
   Westberg, 35, the team's leader, said residents have been helpful
and seem to appreciate the efforts to preserve the town's heritage.
The five were chosen from hundreds of applicants and are paid by the
National Park Service. Their headquarters is an apartment next to
the one Carter and his young wife, Rosalynn, rented in 1953 when he
returned from the Navy.
   They have attended Sunday Bible classes given by the former
president and met with the Carters at the couple's home on Church
Street. They've spent weeks taking precise measurements of Carter's
high school, his boyhood home in nearby Archery, a former store
operated by the Carter family, the apartment, and the century-old
depot that served as Carter's 1976 campaign headquarters.
   The Park Service already owns the depot and high school, but is
negotiating for the boyhood home and store. The Carters have donated
their home, but will continue to live in it.
   From photographs and sketches, Westberg and three others will
prepare detailed ink drawings of the five buildings for the National
Archives. The Carter home was not included in the building survey.
   ``It takes a lot of care,'' said Dana Peak, as she inked a
cornice of the high school. ``The drawings may be scrutinized by a
lot of people,'' Westberg said. ``It's very important that they be
accurate.''
   Ms. Peak, a June graduate of the University of California, Davis,
said there's a strong feeling of community in the Sumter County town
of 650. ``The people have been friendly and supportive.''
   ``The people are very enthusiastic about the Jimmy Carter
Historic Site,'' agreed architect Jason Breyer, 25, of Fargo, N.D.
   Dale Waldron, 21, of Preston, Conn., a student at the Rhode
Island School of Design, said he welcomed an opportunity to meet the
former president. ``I found him very open. He's very visible. He
goes to a lot of meetings.''
   The fifth team member, historian Elizabeth Barthold of Crofton,
Md., spends her time interviewing residents and wading through real
estate records at the Sumter County Courthouse in Americus.
   ``People here are really proud of Plains and they want to
share,'' she said. ``They feel it is special and they're interested
in having it recorded.''
   Ms. Barthold is preparing reports on 23 historic buildings in
Plains, including the five that are to become a part of the National
Historic Site. She also is studying a pond house that belonged to
Miss Lillian, the president's mother, a former hospital where Carter
was born and a service station made famous by the president's late
brother, Billy Carter.
   ``At first I was so amazed that Jimmy Carter, president of the
United States, came from here. But the Carters are just incredible
people.''
   Ms. Barthold was impressed by the functional design of the old
homes. They sit on brick pillars for ventilation and protection from
moisture. Many have high steep roofs, high ceilings and hallways
running through their entire length for more efficient cooling on
hot summer days.
   Westberg said the high school is typical of hundreds built during
the 1920s with a central entrance, wings on each side and an
auditorium in the back.
   ``It's disintegrating fast,'' he said. ``Water has gotten into
the outside walls and it's rotting the floor and ceiling away.''
   The Park Service runs a museum in the depot and has earmarked
$200,000 to preserve the high school. About 4,000 tourists visit the
town each month, just a fraction of the multitudes who flocked here
during the Carter presidency.
   Westberg and the others will remain in Plains through Friday. All
their work, including rough sketches, ink drawings and reports, will
become a part of the official history of Plains, maintained by the
National Archives.

   Tarnation, thar's Bat and Wyatt and young
Maverick and The Rifleman's son and a whole passel of Western stars
on the two-hour season premiere of ``Paradise'' on CBS.
   ``I was very excited about playing Bat Masterson again after 25
years,'' said Gene Barry, who comes to the rescue of Ethan Allen
Cord (Lee Horsley) with Hugh O'Brian returning as Wyatt Earp.
   The two-hour show on Sunday is a roundup of old Western stars.
Barry played the cane-carrying dandy in NBC's ``Bat Masterson'' from
1959 to '61. O'Brian was the Dodge City marshal on ABC's ``The Life
and Legend of Wyatt Earp'' from 1955 to '61.
   The Western also stars Jack Elam of ABC's ``The Dakotas'' in 1963
and NBC's ``Temple Houston'' in 1963-64; Johnny Crawford, who was
Mark McCain on ABC's ``The Rifleman'' from 1958 to '63; Charles
Frank, who was on CBS' ``The Chisholms'' in 1979 and CBS' ``Young
Maverick'' in 1979-80; and Charles Napier of NBC's ``The Oregon
Trail'' in 1977 and CBS' ``The Outlaws'' in 1986-87.
   The cast gives new meaning to Old West. The exception is John
Schneider of ``The Dukes of Hazzard.'' He's along for the ride by
horse instead of gravel-spraying roadster, playing Sheriff Pat
Garrett, the man who killed Billy the Kid.
   In ``Paradise,'' the ``over the hill gang'' comes to the rescue
after Horsley is thrown into jail on trumped-up murder charges.
   ``We're a little clumsy at what we did so well 30 years ago,''
says Barry, 67. ``I hope to see it come off because there could be a
future in Bat and Earp. It's a love-hate relationship, like between
Quirt and Flagg in `What Price Glory.' Two old guys who fight and
carry on. I've always felt there's a movie in it.''
   Although Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp both operated in Dodge
City, the twain never met on television, since they were on
different networks.
   ``I would have had him on my show,'' Barry said. ``He had his own
Bat Masterson. But he guarded his show with his Buntline Special.''
   Barry also stars in the NBC movie ``Repeat Performance,'' which
will be telecast in December.
   The movie, a remake of a 1947 film, stars Connie Sellecca as a
woman who kills her husband at midnight on New Year's Eve and
discovers she can relive the previous year. She knows what's ahead,
but can she change the climax?
   Barry plays her business manager, and the story is told through
his eyes.
   The remake Barry is pressing hardest for is ``Burke's Law,'' the
ABC series (1963-66) in which he played a millionaire homicide
detective who drove to the murder scene in a Rolls-Royce. He hopes
to see it turned into a series of movies similar to ``Perry Mason.''
   Barry also starred in ``Name of the Game,'' in rotation with
Robert Stack and Tony Franciosa on NBC from 1968 to '71.
   He recalled that when ``Bat Masterson'' first came up 30 years
ago he didn't want to do it.
   ``Then someone said he wore a derby hat and carried a cane,'' he
said. ``That appealed to the actor in me. If it hadn't been for that
I would have turned it down. I didn't want to be tied down doing a
Western. I went to wardrobe and found the hat and cane and an
elegant swallowtail coat and shiny black boots.
   ``I looked at myself in the mirror and I knew exactly how to play
this man. The costume dictated my performance. It changed my life.
Every role I've done since has been a guy who looked good in
clothes.''
   It was his stint on Broadway as Georges in ``La Cage aux Folles''
that he calls ``the highlight of my life.'' He was in New York for
three years and then spent another year on the road in the French
farce about a gay couple pretending to be straight for the sake of
Georges' son, his fiancee and her parents.
   ``When the role came up it wasn't a surprise because every year
I'd do a play or take off with my one-man musical revue, `Gene Barry
In One,''' he said. ``I'd try to get back to New York for a musical
now and then. That was my `Repeat Performance.' That's where I
started, on the musical stage.''

   The most obnoxious show on television
is over.
   For two years, The Morton Downey Jr. Show raised eyebrows, ire
and, to a certain extent, social conscience. He also made people
laugh.
   His show, filmed at a New Jersey television station studio,
attracted adoring live audiences who appreciated Downey's
no-holds-barred style.
   Guests knew they would be subjected to a verbally _ and sometimes
physically _ abrasive, opinionated Downey screaming inches away from
their faces.
   But stations that aired the syndicated show might have grown
weary of hitting the bleep button. And advertisers apparently were
wary of appearing between segments of Downey's talk show. Without
enough consistent advertising, it was axed. The last original show
airs Sept. 15.
   To many television critics, the cancellation is not a great loss.
Others say Downey blazed the trail for ``shock'' television.
   ``The tradition of someone saying controversial things goes back
a long way in radio. Mort Downey just passed beyond some previous
standards,'' said George Comstock, a public communications professor
at Syracuse University.
   ``Downey's strong following began to deteriorate as he became
more abrasive than he could handle with good humor,'' Comstock said.
``The show began to slide from `controversial but real' to
`ludicrous put-on.'''
   Downey's reputation was not helped by the complaints and lawsuits
filed against him and his show. In April 1988, Downey was acquitted
on charges that he slapped a gay-rights activist.
   In August of that year, the editor of a weekly newspaper in
Connecticut filed a complaint that Downey scuffled with him during a
show. Four months later, Downey was sued by a Pennsylvania radio
personality who claims Downey assaulted him during a live panel
discussion on gun control.
   Most controversial was Downey's allegation that a group of
skinheads attacked him in San Francisco Airport. Skepticism arose
when a former associate said Downey had been planning a press stunt
to boost his show's ratings.
   Jane Marion, a TV Guide associate editor who has interviewed
Downey several times, said that in reality, Downey ``is an extremely
likeable man. Even he is tired of this persona he created. I don't
want to say he sabotaged his own show, but he was ready to move on
and he appealed only to a certain segment of the television
audience.''
   Downey agrees that being Morton Downey was hard work, albeit
satisfying.
   ``It was tiring for me to always be the aggressor,'' he said.
``Never again, though. I put a new pane of glass into television,
and I may have actually thrown a hardball through it. But I'll leave
it alone and put in another pane somewhere else.''
   Downey's unique talk show started out as a cult cable television
item in 1987, and soon advanced to the masses via syndication in
1988.
   ``It was a quick burst, like a comet,'' said Howard Rosenberg, a
television critic for the Los Angeles Times. ``To me, he was the
extreme. I predicted from the beginning that he would be gone within
two years.''
   Ms. Marion said that Downey ``came on the air like a steam train.
It was trendy TV, and trends are born and die just as quickly.''
   Rosenberg found Downey's show ``offensive and dangerous, not
because of the ideas he espoused but because of the volatile
environment he fermented. I'm glad he went off the air before
anything dangerous happened.''
   Van Gordon Sauter, former executive vice president of the CBS
Broadcast Group and former president of CBS News, said Downey was
``a superb showman.''
   ``But his concept was predicated upon hostility, and after a
period of time, hostility becomes debilitating for the host and the
audience,'' Sauter said. ``His show was an oddity at first. Hostile
shows tend to be aberrations on television.''
   Comstock said that Downey's show ``restored some legitimacy to
tabloid television by suggesting there are ... limits.''
   But Sauter said the show's cancellation ``has nothing to do with
its standards, but rather with whether the audience felt comfortable
with the environment.''
   Downey himself thought his fans ``saw the humor in the show, the
entertainment value. They could see the smile on my face.''
   Apparently, not enough did.
   The cancellation was ``kind of fortunate,'' Downey said. ``It
just spins me off into another area.''
   Downey said his company is working on a sitcom called ``That's My
Dad,'' featuring himself as one of the leads.
   He also said he is working on a new talk show with a ``new
structure that would absolutely work. It would be radical, but not
offensive.''
   Sauter thinks that would be seen as a charade and it, too, would
flop.
   ``A kinder, gentler Mort?'' he said, chuckling.

   Don't gamble _ invest.
   That admonition surely has a familiar ring for anyone who has
ever devoted much study to the art of managing money.
   But like a lot of other time-honored advice, it often goes
unheeded. Indeed, the distinction between the two activities is
often misunderstood.
   One definition of gambling is any financial venture based on a
risk _ for example, the spin of a roulette wheel or the weekly
drawing in a state lottery _that is created solely for the purpose
of betting.
   Investment, by contrast, is a venture based on a risk that
already exists _ for instance, the question of whether a company
whose stock is publicly traded will prosper or languish in the
future.
   Invested money can and often does help create wealth with a
multiplier effect, enriching both those who put it up and those to
whom it is entrusted for use.
   Gambling, by contrast, generally rewards winners only be
redistributing to them money from the losers in the game.
   ``The easiest way to differentiate them is to understand that
gambling is a zero-sum game, while investing is a positive-sum
game,'' says Sheldon Jacobs, who recently examined the subject in
his newsletter The No-Load Fund Investor.
   ``Parimutuel betting, lotteries, roulette, craps and many other
casino games are zero-sum games. In each of these cases, there is a
finite pool of money bet. There MUST be losers to pay the winners.
   ``And since there are costs to all `games,' gambling is really a
negative-sum game. Somebody has to pay the overhead at the casinos
and the tracks. It is the small player who usually winds up paying
most of it.
   ``For most individuals playing most games, skill is not a
sufficient factor to beat the house edge.''
   Of course, in the investment world the house usually takes a cut
too, whether it comes in the form of a brokerage commission, price
concession or mutual-fund management fee.
   As Paul Merriman, a Seattle-based investment adviser, observes,
``all those megabuck skyscrapers owned by banks and insurance
companies were not built on thin profit margins and small
commissions.''
   But money invested in things such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds
and bank accounts can still bring benefits for all concerned.
   In simplest terms, says Jacobs, ``if one person buys a stock at
$20, sells it at $30, and the buyer sells it at $40, both win $10.''
   Are all investments conservative and safe? Hardly. Even
supposedly low-risk vehicles like U.S. Treasury bonds can cost their
owners plenty in buying power if inflation and interest rates
increase.
   Perceptions of comparative risk, however, don't often square with
reality.
   Consider the individual who wouldn't dream of ``gambling'' $5,000
in the stock market, but who uses $10 in pocket money each week to
play the state ``million-dollar'' lottery game.
   After five years, this person will have ``invested'' $5,200 in
the lottery, with the strong likelihood of a 100 percent loss.
   The probability of success in a stock investment is inherently
unknown. But even if the stock market fell 89 percent, as it did in
the 1929-32 disaster, the results with a $5,000 investment would not
be as bad as those of the typical lottery player.
   ``There is nothing wrong with occasional bets for
entertainment,'' Jacobs concludes, ``but the real way to win the
lottery of life is to save a dollar and invest it wisely.''

<HEAD>The Politics of The Drug War</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In President Bush's renewed war on drugs,
there's no political argument about the enemy, the objective or even
the weapons _ but partisan skirmishes already are flaring over
priorities, price and the way to pay for it.
   Stripped to essentials, there really is no Republican way to
combat the drug menace and no Democratic way. The argument between
the parties, which means between the White House and Congress, is
over how fast and how much.
   And it also is over new taxes. Bush says no; the Democrats say
the cost of the drug war means at least maybe.
   Political infighting about the war on drugs probably was
inevitable. It is ranked atop the current list of voter concerns, it
figured in the last campaign, and it may be the common denominator
issue in next year's congressional elections.
   Bush saw it coming. ``But those who judge our strategy only by
its price tag simply don't understand the problem,'' he said in his
Tuesday night address to the nation. ``Let's face it, we've all seen
in the past that money alone won't solve some of our toughest
problems.''
   The Bush strategy points to a guns and butter sort of a war,
although the president said that there would be hard times and high
costs ahead. He said he wants to add $2.2 billion to the war on
drugs. In budget terms, all but $716 million already is included in
proposals the administration has sent to Congress. The White House
would offset that by cutting other programs, one at the Pentagon,
the rest on the domestic agenda.
   ``We can pay for this fight against drugs without raising taxes
or adding to the budget deficit,'' Bush said.
   Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, who delivered the Democrats'
televised response, said the Bush plan would wage a limited war, on
the cheap. ``We don't oppose the president's plan,'' said Biden, who
as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee wields legislative
power over major portions of it. ``All we want to do is strengthen
it.''
   While the president asked support and commitment of a united,
angry America, he did not spell out costs in terms of sacrifice.
That word turned up in a public opinion poll conducted as part of
the buildup to the drug report. George Gallup Jr. said the survey
found a majority of the public ready to accept sacrifices as in
wartime, including higher taxes, if necessary to combat drugs.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley said the drug war eventually will lead
to increasing pressure for a tax increase. Even Rep. Robert H.
Michel, the Republican leader, said there might have to be another
look at financing for the program after a year.
   That flowed into the debate over the budget, the deficit and the
taxes Bush ruled out in every speech of his campaign for the
presidency. That continuing struggle may embroil facets of the drug
program just as it threatened to snarl the legislation bailing out
the shaken savings and loan system.
   Bush said Congress should offer leadership and bipartisan support
to the strategy it asked the new president to prepare in the first
place. ``And our citizens deserve cooperation, not competition; a
national effort, not a partisan bidding war,'' he said.
   In his televised response, Biden proposed sharp spending
increases in a half-dozen pieces of the drug war Bush outlined. He
didn't give a total price tag, nor did he suggest a way to pay for
it. He has suggested higher liquor and cigarette taxes as a source
of drug-fighting revenues.
   The drug debate this fall will be in Congress. Next fall it will
be nationwide, as the candidates of 1990 make the issue part of
their campaigns for seats in a new Congress.
   In campaign settings, the debate over drugs usually centers on
who'll be tougher and more effective in fighting them. That's the
way it was when Bush and Gov. Michael Dukakis dealt with drugs in
their 1988 presidential campaign.
   While there are differences over the proper mix between
punishment and drug education and treatment, the issue is not one on
which parties or politicians can pick clearly opposing sides. So
they argue about who can do better with the weapons both political
sides support.
   In his 22-minute nationally televised speech, Bush said the new
attack he envisions can succeed where others have failed because it
will mobilize all the nation's resources in a coordinated drive
against drugs. ``... The basic weapons we need are the ones we
already have,'' he said. ``What has been lacking is a strategy to
effectively use them.''
   The Democrats agree on the weaponry. Indeed, the major elements
of the drug war were summed up in one sentence of the Democratic
Party platform a summer ago. It was a very long sentence _ 105
words, to be exact.
   But they don't necessarily agree that the administration strategy
is the best way to deploy those weapons.
   Bush may gain the united front he seeks. But it will come after
the political debate, not before it.

<BYLINE>What Would We Do Without Crises? ^By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an economy without crises Americans might feel
that something was missing, something wasn't right, something unseen
and ominous lay in the future, and that something was about to
happen.
   That mood in itself might end the crisis shortage, since it might
soon be documented as a decline of consumer confidence. But rarely
do most Americans have to invent crises. ``Experts'' create a steady
supply for them.
   So far this year the experts have warned of recession, inflation,
rising interest rates and a stock market collapse, and the probable
reason for their recent reticence is that they, too, need an
occasional rest.
   That a recession would occur seemed a very safe bet as the year
began, since the expansion was 6 years old and looking rheumatic.
That borrowing costs would rise seemed an equally safe forecast as
well.
   The experts gave the rationale: With unemployment down to just
over 5 percent, the pool of productive workers was depleted, and
that meant producer costs would rise. Producers would pass on the
expense to consumers.
   Simultaneously, statistics suggested that the economy's
productive capacity was being strained. The factory utilization rate
was up to 84.4 percent. Eighty-five percent became a magic figure;
beyond that would come inflation.
   Inflation and its buddy, higher interest rates can, as most
people realize, lead to recession. And even the mere prospect of
recession has been known to batter stock prices, housing,
employment, tax receipts, confidence and more.
   It was a crisis forecaster's economy, and they exploited it. When
the economy failed to overheat, when recession failed to keep its
appointment, when the stock market reached a record high, they went
into a huddle.
   They are there now, studying the charts and graphs, contemplating
the possibilities of a financial debacle, of a breakdown in trade
with Japan, of a confrontation with Europe over the coming of a
common market there in 1992.
   Explanations for the crisis phenomenon are many, and they seem to
bridge the gap between the two disciplines of economics and
psychology. Among them:
   _ Good times beget fears, often expressed in the phrase ``this
can't continue forever.'' Bad times also generate fears, and those
fears beget more. The latter is one reason why recessions seem to
grow on themselves.
   _ Forecasters must forecast, because they are paid to do so.
Success for a forecaster is in being first, in being right and being
successful.
   Success, however, isn't always determined by accuracy, as
subsequent events show. Many work for financial firms where success
is determined by the amount of publicity and revenues generated.
   Often, a poor forecast is forgivable, but a dull one isn't. In
fact, incorrect forecasts often are sufficient reason to offer still
another, revised forecast.
   _ Americans, and probably most others too, focus on short-term
economic information.
   Many of the statistical wiggles that occur by the day, week,
month and even quarter are meaningless. They might not even be real,
as subsequent revisions demonstrate. But they service the
crisis-a-day mentality.
   In the mix of current economic events are ingredients sufficient
to stir up a real crisis one of these days. Excesses eventually must
be corrected. For some of them _ debts and deficits, for example _
``eventually'' might be soon.
   There is no assurance, however, that the forecasters will have
warned us in advance. When the stock market crashed in 1987, the few
who had foreseen events were praised. They were rarities for being
right.

<HEAD>Presumption of Secular Drift Contradicted By Data</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although modern society regularly is portrayed as
becoming more secularized and less religious, the hard data dispute
it.
   Results of a new study provide some added rebuttal in regard to a
group almost invariably pictured as abandoning the faith of past
eras _ young people, particuarly college kids.
   They've relaxed their views about sex, but they haven't shucked
off religion.
   To the contrary, the new findings are that 80 percent of them
consider religion important in their lives, and 55 percent had
attended worship services once or more in the month preceding the
survey.
   Even more _ 72 percent _ had attended worship services in the
previous six months. Half of them said they read the Bible at least
occasionally. Only 20 percent termed religion ``not very
important.'' A tiny 2.3 percent called themselves atheists.
   The figures, gathered by pollster George Gallup Jr. for the
Christian Broadcasting Network, indicate a remarkable continuing
strength of religious concern among the young.
   That steadiness has turned up across the board in research data
on the religious pulse of America.
   In a new book, ``100 Questions and Answers: Religion in
America,'' published by Gallup's Princeton (N.J.) Religion Research
Association, he reviews current findings of high religious
involvement and says:
   ``In 50 years the nation's social order has undergone rapid and
profound transformations with little effect on measures of personal
faith.''
   In an earlier 57-page report, ``Religion in America: 50 Years,''
summarizing findings for that period about religion, he says the key
word for it is ``stability.''
   ``Basic religious beliefs, and even religious practice, today
differ relatively little from the levels recorded 50 years ago,'' he
writes.
   This also is documented in other recent books, including
``Religious Indicators'' in which the Rev. Andrew Greeley,
priest-sociologist and novelist, summarizes survey findings over the
last half century.
   He concludes that the pattern generally shows steadiness rather
than change or decline. Another book, ``Unsecular America,''
published by Erdmans, offers a similar accumulation of data.
   However, the thesis persists among both religious and
non-religious commentators that religion is in decline, giving way
to secularism, materialism, scientism and hedonism.
   Greeley arrays figures over the years, showing that beliefs in
basic doctrines, church attendance, prayer, organizational
affiliation and activity have changed little since the l940s.
   He says the data simply don't back the ``conventional wisdom of
many elite Americans'' that the country is sinking into secularism.
   He says that view is propagated either by people who broke with
their childhood religion and need to think what they did accords
with the march of history or by religious leaders who do it to urge
a return to past piety.
   ``The secularization model, which has never been confirmed by the
data and has often been disproved ... nonetheless remains as strong
as ever in scholarly and journalistic circles, unshaken and
apparently unshakeable,'' he says.
   The recent Gallup poll, involving questionnaires completed by 539
students at 100 colleges across the country, found that religious
concern remains high, but views of sexuality and family life have
changed.
   Two-thirds of the women said their ideal life would include
marriage, children and also a full-time job, while only 9 percent
envisioned an ideal life as being married and staying home with
children.
   This apparently reflected influence of the feminist movement
among modern young women, who find the old homemaker-mother image
insufficient. Least attractive _ just 1 percent _ was fulltime
homemaker with no children.
   Compared to adult women in general, of whom only about half
prefer to combine marriage with a career, 78 percent of college
women have that dual-role goal.
   Only 24 percent of college students nationally consider
pre-marital sexual relations wrong. Only two years ago, the
proportion disapproving was 27 percent on the college level, and 46
percent among adults generally.
   Students in the East were found much less likely to disapprove of
pre-marital sex _ only 11 percent _ than those in the Midwest, South
and West, where the proportion ranged from 25 to 30 percent.
   Half the students said they engage in sexual intercourse at least
occasionally. Others said seldom (10 percent), rarely (14 percent)
or never (24 percent).
   While the majority took a flexible attitude toward pre-marital
sex, they nevertheless overwhelmingly affirmed fidelity in marriage.
Ninety-eight percent said it's important for a married couple to
remain faithful and have sex only with each other.
   Catholic students, whose church rejects divorce, were more likely
to approve divorce _ 76 percent _ than Protestants _ 63 percent.

yourself.''
   Appealing to churches to help ease America's social problems, he

   ``The work of many American churches and related groups has
already accomplished much ... The Christian community already knows
the value of engaging in the lives of those in need.''
   ``That's why I ask you to `let your light shine' a

1983 to 41 in 1985 to the current 50 parishes.
   That's nearly a fourth of the total. Five of them had five

   Now none of the 196 parishes staffed by diocesan priests have
that many on staff. ``Today there are two priests who are staffing
two parishes each,'' Brown says.

   Death dropped in at the Blue Banjo one
Sunday, and nobody even noticed.
   Richard O'Bennick and Frank Woodworth lay by the back steps for
more than six hours on a 90-degree day before anyone realized they
weren't asleep.
   Two nights later, the jukebox blared a Johnny Cash song about a
Dallas bordello. A haggard group of men lounged in the alley behind
the Blue Banjo, talking and sharing a jug. On the sidewalk out front
drug deals went down.
   Business as usual.
   Inside, a couple of Mexican farmworkers played pool on a ragged
blue-slate table. A half-dozen men sat at barstools, laughing once
in a while and trading jokes with the bartender.
   A blonde woman with a bandage wrapped around her hand and missing
a front tooth danced a little as she walked from the jukebox to her
table. A man strutted behind her, mimicking. She turned and swiped
him on the shoulder. They laughed.
   O'Bennick and Woodworth used to come in, when they had cash.
   ``They certainly take these fellows' money readily enough and
give them alcohol. They're friends as long as they have money,''
said Roger Phillips, who runs the 100-bed Union Gospel Mission.
   Robert MacLemore, a cook across town at the Blue Ox restaurant
and O'Bennick's sometime drinking buddy, took a seat at the orange
formica-topped bar. ``He would go up and try to bum for money, and I
got to know him. He would always be glad to see me coming. He knew I
always had money on me, you see.''
   MacLemore last saw O'Bennick the Wednesday before he died, and
gave him all of his bus fare so the transient could buy a quart of
beer. MacLemore walked to work. O'Bennick ``was a nice person, he
really was. But he was lonely. He had something down inside of him
that was eating him away,'' he said.
   O'Bennick ``had a lot of good in him,'' said Phillips, whose
mission was the dead men's last address. He ``always carried a
trombone around and talked about playing it,'' though Phillips never
actually saw him blow a note.
   MacLemore remembered Woodworth as a quiet, heavy-set man who
walked around on crutches and loved to drink wine. ``He was older.
Well, he looked old, but he wasn't as old as I am. He was in his
late 40s, maybe early 50s.''
   After two autopsies and tests for poison, the cause of
O'Bennick's and Woodworth's deaths on Aug. 6 remains a mystery. The
men's bodies sat in the late-summer heat, a jug of Almaden Blush
Chablis between them, long enough to start decomposing before
anybody knew they were dead.
   Yakima County Coroner Leonard Birkenbine wasn't surprised. ``You
go down there, there's always somebody lying down like that.''
   The tavern, with a blue neon sign that's read ``lue Banjo'' as
long as anyone could remember, is in the tough section of Yakima, a
central Washington town of 50,000 that is best known for apples,
cherries and vineyards but is fast developing a reputation as a
rural drug center.
   In a block wedged between a residential district and a restaurant
strip are the Blue Banjo, another tavern and a long-vacant building
with barred doors.
   ``We did have an extensive problem some time ago down there,''
said police Capt. Don Blesio. ``For the most part the problem has
been reduced considerably, but we're suffering from the cocaine and
heroin problems that exist.''
   ``It's tough there, it really is,'' MacLemore said. ``You can get
hurt there. You can get killed there.''
   Bob Briggs, who said he was released from the Washington state
penitentiary in Walla Walla that day after serving eight years for
burglary and auto theft, watched the Blue Banjo scene from the
corner barstool.
   ``I asked where the toughest place in town was, and they told me
the Blue Banjo. So I figured I'd better come try it out,'' he said.
``It couldn't be any tougher than Walla Walla.''
   The bar is a popular spot. Patrons wander in, some for draft beer
at 50 cents a glass, some for the two-for-a-quarter cigarettes. In a
cubbyhole behind the bar two shelves are filled with fortified wines
like Thunderbird, MD 20-20 and jugs of White Port, O'Bennick's
favorite.
   While MacLemore and others talked about O'Bennick and Woodworth,
a young woman walked in and ordered a beer. The bartender asked for
identification and instead of producing a driver's license, she
lifted her shirt and exposed her breasts. She was kicked out.
   ``We get that all the time,'' said the bartender, a burly man
with a gravelly voice who asked that his name not be used. ``I've
got to kick her out or the cops would bust me for promoting
prostitution.''
   Two men staggered in and tried to order beer. They were kicked
out, too.
   ``He was like that,'' the bartender said of O'Bennick as they
lurched out.
   The cash register rang almost constantly after the bartender gave
last call at 11:45 p.m. MacLemore downed one for the road and walked
out through the shifting crowd outside.
   ``Coke? Coca?'' two men asked, making little sniffing motions.
   MacLemore ignored them and walked to the back of the building,
where a lone man rummaged through a trash bin. The homeless
jug-sharers had left. The spot where O'Bennick and Woodworth died
was empty.

<HEAD>New Symphony Hall a Class Act</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hailed as a first-rate concert hall but criticized
as a multimillion-dollar extravagance, the new home of the Dallas
Symphony Orchestra is, all agree, a class act.
   The Morton H. Meyerson Center, designed by I.M. Pei and detailed
down to its washroom faucets, seats 2,065 people, some in
second-level boxes costing between $10,000 and $30,000 with a
99-year lease if paid within five years. Tickets are extra.
   Its gala opening Friday, with performances by Van Cliburn,
Mstislav Rostropovich and Leontyne Price, was breathlessly awaited
by the arts community and the Dallas symphony supporters who, 10
years ago, began toying with the idea of a new home for the Dallas
Symphony.
   ``The opening of a major concert hall anywhere is a major event
because it's a shrine, it's a temple,'' said Matthew Sigman,
associate editor for Symphony Magazine.
   The center was conceived by a small group of symphony supporters
who toured concert halls around the world for ideas. In 1982, Dallas
voters approved a $28.6 million bond issue to help pay for the hall.
The rest of the original estimated cost of $49.5 million was to come
from private donations.
   The price tag has swelled through delays, cost overruns and
lavish extras to anywhere from $81.5 million to $108 million.
   The $81.5 estimate includes construction costs for the symphony
hall alone. The $108 million estimate includes the land, the
building, the organ, an underground garage, an adjacent park, a
commemorative sculpture and arch and overtime costs to finish the
canopies over the stage. Add financing charges and the cost of a
nearby garage that will be used by concertgoers and the tab rises to
just under $200 million.
   The city also will pay more than $2 million a year in annual
maintenance and debt service.
   Pei, designer of the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston and the
East Wing of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, was no
stranger to the Dallas skyline. He had designed four buildings here
before he was tapped for the project, and he was not likely to do
his first symphony hall on the cheap.
   He designed the music hall as a rectangle, sitting at an angle
inside a square, surrounded by segments of circles. The Dallas
Museum of Art and the Dallas skyline are visible through $6 million
worth of glass panes that make a sweeping curve of the lobby. There
is a 4,463-pipe organ, Italian marble and artificially weathered
limestone.
   After he was commissioned in 1982, at a fee that would total more
than $10 million, Pei told the developers that the 25,000 square
feet of land they had procured for the hall would not be enough. The
city began negotiations for more land nearby _ land that had
escalated as much as 10 times in value when word spread that the
hall was to be built there.
   Eventually, the symphony center would require 260,000 square
feet, at a total land cost of $16.1 million.
   Each new detail _ whether from Pei or the city or the symphony _
drove up the cost. Those pushing quality had an ally in Texas
billionaire H. Ross Perot, who contributed $12 million to the
project with the stipulation that if quality were sacrificed, he
wanted his money back.
   Perot also refused to hand over the money unless the center was
named for Morton H. Meyerson, president of Perot's Electronic Data
Systems Inc. and a member of the group that first envisioned the
hall.
   When budget considerations threatened the thick wood paneling
that Pei wanted for the music chamber (plaster and concrete were
originally proposed), Leonard Stone, executive director of the
symphony, warned that the Perot grant could be in trouble.
   ``Ross is expecting wood,'' Stone wrote in a 1986 memo to
symphony president Bill Schilling, ``and if Ross found out that wood
was excluded, he would feel that we violated the spirit of the
agreement we entered into when we accepted his gift.''
   Wood it was _ more than 1,100 panels of African and American
cherry _ 918 trimmed with brass inlays in the music chamber. Another
216 squares will grace the stage walls.
   Instead of brick and carpet in the lobby, Pei wanted marble and
limestone _ limestone that had to be given an artificially weathered
look before it was put in the hall.
   The construction brought with it widely reported disputes among
the architect, the organ designer _ C.B. Fisk _ and an acoustics
expert, Russell Johnson of Artec Consultants, Inc.
   Johnson downplays the disagreements. ``One does not expect that
an acoustical advisor, a theater planning consultant and an
architect are going to immediately agree on every detail,'' he said.
``We feel that the collaboration was very warm and very close and
very successful.''
   In fights with the symphony, Johnson protested using filled block
instead of poured concrete, and protested reducing roof or ceiling
thicknesses and installing vents in the auditorium floor. The hefty
construction is one factor he cites as essential to acoustical
quality, as was the decision to build a small scale hall.
   Other features of the Dallas hall _ 85-foot high music chamber,
movable canopies, soffit in the upper levels and acres of special
fabrics in the chamber _ are important to good acoustical design, he
said.
   The quality of the acoustics won't really be known until the
first note is played to an audience. Nonetheless, Johnson is not
worried. ``I have had a full night's sleep every night for the last
seven months,'' he said.

   Paul Kelly's songs could take place anytime,
anywhere: the 19th century in Australia, Europe in the 1940s,
contemporary America.
   Bus trips, history books and old girlfriends provide inspiration.
With his band, the Messengers, Kelly sings of love in vain, mystery
trains and hearts too big for the body.
   His influences include rock 'n' rollers Chuck Berry and Lou Reed,
bluesmen Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf, and author Raymond Carver,
whose short story, ``So Much Water, So Close to Home,'' provides the
title for Kelly's third album.
   ``He definitely showed me how to write economically,'' how to
convey a lot of information in a short space, Kelly said of the late
writer. ``His voice often has the ring of true speech. That's
something I've tried to do with my songs.''
   His songs are often three-minute stories, condensing days, even
years, into just a few stanzas. But if Kelly believes in writing
words that linger, the melody, he insists, comes first.
   ``I wouldn't want people to think of songs just in terms of the
lyrics. By making the words fit the melody, you open your stories up
to chance. Sometimes the melody is going to make your story go
somewhere. I don't sit to write a story in a song; it's usually the
other way around.''
   He contrasts bitter lyrics and happy music, singing
``Everything's Turning to White'' so sweetly that only careful
listeners will pick up Kelly's rendition of Carver's bitter story
about a man's indifference to a young girl's death.
   Myths are also important, whether his own or someone
else's.``Pigeon-Jundamarra'' is based on a true story about an
Aboriginal resistance hero from the late 19th century who kills his
former masters and heads for the hills. Kelly added his own twist.
   ``He knew the country so well and had knowledge of this extensive
cave system,'' the musician said. ``He was very hard to catch and
became almost supernatural. People believed he could never be caught
by a white man's bullet. ``It was surprising that the song turned
out very short and was written from the point of view of the officer
chasing him. I started with a formal story in my mind; the officer
chasing him is just a fictional character. There was certainly no
Officer O'Malley.''
   Kelly, born in Australia, grew up listening to rock 'n' roll,
playing the trumpet and writing short stories. By age 18, he was
ready to take up the guitar and write songs.
   ``I knew that I wanted to write so I was keeping a journal, but
it took me a couple of years before I actually wrote a song. It was
in F and G and sounded a bit like (Bob Dylan's) `Percy's Song.'''
   He began his career in 1976, working in bands in Melbourne and
gradually meeting the musicians who became the Messengers: Steve
Connelly, Michael Barclay, Peter Bull and Jon Schorfield.
   ``I've known Steve and Michael for a while because we all lived
in Melbourne for a stage and we've seen each other in bands,'' Kelly
said.
   ``I moved up to Sydney in 1984 and we worked together as a trio.
That was also the time I met Peter, who was playing in another band
at the time. We made an acoustic record and Michael sang on it.''
   He made a solo album, ``Post,'' in 1984, but began to acquire a
real following with ``Gossip,'' a double album released two years
later that featured the Messengers. Trains were there from the
start. ``Last Train to Heaven'' recalls a time when trains were a
symbol of unavoidable fate, that could take away your true love
forever or provide your escape to a better world.
   ``It's a symbol of death in dreams,'' Kelly added. ``Freud always
listed one of the death symbols as a train. I sort of unconsciously
absorbed it. I didn't realize it until later that I wrote so often
about trains.''
   The ballad ``Cities of Texas'' was written on a bus, one that
pulled into Dallas during the first American tour. Kelly sings with
the deepest longing, like a man saying goodbye.
   ``I guess it's like the kind of longing you have for something
you feel is going to pass away,'' he said. ``You walk into Dallas
and you walk up to a building and touch it, it's solid, seems like
it's going to be around for a long time. But seeing it from a
distance, it's like, `Here today, gone tomorrow.'
   ``Dallas made a big impression on me. The city seemed to shimmer
with all the glass reflected. It's a song of mourning, so beautiful
but it's going to go away.''

<HEAD>In Rainy New York, Umbrella Art Exhibit Cheers Visitors</HEAD>

   Outside, on yet another day when New York felt
like Seattle, people ran with newspapers over their heads to fend
off a summer shower. But inside a Manhattan museum, others pondered
a rain of umbrellas.
   From the ceiling of the American Craft Museum, about 30 artful
umbrellas are suspended in the air, a seeming snapshot of a
free-fall down a three-story-high stairwell. All that's missing is
Mary Poppins.
   The exhibit has lured in many during a season that demanded a
good umbrella: More than 28 inches of rain fell from April to July,
double the norm.
   ``I do think the timing's been wonderful,'' museum director Janet
Kardon said. ``But when it's raining outside, it's quite cheery in
here.''
   ``A Rain of Talent: Umbrella Art,'' was created by painters,
sculptors, architects and ceramicists who were given white umbrellas
and instructions to do as they pleased.
   Most painted whimsical designs. But one artist fused an umbrella
with a kindergarten chair, another hung strands of string inside the
frame to create an image of an umbrella that lets in rain, and a
third painted long knives and daggers for a creation called ``Acid
Rain.''
   A fourth artist robbed her umbrella of its function: it's all
frame, no cloth. And yet another, from Texas, made an inside-out
umbrella that looked as if it had been through a tornado.
   Many visitors said they now will look differently at umbrellas _
and rain.
   ``Most people think depressing things about the rain. But this is
bright and wonderful, almost childlike,'' said Sasha Bergmann of
Santa Barbara, Calif. ``This makes me want to go home and paint my
umbrella and then never use it.''
   Adriana de Freitas, of Rio de Janeiro, said the show was ``like a
crazy rainy day. They had a lot of fun with it.''
   The show, at the museum until Sept. 24, will be at a University
of Chicago gallery early next year and then may tour the country,
said Richard Siegesmund, director of The Fabric Workshop in
Philadelphia, which organized it.
   The Fabric Workshop asked Patterson Sims, curator of modern art
and associate director for art and exhibitions at the Seattle Art
Museum, to create an exhibition. ``Living in Seattle, you are real
conscious of the necessity of having an umbrella, and you want
umbrellas to be as cheerful as possible,'' said Sims, who doesn't
own one.
   ``It's a form of denial,'' he said. ``I just get a little wet.''
   Umbrellas are ``an object that we often review in mundane
fashion,'' Siegesmund said. ``But if you think about it, umbrellas
can become an object of startling beauty and demand consideration as
an art object.''
   But most of the exhibits can still do the job for which they were
designed.
   Edward Henderson, from Stony Point, N.Y., took apart a small
schoolroom chair to create a sort of umbrella-chair, one of the few
exhibits not hanging from the ceiling. It could serve as a child's
all-weather reading spot.
   ``I wanted to make something that would be much more than just an
umbrella,'' said Henderson, a painter and sculptor. ``I wanted to
embellish it. It's very common to put paint on it. So you just
stretch it. You can't take it that seriously, but then I take my art
very seriously.''
   Claire Zeisler, a fiber artist from Chicago, didn't take her
assignment seriously at all. She said ``helpers'' at her studio
thought of putting long strands of string inside her umbrella. ``It
doesn't mean anything, you know. Except that it's fun. Maybe they're
trying to upgrade umbrellas.''

<HEAD>Mazda's Miata Fun and Affordable, If You Can Find One</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1990 Mazda MX-5 Miata is the best of two worlds _ fun and
affordable.
   That pretty well explains why Road and Track magazine calls it
one of the ``world's best cars'' and Motor Trend magazine calls it
the ``best sports car buy in America.''
   Introduced this summer, the Miata is this year's auto success
story. Dealers have long waiting lists of buyers who seem to just
follow the car-hauling trucks into showroom lots. Some buyers are
putting down deposits just to get a Miata next year.
   The car buff books have splashed the Miata all over their front
covers. And young and old alike seem taken with the little car from
Japan that looks like the low-slung 1960s sports cars from Britain.
   Japanese carmaker Mazda initially projected sales of 20,000
Miatas this calendar year, but demand is so large that spokesman
Fred Aikins said more than 20,000 may be delivered as the company
cranks up production.
   More than 5,800 were sold in the first two months of sales,
Aikins said. Next year, sales of 40,000 more are expected.
   The Miata test car _ with convertible top _ was, well, fun. It
handled nimbly, making tight turns with ease.
   The normally aspirated, 1.6-liter four cylinder engine scooted
the car around with pep, since the Miata body is relatively
lightweight. The five-speed manual transmission is the only one
available at this time and went through its paces well.
   Still, it's no Nissan 300ZX in terms of top speed (116.8 mph for
the Miata vs. a fuel cutoff at 148 mph for the 300ZX) or
acceleration (8.6 seconds to go from 0 to 60 mph in the Miata vs.
less than 7 seconds for the 1990 ZX that's powered by a V-6 engine).
   But keeping in mind that the 300ZX starts at $27,300 while the
Miata starts at $13,800 puts things in perspective.
   The Miata interior was your basic black _ the only color offered.
There are three exterior colors: red, white and blue.
   Instrument gauges were easy to read, and there were few
electronic gadgets. Windows roll down manually. Outside mirrors
adjust manually. The seats adjust manually and had a sturdy feel,
thank heavens.
   The suspension is stiff in the Miata, so riders feel lots of
bumps. The AM-FM stereo with cassette player was average.
   I noticed there was considerable road noise in the Miata, but
that seemed to be part of its ``roadster'' charm.
   The steering wheel had an airbag embedded in its center, so the
horn buttons were at the sides. I hit them and sounded the horn a
couple times accidentally.
   Behind the passengers is a small rear shelf. Watch when you put
things there. They tend to slide around and may even come sliding
forward toward you.
   The sun visors are itsy bitsy things that fold in half so they're
out of the way as the convertible top goes up and down.
   The top itself is a breeze to maneuver. Just unzip the rear
plastic window, lay it down flat, unlock the top two sides of the
convertible top in front and down it goes.
   Mazda includes a vinyl padded boot for packing and securing the
convertible top. One problem with the convertible top is that it
prevents you from going to an automatic car wash. Mazda warns
against that in the owner's manual. There is an optional, detachable
hardtop that costs $1,100.
   Another problem with the convertible top is that it has large
side ``pillars'' by the back window which obstruct the view to the
side and rearward. The passenger-side outside mirror helps make up
for that blind spot.
   Fit and finish on the Miata were admirable, inside and out. But
the trunk, with its little spare tire, is pretty tiny. Maybe three
bags of groceries will fit, and that's if you ask them at the store
to fill them no more than three-quarters of the way.
   Mazda expected a pretty even split of single men and women buyers
who have college education. But so far, there are slightly more men
buyers than women, Aikins said.
   Median age was projected to be 32, but Mazda finds plenty of
older buyers, too, he said. Household income of target buyers is
$32,000 a year, he added.
   Because the Miata is a new vehicle, Consumer Reports magazine
does not have owner complaints.

   As they struggled through a snowstorm toward a
theater in a small town, actress Rosemary Prinz's husband once said
to her, ``You don't care where you act, do you?''
   ``You're right, I don't,'' was her answer then. Still is.
   ``You give me a good play and a good part and Bogalusa suddenly
is like Broadway,'' says Miss Prinz.
   Right now Miss Prinz is happily studying the title role in
``Driving Miss Daisy.'' ``It's such a beautiful play and wonderful
part,'' she says. ``I'm thrilled to be doing it.''
   While Julie Harris is on a national tour in ``Driving Miss
Daisy'' through January, Miss Prinz begins a ``bus-and-truck'' tour,
playing mostly one-nighters in smaller cities, in October. In
January, she takes over from Miss Harris on the national tour which
will last through April.
   Her husband, jazz drummer Joe Patti, may go with her on the tour
as road manager.
   Some know Miss Prinz from TV soap operas, especially as Penny on
``As the World Turns.'' She has been in several Broadway plays, from
``The Grey-Eyed People'' opposite Walter Matthau in 1952 to, most
recently, ``Tribute,'' starring Jack Lemmon in 1978.
   Her acting career began at 16 with a tour of ``Joan of
Lorraine,'' when she played the king's mistress and Diana Barrymore
played St. Joan.
   As well as not minding tours, she says, ``I'm an actor who
doesn't mind long runs. I love keeping it fresh, making it like I've
never heard it before or said it before. I find that very
challenging.
   ``I love peeling away the layers and finding all that richness
underneath.''
   Miss Daisy, the Atlanta native who gains some insights from her
chauffeur during the play, has a rich personality for an actress to
discover, Miss Prinz says.
   Ted Lange, the bartender on television's ``The Love Boat,'' will
play the chauffeur.
   Miss Prinz's most recent role was the mother, for 840
performances, of off-Broadway's ``Steel Magnolias,'' which is set in
a beauty parlor. Much was made of the fact that she broke Mary
Martin's record, set in ``South Pacific,'' for the number of times
getting her hair washed on stage. ``I couldn't believe they were
making such a fuss,'' the actress says. ``Is that what I want to be
remembered for?''
   During each performance of ``Steel Magnolias,'' which is still
running, Miss Prinz also had her hair conditioned, set, dried under
a dryer, combed out and teased.
   ``It was supposed to look like a blond football helmet,'' she
says. ``If I had an audition or a party, I sometimes had to wash it
two or three more times a week and blow it dry. My hair held up
beautifully. It's been a long time in show business, this hair.''
   As Miss Daisy, who ages from 72 to 97 during the play's 26
scenes, she'll wear a gray wig. ``That means my hair will look
dreadful for the entire tour,'' Miss Prinz says. ``Hair under a wig
is just awful.''
   Miss Daisy is the oldest character that Miss Prinz has ever
played, but she did portray the 82-year-old mother in ``Twigs,'' a
four-act play in which one actress plays, in succession, three
sisters and their mother. ``That's such fun. It's a wonderful play
to do because you get to keep stretching those acting muscles.''
   Miss Prinz has been cast in some blockbuster stage parts, she
says, because people had seen her on ``As the World Turns'' from
1956 to '68.
   ``In the 12 years I was Penny, I did 40 plays,'' she says. They
were ``commercial'' _ Neil Simon plays, ``I Do, I Do,'' Mama Rose in
``Gypsy.'' She kept pushing her agent to get her ``arty'' plays _
Tennessee Williams, Chekhov, where soap opera stars are suspect.
   ``Once I got that started, about 10 years ago,'' she says, ``they
realized I was a serious actress.'' Her start was at the Milwaukee
Repertory Company in Williams' ``The Glass Menagerie'' and Sam
Shepard's ``Buried Child.''
   Since then she has been in ``Long Day's Journey into Night,''
five different productions of ``The Glass Menagerie.'' Someday she'd
like to play Blanche in ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' and Lady
Macbeth.
   ``I'm having the best time of my career right now,'' Miss Prinz
says. ``I keep working on the kind of plays I've always wanted to
do. I won't do anything any more that I think is not good.''
   She has done other TV soaps, but only for short periods. ``I was
on `Ryan's Hope' for awhile while I was in `Steel Magnolias.'
   ``In 1970, the creator of `All My Children' wanted instant
ratings. In those days (two years' after her 12 years as Penny) I
could give it to her. I took a five-month contract. I said, `I want
Amy to be opposed to the Vietnam War and work for civil rights.' It
wasn't what the show was about but I wasn't just sitting around a
table drinking coffee and talking about who was sleeping with who.''

<HEAD>Heady Career Move for Eric Pierpoint in `Alien Nation' ^With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a hot TV sound stage, Eric Pierpoint was
even warmer with his ears and the top of his head covered by a
molded appliance that transforms him into a large-domed ``newcomer''
on Fox Broadcasting's ``Alien Nation.''
   Pierpoint plays George Francisco, an alien from a planet 300
light years away who joins the Los Angeles police. He's teamed up
with earthling detective played by Gary Graham for this new action
drama based on the movie.
   ``They took a mold of my head and sculpted this head cover,'' he
said. ``It comes down to my cheeks and eyebrows. It takes an hour
and a half to get it on because it has to be blended around the
edges. It has to be just right with no wrinkles so that it
photographs well.
   ``It's very hot and it muffles your hearing about 50 percent. It
puts you in your own little world. You have to pay careful
attention. You hear little shuffling noises whirling around in your
head.''
   Pierpoint and Graham were doing a scene in which they question a
``newcomer'' prostitute. The sound stage was on the cramped second
floor of an old warehouse in an industrial district of Los Angeles.
It was last used by ``Cagney &amp; Lacey.''
   The new series debuts Monday on Fox after ``21 Jump Street,'' as
the two shows open a new night for the so-called fourth network. The
previous Sunday night slot for ``21 Jump'' has been taken over by a
spinoff series, ``Booker.''
   Executive producer Kenneth Johnson, who previously produced
``V,'' adapted the ``Alien Nation'' series from the movie starring
James Caan and Mandy Patinkin. It's set in Los Angeles in the 1990s
and is a police drama involving some of the 250,000 ``newcomers''
trying to find a place in society after their space ship has
crash-landed. (That must have been some ship.) Called ``slags,''
they run into some resistance and prejudice from earthlings.
   The ``newcomers'' are brainy and a bit quirky. George is very
earnest about playing the game right. He and his family are trying
very hard to fit in as middle class.
   ``Ken Johnson called me in January and asked if I wanted to do
`Alien Nation,''' Pierpoint said. ``I thought he wanted me for the
earthling role. When he said he wanted me to play George I said I'd
have to see the movie again. I said, `You're absolutely right. I
have to do George.' Still, it's a bit of a stretch for me and I was
very nervous about it.
   ``Doing this kind of a character is a risk. I've needed some help
to tell me when I'm too broad or too funny or too unreal. Some of it
just comes from the things that happen. We're coming up with a lot
of things. When he gets a cold he blinks. When he's tense his feet
get sore. He gets drunk on sour milk and when he makes love he hums.
We've gotten a lot of jokes around the set on that.''
   Prior to starting the series, Pierpoint walked around Union
Station in makeup talking to people. Some people got nervous, but he
found if he spoke with authority people answered his questions. Some
thought he was deformed and one person walked up and said, ``Alien
Nation.''
   This is the third series for Pierpoint, the son of CBS News
correspondent Robert Pierpoint of ``CBS Sunday Morning.'' He was in
``Hot Pursuit,'' which ran briefly on NBC in 1984. Ken Johnson was
the producer of that show, too. He also spent a season on ``Fame''
as the drama teacher.
   ``I've done a lot of guest shots,'' he said. ``I was on `In the
Heat of the Night' and `Beauty and the Beast.' I had a recurring
role on `Hill Street Blues' in which I had a brief fling with Betty
Thomas. I was in a remake of `Invaders From Mars.' I was the
general's right-hand man. I got nailed by the Martians.''
   As a youth, he occasionally tagged along with his father to the
White House and presidential vacation stops: Hyannisport, Mass.;
Austin, Texas; and San Clemente, Calif. He attended the University
of Redlands and afterward worked in a government-sponsored arts
program for children. He later got a master of fine arts degree and
traveled abroad with a Shakespeare company.
   ``I worked in the theater mostly until 1982,'' he said. ``Then
you reach a point where you want to be paid. I found I couldn't buy
a house on $300 a week, so I got into television.''

<HEAD>Merger Talks to Continue Between Arthur Andersen and Price Waterhouse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. and Price Waterhouse have
major hurdles to overcome if they are to form the world's largest
accounting firm, but analysts say they expect the two will forge
ahead with plans to merge.
   The firms announced Tuesday that they are continuing their
exploratory merger talks, which began about two months ago.
   The two had hoped to reach agreement by early this month. But one
industry analyst said that given the complexities involved, the
lengthy talks are understandable.
   ``What's clear is that the two firms desire to merge,'' said
James Emerson, publisher of Emerson's Professional Services Review,
a Bellevue, Wash.-based publication that follows the Big Eight
accounting firms.
   ``The question is whether they can mechanically put the deal
together in a way that makes sense for their clients, employees and
partners,'' he said. ``I think the benefits are so significant that
they ... will work out their differences and will agree to the
merger in principle in the very near future.''
   The talks between Andersen, the nation's No. 1 accounting firm,
and Price Waterhouse, the No. 5 firm, come against a backdrop of
other mergers within the Big Eight.
   Ernst &amp; Whinney has agreed to combine operations with Arthur
Young &amp; Co., while Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells is joining forces with
Touche Ross &amp; Co.
   On July 6, Chicago-based Andersen and New York-based Price
Waterhouse announced that they had entered into 60 days of formal
talks to explore the feasibility of mergering their worldwide
operations.
   In a joint statement Tuesday, Price Waterhouse Chairman Joseph E.
Connor and Andersen Chief Executive Lawrence A. Weinbach said ``the
initial period of discussion has been beneficial.''
   The executives said talks so far ``have concentrated on exploring
a combination that would add value to client service, capitalize on
shared values of commitment to quality ... and provide enhanced
opportunities to personnel of both firms.''
   Andersen spokesman Jack Ruane and Price Waterhouse spokeswoman
Deborah Rothschild both said they could not comment further because
the firms had agreed to keep details of the discussions confidential.
   Some potential obstacles to a merger include how to reconcile the
firms' compensation and retirement systems and foreign operations,
as well as how to handle merging Andersen's very successful
consulting business with Price Waterhouse's, analysts say.
   ``Andersen's consulting partners are the most resistant to this
merger,'' said Arthur Bowman, editor of the Atlanta-based Bowman's
Accounting Report.
   Andersen Consulting is involved in dozens of joint ventures with
International Business Machines Corp. to develop computer
integration products for clients. The computer maker is Price
Waterhouse's largest audit client.
   ``IBM is a big question,'' Bowman said. ``There are definite
conflicts of interest that have to be resolved before they can do a
merger.''
   Federal Securities and Exchange Commission rules bar an
accounting firm from participating in joint ventures with one of its
audit clients because of possible conflicts of interest.
   Bowman said partners in both firms had indicated to him that
there was more work to be done than they realized. But he said the
merger could be worked out by the end of this month.
   ``After 60 days, if they didn't want to merge, they would
certainly have known that, so at least they are moving forward,''
Bowman said.
   Bowman said the U.S. Justice Department had started looking at
the ramifications of an Andersen-Price Waterhouse combination, which
would create the world's largest accounting firm. Together they
would have $5 billion a year in worldwide revenue, which $2.7
billion of that coming from U.S. operations.

<HEAD>U.S. Officials Agree Americans Need To Change Spending Habits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN MOFFAT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American officials did not dispute Japanese charges
made during trade talks that U.S. spending habits and the nation's
budget deficit are part of the cause of the bilateral trade
imbalance.
   The United States should save more, cut its budget deficit and
encourage longer-term thinking by its business leaders, Japanese
officials told their American colleagues Tuesday in talks on
structural solutions to the Japanese trade surplus.
   American officials attending the talks said they would seriously
consider Japanese suggestions for improving U.S. export
competitiveness, including a call for increased spending on
work-force training and education and more emphasis on the long-term
implications of business decisions.
   Japanese officials said the huge U.S. budget deficit and low
savings rate were major causes of the more than $50 billion
bilateral trade imbalance.
   Economists say that when Americans do not save enough to pay the
U.S. government budget deficit, the government must borrow from
foreigners, including Japanese, who get the money to lend by selling
goods to the U.S.
   As long as Americans prefer to buy Japanese goods rather than put
their money in the bank, and Japanese prefer to save their money
rather than spend it, the imbalance will continue, the economists
say.
   American and Japanese trade policymakers generally agree that
barriers to specific products, the focus of trade negotiations in
the past, now account for only a small part of the imbalance. Most
of the imbalance is caused, they say, by macroeconomic factors such
as savings rates and government spending patterns.
   ``We agreed with a great deal with the suggestions of our
Japanese colleagues, and hope they will take just as seriously our
suggestions,'' said Richard McCormack, undersecretary of state for
economic affairs and the leader of the U.S. delegation. ``When our
Japanese colleagues said our savings rate is too low we were in
total agreement with them.''
   In talks Monday, American officials told Japan it should
encourage people to spend rather than save, streamline its
complicated distribution system, and loosen the tight-knit business
ties that often exclude newcomers.
   The U.S. officials stressed that talks on eliminating the
structural causes of the trade imbalance, dubbed the ``structural
impediments initiative,'' were expected to produce concrete results
on both sides of the Pacific.
   McCormack said the United States had already established a
working group to study the U.S savings rate. He said some progress
had been made in encouraging Americans to save more, raising the
personal savings rate from 3.2 percent of the U.S. gross national
product in 1987 to 5.4 percent this year.
   Both Japanese and U.S. participants declined to comment on
specific policy changes that might result from the talks, which are
slated to resume in Washington Nov. 6-7.
   ``We hope and expect ... some changes could be implemented before
the interim report next spring,'' McCormack said. ``I myself am
optimistic that these talks will result in tangible changes.''
   Japanese officials, who on Monday were urged to increase public
spending to improve the quality of life in Japan and to end
exclusionary business practices that limit entry into their markets,
were more reserved in their comments.
   ``Although we haven't come up with any concrete answers to those
questions raised by either side, I think it was significant that
each side has come to know the other's point of view,'' said
Michihiko Kunihiro, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs.
   The response of Japanese officials to the U.S. recommendations
was mixed.
   Construction Minister Shozo Harada said the U.S. call to increase
the amount of Japan's land available for residential housing
construction was ``realistic'' and ``urgent.''
   But Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told Japanese reporters
``there is no need to obey the U.S. calls.''
   Hashimoto said the U.S. tactical approach of emphasizing how the
structural reforms they suggested would benefit Japanese consumers
put his government in the uncomfortable position of having to
``explain why such improvements cannot be done.''
   The U.S. officials said the structural reforms they suggested
would both reduce the trade imbalance with Japan and give Japanese
consumers access to a wider variety of products at lower prices.
   Spending more on highways, parks, sewers and medical facilities
in Japan, they said, would improve the quality of life for ordinary
Japanese and redistribute the nation's massive wealth.
   The two nations turned to a structural approach to trade reforms
after success in lifting trade barriers such as tariffs failed to
eliminate Japan's huge surpluses with the United States and other
industrialized nations.

<HEAD>Occidental Oil &amp; Gas Announces 900 Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Occidental Oil &amp; Gas Corp. will eliminate 900
jobs nationwide, including about 600 in Tulsa, as part of a move to
save $100 million a year, company officials announced.
   ``This restructuring recognizes a need to simplify and streamline
domestic oil and gas operations while at the same time generating
additional cash to sustain or improve capital programs for
exploration and development,'' David Hentschel, chairman and chief
executive officer of the Tulsa-based company, said Tuesday.
   Occidental Oil &amp; Gas Corp., including Oxy USA, is a subsidiary of
Occidental Petroleum Corp. based in Los Angeles.
   Hentschel announced the layoffs on the public address system at
the company's headquarters in Tulsa just before noon, employees said.
   Verle McCoy, manager of financial accounting for Occidental Oil &amp;
Gas, said employees had been hearing layoff rumors since May.
   Occidental Oil &amp; Gas employs about 1,750 in Tulsa and about 4,500
each in its international and domestic operations.
   The company is closing its exploration operations in Tulsa as
part of a plan to restructure domestic oil and gas operations, said
Linda Hauser, spokeswoman for the company.
   The company hopes the reorganization will save $100 million a
year, she said.
   The layoffs will occur over the next few months and into 1990,
Ms. Hauser said. She said there also will be an unspecified number
of relocations and transfers.
   A voluntary retirement program also will be offered to eligible
employees who are 55 years old or older and have five years of
service. Employees will have until Oct. 5 to decide whether to
participate in the retirement program.
   The company's oil processing and oil and gas production
operations will be combined into the new regional offices in
Oklahoma City, Midland and Houston, Ms. Hauser said. All domestic
and international oil exploration activities will be transferred to
central offices in Bakersfield, Calif.
   Occidental Petroleum Corp. acquired the then Cities Service Oil &amp;
Gas Corp. for $4 billion in 1982 and recently renamed the unit Oxy
USA Inc.
   Mickey Thompson, vice president of economic development for the
Metropolitan Tulsa Chamber of Commerce, said the Occidental layoffs
are another blow to Tulsa's oil-centered economy.
   ``We obviously are disappointed and discouraged with the
Occidental action,'' he said. ``In the face of this discouragement,
though, we need to recover quickly and continue our efforts to
diversify our economy.''

   A rift between the Machinists union and United
Airline's unionized pilots weakens the pilots' chances of succeeding
in their $6.75 billion bid to put 75 percent of the airline's parent
in labor's hands, experts say.
   Unless all three of United's major unions participate in the
proposed labor-management buyout, they are apt to lose to California
investor Marvin Davis in the bidding war for UAL Corp., analysts
predict.
   ``Price alone is not going to be the whole story,'' said Edward
Starkman, an airline industry analyst with PaineWebber Inc. ``What
really makes this deal go or not is the cooperation of labor.''
   The rancor that some United mechanics and ground-crew workers
previously expressed privately rose bitterly to the surface Tuesday
in a stinging statement from their union, the Machinists.
   ``We are very skeptical that United Airlines could survive in
today's marketplace with the additional debt that would be placed on
the carrier under this proposal ... particularly since the proposed
purchase price far exceeds the value of the airline,'' said John
Peterpaul, general vice president of the Machinists.
   Federal officials also have been concerned about airline buyouts
financed with heavy loads of debt.
   UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf was planning to discuss details of the
management-labor buyout in a meeting today in Washington with
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, according to the Chicago
Tribune.
   Transportation officials have said they would consider leveraged
airline buyouts case by case. They have indicated that they might
pull a carrier's operating certificate if an extreme debt burden
were to endanger its ability to run a safe operation.
   Although he said the enormous new debt is the Machinists' main
concern, Peterpaul also said the union opposes any transaction as a
means of staving off an unwanted takeover attempt. The Machinists,
representing 25,000 of United's 70,000 employees, have supported
recapitalization as a way to fight Davis.
   In a recapitalization to avoid takeover, a company typically pays
shareholders a large, special dividend financed by borrowed money,
making it less lucrative for shareholders to sell their stock to a
raider and leaving the company less attractive due to the new debt.
   The Machinist statement included a slap at the pilot-management
cooperation that led to the $300-a-share bid announced by the group
Friday.
   ``It is apparent that United's management, who has been locked in
a long struggle with the Air Line Pilots Association for a new
(contract) agreement, is using this ALPA-management proposal to
solve its problems with one union by passing the burden ... from
stockholders to other employees,'' Peterpaul said.
   He said the pilot-management bid was nearly $2 billion more than
United is worth.
   ALPA spokesman Hank Krakowski said the pilot-management proposal,
which would create the nation's largest employee-controlled company,
is based solely on participation of United's 6,300 pilots. But, he
added, ``it is our strong desire to have all employees on board this
proposal.''
   The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents 12,700
United workers, remains open to discussing participation in a
buyout, said spokeswoman Patricia Friend.
   Privately, some Machinists have said the pilots' leaders are too
close to management. Some bitterness also stems from the fact that
pilots are paid more than Machinists.
   Joseph Blasi, a professor at Rutgers University in New Brunswick,
N.J., said Tuesday that an employee-owned company works better if
all employees share in ownership.
   ``The differences between pilots and Machinists boil down to a
disagreement about who is more important and who deserves higher
wages,'' said Blasi, who has written several books on employee stock
ownership plans.
   Those differences, Blasi said, ``can be resolved better together
than with speculative takeover raiders.''
   Peterpaul said the Machinists had not been invited to participate
in any discussions regarding the pilot-management proposal, but that
they were keeping their options open and ``would not hestitate to
meet with the appropriate parties'' to discuss United's future.
   The bid by the pilot-management alliance has financial backing
from British Airways PLC.
   If successful, it would result in 75 percent employee ownership.
British Airways would own 15 percent of the company and UAL's
management, led by Wolf, would hold 10 percent.
   Davis, a billionaire who put UAL into play last month with a
$240-a-share offer that he later sweetened to $275, was reportedly
seeking the help of foreign airlines in an attempt to outbid the
insider group.
   The New York Times quoted an unidentified source in the Davis
camp as saying Davis was talking with European and non-European
carriers.
   The Davis group did not return telephone calls Tuesday seeking
confirmation of the report.

<TEXT>
   A former executive of Wall Street's Goldman Sachs
&amp; Co. has pleaded guilty to a felony mail fraud charge for trading
on inside information.
   The plea on Tuesday by Robert M. Freeman, the former head of risk
arbitrage at the prestigious investment house, was part of an
agreement with federal prosecutors announced Aug. 17. Risk arbitrage
is the speculative investment in stocks of possible takeover targets.
   In entering the plea, Freeman became one of the most prominent
people to plead guilty in the aftermath of the Ivan Boesky insider
trading scandal that rocked Wall Street nearly three years ago.
   Freeman admitted that he used inside information when he ordered
the sale of Beatrice Companies Inc. stock in January 1986.
   ``I knew it was wrong at the time, sir,'' Freeman told U.S.
District Judge Pierre Leval.
   He could be sentenced to up to five years in prison, $1.86
million in fines and additional restitution. Leval scheduled
sentencing for Nov. 16.
   The 47-year-old securities professional read a seven-page
statement that detailed the events on which his guilty plea was
based.
   He said he received confirmation of a rumor from Martin Siegel,
then a vice president at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., about a problem with
the planned leveraged buyout of Beatrice by the investment firm of
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   ``When Martin Siegel confirmed the rumor I did not believe that
he was authorized by KKR to do so, and I knew I was not entitled to
trade on that information,'' Freeman said.
   After the conversation on Jan. 8, 1986, he said he ordered the
sale of certain Beatrice securities in a company account, in a
customer's account and in his own personal account.
   The government alleges that the sales resulted in the avoidance
of $930,000 in trading losses.
   Siegel, who later worked for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., was
implicated in the Wall Street insider trading scandal by Boesky, now
serving a three-year prison term. Siegel pleaded guilty in February
1987 to securities fraud charges and agreed to cooperate with the
government.
   He implicated Freeman, who was taken into custody at his office
in front of shocked co-workers.
   U.S. Attorney Benito Romano announced Freeman's plea agreement
last month.
   Freeman resigned from Goldman Sachs before his plea agreement was
announced. He said in a letter to his employer that he decided to
plead guilty to end what he called the nightmare that the 2{-year
investigation had caused him and his family.
   His plea agreement prohibits Romano's office from bringing any
additional criminal charges against Freeman but does not preclude
the Securities and Exchange Commission from seeking civil penalties.
   At the court proceeding, Leval asked Assistant U.S. Attorney John
McEnany how much restitution Freeman faces.
   McEnany said the exact figure had not been calculated, but with
prompting from the judge, said it could go as high as $50 million.
   Freeman's attorney, Robert B. Fiske Jr., said McEnany's
estimation was ``off the wall.'' Fiske said Freeman may only have to
pay back $466,000, which is the amount of losses he personally
avoided in the transactions.

<HEAD>Arby's President Fired After Break With Posner Over Buyout Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Arby's Inc. franchisees intends to
pursue a $200 million buyout of Miami financier Victor Posner
despite the dismissal of Leonard H. Roberts as the fast-food chain's
president and chief executive officer.
   ``The offer still stands,'' said Dezanne Phillips, spokeswoman
for the group of eight franchisees known as R.B. Partners Ltd.
``This, from R.B. Partners' point of view, kind of fuels the fire,''
she said.
   Roberts was fired a few hours after releasing a sharply worded
letter Tuesday announcing his resignation as vice chairman of the
board and a director of Posner's DWG Corp. That company owns 60
percent of Chesapeake Financial Corp., of which Arby's is a wholly
owned subsidiary.
   The letter was highly critical of Posner and of his decision not
to discuss the proposed buyout with R.B. Partners.
   ```We are not in a position to comment in detail on Mr. Roberts'
letter because of pending litigation, but it is our opinion that
statements in the letter are untrue in all material respects,'' said
DWG Senior Vice President Renee Mottram.
   She said Roberts was fired by Arby's board ``by reason of his
recent actions.'' No successor was immediately named, but Ms.
Mottram said one would be announced soon.
   Roberts, in an interview Tuesday before the dismissal was
announced, had said he intended to stay on as president and chief
executive officer of Atlanta-based Arby's, which has about 2,100
outlets nationwide.
   ``I'm trying to protect Arby's,'' he said. ``I don't think Arby's
has any future under Victor Posner.''
   Roberts said later he was not surprised by the firing.
   ``I knew I had to take certain risks to stand up to a gentleman
like Posner...,'' he said. ``I feel good about my separation from
Posner, but I feel concerned about Arby's. ... Arby's needs to be
sold from Victor Posner.''
   Roberts was named CEO of Arby's in July 1985 after 11 years at
Ralston Purina Co. Before that, he headed product development
programs at Armour &amp; Co. and the Central Soya Co.
   Last week, Posner rejected the R.B. Partners offer of $200
million in cash for the Arby's chain, saying DWG has ``no interest
in pursuing such a sale.''
   Roberts said Posner's refusal even to talk with R.B. Partners
went against the wishes of some other DWG board members, including
himself. Roberts, in his letter, accused Posner of trying to bully
the board into seeing things his way.
   R.B. Partners, whose members operate more than 500 of Arby's
outlets, last week expressed concern over Posner's existing legal
and financial problems.
   Posner pleaded no contest in 1987 to federal income tax evasion
and was sentenced to five years probation, with the condition that
he repay his back taxes, penalties and interest and create a $3
million homeless fund.
   Howard Hansen, a restaurant industry analyst at Kidder Peabody in
New York, said Tuesday that Roberts had been a ``catalyst'' for
Arby's recent success, which included an increase of 16 percent in
sales and an 11 percent growth in number of new units in fiscal 1989.
   ``They've been successful with their marketing _ the hamburger
alternative and the chicken club sandwich that's been very
successful,'' Hansen said.
   In 1988 Arby's operating profit was $20.7 million on $153.8
million in revenue, he said. Since 1985 _ the year Roberts arrived _
900 new restaurants have been built and sales of increased 50
percent.
   In a letter dated Monday to Arby's franchisees, four of Arby's
top executives, including Roberts, described a meeting Saturday in
Miami with Posner in which a plan was announced to replace the
existing management team.
   DWG's Ms. Mottram said the decision Tuesday affected only Roberts.
   Joe Smaltz, chairman of the 500-member Arby's Franchise
Association, said he was ``shocked and outraged'' at the decision to
fire Roberts, crediting him with turning the company into a highly
profitable one.

<HEAD>Hong Kong Investor Makes Rescue Proposal For Hooker Corp.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: All dollar figures are U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An offer by a Hong Kong investor to help
rescue the financially ailing Hooker Corp. could help improve the
credit image of some U.S. department store chains owned by the
Australian property company.
   Hong Kong investor Lo Yuk sui on Wednesday offered to lend the
Australian concern $75 million through his property company,
Richfield International Investments Ltd.
   Hooker's U.S. interests, which total $1 billion, include the
Bonwit Teller and B. Altman chains, a shopping mall in Cincinnati as
well as other properties.
   In late July a group of creditor banks abandoned a plan to keep
the company afloat and forced Hooker, which owes about $1.2 billion
to Australian and international banks, to turn itself over to a
court-appointed provisional liquidator.
   Earlier this month, L.J. Hooker, the Atlanta-based U.S.
subsidiary of Australia's Hooker Corp., filed for protection under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in New York.
   At the time of the filing, reports surfaced that vendors were
reluctant to sell merchandise to Bonwit Teller and Altman's due to
the parent company's financial difficulties. Some vendors reportedly
said they would sell merchandise to the stores only on a cash basis.
   As part of the proposal, Richfield would acquire shares in Hooker
and gain options that eventully would give it at least 65 percent of
the Australian company.
   In a letter proposing the takeover, Richfield said the
restructing plan would provide for the ``orderly'' sale of some
Hooker assets.
   Richfield said it wanted to acquire Hooker ``as a going concern
in order to preserve asset values in Australia and in the U.S. ...
otherwise many Hooker assets will be sold prematurely and at
unfavorable prices.''
   Wardley James Capel Corporate Finance Ltd., a unit of Hongkong &amp;
Shanghai Banking Corp., is advising Lo on the proposed transaction.
   Hooker ran into financial problems earlier this year partly
because of rising Australian interest rates and the falling value of
Australian dollars.
   Lo is executive chairman of five publicly listed companies in
Hong Kong, including Regal Hotels (Holdings) Ltd., Paliburg
Investments Ltd., and Century City Holdings Ltd. and Aircoa.
   The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, which obtained a copy of the
letter, said that if the banks support the plan they would have to
agree not to enforce their securities and to withold demands for
payments for the next three months.
   Richfield would then be given until Nov. 30 to undertake a
detailed review of Hooker's operations and to decide whether an
appropriate rebuilding plan can be devised.

<HEAD>Shrimpers Say Regulation Could Endanger Their Business</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs graf 7, In July, to CORRECT mammals to sea animals.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Gulf Coast shrimpers say a new federal
regulation requiring them to use a device to protect endangered sea
turtles may endanger their business.
   ``What I fear is that the Louisiana shrimper will become extinct
before the Kemp's ridley sea turtle,'' Rep. Jimmy Hayes, D-La., said
Tuesday in response to the Commerce Department regulation.
   By Friday, shrimpers must install a ``turtle excluder device,''
or TED, in their nets to allow turtles to swim free. Failure to do
so could result in a maximum $20,000 fine.
   Environmentalists say the action will save thousands of sea
turtles captured in the nets from drowning, but they contend it
should have come months ago to protect such endangered species as
Kemp's ridley, leatherback and hawksbill and threatened species such
as the loggerhead and green sea turtles.
   Shrimpers complain that while the requirement will save the
turtles, it also will significantly reduce their catch of shrimp _
perhaps as much as one-third _ and may force some to stop fishing.
   ``It's going to drive a lot of people out of business,'' said
Jimmy Russell, president of a shrimpers association along the Texas
coast near Brownsville and Port Isabel. ``I wouldn't be surprised if
they have a lot of people tell them they're not going to do it.''
   In July, when the government first tried to force shrimpers to
install the TEDs _ oval-like metal grates that divert large sea
animals such as turtles out of the net _ shrimpers in Texas and
Louisiana blockaded waterways and threatened bodily harm to anyone
who tried to force them to use the devices.
   ``We're not going to have any more blockades,'' Tee-John
Mialjevich, president of the Concerned Shrimpers Association, said
Tuesday night. He said the group will go to court in an attempt to
reverse the regulation.
   Some shrimpers say TEDs will cut a boat's daily catch by as much
as one-third. However, a Commerce spokesman said that side-by-side
tests have shown losses to be only 2 percent to 5 percent, and
environmentalists argue that if the nets are operated properly
losses should be no greater than 2 percent.
   Undersecretary of Commerce John A. Knauss said ``the only way to
ensure protection'' of the vanishing species of turtles is by using
the trap-door devices.
   ``There is no other choice,'' he said, adding that attempts to
protect the turtles by limiting the length of time that shrimpers'
nets are in the water didn't work.
   The Commerce decision came under a court directive requiring a
solution to be found by Sept. 8. Five environmental groups had filed
lawsuits arguing that government action was required under the
Endangered Species Act.
   The requirement for the TEDs was to have gone into effect in May,
but Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher suspended enforcement of the
regulation after complaints from the shrimpers and their
congressional representatives.
   Environmentalists said Tuesday that they regretted the delay.
   ``Basically we're pleased, but we're sorry it took so long and we
had to jump through so many legal hoops,'' said Charles Miller of
the National Wildlife Federation. ``At this point the turtles are
going to have a fighting chance.''
   Environmentalists warn that several of the sea turtle species _
especially the Kemp's ridley _ may be doomed to extinction if they
are not protected from shrimpers nets.
   The number of female Kemp's ridley sea turtles nesting each year
has declined from some 42,000 in the 1940s to no more than 700,
according to James Ross, an expert on sea turtles.
   Ross said that from 600 to 1,600 Kemp's ridley turtles are killed
each year, often after young turtles get in the way of the shrimping
nets. The decline of the species is estimated at about 3 percent a
year, he said.
   Mialjevich, of the Louisiana-based shrimpers' association,
doesn't deny the number of those turtles has fallen dramatically.
   ``But we did not bring the turtle population from 40,000 to 600.
So how can we be the solution to saving them?'' he asked.

   All but a few, or 98.5 percent of 3,628 inheritors
of assets, investigated by tax officials in the Tokyo area this year
were found to be evading inheritance taxes, the Tokyo Regional Tax
Administration Bureau said Wednesday.
   The bureau said it uncovered an all-time high of 150 billion yen,
or about $1.02 billion, worth of unreported assets subject to
inheritance taxes.
   Accordingly, the taxes on those assets, combined with punitive
taxes, amounted to 53.4 billion yen, it said.
   The bureau said 18,600 of 132,000 people who died in Tokyo and
the three adjacent cities of Chiba, Kanagawa and Yamanashi in 1988
left behind assets subject to taxation.
   Of the total, 3,628 cases were considered questionable, and the
bureau conducted follow-up checks.
   About 70 percent of the unreported assets were in the form of
stocks, golf club memberships, cash and savings. Golf club
memberships are tradeable assets similar to stocks in Japan.
   The bureau said one company executive topped the list for evading
taxes totaling 118 million yen, or about $805,500.

<HEAD>Ministry Says Some Things Cheaper in Tokyo Than in New York</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo isn't necessarily the world's most expensive
city when its prices of cameras, videocassette recorders and some
other items are compared with those in New York, a government agency
said Wednesday.
   The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said its report
was based on a survey conducted in late August of prices of eight
consumer products, also including video cameras and compact
disk-radio cassette players.
   Japan excels in producing light, compact cameras and video
equipment, and exports them to the United States and elsewhere while
importing few such products itself.
   The Ministry said at an exchange rate of 144 yen to the dollar,
cameras and video equipment sold at discount shops in New York cost
more than those sold in discount stores in Tokyo.
   The report said prices of five models of cameras sold in New York
were an average 14 percent higher than in Tokyo.
   It said New York prices were 45 percent higher for VCRs, and 34
percent higher for compact disk players.
   A camera with a zoom lens and case cost 96,900 yen ($673) at a
discount shop in Tokyo against 113,750 yen ($790) in New York. A VCR
cost 78,000 yen ($542) in Tokyo against 117,200 yen ($814) in New
York, the report said.
   Ministry officials said results of the survey were shown to the
U.S. delegation during just-ended bilateral trade talks. U.S.
participants in the talks repeatedly said that identical products
made in Japan were more expensive here than overseas.
   According to a survey of more than 100 cities by Business
International, a Geneva-based research and consulting company, Tokyo
was the world's most expensive city and had a cost-of-living index
of 203, taking New York as the base of 100, in 1987.
   In 1988, the survey said, inflation and shortages of goods made
Tehran the world's most expensive city, ending Tokyo's four-year run
at the top of the list. Tehran had an index of 209, followed by
Tokyo at 202.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting a lack of significant news on the supply-and-demand front.
   Midwestern weather forecasts, full of rain and mild temperatures,
remained bearish for corn and soybean prices. But selling was
limited this morning by the Agriculture Department's weekly
crop-progress report. The report showed only a slight improvement
last week in the corn and soybean crops, most of which remain in
fair to good shape.
   The wheat market gained slightly in response to Tuesday's USDA
announcement it had targeted the Philippines for sales of 600,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   ``That's a pretty good-sized offer to that country,'' said Jerry
Gidel, research director in Chicago for LIT America Inc., a
British-owned futures brokerage.
   The USDA's report of higher-than-expected exports of U.S. grains
last week also helped firm futures prices this morning.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent lower to 1 cent higher with
the contract for delivery in September at $3.98\ a bushel; corn was
} cent lower to \ cent higher with September at $2.31} a bushel;
oats were unchanged to { cent lower with September at $1.34\ a
bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents lower to 1} cents higher with
September at $5.83 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were narrowly mixed while pork futures were mostly
lower in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .07 cent lower to .08 cent higher with October
at 72.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .17 cent
higher with October at 81.25 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent
to .40 cent lower with October at 39.12 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were unchanged to .25 cent lower with February at 43.37
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled sharply lower on Tuesday.

   Despite its ban on high-level contacts with
Chinese authorities, the Bush administration plans ``working level
discussions'' this month with Chinese officials on that nation's bid
to join an international trade body, a U.S. official said today.
   No firm date has been set for the meeting, however, and an
official at the office of the U.S. trade representative described
the planned session as a regular bilateral consultation on Chinese
efforts to accede to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or
GATT.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that, despite
the upcoming meeting, the administration remains opposed to China's
entry to GATT.
   ``They have to undertake significant economic reforms to be
eligible for GATT membership,'' Fitzwater said.
   He also defended the meeting and denied it was a violation of
President Bush's ban on high-level U.S.-Chinese contacts in the
aftermath of the Tianamen Square massacre.
   ``These are low-level, continuing discussions. They are not
negotiations,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``This can by no stretch of the imagination be considered a
high-level meeting,'' said Cecilia Kline, director for GATT affairs
in the trade office. ``The appointment hasn't been set up yet,'' she
said, but when it is, it would be ``a meeting in the normal course
of diplomatic activity.''
   Bush banned high-level contacts June 3 after the Chinese
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators. Among the canceled
meetings were a visit to China by Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher.
   A multilateral meeting scheduled for Geneva in July on China's
effort to take part in the GATT was also postponed.
   State Department officials said today they want to continue
``working level discussions'' with the Chinese on GATT.
   That decision has come under fire from a conservative Washington
group, the Center for Security Policy, which opposes closer ties
with China's communist government. The center's director, Frank J.
Gaffney, released what Kline called a ``purloined cable'' describing
U.S. efforts to schedule a bilateral GATT meeting.
   She said the U.S. government had told the Chinese it was willing
to meet with their GATT negotiators as hey headed to Europe for
discussions with other participants in the 96-nation accord.
   ``The president's statement on high-level contact I do not
believe covered multilateral institutions,'' she said. ``We attend
U.N. meetings where the Chinese are present.''
   U.S. diplomats in Beijing invited Wang Shichun of China's
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade to a meeting in
Washington on Sept. 11-12, according to the cable.
   ``Wang expressed his surprise that Washington had agreed to the
talks. He said their embassy in Washington informed Beijing that
Washington was unlikely to meet now,'' said the cable, signed by
U.S. Ambassador James Lilley.
   Wang said members of his delegation had not applied for visas and
plane tickets, and suggested a Sept. 18 meeting date instead, the
cable said.
   Gaffney, a former deputy assistant defense secretary, called the
U.S. invitation to Wang ``a major new initiative that rewards the
Chinese with something that they have sought for a long time.''
   ``Letting them into GATT ... fundamentally undercuts the forces
that are pressing for reforms in the People's Republic of China. And
it signals the Soviets and others who are facing social pressures
that there is no punishment for a Chinese-style crackdown,'' Gaffney
said.
   He contends that Secretary of State James A. Baker III violated
the ban July 31 by meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
at the beginning of the Cambodian peace talks in Paris.
   State Department sources said no date had been set for the
meeting on GATT and described Wang as ``deputy director of an
office, not a high-ranking individual, and therefore not covered in
the ban.''
   ``We would not be violating a ban that the president has
instituted,'' said one department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The president's ban, said the official, applied to ``politicial
level visits that would have a symbolic nature. This would be a
working level, technical visit.''
   A second department official, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the United States ``has a long-term interest in
getting China to abide by the rules of market countries'' set forth
in GATT and related international negotiations.
   ``The objective is to try to encourage China to continue along
its path of economic reform, to have a economic system that would be
consistent with market economies, to abide by the same rules,'' said
the official.

units _ single individuals age 65 and older and married couples
where one or both spouses are 65 or older.
   The total is followed by the percentages of elderly tax filing
units that would be winners and losers under revisions approved by
the House Ways and Means Committee, reflecting those who would pay
more or less under the proposal.
   The states' winners and losers figures do not add up to 100
percent because some people would not be affected by the proposed
change.

<TEXT>
   Twenty-one European airlines Wednesday
proposed a Europe-wide air traffic control system to replace the
national systems currently in place.
   The airlines called on European governments to convene a
ministerial conference to set a timetable for creating the single
ATC system.
   The Brussels-based Association of European Airlines said that
Europe's present fragmented approach, based on 22 national ATC
systems with 42 control centers, is costly and inefficient.
   ``These centers operate with different levels of performance and
technology, with no commonly agreed standards, and a lack of
compatibility between the different systems,'' said AEA Secretary
General Karl Heinz Neumeister.
   According to AEA, the current system has led to a crisis in
European air travel, as delays of more than 15 minutes reached 30
percent of European flights in June and July. Those delays cost
airlines, passengers, and the European economy about $4.2 billion a
year, AEA said.
   Moreover, a Europe-wide ATC system could mean direct savings of
$500 million a year at present air traffic levels, and $800 million
a year when future growth is taken into account, the group estimated.
   Air traffic control services in the 22 countries belonging to the
European Civil Aviation Conference cost $1.6 billion, the same as
the U.S. air traffic control system, according to the AEA. The U.S.
system, however, handles more than three times as many flights.
   The AEA study estimates that air traffic in Europe could have
been handled by six en-route facilities instead of the present 42.
The savings would far exceed the $2.2 billion national authorities
are planning to spend on air traffic control over the next few
years, AEA said.
   It proposed a two-tiered structure for a future European ATC
system. At an operational level, the group proposed the creation of
a central holding company, jointly owned by governments and private
interests. Its main functions would be to finance air traffic
control in Europe, direct investments, and reduce the number of ATC
facilities over the long-term.
   A central holding company for air traffic control would assure
that investments were made for the system as a whole, in contrast to
the current, poorly coordinated spending by spearate national
authorities, the AEA said.
   Governments could co-ordinate their policies in safety, security,
and political matters through the European Organization for the
Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol), under the AEA proposal.
Eurocontrol is a Brussels-based inter-governmental body with 11
members.
   Though efforts have been made to coordinate European air traffic
control, they have been insufficient so far, AEA said.
   Eurocontrol called the AEA proposals ``an interesting
contribution to the debate on the future of air traffic control in
Europe.'' Eurocontrol also defended its own record, saying it has
already taken over the task of developing a ``central flow
management unit'' for Western Europe, which will be based in
Brussels.

   Lufthansa, West Germany's national
airline, on Wednesday announced plans to raise $478 million by
issuing new shares at a discount to prepare for an expected increase
in air travel in the 1990s.
   The airline, which is majority owned by the federal government,
said it will issue 6.08 million new common shares at $78.60 each, a
22.7 percent discount to Wednesday's Frankfurt closing price of $101
a share.
   Lufthansa said that because the government won't participate in
the rights issue, the state's holding in the airline will be reduced
from 65 percent to 52 percent.

<HEAD>Crazy Eddie Founder Charged with Falsifying Info, Profiting Illegally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eddie Antar, the reclusive founder and former
chairman of the Crazy Eddie electronics chain, was charged today in
what authorities called a ``massive financial fraud'' to overstate
the company's income.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a civil complaint
lodged here, accused Antar and six former top executives with a
broad scheme to inflate inventory and cover up losses. Federal
prosecutors also are conducting an investigation.
   During the time of the allegations, Antar sold his holdings in
the company for $60 million, the agency said. The SEC seeks
injunctions, return of any illegal profits from stock sales and
penalties.
   The Edison, N.J.-based Crazy Eddie Inc., known for its manic
commercials proclaiming ``Our prices are insane,'' has foundered in
recent years after once boasting 43 stores in New York, New Jersey
and Pennsylvania.
   A dissident group of shareholders bought out the company in late
1987, but Crazy Eddie filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code last June.
   The SEC said that Antar in 1985 and 1986 ordered employees to
falsify financial records to overstate the company's financial
health. For the two years, pre-tax income was overstated by $8.7
million, the agency said.
   In 1987, Antar was still behind the scheme but it was directed by
cousin Sam E. Antar, chief financial officer, who was one of three
men in the office of president, created after Antar withdrew from
the firm, according to the SEC.
   Instead of a substantial loss that year, the company reported
pre-tax income of $20.6 million, said the SEC.
   SEC attorney Richard Simpson said the company used a variety of
methods to inflate inventory, from adding zeros on product lists to
inflating prices on the books to fabricating product returns to
manufacturers.
   Justin Feldman, a lawyer for Eddie Antar in a shareholder lawsuit
against the former Crazy Eddie executive, said he had not seen the
SEC's papers and could not comment. Antar and other defendants have
denied artificially inflating the company's worth in that case.

   U.S. and South Korean trade talks
opened in Seoul on Wednesday with the U.S. side demanding that South
Korea open its telecommunications market to American firms.
   South Korean officials said there were wide differences from the

   The U.S. government named South Korea as an unfair trader in
telecommunications last February and has threatened to impose tough

   A Lebanese businessman was extradited
Wednesday to West Germany to face charges of fraud in an alleged oil
trading scandal, the Swiss justice ministry said.
   West German authorities accuse Khalil J. Ghattas of leading an
illegal scheme that cost Kloeckner and Co. oil trading house some
$303 million. Swiss police arrested him in March.
   Ghattas, 58, controls the Gatoil chain of gasoline stations in
Switzerland, which recently ran into financial trouble after he
built them up in the 1970s.
   He is charged with inciting a former chief dealer at Kloeckner
into massive speculation on international oil markets. The company,
based in Duisburg, West Germany, was taken over by Deutsche Bank
after running up huge losses with the alleged dealings.

<HEAD>U.S. Can't Expect Fast Results From Trade Talks, Economist Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top government economist said Wednesday it is
unrealistic for the United States to expect current talks on
structural trade barriers to produce quick changes in its $52
billion trade imbalance with Japan.
   ``If the United States expects a specific change in the trade
imbalance by April of next year, then the talks will be totally
counterproductive and our efforts will only backfire,'' said Masaru
Yoshitomi, director general of the research division of the Economic
Planning Agency.
   U.S. trade officials have said they expect ``tangible changes''
from the talks, which are expected to take place over a year. The
first round ended here Tuesday and the next will be in Washington on
Nov. 6-7.
   Yoshitomi said the trade imbalance is due to general economic
factors rather than Japanese impediments to imports from the United
States.
   ``It should be rectified by broad economic and exchange rate
policies, not trade policy,'' he said.
   ``Today's economic problems transcend the simple question of
trade friction. It is also necessary to establish a co-leadership
between Japan and the United States,'' Yoshitomi said in a briefing
to reporters.
   If Japan overcomes a current ``Japan phobia'' among other nations
based on its economic and technological prowess, Japan and the
United States could establish a ``co-leadership for the world'' for
better world trade policies, overseas development aid programs and
an improved international monetary system, he said.
   In volume terms, Japan's exports have changed little since 1985
while its imports of manufactured goods have grown 106 percent,
government statistics show.
   However, in value terms the gains failed to register because the
yen is stronger now in dollar terms, Yoshitomi said.
   During the two days of talks, dubbed the Structural Impediments
Initiative, the two countries agreed to develop their own plans to
overcome structural barriers to trade.
   The talks centered on Japan's intricate distribution system,
exclusive corporate relationships, and land use policy, as well as
the savings and investment balance, government regulations and
corporate behavior in the United States.
   Among other things, Japan was asked to relax government
regulations on distribution, modify its land and construction
policies and improve foreign access to domestic distribution
channels.
   The United States was urged to cut consumption, slash its budget
deficit, enhance its productive capacity and review government
regulations detrimental to industrial competitiveness.
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party, which faces unprecedented
low public approval ratings at home, may find it difficult to
institute such fundamental economic changes.
   The party ``appears far more reluctant now than ever before about
going ahead with market liberalization at the risk of losing further
votes,'' the Japan Times newspaper said in an analysis Wednesday.
   An election for the powerful lower house of Parliament is
expected within the next several months. Opposition parties, which
made impressive gains in July elections for the upper house of
parliament, oppose drastic market-opening measures.
   A top Foreign Ministry official said some of the changes the
United States is demanding, such as those relating to corporate
behavior, are beyond government control.

   Stock prices fell sharply Wednesday on the London
Stock Exchange in what analysts described as some profit-taking
following a recent runup in prices that had lifted one key market
index to its highest level since the October 1987 stock market crash.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, which closed
at post-crash highs for two successive days Monday and Tuesday, fell
35.2 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 2,390.8.
   Volume rose to 540.1 million shares from 465.1 million shares on

   The FT-30 index closed 29.9 points lower at 1,978.7. The
500-share index was 1,337.55, down 18.13.
   Fears that British interest rates are headed higher, unappealing
profit reports by a few British construction concerns and rumors of

<HEAD>Ford Eyeing Saab-Scania Trucks, Analysts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co., a relatively small player in the
world of big trucks, is negotiating with Saab-Scania AB of Stockholm
with an eye on the Swedish company's truck business, experts say.
   Because it has been making and selling cars in Europe for more
than 60 years, Ford wouldn't need Saab's car distribution network.
Ford, in fact, sells more cars in Sweden than does Saab.
   And while Ford doesn't offer a car like the top-of-the line Saab
9000, it has the technology and engineering skill to make one, the
analysts added in interviews Tuesday.
   What Ford doesn't have is a medium- and heavy-duty truck
operation in Europe, like the Scania division of the Swedish company.
   Ford and Saab earlier this week confirmed reports that the two
companies had been holding negotiations about a business
arrangement. No one would elaborate or comment further.
   ``The jewel at Saab is the truck division,'' auto analyst Ron
Glantz of Montgomery Securities Inc. of San Francisco said earlier
this week. ``I'm not sure why Ford would bother with the car
division.''
   Saab-Scania's annual report from last year showed that its truck
division's pre-tax earnings were more than 300 times that of its car
division. For the last five years, the company's trucks have shown
profit increases while the Saab's cars have been earnings losers
from 1986-88.
   Much of the decline in car earnings came when the U.S. dollar
weakened, making imported items more expensive.
   ``The car is somewhat eccentric, I have one myself,'' Glantz
said. ``I can see why Saab would want to sell (the car division). I
can't see why Ford would want to buy.''
   ``I think it's absolutely trucks,'' said analyst Joseph Phillippi
of Shearson Lehman Hutton of New York City. ``Scania is hardly even
visible in the United States.''
   Saab-Scania of America Inc. supplies vehicles to Saab dealers in
the United States. It operated a bus manufacturing plant in Orange,
Conn., from 1984 to late 1988.
   ``Saab is basically a heavy truck maker that also makes airplanes
and cars,'' Glantz said.
   Ford Motor Co. AB was founded in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1924 to
market Ford products in the Scandinavia. The company was involved in
manufacturing in Sweden for about 10 years, mostly in the 1950s.

<HEAD>Grand Met Names Sorensen to Head Haagen-Dazs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC said Wednesday it has
named a former executive with Pepsi-Cola International to be
president and chief executive at its Haagen-Dazs subsidiary.
   Ove Sorensen will direct all worldwide operations of Haagen-Dazs,
a premium ice cream brand, including Haagen-Dazs U.S.A., with annual
sales of approximately $250 million, and Haagen-Dazs International,
with annual sales of approximately $80 million.
   Sorensen, 47, who assumes his new duties immediately, was senior
vice president, marketing and sales, at Pepsi-Cola International, a
division of Pepsico. Before joining Pepsico, he held executive
positions with Mars Inc., Cavenham Ltd., W.R. Grace and Ted Bates
Advertising.
   ``Ove's extensive experience in the U.S. food industry, with
specific expertise in global sales and marketing, makes him an ideal
candidate to lead Haagen-Dazs into the 1990's,'' said Ian Martin,
chairman and chief executive of Grand Met's food sector and chief
executive of U.S. operations for the company.
   Martin said he and Sorensen will work together ``to maintain and
strengthen Haagen-Dazs' position as the leading premium ice cream
brand in the U.S., and to expand the Haagen-Dazs name in major
international markets.''
   Sorensen will be based at the headquarters office of Haagen-Dazs
in Teaneck, N.J.
   Grand Met, a London-based concern which last year acquired the
Minneapolis-based Pillsbury Co., is a leading international food,
drinks and retailing company with annual sales of $17 billion.

<HEAD>Reports 4th-Qtr Loss Due to Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campbell Soup Co. said Wednesday it lost $195
million in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year, citing a worldwide
restructuring.
   The loss for the three-month period ended July 31 contrasted with
a profit of $72 million, or 56 cents a share, in the comparable
period a year ago.
   Sales in the fourth quarter rose 14 percent to $1.3 billion from
$1.15 billion a year earlier.
   For the full fiscal year, the Camden-based company earned $13
million, or 10 cents a share, down dramatically from $274 million,
or $2.12 a share, a year ago. The restructuring, announced Aug. 24,
produced a one-time charge of $2.01 per share against earnings for
the 1989 fiscal year.
   Sales for the year totaled $5.7 billion, up 16.5 percent from
$4.9 billion in the previous year.
   Besides soups, Campbell makes and markets a variety of foods
under the Franco-American, Vlasic, V-8 and Pepperidge Farm labels,
among many others.
   ``We sacrificed current fiscal year earnings to improve
Campbell's long-term profitability,'' said R. Gordon McGovern,
Campbell president. ``We are committed to being a world-class
manufacturer and to marketing products that are number one or two in
their categories.''
   The reorganization, which cost 2,800 jobs and closed down
manufacturing plants in New Jersey, Maryland and Tennessee, is
expected to save the company almost $15 million during fiscal 1990
and about $150 million over the next four years, McGovern said.
   Campbell, which has about 100 processing plants around the world,
said losses at facilities in the United Kingdom and Italy also
affected the company's earnings for the year and the fourth quarter.
   Campbell U.S.A., the company's largest division, reported a 15
percent increase in operating earnings for the year and a 9 percent
increase in sales.

<HEAD>Coors To Unveil New Popular-Priced Beer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adolph Coors Co. plans to unveil its new
Keystone beer this month with a high-priced advertising campaign
designed to attract male buyers by featuring their perceived
fantasies.
   The beer, the brewer's first entry into the ``popular-priced''
category, will be touted as ``bottled-beer taste in a can'' and will
sell for about $10.45 to $11.50 a case, a Coors spokeswoman said.
Coors is scheduled to begin selling the beer Monday.
   The beer will get its multi-million dollar advertising debut
during professional football and major league baseball games Sept.
16-17.
   Popular-priced beers _ such as Old Milwaukee, Meister Brau and
Milwaukee's Best _ are a bit cheaper than the premium beers, but
more expensive than economy beers.
   Although popular-priced beers have lost market share in recent
years, Coors decided to go ahead with Keystone because ``we didn't
think that we'd pick up that volume with a premium beer,'' said
Robert Klugman, company vice president of development.
   ``We promised our distributors we'd spend at a greater level''
than the $11 million to $12 million that the Stroh Brewery Co.
spends on Milwaukee brand, the nation's No. 1 popular-priced beer,
Klugman said.
   The ad campaign, designed by Foote, Cone &amp; Belding of Chicago,
features fantasies of men photographing woman candidates for a
sports magazine's swimsuit issue, pinch-hitting a home run in the
World Series and winning billions of dollars.
   Dan Fox, a company advertising executive, said the ads were
designed to be humorous. ``Lighten up, we're talking about a
six-pack of beer,'' he said. ``We shouldn't lose sight of the fact
that having a beer is supposed to be fun.''
   Klugman said Coors officials believe the advertisements ``will
not be found by most reasonable people to be offensive.''

<HEAD>France's Biggest Takeover Clears New Regulatory Hurdle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Societe des Bourses Francaises said Wednesday it
has approved a sweetened $4.1 billion bid by Compagnie Financiere de
Suez for Compagnie Industrielle and its insurance unit, Compagnie
Financiere du Groupe Victoire in what would be France's biggest
takeover ever.
   The SBF, the Paris stock exchange's self-regulatory body, also
said in a statement it has extended the close of the tender offer to
Sept. 25 from the original date of Sept. 18.
   The approval and the extension of the 27.2 billion-franc offer
bring Suez, which won a huge struggle last year for control of
Societe Generale de Belgique, one step closer to final victory.
   The only regulatory hurdle remaining for the bid is the
government's Commission des Operations de Bourse, which already
approved the initial Suez bid. The new approval is expected before
the end of the week.
   French stock analysts said the apparent success of the Suez offer
was an indication of trends in the insurance industry, as greater
integration of European businesses approaches, and in the French
stock market, where large-scale takeovers such as those common in
the United States and Britain have been rare.
   ``We have proof now that what happens in other countries could
happen in Paris,'' said Georges Dieng of the Paris broker
Cholet-Dupont. ``It's the business mentality that is evolving.''
   The previous record takeover bid in France was a bid last year by
Schneider SA of about $930 million, or 6 billion francs, for control
of Telemecanique Electrique SA.
   Alain Tchibozo, an analyst for Tuffier, Ravier, Py et Associes in
Paris, said more takeovers can be expected, especially in the
insurance industry. Among the regulations falling in 1992, when the
European Economic Community countries will end trade and business
barriers, will be those that previously made it difficult for
insurance companies to sell policies outside their own countries.
   ``There's going to be a grand battle in insurance,'' Tchibozo
said. ``It's important to have a network, and you can't start an
insurance company now, it's too expensive. You have to buy one.''
   Suez, which traces its corporate roots to the building of the
Suez Canal in the 19th century, has developed a diversified array of
assets in banking, industry, insurance and real estate.
   The takeover was not expected to cause any changes of course for
Groupe Victoire, which vaulted to the rank of second-largest French
insurance company with its recent purchase of the West German
insurer Colonia Versicherung AG.
   ``Suez has always allowed its subsidiaries a great deal of
autonomy,'' Dieng said. ``I don't think it will change much for
Victoire. Suez could eventually give them the chance for further
alliances.''
   The sweetened Suez bid made Tuesday offers 14,800 francs for each
share plus 2,276 francs a share for Victoire's common stock and
1,138 francs a share for its nonvoting stock.
   The earlier bid, which was criticized by the target company's
management as inadequate, offered 13,000 francs a share for
Compagnie Industrielle, 2,000 francs a share for Victoire common
stock and 1,000 francs a share for its non-voting stock.
   Compagnie Industrielle President Jean-Marc Vernes said he would
tender his 25.5-percent share in the company under the revised Suez
offer, virtually guaranteeing the financial holding company's bid
will succeed.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean Futures Rise On Scaled-Back Crop Estimates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices rose moderately
Wednesday amid expectations that the Agriculture Department will
reduce its harvest estimates for those commodities in a crop report
due out next week.
   Rumors circulated in the markets that Sparks Commodities Inc., a
private analytical firm based in Memphis, Tenn., was preparing to
release crop estimates lower than the USDA's August forecasts of
7.35 billion bushels of corn and 1.91 billion bushels of soybeans.
   The USDA crop report is scheduled for release Tuesday.
   In a weekly crop-progress report issued after the close of
trading Tuesday, the USDA indicated modest improvement in the corn
and soybean crops last week.
   But fears are building that a rainy month of September could slow
harvest activity, increasing the danger of frost damage to crops,
especially in eastern Illinois, Michigan and Indiana, where planting
was delayed by spring rains.
   At the close, wheat was 1} cents lower to \ cent higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.97 a bushel; corn was {
cent to 4{ cents higher with September at $2.35{ a bushel; oats were
{ cent lower to 2 cents higher with September at $1.35} a bushel;
soybeans were { cent lower to 5} cents higher with September at

   Car and light truck sales by the nation's Big
Three automakers soared 17.1 percent in late August as dealers made
room for the 1990 models heading to their showrooms, the companies
said Wednesday.
   Vehicles made by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp. sold at an average daily rate of 43,390 during the
Aug. 21-31 period, compared with a rate of 37,048 during the same
time last year.
   Car sales were up 16.6 percent, paced by Ford's 28.3 percent
rise, and trucks sold at a clip 17.9 percent better than that period
last year.
   Typically, sales are strong during the late summer as automakers
deal to clear their lots and showrooms of cars and trucks to make
way for the coming model year's vehicles. Traditionally, the model
year begins Oct. 1.
   This year, swollen inventories, incentive packages and news of
price boosts for 1990 model cars have made late-1989 model year
buying attractive.
   Some form of incentives have been in effect for many of the cars
and trucks made by the Big Three all year. For the eight months
ended Aug. 31, sales of vehicles made by the companies were running
4 percent behind the pace of the same time last year.
   Car sales were down 5.8 percent and truck sales were off 0.9
percent.
   Ford's average car-sales rate of 9,350 for late August was higher
than the daily rate of 7,289 during the same period last year.
Ford's sales pace so far this year is nearly even with last year's
rate. Ford's truck sales were up 20.3 percent in late August, but
down 1.8 percent for the entire year.
   Chrysler's late-August car sales showed a 12.7 percent gain over
last year, going to a daily rate of 4,034 during the period this
year, compared with a daily rate of 3,579 during the same time last
year. So far this year, Chrysler's car sales were off 12.1 percent
compared with last year.
   Chrysler's trucks sold at a 3.6 percent faster pace in late
August this year compared with the same time last year. Chrysler's
truck-selling pace so far this year is nearly the same as last year.
   GM's car sales rose 10.8 percent in late August to a daily rate
of 13,416 this year compared with a rate of 12,110 during the period
last year. The company's car sales through Aug. 31 of this year were
7.4 prcent behind last year. GM's truck sales were up 23.6 percent
for the period and down 0.6 percent so far this year.

<HEAD>Enterprise Oil Reaches Accord Over Texas Eastern Assets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Enterprise Oil PLC said Wednesday it has reached an
agreement with British Gas PLC and Amerada Hess Corp. of the United
States under which each of the three companies is permitted to buy
parts of Texas Eastern North Sea Inc., the North Sea oil assets of
Texas Eastern Corp.
   Enterprise Oil had planned to buy the Texas Eastern assets on its
own for $961 million, but British Gas and Amerada Hess won a British
court case which ruled that the deal would contravene a 1965
exploration agreement which granted British Gas and Amerada Hess
pre-emptive rights on the Texas Eastern assets.
   The court ruled that all three companies should be allowed to buy
a share of the Texas Eastern North Sea assets.
   Under the new agreement, Enterprise said it will pay $289 million
plus accumulated interest for all or part of Texas Eastern North
Sea's interests in three producing North Sea Fields, two fields
under development and a number of exploration prospects.
   These interests contain estimated oil reserves of 93 million
barrels, or 32 percent of Texas Eastern's total estimated reserves
of 285 million barrels. These interests will be acquired immediately.
   The remainder of Texas Eastern's interests will be divided
between British Gas And Amerada Hess.
   Following the announcement, British Gas shares rose 1.5 pence, or
2.3 cents, to 2.07 pounds, or about $3.18, while Enterprise Oil
shares climbed 5 pence to 6.08 pounds.
   Earlier this year, Enterprise Oil paid $422 million for a number
of Texas Eastern's exploration and production interests in Norway,
Indonesia, Denmark, the Netherlands and Alaska.
   Enterprise said the addition of the Texas Eastern interests would
lift its total production to around 115,000 barrels a day, compared
with an average 60,000 barrels a day in 1988.
   ``While it is disappointing not to have been able to complete the
totality of the Texas Eastern acquisition, the deal represents a
sensible resolution of the outstanding issues,'' said Enterprise Oil
Chairman William Bell.
   ``We are now well placed to become the U.K.'s leading independent
enterprise and production company.''
   British Gas and Amerada together will pay $673 million plus
interest for the remainder of the Texas Eastern interests not owned
by Enterprise. Of those assets, British Gas will hold 63 percent
while Amerada will take the remaining 37 percent interest.
   The companies said they plan to run Texas Eastern North Sea as a
company using ``the existing organization and staff resources.''

   CHICAGO _ First Chicago Corp. said Wednesday it was selling it
First Chicago Investment Advisors subsidiary, an institutional
investment service, to a group led by the unit's management in a
deal worth more than $102 million.
   Under terms of the agreement, First Chicago will receive $70
million in cash, a $15 million subordinated note and a 10 percent
ownership stake in the new company, which will be renamed Brinson
Partners Inc.
   The agreement also calls for First Chicago to receive $17 million
in dividends, the bank holding company said in a news release.
   First Chicago said it expected to recognize a pre-tax gain of $60
million to $65 million at the time of the sale, which is likely to
be completed this month.
   Gary P. Brinson, president and chief executive of First Chicago
Investment Advisors, will head the new company, which has $12
billion under management and 120 employees in Chicago, London and
Tokyo.
   First Chicago President Richard L. Thomas said the sale was
consistent with First Chicago's strategic goals.
   Thomas said First Chicago, which has more than $48 billion in
assets, would continue to offer institutional investment services
through the American National Bank and Trust Co. of Chicago and its
suburban Chicago operations.
   Thomas said First Chicago's flagship bank, the First National
Bank of Chicago, would continue to use the new company as the
adviser for its pension plan and other employee benefit plans.

<HEAD>Crazy Eddie Founder Charged With Falsifying Info, Profiting Illegally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crazy Eddie Inc. founder Eddie Antar and
former top management of the electronics chain that advertised
``insane'' prices were charged Wednesday with insider trading and
systematically altering financial books to inflate earnings.
   Antar directed a ``massive financial fraud'' that artifically
boosted pre-tax income by $29 million from 1985 to 1987, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said in a complaint filed in
federal court here. The alleged scheme included exaggerating
inventory and falsely reducing bills to suppliers, the agency said.
   Antar, a high-school dropout who built the chain to 43 outlets
from a single store in Brooklyn, N.Y., sold 5.6 million shares of
company stock for $60 million while knowing that the stock price was
based on exaggerated information, the SEC said.
   The agency seeks the return of ill-gotten trading profits,
penalties and injunctions against further violations.
   Six other ex-officials were named, including Antar's brother
Mitchell Antar, and cousins Sam E. Antar and Eddie Gindi. Mitchell
and Sam E. Antar and defendant David Panoff were also charged with
insider trading for selling stock and falsifying financial records.
SEC attorney Richard Simpson said the proceeds from their stock
sales totaled less than $1 million.
   Gindi and former employees Isaac Kairey and Kathleen Morin
settled the falsifying records charge without denying or admitting
it. They were not accused of insider trading, and the company was
not charged.
   Justin Feldman, a lawyer for Eddie Antar in a shareholder lawsuit
against the former executive, said he had not seen the SEC's papers
and could not comment. In the shareholder case, Antar denied
artificially inflating the company's figures.
   Antar, 41, dropped from sight in 1987, refusing to speak to
reporters or analysts.
   ``We're trying to track him down,'' said SEC attorney Richard
Simpson. Antar's last known address was on Manhattan's East Side,
the complaint said.
   Mitchell Antar's attorney, Marvin Gersten, called the charges
``totally false.''
   ``We intend to vigorously defend this,'' said Gersten, who noted
his client left the company in May 1987 and supported dissident
shareholders in a fight to oust Eddie Antar. Attorneys for Sam E.
Antar and Panoff declined comment.
   The U.S. attorney's office here is conducting a parallel criminal
probe.
   The first major indication of Edison-based Crazy Eddie's present
troubles came shortly after the dissident stockholders assumed
control in late 1987. New management announced it had discovered
``phantom'' inventory of $65 million.
   The company allegedly used a variety of methods, from adding
zeros on numbers in product lists to inflating prices on the books
to fabricating product returns to manufacturers.
   Rather than a ``substantial loss'' in 1987, Crazy Eddie reported
pre-tax income of $20.6 million; in 1985, its reported income of
$12.6 million was inflated by $2 million; and in 1986, reported
income of $26.5 million was overstated by $6.7 million, the
complaint said.
   The SEC complaint is the latest blow to the company known for its
raucous commercials featuring actor Jerry Carroll waving his arms
and shouting about insanely low prices.
   The ad campaign and a boom in consumer demand for video-cassette
recorders, answering machines and other electronics helped make
Crazy Eddie one of the leading electronics retail chains in the
Northeast. At its peak, Crazy Eddie had 43 stores in New York, New
Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania, 1,500 employees and sales of
$260 million.
   In June, the company filed for protection from its creditors
under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code.

<HEAD>Economics Minister Set To Approve Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's economics minister plans
to approve a proposed takeover by automaker Daimler-Benz of West
Germany's largest aerospace and defense contractor, government
sources said Wednesday.
   Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann is expected to announce his
decision to approve the takeover of Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH
at a news conference Friday, said the sources, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   The decision would culminate two years of haggling over one of
the biggest corporate mergers in West German history.
   Under terms of the merger approval, Daimler, already West
Germany's largest industrial concern, will shed MBB's interests in
battle tank manufacturer Krauss Maffei. Some of its board members
will relinquish supervisory board posts at other companies.
   The government also is expected to give up its interest in the
European Airbus Industrie project, now held through MBB, sooner than
planned.
   In addition, Deutsche Bank AG, West Germany's largest bank, will
slightly lower its 28 percent shareholding in Daimler-Benz in an
effort to ease fears over the bank's dominant role in industry, the
sources said.
   The West German Cartel Office earlier this year voted down the
merger, saying it would give Daimler a dominant position in defense,
aerospace and truck manufacturing sectors.
   The federal monopolies commission later voted to go along with
the proposal, but only if Daimler shed some of its defense holdings.
   The economics minister also hinted to Parliament on Wednesday
that he would approve the deal. He told the chamber that he would
hold ``to the basic orientation of the monopolies commision'' in
making the decision.
   Haussmann has the power to override the cartel office decision if
he determines that the merger is in the nation's economic interest.
   The West German government has backed the deal as a way of easing
its share of the subsidy burden in the loss-plagued Airbus program.
   Even by shedding some operations, the conglomerate still will be
a major global force in weapons sales and aviation technology.

<HEAD>Toy Company Dreams Up New Doll From `Nightmare' Star</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Anyone who has seen ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' horror movies
knows fiendish Freddy Krueger is no doll. But a toy company has
sweet dreams about sales of a new talking doll version of the
popular movie villain.
   Matchbox Toys (USA) Ltd. Wednesday announced creation of a
17-inch-tall, bendable doll based on the Freddy Krueger character
with a repertoire of six ghoulish sayings.
   Pull a string and the Freddy doll spouts phrases such as
``Pleasant dreams,'' ``Watch Out, Freddy's back'' or the character's
trademark diabolical laugh.
   The Matchbox doll, which will sell for about $25, will be
available in stores for Halloween sales. New Line Cinema Corp.,
creator of the ``Nightmare'' movies, sold the licensing rights for
the Freddy doll to Matchbox.
   Although attendance at the latest sequel, ``A Nightmare on Elm
Street 5: The Dream Child,'' started to fade in August after an
initial burst in the first few weeks of release, the ``Nightmare''
series has been a gold mine for film company New Line.
   Forbes Magazine has estimated that Freddy Krueger has generated
nearly $300 million in domestic and foreign box office receipts and
videocassette sales plus more than $3 million in licensing fees for
Freddy posters, T-shirts and other items.
   ``Freddy Krueger has translated nightmares into a dream
business,'' said Gene Morra, senior director of marketing at
Matchbox. ``We've known the talking doll business and we hope to do
well with Freddy because we know when Freddy talks, people listen,''
Morra said in a news release.

<HEAD>Ad Campaign Puts Miller Lite On Top, Brewer Says, But At What Cost?</HEAD>

   Miller Brewing Co. spent 16 months promoting a
Labor Day blast featuring The Who's last U.S. concert, a party that
boosted beer sales but did little to erase the industry's ``just say
yes'' stigma among critics.
   Now that the party's over, the No. 2 U.S. beer maker behind
Anheuser-Busch Cos. says its multimillion dollar ``Biggest Party in
History'' effort in Texas won more Miller customers in one of the
most lucrative beer markets.
   At the same time, anti-alcohol groups accused the brewer of
irresponsibly beckoning underage guzzlers with feel-good ads, a
charge Miller denies.
   Its Texas campaign reflected an image problem faced by many
brewers scrapping over a stagnant beer-drinking population, caused
partly by greater social awareness of alcohol's potential dangers.
Even young people say some beer ads aimed at them are offensive and
patronizing.
   Miller, especially, drew heavy criticism this spring for a
supplement mailed to college newspapers featuring bikini-clad coeds
clutching beer bottles and offering tips for men on ``sure fire ways
to scam babes.''
   The Milwaukee-based brewer, a subsidiary of consumer products
giant Philip Morris Cos., remains sensitive about the supplement,
which it admitted was in poor taste when some students objected. The
supplement was hastily withdrawn and Miller officials still bristle
when the subject is raised.
   The ``Biggest Party In History'' campaign conspicuously stayed
away from gorgeous babes and hunks extolling the brew, choosing
instead Texas-born actor Randy Quaid as pitchman.
   In addition, as part of the campaign Miller donated $1 million in
proceeds to the Texas Special Olympics, an athletic competition for
the handicapped. One commercial featured Quaid and several Special
Olympians.
   It still didn't sit well with activists against substance abuse.
   ``I've got a real question as to how (brewers) gear their
advertising toward young people,'' said Milo Kirk, a national vice
president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving and a founder of the
Dallas chapter. ``They gear their advertising around concerts and
sporting events. One brewer is using a dog, ... and studies will
show children react to animals.
   ``What is the subliminal message that they're trying to get
across here?'' she said.
   Anheuser-Busch, which uses the bull terrier Spuds McKenzie in
some of its beer ads, evidently was so stung by this kind of
criticism that it agreed to donate $250,000 to the Texas chapter of
Students Against Drunk Driving.
   Miller official Tom Cardella, who spearheaded the ``Biggest
Party'' campaign, said it was directed primarily at drinkers of
Miller Lite in Texas, where the brand had been losing ground.
   ``It is not targeted at below minimum drinking age,'' he said.
``The campaign is directed at legal age people.'' Miller also issued
colored wristbands during the party in an effort to block purchases
by minors.
   Jerry Steinman, who publishes an industry newsletter about the
beer business, defended brewer advertising as proper and ethical. He
said automobile makers are worse offenders.
   Beer companies ``don't go running around showing teen-agers in
ads,'' he said.
   ``Is it more responsible for an automobile manufacturer to
emphasize speed, and the zoom style of youth than it is for the beer
manufacturers to sponsor a concert that entertains?'' Steinman said.
   The money at stake is enormous: Steinman estimates the total
market at $45 billion a year, with Texas accounting for about 8.2
percent, second only to California.
   That means each percentage share in Texas is worth about $37
million in retail sales. Steinman's Beer Marketer's Insights Inc.
shows Miller as a brand has finished a close second to
Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. since 1983.
   Miller officials say the advertising campaign has changed that.
   ``Based on the Texas state shipment reports (compiled by the
Wholesale Beer Distributors of Texas, Inc.), year to date through
July, Miller Lite brand was up 9 percent,'' Cardella said. ``In
comparison, in 1987 Miller Lite was down 6 to 7 percent.''
   ``Prior to the campaign, Miller Lite was in the number two
position and as of this July shipment report, Miller is the number
one brand in Texas'' by 2 percentage points, he said.
   Beginning in June 1988, Miller began the advertising campaign
built around the concept of ``the biggest party in history,'' with
free concerts in six Texas cities.
   The highlight was the Sunday night concert by The Who in Dallas,
the last stop on what may be their last tour. (The Who concert in
Dallas' Cotton Bowl, which also featured Stevie Ray Vaughn and the
Fabulous Thunderbirds, was not free, although groups except The Who
performed for free earlier in the day.)
   An estimated 500,000 people attended the events: 120,000 in
Houston Saturday and about 90,000 in Dallas Sunday.
   The campaign included radio, television and print ads featuring
Quaid searching Texas for a place large enough for the party,
finding enough food, or the right date. Each spot was signed off
with the slogan ``I'll get back to you later with more details.''
   Although Quaid is hardly a matinee idol, Cardella said, he was
selected because he is a native Texan and, ``based on his
appearance, he comes across in a very fun, enjoyable manner, kind of
homespun, very folksy.''
   Miller was pleased with Quaid's acceptance, said company
spokeswoman Beverly Jurkowski, who declined to say if the brewery
was considering further campaigns with Quaid.
   Jack Raskopf, a professor at Texas Christian University in Fort
Worth who has studied advertising of controversial materials, gave
Miller high marks for the campaign.
   ``I think it helped itself,'' said Raskopf. ``They did take a
gamble, they could have had a drunk go berserk, but it was a
remarkably docile crowd.''
   He said brewers are faced with advertising ``a product that is
probably of questionable value to society, but on the other hand it
is a perfectly legitimate product.''
   Brewers have been criticized for their advertising ``since Cain
opened the first brewery,'' Raskopf said. ``Miller lost no ground
there.''
   Cardella said Miller had planned from the outset to promote
responsible drinking, and near the end of the campaign aired a
commercial featuring The Who's Roger Daltrey and Pete Townsend
urging partygoers to ``think when you drink,'' with Townsend signing
off saying, ``Remember. Who cares.''
   Ms. Kirk, however, said MADD and others had hoped Miller would
make a more direct appeal. ``Why didn't they come right out and have
Randy Quaid come out and say if you're under 21, we don't want you.''

<HEAD>American Bank Stationery Being Sold to Unit of Britain's MB Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Privately-held American Bank Stationery Co., one
of the country's largest check printers, will be sold to the U.S.
arm of Britain's MB Group PLC for $300 million cash, it was
announced Wednesday.
   The acquisition will strengthen MB America Inc.'s presence in the
growing check-printing business and enhance its ability to take
advantage of new opportunities that develop with the deregulation of
U.S. interstate banking, the company said.
   MB America has agreed to buy American Bank Stationery from an
investment group that includes company management and headed by the
New York investment banking firm Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen.
   Gibbons, Green, specialists in management buyouts, had led the
investment group in acquiring American Bank Stationery from American
Standard Inc. in 1986 for about $99.5 million.
   American Bank Stationery, based in Baltimore, is the third
largest U.S. check printer. It has about 2,300 employees working at
29 imprint plants and 2 base printing plants in 21 states.
   MB America said the acquisition will complement its existing
check-printing operations. It already owns Clarke Checks Inc., based
in San Antonio, Texas, which is the fourth biggest company in the
business.
   ``The check printing business in the United States continues to
grow,'' said Peter J. Hewett, chairman and president of MB America.
Hewett also will be chairman of Clarke American Holdings Inc., a new
holding company being formed to combine Clarke and American Bank
Stationery.
   ``The combination of Clarke Checks and ABS results in a network
of 56 printing plants and gives us nationwide coverage of virtually
all the principal markets in the United States,'' Hewett said. ``The
acquisition also positions MB to take full advantage of the new
market opportunities that will be available after the anticipated
deregulation of U.S. interstate banking in 1991.''
   American Stationery's sales totaled $80.3 million in the first
six months of 1989, up from $74.9 million in the corresponding 1988
period, MB America said.
   Sales for all of last year came to $148.6 million and profit
before interest and tax was $20.4 million while net assets at
year-end totaled $37.8 million, Gibbons, Green said in a separate
announcement.
   MB America is based in Westport, Conn. and its corporate parent
is based in Reading, England.

   The dollar drifted lower Wednesday against major
foreign currencies amid market concerns of higher interest rates
overseas.
   Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
bullion for current delivery settled at $361.60 a troy ounce, up $2
from Tuesday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid
for gold of $360.70 an ounce, up $2.10.
   Currency traders attributed the dollar's retreat Wednesday
largely to profit-taking and speculation that West Germany and Japan
might hike their interest rates to thwart the dollar's recent
strength.
   The dollar also was depressed by reported continued intervention
by the Bank of Japan.
   But Earl I. Johnson, a trader for Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago,
said overall sentiment toward the dollar remained bullish. ``We're
just seeing a technical retrenchment,'' he said.
   Johnson predicted that West Germany and Japan would keep their
interest rates stable, paving the way for further increases in the
dollar later this week.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 146.65 yen, unchanged from Tuesday.
It traded at 146.15 yen in London, and fell to 146.10 yen in New
York, down from 146.75 yen Tuesday.
   The dollar was lower against the British pound Wednesday. Each
British pound cost $1.5552, more expensive than Tuesday's $1.5385.
Sterling fetched $1.5525 in New York, up from $1.5385.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Tuesday, included: 1.97525 West German marks, down from 1.9875;
1.7048 Swiss francs, down from 1.7150; 6.6550 French francs, down
from 6.7000; 1.18015 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18065; and
1,417.875 Italian lire, down from 1,424.50.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Tuesday's rates
included: 1.9735 West German marks, down from 1.9895; 1.7045 Swiss
francs, down from 1.7170; 6.6480 French francs, down from 6.7055;
2.2280 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2415; 1,417.50 Italian lire, down
from 1,425.50; and 1.1798 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1811.
   Gold bullion closed in London at $360.25 an ounce, up from
$358.25 late Tuesday. The late Zurich bid was $359.75 an ounce, up
from $358.30.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $359.75 a troy ounce, up
from $359.35.
   Silver prices gained ground. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $5.103 a troy ounce, up from $5.063
Tuesday. Silver rose in London to $5.12 an ounce from $5.07.

   Stock prices recorded a broad loss Wednesday in
an atmosphere of uncertainty about the outlook for Federal Reserve
policy and interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 24.89 to 2,719.79
after losing 7.41 points on Tuesday.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
433 up, 1,091 down and 456 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 161.80 million
shares, up from 145.18 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 196.81 million shares.
   Analysts said a belief was spreading among investors that the
Federal Reserve was unlikely to relax its credit policy further any
time soon, given a stronger-than-expected economy.
   ``At a minimum, the Fed is not going to provide the fuel to drive
the market further,'' said Hugh Johnson at First Albany Corp. in
Albany, N.Y.
   Johnson also said portfolio managers at investing institutions
seemed to be in a wary mood.
   ``Institutional money managers have had an exceptionally good
year, and they're all trying to figure out how to protect their
gains. Most of them don't have many alternatives other than to sell
stocks,'' he observed.
   Losers among the blue chips included Merck, down 1 at 72\;
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down } at 39[; Procter &amp; Gamble,
down 1} at 126; International Business Machines, down 1 at 116}, and
Coca-Cola, down ~ at 44}.
   Pep Boys-Manny, Moe &amp; Jack fell 2[ to 13{ to rank as the day's
biggest percentage loser among Big Board issues. Late Tuesday the
company reported lower earnings for the second quarter.
   Auto issues were mixed following reports of late-August domestic
car sales that generally exceeded expectations. General Motors rose
[ to 50[, while Ford Motor dipped | to 53 and Chrysler was unchanged
at 27.
   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber climbed 4[ to 57| on takeover rumors and
speculation. The company said it had no knowledge of any impending
bid.
   Phelps Dodge picked up 2\ to 77\. The company said its directors
declared a special dividend of $10 a share, and announced plans to
buy back as many as 2 million shares of its stock.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $26.64 billion, or 0.77
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slumped 1.66 to 194.18.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 3.94 to 400.16, and S&amp;P's

   Oil futures prices headed higher Wednesday amid
speculation about tight supplies.
   A lot of the buying took place in the gasoline futures pit on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract for October delivery of
unleaded gasoline rose 1.35 cents to 55.11 cents a gallon and added
to Tuesday's gain of 0.44 cent. The November, December and January
contracts also posted gains.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
the October contract of No.2 heating oil moved 0.91 cent higher to
55.48 cents a gallon after Tuesday's gain of 0.60 cent. Contracts
for more distant months also rose.
   The October contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, settled at $19.28 per 42-gallon barrel, up
23 cents from Tuesday and bringing the contract's two-day increase
to 43 cents. Other delivery months sported similar gains.
   Michael Hiley of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said the advance in
energy prices came in reaction to a convergence of factors that
encouraged buying.
   ``It was a market that was receptive to any bullish news,'' said
Hiley, citing reports of two refinery fires as examples.
   A fire at Shell Oil Co.'s Martinez, Calif. refinery and one at
Ashland Petroleum Co.'s refinery in St. Paul Park, Minn. raised
speculation in the market about a possible tightening in supplies
temporarily.

<HEAD>Buick Introduces a Convertible Reatta</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NOVI, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buick on Wednesday introduced its long-delayed
Reatta convertible after solving engineering problems on the first
soft-top Buick since 1985.
   Buick General Manager Ed Mertz said the General Motors Corp.
division may make as many Reatta convertibles as hardtop versions of
the sporty two-seater introduced last year.
   Mertz declined to estimate sales for the 1990 versions of the
Reatta, which was introduced as a hardtop early last year, or any
other Buick line. But he predicted the full Buick division's share
of the U.S. car market would rise to about 6 percent from an
expected 5.7 percent at the end of this year.
   ``More and more people are understanding the cars we build,''
Mertz said at the formal introduction of the company's 1990 cars in
this Detroit suburb.
   Buick has sold 5,509 Reatta coupes, priced at $26,700, through
Aug. 31.
   Tracking Reatta sales is difficult since production at the Reatta
Craft Centre in Lansing was stopped or slowed several times for
retooling for convertible production and installation of a new paint
shop.
   Mertz said once Reatta convertible production gets into full
swing late this year or early next year, the company should make as
many soft tops as hardtops.
   The convertible is expected to be in dealer showrooms next spring
but prices won't be announced until later this year.
   Production of the coupe began in January 1988 at the Craft
Centre. A convertible was to be introduced later that year but
engineering problems with the top delayed introduction until this
fall.
   The convertible Reatta is the first soft-top Buick has offered
since the 1985 Riviera, which was converted by an outside company.
The last Buick-produced convertible was the 1975 LeSabre.
   Also for 1990, Buick will offer the Regal as a four-door sedan,
part of the GM-10 line of midsize cars. The cars originally were
introduced as two-door coupes, a move criticized by analysts who
thought the company was missing an important segment of the midsize
car market.

<HEAD>Sales Tax Repeal Seen as Boon to Precious Metals Investments</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 5th graf pvs, In New York ... to CORRECT city sales tax
rate to 8\ percent sted 8{ percent.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BELLAFIORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York state officials have decided that
not all that glitters should be subject to sales tax.
   As of Sept. 1, New York repealed its sales tax that had been
imposed on all investment transactions involving gold, silver,
platinum and other precious metals. The move by Gov. Mario Cuomo and
the state Legislature came this year at the urging of the banking
and investment industry.
   Under the new law, New York's sales tax won't be charged for
transactions involving $1,000 or more in precious metals for
investment purposes only.
   Sales tax is still charged on precious coins purchased for
collecting and for investment purchases under $1,000. It's also
still charged on metals and coins from South Africa, such as the
Krugerrand. The state Legislature specifically excluded them because
of that country's racist policies, state officials said.
   In New York City, where sales tax is 8\ percent, repealing the
levy is expected to boost the local metals trade. Previously,
investors had been going to states where no sales tax was charged,
such as Delaware and Illinois, said state Tax and Finance Department
spokesman Paul Rickard. About a dozen other states charge no sales
tax.
   For investors, that means they'd be able to buy metals in New
York without the mark-up that sales tax brings.
   ``Removing that barrier will have an enormous impact,'' said Nina
Lipton, research manager for Platinum Guild International, a New
York City-based platinum dealers trade association. ``You can buy
more. There will be more reasons to buy in New York.''
   For New York dealers, that means more money. Precious metals
dealers in Washington reported a 41 percent increase in gross sales
the year after that state repealed its sales tax on gold, silver and
platinum, according to a Washington, D.C.-based dealers trade
association.
   ``We'd expect New York dealers to experience a tremendous
increase in their sales,'' said Howard Segermark, president of the
Industry Council for Tangible Assets. ``New Yorkers are much more
likely to deal with New York firms.''
   And for New York state, the change is expected to bring in an
additional $955,000 in tax revenues the first year and about
$515,000 a year after that. Half that money would go to local
governments, namely New York City.
   Generally, repealing a tax means the state would lose money. But
Rickard said the state stands to make money on the move because it
expects to collect more tax revenue from storage of the precious
metals in bank vaults and other facilities.
   New York wasn't seeing much in sales tax revenues from precious
metals investments anyway because investors were buying the metals
in other states, Rickard said.
   New York's action puts precious metals on a par with stocks and
bonds, which had already been exempt from sales tax.
   ``Now investors have a choice,'' said Luis Vigdor, executive vice
president of MTB Banking Corp. ``They can walk into a store and take
their Maple Leafs and platinum Koala coins home with them or they
can store them in a vault, all without penalty.''

<HEAD>Stocks Drop, Biggest Decline Since Setting Records In August</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market on Wednesday suffered the first
sizable drop since reaching all-time highs last month, but the Dow
Jones industrial average remained within striking distance of record
levels.
   In other markets, the dollar retreated after its recent surge and
bond prices improved.
   The healthy bond market helped arrest the slide in stocks, which
saw the Dow Jones average fall nearly 40 points around midday. At
the close the average was down 24.89 points at 2,719.79.
   Analysts said there was no major economic news to account for the
stock market's retreat, which followed a rally that pushed up the
widely watched industrial average 150 points from late July to late
August.
   ``You had some sell programs in a market that was ripe for some
R&amp;R anyway,'' said Walter Murphy, a senior market analyst at Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. He was referring to computerized trading strategies that
buy and sell stocks based on predetermined formulas.
   It was an inauspicious beginning for the post-vacation autumn
trading season after the sluggish activity surrounding the Labor Day
holiday.
   ``Most traders were looking toward a pickup of the market with
the big players probably all back, so it was rather disappointing,''
said Charles Jensen, an analyst at MKI Securities Corp.
   In the bond market, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose
more than $3 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which falls
when the price rises, dropped to 8.1 percent. The improvement came
in spite of persistent concerns that the Federal Reserve will not
move to lower interest rates anytime soon.
   The dollar's decline was attributed partly to speculation that
West Germany and Japan might hike their interest rates, and to
reports that Japan's central bank was continuing to sell dollars to
knock the currency down.
   But Earl I. Johnson, a trader for Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago,
said overall demand for the dollar remained strong. ``We're just
seeing a technical retrenchment,'' he said.
   The stock market is behaving differently from two years ago. In
1987, the Dow Jones industrial average hit an all-time high on Aug.
25 and then snowballed downward, culminating in the record 508-point
decline on Oct. 19, 1987.
   This year the average hit an all-time high on Aug. 24, but
instead of peaking it set two more records in the following weeks.
Wednesday's close was still the average's 10th highest ever and left
it within easy striking range of record territory.
   Trading was nervous, and selling of stock index futures on the
Chicago markets translated into stock sales in New York.
   ``This is a comment about how temperamental the market is,'' said
Chung Lew, head stock trader at Kleinwort Benson Inc.
   Some analysts, groping for an explanation for the stock market's
decline, cited a recommendation to sell some stocks that was made by
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. strategist Barton Biggs and quoted Wednesday in
The New York Times.
   Others cited a selloff in Japan, where the Nikkei Stock Average
fell about a half percent over worries about the possibility of a
rise in Japanese interest rates.
   All things considered, ``It fell more than I thought it should
have,'' said Bill Schneider, a vice president at Kidder, Peabody &amp;
Co.

   A judge on Wednesday refused to release
identities of Unisys Corp. employees possibly involved with a
defense consultant who sold procurement secrets to the company.
   U.S. District Judge Diana Murphy said privacy interests of the
Unisys workers supersede the public's First Amendment right to
review court documents.
   Murphy has released a series of documents related to the June 14,
1988 search of Unisys property in Eagan, a suburb of Minneapolis, as
part of a nationwide investigation into defense procurement fraud,
but names of the Unisys employees in the set released Wednesday were
blackened out.
   That leaves undisclosed 39 words in all documents related to the
search. The undisclosed words all refer to identities of people
connected with the investigation.
   The judge decided to protect the identity of the Unisys employees
in the latest batch of documents even though federal prosecutors had
no objection to releasing their names. The Star Tribune and St. Paul
Pioneer Press Dispatch sued to gain the unconditional release of all
documents related to the search.
   A lawyer for the Unisys employees has maintained that disclosure
of the names would tarnish the reputations of his clients even
though they have not been charged with a crime.
   Tim McGuire, managing editor of the Star Tribune, said the
newspaper won't seek further disclosure of information in the
documents.
   ``We do not plan to pursue the case any further,'' McGuire said.
``We have gotten more information than any other circuit. We think
that that's been valuable and important.''
   McGuire said federal judges in districts around the country have
been inconsistent in ruling on media requests for the release of
documents in the case.
   The disparity signals a need for the newspaper industry and the
Justice Department to discuss disclosure issues to prevent ``this
kind of fiasco in the future,'' McGuire said.
   Mark Nadler, managing editor of the Pioneer Press Dispatch, said
the newspaper is reviewing Murphy's decision but doesn't have any
immediate plans to appeal.
   The release of the latest set of documents followed William J.
Sanda's guilty plea Friday to procuring information in 1987 for
Unisys and other defense contractors in exchange for large
consulting fees.
   Court documents show Sanda received confidential information on
the Navy's $100 million Advanced Tactical Air Command Central system
and passed it on to Unisys and other companies.
   Sanda, a former Unisys employee in Eagan, admitted passing on
confidential documents to a Unisys marketing representative who
agreed to write a series of purchase orders for Sanda for $25,000
each.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Sink on Signs of Progress in Strike Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices tumbled Wednesday, the third straight day
of losses on New York's Commodity Exchange, on perceptions that
labor tensions are easing in countries where miner strikes have
disrupted copper production.
   On other markets, energy futures rose following an oil refinery
explosion in California; meat futures rallied on renewed hopes that
pork bellies will be shipped to Poland; and corn futures gained on
dimming crop prospects.
   Copper futures settled 2.55 cents to 3.90 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $1.2575 a pound, a two-week
low.
   Copper futures had traded above $1.36 a pound as recently as Aug.
25 on supply fears prompted by strikes in Peru and Canada and mine
shutdowns in Mexico and Papua New Guinea.
   Since then, the Peruvian strike has ended, a strike has begun at
a mine in Chile, and the Bouganville mine in Papua New Guinea
reopened only to be closed a day later by a resurgence of the
landowner-led violence that prompted the original shutdown in July.
   Overall, the market perceives less of a threat to copper supplies
than it did two weeks ago, analysts said.
   ``The worst seems to be over, at least for the short term, so the
market's undergoing a healthy correction,'' said William O'Neill,
research director with Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   The easing of supply worries is based partly on settlement of the
Peruvian strike and signs that talks aimed at ending the 2-month-old
Highland Valley strike in British Columbia and the 6-day-old strike
at the Chilean Copper Co.'s El Salvador mine are making ``a kind of
grinding progress,'' O'Neill said.
   Further selling was prompted by Southern Peru Copper Co.'s
statement Wednesday that it would not have to cancel any shipments
as a result of the 16-day nationwide copper miners strike that ended
Sept. 31.
   Despite its pullback, the copper market is likely to remain
sensitive to supply fears, said Peter Cardillo, commodity trading
adviser with Josephthal &amp; Co. in New York.
   ``On the next major report of production problems, the market
will begin to rally,'' he said. ``The only way I see copper prices
really coming in is if we have signs of a recession and I really
don't see that right now.''
   Precious metal futures advanced on the Comex, largely in response
to the weaker dollar.
   Gold settled $2 to $3 higher with October at $363.70 a troy
ounce; silver was 4 cents to 4.7 cents higher with September at
$5.103 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures prices climbed on the New York Mercantile Exchange
following reports of an explosion Tuesday that shut down a Shell Oil
Co. refinery near San Francisco.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents to 23 cents
higher with October at $19.28 a barrel; heating oil was .14 cent
lower to .91 cent higher with October at 55.48 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .30 cent to 1.35 cents higher with October at
55.11 cents a gallon.
   Pork belly futures led a rally in the livestock and meat complex
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on word that the Polish
government had requested 50,000 metric tons each of pork bellies and
beef in food aid from the United States.
   Live cattle rose .03 cent to .27 cent with October at 72.37 cents
a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent to .35 cent higher with October
at 81.47 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to .88 cent higher with
October at 39.62 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.20 cents
to 1.70 cents higher with February at 44.82 cents a pound.
   Corn and soybean futures prices rose moderately on the Chicago
Board of Trade amid expectations that the Agriculture Department
will reduce its harvest estimates for those commodities in a crop
report due out next week.
   Wheat futures settled 1{ cents lower to \ cent higher with
September at $3.96} a bushel; corn was } cent to 4{ cents higher
with September at $2.35{ a bushel; oats were { cent lower to 1 cent
higher with September at $1.35 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 6{

<HEAD>Ex-Chairman Denies Wrongdoing in Stock Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NATICK, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Computer Inc.'s former chairman has
denied he violated insider trading rules by buying nearly $1 million
of Prime stock shortly before a takeover offer for the company was
made public last fall.
   David J. Dunn, who resigned last month, acknowledged in a
newspaper interview published Wednesday that the transaction looked
questionable, but insisted it was proper.
   Dunn said he and his Texas-based investment firm, Idanta
Partners, bought 64,700 shares for $986,675, or an average of $15.25
apiece, on Nov. 7 and 8, a few weeks after Prime rejected a
confidential merger proposal from investor Bennett S. LeBow's MAI
Basic Four Inc. of Tustin, Calif.
   A week later, when LeBow publicly offered to buy Prime for $970
million, the market value of Dunn's and Idanta's shares jumped to
about $18 each, yielding a paper profit of more than $177,000.
   Dunn told the Middlesex News of Framingham that he had not taken
LeBow's private proposal seriously and was surprised by the
subsequent public offer.
   ``Obviously, you don't trade stock based on material information
that is not public, but we didn't believe it was material. We
thought it was an effort to get (Prime to buy MAI),'' he said.
   ``As soon as (LeBow) did make the tender offer, I went to the
attorneys and I offered to sell the stock to the company at the
price we paid for it, but they said that would indicate that we
thought we had done something wrong.
   ``I agree with you that this is unusual, but the facts are above
board, nothing has been hidden.''
   Prime Computer, based in Natick, makes minicomputers and is the
second largest maker of computer-aided design and manufacturing
equipment, surpassed only by International Business Machines Corp.
It has 11,000 employees and earned $19 million on sales of $1.6
billion last year.
   After LeBow pursued Prime for more than eight months, the company
reached a merger agreement this summer with J.H. Whitney &amp; Co., a
New York venture capital firm, for $20 a share, or more than $1
billion.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment on
whether it has investigated Dunn's stock trading. Massachusetts
regulators said the state was not probing the transaction.
   Some securities analysts said the trading had raised eyebrows on
Wall Street.
   ``If your question is, do people know about it? Yes. If your
question is, does it smell? Yes,'' said John Logan, industry analyst
for the Aberdeen Group in Boston. ``But is it insider trading? Well,
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the courts would have to
decide that.''
   Dunn did not return messages left Wednesday at his office in San
Diego. It was not clear whether he and Idanta have sold any of the
stock.

   Donald Trump, whose name already adorns two

   The billionaire developer was to join Thursday with executives

``Trump Card,'' a new television series, but the deal fell through,
said Barry Stagg, spokesman for Warner Bros. Television.
   ``The announcement is off,'' said Stagg. ``There are last minute

   Details on the show and its format were not available Wednesday.
Stagg said the negotiations would continue, although there would be
no announcement on the show's status until next week at the earliest.

   McKesson Corp. Chairman Thomas W. Field Jr.
resigned after a dispute with the pharmaceuticals company's board
over his management style and plans, the company announced Wednesday.
   Former chairman and chief executive Neil E. Harlan was elected to
his old jobs on an interim basis, McKesson, a leading distributor of
pharmaceuticals and other medical products, said in a statement.
   Harlan stepped down as the company's chief executive officer in
July 1986 but served as chairman until retiring in July 1988.
   Field's resignation was accepted by the board of directors, the
company said. He resigned as McKesson's chairman, president, chief
executive officer, director and other posts with company
subsidiaries.
   Field joined McKesson in 1984 and was president and chief
operating officer until July 1986, when he was named president and
chief executive officer. Field was named chairman, president and
chief executive in July 1988.
   The company in July reported record first-quarter revenue but
said income from continuing operations was flat, while earnings rose
1 percent over the same period last year.

<HEAD>Eastern Strikers Rally At Capitol, March to White House</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the AFL-CIO, other union leaders
and several members of Congress joined striking Eastern Airlines
workers Wednesday at the end of a 26-day, 3,000-mile march to
support the six-month-old walkout.
   Several hundred members of unions representing pilots, flight
attendants and mechanics paraded to the White House after a rally of
speeches, songs and chants against Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank
Lorenzo on the west steps of the Capitol.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland demanded that the Senate bring to
a vote a measure to force resolution of the strike. The House
already has approved such a bill after President Bush refused to
follow a National Mediation Board recommendation in March that he
appoint an emergency board to investigate the labor dispute.
   Appointment of such a board would have banned a strike for 60
days.
   ``We're in a tough battle against one of the worst employers in
the country,'' Kirkland said. ``We know which side the president of
the United States is on. He's made that abundantly clear.''
   The rally came at the end of a march and caravan that started in
Miami on Aug. 12. Thirteen Eastern employees were introduced who,
leaders said, traveled the entire route. Hundreds of others
participated in mile-long relays of a symbolic picket sign along the
East Coast route that included New York and Boston.
   The unions accuse Lorenzo of planning to strip away Eastern's
assets until the airline is dead. Lorenzo says he is gradually
building it back up to a major carrier and has been adding flights
and personnel since filing for court protection from creditors on
March 9.
   Miami-based Eastern is a subsidiary of Lorenzo's Texas Air, which
also owns Continental Airlines.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., saying ``working men have to stick
together'' to fight for the Eastern workers, said he would push for
Senate approval of the emergency legislation.
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., said the strikers were ``fighting for
justice for all American workers.'' He said Lorenzo was trying to be
a ``modern-day robber baron.''
   Rep. Charles Hayes, D-Ill., said congressional inaction would
mean support for Lorenzo.
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., put on a red shirt that urged a boycott
of Eastern and Continental, and said, ``I believe Frank Lorenzo is
vicious and greedy.''

<TEXT>
   While Miss America contestants stroll down the runway in Atlantic
City next week, another string of beauties will chug into New York
Harbor for the first-ever Tugboat Beauty Contest, complete with Bert
Parks as emcee.
   The contestants in the Sept. 13 event will be strutting more
horsepower than cheesecake, but organizers believe beauty _ when it
comes to tugboats _ is definitely in the eye of the beholder.
   The event is being staged coincidentally with the Miss America
pageant to promote the often overlooked tug industry and the revival
of Jersey City, N.J., as a port of call.
   The vessels will be judged ``on how well they are dressed, their
trim, sparkle, maneuverability, charm and overall appearance,'' said
Lauri Masur, one of the organizers.
   Among the leading contenders are the Rebecca P., a 105-foot
knockout with 3,000 horsepower and a 32-foot beam, and the Sea Star,
which is equally broad at the beam, 109 feet long and 2,300
horsepower.
   Hubba, hubba.
   Unlike the Atlantic City affair, both boy tugs and girl tugs are
eligible for the title. About 10 tugs are expected to compete, all
members of the Towboat &amp; Harbor Carriers Association of New York and
New Jersey.
   Parks, a former Miss America host, will introduce the
contestants, which will sashay down a channel in Jersey City that
leads into New York Harbor.
   But Parks won't get the chance to croon a rendition of ``There
She Is,'' the Miss America theme. Instead, a band will play ``A
Pretty Girl'' and other similar ditties.
   Unlike the Miss America Pageant, where the winner receives a
$35,000 scholarship, ``Miss Tugboat'' will win $2,500 in cash to
spend on whatever his or her owners want, Ms. Masur said.
   In place of a crown and sash will be a more seaworthy symbol.
``She'll get a flag to run up her line proclaiming her the winner,''
Ms. Masur said.
   The Rebecca P., representing Poling Transportation of Staten
Island, N.Y., is a 9-year-old tug adorned in white, pale blue and
yellow. For her ``talent,'' she can ply both inland and coastal
waters, said Anthony Rondinone, Poling's general manager.
   ``As far as we're concerned, she's the winner,'' he said.
   Fourteen-year-old Sea Star's owner, Peter W. Sheehan of
Spentonbush-Red Star Co. in New York, takes exception to that
prediction.
   Dressed in white, green and yellow, Sea Star can do ship docking
and tow barges up to 85,000 barrels.
   ``She has two propellers, and she will make a beautiful
360-degree turn so you can see her full dress,'' he said.
   In Atlantic City this week, the 51 Miss America contestants are
being quizzed on controversial subjects such as abortion and flag
burning. The tugboat contestants won't be held to such standards.
   ``This is strictly a beauty pageant,'' said Ms. Masur with tongue
firmly in cheek.
   Judges include Jersey City Mayor Gerald McCann, Coast Guard Capt.
Robert North, Hudson County Executive Robert Janiszewski and U.S.
Rep. Frank J. Guarini, D-N.J.

<HEAD>UAL Meets With Transportation Secretary on Buyout Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner met Wednesday with the
head of United Airlines in Washington but said the government is
merely an observer in the proposed employee-management takeover.
   ``I haven't prejudged anything,'' Skinner said before meeting
with Stephen Wolf, chairman of United parent UAL Corp., on plans for
the nation's second-largest carrier.
   Skinner said one of the department's top priorities has been
scrutinizing the proposed takeover of Northwest Airlines by Los
Angeles investor Alfred Checchi. He said his staff will add United
to its watch list.
   Skinner said he should have a better idea in a couple of weeks
about what, if any, action his department should take on the buyout
trend. He said he may make some recommendations to President Bush.
   The transportation secretary recently expressed concern about
potential foreign involvement in U.S. airline takeovers. British
Airways PLC is expected to help finance the $300-a-share
labor-management UAL buyout offer.
   The $6.75 billion offer for Chicago-based UAL is spearheaded by
United pilots who belong to the Air Line Pilots Association. The bid
Friday topped the $6.19 billion offered last month by Los Angeles
investor Marvin Davis.
   Skinner told reporters he and other Transportation Department
officials also will meet with representatives of United's Machinists
union, which has expressed skepticism over the labor-management
buyout plan.
   John Peterpaul, general vice president of the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said United isn't
worth what's being offered for it and that the huge amounts that
would be borrowed to finance a buyout could put the airline in
jeopardy.
   ``You're talking about a lot of debt,'' Peterpaul said. ``You're
talking about an astronomical load for United to carry into the
future. And we don't see this future as rosy as a lot of people see
it.''
   The Machinists, representing 25,000 of United's 70,000 employees,
have supported recapitalization as a way to fight Davis.
   The pilot-management proposal, which would create the nation's
largest employee-controlled company, is based solely on
participation of United's 6,300 pilots, though the pilots have said
they would like all employees to participate.
   Officials of the Association of Flight Attendants, which
represents 12,700 United workers, say they remain open to discussing
participation in a buyout.

<HEAD>EBDC Chemicals Being Withdrawn for Fruits and Vegetables</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three manufacturers of a widely used class of
fungicides announced Wednesday they are halting sales for use on
dozens of fruits and vegetables because of government concerns that
the potential cancer risks are too high.
   The fungicides involved, the ethylene bisdithiocarbamate or EBDC
class, have been under a special review by the Environmental
Protection Agency since 1987 because a breakdown product has been
shown to cause cancer in test animals.
   In a joint announcement the three manufacturers _ the Du Pont
Co., Pennwalt Corp. and Rohm &amp; Haas Co. _ said they ending sales for
many fruits and vegetables ``to maintain public confidence'' in the
foods.
   The decision came as the EPA was preparing to order curbs on EBDC
uses because of recent tests that indicated unacceptable cancer
risks from residues in some foods.
   The manufacturers maintained that despite their action, the
chemical is safe for consumers if used properly.
   But, according to EPA documents, agency tests show that the
cancer risks posed by EBDC residues on some foods can be more than
23 times the one-in-one million level the agency uses to indicate
neglible risk. In the case of residues on tomatoes it can be 63
times the benchmark level.
   That contrasts to EPA's estimate of a lifetime cancer risk of 45
times the benchmark for Alar, the widely publicized chemical that
caused an uproar earlier this year becuase of its use on apples.
   The EPA estimates that the chances of a person getting cancer
during a lifetime from exposure to EBDC residues on all foods could
be as high as one in 10,000, a level that has triggered restrictions
on many chemicals in the past.
   That result assumes crop residues are at the maximum permitted
level. The companies are conducting marketbasket studies to
determine actual exposure to consumers since the chemical is known
to decay with time.
   EPA spokesman John Kasper said he could not immediately provide
specific test results, but added, ``We've got some risk estimates
that we're concerned about.''
   Kasper said the manufacturers' voluntary withdrawl would be
examined by the agency. ``It's entirely possible we could make (the
restrictions on EBDC's use) even more stringent to reduce the risks
even further,'' he said.
   One form of the chemical, mancozeb, is sold by all three
companies and another form, maneb, is sold by Pennwalt.
   ``The action is being taken to maintain public confidence in the
safety of fruits and vegetables,'' said the three manufacturers in a
joint statement. They said the chemical could continue to be used on
13 crops.
   Although the announcement named no products, an environmental
group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the 13 products
for which EBDC will continue to be used include potatoes, sugar
beets, sweet corn, tomatoes and wheat and almonds.
   The fungicide has been used on more than 70 crops. The major
crops for which use will be discontinued include apples, carrots,
celery, cucumbers, melons, pears, squash and pineapples, according
to the environmental group.
   The fungicide has been used for nearly 40 years and according to
some estimates from 12 to 18 million tons are used annually.

<HEAD>Roast Beef Chain Names Irving Riese President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arby's Inc. on Wednesday named Manhattan
restaurant baron Irving Riese as its new president, succeeding
Leonard H. Roberts, who was fired after criticizing the roast beef
chain's principal owner, Miami financier Victor Posner.
   The move triggered prompt criticism from a group of franchise
holders quarreling with Posner, who has rejected their $200 million
buyout bid for the Atlanta-based 2,100-restaurant chain.
   Riese is partner with his brother Murray in The Riese
Organization, one of the nation's largest privately owned restaurant
firms, controlling more than 500 locations in 33 states, including
many restaurants of various chains at prime locations in New York.
   ``Mr. Riese brings with him the experience of The Riese
Organization,'' Arby's Inc. said in a statement from Miami Beach.
The statement said Posner Riese's election was part of a
``continuing commitment to the growth and expansion of Arby's.''
   Roberts, who became president and chief executive officer of
Arby's in July 1985, was fired a few hours after releasing a sharply
worded letter resigning as vice chairman of the board of Posner's
DWG Corp.
   DWG owns 60 percent of Chesapeake Financial Corp., which, in
turn, owns Arby's.
   Roberts' letter was highly critical of Posner and his decision
not to negotiate with the R.B. Partners group, eight Arby's
franchisees who operate more than 500 stores and have offered $200
million for the company.
   The appointment of Riese as Arby's president drew fire Wednesday
from the AFA Service Corp., an organization owned by Arby's 500
franchisees and holding marketing and advertising rights to the
company trademark.
   AFA Service Corp. Chairman Joseph Smaltz blasted the appointment
as ``totally unacceptable,'' in view of The Riese Organization's
ownership of Burger King and Roy Rogers stores and other restaurant
franchises.
   Smaltz said Arby's franchise holders were ``outraged'' and would
``examine every alternative to protect the value of our businesses
and the Arby's system from further erosion by Mr. Posner's actions.''
   ``Mr. Posner deprived us of the most successful chief executive
in our history,'' Smaltz said. ``Today he offers us a replacement
with a serious conflict of interest, questionable motives and no
relevant experience.''

<HEAD>Former S&amp;L President Convicted of Conspiracy, Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former savings and loan executive has been found
guilty of using more than $55,000 in thrift funds to contribute to
political campaigns and hire women from topless bars to accompany
S&amp;L officials on trips.
   Former Vernon Savings and Loan President Patrick G. King, a
former state trooper and once the state's second-ranking thrift
regulator, was convicted Tuesday of charges including conspiracy and
fraud.
   King could receive 65 years in prison and fines up to $500,000 at
sentencing Nov. 2.
   ``Mr. King was an important kingpin in the savings and loan
industry,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement.
   ``His conviction sends a message that no matter how high up the
corporate ladder the wrongdoing was committed, it will not go
unprosecuted.''
   The government had charged King approved inflated expense
vouchers and bogus bonus payments to reimburse employees for
political contributions in 1986 and thus circumvent campaign
contribution laws.
   Some of the contributions went to House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., and Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
but prosecutors said the politicians were not aware where the
contributions came from.
   In addition, King was accused of paying women recruited at
topless bars to accompany Vernon officials and L. Linton Bowman III,
head of the regulating Texas Savings and Loan Department, on two
out-of-state trips.
   Testimony indicated King approved payments of $100 to $200 per
woman.
   Vernon was shut down in 1987 by federal regulators in a $1.3
billion bailout.
   King was the first Vernon official to go to trial, although
others have pleaded guilty or been granted immunity for cooperation
in the investigation of Vernon, often cited as one of the worst
examples of abuses in the industry.

<HEAD>Ampco-Pittsburgh Boosts Stake in Midway Airlines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ampco-Pittsburgh Corp. said Wednesday it had
increased its stake in Midway Airlines Inc. to 9.6 percent of the
carrier's common stock and indicated it was still considering a
takeover attempt.
   Ampco-Pittsburgh, a manufacturer that previously acknowledged a
6.6 percent stake in Midway, revealed the additional stock
accumulation in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   In its original SEC filing Aug. 7, the Pittsburgh-based company
said it had bought Midway shares ``for investment and to acquire a
significant equity interest,'' adding that it ``may also consider
seeking to acquire control of Midway.''
   Ampco spokesman Marshall Berkman said the company's purpose in
acquiring the additional shares was the same as in its original
filing.
   Midway spokeswoman Sandra Allen said that to her knowledge,
officials of Midway and Ampco-Pittsburgh had not discussed Ampco's
interest in the Chicago-based airline, the nation's 16th largest.
   ``We're treating it as a routine business investment,'' she said.
   Midway Chairman David Hinson has said Midway is not interested in
being acquired.
   Ampco said its subsidiary Ampco-Pittsburgh Securities II Corp.
acquired 960,000 shares of Midway common stock as of Sept. 5 at an
average price of $16.77 a share. Midway closed at $20.62{ a share
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, up $1.62{.
   Midway announced last week it had strengthened its defenses
against a hostile takeover by loosening the trigger on its
shareholder rights plan, commonly called a ``poison pill.''
   The shareholder rights plan would take effect if an outsider
acquired 15 percent of Midway's stock. The plan would increase the
number of outstanding shares to make a buyout prohibitively
expensive.
   Midway, founded in 1979, is a fast-growing airline serving 51
U.S. cities from Los Angeles to Boston and from Chicago to Miami. It
operates from Midway Airport in Chicago.
   Ampco-Pittsburgh owns Buffalo Forge Co. and Union Electric Steel
Corp.

<HEAD>Georgia Gulf Agrees to Meet With NL Industries Over Buyout Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of Georgia Gulf Corp. said Wednesday
they will meet with NL Industries about a possible $55-a-share
merger or acquisition after NL Industries threatened a move to oust
Georgia Gulf's directors.
   NL Industries, whose biggest shareholder is Texas billionaire
Harold C. Simmons, sent a letter dated Wednesday to Georgia Gulf
officials warning that it planned to seek consent from other
shareholders to replace the chemical company's board of directors.
   In the company's response, Dennis Chorba, a Georgia Gulf vice
president and its general counsel, said he and President Jerry
Satrum will meet with Landis Martin of NL Industries on Sept. 13 in
Atlanta.
   Chorba also said Georgia Gulf will not alter its incorporation
papers or effect a transaction that would prevent shareholders from
considering an NL Industries offer.
   He wrote that would change ``if NL Industries, or any other
stockholder, were to take any action, such as filing preliminary
proxy materials ... holding discussions with other stockholders
regarding a consent solicitation or otherwise taking steps to
implement a removal of the directors of the company.''
   NL Industries owns 2.3 million shares of Georgia Gulf common
stock, about 9.9 percent of its outstanding shares.
   Earlier advances by NL Industries prompted a series of
anti-takeover measures by Georgia Gulf.
   NL Industries and NL Chemicals Inc., both controlled by Simmons,
first disclosed an ownership in Georgia Gulf in early July,
reporting the purchase of 8.3 percent of outstanding shares. In
mid-August, the Simmons companies announced they would look at
options, including a takeover.

<HEAD>Burger King's New Ad Agency Debuts 99-Cent Promotion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burger King Co. on Wednesday announced a month-long
national promotion developed by its new advertising agency that
features a different sandwich each weekday for 99 cents.
   The daily special, which will run through Sept. 29, was developed
by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and the UniWorld Agency, which does Burger
King's minority advertising.
   It's the first work done by New York-based Saatchi &amp; Saatchi for
Burger King since the fast-food giant fired N.W. Ayer Inc., which
came up with the ``We do it like you'd do it'' theme in June.
   ``We are very excited about this promotion,'' said Gary
Langstaff, Burger King's executive vice president of marketing. It
``represents some of the best promotional advertising in the
business.''
   Burger King spokeswoman Cori Zywotow said the new commercials
highlight the diversity of the chain's menu.
   ``They're just really upbeat, fast-paced spots,'' she said.
   Recent Burger King ad campaigns that met with less-than-favorable
reviews included a search for Herb, a nerd who had never been to a
Burger King, and the themes ``This is a Burger King Town'' and ``The
Best Food for Fast Times.'' Those were produced by the J. Walter
Thompson agency of New York before the agency was replaced by Ayer
in September 1987.
   Burger King announced in May it was awarding its $215 million
account to Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, a British-owned agency that will focus
on promotions and products, and D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles of New
York, which will concentrate on image.
   Miami-based Burger King changed hands in January as part of
British conglomerate Grand Metropolitan PLC's acquisition of
Pillsbury Co., Burger King's parent.
   Burger King and its franchisees, which operate more than 5,800
restaurants worldwide, had systemwide sales of more than $5.4
billion in fiscal 1988.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank South Corp. said Wednesday that a program to
boost its income by $15 million annually will include reducing the
company's work force by 10 percent, or about 300 jobs.
   ``We will reorganize certain areas, spread out layers of
management, eliminate duplications and, in general, cut costs,''
said President and Chief Executive Officer Robert P. Guyton. ``At
the same time, we are fully protecting our commitment to quality
service.''
   In a statement, Guyton said the reduction is in anticipation of a
slower economy and a more competitive banking industry in the 1990s.
Atlanta-based Bank South is a $5 billion multibank holding company
with 136 banking offices in Georgia and Pensacola, Fla.
   The bank said the restructuring should cut annual expenses by 8
percent to 10 percent, or about $15 million.
   The company said the job reductions would be phased in, with many
of them coming through attrition. Other affected employees, it said,
will receive help finding other employment and severance packages.

<HEAD>Banca Nazionale Files Complaint Against Atlanta Branch Manager</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banca Nazionale del Lavoro has filed a complaint with
Italian justice officials against the former manager of its branch
in Atlanta, Ga., over alleged unauthorized transactions, the bank
announced Wednesday.
   Banca Nazionale, Italy's largest state-owned bank, is under
investigation by U.S. and Italian authorities for alleged
irregularities at the Atlanta branch in the financing of exports to
Iraq.
   Banca Nazionale said last week that the matter involved 2,500
transactions by its Atlanta branch that were not authorized by
either the bank's North American management or the head office in
Rome.
   The transactions involved letters of credit for exports to Iraq.
The exports concerned mostly grain and the bank has said no arms
shipments were involved.
   Banca Nazionale said the transactions were never reported on the
books by the branch management. It has not provided a reason for the
alleged irregularities, and said the value of the transactions has
yet to be determined.
   The bank has said the letters of credit, while correct
technically, exceeded the credit ceiling that Banca Nazionale set
for the branch. The investigation was complicated by the
sophisticated methods used to keep the transactions off the official
books, bank spokesman Claudio Cremona said.
   The bank's board of directors has announced an extraordinary
meeting for Thursday to discuss the Atlanta affair. Many Italian
politicians have said Banca Nazionale Chairman Nerio Nesi should
step down.
   Banca Nazionale said it suspended the Atlanta branch manager,
Christopher Drogoul, 35, and replaced him with Luciano Alfredo
Silvestri, manager of its branch in Miami, Fla.
   Banca Nazionale is wholly owned by the Italian Treasury and by
state entities, but the bank has non-voting savings shares trading
on the Milan stock exchange.
   The seurities industry watchdog committee Consob suspended
trading in Banca Nazionale shares Tuesday after they dropped 9.7
percent to 14,900 lire, or $10.50, Monday, down from 16,500 lire, or
$11.80, Friday and down from a 1989 high of 18,210 lire, or $13,
reached August 8.
   The bank has said it doesn't expect to incur any losses from the
affair because all transactions were guaranteed either by the U.S.
Commodity Credit Corp. or by the central bank of Iraq.
   Banca Nazionale has been under investigation by the U.S. Federal
Reserve System and Georgia state banking authorities since the
middle of August. The Bank of Italy, the central bank, is
collaborating in the probe.

   Braniff Inc. announced Wednesday it has
agreed to lease 20 new Boeing 737-300 jets for about $600 million
from Guiness Peat Aviation.
   The new aircraft will be delivered between June 1990 and June
1992.
   The lease agreement releases Braniff from a contract to purchase
12 new Fokker 100 aircraft from GPA Fokker Ltd., an affiliate of
Guiness Peat Aviation, an Irish aircraft leasing concern.
   ``We believe that the F-100 is an excellent, state-of-the-art
aircraft, but the larger, longer-range Boeing 737-300 better suits
our present route system and traffic demand,'' said William G.
McGee, chairman, president and chief executive of Braniff, which is
based in Orlando.
   Guiness Peat Aviation said it has reached preliminary agreements
with other carriers to lease the 12 F-100s.
   GPA New York Financial Services, a subsidiary of Guiness Peat
Aviation, will arrange $75 million in financing for Braniff under
the agreement, which must be approved by both companies' boards of
directors.
   The Boeing 737-300 typically seats 130 passengers, whereas the
F-100 only seats 101 passengers.
   Braniff plans to build its future aircraft fleet around the
737-300s and its previously-leased Airbus 320s. Braniff ordered 100
A-320s, which it began using Aug. 28.
   The airline said its revenue passenger miles increased 2.2
percent in August over the same month in 1988. A revenue passenger
mile is equal to one paying passenger flying one mile.

   Diet Coke will join forces with ``Batman'' this
fall to help Warner Home Video launch the movie's videocassette
sales.
   A multimillion-dollar promotional campaign to begin in November
will include a 30-second commercial for Diet Coke that features
Alfred the Butler, the Batmobile and the Caped Crusader. At the end
of the commercial a tagline will announce the availability of the
videocassette.
   Filmed during production of the ``Batman'' movie, the commercial
stars Tony Award-winner Michael Gough as Alfred.
   The shot features Batman racing to ``Gotham Corner Store'' to
stock up on Diet Coke while Alfred phones ahead to warn the store
manager of his arrival, saying, ``Just look for a black car ...
rather difficult to miss ... and by the way, the gentleman is
usually in quite a rush.''
   The Gotham Corner Store commercial also appears in the
videocassette, which will be available Nov. 15.
   ``Batman'' is the all-time No. 4 film in terms of earned revenue
and the most successful movie in Warner Bros. history.
