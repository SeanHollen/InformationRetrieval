   Alexander ``Junior'' Stevens traveled seven
miles across the Bronx every morning to Alfred E. Smith High
School, an all-boys vocational school with a reputation as a quiet
place, a ``safe'' school.
   ``Junior'' was shot to death outside the school cafeteria Nov.
14; a 15-year-old classmate was charged. The two were playing with
a .22-caliber pistol when it accidentally went off, police said.
   ``There are plenty of safe schools all over the city where kids
are sitting there with guns in their bookbags. They just haven't
decided to shoot yet,'' said Ed Muir, of the United Federation of
Teachers, the teachers union.
   ``Junior's'' was the first killing in a city school since 1978.
But in a system where violence is routine, it caused little uproar
among students.
   ``The thing that everyone was taken aback by is that the kids
seem to be taking this so calmly. It's just another kid whacked,''
said Muir.
   Bruce Irushalmi, director of the Board of Education Office of
School Safety, said students ``bring guns to school because they
don't feel safe going to and from school. ... They say they need
them to create a balance of power.''
   Muir is more cynical. ``Some kids feel they actually need it for
protection, and some are businessmen who have large quantities of
cash and thought it the prudent thing not to apply for a pistol
permit.''
   From September 1988 to June 1989, 1,854 weapons were seized at
schools, ranging from razor-edged box cutters to automatic weapons.
At 15 schools where roving teams of security guards used metal
detectors, five guns and 815 other weapons were confiscated during
the 1988-1989 school year _ a year that saw 1,356 students
assaulted, 183 robbed, 78 sexually assaulted and 105 caught using
controlled substances. Figures for this year were unavailable.
   To balance the arms race, New York City spent $62 million on
security in 1988, about 1 percent of the $7 billion budget. Metal
detectors accounted for about $4 million of that; the rest
supported 2,450 uniformed, but unarmed, security guards who police
a system with just under a million students.
   ``If we were a police force, we would be the 10th largest police
force in the country,'' Irushalmi said.
   To Muir, it isn't enough. He cites the increase in gun incidents
_ twice a week last year, 19 in the first 34 school days of this
year _ as evidence that the city's schools are dangerous places to
be. Figures kept by his union show a 5 percent increase in crime
inside schools during the 1988-89 school year.
   Preliminary figures for 1989 showed an 11 percent increase in
school crime in September, and Muir said 44 teachers were assaulted
during the first month of school this fall, compared to 27 during
September 1988.
   But Irushalmi, whose two children attend public schools, says
the problem is not inside the buildings. Reports of violence inside
schools have fallen from 15,000 a year in 1981 to 9,000 in 1988-89.
Outside is another story.
   ``For anyone under 18 this is Dodge City and you have to carry a
piece,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, we don't have Miss Kitty at the
Long Branch to make sure you check your piece at the door.''
   In one corner of this Dodge City, outside Prospect Heights High
School in Brooklyn, a student was shot on the very first day of
school.
   ``There's no safety in Prospect Heights,'' despite spot checks
with metal detectors, said Bob ``Brother'' Abu, 15. ``If they don't
come on Monday, they put the weapons in their lockers. So when the
weapon detectors come on Wednesday, they have their weapons in the
school already.''
   ``There ain't no safety,'' said his 17-year-old friend, who
identified himself as Carl, or Shrapnel Insepticon, a senior at
Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn. He wore a blue bandana over
his lower face, Jesse James style, and said he was a member of the
Decepticons, a teen-age street gang named after evil characters in
``The Transformers,'' a cartoon show.
   The loosely knit gang, which has taken to bandanas as
identification, has been accused of taking part in Halloween
rampages on Manhattan's East Side, as well as in wolfpack-type
attacks on students at bus and subway stations.
   More than 100,000 students stayed away from school on Halloween,
apparently out of fear; more than 250 high school-age youths were
arrested as they roamed the city, robbing, intimidating and
assaulting pedestrians and merchants.
   Muir and the UFT have proposed some remedies: metal detectors in
every school, a police liaison for junior high schools, stiffer
penalties for anyone caught with guns. But these steps, all agree,
will not solve the underlying problems that lead to school violence.
   ``The schools are a mirror of society,'' Irushalmi said, citing
drugs and crime, the easy availability of weapons, ``the diminution
of values.''
   ``These kids don't distinguish between the schools and the
streets,'' Muir said. ``They don't see any difference.''
   ``We really think it's related to drugs. Part of it has to do
with the sales, but another part is a lot of the kid's parents are
using drugs, and the kids are acting out,'' said Gretchen Rausch,
an assistant commissioner of the Probation Department who began her
career as a probation officer in 1967.
   Arrests of kids ages 7 to 16 jumped 27 percent from 1987 to
1988, she said.
   But the kids say there is no simple reason why they prey upon
each other and their teachers.
   Sean Chittick, 17, is a senior at Murry Bergtraum High School,
located across from police headquarters and regarded by many as one
of the city's safer schools. Still, he sees violence all around
him, and he is mystified.
   ``It just be happening for no type of reason,'' he said. ``Now
they just be killing them for gold jewelry, or `You lookin' at my
girl.'''

   It begins with a male actor recounting a
romantic date _ dinner by candlelight, conversation by the
fireplace.
   ``Finally, we kissed,'' the actor says. ``Then he asked if I
enjoyed safer sex. I have never felt so good about saying yes.''
   The city unveiled the 30-second television spot, which ends with
the line ``rubber up for safety,'' with much fanfare last summer as
part of its latest AIDS education campaign.
   Months later, viewers of late-night programming on a local cable
channel are about the only ones who have seen it.
   To avoid acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the surgeon
general recommended that people learn how the disease is
transmitted and how it can be prevented through use of condoms.
   The sloganeering has changed from ``safe sex'' to ``safer sex,''
acknowledging that no sex practice, including condoms, offers
fool-proof protection against AIDS.
   But getting the message to some of the people most at risk, such
as homosexual men or inner-city youths, without offending the
masses is difficult at best, say the people charged with creating
the ads.
   Critics of explicit AIDS education campaigns warn they could
backfire on health professionals and erode public support.
   ``I think they're turning people off,'' said Dr. Elizabeth M.
Whelan, president of the American Council on Science and Health, a
consortium of more than 200 physicians and scientists active in
consumer education.
   Reed V. Tuckson, the public health commissioner in Washington,
D.C., announced in 1987 that he wanted a sophisticated multimedia
campaign similar to those that ``sell Nike tennis shoes to poor
black youths.''
   The department then argued with city officials and community
groups for more than a year over wording on posters; it negotiated
with local news outlets and the public transit system, which would
not display placards with the word ``condom.''
   ``I did not anticipate ... significant opposition at so many
different levels,'' Tuckson said.
   Reaction was negative in some Boston quarters when a social
service group, Action for Boston Community Development, unveiled
its AIDS poster. It shows four young men, three with hats and one
holding a condom over his head, with the caption ``Be cool. Wear
your jimmy hat.''
   The group received complaints that by using the term ``jimmy
hat'' _ slang for condom and also the title of a rap music hit _
the posters spoke specifically to young people and encouraged them
to have sex.
   ``People who are dying of AIDS and are in their 20s obviously
contracted the disease while in their teens,'' Laura Palmer, an
ABCD spokeswoman, said in reaction.
   Nevertheless, the posters, ready in March, didn't make it onto
city buses and subways until June, held up by Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority review.
   New York's ``rubber up for safety'' campaign includes two
television spots, the one so widely rejected and a second ad that
features a talking head: Health Commissioner Stephen Joseph. Two
television stations, including the local CBS affiliate, have aired
the Joseph spot.
   Nancy Davies, vice president at Capriello &amp; Chabrowe, the agency
that designed the campaign, said her people went back and forth
with local TV stations on the more controversial ad, changing it
each time, but the stations still said no.
   ``They wouldn't have anything to do with them,'' she said.
   The city's newspapers have refused to run the campaign's print
ads, but they have shown up in subway cars and on station
billboards. One uses the headline ``Man-to-Man,'' with the letter
``o'' represented by a rolled-up condom.
   Part of the goal, Davies said, was to reach men who engage in
sex with other men but do not consider themselves part of the gay
community and thus do not frequent bars or organizations where they
would see other AIDS education messages.
   ``The bulk of the campaign, when it comes right down to it, is
in the subway,'' said Davies.
   Whelan of the American Council on Science and Health said she
objected to advocating condom use not for moral or ``prudish''
reasons, but because condoms are not 100 percent failsafe even when
used correctly.
   In addition, she said, the ads appear to condone, at least
unintentionally, homosexuality or sex outside a monogamous
relationship, behavior that many people oppose.
   ``If they're meant for homosexual men, I think they should be
targeted at them and not at everybody else,'' she said. ``I think
you end up turning people off and making them less sympathetic.''
   As head of the National AIDS Information and Education Program
at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Dr. Fred Kroger is
responsible for creating AIDS education materials for the public.
   The first campaign in 1987 offered promotions on the use of
condoms for sexually active people.
   ``In general those were not played by anybody,'' he said.
   Kroger said he had since refocused the message of the TV ads,
avoiding the word ``condom'' but including a telephone number
people can call for information.
   ``Rather than putting lots of money into messages that would not
be seen by anybody, we opted to do less explicit messages,'' he
said.
   Public health officials and the ad agencies say they realize
their work is controversial and they take pains not to be
``unnecessarily provocative.''
   But Tuckson, the District of Columbia health commissioner, says
he feels they have a responsibility to get information on reducing
the risk of AIDS to the people who need it.
   ``This is a society that advertises feminine hygiene deodorant
spray and depicts explicit sexual behavior in prime time,'' he
said. ``What is offensive and insulting is not to give people
information that can help save their lives.''

<TEXT>
   Glad tidings and signs of peace on
Earth are scant among the bullet- and rocket-pocked facades of the
humble homes of Conacaste.
   The family of Elpidio Verdugo set up a 3-foot artificial
Christmas tree and draped it with a string of tiny lights that
hardly ever twinkle because the electricity is on only a couple
hours a day.
   There are no presents beneath the tree and Verdugo's wife,
Gloria, doubts there will be.
   ``The country is in mourning,'' Verdugo said.
   The 45-year-old bank teller, his wife and their four teenage
children spent the better part of three days last month huddled
beneath mattresses draped over tables in the kitchen-living room of
their cinderblock house.
   Outside, the crack of fire from assault rifles and machine-guns
filled Alley 6. An acrid gauze of gunsmoke reduced visibility to 15
feet, streamed through the shattered windows and seeped through
cracks where the mattresses overlapped, stinging eyes and giving
the terrified family even more reason to cry.
   The Verdugos' neighborhood of Conacaste in Soyapango, just east
of San Salvador, was the most devastated of several working-class
districts ravaged by fierce combat last month in and around the
nation's capital.
   A guerrilla offensive launched Nov. 11 killed up to 2,000 people
and was the biggest push of a 10-year-old civil war between leftist
rebels and a succession of U.S.-backed governments.
   The Verdugos finally were able to evacuate by climbing over the
rear wall on Nov. 15. They returned after a week of refuge at the
nearby psychiatric hospital to find their home a shambles.
   The roof of the bedroom of 16-year-old son, Stanley, was blown
to bits by either a rocket-propelled grenade or a rocket fired by a
helicopter. A crater surrounded by a whorl of black marks the point
of impact on the white wall.
   The corrugated synthetic tile roofing sheet has been replaced
with cardboard, the same material covering Stanley's bedsprings.
   ``The mattresses were burned up or torn to shreds,'' said Mrs.
Verdugo.
   The yellow refrigerator has a bullet hole in the side, patched
with cloth and tape so the refrigerant doesn't leak. Two kitchen
chairs sprout foam rubber stuffing where bullets ripped through
them.
   Verdugo estimated the damage at about $600, six months of his
salary. The family has no savings.
   Officials of a government housing fund visited to evaluate
damage. They promised money to help reconstruct.
   ``But they also promised help to repair damages from the (1986)
earthquake, and that never came,'' said the father.
   ``We'll do what we can to celebrate the arrival of the Christ
child,'' said Mrs. Verdugo. She plans to prepare turkey or chicken,
pastries and homemade candies for visits of friends and relatives
on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.
   ``Even amid so much poverty, there's always the joy of
Christmas. We've always got faith, and the hope that this won't
happen again,'' she said.
   Xiomara, the 13-year-old daughter, said she had been hoping to
receive a new dress or some other gift at Christmas. ``But I
understand why there won't be presents this year. And it doesn't
matter, really.''
   Mrs. Verdugo said she does not entertain illusions that the
Christmas spirit of good will toward men might somehow foster peace.
   ``In a moment of anguish, like in the middle of the battle,
people accept Christ in their heart. But then when things calm
down, they forget. For there to be peace, Christ has to be in
people's hearts all the time,'' she said.

   When five people were indicted on charges
of sexually abusing children at a day-care center, the news
reverberated through this town of 5,800, seemingly touching
everyone.
   In the months since the first allegations were made against
Little Rascals' Day Care Center last January, wave after wave of
indictments have been handed up. Court documents listing 202
charges say day-care workers had intercourse in front of children
and performed oral and anal sex with them from September 1988 to
January 1989.
   The initial reports were based on evidence from 21 children who
were allegedly molested, but prosecutors say all of the
approximately 70 children who attended the center are potential
witnesses. The center lost its license in June and was closed.
   Nearly everyone here knows someone who has been indicted or the
family of a child involved in the case.
   ``I've watched some of the parents of victims grow up,'' said
Alton Elmore, owner of Edenton Furniture and a Chowan County
commissioner. ``And I've watched some of them who've been charged
grow up.''
   That sense of community makes it doubly difficult for residents
to deal with the sudden onslaught of news media and curiosity
seekers.
   A clerk at a children's clothing store shied away from
discussing the case with a stranger. ``The manager of the store's
little girl is involved in it, so I don't think I should say
anything,'' she said.
   Other people offered similar responses.
   ``It's just a bad situation. Some are very upset,'' said John
Smith, owner of Edenton Floral Co., a block away from the choppy
waters of the Albemarle Sound.
   But while people are reluctant to talk about the case to
outsiders, they are freer among themselves. Rumors grew so abundant
at one point that District Attorney H.P. Williams issued a
statement warning residents that they could jeopardize the state's
case.
   Townspeople are beginning to tire of the lengthy pre-trial
hearings, sometimes grumbling that Williams has been dragging his
feet since the first hearing April 14, when the first arrest
occurred.
   Williams, up for re-election next November, has sometimes found
himself in an unkind public spotlight and appeared reluctant to
discuss even tangential issues.
   Public outrage and a concern for the children may have prompted
bonds ranging from $375,000 to $1.5 million _ so high that only one
defendant has been released.
   All but one of the defendants is charged with the same four
crimes: engaging in sex with a child under 13, taking indecent
liberties with a minor, crimes against nature, and conspiracy to
commit indecent liberties with a child.
   The fifth, former Little Rascals' employee Shelley Stone, is
charged with all but crimes against nature.
   All five defendants have pleaded innocent.
   Robert Kelly Jr., 41, who operated Little Rascals with his wife,
Elizabeth Kelly, 34, is in jail on $1.5 million bond. He is charged
with 152 counts involving at least 21 boys and girls under age 13.
   Mrs. Kelly is charged with 19 counts involving eight children
and faces a $1 million bond. A friend of the Kellys', Willard Scott
Privott, 40, has been charged with 13 counts involving six
children, plus kidnapping and terrorizing one girl. He is being
held on $1 million bond.
   Kathryn Dawn Wilson, 23, another employee, is charged with 19
counts involving eight children.
   Ms. Stone, who is accused of nine counts, is the only one of the
five to post bond _ $375,000 in her case. However her lawyer said
he was worried that she might be named in new indictments and
arrested without warning.
   Joe Cheshire, the Raleigh attorney representing Kelly, called it
``an incredible case.'' He contended that much of the children's
testimony would show that nothing wrong had taken place, and would
exonerate his client.
   ``It's very strange to me,'' Cheshire said. ``You have a couple
of kids make some statements and months later you have some more
and now we hear there are some more. I'd just like to find out how
that process happened.''
   But Assistant Attorney General Bill Hart said there is no
mystery about the process.
   ``We have had continuing disclosure just like the defense has
been getting,'' he said. ``Children don't just come running out of
their houses screaming, `I've been molested.'''
   Elmore said each new revelation rocks the community in a way
he's never experienced. ``A lot of good people and the families of
good people have gotten hurt,'' he said.

<HEAD>Aquino's Love Affair With The Press Sours Amid Coup Crisis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino's
relationship with the press is a love affair gone sour.
   Once she praised the media for helping her take power. Now, she
threatens legal action against those news outlets deemed to be
aiding the forces bent on toppling her.
   Seeking to repair the damage wrought by the recent failed coup,
Mrs. Aquino on Monday told reporters that the government would
revoke the franchise of broadcasters who violate regulations
against airing ``subversive propaganda.''
   ``With regard to print media, it's an entirely different
matter,'' Mrs. Aquino said. ``We will base this on any article that
will incite to rebellion. If such an article does appear in any of
the newspapers, then we will go to court to file charges against
the erring individual or the publication.''
   She gave no indication what standards would be used in
determining whether reports ``incite rebellion.''
   A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition he not be named,
defended government plans in the wake of the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt,
the most serious of six in her nearly 4 years in power. He said
there had been examples in American history when presidents imposed
controls during grave national emergencies.
   But media controls of any sort are a sensitive issue in a
country emerging from years of strongman rule under the late
President Ferdinand Marco, a country uncertain of the strength of
its democratic institutions.
   ``The government assault on press freedom has begun,'' said the
newspaper Malaya. ``What is frightening is the mere thought that
the Aquino government, swept into power on the promise of rigid
observance of the citizens' rights and liberties, would entertain
the idea of muzzling the press.''
   Since Marcos was ousted, more than 20 English, Tagalog and
Chinese-language newspapers have appeared in the capital, and the
Manila press has become one of the most free-wheeling in Asia.
   The government's move clearly aims to limit access to media,
particularly radio, for rebels still at large. Ironically, some of
Mrs. Aquino's stalwarts complained of stringent measures undertaken
to limit access to opposition groups under Marcos.
   During the February 1986 uprising that toppled Marcos, Mrs.
Aquino's allies carefully cultivated foreign reporters and local
journalists bold enough to challenge the government's version of
events. On the first anniversary of the Marcos ouster, the
government awarded certificates of thanks to foreign journalists
who covered the 1986 uprising.
   So far, the National Telecommunications Commission has closed
just two radio stations _ a pro-Marcos outlet in Manila and another
broadcaster in Cebu. The Cebu station was later allowed to reopen.
   After an August 1987 coup attempt, some independent stations
aired taped interviews with renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo''
Honasan, also believed to have been a leader of the recent putsch.
   No statements from rebels have been broadcast since they gave up
their last position Dec. 9.
   Newspaper executives say they have received no directives
telling them what to print. But several, speaking on condition of
anonymity, say they fear such a move in the future if the political
situation worsens.
   On Monday, the Philippine Daily Globe reported that military
Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa asked that another newspaper,
the Philippine Daily Inquirer, be closed for ``inaccurate
reporting'' during the coup attempt but that de Villa was overruled
by the administration.
   Neither de Villa nor the presidential palace has commented on
the report. In a front-page editorial today, the Inquirer suggested
de Villa ``stick to soldiering and leave newspapering to those who
understand its mission and operation.''
   Even before the coup attempt, Mrs. Aquino's relations with the
Manila press had deteriorated. Columnists regularly lambasted the
administration for inefficiency, alleged corruption and favoritism
of presidential relatives.
   Reporters covering the president often complain that access is
limited to weekly ``mini-press conferences'' in which Mrs. Aquino
answers a limited number of questions, often with vague, standard
responses.

<HEAD>Famed Violinist Conducts Benefit for Decaying East German Cities</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In a benefit concert to help rebuild decaying
East German city centers, Sir Yehudi Menuhin conducted the renowned
East German State Orchestra as it performed for the first time in
West Berlin.
   The opening of East Germany's borders Nov. 9 allowed East
Germany's famous orchestra to travel easily to the great hall of
the Sender Freies Berlin radio station for Monday's hastily
arranged concert.
   For more than four decades, the 73-year-old violinist has taken
his music around the world to play benefits, first for the Allied
Forces in World War II, for fellow Jews who had survived the
Holocaust and much later for German-Jewish reconciliation.
   In an interview during the intermission of the concert, which
was broadcast live and could be heard in East Berlin, Menuhin said
the time was past to think badly of Communists and that all should
now focus on East-West cooperation.
   The classical program included works by Ludwig van Beethoven and
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
   Speaking German in the interview, Menuhin said he had last
played in Berlin in 1929 as a teen-ager at the Berlin Philharmonic
with the legendary conductor Bruno Walter.
   He said that the opening of the wall was a ``phenomenon which is
very moving and unbelievable.''
   ``Music has managed to get over the wall,'' he said. ``That is
not possible everywhere, but you feel when you go to countries
where people suffer or can't say what they want that music has a
value that is hard to imagine in other countries.''
   The centers of many historic German cities like Leipzig, Weimar
and Jena have been ravaged by pollution, poor city planning and
shoddy post-war construction.
   Menuhin joins other famous musicians such as Mstislav
Rostropovich and Daniel Barenboim in staging benefits for East
Germany since the wall was opened.

   A woman who turned up here with amnesia
says she'll spend the holidays in Nashville because she ``felt like
a duck out of water'' during a recent trip to her Ohio hometown.
   Ruth Ellish will send presents to her family in Akron but stay
in Nashville, where she's spent the past year in the care of a
shelter for homeless women.
   ``I feel comfortable here,'' she said. ``I feel like this is
where I belong. It's my home now; it's the only place I really
know.''
   The 50-year-old woman prefers to be called Kitty Jordan, a name
she adopted during her mysterious memory loss. She said she's
grateful her perplexing past was cleared up after 10 months.
   ``A lot of my prayers have been answered,'' Jordan said.
   She woke up in a Nashville motel Dec. 10, 1988, bruised and
unable to remember her name or where she lived.
   After national publicity, she was reunited Oct. 4 with her
mother, Irene Christ, and sister, Elise White, both of Ohio.
   White said the family believes her sister fled under stress when
she was threatened by a boyfriend of her 18-year-old daughter.
   Since the reunion, Jordan has visited her former home, but said
she still doesn't remember her earlier life.
   ``It was strange,'' she said of a November trip to Akron. ``I
felt like a duck out of water. ...
   ``They know me, and the warmth they show me, well, I feel like
they are family. But I don't really know them,'' she said. ``The
best part about all of it was seeing the Nashville skyline when I
was flying back.''
   Jordan also has two sons, ages 20 and 29. Relatives said she was
a computer analyst at the Alltel-Western Reserve Telephone Co. in
Hudson, north of Akron.
   She works as a junior staff cook for room and board and $50 a
week at a shelter for homeless women and children operated by the
Nashville Union Rescue Mission.
   ``I am happy here,'' she said. ``I'm just hoping that in 1990 I
will be able to get a full-time job with the mission, because I
love my work here.
   ``Otherwise, if I have to, I'll try and get another job, perhaps
as an administrative assistant or an executive secretary. I need to
be making more money to start my own life.
   ``But I've got a lot to be thankful for.''

   If Vincent van Gogh had the
marketing pizazz of the entrepreneurs cashing in on his centennial,
he probably wouldn't have died a penniless suicide.
   As the Van Gogh 1990 Foundation prepares a multi-media
extravaganza here marking the 100th anniversary of the artist's
death, merchandisers are capitalizing on the event with everything
from wine to ties bearing his name or image.
   The commercialization has not pleased either the foundation or
Van Gogh's family.
   ``It is not to our taste,'' grandnephew Johan van Gogh told The
Associated Press.
   The government-backed foundation is preparing the biggest-ever
van Gogh show, with almost 200 works loaned from more than 50
countries for an exhibition opening on his birthday, March 30.
   The official commemoration has the support of the van Gogh
family.
   ``We are going to give Vincent van Gogh a high quality
commemoration,'' said foundation spokeswoman Madeleine A.
Wardenaar. ``We want him to be respected as a Dutch artist.''
   ``We're not doing this as a business,'' added foundation
financial advisor J. Rooyackers.
   But many others are.
   Chief among them is Amsterdam dentist Jacob G. Dekker, whose Van
Gogh International has registered the name Vincent van Gogh as a
trademark ``in just about every country you can think of except
Timbuktu'' for a variety of products.
   His flagship line of ``Vincent van Gogh'' perfumes and colognes
has a floral fragrance to remind buyers of works like the
``Sunflowers'' series and ``Irises,'' which holds the art auction
record of $53 million.
   Other commemmorative products Dekker has licensed include pen
sets, watches, compact discs of music composed by van Gogh
contemporaries Debussy, Ravel and Chausson, and T-shirts, scarves
and ties decorated with van Gogh scenes.
   Dekker projects total centennial year sales of about $75 million
worldwide. He says he registered the trademark five years ago,
without a thought to the centennial.
   ``The idea was to find a (product) name that everyone knows
worldwide, so you don't have to spend millions establishing a
name,'' Dekker told the AP.
   For those who take van Gogh slightly more seriously than to dab
him behind their ears or tie him around their necks, the U.S.-based
Franklin Mint is issuing a ``limited edition'' bronze commemorative
medallion for $150.
   American Express Netherlands is offering an 8-inch bronze bust
of van Gogh for $488. Its manufacturer, Barcelona-based Vincent
Fine Art, is also hawking van Gogh reproductions and commemorative
bottles of Spanish champagn.
   The commercial hoopla has created frictions between the
entrepreneurs and organizations like the centennial foundation,
which see themselves as trying in vain to shield an artistic giant
from crass commercialism.
   ``When I offered my products to the gift shop of the Van Gogh
Museum, they treated me like a stray dog,'' said Dekker.
   The foundation has, for example, refused endorsements such as
one for a line of curtains embossed with van Gogh sunflowers.
   ``We try to discourage people. We don't like the publicity it
gets, but we cannot control it,'' said Ms. Wardenaar, since both
the artist's name and his works are in the public domain.
   ``They can do what they like. We have not much to say about
it,'' said Johan van Gogh, grandson of the artist's brother Theo.
   Johan chairs the family-run Vincent van Gogh Foundation, which
owns more than one hundred works on permanent loan to the Van Gogh
museum here, the world's largest single collection.
   At issue is one of this nation's greatest cultural icons, a
minister's son whose early works reflected the grinding poverty of
19th century rural Dutch life. Foremost among them is ``The Potato
Eaters,'' depicting a farming family with grotesquely pinched
features gathered around their meager supper.
   It was only during his later French period that Van Gogh bloomed
with the vibrant colors that have gilded the auction gavel.
   The irony is that the world's best-selling artist sold only one
single painting himself.
   After his descent into mental illness, Van Gogh fatally shot
himself in July 1890 at the age of 37.
   The centennial foundation is pushing ahead with events it claims
will nurture interest in the artist without exploiting him.
   A van Gogh opera will premiere in Amsterdam, a commemorative
medal will be issued, a film festival screened, and a poetry book
published with the poems of 20 Dutch and Belgian poets commissioned
in his honor.
   Commemorative posters by 20 contemporary artists, including
Czechoslovak Jiri Kolar, Dutchman Willem de Kooning and American
Roy Lichtenstein have been run off to help offset the $11.5 million
exhibition cost.

<HEAD>Witness to Priest Killings Says FBI Mistreated Her</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who says she witnessed Salvadoran
soldiers moving towards the residence where six Jesuit priests were
murdered was so intimidated by FBI agents and a Salvadoran colonel
that she recanted her story, a human rights official said Sunday.
   From Nov. 27 to Nov. 30, Lucia Barrera de Cerna, a cleaning
woman at the Jesuit University in San Salvador, and her husband,
Jorge Cerna, were repeatedly asked by the agents and the colonel
what they saw the night of the killings, said Martha Doggett of the
Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.
   When they told of having seen Salvadoran soldiers moving to and
from the priests' residences, they were accused of lying and asked,
``Who put you up to this?'' Ms. Doggett said.
   Ms. Barrera was also told, ``Depending on what you say, you may
or may not have to go back to El Salvador,'' said Ms. Doggett, who
coordinates Latin American and Caribbean affairs for the Lawyers
Committee and was one of two representatives from the organization
to interview Ms. Barrera recently.
   The Salvadoran, Lt. Col. Manuel Antonio Rivas, also yelled at
Ms. Barrera: ``I'm ashamed of you! You're a Salvadoran! You're a
liar!'' said Ms. Doggett.
   Rivas is head of the U.S.-trained Special Investigative Unit,
which was designed to handle human rights cases.
   After three days of interrogation, Ms. Barrera ``couldn't take
it anymore. She wanted to be left in peace,'' said Ms. Doggett.
   On Nov. 30, when she was asked by Rivas to ``tell us again what
you saw from the window,'' Ms. Barrera replied: ``I didn't see
anything from the window,'' Ms. Doggett said.
   That night, she told her husband what she had done and the next
day he too recanted.
   Both of them failed lie detector tests when they repeated their
story that they had not seen the soldiers.
   The State Department then turned them over to the custody of the
Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, which contacted
the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.
   ``It's a mystery to me why they would treat her this way,'' said
Ms. Doggett. ``She was treated as one would streat a suspect in a
crime and not a witness. She was already terrified. She'd lost some
of the people she was most close to (the priests) and then she was
uprooted from her home.''
   She added, ``These hostile people, they sort of ensured that she
wouldn't cooperate.''
   Duty officers at the FBI and the State Department in Washington
said there was no one available to comment on the matter Sunday
night. However, The New York Times reported in its Monday editions
that officials with the FBI and State Department had said there was
no evidence to support the Cernas' allegations.
   Ms. Barrera told Ms. Doggett she was awakened some time after
midnight Nov. 16 by the sound of gunfire and from a window saw five
men _ two wearing camouflage uniforms with visored caps and guns _
walking toward a passageway leading to the priests' residence.
   According to Ms. Doggett, she heard a priest whom she was very
close to _ Father Martin-Baro _ say, ``This is an injustice!'' A
short time later, she and her husband heard gunfire constantly.
   The next morning, with security guards who worked for the
Jesuits, Ms. Barrera and her husband found the bodies of two
housekeepers who had worked for the priests. She also saw the body
of Martin-Baro, and her husband saw the bodies of four of the six
priests who had been murdered.
   A human rights official of the Archdiocese learned what they had
witnessed and told them to take sanctuary in a foreign embassy.
They first went to the Spanish Embassy, where a Salvadoran judge
took a statement from them, then to the French Embassy, and then
they were brought by a U.S. Embassy official and an FBI agent to a
Miami hotel on Nov. 23.
   Ms. Barrera and her family lived in a suburb of San Salvador,
but had spent the night the priests were killed in a cottage near
the priests' residence because of heavy fighting in their own
neighborhood.
   She told Ms. Doggett she was sure the soldiers who came to the
priests' residence were government soldiers because the entire area
was held by the government forces.

<TEXT>
   Rescuers on Sunday evacuated a family
that had been trapped at a lodge in the shadow of Redoubt Volcano
as it continued to belch ash and steam over much of south-central
Alaska.
   The volcano, which had been fuming and sputtering in a
continuous low-level eruption since Saturday afternoon, erupted
with greater force Sunday afternoon, the U.S Geological Survey
said. An ash plume was spotted by an airline pilot at 27,000 feet,
drifting northeast toward Anchorage.
   Shortly before the eruption, pilots of Alaska Helicopters Inc.
evacuated Nancy Jones, her husband and 2-year-old son from Tuwalaka
Lodge, 10 miles south of the volcano. For two days ash clouds and
poor weather had stymied efforts to reach the Joneses, who are
caretakers at the lodge.
   Mrs. Jones said Sunday she and her family could see little of
the volcano until Saturday, when fog and snow near the peak cleared.
   ``We could see the big billow going up into the air,'' she said.
``We watched it all day. The wind was blowing it away from us. We
didn't get too much ash.
   ``It was a little bit worrisome,'' she said. ``We were worried
the top might blow off our way and give us a bad time that way.''
   She said she was unsure whether her family would return to the
lodge if the volcano quieted.
   ``We really like it out there; it's beautiful,'' she said.
``It's a perfect place to spend the winter, barring the volcano.''
   The family was taken to Drift River, a petroleum facility 20
miles southwest of the lodge, said Byron Wallace of Alaska
Helicopters. ``They're at Drift River now, but when they'll get
back to town we're not sure,'' he said.
   Another caretaker couple, Mike and Sandy Coulter, remained at
Big River Lake Lodge nearly 30 miles north of the volcano, though
they had reported hunks of pumice as large as softballs falling on
their roof Saturday.
   They reported no serious problems and intended to stay, said the
lodge's owner, Dennis Branham.
   The 10,197-foot volcano, located about 115 miles southwest of
Anchorage and quiet since the '60s, started erupting Thursday. Ash
drifted as far south as Oregon. It had been expected to reach
California or Arizona by Sunday, but officials said there were no
reports of ash reaching those states.
   The continent's most notorious volcano, Mount St. Helens in
Washington state, also showed signs of life on Thursday after more
than three years of silence. The volcano issued a small burst of
steam, gas and ash, but scientists said an eruption did not appear
to be imminent.
   Alaska Volcano Observatory geologist Steve Brantley said two
other pilots reported a strong sulfur smell between 15,000 and
19,000 feet, about 25 miles west of Anchorage.
   ``Given the wind direction, it is certainly possible we'll get
some ash fallout here in Anchorage,'' Brantley said. ``But that
depends on the volume of ash that erupted, whether there is enough
of it to be carried by the winds this far.
   ``The earthquake activity at the mountain continues at
significant levels and does not show a trend toward increasing or
decreasing strength, or vigor.''
   Before Sunday afternoon's eruption, the USGS described the
amount of ash sent up this weekend as ``low to moderate,''
significantly less than Friday, when Redoubt had its largest
eruption since emerging from a 23-year dormancy.
   Haze from the volcano on Saturday drifted across Anchorage,
Alaska's largest city with more than 200,000 people, triggering
power outages, health alerts and disrupting air traffic. At midday
Sunday, snow was falling with no ash apparent in the city.
   Prior to Saturday, fallout had been swept past Anchorage but
blanketed smaller communities such as Talkeetna and Delta Junction
to the north. The Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage also had
escaped the ash until Saturday, when the peninsula towns of
Soldotna and Nikiski got hit.
   The ask was disrupting life in a state heavily dependent on air
travel. Daily deliveries of newspapers flown from Anchorage and
Fairbanks were halted Saturday, and some teachers from schools in
outlying villages found themselves stranded in Barrow, unable to
get flights out for the start of Christmas vacations.
   The Anchorage International Airport was open Sunday, but service
remained spotty, with some airlines grounding their aircraft and
others offering limited service. Some businesses covered sensitive
equipment for fear ash would filter into buildings.
   The ash in the sky over Anchorage during the weekend came at a
time when daylight is in short supply: The city is so far north
that it gets only about 5{ hours of light at this time of year.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Post-Vietnam `Peace Dividend' Was Quickly Spent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Optimists who hope defense cuts will produce
piles of money that can be spent on education, deficit-cutting and
other initiatives, take heed: That's not what happened after
Vietnam.
   As the United States withdrew its forces from Southeast Asia,
the share of the federal budget devoted to military spending
gradually shrank from nearly half to about one-fourth. But the
money was largely swallowed by rapidly growing federal benefit
programs like Social Security and Medicare, by inflation and by tax
cuts.
   ``There was a peace dividend, but it was gobbled up
automatically by the formulas of entitlement programs'' that
provide welfare and other benefits to millions of Americans, said
Roy Ash, federal budget director from 1973 to 1975 under Presidents
Nixon and Ford.
   ``It didn't produce any discretionary money'' the government
could distribute among domestic programs of its choosing, Ash, now
a Los Angeles investor, said in an interview last week.
   The Bush administration is expected to seek a $292 billion
defense budget for fiscal 1991, which begins next October 1, when
it introduces its spending plan on Jan. 22. Because of deficit
pressures and diminished East-West tension, military spending
increases for future years are expected to be reduced.
   In 1968, when President Johnson announced that the United States
would begin to pull out of Vietnam, the U.S. military budget hit
its wartime peak: $323.7 billion, in 1990 dollars. By 1975, when
Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese and the last American personnel
left the country, that spending had dropped to $209.3 billion.
   During that same period something else was happening. A slew of
income support programs, including Social Security and Medicare,
began dramatic growth spurts as Congress voted benefit increases
and expanded eligibility. And inflation spiraled upward,
accelerated by the Arab oil embargo of 1973.
   Social Security spending swelled from $89.4 billion in 1968 to
$156.6 billion in 1975, in 1990 money.
   Medicare, which provides health coverage to the elderly and
disabled, jumped from $17.2 billion in 1968 to $31.2 billion in
1975, in 1990 dollars, as benefits were liberalized and medical
costs soared. Welfare programs ballooned from $44.1 billion in 1968
to $121.5 billion in 1975, in 1990 money.
   ``There were no particular plans for the adjustment'' to lower
defense spending, director Gordon Adams of the Defense Budget
Project, a non-profit research group, said in an interview. ``We
just kind of ran into the train wreck of the oil price increases
and inflation.''
   The U.S. pullout from Vietnam coincided with a jump in consumer
prices from 6 percent a year at the start of the 1970s to double
digits by the middle of the decade. That, coupled with rising
unemployment and a slowing economy, prompted Congress to enact tax
cuts in 1969, 1971 and 1975, stimulating the private sector but
further preventing domestic federal agencies from reaping benefits
from the defense reductions.
   The defense savings did not go to reduce federal deficits, which
were minuscule by today's standards and of minor political
significance.
   The government actually ran a $3.2 billion surplus in 1969 _ the
last time federal books were in the black _ thanks to a temporary
10 percent income tax surcharge imposed to pay for the war. It was
not until 1975, when the shortfall hit $53.2 billion, that the
deficit began to attract much attention.
   ``I was trying so hard to make it a political issue, but I
couldn't stir any interest,'' Ash said.
   Today's economic and political climate is so different from the
Vietnam years that it is difficult to draw many budget lessons from
that experience.
   In today's era of $150 billion deficits, few people expect
lawmakers to tack huge new benefit increases onto existing income
support programs. Indeed, the deficit is so important a
consideration that President Bush and many lawmakers _ including
some Democrats _ are already insisting that any defense savings be
used to help balance the budget.
   Yet benefit programs remain ever-growing and costly drains on
government coffers, with Social Security due to hit $249 billion
this year and Medicare expected to cost another $99 billion. The
Medicare bill is expected to grow by about 14 percent next year
because of ballooning medical costs, while Social Security expenses
should rise 8 percent because of growing numbers of people covered
by the program.
   That means tough competition for advocates of improved
education, health care, environmental initiatives, child care,
anti-drug efforts, transportation, public works projects, and other
initiatives.

<HEAD>Administration Planning Renewed Emphasis on Energy Conservation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six months into its review of federal energy
policy, the Bush administration has come to at least one clear
conclusion: the Reagan-era theme of ``just keep the oil flowing and
keep it cheap'' is too simplistic for the 1990s.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins says oil inevitably will be
the dominant fuel well into the 21st century. He has become
convinced, though, that the federal government must do more now to
begin curing the nation of its costly oil addiction.
   It's not yet clear how the new federal role will be written, but
almost certainly it will emphasize the virtues of conservation and
renewable energy resources.
   That alone would be a major change from the eight years of the
Reagan administration, which tried to abolish the Energy Department
and, failing that, consistently cut its budget for energy
conservation. The department's 1989 conservation budget was less
than one-third its 1980 level, adjusted for inflation.
   There are at least three main reasons for the turnabout under
Watkins: the Exxon Valdez oil spill, which turned much of public
opinion against the oil industry, longer-range concerns about
environmental damage from burning fossil fuels, and fear that the
United States is becoming overly reliant on Middle Eastern oil.
   The Reagan administration ``went too far ... in getting rid of
many good programs'' in energy conservation and renewable energy
research, Watkins told a hearing Wednesday in Washington on the
link between energy and national security.
   The hearing was one in a series that Watkins and his chief
deputies have held in cities across the nation this fall. Watkins
says he is looking for ideas on how to devise a ``national energy
strategy'' to last for the next four decades.
   Shortly after he took office last March, Watkins said he found
the department's bookshelves contained plenty of good descriptions
of the nation's energy goals but no policy document that spelled
out how it could reach those goals.
   Watkins also discovered that the department's credibility was
low and still slipping. So rather than piece together an energy
plan on his own, Watkins decided take his policy-writing show on
the road to solicit advice from the public.
   What he has heard so far, after public sessions in 11 cities
from coast to coast, is that conservation, with a bigger push from
the federal government, can help achieve many key energy goals:
holding down oil imports, keeping prices steady, limiting the need
for new power plants and curbing air pollution.
   At the Washington hearing Watkins made it clear he has gotten
the message.
   If the final energy plan that the administration submits to the
Congress a year from now does not put a major emphasis on
conservation and renewable energy resources such as solar power,
``then this thing is dead on arrival,'' he said.
   Even some supporters of Reagan's conservation-cutting moves are
now singing a different tune.
   ``I have been converted to a greater appreciation of
conservation and renewable energy,'' Henson Moore, the deputy
energy secretary, said recently. As a Louisiana congressman during
most of the Reagan administration, Moore voted for repeated cuts in
conservation funds and research on energy efficiency.
   ``I know more about it now,'' said Moore, who is fond of saying
his roots are in the oil patch.
   The big oil companies know a lot about conservation, and they
think it's overrated. The American Petroleum Institute, the main
oil trade association, recently published a leaflet that said a
greater federal role in promoting conservation would only give the
public ``false hopes'' and sharply higher energy prices.
   Public opinion polls, however, indicate that Americans want more
emphasis on conservation and development of renewable energy
sources, and less on oil production.
   A poll conducted in November for the Union of Concerned
Scientists asked people across the nation how best to meet future
energy needs and reduce air pollution. Eight out of 10 said use
more renewable sources and increase energy efficiency. About one in
10 said produce more oil, natural gas and coal. The rest didn't
answer.

   It took Jay Brewer an entire day to put up his
Christmas tree, but you won't find any presents near its base.
   The tree is suspended upside down from a ceiling.
   ``Every day I come home and hope and pray it's still up there,''
he said.
   Brewer decorated the 7-foot-tall artificial tree with bulbs,
1,400 white lights and garland. It is attached to a small motor
that rotates it constantly.
   ``I like to get off the beaten path,'' said the 27-year-old
hairdresser.
   Brewer's Christmas presents are on the ground, stacked by the
tip of the tree.
   It has become a popular holiday attraction in his neighborhood,
with only one drawback.
   ``Most people get dizzy watching it,'' Brewer said.

   Christmas tree buyers here are learning
a lesson from the Boy Scouts. It's called the honor system.
   ``When lot is unattended drop money in mail slot,'' reads a
hand-lettered sign on the lot where Troop 399 sells about 3,000
trees each year for $6 to $28.
   After 9 p.m., troop members leave the lot unattended.
   ``We pretty much trust everybody in Evansville,'' said Andy
Tenbarge, a 13-year-old Scout working Saturday.
   Troop members don't even count how many trees are gone each
morning.
   ``If someone needs to steal a Christmas tree, they need it worse
than we do,'' said John Rae, a Scout leader who helped sell trees
when the troop started doing so more than 30 years ago.
   That year the troop earned $300. Rae said the sale now generates
enough money to pay for the troop's entire camping program. Last
year, 50 boys were able to spend 10 days in New York, a week skiing
in West Virginia, and about 15 other weekends canoeing, spelunking
and camping.
   On Wednesday, in a show of Christmas spirit, remaining trees
will be offered to those who can't afford to buy one, Rae said.

   Most square dancers wear brightly colored shirts
and swirling skirts, but one group of performers puts on only
bandanas. They're dogs.
   Called the Promenade Pups, the dog square dance troupe has been
performing in the Dallas area for about a year. During most
performances, eight people dance with eight dogs at their sides.
Sometimes it's dos-a-dos with four people and four dogs.
   Dogs and people wear matching red bandanas.
   The dogs have mastered much more than the dos-a-dos. They also
do a modified version of the Cotton-Eyed Joe, a popular country
music dance. During some of the more difficult steps, the pooches
stand still while their owners dance around them.
   Sally Browning, a professional dog training instructor who
organized the troupe, said the dogs are great performers _ most of
the time.
   ``Every now and then a dog won't do it quite right,'' she said.
``We know it. But you don't.''

   If anyone stole the president's wallet, it might
be a while before he noticed it was missing.
   ``You carry cash, but you don't use it much,'' President Bush

   At age 88, Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist
A.B. Guthrie Jr. says he still hasn't written his favorite book,
and maybe never will.
   ``I always have things in my mind,'' he said Saturday at a
book-signing session in Helena. ``Time's short, though.''
   Guthrie, who lives west of Choteau, said he considers himself a
mere ``passerby in the world'' who was lucky enough to pursue his
literary dream.
   ``I'm glad I chose the career I did,'' the former newspaperman
said. ``I've striven for a mastery of (the English language) and
yet I know it will never be mastered.''
   Guthrie won the Pulitzer in 1950 for ``The Way West,'' a novel
about the settling of the frontier, and is perhaps best known for
``The Big Sky,'' which launched his career in 1947. He has written
numerous historical novels and collections of essays and stories,
and wrote the screenplay for the 1953 movie ``Shane.''
   Guthrie was signing autographs on copies of ``Montana! A
Photographic Session,'' for which he wrote passages to accompany
104 photographs.

   Comic Jackie Mason and Mayor-elect David Dinkins
say their differences over a campaign wisecrack are a thing of the
past, but Mason still got in a dig.
   Mason stirred up a hornets nest in September when he called
Dinkins ``a fancy shvartze with a mustache.'' Shvartze is Yiddish
for black.
   When he made the remark, Mason was working for the campaign of
Dinkins' opponent, Republican Rudolph Giuliani.
   At a holiday party Saturday, the comedian, with Dinkins at his
side, said he was glad Dinkins won the mayoral race.
   ``I'm on his side as much as I would've been if I'd been on his
side from the beginning,'' he said.
   ``There has never been bad blood,'' Dinkins said.
   Earlier, Mason joked with journalists about a report that
Dinkins had asked to be called ``Mr. Dinkins,'' rather than
``Dave,'' at news conferences.
   ``They called Truman `Harry.' They called Reagan `Ronnie.' Maybe
if he doesn't like his name, they could call Dinkins `Jackie' and
call me `Dave,''' Mason said.

   Cincinnati Bengals football coach Sam Wyche
said he was making a point when his team ran the score up to 61-7
over the Houston Oilers.
   ``We don't like this team,'' Wyche said after Sunday's National
Football League game. ``We don't like their people. When you get a
chance to do it (run up the score), you do it. I wish today this
was a five-quarter game.''
   Wyche had his Bengals throw the football, and even executed an
onside kick with a 45-0 lead, as Cincinnati amassed enough points
to gain the most lopsided victory in its history.
   It was Cincinnati's way of repaying the Oilers for years of
perceived snubs by Houston players and Coach Jerry Glanville's
free-wheeling approach to football.
   Wyche noted his opponents' penchant for inflicting personal
fouls: ``Jerry is an unusual coach,'' Wyche said. ``Drop me a note
if you find somebody who likes this guy, will you?''
   Said Glanville: ``They played excellent. They did a great job.
There are no excuses. It's our job to stop them.''

   Getting a seat up front at the Country
Music Association's awards show was Hank Thompson's first clue that
he was about to get one of its highest honors.
   Thompson, who got his first guitar as a 10-year-old boy in Waco,
is the newest inductee into the Country Music Hall of Fame in
Nashville.
   The 64-year-old singer said last week he had a few other clues
besides the seating arrangements at October's show.
   One was that old friend Guy Clark was presenting the award and
another was that CBS had asked Thompson to appear on its morning
show live the next day.
   ``A guy told me you can usually tell who the winners are,
because you can see where they're sitting,'' said Thompson. ``So
when my seat was right up there in front, I thought, `Roy Rogers
(last year's winner) had been up there the year before, and Loretta
Lynn the year before that,' so I said, `I think I've been moved up.
I think this is gonna be it.'''

   In Liza Minnelli's view, she's not
getting older _ she's getting braver.
   ``I feel the need to take risks now,'' said the 43-year-old
entertainer. ``I don't know why. Maybe it's my age ... or maybe
it's something bizarre, like the position of the planets _ who
knows?''
   Her latest album, ``Results,'' is certainly a change for the
Academy Award-winning actress best known for belting out Broadway
tunes.
   ``Results,'' co-produced and mostly composed by Britain's Pet
Shop Boys, is pop dance music.
   Sales haven't exactly taken off in this country, but Miss
Minnelli doesn't think her less-than hip image is to blame.
   ``But I am hip,'' she said, noting she likes rap and rock music.
   ``I'm not this old lady looking for her lost youth,'' she said.
``The key is doing music they can relate to. If the kids like the
music, they won't care if I'm 80 years old.''

<HEAD>Delay Possible in Mideast Peace Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Israeli diplomat is beginning
preparations today for an opening round of Mideast peace talks here
next month, but there is growing doubt the U.S.-sponsored meetings
will get off the ground without delay.
   Diplomatic sources cited moves by the Palestine Liberation
Organization as the reason it is no longer certain the talks, to be
hosted by Secretary of State James A. Baker III, will be held.
   Still, Israeli cabinet secretary Eliakim Rubinstein, who played
a leading role in negotiations that led to the 1979
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, was sent here Sunday from Jerusalem.
   He is meeting at the State Department with Dennis Ross, head of
the State Department's policy planning staff and Baker's closest
adviser on the Middle East, and with Richard Haass and other
National Security Council staffers.
   Ross broke away from Baker's trip to Europe last week to prepare
for the meeting with Rubinstein.
   Egypt, meanwhile, is sending no special representative from
Cairo to make preparations. Ambassador Sayed el Reedy is available,
as needed.
   The three-way talks Baker hopes to have with Foreign Ministers
Moshe Arens of Israel and Esmat Abdel Meguid of Egypt would be the
first step toward Palestinian elections on the Israeli-held West
Bank and in Gaza.
   Both Israel and Egypt have agreed to the meeting, reserving some
issues to be settled once Arad and Meguid saw Baker.
   But since the State Department announced Egypt's qualified
acceptance 12 days ago, problems have arisen between the Arab
country and the PLO. They raise questions whether Egypt would be
speaking for Yasser Arafat's organization.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir assured President Bush and
Baker on a visit here in mid-November that he was committed to his
plan for elections among the 1.4 million Palestinian Arabs in the
territories.
   The idea is to choose negotiators to work out limited self-rule
with Israel, a plan that has the support of the Bush administration
but is challenged by the PLO as a ploy to prevent establishment of
a Palestinian state.
   When Egypt agreed to Baker's proposal for a planning meeting
here in January it registered some reservations, as Israel had done
earlier. They were to be taken up at the meeting.
   Essentially, Egypt reserved the right to promote a role for the
PLO in selecting a Palestinian delegation that would hold
pre-election talks with Israel in Cairo.
   Israel, meanwhile, reserved the right to try to exclude the PLO
from having any meaningful role.
   On Dec. 6, Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department
spokeswoman, announced that Egypt had accepted Baker's proposal.
She called it a ``step forward'' in the peace process.
   But the PLO asserted a more direct role by giving its qualified
acceptance to Robert Pelletreau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia
who has been the U.S. contact with the PLO since a dialogue was
opened a year ago.
   And then Arafat sent a private letter to Bush indicating his
willingness to make peace.
   While the president did not reply, the opening of a PLO channel
to the White House serves to undercut the idea that the United
States is negotiating with Egypt, not the PLO.
   Still, Shamir is standing by his commitment to proceed, despite
concerns by more conservative members of his Likud coalition that
the PLO's prestige and power might be enhanced.
   Within hours of receiving a summary _ but not the text _ of
Egypt's acceptance of Baker's proposal, Shamir and other members of
the Israel ``inner cabinet'' notified the State Department it would
go ahead with preparations. The cabinet designated Rubinstein for
the job last Sunday.

<HEAD>Economists Predict Lower Interest Rates in Next Six Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A variety of business and consumer interest
rates should head down over the next six months as the Federal
Reserve continues its efforts to keep a sluggish economy from
toppling into a recession, many economists predict.
   These analysts were forecasting that banks' prime lending rate,
to which one-third of all business and consumer loans are tied, and
mortgage rates will decline in the wake of further credit easing on
the part of the Fed.
   That was the prevalent view as Federal Reserve policymakers
gathered today for a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee,
the panel of Fed board members and regional bank presidents who
meet eight times a year to map monetary strategy.
   While the meetings are held behind closed doors with the minutes
of the sessions not released until six weeks later, many analysts
were expecting a clear-cut signal of looser credit to emerge from
the discussions, perhaps before the end of the week.
   These economists believe the central bank will decide to reduce
a key interest rate, the federal funds rate, by another 0.25
percentage point, dropping it from 8.5 percent to 8.25 percent.
   The federal funds rate is the rate banks charge each other on
overnight loans. It is the primary lever the central bank uses to
control short-term interet rates.
   When the next easing move occurs, economists were predicting
that banks will quickly follow suit by reducing their prime lending
rates to 10 percent, down from the current 10.5 percent. Analysts
said they expected at least one more cut in the prime lending rate
to 9.5 percent to occur before next summer, in response to further
Fed easing moves.
   Analysts predicted that the credit easing would have a
beneficial effect on mortgage rates as well.
   David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, predicted that
fixed-rate mortgages, currently at a national average of 9.75
percent, will fall to around 9.25 percent by next summer.
   Economists say they are confident in their belief that the Fed
will ease further because economic growth has slowed significantly
while at the same time inflationary pressures have moderated.
   ``It will take additional easing steps to guarantee that we
don't go into a recession,'' said David Jones, an economist with
Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. ``I think we will avoid a recession, but
just barely.''
   Jones and other economists point to the fact that unemployment
has begun rising as various manufacturing companies from autos to
computer firms have announced layoffs in the face of slumping
demand.
   At the same time that growth is slowing, inflationary pressures
are easing. The government announced Friday that prices at the
wholesale level fell in November for the third time in the past
five months, with the drop led by a big decline in gasoline costs.
   ``Inflation has decelerated enough so that the central bank has
a margin of comfort to ease interest rates to boost economic
growth,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   That assessment is far different from the view as 1989 began. At
that time, the central bank was in the midst of a yearlong effort
to drive interest rates higher to dampen demand and keep
inflationary pressure in check.
   However, in May the Fed switched course and began a series of
gradual easing moves as signs mounted that economic growth was
beginning to slow in response to the earlier credit tightening.
   The Bush administration has complained that the Fed has been too
timid in its credit loosening and has brought on an undue risk of a
recession. But most economists give Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan and his colleagues high marks for a delicate job of
balancing the threats of inflation and recession.
   Wyss said he believed the economy will escape without a
recession and that growth will begin rebounding in the second half
of next year, at which time he predicted that the declines in
interest rates will come to an end.

   A toy backhoe and tiny bulldozer were perfect
Christmas gifts for 5-year-old twins who want to be just like dad,
a coal miner who has been on strike for eight months.
   Darren and Justin Noe, wearing T-shirts saying ``UWMA On
Strike,'' were among dozens of children who received gifts at a
United Mine Workers of America Christmas party.
   ``They know we're on strike. I've had them up to the picket
line,'' said the father, Larry Noe, a Pittston Coal Group Inc.
striker. ``The backhoe and dozer were good gifts. They look like
they work in the mines.''
   Teen-age children of the miners were given cards with $20
inside. Striking miners who had been receiving $225 a week from the
union's strike fund were given $1,000 bonuses and the union
prepared hundreds of bags of groceries.
   ``Every family will get a bag, every child will get a toy and
every striking miner will get his $1,000 bonus today,'' said Howard
Green, a member of the UMW international board from District 17 in
Charleston.
   The union prepared food for more than 1,500 people for
Saturday's party at what they call Camp Solidarity II, a converted
department store southwest of Logan. Guests braved single-digit
temperatures and icy roads to make an appearance.
   Up many of the hollows, the ice and snow from a storm painted a
picture worthy of Christmas cards, but many prepared for a meager
holiday because of the strike.
   ``There's not much this year,'' said James Justice, a striker
from Dehue. ``It's been pretty tough.''
   A man dressed as Santa Claus visited the camp and handed
presents to the children. He handed out toy construction equipment,
footballs, basketballs, remote control cars and dolls.
   Everett Street, a former Army mess hall sergeant who is in
charge of the kitchen, said he prepared meals for 1,500 to 1,800
people. Families also brought covered dishes.
   ``The people in the county donated food and collections paid for
more of it. It's all coming together,'' Street said.
   Pittston workers in Virginia and West Virginia went on strike
April 5 after working 14 months without a contract. Kentucky's
Pittston employees joined the strike in late June.
   Coal miners from other areas have been invited to both of the
UMW's strike camps to lend support to the strikers, who say
Pittston is trying to break the union. The UMW also is several
smaller operations in West Virginia, including New Beckley Coal,
over separate issues.
   In the Pittston strike, the company said it needs special
concessions from the union, including Sunday workdays and mandatory
overtime and a release from benefits obligations.
   The union has been distributing benefits from the strike fund to
3,700 strikers nationwide, nearly 2,000 of them from Pittston.
   Talks between the union and Pittston have been continuing in
Arlington, Va., but it's unclear whether the dispute is close to
being resolved. Mediator William Usery has limited media access to
the talks in his bid to end the strike.

<HEAD>Chilean Fruit Exporters Seek Better Sales After Cyanide Scare</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grapes and other fruit from Chile are
beginning to arrive in the United States and exporters are hoping
for a banner year after last season's disastrous cyanide-poisoning
scare.
   Chilean fruit exporters have seen a substantial increase from
previous years in early orders from U.S. grocery chains, said David
Holzworth, a Washington attorney who represents the Chilean
Exporters Association.
   ``The biggest silver lining (of the cyanide scare) for the
industry has been the recognition by retailers of how important
Chilean fruit was to their produce sales,'' Holzworth said.
   He said produce sales for some of the large grocery chains were
off as much as 25 percent last March and April as a result of the
poisoning scare that kept Chilean fruit off the shelves for several
weeks.
   ``The importance of the products to the retail industry has come
home,'' he said. ``So we're looking at a very good year so far as a
result of that recognition.''
   The new season is proceeding under a cooperative agreement
signed by Chilean and U.S. officials that formalizes emergency
procedures to ensure the safety of fresh fruit exported from Chile.
   The memorandum of understanding outlines steps the two countries
would take to handle an emergency like the cyanide scare, should
another occur.
   Several ships have arrived in U.S. ports recently, bringing
early shipments from Chile, but the FDA sees no need to institute
special procedures for monitoring the produce, officials said.
   ``As far as Chilean fruit is concerned, we are in routine
coverage of the fruit,'' said Richard Davis, FDA's regional
director in Philadelphia.
   ``We normally would collect samples of fruit to be analyzed for
pesticides and we would also check for the presence of sulfites,
which is used as a preservative for grapes and only a certain
amount of it is allowed.''
   He added that the FDA is applying ``the same rules to Chilean
fruit as to any other fruit.''
   The scare began March 12, when the FDA announced that it had
found traces of cyanide in two grapes from Chile. Earlier in the
month, an anonymous caller to the U.S. embassy in the Chilean
capital of Santiago had threatened to inject cyanide in export
fruit.
   The FDA ordered Chilean fruit held in ports where it was coming
into the United States, urged stores to remove the fruit from their
shelves and began a series of special inspections to determine
whether any more fruit was contaminated.
   No other fruit was found to be tainted, but millions of dollars
worth of fruit had to be dumped because it had gone bad while it
was withheld from the market during the inspections. At the time,
Chilean exporters and U.S. importers said they lost about $240
million because of the health scare.
   The impact on the Chilean fruit industry is still being felt.
Holzworth said many small companies have gone out of business or
have been bought out by larger companies.
   Grapes constitute about 70 percent of the fruit Chile exports,
and virtually all of the fresh grapes sold in the United States
during the winter months are from Chile.
   Chile exported nearly 44 million crates of fruit to the United
States and Canada last winter, and 6 million crates had to be
dumped.
   This year, if the harvest continues to be good, Chilean
exporters expect to send as much as 48 million crates of fruit to
the United States and Canada, Holzworth said, and ``what you'll see
is the best of the best.''
   Exporters will be sending to U.S. markets ``the premium quality
fruit ... to make sure the initial market acceptance will be
high,'' he said.

   Twenty years after the United States put men on
the moon, the Soviets have admitted they raced to get there first,
U.S. scientists say.
   The Massachusetts Institute of Technology released photographs
of a landing craft and a module built _ but never used _ to put
cosmonauts on the moon and bring them back to Earth.
   The pictures were taken last month by one of a group of U.S.
aeronautics engineers who were shown the equipment while touring
the Moscow Aviation Institute.
   ``We are almost positive that we are the first Westerners to
have seen this,'' said Edward F. Crawley of MIT.
   While many believed that the Soviets wanted to reach the moon
first, they long denied that they were in the race.
   ``What's newsworthy is they are just now admitting that they
were trying to get to the moon. They always denied it,'' said Lee
Saegesser, archivist at the National Aeronautics and Space
Adminsitration in Washington, D.C.
   The Soviets first acknowledged the lunar program in October,
when the newspaper Pravda published an interview with Vasily P.
Mishin, its chief designer.
   The Soviets told the American professors that the spacecraft was
ready to fly the year before the U.S. Apollo 11 mission reached the
moon in 1969. But the project was abandoned because of difficulty
perfecting the rocket booster that would have carried some of the
equipment into space.
   The Americans said the Soviets were nonchalant about showing off
the hardware.
   ``It was off hand,'' said Jack L. Kerrebrock, MIT's acting dean
of engineering, who snapped the pictures.
   ``They took us into the room that houses this hardware to show
it to us as part of their educational program. Indeed, this is how
it's used by students. They crawl around it and make drawings of
it.''
   The Americans said the equipment resembled the U.S. landing
craft except for two major details: The Soviet setup required two
rockets rather than one to carry it into space. And it would have
have carried one man rather than two to the lunar surface.
   The Americans were shown the equipment by their Moscow host,
professor Oleg Alifanov. The Americans _ five from MIT and one from
California Institute of Technology _ were in the Soviet Union to
help set up an exchange program with the Soviet aerospace institute.
   Crawley said the Soviets showed a ``mixture of pride that they
had built it and sorrow that they had never used it and concern
that no one had ever heard about it.''
   Americans Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin were the first to set
foot on the moon on July 20, 1969. The era ended three years later
when Apollo 17 astronauts made the sixth and final lunar landing.
   The Americans said the Soviets told them the lunar lander part
of the mission was ready to go in 1968, and they were under
pressure to hurry because of the Apollo successes. However,
setbacks in the development of the Soviet's N1 booster rocket
delayed the mission.
   They said the moon program was put on hold in 1972 and canceled
two years later. The Soviets then gave priority to their space
station project.
   The Americans saw the Soviet equipment on Nov. 27, and MIT
released Kerrebrock's photos Sunday.
   The N1 booster would have carried the lunar landing craft into
space, while a Proton rocket would have lifted a spacecraft
intended to bring the cosmonauts back to Earth.
   The Americans said the Soviet landing craft, complete with
extendable landing legs, was designed much like the U.S. version.
   ``There is a lot of similarity due to form and function,'' said
Crawley. ``It's the natural form that something that would land on
the moon with men on it would have.''
   Besides Kerrebrock and Crawley, others who saw the equipment
were Lawrence R. Young, Leon Trilling and Daniel E. Hastings of MIT
and Frank Marble of Caltech.

   The 155-foot rocket was to lift off at 7:20 p.m. with the

<HEAD>Report Says Cotton Farmers Likely are White, Male, Fiftyish</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department study shows that
most of the nation's cotton is produced by a relatively small,
specialized group of operators whose main occupation is farming but
who often don't live on their land.
   Based on a review of 1987 U.S. farm census figures, only 19
percent of the nation's cotton farm operators reported another
principal occupation, compared with 45 percent for U.S. farm
operators in general.
   However, only about half of the cotton farmers lived on the
farms they operated in 1987, compared with 71 percent for farmers
in general.
   The study by Leslie A. Meyer and Scott Sanford of the
department's Economic Research Service compared some of the
characteristics of cotton farming with other types of agriculture
and how those changed since 1982.
   According to the census of agriculture, which is taken every
five years, the typical cotton farm operator is male, white and
approximately 50 years old.
   ``However, female, younger, and certain minority operators are
becoming more prevalent, and one would expect them to play an
increasing role in the future operations of cotton farms,'' the
report said.
   Women increased their share of cotton farming to 3.5 percent in
1987 from 3 percent in 1982, with the largest number of female
operators in Texas and Mississippi.
   Despite the gain, women ``were still under-represented relative
to the 6.3 percent operating U.S. farms of all kinds,'' the report
said.
   Although there is ``no definitive explanation'' for the gradual
increase in female-operated farms, the report speculated that the
trend may be attributed to several factors:
   _The willingness of women to identify themselves as principal
farm operators.
   _A possible increase in unwillingness among young widows to sell
their farms or leave farming upon the death of a spouse.
   _A rise in the number of young women who feel the call and have
the confidence to run a farm.
   Under a ``standard industrial classification'' definition used
by the Commerce Department, a cotton farm is one that derives at
least 50 percent of its total annual sales value from cotton
production.
   Although acknowledging ``there are many farms that produce
cotton,'' the study dealt only with those ``SIC farms'' defined by
Commerce. Those totaled 27,673 farms in 1987, up 32 percent from
21,041 counted in the 1982 farm census, reflecting further emphasis
on cotton among farm operators.
   By comparison, U.S. farm numbers in general declined to fewer
than 2.2 million in 1987 from about 2.4 million in 1982.
   Leading states for cotton farms were reported as Texas, 11,741
farms in 1987 and 9,242 in 1982; Mississippi, 3,176 and 2,692; and
Louisiana, 2,223 and 1,899.
   The study showed that in 1987 about 69 percent of the so-called
SIC cotton farms contained 260 acres or more, compared with less
than 65 percent in 1982.
   States with the largest percentage of cotton farms 260 acres or
more were: South Carolina, 76 percent; Arizona, 74.1; Texas, 73.7;
and Georgia, 64.5. In addition, 15.5 percent of South Carolina's
cotton farms were 2,000 acres or more, compared with 12.5 percent
in Mississippi and 9.8 percent in Arizona.
   At the opposite end, small farms of fewer than 100 acres
represented only 13.9 percent of the total SIC cotton farms in
1987, compared with 17.5 percent of the total in the 1982 census.
   States with the highest percentages of small cotton farms
included New Mexico, 33.8 percent; Tennessee, 29.7 percent; and
North Carolina, 24.1 percent.
   ``Both censuses demonstrate that the preponderance of U.S.
cotton farmers are white,'' the report said. ``The proportion of
minorities decreased from 5 percent to 3 percent between 1982 and
1987, with all states except New Mexico and North Carolina showing
declines.''
   However, the report added, ``The absolute number of minority
cotton farm operators increased in Arizona, New Mexico, North
Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. Mississippi had the largest number
of minority operators in both 1982 and 1987.''
   Minority cotton farm operators in both 1982 and 1987 ``were more
likely than white to own the land they operated and somewhat less
likely to be tenants,'' the report said. ``However, by 1987
minority operators as a group were more likely to be part owners or
tenants and less likely to be full owners than they had been in
1982.''
   The report added: ``This shift toward more tenants and fewer
full owners was also apparent among white operators, although
blacks and other (minority) operators exhibited a
disproportionately large drop in their incidence of full
ownership.''
   In 1982 and 1987, the age group of 55 to 64 was the largest for
cotton farmers, with an average age of 48.8 years in 1982 and 49.7
in 1987, with the youngest in Georgia (45.9 in 1987) and the oldest
in Oklahoma (51.9).
   ``Thus, the average age of the U.S. cotton farm operator
increased only slightly,'' the report said. ``The slim advance can
be attributed to the meager expansion of the average age range of
operators in the producing states.''

<HEAD>Bush Flies to West Indies for Lunch With Mitterrand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MARIGOT, St. Martin (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush confesses ``only one
complaint, one regret'' about his seaside soiree with the president
of France: ``that we have to leave this beautiful paradise on such
a short notice.''
   But it's not exactly as if someone were about to order the
president of the United States to leave this tropical Caribbean
island and return to the nation's capital _ caught in the grips of
sub-freezing weather.
   After all, the French West Indies is a bit of a trek just for
lunch and a walk on the beach _ even for globetrotting diplomats
like Bush and Francois Mitterrand, who jets about in a supersonic
Air France Concorde.
   In his more sedate Air Force One, a 25-year-old Boeing 707, Bush
had to leave Washington before dawn and fly for three and a half
hours for Saturday's brief Franco-American encounter.
   Their meetings lasted just over three hours _ and that included
a beach walk, lunch and a 45-minute news conference.
   Then, Bush left this land of gentle trade winds, palm trees and
a temperature in the 80s to fly another three and a half hours back
to Washington, where the temperature when he landed at snow-covered
Andrews Air Force Base was 5 degrees.
   ``I'm disappointed the meeting didn't break apart so we could
have spent a week here,'' said Secretary of State James A. Baker
III, shaking his head in mock dismay.
   But nobody was about to tell Bush to slow down, not even Baker.
   Why did Bush travel so far for such a short meeting?
   ``It's not much different than going to Houston for the
weekend,'' offered press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.

   ``It doesn't hurt, just can't talk,'' was how Bush described his
most recent bout with laryngitis. French President Mitterrand came
to the rescue _ by dominating their joint news conference and
giving Bush plenty of time to rest his raspy voice.
   Not only did Mitterrand, the host on this French island for the
weekend get-together, decide whom to call on, but he also tended
toward lengthy, expansive answers.
   Several times, as Mitterrand droned on, Bush looked to U.S.
reporters sitting in the first row and shrugged his shoulders.
   One of the few times Bush called on a reporter, he requested
Mitterrand's permission to pick ``the man who thought he had been
recognized'' for the previous question. But the reporter Bush
selected turned out to have a question in French for Mitterrand.
   The two leaders had headphones so they could listen to
translations of questions and answers into their respective
languages.
   Bush, who sometimes likes to blurt out phrases in high-school
French, decided to trust instead to the official translator and
spent much of the news conference with one earpiece held tightly to
his ear.
   And, for his part, Mitterrand seemed temporarily taken aback
when questions turned to whether Bush's ``special relationship''
with him was on a par with U.S. friendship with Britain's Margaret
Thatcher.
   ``There is room enough for several friendships in life,'' he
said.
   Then he was asked if his response would have been the same
before last Jan. 20 _ Bush's inauguration day.
   Mitterrand looked confused and asked what was the significance
of Jan. 20. To rising laughter, it finally dawned on him. ``I need
a triple translation,'' he joked.
   Then he said that he had gotten along just as well with former
President Reagan.

   Tim McBride, Bush's personal aide, is seldom more than a few
paces from the president's side. But he found some rare time on his
hands during the Bush-Mitterrand meeting.
   So he went for a dip in the warm, inviting Caribbean. However,
the beach had been closed because of the high-level gathering and
French security officers wasted little time in ordering McBride out
of the water.
   Clad only in a bathing suit, the embarrassed aide had a hard
time persuading the gendarmes he really worked at the White House.
He was briefly taken into custody until he could get the U.S.
Secret Service to vouch for him.

   Doctors were trying to learn why a 2-year-old
boy died after twice receiving split livers in transplants.
   Mitchell Wallace of Hannibal, N.Y., died Saturday of multiple
systems failure, said Margie Buczynski, a spokeswoman for
Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. She said doctors planned to
perform tests to determine what caused the failure.
   A lack of available donor organs led doctors to try the
split-liver transplants, which are possible because the organs
regenerate themselves.
   Mitchell received his first split liver Nov. 29, but the liver
did not function properly, doctors said.
   On Wednesday, doctors split one liver to transplant into
Mitchell and a 3-year-old child, whom the hospital did not identify
at the parents' request.
   The 3-year-old was in serious condition late Saturday, Ms.
Buczynski said. Hospital officials would not release the child's
condition Sunday.
   Before the operations, Mitchell had suffered from liver failure
of unknown origin. He was found to have hepatitis after his own
liver was removed.

<HEAD>Bennett Calls Legalized Drug Supporters Indifferent to Minorities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal anti-drug coordinator William Bennett
says the argument that drugs should be legalized is fed by
indifference to the fact that a large number of drug users are
minorities.
   ``I have to tell you I've heard in some circles, `Well, let them
kill each other,''' Bennett said Sunday on the ABC-TV program,
``This Week With David Brinkley.''
   ``That is not worthy of the American people,'' said Bennett. He
did not say who harbored that attitude.
   Bennett, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
has been a vocal opponent of calls to legalize illicit drugs.
Advocates of legalization include Baltimore mayor Kurt L. Schmoke,
who is black, economist Milton Friedman, and U.S. District Judge
Robert Sweet, who last week became the first federal judge to
publicly voice such an opinion.
   Friedman and Sweet also appeared on the show, but did not
address Bennett's comments.
   Bennett made his remarks in response to a question by
conservative columnist George Will.
   ``Do you think if the people disproportionately killing
themselves off were white suburban high school students there would
be a different kind of argument going on?'' Will asked. ``I'm
asking is there a certain racial indifference in this argument?''
   ``I'm afraid there is,'' Bennett responded.

<NOTE>Mosbacher Says US Negotiating Controls With Hungary, Poland</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The United States has begun negotiating with
Poland and Hungary in an effort to prevent diversion to the Soviet
Union of U.S. high-technology exports bound for those two East
European countries, says Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher.
   Mosbacher's remarks Sunday came a day after President Bush
signaled that his administration is ready to consider a major
relaxation of export controls with regard to Warsaw Pact nations.
   ``I think it is timely that we take a new look at the commercial
restraints,'' Bush said Saturday at a news conference on the
Caribbean island of St. Martin after meeting with French President
Francois Mitterrand.
   Mosbacher, appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' program, was
asked about a pending request by the Control Data Corp. to sell
several high-powered computers to the Soviet Union.
   The commerce secretary responded that ``we'll have to look at
each item on a case-by-case basis.''
   ``We released middle technology and we're going to look to see
whether it should go higher than that,'' Mosbacher said. ``Eastern
European countries, yes; the Soviet Union, we'd have to be very
careful.''

<NOTE>World Bank Sees More Aid to East Europe</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank, the biggest source of aid to
the Third World, is planning new help to Eastern Europe but will
not reduce aid to developing countries, says bank Vice President
Stanley Fischer.
   ``As far as the World Bank is concerned, we don't see how
lending to Eastern Europe is going to detract from our lending to
Africa and Latin America,'' Fischer, the bank's top economist, said
at a news conference Friday.
   World Bank President Barber W. Conable said the bank had $350
million worth of loans prepared for projects in Poland and might
lend as much as $1 billion more in the coming year. So far Poland
has not had any loans from the bank.
   ``As Poland stabilizes, if it does, it's very likely that our
lending program will increase,'' Fischer said.
   Hungary got $345 million in loans, Yugoslavia $198 million and
China $1.3 billion in the year that ended June 30. There would have
been more for China, but Conable cut off new loans when Beijing
violently crushed the movement for more democracy last June.

<HEAD>Canadian Scallopers See U.S. Poachers Move in on Their Catch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cat and mouse game played out for
the past five years on Georges Bank is driving Canadians toward a
tougher stand against Americans poaching on their rich fishing
grounds, officials said.
   ``I'd equate it with a small boy teasing a dog. The dog will go
along with it for only so long and then he'll bite,'' says Jeremy
D. Conway, chief of investigations for the Canadian Department of
Fisheries and Oceans.
   When the World Court divided the territory about 120 miles off
Cape Cod in 1984, American scallopers learned fast that their
two-thirds couldn't match the Canadians' rich portion. Periodic
incursions became the norm.
   But the raids have more than tripled in recent weeks, according
to Canadian and U.S. officials, who report as many as 20 U.S. boats
now cluster at the international line each night.
   Last week, a Canadian navy destroyer tailed a Fairhaven,
Mass.-based scalloper for 12 hours, during which a collision was
reported and warning shots were fired.
   Canadian scallopers, who have observed government-imposed
fishing quotas, are near despair. Their industry is losing more
than a $1 million a month to poachers even as 1,500 factory workers
in the outpost town of Canso are losing their jobs and skippers are
missing boat payments, officials said.
   ``We wouldn't allow American citizens to come up and raid our
shopping malls or banks,'' said Carl Goodwin, chief of surveillance
operations at the Canadian fisheries department. ``Why let them
raid our natural resources? We have to stop this before someone
gets hurt.''
   Radar and patrol records indicate a clear pattern. As soon as
the lone naval destroyer patrolling the boundary starts moving out
of sight, intruders steam in and haul out as many scallops as
possible. When the patrol ship comes back into view, the violators
take off.
   The incursions have become easier because Nova Scotia's
scallopers have been ashore since October, when they filled their
quotas. At the same time, Canada's Coast Guard, which usually
patrols the Hague Line, has been on strike.
   Robert Prier, the fishing department's director of conservation
and protection, said ``the flagrant disregard for Canadian
boundaries and authorities'' has worn very thin and warships have
been more frequently giving chase.
   ``They have been tolerant in the past, but this latest action
signifies a new direction in Canadian policy,'' said Lt. Craig
Lloyd, who is based at Coast Guard headquarters in Boston. ``We
will not interfere with their law enforcement efforts in
international waters.''
   Lloyd said no Canadians have been reported poaching in U.S.
waters, but, ``if we had Canadian fishing vessels over on our side
of the line we would take action to stop them.''
   The Fairhaven-based Concordia's captain said his charts
indicated he was in international waters. He compared the ``hot
pursuit'' to a wartime assault.
   ``Even if they see a boat fishing a half-mile over the line and
chase them out, isn't that good enough? Why do they want to start
sinking boats?'' William Furey Jr. asked Sunday.
   ``You're talking about a small boat and a few scallops or a few
fish. Is that serious enough to have 10 families burying their son
or husband a Christmas time?''
   But Canadian officials and fishermen, who note the high tech
navigation equipment virtually all scallopers use, rejected the
scenario.
   ``If you don't want war then don't break the rules,'' Goodwin
said. ``And if you want to take the risk ... then don't cry when
the shots are fired, or say we're too aggressive.''
   For the Canadian scallopers moored along these craggy shores,
the violations provoke a particularly bitter reaction. They stuck
to the government quotas imposed to protect against overfishing and
tied up their boats more than two months ago.
   Now it's Christmas time. Their savings are stretched and the
community's frustration mounts daily with second-hand reports of
how American poachers are illegally hauling in a hefty holiday
catch.
   ``Our boats are tied up and men are out of work while these
American guys are catching our scallops,'' said Albert Eisner, who
started fishing as a teen-ager. ``They're making fools of us. It's
an insult.''
   The story was different for the generations of scallopers from
New England and Canada who fished Georges Bank side by side, but
the brothers bound by sea have turned to battle since the Hague
Line was drawn.
   ``These guys have so many common bonds in the maritime
environment. They've often helped each other out through the
years,'' said Fred Greene, who runs several Nova Scotia-area
fishing enterprises. ``But our fishermen are being pushed to
desperation.''
   The problem defies easy solution. Canada lacks a treaty to
extradite Americans for fishing violations. Lloyd said the U.S.
Coast Guard planned to step up patrols and officials from both
countries have been discussing stiffer penalties for U.S.
intruders, but so far they're still paying less than 1 percent of
the $700,000 fines Canadian violators pay.
   ``You can't go out and solve this with warships. There's got to
be a better way,'' said Paul Allen, who has been scalloping for 34
years. ``But we better do something soon because I've no doubt it's
going to get worse.''

   People dressed as early Colonists and American
Indians rushed aboard a ship and dumped boxes of ``tea'' into
Boston Harbor on the 216th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party.
   The re-enactment Sunday evening of the Colonials' protest
against British tariffs took on a modern twist as some of the 50 or
so spectators, wary of how the Legislature might try to ease
Massachusetts' budget problems, shouted, ``No new taxes!''
   Under cover of night, with temperatures in the low teens, 15 to
20 people hacked into tea boxes and threw the contents _ leaves
instead of tea _ from the brig Beaver II into the harbor, just as
Colonials did with 347 boxes in 1773.
   Nine ``Redcoats'' then boarded the ship, and escorted the
``Colonials'' off to fife and drum music.
   The Tea Party was a protest of British tariffs on the brew and
England's practice of taxing Colonial Americans without allowing
them representation in Parliament. The protest helped spark the
Revolutionary War less than two years later.
   ``I'm a loyal revolutionary believing unjust taxes shouldn't be
on something we can get for a cheaper price,'' said Joe Kolb of
Watertown, who has played a Colonist in the re-enactment since 1976.
   ``I'll be here as long as I can swing an ax,'' said Kolb, a
field investigator for a utility company.
   ``We whipped the citizens into a frenzy about the tea, and they
decided to do something about it,'' said John Vann, speaking as Sam
Adams, the ``ringleader'' of the original protest.
   Vann, chairman of the Massachusetts Council of Minutemen and
Militia, wore Colonial garb and a ponytailed wig.
   He said the tea and debris from the boxes would be removed from
the already polluted harbor by a Boston Tea Party Ship and Museum
employee in a canoe.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Bruce Ritter has long been synonymous
with Covenant House, the Times Square shelter that grew into a
world-renowned refuge for street kids through the Franciscan's
vision, savvy and tenaciousness.
   Now, Ritter is faced with allegations that threaten not only his
reputation but also the very viability of the institution he
created.
   Last week, Ritter was forced to call a news conference to deny
reports that he had sex with a young man he had helped, and that he
improperly spent Covenant House funds on the man.
   ``It's every organization's nightmare,'' said E. Jeff Baron,
executive director of Emergency Shelter, which also helps runaway
youths. ``It basically strikes at the very heart of what you're
trying to accomplish.''
   Since 1968, when Ritter took some runaways into his Greenwich
Village apartment, he has fought bureaucracy, the limits of
government aid and competition from other charities to make
Covenant House grow.
   It is now an $85 million-a-year operation that manages 17
shelters with more than 2,000 beds in the United States, Toronto
and Latin America, and directly serves about 25,000 kids a year.
   Critics have said Covenant House is too big to be properly
supervised, and so good at raising money that it squeezes out
smaller sophisticated programs. But until last week, Ritter's
publicity had been almost all good.
   Presidents Reagan and Bush and their first ladies visited
Covenant House; Attorney General Edwin Meese III appointed Ritter
to his commission on pornography; Reagan called him ``an unsung
hero.''
   On Wednesday, the Manhattan district attorney confirmed he is
investigating charges of financial improprieties by Ritter, charges
made by a 20-year-old former male prostitute who also reportedly
claimed he had a sexual relationship with the 62-year-old priest.
   Cardinal John J. O'Connor said Sunday he has complete trust in
Ritter.
   ``In all of our dealings and in all of his work in this
archdiocese, he has demonstrated himself to be a soul of goodness
and of integrity,'' O'Connor said during Mass at St. Patrick's
Cathedral. ``Certainly I have been given no reason to believe that
that goodness or integrity has been violated.''
   Baron and others noted the vulnerability of a charitable
organization whose image is so closely identified with that of one
person such as Ritter, a master of public relations. Covenant House
depends on private sources for 95 percent of its funding.
   ``People don't always hear the `not guilty.' What they hear is
the accusation,'' said Baron, adding: ``If something happens to
Covenant House there's a major void in the system and there are
just not that many beds in the city.''
   More than 80 percent of Covenant House's funds come via a
sophisticated direct-mail operation from individual donors, the
rest from corporations and foundations. Ritter's signed, carefully
targeted letters to donors tell stories of ``my kids'' in familiar
tones and ask for financial help.
   Hours after the prosecutor's statement, supporters showed up at
a glitzy fund-raiser Wednesday night.
   ``You've got thousands of kids depending on Covenant House for a
roof, for a bed, for food, and we're not going to diminish our
efforts to help these kids, no matter what,'' said Jack Shea,
president of Spiegel Inc., which organized the event with artist
Peter Max.
   Patrick Kennedy, a Covenant House vice president, said donors
have voiced concern as well as support since the allegations
surfaced in the New York Post. He said the agency, whose weekly
costs average about $1.4 million, would be able to carry on even if
a cloud _ legal or perceived _ were to persist over Ritter's name.
   ``There might be a period when even more belt-tightening than
usual might go on, but I doubt very seriously that the agency
itself would be in any danger of folding, simply because it has
been functioning as long as it has,'' Kennedy said.
   Under an existing plan for Covenant House after Ritter, the
national board would choose a new chief executive officer from
among several Franciscans who will have ``understudied,'' Kennedy
said. The board itself would be responsible for running the agency.
   District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said the investigation was
in its ``earliest stages,'' and that Covenant House was cooperating.
   Ritter said Thursday he doesn't plan to resign or temporarily
step aside. ``I am so identified with Covenant House I think that
without me presently in this leadership role the work we do would
suffer very much,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Dips, Stocks At Another Record High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell slightly against the Japanese yen
today, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed at a
record high for the fourth consecutive trading day.
   The dollar finished trading at 144.22 yen, down 0.08 yen from
Friday's close of 144.30 yen. After opening at 144.30 yen, its high
for the day, the U.S. currency ranged as low as 144.10 yen in quiet
trading.
   Dealers said trading was mixed, reflecting the market's usual
slowdown at the end of the year.
   They said market attention was focused on the dollar and the
mark today because of the dollar's early volatility against the
West German currency.
   A dealer at a major Japanese bank said there was some
dollar-selling by trust banks, but with most participants already
having fixed their positions in advance of the New Year's holidays,
he said the U.S currency was likely to stay in a very narrow range.
   Participants said prospects for an interest rate reduction by
the U.S. Federal Reserve Board this week were good, after Friday's
reports showed U.S. producer prices falling 0.1 percent in November
after rising 0.4 percent in October, but said the market had
already largely discounted the expected move.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which gained 90.34 points for a record-high closing on
Friday, added another 315.14 points, or 0.82 percent, to close at
38,586.18.
   It was the sixth consecutive advance for the Nikkei index, which
has set new highs for four straight days since Wednesday.
   Securities dealers said the index continued to soar as the
market's enthusiasm outpaced some profit-taking by cautious
investors.
   While shares rose almost across the board, the rises in
construction and petroleum shares were particularly notable,
dealers said.
   Dealers attributed the Nikkei's continuing rise to favorable
economic and political conditions worldwide, and the strong showing
of the futures market.
   ``I would not be surprised if this bullish trend lasts until the
end of the year,'' said a dealer at a major securites company,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Volume traded on the first section of the exchange, where major
shares are listed, was estimated at 850 million shares.

<HEAD>Witnesses to Priest Killings Tell Story</HEAD>

   A Salvadoran couple who witnessed the massacre
of six Jesuit priests described a night of terror they blame on
their country's military.
   The couple later recanted the account, but now say that was
because they were intimidated under questioning by FBI agents and a
Salvadoran colonel, The New York Times reported today. U.S.
officials, including President Bush, have denied there was any
intimidation.
   The story of Lucia Barrera de Cerna and her husband, Jorge
Cerna, and their accusations of intimidation have been widely
reported by church and human-rights groups. Today, a brief,
first-hand account from the couple appeared in the Times.
   ``I felt terrible, terrible, when I changed my version, but I
changed it out of fear,'' Mrs. Cerna told the paper Sunday.
   The slaying of the priests, their housekeeper and the
housekeeper's daughter in San Salvador on Nov. 16 came at the
height of an offensive by leftist rebels, and provoked widespread
anger among those who immediately suspected it was the work of
death squads allied with the military.
   The Cernas took their story to foreign embassies and were
brought to Miami on Nov. 23 to be protected and interviewed by U.S.
authorities.
   Mrs. Cerna said she was awakened about 1 a.m. the night of the
massacre by gunfire and looked outside to see five men, at least
two in camouflage fatigues, carrying rifles and wearing caps with
visors.
   ``They looked like the soldiers I have seen on the streets, the
ones with uniforms who patrol parts of the city,'' she told the
newspaper.
   One of the priests was speaking as the men entered their
building, she said.
   ``Then the firing increased and the father stopped speaking,''
she recalled.
   Cerna said he saw seven or eight men wearing soldiers' uniforms
with wide suspenders and belts.
   ``I believed at that moment that they were soldiers of the
army,'' he said. ``I believed that because the whole area we were
in was controlled by the army and because no private citizen could
walk around with the curfew and the patrols.''
   The Cernas said they recanted that version of events under tough
questioning and accusations by two FBI agents and a man they later
learned was Lt. Col. Manuel Antonio Rivas Majia, head of El
Salvador's U.S.-financed Special Investigative Unit.
   They have been granted humanitarian parole status by U.S.
immigration officials and given work permits good for a year.

<HEAD>Black Political Leaders Say Vance Led Fight Against Segregation</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Judge-Explosion, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assassinated Federal Judge Robert S.
Vance was praised upon his death for helping blacks overcome the
onetime segregationist politics of George Wallace.
   Vance, a 58-year-old judge on the Atlanta-based U.S. 11th
Circuit Court of Appeals, was killed by a mail bomb that went off
at his home Saturday afternoon. His wife was seriously injured.
   ``Bob Vance led the fight to integrate the state Democratic
Party. We are very much saddened by his death,'' said state Rep.
Alvin Holmes of Montgomery. ``He was a great friend to the black
people of this state.''
   Vance, a Talladega native, entered the University of Alabama at
age 15. When he was a senior, he was elected student body
president. He graduated from the university's law school in 1952,
spent two years in the Army and in 1955 received a master's of law
degree from George Washington University Law School in Washington.
He then returned to Birmingham.
   Vance first gained statewide attention with his efforts to get
the Legislature to redraw legislative districts to reflect changes
in population in the early 1960s.
   At that time, the State Democratic Executive Committee was
controlled by a staunchly conservative coalition of states rights
advocates and Dixiecrats loyal to then-Gov. Wallace.
   Vance, then a young lawyer, became the champion for Democrats
who were afraid that Wallace's growing influence would cause a
split with the national Democratic party.
   He was elected state party chairman in 1966 and won re-election
twice during the next 11 years. He soon began the political
wrangling necessary to fully integrate the all-white Democratic
party.
   ``He ushered in a new era,'' said Joe Reed, chairman of the
state party's black political caucus. ``Bob Vance was a healer and
a builder for the Democratic Party and because he lived, the
Democratic Party is alive today.''
   Under Vance's leadership, Reed and Mobile attorney Arthur D.
Shores became the first blacks from Alabama to attend a national
Democratic convention _ the 1968 Chicago convention.
   At that convention, when Wallace, Vance and John Cashin of the
now-defunct National Democratic Party of Alabama were trying to
seat delegates, the delegates chose Vance's integrated group.
   One of Vance's first moves as state party chairman was to bring
about the removal of the white rooster _ a symbol of white
supremacy with the slogan ``For the Right'' _ from atop the party's
election ballots.
   ``He felt like we had to move forward out of the racial unrest
we were in,'' said Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., who met Vance more
than 30 years ago when they were young trial lawyers. ``He believed
we ought to approach these things, not draw a line in the dust.''
   Wallace unsuccessfully challenged Vance's leadership many times.
``He ran someone against him every year,'' said Executive Director
Al LaPierre.
   ``Vance had to be very courageous to take a stand against
Wallace,'' said Holmes, who was appointed with other blacks by
Vance to the party's executive committee.
   Vance invited blacks to his home in the exclusive Birmingham
suburb of Mountain Brook during the 1960s and `70s ``when blacks
weren't allowed out in Mountain Brook unless they had on a maid
uniform,'' Holmes said.
   ``He understood the suffering and discrimination that black
people had endured in the state of Alabama.''

<TEXT>
   With Massachusetts' economy in a tailspin and
hundreds of workers laid off in the Christmas season, charities are
seeing scores of people who never before had problems paying
mortgages or heating bills.
   ``There is definitely people coming in and saying `I lost my
job, I haven't worked in two weeks, I need help,''' said Jody Zeek
of the St. Vincent DePaul Society, a volunteer organization
operating out of the area's Roman Catholic parishes.
   ``I can tell almost immediately by their body language that this
is not their cup of tea, but they are desperate,'' said Herbert
Hershey, a social worker for the Salvation Army in Framingham.
``They've had good jobs, but they are so desperate now they come in
here for food and fuel.''
   He said his chapter has helped 60 percent more people this year
than the year before.
   Massachusetts has been struggling with an anticipated $825
million budget deficit.
   Last week, 706 state employees received layoff notices, and the
number laid off is expected to climb to more than 1,200 by the end
of December.
   The slumping economy also has hurt some of the region's large
employers, such as Wang Laboratories Inc., General Motors Corp. and
Prime Computer Inc., all of which have trimmed their work forces
considerably.
   Marcia Countie, executive director of United Ways of
Massachusetts, which funds the Salvation Army and the Red Cross and
other large charities, said the layoffs have created a ``tremendous
crisis.''
   ``In our economy today, all of us live one paycheck to another,
and when that gets interrupted, for families it's catastrophic,''
she said.
   One woman, a Framingham resident, had a computer job that paid
her about $40,000 before she was laid off. Now she bags groceries
for $6.50 an hour, trying to meet her mortgage payments, Hershey
said.
   ``My heart goes out to those who are very reluctant, very
embarrassed,'' he said. ``How can we help them?''
   A Natick widow with two children in college said her job lets
her pay one bill at a time, but her paycheck doesn't allow for
emergencies.
   In November, she was faced with paying for her daughter's knee
surgery. The surgery led her to the Salvation Army, seeking help to
pay for fuel.
   ``I felt like I had no right to this because there are so many
people with worse problems, but then I see it's a very thin line at
this point, and it probably wouldn't take much to put me there,''
said the woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The woman said she had taken a part-time retail job to
supplement her income, earning $5 an hour.
   In Natick, a former bank vice president who lost his job came to
the Salvation Army for food during Thanksgiving, spokesman Steve
Copaccia said.
   ``These are people who never knew what the Salvation Army did.
They didn't need us,'' he said. ``Now they come in for help with
paying for their heating bill.''
   Charity volunteers said they also have seen an increase of
people either on welfare or with low-paying jobs because the state
has cut government programs serving the needy.
   ``We've had cutbacks before, but I've never seen it this bad,''
Countie said.

<HEAD>Family Evacuated from Volcano's Shadow; No End in Sight</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A family living in the shadow of
reawakened Redoubt Volcano was airlifted to safer ground, and
scientists warned that the mountain could go on launching ash and
steam for some time.
   The continent's most notorious volcano, Mount St. Helens in
Washington state, also showed signs of life after more than three
years of silence.
   In Alaska, the rescue came on the fourth day of intermittent ash
and steam eruptions from the mountain, which lies in a sparsely
populated region 115 miles southwest of Anchorage.
   Nancy and Steve Jones and their 13-month-old son, Henry, were
evacuated from Tuwalaka Lodge, 10 miles south of the volcano, by a
private helicopter company Sunday. For two days, ash clouds and
poor weather had stymied efforts to reach the Joneses, who are
caretakers at the lodge.
   The lodge wasn't damaged, and no debris landed nearby, but the
family fretted through the first days of the eruption, Mrs. Jones
said.
   ``It was a little bit worrisome,'' she said. ``We're real
thankful that the wind was blowing the other way. We were worried
the top might blow off our way and give us a bad time that way.''
   The Joneses weren't sure if they would return once the volcano
quiets.
   ``We really like it out there, it's beautiful,'' she said.
``It's a perfect place to spend the winter, barring the volcano.''
   Hunks of pumice the size of softballs rained on the roof of
another isolated dwelling, the Big River Lake Lodge, but caretakers
Mike and Sandy Coulter decided to stay, said owner Dennis Branham.
That lodge is 30 miles north of the Redoubt.
   Scientists at the Alaska Volcano Observatory relished the
opportunity to train modern instruments on the 10,197-foot mountain.
   They hoped to reach the peak today by helicopter for a
first-hand look, said John Richter, a geologist at the observatory.
   By correlating ground observations with instrument readings, the
scientists hope to gather information that could help anticipate
eruptions or determine the importance of seismic activity on the
mountain in Lake Clark National Park. ``We have no baseline data to
judge it by now,'' Richter said. ``This is the first time we're
getting good data on it.''
   He said scientists have no idea how long the volcano might spew
ash and steam. ``It could go on for quite a while at rate. We sort
of call it a (phase) five _ a long period of moderate explosive
activity, punctuated with some larger bursts.''
   The mountain Sunday hurled ash and steam 30,000 feet in the air.
   No injuries have been reported in the eruptions, but plumes of
gritty, sulfurous ash have disrupted aviation in this
plane-dependent state.
   The Anchorage International Airport was open Sunday, but service
remained spotty, with some airlines grounding aircraft and others
offering limited service. Some businesses covered sensitive
equipment for fear ash would filter into buildings.
   The skies over Anchorage were clear Sunday, after drifting ash
caused power outages and prompted health warnings Saturday.
   In Washington on Thursday, Mount St. Helens issued a small burst
of steam, gas and ash, but scientists said an eruption did not
appear to be imminent.

   Warner-Lambert Co. is recalling about
1.7 million packages of oral contraceptives because iron tablets
were misplaced in some boxes, and that could lead to unwanted
pregnancies.
   The pills were misplaced in fewer than 100 dispensers, but the
1.7 million packages of Loestrin and Norlestrin contraceptive
tablets were recalled as a precaution, the company said Sunday.
   The pills are made by its by Parke-Davis Division.
   The brown, iron tablets were placed in the first row rather than
the fourth row of the 28-pill dispensers, Warner-Lambert said. If a
woman took the seven iron tablets before taking the 21 white,
yellow, pink or green tablets, pregnancy could occur, the company
said.
   The iron tablets are placed in the packages to help women get
used to taking the pills, said spokesman Barry Cohen.
   ``Anybody who's been on the product would know something is
wrong,'' Cohen said.
   Cohen said the pills were made between one and five months ago,
and generally reach the market four to six weeks after manufacture.

<TEXT>
   The labyrinthine passages of the Wilberg
Mine, their rich coal seams exhausted, are mostly silent now. But
the harsh lessons of the inferno that claimed 27 lives five years
ago have not been forgotten.
   ``It changed the industry,'' said J. Brett Harvey, vice
president for fuel resources at mine owner Utah Power &amp; Light Co,
which has instituted sweeping changes in safety and technical
procedures.
   ``I think government as well as mine operators look at safety
from a new angle, mostly because of the tragedy.''
   But for Rick Boyle, president of United Mine Workers Local 2176,
even the strictest precautions can't mitigate the dangers of
two-entry longwall mining, in which two passages lead to and from
the coal seam.
   Utah Power and other western underground mine operators insist
the system is the only way to support the weight of the mountain
above as massive machines cut coal from panels hundreds of feet
long.
   The union counters that, as in the case of the Wilberg fire,
miners could be trapped without a third way out.
   On Dec. 19, 1984, extra workers had been summoned to one section
of the mine, the Fifth Right, more than an mile underground to make
a run at a 24-hour production record. There were 28 people where 13
or 14 usually worked for Emery Mining Co., which operated Utah
Power's mines at the time.
   Smoke first was spotted in the roof of the main tunnel system
near Fifth Right's entrance, and soon began snaking along a loop of
ventilation up one passage and down the other.
   Boyle, a diesel mechanic working elsewhere in the mine, was
among those who aimed extinguishers and water hoses at the hot spot
until someone on the surface ordered the power killed, cutting off
the underground pumps for nearly two hours. Meantime, nearly 80
people in other areas were evacuated as firefighters and rescue
teams assembled.
   Kenny Blake, the only miner to escape Fifth Right, has said he
and several others donned emergency breathing devices and groped
through the darkness and smoke toward the main tunnel. Finally,
separated along the way, Blake emerged unharmed.
   Most of the others died of smoke inhalation or carbon monoxide
poisoning in the two entries. One man made his way thousands of
feet deeper into the mine until he apparently was overcome by
carbon monoxide. Three bodies were found in a connecting tunnel
partially blocked by a cave-in.
   That passage was not designated an escapeway, and an inspector
with the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration had issued a
variance allowing the blockage to remain.
   Within three days, officials worried about explosions evacuated
the mine and left the bodies behind, to be retrieved nearly a year
later. With flames visible at the surface Dec. 26, the Wilberg was
sealed.
   In October 1986, an MSHA investigation concluded the fire began
at an air compressor rigged to operate with its heat sensor and
on-off switch disconnected and left running, all but unnoticed, for
nearly 70 hours.
   The UMW later issued its own report, bitterly denouncing the
two-entry system, the variance on the blocked tunnel and ``the
failure to provide escape routes that were safely ventilated and
the failure to protect miners from a fire that killed them.''
   Utah Power was sued by most of the victims' families and
eventually reached a $22 million out-of-court settlement. The
utility took over operation of all its coal mines in 1986, and a
year later it and Emery were fined a record $113,944 for 41 alleged
violations, including nine MSHA said directly contributed to the
fire.
   Emery paid $7,115 for 17 citations, but Utah Power contested the
rest. A hearing is scheduled for March, said MSHA spokeswoman
Katharine Snyder. Also scheduled are trials involving insurance
issues and product liability.
   Utah Power has installed computerized air and equipment
monitoring systems and above-ground, high-power water pumps and
revised ventilation practices in all its mines. Its 650 employees
also are required to undergo annual hands-on training with
breathing apparatus, Harvey said.
   MSHA also analyzed two-entry longwall mining and ventilation
systems and is using the results to revise federal regulations,
Snyder said.
   But for his opposition to the two-entry longwall system now in
place in all Utah Power's coal mines, Boyle commends the utility's
innovations and its willingness to work with the union.
   ``Everybody that works up there lost somebody in that fire that
was a good friend or a partner,'' he said. ``The consequence of
what can happen becomes a vivid reality. And that changes people's
attitudes.''

<TEXT>
   Lee Van Cleef, the hawk-faced actor whose
first movie gunbattle was opposite Gary Cooper in the classic
Western ``High Noon,'' has died at age 64.
   Van Cleef collapsed at his Oxnard home late Friday, said Craig
Stevens, a Ventura County deputy coroner.
   Van Cleef's wife, Barbara, called paramedics. He was pronounced
dead early Saturday at St. John's Regional Medical Center in
Oxnard, a scenic coastal community 60 miles north of Los Angeles.
   The actor had a history of heart disease and had a pacemaker
implant, Stevens said.
   Born Jan. 9, 1925 in Somerville, N.J., Van Cleef dropped out of
high school to serve on submarine chasers and mine sweepers in the
Navy.
   After his discharge in 1946, he worked as a farmer, gas station
attendant, painter and accountant before taking his first stage
role. Later, he won a place in the road company of the play, ``Mr.
Roberts.''
   Van Cleef's film break came when he was cast as steely-eyed Jack
Colby, one of four desperadoes faced down by Cooper in the 1952
movie ``High Noon'' that also starred Grace Kelly. He later became
a familiar gunslinger in so-called spaghetti Westerns made by
Italian director Sergio Leone, including ``The Good, the Bad and
the Ugly.''
   His agent, Tom Jennings, said Van Cleef never became a film idol
because he abandoned Hollywood for Europe.
   ``I think he could have beena greater movie star, as big as
Charles Bronson or Clint Eastwood, had he come back from Europe
sooner than he did. But he liked working abroad,'' said Jennings.
   ``He wasn't the ambitious killer-type star, always going after
the gold ring. He did his own thing.''

<TEXT>
   Arnold Moss, an acclaimed classical actor who
also headed a Shakespearean company, portrayed movie villains and
played the voice of God in an opera, has died at age 80.
   He died Friday of lung cancer in his Manhattan home.
   Moss was praised by critics for his performances as Prospero in
``The Tempest'' in 1945 and as Malvolio in ``Twelfth Night'' in
1949. He formed his own repertory company, the Shakespeare Festival
Players and toured 50 American colleges.
   In movies, he often played the heavy and appeared in ``Viva
Zapata,'' ``Salome,'' ``Kim,'' ``Gambit,'' ``Casanova's Big Night''
and ``My Favorite Spy.''
   Moss narrated with the Boston, Detroit and Milwaukee orchestras
and provided the voice of God for the 1978 Chicago Lyric Opera
Company production of ``Paradise Lost,'' doubling as poet John
Milton.
   He began his stage career as actor-director at Eva LeGallienne's
Civic Repertory Theatre in New York.
   The ruthless Spanish colonel in Ernest Hemingway's ``The Fifth
Column'' was his first major Broadway role, and Moss went on to win
approval for his parts in ``The Front Page,'' ``Flight to the
West,'' and ``Journey to Jerusalem.''
   Moss performed on radio, too, in soap operas, as a spokesman for
the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and as a staff announcer for
CBS Radio in New York.
   The State Department sent him to Latin America, Africa and the
Far East as a specialist in theater.
   Surivors include his wife, Stella; his daughter, Andrea, of
Croton-on-Hudson; and his son, Jeffrey, of Manhattan.

<TEXT>
   China and the United States said today they have
opened talks on resuming the Fulbright scholar exchange program, a
victim of the chill in relations after China's crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   China's State Education Commission and the U.S. Embassy said
their representatives met for the first time last week _ just days
after U.S. National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft's
fence-mending visit to Beijing.
   Neither side linked the talks to Scowcroft's visit, but embassy
spokesman Ed Loo acknowledged, ``There wasn't much going on
before.''
   He said the United States had been seeking a renewal of the
government-sponsored Fulbright program ``for some time.''
   China announced this fall that it was halting the program for a
year, apparently because of anger over U.S. condemnation of its
June army attack on students protesting for democratic reform. It
also canceled plans to accept Peace Corps volunteers.
   In other signs of a warming between the two countries since
Scowcroft visited with Undersecretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger, China has indicated it is open to a negotiated
settlement for Fang Lizhi, the Chinese dissident who took refuge in
the U.S. Embassy.
   It has also said it will allow the U.S. government radio
station, the Voice of America, to send a new bureau chief to
Beijing. China expelled the former bureau chief, Al Pessin, in
June, accusing him of distorting facts and violating martial law
imposed during the protests.
   Reception of VOA Chinese-language broadcasts also has become
much clearer in the past week, although it is not clear if the
Chinese have halted all jamming. English-language broadcasts have
not been jammed.
   An official in the International Department of the State
Education Commission, who did not give his name, said China has not
yet decided if it will resume Fulbright exchanges. He refused to
say if China wants to change the terms of the program.
   ``We are talking about both sides' plans and conceptions,'' he
said. ``We originally halted it for a year, 1989 to 1990. Now we
are talking about restoring it for 1990-91.''
   Under the program, which exchanges American and foreign scholars
worldwide, two dozen American scholars lecture at Chinese
universities and a dozen Chinese scholars and a dozen students
visit the United States for research and studies. China has taken
part in the Fulbright program since shortly after U.S.-Chinese
relations were established in 1979.
   Scowcroft's visit has been criticized by some congressmen and
commentators in the United States as coming too soon after China's
bloody crackdown, in which hundreds of unarmed civilians were
killed.
   The Bush administration had halted all high-level visits in June
and imposed several other sanctions, including halting military
sales.
   However, it vetoed legislation that would have expanded the
sanctions and required the president to report to Congress before
lifting them. The administration has argued that Bush's softer
approach and his sending of Scowcroft will encourage China to
improve its human rights performance.

<HEAD>New Drilling Technology Inspires Dreams of Oil Boom</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIG WELLS, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For most of the decade this corner of
south Texas suffered the double whammy of drought and the oil bust.
But a new drilling technology has pumped up hopes of a new boomtime.
   The technology involves horizontal drilling, which industry
observers say might make billions of barrels of additional oil
reserves economical to bring to the surface.
   ``It's like a prairie fire. It will expand through our industry.
It's very exciting,'' said Philip Crouse, who heads a consulting
company in Dallas.
   The promise of the technology can be seen in the south Texas
fields, which are filled with rig after rig.
   ``Oryx, Oryx, Majestic, Weber, Oryx. ... That's nine you can
count from right here. It's unbelievable,'' said petroleum engineer
Ed Riddle, listing the rigs by their company name.
   A quarter-mile away is the Leta Glasscock No. 10, which some
call the hottest oil well in Texas. It is said to have a potential
of 5,470 barrels per day.
   Even at its current allowable rate of 1,312 barrels per day, the
well would increase daily oil production for all of Zavala County
by about two-thirds over last year.
   ``I never thought I'd see flow rates like this domestically. For
this, I thought I'd have to go to the Middle East,'' said Riddle,
who works for Charlie Winn, the owner of Glasscock wells No. 10 and
No. 12.
   This region is known as the Pearsall Field, part of a geological
formation that runs northeast from above Laredo past Austin.
   Characterized by numerous small oil reservoirs that run
vertically, the Pearsall Field enjoyed its last heyday almost a
decade ago. More recently, it was considered to be played out.
   But in the last few months, the newly refined technique of
horizontal drilling has hit it big again.
   Shallow depleted oil reservoirs are prime targets for horizontal
drilling, which was updated in recent years to become more
efficient.
   The technique involves drilling vertically for about 1,000 feet
and then placing horizontal drills into oil reservoirs. It works on
shallow reservoirs that have little subterranean pressure left.
   ``That was a dead field, now it's considered the best prospect
in the Lower 48,'' said Bill Fuqua, president of Dallas-based Basin
Resources, which is investing heavily in the Pearsall Field.
   In all of last year, the Texas Railroad Commission issued 61
drilling permits for the field; in the first 11 months of this
year, the commission issued 175 permits.
   ``Prior to April or May, you could have bought all the leases in
this county for $30 to $50 an acre. All you wanted. Now, if there
is any open, it would go as high as $300, and the only thing left
is small tracts or town lots in Dilley,'' said Frio County Clerk
Mona Hoyle, who has leased 240 acres of her own property.
   In Dilley, drilling rigs are working north and south of town of
2,500 residents about 70 miles south of San Antonio. For the first
time, leases are being sold on city lots.
   Even local government is getting into the game. Two weeks ago,
the Dilley City Council voted to take lease bids on the city park
and the city airport, following the example of the Dilley school
district.
   Crouse says this is only the beginning.
   ``Early estimates say that probably 200 wells will be drilled
horizontally for the year, but I think that is a low estimate,'' he
said.

<DATELINE>EBENSBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suspended judge says he'll fight his
bribery and corruption convictions for seeking money from an
employee, an attorney and a bank in the course of official business.
   Former Cambria County Judge Joseph K. O'Kicki said he would
appeal Saturday night's jury verdict: ``I expect eventually the
justice system will allow truth to prevail.''
   Prosecutors alleged that greed motivated the 59-year-old judge
to rule like a monarch in the elegant 19th century courthouse in
the foothills of the southern Allegheny Mountains.
   He was convicted of bribery in asking for $500 from a court
employee for a job promotion never given, for demanding a favorable
loan from a bank with a guardianship case before him and for asking
an attorney for a ``commission'' after a generous award to the
lawyer's clients. He also was found guilty of official oppression,
a general charge incorporating elements of the other alleged
violations.
   O'Kicki was acquitted of open lewdness for allegedly calling two
former secretaries into his office while wearing only his underwear.
   He also was acquitted on a charge that he bribed a Johnstown
strip mining company, gave an unemployed coal miner inside
information in a money-making scheme and used court employees to do
personal chores for him.
   O'Kicki could be sentenced to a maximum of 26 years in prison
and fined $57,500. A sentencing hearing has yet to be scheduled.
   He will lose his job, $80,000 salary and pension upon
sentencing, the prosecutor said.
   Jurors returned the verdict after 16{ hours of deliberations
over two days, following a seven-week trial in Northampton County
Court.
   Defense attorney Richard Galloway argued for a mistrial because
one juror appeared to disagree with the others when they were asked
to stand individually and give their verdict on each count. But
Judge Richard Grifo denied the motion, saying he hadn't heard any
disagreement, and the Galloway promised to appeal.
   As the jury was polled, James C. Miller appeared to say, ``Not
guilty'' three times on the six guilty counts. He also apparently
replied ``guilty'' to one of the counts of which O'Kicki was found
innocent.
   ``I think there's no question the verdict is non-unanimous and
can't stand,'' Galloway said.
   Reached by telephone, Miller said he agreed with the other
jurors.
   ``I absolutely did,'' he said.
   Jury foreman Francis A. Bazyk said the jurors had been unanimous
before going into the courtroom. ``He was just overcome by
nervousness,'' Bazyk said of Miller.
   O'Kicki faces 16 other charges in a second trial focusing on his
private business dealings. That trial hasn't been scheduled.
   In his testimony during the seven-week trial, O'Kicki said he
was joking with attorney Richard J. Green Jr. about the commission.
   The judge claimed he had been persecuted by the state after he
drew the ire of Johnstown millionaire W.E. Schonek, a political
power broker and Lt. Gov. Mark Singel's father-in-law.
   O'Kicki said the millionaire was angry at him for encouraging
Schonek's brother, Rudolph, to make a stock gift worth more than
$200,000 to St. Francis College in Loretto.
   Schonek and Singel denied any involvement with the investigation.
   O'Kicki, elected to the bench in 1971, was suspended by the
state Supreme Court in June 1988 and was indicted in March.

   The dollar was mostly lower in thin trading in
Europe late this morning, and dealers predicted it will move only
slightly throughout the day as most investors have concluded their
currency transactions for the year.
   Gold prices also fell.
   Traders said a year-end holiday spirit has settled over the
market, giving little incentive to take positions or launch new
initiatives.
   They cautioned that the market could be vulnerable to sharp
swings due to the thinness of trading, but they predicted most
major currencies would hold to narrow ranges before the end of the
year.
   ``We've pretty much finished any major movements,'' said one
trader in Milan, Italy.
   ``This is a classic year-end market. Just as the summer market
usually shows a stronger dollar, the winter market shows a weaker
dollar.''
   A dealer at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt agreed: ``Most of the
players closed their books Friday and have withdrawn from the
market. We are also effectively finished for the year. There is no
more interest; it is typical for Christmas.''
   In Toyko, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell slightly against the Japanese yen, closing at
144.22 yen, down 0.08 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at
144.26 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.7218 West German marks, down from 1.7225
   _1.5456 Swiss francs, down from 1.5485
   _5.8825 French francs, down from 5.8885
   _1.9415 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9480
   _1,285.50 Italian lire, down from 1,286.50
   _1.1609 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1606
   In London, the dollar rose marginally against the British pound.
It cost $1.6053 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6055 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $412.75 a troy ounce, up
from $412.25 bid late Friday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $411.65.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $410.70, down from $412.50 bid late
Friday.
   Gold in Hong Kong fell $2.10 to close at a bid $410.97.
   Silver slipped in London to a bid price of $5.61 a troy ounce
from Friday's $5.62.

   Relatives of the passengers who died in the
crash of Pan American Flight 103 gathered to support one another in
a season of painful reminders.
   ``I don't think for any of us Christmas will ever be the same,''
said Bert Ammerman, whose brother, Thomas, died on the flight.
Ammerman, of nearby River Vale, is the head of one group of
relatives, The Victims of Pan Am Flight 103.
   Surrounded by Christmas wreaths, Advent candles and a manger,
members of 22 families of the victims attended a service Sunday at
the Ramsey Presbyterian Church.
   The first anniversary of the crash is Thursday. On Dec. 21,
1988, a bomb blew the the Boeing 747 apart, killing 259 passengers
and crew. Another 11 people died on the ground in Lockerbie,
Scotland.
   Joan Dater, a member of the northern New Jersey congregation
whose daughter, Gretchen, died in the bombing, said she and her
family planned to spend Christmas together.
   ``It's painful because Gretchen won't be there, of course, but
Gretchen loved Christmas,'' Mrs. Dater said.
   She called the service a ``gift from the church.''
   The Rev. Robert A. Colman, minister at Ramsey First
Presbyterian, said the congregation wanted to mark the anniversary
of the bombing and discussed it with the Daters. ``We wanted to
keep it simple,'' he said.
   ``Blessed are those who mourn, for you shall be comforted,''
Colman told the congregation of about 70, which included the family
of a former church elder, James Fuller, who died on the flight.
   Colman urged the families to grieve and remember their relatives.
   The family of college student Alexia Tsairis has established a
foundation in her memory to promote conflict resolution.
   Her father, Peter Tsairis, said the family was talking with
Syracuse University, where she studied, to establish such a program.
   ``We need to stop terrorism, and the way to do that is through
education,'' he said.
   Peter Lowenstein, whose son Alexander died on the flight, said
he questioned why there were 168 empty seats on flight 103. He said
there was evidence some passengers had canceled their reservations
at the last minute and called for somebody to ``come forward and
tell us that actually occurred.''
   Ammerman said some relatives of the victims planned to attend a
public memorial service set for Thursday in Washington, while
others plan to go into seclusion.
   Mrs. Dater said another service was planned in Ramsey on
Thursday at the John Y. Dater Elementary school, named after
Gretchen Dater's great-grandfather.
   At 2:02 p.m., church bells in the community will ring for 270
seconds, she said.
   ``It's going to be a very difficult week,'' Ammerman said.

<HEAD>Report: Many Armed Forces Recruiters Use Fraud to Sell the Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military recruiters are resorting to
fraud as they try to meet quotas and sell the armed forces to a
shrinking pool of applicants, according to a published report.
   Interviews with former recruiters and documents and statistics
obtained through the Freedom of Information Act show that
recruiters are luring prospects with promises that cannot be kept,
The Hartford Courant reported Sunday.
   The recruiters enlisted unqualified recruits by helping them
fake educational credentials, cheat on aptitude tests and conceal
criminal records and medical problems that could otherwise
disqualify them, the newspaper said.
   Overall in the 1988 fiscal year, the Army, Navy, Air Force and
Marines investigated a total of 4,128 allegations of fraudulent
recruiting. The four services substantiated 701 of the allegations
and disciplined 992 recruiters _ about 7 percent of the total
recruiting force. There are slightly more than 14,000 recruiters,
according to figures supplied by the services.
   In addition to attracting recruits, the system is supposed to
screen applicants, requiring them to pass aptitude tests and
physical examinations and to undergo police checks.
   But one in seven recruits doesn't make it through the first year
of service and one in three never finishes the term of enlistment.
The cost to taxpayers is hundreds of millions of dollars each year,
the newspaper said.
   ``Every time we recruit somebody that doesn't make it through a
first term and we have to replace them, it costs us $18,000,'' said
Wayne S. Sellman, the civilian director of the Pentagon office
responsible for recruiting policy.
   More than 42,000 of the 294,000 volunteers recruited by the
Pentagon during 1988 were discharged before the end of their first
year. Using Sellman's $18,000 figure, the cost of replacing them
would be more than $750 million.

<HEAD>Michigan Congressman Calls for Drug Decriminalization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. George Crockett joined a small group of
public officials endorsing decriminalization of drugs, saying money
now being spent on enforcing drug laws should be shifted to social
programs.
   Federal drug czar William Bennett reacted angrily to the
suggestion, saying Crockett and the others are undermining the Bush
administration's anti-drug efforts.
   ``Decriminalization is the only solution,'' Crockett, D-Mich,
told The Detroit News in an interview published Sunday. ``Our
courts are burdened down with these drug cases and there is nothing
they can do about it. And here we are talking about spending
additional billions to build jails and prisons to send people to.''
   Money spent on enforcement should be shifted to job training for
the urban poor, education, health care and day care, said Crockett,
whose 13th District includes Detroit's economically depressed east
side.
   Crockett said he didn't have plans to immediately introduce
legislation decriminalizing drugs because Congress would reject
such a move.
   Last week, U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet of New York became
the first federal judge to publicly support decriminalization. Also
favoring decriminalization are Baltimore Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke and
economist Milton Friedman.
   Bennett, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
cursed when told of Crockett's position, the newspaper said.
   ``Here we go. We were wondering who was going to be the first''
in Congress to endorse decriminalization, Bennett said.
   Giving drugs the same legal status as alcohol could cause even
greater social and economic problems, Bennett said.
   ``Alcohol has done quite enough damage, thank you,'' he said.
``And if you want to see people using crack go from 1 (million) or
2 million to 10 million, make it as available as alcohol.''
   U.S. District Judge James Churchill, chief federal judge of
Michigan's Eastern District, said the idea at least should be
debated.
   ``Decriminalization is not a good answer,'' Churchill said.
``But it is an answer. ... What are we going to do once we get our
prisons full and we still have as many drug dealers on the street?''

   A man driving a stolen pickup truck
slammed into a farmer's market and killed two people who were
shopping for a Christmas tree, authorities said.
   Brake Wade, 15, of Collinsville was pronounced dead of internal
injuries at Anderson Hospital in Maryville shortly after the
accident Sunday evening, said Madison County Coroner Dallas Burke.
   Roland Cox, 37, of Pontoon Beach died in surgery several hours
later, Burke said.
   The 30-year-old driver, who was not injured, was being held in
the Collinsville City Jail pending felony charges of reckless
homicide and possession of a stolen vehicle, said David Niebur, the
city's police chief. Collinsville is in southwest Illinois.
   The driver's name was not immediately released. Police were
investigating whether alcohol was a factor in the accident. Niebur
said the pickup truck had been stolen earlier in the day from
nearby Belleville.

   It was colder in Oklahoma than in Alaska today as a deep chill
continued to grip most of the nation before winter's official
start. Snow and sleet pelted the Deep South and freezing
temperatures extended to the Gulf Coast.
   The cold snap has chilled much of nation for the past several
days, and forecasters said there was no end in sight.
   ``It might not be that unusual if it was the middle of January
... but everyone agrees this is indeed atypical,'' said weather
service meteorologist Edward Yandrich in New York. ``In layman's
terms, it's just been very, very cold.''
   Temperatures this morning were below zero in the Upper Plains,
in the teens in the Rockies and in the 20s along the Texas
Panhandle. At 3 a.m. EST it was 20 degrees in Oklahoma City and 27
and snowing in Anchorage, Alaska.
   Light snow fell Sunday afternoon in Houston, Texas, while parts
of upstate New York got 3-4 inches and snow fell in northern Maine,
the Upper Plains, parts of Iowa, Minnesota, the Dakotas and the
Rockies.
   Today, sleet or freezing rain fell in Atlanta, Charleston, S.C.,
and Macon, Ga., and snow was expected from northern Texas through
Alabama. That storm was expected to reach South Carolina late
today, and in the Washington, D.C., area by Tuesday night.
   Record low temperatures were recorded in many cities. Records
were set shortly after midnight today in Cleveland, at minus 3
degrees, and Columbus, Ohio, at minus 4; on Sunday, records fell in
at least 19 cities, including Elkins, W.Va., at minus 8, and
Paducah, Ky., and Indianapolis, minus 10.
   The National Weather Service warned of frost likely near San
Diego, Calif., tonight.
   High temperature for the Lower 48 states on Sunday was 80
degrees at Fort Myers, Fla., and Miami.

   For the first time in the 2-year-old
Palestinian uprising, police have charged journalists with entering
an area declared closed by the military, police said today.
   The charges were brought against three Israeli reporters, Joel
Greenberg of the English-language Jerusalem Post, Ori Nir of
Haaretz and Oren Cohen of Hadashot.
   Shaul Naim, police prosecutor, said the three would not be
jailed during legal proceedings but could be sentenced to up to two
years in prison if convicted of the charges. He said he was
uncertain when the trial would be held.
   The charges were presented Sunday before the Jerusalem
Magistrate's court, Naim said.
   During the uprising, soldiers have regularly blocked reporters
from entering troubled towns or villages by declaring them closed
military areas. While reporters have been detained several times
for entering such areas, no charges had been brought.
   Greenberg, Nir and Cohen were found by army troops in the West
Bank city of Nablus on Nov. 15, 1988, after the city of 120,000 had
been closed by the army.
   The incident occurred on the day that the PLO declared an
independent Palestinian state. To prevent trouble, the army put the
entire Gaza Strip under curfew and declared Nablus and several
other West Bank towns and villages closed areas.
   The Jerusalem Post quoted the charge sheet as saying the
journalists ``stayed for a long time inside Nablus after it was
declared a closed area ... although they heard at 7 a.m. on the
radio that the area was declared closed.''
   Greenberg claimed at the time that the three were unaware Nablus
had been closed when they entered the city.
   ``We didn't know it was a closed military area because we left
early in the morning and they didn't say anything about closure the
day before,'' he said.
   The three were detained by soldiers in Al-Ittihad Hospital, and
said they had remained there for fear of endangering themselves
after the closure order was announced.
   The Hebrew daily Hadashot, whose reporter Cohen was among those
accused, said in an editorial that the police charge ``is just
another, and exceptionally bitter, expression of the decline of our
democracy due to pressure from the uprising.''

   An air force helicopter crashed
today in bad weather on Borneo island, killing all 16 people aboard
including several senior officers, military officials said.
   The U.S.-made Sikorsky helicopter crashed in bad weather near
Lundu, 540 miles southwest of Kuala Lumpur, Royal Malaysian Air
Force spokesman Captain Roslan Salam said.
   The officers were on their way to monitor a military exercise
when the helicopter crashed.
   The victims included two top Kuching-based army generals, Maj.
Gen. Mustaffa Awang, 50, and Brig. Gen. Hasbullah Yusoff, 47, the
army said. Mustaffa was commander of Army Region Two and Hasbullah
was commander of the Third Infantry Brigade.
   Also dead were the commanding officer of the 13th Royal Malay
Regiment, Lt. Col. Tengku Abdul Aziz Tengku Osman; the commanding
officer of the 5th Malaysian Ranger Regiment, Lt. Col. Mohamad
Johari; the pilot, Capt. H.C. Koey; and an army photographer, Cpl.
Ramli Baharom, it said.
   The helicopter took off from Kuching Air Force base this morning
for Sematan, near the Indonesia-Malaysia border in Sarawak state on
Borneo island, Roslan said.
   A board of inquiry will be set up to determine the cause of the
crash, he said.
   The crash is the second in less than two months in Malaysia
involving a Sikorsky helicopter. On Nov. 9, a similar helicopter
with 21 people on board, mostly members of the 19th Battalion
Police Field Force, crashed near Gunung Gerah on the Kelantan-Perak
border, 210 miles north of Kuala Lumpur. All were killed.
   Malaysia bought 40 of the helicopters and the first was
delivered in 1968. Since then a total of six have crashed.

   Thousands of villagers in the hometown
of drug lord Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha turned out for his reburial,
after security forces killed him in a shootout and interred him in
an unmarked grave.
   Police units in the town of Pacho, 25 miles from Bogota,
remained on alert near the local cemetery during Sunday's funeral
and no incidents were reported.
   Authorities had stalked Rodriguez Gacha for months before
shooting and killing him, his 17-year-old son, Freddy, and five
bodyguards Friday in a gunfight near the Caribbean port of Covenas.
   Authorities used public funds to bury the seven late Saturday in
a common grave in Sincelejo, 320 miles north of Bogota.
   The bodies of father and son were claimed by family members
after being exhumed at their request. They were then flown to
Bogota in a private plane and driven to Pacho.
   They were placed in luxurious, wooden coffins reportedly paid
for by a brother of Rodriguez Gacha.
   Rodriguez Gacha, a 42-year-old billionaire, was the most
celebrated son of Pacho, hated or loved by most of its population
of 20,000. He lavishly provided residents with money, personal
favors and jobs, but demanded unquestioning cooperation in his drug
dealings.
   Sucre state Gov. Arturo Martinez said on Caracol radio network
that Freddy's mother claimed her son's body from the common grave.
He identified her as Luz Dari Celades, reportedly one of Rodriguez
Gacha's mistresses.
   Two of Rodriguez Gacha's brothers claimed the drug trafficker's
body, Martinez said. He did not give their names.
   The judge in charge of the burial, Bienvenido Zuniga, agreed to
open the common grave and give family members a chance to claim the
bodies. He told the El Espectador newspaper that the only request
for the bodies prior to the burial came from a funeral home in the
city of Medellin, the hub of the country's cocaine trade. He denied
that request, El Espectador said.
   Rodriguez Gacha, who had set up private armies to protect both
his cocaine business and his vast stretches of land in the country,
was initially buried in a wooden coffin at a cost of $700 in public
funds.
   With the killing, President Virgilio Barco's government appeared
strengthened in its anti-drug offensive. Critics had said Colombian
cocaine chiefs were impervious to attack.
   The government's success in tracking down Rodriguez Gacha drew
praise from Colombian newspapers, which a week ago suggested Barco
had all but lost his struggle against the traffickers.
   The administration has extradited 10 middle-level traffickers to
the United States as part of its crackdown, but had failed to track
down any of the 12 traffickers most wanted by U.S. authorities.
   Then came the raid on Rodriguez Gacha's hideout. Police said the
operation by more than 1,000 security force members, supported by
seven helicopters, was the result of weeks of intelligence work.
   Enrique Santos Calderon, a columnist for Bogota's leading daily,
El Tiempo, wrote that until Rodriguez Gacha's death ``the war
against the drug traffickers was viewed as going from bad to
worse.''
   ``All of this changed with the death of Rodriguez,'' Santos
wrote. ``The invulnerable image of the cartel chiefs has been
shattered, while that of the public's force has been strengthened.''

   Inner-city church and community activists are
offering a $10,000 reward for the names of gang members believed to
have put a $5,000 bounty on the head of an anti-drug activist.
   Georgette Watson, a founder of the Drop-A-Dime hotline for
fielding tips on drug pushers, has been under 24-hour police
protection since last week. Gang members also allegedly offered
$1,000 to anyone wounding the mother of three.
   ``We are extremely concerned about the threats made against the
life of Georgette Watson,'' said the Rev. E.W. Jackson, who joined
about 15 church and community leaders Sunday in asking citizens to
contribute to the reward.
   ``It shows the gangs are not the only ones who can put out
bounties,'' Deputy Police Superintendent William Celester said.
``The community now is fighting back. What (the gangs) have done is
wake up a sleeping giant that is going to step on them.''
   Celester insisted on round-the-clock protection for Watson after
detectives verified informant reports that Watson's life was at
risk through Jan. 1, the deadline allegedly set by gang members who
want her dead.

<HEAD>Random Drug Tests Begin Among 4 Million Transportation Workers</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts 2 grafs after 4th graf, Transportation Secretary, with

<TEXT>
   Four million transportation workers face the
prospect of being required to give urine samples on short notice as
random drug testing begins today.
   In some cases, computers are selecting pilots, flight attendants
and other employees to be tested. Rules in the airline industry
take effect first, with maritime, railroad, trucking, transit and
pipeline companies to follow over the next several weeks.
   Some airlines indicate they will delay random testing until
early next year, but others say employees could be subject to
unannounced tests beginning today for marijuana, cocaine, opiates,
amphetamines and phencyclidine, also known as PCP.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, who is considering the
addition of testing for alcohol, has said he expects the drug tests
to uncover ``alarming'' drug use by people responsible for
travelers' safety.
   ``If the results that we've received with the military over the
last five years are any indication, we'll be able to reduce drug
usage, if in fact it occurs, as much as 80 percent,'' Skinner said
today on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' program.
   He said the military began random drug testing five years ago,
``and usage was about 10 percent across the board in the military,
and it's down now to less than 2 percent.''
   But employee groups, noting that 25,000 random tests on
Transportation Department employees resulted in a minuscule number
of positive results _ about 0.5 percent _ say the random testing is
a waste of time and money and an intrusion. The rules also require
pre-employment, post-accident, reasonable cause and periodic tests.
   ``We expect full compliance, even though we still very much
disagree with the concept of random testing,'' said John Mazor,
spokesman for the 40,000-member Air Line Pilots Association, which
has filed one of more than 20 lawsuits against the new rules.
   The Federal Aviation Administration denied a pilots' petition to
delay implementation of the testing. A federal court in San
Francisco refused a move for an injunction but has not yet ruled on
the testing.
   Skinner said government enforcers will not be out in the initial
stages of the testing, but all transportation companies are
expected to set up programs. Companies with fewer than 50 employees
have an extra year to comply.
   Testing in aviation will include pilots, flight engineers,
flight navigators, aircraft dispatchers, mechanics, repairmen,
flight attendants, aviation security screeners, ground security
coordinators, controllers and ground instructors. Private and
corporate pilots are not included, although pilots who fly
commercial crop dusting planes, tow banners or conduct training
flights are.
   Transportation Department officials eventually expect half of
the work force in safety-related transportation jobs to be tested
each year.
   Testing rules for mariners, truckers, and transit workers go
into effect on Thursday, for railroad employees on Jan. 16 and for
pipeline workers on April 20.
   Congress also is considering whether to enact legislation
requiring drug and alcohol testing for transportation workers. But
the department is starting the program without legislation.
   The National Transportation Safety Board earlier this month
criticized the department's post-accident testing rules, calling
for uniform rules for all types of transportation. The board said
the testing should also cover alcohol and require both urine and
blood tests within four hours after any accident or serious
incident.
   Department rules require that tests be performed by outside
laboratories certified by the Department of Health and Human
Services and that companies follow stringent procedures for
collecting urine samples and preventing access to them prior to
testing.
   Samples are tested twice. Those that test positive in an initial
screening are scanned with what the department calls ``a virtually
error-free gas chromotography and mass spectrometry confirmatory
test.''
   Positive results are sent to a medical review officer who must
discuss the results with the employee to determine whether there
might be a legitimate explanation for the result.
   Jeff Kriendler, spokesman for Pan American, said the airline
would begin the drug testing program today at all of its U.S.
stations. Employees in safety-related jobs as well as their
supervisors would be included, he said.
   Trans World Airlines' Jim Faulkner said about 17,000 of TWA's
31,000 employees would be subjected to possible random testing, to
begin Jan. 15 under an FAA waiver.
   David Messing of Continental said random testing would begin
Jan. 1.
   United's Sara Dornacker said testing of pilots is to begin Jan.
2 and other employees Jan. 12.
   Jim Lundy, spokesman for Delta, said the airline's testing plan
was sent back by the FAA for some minor adjustments and is awaiting
final approval.

<HEAD>Debate Resumes On Market System As Economic Shock Treatment</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 4 grafs to UPDATE with Parliament debate resuming
today, PAP reax on Sunday debate. Picks up 3rd graf `The Warsaw Pact...'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Parliament today debated on a wide-ranging
package to transform the state-run economy to a market system,
taking up first the government budget that cuts off public
subsidies for most goods and services.
   The deputies in the Sejm, the lower house of Parliament, met for
12 hours Sunday and returned to work this morning, with a further
session planned Tuesday and possibly Wednesday.
   The reform package proposed by the Solidarity-led government
will be the most radical economic reform ever attempted in the East
bloc _ and massive unemployment and steep price increases are
initially expected as state subsidies to industry end, forcing
unprofitable enterprises to close.
   Summing up the first phase of debate, the official PAP news
agency commented: ``Concern voiced in each of over 100 questions
asked the government can be boiled down to one question: How will
individual citizens, families, social and professional groups and
economic units `survive' the period of changes?''
   The Warsaw Pact country whose people led the way in forcing an
end to four decades of Communist domination now faces the daunting
task of rebuilding a wrecked economy from the ground up.
   Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz announced the program to a
special Sunday session of the Sejm, asking that it be approved in
time to be implemented Jan. 1.
   He said Poland must leave behind a system ``based on
19th-century doctrines'' and embrace one ``based on market
mechanisms ... where skills, knowledge, able hands, talent and
willingness to work all count.''
   Balcerowicz, who is also deputy prime minister, said the new
course would ``open new perspectives of proper living, free
development and fruitful and satisfying work.''
   It will be the biggest test of public support to date for a
government formed in September after Solidarity-backed candidates
trounced Communists in spring elections.
   The plan, backed by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, is expected
to meet some opposition from Communist lawmakers and some in the
Solidarity bloc, whose industrial worker constituency will be hard
hit.
   With Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the East bloc's first
non-Communist head of government, somberly looking on, Balcerowicz
outlined a virtual dismantling 45 years of Marxist-Leninist
economic policy.
   The plan includes:
   _Instantly balancing the deficit-ridden state budget through
strict austerity.
   _Cutting off most state subsidies to businesses and
institutions, including the Communist Party.
   _Freeing prices.
   _Limiting wage increases.
   _Turning the zloty into a convertible currency, probably in
January or February.
   _Attacking monopolies and beginning an orderly selloff of state
industries to the private sector, probably in phases next year.
   _Reforming the banking and tax systems.
   _Establishing a social safety net for the poor and jobless,
whose ranks are expected to swell as a result of the new measures.
   Referring to the drop in output and inflation of 900 percent
that have rocked the Polish economy this year, Balcerowicz conceded
Poland is launching its reform in ``extremely unfavorable
conditions.''
   The program meets requirements laid down by the International
Monetary Fund, which demanded fundamental reforms before it would
authorize any loans to Poland.
   IMF head Michel Camdessus has said a letter of intent for a $700
million standby loan agreement with Poland will be signed in the
near future.
   That, in turn, will open the way to up to $3.5 billion in
additional loans and liberal rescheduling of Poland's $40 billion
foreign debt by Western nations, which have lined up in recent
months to back Poland in its turn toward democracy.
   Public support of Mazowiecki's government has allowed him to ask
the public to make public sacrifices that would have provoked
massive unrest under the Communists.
   Under the plan, subsidies for goods and services, which last
year ate up 31 percent of public spending, will be reduced to 14
percent. Subsidies will remain, at lower levels, in only a few
areas: for housing, public transport, coal, bread and low-fat milk
and cheese.
   Price increases in the range of 25 percent to 50 percent a month
are expected in the first stage of the program, as enterprises lose
their subsidies and raise prices to survive.
   Coal and energy prices alone are expected to up to sevenfold and
enough companies will be forced to cease operating that the economy
of this country of 38 million people may face an army of 400,000
unemployed, officials have said.
   The price increases and the limits on government spending and
wage increases will cut real incomes by 20 percent next year, with
a projected 5 percent decrease in industrial output and a 2 percent
to 3 percent dropoff in the gross national product.
   But the government-induced recession should squeeze inflation
down to a few percent a month by mid-1990, planners say.
   ``All the vested interests are against (the plan),'' Foreign
Trade Minister Marcin Swiecicki, one of four Communists in the
government, said after Balcerowicz's speech. ``But it will get
through.''
   In one provision that strikes at the old power structure,
political and social organizations like the Communist Party _ which
previously got billions of zlotys from the state Treasury _ will no
longer receive public funds and will be forced to rely on their
supporters and enterprise to raise money.
   But the most sensitive aspect of the program is whether the
public at large, already struggling after a decade of inflation,
lack of consumer goods, stagnant growth and failed reform programs,
can survive a new bout of price increases coupled with the new
threat of poverty and joblessless.
   The finance minister emphasized that the government would be
providing inflation-indexed aid to the weakest members of society:
retirees, the disabled, low-income families and displaced workers.
   ``Nobody should feel his existence is endangered,'' Balcerowicz
said.

   A sky diver making an illegal jump from a

slammed him into the building, police and a friend say.
   Richard Allen Pedley, 57, of Walnut, fell 12 to 15 stories early
Sunday, landing on another structure, police said. He died at a
hospital.
   Pedley was with three to five other parachutists who jumped from
the unfinished, 40-story building. The others landed safely and
fled before police arrived, police said.
   Pedley had parachuted many times from aircraft but had little
experience jumping from fixed objects, said Jean K. Boenish,
executive director of a skydiving group and a friend of Pedley's.
   She said his chute opened backwards and swung him into the
building at least three times.

   East German Communists and opposition
factions today resumed talks on the nation's future over the din of
hundreds of protesters who banged on windows and demanded a part in
the negotiations.
   The forum brought together various political parties, social
organizations and fledgling pro-democracy movements into a council
of more than 40 that is to advise the interim government until free
elections in May.
   After two hours of debate, participants decided to allow five
more groups, including the official trade union federation, to take
part in the talks and granted observer status to four more.
   The negotiators agreed to meet each Monday to propose
legislation and proposed that future discussions be carried live on
television and radio.
   Hundreds of angry demonstrators disrupted the first hour of the
session, using bullhorns to shout their demands to be included and
banging on windows of the ground-floor conference room of the
Lutheran Church building where the talks were held.
   ``Anyone who tries to force his participation in this way is not
acting in the interests of democracy,'' President Manfred Gerlach
said as the noise overwhelmed speakers.
   The participants proposed a message of solidarity to Premier
Hans Modrow and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who meet
Tuesday in Dresden.
   They said the German-German summit expresses the will of both
nations to improve relations, but they warned against any moves
that would damage the sovereignty of either state _ a call to leave
the reunification issue off the agenda.
   The meeting comes a day after the Communist Party concluded an
emergency congress in which it embraced a multiparty system and
changed its name to the Socialist Unity Party of Germany-Party of
Democratic Socialism.
   The long title reflects both a new orientation to democratic
principles and an eagerness to divorce itself from the corruption
and power abuses that tainted former Communist leaders ousted in a
pro-democracy movement that began in September.
   New Communist Party leader Gregor Gysi and Wolfgang Berghofer,
his chief deputy, opened the talks Dec. 7.
   At that session, May 6 was set as the date for the first-ever
competitive elections to seat a new Parliament, kicking off a
volatile campaign season likely to result in a minority role for
the Communists.
   The talks have spurred the discredited Communists to consult
with their broadening opposition on how to run the country until
elections are held.
   In his address Sunday to the congress' final session, Gysi set
out a new course for the party that breaks with four decades of
Stalinism.
   Nearly 2,700 delegates unanimously approved the draft of a new
statute, to serve as the party rulebook until its next regular
congress, as well as the outlines of a new program.
   The Communists were stripped of their constitutional mandate to
rule during a parliamentary session Dec. 1. It reduced their status
to that of any other political force, though the premier and much
of his Cabinet are Communist.
   When a new Parliament is seated after elections, it in turn will
name a new government.
   The Communists polled only 12 percent support in a public
opinion survey conducted by major West German pollsters in early
December, and Modrow himself has predicted his party could win no
more than 20 percent of the vote if elections were held now.
   Two other political conventions were held over the weekend, by
the small Christian Democratic Union of East Germany that is aiming
to win votes from the religious population, and by the opposition
group Democratic Awakening.
   Despite the Communists' opposition to reunification, the theme
has taken hold among some political groups.
   Delegates at the founding party congress of Democratic Awakening
in Leipzig voted 350-35 with 21 abstentions that the right of
German unity should be inscribed in the East German constitution.
   The Christian Democratic Union's leader, Lothar de Maiziere,
told delegates he could envisage a single German state within a
united Europe.

<HEAD>Water Restrictions Start in South Florida</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Water restrictions prompted by
South Florida's worst drought in 27 years took effect today,
forcing the shutoff of decorative fountains and raising the
prospect of brown golf courses and dirty cars.
   About 4 million people from the Florida Keys to the
sprinkler-equipped estates of Palm Beach, more than 200 miles to
the north, must reduce water consumption 15 percent under the first
regional restrictions in nine years.
   The rules were adopted Thursday by the South Florida Water
Management District. Violators can be fined $25.
   Environmentalists charge the Everglades are being shortchanged,
and golf course operators worry that the winter tourist season may
wither along with their greens. Golf is a $5 billion-a-year
business in Florida.
   ``The aesthetics are going to suffer,'' said Steve Kuhn, greens
superintendent at Miami's famous Doral Country Club. ``Things won't
be as lush.''
   Lawn watering and car washing are permitted only between 4 a.m.
and 8 a.m., three days a week, on alternating days according to
whether the house is odd- or even-numbered. No outdoor water use is
allowed on Fridays.
   Golf-course watering, pool filling and washing of boats, streets
and walks have been restricted or banned. Fountains have been
ordered shut off.
   South Florida is in its worst dry spell since 1962. Some areas
have gotten 33 inches less rain than normal during the past 14
months, and the area is heading into the dry season, which runs
through May.
   Environmentalists complained that 6.1 billion gallons of
Everglades water had been diverted in November for drinking and
farming. ``In times of water shortage, wildlife interests suffer
first and benefit last,'' said Paul Parks of the Florida Wildlife
Federation.
   District officials say golf courses are among the biggest water
users, consuming 250,000 to 1 million gallons a night. An average
household uses about 250 gallons a day.

   Hundreds of students hurling firebombs
and rocks fought riot police in Seoul and two other cities today to
protest the arrest of a fugitive radical student leader.
   Fierce fighting broke out on the streets around campuses after
Im Chong-suk, 23, and five student bodyguards were overpowered and
arrested by 20 plainclothes police at a Seoul university earlier in
the day.
   Police said there had been arrests in the clashes but had no
figures. At least one student suffered serious burns in a clash at
Seoul's Hanyang University and was hospitalized.
   Im has been on the police wanted list since March with a reward
equivalent to $7,400 offered for information leading to his arrest.
He is head of the outlawed National Council of Student
Representatives, or Chondaehyop.
   Police said Im would be charged with violations of the National
Security Law governing sedition and communist activity. Im told
reporters at police headquarters he had planned to discuss Korean
unification in a scheduled television interview when he was
apprehended. The interview was not held.
   The most serious fighting of the day was reported in the
southern city of Kwangju, where about 800 students, hurling
hundreds of firebombs, battled police for two hours around Chosun
University.
   ``Release Im Chong-suk!'' the state television, KBS, quoted
students as shouting as they charged about 1,000 riot police.
   KBS showed scenes of columns of protesters with masks and
hankerchiefs over their faces attacking police, who fired tear gas.
   The tear gas drifted onto the Kwangju campuses of four middle
and high schools in the area, forcing them to temporarily suspend
classes, KBS said.
   About 400 students fought riot police with firebombs and rocks
for an hour in front of the main gates of Hanyang University, where
Im is a senior. Police hurled rocks back at the students.
   In the southern port city of Pusan, groups of up to 20 students
stormed six regional offices of an opposition party, demanding Im's
release and protesting a compromise Saturday between ruling and
opposition parties aimed at ending the long dispute over corruption
and misdeeds under former President Chun Doo-hwan. Students want
Chun arrested and punished.
   Meanwhile, police detained about 120 students who staged street
demonstrations near a courthouse where a woman student and a
Catholic priest are on trial for making illegal trips to Communist
North Korea.
   ``Free the flower of unification!'' and ``Abolish national
security laws!'' the students shouted as they were loaded into
police buses. Most were released later with warnings, police said.
   Inside the courtroom, Im Su-kyong, 20, was in the fourth day of
her trial on charges of violating the National Security Law for
visiting North Korea without government authorization.
   The two Ims are unrelated.

<HEAD>EC Says No to Turkish Membership</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community's executive body
today said Turkey should not be allowed to join the trading bloc in
the near future, saying it must improve its economy and human
rights record.
   ``It is impossible to begin immediate (membership)
negotiations,'' with Turkey, said Abel Matutes, the EC's
commissioner for Mediterranean policy. Negotiations could not begin
before 1993, he added.
   But the Commission recommended strengthening cooperation between
the 12-nation trade bloc and Turkey in the next few years to pave
the way for eventual membership.
   The EC's executive body has been considering the economic and
political implications of Turkish membership since Ankara
officially applied to join the Community on April 14, 1987.
   Under EC rules, the commission must give its opinion on
membership applications, but a final decision is up to the 12
member states' governments and the European Parliament. At any
rate, no new members can join until 1993 when the EC should have a
Single Market.
   Austria is the only other country to have made an official
membership request.
   Matutes said today's decision did not question ``the principle
of Turkey's eligibility for membership of the Community,'' sometime
in the future.
   He said the Commission reached its decision after an exhaustive
survey of Turkey's economic and political situation, undertaken
with the help of the Turkish government.
   He said the Commission had also looked at the effects of Turkish
membership in the context of developments within the EC, which is
working to abolish its internal barriers to the free movement of
trade, services, capital and people by the end of 1992 _ the
so-called Single Market.
   ``Between now and 1993 we must concentrate all our efforts on
achieving the Single Market,'' Matutes said.
   Although the Turkish economy had made ``really remarkable and
encouraging progress ... there are still disparities and problems
which we cannot ignore,'' he said.
   The commissioner said that on average Turkish economic
development was only one-third of the EC average.
   ``Unemployment is high, ... social security is low and is far
from the norms current in the Community. Inflation remains a sharp
problem,'' he said.
   Although Turkey is a parliamentary democracy, Matutes said,
there are still areas ``notably in the trade unions sector, human
rights and respect for minorities,'' where ``progress is
necessary.''
   Turkey was under military rule from 1980 to 1983.
   In addition to the human rights and trade unions problems,
Matutes said the Commission was concerned about Turkey's
relationship with Greece.
   The two Mediterranean neighbors have long been at odds over
Cyprus and mineral rights in the Aegean Sea. They almost went to
war over the latter issue in early 1987.
   Greece said it would oppose Turkish membership in the trading
bloc for as long as Turkey maintained 30,000 troops on Cyprus.
Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974, saying it had to protect the
island's Turkish Cypriot minority after a coup by pro-Greek
elements.

   Communist Party chief Karel
Urbanek said his party probably will try to form a coalition with
other parties before free elections planned next year, an official
newspaper reported today.
   The state news agency CTK said Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier
would begin negotiations in Moscow on the possible withdrawal from
Czechoslovakia of about 80,000 Soviet troops. The soldiers were
installed here after the Soviet-led invasion that crushed a 1968
reform movement.
   And the Communist Party daily Rude Pravo today printed an
extraordinary front-page apology ``to all those who were hurt'' by
its articles in the past.
   Previous articles that attacked Vaclav Havel, Alexander Dubcek
and other proponents of democracy ``did not reflect positions of
the majority of the paper's editors,'' said the newspaper's new
editor, Zdenek Porybny.
   On Sunday, about 100,000 marchers in Prague commemorated the
one-month anniversary of their peaceful revolution, which has
toppled hard-line Communist leaders and has forced the Communists
to surrender their monopoly on power, open borders and promise free
elections.
   The marchers also chanted their support for the election of
Havel as president.
   Urbanek was quoted in Rude Pravo as saying the party must renew
itself to survive and be open to a possible coalition with other
leftist parties.
   ``It is more than probable already now that the Communist Party
should go into the (free) elections in a coalition with other
leftist parties which already exist, as well as those to be
established in the future,'' he said.
   Officials have said free elections could be held in June or
July. They would be the nation's first in 43 years.
   Urbanek did not specify which parties the Communists might try
to work with, but he likely meant the Socialist and Peoples'
parties, which have traditionally been allied with the Communists
but have recently exerted more independence.
   A main item on the agenda of an extraordinary party congress
later this week is ``to use the richness of ideas from 1968 ...
while cleansing the party on all levels,'' Urbanek said.
   Premier Marian Calfa and Dienstbier are scheduled to visit
Moscow on Wednesday to discuss the withdrawal of Soviet troops and
closer economic cooperation between Prague and the Kremlin,
government spokesman Marcel Jansen said.
   The visit was at the invitation of Soviet Premier Nikolai
Ryzhkov, Jansen said.
   A meeting between Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
and Dienstbier also is possible, ministry spokesman Vlastimil Samek
said.
   Dienstbier and other Czechoslovak officials say the agreement
allowing Soviet troops to stay after crushing the 1968 ``Prague
Spring'' reforms was made under pressure. However, government
officials say any troop cuts should run parallel with superpower
disarmament talks in Vienna.
   The latest Communists to be purged from the party in the
shake-up were Slovak Communist Party boss Ignac Janak and six other
officials, whose memberships were suspended Sunday during a Slovak
Party Congress in Bratislava.
   Janak was expelled from the Czechoslovak Communist Party's
Politburo last week.
   Sunday was the anniversary of the Nov. 17 police crackdown on
peaceful student protesters in the capital that proved the spark
for the popular revolt that has forced an end to 41 years of
Communist domination.
   Havel, a playwright and former political prisoner, has emerged
as the main contender for the presidency.
   The November crackdown galvanized Czechoslovaks, who began
pouring into the streets by the hundreds of thousands to demand an
end to authoritarian one-party rule.
   Mass protests brought the resignation of hard-line leaders,
including president Gustav Husak, and lead to the creation of the
country's first non-Communist government since 1948.
   Participants in Sunday's march carried candles and held banners
that proclaimed ``Havel for President.'' They chanted ``Long Live
Havel!''
   The students retraced the three-mile path of the Nov. 17
protest, walking up to Prague's Vysehrad Cemetery and cathedral and
winding through Prague's historic streets for a rally at Wenceslas
Square.
   The marchers paused for a moment of silence and to light candles
at the site of the violent police charges against them in November.
   The flag-waving marchers were greeted with cheers and applause
by bystanders.
   ``We are just so grateful to the students for what they did to
bring about this change,'' said an elderly woman who asked not to
be identified. ``It's such a terrible shame that our generation was
not able to do the same thing.''
   Havel, in a televised speech Saturday night, said: ``We are all
grateful to the students for having given the revolution its
beautiful, dignified, peaceful ... and affectionate face that is
now admired by the whole world.''
   Under an agreement worked out last week between the Communists
and the opposition, Parliament will elect a president who is not
affiliated with any party and is a Czech.
   That appeared to clear the way for the candidacy of Havel.
   Dubcek, leader of the crushed ``Prague Spring'' reforms, also
has been mentioned as a presidential candidate.

<HEAD>Perfume Helps Cows Get Along Better, Produce More Milk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLASSEE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists looking into ways of boosting
milk production have discovered the sweet smell of success in anise
oil.
   Dairy cows got along better when sprayed with the
licorice-scented fragrance, and when cows feel at ease, they give
more milk, say researchers Keith Cummins and Lawrence Myers of
Auburn University.
   ``Most people seem to find a little bit of humor in it,''
Cummins said last week. ``I try to emphasize that this has a
serious application, but it makes me smile, too.''
   Cummins said dairy cows must be regrouped every two to four
weeks to maximize production and feed efficiency, forcing the
animals to re-establish their ``pecking order.'' That results in
biting, pushing and shoving. Cows become nervous and upset, and
milk production drops.
   The loss for a 500-cow dairy could amount to 500 to 700 pounds
of milk a month or more, Cummins said. ``At $14 per 100 pounds, it
adds up,'' he added.
   Anise spray reduces aggression among cows, Cummins said. As the
smell wears off _ usually about the third day _ the pecking order
is already being established.
   Does that mean cows like perfume?
   ``It wasn't because the sprayed cows smelled good,'' Cummins
said. ``What we did was make it so the cows couldn't tell one from
the other.''
   Cummins said research in animal behavior is becoming more
important because of the animal rights issue.
   ``Intensive farming methods are being challenged as to whether
they are humane or not,'' he said. ``So we have to do more research
to make these cows as happy and contented as possible.''

   Rumors are circulating in Washington that
Colombian drug lords have put a $30 million price on President
Bush's head and have tried to recruit Middle East terrorists to
kill him, Newsweek reports.
   The magazine, in its Dec. 25 issue, also said the drug cartels
have sought Colombian guerrillas to raid U.S. targets.
   The information was attributed to a well-placed State Department
official, who said some of the reports have been investigated but
none checked out.
   Deputy White House press secretary Roman Popadiuk said Sunday he
knew nothing about the reports.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., called the reported bounty
credible.
   ``They have used these tactics against their own people and they
would resort to this kind of effort,'' he said.
   The senator added that he thought it unlikely that Bush would
back down from his plan to attend a drug summit in Colombia Feb. 15.

<TEXT>
   Japanese and Soviet negotiators trying to draft a
treaty to formally end their World War II hostilities wound up
talks today with ``absolutely no new points of contact,'' a Foreign
Ministry official said.
   Although both governments have expressed a desire to improve
their chilly relations, the Japanese official said neither was
willing to compromise on a territorial dispute over several islands
in the southern Kurile chain held by the Soviets since the end of
the war in 1945.
   ``There were absolutely no new points of contact,'' said the
official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. He said
the Soviet delegation called Soviet possession of the islands a
``postwar reality,'' and urged Japan to ``assume a stance that
recognizes the results of the war.''
   Japan, however, renewed its claim to what it calls the
``northern territories,'' a group of small islands off Hokkaido,
Japan's northernmost main island.
   The official said the Soviet delegation proposed the exchange of
draft treaties, but that Japan refused because of ``reservations
regarding the validity of such drafts'' while the territorial
dispute continues.
   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev, head of the Soviet
delegation, was scheduled to continue talks with his Japanese
counterpart, Hisashi Owada, on a less formal level Tuesday, the
official said.
   Rogachev, completing a tour of five Asian nations, is scheduled
to fly back to Moscow Wednesday.
   The apparent failure of the talks comes less than two weeks
after Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, prompted by rapid changes in
Eastern Europe and the recent mood of East-West detente, called for
a new era in bilateral relations.
   Exchanges between the two nations have recently increased, and
along with a scheduled visit of Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze next March, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is
expected to visit Japan in 1991. If he does, he will be the first
Soviet president to do so.
   Foreign Ministry officials said their expectations for any new
developments were low going into the talks, but room for compromise
had been indicated earlier by Politburo member Alexander Yakovlev,
a close adviser to Gorbachev who during a visit to Tokyo last month
spoke of a possibility of a ``third route'' toward improved
relations.
   However, no progress toward opening up a new path was made in
today's talks, the official said, adding that both countries
continue to have a ``different approach.''
   ``What the Japanese call the territorial problem, we call the
definition of borders,'' he quoted a Soviet official as saying.
   He said most of the seven-hour talks dealt with the Soviet claim
to historical and legal jurisdiction over the islands, which they
say have belonged to Russia since the late 18th century and were
defined as Soviet territory by the Yalta Conference in 1945 and the
San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1951.
   Japan disputes those claims, countering that the islands have
been an integral part of its territory since ancient times. Tokyo
also claims a treaty signed in 1855 and a treaty ending the
Russo-Japanese War in 1905 give Japan rightful ownership.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Release Of Ex-Policeman Held In Death Squad Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge today overruled police
investigators and ordered the release of a former policeman
detained in the assassination of two white left-wing activists.
   Police had opposed the release of Calla Botha, saying there was
evidence linking him to a right-wing group responsible for
political assassinations.
   Johannesburg Supreme Court Justice J.C. Kriegler granted an
application filed by Botha's father, a retired police colonel,
seeking release of his son. Kriegler said there was insufficient
evidence connecting Botha to death squads.
   Botha was detained without charge on Nov. 30 as part of an
investigation into the assassinations of David Webster, a
university lecturer and human rights activist, and Anton Lubowski,
the only white office-holder in Namibia's main independence
movement, the South-West Africa People's Organization.
   Both were shot outside their homes _ Webster in Johannesburg on
May 1 and Lubowski in Windhoek, Namibia, on Sept. 12.
   In a court affidavit last week, police Brig. Floris Mostert
described Botha as the ``handler'' for Donald Acheson, who is held
in Windhoek awaiting trial for Lubowksi's murder.
   Another former policeman, Ferdinand Barnard, remains detained in
Johannesburg in the case. Mostert said Botha and Barnard were held
briefly in June after they were uncovered monitoring the movements
of one of Webster's activist colleagues.
   Police say the Webster-Lubowski case is not directly related to
investigations of claims that death squads within the ranks of the
national police force killed government opponents on the orders of
high-ranking officers.
   One black ex-policeman has pleaded guilty to committing a murder
as part of such a death squad, and a white former captain, Dirk
Coetzee, fled abroad after telling a newspaper he commanded a death
squad.
   In other developments today:
   _Police headquarters reported five more deaths in factional
fighting in black townships around the port city of Durban.
Authorities say more than 100 people have been killed in the area
this month in violence related to a three-year feud throughout
Natal Province between Inkatha, a relatively conservative Zulu
political organization, and supporters of militant anti-apartheid
groups.
   _Police freed four black activists who staged a three-week
hunger strike after they were detained without charge while leading
an unauthorized protest in Alexandra, an impoverished black
township near Johannesburg.
   Obed Bapela, a spokesman for the anti-apartheid Alexandra Civic
Organization, said the four had suspended their fast Friday after
police informed them they would soon be freed.

   The nation's cold siege lobbed light snow and sleet at the Deep
South today after a weekend of freezing temperatures that chased
the homeless into shelters and brought early snow for skiers.
   Temperatures far below normal were again the order of the day
across much of the country, and snow was expected from the Rockies
across the Plains and into the Great Lakes region. Sleet or
freezing rain fell in Atlanta, Charleston, S.C., and Macon, Ga.,
and snow was forecast from northern Texas through Alabama.
   Forecasters said there's no end in sight to the chill that's
camped over much of the country for several days.
   Winter doesn't begin until Thursday, but today's highs were
expected to remain below zero in the upper Plains, the teens in the
Rockies and the 20s in an arc from Washington through the Texas
Panhandle, the Midwest and New England.
   ``It might not be that unusual if it was the middle of January
... but everyone agrees this is indeed atypical,'' said weather
service meteorologist Edward Yandrich in New York. ``In layman's
terms, it's just been very, very cold.''
   Temperature records fell Sunday in at least 19 cities, among
them: Cincinnati, minus 9; Cleveland, minus 7; Elkins, W.Va., minus
8; Paducah, Ky., and Indianpolis, minus 10.
   Today, records that had held firm for more than a century fell
in Columbus, Ohio, where it was minus 7; in Pittsburgh, where it
also was 7 below, and in Detroit, where it was minus 3.
   Cincinnati set another record for the date, at 3 below, as did
Cleveland, minus 5; Youngstown, Ohio, 8 below; and Charleston,
W.V., 2 above.
   In Tulsa, Okla, where Sunday's high was 30, two girls died after
falling into an ice-covered lake. Authorities said the girls, ages
9 and 12, apparently were sliding on a plastic tray when the ice,
which was only 1 to 2 inches thick, gave way.
   The homeless, ineffectually bundled up against the chill, were
urged to crowd into shelters.
   In Philadelphia, outreach workers scoured streets through the
weekend as temperatures dipped to 17. A transient woman was found
dead of exposure on a downtown bench Saturday, authorities said.
   About 30 homeless people spent Sunday huddled around bonfires
kindled in trash cans in New York City's Tompkins Square Park after
a judge reversed an earlier edict banning the blazes. The city
sought to outlaw the fires as dangerous.
   An exposure death was reported in Baltimore, and nationwide, at
least nine traffic deaths have been blamed on the weather since
Friday. Faulty space heaters may share the blame for a spate of
house and apartment fires that claimed six lives over the weekend
in Chicago, firefighters said.
   As many as 3,000 rail passengers were stranded for up to 4{
hours at Chicago's Union Station when rail switches froze.
   For the more fortunate, the pre-holiday chill got the ski season
off to a fast start. Several inches of fresh powder attracted
skiers to the slopes in New York and New England.
   In the West, the snow was deeper.
   Two to 5 feet of snow has fallen in Colorado during the past
week, building a 59-inch snow base at the Steamboat Springs ski
resort.
   ``It's good powder skiing _ soft powder skiing,'' said Coloradan
Joe Puchek, who was skiing at Copper Mountain.
   Two dozen avalanches were reported in the backcountry north of
Interstate 70 in the 24 hours ending Saturday, according to the
Colorado Avalanche Information Center.
   Twenty-five inches of snow fell this weekend in Syracuse, N.Y.,
within an inch of the average snowfall for the entire month of
December.
   None of this deterred America's dedicated joggers.
   About 500 runners braved 10-degree temperatures Sunday to
compete in a 10- kilometer race along the soon-to-be-opened
North-South Tollway in DuPage County west of Chicago.
   And in New York's Central Park, 1,200 turned out for a
30-kilometer race with temperatures in the mid-20s.
   Park jogger Peter Apostolicas, 32, said his cotton and nylon
clothing was proof against the chill. ``Once you get going it's
fine,'' he said.

popular presidential election since 1960, according to partial
returns today.
   Sunday's runoff was seen as a referendum on two decades of rapid
but unequal growth that has brought 1,500 percent annual inflation,
sinking real wages and corruption, and the Third World's biggest
foreign debt, $110 billion.
   Voters could choose between two kinds of reform to attack the
problems _ Collor de Mello's free-market policies or the platform
of Luis Inacio Lula da Silva that includes redistribution of land
and wealth, reform in education and health care and a moratorium on
Brazil's foreign debt.
   The Supreme Electoral Court had Collor de Mello leading da Silva
by 1 percentage point, after counting 33.8 percent of the returns.
   Globo TV, the nation's largest network, had Collor de Mello
ahead by 2.9 million votes, or 4.9 percent of the total, with 85.7
percent of the votes counted in an unofficial tally.
   The network, which used its computers to tally the returns from
individual states, today projected Collor de Mello as the winner.
   Electoral Court spokesman Irineu Tamanini said Collor de Mello's
lead was expected to grow as returns came in from the candidate's
strongholds in remote central and northern regions. The official
count was slower because state returns were doublechecked to avoid
error.
   Officials said the final tally would not be ready until
Wednesday.
   Brazilians went to the polls on a jubilant, peaceful election
day in a historic vote hailed as a huge step toward the return of
civilian rule after a rightist military regime ruled from 1964 to
1985.
   Many waved banners, honked horns and sported T-shirts and
buttons favoring one or the other candidate for the five-year
presidential term.
   Brazil, with 150 million people, is the world's third-most
populous democracy, after India and the United States. Brazil has
82 million registered voters, but turnout was reported lower than
expected in some regions.
   Two exit polls predicted Collor de Mello, an athletic
40-year-old former governor from a wealthy and powerful political
clan, would win by between 3 percent and 4 percent.
   One survey, by the Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and
Statistics, the country's biggest private polling company, gave
Collor de Mello 52 percent of the vote and da Silva 48 percent.
   A second exit poll, by the respected DataFolha polling
institute, gave Collor de Mello 51.5 percent of the electorate. It
forecast 48.5 percent for da Silva, a bearded gravel-voiced labor
leader who grew up in poverty.
   The surveys buoyed officials of the Collor de Mello camp.
   ``We are not celebrating yet, but we are relieved because the
polls are confirming our expectations of victory,'' Claudio
Humberto Rosa e Silva, spokesman for Collor de Mello's rightist
National Reconstruction Party, said Sunday.
   Officials of the 44-year-old da Silva's Workers Party said it
was too early to concede defeat.
   Collor de Mello, a former governor of Alagoas who advocates
free-market policies and battling corruption in government, is
backed by Brazil's business, military and media establishments.
   The coalition behind da Silva, called the Brazil Popular Front,
includes Marxists, unionists, top singers, soap opera stars, former
leftist guerillas and the dominant liberal wing of Brazil's
powerful Roman Catholic Church.
   The new president is to replace lame-duck President Jose Sarney
on March 15. However, there is growing sentiment for Sarney to
resign before then. Two of Sarney's Cabinet ministers said Sunday
the president-elect should take office soon to save Brazil's ailing
economy.
   Heavy rains in central, northeastern and far southern Brazil
reduced voter turnout on Sunday.
   A number of voters wrote personal messages to the candidates on
the ballots, which nullified their votes.
   One voter in Belem, capital of the northern Amazon state of
Para, wrote on a ballot, ``Please do something to help the young
people in Brazil who are taking drugs.''
   Collor de Mello and da Silva were the top vote-getters in a
field of 21 candidates in first-round balloting Nov. 15. Neither
obtained a majority needed to win, and the two went to a runoff
election.
   The last popularly elected president of Brazil was Janio
Quadros. He resigned in 1961 after seven months in office citing
``occult forces.'' A right-wing military regime overthrew Quadros'
successor, his vice-president, Joao Goulart, and ruled until 1985.
   Sarney is a civilian but gained office through a
military-coordinated Electoral College vote in 1985.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze told Belgian officials today that the Soviet Union
wants to establish close economic ties with Western Europe and
switch to a market economy.
   Shevardnadze is on the first day of a two-day visit to Brussels,
where he will sign a new trade and economic cooperation agreement
with the 12-nation European Community trading bloc.
   He also will make an unprecedented visit to NATO military
headquarters, underscoring the rapidly changing East-West climate.
   `I never said integration (of the Soviet economy with the West)
would be easy. But we are taking the first step, laying the first
stone,'' Shevardnadze said in reference to the trade agreement
negotiated with the EC.
   Shevardnadze, who met briefly with reporters after talks with
Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens of Belgium, was asked about Soviet
promises to withdraw all its troops from Eastern Europe by the
start of the next century.
   ``We must find a reciprocal solution,'' he said. ``I'm thinking
of the U.S. presence ... We must have serious negotiations. We have
a mutual interest in stability in Europe.''
   Eyskens said after meeting with Shevardnadze that the Soviets
``want to break with their past.''
   ``They have concluded that the centrally planned economy is no
good,'' he said.
   Shevardnaze met with Prime Minister Wilfried Martens and was to
sign a trade and economic cooperation agreement at European
Community headquarters.
   On Tuesday, Shevardnaze will meet with NATO Secretary General
Manfred Woerner and the ambassadors of the 16 NATO nations at the
headquarters of the Western alliance.
   Community and Soviet negotiators concluded a trade and economic
accord Nov. 27 that provides for a gradual lifting of import quotas
on Soviet industrial goods and cites a dozen areas in which the two
sides may establish economic cooperation.
   These include science and technology, banking, transport,
agriculture, environmental protection, energy, raw materials and
mining.
   The accord excludes trade in goods that are considered
militarily sensitive, according to EC sources.
   The pact is the fourth between the community and an East
European country since the EC and the Moscow-led Comecon trade
group signed a mutual recognition accord June 25, 1988. Comecon
stands for Council for Mutual and Economic assistance.
   The EC has also concluded trade and economic cooperation accords
with Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia.
   These accords _ plus the ones the European Community's Executive
Commission is currently negotiating with Bulgaria and East Germany
_ are bound to dramatically boost economic relations between
Eastern and Western Europe.
   The mutual recognition agreement the community signed with the
10-nation Comecon group in 1988 ended a 30-year-period in which
Moscow and its allies routinely viewed it as an extension of the
NATO alliance.
   Moscow's partners in Comecon are East Germany, Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Vietnam, Mongolia and
Cuba.
   Speaking to reporters after a two-day NATO foreign ministers
meeting, Woerner sought to dispel any notion he and Shevardnaze
would engage in in-depth negotiations on Tuesday.
   He and other officials stressed the meeting would be on the
order of a courtesy call.
   Woerner said he and Shevardnaze would simply discuss ``matters
of common interest. This is a first contact. We will have an
exchange of views.''
   Even so, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Braitain described
the visit to NATO as ``a symbol of what's been happening'' in East
West relations.

   Flames from 23,110 candles illuminated
snowy Antietam battlefield, flickering in a holiday tribute to each
soldier killed, wounded or missing on the bloodiest day of the
Civil War.
   The candles, burning inside sand-filled brown paper bags,
emitted faint light at dusk Sunday. When darkness fell, a trumpeter
played taps and 2,826 automobiles began a slow procession through
4.5 miles of the battlefield of rolling hills 70 miles west of
Baltimore.
   ``You actually had a sense of beings _ spirits,'' John Gress, a
Waynesboro, Pa., retiree said. ``In one place, someone placed a
candle so somehow it glistened on a tree covered with ice. It was
unbelievable.''
   More men were killed or wounded at Antietam on Sept. 17, 1862,
than on any other single day in American military history. Union
casualties were 12,410 and Confederate 10,700.
   ``It's a memorial and Christmas is the season of lights. We just
thought it would be a good time to stop and reflect,'' said Richard
Rambur, superintendent of the national battlefield.
   ``When you were placing the candles you'd wonder who might have
fallen on the spot where you were putting one,'' said Dan Weiss of
Sharpsburg, one of an estimated 400 volunteers who distributed and
lit the candles.
   It took at least 30 minutes to drive through the park to see the
candles glowing under a starless sky. Four cannons, black
silhouettes against the sky, were embraced by the lights, many
standing in rows like the headstones at Arlington National Cemetery.
   Neither side gained a decisive victory in the Battle of
Antietam, which was the climax of the first of Gen. Robert E. Lee's
two attempts to carry the war into the North. The battle also gave
President Lincoln an opportunity to issue the Emancipation
Proclamation, which freed the slaves in 1863.
   ``I was a medical officer in Vietnam where the American casualty
count was in the mid-50,000 range, and that was over a long period
of time,'' National Park Service director James M. Ridenour said.
``When you stand here and realize 23,000-plus within eyesight in
one day _ it's breathtaking.''
   The Rev. Richard Hembrock, a Lutheran minister in Sharpsburg,
said: ``People will be able to see how more than 23,000 candles
relate to lives out here. It will be a chance to reflect what we
fought for and what we believe in.''

   Premier Ante Markovic today proposed
a new convertible currency unit in Yugoslavia as part of a sweeping
reform plan to save the Communist nation from its worst economic
crisis.
   About 160,000 workers staged a half-hour ``warning'' strike in
the republic of Montenegro today to pressure the government into
adopting urgent measures to contain hyperinflation, hovering at
2,000 percent.
   The strike coincided with the start of a three-day Parliament
meeting, at which Markovic unveiled his proposals.
   A solution to the problems ``is not possible without a
completely new economic and political system that would ensure
economic efficiency and political democracy with full freedoms and
human rights,'' Markovic said.
   Markovic said one new ``convertible dinar'' would be worth
10,000 old dinars. Yugoslavs should from now on be able to freely
purchase foreign currencies with dinars in local banks, he said.
   The exchange rate would be fixed at seven dinars for one West
German mark and remain unchanged until June 30, 1990, Markovic said.
   Until now, the dinar rate was adjusted daily compared to foreign
currencies and has lost value rapidly as inflation has soared.
   One U.S. dollar would be worth 12 new dinars, instead of the
current 120,000 dinars, Markovic said.
   The dinar was pegged to the West German mark because of its
``greatest stability'' on world money markets, Markovic said.
   He specified the changeover would take place Jan. 1, 1990, if
Parliament approves the package.
   Markovic's government, which took over in March, has threatened
to resign if the plan is rejected.
   Legislators have moved quickly to introduce market mechanisms as
a way out of Yugoslavia's economic crisis, which includes a $17
billion foreign debt and 17 percent inflation.
   Yugoslavia's last re-evaluation of the dinar occurred in 1965.
   At today's meeting, Markovic also announced tight monetary and
budgetary controls; free formation of interest rates which in the
past have been set by the country's National Bank; and government
control of prices on electricity, gasoline, rail transport, rents,
postal services and medicines.
   The central bank would for the first time become ``fully
autonomous'' in conducting monetary policies in accordance with
market mechanisms and will no longer be allowed to print money in
order to cover state deficits, Markovic said.
   The government also proposed to Parliament changes in the
country's criminal code, including dropping the so-called ``verbal
offenses'' under which thousands of people have been prosecuted for
privately or publicly criticizing the Communist regime.
   The state Tanjug news agency said ``the last warning to the
government'' was staged in the underdeveloped republic because its
policy has ``brought a large part of Montenegro's population to the
edge of famine and social misery.''
   Similar strikes were expected to take place in the country's
largest republic of Serbia on Wednesday and in the poorest region,
Macedonia, on Thursday.
   The state-run trade union of Montenegro reportedly said in a
proclamation that unless Markovic introduces urgent measures to
raise living standards, ``a much longer general strike will ensue.''

   Human rights champion Andrei D. Sakharov was
buried today in the cold earth of the Russia he tried so hard to
change, mourned by tens of thousands of countrymen and praised by
the leadership that once reviled him.
   ``It's over,'' Sakharov's wife and dissident comrade-in-arms,
Yelena Bonner, said as she turned to a companion during the
twilight burial in a Moscow cemetery.
   Before Sakharov's crimson- and black-trimmed coffin was lowered
into the ground at Vostryakovskoye Cemetery, its cover was removed
to allow Bonner to bid a final farewell. She removed the shroud
from his face and bent to kiss him on the forehead.
   Sakharov, who died Thursday of an apparent heart attack at the
age of 68, he was buried alongside Bonner's mother, Ruth, a
Stalin-era political prisoner who died in 1987 at age 87.
   Top party brass riding sleek black limousines and tens of
thousands of common people trudging through the slush joined in
paying their last respects to the Nobel laureate.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other ruling Politburo
members stood in icy morning rain to view the body outside the
Academy of Sciences, to which Sakharov, a creator of the Soviet
hydrogen bomb, belonged. Gorbachev spoke at length with Bonner.
   ``Now it is clear that he deserved the Nobel Prize,'' Gorbachev
told reporters. Sakharov was denied permission to travel to Norway
to accept the 1975 prize for his human rights campaign. He was
hounded for years and finally banished into internal exile by past
Soviet leaders.
   Some marchers carried protest signs demanding democratic
elections, echoing the final cause of Sakharov before he died last
week. Others hoisted the blue-red-white flag of czarist Russia, now
the symbol of the grassroots pro-democracy Russian People's Front.
   More than 8,000 grieving Soviets followed Sakharov's body,
transported in an open-ended bus that also carried Bonner along
Lenin Prospekt to outdoor funeral ceremonies at Luzhniki sports
complex. The southern Moscow facility is a favorite site for
rallies by human rights activists.
   In the Kremlin, the 2,250-member Soviet Congress to which
Sakharov belonged adjourned at midday so its members could attend
the ceremony.
   State-run television showed excerpts of the service in a special
broadcast of the kind usually reserved for the deaths of major
government figures.
   At the outdoor service, the crowd surged dangerously forward
toward Sakharov's coffin and Bonner had to plead for order. The
coffin was then transported nine miles in a bus along slush-filled
streets to the cemetery.
   In the afternoon, tens of thousands of mourners gathered at the
Luzhniki stadium parking lot for a memorial service.
   Sakharov ``did all he could,'' said Ilya Zaslavsky, a Moscow
member of the Soviet Congress. ``Now only his ideas can change
things, and only we can fulfill his ideas.''
   Other parliamentarians pledged to heed Sakharov's call to create
a full-fledged opposition in the Congress and to push for victory
for progressives in local elections.
   ``The best wreath for Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov is to win over
conservatives in the March elections,'' said economist and deputy
Gavriil Popov.
   Lech Walesa, the leader of Poland's Solidarity movement and
winner of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, had been expected to attend
the funeral, but Poland's official PAP news agency reported that
his plane had to land in Leningrad because of bad weather.
   Gorbachev and other top Soviet officials, including Politburo
members Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, Alexander
N. Yakovlev and Vadim A. Medvedev arrived at the Academy of
Sciences building in Moscow in the morning to view Sakharov's body.
   From another direction, buses escorted by police cars arrived.
Some 20 people bore a closed casket on their shoulders from a bus,
and placed it on a platform in front of the academy. Bonner also
emerged, accompanied by her son Alexei Semenov.
   The coffin was opened in the frigid rain, and an umbrella opened
to shield Sakharov's face.
   Gorbachev walked to the foot of the casket, and stood for awhile
in silence. He then nodded, and the huddle of people around the
casket broke up.
   Sakharov's body was placed back on the bus and taken to the
Lebedev Physics Institute, where Sakharov worked.
   ``His only wish was for the state to have a human face,''
Academician Yevgeny L. Feynberg said of his fellow physicist as
colleagues at the institute filed past the casket.
   Outside the Academy of Sciences, Gorbachev and Bonner spoke
animatedly, with Bonner smiling at one point. Gorbachev and his
entourage entered the academy building to sign an official book of
condolences. The Soviet leader simply wrote ``M.S. Gorbachev.''
   He emerged, and talked briefly with repoters. ``The relations
between myself and Sakharov were always those of mutual respect,''
Gorbachev said. ``Now it is clear that he deserved the Nobel
Prize.''
   It was Gorbachev who allowed Sakharov to return to Moscow in
December 1986 after nearly seven years of internal exile in the
city of Gorky. The two men had clashed, however, over the speed and
sweep of Gorbachev's political reform program, with Sakharov
demanding the Communist Party that Gorbachev heads renounce its
constitutional monopoly on power.
   Moscow News _ an organ of the official press which once branded
Sakharov an ``utterly ignorant person'' _ took the rare step Sunday
of publishing a special edition devoted to the activist.
   It included a text of Sakharov's last public remarks, a speech
he delivered hours before his death in which he said the Soviet
hierarchy was ``leading the country to a catastrophe.''

   Romanian police opened fire on protesters
during weekend anti-government riots, and at least two people were
killed, including a child, a person traveling in the region said
today.
   In West Germany, Radio Bremen quoted William Totok, an ethnic
German author who emigrated from Romania to West Germany, as saying
that eyewitnesses told him as many as 300 to 400 people were
killed. The report could not be independently confirmed.
   Several sources reported Sunday and today that they heard
gunfire in the streets of Timisoara, Romania's fourth-largest city,
following the largest protests against the hard-line Communist
government in two years.
   Romania sealed its border with Yugoslavia today to all but
official traffic and tanks were reported patrolling Timisoara and a
nearby city.
   President Nicolae Ceausescu, the East bloc's longest-ruling
leader, traveled to Iran on a state visit. He has crushed
opposition, rejected the reforms being adopted elsewhere in Eastern
Europe and imposed harsh economic measures on Romania.
   Romanian emigres said thousands of demonstrators enraged with
the hardship and repression under Ceausescu clashed with security
forces in Timisoara. Police reportedly fired shot and also used
water cannon against the demonstrators.
   Romania's strictly controlled state-run media made no mention of
the unrest, but Bucharest radio on Sunday warned citizens to stay
calm, indicating security forces were worried about protests
spreading, as occurred in East Germany and Czechoslovakia.
   Popular revolts in those countries led to the downfall of
hard-line leaders and ended the Communists' monopoly on power.
   Elsewhere in the East bloc today:
   _East Germany's Communist leaders resumed talks with opposition
factions on how to run the country until the first free elections
are held in May.
   _Czechoslovakia's Communist Party chief, Karel Urbanek, said his
party likely will try to form a coalition with other parties before
free elections planned next year. The party's official Rude Pravo
newspaper apologized for past articles that criticized opponents of
the government.
   _Yugoslavia's Premier Ante Markovic proposed a new convertible
currency unit as part of a sweeping reform plan to save the
Communist nation from its worst economic crisis.
   The traveler in Romania, a Yugoslav who refused to give his
name, told The Associated Press that other Yugoslav tourists
reported seeing more dead in Timisoara after security forces
intervened to break up the protests.
   Those reports also could not be independently confirmed, and
Romania has refused to allow Western journalists into the country.
   ``Police and troops moved in quickly,'' the traveler said after
leaving Romania today. He said only police, but not troops, were
seen firing at the demonstrators.
   ``I saw two dead, including a child, on the streets,'' the
source said.
   Western diplomats contacted by telephone in Romania said
security forces guarded Otopeni international airport and refused
to allow a plane carrying about 200 Western tourists to land.
   It also refused to allow a group of 28 British schoolgirls,
three teachers and two parents who were on a ski vacation. They
were detained at Bucharest Airport on Sunday, the British Foreign
Office said in London.
   Hungarian border officials also reported that entry to Romania
by Hungarian visitors was severely curtailed following the weekend
demonstrations.
   Zoltan Kiraly, a Hungarian parliamentarian, told legislators
tanks were on the streets of Timisoara, where a protest over an
ethnic dispute evolved into a violent demonstration against
Ceausescu.
   Kiraly said tanks also patrolled Arad, 40 miles north of
Timisoara, where unrest was reported over the weekend.
   Timisoara, with a population of 350,000, is in the region of
Transylvania, about 30 miles from the Yugoslav and Hungarian
borders.
   Protest in Romania has generally originated in Transylvania and
the northern areas near Soviet Moldavia, where people can
understand broadcasts from neighboring Hungary and the Soviet Union
and learn of reforms sweeping the East bloc but rejected by
Ceausescu.
   Hungarian Premier Miklos Nemeth told reporters in Budapest that
he had been told Romanian armed forces were put on a state of
alert, but this could not be confirmed.
   Budapest radio, quoting unidentified witnesses, reported that
Romanian security forces sealed off Timisoara.
   Romanian emigres who contacted friends and relatives abroad said
anti-government demonstrations also were staged in Brasov, another
Transylvanian city that was the site of a major anti-Communist
rally in 1987.
   The Western diplomats said the Romanian capital, Bucharest,
appeared calm.
   Ceausescu, 71, rarely travels abroad, and his departure for Iran
indicated he wanted to appear unruffled by the demonstrations. His
wife Elena, the second most powerful person in the country, stayed
behind.
   In Geneva, exiled King Michael of Romania today condemned the
crackdown on anti-government protests and said he was deeply moved
by the demonstrators' ``courageous action.''
   The unrest in Timisoara began Saturday after demonstrators
formed a human chain to prevent officials from evicting an ethnic
Hungarian clergyman from his church. Transylvania's ethnic
Hungarian minority has long complained of harassment by Romanian
authorities.
   Some news reports said the government planned to deport the
Protestant minister, the Rev. Laszlo Toekes, a Reformed Church
clergyman who has championed the rights of ethnic Hungarians.
   Toekes had been confined to the church since masked assailants
attacked him in his adjoining apartment Nov. 2, said Steve Toekes,
the minister's brother, in a telephone interview today from his
home in Montreal.
   The Hungarian state-run MTI news agency, said a crowd of
Hungarians and Romanians ``tried to prevent the eviction of their
clergyman when hell broke loose and the human chain changed into a
demonstration of thousands against Ceausescu and his regime.
   ``Riot police tried to suppress the demonstration, and a bloody
brawl started,'' the agency said. MTI said it took police nearly
two hours to regain control. It said Toekes' fate was not known.
   ``Eyewitnesses saw bloodied young people in the streets of
Timisoara and Ceausescu pictures floating on the Bega Canal. They
said many of the demonstrators were arrested,'' MTI said.
   Yugoslav travelers returning from Timisoara told The Associated
Press in Belgrade that tens of thousands of people were milling in
the streets Sunday morning. The Yugoslavs said that ``the entire
city seemed on the streets.''
   They said that when they left the city at 2 p.m. Sunday, cordons
of soldiers, three-deep, were blocking traffic at main
intersections.
   The Yugoslav witnesses said on Saturday night, protesters
smashed the window of a bookstore, threw Ceausescu books into the
street and burned them.
   A Yugoslav customs official at the Vatin crossing to Romania
told the AP in Belgrade that Romania stopped letting through all
private cars early today.
   MTI said that on Sunday morning Romania closed its border for
Hungarians, but other travelers were apparently allowed to enter
Romania.
   Ceausescu was elected Romanian Communist Party chief on March
22, 1965.
   This is the biggest challenge to his leadership since an
anti-government march in the town of Brasov in 1987.
   That protest was quashed by the massive secret police force that
has helped Ceausescu, the longest-serving Soviet bloc leader, to
silence virtually all dissent.

   Mayor-elect David Dinkins today named Houston
Police Chief Lee P. Brown as the city's next police commissioner.
   Brown, 52, will lead the nation's biggest police force, with
30,000 members, seven times more than Houston's. He takes office
Jan. 22, succeeding Richard Condon, who has held the post since
Benjamin Ward retired in October.
   At a news conference today in Houston, Brown said he considers
the New York City post a ``once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.''
   ``Obviously it's the largest police department, and the
opportunity to run the largest police department _ that's the
challenge,'' Brown, chief of Houston's 4,500-member force since
1982.
   Brown, who is black, has been credited with easing racial
tension in Houston. But the Houston force recently has been hit
with allegations of racism and corruption, as well as controversy
over shootings by officers.
   He is known to have opposed an all-civilian board to review
complaints against police in Houston, while Dinkins favors the idea
in New York.
   ``We didn't discuss it at great length,'' said Dinkins, who was
elected New York City's first black mayor. ``He's someone who's
concerned a lot about the behavior of police.''
   Brown, only the second out-of-towner named New York police
commissioner in 30 years, $110,000 a year in Houston and said he
would receive the same here.
   He was previously public safety commissioner in Atlanta, an
educator in criminal justice at Portland State University and
Howard University, and a sheriff in Oregon.

   President Bush today called the weekend
slaying of an American officer in Panama ``an enormous outrage''
and said he is reviewing a range of options in response. He
pointedly did not rule out military action.
   ``I think a president, all presidents, have options, but they
don't discuss what they might be,'' Bush said. He repeated the
answer when asked if military action was among the options
available.
   He said the U.S. failure to drive Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
from power in Panama was ``an enormous frustration'' of his first
year in office.
   The president made his comments in an Oval Office interview with
reporters from The Associated Press and three other news agencies.
His remarks followed the shooting Saturday night of a U.S. military
officer who was in a car with other Americans trying to flee a
crowd of Panamanian troopers and civilians.
   Bush's voice was raspy, showing signs of the laryngitis that
forced him to cancel a speechmaking trip to New York last Friday.
   On other topics, the president:
   _Defended anew his decision to send two top aides to China to
rekindle relations for the first time since the bloody suppression
of pro-democracy demonstrators last June. He said he does not know
when Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi would be able to leave the U.S.
Embassy in Beijing, where he has taken refuge since the crackdown.
   _Said the administration is undertaking a ``massive
re-evaluation of intentions as well as military threat'' by the
Soviet bloc in light of the radical political changes sweeping
Eastern Europe.
   _Said ``as far as I'm concerned'' his 1988 campaign pledge
against new taxes still stands.
   _Shrugged off a published report that Colombian drug lords have
placed a $30 million price on his head. ``There is nothing to it,''
he said and added he was confident the Secret Service could protect
him when he attends a regional drug summit in Colombia on Feb. 15.
   The administration was quick to blame Noriega for the weekend
violence in Panama. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater today
condemned ``a climate of aggression'' there and said Noriega seems
to have granted a ``license for harassment'' against Americans.
   In the interview, Bush said of the fatal shooting of the
American officer: ``It's an enormous outrage and a matter of
enormous concern to this president.''
   He also defended his decision to send the high-level delegation
to China 10 days ago, even though Chinese leaders remain
unrepentant about the massacre of pro-democracy students.
   Speaking of his gesture, he said, ``I don't think it's a
salute'' to the hard-line leaders i Beijing. He spoke of it as a
decision to end the isolation of a country of more than 1 billion
people.
   Bush said the criticism of his move was ``not a good rap'' but
that a president has to be willing ``to take a little heat from
time to time. It hasn't been that much.''
   On another foreign policy front, the president said that signs
of moderation in Iran after the death this year of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini have not been backed up by concrete action.
   Bush said he feels a ``personal frustration'' that the American
hostages in Lebanon remain in captivity, adding: ``It's on my mind
an awful lot.'' He said he wrote a personal note recently to the
relatives of the hostages.
   Fielding a question on the domestic agenda, the president
renewed his pledge against any new taxes. Asked if the vow he took
for 1989 would remain in effect next year, he said: ``As far as I'm
concerned it is.''
   Bush appeared unswayed by arguments in Congress that the massive
political changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe should
translate into big spending cuts for the Pentagon.
   ``I will not take any naive unilateral action and I am
determined to move forward on a sensible program of evaluation and
a sensible program of arms reduction which includes conventional
forces,'' he said.
   Bush said he and Gorbachev should push ahead on a range of arms
control steps, including chemical weapons and conventional forces
in Europe.
   ``So let's go forward with our eyes open and do that,'' Bush
said. ``And I think that's exactly what Mr. Gorbachev wants to do.''
   In an opening statement, the president said he and Gorbachev
both want to wrap up a treaty before their scheduled summit in June
1990 to cut strategic nuclear weapons arsenals nearly in half.
   He also pledged that the United States would take ``an active
and appropriate role'' in encouraging democratic changes in Eastern
Europe.
   On his overture to China, Bush refused to say whether he won any
concession from Beijing in return for the United States taking the
first step to renew contact.
   ``I'm not going to discuss what I did or didn't get ..,'' he
said. You see, I still believe that sometimes to affect change you
talk in confidence.''
   Defending his decision to go first, Bush said: ``You do what you
think is correct. If you screw something up, you say, `Hey, I was
wrong.' If you're right, you don't get instant credit for it. So
you just try to do your best.''

   A wave swept a teen-age angler out to sea and
gusting high winds blew two cars into a head-on collision, killing
two people, to bring the weekend death toll from a savage tropical
storm to at least 18.
   Seven people were killed and 11 reported missing in France and
Britain over the weekend after the storm moved in with heavy rains,
lightning and wind blowing from the southwest Atlantic at speeds of
75 mph.
   Residents along French coastal areas areas had more rain and 62
mph gusts this morning, but the wind dropped later in the day and
forecasters predicted much milder winds Tuesday.
   Widespread damage was reported in western parts of the country,
with roofs torn off homes, trees and telephone lines toppled, and
structures knocked over by the gale-force winds.
   Two people died Sunday night on a highway near the northern
industrial city of Lille when a gust of wind pushed a car driven by
Laurent Dufour, 28, into the path of another vehicle carrying a
family of five.
   Dufour and Odile Denneulin, 15, died instantly. Denneulin's
parents and two siblings were injured.
   Near the Mediterranean Sea port of Toulon, an unidentified
teen-ager drowned Sunday when a huge wave swept him out to sea as
he fished from the shore. Three people near Paris died Sunday
afternoon when the storm pushed briefly into the capital.
   In Mauleon, 230 miles southwest of Paris, a 43-year-old man died
Saturday when a gust of wind knocked him off the roof of a shed he
was repairing.
   In Britain, the 35-foot fishing boat Destiny sank Saturday in
Scotland's Firth of Clyde, 750 feet from safe harbor, and all six
fishermen were believed lost in heavy seas and driving snow,
authorities said.

<HEAD>Big Airport Delays Reported at Heathrow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pre-Christmas travel rush caused long lines
and delays at Heathrow Airport, where security has been tightened
in the last six weeks, an airport spokeswoman said Monday.
   The operators of Heathrow and six other British airports
appealed to passengers to leave Christmas gifts unwrapped, minimize
electronic items they pack and limit themselves to one piece of
hand baggage to speed up security checks.
   ``There was a lot of congestion this morning due to heavy
Christmas traffic,'' the Heathrow spokeswoman said, speaking
anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   More than 250,000 passengers passed through Heathrow, the
world's busiest international airport, during the weekend, she said.
   Tighter security measures ordered by the Transport Department in
October did not contribute to the delays of up to two hours for
check-ins, she said.
   However, some travel agents were issuing airplane tickets
stamped with the warning to check in early ``in view of the
increased security precautions at British airports.''
   Those measures include the hiring of 350 additional security
staff and stricter checks on airport staff with access to aircraft.
   The Heathrow spokeswoman said the tightened security was not
related to Friday's warning by the U.S. State Department about a
possible terrorist attack on a U.S. target in Western Europe or
West Africa.
   Heathrow is spending $8 million to upgrade security following
the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 one year ago Thursday. The flight
originated in Frankfurt, but baggage and passengers were
transferred to a larger plane during a stop at Heathrow. All 259
people on board died, and 11 people on the ground in Lockerbie,
Scotland, were killed by the falling wreckage.
   ``Staff are aware that the spotlight will be on us this week and
everyone is anxious that there should be no slip-ups,'' said one
Pan Am worker at Heathrow, requesting anonymity.
   Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson described airport security
as ``satisfactory for the perceived level of threat.'' He said
airports are more secure now than a year ago, particularly for U.S.
aircraft, ``which are regarded as a higher risk than ours.''
   Heathrow's managing director, Alan Proctor, said: ``Particular
attention will be given to the examination of electronic goods
including radios, computers, cameras and battery powered equipment
and this will take longer.''
   The bomb that brought down Flight 103 was made of plastic
explosives concealed in a radio-cassette player.
   ``To avoid queues and congestion at security checkpoints, I urge
all departing passengers to help us to help them by traveling with
a minimum of electronic items and hand baggage this Christmas,''
Proctor said.

<HEAD>Church Leader, Mandela Discuss Talks With Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela's talks with
government officials are not a bid by the jailed black leader to
open power-sharing negotiations singlehandedly, a church leader
said Monday after visiting Mandela.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary of the South African
Council of Churches, said he conferred with Mandela for three hours
at the Victor Verster prison farm near Cape Town.
   One of the topics, Chikane said, were the meetings between
Mandela and government leaders, including last week's unprecedented
talks with President F.W. de Klerk.
   There has been press speculation, but no firm corroboration,
that some members and supporters of Mandela's African National
Congress guerrilla movement are worried the 71-year-old prisoner is
opening talks with the government before it meets the ANC's
preconditions. These preconditions include release of all political
prisoners, lifting of the state of emergency and removing a ban on
the ANC.
   Chikane said Mandela ``emphasized that he was not negotiating
with the government, but merely trying to act as a facilitator to
create conditions conducive for meaningful negotiations.''
   Chikane said Mandela ``looked very well. He was vibrant, alert
and applied his mind carefully on every matter we discussed.''
   Mandela, the most popular leader among South Africa's black
majority, has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life sentence
for plotting an anti-government sabotage campaign. Virtually all
prominent black leaders have said they will not enter negotiations
until he is freed, and there is strong speculation he will be
released next month.
   De Klerk has offered to negotiate a new constitution in five
years that would extend political rights to blacks. He says he
won't accept a one-person, one-vote system and wants whites to
maintain a veto power over major policy decisions.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of ethnic Turks fleeing
Bulgaria went on a hunger strike Monday to protest a tighter
immigration policy, national radio reported.
   The restrictions announced last week reversed Sweden's
longstanding liberal immigration policies and reflected the
changing political situation in Eastern Europe. It also followed an
11-month influx of refugees that has become the largest since World
War II.
   About 5,000 ethnic Turks from Bulgaria, claiming discrimination,
arbitrary arrests and killings, formed the largest group among
20,000 refugees who came to Sweden in the first half of 1989. In
all of 1988, 19,000 refugees applied for asylum in Sweden.
   About half the Turks, fearing they may be sent back to Bulgaria,
began an indefinite hunger strike, refraining from solid food, the
radio said.
   Under the new rules, asylum seekers must show that their lives
would be threatened if returned. Previously, they only had to
belong to a persecuted minority group.

   Two suspected members of an obscure
terrorist group shot and killed a policeman as he left for work in
this northeastern city, then sped away on a motorcycle, police said.
   Officer Juan Jose Sucino Ibanez was starting his van outside his
home in the working-class neighborhood of El Prat de Llobregat when
a man and a woman smashed the window and opened fire, police said.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but police said
the shooting was similar to others committed this month by the
tiny, extreme-left terrorist group GRAPO, which in Spanish stands
for the October First Revolutionary Anti-Fascist Group. Two
officers were seriously wounded in those shootings in Madrid and
Valencia.
   The group first became known and took its name from the date in
1975 when four Madrid police officers were murdered, an action it
later claimed. Police estimate the group has 10 active members.

   Government security officers said Monday they
are increasingly worried that violence will break out at detention
centers filled with Vietnamese protesting their forced repatriation.
   The daily demonstrations, which started when 51 people were sent
back to Vietnam on Dec. 12, continued Monday with thousands of
Vietnamese marching and staging sit-ins at three detention centers
in this British colony.
   The protests have been peaceful, although prison officers were
threatened Sunday by Vietnamese wielding homemade weapons at one
camp.
   Junior officers of the Corrections Services Department, which
runs the camps, said they feared for their lives because of the
growing numbers of weapons being uncovered, the government-run
radio reported.
   They also said the demonstrations increased worries the weapons
would be used against prison officers and urged the government to
fill hundreds of staff vacancies to increase security.
   Robert Van Leeuwen, the head of the local office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said he did not believe the
forced repatriation would greatly deter more Vietnamese from
sailing to Hong Kong from their Communist homeland.
   About 56,000 Vietnamese are languishing in camps in Hong Kong.
About 12,000 who arrived before June 1988 are considered refugees
eligible for resettlement abroad. The rest arrived after a new
screening program took effect and face repatriation to Vietnam
unless they can prove they fled persecution.
   Van Leeuwen has said forced repatriation is premature and
efforts should concentrate on the U.N.-monitored program of sending
home Vietnamese who volunteer to go back.

   The Bush administration said today that
Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's declaration of war seems
to have become a ``license for harassment'' against Americans.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, citing the weekend
killing of a U.S. officer in Panama and other incidents of
violence, condemned ``a climate of aggression that is very
disturbing.''
   And President Bush, in an interview today with reporters from
The Associated Press and three other news agencies, called the
slaying ``an enormous outrage.''
   Bush said he is reviewing a range of options in response, and
pointedly did not rule out military action.
   ``I think a president, all presidents, have options, but they
don't discuss what they might be,'' Bush said. He repeated the
answer when asked if military action was among the options
available.
   The Defense Department said four American servicemen were trying
to flee a crowd of Panamanian troopers and civilians Saturday night
when the Panamanian soldiers opened fire, fatally wounding one
American.
   Another U.S. officer's ankle was grazed with a bullet, the
statement said. The Americans were traveling in a private car and
were off-duty and unarmed, it added.
   The weekend violence came after Noriega had himself installed as
the country's supreme ruler on Friday and declared his country in a
state of war with the United States.
   ``We are monitoring the situation there on a continung basis,
but we are very concerned that the declaration of war that was
stated ...may have been a license for harassment and threats and in
this case murder,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``Other members of the U.S. military were detained, their
weapons and radios taken away from them after questioning, and then
released. The attack on the naval officer's wife certainly goes
beyond any previous experience. And the murder is outrageous in
itself,'' Fitzwater said.
   The Defense Department said a Navy lieutenant and his wife had
been stopped at the same roadblock as the four servicemen.
Panamanian soldiers blindfolded the Navy officer and his wife and
took them to a different location where they were interrogated for
about four hours, the department said.
   During the interrogation, the Navy officer was repeatedly beaten
and kicked in the groin, the statement said. His wife was slammed
against a wall and sexually threatened, it said.
   Fitzwater defended his characterization of the slaying as
``murder,'' saying the U.S. officer ``was unarmed and he was
killed.''
   He said most U.S. dependents have left the country or have been
moved onto the U.S. military base there, a 9:50 p.m. curfew had
been imposed over the weekend on U.S. military personnel, and the
base put on a high state of alert.
   ``There's no question that it's a dangerous situation,''
Fitzwater said.
   Earlier, deputy White House press secretary Roman Popadiuk said
the Noriega regime ``is isolated both domestically and
internationally and has been using force and intimidation to thwart
the will of the Panamanian people. Acts such as those of last
evening are the consequence of such a regime.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney met Sunday with senior officials
at the Pentagon and issued a statement afterward saying, ``We've
seen General Noriega brutalize the people of Panama, crack down on
his own civilians and military alike after the last coup attempt,
designate himself the leader of the country and declare a state of
war with the United States.''
   ``These actions have created an atmosphere in which Panamanian
Defense Forces feel free to fire on unarmed Americans. We fully
expect that those responsible will be brought to justice,'' Cheney
said.
   ``Ultimately, it is General Noriega himself who has encouraged
this kind of lawlessness. His own conduct sets an example of
cruelty and brutality. The lack of discipline and control in the
Panamanian Defense Forces is further evidence that Panama is a
country without a government,'' Cheney said.
   The names of Americans involved in the Panamanian violence were
withheld pending notification of relatives.
   The Panamanian Defense Forces charged that the servicemen had
fired several shots at Noriega's military headquarters, wounding
three Panamanians, including a soldier and an infant.
   Noriega, who is wanted in the United States on drug trafficking
charges, was declared Panama's chief of government Friday by a
rubber-stamp legislature, which declared Panama in a ``state of
war'' with the United States.
   The United States has imposed severe economic sanctions on
Panama in a bid to force the ouster of Noriega. It recently
announced it is banning Panamanian-flag commercial vessels from
entering U.S. ports.

<HEAD>Conference of Soviet Jews Opens in Moscow</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jewish leaders from across the Soviet Union
gathered Monday for the first major conference since Lenin's time
to create a national council and formally renew ties with the
global Jewish community.
   As the conference opened, about 60 jeering members of the
Russian nationalist Pamyat Society demonstrated across the street
from the Cinema Center and jostled delegates as they attempted to
enter the hall. They waved signs saying, ``Zionists Out of the
U.S.S.R.'' and ``Jews, Get Out of the Union.'' Police stood by, but
did nothing to break up the demonstrators who dispersed after about
an hour, witnesses said.
   The three-day meeting, organized by more than 160 Jewish
organizations in 75 cities, marked the first time since 1920 that
Jewish leaders were allowed to congregate openly to establish a
national organization.
   The country's biggest Jewish group, the Jewish Bund, was founded
by Jewish socialists in 1897 but disbanded in 1920.
   Jewish emigres, deputies from the Soviet parliament and about
150 Jewish leaders from the West were among the 650 people at the
conference in the state-owned Cinema Center in central Moscow.
   ``I never thought I would be back in the Soviet Union or see
Jews meeting in the center of Moscow in an official hall to create
the first national Jewish body,'' said Shmuel Azarkh, who emigrated
in 1981 and lives in Israel.
   Azarkh, an aide to former dissident Natan Sharansky who was
denied a Soviet visa in Israel to attend the conference, said
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms have helped improve life
for Soviet Jews, but have not gone far enough.
   ``When the leader of perestroika does not permit the visa, it
means the country is still far from real democracy,'' he said.
   But, he added: ``This kind of conference will lead the way for
the beginning of a new Jewish community which was destroyed 70
years ago.''
   Leonid Shkolnik, a member of the Congress of People's Deputies
and a former editor in chief of the Jewish newspaper Birobidzhan
Stern, said the conference was an important milestone for the
country's estimated 2 million Jews.
   He said the conference, with one stated goal of ``uniting Soviet
Jews and firmly establishing their roots,'' was long overdue.
   Shkolnik was one of 200 deputies who at the first Congress of
People's Deputies session last summer signed a letter to Gorbachev
demanding that anti-Semitism be put on the agenda of the Congress.
So far, he said, there has been no reply.
   Grigory Kanovich, another national Congress deputy, said the
demonstration outside the hall was deplorable, but that hidden
anti-Semitism was worse.
   ``Pamyat is not dangerous; anonymous anti-Semitism is
dangerous,'' he said. ``Those who don't declare they are
anti-Semites cannot be counted and cannot be controlled.''
   Conference officials said they expect to adopt a resolution
naming representatives to international Jewish groups such as the
World Jewish Congress.
   Anti-Semitism, emigration and the development of Jewish culture
are on the agenda.
   ``This conference will give a new push to Jewish life in the
U.S.S.R., Kanovich said. ``It will let them realize their Jewish
roots.''
   Among the delegates were two members of a group of 15 who have
begun a week-long hunger strike to press demands that Israel issue
them invitations so they can emigrate.
   Igor Torick said he had been waiting more than a year for an
invitation, necessary before Soviets can apply for an exit visa.
   He said it was the right of every Jew ``to return to his
motherland anytime.'' For his group, he said, no invitations were
being issued. ``They are refusing us our rights of life and
return,'' he said.

   In a season when too many smiling cherubs and
sugar plum fairies can make your teeth ache, movie makers are
offering a respite from cheerfulness with the most serious batch of
Christmas films in recent memory.
   Holocaust survivors, a paraplegic Vietnam war veteran and a
platoon of black Civil War soldiers are arriving at theaters for
the holidays.
   Some observers see the blitz of ``message'' films as contrary to
conventional Hollywood wisdom.
   ``It used to be: `You don't open Hamlet at Christmas,' just as
you don't open heavy drama in the summer,'' said Art Murphy, who
follows the industry for the trade paper Daily Variety.
   ``I remember 20 years ago when Columbia opened `In Cold Blood'
at Christmas. It was a great movie. But did people really want to
say `Merry Christmas, let's go see the family get slaughtered?'''
   Others see the season differently.
   Paul Mazursky, whose ``Enemies _ A Love Story'' has been touted
as the movie to watch at Oscar time, says his interpretation of an
Isaac Bashevis Singer story about Holocaust survivors in Coney
Island was planned for a Christmas release from the outset.
   ``You can't expect movies like `Enemies' to open like, `Back to
the Future,''' he said. ``But it's having very emotional responses
and there's no reason it won't be popular.'''
   ``Enemies'' isn't the only Christmas film with a
Holocaust-related theme. ``Triumph of the Spirit,'' in which Willem
Dafoe survives Auschwitz by boxing to entertain his Nazi
tormentors, has opened to plaudits. And ``Music Box,'' starring
Jessica Lange as an attorney who defends her father against war
crimes allegations, opens in selected theaters on Christmas Day
with wide distribution in January.
   ``You find there is a much more mature audience going to films
now than three or four years ago,'' said Irwin Winkler, who
produced ``Music Box.'' ``They don't want to see `Breakfast Club'
or all those teen-age movies. ... I don't know why that's
happening, but I'm grateful.''
   There is a limited range of lighter fare available _ films like
``We're No Angels'' starring Robert DiNiro and Sean Penn
masquerading as priests, and ``Back to the Future II,'' a
continuation of Michael J. Fox's fantasy adventure. For kids young
and old, there's ``All Dogs Go to Heaven,'' ``The Little Mermaid''
and ``Wizard.''
   Hovering over all Christmas releases is the specter of Oscar.
Many films are ``platformed'' this time of year, meaning they are
released briefly in a few theaters for Oscar consideration.
   ``If you look at the history of films that got nominated, many
of them came out at Christmas,'' said Winkler, who points to his
own ``Raging Bull'' as an example.
   One very tough movie that made it at Christmas was the
Oscar-winning Vietnam War saga ``Platoon.'' The same
producing-directing team of Alex Kitman Ho and Oliver Stone brings
us this season's ``Born On The Fourth of July,'' possibly the
toughest movie of this year. Tom Cruise stars as a decorated
veteran who lost the use of his legs and came home to lead the
anti-Vietnam War movement as well as the crusade for veterans'
rights.
   Ho said a newly grown-up audience helps such films succeed.
   ``The baby-boom generation has matured. They are the core
audience,'' said Ho, citing the success of ``Field of Dreams'' and
``Dead Poets Society'' as a harbinger of the changing American
appetite for films.
   ``Serious movies do very well with the baby boomers. They have
grown up and they have more time to go to the movies.''
   Even satires such as ``War of the Roses'' and ``She-Devil'' have
a hard edge this season. They are black comedies about bitter
divorce and revenge.
   Perhaps the hardest sell of any Christmas movie was ``Driving
Miss Daisy,'' the adaptation of a Pulitzer Prize-winning play with
Jessica Tandy as a Jewish Southern matron and Morgan Freeman as her
black chauffeur.
   ``Nobody wanted to make this movie,'' said Lili Zanuck, who
produced it with her husband, Richard. ``We were turned down by
everybody.'' Even Warner Bros., which eventually took it on, turned
it down twice, she said.
   Early reviews were positive, and the National Board of Review, a
15-member organization of the nation's leading film critics, named
it best film of 1989.
   ``Glory,'' the story of the first platoon of black Civil War
soldiers, is being released on a limited basis with a larger run
planned in January.
   ``Audiences now are more inclined to spend their time in a
theater thinking rather than watching bubble gum movies,'' said its
producer, Freddie Fields. ``They are more sophisticated and they're
getting their fill of fluff. You can only have so many cupcakes
before you don't want another cupcake.''

   The resting place of Nobel Peace Prize winner and
human rights champion Andrei D. Sakharov is Vostryakovskoye
Cemetery, Moscow's largest.
   It is a sprawling 19th century cemetery set amid pine trees in
southwestern Moscow.
   Sakharov's coffin was lowered into a grave Monday in a plot
beside that of his mother-in-law, Ruth Bonner.
   The cemetery is at the crossroads of the Borovskoye Highway and
Moscow Ring Road at the city limit. Historically, it was the
graveyard of the Vostryakovo village and became a Moscow city
cemetery in 1932. It was expanded in 1963 to its current size of
370 acres.
   Among those buried in the cemetery are marshals, generals,
academicians and honored Soviet citizens. It is divided into
Russian and Jewish sections, and also contains graves of people of
mixed nationalities.
   Mrs. Bonner was a Stalin-era political prisoner who died in
Moscow at age 87 in 1987. Also nearby is the grave of Mrs. Bonner's
son, Igor Alikhanov, an officer in the Soviet merchant marine who
died in 1976 at the age of 49.

   Police today removed a suspected bomb delivered
to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals building, two days after
a package bomb killed one of the court's judges at his home in
Alabama, authorities said.
   ``There could be a significant connection between the two
packages,'' said Jim Holland, postal inspector at Birmingham, Ala.,
where authorities are investigating the blast Saturday that killed
Judge Robert S. Vance.
   Two flak-jacketed police officers removed a package in a bomb
disposal container from the court building today. Employees were
evacuated from the building and sent home for the day.
   Maj. W.W. Holley said the device appeared to be a pipe bomb and
was discovered during a random sample of the morning mail. The
package measured about 10 inches by 10 inches by 4 inches and was
wrapped in brown paper, he said.
   In Birmingham, FBI agent Allen Whitaker said agents and postal
inspectors were sent to Atlanta ``because of the apparent
similarity between the devices.''
   Whitaker said the Atlanta package was addressed to ``someone in
the court system.'' He would not give the name or say where the
package was postmarked.
   ``This is a fast-breaking lead,'' he added.
   The 11th Circuit, which has 12 judges plus six in
semi-retirement, hears cases from Florida, Georgia and Alabama.
Vance worked in Birmingham.
   Federal judges around the country had been advised after Vance's
death not to open packages received in the mail until they could be
inspected.
   The FBI said it was giving top priority to finding out who
mailed the bomb that killed Vance, the third federal judge to be
assassinated in 10 years. The three are believed to be the only
federal jurists killed this century.
   FBI agents said the search for Vance's killer was aided by a
hospital bed interview Sunday with his wife, Helen, who was listed
today in serious but stable condition with wounds suffered in the
explosion at his home in Birmingham's most exclusive suburb.
   Vance, 58, who fought for racial moderation and progressive
stands in Alabama during 11 years as state chairman of the
Democratic Party, was killed instantly when the package, shoe
box-size and wrapped in brown paper, blew up, police said.
   Authorities said Vance had received no threats on his life
before the explosion and hadn't requested protection.
   On speculation of a possible connection to drug cases Vance may
have handled, FBI spokesman Tom Moore said Sunday, ``It is not
being ruled out, but it is no more prominent than several other
avenues we are following. We are reviewing his full caseload.''
   The head of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration office
in Miami discounted any link between the bombing and drug cartels.
``It's pretty far-fetched if someone says it's drug connected,''
said Tom Cash.
   Vance was appointed to the federal appeals court in 1977.
   ``As a member of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, they heard
many appeal cases related to drugs from Miami,'' said Sen. Howell
Heflin, D-Ala., a longtime friend of Vance. ``There's speculation
in that regard, but nobody knows.''
   Authorities said the 11th Circuit caseload was varied, although
most cases were drug related. Vance took several controversial
stances, including:
   _In 1985, he told an attorney seeking to block the deportations
of about 1,500 Cuban refugees that the ``government can keep the
detainees in the Atlanta pen until they die.''
   _Later that year, he was on a panel that cleared the way for
prosecution of Ku Klux Klansmen in a bloody 1979 confrontation with
black civil rights marchers in Decatur.
   But investigators said the attack might have been unrelated to
his work. In the nearby suburb of Hoover, about six pipe bombs were
left in mailboxes of residents during the past year, The New York
Times reported today, citing unidentified FBI officials. Only one
of the bombs detonated, injuring the person thought to have planted
it, but authorities said they could have been lethal, according to
the newspaper.
   One recipient, Chriss Doss, was a former associate of Vance in
the Alabama Democratic Party, the Times said.
   Within 24 hours of Vance's death, William M. Dempsey, a
spokesman for the U.S. Marshal's Service in Washington, said
marshals around the country were notified by wire to contact each
of the 1,500 federal judges or magistrates in their jurisdiction.
   Moore said all members of the federal judiciary may request
special security.
   U.S. District Judge Marvin Shoob of Atlanta said marshals
advised him not to open packages unless he knew who was sending
them. He said they called later and advised him not to open any
packages at all.
   ``We all think this isn't going to happen to us. When it does,
you realize everyone is exposed,'' he said.
   Whitaker said all 50-plus FBI agents in the area were involved
in the case, which was called the bureau's most important
investigation.
   Mrs. Vance spoke with investigators and ``provided information
that will be helpful,'' Whitaker said.
   The bomb caused substantial damage to the kitchen area, Moore
said. ``Indications are that it was delivered by regular U.S.
mail,'' not special delivery, Moore added.
   The two other federal judges slain were U.S. District Judge
Richard Daronco, 56, who was shot and killed at his suburban New
York home in May 1988, and U.S. District Judge John H. Wood Jr.,
63, who was killed by a sniper outside his home in San Antonio,
Texas, in 1979.
   Both assassinations were connected to cases the judges handled.
   Moore said Mrs. Vance, who received lacerations and internal
injuries from the explosion, and other members of her family are
being guarded. The couple, married 36 years, had two sons, Robert
S. Jr., a Birmingham lawyer, and Charles, a medical student and
Ph.D. candidate in psychology at Duke University.

   Two U.S. Air Force F-16 fighters
collided in flight near a densely populated area today, sending one
of the jets crashing into a market and killing one pilot, officials
said.
   There were no reports of injuries on the ground.
   Spokesman Doug Moore said from the U.S. Air Force headquarters
in Ramstein that one pilot was taken to a U.S. Army hospital and
that his condition was not known.
   Moore said the fate of the pilot of the second aircraft had not
been determined. However, local police said in a statement released
to the news media that the second pilot was killed.
   No names were released. The pilots were the only crewmembers in
the planes at the time of the crash.
   Moore said the planes collided during a training flight at about
4:20 p.m. near Ludwigshafen, about 60 miles southwest of Frankfurt.
   ``Initial reports are that there were no injuries or casualties
on the ground,'' the spokesman told The Associated Press.
   Police in Ludwigshafen said one of the planes crashed into a
wholesale vegetable market. Hesse state radio said that a dozen
people were in the market at the time.
   The police statement said the second plane crashed several miles
away in the town of Bobenheim-Roxheim.
   No other details were immediately available.

   Shivering people were moved from under tattered
blankets by police and city officials who said they would enforce
trespassing laws if the homeless return to their makeshift camp
under a downtown freeway.
   Most bundled up meager belongings Saturday and agreed to be
taken to indoor shelters. Others from the group of about a dozen
walked off, saying they would return.
   If they do, they will be given a second chance to find other
shelter, or they will be jailed for trespassing, said Bob Dean,
director of the mayor's citizen assistance office.
   ``It's damn cold under here. They shouldn't be here,'' Dean
said, adding that many of the campers need help for alcohol, drug
or medical problems.
   Dean said a lack of toilet facilities under the freeway is
causing a health hazard, and that the small fires the campers set
could spread.

   More than 1,000 pieces of Christmas mail
were destroyed in four post office fires that officials said were
the work of arsonists.
   Flammable liquid was poured into mail slots and ignited Sunday
morning, burning almost all the contents, police and fire officials
said. Several grass fires also were set in this suburb between
Dallas and Fort Worth.
   ``They're all arson. We're dead sure of that. The same person or
persons did all of these,'' said Stephen Lea, deputy fire marshal.
   Postmaster Mike Larntz said 1,000 to 2,000 pieces of mail were
destroyed.
   ``Anyone who dropped mail in those boxes after the last
collection should consider that mail gone,'' Larntz said. ``Any
salvageable mail, anything we can identify, we will make an attempt
to send anything back to the sender or receiver.''
   No injuries were reported. Damage to each of the post offices
was estimated at $5,000, not counting the mail.
   Walls, glass and ceilings were burned at the four post office
buildings, Larntz said. One was closed Monday because of fire
damage, he said.

   The U.S. Forest Service will try using
goats instead of herbicides to control vegetation in the Ouachita
National Forest.
   Fifty billy goats will graze on 20 acres in the first year of
the four-year project on the north side of the Blue Ouachita
Mountain near the north fork of the Ouachita River. The goats will
graze annually from April to October.
   Using goats has ``the connotation of being a little bit weird
and off-the-wall idea,'' said Jerry Ingersoll, forester for the
Jessieville Ranger District. ``And it's certainly got some risk
involved. We don't know whether or not it will work, really.''
   Among the unknown factors, he said, is whether the goats will
eat only the hardwoods and leave the pines.
   Ingersoll is part of a Forest Service team that will oversee the
project, a joint effort with the American Institute for Goat
Research at Langston University in Oklahoma.
   Dogs will protect the goats, all castrated adults, from
predators and an electric fence will keep them within the area.

<BYLINE>By PETER MUELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fernando Collor de Mello, a young
and wealthy state governor reared in a tradition of bloody
political feuds, ran for the national presidency on a platform of
``Christian reform'' and clean government.
   He was born Aug. 12, 1949, into a powerful clan in Alagoas, a
poor northeastern coastal state dominated by sugar barons and known
for violent politics.
   His father, Arnon de Mello, who served as governor and senator,
shot and killed a colleague in 1963 during a dispute on the Senate
floor. His grandfather, Lindolfo Collor, was labor minister under
dictator Getulio Vargas, who ruled from the 1930s until the early
1950s.
   Collor de Mellow spent his childhood in Rio de Janeiro, then the
family moved to Brasilia, the new inland capital, where he became
city karate champion in 1969.
   Later, he returned to Alagoas to run the family's Gazeta media
group, which includes a newspaper, a television station, three
radio stations and a publishing house.
   In 1975, he married Rio heiress and socialite Lilibeth Monteiro
de Carvalho, with whom he had two children. They divorced, and in
1984 he married Rosane Malta, from another wealthy Alagoas family.
   His political career began in the 1970s, when he joined the
Arena Party of the military regime that governed Brazil from 1964
to 1985.
   Largely because of his father's connections, Collor de Mello was
appointed mayor of Maceio, capital of Alagoas state, in 1979. He
was elected to Congress three years later for the Social Democratic
Party, the new name taken by Arena.
   He surprised party colleagues in 1984 by supporting a
constitutional amendment for direct presidential elections, after
millions of Brazilians demonstrated in favor of it. The amendment
lost.
   Collor de Mello backed the military party's candidate for
president, Paulo Maluf, in 1985. Maluf lost to opposition candidate
Tancredo Neves, who died before taking office, and vice president
elect Jose Sarney became president.
   In 1986, Collor de Mello switched to Sarney's Brazilian
Democratic Movement party and was elected governor of Alagoas. He
split with Sarney last year, quit the party and began his run for
president after forming the National Reconstruction Party.
   To describe himself, Collor de Mello uses the terms ``Christian
reformer'' and ideologically left of center. Opponents call him
``the new face of the right'' and a ``test-tube candidate''
manufactured by conservative media interests.
   Conservatives were attracted by Collor de Mello's pro-business
ideas, but he also captured the mass imagination.
   While serving as governor, he gained national attention by
refusing to pay the high salaries of an elite group of civil
servants, popularly known as ``maharajahs.'' Although they seldom
showed up for duty, some had been collecting $10,000 a month by
holding two or three government jobs at once.
   His decision struck a chord with Brazilians, most of whom were
earned the equivalent of about $25 a week.
   The clean-government crusade was the heart Collor de Mello's
presidential campaign. He also was a fierce critic of Sarney, whom
many Brazilians blame for corruption in high places and annual
inflation of 1,500 percent.
   At one point, Collor de Mello called Sarney a ``corrupt,
second-rate politician.''
   As a candidate, he made crowd-pleasing promises to sell the
limousines of high officials and Brasilia mansions of government
ministers, and to close the feared National Intelligence Service.
   On many issues, however, Collor de Mello was vague.
   He described Brazil's $110 billion foreign debt, largest in the
Third World, is ``unpayable'' but said he would merely limit annual
payments to foreign banks, not stop them.
   Collor de Mello said one way to bring the debt under control was
to withdraw government guarantees on loans for state-run companies
and state governments.
   ``I don't intend to welsh or declare a moratorium,'' he said.
``I want to play within the rules. Withdrawing federal guarantees
will send a signal to creditors that will promote a broad
renegotiation.''
   Critics say Collor de Mello's record belies his claims of
fighting corruption.
   As governor, he made a settlement considered overly generous in
a tax dispute with Alagoas sugar barons, and appointed thousands of
people to state jobs just before resigning to run for president.
   The Justice Ministry ordered federal police to investigate. No
progress in the case had been reported by election day.

<HEAD>Growing Number of Endangered Cranes Flock to Winter Home</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A record number of endangered whooping
cranes, 146, have made the 2,500-mile annual journey from Canada to
the National Wildlife Refuge.
   ``Yes, we are ecstatic,'' refuge manager Brent Giezentanner said
recently.
   The 5-foot birds with snow-white plumes flocked from Wood
Buffalo National park in Alberta, Canada, to the Austwell refuge
along the Texas coast. Last year's flock consisted of 138 cranes.
   The whooping crane population has increased almost tenfold since
a low point in 1941, when 14 birds and two chicks were spotted on
refuge land. Since then, the population has slowly increased.
   Bird watchers and biologists credit public awareness and
protection of natural habitats in Canada and Texas with helping to
nurture the flock.
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized creations of the
Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in 1936 when it was discovered
only 14 adult cranes and four chicks were left in the species. It
also was discovered then that the Texas peninsula, covered with
blackjack oaks, was the birds' only known winter feeding area.

   President Bush scoffed Monday at a published
report that Colombian drug lords are putting up $30 million to have
him killed, saying it won't keep him from attending a drug summit
in Colombia in February.
   ``I wish they would bring the source in so we could take a look
at it,'' Bush told reporters during a year-end interview. ``There's
nothing to it.''
   Newsweek magazine, in its Dec. 25 issue, quotes an unidentified
State Department official as saying intelligence reports found the
drug cartels tried to recruit Mideast terrorists to kill the
president.
   ``I've got total confidence in our security people,'' Bush said.
``I'm not going to do anything reckless ... we've got outstanding
Secret Service people. And let me take this opportunity to reassure
the American people we will not unduly risk anyone's life here.''
   As the questioning continued, Bush retorted:
   ``Nobody has to go but me. I'm the only one that's invited. So
where do you get this `we' stuff?''
   A reporter asked if Bush will be responsible if anyone is hurt.
Many people, including reporters and photographers, travel with the
president.
   Bush suggested that perhaps stringers _ local reporters who work
part-time for out-of-town media outlets _ should substitute for the
White House press on the trip.
   ``People are also concerned about you and they think there's no
such thing as a guarantee in this life,'' the reporter persisted.
   ``But you can't walk out to the drug store with that approach,''
said Bush. ``I'm not going to live in a cocoon.''
   Reminded that there had been 250 bombings in Colombia in three
months, the president said:
   ``You're trying to send a message that we want to support the
president of Colombia,'' Virgilio Barco. ``He is a brave man. He is
fighting our fight for us as well as for his own people and I don't
want to sent a timorous signal to him. ...
   ``I have responsibilities not to do anything imprudent regarding
the presidency and I will fulfill those. But I also have
responsibilities to try to support a courageous person who has
risked a great deal to fight a fight in which we all have
tremendous interest.''

   After two decades of virulent
attacks on dissidents and reformers, the Communist Party's daily
newspaper apologized Monday to ``all those who were hurt'' on its
pages.
   ``Over the past years our paper printed a number of stories
which our editors cannot be proud of,'' Rude Pravo's new editor,
Zdenek Porybny, wrote in a commentary.
   He admitted that ``serious political debate was abandoned in
favor of personal attacks and the scandalization of people whose
opinions differed from those of the Communist leadership.''
   The newspaper tried to discredit Alexander Dubcek, the leader of
the failed ``Prague Spring'' reforms of 1968, and former dissident
Vaclav Havel, now a leading presidential candidate.
   ``Stories like `Stool Pigeon', `Who is Vaclav Havel,' `Dubcek's
Journey From Tragedy to Farce' and others did not express ... the
(true) attitudes of most of the paper's editors,'' according to the
commentary.
   In July, Rude Pravo accused Dubcek of ``naive blindness,'' and
of being a figure whose words were ``full of megalomania.''
   One frequent tactic by the newspaper was to imply that its
targets had fascist links.
   In one of its articles, Rude Pravo recounted that a ballroom in
central Prague built by Havel's family was used by the Nazis during
the occupation in World War II.
   ``An apology to all those who were hurt on the pages of Rude
Pravo is appropriate and on the behalf of the paper's editors and
myself ... I am doing just that,'' Porybny said.
   Porybny replaced Zdenek Horeni as editor-in-chief of the paper
in a leadership reshuffle that followed a month of sweeping
political change.
   It is just one of several changes in Czechoslovakia's
state-controlled media. A new editor has taken charge of the state
news agency CTK, former government spokesman Miroslav Pavel has
moved to head state TV, and a new editor-in-chief also has been
appointed at state radio.
   Czechoslovakia's opposition has forced an end to Communist
domination in the government and the reforms have swept through the
media, which now criticize the mistakes of the previous hard-line
Communist leadership.
   But a statement issued Monday by Rude Pravo editors fired after
the 1968 ``Prague Spring'' reforms said the changes are not enough.
   ``As long as the paper does not say goodbye to people whose
names have become symbols of an ignorant policy of force, stupidity
and total professional failure, and as long as the paper is not
credible, it will do more harm than good to progressive forces in
the (Communist) party,'' the statement concluded.
   Pavel, who has overseen drastic changes at that have brought
long-banned artists and exiled politicians and others back onto the
TV screen after 20 years, said last week he is also fighting
demands for even more change, particularly in the news department.
   Sources at state TV say its reporters are seeking the
resignation of at least eight editors deemed to have been too
active in pushing the old policies in the past.

   A moderate earthquake struck the
Hollister area Monday, but no damage or injuries were reported.
   The quake, at 9:07 a.m., measured 4.1 on the Richter scale and
was centered in an area 13 miles south-southeast of Hollister, the
U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in the strength of the shaking. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an
earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.
   On Oct. 17, a major quake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale
struck Northern California, killing 67 people, injuring about 3,000
and causing $7 billion in damage.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage.

<TEXT>
   Conservatives on Monday tried to roll back
political reform with an attempt to restore the Communist Party's
100 guaranteed seats in the Congress of People's Deputies.
   The Congress' legislative arm, the Supreme Soviet, voted several
months ago to remove a section of the Constitution allocating
one-third of the 2,250 Congressional seats to certain social
organizations, including the Communist Party and the Young
Communist League, known as the Komsomol. Instead, all deputies
would have to face public election in a territorial district.
   The constitutional change must be confirmed by the full
Congress, however, and that is where representatives of the
organizations fought to keep their privileged position.
   If the reform wins final approval, President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev would have to run in his first election campaign in 1994
if he wants to retain the presidency when his current five-year
term expires.
   He would have to run only in one local district, like British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, because the Congress elects the
president from among its members.
   Although a vote was taken on the issue Monday, many deputies
were confused, and they wound up sending the issue back to
committee overnight. Some deputies apparently thought the 1,740 to
98 decision meant social organizations would lose their seats,
while other deputies thought it meant just the opposite.
   The decision will affect both the national Congress and the
parliaments of the republics. Most republics chose direct,
territorial elections, but Byelorussia and Kazakhstan already have
begun nominations from social organizations.
   Deputy Anatoly Sobchak said the system of electing deputies from
social organizations violated ``the most important principle of
election rights _ the principle of one man, one vote.''
   Under this system, for example, a female Communist scientist
could vote for deputies representing the Communist Party, the
Academy of Sciences, the national women's society and the district
where she lives.
   Many deputies representing such organizations took the
microphone to argue the system should remain in place. Many claimed
it was necessary to guarantee representation of invalids, the Red
Cross and other relief organizations. They did not mention that the
primary beneficiary of the system is the Communist Party.
   An exasperated Sobchak responded, ``Don't make our country the
laughingstock of the world. I fear that if we take this decison,
arguing that it will help invalids, then people will begin to call
us an invalid state.''
   Deputy Ilya Zaslavsky, who walks with a cane and was elected on
a program of invalids' rights, argued that many organizations were
not even on the list guaranteed representation in the Congress.
   Therefore, he argued, all organizations should compete for seats
in territorial-based elections.

<HEAD>State Supreme Court To Hear Appeal In Landlord Discrimination Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Minnesota Supreme Court has agreed to
hear the appeal of a landlord accused of discrimination for denying
housing to an unmarried couple.
   ``As I see it, this is one of the most important First Amendment
issues in the country,'' said James Anderson, attorney for landlord
Layle French.
   Anderson argues that some forms of discrimination ``are good.''
   ``I'm very encouraged by the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the
case,'' Anderson said Monday.
   French, 33, was fined $1,048 in June by an administrative law
judge who decided he violated the state's anti-discrimination law
when he reneged on an agreement he made in February 1988 to rent
his house in Marshall to Sue Parsons.
   Parsons had said she intended to live in the house with her
fiance, and French later decided that would be against his
religion. The couple now are married.
   French is a member of the Marshall Evangelical Free Church, an
independent Christian church.
   The state Court of Appeals rejected French's appeal. Anderson
said the Appeals Court panel ruled that the state's compelling
interest to eliminate discrimination was enough to override
French's religious belief.
   ``The court of appeals didn't go far enough,'' Anderson said.
``You have to look at the sort of discrimination. If it's
discrimination against race, or women, or a physical handicap, then
yes, religion should not override those.
   ``But other forms of discrimination are good. Layle is
discriminating against what many people view as immoral.''
   Stephen Cooper, the state commissioner of Human Rights, said
French overlooks the fact that his action violated Parsons'
religious freedom.
   ``The biggest threat here is Mr. French imposing his religious
beliefs on tenants,'' Cooper said. ``He stands for the lack of
religious freedom. That's exactly what we fled the rest of the
world for 200 years ago.''
   Peter Popovich, chief justice of the state Supreme Court, said
he did not know when the case would come up.

<TEXT>
   Eleven years ago, police shot to
death two independence advocates on a desolate mountaintop,
sparking a case compared to the Watergate scandal and an
investigation that still goes on.
   The island's governor at the time hailed the police as heroes,
but it was later determined the two young nationalists surrendered
and were shot while pleading for mercy, not in a shootout with
officers.
   The killings and subsequent cover-up led to the imprisonment of
10 police officers and contributed to the fall of a government.
   The case _ known as Cerro Maravilla after the mountain in
southern Puerto Rico where the killings occurred _ is the subject
of a film to be released next year.
   The movie, which stars Amy Irving, Robert Duvall and Lou Diamond
Phillips, was filmed in Puerto Rico last summer.
   Samuel Dash, who was the chief counsel to the Senate Watergate
Committee, said Cerro Maravilla ranks with Watergate for its
``breach of basic rights for citizens'' and degree of official
cover-up.
   Dash, a special adviser to the Puerto Rico Senate's
investigation of the killings, said in an interview from Washington
``there is belief police had support all the way up.''
   Investigations continue to this day into whether the previous
island government and the U.S. Justice Department conspired to
suppress the truth.
   Sen. Marcos A. Rigau, chairman of the Puerto Rico Senate
Judiciary Committee, said he expects the case to be resolved in
1990 with new evidence. Senate hearings are expected to resume in
June or July.
   Carlos Romero Barcelo, who was governor when the killings
occurred, has called the continuing investigation a ``political
witch hunt'' spearheaded by Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon. The
governor's pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party controls the
Senate, which is carrying out the inquiry.
   Police claimed the two nationalists, Carlos Soto Arrivi, 18, and
Arnaldo Dario Rosado, 24, went to Cerro Maravilla on July 25, 1978,
to blow up a 400-foot TV transmission tower. They said the two
refused to surrender and were killed in a shootout.
   That account was upheld in two federal grand jury inquiries and
two Puerto Rico Justice Department investigations spanning five
years.
   But questions raised by Senate President Miguel Hernandez Agosto
and two reporters for The San Juan Star, Manuel Suarez and Tomas
Stella, cast doubt on the official version.
   Taxi driver Julio Ortiz Molina, who was abducted by the
nationalists on their way to the mountain, revealed that the two
men were captured after an exchange of gunfire. He said he later
heard a second volley of shots.
   In 1983, three police officers who had turned state's evidence
provided a riveting account of the killings during televised Senate
hearings.
   They said Soto Arrivi and Dario Rosado surrendered and were
beaten and then shot by three police officers at close range while
on the ground pleading for their lives.
   The revelation was a key reason Romero Barcelo lost his
re-election bid in 1984. He had maintained police acted in
self-defense and had been ``heroic.''
   The killings occurred during a turbulent period in which
pro-independence groups had carried out a flurry of bombings in
their campaign to end Puerto Rico's status as a U.S. commonwealth.
   Eventually, 10 police officers were convicted on various
charges, including second-degree murder, conspiracy and perjury,
and sentenced to prison terms ranging from six to 30 years.
   It remains unclear why Soto Arrivi and Dario Rosado went to
Cerro Maravilla.
   Alejandro Gonzalez Malave, a police agent who infiltrated the
small band of reputed terrorists calling themselves the Armed
Revolutionary Forces, notified police they were planning to blow up
the tower, but no explosives were found.
   Gonzalez Malave was facing perjury charges in April 1986 when he
was gunned down outside his mother's house. The separatist group
Los Macheteros claimed responsibility.

   Friends have mourned a young immigrant who
was abducted during a drive-in movie date and then raped and slain,
and donors are paying to return her body to her homeland.
   The Rev. Luis Valbuena addressed more than 1,000 parishioners
Sunday at Holy Family parish in Wilmington, where 20-year-old Irene
Franco often prayed.
   ``How can we have tragic incidents like the case of Irene in our
midst? It's not human,'' the Roman Catholic priest said. ``But even
animals kill only in self-defense or because they have to eat. They
don't kill like this.''
   There had been no arrests as of Monday in what authorities said
was an apparently random attack. There was no sign that drugs or
gangs were involved, said Los Angeles County sheriff's Detective
Joe Barnes.
   Valbuena said Ms. Franco's father, Roberto Franco, suffered a
mild heart attack after learning about her death. Franco had
planned to oversee the return of his daughter's body to
Guadalajara, Mexico, Valbuena said.
   The priest said anonymous donors contributed money to pay for
the return of Ms. Franco's body. A funeral home in Guadalajara
planned to pay the cost of burial, Valbuena said.
   Authorities said Ms. Franco, who had been living in nearby
Wilmington for about a year, was watching a drive-in movie with her
boyfriend, Jesus Martinez, when they were kidnapped at gunpoint
Friday.
   Martinez, 26, a Gardena construction worker, told authorities
that three men commandeered their car at gunpoint, tied them up and
drove them to an alley, where they took turns beating Martinez with
a board and beating and raping Ms. Franco.
   Martinez called authorities from a pay telephone after the men
drove off with Ms. Franco.
   Before leaving, they shouted something like, ``Don't worry about
your girlfriend. we'll drop her off in a few minutes,'' sheriff's
Deputy Dean Scoville said.
   A 13-year-old boy found Ms. Franco's body Saturday morning
several miles from the drive-in in Carson, 17 miles south of Los
Angeles. She had been shot in the head. The couple's car was found
burned near Watts.

   President Bush today wished the nation a
joyous Hanukkah and a Merry Christmas.
   To Jews, who begin celebrating the eight days of Hanukkah at
sundown Friday, Bush recalled that the holiday commemorates a great
victory won by the Jewish Maccabees in their struggle to worship
freely in their own way.
   ``This year, as Jews around the world pause to observe this
festival, all of us can share in the joy of those people who are
just beginning to enjoy success in their own struggle for freedom
and self-determination,'' Bush said.
   He told Christians that the promise of the first Christmas
continues to give a sense of peace and purpose.
   ``It is daily acts of goodness and generosity, performed time
and time again throughout the year, that hold the true meaning of
this holy season.
   ``Every kind and selfless deed we perform for others can
rekindle in our hearts and in our communities the light of that
first Christmas,'' Bush said.

   CBS today named Hollywood movie executive Jeff
Sagansky as president of its last-place entertainment division.
   Sagansky, the 37-year-old president of Tri-Star Pictures and a
former top programming executive at NBC, succeeds Kim LeMasters,
who resigned Nov. 30 after two seasons as CBS Entertainment
president.
   He will be the chief programmer for a once-dominant network that
has been third in prime time ratings for two consecutive seasons,
has had not hits since ``Murder, She Wrote'' in 1984, and is
expected to be third again when the this season ends.
   Sagansky already has been looking at CBS programming on an
unofficial basis.
   In a statement, CBS Broadcast Group president Howard Stringer
said Sagansky ``has earned the respect and admiration of the
Hollywood entertainment community.''
   CBS had considered him for the job in 1987 before deciding on
the executive he now will succeed.
   Sagansky was wooed again after CBS unsuccessfully last week
tried to lure to its vacant job a top TV production team, Marcy
Carsey and Tom Werner, whose company makes NBC's ``The Cosby Show''
and ABC's ``Roseanne.''
   Sagansky joined Tri-Star from NBC in 1985 and had been in his
current job there since March.

   Gov. Rose Mofford awaited surgery today to remove
her gallbladder.
   The 67-year-old Democrat had been admitted to the cardiac unit
at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center with chest pain Sunday,
but tests found no heart trouble, doctors said. Instead, she was
found to be suffering from a gallbladder attack and gallstones.
   The operation, which could last up to three hours, was to begin
around noon, said Dr. Victor Zannis, her surgeon. He said there is
``over a 90 percent chance that she's going to be just fine'' and
that the average hospital stay after the operation is seven to 10
days.
   The hospital said the governor was in stable condition and had
slept well. Dr. Michael Altman, a gastroenterologist, said she was
in some pain.
   Mrs. Mofford's doctors said they didn't know what caused the
attack but that her family had a history of gallbladder and heart
problems.
   Arizona's first woman governor had been secretary of state for
31 years when she succeeded Republican Evan Mecham in 1988 upon his
impeachment and removal by the Legislature.

   Michael Jackson says his hit songs are not his
doing, that he is merely a conduit for tunes already written.
   Jackson made the remarks in a 1984 home video taped in his home
in Encino, Calif. It was scheduled for broadcast Monday night on
``A Current Affair,'' said Jeff Erdel, a spokesman for the
syndicated program.
   In the video, the reclusive star said he feels his songs existed
somewhere else before he wrote them.
   ``I feel I'm just a tunnel, a tube through which they come,''
Jackson said in the video. ``I mean, `Billie Jean' and `Beat It'
and all those songs have been up there somewhere and just came
through to me. So even if I did it, I just can't always take
credit.''
   The video also shows Jackson playing with his pet llamas and
performing scenes from ``Peter Pan.''
   Jackson said he considers children magical.
   ``When I'm around them, I feel more alive, I think, than
anything. I feel like I can do anything,'' he said.

   Actor James Naughton, whose life has taken that
familiar theatrical tour of hard work for years only to be declared
an overnight success, says acting is as much fun as baseball.
   The 44-year-old performer's characterization of a tough-talking
private eye turned him into a star when the Broadway musical ``City
of Angels'' opened last week. Naughton, who has a long list of
stage and film credits, landed a plum Off-Broadway role as early as
1971 in ``Long Day's Journey Into Night'' with Geraldine Fitzgerald
and Stacy Keach.
   He acts, he says, because ``It's a lot of fun. It's the same
kind of fun as when I was a kid. And to be able to continue to do
that, it's sort of like playing baseball. You see these guys who
are 40 years old and they're stilll playing ball and they say, `I'm
the luckiest man in the world to be able to play this kids' game
for so long and so successfully.' And it's the same with acting.''
   Naughton played baseball at Brown University, but gave it up to
do graduate work at the Yale University Drama School.

named by CBS Monday as the president of its troubled entertainment
division.
   Sagansky, president of Tri-Star Pictures and a former top
programming executive at NBC, succeeds Kim LeMasters, who resigned
Nov. 30 after only two seasons as CBS Entertainment president.
   Sagansky will start work Jan. 1 as chief programmer for the
once-dominant network that has been third in prime time ratings for
two consecutive seasons. It has had no hits since ``Murder, She
Wrote'' in 1984, and is expected to be third again when the current
season ends.
   His successor as Tri-Star Pictures president was not announced.
Sagansky joined Tri-Star from NBC in 1985, but had been in his
current job only since March.

   CBS's ``Murphy Brown,'' the television
newswoman portrayed by Candice Bergen, isn't far off the mark but
she needs to work harder, her real-life counterparts say.
   ``Her personal life is fairly apropos of most women in the TV
business. We spend so much time working that by the time we get
home, there's not much left for anything else,'' said NBC ``Today''
show news anchor Deborah Norville, in response to a survey by TV
Guide.
   The portrayal of a ``blonde TV newswoman who's as tough as
nails'' is a breath of fresh reality, said Faith Daniels of ``CBS
This Morning.'' ``There's always some line you hear on the show and
then use. For weeks after Murphy used it, we went around at `This
Morning' saying, `Lighten up. It's only morning TV.'''
   But her professional life isn't all that tough, according to a
couple of pros quoted in the magazine's Dec. 23 issue.
   ``Professionally, Murphy's probably a better interviewer than
many women on TV. She also gets better answers,'' said Linda
Ellerbee, former ABC and NBC news anchor, CNN commentator and now
independent producer. ``As for her easy access to the high and
mighty, I don't have that sort of access, but Barbara Walters
does.''
   Murphy's ``personal life is more on the mark than the
professional part,'' said Lifetime's Jane Wallace. ``Most TV
journalists do much more work than Murphy.''

   Local alumni of the Depression-era
Civilian Conservation Corps are working to preserve the history of
the group that built roads, bridges, dams and parks across the
nation.
   ``We want the nation to know from now to eternity what was done
and show what a mark we made,'' said James Lynn of Jacksonville. He
worked with the CCC in the Ocala National Forest and at Fort Clinch
State Park in Fernandina Beach from 1933 to 1938.
   To make sure Americans remember the work of the 3 million CCC
members, the local chapter of the CCC alumni will spend the next
year compiling material for a book that will list and describe the
work done by the organization.
   The CCC, formed by President Franklin Roosevelt, directed an
army of previously unemployed people who built parks, roads, dams
and sewers, and brought electricity and telephone service to
millions.
   Kark Busch, program director of the local CCC alumni, said no
one has ever produced a complete listing of the corps' works,
although various state and federal agencies have tried.
   It will be a monumental task, he said, noting that in Florida
alone CCC members planted more than 18 million trees and built an
estimated 2,700 bridges.
   The CCC did soil erosion control work on 23 million acres and
strung 89,000 miles of telephone line, developed 80 parks and
contributed 12 million man-days of work in fighting forest fires,
Busch said.
   ``It may take two books because we did so much,'' he said.
   Making the task even more difficult, Busch said, was that
information on obscure projects may have to come from the people
who worked on them.
   Lynn was a farm boy of 17 when he joined the CCC from the
Gainesville area. Busch, then a 16-year-old in New York City, was
sent to Washington state for his CCC work.
   ``It gave many boys a new start and changed their way of
living,'' said Lynn, 74, who became a diesel mechanic after leaving
the CCC. ``I wouldn't trade anything for my experiences in the CCC.
   ``I'd give $1,000 cash to work for a month and be back with the
boys.''

   Four national education groups said Monday
that they support Turner Broadcasting Co.'s commercial-free news
program for classroom use, denouncing rival Channel One because it
carries commercials.
   ``Exploitation of a captive audience in the classroom, using the
classroom and the curriculum as a marketplace for products rather
than a marketplace for ideas, and selling or trading students in a
classroom for a satellite dish or a television monitor are
outrageous breaches of ethical practice,'' Gary Marx, associate
executive director of the American Association of School
Administrators, said about Channel One.
   Marx joined representatives of the National PTA, the National
Association of Secondary School Principals and the National
Education Association at a news conference with Ted Turner,
president of Turner Broadcasting.
   Channel One, produced by Whittle Communications of Knoxville,
Tenn., envisions making and installing up to 300,000 television
sets, 16,000 videocasette recorders and 8,000 satellite dishes at
participating schools. The Turner program does not, and would be
delivered at schools via cable or tape rather than satellite.
   Scott Thompson, executive director of the organization of
principals, said Channel One producers are telling schools, ```You
are going to have to sell the time of your students in your
classroom in order to get this.'''
   ``We think this is ethically wrong,'' Thompson said.
   Thompson said his group had written to all of the companies that
advertise on Channel One explaining its objections. He said some
companies decided not to continue their sponsorship, but he did not
name them.
   Whittle spokesman David Gerard disagreed with the criticism of
the commercials.
   ``We are not introducing advertising to schools,'' Gerard said,
arguing that newspapers and magazines that carry ads long have been
used as teaching tools.
   Jeremiah Floyd, associate executive director of the National
School Boards Association, which announced its support of Turner
Broadcasting's CNN Newsroom in April, reaffirmed its backing but
did not criticize Channel One.
   ``It is a local proposition, and if that's the only game in town
and the local people decide they want to go with that game, then
that's their prerogative,'' Lloyd said.
   Turner said CNN Newsroom, launched in August, had an initial
enrollment of 1,000 schools. That has risen to 5,000, 2{ times the
figure Turner Broadcasting had expected to have by now, he said.
   He said he expected to have 10,000 schools by September.
   Whittle, which plans to launch Channel One nationally in March,
said in November that it had 1,050 schools lined up. The company
has said it hoped to expand to 8,000 schools by the end of 1990.
   Gerard said Whittle will have raised about $200 million in
advertising support for Channel One by the end of the year.
   ``We think the Turner program is pretty good, it's pretty
well-produced, but like the vast majority of great educational
programming, it's not watched. It goes unseen by most students in
this country and the technology is not there to watch it,'' Gerard
said.
   ``When a school signs up for Channel One, they are committed to
showing the program about 90 percent of the time in virtually every
classroom every day,'' he said.
   Turner said about 50 percent to 60 percent of high schools have
cable television available and, in those that don't, teachers can
tape the program, at home when it is broadcast in the early morning
hours.

   Four entrepreneurs are leaving no stone
unturned in their first business venture.
   Rocks of all shapes, sizes and colors are on sale _ when the
weather's nice and not during cartoons _ in this east central
Nebraska community of 480. It's 25 cents for the small ones and 50
cents for the big ones.
   ``We're going to make money to buy Christmas presents,'' said
Greg Bader, 7.
   Greg and his sister, Steph, 8, and neighbors Apryl and Daniel
Gay, were ``digging for gold'' in the the Gays' backyard one day
this fall, but they found no gold, no dinosaur bones _ only rocks,
he said.
   ``Then we decided to sell the rocks,'' said Steph, a
third-grader.
   The four children have what looks to Greg like ``a thousand
billion'' rocks for sale.
   ``Some are so very, very clear that you can see through them,''
said 8-year-old Apryl with one rock up to her eye.
   ``Some look like bubble gum,'' said Daniel, 6, of the ones
painted pink.
   When the weather isn't too cold, the four sit at a table made
from an electrical wire spool in the Gay's front yard, displaying
the loot.
   After gathering the inventory, the children decided it was time
to advertise.
   Palmer Journal Publisher Dale Kirkpatrick said all four of the
young entrepreneurs paid him a visit to ask if they could place an
ad.
   ``They were very businesslike, very serious,'' he said.
   That businesslike demeanor inspired Kirkpatrick to offer a
four-column ad free of charge.
   ``He just told us he'd try and get some customers for us,''
Steph said.
   ``All they knew was that they had to put an ad in the paper in
order to sell their rocks,'' Kirkpatrick said. ``They had no idea
they would normally have to pay for it.''
   When Peg Gay, Apryl and Daniel's mother, heard the children had
tried to place an ad, she thought it would be a good lesson in
economics.
   ``I was going to teach them a lesson,'' Mrs. Gay said. ``I was
going to show them that it costs to put an ad in the paper and that
people don't buy rocks. I suppose they are learning a lesson, but
not the one I intended.''
   Placing the ad has spurred the children to dwell on what they'll
do with the profits, even though they've sold just two rocks in two
weeks.
   ``We might have to get more jars for our money,'' Steph said,
explaining that the blue plastic bear might not be sufficient.
   ``We might have the whole house full of money and have to get a
bigger one,'' Greg said.

   One of Santa's better kept secrets is that
he and his elves surf on Christmas Day when they can get the beach
to themselves.
   Joe Klein's catchy holiday song ``Christmas in Malibu'' about a
forlorn, board-less surfer who gets an unexpected Christmas visit
from the surfing Santa has become the rage along the
celebrity-laden Malibu shores.
   ``Beaches are bare, Ain't no one there,'' begins the Beach
Boys-flavored rendition of the Christmas Day visit of the surfing
Old St. Nick, who proclaims with a hearty ho-ho-ho, ``Surf's up,
Dudes!''
   Klein shipped 7,000 audio cassette tapes to radio stations and
local record stores. The response was phenomenal, said Klein, who
hurriedly produced a video when cable's music channel MTV inquired.
   The lyrics include:
   Then, out of the northern sky comes a sled
   It lands on a swell, guess who's inside?
   St. Nick and his elves
   Wet suits off the shelves
   It's the one day of year
   They get the waves to themselves
   After Santa leaves with a wink and his board washes ashore, the
surfer gets the best waves he's ever seen: ``A gift just for me
from St. Nick.''

<HEAD>Two Reported Killed in Biggest Romanian Protests in Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIOREL URMA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The biggest protests in two years were
reported in Romania, where Nicolae Ceausescu runs the Soviet bloc's
last hard-line regime, and a traveler said Monday at least two
people were killed, including a child.
   An unconfirmed report in the West German media said hundreds
were killed.
   Romania virtually sealed its borders, blocking or restricting
travel from neighboring Hungary, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, and from
other countries, in an apparent effort to curtail reports of the
unrest at Timisoara, western Romania.
   Arriving flights were turned back around at the Bucharest
airport. Bulgarian TV said travelers were held in trains for hours
before being sent back by Romanian border guards.
   In a late evening report, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said
Romanian security forces took full control Monday of Timisoara,
just 30 miles from the Yugoslav border. Ceausescu flew to Iran
earlier in the day for a three-day official visit.
   Premier Miklos Nemeth of Hungary said there were unconfirmed
reports of protests in other Romanian cities and of soldiers being
placed on alert.
   A Yugoslav returning from Romania told The Associated Press
police fired on the protesters and at least two people were killed.
   He said other Yugoslav travelers reported seeing more bodies in
Timisoara after security forces dispersed the largest
anti-government protests since a protest by 10,000 workers at
Brasov in 1987.
   In West Germany, William Toetoek, an ethnic German writer who
immigrated from Romania, was interviewed on Bremen radio and quoted
witnesses in Timisoara as saying 300-400 protesters were killed and
hundreds injured.
   None of the reports of high death tolls could be confirmed.
   Bishop Endre Gyulay of the Roman Catholic diocese of Szeged in
Hungary, which includes Timisoara, told the church news agency
Kathpress, based in Vienna, that 30 or 40 people fled across the
border Monday and reported two deaths, of an old woman and a
29-year-old man
   ``Police and troops moved in quickly,'' the Yugoslav traveler
said, but only police were seen firing on were seen shooting at the
demonstrators.
   ``I saw two dead, including a child, on the streets,'' he said.
Other Yugoslav travelers said soldiers were seen three-deep at main
intersections in Timisoara on Sunday. The official Hungarian news
agency MTI quoted a Czechoslovak, not identified, as saying tanks
were in the streets.
   Resentment has grown against Ceausescu, who has resisted the
liberalization and reform sweeping through Eastern Europe. He has
been Communist Party chief since 1965, and with downfall of other
old guard Communists, has become the longest-serving leader in the
Soviet bloc.
   Ceausescu's crash industrialization program and the domestic
austerity he imposed to repay Romania's $11 billion foreign debt
have caused widespread shortages and food rationing. The pervasive
and feared secret police are the main agency used to keep the
people under control.
   Mihnea Berindei, vice chairman of the Paris-based Romanian
League for Human Rights, said he had reports of police firing on
the demonstrators in Timisoara.
   ``Shots were heard and there were injuries. Ambulances were seen
rushing to and fro,'' he said, quoting witnesses.
   ``There are reports of deaths, but we don't have any figures so
far because the entire area has been virtually isolated ... by the
security forces,'' Berindei said.
   Anti-government protests apparently began after hundreds of
ethnic Hungarians formed a human chain Friday night to prevent the
eviction Friday of the Rev. Laszlo Toekes, a Reformed Church
clergyman who has championed their rights, Berindei said.
   Toekes had been harassed for months by Romanian authorities. He
and his wife, who is pregnant, had remained inside his church since
masked assailants tried to attack him in his neighboring apartment
Nov. 2, Berindei said, again quoting witnesses.
   He said he did not know where Toekes was Monday night.
   Several thousand people, most of them ethnic Romanian students
and workers, protested in downtown Timisoara on Saturday and
briefly occupied the Communist Party headquarters, breaking windows
and smashing furniture, Berindei said.
   They also broke windows of bookstores, and burned the works of
Ceausescu, whose books are prominently displayed, he said.
   Protest continued Sunday, then police and army units intervened
and shots were fired, Berindei said.
   Other unrest preceded the weekend protests, Berindei said,
including a strike Dec. 8 at a truck plant in Brasov, north of
Bucharest, and a student protest before that at hostels in
Bucharest.
   In apparent response to the student action, Ceausescu ordered
Dec. 5 that their monthly stipends be increased by 10 percent, or
about $5 a month.
   Official media did not mention the weekend unrest, devoting
themselves instead to Ceausescu's visit to Iran.
   Emigres said Bucharest radio warned citizens on Sunday to remain
orderly or face serious consequences, which in Romania can include
long jail sentences or forced labor.
   Western diplomats reached by telephone Monday in Bucharest said
the capital appeared calm but the international airport was heavily
guarded.
   Thousands of Yugoslavs normally cross each day to Timisoara to
sell goods to Romanians, but a Yugoslav customs official said the
borders were sealed to all but official traffic.

   Gov. Bob Martinez, whose life has been
threatened by Colombian drug barons, said Monday he will consider
wearing a bulletproof vest following the assassination of an
Alabama federal judge.
   The Florida Department of Law Enforcement has urged the governor
to wear a vest during some public appearances, but Martinez said he
has never felt comfortable in one.
   The governor said he would re-evaluate that stance because of
the weekend mail bombing that killed Robert Vance, an 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals judge, in his home outside Birmingham, Ala.
   Brian Ballard, Martinez's director of operations, said the
governor probably would wear a bulletproof vest ``as a last
resort.''
   ``If there was a specific threat, I think maybe he'd put one
on,'' Ballard said. ``He doesn't feel comfortable that the governor
of the state of Florida should have to wear one of those things.''
   Martinez has taken a leading anti-drug role in organizations
such as the National Governors Association.
   Authorities have not linked drug dealers or the Colombian
cocaine cartels to Vance's killing Saturday. But Martinez has been
threatened previously by drug lords and the bombing drew attention
to the governor's security precautions.
   ``We take into account events like that which just occurred in
Birmingham,'' said FDLE spokesman Mike McHargue. ``We're interested
in this incident.''
   Earlier, authorities disclosed that Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez is
under round-the-clock police protection because of threats
attributed to factions of the Colombia cartel.
   ``We're received information indicating there might be a threat
to several individuals, including the mayor and governor,'' said
Lew Wilson, agent in charge of the Miami FDLE office.
   Security for the governor has been increased twice in recent
months because of the threats and the August arrest of a Miami man
suspected of involvement in a plot to assassinate Martinez.

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new Parliament began its first
session Monday, setting in motion the process for a crucial vote of
confidence that Prime Minister V.P. Singh must seek for his
minority government.
   President Ramaswamy Venkataraman set Jan. 1 as the deadline for
Singh to prove his majority in Parliament when he invited him to
form the government on Dec. 2.
   Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party won more
seats than any single party in the Nov. 22-26 elections _ 193 _ but
fell far short of the 263 needed for an absolute majority.
   Singh's National Front got only 144, but its pledges of
post-election support from right-wing Hindu fundamentalists and a
leftist array of Communists and socialists give it 283 votes _ more
than enough to carry the motion which is likely to come up for vote
Thursday.
   Singh was the first of the 525 members of the Lok Sabha, or
House of the People, to take the oath of allegiance to the
Constitution and sign the roll of legislators.
   Across the floor members of the Congress Party sat in the
opposition benches for only the second time in Indian parliamentary
history.
   Singh's supporters cheered and slapped the palms of their hands
on their tables as he was sworn in. He then walked across and shook
hands with Gandhi.
   As soon as Singh's Cabinet ministers took their oaths, Gandhi
was sworn in to a new burst of cheers.
   Gandhi was surrounded by supporters as he entered the Parliament
building. ``Long live Rajiv Gandhi!'' they chanted as a red and
yellow roses bouquet was thrust into his hands.
   Singh entered the building well ahead of others and before
crowds could gather.
   After he was sworn in, he said he would continue the dialogue
initiated Sunday to find a political solution to Sikh separatism
that has claimed more than 7,000 lives in Punjab in the past eight
years.
   Sikh militants elected to the new Parliament did not take the
oath Monday, but a militant spokesman said they will do so Thursday.
   Spokesman Gurtej Singh Brar said in Punjab's capital of
Chandigarh that Sikh militant members will vote for Singh when the
motion seeking confidence in Singh's government is put to vote.
   ``We shall not let the government fall,'' he said.
   For the first time Sikh militants, who are campaigning for an
independent homeland in Punjab state, have entered the national
political mainstream by winning Parliament seats in the election.
Militants won six of the 13 seats in Punjab. Three independents
backed by the militants also were elected.
   Singh ousted Gandhi from the prime minister's job on a platform
of clean government and vows to repair the cracks in the country's
religious harmony.

<HEAD>NATO Reports Sees Beginning of Cuts in Soviet Defense Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union appears to have begun
cutting its defense expenditures, including in the critical area of
conventional forces, according to a new NATO study released Monday.
   The analysis by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization offers
new evidence that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is trying
to pare the nation's massive military industry.
   ``While NATO remains highly skeptical regarding Soviet claims
for their defense expenditures, it appears that the Soviet Union is
indeed beginning to trim its defense outlays,'' said the study, a
copy of which was approved last month by the ambassadors of the 16
alliance nations. It was made available by the U.S. mission to NATO.
   A year ago, Gorbachev went before the United Nations and
promised to cut unilaterally Soviet military forces by 500,000
troops and reduce conventional arms substantially. A month later,
he called for a 14.2 percent cut in military spending and a 19.5
percent reduction in military production.
   The nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and those
of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact are negotiating in Vienna to reduce
tanks, armored personnel carriers and other conventional weapons in
Europe. The West wants to slash what it sees as the Soviets'
enormous superiority in these arms.
   In the report, NATO analysts said that in line with Gorbachev's
U.N. speech, ``the Soviet Union is reducing the size of its
conventional forces.''
   ``A number of major procurement programs, particularly in the
land armaments area, are being scaled back,'' it said. It added,
however, that it was too early to tell whether all of Gorbachev's
promises would be carried out.
   The report did not give specific figures for defense cutbacks.
   Soviet officials say their military budget for next year will be
$114.8 billion, off 8.2 percent from 1989's reported spending plan.
   The NATO report, based on defense spending through 1988, said
the budget outlays reported this year by the Kremlin appeared too
low to cover the cost of Soviet military activities.
   It estimated that the Kremlin spent $210 billion to $258 billion
in 1988.
   That sum, it said, would amount to about 15 percent to 18
percent of the Soviet economy's total output. In comparison, NATO
estimates that U.S. defense spending last year accounted for about
6.1 percent of the gross national product.
   Most of the differences in budget estimates was due to
artificially low prices the Soviets maintain for some defense
efforts, the report said. It also said the Soviets do not appear to
include some costs added to Western budgets.
   Defense spending grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
about 2 percent to 3 percent in the 1985-88 period, a bit ahead of
the pace in the first half of the decade, the report said.
   ``Underlying the estimate of defense spending growth is a fairly
rapid increase in procurement expenditures, which approach 40
percent of total outlays,'' the report said.
   ``This increase in growth has been driven by the production of
several new generations of weapon systems, the development of which
predates Gorbachev,'' it said.
   It said expenditures on operations and maintenance grew by about
2 percent annually. Spending on research and development gained but
little rise was found in personnel expenditures.
   The report noted Gorbachev's drive to restructure the economy so
that some of the money spent for defense would be channeled into
consumer goods. But it said the conversion campaign ``still appears
to lack an integrated plan.''
   It said it would be difficult to estimate Soviet defense
spending in the next decade because of the dramatic political,
economic and military changes likely to take place.
   ``Although pressure to reduce military spending will continue,
the Soviet leadership will remain determined not to let Soviet
military capability fall below the level that it judges necessary
to protect the security of the state,'' the report concluded.

<HEAD>Agent Orange Benefits Checks Mailed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 8,900 supplemental benefit checks
totalling $27.3 million were mailed last week to Vietnam War
veterans disabled by the chemical defoliant Agent Orange, the
lawyer administering the payment program said Monday.
   During the next several days 500 more checks will be sent to
veterans or their survivors, said the attorney, Deborah Greenspan.
The payments ranged from $256 to $8,100, she said.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn, who is
overseeing the Agent Orange benefit program, last month ordered
that the additional payments be sent before Christmas.
   The payments won't significantly change the total award an
eligible veteran will receive, but will provide a large share of
the compensation in a lump-sum payment.
   Veterans receiving the supplemental checks will continue to
receive annual benefit payments until 1994, but the amount of the
yearly payments will be reduced somewhat to account for the
lump-sum payment.
   Weinstein created the Agent Orange Settlement Fund in 1984 when
seven chemical companies _ without admitting guilt _ agreed to pay
$180 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by Vietnam
veterans and their families who alleged injuries because of
exposure to the chemical during the war.
   Agent Orange, widely used by American forces during the Vietnam
War, contained the highly toxic chemical dioxin. In their lawsuit,
veterans said exposure to the defoliant caused cancer and other
illnesses, as well as birth defects in their children.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Rose Mofford underwent surgery Monday to
have her infected gallbladder removed and to clear blockages
believed to have been caused by gallstones.
   Surgery began at 12:20 p.m. and was expected to last two hours,
said Debra Gelbart, a spokeswoman for St. Joseph's Hospital and
Medical Center.
   ``We think that surgery is the best option at this time,''
Robert Bullington, a cardiologist and Mrs. Mofford's primary
physician said shortly before surgery began. ``She feels herself
that surgery is the best option.''
   The operation's chief surgeon, Victor Zannis, said that there
was ``over a 90 percent chance that she's going to be just fine.''
   Mrs. Mofford probably will have to remain in the hospital for
seven to 10 days after surgery but should be able to work from her
bed and could recover to deliver her State of the State address
Jan. 8, the doctors said.
   Mrs. Mofford, 67, checked herself into St. Joseph's on Sunday
complaining of chest pains. Tests showed that the pain came from an
infected gallbladder and irritated pancreas, said Michael Altman, a
gastroenterologist.
   Tests suggest that Mrs. Mofford was suffering from gall stones
and that one or more of them had made its way from the gallbladder
through the cystic duct and into the common bile duct where it
blocked the pancreatic duct long enough to irritate the pancreas,
Altman said.
   Mrs. Mofford's doctors said her family had a history of
gallbladder and heart problems. The hospital said Monday that the
governor was in stable condition and was not in pain.

   After a kiss from his widow, Andrei D. Sakharov
was buried Monday in a snowy cemetery where Kremlin elite joined
with common people in mourning the human rights advocate once
treated as an outlaw.
   To the baleful strains of Robert Schumann's ``Traumerai,''
Sakharov's coffin was carried along a path strewn with evergreen
boughs to the freshly dug grave at Vostryakovskoye Cemetery.
   ``It's over,'' Sakharov's wife and dissident comrade-in-arms,
Yelena Bonner, said as she turned to a companion during the
twilight burial under pines dripping with rain.
   Sakharov died Thursday of an apparent heart attack at the age of
68. He was buried alongside Bonner's mother, Ruth, a Stalin-era
political prisoner who died in 1987 at age 87.
   Before the crimson- and black-trimmed coffin was lowered into
the cold land Sakharov tried so hard to change, its lid was removed
to allow Bonner a last farewell. She took the shroud from his face
and bent to kiss him on the forehead.
   As the procession wound its way through Moscow, some mourners
marched alongside with signs demanding democratic elections, one of
Sakharov's final causes.
   Others hoisted the blue, red, and white flag of czarist Russia,
now the symbol of the grassroots pro-democracy Russian People's
Front.
   Top Communist Party brass riding sleek black limousines and tens
of thousands of common people trudging through the slush joined in
paying their last respects to the Nobel Peace laureate, who once
was pilloried as an ignoramus and dupe of the West.
   In the morning, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other members
of the ruling Politburo stood in the rain to view the body outside
the Academy of Sciences. Sakharov, a creator of the Soviet hydrogen
bomb, was a member of the academy.
   Gorbachev spoke at length there with Bonner and later told
reporters: ``Now it is clear that he deserved the Nobel Prize.''
   Sakharov won the prize in 1975 for his human rights campaign,
but the Soviet leadership at the time refused to let him go to
Norway to accept it. He was hounded for years and finally sent into
internal exile in Gorky for nearly seven years.
   An open-ended bus followed by thousands of mourners carried
Sakharov's body and Bonner along Lenin Prospekt to outdoor funeral
ceremonies in the parking lot of the Luzhniki sports complex, a
favorite site for rallies by human rights activists.
   More than 30,000 people surged forward toward Sakharov's
carnation-bedecked coffin, and Bonner had to plead for order.
   Sakharov ``did all he could,'' Ilya Zaslavsky, a Moscow member
of the Congress of People's Deputies, told the crowd. ``Now only
his ideas can change things, and only we can fulfill his ideas.''
   ``The Academy of Sciences is guilty before him; we were passive
in our defense of him,'' Sakharov's fellow academician and Congress
member, Dmitri Likhachev, said in a quavering voice. ``Now we say:
Andrei Dmitrievich, forgive us!''
   State-run TV showed excerpts of the Luzhniki services in a
special broadcast of the kind usually reserved for the deaths of
major government figures. The evening news program ``Vremya'' led
off with an eight-minute report on Sakharov's last rites,
accompanied by a sorrowful dirge.
   The 2,250-member Congress, or parliament, to which Sakharov
belonged adjourned at midday so its members could attend the
funeral ceremonies.
   From Luzhniki, the coffin was transported nine miles in a bus to
the cemetery along slush-filled streets.
   In addition to Gorbachev, Politburo members and other Soviet
leaders gathered at the Academy of Sciences to view Sakharov's body.
   From another direction, buses escorted by police cars arrived.
Some 20 people carried the casket on their shoulders from a bus and
placed it on a bier in front of the academy. Bonner also emerged,
accompanied by her son, Alexei Semenov.
   The coffin was opened in the frigid rain, and an umbrella opened
to shield Sakharov's face.
   A bareheaded and somber Gorbachev walked to the foot of the
casket and stood for awhile in silence. He bowed twice, and the
huddle of people around the casket broke up.
   Gorbachev and Bonner spoke animatedly, with Bonner smiling at
one point. Gorbachev and his entourage entered the academy
Presidium building to sign an official book of condolences. He
wrote simply, ``M.S. Gorbachev.''
   He emerged and talked briefly with reporters. ``The relations
between myself and Sakharov were always those of mutual respect,''
Gorbachev said. ``Now it is clear that he deserved the Nobel
Prize.''
   It was Gorbachev who allowed Sakharov to return to Moscow in
December 1986 after the years of exile in Gorky. The two men had
clashed, however, over the speed and sweep of Gorbachev's political
reform program, with Sakharov demanding the Communist Party that
Gorbachev heads renounce its constitutional monopoly on power.
   Some parliamentarians Monday pledged to heed Sakharov's call to
create a full-fledged opposition in the Congress and to push for
victory for progressives in nationwide local elections that began
this month.
   Lech Walesa, the leader of Poland's Solidarity movement and
winner of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, had been expected to attend
the service, but Poland's official PAP news agency reported his
plane had to land in Leningrad because of bad weather.

   CBS, fallen on hard prime times and hoping to
change that, on Monday named as its chief programmer Jeff Sagansky,
a movie executive who worked at NBC when that network was making a
comeback to first in ratings.
   Sagansky's job is ``to put on contemporary, successful
programming and to do it with some flair and imagination ...,'' CBS
Broadcast Group president Howard Stringer said in an interview.
   The appointment of Sagansky, 37, president of Tri-Star Pictures
since March, had been expected. But it was delayed a week while CBS
and Columbia Pictures, Tri-Star's parent company, negotiated a
release from his Tri-Star contract, which had a year to go.
   On Jan. 1, Sagansky will become the third president CBS
Entertainment has had in as many years. He succeeds Kim LeMasters,
who resigned Nov. 30 after only two years in the job.
   He will be the counterpart of his former boss at NBC, Brandon
Tartikoff, whose network has led prime time ratings for four
seasons and is expected to be first again this season. Sagansky was
NBC's senior vice president for series from 1983 to 1985, when he
joined Tri-Star as production president.
   CBS has been third in evening ratings for two consecutive
seasons, posted its worst-ever November ratings this year, and is
expected to conclude this season in third again, adversely
affecting CBS's revenues.
   But Sagansky, who previously worked in a CBS finance post two
years after graduating from Harvard in 1974, said in an interview
from Los Angeles that he had no trepidations about rejoining the
network.
   And, he said, ``I think you've got to be really audacious,
innovative and aggressive'' because of fierce competition not only
from NBC and ABC but also from cable, the young Fox network, and
other viewing alternatives.
   Although the time for mid-season changes is approaching,
Sagansky said he had no immediate fixes of CBS' schedule in mind.
   ``I don't think there are any immediate fixes,'' he said. ``I
think this is a case of targeting your (program) development for a
specific time period. There's a lot more competition now than when
NBC did it.''
   CBS previously considered Sagansky for the job in 1987.
   Sagansky was again wooed before and after CBS unsuccessfully
last week tried to lure to its vacant job a top TV production team,
Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, whose company makes NBC's ``The Cosby
Show'' and ABC's ``Roseanne.''
   Stringer called CBS' talks with Carsey and Werner ``a brilliant
detour'' that ``almost came to fruition. But Jeff is the guy we
wanted ...''

   National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft,
whose surprise mission to China earlier this month created a storm
of criticism in Congress, made a secret visit to Beijing in July,
the White House said today.
   A month after the bloody government crackdown against
pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, Bush sent
Scowcroft to China ``to personally underscore the United States'
shock and concern about the violence,'' said White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater also said that Scowcroft's trip intended was ``to
impress upon the Chinese government the seriousness with which this
incident was viewed in the United States.''
   Fitzwater left open the possiblity that Scowcroft or other top
U.S. officials had made other secret trips to China.
   ``I can't rule out other encounters,'' he said.
   He added that he, personally, had been unaware of earlier trips.
   The spokesman declined to say when in July Scowcroft had gone to
Beijing, but said it was at least a month after government troops
killed hundreds of democracy protesters when the troops moved into
the square on June 3.
   Fitzwater's comments were the first administration
acknowledgement that Scowcroft has made more than one trip to China
after the crackdown.
   ``The president felt this face-to-face mission, like the one
recently completed by General Scowcroft, was necessary to show the
sense of purpose and direction of the United States government,''
Fitzwater added in a statement.
   Earlier today, Bush, without noting Scowcroft's July trip, told
reporters that critics of this month's visit have been ``dealing
with emotion and not facts'' and that ``once they deal with a full
deck, I expect people will understand it.''
   He said that criticism of the Dec. 8-9 trip by Scowcroft and
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger was subsiding and
that those who were still skeptical should ``be a little patient
and wait and see'' how Beijing responds.
   ``I'm just going to stay with my position and take on a little
heat from time to time. And we'll wait and see what happens,'' said
Bush, who has been accused by Democrats of ``kowtowing'' to the
Chinese leaders.

   Terrorists pressing for more attention could
well ``increase the carnage'' in attacks on airplanes and other
targets next year, federal officials said Monday. One raised the
possibility that chemical weapons will soon be used.
   Terrorist groups appear to be moving away from hijackings and
toward airplane bombings, as evidenced by the Pan Am explosion last
December and by the bombings this year of an Avianca plane over
Colombia and a French UTA jetliner over Niger in Africa, said
Anthony Wayne of the State Department's office on counter-terrorism.
   Thus, he said, the number of terrorist incidents might decline
while the number of casualties would grow.
   In the first 10 months of the year, 410 people were killed in
international terrorist attacks, according to preliminary figures
compiled by the State Department. In the corresponding period last
year, 308 people were killed.
   Terrorism has become so pervasive ``that it's lost much of its
shock value,'' said Seth Cropsey, deputy assistant secretary of
state for special operations. ``Terrorists, to stay on the front
page and in the public eye feel they must increase the carnage,''
he said.
   As a result, ``it's likely that we'll see more efforts to bomb
planes and the appearance of new weapons and tactics previously
shunned by terrorist groups. Indeed, future concern is the possible
introduction of biochemical agents,'' he said.
   Cropsey declined to elaborate on such prospects, citing
intelligence sources.
   A third official, speaking on a seminar panel with the other
two, cautioned against any expectation that reforms in the Soviet
Union would result in a lessening of support for countries such as
Cuba, Syria and Nicaragua that have been accused of financing
terrorist groups.
   ``Until proven wrong, we should not operate'' on that
assumption, said Oliver B. Revell, associate deputy director of
investigations at the FBI.
   Revell, speaking at a George Washington University symposium on
terrorism, said terrorist organizations such as the
Marxist-oriented Japanese Red Army and the Palestine Liberation
Front-General Command will continue to pose a threat to U.S.
interests and to Americans in 1990.
   Investigations have focused on the PFLP-GC as a prime suspect in
the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Scotland last December in
which 270 people _ among them 200 Americans _ were killed.
   Revell also said ``a very small number of tightly disciplined''
Iranians among the 325,000 Iranians living in the United States
could present a threat to Americans. ``Anti-U.S. sentiment has
continued'' since the death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini last
summer, Revell said.
   Some 10,000 Iranian students on scholarships from their
governments live in the United States and ``with this
infrastructure, the threat appears to be substantial,'' he said.
   Tehran Radio reported in recent months on several meetings
between senior Iranian officials and the leader of the PFLP-GC.
   In another development, a congressional report issued Monday
said that increased security procedures since the bombing of Flight
103 are not being carried out properly at high-risk foreign
airports due to a lack of training standards.
   The General Accounting Office report faulted the Federal
Aviation Administration for not establishing minimum training
requirements and standards for the extra security measures taken
following the Dec. 21, 1988, disaster.

<TEXT>
   Eight Soviet students will tour the
underground Strategic Air Command headquarters Friday in what may
be the first such tour of the nuclear weapons command center,
officials said Monday.
   Col. Larry Greer, a SAC spokesman, said it was coincidental that
the tour comes amid changes in Eastern Europe and improved
Soviet-American relations.
   But school officials might have never considered asking SAC for
the tour if it weren't for the apparently improving relations, said
Di Saggau, a spokeswoman for the Westside Community Schools.
   The tour of SAC underground is apparently the first by a Soviet
group, and it will be a little different from other tours, Greer
said.
   ``We're not going to bear down on nuclear deterence,'' although
that is part of SAC's mission, Greer said. ``It's a fact. It's well
known. If they can read, they know it.''
   SAC is the Air Force's long-range strike force of manned bombers
and intercontinental ballistic missiles. Since 1961, it has flown
round-the-clock flights in project Looking Glass, which would take
charge of nuclear forces if the president and other leaders were
killed.
   Five Soviet girls and three boys, ages 15-17, have been in the
United States since Nov. 27 in an exchange program with Westside
High School. They are to leave Dec. 27, and a group of Westside
students is to visit the Soviet Union in March.
   The Soviet students' teacher-interpreter and eight American
students will accompany them on the SAC tour, Saggau and Greer said.
   SAC, at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, will follow its normal
security precautions for civilians, including keeping the group
together on the tour, Greer said.
   SAC officials will modify the Soviet briefing because of
language concerns and because they think teen-agers are more
interested in the technological gadgets and wizardry than in broad
policy, he said.
   The students also will make radio contact with a base in Alaska.
``I want to remind the Soviet kids that we're just a few miles west
of them,'' Greer said.

<HEAD>Terrorism Reward Increased to $2 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. government Monday quadrupled _ to $2
million _ the maximum reward it can offer to anyone who provides
information that helps thwart an act of terrorism.
   The money can be paid to ``any person who furnishes information
that leads to the prevention, frustration or favorable resolution
of a terrorist act against U.S. persons or property,'' the State
Department said in a brief announcement.
   The increase was made possible by a provision in an anti-drug
bill passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush last
week. Rewards had been limited to $500,000.
   ``We believe this increase will strengthen U.S. efforts to
prevent terrorist attacks and will help bring terrorists to
justice,'' the statement said.
   Anyone with information about planned terrorist acts should call
the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate if they are overseas, or
contact the FBI if they are in the United States, it said.
   The announcement came three days after the department issued an
unusual public terrorism alert, warning of the possibility of an
attack on U.S. targets in Western Europe or west Africa.
   Concern for such an attack was based on recent reports of
movement of terrorists from the Middle East and the discovery of
weapons shipments destined for pro-Iranian groups in Spain and
Africa.
   It also reflected concern that terrorists might seek to use
violence to observe the anniversaries of the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing
of Pan Am Flight 103 or other attacks that have taken place during
the holiday season.

<HEAD>Possible U.S. Sponsorship for World Championship Chess</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PALMA DE MAJORCA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American group is trying to
bring the second part of the 1990 World Chess Championship final to
the United States, an official said Monday.
   ``We are very excited to be involved in the world of chess in
the present climate,'' said Robert L. Burkett, president of World
Professional Chess Promotion, Inc., and a senior vice-president for
corporate affairs at the Interscope Group, both owned by Ted Field,
whose family formerly owned the Chicago Sun-Times.
   ``If we are successful in obtaining the rights to conduct the
world championship in the United States, we plan to negotiate with
a number of cities in hopes of finding the ideal venue,'' Burkett
said.
   Earlier, at a general meeting of the Grandmasters Association,
chairman Bessel Kok suggested splitting the world championship
match between Lyon, France, and a U.S. city.
   The governing body of chess, known by its French acronym FIDE,
awarded the match to Lyon in August. But reigning world champion
Gary Kasparov of the Soviet Union and other grandmasters objected
that Lyon was awarded the match without their being consulted.
   Kok told grandmasters he would meet with FIDE officials Dec. 28
to try to work out a solution.
   At Monday's meeting, Kasparov successfully pushed through an
amendment to a peace agreement proposed Nov. 26 in Lucerne,
Switzerland between FIDE and the Grandmasters Association (GMA)
calling for the World Championship match to be organized under the
auspices of the association.
   ``We are looking seriously at the possibility of making a bid,''
Burkett said. ``We are extremely pleased the GMA by popular acclaim
endorsed the concept of splitting the venues and are particularly
looking forward to working with the city of Lyon.''
   Burkett did not discuss possible sites in the United States nor
did he comment on the size of the proposed prize fund.
   Lyon offerred a prize fund of $1.94 million.
   Joel Benjamin, a grandmaster from New York City, said he had
heard rumors New York was the best bet to stage the second half of
the contest.
   The 24-game championship will be spread over 10 weeks, and the
second half is likely to last for five weeks.
   In 1986, the third clash between Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov was
split between London and Leningrad.
   U.S. chess players long have hoped a major corporate sponsor
would get involved in chess and revitalize commercial support for
the game in the United States, which has remained virtually dormant
since Bobby Fischer refused to defend his championship crown in
1975.

   Texts of Supreme Court opinions soon will be
available via computer within minutes of their announcement from
the bench, a court official said Monday.
   James R. Donovan, director of data systems for the high court,
said the experimental system will be put in operation, perhaps by
spring, for a two-year run.
   During an 18-month study into speedy delivery of high court
opinions in electronic form, a special committee headed by Donovan
originally envisioned letting some private agency distribute the
opinions to all interested parties.
   But it was later decided the court itself should do the job.
   The system ``is designed to simultaneously transmit the court's
opinions to a specific group of recipients, limited to those who
are in the business of disseminating information,'' Donovan said in
a letter of announcement.
   The number of recipients initially will be kept down by
``practical limits of system capacity and workload imposed upon
court staff,'' Donovan said.
   He said the number of recipients, each of which will pay an
annual subscription rate expected to be set at $500, might be
increased if there is demand and if the experiment indicates
expansion is feasible.
   Recipients, to be chosen by Donovan's committee, will be
expected to provide necessary common equipment, such as telephone
lines.

<HEAD>Radical Economic Program Debated, Farmers Attack Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Solidarity-led government's sweeping
economic reform program came under attack Monday from farmers'
representatives, who said they preferred guaranteed minimum prices
to the risk of a free market.
   Farmers became the first major interest group to object to the
government economic program that was introduced Sunday. The plan
aims to transform Poland into a market economy after 45 years of
Communist economics and calls for sharp cuts in state spending and
subsidies to balance the budget and cure Poland's 900 percent
inflation.
   But while the discussion on farm policy was sharp, the
government's economic reform program as a whole was not considered
to be in serious trouble.
   Agriculture Minister Czeslaw Janicki told the Sejm, the lower
house of Parliament, that the government would create an agency to
intervene in the market if farm prices fall too low, but that it is
essential to move away from government-mandated prices.
   Janicki also promised to curb monopoly food processors to whom
farmers sell, and pledged to try to increase the flow of farm
machinery, fertilizer and other agriculture inputs to the
countryside.
   The reassurances did not satisfy Parliament members from rural
areas who argued for guaranteed prices and more direct state
investment in farming.
   Farmers in food-poor Poland are angry that the government wants
to abandon guaranteed minimum prices for their produce, arguing
that their costs are rising and they need to be assured of
profitability.
   About 75 percent of Poland's farming is in private hands, mainly
on small holdings of only a few acres. Productivity per acre is
about half that of Western Europe.
   In the past, the government fixed prices at what it determined
was a profitable level, often one that rewarded even inefficient
farmers. Lat year, the government moved toward a system in which
prices are to be negotiated freely between farmers and purchasers.
   But farmers have complained that the buyers _ mainly nationwide
Communist Party-dominated food and processing cooperatives _ are
monopolies that dictate unfavorable prices.
   They also complaim that city dwellers unfairly blame them for
1,000 percent price increases in recent months, and that most of
the money has been pocketed by the intermediaries.
   Ryszard Smolarek, a Communist deputy, argued for maintaining
minimum guaranteed prices at least until July.
   ``Agriculture cannot be dumped into the deep water,'' he said.
``Farmers' incomes are going to be left without any protection.''
   ``Opinions are getting more and more radical in the
countryside,'' Deputy Jacek Szymaderski said, arguing for greater
government investment in agricultural development.
   The government did not ``take into consideration the specific
nature of agriculture,'' said Deputy Jozef Zych, a member of the
Peasant Party.
   Over the weekend, Jozef Slisz, the head of the independent
farmers union Rural Solidarity, was ousted at the union's congress
and replaced by Gabriel Janowski, a farmer-senator who was
perceived as more willing to criticize the government.
   ``Our farmer knows a lot and he could do a lot, but his
capabilitiies and his possibilities are limited by a lack of
means,'' Janicki told the chamber.
   ``The state of agriculture, like the whole economy, is a result
of the piling up of problems in the system over several decades,''
he said.
   On the issue of supporting minimal prices of agricultural
products, Janicki said it would be done through intervention in the
market by a new Agency for Agricultural Market Affairs.
   ``This agency will be equipped with essential means and
authority which will allow it to better stabilize the food
market,'' he said. It will make ``intervention purchases'' at the
local level if necessary to support set price levels for grains,
meat and milk, he said.
   The governent will use new anti-monopoly legislation to break up
monopolies in agricultural services and food processing, he said.
   ``As long as there are monopolies in procurement of agricultural
products there will be problems'' in creating a free market,
Janicki said.
   The Sejm is to meet again Tuesday and possibly Wednesday.
   After Sunday's meeting, a 43-member commission of deputies was
formed to review the whole package. Charied by Solidarity Deputy
Andrzej Zawislak, it is to speed review of the package to meet a
Jan. 1 government deadline.
   Asked whether the more than a dozen bills and resolutions could
be approved, Zawislak said, ``There is a chance, because the
extreme situation causes an explosion of social energy that can
carry out great changes.''
   The government has acknowledged the program will lead
temporarily to unemployment and lowered living standards, but says
it is necessary to choke off inflation and make the economy
efficient.
   The plan includes balancing the deficit-ridden state budget
through strict austerity; cutting off most state subsidies; freeing
prices; limiting wage increases; turning the zloty into a
convertible currency; attacking monopolies; reforming the banking
and tax systems; establishing a social safety net for the poor and
jobless; and selling off state industries to the private sector.

<HEAD>Colombians Search for Medellin Drug Boss Escobar</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers searched northern Colombia on
Monday for drug lord Pablo Escobar Gaviria, boss of the deadly
Medellin cartel.
   After a four-month war against drug traffickers in which the
cocaine gangs have killed at least 200 people, Colombian
authorities were heartened Friday by the death of Gonzalo Rodriguez
Gacha in a police shootout near Covenas, on the Caribbean coast.
   On Sunday, President Virgilio Barco said: ``We will continue our
commitment to eradicate narco-trafficking from Colombia. Looking at
what happened to Rodriguez Gacha, those involved in this illegal
activity will realize what their end will be.''
   Rodriguez Gacha, 42, his son Fredy and five bodyguards were
killed Friday in the first major government victory of the drug
war, which Barco declared after the assassination Aug. 18 of Sen.
Luis Carlos Galan, the leading presidential candidate.
   ``We keep up our search for Escobar Gaviria and other drug
traffickers,'' Defense Minister Gen. Oscar Botero told reporters
Monday.
   Officials said a long fight remains. As Barco put it Sunday:
``This war has had a development favorable to the government, but
it is not over yet.''
   Drug gangs have killed at least 200 people the past four months
in bomb attacks in Bogota, Medellin, Cali and other cities.
Sixty-three died when a vehicle loaded with explosives exploded
this month outside the headquarters of the Colombian Intelligence
Police.
   Security sources said elite military units concentrated their
search for Escobar Gaviria on Monday near Cartagena and Sincelejo
in northern Colombia, where intelligence reports said he had
planned to meet with Rodriguez Gacha.
   Bogota newspapers said the two had intended to plan sabotage
actions to discourage President Bush from attending an anti-drug
summit Feb. 15 with the presidents of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.
   When asked about the reports, a U.S. Embassy official said: ``We
know nothing of it.''
   The government has offered a reward equivalent to $580,000 for
information leading to the arrest or death of Escobar Gaviria, who
is said to have hundreds of men in his own private army.
   A similar amount was offered for Rodriguez Gacha, who had an
army of about 2,000.
   A diplomat said of Rodriguez Gacha's troops: ``They are
mercenaries. Now that their boss is dead, they are probably ...
fleeing.''
   Escobar Gaviria escaped into the jungle Nov. 22 when police
surrounded Cocorna, a town 110 miles from Bogota, where he was
hiding.
   If captured alive, Escobar Gaviria would be extradited to the
United States for trial on federal drug smuggling charges. So far
10 Colombians have been extradited to the United States to face
drug charges.
   Colombian drug gangs are believed responsible for 80 percent of
the illegal cocaine that enters the United States.

<HEAD>U.S. Denies Salvadoran Witnesses Mistreated</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The State Department said Monday that it
``absolutely and unequivocally'' denied assertions by a Salvadoran
couple who said they were mistreated by interrogators after they
linked the Salvadoran army to the deaths of six Jesuit priests last
month.
   Jorge Cerna, and his wife, Lucia Barrera de Cerna, told The New
York Times that U.S. and Salvadoran investigators repeatedly
accused them of lying, and that at one point were threatened with
deportation from the United States.
   Mrs. Barrera de Cerna worked as a housekeeper for the priets.
   Martha Doggett of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights said
the woman was so intimidated by FBI agents and a Salvadoran colonel
that she recanted her story.
   After the couple's allegations appeared in Monday's editions of
The New York Times, the State Department reaffirmed the denials it
issued last week after charges by a Salvadoran cleric.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Mrs. Barrera de
Cerna was treated with ``respect and courtesy'' during the
interviews, which were conducted in the United States over a period
of several days in late November.
   ``Every effort was made to make the witness feel comfortable and
secure,'' Ms. Tutwiler said about Mrs. Barrera de Cerna, adding
there was no threat to deport her.
   William Walker, the U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, also denied
that U.S. government officials had subjected Mrs. Barrera de Cerna
to pressure.
   ``Full professionals do not involve themselves in psychological
torment,'' Walker told reporters in Washington.
   However, he also said she gave differing versions of what she
saw the night the priests were slain and a subsequent lie-detector
test could not corroborate any of her testimony.
   ``This does not mean she is not a credible witness or that she's
trying to deceive us, but we are just trying to put together what
she did see,'' he said.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkle said a review of the
transcript indicated the interviews were carried out in a
professional fashion.
   As part of the U.S. effort to help Salvadoran authorities bring
the killers of the Jesuits to justice, American officials arranged
for Mrs. Barrera de Cerna to be flown to Miami after learning she
may have been a witness.
   ``She was considered as someone with information which could be
useful in solving these horrible crimes,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. ``She
was never treated as a criminal suspect.''
   Ms. Doggett said the interrogators cast doubt on the couples'
allegation that they had seen Salvadoran soldiers moving to and
from the priests' residences.
   ``Who put you up to this?'' they were asked, according to Ms.
Doggett.
   Ms. Doggett said Mrs. Barrerr de Cerna was told, ``Depending on
what you say, you may or may not have to go back to El Salvador.''
   The Salvadoran officer, Lt. Col. Manuel Antonio Rivas, also
yelled at Mrs. Barrera de Cerna: ``I'm ashamed of you! You're a
Salvadoran! You're a liar!'' Ms. Doggett said.
   Rivas is head of the U.S.-trained Special Investigative Unit,
which was designed to handle human rights cases.
   Ms. Doggett, who coordinates Latin American and Caribbean
affairs for the Lawyers Committee, was one of two representatives
from the organization to interview Mrs. Barrera de Cerna recently.

<HEAD>Brown of Houston Named Police Commissioner</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lee Brown, credited with easing racial tensions
as Houston police chief, was named Monday as police commissioner
for New York City, where he faces a drug-fueled crime wave.
   ``We need the best police commissioner we could find. Of all the
finalists, he seemed to be the absolute best in the country,''
Mayor-elect David Dinkins said at a news conference to announce his
choice to run America's biggest police force.
   Brown, chief in Houston since 1982 and one of four finalists for
the New York job, takes over Jan. 22. He will head a department
with 26,000 officers and 7,200 civilian employees, seven times
larger than Houston's.
   ``I made a difficult decision, something I didn't feel I would
be making when I was first talked to,'' Brown, 52, said at a news
conference Monday in Houston. ``I talked about it and pondered,
agonized and prayed.''
   Brown was Houston's first black police chief, and has been
credited for easing racial friction there. But Houston's force
recently has been hit with allegations of racism and corruption, as
well as controversy over shootings by officers.
   As New York's 36th police commissioner, Brown will face a city
convulsed with drug-related crime. The murder rate is at a record
level, and crack cocaine has been the main cause.
   ``The thing that will hit him immediately is the drug-crime
problem,'' said Thomas Reppetto, head of the independent watchdog
Citizens Crime Commission and a member of the search committee that
interviewed Brown.
   Brown has said that each city's crime solutions are different,
but he is a champion of community policing, with close cooperation
between police and neighborhoods, Reppetto said.
   Before taking the Houston job, Brown was chief of public safety
and chief of public safety for metropolitan Portland, Ore. He holds
a doctorate in criminology from the University of California at
Berkeley and is first vice president of the International
Association of Chiefs of Police.
   Brown will become president of the association next year, said
Reppetto. ``That's like an open door to the White House'' as an
expert on police affairs, Reppetto said.
   Brown began his career as a policeman in San Jose, Calif., in
1960. He established Portland State University's criminal justice
program eight years later and in 1972 joined Howard University,
where he was associate director of the Institute for Urban Affairs
and Research and director of the Criminal Justice Program. He went
to Portland in 1975.
   Brown succeeds Commissioner Richard Condon, who took over Oct.
22 when longtime Commissioner Benjamin Ward retired. Ward was New
York's first black police commissioner.
   Condon was one of the four finalists, and both Gov. Mario Cuomo
and outgoing Mayor Edward I. Koch had urged Dinkins to keep Condon
on. But Dinkins, who takes office Jan. 1, said he was swayed by the
strong support Brown received from law enforcement experts.

   Americans smoked less in 1989 than in the year
before, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   ``Despite record exports of about 130 billion cigarettes, output
is down,'' said the report from the department's Economic Research
Service.
   U.S. cigarette consumption may be off about 4 percent from last
year, the report said, without detail. ``Use of cigars and smoking
tobacco continues to decline, but snuff production is up,'' it
added.
   The Agriculture Department said the U.S. tobacco crop is larger
this year than last, but overall 1989-90 supplies are lower because
of smaller stocks held at the beginning of the year.
   ``Tighter supplies, higher price supports, and a little better
quality 1989 crop have boosted prices of most types of tobacco this
season,'' said the report.
   Flue-cured tobacco averaged $1.67 a pound, 6 cents more than
last year.
   Burley sales began Nov. 20, with prices averaging about 5 cents
a pound higher than a year earlier.
   Total production this year is expected to be nearly 1.5 billion
pounds, 7 percent above 1988, but 16 percent below the 1980-85
average.

   Lebanon's ousted ambassador to the United
States said Monday that he still regards himself as his country's
official envoy and that only a court order will remove him from the
embassy and official residence.
   Abdallah Bouhabib, who was removed by Lebanon's new government
several weeks ago, said he no longer sees State Department contacts
in an official capacity but is continuing to deal with them outside
their offices.
   ``I am in a very strong position, I am not going to get out,''
he said in a telephone interview. ``If anybody wants me out of
office and the embassy, they have to go to court.''
   The State Department was told last week that Bouhabib had
resigned effective Dec. 11 and that the No. 2 diplomat at the
embassy, Sleiman Rassi, was in charge. The department announced
that it would only deal with Rassi because he represents the
U.S.-recognized government.
   However, Bouhabib said he does not recognize the government of
Prime Minister Salim al-Hoss and President Elias Hrawi.
   ``I don't take orders from them,'' he said.
   Bouhabib, who has been ambassador since 1983, said there was ``a
dispute about the legality and legitimacy of the Hrawi government''
and until the problem is resolved he and other Lebanese diplomats
abroad should remain in office.
   The former World Bank economist is a supporter of Christian Gen.
Michel Aoun, whom Hrawi removed from all his posts but who
continues to hold out with 20,000 troops at the presidential palace
in Beirut.
   In an attempt to resolve the embarrassing embassy standoff, the
Arab League's Ambassador Clovis Maksoud urged the Lebanese
government to give Bouhabib a two-month transition to hand over the
embassy's affairs, said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The sources said Bouhabib had asked Maksoud to intervene, but
Bouhabib denied he had made such a request.

   Police departments across the country
routinely tape conversations between jailed suspects and their
lawyers, a congressional hearing was told Monday.
   The hearing by the courts subcommittee of the House Judiciary
Committee grew out of a Connecticut auto case that came to light
earlier this year.
   But state or local police or corrections officers in at least 12
other states routinely record lawyer-client conversations, said the
subcommittee chairman, Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier, D-Wis.
   ``A clear pattern is emerging across the country,'' said
Kastenmeier. ``It is unfortunate but likely that as we explore what
happened in these states, information about other states will come
to light.''
   Kastenmeier said information gathered by the subcommttee
indicates that some form of bugging or wiretapping of conversations
between jailed suspects and their attorneys has gone on in Rhode
Island, West Virginia, Georgia, New Mexico, Oregon, Alaska,
Wyoming, Vermont, Indiana, Utah, Nebraska and New Jersey.
   Antonio Califa, legislative counsel to the American Civil
Liberties Union, detailed several instances of police taping:
   _In Rhode Island, state police since 1988 have taped incoming
and outgoing calls on a system that connects the state's five
barracks. According to Califa, the U.S. attorney has begun a
preliminary investigation.
   _In West Virginia, state police have been taping telephone
conversations from suspects to their families and lawyers for 20
years, Califa said. Callers are not warned that the calls are being
recorded.
   _The Utah Civil Liberties Union is planning a lawsuit alleging
that the state Department of Corrections routinely taped
conversations between convicted prison inmates and their attorneys.
   Federal law forbids telephone taping except when investigatrs
obtain a court order based on probable cause in a criminal
investigation or when both parties to the conversation agree to the
taping. Many state laws mirror the 1968 federal statute but some
permit taping if only one party to the conversation consents.
   Monday's hearing included a videotape of a telephone
conversation on August 5, 1988, between a suspect in a Connecticut
vehicular homicide case and his attorney.
   During trial a Connecticut State Police officer testified that
the call was recorded as part of routine department policy.
   An investigation by The Hartford Courant revealed that the
secret tape-recording by state police was widespread, prompting
Gov. William A. O'Neill to order an immediate halt to the taping of
attorney-client calls. The revelations cost Public Safety
Commissioner and State Police Commander Lester J. Forst his job.
   A later state investigation concluded that the tapes were not
used to illegally gather evidence against suspects.
   The Connecticut State Police have insisted from the start that
the tapes were not listened to.
   Attorneys Elliot B. Spector and Marcia J. Gleeson, representing
Connecticut and 19 defendants including two top former state police
officials, wrote to Kastenmeier on Saturday that the witness list
for Monday's hearing would only expose one side of the story.
   ``The news media, some public figures and criminal defense
attorneys hysterically characterized these events as criminal acts
amounting to a national crisis,'' Gleeson and Spector wrote. ``I
would hope that the committee will take a more cautious approach to

   Gleeson said committee staff members rejected offers to provide
an opposing point of view in the hearing.
   Members of Kastenmeier's staff said the committee sought to
question Connecticut State Police Lt. Col. John Mulligan about the
taping practices but that Mulligan refused.

   The United States is formally protesting
Romania's weekend crackdown on protesters as ``a terribly mistaken
course'' by a government that sees its popular support slipping
away, the State Department said Monday.
   Romanian police opened fire on protesters during weekend
anti-government riots and at least two people, including a child,
were killed, a person traveling in the region said. An unconfirmed
report in the West German media said hundreds were killed.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the violent
clashes were the result of suppression of legitimate dissent by
citizens frustrated with repression and hardships under the regime
of President Nicolae Ceausescu, among the last of the East Bloc's
hard-line communist rulers.
   Ceausescu has forcefully rejected reforms that are sweeping the
rest of Eastern Europe.
   ``Since the government doesn't have the support of the people,
it is following a terribly mistaken course of using security forces
to repress a serious manifestation of popular discontent with the
policies of the Ceausescu regime,'' Ms. Tutwiler told reporters at
the department's daily briefing.
   She said the U.S. ambassador in Bucharest, Alan Green, was
``determining what form our protest will take.''
   Ms. Tutwiler noted that the United States has ``consistently
criticized that regime's repression of dissent and denial of
fundamental human rights to its people.''
   She said the United States was ``especially critical'' of
authorities' use of force against the Rev. Laszlo Toekes, a
Reformed Church minister in Timisoara, in western Romania. The
unrest began Saturday after his congregation sought to protect him
from a court-ordered move to another town, Ms. Tutwiler said.
   ``The demonstration apparently grew in size and took on an
anti-government tone,'' she said. On Sunday, she said, government
security units ``brutally put down the demonstration with the use
of truncheons, tear gas and water cannons.''
   She said she could not confirm reports of casualties or of
gunfire.
   Toekes, an ethnic Hungarian, has championed the rights of other
ethnic Hungarians in the face of what they see as harassment by
Romanian authorities. When the protest began Saturday, he was
seeking to exercise legitimate religious rights, Ms. Tutwiler said.
   The U.S. Embassy has been repeatedly rebuffed in its efforts to
visit and talk with Toekes because of security personnel deployed
around his church and home, she said.
   ``We call upon the Romanian government to cease its pressure
against Rev. Toekes and his congregation and allow him to exercise
his fundamental freedom to communicate,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   As to reports that Hungary has sealed its borders in an effort
to prevent news of the unrest from reaching the outside, she said:
   ``Of course it would concern us, and of course as in all the
other countries we are for self-determination of those people. This
is no different in Romania than it has been in any of the other
countries'' where change has occurred in Eastern Europe.

<HEAD>Leaflet Regulation Declared Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Monday declared
unconstitutional a 1976 regulation barring people from passing out
leaflets in an area around the White House.
   U.S. District Court Judge John Pratt issued the ruling in the
case of a Carol Ann Fennelly, charged with illegally distributing
pamphlets June 21 along East Executive Avenue between the White
House and Treasury Department.
   The material urged passers-by to write members of Congress in
favor of housing for the homeless.
   The judge said the regulation is an unconstitutional limitation
on First Amendment rights.
   National Park Service regulations approved in 1970 were part of
an effort to protect White House security by restrictions on
demonstrations. The 1976 amendments were drafted to preserve an
atmosphere of calm and tranquility at memorials and buildings
associated with past presidents.
   In 1976, ``nothing was said about the underlying purpose of
presidential security which was the overriding purpose of the
comprehensive regulations issued in 1970,'' Pratt said. The 1970
regulation allowed distribution of pamphlets and leaflets by not
mentioning them.
   ``In contrast, the 1976 revision ... for the first time banned''
distribution of material in the White House Park area, the judge
said.
   Pratt noted that Fennelly ``would violate the regulation by
passing out a leaflet,'' but ``could convey the same identical
message by word of mouth without fear of arrest.''
   ``A ban on the free distribution of leaflets and pamphlets in
those remote areas far removed from the White House itself has no
conceivable governmental interest,'' Pratt said in his opinion.
   ``It's distressing that the government continues to try to
impose these ridiculous limitations on free speech in the nation's
capital,'' said American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Arthur
Spitzer, who handled the case.

<HEAD>Lawyer Says Four Iranians Suspected of Being Rushdie `Hit Squad'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Iranians being held by police
under the Prevention of Terrorism Act believe they are suspected of
plotting to kill author Salman Rushdie, their lawyer said Monday.
   The three students and a disabled father of four were arrested
Friday at their homes in Manchester, police said. Under the act,
suspects can be held seven days without charge.
   ``The police have told me very little, but the men are under the
impression they have been arrested because they are suspected of
being a hit squad to kill Salman Rushdie,'' attorney Zahir Aziz
said.
   Moslems worldwide have mounted protests against the British
author and his novel, ``The Satanic Verses.'' The Indian-born
Rushdie was condemned to death Feb. 14 by the late Iranian leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who accused him of blaspheming Islam
in his novel.
   Rushdie has been in hiding ever since under police protection.
   Friday's arrests put in jeopardy tentative steps to improve
Anglo-Iranian relations and restore diplomatic links severed over
the Rushdie affair.
   The detainees' lawyer identified the students as Karen Abrinia,
32; Mehrdad Kokabi, 33; and Hussein Gharibi. No age was immediately
available for Gharibi.
   The attorney asked that the fourth man, 40-year-old Javad
Mousavi, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, be moved from his
police cell to a hospital.
   A Manchester police spokeswoman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, refused to say why the suspects were detained.
   However, she said the detentions were not connected to the U.S.
State Department's warning last week of a possible terrorist attack
on a U.S. target in Western Europe or West Africa.
   Patrick Stephenson, registrar at the University of Manchester
Institute of Science and Technology, said Kokabi and Abrinia were
engineering students who had completed their course work for doctor
of philosophy degrees and were writing dissertations. It was not
known where Gharibi studies.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency on Friday quoted
the Iranian newspaper Kayhan as saying the arrests followed
demonstrations by Moslems in more than 1,000 mosques throughout
Britain against Rushdie.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said police
activity in Manchester is believed to have intensified following a
stormy meeting there on Oct. 21 to celebrate the birthday of the
Islamic prophet Mohammed. At that session, hard-line Moslems voted
overwhelmingly to support the call for Rushdie's execution.
   Kayhan was quoted as saying police broke into the homes of the
four Iranians ``without producing any legal warrants, and, after
the unauthorized search of their homes, forcibly took them into
custody.''
   The Manchester police spokeswoman refused to comment when asked
about the warrants.
   English-born Dawn Mousavi said police came to the family's home
in Manchester on Friday afternoon and arrested her husband.
   ``We were kept in the kitchen for two hours while the police
searched the house. They took away personal papers like letters and
even bank books. They turned everything upside down and took the
floorboards up,'' she said.
   ``Javad is innocent. I don't know why he is detained. He is not
a politically active person _ although we both support the Iranian
government,'' Mrs. Mousavi said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a transcript of President Bush's
interview on Monday with The Associated Press and three other news
agencies.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BUSH: Well, I understand it, this is to review the calendar of
1989, so let me just click off a couple of areas that have been of
keen interest to me, and then be glad to take some questions.
   First, in foreign policy _
   Q: No, I was trying to see if my _ (laughter) _ you may
continue. (laughter.)
   BUSH: No, but we have established a new course of relations with
the Soviet Union. I continue to feel the Gorbachev meeting was
extraordinarily helpful in a lot of ways. And we are determined to
move forward with the CFE proposal that I made at NATO. I think
that next year's summit, which has now been set _ was set in '89,
will be fulfilled in 1990 _ will be a driving factor in other arms
control agreements. I'd like to see the START agreement finished by
then. But I think in general, the Soviets would also like to see
that.
   We've talked about, with the Soviet Union, given the
unprecedented changes in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union,
talked about _ obviously about reforms and how these Eastern
European countries, and indeed, the Soviet Union, is trying to go
forward on the economic side of perestroika.
   We've set a course for guiding our actions with Eastern Europe.
As you know, Jim Baker was over at NATO following my visit, and
that he talked there about the future and how the United States
would continue to interact, not just with the EC, but foreseeing an
expanded role for NATO. We've obviously moved to help Poland and
Hungary in specific ways. I tried very hard during this year to
reach new levels of consultation with heads of state and
government, and I'm going to continue that next year. But it wasn't
limited, obviously, to Eastern Europe. We've had a lot of
consultations in this hemisphere and in Asia as well.
   We see democracy on the move, and I want to be sure in 1990 that
we play an active and appropriate role in encouraging democratic
change and in being helpful to the countries that are going through
unprecedented change.
   You're familiar with the domestic agenda. I'm disappointed in
some ways that we didn't bring to fruition the changes in the Clean
Air Act on the environment. And the education summit was deemed by
most, I believe, to be a success, and we are now following up.
Indeed, some of the governors were here last week to discuss a
follow-on to the declarations coming out of the summit.
   I was happy that at the end of the year we've got some ethics
legislation passed, and that _ there were other items that _ the
crime package didn't go quite as _ the way I want to see it. We
need to move on it now in toto. We've tried to push forward our
thought on child care, but obviously the Congress has some
different views on that.
   On the minimum wage, we took the position what the minimum wage
ought to be. Congress tried to exceed that and to veto the
legislation, and that was passed in accordance with my wishes _ the
program that I set out earlier. And the S&amp;L legislation was a major
accomplishment, but I continue to worry about the S&amp;Ls.
   The Brady plan on Third World debt received a lot of support
around the world, and I _ again, we've got to follow through on
that _ not just us, but a lot of these private banks, the private
banks not just in the United States, but in Europe and elsewhere.
So we set a good groundwork early on as to how we can address
ourselves to the debt problems plaguing people in this hemisphere.
   So it's been a year of _ obviously a beginning for this
administration, but new beginnings in terms of some of these
initiatives. As the year ends, I think we're on the brink of a
tremendous opportunity. And I look forward to next year when we can
strengthen some of the initiatives that we've already taken and get
going on our new programs _ work to ensure the economic _ that the
economic recovery continues. We're now in the final throes of a
budget process here, but I'm very pleased that we were able to
essentially keep my pledge to the American people last year that I
would not raise taxes.
   So those _ that is not an inclusive list, but those are the ones
that are mainly on my mind, and if you said do you think it's been
a good year, I'd say it's been a pretty good year.

<HEAD>Corcoran Gallery Director Resigns in Dispute Over Show Cancellation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christina Orr-Cahall resigned Monday as
director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art because of a barrage of
criticism over her decision last summer to cancel a photography
exhibit containing sexually explicit pictures.
   The board of trustees of the 120-year-old gallery, the oldest in
Washington and third oldest private museum in the country, agreed
overwhelmingly to accept the resignation in the hope of laying the
controversy to rest.
   In a letter to the 54-member board, Ms. Orr-Cahall said she was
resigning effective Feb. 1 ``in the hope that my decision will help
to eliminate or abate those extraneous and disruptive
difficulties'' that have plagued the Corcoran for the past six
months.
   Gallery president Freeborn G. Jewett Jr. said at a news
conference that ``in all of Dr. Orr-Cahall's actions and
recommendations to the board of trustees, she acted in the utmost
good faith'' and had ``displayed qualities of professional skill,
courage and loyalty.''
   The Corcoran became the target of nationwide criticism in June
when Ms. Orr-Cahall canceled a traveling exhibition by the late
photographer Robert Mapplethorpe two weeks before it was scheduled
to open July 1.
   The Corcoran trustees subsequently twice endorsed her decision.
   Ms. Orr-Cahall said she canceled the Mapplethorpe show, which
contained homoerotic and sadomasochistic images and pictures of
nude children, to avoid embroiling the Corcoran in a looming
congressional battle over the grant-making policies of the National
Endowment for the Arts.
   The endowment, an independent federal agency, had partially
financed the Mapplethorpe exhibit's national tour, organized by the
Institute of Contemporary Arts in Philadelphia. The show had
appeared in Philadelphia and Chicago without incident.
   Ms. Orr-Cahall's decision, however, brought the wrath of the
artistic community, which accused the Corcoran of stifling freedom
of expression. Artists withdrew plans for two exhibitions of
contemporary art at the Corcoran, and a third exhibition was left
in limbo.
   Artist Lowell Nesbitt announced he had withdrawn a $1.5 million
bequest to the Corcoran from his will and would give the money
instead to the Phillips Collection, another private Washington art
gallery.
   Staff morale at the Corcoran plunged with the resignation of
Jane Livingston, the museum's chief curator who had arranged for
the Mapplethorpe show to appear there.
   Ms. Orr-Cahall, former chief curator of the Oakland Museum in
California, previously had rejected a request by a representative
of the Corcoran staff that she resign.
   But in her resignation letter Monday, she said that ``the time
has arrived for the Corcoran to turn its eyes to the future and to
make every effort to assure that it is not consumed by the kind of
contention that distracts the institution from achieving its
goals.''
   The controversy also was noted by Jewett.
   ``Events of the past several months have embroiled the Corcoran
in continuing public controversy, a controversy that has interfered
with the Corcoran's capacity to address its full energies and
attention to the curatorial and educational tasks of the museum and
the school that are the institution's fundamental
responsibilities,'' he said.
   Board Chairman David Lloyd Kreeger, a member of a special
trustees' committee appointed Sept. 25 to study ways to repair the
damage, said the panel was split on whether Ms. Orr-Cahall should
leave the gallery or remain.
   He said the panel was ready to leave the decision on her fate up
to the full board, which he said also was divided over the issue.
Kreeger and Jewett said the director signaled her intention to
resign during negotiations with board members last weekend.
   Kreeger said the trustees were not concerned about the
Mapplethorpe cancellation, but were upset by the ``continued
barrage'' of criticism that dogged the Corcoran.
   The director's decision, he said, ``was blown into a symbol ...
of repression, or pornography vs. license, freedom of speech,
political issues, the future of the endowment'' and other issues.
   ``Mapplethorpe no longer is the issue because the director has
resigned,'' said Kreeger, who vowed that ``there is going to be a
resurgent and a new and dynamic Corcoran.''

   Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu and
his Iranian counterpart Hashemi Rafsanjani began talks in Tehran on
Monday to cement economic ties amid political turbulence in Romania
stirred by Eastern Europe's reformist wave.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said the two met shortly after
Ceausescu arrived on a three-day official visit. It said further
meetings were planned to bolster political and economic links.
   Ceausescu told Rafsanjani, ``I am pleased to be the first
president to visit Iran after your election,'' Tehran radio
reported.
   Rafsanjani, elected president in July, assured Ceausescu ``there
are many fields of cooperation in boosting bilateral trade,'' it
added.
   IRNA and the radio were both monitored in Nicosia.
   Referring to Ceausescu's inflexibility while the political
change surged through Eastern Europe, IRNA praised Romania as ``the
sole East European country rigidly adhering to its past
government.''
   Ceausescu, elected Romanian Communist Party chief in 1965, is
the longest-serving leader in the Soviet bloc.
   He has stamped out almost all dissent in Romania. His crash
industrialization program and his frantic efforts to repay all of
Romania's $11 billion debt have led to perennial shortages of
consumer goods and rationing of basic foodstuffs.
   On Monday, Romania sealed its border with Yugoslavia to all but
official traffic after an anti-government demonstration turned
violent in Timisoara, west Romania.
   The Iranian agency said others attending Monday's talks in
Tehran were Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, Vice President
Masoud Roghani Zanjani and Heavy Industries Minister Hadi
Nejad-Husseinian of Iran, and Deputy Prime Minister Ion Radu,
Foreign Minister Ion Stoian and presidential adviser Constantion
Mitea of Romania.
   Ceausescu's politically powerful wife Elena stayed behind in
Romania, although she usually accompanies her husband on trips
abroad.
   Ceausescu will complete agreements reached by the
Tehran-Bucharest commission that met in Iran last week.
   ``The Iran-Romania summit is an expression of the positive
course of relations between our countries and people,' Ceausescu
was quoted as telling the English-language daily, the Tehran Times.
   Contacts so far were having good results ``especially in
economic and technical-scientific cooperation,'' he said in
excerpts quoted by IRNA. The interview apparently was conducted
earlier in Bucharest.
   Romania is a major trading partner with Iran.
   The agreements Ceausescu is expected to conclude will boost
their volume of trade from about $1.8 billion this year to $3
billion, IRNA said.
   Tehran radio reported Sunday that Iran will export about 1
million barrels of oil and 1 billion cubic meters of natural gas a
year to Romania.
   The agreement was concluded Sunday at a meeting between Iranian
Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh and Radu.
   Iran earlier this year announced plans to export 5 million
metric tons of crude oil to Romania in return for tractors, oil
drilling equipment and military equipment, including tanks.
   IRNA said that under Sunday's agreement, Romania will supply
equipment for constructing Tehran's subway system.
   Romanian experts are also working with the Iranians on a major
irrigation dam project at Raveh, 20 miles south of Tehran.
   Budapest radio, quoting unidentified witnesses, said security
forces on Monday sealed off Timisoara, which has a population of
350,000 and is the largest city in the ethnically mixed region of
Transylvania.
   Reports of deaths there have surfaced.
   Romanian emigres said thousands of demonstrators battled
security forces over the weekend after ransacking a library and
burning books by Ceausescu.

<TEXT>
   Q: You mentioned _ noted that you were successful on no new
taxes last year. How should we read your lips for next year? Are
you taking the same vow and is it as irreversible and irrevocable
as it was this year?
   BUSH: As far as I'm concerned, it is. But I can say that I kept
my promise to the American people, and I want to continue keeping
it.
   Q: Mr. President, I think on the minds of everyone today in
terms of headline news is Panama. Do you _
   BUSH: It's certainly on my mind as a headline news, I'll tell
you.
   Q: Well, you said these were the things on your mind, so it _
   BUSH: No, but you're _ I'm glad you raised it, because if you
hadn't, I had intended to, because it was clearly on my mind.
   Q: What are you going to do? Is it _ I'm not going to say what
are you going to do.
   BUSH: No, but let me just say one thing and put it into context.
One of the frustrations that I've had during this year is that _ is
the whole Panama situation _ an enormous frustration. I see a
little more reason to be hopeful in Nicaragua, although I have some
serious concerns now about how free and fair those elections are
going to be, having talked to Bob Beckel and Mary Matalin in that
thing. But, no, I'm glad you brought it up, Helen, because it's an
enormous frustration to me that the democratic system that was
voted on in Panama was totally put down by force.
   Q: What are your options _
   Q: What can you do about it? I mean, you have exhausted a lot of
_
   BUSH: For one, I can tell you how strongly I feel about it,
which I've just done. And, two, review whatever actions might be
available. And three, not discuss what they might be.
   Q: Well, do you feel you do have options?
   BUSH: I think a president _ all presidents have options, but
they don't discuss what they might be.
   Q: Including military options?
   BUSH: Presidents have options, but they don't discuss what they
might be.
   Q: Well, does the murder of this officer _ American officer down
there over the weekend _ does that show that actually the United
States is pretty powerless to do anything in Panama _ that they can
do this and get away with it?
   BUSH: It's an enormous outrage and a matter of enormous concern
to this President.
   Q: Is there anything you can do about it?
   BUSH: It's an enormous outrage and of tremendous concern to this
President, and I would refer you to the previous question and
answer.
   Q: Mr. President, on the budget, you say you're nearing the end
of the budget process. But it seems to me you want to stay in
concrete on most of the things that were a part of the Cold War.
You want the nuclear bombs in the air 24 hours a day and you don't
seem to want to retreat. Who's the enemy?
   BUSH: Helen, we`re having a massive re-evaluation of intentions,
as well as military threat. And we have set a very aggressive arms
control agenda, and I'd like to see us take those steps. And I
think the Soviets want to move forward in these areas of chemical
reduction, or elimination, START, CFE. So let's go forward with our
eyes open and do that. And I think that's exactly what Mr.
Gorbachev wants to do. And Mr. Gorbachev _ they still have an
enormous deployment of troops against U.S. forces, NATO forces.
They still have an enormous arsenal and modernized nuclear weapons.
But the steps we're taking can make the determination as to what
the threat remains for the '90s. And so I will not take any naive
unilateral action, but I'm determined to move forward on a sensible
program of evaluation, and on a sensible program of arms reduction,
which includes conventional forces.
   Q: So there won't be any big cuts this year?
   BUSH: You saw the numbered bandied about out there, and I'll
stand by that number, although, I can't confirm exactly what the
final figure is going to be, because we're right down to the wire
right now. But if people are looking for us to go up there with
massive cuts now, I would say to them, look, put your energies on
helping us get the kinds of agreements that will enable everybody
to recommend massive cuts.

<TEXT>
   The Pantex nuclear weapons assembly plant in
Texas appeared to have no plan to handle May's accidental release
of radioactive gas, according to an advisory committee report to
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins released Monday.
   ``It is still unclear that effective control of the situation by
an adequately prepared response team ever took place,'' John F.
Ahearne, chairman of the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Facility
Safety, said in a letter to Watkins.
   The letter also raised questions about safety and environmental
practices at Pantex, the nation's only final assembly plant for
nuclear bombs and missile warheads.
   The committee said the response to the May release of tritium, a
radioactive gas, was of ``variable quality.''
   Radiation specialists and technicians responded properly to
minimize workers' exposure at the plant outside Amarillo, but
``missing was recognition that this `unlikely event' could take
place, and thus adequate procedures, instrumentation, and training
were lacking,'' the committee said.
   Although a quick and effective evacuation was conducted,
thereafter, ``events are marked by confusion, misread instruments,
and uncertain actions. There appeared to be no plan to handle what
surely must be an anticipated accident.''
   Exposure to workers was below federal guidelines limiting
radiation explosure and ``off-site exposure was trivial.''
   A team of government and outside experts recently inspected the
plant and found Pantex would be unable to respond effectively to
emergencies involving releases of radioactive material.
   Watkins said those findings indicate workers lack adequate
protection from emergency and rountine exposures to radioactive
releases and that the situation must be corrected immediately.
   Pantex spokesman Tom Walton said the plant had begun correcting
problems, or ``will be addressing those in the very near future.''
Some safety violations were corrected immediately, he said.
   ``We of course are already looking at those things they've
identified and in areas that we need to improve, obviously, we're
going to make improvements,'' Walton said.
   Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigators, who
also inspected the plant, found more than 300 safety violations,
dozens of them serious.

   Killings in the French Quarter got widespread
publicity but drug-related shootings in low-income areas made 1989
New Orleans' most murderous year on record, the head of the police
force said Monday.
   Two unrelated weekend killings brought the city's murder total
so far this year to 242, two above the 1979 record of 240, Police
Superintendent Warren Woodfork said.
   Almost 60 percent of the slayings were drug-related and about 40
percent took place in public housing projects, Woodfork said.
   In spite of city budget problems, Mayor Sidney Barthelemy has
promised more overtime money for the city's 1,300-member police
force in 1991, saying expected federal grants will help.
   Woodfork said too many people are apathetic about the drug
problem and complained that the media paint the wrong picture in
covering New Orleans murders.
   ``Look at the story you all tend to put out on the front page of
the paper or the first story on television when a tourist is killed
in the French Quarter, et cetera.'' Woodfork said. ``But that's not
the bulk of your homicides.''
   He referred to two widely publicized killings of French Quarter
visitors this year. One man was shot to death by a robber and
another was killed when he tried to intervene in a purse snatching.
   ``Those kind of homicides incidental to robberies, if you look
at the scheme of things, that's small compared to the day-to-day
homicides in housing developments and other areas of the city. I'm
saying something needs to be done about those,'' Woodfork said.
   In August, federal Uniform Crime Reports showed New Orleans had
the fourth-highest murder rate in the nation in 1988 with 228
people killed.
   According to the statistics released by Woodfork, the motive
listed for 59.5 percent of the murders was narcotics; arguments
were the motive in 15.7 percent; domestic disputes, 9.5 percent;
robbery, 7.85 percent.
   Motives in the remainder were listed as burglary, child abuse or
unknown.
   Woodfork said the public must fight drug abuse.
   ``If it's not your problem today, I can guarantee you, it will
be yours tomorrow,'' he said.
   Woodfork said other major cities also have seen their 1989
murder rates increase, including Atlanta with 242 murders
year-to-date compared to 219 for 1988; and Washington, D.C., with
414 so far this year compared to 369 in 1988.
   The two killings that pushed the city over its previous record
occurred Sunday.
   In one, two men were shot when they interrupted some horseplay
among several other men outside a pool hall, police said. One died.
   In the second killing, a man was shot in the Fischer housing
project. The victim and two other men had left an apartment and
gotten into an argument. The victim was shot three times. Police
said they didn't know what the argument was about.

<HEAD>Survey Finds White High School Seniors More Likely to Use Drugs</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 3 grafs after 4th graf pvs `The key ...' to UPDATE with
quotes from news conference. Picks up 5th graf pvs `The survey ...'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drug-use survey of students nationwide found
that white high school seniors are more apt to abuse drugs than
black seniors, according to figures released Monday.
   ``It goes against conventional wisdom _ particularly television
has portrayed the problem of drug abuse in the United States as a
black, inner city problem,'' said Doug Hall, vice president of the
national Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education Inc.
   Atlanta-based PRIDE surveyed 296,180 white students and 59,898
black students in grades 6-12 at 958 schools in 38 states during
the 1988-89 school year, including students in inner city areas in
Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, New York and Washington, D.C.
   ``The key is keeping teen-agers in school,'' PRIDE co-founder
Marsha Keith Schuchard said in a statement. ``Black students who
stay in school have significantly fewer drug and alcohol problems.''
   The focus on inner-city drug use by blacks ``feeds the
increasing expressions of racism that surface daily in our
country,'' she said at a news conference announcing the survey
results.
   ``The preoccupation with blacks and crack also misleads white
parents into underestimating the temptations and dangers their
teens face from the multibillion-dollar drug culture.''
   Judge Reggie Walton, associate director of the Office of
National Drug Control Policy, called drugs an American problem.
   ``For all too long, this problem has been portrayed as a black
problem, and I think the end result has been that there are some
people who have not really cared a lot about it because of that,''
he said. ``This is an American problem, not just a black problem.''
   The survey found that ``black students find cocaine about twice
as available as white students, but they use cocaine less than
white students, by a substantial amount,'' Hall said.
   About 15 percent of black students overall said cocaine was easy
to get, compared with 8 percent of white students who responded
that way, he said, noting that cocaine referred to both the powder
and its smokable derivative, crack.
   However, in the 12th grade, in which some 40,000 students were
surveyed, only 4 percent of the black students said they had used
cocaine at least once in the previous year, while 7 percent of
white students said they had done so.
   The picture changes a bit when the students were asked about
frequency of use of cocaine.
   Three percent of black male seniors and 2 percent of white male
seniors said they used cocaine ``very frequently,'' meaning once a
week, three times a week or daily.
   At the same time, 4 percent of both black and white male seniors
reported using cocaine ``frequently,'' meaning at least once a
month.
   Meanwhile, 11 percent of black male seniors and 12 percent of
white male seniors said they used marijuana very frequently, and 14
percent of black male seniors and 17 percent of white male seniors
said they used liquor very frequently.
   The students surveyed by PRIDE filled out anonymous
questionnaires that were spot checked internally with somewhat
duplicated questions to determine the truthfulness of responses.
There also were occasional retests of groups of students, Hall said.
   There was no overall margin of error because the results were
based on actual responses and the survey was not a scientific,
random poll.
   Hall said the survey found that, in general, the girls used less
drugs than the boys.
   ``The person who is least likely to use is a black female,'' he
said.
   In general, use of drugs is greatest for white male seniors,
followed by black males, white females and black females, he said.
   Among the survey's findings for overall drug use for high school
seniors _ boys and girls who had used certain drugs at least once
in the year before they were questioned _ were:
   _Hard liquor: 65 percent of white seniors, 37 percent of black
seniors. For high school students in general, 57 percent of white
students, 29 percent of black students.
   _Marijuana: 29 percent of white seniors, 17 percent of black
seniors. For all high school students, 24 percent of white
students, 13 percent of black students.
   As for intoxication levels, a higher percentage of white male
seniors than black male seniors reported getting very high, bombed
or stoned on liquor, marijuana and cocaine.
   For alcohol, the figures were 42 percent of white male seniors
saying they got very intoxicated vs. 22 percent for black male
seniors.
   The figures were 23 percent for white males and 15 percent for
black males for marijuana and 7 percent for white males and 5
percent for black males for cocaine.
   PRIDE was founded by a group of parents to fight drug abuse.

<HEAD>FAA Knew About Moscow Embassy Warning Before Flight 103</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration was
advised eight days before the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 that the
U.S. Embassy in Moscow was warning employees of a terrorist threat
against Pan Am flights on the same route, a presidential panel
disclosed Monday.
   FAA officials acknowledged that they had received a telex from
the embassy on Dec. 13, 1988, but said they did nothing about it
even though they said it is against government policy to warn
employees but not the general public of such threats.
   The issue of a dual standard in warnings of potential terrorism
is one of several being taken up by the seven-member Presidental
Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism, which held its
second hearing into the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing over Lockerbie,
Scotland, of Flight 103, in which 270 people died.
   The panel also received the results of a congressional report
that said stepped-up security measures since the disaster may be
ineffective at high-risk foreign airports due to a lack of training
standards.
   The report by the General Accounting Office faults the FAA for
not establishing minimum training requirements for people who
screen baggage and conduct other security operations at foreign
airports.
   Kenneth Mead, GAO director for transportation issues, told the
commission that the congressional watchdog agency has found several
``fundamental deficiencies'' in FAA security programs.
   Earlier reports, he noted, had found problems with passenger
screening, airport security controls and security inspections.
   Mead said the FAA has concurred with most of the agency's
findings and made some changes but does not keep close enough tabs
on security on a daily basis.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., a commission member, said the
congressional studies indicate that ``the FAA and the present
system have flunked when it comes to providing basic security
systems that anyone can have confidence in.''
   D'Amato said problems with the FAA suggest there may be a
conflict between its role of promoting aviation and that of
ensuring passenger safety.
   Producing a copy of the telex from the Moscow embassy to the
FAA, D'Amato said it proves the FAA was aware that U.S. officials
were warning State Department employees, but not the general
public, about the threat.
   ``Since a number of people from this post will be flying out of
Frankfurt in the next two weeks, post plans to issue an internal
administrative notice warning employees of the threat,'' said the
telex to the FAA. ``No recommendation will be made as to course of
action to be followed by travelers.''
   Relatives of Flight 103 victims say they believe several
government employees changed reservations to get off the flight
after the warning, while the general public was not informed of the
threat, which specified a Pan Am flight within two weeks after Dec.
5 en route from Frankfurt to New York.
   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt and was en route to New York
from London when it blew up.
   Officials later said the specific threat that had prompted the
warning was not credible, and they believe it was only a
coincidence that it came just two weeks before the bombing.

<HEAD>Israel Opens Embassy in Ethiopia in Bid for More Jews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel has opened an embassy in Ethiopia and
intends to establish a consular section to encourage the emigration
of more Jews to Israel, the Foreign Ministry said Monday.
   Israeli officials have declined comment on persistent reports
suggesting the renewal of ties would lead to Israeli military aid
to Ethiopia in exchange from allowing more Jews to leave.
   The Israeli Embassy was opened Sunday under the supervision of
temporary representative Meir Yoffe, and an ambassador in Addis
Ababa will soon be appointed, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
   Yoffe said his first priority would be establishing a consular
section to deal with Jewish emigration.
   Speaking on Israel Radio in a telephone interview from Addis
Ababa, Yoffe indicated Foreign Minister Moshe Arens may visit
Ethiopia for the official opening ceremony. He did not give a date
for the ceremony.
   A Foreign Ministry statement said earlier this month that Israel
hoped more Jews would emigrate from Ethiopia once Israel
established its embassy there.
   Ethiopia renewed diplomatic relations with Israel on Nov. 3. It
was one of more than 12 black African nations that severed ties
with Israel over the 1973 Middle East war. Several have renewed
relations since 1982.
   ``It is a wonderful and exciting feeling,'' said Yoffe, who was
the last Israeli diplomat to leave Ethiopia in 1973. ``We are
received with joy and sympathy by the government and in the
streets, in all the places we go ... people remember us.''
   The Sunday Times of London has said Israel agreed to supply
spare parts for Soviet weapons in Ethiopia in exchange for
emigration of Jews. Israel has captured Soviet weapons from Arab
countries and Palestinian guerrillas in Lebanon.
   Ethiopian immigrants in Israel say up to 18,000 Jews want to
flee the East African nation, which has suffered from drought and
civil war.
   There are already about 16,500 Ethiopian Jews in Israel. About
8,000 of them were brought to Israel in a dramatic U.S.-assisted
``Operation Moses'' airlift in November 1984-January 1985. But
reports of the airlift leaked out and embarrassed the Ethiopia's
Marxist government, which ended the operation.

<HEAD>U.S. Senators Believe Government is Seeking Jesuit Killers</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Salvador-Christmas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two U.S. senators met rightist
President Alfredo Cristiani on Monday and asserted that his
government is committed to finding out who massacred six Jesuit
priests.
   Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Bob Graham of Florida, both
Democrats, told a news conference they expected continued U.S.
support for El Salvador. However, DeConcini said it was possible
aid would be cut off if the investigation shows military
involvement in the Nov. 16 killings.
   The slayings of the leadership of the Jesuit-run Central
American University prompted some U.S. legislators to call for
reappraisal of the $1.5 million in aid that Washington provides
daily to El Salvador.
   The Roman Catholic Church and the Jesuits have concluded
military men were almost certainly responsible for the massacre of
the Jesuits, their housekeeper and her daughter. A witness has
testified she saw men in army uniforms near the priests' on-campus
residence shortly before the fatal shots were heard.
   ``We believe President Cristiani and military leaders are
prepared to have any and all outside assistance to certify the
exhaustiveness and thoroughness of the investigtion wherever it
leads, including if it leads to the military,'' said DeConcini.
   FBI and Scotland Yard investigators, as well as detectives from
Spain, are collaborating in the inquiry.
   DeConcini said he would be ``flabbergasted'' if the
investigation found high-level military responsibility. He said if
such involvement were proven, a cutoff in U.S. aid ``would
certainly be a possibility.''
   If a small armed forces contingent acting on its own is found to
be responsible, an aid cutoff ``would still be a possibility, but
not very likely,'' he said.
   ``If the government continues its forceful and aggressive
investigation, support in Congress will be maintained,'' DeConcini
said.
   The Salvadoran government has offered a reward of $250,000 for
information leading to the prosecution of those responsible for the
massacre.
   The Jesuits were killed during a renewed offensive by leftist
guerrillas trying to overthrow the government. Right-wing forces
often view church people as guerrilla allies.

   President Bush said Monday the killing of an
American serviceman in Panama was ``an enormous outrage'' and that
the United States was considering options to deal with Manuel
Antonio Noriega. Bush did not rule out military steps.
   ``I think a president, all presidents, have options, but they
don't discuss what they might be,'' Bush said in an interview. He
repeated that answer when asked if military options were being
reviewed.
   Questioned about Noriega's declaration of a ``state of war''
between Panama and the United States, Bush said, ``I've taken note
of his statement.''
   A high-level interagency group met at the State Department to
discuss options on Panama, said sources who requested anonymity.
   The United States has been trying to force Noriega's ouster
since his indictment in Florida on drug-smuggling charges in
February 1988. The United States supported an unsuccessful coup
attempt against Noriega Oct. 3.
   On Friday, Noriega declared a state of war with the United
States and had himself installed by the national assembly as the
country's supreme leader.
   The next day, violence flared when four American officers,
traveling unarmed, in civilian clothes and in a private car, were
trying to flee a crowd of Panamanian troops and civilians after the
car had been stopped at a Panamanian roadblock, the Pentagon said.
   One serviceman was killed when the Panamanian soldiers opened
fire. Another U.S. officer's ankle was grazed by a bullet.
   After the shooting, the Panamanians arrested a U.S. Navy
lieutenant and his wife who had been stopped earlier at the
roadblock.
   During four hours of interrogation, the Pentagon said, that
officer was repeatedly beaten and kicked in the groin and his wife
was sexually thratened and slammed against a wall.
   Another incident occurred Monday, when an American officer shot
and wounded a Panamanian corporal near a U.S. installation, a
Southern Command official said. The official said the U.S. officer
believed the Panamanian was drawing his weapon and felt threatened.
   Bush, in an interview with The Associated Press and three other
news agencies, said, ``One of the frustrations that I've had during
this year is the whole Panama situation, an enormous frustration.''
   Asked how the United States would respond to the officer's
death, Bush said, ``It's an enormous outrage and a matter of
enormous concern to this president.''
   As for the steps available to him, Bush said, ``For one, I can
tell you how strongly I feel about it, which I've just done, and
two, review whatever options might be available, and three, not
discuss what they might be.''
   He said he wanted to have a free hand ``without having
positioned myself on what it is I want to do.''
   Meanwhile, Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo. a member of the House Armed
Services Committee, said the United States ``can't put up with
Noriega's actions'' and will have to take steps to stop the
arrests, detentions, beatings and harassment of U.S. forces.
   ``The question is how do we do it,'' Skelton said. ``Do we wait
for the PDF (Panamanian Defense Forces) to stage another coup or do
we take another step'' of unilateral military action.
   Bush and his predecessor, former President Reagan, have hinted
at military action against Noriega but have refrained from a direct
assault.
   Meanwhile, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the
United States was ``very concerned'' about Noriega's declaration of
war. He said it ``may have been a license for harassment and
threats and in this case murder.''
   Fitzwater said most U.S. dependents have left Panama or have
been moved onto the U.S. military base there. He said that a 9:50
p.m. curfew had been imposed over the weekend on U.S. military
personnel and that the base was on a high state of alert.
   ``There's no question that it's a dangerous situation,''
Fitzwater said.
   He said the mistreatment of the naval officer's wife ``certainly
goes beyond any previous experience. And the murder is outrageous
in itself.''
   The United States has 12,000 troops stationed in Panama.

   Q. Mr. President, the issue of China is on a lot of people's
minds. You seem to approach China differently than you approach
some other countries. I know when you talked to Mr. Gorbachev, you
gave him a list of human rights cases you want to resolve. Earlier
in the year, in your Texas A&amp;M speech, you laid out a number of
conditions and challenges to the Soviet Union. With China, you seem
to take almost a kid-glove approach. I mean, do you feel that they
require and demand different treatment or special treatment?
   BUSH: Some think up until recently the approach wasn't kid
glove, it was almost isolation. That's what some felt, Mike, before
I sent a mission over there. Some thought that we were just totally
isolating China. So I don't quite understand your comparison.
   Q: Well, there was a massacre in Tiananmen Square and a few _
   BUSH: And we strongly disapproved of it and spoke out against
it. And I still strongly disapprove of it and I'm delighted to
speak out against it. So, why are you _ what is you _ I missed your
question.
   Q: Well, was there ever any consideration of a more low-key
meeting, for example, without toasts and dinners, which may have
sent some people a signal somewhat different than outrage, but of
the _ let bygones by bygones?
   BUSH: I don't think anyone is sending that kind of _ that
anything should be read into that. I know some of my political
opponents have done that. There's a concerted effort by the
Democratic Party to do that, by their leadership, by the chairman
of the Democratic National Committee. But he is burdened with a
lack of knowledge about China.
   Q: Mr. President, when do you expect Mr. Fang Lizhi will be
allowed to leave the country?
   BUSH: I don't know when that will happen.
   Q: Did you get any concessions?
   BUSH: I won't discuss the specifics.
   Q: Why?
   BUSH: Because I don't believe in doing that, Helen.
   Q: They didn't promise you anything?
   BUSH: I'm more interested in action than I am in premature
speculation. And I notice now that some of the critics who were so
opposed in using this fantastically diabolically anti-me language,
they come up now in saying, well, if you get a, b and c, then it
will be all right, or then we'll understand. Let them just stay
tuned in.
   Q: Well, did you get any concessions? I'm not asking _
   BUSH: I'm not going to discuss what I did or didn't get.
   Q: But there's still plenty _
   BUSH: You see, I still believe that sometimes to effect change
you talk in confidence to people. Now I know that doesn't go _
that's not in keeping with your line of work. You want everything
to be public and I understand it. But I've got to say, I'm very
sorry, I'm not going to discuss it.
   Q: You're out on a limb praising the reforms _ democratic
movement in Eastern Europe and you go and salute a brutal regime.
   BUSH: I don't think it's a salute.
   Q: It seems very _
   BUSH: But I do _ if the question is, do I want to further
isolate a billion-plus people, the answer is no. And if the
question is, do I think we can _ do I think by having certain kinds
of relations with China, not only have we furthered the move more
openness, but can in the future, I think the answer is, yes.
   Q: Well, you're dealing with a country. You're not dealing with
a billion people. You're dealing with a regime that _
   BUSH: Yes, but you're dealing with the aspirations of a billion
people. And I happen to think that some of the contacts that
they've had with the United States have led to a better life for
the billion people.
   Q: Mr. President, there were some _
   BUSH: And I think that's an important point to make. And that
isn't in any way condoning the brutality that everybody in the
world saw in Tiananmen Square. And what I object to is the way
Michael _ some of the people phrase _ put things into him, so that
he phrased his question the way he did. Because that is not a good
rap. And it's not true. And for those who suggest it is, they ought
to just be a little patient and wait and see. And I've noticed a
lot of people that know China best seem to think that maybe this is
the way to effect positive change.
   Q: There were some words of moderation _
   BUSH: So I'm _ you know, I'm just going to stay with my position
and take on a little heat from time to time. And we'll wait and see
what happens.
   Q: Did you expect this kind of heat?
   BUSH: It hadn't been that much.
   Q: Are you kidding?
   BUSH: Well, you think so. I don't think so.
   Q: Well, I can assure you that people out there really _
   BUSH: Out where?
   Q: Out in _ everywhere.
   BUSH: But not after this interview because they'll understand it
more. (Laughter.) They've been dealing with emotion and not facts.

were among the top advances for women's rights in 1989, according
to a survey released Monday by an advocacy group.
   A report of increasing risks to women's health because of
cigarette smoking and breast cancer, a series of Supreme Court
decisions on job discrimination and a presidential veto of a bill
to permit use of Medicaid funds for abortions were among the most
important setbacks, according to the Legal Defense and Education
Fund of the National Organization for Women.
   Another setback was the Webster decision in the Supreme Court
that, the defense fund said, ``provided states with new authority
and encouragement to limit a woman's right to abortion, although
technically not overturning its 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade.''
   Listed under ``Terrific Trends,'' was a congressional move to
provide more child care options for America's families and the
expansion of the rights of gay and lesbian people living together.
   ``We'll look back on 1989 as a watershed year,'' said Helen
Neuborne, executive director of the fund.
   ``Setbacks for women's reproductive and employment rights
renewed the challenges to the women's movement and revitalized
women's activism,'' Ms. Neuborne said. ``Public opinion polls show
that the overwhelming majority of women recognize and appreciate
feminism's achievements and realize that a strong movement is still
needed.''
   The survey listed 150 events of 1989 and singled out eight as
top advances.
   They were:
   _The 27th woman, an all-time high, sworn in as a member of the
House of Representatives.
   _A record settlement of $14 million in back pay in a case
charging race and sex discrimination against employees of the
Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
   _The turnout for women's rights marches in April and November.
   _An injunction upheld by a federal appeals court barring
protesters from blocking access to abortion clinics.
   _The rejection by the Florida State Legislature of anti-choice
proposals and a state Supreme Court ruling striking down a parent's
consent requirement for girls under 18 seeking an abortion.
   _The election of pro-choice gubernatorial candidates in New
Jersey and Virginia.
   _New protections in the federal Fair Housing Act for families
with children.
   _Rejection by the Canadian Supreme Court of an injuction won by
a woman's former boyfriend that barred her from having an abortion.
   Setbacks listed by the fund:
   _A series of decisions by the Supreme Court cutting back the
rights of workers to be protected from sex and race discrimination
in employment
   _Statistics showing nearly 10 percent of AIDS cases were women
and nearly two percent were children under 13.
   _An article in the Harvard Business Review advocating a ``mommy
track'' in business.
   _The Webster decision.
   _President Bush's veto of the Medicaid bill.
   _The new findings on cigarette smoking and breast cancer.

   The wife of Ukrainian dissident Mikhailo Horyn
was being treated in the United States on Monday after 105 members
of Congress asked Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to give her a
temporary exit visa.
   Olha Horyn, who arrived in the United States on Saturday, had
applied for a temporary visa seven months ago. She did not
immediately get it despite a new Soviet law that guarantees a
decision on medical visa requests within three days, said Rep.
Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y.
   Slaughter sent the letter, signed by 104 colleagues, Nov. 8.
   Mrs. Horyn had applied for a visa after receiving an offer of
free medical treatment from St. Barnabas Medical Center in
Livingston, N.J. The care she will receive there over the next
three months is not available in the Soviet Union, said Bozhena
Olshaniwsky, president of Americans for Human Rights in the Ukraine.
   Mrs. Horyn had a radical mastectomy 10 years ago, but is
suffering back pain that may indicate the cancer has returned,
Olshaniwsky said.
   Olshaniwsky said she believed Mrs. Horyn's visa was blocked
because of her and her husband's political activity.
   Mikhailo Horyn, a former political prisoner, is general
secretary of the Ukrainian national movement, Rukh, and the brother
of dissident leader Bogdan Horyn. Mikhailo Horyn is a candidate for
a seat in the Ukrainian parliament.

   The toll from a savage Atlantic storm rose to at
least 32 on Monday after two fishing boats sank, high winds blew
two cars into a head-on collision and a wave swept a teen-age
angler out to sea.
   Twelve people were known dead and 20 were missing and feared
dead in France, Britain, Portugal and at sea in the storm that
broke Saturday with heavy rains, lightning and winds of up to 90
mph blowing from the southwest Atlantic.
   Widespread damage was reported in western France, where
gale-force winds tore roofs from homes, toppled trees and telephone
lines, and knocked over structures.
   Rescue teams searched for 11 sailors missing in stormy seas off
the mid-Atlantic Azores islands after the fishing boat Velasco II
went down about 480 miles northeast of Sao Miguel island Sunday
night, Portuguese navy officials said. Waves were more than 25 feet
high at the time of the sinking.
   On mainland Portugal, two people died in storm-related
incidents, road and rail transport were disrupted by storms and
fire services in towns along the river Tagus were overwhelmed with
emergency calls about flooding.
   The French death toll rose to 10 with the discovery of a drowned
fisherman near the Brittany island of Brehat.
   Two people died Sunday night on the superhighway near Lille when
a gust of wind pushed a car driven by Laurent Dufour, 28, into the
path of a vehicle carrying a family of five. Dufour and Odile
Denneulin, 15, died instantly and the four others were injured.
   Near Toulon, a teen-ager drowned Sunday when a huge wave swept
him out to sea as he fished from the shore.
   In Mauleon, 230 miles southwest of Paris, Raymond Etcheberry,
43, died Saturday when a gust knocked him off the roof of a shed he
was repairing.
   Two men died when waves swept ashore and then carried them out
to sea Saturday.
   Three people near Paris died Sunday afternoon when the storm
pushed briefly into the capital.
   The captain of an Irish coastal steamer was washed overboard
early Sunday in the Bay of Biscay off France.
   All six fishermen were believed lost when a fishing boat sank
Saturday in Scotland's Firth of Clyde.
   Waves swept two teen-aged British boys out to sea in separate
incidents Sunday.
   In Greece, fog disrupted air and sea traffic. Athens airport was
closed. A spokesman for the nearby port of Piraeus said no ships
were entering or leaving the harbor.

   A bill that grants a 4.7 percent increase in
benefits to 2.2 million veterans and dependents was signed into law
by President Bush on Monday.
   The measure also provides the increase to 312,000 surviving
spouses and children of veterans and matches the cost-of-living
adjustment that Social Security beneficiaries and veterans
pensioners are receiving this month.
   ``Our nation provides compensation and other monetary benefits
to service-disabled veterans and dependency and indemnity
compensation benefits to the survivors of those who died as a
result of military service to our country,'' Bush said in a
statement. ``My administration is committed to ensuring that these
payments keep pace with changes in the cost of living.''
   The bill includes:
   _A modest increase in use fees for the veterans' housing loan
guaranty program, which has provided home financing for more than
13 million veterans since the end of World War II.
   _An extension of the program for helping states colnstruct
facilities for veterans care ;and a program in which VA contracts
with halfway houses for care of homeless, chronically mentally ill
veterans.

   A senior Israeli official met Monday with U.S.
officials to try to lay the groundwork for eventual
Israeli-Palestinian talks, but the State Department had no comment
on whether progress was made.
   Israeli Cabinet Secretary Eliakim Rubinstein conferred with
Dennis Ross, a top aide to Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
Further discussions will be held Tuesday.
   Baker is attempting to bring the Israeli and Egyptian foreign
ministers to Washington next month for talks with him about the
proposed Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.
   If all proceeds as planned under Baker's five-point proposal,
Palestinian elections eventually would take place in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip. Both Israel and Egypt have accepted the Baker plan
but have attached certain reservations.
   Egypt has been serving as an intermediary between Baker and the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Egypt is sending no special representative from Cairo for this
week's discussions but Ambassador Sayed el Reedy is available for
consultations.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is vehemently opposed to
any PLO participation in the dialogue while Egypt insists the PLO
must have a role if the peace effort is to succeed.

<HEAD>Watkins Adds New Condition to Restarting Nuclear Reactors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a concession to environmentalists, the
Energy Department will not restart its Savannah River defense
nuclear reactors until an environmental impact study is completed,
according to a department letter obtained Monday.
   It was not immediately clear whether the decision would mean a
further delay in restarting the three reactors, which were shut
down last year to undergo massive safety upgrades, worker
retraining and management restructuring.
   The first of the reactors, the nation's only source of tritium
needed to make nuclear warheads, is tentatively scheduled to resume
production next fall.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins told members of the House and
Senate armed services committees in letters sent Friday that he
decided to drop the department's objection to completing the
environmental study before restarting the reactors.
   The department had agreed a study was needed, but maintained
there was no legal requirement to finish it before resuming tritium
production.
   ``Because the decision-making process will be enhanced by the
information and opportunity for public comment presented by the EIS
(environmental impact study), the department will complete the EIS
before it makes any decision to resume'' production, Watkins wrote.
   A copy of the letter was released by the office of Rep. James
Hansen, R-Utah, a committee member.
   Department spokesman Will Callicott said he could not
immediately comment on the decision except to say an environmental
impact statement is being developed and is tentatively scheduled
for completion in August.
   Three national environmental groups _ Greenpeace, the Natural
Resources Defense Council and the Energy Research Foundation _ sued
the Energy Department in December 1988 seeking to force completion
of the study before restart.
   Dan Reicher, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said his group had not seen details of Watkins' decision
but that it appeared the Energy Department had conceded defeat.
   ``It appears to us we've had a major victory,'' Reicher said.
``It looks as though the Energy Department has seen the error of
its ways.''

<HEAD>Opposition in Both Germanys Fight Reunification</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 8 grafs to include Leipzig march; picks up 8th `The
broad'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Both East German reformers and West Germany's
opposition Social Democrats said Monday the sovereignty of both
Germanys must be protected at Tuesday's summit, where the issue of
reunification will be raised.
   Representatives of 16 East German political parties,
pro-democracy groups and social organizations holding their second
session on the nation's future said Monday the summit was a sign of
both hope and a possible danger.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany and Hans Modrow, the
Communist premier of East Germany, are to meet in Dresden on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Kohl has made clear that his government seeks eventual
reunification of Germany, which has been divided since 1945.
   Modrow and many other East Germans, however, feel joining the
two states would threaten the stability of Europe and result in a
``sellout'' of East German land and industry.
   Monday night in Leipzig, about 200 pro-reunification activists
tried to disrupt a silent procession of about 200,000 people
bearing candles to commemorate victims of past intolerance. They
were hushed quickly.
   Delegates to the East German talks said the Kohl-Modrow meetings
``express the expectation that the visit will contribute to the
building of relations between East Germany and West Germany.''
   They alwo warned, however, that Kohl's visit ``may in no case
put the sovereignty or state identity of either German nation in
question.''
   The broad forum includes Communist Party chief Gregor Gysi, as
well as Interim President Manfred Gerlach of the Liberal Democrats
and pairs of representatives from the Neues Forum opposition group
and more than a dozen others.
   Many of the small parties and citizens' movements are
positioning themselves for the forthcoming election campaign for
parliamentary seats, as well as airing their views on how the
nation should be reformed after four decades of Communist
domination.
   East Germany's first free elections are set for May 6, a result
of the first forum held Dec. 7.
   Under pressure from mass pro-democracy protests, East Germany in
the past two months also has ousted its hard-line leaders, opened
the Berlin Wall and other borders, and ushered in reforms.
   In West Berlin, the opposition Social Democratic Party opened
its national convention Monday, focusing on how the two German
nations should be brought together in the new age of open borders.
   Party leader Hans-Jochen Vogel, who is likely to challenge Kohl
in federal elections for the West German leadership a year from
now, said East Germany must be allowed to find its own path.
   Vogel appealed for a ``border-transcending solidarity'' to
prevent further mass emigration from East Germany.
   More than 300,000 East Germans have fled to West Germany in
1989, many giving up hope that their state could rectify its
daunting economic problems or institute democracy in the place of
Stalinism.
   The westward tide has ebbed somewhat since the borders were
opened Nov. 9 and East Germans were allowed to come and go as they
pleased.
   But Germans on both sides of the border fear that if visible
improvement in the lives of East Germans is not achieved soon, the
exodus will increase.
   Gerlach, who was named interim president Dec. 6 after former
leader Egon Krenz was forced to resign, said the situation is
``already critical.''
   Gerlach said the basic supply of goods and services to the
public is threatened after Jan. 1 if labor and distribution are not
improved by then.
   An East German newspaper disclosed Monday that a new law on
trade unions to be presented to parliament will include a right to
strike.
   Neues Forum on Monday urged both German states to ``recognize
the current borders in Europe.'' The appeal aims to fix the postwar
territorial order in Europe, thereby preventing formal
reunification.
   ``The major problems facing our world _ securing peace,
improving the environment, social and economic issues _ are not
solvable by single states,'' the leading opposition group contended.
   Gerlach conceded that despite resistance by both unofficial
citizens' groups and the parties represented in Parliament,
reunification is forcing itself into negotiations.
   ``There may be no formal negotiations, but in reality it is
being discussed in both states,'' said Gerlach, who opposes any
union with West Germany that would result in loss of East German
sovereignty.
   The talks got off to a disorderly start, with hundreds of angry
demonstrators shouting outside the ground-floor conference room
where the party and citizen group representatives were assembled.
Speakers inside couldn't be heard above the noise of protesters
chanting through bullhorns that they wanted to be included at the
talks.
   ``Anyone who tries to push his participation in this way is not
acting in the interests of democracy,'' Gerlach said.
   The participants agreed to include nine other groups at the
talks as representatives or observers.
   Discussion of proposals for a new constitution and laws on the
media, political groups, campaign funding and other issues
connected with the reform movement will be carried on state radio
and TV, they decided.
   They agreed to hold regular meetings Mondays through the interim
period before elections. But the next regular session was set for
Dec. 27 in view of the Christmas holiday.
   They also decided to meet Friday to discuss economic problems
with Deputy Premier Christa Luft.
   Another new political party was founded Monday, adding to the
dozens already in existence. The new group named itself Nelken, or
``The Cloves,'' and said it would adhere to traditional Marxist
principles.

   Q. Well, isn't that what life is all about?
   BUSH: Once they deal with a full deck, I expect people will
understand it. But there are some times in this job, you've got to
do something like that. And you just have to worry about it. You've
got to, you know, have the conviction that you're doing what you
think is correct. That's what the people elected me to do. This
gets way over any other issue, incidentally. And so I can't worry.
If you'd asked me 10 years ago so and so criticized you _ all the
people out there are criticizing you; doesn't this concern you? And
you'd have gotten an honest answer out of me, I'd probably have
said, yeah. But not any more. Because in this job, you don't do
that. You do what you think is correct. If you screw something up,
you say, hey, I was wrong. But if you're right, you don't need to
get instant credit for it. So you just try to do your best.
   Q: Can we move beyond China, and let me ask you about another
part of the world. There were some words of moderation out of Iran
after the death of Ayatollah Khomeini, but nothing concrete seems
to have happened since then. Are we missing anything?
   BUSH: I don't think we're missing anything, but I think your
predicate is correct there.
   Q: Well, but has there _ my predicate that there has been no
concrete action?
   BUSH: Yes.
   Q: There hasn't been?
   BUSH: I haven't seen anything that I can consider particularly
hopeful, but we'll continue to be alert for anything that the
Iranians decide to do.
   Q: So it's a year later for the hostages in Iran _
   BUSH: Exactly.
   Q: _ in Lebanon.
   BUSH: And that's an enormous frustration to me. I wrote notes to
the families the other day, and I just _ at the end of the year,
you count your own blessings, and you have to go through your mind
the concerns you feel about others. And this one I feel very
strongly about. And I feel a regret that I haven't been able to
facilitate the release of these hostages.
   On the other side of the world, I feel pleased that, thanks to
the good work of General Vessey, we've been able to further account
for Americans missing. And I'm talking, obviously, about Vietnam.
But in this one, I feel a personal frustration about it. It's on my
mind an awful lot. And if we want to talk about frustrations, I
feel that about the lack of peace and tranquility in Lebanon. I
feel _ we could go around the world, because I've tried to
highlight positive things here. But there's been some like this
one, Terry, that I feel frustrated about at year's end. The holding
of these kinds, the young people _
   Q: Mitterrand said that you couldn't have a Palestinian solution
without the Palestinian participation _
   BUSH: Yes, that's right.
   Q: _ in the transcript. Do you agree?
   BUSH: Well, I think what Jim Baker is trying to work out is to
have a voice of Palestinians at the talks. And it's a very
difficult process. But Mubarak tried to do the same thing.
   Q: Why is it difficult?
   BUSH: Simply because it is difficult, and the discussions
compelling Israel to negotiate with a particular Palestinian entity
is impossible. So find a way to get talks going. And that's what I
would like to see us do. And that's what we're trying hard to do.
   Q: Can you have any kind of real or meaningful peace settlement
in that region without the PLO participating, which is the entity
you no doubt were referring to?
   BUSH: You crawl before you walk. And we're not _ there's no
intention on our part to compel Israel or anybody else to deal with
any specific entity. We are trying to be a catalyst for peace in
the area. And it's plagued administrations in the past, it's gone
back over hundreds of years _ differences that exist on these
questions. So find some common ground and try to move the process
forward, and then cross each bridge as you come to it.

<HEAD>Earlier Trip to China by Bush Aide Disclosed</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS graf 7: ``Ron Brown,'' with comment from DNC chairman</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush secretly sent high-level
emissaries to Beijing barely a month after the violent crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators, the White House said Monday in a
disclosure that sparked new criticism that he had ``misled the
American people.''
   The president, meanwhile, urged critics of his China policy to
``be a little patient.''
   Word of the July trip came as Bush was still defending himself
from criticism for having sent aides to Beijing earlier this month.
Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, led
both missions, accompanied by Lawrence Eagleburger, the deputy
secretary of state.
   Scowcroft's first trip, kept secret until now, came a month
after Chinese troops crushed a pro-democracy movement, killing
hundreds of demonstrators.
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., chairman of the Subcommittee on
International Economic Policy and Trade of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, said Bush had ``misled the American people and
the Congress.''
   ``How does the White House square that (earlier trip) with their
statements at the time that high-level contacts with the Chinese
were cut off,'' Gejdenson said.
   Ron Brown, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said,
``There has not been a decision so out of touch with American
values since the sale of arms to the Ayatollah. ... President Bush
has demonstrated yet again that he doesn't see the connection
between human lives, human rights and an effectvie foreign policy.''
   A White House statement Monday said the July trip was intended
to underscore U.S. ``shock and concern about the violence in
Tiananmen Square and to impress upon the Chinese government the
seriousness with which this incident was viewed in the United
States.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said he could not
rule out the possibility that Scowcroft or other U.S. officials had
made other trips to China that still remain secret.
   The White House confirmed the July visit only because it was
reported by the Cable News Network, Fitzwater said. The December
visit was disclosed after Scowcroft and Eagleburger had landed in
Beijing.
   Of the July trip, Fitzwater said, ``The president has had years
of experience with China, and he knows that face-to-face
declarations are important to them.''
   Bush, meanwhile, said that criticism ignited by news of the Dec.
8 trip was subsiding and that remaining skeptics should ``be a
little patient and wait and see'' how Beijing responds.
   ``They've been dealing with emotion and not facts. Once they
deal with a full deck, I expect people will understand it,'' Bush
said.
   He refused to say whether China had offered any concessions in
return for his decision to rekindle relations with Beijing in the
aftermath of the June killings.
   Bush said he does not know when Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi
would be able to leave the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, where he has
taken refuge since the crackdown. Fitzwater said Scowcroft had
denied there were any negotiations going on with China about an
acceptable country where Fang might go.
   The president, who has been accused by Democrats of
``kowtowing'' to the Chinese leaders, said, ``I'm just going to
stay with my position and take on a little heat from time to time.''
   Already, Bush said, ``I notice now that some of the critics who
were so opposed and using this fantastically, diabolically anti-me
language, they come up now saying, `Well, if you get a, b and c,
then it will be all right or then we'll understand. Let them just
stay tuned in.''
   Bush made his comments in a year-end interview with The
Associated Press and three other news agencies.
   On other topics, the president:
   _Said a bill he signed to bail out the savings and loan industry
was ``a major accomplishment but I continue to worry about the
S&amp;Ls.'' He did not elaborate.
   _Said his pledge against raising taxes this year was good for
1990 ``as far as I`m concerned.'' He said he had kept his vow in
1989 ``and I want to continue keeping it.''
   _Scoffed at reports that Colombian drug lords had put up a $30
million assassination contract on his life. ``There is nothing to
it,'' Bush said. ``Let me take this opportunity to reassure the
American people that we will not unduly risk anyone's life here and
that ... I feel confident that the security provisions in Cartagena
will guarantee the safety of the president of the United States.''
Bush plans to attend a meeting of Andean leaders in the Colombian
city in February to discuss the drug fight.
   _Said he felt ``enormous frustration'' that Americans are still
held as hostages in Lebanon. ``It's on my mind an awful lot,'' Bush
said, adding that he had written notes recently to families of the
hostages. The president said the tone of moderation in Iran after
the death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has not been backed up
by action.
   _Said the United States will not compel Israel to deal with the
Palestine Liberation Organization to get peace in the Middle East.
Bush also said he was frustrated by the violence in Lebanon.
   _Declared the United States will play ``an active and
appropriate role'' in encouraging democratic reforms in Eastern
Europe but said those changes will not automatically translate into
huge spending cuts for the Pentagon.
   On another matter, Bush said he felt ``enormous frustration''
that Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega remained in power
despite U.S. sanctions and support for a failed coup attempt in
October.
   The president said the weekend slaying of an American officer in
Panama was ``an enormous outrage and a matter of enormous concern
to this president.''
   Asked if the United States was powerless to act, Bush said, ``I
think a president, all presidents, have options, but they don't
discuss what they might be.'' He repeated that answer when asked if
military steps were being considered.

   Q: Could I ask you about the drug summit?
   BUSH: Yes.
   Q: On domestic trips, it's frequently not announced that you're
going to go some place until about two or three days ahead of time
because of security concerns. But here it is, two months before
this drug summit in Colombia, where there's been a lot of violence,
and the trip has already been announced. Doesn't that sort of
invite some type of attack or assassination attempt by these drug
lords?
   BUSH: I don't think so. And I think that here we're dealing with
an international meeting that's been discussed for a long time.
It's not as if it were just something that's a spur-of-the-moment
meeting. We've talked about an Andean summit for a long, long time.
And the President of Colombia was anxious to go forward with the
announcement and let it be known that we were going to have the
summit. So I think it's different than just kind of a drop-in on
some event here in the United States. I mean, we announced the
summit with the Soviet Union, you know, months ahead of time. We
got _ the G-7 meeting was set a long, long time ago. So I'd say
this is more in keeping with how you handle normal international
conferences.
   Q: _ is reporting that there has been a specific threat against
you. It said about $30 million.
   BUSH: I wish they'd bring the source in so we could take a look
at it. There's nothing to it. I really think that's _ I'd better
read it before I wax indignant.
   Q: Will you feel responsible if anyone _
   BUSH: Tell me what it said.
   Q: It said that some drug lords have said that they are ready to
spend $30 million to have you assassinated.
   BUSH: Were there any quotes which drug lord or anything about it?
   Q: It says that there are rumors in Washington, I think _
   BUSH: That's what I saw, something about rumors. Well, I just
wonder if I was missing something. I've got total confidence in our
security people. I am not going to do anything reckless; you know
me. (Laughter.) And I am going to be as supportive as I can of
President Barco. And we've got outstanding Secret Service people.
And so let me take this opportunity to reassure the American people
that we will not unduly risk anyone's life here, and that I know
that I feel confident that the security provisions in Cartagena
will guarantee the safety of the president of the United States.
   Q: Mr. President, isn't the nature of the meeting, though, doing
it on a military base, as I understand it, for about three hours so
we can get out of town quickly, in itself an implicit admission?
   BUSH: Listen, nobody has to go but me. I'm the only one who's
invited. So where do you get this ``we'' stuff, Tonto? (Laughter.)
   Q: Yes, well, then you're only going to be there for three
hours, and _ isn't that an implicit admission that there is a
serious concern about security there and _
   BUSH: How long were we in St. Martin's? That was an important
meeting.
   Q: We even wondered why that was so short. (Laughter.)

you. What?
   Q: Will you be responsible if anyone is hurt? Not you per se. I
mean, you seem to be guaranteed in your security. But there are a
lot of people who have to travel with you.
   BUSH: What we ought to do is arrange for them to have their
local stringers cover it. Give the local guys a chance.

discussion.
   (DISCUSSION.)
   Q: Noriega says that he's in _ that Panama is in a state of war
with the United States. I know we're not in a state of war with
Panama, obviously, but do you consider the United States in a state
of war with Noriega?
   BUSH: That's technical. But I've taken note of the statement.
   Q: And how do you respond to it?
   BUSH: I respond to it _ go to answered question 3BUSH:
(Laughter.)
   Q: So that means no state of war?
   BUSH: You're asked _ your follow-up to her question.
   Q: There is a state of war? What do you think about it?
   BUSH: I've told you what I think about it.
   MR. FITZWATER: Let's go.
   Q: What do you think you've learned the most in this last year?
Was it that you have a responsibility that is more _ I mean, you
act differently now in decision-making?
   BUSH: I think some of what I learned is what I mentioned to Mike
in that long soliloquy. You've got to get the best information you
can. We've got a good team. Take that information onboard, make a
decision, and then _ you know, if you mess it up, say, look I was
wrong. And if you _ but not worry if you draw a little flak; that
just goes with the territory. But I don't want to be in the
position, and I will never be, as long as I am in this job, of the
hand-wringing position of, oh, this is the loneliest job in the
world, and no one understands. It isn't. It's not lonely. We've got
a lot of good support, and so I think you're right _ kind of
fingering that area is something I've learned. Listen, do your
best. I learned that from my mother.
   But as Russell Baker's mother used to say, pull yourself up by
your bootstraps. My mother said, just do your very best. And as
long as I can give that to the American people and act in a prudent
_ not a reckless, but prudent way, knowledgeable way on events,
don't worry about it if everybody doesn't agree. All those people
are telling you that _ expressing some concern about China, fine.
I've got to do what I think is right, and that's what I think I was
elected to do.
   Q: Sounds Trumanesque.
   BUSH: And we'll see how it plays out. We'll see how it works
out. And I'm very confident. So I end the year with more confidence
than I started it, but I hope not arrogance or overconfidence.
   Q: Thank you.
   BUSH: Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to every little snow
bunny.
   Q _ bed?
   BUSH: Yes, I just can't get rid of this laryngitis. You get a
little tired. I got a little dragged out after that trip down there
because it was so hot at that press conference.
   Q: Was that a problem to communicate with Mr. Mitterrand there?
Any problems communicating with Mr. Mitterrand?
   BUSH: No. It was a very good meeting. Good, strong relationship
where you can discuss differences in private. Don't ask what they
were, Terry. (Laughter.)
   Q: You just planted it.
   Q _ laryngitis the second time this year _
   BUSH: Right after the Inauguration. Remember?
   Q: Remember when you went down to Virginia?
   BUSH: That was more of a flu. That was more of a flu. This, I
don't feel like that.
   Q: You're not going to use a semiautomatic on the quails, are
you? (Laughter.)
   THE PRESS: Thank you.

<HEAD>Prague to Discuss Soviet Troop Withdrawal With Kremlin</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 2 grafs with presidential race developments.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government leaders will begin
talks with the Kremlin this week on withdrawing Soviet troops
stationed in Czechoslovakia since the 1968 invasion that crushed
reforms, officials said Monday.
   Also on Monday, the Communist Party's daily newspaper apologized
on its front page for its past practice of vilifying many of the
people who have emerged as leaders of the reform drive.
   The party leader, Karel Urbanek, was quoted as saying the
Communists probably will try to form a coalition with other parties
before free elections planned next year.
   Premier Marian Calfa and Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier _ a
non-Communist and former dissident _ are scheduled to visit Moscow
on Wednesday at the invitation of Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov.
   The state news agency CTK said Dienstbier would begin
negotiations for the pullout of the estimated 80,000 Soviet troops
stationed in Czechoslovakia. Dienstbier said Thursday their
withdrawal was expected soon but gave no details.
   All the hard-line leaders installed after the 1968 Soviet-led
invasion have been ousted, and the five Warsaw Pact nations that
participated in the invasion have since condemned it.
   The foreign minister has said the agreement allowing the
presence of Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia was invalid because it
was signed under pressure by Alexander Dubcek, leader of the
ill-fated ``Prague Spring'' reforms.
   Dubcek signed the initial document permitting the Soviet
presence after tense negotiations in the Kremlin, where he was
flown after the invasion. A second agreement was signed by Prague
and Moscow in October 1968.
   For two decades afterward, the official Communist daily Rude
Pravo tried to discredit Dubcek and former dissident Vaclav Havel,
now a leading presidential candidate.
   ``Stories like `Stool Pigeon,' `Who is Vaclav Havel,' `Dubcek's
Journey From Tragedy to Farce' and others did not express ... the
(true) attitudes of most of the paper's editors,'' according to the
newspaper's apology Monday.
   In a separate article, Rude Pravo quoted Urbanek as saying a
party congress this week must drawn on the ideas of Dubcek's
reforms and renew itself to survive.
   ``It is more than probable already now that the Communist Party
should go into the (free) elections in a coalition with other
leftist parties which already exist, as well as those to be
established in the future,'' he said.
   The party that dominated Czechoslovakia for 41 years has been
forced into the idea of a coalition by a peaceful revolt that began
Nov. 17, ended the party's guaranteed monopoly on power, and led to
the naming of a federal government dominated by non-Communists.
   Officials have said free elections, which would be the first in
Czechoslovakia in 43 years, could be held in June or July.
   The battle over the vacant presidency is the latest battle
between the communists and the opposition group Civic Forum, which
is pushing for the election of Havel, its leader.
   Hard-line President Gustav Husak resigned Dec. 10 after swearing
in the new government. Under current law, Parliament must elect a
new president within 14 days, but an amendment under consideration
would extend that period to up to 40 days.
   Both sides admitted last week that the deadline might have to be
extended.
   The official CTK news agency said about 10,000 people
demonstrated Monday in Ceske Budejovice in south Bohemia in support
of Havel.
   Havel, a playwright whose works were once banned, said Saturday
he would accept the presidency only temporarily until someone can
be elected for the five-year term by a new freely elected Federal
Assembly.
   Dubcek has also been mentioned as a presidential candidate.
   The Socialist Party, once closely allied with the Communists but
increasingly independent, on Monday announced it backed Havel's
candidacy.
   Cestmir Cisar, who was proposed for the presidency by the
official Socialist Youth Union, said on national TV Monday he was
not interested in being a candidate.

<HEAD>Marchers in Leipzig Hold Vigil for Victims of Stalin</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 8 grafs to include other demonstrations; picks up
7th `Recent Monday'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NESHA STARCEVIC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LEIPZIG, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pro-democracy activists who had
marched noisily each week since early fall set aside bullhorns and
banners Monday night for a silent vigil to honor the victims of
Stalin.
   An estimated 200,000 people took part. Many carried candles
through the darkened winter streets around Karl Marx Platz for 15
minutes after a memorial service for those mistreated during what
now is called ``the intolerance of the past.''
   In September and early October, reformers were beaten and jailed
for taking part in protests.
   ADN, the official news agency, put the crowd at more than
100,000, but an Associated Press reporter in Leipzig estimated the
total at 200,000.
   Demonstrations also were reported in other East German cities.
ADN said about 30,000 people marched through Karl-Marx-Stadt, at
first silently but then with growing chants of ``Germany, United
Fatherland!''
   At Halle, opposition speakers were booed when they spoke against
reunification, the agency said. It did not say how many people
demonstrated.
   Several hundred candle-bearing demonstrators marched silently
through central East Berlin to commemorate victims of Stalinism and
about 3,000 people demonstrated for a clean environment in
Schwerin, it said.
   Leipzig church leaders and protest organizers had asked
demonstrators to be silent this week, and most marchers honored the
call for a solemn memorial.
   Recent Monday night protests aimed at keeping pressure on the
Communist-dominated government for more democratic change escalated
into shouting matches between supporters of saving a sovereign East
Germany and a growing minority seeking reunification with West
Germany.
   Isolated groups of reunification advocates disrupted the silent
march at times with shouts of ``Germany, United Fatherland.'' But
they were quickly hushed by others who whistled their disapproval
or implored them to cease chanting.
   There were no speeches by organizers at the march, another break
with a tradition that has made the Leipzig event a forum for airing
grievances and proposals.
   A few signs on the march route expressed solidarity with
pro-democracy movements in other East European nations, especially
in hard-line Romania.
   ``Freedom also for Romania,'' declared one sign.
   The discipline exhibited by most marchers was likely a result of
leaflets distributed in advance of the event by Leipzig conductor
Kurt Masur, a respected leader of the reform effort.
   ``The whole of Europe hopes along with us that the future
Leipzig Monday demonstrations after Jan. 8 will continue peacefully
as has been the case until now, and that the great idea of a united
Europe can become reality,'' Masur wrote. ``We Germans will in this
way naturally grow together and retain the trust of our neighbors.''
   Activists have decided against holding protests on the next two
Mondays because of the Christmas and New Year's holidays.
   Despite the appeals, about 200 participants tried to stir up the
gathering.
   ``Free elections'' and ``One United Germany'' were among the
political slogans hoisted by those who broke the silence.
   Some people in the crowd said they suspected the ultra-rightist
West German Republicans party had infiltrated the marches to raise
the issue of reunification.
   A young student from Dresden said she had been fearful of a
confrontation, as the demonstration last Monday was ``a little too
aggressive.''
   ``I was really afraid, but I'm very glad that this went off so
peacefully,'' said the woman, who did not give her name.
   Worries about a turn toward violence and a rift in the reform
movement mounted after last week's demonstration reached a fever
pitch, but there were no reports of incidents Monday.
   The rally's exceptional solemnity was not expected to dampen
popular sentiment for reunification.
   ``It would all have been in vain if we don`t become a unified
fatherland again,'' one elderly demonstrator told West Germany`s
ZDF television network.
   ``I am for a unified Germany. I am prepared to wait, but I
cannot wait too long,'' said another, younger participant.
   Leipzig was a hotbed of the democratic movement that forced East
Germany's Communist leaders to open the borders Nov. 9 and
relinquish much of their power.
   Among the reasons for Leipzig's role are a strong church
movement that served as rallying point for democracy activists when
authorities still had tight control over dissent, and the serious
deterioration of the city.

<TEXT>
   Police said Monday they had arrested
a man in the attempted bombing last month of a Saudi Arabian
Airlines jet with 339 people aboard.
   They said the bomb on the Boeing 747 did not explode because a
detonator wire apparently jarred loose. They said it was timed to
go off while the plane was over the Arabian Sea on a flight Nov. 23
from Islamabad to Jidda, Saudi Arabia.
   Officials would not reveal the name or nationality of the
suspect, but said he was a mechanical engineer from an Arab country
who ``is known to be an extremist.''
   ``We do not want to give other details yet, as the investigation
is still under way,'' said Mohammad Habib Khan, director of the
Federal Investigation Agency.
   An agency press release said the suspect admitted guilt after
witnesses identified him. It said he handed a school bag containing
a crude time bomb to a Saudi passenger identified as Abu Amaar, who
was told the bag contained stamps and a book, to be collected by
someone in Jiddah.
   ``Amaar is in custody in Saudi Arabia, but we expect him to be
sent here soon for questioning,'' Khan told The Associated Press.
   Authorities have not explained how the device escaped detection
during normally careful screening of baggage at the Islamabad
airport.
   The Nov. 23 flight was diverted to Karachi, a port city in
southern Pakistan, after security officers at the Islamabad airport
received a note demanding $15 million ransom, officials said.
   A taxi driver delivered the note, which said the Saudi jetliner
would blow up unless the money, in $500 bills, was delivered to a
specified location in Islamabad. Officials said it was not clear
why the ransom was demanded, when the bomb was set to go off
automatically.
   It was discovered after the jumbo jet landed and passengers were
ordered to identify their luggage. Experts said the bomb contained
only eight ounces of dynamite, but could have caused enough damage
to destroy the plane in flight.
   In its press release, the police agency said the suspect became
acquainted with Amaar in the Pakistani city of Peshawar, near the
border with Afghanistan, and they traveled together on a bus from
Peshawar to Islamabad a few days before the flight.
   Police recovered a pistol and ammunition from the suspect, along
with false papers.

<TEXT>
   A judge Monday sentenced 120
rebel soldiers to prison terms ranging from 3 to 10 years for their
role in a failed attempt to topple the government of one of South
Africa's black homelands.
   The group leader, Warrant Officer Timothy Phiri, and 21 other
rebel soldiers were to be sentenced Tuesday.
   The homeland's Supreme Court in Mmabatho convicted all 142
defendants in October of treason or terrorism for their roles in
the February 1988 coup attempt in Bophuthatswana.
   It is one of four tribal homelands that has been declared
independent by South Africa. No foreign government recognizes
Bophuthatswana.
   The coup was quashed by South African commandos, who freed
homeland president Lucas Mangope from captivity at a soccer stadium
and arrested the rebels, all members of the homeland's army.
   The Bophuthatswana News Agency said 92 of those sentenced Monday
received 7-year or 8-year prison terms.

<DATELINE>MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Somalia acknowledged Monday that
northern rebels seized an Italian ship and its crew of 16 more than
a week ago and still held them. The rebels said the ship was
delivering fuel to government troops.
   A source from the rebel Somali National Movement said in
Djibouti the ship and its crew of two Italians and 14 Somalis were
taken without a fight off northern Somalia, carrying fuel from
Djibouti.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Astaldi
Consortium, an Italian contruction company, leased the ship, the
Kwanda, to the Somali government to transport fuel and supplies to
troops battling the rebels.
   In Rome, Astaldi chairman Mario Astaldi confirmed the ship was
seized and the crew held, but said the Kwanda, a converted military
landing craft, was carrying fuel not for Somali troops but for a
consortium of Italian construction companies building roads in
northern Somalia.
   At a Monday briefing for foreign military attaches in Mogadishu,
Somalia's capital, the armed forces confirmed the seizure on or
about Dec. 11 and said the ship was carrying 350 tons of petroleum
products, mostly diesel fuel, according to diplomatic sources.
   They said the craft apparently was captured by rebels in
speedboats armed with machineguns.
   Astaldi said his company was in daily contact with the ship.
   ``Everyone is fine and they are aboard the Kwanda under guard,''
he said.
   Astaldi said the ship was at anchor and the rebels were taking
off the fuel.
   He cautioned news media ``not to prejudice the negotiations
under way to free the crew.''
   The Somali National Movement has fought Somalia's autocratic
government since 1981 and recently stepped up its offensives.
President Mohamed Siad Barre has ruled the Horn of Africa nation
since taking power in a 1969 coup.

<HEAD>Hearing Begins on Manslaughter Charges in Ferry Disaster</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hearing began Monday on whether there is enough
evidence to try P and O European Ferries and seven company
executives and seamen for manslaughter in the Zeebrugge ferry
disaster, which killed 193 people.
   P and O is charged with corporate manslaughter, the first such
prosecution in England, because of the accident in 1987. The ferry
Herald of Free Enterprise was swamped when its rear doors were left
open, and capsized outside the harbor of Zeebrugge, Belgium.
   The hearing is expected to last about three weeks. The decision
to presecute capped more than two years of court and police
proceedings, a public inquiry that blamed the ship owners and an
inquest that returned a verdict of unlawful killing.
   If tried and found guilty, the company could be liable to an
unlimited fine and the individuals could face maximum sentences of
life in prison. No pleas were taken Monday.
   Appearing in court were John Alcindor, deputy chief
superintendent of P and O European Ferries; Wallace Ayres, director
and head of its technical department; Jeffrey Develin, director and
chief (marine) superintendent; Capt. David Lewry, captain of the
ferry; and senior master John Kirby.
   Two other men, first officer Leslie Sabel and assistant bosun
Mark Stanley, decided not to participate in the first phase of the
preliminary hearing, but were to appear when the evidence has been
completed in the cases of the other men.
   Summonses against the company and individual defendants accuse
them of the manslaughter of four victims: passengers Alison
Gaillard and Martin Spooner, and crew members Richard Barnard and
Maria Richards.
   The father of Mrs. Gaillard, who died with her husband Francis,
is Maurice de Rohan, chairman of the Herald Families Association.
Spooner's father, Peter, is the association secretary.

<HEAD>Mohawk Casino Owner Pleads Guilty to Federal Gambling Charges</HEAD>

   The owner of an illegal casino on a Mohawk
Indian reservation pleaded guilty to gambling charges on the first
day of his federal trial Monday, saying he made the plea so he
could appeal.
   ``In order to take this case to the next level, I had to make a
plea, no matter how much I feel I'm innocent,'' Anthony Laughing
said outside the courtroom.
   Laughing, a 42-year-old Mohawk, pleaded guilty to single counts
of possession of slot machines, operating an illegal gambling
business and resisting arrest. Under a plea bargain, prosecutors
dropped six other counts.
   The plea came after a 90-minute conference that followed
Assistant U.S. Attorney John Brunetti's opening argument in the
trial.
   Laughing is to be sentenced Feb. 27. He faces up to 10 years in
prison if given the maximum penalties for each of the three counts.
   He entered conditional pleas to the gambling charges, reserving
the right to appeal the charges on the basis of Indian sovereignty
issues.
   Laughing and 12 other Mohawks who were arrested in a July 20
raid by state and federal law enforcement officers contend the St.
Regis Indian Reservation is a sovereign nation and that state and
federal laws do not apply there.
   Laughing said he wanted to get his case to the next federal
level more quickly rather than endure an extended trial. ``I am
innocent and if I have to appeal this all the way to the Supreme
Court, I will,'' he said.
   His attorney, Michael Vavonese, said an appeal would be filed
with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York City after
sentencing.
   Laughing also said he did not believe he would receive a fair
trial before U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn because McCurn has
ruled repeatedly in the government's favor.
   McCurn earlier this year rejected the sovereignty argument in
pretrial motions, citing other Indian cases where courts have ruled
that federal and state governments have jurisdiction on Indian
reservations.
   McCurn allowed Laughing to remain free on $300,000 bail, but
continued a U.S. magistrate's order that he report to authorities
twice daily and be at home overnight to receive a call from them.
   Laughing owns Tony's Vegas International, the largest of seven
high-stakes casinos on the reservation, which straddles the
U.S.-Canadian border in northern New York.
   He avoided arrest in the July 20 raid, and was a fugitive for
two months until being caught Sept. 21 after a chase by state
troopers.
   Laughing's case is the fifth to be resolved. Three other Mohawks
have either been convicted or pleaded guilty to gambling charges. A
fifth Mohawk was acquitted when prosecutors failed to prove he was
the owner of a truck stop where state police seized slot machines.

   The State Department renewed its criticism on
Monday of Cuban arms shipments to Central America and said ``it is
time for Cuba to stop acting like a renegade nation.''
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Cuba should stop
sending weapons to Nicaragua's leftist government and Nicaragua
should stop sending such arms on to Salvadoran rebels.
   She said that Cuba must begin shouldering more responsibility
than before because it will soon become a member of the U.N.
Security Council.
   ``It needs now to begin acting in a way consistent with the
great responsibility it will bear in the council,'' she said.
   Her statement suggested a shift in emphasis about the U.S. view
of who is to blame for the continuing upheaval in Central America.
   The administration previously had said the Soviet Union had a
duty to persuade Cuba and Nicaragua to block the transfer of Soviet
bloc weapons to the Salvadoran insurgency.
   In her remarks on Monday, Ms. Tutwiler seemed to play down
Soviet responsibility for the continuing violence in Central
America. But, under questioning, she said that the administration
has not backed away from its previous view and that Central America
continues to be a divisive issue for Moscow and Washington.
   The administration does not challenge Moscow's contention that
it has ceased direct arms deliveries to Central America. But
officials say they are convinced that some Soviet weapons arrive in
Central America via third countries, especially Cuba.
   Monday evening, in response to a press question, the State
Department said that Cuba continues to be one of six countries on a
U.S. government list of countries that support international
terrorism.
   ``Cuba continues to provide safe haven, weapons and political
and financial support to a wide range of leftist and insurgent
organizations that use terrorism,'' the department said.
   It said Cuba supports a Colombian leftist group that has
attacked western economic interests.
   In addition, it said that the Salvadoran rebel group backed by
Cuba has publicly threatened Americans assisting the Salvadoran
government as ``legitimate targets of assassination.''
   Also, Cuba has supported a leftist group in Chile believed
responsible for several international terrorist incidents in recent
years, the department said.
   Joining Cuba on the State Department terrorism list are Iran,
Syria, Libya, South Yemen and North Korea.
   Cuba, in turn, regards the United States as the country most
prone to international adventurism worldwide. It has cited repeated
U.S.-sponsored assassination attempts against President Fidel
Castro and large-scale American military involvement in Central
America.
   Castro recently accused the United States of directly
intervening in the internal affairs of the Philippines by lending
air support to President Corazon Aquino during the recent coup
attempt.
   Beyond that, Castro said that the worldwide U.S. network of
military bases gives the United States the capability to intervene
in virtually any region on short notice.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze signed a far-reaching trade agreement with the
European Community on Monday, a major step toward getting needed
Western help for his nation's ailing economy.
   On Tuesday, Shevardnadze will pay an unprecedented visit to the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the center of the Western
military alliance.
   He called the 10-year accord _ the first between Moscow and the
12-nation trading bloc _ ``truly innovative.''
   ``Its nature reflects the dynamism of the process of renewal in
Europe,'' he said.
   He later had what was described as a relaxed dinner with the 12
EC foreign ministers. ``He was like a colleague we have known for
many years,'' said Belgium's foreign minister, Mark Eyskens.
   Hans van den Broek, the Dutch minister, said Shevardnadze
discussed the upheaval in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union's own
economic reform program, among other issues.
   ``His message was: `We do not deny the (economic) situation is
difficult, but grant us more time,''' Van den Broek said.
   On Eastern Europe, ``he was so far as to say that had the
reforms occurred a few years ago, it could have happened with fewer
shocks,'' he added.
   Van den Broek said Shevardnadze lauded Western leaders for
insisting that change must come in Europe but not at the expense of
stability. West German sources said the same point was made at a
separate meeting Shevardnadze had with Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany.
   The Soviet minister said the trade and economic cooperation
agreement he signed at a ceremony at EC headquarters would help
overcome the division of the European continent.
   He said it ``gives food for collective thinking'' about creating
an ``economic complex on our Continent.''
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, whose country holds the
community's rotating presidency, hailed the arrangement as
``facilitating the integration of the Soviet Union into the world
economy.''
   Frans Andriessen, the community's top-ranking trade official,
cautioned that the pact's success depended on Soviet efforts to
achieve a more market-oriented economy.
   The agreement will gradually get rid of most import quotas on
agricultural and industrial products from the Soviet Union and set
out closer cooperation in areas including nuclear energy and
safety, financial services, environmental protection and management
training.
   In return, the Kremlin has promised to give Western European
businesses greater access to its potentially enormous consumer
market.
   ``Now the agreement is to be put into practice,'' Shevardnadze
said. ``We are ready for it and we intend to continue to work in
earnest, keeping up the high tempo and the spirit of creative
cooperation.''
   He said he did not request the meeting with NATO
Secretary-General Manfred Woerner, but ``simply raised the
question'' of whether there would be a chance to visit the alliance.
   ``We have to take the first step even if the fleets are facing
each other,'' he said.
   He said he had ``no particular hidden thoughts visiting NATO.''
   Questioned about whether the Kremlin intended to join the
Western alliance, he joked he would take a look Tuesday and
``decide whether it's worth joining up now.''
   He made a pitch for dismantling the Western group of 17 nations
formed to keep sensitive technology out of the hands of the East
bloc nations. But he said easing its restrictions was up to the
United States, the key partner in the Western drive.
   The accord is the fourth the community has negotiated with
Eastern European countries since it established in June 1988 formal
ties with the socialist economic bloc, the Council for Mutual
Economic Assistance.
   The community has trade and economic cooperation accords with
Poland and Hungary and a smaller one with Czechoslovakia. It is
discussing pacts with Bulgaria and East Germany.
   The Soviet Union imported about $11 billion in goods from the
community in 1987, while the trading bloc bought nearly $16 billion
from Moscow. Total trade between the community and Eastern Europe
amounted to about $56 billion in 1987.

   Redoubt Volcano continued to fire
clouds of steam and gritty volcanic ash high into the sky Monday,
forcing airlines to ground flights or route them around the
abrasive powder for fear of engine damage.
   Also grounded were 240 Korean Air Lines passengers who have
refused since Saturday to reboard their flight since it made its
scheduled stop here..
   Ash clouds rose to 31,000 feet from Redoubt's 10,197-foot summit
Monday.
   ``The volcano is still very active,'' said Steve Brantley, a
geologist with the Alaska Volcano Observatory. ``We are continuing
to observe a high level of earthquake activity on the mountain, and
we received a number of reports of confirmed ash plumes rising
above the volcano this morning.''
   Anchorage International Airport was open Monday, but service was
irregular, with some airlines grounding aircraft and others
offering limited service. Some domestic airlines canceled flights
and international carriers routed their aircraft around Anchorage.
   Projections showed that the ash, carried by high-altitude wind,
could reach the Kenai Peninsula, and perhaps the outskirts of
Anchorage, sometime late Monday.
   While some tried to get on planes, a group of Korean Air Line
passengers refused to reboard their flight Monday, saying they were
concerned whether it was safe to fly.
   ``We are debating that right now,'' said Christine Lee, 23, a
spokeswoman for the balky passengers. ``There are 240 of us total,
and the factions to leave and stay are about the same. If some go,
we all have to go.''
   KAL Flight 25 was en route from New York to Seoul on Saturday
when it landed in Anchorage.
   Lee, a Korean national with a home in the United State, said the
plane arrived late, then was delayed and passengers were taken to
hotels. ``Then all these rumors started about the safety of the
plane; the volcanic ash,'' she said. ``It's hard to tell what's
really true.''
   Elected passenger representatives met Monday with KAL officials,
Lee said. KAL representative Lee Steiner in Los Angeles said he
unsure what the problem was, and airline officials in Anchorage had
no comment.
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Paul Steucke said his
agency was not involved because Flight 25 was an international
flight. International airline companies are responsible for the
safety of their planes, he said.
   The volcanic ash's threat to aircraft, especially jets, also
hampered holiday mail delivery.
   About 22,000 pounds of mail was stacked in Anchorage on Monday
for shipment out of Alaska. An additional 130,000 pounds waited in
Seattle for shipment to Alaska, said spokeswoman Nancy Schmitt.
   ``It's playing havoc with us,'' she said. ``This is the largest
backup we've ever had.''
   The postal service depends on commercial jets to move the mail,
but has resorted to chartering propeller-driven aircraft, she said.
``The mail's moving, but slowly,'' she said.
   The Alaska Railroad added a train Monday between Anchorage and
Fairbanks for travelers trying to reach that interior city, said
spokeswoman Vivian Hamilton.
   Redoubt began erupting Thursday after two decades of silence and
has sent ash and steam skyward intermittently since. It is in a
sparsely populated area 115 miles southwest of Anchorage in the
Lake Clark National Park and Preserve.
   No injuries have been reported but one family was removed Sunday
from a lodge in the shadow of the volcano although they were in no
immediate danger.
   Another couple remains at a lodge north of the peak. Workers
were removed from an oil storage depot along a river which has
flooded in the past when Redoubt's eruptions melted snow.

   Two U.S. Air Force fighter jets
collided Monday during a training flight, and one of the F-16s
crashed near a vegetable market in Ludwigshafen, officials said.
Police said one pilot was killed.
   There were no injuries reported on the ground after the crash of
the two F-16s, the first about 60 miles southwest of Frankfurt and
the second outside Bobenheim-Roxheim. Hesse state radio said 12
people were in the market at the time of the 4:20 p.m. crash.
   Spokesman Doug Moore said from the U.S. Air Force headquarters
in Ramstein that one pilot was taken to a U.S. Army hospital and
that his condition was not known.
   Moore said the fate of the pilot of the second aircraft had not
been determined. However, local police said in a statement that the
second pilot was killed.
   No names were released. The pilots were the only crewmembers in
the planes.
   ``Initial reports are that there were no injuries or casualties
on the ground,'' Moore said.

<TEXT>
   Two young tourists, an Australian man and a
New Zealand woman, were found murdered in a rebel-infested region
of the southern highlands with a note saying, ``This is how
capitalists die,'' officials said Monday.
   The two had been backpacking through Latin America.
   Julie Gold, spokeswoman for the Australian Embassy in Brasilia,
Brazil, told The Associated Press military troops found the bodies
on Dec. 7 near Puquio, 360 miles southeast of Lima, in an area of
the Andes where Maoist Shining Path guerrillas are active.
   Military officials said the victims were killed about Nov. 22,
she said. It was not known if the two were going by bus through the
area or hitchhiking.
   A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Lima, who demanded
anonymity, said it had not been determined whether guerrillas or
common criminals killed them and the matter was under investigation.
   Ms. Gold identified the man as Paul David Linsdell, 25, of
Melbourne. The New Zealand Embassy in Lima identified the woman as
Vivienne Joy Barbour, 26, of Hamilton. Australia does not have an
embassy in Peru.
   Ms. Gold said Linsdell had been strangled and that the note was
found near the bodies. The note indicated the two were killed by
the Shining Path, which often leaves similar notes next to their
victims.
   Neil Johnson of the New Zealand Embassy said the bodies were
found on the road between Puquio and Abancay, the same road where a
German couple was taken from a bus and murdered by Shining Path
rebels in May.
   Ms. Gold said Linsdell and Ms. Barbour had traveled together
since June, and had gone to Mexico, Brazil and Bolivia before
coming here. She said they had planned to fly from Lima to London
this month.
   Ms. Gold said their remains would be returned home.
   The government has declared the area around Puquio and Abancay
an emergency zone and put it under military control to fight
leftist insurgents.
   The U.S. Embassy and other foreign embassies have issued
advisories urging tourists not to travel to the emergency zones,
which cover a third of the country and affect more than half of
Peru's 21 million people.
   At least 20 foreigners, including tourists, aid workers and one
journalist, have been killed in terrorist violence since the
Shining Path launched its insurgency in 1980. Eight foreigners died
in June 1986 when rebels bombed the tourist train to Machu Picchu,
the ancient citadel of the Incas near Cuzco.
   The government says more than 17,000 people have died in the
violence the past nine years.

   A Canadian delivery of sleet and ice sledded into the deep South
on Monday in a winter preview that cracked century-old temperature
records across the Midwest and clogged the Missouri River with a
75-mile ice jam.
   The bitter weather closed schools from Mississippi to Michigan,
and forecasters said no change was in sight. The cold is being
caused by a horseshoe-shaped flow of air that follows the West
Coast up to Alaska, chills out and plunges down through Canada into
the East and Midwest.
   ``It's simply a pipeline that carries ... the cold air
southward,'' said Ed Ferguson, deputy director of the federal
government's Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City. ``And by
southward, I mean all the way to the Gulf of Mexico.''
   Southerners from central Mississippi to the Carolinas awoke
Monday to a Yankee's vista of freezing rain and sleet that made
driving hazardous and was blamed for at least one traffic death.
Hundreds of schools were closed.
   The National Weather Service said as much as an inch of sleet
and freezing rain covered north and central Georgia before dawn,
and freezing rain extended as far south as Savannah.
   Ice on Interstate 85 near Atlanta apparently contributed to a
crash that killed Atlanta Falcons tight end Brad Beckman,
authorities said.
   At least 19 deaths around the nation were blamed on the cold
during the weekend, including the deaths of two young Tulsa, Okla.,
girls who apparently were playing with a makeshift sled Sunday when
they plunged through thin ice on a lake. Two homeless people died
of hypothermia while sleeping in New York City subway stations.
   One weekend hypothermia death in Chicago brought to 10 the
number of people who have died from exposure in the municipal area
so far this winter, said a spokeswoman for the Cook County Medical
Examiner's office.
   A school bus carrying 43 children crashed into a station wagon
on a slippery highway Monday near Shapleighl, Maine, but none of
the children were seriously hurt, officials said.
   Monday's cold broke Dec. 18 records that had held for more than
a century in Columbus, Ohio, where it was minus 7; in Pittsburgh,
where it also was 7 below, and in Detroit, where it was minus 3.
   Other records included Parkersburg, W.Va., at 4 above,
Cincinnati at 3 below, Fort Wayne, Ind., and Cleveland at minus 5,
and Youngstown, Ohio, at minus 8.
   ``Good night, it's been unreal,'' said Pam Decker, co-owner of
Decker's Wrecker Service in Boonville, Ind., which was besieged
with calls about stalled and wrecked cars and the need to
jump-start dead or dying car batteries.
   The Missouri River turned to ice for about a 75-mile stretch
between Blair, Neb., just north of Omaha, and Sioux City, Iowa,
according to the National Weather Service.
   The ice jam had begun late Friday and grew over the weekend.
Officials feared that the ice floe could cause problems for
communities that pump their water from the river, and Weather
Service hydrologist Roy Osugi didn't hold out hope for an early
thaw.
   ``Nothing is going to bust it up except warmer weather,'' Osugi
said. ``We think it's going to stay in place at least this week
because it's going to stay very cold.''
   In St. Joseph, Mo., officials activated a new emergency pump as
a precautionary measure to keep water flowing to the city.
   There were similar problems in the town of Monroe, Mich., where
55,000 water customers were asked to conserve while workers Monday
cleared a frozen intake valve that also was clogged with Lake Erie
zebra mussels, a non-native species which has no natural predators
and is proliferating in the lake.
   In Crooksville, Ohio, officials declared a water emergency after
a series of water main breaks over the weekend. Parts of the small
town had been without service for three days.
   The cold also was the likely cause of a break in a 4-inch pipe
that let water surge through all 12 floors of a new hospital at
Ohio State University in Columbus, causing at least $1 million
damage and delaying its scheduled Jan. 16 opening, said OSU vice
president Richard Jackson.
   Farther west, the arctic weather system carried welcome snow to
Rocky Mountain ski resorts and wind chills of 35 below zero to
parts of Wyoming. It was 26 below at Jordan, Mont., and high
temperatures in some parts of Montana were expected to be below
zero.
   In Colorado, snowfall in the 24 hours that ended Monday morning
included 4 inches at Denver, 16 inches at Vail and 9\ inches at
Steamboat Springs _ which has gotten 99 inches in nine days, said
spokeswoman Barb Jennings.
   At Denver's Stapleton International Airport, spokesman Norm
Avery said crews were out before daybreak, clearing 10 runways.
However, he said flights were delayed up to an hour because of the
snow.
   Ferguson, of the Severe Storms Forecast Center, said the outlook
for most of the country is for below-average temperatures for the
next month or so.
   ``There's no promise that we can see in any of our projections
that we're going to have balmy weather in the middle of winter,''
he said.

   Vote counts and projections Monday
indicated free-market advocate Fernando Collor de Mello, a
conservative, had defeated his socialist opponent in Brazil's first
direct presidential election in 29 years.
   In this capital city, Collor de Mello supporters celebrated in
the streets, beating drums and waving party flags. The dapper
candidate appeared briefly for photographers outside his Brasilia
mansion, smiling and making a ``V'' for victory sign but offering
no comment.
   However, officials of leftist Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's party
said it was too early for their candidate to concede defeat.
   ``We won't give up until the last vote is counted,'' said
Workers Party President Luiz Gushinken. ``The important thing are
the Court's official figures.''
   The Supreme Electoral Court said leftist Luis Inacio Lula da
Silva was leading Collor de Mello by less than 1 percent in a tally
based on 60 percent of the votes. The official tally was slow
because state returns were being double-checked to avoid error.
   But Irineu Tamanini, spokesman for the Electoral Court, said
Collor de Mello would overtake da Silva by late Monday as returns
came in from the candidate's strongholds in remote central and
northern regions, where ballot boxes were taken to vote-counting
centers by canoe and mule.
   The final result will be announced by Wednesday, Tamanini said.
   The winner is to succeed President Jose Sarney on March 15 and
serve five years, but pressure is growing for Sarney to resign
earlier. Two Cabinet members said Sunday said the president-elect
should take office soon because of severe economic problems.
   In a first round of voting Nov. 15, Collor de Mello and da Silva
got the most votes of 21 candidates, but neither won a majority.
   Collor de Mello, 40, formed the National Reconstruction Party
less than a year ago. He is a proponent of free markets, cleaning
up corruption in government and paying the $110 billion foreign
debt _ largest in the developing world _ but on less burdensome
terms.
   The business, military and media establishments united behind
Collor de Mello, who comes from a wealthy family with a long
political tradition.
   Da Silva, 44, urged sweeping land reform, redistribution of
income and immediate suspension of payments on the foreign debt.
   Near the northeastern city of Santa Barbara, five cars carrying
people back from voting dropped into a 30-foot-deep crater left in
a road by heavy rains, said civil defense official Gloria Pires da
Silva. She said 15 people were killed in Sunday's accident.
   Globo TV, the nation's largest television network, projected
Collor de Mello as the winner and had him ahead by 3 million votes,
or 5.1 percent, in an unofficial tally based on 86.8 percent of
returns.
   Network owner Roberto Marinho supported Collor de Mello, but
Globo TV said all its results were compiled from returns announced
by state election officials.
   Four private polling institutes said Monday afternoon Collor de
Mello would be the winner by 3.5 to 4.5 million votes, a 4 to 6
percent margin.
   ``There is no doubt that Collor de Mello is the next president
of Brazil,'' said Carlos Matheus, director of the Gallup polling
institute.
   Da Silva _ known as Lula, the nickname he has made part of his
legal name _ led early in the official count on the basis of
returns from two strongholds, the southern cities of Porto Alegre
and Rio de Janeiro.
   Collor de Mello rebounded with a strong showing in Sao Paulo,
Brazil's wealthiest and most populous state, and in the
southeastern industrial and farming state of Minas Gerais.
   Roberto Rosas of the Electoral Court said the Electoral Court
was investigating charges by the Workers Party, da Silva's
organization, that voters could not get to polling stations in
Bahia and Ceara states, both da Silva country, because private bus
companies took their vehicles off the street.
   ``If the difference between the candidates is slight, the Court
will set a third election date for municipalities that had trouble
voting,'' Rosas told The Associated Press.
   News of Collor de Mello's lead stabilized financial markets
Monday and caused a sharp decline of the dollar's value on the
illegal, but tolerated, black market. The price of a dollar was 17
new cruzados Monday, down from 22 at the close of business Friday.
   Brazil was ruled by the military in 1964-85 and Sunday's
election was hailed as a significant step toward full restoration
of democracy.
   On the minds of the 82 million registered voters in this nation
of 150 million people were annual inflation of 1,500 percent,
declining real wages, official corruption and the largest foreign
debt in the Third World.
   The last Brazilian president chosen directly by the people was
Janio Quadros. He resigned in 1961, after seven months in office,
and the military overthrew his vice president and successor, Joao
Goulart, in 1964.
   Sarney was chosen by an electoral college in 1985.

<HEAD>Scotland Yard In International Hunt for Computer Saboteur</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scotland Yard has launched an international hunt
for the high-tech saboteur who sent at least 10,000 tampered disks
to individuals and institutions worldwide, officials said Monday.
   Computer users as far away as Australia and South Africa have
received the altered disks, which were packaged as an ``AIDS
Information Introductory Diskette,'' Scotland Yard said. Disks have
also been received in Britain, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the
United States, officials and news reports say.
   Thousands of callers from British government departments, health
authorities, accountancy firms, lawyers, newspapers, magazines and
commercial institutions have telephoned Scotland Yard about the
suspect disks.
   ``We can't give a number of damaged systems. All we can say is
quite a number of recipients have actually put the disks into their
machines and therefore the machines have been damaged,'' said a
police spokeswoman on condition of anonymity.
   Scotland Yard said it now believes more than one mailing list
may have been purchased by the saboteur. A middle-aged man calling
himself Mr. E. Katema bought a mailing list from PC Business World,
a computer magazine, it said.
   Police said a letter with the disks asks for a ``license fee''
of either $189 or $378, depending on the type of license, to be
sent a Panamanian postal box.
   The letter warns that if the disk is used but no payment made,
the sender will employ programming in the disk to block normal
operation of the host computer.
   Police sources said some damage is caused as soon as the disk is
installed, but full damage is only recognized much later. They say
the disk has a counter that masks the damage until the host
computer has been switched on about 90 times.
   The disk purportedly offers information on the risk of getting
the fatal disease AIDS, or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.
   Experts say the disk programming does not automatically spread
to other computers, as some computer viruses have in the past.
   The alarm was first raised earlier this month by Alan Solomon,
chairman of the IBM Personal Computer User Group. He said he had
received one of the disks.
   ``It has also been established that the post office box number
in Panama does exist and inquiries are continuing with assistance
of authorities in Panama,'' Scotland Yard said.
   Detectives have determined that most of the disks were mailed
from London, the Scotland Yard statement said.
   Scotland Yard had said it was treating the case as criminal
damage and blackmail.

<HEAD>New Currency Proposed as Yugoslavia Weighs Economic Overhaul</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUSAN STOJANOVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Ante Markovic proposed
introduction of a new convertible currency unit in Yugoslavia on
Monday at a key parliamentary session that is to consider sweeping
economic and political reforms.
   Markovic also announced tight monetary and budgetary controls;
free formation of interest rates, which in the past were set by the
National Bank; and government control of prices on electricity,
gasoline, rail transport, rents, postal services and medicines.
   He asked for an overhaul of the criminal code, including
dropping so-called ``verbal offenses'' under which thousands of
people were prosecuted for privately or publicly criticizing the
Communist regime.
   The new program is designed to lead the nation out of its worst
economic and political crisis and to curb rampant inflation.
Parliament must approve it during a three-day session or the
government says it will resign.
   Markovic said a solution to Yugoslavia's crisis ``is not
possible without a completely new economic and political system
that would ensure economic efficiency and political democracy with
full freedoms and human rights.''
   He said Yugoslavia should ``adopt all norms of a democratic and
pluralistic society,'' adding that Yugoslavia must not be satisfied
only by market-oriented reforms but should introduce radical
political changes as well.
   Winding up his 90-minute address, he pleaded for undivided
support from the deputies for the reforms ``crucial for the fate of
this country.''
   Markovic said Yugoslavia successfully ended negotiations with
the International Monetary Fund on obtaining new loans. Yugoslavia
is seeking loans from the IMF and the World Bank to implement its
new reform package.
   Under his proposal for a new currency unit, one new
``convertible dinar'' would be worth 10,000 old dinars. He said
Yugoslavs would be able to freely purchase foreign currencies with
dinars in local banks.
   The exchange rate would be fixed at seven dinars for one West
German mark and stay fixed until June 30. Before, the dinar rate
was adjusted daily against foreign currencies and lost value
rapidly as inflation hit 2,000 percent.
   One U.S. dollar would be worth 12 new dinars, instead of the
120,000 dinars now, Markovic said.
   He said the dinar was pegged to the mark because of the mark's
``greatest stability'' on world money markets, and will vary in
comparison to other Western currencies according to fluctuations in
the value of the mark.
   He said the changeover will take place Jan. 1, 1990, if
Parliament approves the package. Yugoslavia's last re-evaluation of
the dinar occurred in 1965.
   The central bank would for the first time become fully
autonomous in conducting monetary policies in accordance with
market mechanisms and will no longer be allowed to print money to
cover state deficits, Markovic said.
   Markovic's government took over last March. It has moved quickly
to introduce market mechanisms as a way out of a crisis that
includes a $17 billion foreign debt and a 17 percent unemployment
rate.
   His reform program has been bitterly attacked by conservatives
in the communist leadership, particularly in the republics of
Serbia and Montenegro, where local leaders oppose his efforts to
restructure the economy and promote greater political pluralism.
   Authorities in the two republics fear the popular discontent
that could be ignited by Markovic's reforms, which include firing
hundreds of thousands of employees in loss-making firms. They
prefer short-term measures such as price freezes.
   On Monday, the state-run trade union of the underdeveloped
republic of Montenegro organized a half-hour general ``warning''
strike by 160,000 workers to pressure the government to adopt
urgent measures to contain hyperinflation.
   Similar short general strikes are expected in the economically
poorest region of Macedonia on Thursday and in Serbia on Wednesday,
the day deputies are expected to vote on Markovic's program.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Monday announced
it is lifting controls on foreign exchange and most prices it has
unsuccessfully tried to set for years.
   The move came as President Carlos Menem struggles to carry out a
tricky program of privatization of state-run businesses,
deregulation and reduced government spending to remedy decade-long
inflation and related economic problems.
   When banks reopen after a government-ordered banking holiday
that began Friday, the value of the austral, the beleaguered
national currency, will be determined by market forces, new Economy
Minister Antonio Erman Gonzalez said.
   Most prices will also be set in the marketplace.
   However, the holiday will continue at least through Tuesday,
said the spokesman for the Economy Ministry, Miguel Alurralde.
   Erman Gonzalez announced the new measures Monday in a 10-minute
speech that followed his swearing-in to replace Nestor Rapanelli.
Rapanelli resigned Friday after a plunge in the value of the
austral on the black market.
   The importance of the measures was underlined by the fact that
the speech was broadcast nationwide from Government House. In
attendance were the president, vice president, Cabinet ministers,
business and union leaders, and top brass of the armed forces.
   In his own short speech, Menem insisted his economic program
would continue. He said it is the only hope for remedying the
country's economic problems.
   ``On this flight, we are all on board, absolutely everyone, and
this plane has no parachutes,'' Menem said. ``Anyone who wants to
jump may jump, knowing the consequences.''
   Erman Gonzalez, the third economy minister in Menem's
5-month-old government, takes over amid economic distress that
threatens to become a political crisis for Menem.
   The president risks losing public support he needs in the short
run until his reforms produce long-term benefits. A wide segment of
organized labor, a powerful force in Argentina, and business have
attacked his plans.
   Even Menem's own labor-based Peronist Party has shown only
lukewarm support for the reforms.
   Inflation that moderated to 6.5 percent in November from 197
percent in July is projected to top 30 percent in December.
   One of the causes of economic deterioration the past week was
massive buying of dollars. Analysts said the buying was triggered
by the government's unexpected decision to suspend repayment of
principal on internal bonds for two years and raise taxes on
exports.
   Erman Gonzalez instead annulled the unpopular tax hikes and said
the government would try to repay the principal on time.
   While price controls for food and many consumer and industrial
products will be lifted, Erman Gonzalez said the government will
continue to regulate rates for gas, electricity, water, telephones,
bus and commuter train fares, and other public services.
   To help Argentines pay for the rates, Erman Gonzalez authorized
a monthly pay increase for public and private workers of about $20.
   Lifting controls on the austral means exporters may convert
their dollars at the Central Bank at a much higher rate. The move
is intended to induce them to turn in dollars it has been hoarding
from overseas sales of beef and grain.
   The Central Bank has previously been regulating the exchange
market.

   The U.S. Marshals Service began screening
packages entering U.S. courthouses Monday, mindful of the mailed
bomb that killed an appellate judge in Alabama and a suspected bomb
found at an Atlanta courthouse.
   ``We're being more vigilant,'' said Flavio Lorenzoni, Chief
Deputy U.S. Marshal for the Southern District of New York. ``All
packages are being checked carefully.''
   He spoke before it was learned that another mailed bomb had
killed a lawyer in Savannah, Ga.
   Like his colleagues in other judicial districts, Lorenzoni
declined to elaborate about the security procedures that have been
invoked since the assassination of Circuit Judge Robert S. Vance.
   ``If we tell everyone what we're doing, it won't have any
effect,'' he said.
   William Dempsey, a spokesman for the Marshals Service in
Washington, said judges have been told ``to bring all packages to
the attention of the marshals so they can be screened and X-rayed
before opening.''
   All packages should be screened, even those bearing a familiar
return address because ``a return address can be faked or forged,''
he said.
   Although he said that security for judges is being stepped up
around the country, Dempsey acknowledged that it would be
impossible for the Marshals Service to provide round-the-clock
protection for every federal judge and magistrate.
   Such protection is given judges when a specific threat is
detected, usually arising from a case involving a judge.
   ``There is not a day in a year that goes by that we do not have
round-the-clock details on some judges,'' Dempsey said.
   Dempsey confirmed that extra security had given to judges in the
11th Circuit, which covers Florida, Georgia, and Alabama, following
Saturday's blast that killed Vance at his home outside Birmingham.
   In Miami, Daniel J. Horgan, U.S. Marshal for the Southern
District of Florida, called a meeting Monday of the district's
judges to inform them of the apparent bomb found in Atlanta on
Monday and the new security measures.
   Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal James Tassone said all packages and
mail entering the federal courthouses in Miami, West Palm Beach and
Fort Lauderdale were being inspected by X-ray.
   People entering the courthouses also were subjected to extra
examination. For instance, some courthouse employees who usually
pass through security with a cursory check were asked Monday to
empty their pockets as they entered.
   Not all federal courthouses changed procedures. For instance, in
Indiana, officials said security was already tight and did not need
to be improved.
   However, Deputy Marshal Jeff Whitney in Evansville, Ind., said
judges had been instructed not to open any uninspected packages
   In New York, U.S. District Judge Mark A. Costantino said federal
marshals called him at home several hours after Judge Vance was
killed and advised him to be alert for suspicious packages.
   The judge said he and his family would refuse to accept any
parcel not bearing the return address of someone they know.
   ``We may be making a mountain out of a molehill, but that shows
that someone is making an effort to create fear in the judicial
system,'' he said.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
President Bush had been in contact with Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh to ask about the status of the investigation.
   ``The attorney general advised him we have not reached any
conclusions about the source of his death. We just don't have any
answers yet as to who might have done it to him,'' Fitzwater said.
   Extra security precautions have been taken at the Justice
Department in recent months since President Virgilio Barcos of
Colombia declared war that nation's cocaine cartels.
   The Justice Department purchased an armor-plated limousine for
Thornburgh, which the attorney general uses around Washington. The
FBI agents who guard Thornburgh now carry high-powered assault
weapons in leather cases.

   A retired union leader said Monday that
state police officials used tape recordings of telephone
conversations at state police barracks to gather evidence against
union members.
   ``Every (grievance) hearing I ever went to, I think they had a
transcript of some call. They did that all the time,'' said the
retired union leader, who spoke on condition he not be quoted by
name and is also a former state trooper.
   However, the former union leader said he sometimes used the
tapes to gather information when he was putting together a case for
a grievance.
   The revelations were the latest in the secret taping scandal
since Nov. 7, when The Hartford Courant reported that state police
routinely recorded all calls into and out of state police barracks,
including those between suspects and their attorneys.
   Gov. William A. O'Neill's counsel, Howard G. Rifkin, said Monday
there had been no evidence any calls were monitored to gather
union-related evidence on anyone.
   He and Tom Gariepy, spokesman for Attorney General Clarine Nardi
Riddle, said they had found that some calls were monitored to make
sure phones weren't being abused.
   ``We didn't find anything to show that there was an intentional
effort to ... use tapes against a trooper,'' Rifkin said.
   State police Commander Bernard R. Sullivan said through a
spokesman he would have no comment on the newest allegations.
   The taping issue prompted a hearing Monday before a
congressional subcommittee in Washington. The panel was told that
state or local police or corrections officers in at least 12 other
states routinely record lawyer-client conversations.
   Federal laws prohibit taping telephone calls without the consent
of one of the two people using the telephone. State and federal
laws prohibit the recording of any lawyer-client conversations.
   The taping disclosures have prompted an FBI and federal grand
jury probe and at least five civil lawsuits have been filed.
   State police officials have said the tapes were only used for
authorized purposes, and were seldom listened to. They have
insisted that calls were taped to provide a record of emergency
calls.
   The officials have said only a few authorized members of the
department had access to the tapes. But union sources speaking on
condition of anonymity said the tapes were sometimes not guarded
and that many department members had access to them.
   Disclosure of the taping led to the removal of Lester J. Forst
as state police commander and public safety commissioner by
O'Neill, who ordered an immediate halt to taping of attorney-client
calls. The governor ordered an investigation by state officials
into the practice that determined that the taping was inexcusable,
but was not used to illegally gather evidence against suspects.
   The former union leader said he recalled one instance where an
argument between a sergeant and a trooper could be heard in the
background on the tape of a call between another trooper and
someone else. The argument was transcribed and used as evidence of
insubordination, he said.
   He said he sometimes called department officials and got them to
say incriminating things on a taped phone line to be used when he
was putting together a grievance case against the department.
   He said he would go into a barracks after midnight and
transcribe portions of the tape he wanted.
   The Courant on Monday described a 1979 incident of monitoring
tapes when troopers at the Bethany barracks decided to protest
manpower shortages through a sickout, in which troopers falsely
claim to be sick and refuse to go to work.
   A copy of an internal investigation report on the sickout
obtained by The Courant shows that state police officials listened
to hours of the tapes and transcribed and summarized parts of them.
The transcripts were then used as evidence in disciplinary actions
against a sergeant and several troopers.
   Other monitored conversations include a trooper talking about a
grievance he filed, and troopers talking to friends outside the
department.
   Robert J. Krzys, a union lawyer, said the union is trying to
determine whether similar monitoring of tape recordings has been
going on during the past three years.
   Krzys said he only knows of one recent case in which a
transcript was introduced, involving a sergeant's call from the
Bethany barracks.
   The union has filed a lawsuit saying its members were as much
victims of the illegal taping as the public.

<HEAD>Sihanouk to Vacate U.N. Seat Only Under Certain Conditions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the exiled Cambodian
leader, said Monday that his resistance coalition will vacate its
U.N. seat only if the Vietnamese-installed government in Cambodia
is dismantled.
   Austalia's deputy secretary of foreign affairs, Michael
Costello, briefed Sihanouk and Chinese leaders separately on
Australia's suggestion that the United Nations set up an interim
administration in Cambodia so free elections can be held.
   Costello also met with Premier Li Peng, who said he hoped
friendly relations could be restored between Australia and China.
Relations have been strained following China's June crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators, which like most Western countries
Australia condemned.
   Sihanouk has said free elections are not possible in Cambodia
while the Vietnamese-installed government under Hun Sen remains in
office. Hun Sen, however, has demanded the resistance vacate
Cambodia's seat in the United Nations to ensure U.N. impartiality
while it acts as trustee.
   Costello's meeting at Sihanouk's residence in Beijing was
closed, but the prince later issued a 27-page open letter to
Costello, condemning Hun Sen's government and specifying his terms
for any U.N. trusteeship.
   ``I don't accept declaring Cambodia's seat vacant before the
simultaneous dismantling of the (resistance) and Hun Sen's `State
of Cambodia,' and the replacement of the illegal, pro-Vietnamese
administration of Hun Sen with a purely U.N. administration in all
villages and provinces,'' the letter said.
   Vietnam invaded neighboring Cambodia in late 1987 and ousted the
ruling Khmer Rouge, who had imposed a reign of terror. However, the
United Nations and many governments, including that of the United
States, recognize Sihanouk's three-party resistance coalition as
the rightful Cambodian government.
   Hun Sen has said he is willing to allow elections, but has
rejected Sihanouk's demand that he first dismantle his government
and set up an interim government representing all Cambodian
parties, including the Khmer Rouge. The Khmer Rouge are part of
Sihanouk's coalition.
   The issue remained stalemated until Australian Foreign Minister
Gareth Evans suggested in November that the United Nations
administer Cambodia during elections.
   Costello has met with officials in Cambodia, Vietnam and
Thailand to explain the proposal.
   The Australian Embassy said Costello's talks would be limited to
the problem of Cambodia and would not cover bilateral issues.
However, China's official Xinhua News Agency quoted Li Peng as
saying that although the two countries differ on some issues, ``We
still hope friendly, cooperative relations are restored.''
   He said, ``We stand for the forward-looking attitude and hope
both sides will join hands for this.''
   Australia suspended high-level exchanges with China following
the Chinese army attack on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing. The
embassy said Costello's visit did not indicate an end of this
sanction.

<HEAD>Witness Says Driver Ordered Drink Before Church Bus Crash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A witness, testifying Monday in the
murder trial of a driver whose collision with a church bus killed
27 people, said the man asked for a drink and ``drank it straight
down'' shortly before the crash.
   Kelly Osborne's testimony for the prosecution ``blew away'' the
argument by defendant Larry Mahoney's attorneys that Mahoney was
tricked into getting drunk, said Special Prosecutor Paul Richwalsky.
   Osborne was one of several rebuttal witnesses presented by the
prosecution after the defense rested its case Monday.
   Mahoney, 36, is accused of causing the nation's worst
drunken-driving accident the night of May 14, 1988, as he drove his
pickup truck on the wrong side of Interstate 71, five miles south
of Carrollton.
   The defense contends that Mahoney, thinking he had been handed a
glass of water, was duped into swigging from a tumbler of Osborne's
vodka the night of the crash.
   But Osborne was adamant Monday that he prepared a vodka and
Sprite at Mahoney's request, using a plastic cup.
   ``He just picked up the cup ... and he just drank it straight
down,'' Osborne said. ``He coughed a couple of times. I figured it
was just because he had drank it so quick.''
   Osborne, a retiree from Cincinnati, said he met Mahoney by
chance at the home of Jay Gibson, Osborne's neighbor at a
campground outside Carrollton.
   Mahoney arrived in his pickup with Gibson and another friend.
All were drinking beer.
   Mahoney ``asked me if I had any beer. ... They was out,''
Osborne said.
   Osborne said he didn't have any beer, but offered to give
Mahoney a mixed drink from the dregs of a half-gallon vodka bottle
kept stashed in his truck.
   Mahoney's attorneys pointed out that Osborne mentioned beer but
said nothing about vodka in at least three statements to
investigators, the first on June 10, 1988.
   ``Here's a guy who, less than four weeks after the accident,
couldn't remember anything,'' said one of the attorneys, Jack
Hildebrand.
   Richwalsky countered that defense attorneys, after talking about
Osborne's alleged role at length during the trial, did not put him
on the stand because they knew his testimony would be damaging.
   Testimony by two other prosecution witnesses aimed at rebutting
defense claims the disaster was caused in part by an inherently
dangerous bus.
   William Boehly, director of statistics and analysis for the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said buses are four
times safer than cars, based on accidents per miles traveled.
Boehly said there had never been a comparable disaster involving a
school bus.
   Hugh T. Spencer, a University of Louisville chemical engineering
professor, disputed defense testimony that smoke from the fire was
laced with cyanide caused by burning seat covers and cushions.
   Cyanide is flammable and was burned before having a chance to
poison any of the victims, Spencer said.
   The bus, a former school bus bought by the Radcliff First
Assembly of God church, was returning from a Cincinnati amusement
park at the time of the crash. Twenty-four children and three
adults died in the fire that followed the crash.
   Mahoney is charged with 27 counts of murder, 12 of assault, 42
of wanton endangerment and one count of drunken driving.

   The five presidents of the
Andean Pact, meeting on the remote Galapagos Islands, agreed Monday
to help promote the integration of their countries' economies and
eventually use a common currency.
   The presidents of Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and Bolivia
signed the ``Declaration of the Galapagos'' in a ceremony in Puerto
Ayora on the island of Santa Cruz.
   Presidents Rodrigo Borja of Ecuador, Virgilio Barco of Colombia,
Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, Alan Garcia of Peru and Jaime Paz
Zamora of Bolivia were to return to the Ecuadoran mainland, 600
miles away, before nightfall.
   But first the leaders planned to visit several of the
archipelago's islands to see the unique plant and animal life,
including giant tortoises, land and marine iguanas, seals and
species of birds found nowhere else on Earth.
   Upon their return to the mainland city of Guayaquil late Monday,
the four visiting presidents were scheduled to immediately fly home.
   The five presidents arrived Sunday in the Galapagos and met in
seclusion aboard a navy ship.
   The document signed Monday was prepared last week by the foreign
ministers of the five nations meeting in Guayaquil, Ecuador's most
populous city and its primary port.
   In the document the five presidents also agreed to forsake ``the
use of force'' to resolve disputes among member nations of the
Andean Pact and to ``abstain from actions against the territorial
integrity'' of members.
   In 1981 Ecuador and Peru fought a four-day border war. It was
sparked by Ecuador's long-standing claim of sovereignty over a
large tract of Amazon jungle in northeastern Peru.
   The five presidents also signed a separate document in which
they set goals they hoped to achieve in integrating their
countries' economies, including a common currency. No date for the
common currency was divulged.
   ``The creation of the European Common Market has indicated to us
the direction in which the world is advancing,'' Perez said in a
press conference in Puerto Ayora's municipal headquarters, where
the signing ceremony took place.
   Garcia called the Galapagos' summit ``the most important meeting
the Andean Pact has had'' in its 20 years of existence.
   In a press conference in Guayaquil Sunday before the presidents
flew to the Galapagos Islands, Paz Zamora said, ``If we don't make
a great effort, the Andean Pact is going to die on us.''
   In an attempt to rejuvenate the Andean Pact, the five presidents
agreed this year to meet every six months. The last meeting was in
May in Cartagena, Colombia, where President Bush is scheduled to
meet in February for a drug summit with Barco and other Latin
leaders.
   It is one of the oldest of a half dozen regional organizations
that have tried unsuccessfully to achieve economic integration.
   In recent years trade among the five Andean nations has declined
due to high tariffs.

   A U.S. lieutenant shot and wounded a
Panamanian corporal near an American installation Monday, U.S.
officials reported. It was the second shooting incident in three
days between U.S. and Panamanian forces.
   On Saturday, Panamanian soldiers shot and killed an American
officer near Panamanian military headquarters. President Bush on
Monday called that shooting ``an enormous outrage'' and said he
would not rule out military action.
   A U.S. Southern Command statement said that on Monday an
American was leaving a U.S. Army laundry in the Curundu area of
western Panama City when a uniformed Panamanian signaled him to
stop and approached him.
   The area is near Southern Command headquarters and less than a
mile from Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters.
   The statement said the U.S. officer fired when the Panamanian
appeared to reach for a weapon.
   ``The American responded defensively by pulling a weapon and
fired two shots,'' it said. ``The Panamanian went down, then got up
and left the scene. The extent of his injuries is unknown at this
time.''
   U.S. officials said the officer was being ``debriefed.''
   A Panamanian Defense Forces communique later called it
``reckless aggression'' by the U.S. Army.
   It said the American ``fired two shots from a firearm, one of
them hitting the left forearm'' of policeman Cesar Tejada. It said
the American was traveling in a vehicle that ``never stopped and on
the contrary, accelerated.''
   The communique said Tejada was hospitalized, but did not give
his condition.
   Capt. Moises Cortizo, Panama's chief of police, said police were
investigating.
   According to a Command official, the civilian laundry has a
contract to clean uniforms for U.S. forces.
   In Washington, a Defense Department official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, gave this account:
   A Panamanian traffic officer signaled the American to stop and
approached his car. The Panamanian pulled his weapon ``and the
lieutenant did the same.''
   The American fired two shots and it was believed the Panamanian
was wounded in a leg and an arm.
   Tensions still were high at the time because of Saturday's
death. Panamanian officials said the U.S. Army commander in Panama
threatened an invasion.
   ``This is the most serious incident we have had,'' a Command
spokesman said. ``This involved a loss of life. No course of action
is being ruled out as a response.''
   ``We are trying to be rational in our response. We are going to
take a calculated plan of action. The U.S. government does not
respond without thinking results through.''
   He spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Photographs of the 1981 Chevrolet with Michigan plates in which
the Americans were riding showed bullet holes, including two on the
driver's side and one through the trunk.
   U.S. officers said the shots came from Soviet-made AK rifles.
   The United States has taken no visible action since Saturday
other than to put its forces on maximum alert and display them
visibly in its military installations.
   The Pentagon said the officer was fatally shot and a Navy
officer and his wife were arrested and beaten Saturday night not
far from the military headquarters of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
the Panamanian leader.
   Panamanian Lt. Col. Arnulfo Castrejon Garcia on Monday called
``completely false'' allegations that the couple were mistreated,
though he confirmed they were arrested.
   U.S. troops in battle gear patrolled perimeter fences at their
bases Monday and Panamanian troops blocked the street in front of
the military headquarters, but life was normal in the rest of the
city.
   U.S. and Panamanian forces were holding a ``dialogue'' by
messenger, Castrejon told reporters. He said the U.S. Army South
commander, Gen. Marc Cisneros, had threatened an invasion.
   Asked why the United States had not already invaded, Castrejon
said, ``It could be they realize they went through the checkpoint.''
   A spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command, which controls all
U.S. forces in Panama, including U.S. Army South, said he could not
comment on Castrejon's statements.
   The Associated Press learned Panama's Defense Forces sent a
letter to U.S. military officials apparently trying to gain time
following the U.S. demand for an explanation.
   The Panamanian military said the letter ``demanded that U.S.
forces exercise maximum prudence to avoid unfortunate incidents.''
   It said U.S. forces ``disregarded our observations resulting in
unfortunate incidents as the one which occurred on the evening of
Dec. 16.''
   A U.S. military source said there had been no ``negotiations''
with the Panamanians concerning the incident.
   The United States said Panamanian troops were solely responsible
for the violence Saturday, that the U.S. officer and three
companions took a wrong turn and were lost.
   The Defense Forces accused U.S. officers of provocation and said
they ran through a Defense Forces checkpoint.
   In Washington, the White House said the violence was a
``consequence'' of Panama's being run by Noriega.
   Since February 1988, when Noriega was indicted in Florida on
narcotics charges, the United States has tried to drive him from
power with economic, diplomatic and political pressure.
   Noriega denies the charges. He claims Washington wants to renege
on treaties under which the United States is to transfer control of
the canal to Panama at the end of the century and close U.S.
military installations.
   Thousands of U.S. soldiers lived in Panama City until earlier
this year, when they and their dependents were ordered to move onto
the bases. Many dependents returned to the United States.
   The Command confirmed that the transfer of civilian dependents
from military posts ``was being stepped up.''
   The number of families still on post is 500, down from 3,200
last May.

   President Corazon Aquino threatened
Monday to close broadcast stations that air rebel propaganda and to
file charges against newspapers publishing articles that ``incite
rebellion.''
   The Senate and House of Representatives are expected to give
final approval this week to legislation granting Mrs. Aquino
special powers to restore order in the wake of the failed Dec. 1-9
coup by thousands of military mutineers.
   Although the bill does not give Mrs. Aquino additional powers to
clamp down on newspaper and broadcast operations, she told
reporters the government will take action against those spreading
rebel propaganda.
   Mrs. Aquino told reporters broadcasters operate under government
franchise and that the administration will strictly enforce
regulations forbidding ``subversive propaganda.''
   ``If they violate these terms and conditions, they will be
closed, their franchises will be taken away from them,'' Mrs.
Aquino said. ``With regard to print media, it's an entirely
different matter. We will base this on any article that will incite
to rebellion. If such an article does appear in any of the
newspapers, then we will go to court to file charges against the
erring individual or the publication.''
   There was no indication what criteria the government will use to
define inciting to rebellion or subversive propaganda. Since the
launch of the coup attempt, the sixth and worst since Mrs. Aquino
took office in February 1986, two radio stations were closed but
one was allowed back on the air.
   In a front-page editorial Tuesday, the Philippine Daily Inquirer
charged that the Aquino government ``appears to be moving toward
tighter restrictions on the press.''
   Meanwhile Monday, police said the Manila city hall was evacuated
about 9 a.m. after telephone reports that a bomb had been placed
there. No bomb was found, but the incident disrupted court hearings
and other business there for more than two hours.
   Pfc. Edilberto Capacete of the bomb disposal squad said the a
string of recent bomb threats appears part of a rebel plan to raise
tensions in the capital and undermine confidence in the government.
   Last Thursday, suspected mutineers fired two grenades at a U.S.
housing and recreational compound, damaging several cars but
causing no injuries. On Dec. 9, a grenade exploded at the city's
main post office, killing two people and injuring 18.
   Also Monday, four suspected Communist assassins killed a
surburban police chief as he drove to work in suburban Paranaque,
police said.
   In Quezon province, southeast of the capital, government forces
battled Communist rebels for about two hours Monday. Five
government troops and two civilians were wounded, the military
said. There was no report of military casualties but troops
recovered 22 rebel firearms, the report said.
   More than 20 people, including a town mayor, have been killed by
suspected rebels since the nine-day revolt that began Dec. 1,
according to military reports.
   On Tuesday, gunmen wounded the commander of a major military
camp in a daylight ambush and killed a policeman who intervened,
the military reported.
   It said Lt. Col. Eduardo Amoyo, commander of Camp Bagong Diwa,
was hit three times by rifle fire from an auto following his car in
suburban Mandaluyong.
   Amoyo was reported in stable condition after surgery.
   A witness told police the attack car got stuck on a traffic
median and the assailants fled in a commandeered taxi after killing
policeman Mario Hernandez, who tried to stop them.

<HEAD>13 Arabs Wounded During Protest Against Jewish Vandals</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS three grafs with battle in Lebanon</HEAD>

   Israeli soldiers Monday shot and wounded 13
Palestinians during a stone-throwing protest against vandalism by
Jewish settlers at a Gaza Strip building site planned to house
Palestinian refugees, Arab reporters said.
   Hospital officials said 18 other people were shot and wounded in
other clashes with Israeli troops in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   The 13 wounded in Rafah included a 10-year-old boy seriously
wounded in the head with rubber bullets and another 10-year-old
shot in the hand, hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed 10 wounded in another clash in Gaza's Shati
refugee camp and said it was checking the reports of wounded in
Rafah.
   An army spokeswoman said settlers attacked the construction site
in Rafah's Tel Sultan section on Sunday night, overturning a
foundation, slashing cement bags and sawing down a utility pole.
   The 5,800 Palestinian refugees are being settled in Rafah, on
the Egyptian border, as part of a family reunification program
under the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty. They were cut off from
families in Gaza when Israel returned the Sinai Desert to Egypt as
part of the treaty.
   The reunification is expected to take more than a year, and
several families from Egypt laid the foundations of homes two weeks
as a first step.
   After the vandalism, the Committee for Gaza Settlements, which
represents the almost 2,500 Jewish settlers in the area, released a
statement to the press threatening more action if the resettlement
effort continues.
   ``The settler's committee promises that it will not rest and
will not be silent until the decision is changed regarding the
resettlement of refugees in Tel Sultan,'' the statement said.
   Committee member Yigal Kirshinzaft said on Israel radio, ``We
won't leave one stone on top of another in this place. Terrorists
will not be allowed in the borders of this state.''
   The army spokeswoman said the military is prepared to take
measures to protect the building site but would not say what
actions have been taken.
   At least 631 Palestinians and 43 Israelis have been killed
during the two-year-old uprising against Israeli occupation.
Palestinians also have killed 161 fellow Arabs, mostly on suspicion
of collaborating.
   The latest victim was a 30-year-old woman, Suad Abu Hadrus, who
died on Monday. She was beaten by masked youths Sunday in the Askar
refugee camp near Nablus in the West Bank, Israel radio said. It
said she was killed on ``morality grounds.''
   Some Arabs have been killed for ``moral offenses'' against the
Palestinian revolt, such as prostitution or drug-dealing.
   In Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon,
Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen killed two Arab guerrillas in a
gunbattle Monday, Israeli military officials said. One militiaman
was also killed, they said.
   The clash between the guerrillas and the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army occurred in the eastern sector of the zone near Ayn
Habbariyah, a village five miles north of the Israeli border. The
guerrilla group was not identified.
   The zone is patrolled by Israeli soldiers and the 3,000-member
South Lebanon Army, a mostly Christian force trained and financed
by Israel.

   A lawyer was killed by a bomb blast in his
Savannah office Monday and a mailed bomb was removed safely from
the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, two days after a postal
bomb killed an 11th Circuit judge at his Alabama home.
   In Birmingham, Ala., where authorities were investigating the
bombing which killed U.S. Circuit Judge Robert S. Vance on
Saturday, an FBI agent said there were ``strong similarities''
among the three devices.
   Savannah attorney Robert Robinson, a black civil rights activist
and city alderman, died of his injuries at 8:25 p.m. while
undergoing surgery in Memorial Medical Center following the blast
in his office around 5 p.m., officials said.
   ``He lost his right arm, his left hand and some upper body
tissue and (had) severe damage to his legs,'' said Floyd Adams, a
fellow alderman. Robinson was unable to communicate with his
doctors, a hospital spokesman said.
   In downtown Atlanta, shaken employees evacuated the five-story
11th Circuit courthouse shortly before 10 a.m. Monday after the
bomb, in a small brown package, was found ``during a random
sampling of the mail,'' said police Maj. W.W. Holley.
   ``The preliminary investigation (in Savannah) indicates strong
similarities to the other explosive devices in Birmingham and
Atlanta,'' said FBI Agent Tom Moore.
   Moore said FBI and postal service bomb experts who were in
Birmingham yesterday and in Atlanta today are being flown to
Savannah. He wouldn't say whether the bomb came in Robinson's mail,
and Savannah police referred inquiries to the FBI.
   Savannah police refused to release details of the bombing, but
Clerk of Council Dyanne Reese said police told the mayor's office
Robinson ``received a package, similar to what's been happening in
Atlanta and Birmingham.''
   ``I was talking with Robby on the phone just before the bomb
exploded,'' said Mayor John Rousakis. ``We were discussing a
community-wide meeting on drugs ... tonight to be held at his
church.''
   Ms. Reese said said police originally believed a gas leak caused
the explosion, but later concluded it was a bomb.
   Vance, 58, died Saturday and his wife was seriously injured when
they opened a package addressed to him at their home in Mountain
Brook, a suburb of Birmingham.
   The Atlanta bomb was removed from the headquarters of the
12-member 11th Circuit, which handles federal appeals from Alabama,
Georgia and Florida. Vance was based in Birmingham and kept his
office there. Much of the 11th Circuit's caseload is drug-related
appeals.
   Vance also fought for racial moderation and progressive stands
in Alabama during 11 years as state chairman of the Democratic
Party. He was nominated to the court in 1977 by then-President
Carter.
   Investigators said there is nothing so far to tie Vance's
assassination to drug traffickers or his civil rights stand.
   In the past year, six pipe bombs were left in mailboxes in the
nearby suburb of Hoover, The New York Times reported Monday, citing
unidentified FBI officials.
   Only one of the bombs exploded, injuring the person thought to
have planted it, but authorities said they could have been lethal,
the Times reported.
   One such recipient, Chriss Doss, was a former associate of Vance
in the Alabama Democratic Party, the Times said.
   State Rep. Jim Pannell of Savannah, who went to law school with
Robinson, said Robinson handled many criminal and personal injury
cases, but could not think of any which would have supplied a
motive for the bombing.
   Robinson represented the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People in a long-running desegregation case
against the Savannah school system, Pannell said.
   In Washington, D.C., Justice Department spokesman David Runkel
said, ``I think it's premature to draw any conclusions. ... At this
time, there is no civil rights investigation.''
   Runkel noted that Robinson's clients had included accused
cocaine dealers, adding ``there may be different theories floating
around out there.''
   The Savannah bombing occurred just hours after the pipe bomb was
removed from the Atlanta courthouse.
   Bomb specialists examined X-ray pictures of the package before a
technician in head-to-toe protective gear removed through the
court's front door, under a large flag flying at half-staff in
memory of Vance.
   Flak-jacketed officers and federal agents had sealed off the
street in front of the block-long courthouse and the package _
about 10 inches by 10 inches and 4 inches deep _ was placed in a
bomb-proof canister and taken away.
   Police confirmed the package was a bomb that afternoon, said
Postal Inspector Al Adams. The package contained a detonating
device, he said.
   Holley said the brown paper-wrapped package had arrived by mail,
not by hand delivery, and was addressed to the court, not to an
individual, unlike the bomb that killed Vance, Adams said.
   The package had a return address, but Adams declined to disclose
it, saying such addresses are always phony. ``We don't want to get
innocent people involved,'' he said.
   Adams did say the return address was not that of a federal
judge. The package that killed Vance listed the sender as another
federal judge at an almost certainly phony address, The Atlanta
Constitution said, quoting unidentified sources.
   Adams said Atlanta police dismantled the bomb without detonating
it and destroying the package. ``That's a big help to our
investigation,'' he said.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
President Bush had contacted Attorney General Dick Thornburgh about
the investigation.
   ``The attorney general advised him we have not reached any
conclusions,'' Fitzwater said. ``We just don't have any answers yet
as to who might have done it to him.''
   Even before Monday's bomb scare, workers at the 11th Circuit
were scared because of Vance's assassination. During the
evacuation, several who declined to give their names and said they
were ordered not to speak to reporters, said they are reluctant to
return to work.
   When the courthouse was closed, employees were told to call
before returning to work Tuesday _ not only because of the bomb,
but because of unusual December snow in Atlanta early Monday.
   Federal judges around the country had been advised after Vance's
death not to open packages received in the mail until they could be
inspected.
   The FBI said it was giving top priority to finding out who
mailed the bomb that killed Vance, who was believed to be the third
federal judge assassinated in this century _ all three
assassinations occurring in the last 10 years.
   The 11th Circuit Court had opened for business as usual Monday,
despite the snowfall which had many of the city's law offices
opening late.
   Lamar Pope, supervisor of court security for the Northern
District of Georgia, would not comment on increased security
measures at the appeals court. But officials acknowledged that
plans for tighter security were going into effect at Atlanta's
Richard B. Russell Building _ home of the U.S. District Court and
other federal offices. Those plans began two months ago.

<TEXT>
   A 72-year-old native of Byleorussia who emigrated
to Canada in 1951 has been charged under Canadian war crimes
legislation with the murder of 490 people, the Justice Department
said Monday.
   Bill Hobson, chief of the department's war crimes unit, said
Michael Pawlowski was arrested at his home in Renfrew, about 60
miles west of Ottawa, and was held pending a bail hearing.
   Hobson said charges filed in the Supreme Court of Ontario
specify eight counts of murder _ four under Criminal Code
provisions dealing with war crimes and four with crimes against
humanity.
   The counts accuse Pawlowski of murdering 410 Jews and 80
non-Jewish Poles in 1942, during World War II, in the Byelorussian
republic of the Soviet Union. No mention was made as to whether
Pawlowski was serving in a military unit at the time.
   He was charged with murdering 400 Jews in the small village of
Snov; 10 more Jews who escaped the first killings; and 80 Poles in
the same region.
   Pawlowski, described as a horticulturist, has lived in the
Renfrew area since coming to Canada in 1951; five years later he
became a Canadian citizen.
   Under federal legislation passed two years ago, Canadian
residents can be tried here for war crimes or crimes against
humanity committed elsewhere.
   The government has moved against two other people accused as war
criminals since 1987.
   The war crimes unit was set up after a royal commission
recommended urgent action against 20 prime suspects who came to
Canada after World War II.

<TEXT>
   Entertainer Arsenio Hall testified Monday
that he and Eddie Murphy conceived the idea for the movie ``Coming
to America,'' but columnist Art Buchwald said he wrote a similar
story five years earlier.
   Buchwald, testifying in his $5 million lawsuit against Paramount
Pictures, said he later heard his story had been optioned to Murphy.
   The Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist and author claims he wrote
the original idea and had a contract with Paramount to develop it
into a script.
   Hall, testifying for Paramount, said he never saw Buchwald's
screenplay idea, ``King For A Day,'' before he and Murphy began
work.
   Both stories involve a member of African royalty who comes to
the United States, falls in love and takes home a bride. Paramount
says Buchwald's script idea and ``Coming to America'' were not
similar.
   Outside court, Hall, who co-starred in the 1988 hit film and is
host of a late-night talk show, told reporters he considered
accusations of plagiarism insulting and absurd. He insisted: ``It's
obviously our script.''
   ``... I'm offended (by the accusations) because Eddie is a very
bright man. I'm a bright guy. Why do we have to seek a stolen
concept? It's insulting,'' he said.
   Buchwald told reporters he was sorry Hall felt insulted.
   ``I like Arsenio. He's a nice fellow,'' he said. ``This is
between Paramount and me.''
   In court, Buchwald told Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider
that his script idea, ``It's a Crude, Crude World,'' was based on a
``data bank'' of experiences he keeps in his head.
   Buchwald said the king he wrote about may have been based on a
Watusi king he interviewed in Africa in the 1950s. ``He was a real
king and he drove a Studebaker,'' he recalled.
   He also said he also used an incident in which he saw a protest
against the shah of Iran and wondered what the shah would do if he
couldn't go home.
   Soon after he wrote the script idea, Buchwald said, producer
Alain Bernheim sold the option to Paramount. The writer said he
received $17,500, ``less 10 per cent to my agent.''
   He said negotiations began for Louis Malle to direct and then he
heard that Eddie Murphy would star. ``I was delighted,'' Buchwald
said.
   The writer was to take the stand again Tuesday to explain how
plans for the movie were abandoned and the option was dropped.
   Earlier, Hall testified that he and Murphy had been intent on
improving the image of black people as well as Murphy's own screen
image.
   ``There had never been a black fairy tale,'' Hall said. ``We
wanted to create like a fairy tale _ beautiful _ like the prince
got the girl. We wanted a fairy tale everyone could relate to.''
   Hall said he and Murphy wanted to shape the screenplay
themselves because ``otherwise, it would just be another black
story written by white people.''
   As far as Murphy's image, he said: ``We did a facelift on his
character. He was not the wisecracking Axel Foley character from
`Beverly Hills Cop.' This showed him soft, sensitive,
non-materialistic. He was a gentleman. In this movie, he was the
perfect man. Any woman would love him.''
   At one point, Hall said he and Murphy are as close as brothers,
but under questioning said he would not lie for Murphy.
   Hall noted that two other writers got the screen credit for
``Coming to America'' and said that if Murphy knew Buchwald was the
writer, he would have had no problem giving him credit.
   Hall was followed to the witness stand by Paramount Chairman
Frank Mancuso who described Murphy's rich contract with the studio,
which gives him $8 million a picture plus 15 per cent of gross
profits.
   He indicated Murphy wants more.
   ``Like a good baseball player, we're always negotiating with
him,'' Mancuso said. ``He's a very important star.''
   Courtroom spectators included famed screenwriter and director
Billy Wilder, who said he came to give moral support to Buchwald
and Bernheim, who is also a plaintiff.
   Hall's appearance in the downtown courthouse set off a buzz of
excitement. Several deputies and bailiffs rushed to the court to
get his autograph and one brought a camera to get his picture taken
with Hall.
   Buchwald, observing the commotion, shook his head and said,
``All this over a breach-of-contract suit?''

   Sultan Qaboos of Oman opened a summit
meeting of Persian Gulf states Monday with a call for the United
Nations to redouble its efforts to arrange a peace treaty between
Iran and Iraq.
   He also noted that recent reforms in Eastern Europe provide new
opportunities for cooperation with this region.
   Other participants in the four-day summit of the Gulf
Cooperation Council were sheiks Isa bin Salman al-Khalifa of
Bahrain, Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah of Kuwait, Khalifa bin Hamad
al-Thani of Qatar and Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan of the United Arab
Emirates and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
   The regional leaders were expected to focus on how trade can
boost their national economies now that the Iraq-Iran war is over
and oil prices are inching up.
   A U.N.-brokered cease-fire in the war took hold in August 1988.
However, talks have failed to produce an agreement on exchanging
prisoners of war, withdrawing troops to international borders, and
other sticking points.
   The summit probably will issue a statement stressing the need
for a firm peace treaty. However, the bloc's influence is weakened
by Iranian accusations that it is biased toward Iraq, diplomats say.
   Participants were also expected to discuss setting up a common
tariff structure and coordinating development plans.
   Qaboos noted that the recent reformist wave in Eastern Europe
toward economic and political freedom means new opportunites for
cooperation and for the conservative gulf states to gain a
``progressive role and effective presence in this changing world.''
   He said such moves would require new policies but did not spell
them out.
   He also asked the people of Lebanon to carry out an Arab
League-sponsored peace plan to end Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war
and said Israel must be pressured to solve the Palestinian problem.

<TEXT>
   A missionary couple and 28 Haitian children
they intend to adopt and raise as one family were welcomed home
Monday by applauding friends and relatives.
   Dan and Kathy Blackburn, Christian Evangelical missionaries who
fled Haiti for the Dominican Republic with the children in 1987,
took the children to a church camp in Letts, Ind., where they will
live temporarily in a dormitory.
   ``We're coming home after fifteen years. We'll just take it day
by day,'' Blackburn, 45, said as the greeters gave candy to the
sweater-clad children at Indianapolis International Airport.
   The children, who speak English, range in age from 3 to 14 and
most have lived with the Blackburns since infancy. All but two came
to the couple as babies, including one who was just six hours old.
   ``The baby was found in a hut, and its mother was dead,'' said
Mrs. Blackburn, 42.
   Asked how she and her husband managed to keep track of 28
children, she said: ``Jesus Christ. There is no other secret. Jesus
has always taken care of us.''
   Her husband, asked how the couple planned to feed and cloth the
children, said, ``I think the Lord will provide.''
   The Rev. Bob Lay, pastor of Community Church near the
Blackburns' hometown of Elizabethtown, said the family eventually
will find another place or build a home large enough to accommodate
the whole group.
   ``The churches and organizations that have sponsored them for 14
years will continue,'' he said.
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service granted the
children special holiday parole status allowing them legal entry
with the couple.
   ``Cases like the Blackburns' show us that the law can be
administered with heart,'' INS commissioner Gene McNary said in
Miami earlier in the day. ``We would have made the same decision at
any time of year but getting the family home before Christmas made
it all the more satisfying.''
   The Blackburns and the children fled from Haiti to the Dominican
Republic in 1987 to escape political turmoil when the Hatian
government collapsed. The two countries split a Caribbean island.
   Mrs. Blackburn said they left Haiti because of threats from
villagers.
   ``We left in the middle of the night with the clothes on our
backs,'' she said. ``We ran for our lives. ... I was trying to save
their lives and ours too.''
   Asked if she had smuggled the children out of Haiti, she said:
``I guess so.... Yeah, I did.''
   INS spokesman Duke Austin said the conditions under which the
Blackburns and the children left Haiti was not an issue.
   Monday the group flew first to Miami International Airport,
where the children, some clutching stuffed animals, played and
watched planes take off while their new parents took care of
last-minute red tape.
   They then boarded a flight to Indianapolis.
   McNary granted the children humanitarian parole because they
were ineligible for entry under any other immigration category.
Under INS law, the commissioner may allow an otherwise inadmissable
alien to enter the country temporarily for humanitarian reasons, or
when such entry is in the national interest.
   The Blackburns, Christian Evangelical missionaries, went to
Haiti in 1976 with their two sons and started a ministry in a small
mountain village, the U.S. Justice Department said. After about 18
months, they began caring for sick or abandoned children taken to
their home.
   The Blackburns and the children were forced to flee into the
Dominican Republic in 1987 after rebels threatened to kill them
during the turmoil when the Duvalier government collapsed, the INS
said.
   In the Dominican Republic, they found a home with the help of
other missionaries while they worked to find a way to adopt the
children and return to Indiana.
   They were unable to complete the adoptions in Haiti or the
Dominican Republic because the children's natural parents are dead,
unknown or untraceable.
   With the help of various church groups, the Blackburns
petitioned the INS to permit the children to come to this country
so they could complete the adoptions in Indiana, said Austin.
   After their petition was approved by McNary in early December,
the INS worked with the State Department to speed up the paperwork
so the family could be home together by Christmas.

   Initiating the painful process of
dismantling a centrally run economy, the Solidarity-led government
has introduced legislation to break up state monopolies and turn
industry over to the private sector.
   It will be the most radical economic reform ever attempted in
the East bloc _ and massive unemployment and steep price increases
are initially expected as state subsidies to industry end, forcing
unprofitable enterprises to close.
   The Warsaw Pact country whose people led the way in forcing an
end to four decades of Communist domination now faces the daunting
task of rebuilding a wrecked economy from the ground up.
   Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz announced the program to a

   Six months into its review of federal energy
policy, the Bush administration has come to at least one clear
conclusion: the Reagan-era theme of ``just keep the oil flowing and
keep it cheap'' is too simplistic for the 1990s.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins says oil inevitably will be
the dominant fuel well into the 21st century. He has become
convinced, though, that the federal government must do more now to
begin curing the nation of its costly oil addiction.
   It's not yet clear how the new federal role will be written, but
almost certainly it will emphasize the virtues of conservation and
renewable energy resources.
   That alone would be a major change from the eight years of the
Reagan administration, which tried to abolish the Energy Department
and, failing that, consistently cut its budget for energy
conservation. The department's 1989 conservation budget was less
than one-third its 1980 level, adjusted for inflation.

   Now, Ritter is faced with allegations that threaten not only his

   Last week, Ritter was forced to call a news conference to deny
reports that he had sex with a young man he had helped, and that he
improperly spent Covenant House funds on the man.

   Attempts to reintroduce caribou to Maine
have been thwarted by disease and bears, but based on the success
of a hearty doe named Daisy, officials will keep trying to
``transplant'' animals from Canada.
   ``We were amazed she was in as good condition as she was in''
after a 600-mile trek into and out of Canada, said wildlife
biologist Mark McCollough, leader of the privately funded Maine
Caribou Project.
   Of a dozen North American reindeer released last spring in
Baxter State Park, only Daisy is known to be alive, although a
second caribou that lost its radio collar may also be, said Richard
B. Anderson, project coordinator.
   Five caribou died after being attacked by bears, and five died
of the ``brainworm'' parasite. Others still being kept in pens have
been ravaged by brainworm and ulcers, said Anderson. More than two
dozen caribou that were used as a breeding herd remain in pens at
the University of Maine at Orono.

   The role of Washington manipulator Gen.
Leland Masters on CBS' ``Wiseguy'' was written to be a big,
imposing American Caesar.
   The producers had in mind Gregory Peck, who portrayed Gen.
Douglas MacArthur in the movie ``MacArthur.'' After considering it,
Peck turned it down. The producers then considered Kirk Douglas,
Richard Widmark and others before turning to Norman Lloyd, who was
cast in the role.
   Lloyd, who spent six years on ``St. Elsewhere'' as the saintly,
cancer-stricken Dr. Daniel Auschlander, brings a new aspect to the
role. In a way, Masters is more dangerous, more cunning because of
Lloyd's benign appearance.
   ``I saw him instead as a man of some intellectual power,'' Lloyd
said of the fictional general.
   ``One of our best generals ... was an intellectual: Vinegar Joe
Stillwell. He was a small, wiry man. He'd been a schoolteacher. He
would not have thought the way Masters did, however. Masters would
have been closer to Chiang Kai-shek than Stillwell.''
   In the current five-week arc on ``Wiseguy,'' Vinnie Terranova
(Ken Wahl) comes out of cover at the instance of Masters to
investigate a scheme to undermine the economy of Japan.
   ``Somebody wants to flood Japan with counterfeit money and he
wants Vinnie Terranova to work on it,'' said Lloyd. ``As it
unfolds, we see that Masters is the heavy and he's setting up
Vinnie to be the patsy.
   ``Their antagonism goes back several years ago when Vinnie
stymied Masters' pet project, the invasion of Isle Pavot. Masters
pretends to uncover this plot, but it's all to frame Vinnie to get
his revenge.''
   Early in his career, Lloyd usually played villains. He was the
bad guy who fell from the Statue of Liberty in Alfred Hitchcock's
``Saboteur'' in 1942. That spectacular scene is often studied in
film schools.
   ``When I see that I mourn for my lost hair,'' said Lloyd. ``It
was red.''
   Lloyd was in Hitchcock's ``Spellbound,'' which starred Gregory
Peck and Ingrid Bergman, and in 1957 Hitchcock brought him out from
New York to produce ``Alfred Hitchcock Presents.'' He spent eight
years on the series and directed 25 episodes.
   In ``Dead Poets Society,'' he was not a villain, but he
represents the establishment in his conflicts with Robin Williams
and the students.
   ``Gen. Masters is a political power behind the scenes,'' Lloyd
said. ``His power reaches right into the White House. He's on the
National Security Commission. He's a very dangerous fellow. The
writers threw in some wonderful throwaway lines. I have a line, `I
told them we needed more helicopters in the desert.' You know right
away it refers to the attempt to rescue the hostages in Iran.
   ``I think this show gets into some controversial issues in a
dramatic way. It has energetic, gutsy stories.''
   Lloyd said he found the role a refreshing change from Dr.
Auschlander, who had a long remission from cancer. Apparently, in
the beginning Auschlander was not meant to stay around, but the
producers had a change of heart. He was still working at the end of
the series.
   ``As a heavy, you're always in conflict,'' he said. ``You're
into the energy of the piece. When you play a hero you have to
create situations of interest to the audience that aren't just
white bread. It's easier to play a heavy. It's more dramatic.
   ``The new-found freedom of television helps. You don't have to
say `gee whiz.' You can say words that are closer to reality.''
   Lloyd has a book coming out based on his oral history for the
Directors Guild. It tells of his work with such directors and
filmmakers as Jean Renoir, Charlie Chaplin, Orson Welles, Bertolt
Brecht, Lewis Milestone and Alfred Hitchcock.

<HEAD>New Decade Means It's Census Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the 20th time since the founding of the
republic, your government is setting out to learn something about
each of you _ and quite a lot about many of us.
   Where do you live? How old are you and what's your race? Are you
single, married or living with an ``unmarried partner''? How big is
your house, what's it worth and is it paid for?
   Yes, it's time once again for a new decade and another census.
   Even now, massive printing presses are churning out the more
than 100 million forms that will be needed to count over 250
million Americans April 1.
   Originally required as a count of the population to help divide
up seats in the House of Representatives, the census has become an
effort to assess the state of the nation.
   The debate about what to ask in 1990 has been under way for most
of this decade. Since 1984 there have been 65 public meetings
around the nation to get the public's comments and suggestions.
More than 5,000 people attended.
   Suggestions that the Census Bureau ask people about their
religion, their pets and their sexual preference come up often _
and are rejected every time.
   A proposal to ask about citizenship, in an effort to determine
the number of illegal aliens, was also not included on the short
form intended to enumerate everyone living in the United States.
Few people in this country illegally would be likely to admit as
much to the government, officials said.
   In choosing what to ask, census officials considered the needs
of government agencies, tried to repeat as many questions as
possible from the past to maintain consistent statistics and
realized that asking too much would result in people refusing to
cooperate.
   Indeed, the Office of Management and Budget, complaining of a
``paperwork burden'' for the public, fought a battle wth the Census
Bureau over some of the questions.
   The bureau produced a 150-page study justifying the questions it
is asking. After finding little support for some of the information
collected the last time, the agency has dropped questions about
marital history and home air conditioning.
   Most homes will receive the form in the mail in late March and
are expected to mail it back after April 1. Census takers will go
only to some rural homes and to other places from which the mailed
forms were not returned.
   As in 1980, when mailed forms largely replaced census takers,
the Postal Service will deliver forms to more that four out of five
homes in the country, based on address lists purchased from
commercial firms and compiled by the Census Bureau. Census takers
will go to areas where no adequate address lists could be obtained.
   Over the years, hundreds of federal programs have developed that
disperse money and projects on the basis of census statistics, and
thus need specific information collected every 10 years.
   Welfare programs and highway funds, job training and mass
transit projects, education and urban renewal all depend on the
census for raw data.
   Simple pride results in some data being kept when statisticians
want to drop it.
   This time, for example, the Census Bureau wanted to leave a
blank for people to write in their ethnic group if they had checked
off ``Asian or Pacific Islander'' under race.
   In 1980 that question offered a list of possible Asian and
Pacific Island groups and a check-off box beside each.
   Members of Congress representing areas with many Asians and
Pacific Islanders didn't like the proposed change and got a bill
through Congress to restore the 1980 style. So, in April, the
census form will have a list of check-off boxes for such groups as
Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese, Asian
Indian, Samoan and Guamian as well as the write-in space for folks
who don't fit any of those categories.
   The end result is two census forms, just as in 1980.
   One form will be sent to every home in the nation _ more than
106 million. That form contains seven questions about individuals
and seven about housing.
   One household in six will receive a long form, which amounts to
a massive random sample of the nation.
   Besides the questions on the short form, the long one asks 26
more about individuals and 19 more about housing.
   The personal questions include ones dealing with ancestry, work
and income; the housing questions include ones asking about
plumbing, telephones and building age.

   Here is a list of the questions on the Census
Bureau's 1990 short form, which will go to every household in the
nation.
   PERSONAL
   1. ``List ... the names of each person living here on Sunday,
April 1. ...''
   Same question as 1980.
   The first person listed, formerly known as the ``head of
household,'' has become the ``householder'' or ``reference
person.'' The choice of who to list first is entirely up to the
individual filling out the form.
   2. Asks how other residents are related to Person 1.
   Similar to the 1980 question.
   Choices range from husband@wife to other relatives to not
related. Spaces also offer such possibilities as roomer@boarder,
housemate, unmarried partner and other.
   3. Asks each resident's sex.
   As in 1980, the choices are male and female.
   4. Asks the race of each resident.
   This is similar to the 1980 question, offering such choices as
``white;'' ``black or negro;'' ``Indian (American),'' with a space
to write in the tribe; ``Eskimo;'' ``Aleut,'' and ``Asian or
Pacific Islander,'' with several checkoff boxes for Asian groups,
as well as a write-in space for choices not listed.
   5. Asks the age and year of birth of each resident.
   Similar to the 1980 question.
   6. Asks the marital status of each resident.
   This is the same as in 1980 except that it drops the question
about whether people have been married before and about whether
that marriage ended because of the death of a spouse.
   Choices include married, widoweed, divorced, separated and never
married.
   7. Asks each resident if he is of Spanish@Hispanic origin?
   Similar to the 1980 question.
   Choices include no, yes-Mexican, yes-Puerto Rican, yes-Cuban and
yes-other, with a write-in blank for detail.
   The long form adds 26 personal questions, including ones dealing
with state or country of birth, education, ancestry, military
service, disability, employment, income and commuting habits.
   HOUSING
   H1. ``Did you leave anyone out of your list of persons for
Question 1 because you were not sure if the person should be
listed. ...''
   Same as the 1980 question.
   H2. ``Which best descrbes this building?''
   Similar to 1980, choices include such options as mobile home,
one-family house or apartment building.
   H3. ``How many rooms do you have in this house or apartment?''
   Same question as in 1980.
   H4. Asks if the residence is owned or rented.
   Similar to 1980 but adds a category to separate homeowners with
mortgates from those whose mortgages are paid off.
   Other choices include rented for cash and occupied without
payment of rent.
   H5. ``Is this house on 10 or more acres?'' and ``Is there a
business or medical office on this property?''
   Similar to 1980, this questions separates farms and businesses
from single-family dwellings. That way, the value of a farm, estate
or commercial structure isn't calculated into average home prices.
   H6. ``What is the value of this peoperty?''
   Offers a series of checkoffs for people to evaluate their homes.
Similar to 1980 except that in 1980 the top category was ``$200,000
or more'' and now the top is ``$500,000 or more.''
   H7. ``What is the monthly rent'' and ``Does the monthly rent
include any meals?''
   The first question is similar to 1980 but adds more categories.
The top rent in 1980 was $500; now it's $1,000. The second question
is new and is designed to gather information on special housing for
the elderly, which often includes some meals in the rent.
   The long form adds 19 housing questions, including ones dealing
with the number of bedrooms, whether there are complete plumbing
facilities, if there is a complete kitchen, the presence of
telephone, the number of automobiles owned, the fuel used for heat,
the source of water, whether a public sewer is used and when the
building was built.

   When the clock strikes midnight, strange
things happen at the Dog Temple, which was dedicated to the
fidelity of a dog but now attracts gangsters, prostitutes,
housewife stock whizzes and forlorn lovers.
   Tough guys roll up in sports cars, sauntering to the altar to
pray on their knees. Girls in miniskirts and low-cut blouses,
accompanied by bodyguards in leather jackets, place incense in
sacrificial urns. Their bouffant hairdos bob as they mumble prayers.
   Middle-aged women, clutching copies of stock market listings,
drop wood blocks in a Buddhist ritual as they search for an
ethereal tip.
   ``I'm praying against VD,'' said a prostitute with fluorescent
pink lipstick, who called herself Fragrant Flower. ``We `Little
Misses' need all the protection we can get.''
   Praying has become a big business on this island of 20 million
people, where superstition is pervasive. Thousands of temples
throughout Taiwan do a steady trade in fortune-telling.
Astrologers, palmists and soothsayers have flocked to the big
cities to give advice on Taiwan's huge stock market and the
popular, illegal numbers game.
   Buddhist, Taoist or Confucian, all temples are in on the act.
But perhaps the most famous is the Dog Temple, on a cliff
overlooking the sea about 15 miles from Taipei.
   Legend has it that about 100 years ago, 17 fishermen were caught
in a storm and pitched overboard. Their bodies washed up on the
shore.
   Local villagers dug a grave for them by the coast. As they
buried the fishermen, the vessel's pet dog jumped into the ditch to
be with his masters. The villagers buried the dog alive and hung a
lantern on the grave to commemorate its fidelity.
   For years, fishermen used the grave as a navigation marker when
steering their junks into the harbor in rough weather.
   In 1961, a group of local businessmen built a temple on the
site, equipped with bronze dogs, sacrificial urns with canine
engravings and statues of Taoist sages.
   In 1975, the temple doubled in size and began staying open 24
hours a day. It started a store and hired dozens of people to sell
temple paraphernalia _ clay dogs, incense, paper money that is
burned for the dead.
   When plans were made for a nuclear power plant next door, the
temple appeared doomed. But local pressure saved the site and now
nuclear plant officials come to the Dog Temple to pray.
   Some businessmen opened a replica of the Dog Temple just down
the road to cash in on the excitement. But after a few months, it
lost customers.
   ``They could feel there was no power there,'' explained Wang
Yuan-yuan, a Dog Temple board member, who was working the graveyard
shift at the advice counter recently. ``Only we have the genuine
article _ the dog spirit.''
   Business has been so profitable, said Wang that the temple is
planning a dog theme park just up the hill.
   ``The little dog has been so good to us, we want to pay him
back,'' he said.
   Hsiao Hsin-huang, a professor of sociology at National Taiwan
University, says uncertainty about the future has fanned the prayer
craze on this Nationalist Chinese island. He estimates that temples
make millions selling religious goods and gathering contributions.
   ``Nobody knows what will happen so people naturally turn to the
gods,'' he said. ``People are only interested in fast money and
many of them believe in luck.''
   Over the past few decades, Taiwan's economy has boomed, bringing
its per capita gross national product to the equivalent of $7,518
in 1988, the fourth highest in Asia.
   The growth also has created huge savings but the economy lacks
investment opportunities, so much of the cash floods the highly
speculative stock market. In 1987, the market had an up and down
swing of 450 percent. Record rises and falls were registerd on two
consecutive days in November.
   Proper investment techniques do not seem to work very well
because big players control the market. Many investors resort to
prayer.
   Thick clouds of eye-stinging incense swirl around the temple's
red columns.
   Two elderly ladies, both with pink pocketbooks, pluck sheets of
paper from the wall and head to Wang Yuan-yuan's advice desk.
   ``We're here looking for good bets,'' says one woman. ``We play
the stock market and we need a little advice.''
   ``Mr. Wang says we have to buy stocks tomorrow,'' her friend
says after the consultation ends. ``He gave me two numbers.''
   ``There it is, eighth column, fifth stock,'' she says, pointing
to her stock chart. ``That's what I'll buy.''
   Up the stairs on the altar, 18-year-old Chao Cheng is on his
knees mumbling.
   ``I'm in love with an older woman,'' says the doe-eyed student.
``Dog Spirit says I have hope but I must use special skill.''

<HEAD>Film Based on St. Teresa Held as Blasphemous by British Film Censors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The visions of St. Teresa of Avila, the
16th-century Spanish nun, have run afoul of Britain's film censors,
who have invoked the little-used blasphemy law for the first time.
   The producers of ``Visions of Ecstasy,'' a 20-minute video about
the saint, lost an appeal to the Video Appeals Committee, which has
met just six times since it was created five years ago.
   John Stephenson, producer of the video, said his company was
considering a further appeal, to Britain's High Court.
   ``We condemn the decision as a disgraceful act of censorship,''
Stephenson said. ``Free expression in relation to religion is a
fundamental right in a pluralistic society.''
   The video was defended by novelists Fay Weldn and Marina Warner
as a legitimate exploration of the connection between sexual
passion and religious fervor as expressed in such Christian notions
as ``the bride of Christ.''
   The video was ``not in any way an insult to God, who, I might
suggest, is not easily insulted,'' Ms. Weldon told the appeals
committee.
   The video shows Teresa caressing the body of Christ on the cross
and in amorous embraces with another woman. The producers say the
scenes are clearly Teresa's imagination, and the two women
represent two sides of her personality.
   It is the first time in 77 years that the board of censors had
rejected a film because of the blasphemy law. It was given
responsibility for reviewing videos in 1984.
   Recently, the board cleared Martin Scorsese's controversial
movie, ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' though it was condemned
by many Christians because it included a brief scene of Christ
imagining that he was making love with Mary Magdalene.
   ``It indicated that Christ had sex,'' James Ferman, director of
the film classification board, told the appeals panel at the
hearing on ``Visions of Ecstacy.''
   Ferman said he thought the video showed contempt for the
divinity of Christ by presenting him as a living man, not a symbol,
and as an object of sexual passion. He said he was particularly
offended by intercutting the figure of Christ into the scene
between the two women.
   ``There is no attempt to flesh the character physically,
metaphysically or spiritually of St. Teresa, who undertakes
movements on the body of the crucified Christ. That is the kernel
of the objection,'' Richard Du Cann, attorney for the board, told
the appeals hearing.
   Geoffrey Robertson, attorney for Axel Ltd., which produced the
video, said the board was only speculating that a court would find
the production blasphemous. He called the video an ``imaginative,
metaphoric'' portrayal of religious ecstasy.
   ``One wonders what is going on, why the board decided to take
this attitude,'' said Andrew Puddephat, director of the National
Council for Civil Liberties.
   Though rarely applied, the blasphemy law has been discussed
frequently in the past year in the controversy over Salman
Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verse,'' which many Moslems charge
blasphemes Islam in its portrayal of the Prophet Mohammed.
   However, Britain's blasphemy law applies only to Christian
religions, and the government has rejected appeals to broaden it.
   Puddephat said he saw no parallel between the controversies over
``Visions of Ecstasy'' and ``The Satanic Verses,'' but he added:
``Sooner or later someone will make it.''
   Stephenson, the producer, told The Independent newspaper that he
thought the film would sell about 200 copies and disappear, and he
had not anticipated any trouble with the censors.
   ``Personally, I object to pornography _ probably more so than
the board,'' said Stephenson, who described himself as a former
devout Roman Catholic.
   ``Our intention was not to offend, to titillate or be
provocative. It was to explore something in our own way. ... The
whole iconography, language and meaning of the Catholic religion
are so bound up with images of blood, pain, suffering and
sacrifice. Those in turn are linked to beauty and eroticism.''
   Marina Warner, who has written scholarly studies of Joan of Arc
and the cult of the Virgin Mary, said that if the video was
blasphemous, it was blasphemous in the same sense as the writings
of Teresa and of St. Catherine of Siena, who both employed
erotically charged images.
   In 1970, they were the first two women to be cited as ``doctors
of the church'' by the Vatican.
   Teresa, born in Avila in 1515, fell into trances and experienced
vivid visions of Christ, Satan and angels.
   Teresa and her visions have long been a subject for art, notably
Gian Lorenzo Bernini's statue ``The Ecstasy of St. Teresa'' in the
chapel of Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome.
   Film has a special problem, Ms. Warner said, because actors are
easily taken to represent real people, and ``the idea of allegory
starts evaporating.''
   Though such imagery might be congenial to 16th-century Spanish
Catholics, Ms. Warner said, it would be anathema to Protestants.
   ``One religion is a blasphemy against another; one sect is a
blasphemy of another,'' she said in an interview.
   ``I thoroughly disapprove of the law of blasphemy, and I think
it should be repealed. I think its divisive, unjust and
capricious.''

   Today is Saturday, Dec. 30, the 364th day of 1989. There is one
day left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On Dec. 30, 1853, the United States bought some 45,000 square
miles of land from Mexico in a deal that became known as the
Gadsden Purchase, for the man who engineered it, James Gadsden. The
area became the southern part of Arizona and New Mexico.
   On this date:
   In 1865, author Rudyard Kipling was born in Bombay, India.
   In 1894, suffragist Amelia Jenks Bloomer died. She had gained
notoriety for wearing in public a short skirt and baggy trousers
that became known as ``bloomers.''
   In 1903, about 600 people died when fire broke out at the
Iroquois Theater in Chicago.
   In 1911, Sun Yat-sen was elected the first president of the
Republic of China after the fall of the Chinese dynasties.
   In 1936, the United Auto Workers union staged its first
``sit-down'' strike, at the Fisher Body Plant No. 1 in Flint, Mich.
   In 1944, King George II of Greece proclaimed a regency to rule
his country, virtually renouncing the throne.
   In 1947, King Michael of Romania agreed to abdicate, but charged
he was being forced off the throne by communists.
   In 1972, the United States halted its heavy bombing of North
Vietnam.
   In 1977, President Carter held the first news conference by an
American president in Eastern Europe as he told reporters in Warsaw
that both Americans and Poles shared the same aspiration for
``complete preservation and enhancement of human rights.''
   In 1978, Ohio State University fired Woody Hayes as football
coach, one day after Hayes punched Clemson University player
Charlie Bauman during the Gator Bowl after Bauman intercepted an
Ohio pass.
   Ten years ago: Broadway composer Richard Rodgers, who had
written the scores for such classics of American theater as ``Pal
Joey,'' ``Oklahoma!'' and ``South Pacific,'' died in New York at
age 77.
   Five years ago: The Madhya Pradesh state government in India
announced it was filing suit in U.S. courts against Union Carbide
following the leak of poison gas at a plant in Bhopal that killed
more than 3,500 people.
   One year ago: President Reagan and President-elect Bush were
subpoenaed to testify as defense witnesses in the pending
Iran-Contra trial of Oliver North. The subpoenas were subsequently
quashed.
   Today's Birthdays: Actress Jeanette Nolan is 78. TV personality
Bert Parks is 75. Actress Jo Van Fleet is 70. Singer Bo Diddley is
61. Actor Jack Lord is 59. Actor John Hillerman is 57. Baseball
hall-of-famer Sandy Koufax is 54. Singer-songwriter Del Shannon is
50. Singer-musician Michael Nesmith is 47. Singer-actress Tracey
Ullman is 30. Runner Ben Johnson is 28.
   Thought for Today: ``Work is a dull thing; you cannot get away
from that. The only agreeable existence is one of idleness, and
that is not, unfortunately, always compatible with continuing to
exist at all.'' _ Rose Macaulay, English poet and essayist
(1881-1958).

<HEAD>Political Pay Raise Deal Will be Hard to Enforce</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In theory, the House has shelved the oldest of
issues _ congressional pay _ with the political pact that is
supposed to keep candidates quiet on the subject next year. In
practice, that's going to be a very difficult deal to enforce.
   A conservative think tank already is denouncing both the raise
and the political pact. Stephen Moore of the Heritage Foundation
said congressional tactics on the pay raise were dictatorial if not
criminal.
   The prospect of loopholes that may yet make the pay raise a 1990
campaign issue does not dismay Republican political strategists,
who signed the campaign truce reluctantly in the first place. They
figure that the pay raise could have been the basic issue for GOP
challengers in their campaign to whittle at the House majority the
Democrats have held for 35 years.
   House leaders of both parties wanted the political truce to open
the way to passage of a cost of living increase next year followed
by a 25 percent raise and a ban on honoraria, both effective in
1991. President Bush wanted what they wanted.
   And attack-minded Republicans couldn't buck that lineup. So
party chairman Lee Atwater swallowed his misgivings and signed away
an issue that cuts against incumbents. The agreement was signed by
the two national party chairmen and by the chairmen of the national
House campaign committees.
   Shelving the issue works to the advantage of House Democrats
because they are the majority, with more incumbents at risk,
although one early application of the truce is said to have been a
reminder to a would-be Democratic challenger for a Republican seat
that the pay raise is not supposed to be used as an issue.
   That's not always going to work, in either party, even if
accompanied by sanctions such as the withholding of money and
manpower the parties customarily supply to their candidates. To
some challengers, the issue is likely to be worth more than the
support, especially when criticism of the pay raise could be
coupled with a denunciation of the national party truce as an
attempt at gag rule.
   One reason the issue will won't die in 1990 is that it will come
up again in the Senate, which shunned the full pay raise and voted
itself a cost of living increase without matching the House ban on
honoraria.
   Another is the newfound clout of the radio talk show hosts and
producers who stirred the outcry against the big pay raise Congress
decided to forgo early in 1989.
   Political use of that episode, notably by Atwater, who sent out
a Republican fundraising letter denouncing the pay raise even
though Ronald Reagan recommended it and President Bush endorsed it,
figured in the negotiations that led to the attempt to keep the
subject out of the 1990 campaign.
   Atwater signed, and there'll be no replay. He plans to observe
the pay raise truce to the letter, but not beyond. He does not feel
bound to monitor or enforce the truce, or to punish GOP challengers
who don't observe it.
   In his Heritage Foundation paper, Moore argues that Congress
should get a raise only if it meets deficit reduction targets.
Otherwise, he said, pay should be frozen or perhaps even cut. ``It
seems inconceivable that any corporation wallowing in billions of
dollars in debt would reward its management with a 40 percent
across-the-board raise,'' Moore says.
   Moore called the raise a bipartisan, midnight raid on the
Treasury, and said if the executive branch of a private business
handled its affairs that way, ``they would be universally denounced
and probably tossed into jail.''
   He said the political truce is even worse. ``In effect, the two
parties are conspiring to choke off any political opposition to the
pay raise,'' Moore said.
   Truce or no truce, complaints like that are likely to rekindle
the pay raise issue and put it on the political agenda next year.

   Darkness comes early on Dec. 21, the
winter solstice.
   But the darkness that fell over Syracuse University last Dec. 21
when students learned 35 homeward-bound classmates had been killed
by a terrorist bomb aboard Pan Am Flight 103 never completely
lifted.
   ``It's getting harder to think about it without it becoming
overwhelming,'' said Ann Lareau, a senior who studied in London
with several of the victims, including her best friend, 20-year-old
Theo Cohen.
   ``This was the time of year we were together there. When we were
starting to talk about the things we were going to do when we got
back,'' said Lareau, who added in a hushed voice: ``I miss them.''
   Donine Carrington, a junior, said not a day goes by that she
doesn't think of her friend, Frederick ``Sandy'' Phillips.
   ``You just don't expect people to die at that age. At that age
you're looking forward to the future,'' she said. ``I guess in time
the pain will diminish, but in my heart it won't start until those
who are responsible are brought to justice. They're not buried with
peace. Their story is not whole.''
   Phillips, Cohen and 33 other students who spent the semester
studying overseas under Syracuse's Division of International
Studies Abroad program were returning home when their Pan Am jumbo
jetliner exploded in the sky over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   The bombing killed all 259 people aboard the jet and 11
residents of Lockerbie, who died when debris from the plane crashed
into the town.
   The bombing cast a pall over the Syracuse campus.
   ``It was oppressive here last spring but those feelings started
to wane over the summer and earlier this semester,'' said Nan
Jensen, the university's religious counseling coordinator. ``But
it's never been forgotten and many students still are having
trouble letting go.''
   For some students, it was days before they could leave their
rooms to go to class, she said. Others immersed themselves in
campaigns for tighter airport security and for travellers' right to
know about terroristic threats as a way to cope with the murders.
   Jensen said attendance at her weekly grief support sessions
picked up as the anniversary drew nearer.
   Kathleen Deters, who coordinates counseling services in the
university's dormitories, said residence hall counselors had not
seen the same increase, but that it was more likely students simply
did not need to see the therapists that work with her office.
   ``I've talked to students and I know they're still dealing with
feelings of loss, but I don't think it's so deep-seeded they need
the kind of counseling we offer,'' she said.
   ``The bombing hasn't been forgotten and I doubt that it ever
will be. Every time this part of the season rolls around it will
come to mind,'' Deters said. ``I think that the students organized
a vigil tells us they still needed an outlet to express themselves
and reflect on it.''
   An interfaith vigil was held Dec. 13 in Hendricks Chapel, where
hundreds of students converged a year ago after the news of the
bombing. A procession of 35 students carrying candles in memory of
the victims and a song composed especially for the victims by
senior Marshall Whinney highlighted the service, which was the day
before final exams started.
   The university is building a memorial wall and has established
scholarships in tribute to the slain students. Syracuse's football
coach, Dick MacPherson, made a goodwill trip to Lockerbie over the
summer and the university's two-time defending national champion
lacrosse team is making a trip in January.
   Twenty-five of the student victims attended Syracuse, while the
remaining 10 were from other schools who traveled abroad as part of
the university's foreign studies program.
   ``They've never been very far from our minds, from my mind,''
said Geri Clark, a drama professor who had taught seven of the
victims. ``I still get a number of students in my office every week
who just want to talk about the bombing or the friends they've
lost. There's a real sense that our numbers have been diminished in
a profound way.''
   Many of her students have taken it upon themselves to contact
the families of the victims they knew, Clark said.
   ``I guess they just don't want them to feel lonely at this time
of year,'' she said.
   While grieving continues to be the most visible legacy,
Hendricks Chapel Dean Richard L. Phillips has witnessed another
effect from the bombing.
   ``There is always some good to be found in the worst of
tragedies,'' he said. ``As a university as a whole, we have become
a more sensitive people because of this tragedy. There is more
reverence for the sanctity of life. People are more caring in their
interpersonal relationships.''
   Phillips said he speaks often to students about the bombing, but
he always tries to focus on the need to reflect on the beauty of
the lives lost.
   ``They were among the best and brightest and we must never
forget that,'' he said, echoing the words delivered by Chancellor
Melvin Eggers during a memorial service last January that drew
15,000 people.
   Lareau, the senior who lost her best friend, said a recent visit
to London, while difficult, helped revive good memories that had
been blocked out the past year. But the effects of the bombing are
mostly negative.
   ``It's a big battle to make friends for me now,'' she said.
``I'm afraid to get close to people. I let them in and it seems
they die.''

   The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 has not
reduced the popularity of Syracuse University's overseas study
program, its director says.
   No one backed out of the International Studies Abroad program
last spring, just after 35 returning students were killed in the
bombing, Nirelle Galson said. A handful of students did switch
flights from an American airline to a foreign one, she said.
   In the just ended semester, about 820 students went abroad to
study, about a 10 percent increase, she said.
   ``We had a number of parents and students call asking about
safety prior to departure, but it seemed they were simply seeking
reassuarances,'' said Galson.
   ``I thought we'd have some downturn in the spring, but it hasn't
happened. But I can't say we wouldn't have had a 20 percent
increase (in participation) if it didn't happen.''

<HEAD>Developing The Savings Habit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Subtle advertising, constant sales, periodic
discounts and rebates, and an abundance of consumer goods helped
make big spenders of many Americans in the decade of the 1980s.
   Now, as if the abundance of choices were insufficient, ordinary
folks are likely to be presented with still another decision in the
1990s: They will be asked to decide between spending and saving.
   It won't be easy after a 15-year addiction to the retail
marketplace, a period in which the subtle arts of marketing, along
with plentiful credit and tax incentives, helped produce a
live-for-now mentality.
   Uncle Sam will be trying to break that habit in the 1990s, and
the government is preparing the first of its incentives, a Family
Savings Account that would allow $5,000 a year to be saved tax-free.
   That's a big incentive, but one many Americans will find
difficult to exploit because, as envisioned, those savings would
lose their tax exemption if not maintained for a decade, an
eternity for those used to immediate gratification.
   In this and other ways the Bush administration hopes to
accomplish two ends: Promote savings, which are necessary for
industrial development and job creation, and spur Americans to seek
greater financial rewards by investing for the long term.
   The consequences are enormous for individuals, the general
economy and government.
   For individuals, saving for the long term rather than immediate
spending might provide the means to buy even more tomorrow.
Investments grow; the value of purchases often falls.
   Money saved generally means a sounder economy, since it is
invested in research and development of plant and equipment that in
turn enhance productive efficiency _ more goods at lower cost _ and
create jobs.
   For government the return might not be immediate. In fact, tax
exemptions can have the short-term effect of reducing revenues. But
over the longer term, a larger, healthier economy inevitably means
an increase in revenues.
   Whether the goals can be accomplished is made uncertain by many
factors. For one thing, the Family Savings Plan would involve a
10-year period of time, an ambitious endeavor in a nation
accustomed to making tax changes each year.
   Individual Retirement Accounts, for example, were originally
meant to spur savings by allowing $2,000 a year to be invested and
deducted from current tax liability. But after several years the
deductibility feature was removed.
   That action, in the opinion of critics, all but emasculated an
otherwise strong incentive to save rather than spend. It probably
left a legacy of doubt about government promised that could impact
the Family Savings Plans.
   However, some of the other tax changes in recent years have been
more in line with the need to save rather than spend. Most consumer
debt, for example, no longer is tax deductible, thus removing at
least one incentive to spending.
   Americans accepted that action with amazing calmness, even
though it proved to be enormously costly to them. However, it
didn't stop them from taking on debt, and in that respect it failed
to make a dent in the buy-now philosophy.
   It leaves this question: If people feel so strongly about buying
that they will pay higher taxes in order to continue buying, will a
program that rewards them for savings instead of buying be any more
successful?

<HEAD>Search for Fish Snags Ties Among Asian and Pacific Nations</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS 27th graf, The U.S. Senate ... on driftnetting., to
make bill pending in House.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With stocks diminishing in their own waters, Asia's
fishing nations are casting for new fishing grounds in a search
that is bringing conflicts with allies and new links with
traditional enemies.
   The issue also has reached the U.S. Congress where senators and
representatives act either for environmental reasons or to assure
plentiful supplies of tuna and salmon for American West Coast
fishermen.
   Much of the conflict, however, is in the South Pacific, where
environmentalists and governments charge that fish stocks are being
wiped out by a sudden wave of Japanese and Taiwanese fishing boats
using giant nets called driftnets.
   Japanese fishing officials say the criticism is another form of
``Japan-bashing'' motivated more by displeasure over Japan's rapid
economic growth than environmental concerns.
   ``We don't want another World War II to occur as a result of the
current situation, but there are people in Japan who now feel
isolated and unfairly treated by the outside world in the same way
that people did before the war,'' said Kiyoshi Katsuyama, a
Fisheries Agency official.
   In recent years, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea have sought
fishing rights in other nations' waters as fish resources have
declined along their own heavily harvested coasts.
   But countries like the United States that once welcomed Asian
fishermen to their relatively unexploited 200-mile economic zones
now have developed their own fishing industries and are limiting
foreign access to stocks that are seen increasingly as a limited
resource.
   ``It's a whole new situation that fisheries is entering,'' said
Ian Kennedy, fisheries officer at New Zealand's embassy in Tokyo.
``There's a definite trend from management not only within 200-mile
limits, but with the high value of migratory species, of fish
migrating outside the limits.''
   In 1981, Japan was allowed to catch about 1.2 million tons of
fish within the United States' 200-mile zone, but its quota was cut
to virtually zero by 1988.
   In their search for fish, some countries are entering deals with
nations they had little to do with before:
   _Companies in anti-communist South Korea have landed deals to
fish in Soviet, Chinese and Vietnamese waters.
   _Taiwanese fishing companies plan to visit the Soviet Union
early in 1990 to explore fishing cooperation, officials say.
   _China has established joint ventures with Nigeria,
Guinea-Bissau, Senegal and Morocco in Africa and plans to increase
its fishing fleet in foreign waters next year from 100 to 120
boats, according to official press reports.
   _Japan is interested in entering joint ventures in Soviet waters
but is waiting for more signs of political stability in Moscow
before deciding, U.S. officials say.
   But increasingly, Asian fishing powers are turning to
international waters for their fish.
   Last season, after Japanese fishing researchers discovered large
supplies of albacore tuna in the South Pacific high seas, Japanese
driftnet boats in the region increased from 20 to 60, and Taiwanese
boats surged to at least 60 and perhaps as many as 130.
   Driftnets, which sweep as much as 30 miles of ocean at once,
consist of a line of nets, each about two miles long, separated
from each other by about a quarter of a mile, Japanese fishing
officials say. The nets, attached to floats, are allowed to drift
until they are picked up later.
   Driftnetting countries say the nets are the only economically
feasible way to fish on the high seas, where fish are less
concentrated than in coastal areas.
   In October, however, Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer of New
Zealand asked the United Nations to ban driftnetting, calling them
``walls of death'' that ``catch and kill, like a vacuum cleaner,
virtually every living creature _ including some endangered species
_ which come in contact with them.''
   In November, 20 South Pacific nations decided to ban driftnets
from their economic zones and urged Japan and Taiwan to agree to a
regional prohibition on the method.
   The two nations agreed to reduce their fleets but refused to
discuss a total ban; Japan called instead for an international
commission to oversee regional fishing stocks.
   ``There's no scientific evidence yet that driftnetting is
damaging fisheries resources, so it's premature to institute a
ban,'' said Kunio Kimura, senior managing director of the Japan
Fisheries Association.
   ``It's true that there is an incidental catch of marine animals
in driftnets,'' said Katsuyama, the Fisheries Agency official.
``But it's a mistake to ban a method because one or 10 are caught.
If the number is too large, then what we need to do is reduce it.''
   Controversy over driftnetting originally began in the North
Pacific, where U.S. salmon fishermen protested poaching by Asian
squid driftnetters.
   Taiwan has acknowledged that violations occurred and, along with
South Korea, has agreed to let U.S. officials inspect driftnet
vessels suspected of illegally catching U.S. fish.
   American officials in Tokyo say that because of the Japanese
government's tough monitoring, they do not believe Japanese
driftnetters now are poaching substantial amounts of U.S. salmon,
despite such charges by members of the U.S. Congress.
   A bill before the U.S. House of Representatives would prohibit
imports of all fish caught with driftnets, while a congressional
subcommittee has given its approval to a bill calling on the Bush
administration to seek an international ban on driftnetting.
   That could be embarrassing to the United States, said an
American official in Tokyo, ``because the U.S. has one of the
biggest driftnet fisheries in the world'' _ for salmon in American
waters near Alaska and elsewhere.
   ``Environmentalists have a bad taste in their mouth regarding
Japan because of its whaling,'' the U.S. official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``There's a sense that if Japan does it, it
must be bad environmentally. But if Japan does change its policy
regarding driftnetting, it could start pointing its finger at us.''

   Tourists can still see the subtle
smile but little else of the Sphinx, the half man, half beast
crouched in the desert sands guarding the pyramids.
   The smile projects above protective scaffolding being erected to
envelop the chest of the ailing 4,600-year-old statue as Egyptian
authorities try yet another remedy for the ills afflicting one of
the world's best-known monuments.
   The effort has surrounded the stoic stone statue with turbaned
workers prying rocks from his massive paws, sticking sensors into
his backside or hammering on the wooden chest girdle.
   Scaffolding first appeared at the Sphinx's right shoulder in the
spring of 1988, shortly after a rock broke off and tumbled to the
ground. More weak spots were discovered, and now the framework is
being extended across the famous frontal view.
   Prime Minister Atef Sedki of Egypt made an official inspection
visit, seeking to determine whether restoration begun in 1982,
which covered the front paws and other portions with concrete
blocks, helped or harmed the Sphinx.
   ``There's no threat to the Sphinx,'' Sedki said after the visit.
But he added: ``Although I'm not a technical man, I can see with my
eyes that former restoration work was wrong.
   ``The government will not deny any financial support that the
new restoration work requires. The important thing is to save the
statue that symbolizes the Egyptian civilization.''
   Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization,
said the latest effort calls for removing all large restoration
stones attached since 1982.
   Restoration was being done on the Sphinx at least 3,000 years
ago. But Tawfik, climbing atop the front paws, said a key
difference in the current project is that for the first time,
restorers will try to ensure that the repaired Sphinx looks like
the Sphinx.
   Earlier restorations in the 1980s, he said, simply coated
endangered areas without regard to the shape the ancients carved.
   ``There's a 10-centimeter (four-inch) difference in the original
shape of the paws and in restoration stones that cover them,''
Tawfik said. ``You can't even imagine how the Sphinx should look. ''
   He said the Egyptian-born artist and sculptor Adam Henein has
been brought from Paris to help restore the body to its original
form.
   ``We're studying hundreds of pictures taken since the middle of
the last century, even when it was almost totally buried, for clues
to how the Sphinx looked,'' he said.
   Concrete blocks have been numbered and are being carried from
the site as smaller replacement stones from the Giza Plateau are
installed. Greeks and Romans restoring the monument more than 2,000
years ago also used small blocks, and Tawfik said their work is
better than any by modern restorers.
   ``Restoration begun in 1982 proved awfully bad because large
stones were used that completely damaged the Sphinx,'' said Zahi
Hawass, director of the pyramids area.
   ``Also, they used cement and gypsum, so now not only are we
looking at bad rock that has always been in the Sphinx but also at
rock that's been damaged from bad restoration.''
   Criticism of the 1980s restoration has been common for years and
the Sphinx has become a political issue as well as a scientific one.
   The latest controversy began in mid-November with stories in
newspapers speculating that mischief felled the chunk of stone from
the Sphinx's right shoulder on Feb. 7, 1988.
   Tawfik and other experts responded by saying scientists studied
the rockfall for a year before deciding it occurred in a section of
limestone weakened by salt, wind and other natural phenomena. The
dispute raged for weeks.
   The Sphinx is likely to have little peace for quite a while.
   ``The Sphinx is like Lebanon, with militias tearing at each
other,'' said Omar el-Arini, a member of the antiquities
organization's scientific committee and a science officer at the
U.S. Embassy.
   ``He's a 50-million-year-old man, because that's how old the
rock is. How do you restore him? Do you rejuvenate him? Do you
treat his ailments?
   ``What's missing here is a general plan.''

<HEAD>Non-Communist Cambodian Guerrillas Face Erosion of Western Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NATE THAYER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SVAY CHEK, Cambodia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodia's non-communist guerrillas
are seeing an erosion of support from the Western world at a time
when they are making significant gains against the
Vietnamese-backed government in Cambodia.
   ``Everywhere in the world the communist system is falling,''
said Gen. Sak Sutsakarn, commander-in-chief of the Khmer People's
National Liberation Front. ``Why won't the world support the
non-communists in Cambodia? Especially Cambodia _ we have suffered
more than anyone.''
   The apparent reason for the diminishing support is a concern
that the non-communists are coordinating their military offensive
with the communist Khmer Rouge, which took power in 1976 and
inflicted a reign of terror on Cambodia that left a million or more
dead.
   The National Liberation Front, the Khmer Rouge and a
non-communist group loyal to Prince Nordom Sihanouk, the former
head of state, have formed a loose alliance that has been waging
war against the Vietnamese and the Cambodian government they
installed in Phnom Penh, the capital, in 1979.
   The coalition, which holds Cambodia's seat in the United
Nations, is largely armed by China, but the two non-communist
factions get U.S. and other Western financial and political support.
   The non-communists still reel from charges of corruption,
internal bickering and being militarily inneffectual. But they have
established better internal discipline over the past two years and,
in recent months, they have shown battlefield prowess.
   In recent weeks, a number of U.S. congressmen have criticized
Washington's support for the non-communists as tantamount to
support for the Khmer Rouge.
   Britain backed away from supporting the non-communists in
November following media reports that the British were training
soldiers ``under the control of Pol Pot,'' the shadowy Khmer Rouge
leader who led Cambodia's terror government until a Vietnamese
ousted him in 1979 after they invaded the country.
   Australia and France have voiced support for leaving Cambodia's
U.N. seat vacant, creating more cracks in what only months ago was
a solid Western bloc of support for the coalition.
   All three groups seek either the downfall of the government of
leader Hun Sen in Phnom Penh or leverage at the negotiating table,
but reporters able to reach battle zones or newly taken towns have
seen no sign of joint military operations between the
non-communists and the Khmer Rouge.
   With the bodies of government soldiers lying in nearby trenches,
National Liberation Front guerrillas celebrated their biggest
victory of the war recently with the capture of Svay Chek, a key
town.
   ``Where are the Khmer Rouge?'' said Gen. Khun Roeng pointing
toward hundreds of his guerrillas on the defense perimeter. ``The
Khmer Rouge are not invited to this party.''
   Resistance leaders acknowledge, however, that they do have field
communication with the Khmer Rouge but solely for reasons of not
getting in the way of each other's attacks.
   The non-communists have seized more than 100 square miles of
territory in northwest Cambodia since launching a general offensive
after Vietnam began withdrawing its last troops from Cambodia in
September.
   ``We have two enemies,'' says Gen. Dien Del, the National
Liberation Front's founder. ``The first is the Vietnamese and then
the Khmer Rouge. The Cambodian people understand that Vietnam wants
to swallow our country, and that is why all patriots have a duty to
work together to save Cambodia. But we are not with the Khmer
Rouge, and the Khmer Rouge knows this very well.''
   He added: ``We need the public support of the Americans. ... We
need to be able to say, `Look, we are backed by the West.'''
   Sak, the commander-in-chief, said: ``What happens to Cambodia if
support for the non-communist resistance stops? The war will
continue between the two communists _ the Khmer Rouge and the Hun
Sen government. There will be no peace, but it guarantees the
future government will be a communist one.''

   Months after their daughter Melina was
killed on Pan Am Flight 103, a notebook she carried was returned to
Paul and Eleanor Hudson. A quote written in the back by the
teen-ager read: ``No one dies unless they're forgotten.''
   The Hudsons have spent much of the past year making sure that
Melina and the 269 other people killed when the jumbo jet was blown
up over Lockerbie, Scotland, last Dec. 21 are not forgotten.
   The organization they started, Families of Pan Am 103-Lockerbie,
takes up a whole room at Hudson's law offices. The room is filled
with evidence of the couple's life this past year: letters to
politicians, transcripts of congressional hearings, news clippings,
lists of victims' families, newsletters, a sketch of Melina.
   Melina's mother says she spends countless hours at the office.
``I'm a teacher by profession, but this is my job. There's a duty
here,'' she said.
   That duty _ to reveal the full story of the Flight 103 bombing _
has taken Hudson, a soft-spoken, well-to-do lawyer, to the halls of
Congress, to Europe and to a private session with President Bush.
   He still has questions.
   Why wasn't the bombing of Flight 103 prevented? Why was his
daughter, coming home for Christmas after a semester abroad in
London, allowed to take a plane with a bomb on it?
   ``We thought, `What do we do now that she died? Do we pretend
that she just died in a drowning?''' Eleanor Hudson said. ``She was
sixteen. She was coming home from Christmas ... What kind of joke
is this?''
   She shows a picture of Melina on the front steps of their Albany
townhouse: she is thin, her blonde hair is swept back and she is
smiling coyly. ``She was beautiful. How could we not do this?''
   Days after the crash, Hudson took Melina's dental records to
Lockerbie for her identification. The Hudsons' dentist told Eleanor
Hudson, who remained in Albany, that another area family who lost a
daughter in the crash, the Hartunians, was unable to get
information from Scotland.
   She spoke to them on Christmas Eve and realized her husband
could help.
   ``They just wanted to know whether their daughter was in a body
bag or in a morgue,'' she said. ``I said, `My husband is there, he
can find out.'''
   The Hudsons met more families at nine funerals and at a memorial
service for the 36 Syracuse University students killed on the
flight. They, too, were frustrated by the State Department's
silence after the crash, Hudson said.
   ``To see nothing but a cloak of silence _ it gave us not only an
angry feeling, but frankly it was very ominous,'' he said.
   ``It was clear to me by the end of January that unless there was
some public outcry, and unless people formally organized, that the
government was going to do nothing,'' he said.
   On Feb. 19, the Families of Pan Am Flight 103-Lockerbie held its
first meeting, in Hasbrouk Heights, N.J.
   The organization is partially a support group. But Hudson, as
chairman, has spearheaded government lobbying asking for an
investigation of the bombing.
   The group is pressing the government to tighten security for
international flights. Hudson contends that if Pan Am had competent
security, the bombing could have been avoided.
   ``We've known (Pan Am's) security was a sham for many months,
and it still is,'' he said. ``It's geared to public relations, not
to effectively stopping bombings.''
   He wants a ban on electronic devices used to hide bombs like the
one in a radio-cassette player that blew up Flight 103. He says
luggage should be searched by hand and all luggage be matched with
passengers.
   He also wants the government to make public all credible threats
made by terrorists concerning international flights.
   Private investigations found the State Department received as
many as four warnings of possible terrorist actions directed at
U.S. air carriers last December, one of them apparently directed at
Flight 103, Hudson said.
   ``They had a lot of intelligence in the case of 103, it's just a
matter of what they did with it,'' he said.
   After extended pressure from families and congressmen, President
Bush appointed a seven-member committee in August to investigate
the crash and draft a report.
   Hudson said that could be the definitive document explaining the
disaster. It is tentatively due on May 1.
   Meanwhile, the Hudsons have gone to Scotland to mark the crime
that has brought them together with dozens of other families. On
Thursday evening in Lockerbie, luminares _ candles stuck in bags of
sand _ are to be lit for each of the 270 victims of Pan Am Flight
103.
   The quiet lawyer and his wife say they refuse to let anyone
forget.
   ``I felt, and I feel, that unless something is done about these
things, we will see hundreds, perhaps thousands of more Americans
coming back in body bags,'' he said.
   ``I have three other children. I don't want to see this happen
again.''

   Tomorrow, for most Christians, becomes Jan. 1,
1900, the end of a decade. Ten years hence marks the end of the
millennium. But hold on a second. Says who? One man's millennium is
another man's humdrum day. The way years get numbered, you see,
depends on who's counting, when they began counting and what
they're counting.

   Repent, brothers and sisters, repent! The millennium is coming.
   Kind of.
   Kind of because this small planet does not, most decidedly, spin
to the same calendar. Worldwide there are at least 40 of them, each
marching to its own drummer.
   But just 10 years from New Year's Day, Christians will rip a
page off the calendar and Saturday 12-31-1999 will become Sunday
1-1-2000, the zeros lined up like cherries in a slot machine, like
a milestone 100,000 miles on the family clunker. (Killjoys say the
millennium really is 1-1-2001 because we count from one, not zero,
so 2000 is really the 10th year of the 1990s. Disregard them).
   But one man's millennium is another's numberless day at the
office. Moslems will uncelebrate the middle of 1420 A.H., Jews 5761
A.M. Ancient Greeks will observe the 694th Olympiad.
   Olympiad?
   The way years get numbered, you see, depends on who's counting,
when they began counting and WHAT they're counting. If you count by
the moon _ Moslems do _ a year is 12 lunar months based on 29 days,
12 hours, 44 minutes and 2.8 seconds from new moon to new moon. The
solar year is about 11 days longer, the 365 days, 5 hours, 48
minutes and 46 seconds it takes Earth to circle the sun. Eventually
by the Moslem calendar it's June in January. But who decided it's
January in January anyway?
   To begin with, the calendar is a convenience to mark the passage
of time. It tells you when it's time to move the sheep into the
hills, when to report for spring training, when to plant cotton,
when to pay bills, when to get married next Saturday and celebrate
the anniversary of such 10 years hence.
   Ancients just chased mastodons whenever they could find them and
didn't worry about dates until they settled down and began planting
crops. For that you had to know seasons. The clock of the heavenly
bodies in their unalterable cycles told them.
   The Egyptians knew the Nile was about to flood when Sirius, the
Dog Star, was on the horizon at sunrise. Plant. Australian
aborigines know it's time to hunt termites when Arcturus is on the
horizon at dawn. Eat.
   The Sumerians and Babylonians, first-rate farmers and no
dummies, had a good calendar. But it was based on the moon and
pretty soon you're planting wheat in December with predictable
results.
   ``The year hath a deficiency,'' would declare Hammurabi, the
great lawgiver, as he threw in an extra month. We call such
doctoring intercalation.
   The Babylonians also invented the week, maybe because seven was
their lucky number, maybe because it conveniently divided the
lunation into quarters. The Jews later reinvented the week based on
the seven days of Creation.
   Somewhere along the line Sunday became the first day because the
sun gave life. Saturday, at week's end, comes from the Roman god
Saturn who presided over old age. Old-time Teutons also named days
for gods such as Wodan, Thor and Fria. Guess what became of them.
   In Yemen the day begins when you can tell a white goat hair from
a black one. Moslems begin a month when holy men first report a
sighting of the new crescent moon. If it's overcast, they wait a
day and start counting again.
   ``The Mursi in southwest Ethiopia spend most of the month
arguing about what day it is. They spend the rest arguing about
what month it is,'' says LeRoy Doggett, editor of the Nautical
Almanac in Washington, D.C.
   ``If you don't have to catch a plane, the date may not really
matter.''
   The Soviets, in the flush of communist creation, tried a
five-day week in 1919, went to six days in 1932 and returned to
tradition in 1941. They also celebrate the October Revolution in
November, which we'll get to.
   The ancient Egyptians switched from the Babylonian moon to a
12-month solar calendar of 30 days each and tagged on five holidays
at year's end. In 238 B.C., Ptolemy III, also no dummy, put in a
leap day after checking with Sirius to make up for the fraction of
a day left over from 365 days in orbit.
   Meanwhile, in Rome, the Romans did as the Romans. Romulus,
co-founder of the city, devised a 10-month calendar of 304 days.
Winter months were ``useless'' and not counted. The year began in
Aprilis, from Latin ``to open,'' at the time of the equinox of
equal night and day.
   Romulus's successor, King Numa, added Januarius and Februarius
and came up with a 12-month calendar of 365 days. Not bad, but
still out of tune, made more so by high priests who were not above
subtracting a month to collect taxes sooner or adding some to
extend friends' terms of office.
   What with one thing or another, by the time of Julius Caesar the
calendar was three months out of phase with the sun. Caesar hired
the Egyptian astronomer Sosigenes. He added three months, just like
that, to 46 B.C. producing a year of 445 days and what justly
became known as ``the year of confusion.''
   This Julian calendar had the requisite 365 days, plus a leap
every third year. Caesar's birth month of Quintilis was renamed in
his honor. Guess where July comes from. Augustus Caesar fine-tuned
things by making leap year every fourth year. In HIS honor the
month of Sextilils was named for him _ by now you must know where
August comes from _ and a day was added to it to make 31 and not be
outshone by 31-day Julius. The Julian calendar was OK but lagged 14
seconds a year or one day every 128 years.
   But which year was it?
   The Romans started counting from Romulus and Remus, year one
being 753 A.U.C. _ anno urbis conditae, the year the city was
founded. The Jews toted up the begats and counted from Creation,
3761 B.C., before Christ to Christians, A.M. _ anno mundi, year of
the world _ to Jews. The Greeks counted in four-year periods _
Olympiads _ starting with 776 B.C. when Coraebus won the first
Olympic foot race. The Japanese counted from the first emperor _
660 B.C. _ and the Chinese from the first year of whatever dynasty
they were in. The Mohammadans weren't there yet.

   This brings us to 1285 A.U.C., which the abbot of Rome,
Dionysius Exiguus, decided after much research was 532 A.D., that
many years since the birth of Christ. Everything else was B.C. even
though, for instance, it was year 146 of the Yuan Wei dynasty in
China. The century before, early Christians at the Council of
Nicaea (1206 A.U.C, 4214 A.M. or 453 A.D.) had pegged Easter to the
spring equinox, as well as Passover, out of respect for Christ's
Jewish origins. This tie-in became important in Christian dogma.
   Enter the Moslems. They began counting from Thursday, July 16,
622 A.D., when Allah directed Mohammed to flee from Mecca. His
successor, Omar, opted for a lunar calendar of 12 alternating
29-and 30-day months for a year of 354 days. Since intercalation
was forbidden, Islam has a lot of movable feasts and fasts. As the
lunar year gains a year on solar about every 32 years, you can
figure a Moslem is a year older if not wiser for every such period.
   In India, astronomers picked up on solar time, but there were a
lot of calendars that kings and rajahs dated for themselves. The
Sivajli Era began, for example, with year one as of June 6, 1674,
when King Maratha was crowned in western India.
   The Era of Parasurama began in 1176 B.C. around Madras but is so
complicated you don't even want to think about it. The Saka
calendar dates from March 3, A.D. 78 when the visible planets were
lined up.
   India had about 17 calendars when it went Gregorian in 1957 when
March 22 became 1 chatra 1879 Saka. There is also a time period of
4,320,000 years in the Hindu religion called the mahayuga, which is
one day in the life of Brahman, god of creation, which makes A.U.C.
look like a split second.
   As Julian time passed, Easter was increasingly out of synch with
equinox-Passover and well on its way to summer. In the 13th century
a worried Roger Bacon in England wrote Pope Clement IV about it.
Nothing happened. The Council of Trent, which began in 1545,
authorized reform.
   Pope Gregory XIII finally sat down with Italian astronomer
Aloisius Lilius and German math whiz Christopher Clavius and
devised a new calendar. Years ending in double zero were only leap
years if they could be divided by 400. That meant the calendar was
only off 26 seconds a year and only one day by the 1420th olympiad,
plus a year of A.D. 4905. Gregory forthwith decreed that Thursday,
Oct. 4, 1582, would be followed by Friday, Oct. 15.
   Catholic nations dutifully complied. Protestants, being
protesters, protested Gregory was trying to confuse Christ's second
coming and wasn't he afraid the world would end sooner? Suspicious,
Britain didn't go Gregorian until Sept. 2, 1752, a Wednesday to be
followed by Thursday the 14th, the Julian calendar then being 11
days out of whack.
   Laborers rioted over lost pay. Landlords screamed about lost
rent. Ben Franklin, cool as ever, counseled his fellow British
subjects to ``lie down in peace on the 2nd and not wake till the
morning of the 14th.'' Which they did. As usual, time healed all
wounds, including George Washington's, who, since Gregory moved New
Year's from March 25 to January 1, was now born in 1732 instead of
1731, thus becoming a year younger.
   The Russians stuck with Julius Caesar until after the Bolshevik
Revolution, hence the October parade in November. Alaska lost 12
days when it changed hands from the czar to the United States in
1867, but life went on.
   For some reason, revolutionaries seem to take it out on the
calendar. For a time American redhots dated from their rebellion
against England. The French Revolution all but guillotined the
calendar, abolishing Sunday with a 10-day week. The new calendar
had 12 30-day months poetically named, e.g. Floreal (``blossom
month'') and Vendemaire (``vintage month''). The last five days of
the year were named ``sans cullotides'' (without pantaloons) in
honor of the Paris freedom fighters of the barricades who couldn't
afford aristocratic knickers. Napoleon went Gregorian again in 1805.
   Not that Gregory's work is ideal. ``Untidy,'' says Doggett.
   Gregory's year can't be divided into handy halves and quarters,
upsetting finicky accountants. Dates keep falling on different
days. The Western Clock Co. of La Salle, Ill., decided in 1892 to
go its own bookkeeping way with a regular quarterly calendar. By
1950, 1,062 companies in the United States and Canada had followed
suit.
   One suggested reform is for 13 months of 28 days each. Each year
would begin Sunday and end Saturday, followed by a Year Day. People
born Jan. 29, for example, would blow out the candles Feb. 1. In
all, 94 days would have to be moved.
   In 1930, Elisabeth Achelis, an American, proposed a World
Calendar of even quarters moving only eight days and making the
same date recur on the same day every year, adding leap year at the
end of June and putting a year day at the end that would not be
Sunday or anything else. The United Nations has mulled it over, but
Seventh Day Adventists and Orthodox Jews object to the
disappearance of a sabbath.
   Then there's the Earth herself. In A.D. 1654, James Ussher,
archbishop of the Church of England, delved into assorted Old
Testaments and astronomical works and decided time began when
Creation did: 9 a.m. Oct. 4, 4004 B.C. By this reckoning 1-1-2000
or even 1-1-2001 aren't millennia at all. It's just 6004.
   But Earth, like a proper dowager, is coy about her age.
Scientists know sometimes she spins slower, sometimes faster. They
don't know why. Several hours have been lost in the past 3,000
years.
   What's official, however, is that in just 10 years your
insurance company's Gregorian calendar will end in 000. That means
Earth will have embarked on her 2,000th orbit around the sun since
Dionysius Exiguus's year zero. (A lot of people have claimed
Exiguus was four years off about A.D.-B.C., but they were too late,
so to speak).
   Whether purists deign to salute 2000 with a toot or two remains
to be seen. To many Mayans in the crowd, it will be a humdrum
5113th year for those crackerjack astronomers. The Japanese will
toast 2660. Indians will celebrate Saka 1922. Romulus may wish
Remus a prosperous 2573 A.U.C.
   To the rest of you, happy millennium.

   Barrie Kavasch's Saturday night dinner
parties in the mid-'60s were notorious among her neighbors.
   At a time when most suburbanites were ``Mastering the Art of
French Cooking,'' with boeuf bourguignon and chocolate mousse, the
unassuming housewife and mother of two was stunning guests with
dandelion fritters and smoked eel stew.
   While many Americans were cooking French, Kavasch was cooking
American. Native American. Her platters of fried squash blossoms,
nasturtium salad and conch stew ``could utterly astonish even the
most sophisticated people,'' she recalls.
   Not anymore.
   Today, many of the same foods that once confounded Barrie
Kavasch's neighbors are showing up on some of the trendiest menus
at some of the hottest restaurants in the country.
   And Kavasch is in great demand as a teacher and lecturer; she's
as apt to be baking pumpkins and frying cornpones at museums,
universities and cooking schools as in her Bridgewater kitchen.
   In February, she'll team up with a chef at the Harvard Club in
New York to produce a five-course American Indian dinner for 300
distinguished guests. In May, she'll prepare a similar banquet for
culinary historians in Boston.
   Having spent much of her life a somewhat solitary booster of
American Indian foods, Kavasch, who is not of Indian heritage,
suddenly finds herself with lots of company. Though still far from
mainstream, Indian foods are enjoying a renaissance amid a national
passion for Southwestern and Cajun dishes and a growing concern
over diet and health.
   ``There's more acceptance that people should eat high
carbohydrates, more grains and more vegetables,'' says Mark Miller,
owner and chef at the much-heralded Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe, N.M.
   ``If you look at diets made up of grains and complex
carbohydrates that will take us right back into Indian food,'' adds
Miller, whose Indian-influenced creations include wild tumbleweeds
with grilled venison and dried cherry-chili sauce. His new
cookbook, ``Coyote Cafe,'' due out in January, is sprinkled with
American Indian legends and poetry.
   At the Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas, another culinary
landmark, chef Dean Fearing's offerings include grilled game with
cornpones and wild rice sauce, and Texas antelope stew on posole
tortillas.
   At Arizona 206 in New York, former executive chef Brendan Walsh
had diners lining up for a taste of the Southwest in the Big Apple,
with corn flour pastas and pumpkin seed sauces.
   ``Southwestern food _ especially New Mexican food _ is probably
60 percent Indian-influenced and 40 percent Spanish,'' says Jane
Butel, a former New Mexico home economist whose ``Tex-Mex
Cookbook'' helped launch the craze a decade ago.
   While most people are quick to recognize the Spanish element,
they are far less aware of the Indian influence, adds Butel, who
recently opened a traditional New Mexican restaurant, Pecos River
Cafe, in New York.
   That's not surprising, says Jack Weatherford, an associate
professor of anthropology at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn.
``There's a tendency to want to emphasize European heritage and
minimize native heritage,'' he says.
   ``European food is prestige food. We simply don't value American
Indian foods enough,'' adds Weatherford, who traced Indian
contributions to medicine, agriculture, cooking and other areas of
modern life. His resulting book, ``Indian Givers,'' will be
published by Ballantine Books in January.
   While most people are aware of the origins of corn, beans,
squash, pumpkin and turkey, they tend not to know Indians also gave
the world guacamole, tomatoes, potatoes, tortillas, tacos and
tamales, Weatherford says.
   Few people think about Indians while eating lobster, oysters,
scallops, clams and roe, not to mention smoked salmon, fried
catfish and clam chowder. Barbecue was an Indian invention, as were
tomato sauce, clambakes, Brunswick stew, crab cakes, baked beans,
maple syrup, baked apples and cranberry sauce.
   ``Most regional American cuisines stand on an Indian base,''
says Weatherford. Consider the liberal use of maple syrup, seafood
and beans in the Northeast; hominy, grits, sweet potatoes and
pecans in the South; and red beans, cayenne pepper, file and
crayfish in Cajun and creole dishes.
   Though the latter are often associated more with French than
Indian cooks, he says, ``these foods are no more French than tacos
and tamales are Spanish. Creole and Cajun foods came to us via the
mixture of people who incorporated French, blacks and Indians into
their heritage. The resulting food is primarily Indian, secondarily
black, and only tangentially French.''
   Sixty percent of foods grown in the world today came from North
and South American Indians, Weatherford says. ``The American Indian
larder contained a tremendous variety of foods. The Indians of the
Andes produced more types of crops than all the farmers of Europe
and Asia combined.
   ``And a recent report by the Academy of Sciences identified 70
fruits, vegetables and grains we never use in this country that
would be appropriate for use.''
   Quinoa, an ancient grain that once grew wild in North America,
is being reintroduced. With the highest protein content of any
grain, quinoa, now grown experimentally in the Rockies, can be used
as a wheat substitute for flour, pasta and other products.
   Though slightly less nutritious, amaranth, also grown in the
West, is still higher in protein than all European grains, and is
being sold ground or as a cereal. Chef Miller recently experimented
with amaranth in making tamales and found them ``earthier, with a
stronger grain flavor'' than their corn counterparts.

   While some chefs dismiss Indian food as dull, Weatherford
disagrees. ``Some of this is extremely sophisticated food. I think
of guacamole, for example, as a very subtle, refined dish.''
   Miller, an anthropology graduate student before becoming a chef,
agrees. The high level of aesthetics in other American Indian art
forms indicates a highly evolved cuisine, he says.
   Unfortunately, Kavasch says, ``Indian cuisine has been
trivialized. American Indian food is so unsung and misconstrued and
put down. In fact, it's as exotic as oysters and roe and smoked
salmon. There is no more colorful or unique ethnic cuisine.''
   Kavasch, whose ``Native Harvests'' was published in 1977, is
writing a new cookbook, with Dale Carson of Madison, who is Indian.
She also is working, with American Indians and food scientists, on
a line of snack foods made from wild produce.
   In her early years in Bridgewater, Kavasch's cooking wasn't the
only thing that set her apart.
   ``I treated my kids with natural remedies, resorting to
antibiotics and other prescription medicines only when necessary,''
she says. ``I've always been into farming and gardening and I've
always valued self-sufficiency.''
   She grew up during the 1940s and '50s with an appreciation for
natural things and respect for self-sufficiency rare in an era of
processed convenience foods. But on her grandparents' 100-acre farm
in Tennessee, ``We bought nothing canned. We dried and canned
everything we needed, and there was no such thing as garbage.
Everything had a use. There was great dignity in it.''
   She still forages on her land in northwestern Connecticut for
black walnuts, wild mushrooms and onion grass, and grows much of
her own produce in a carefully tended garden.
   It was her lifelong interest in health that led her to study
ethnobotany, ways in which Indians used plants to create medicines,
preservatives, heating and building materials and other goods.
   Her path led on to food and nutrition.
   ``Indians could tramp all day on a pocketful of parched corn,
the ancestor of Cracker Jacks, and outdistance the Europeans,'' she
says. ``Scientists have discovered they were taller than Europeans,
with stronger bones and teeth and longer life expectancies.''
   Clearly, the Indian way of eating held lessons for modern
society. ``Earlier people had an intrinsic sense of wellness. They
saw certain food as preventive medicine, eaten for greater mental
health and vigor.
   ``Unfortunately, information about cuisine was not passed on.
The accounts that exist were usually from a white perspective,
reflecting men's outlook on things done by women.''
   Recipes in ``Native Harvests'' are based on accounts by trappers
and missionaries, conversations with American Indians, and camping
trips during which Kavasch lived off wild foods.
   One treasured recipe came from a Catawba Indian from North
Carolina, who told her of a corn and peach soup made by his mother.
``I worked on it for years. He would come to visit and taste my
latest attempt, and I would send him pictures.
   ``It took years. When I finally got it right, he took a mouthful
and burst into tears,'' recalls Kavasch, whose own eyes fill with
tears at the memory.
   In keeping with historical accuracy, she used no salt or dairy
products in ``Native Harvests.'' But in the interest of
palatability, she says she'll probably use them in her new book.
   Among writers of American Indian cookbooks, the debate between
authenticity and taste is an old one.
   Though admirable, ``accuracy doesn't sell,'' says Jean Anderson,
whose 16 cookbooks include ``The Art of American Indian Cooking.''
   ``The big problem with Indian cooking is it's heavily adapted
for the American kitchen. You can't say, `Run out and gather the
salmon spawn.' Ladies will say `yuck.'''
   In developing recipes for her 1965 cookbook, ``we took the
things we felt would be most appealing and tried to make them into
something a lady in Garden City, Kansas, would prepare and her
family would like,'' Anderson says. ``We got dinged.''
   Los Angeles food photograper Lois Ellen Frank, the granddaughter
of a Kiowa Indian, also chose accessibility over authenticity in
``Native American Cuisine,'' due out next fall.
   She says she kept the minuscule metropolitan kitchen rather than
the open fire in mind in developing recipes for such dishes as
rabbit rolled in blue corn meal and broiled with wild mint, or
venison steaks with juniper berry and red chili sauce.
   ``When you think about it, everything's adapted, whether it's
how to make pasta or what is Southwest cuisine,'' Frank says.
``Does that ruin it? I don't think so.''

   Come take a ride on a New York subway with a
conductor who likes to entertain his passengers with funny
announcements at each station stop. Harry Nugent, the son of a
circus barker, says he wants o reassure the riders that they
haven't left civilization behind when they walk down the subway
stairs.

   The No. 1 Broadway local is packed, but the
subway can't leave the station. It can't leave the station because
the train's doors can't close. The doors can't close because some
idiot is holding them open for a late arrival on the platform.
   This is bad enough, but the passengers must now brace for an
accompanying sonic assault _ the obligatory conductor's admonition
over the public address system, always delivered in harsh, loud New
Yawkese:
   ``STANCLEARADACLOSINDOORS.''
   But instead, this morning they are surprised to hear:
   ``Your heart's in the right place, but your foot isn't. If you
don't want to ride, just step onto the platform. You'll find it's
quite stationary.''
   This message is delivered not as a rebuke, but as a gentle
reminder, and the speaker's voice is smooth and soothing, like that
of a professional broadcaster from the old school.
   The impression _ and the hope _ that this will not be the usual
subway trip is confirmed at the next stop.
   ``This is Rector Street, well-positioned in the financial
district. Rub shoulders with the Stock Exchangers, but stand clear
of the closing doors. This is the No. 1 to Van Cortlandt Park.''
   The conductor is Harry Nugent, who has raised station-stop
announcements to an art and introduced a measure of civility into a
subterranean realm that could use it.
   Nugent, 60, is a pleasant man with a neat moustache and receding
hairline who manages to look natty in the standard blue Transit
Authority uniform and cap.
   Imaginative announcements break the tedium, he explains. But he
also wants passengers to feel they haven't left civilization merely
by walking down a flight of stairs.
   ``This is Franklin Street, TriBeCa in location, litigious in
concept and convenient to an eclectic collection of courthouses.
Franklin will be followed by Canal as we make our way to Van
Cortlandt Park.''
   How did a guy who talks like this get into subway conducting?
   Nugent says he spent 15 years at Look magazine ``basically as a
gofer with a nice office on the 16th floor.'' When the magazine
folded he became a conductor because, he says with a smile, ``I
didn't want to get out of communications.'' Then he adds: ``It was
a port in a storm.'' That was 17 years ago.
   ``Now we're entering 14th Street Station. If you think you'd
like to change into something else, you can slip into a 2 or a 3
train. Speaking of numbers, we're the 1 to Van Cortlandt Park.''
   Before leaving the train, a middle-aged man carrying a briefcase
walks up to Nugent and tells him, ``If the rest of the Transit
Authority was as competent as you, they'd have no problems.''
   A well-dressed woman asks Nugent for his name, which she writes
down in a notebook. She seems reluctant to get off at her stop.
   ``We're approaching 23rd Street, which puts its best foot
forward with the illustrious Chelsea Hotel. Its other foot isn't
bad either _ the Flatiron Building. The next stop we encounter will
be 28th Street.''
   Nugent says he began to embellish his announcements about eight
years ago, when the Transit Authority was trying to get conductors
to give passengers more information _ a process that was abetted by
the arrival of new trains with audible public address systems.
   Nugent had spent a lot of time between stops thinking about what
to say. ``At first I just wanted to break the hostility with a few
elegant announcements. But the point I'm at now is probably absurd.
Maybe I've been breathing too much steel dust down here.''
   ``Our stop is 28th Street, noted for its flora and fauna. It's
the site of the flower district and the fur district. Twenty-eighth
will be followed by 33rd. That's the way it is on the No. 1 local.''
   Perhaps the steel dust is taking effect.

   ``This is 34th Street. How does it serve us? Let me count the
ways: Penn Station, the Long Island Railroad, Amtrak, Madison
Square Garden and much else. Times Square is next on our quest for
Van Cortlandt Park.
   Nugent regularly gets applause, cheers, flowers and thank-you
notes. A homeless woman told him, ``You've given me 40 minutes of
happiness.'' A punk rocker said he dug his rap. One man obtained
Nugent's schedule and began planning his trips accordingly.
Sometimes tourists throw money into his conductor's booth. ``They
think I'm some sort of street performer,'' he complains.
   ``This is Times Square, a station that celebrates transfers _ to
the 2, 3 and 7, the N and R, the Grand Central Shuttle. Up one
track and down the other _ not one dull or idle moment.''
   That line comes from Nugent's father, who ran away from home as
a boy to join the circus, and went on to become a magician,
puppeteer and side-show barker. Sometimes he feels like a pitchman
himself, a tout for 38 stations.
   ``Our station is 50th Street. It's several blocks from
Rockefeller Center, but you can walk there if you have a yen for
it.''
   Nugent often slips in references to current events, in this case
the sale of a majority interest in Rockefeller Center to a Japanese
corporation. But you have to be careful, he says, because people
don't pay their $1 to be offended.
   ``We're arriving at 96th Street. Here we have a parting of the
ways with our running mates, the 2 and the 3, so it's your last
chance to transfer. Heading our way? Perhaps we should join forces.
We're the 1 to Van Cortlandt Park.''
   Nugent's conducting has opened doors for himself, too, including
offers to perform on radio and in nightclubs. He passed on the
former _ his line has 38 stations, and he's on all of them. As for
stand-up comedy, he asks, ``How would I get the train in a club?''
   The problem with notoriety is that people now expect the unusual
from Nugent. ``One day I was just making standard announcements,
nothing special, and a guy came up and said, `What's wrong? I
brought my wife to hear you.'''
   ``This is 110th Street, also known as Central Park North and
Cathedral Parkway. Does a street with three names sound magical? No
surprise. Harry Houdini used to get off here. If you just joined
us, we're going uptown to Van Cortlandt Park.''
   Some riders ask Nugent if the voice they hear is a tape
recording. He tells them, ``Yes, I'm state-of-the-art.'' Others,
who assume they've been listening to the motorman in the front of
the train, tell Nugent, ``He's great!''
   ``He's happy to hear that,'' the conductor responds.
   ``We're at 215th Street, a station that is gradually winning
acceptance from the newly erected Allen Pavilion of Presbyterin
Hospital.''
   Nugent stole that line from Bob and Ray; he often twists the
language's logic, as when he says that the 79th Street station is
``cleverly arranged to be only two blocks from the Museum of
Natural History.''
   His routine also includes an assortment of puns. Sixty-sixth
Street station serves ``the medley of theaters known in concert as
Lincoln Center.'' When the train emerges from the tunnel and runs
on elevated tracks after 116th Street, he says, ``You may get the
impression we're gaining altitude, but we never rise above our
station.''
   ``Our next stop will be 225th Street in the Bronx. We're now
crossing the Broadway Bridge, the bridge they put the Harlem River
under. If you look west, you'll see one of our better views.''
   Nugent would like a new audience _ ``I thought I'd have died by
now on this line'' _ and the chance to talk about other stations.
But he plans to stick to the Broadway line until he retires,
because its northern terminal is near his home in Yonkers, just
over the city line. It also has the best trains _ and the best PA
systems.
   ``This is 242nd Street, Van Cortlandt Park, the gateway to
Westchester County. Here, our journey usually draws to a
conclusion. But that's fine, because we've run out of track. We'd
like to thank you for riding the No. 1. Have a good day.''

   Remember when it seemed everybody was jabbering
away on CB radios out on the highway, including Betty ``First
Mama'' Ford? It was a fad that peaked in the mid-1970s, then hit
the skids. But now sales of citizens band radios are on the upswing
again, industry officials say, but not to people who just want to
chitchat.

   Breaker, breaker, one-nine.
   CB radios, a craze during the gasoline crisis of the 1970s, are
making a comeback, largely because of increased sales to motorists
who want a way to summon help in case of breakdowns or accidents.
   Industry spokesmen say citizens band radios appeal to women,
retirees and young people who do not want to pay hundreds of
dollars for a cellular telephone.
   ``It's not a boom, but it's a nice, steady, gradual increase,''
says John Chass, vice president of marketing for Midland
International Corp., a major supplier of the radios in Kansas City,
Mo. ``The preponderance of customers we've surveyed are using the
CB for emergency use. They don't buy a CB to talk 24 hours a day.
They buy a CB for a perceived problem with their vehicle.''
   Chass says emergency radios account for 37 percent of all CB
sales, 22 percent of all CB buyers are women and 30 percent of the
male CB purchasers say they are buying them for women.
   Emergency CBs are small hand-held units costing $30 to $60 that
have the power of larger radios. They plug into cigarette lighters,
use antennae with magnetic bases and can be stowed in the trunk
with the jack and spare tire when not in use.
   ``The market is coming back,'' says Tony Margoulas, a marketing
information representative for Tandy Corp., a major supplier of CB
radios through its nationwide network of Radio Shack stores.
   CB sales peaked at about 11 million a year in 1975 and 1976 as a
result of the Arab oil embargo. Motorists used them to share
information on dwindling gasoline supplies, high prices and long
lines at service stations.
   In the process, Americans became fascinated with the nation's
long-haul truckers who had been using the radios for years to warn
of ``Smokey Bears'' and maintain human contact during lonely trips
that kept them away from home for weeks.
   Chass says sales plummeted to 800,000 units a year by 1980, but
began picking up about five years ago. An industry publication says
sales jumped from 1.6 million in 1984 to 2.2 million last year.
   Tom Lauterback, spokesman for the Washington-based Electronic
Industries Association, says emergency radios have become popular
with young, fairly affluent motorists who want to be able to get
help on the road.
   ``They provide a tremendous amount of peace of mind at an
affordable price,'' Lauterback says. ``If you have a flat tire or a
mechanical breakdown between towns, you can summon a trucker to
help you, or at least report it when he gets to the next town.''
   Ron Mayes, general manager of React International Inc., a
12,000-member group that uses CBs and other radios to assist
motorists and maintain communications during emergencies, says
studies show that emergency vehicles can reach an accident about 20
minutes faster when the trouble is reported by CB radio. React's
700 teams in the United States and Canada and many police
departments monitor channel 9, the official CB emergency channel.
   ``If there is a serious injury, 20 minutes is a significant
amount of time,'' Mayes noted during a phone interview from React's
headquarters in Wichita, Kan. ``We would like to see more
monitoring of channel 9 by police departments and volunteer groups.
We know that if they did, more people would utilize CB 9 for
emergencies and in general the traveling public would be safer.''
   Most CB radios have 40 channels, but the majority of routine
highway information is relayed on channel 19, a popular frequency
for truckers. The Federal Communications Commission no longer
requires a CB license, but users need to learn the truckers' jargon
to do much talking or listening. CBs have a range of 5 to 15 miles,
depending on terrain, weather conditions and antenna.
   ``Once you learn to understand all that gibberish, you can tune
in to what they're saying,'' Margoulas said in an interview from
Tandy's headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas.
   Rather than names, CBers use ``handles,'' such as
``Roadrunner,'' ``Six Pack,'' ``Double Clutch,'' ``Candy Man,''
``Old Timer,'' ``Night Rider'' and ``Alabama Slim.''
   Before transmitting it's polite to ask for a ``break.''
   A ``bird dog'' is a radar detector. ``My bird dog is barking''
means there's police radar in the area. Police who use radar are
``taking pictures.''
   A ``Smokey Bear'' is a state trooper, a ``county mounty'' is a
deputy sheriff and a ``city kitty'' is a city cop.
   A ``chicken coop'' is a weigh station, a trucking terminal is a
``junkyard'' and ``the big road'' is an interstate highway.
Automobiles and pickups are known as ``four wheelers,'' and car
carriers are known as ``portable parking lots.''
   A ``footwarmer'' or ``kicker'' is an illegal linear amplifier
that boosts the transmission power of a CB beyond 4 watts.
   Besides their communications value, CBs also provide a source of
entertainment and help break the monotony on long drives.
   Keith Urban, a marketing director with Dynascan Corp., a Chicago
company that sells Cobra CBs, says cellular telephones are helping
to fuel the comeback. Young people who don't want to pay $300 for a
cellular phone can buy a CB for less than $100 and talk to friends.
   Urban says CBs are still important to the nation's 1 million
commercial truck drivers, despite the advent of cellular phones and
small computers that allow truckers to communicate with their
companies by satellite.
   ``They spend long hours on the road,'' he said. ``They don't
listen to it all the time, but when they get bored they know they
can flip on their radio and talk to the guy in front of them.''
   Trucker Roy Carden of Albany uses his CB to locate delivery
points in strange towns, to get help if he has a breakdown and to
talk to other drivers.
   ``I think everybody who is on the road a lot ought to have a
CB,'' says Carden, who goes by the handle ``Wild Man.''

   Jamie Lee Curtis bucked the trend by going
into television on the heels of a hit motion picture.
   Curtis, after starring in ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' is now
starring with Richard Lewis in the ABC comedy series ``Anything But
Love.''
   ``I got involved in this show before `Wanda' and it actually got
picked up because of the success of `Wanda,''' Curtis says. ``After
`Wanda' I did `Blue Steel.' ABC then picked up this show after
passing on it before and re-tooled the concept.''
   She had her reasons for wanting to switch to television. ``When
you have a child your needs become very immediate to take care of
that child,'' she says. ``You want stability in your life and no
traveling.''
   Curtis, the daughter of actor Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, is
married to actor Christopher Guest. They adopted a daughter, Annie,
in 1987 and that led to adopting the less-hectic schedule of
television production to have more time for her family.
   ``The hours on a film can be deadly,'' she says. ``You have to
surrender your life for 12 weeks or more when you do a film. But on
a TV comedy series the hours are quite workable. You can have a
professional life and a personal life at the same time.''
   In ``Anything But Love,'' Curtis plays Hannah Miller, who gave
up teaching school to pursue her dream of becoming a writer. She
lands a job on the stylish Chicago Weekly magazine with the aid of
writer Marty Gold, played by Lewis.
   Are they just friends, or will it get more serious than that?
The comedy comes out of the sexual tension.
   ``The original concept, which ABC passed on, was a romantic
triangle between myself and two men,'' says Curtis as she walks
from the stage to the commissary at 20th Century Fox Studios, where
the comedy series is filmed. ``She has a secure but not very
exciting relationship with a solid guy. Then an old boyfriend shows
up. It was the most passionate and exciting sexual relationship
she'd ever had. Was she going to go with the solid guy or the
dangerous guy?
   ``The part that worked was Richard as the rock-solid guy and
that's what they kept. But, how long can you keep them at arm's
length. Experience shows that you can't not bring them together
because the audience demands it. After that you have a cooling off
period and a feeling the story is over once they go to bed.''
   That was one of the things that brought the downfall of
``Moonlighting.'' Once Maddie and David went to bed, the stories
went downhill.
   Curtis goes through the cafeteria line and picks out a salad.
She settles at a table in a deserted corner of the commissary.
She's wearing faded jeans and a jacket and no makeup.
   ``Our characters are not cool and aloof,'' she says. ``Richard
and I offer more menschy characters. They aren't sexual barterers.
They don't use sex as a duel. They're afraid of what sex might do
to their wonderful relationship. They've barely kissed.
   ``Last year, we didn't know what direction we were going in.
Then Peter Noel took over the show. His philosophy is that they are
best friends and should never come together. I don't know what the
pressures will be to make it a sexual relationship.''
   It's the first series for Curtis since ``Operation Petticoat''
in 1977, when she first began and had a small role as one of the
nurses. It was adapted from the 1959 movie starring Cary Grant and
her father.
   Soon after ``Operation Petticoat,'' Curtis was in ``Halloween,''
the first of a series of horror movies that earned her the
sobriquet of ``scream queen.'' But she also had roles in such
pictures as ``Trading Places,'' ``Perfect,'' ``Amazing Grace and
Chuck,'' ``A Man in Love'' and ``Dominic and Eugene.''
   Her TV movies included ``She's in the Army Now'' and ``Dorothy
Stratton: Death of a Centerfold.'' She did a comedy pilot a few
years ago, in which she played a sort of female version of Indiana
Jones. It wasn't picked up as a series.
   In ``Blue Steel,'' she plays a rookie policewoman who is accused
of a crime her first week on the job and is fired. She has to find
the killer to prove her innocence.
   ``I never want to say never to films,'' she says. ``I did this
work in the series and it satisfies my needs as an actor. I didn't
take it so I could then go off and do films. I came from films. But
if something good comes along I may take advantage of it.''
   Her husband was formerly on NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' and
starred in the movies ``This Is Spinal Tap'' and ``The Princess
Bride.''
   ``I saw his picture in a magazine and called his agent,'' she
says. ``He didn't call me back, but we ran into each other soon
afterward by chance. We married five months later.''

   What's that sweet Karate Kid doing now? He's
changing his image in a big way.
   Actor Ralph Macchio, who played the title role in three ``Karate
Kid'' movies, is on stage playing a character so nasty that when
another character knocks him out with a bucket of ice, the audience
cheers. The play, at off-Broadway's Westside Arts Theater, is
``Only Kidding!'', set in the world of stand-up comedy.
   Macchio did New York theater once before, in 1986, in ``Cuba and
his Teddy Bear,'' which he calls ``probably the most exciting
moment of my career.'' It opened off-Broadway and moved to
Broadway. One big attraction for him was playing Robert DeNiro's
son.
   This time the big attraction is a chance to change his image.
The Karate Kid brought Macchio to the public's attention. ``But it
has made it difficult in trying to prove myself as something other
than that character,'' he says. ``I've got my work cut out.'' He
says that casting directors are apt to think ``angelic guys'' when
they think of Ralph Macchio.
   ``This is a step to chopping through that wall.''
   Sitting on the set of ``Only Kidding!'', looking younger than
his 28 years and wearing the wedding ring he takes off before
playing an unmarried young comedian, Macchio says: ``I do not
complain. Things could be a heck of a lot worse. Sometimes I think
there isn't a better thing that could have happened (getting the
Karate Kid part) and at times I feel there isn't a tougher thing
that could have happened.''
   In ``Only Kidding!'' Macchio is half of a young, struggling
comedy team. Then he breaks with his partner, and ties up with a
mob-connected manager for whom sleazy would be a compliment. In Act
2, he arrives, famous and stoned, for a television talk show. He
demands that an older, making-a-comeback comedian be bumped from
the program. But righteousness prevails, and Macchio's character
gets chilled out with a bucket of ice. And the older comic gets his
chance. Curtain.
   Paul Provenza, who played the part when ``Only Kidding!'' opened
in April, had been a stand-up comedian. Macchio's career began in
movies, in ``Up the Academy'' in 1980. ``I've never done stand-up
comedy, not outside of my own house. I always expressed a sense of
humor. Or attempted to.
   ``I'm learning it as I go. Being with this cast is like doing
stand-up comedy, even backstage. You've got to keep up with them,
especially being the new kid on the block.''
   The role came up, Macchio says, after he told his agent he was
interested in doing a play. ``I said I didn't want to be 17 again.
I didn't want to be a student of a mentor, or such a nice guy.
   ``He said Paul was leaving this show. My wife and I came to see
it. I had a great time. Initially I was going to say I couldn't do
it. Paul was so perfect. We're different types. Did I want to fill
in for somebody else?''
   He saw it again and decided the play was timely, as comedy clubs
more than rock clubs are ``an '80s thing.'' He figured it would be
a challenge. He started in mid-November.
   ``I've seen characters like the one I play, sad to say,'' he
says. ``They'll do anything, step over their mother, to have a
chance at `The Johnny Carson Show.' They have the fear that the
laughs won't be there. Or when the laughs are there, it's all in
life that matters.
   ``That's the gist of the guy I play. Desperate is the key word.
Tragic also.
   ``When you first meet him, he is offensive in certain things.
But he seems like a likable guy. He is so desperate and so afraid,
he does so many offensive things, he becomes quite loathsome.
   ``When I'm playing the scenes, as nasty as he gets, as hurtful
and angry, there is something about him I like. I feel bad for him.
When he is out there, when I say those lines, I'm believing him.
   ``It is exciting to play a role like that, to be cheered against
as opposed to always being cheered for.''
   Macchio grew up on Long Island, learning to tap-dance, enjoying
school plays and talent contests. ``My mouth was always going.''
   Macchio's wife of 2{ years is a nurse. They make their home on
Long Island. He lived in Los Angeles for 18 months while shooting
the ``Eight Is Enough'' TV series.
   His first noteworthy movie part was as an abused kid in ``The
Outsiders,'' directed by Francis Ford Coppola in 1983. Patrick
Swayze, Emilio Estevez, Matt Dillon, Rob Lowe and Tom Cruise also
were in the cast.
   Macchio didn't expect the following year's ``The Karate Kid'' to
be a hit. ``I thought it was too corny,'' he says. ``Some of the
scenes were just so sweet. That's why I'm not a studio head.''
   After his current stint among the stand-up comedians of ``Only
Kidding!'' he'd like to make another film. ``I think that would be
the right move,'' he says. ``I'm rummaging, trying to find one that
would be best to do.''

<HEAD>Plague of Strikes Brings Chaos to Daily Life in Lima</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A string of strikes by public workers has
disrupted Peru's already battered economy and brought chaos to the
daily lives of thousands of people.
   Prisoners who complete terms can't get out of jail. Bodies stack
up in the morgue waiting for autopsies. Mail piles up undelivered
in post offices. Taxes are uncollected. Hospital patients must wait
for treatment.
   ``The crisis in the public sector is an expression of the
economic chaos that exists in the country,'' said Carlos Morales,
an independent labor analyst.
   Hundreds of thousands of government workers have walked off
their jobs to demand gargantuan pay raises to offset the loss in
the purchasing power of their salaries caused by Peru's
hyperinflation, running at nearly 3,000 percent annually.
   Not wanting to fuel inflation, the government has resisted the
workers' demands, approving wage increases that fall short of the
inflation rate.
   A mountain of 5 million letters sits in Lima's central post
office waiting to be sorted and delivered as postal workers walk
the picket lines.
   A walkout by workers at the National Tax Administration office
has reduced tax collections by 70 percent.
   A strike by prison workers has delayed paperwork authorizing the
release of prisoners who have served out their terms. The director
of Peru's department of prisons, Wilder Vidal, said recently that
more than 900 convicts whose sentences have lapsed remain behind
bars.
   Teachers, bus drivers, water and sewer workers and gravediggers
are all on strike.
   Even prostitutes from the nearby port of Callao took to the
streets recently to demand a reduction in the 50 percent tax they
are required to pay to a city government starved for revenue to
meet escalating costs.
   A sign in the emergency room at Casimiro Ulloa hospital asks the
``understanding of patients and injured'' who cannot be attended
because of a strike by hospital workers, including doctors.
   The strike in public hospitals has had grave consequences for
the poor, who cannot afford private clinics.
   Josefina Quispe said she tried to take her father, a street
vendor, to a state hospital when he complained of kidney pains,
apparently caused by complications from a kidney operation months
earlier.
   ``A doctor told me to take him home to die,'' Ms. Quispe said.
   Her father died at home, without medical attention.
   The common denominator in all the strikes, some of which have
resulted in bloody street clashes with riot police, is a demand for
higher pay to help workers deal with the inflation.
   ``On average, government salaries have 15 percent of the
purchasing power they had in 1973, and 35 percent of what they had
before September 1988,'' the magazine Analisis Laboral said
recently.
   The average monthly salary for public employees is 753,012 intis
_ $50. Government studies say the minimum income a family of five
needs to buy basic necessities is the equivalent of $213, or 10
times the minimum wage of $21.
   The economic crisis also has provoked the most dramatic fall in
the gross national product in Peru's history. The economy has
shrunk by 14 percent so far this year, following a 9 percent drop
in 1988.
   With public services paralyzed, some entrepreneurs have been
quick to see an opportunity in the chaos. They have created private
ventures to offer alternatives to public services.
   At least six private mail services have started up, some
offering guaranteed, four-day delivery to the United States at
prices ranging from $1.50 to $7 a letter.
   ``It's very simple,'' said a worker at Giant Express, one of the
new mail services. ``So we don't have to charge as much as
door-to-door courier services, we take the letters and send them to
Miami with an airline, and from there we send them on by regular
mail.''
   The company also brings mail into the country, a service many
have used since the U.S. postal service stopped delivering to Peru
in October because of the strike, which began Sept. 14.
   ``Business is booming, and we have increased our deliveries
tenfold,'' said the Giant Express worker.
   Morales, the labor analyst, predicted the strikes will continue
as long as the country's economic slide goes unchecked. He and
others blame a bloated bureaucracy for much of the economic
troubles.
   They say the excessive number of bureaucrats, numbering more
than 1 million in a nation of 21 million people, are an
unproductive drain on the government.
   One who shares that view is the novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, the
front-running candidate for the presidency in April's election.
Vargas Llosa is running on a platform of free-work economic
policies. He is pledging to reduce the government bureaucracy and
``shift'' thousands of state workers to the private sector.
   President Alan Garcia, a populist ineligible for re-election,
has tried to maintain the little political support he still enjoys
by accusing Vargas Llosa of planning to fire half a million
workers, a charge the candidate denies.

<HEAD>Christmas Eve in Japan Becoming a Time for Romance</HEAD>

   Christmas Eve is becoming a time for lovers in
Japan.
   While people in other countries attach bows to packages, more
and more Japanese young people hope to tie a marital knot on
Christmas Eve _ or at least seal a relationship.
   Hotels are packed with couples who pay about the yen equivalent
of $315 a person for dinner shows and Christmas Eve together;
cruise ships are booked months ahead for $360 overnight cruises in
Tokyo Bay.
   Behind the relentless commercialism and repeated refrains of
``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,'' the Japanese have taken
Christmas and made it into something uniquely their own, as they
have with countless other imported products and customs. Japan,
where the vast majority of people practice Shintoism, has about 1.7
million Christians among its 121 million people.
   On Valentine's Day, women do the giving, declaring their love by
presenting their men with chocolates, but for Christmas, men are
advised by magazines and TV programs to plan a Christmas Eve that
will win a woman's heart.
   ``It's a test for a man, whether he can provide the right
luxuries for one day,'' said the weekly magazine SPA.
   The Christmas Eve tradition for decades in the Japanese home has
been for the father to bring home a cake, frequently after a night
out drinking.
   Cake sales remain twice as high in December as in any other
month, but they are falling as Christmas customs change, according
to the Japan Western Confectionery Association.
   ``In the past, Christmas for most people meant Christmas cakes,
but now people are beginning to celebrate Christmas in other ways _
with parties and presents and family activities,'' the
association's Kenji Nagao said.
   But the custom has left a bittersweet legacy: the term ``unsold
Christmas cake'' often is used to describe unmarried women over age
25.
   ``Twenty years ago, Christmas Eve was a time for men to go to
bars and get drunk; there would be drunk men all over the Ginza
wearing silly hats,'' said Masaki Oka, sales planning manager for
Matsuya department store. ``But now Ginza bars are virtually empty
on Christmas Eve and it's becoming a family holiday.
   ``People now are interested in the personal touch, creating a
warm family experience together.''
   A custom much older than Christmas in Japan is the giving of
year-end presents called ``oseibo.''
   ``Christmas presents are completely different from oseibo,'' Oka
said. ``Oseibo gifts are given out of business obligation, and
people think only about how much they need to spend on each person
when they shop. But Christmas gifts are a chance to pick out a
present that you think will make someone happy.''
   Many of those gifts men give are presented before Christmas as a
way of enticing a woman to accept a date on Christmas Eve; at
least, that's the advice in an 80-page article on Christmas Eve
dating in the biweekly men's magazine Hot Dog.
   According to the magazine's survey of young women, 38 percent
said they made their Christmas Eve plans a month ahead.
   Spending Christmas Eve together is seen as a public declaration
of a relationship, and for those not ready to make a commitment or
afraid of being left at home alone, some groups of friends make
plans together for Dec. 24 far in advance and then make sure their
other friends know.
   It hardly seems to matter that so few Japanese are Christians,
though Hot Dog magazine recommends a visit to a romantic chapel as
part of a Christmas Eve date.
   ``A good idea is to pray together quietly with your
girlfriend,'' it says. ``Do it somewhere fashionable. Your
relationship will quickly become more intimate.''
   Years ago, the minister of a Christian church in Tokyo said he
was putting up Christmas decorations when a passerby stopped and
asked: ``Oh, do you Christians celebrate Christmas, too?''

   This was the presidency as a perpetual motion machine _ except
that critics said Bush was dragging his athletic shoes when it came
to governing. By year's end, he still hadn't filled some important
jobs in his administration.
   Bush declared war on drugs, and Colombian drug barons declared
war on their own government. ``Narco-terrorists,'' they were
called. By year's end, both wars were stalemates, at best.
   In Virginia, the old capital of the confederacy, L. Douglas
Wilder became the first black person to be elected governor of a
U.S. state. New York City, Seattle and New Haven, Conn., elected
their first black mayors.
   ``We passed another milestone on freedom's road,'' Mayor-elect
David Dinkins of New York said in his victory speech. But the road
contained familiar detours and roadblocks.
   Racial violence raged for three days in Miami's black Overtown
neighborhood after a black motorcyclist was shot to death by a
Colombian-born policeman. In New York, a black youth went into a
white neighborhood to buy a car; he was surrounded by a white gang
and shot to death. When blacks marched through the neighborhood to
protest the killing, they were jeered.
   ``My son will never turn this corner again and it's only because
of this _ the pigment of his skin,'' said Moses Stewart, father of
the slain youth. ``This is what America has to learn _ that we no
longer are going to take this.''
   America learned something else in 1989 _ a lesson about the
price of progress.
   At 12:28 a.m. on March 24, Capt. Joseph Hazelwood picked up the
microphone on the radio of his ship, the Exxon Valdez, and called
the Coast Guard in the harbor town of Valdez, Alaska.
   ``We've fetched hard aground,'' Hazelwood said. ``We're leaking
oil.''
   The light of dawn showed that the worst oil spill in U.S.
history, almost 11 million gallons of thick crude oil, had begun
tarring the pristine shoreline of Prince William Sound.
   Hurricane Hugo's fuel was wind and water.
   The vicious storm rampaged through the Caribbean, leaving more
than 30 people dead, and reached the U.S. mainland Sept. 21 at
Charleston, S.C., where it flattened historic buildings with 135
mph winds and spun on devastatingly through the Carolinas and
Virginia. In all, 29 people died on the mainland.
   ``We're going to be a long time digging out of this and
rebuilding,'' South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell said.
   The same could be said of the San Francisco Bay area, where the
biggest earthquake since 1906 killed 67 people and rang up $7
billion in damage.
   The quake was tragic, but it also brought forth the resiliency
and compassion of ordinary people. Just moments after the Nimitz
Freeway collapsed in a poor section of Oakland, residents clambered
into the wreckage to search for survivors. Similar tales of heroism
were written throughout the quake-damaged region.
   The Sunday after the quake, the Rev. Joseph M. Powers of
Oakland's St. Francis de Sales Cathedral held services in a Baptist
church _ his cathedral was too badly damaged to be used.
   Powers' message could stand as a sort of epitaph for the quake,
and maybe for the year.
   ``Sometimes in life,'' he said, ``God shakes us and says, `Pay
attention.' There is something more important than the ordinary
things in our lives.''

   ``Valmont''
   
   Filmmakers seem to have a love affair with Choderlos de Laclos'
1782 epistolary novel, ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses.'' And with his
story of seduction, hedonism and revenge in 18th century France,
it's no surprise.
   The work was first interpreted on film by Roger Vadim in 1959.
It starred Gerard Phillipe and Jeanne Moreau as Vicomte de Valmont
and his wife, Juliette, two icy, modern-day opportunists with an
``open marriage.'' It had a jazzy score by Thelonius Monk and Jack
Murray.
   The second movie version was last year's ``Dangerous Liaisons,''
an Americanized, fast-paced drama directed by Stephen Frears and
starring Glenn Close as the scheming Marquise de Merteuil and John
Malkovich as the notorious rake Valmont.
   Now comes Milos Forman with ``Valmont,'' and it is as different
from the other efforts as the many interpretations of William
Shakespeare's ``Hamlet.'' It is a lush and elegant movie, graced by
the seductive camera work of Miroslav Ondricek.
   With a keen eye for detail _ cheese wrapped in leaves in the
market, a bathtub with a little bench on which to sit, Forman eases
into de Laclos' story against the blind morals of prerevolutionary
France. His vision is sweeping _ there's no rush but still much
activity. Forman loves the bustle and business of earlier times _
jugglers, merchants, servants always underfoot.
   As Madame de Merteuil, Annette Bening brings a sugary
bitchiness. She is less brittle than the Glenn Close interpretation
and also less focused. But her intent is clear: She loves playing
games, wicked, vicious games that ultimately destroy people and
bring ruin to a way of life.
   Colin Firth's Valmont is far more attractive than Malkovich's.
Indeed, one wondered why women would ever be drawn to the Malkovich
character, with his pasty visage and deep-set eyes, and Bronx
sounding voice.
   Firth is almost too cute, almost too soft. He's sexy, sensual,
flirty. But the steely maliciousness is missing.
   Meg Tilly, who is about to emerge as a leading actress with her
role in ``Valmont'' and her upcoming part as Harvey Keitel's
unfaithful wife in ``The Two Jakes,'' is convincing as the
vulnerable and pious young wife Madame de Tourvel. She is the woman
Valmont worships and for whom he lusts.
   Fairuza Balk, who starred in the horrendous ``Return to Oz,''
portrays Cecile, the target of Valmont's seduction and the innocent
victim of Merteuil's revenge. Her mother has arranged for the
convent school girl to marry Gercourt, an older man who will take
only a virgin as his wife. He's also Merteuil's ex-lover.
   Forman dances his characters about in a game of musical beds, a
game that's a no-win for just about all.
   Jean-Claude Carriere's screenplay makes good use of de Laclos'
focus on letter writing. Letters show up just about everywhere and
even Valmont gets into the spirit by dictating erotic passages to
an unsuspecting Cecile to send to the young music teacher (Henry
Thomas) who loves her.
   Forman's denouement is almost anti-climatic. The duel and
Valmont's death is almost a mirthful moment. But ``Valmont'' is
worth watching.
   The Orion Pictures release has a running time of 134 minutes and
is rated R.

   ``Enemies, a Love Story''
   
   Herman Broder, who's never really been a faithful husband, leads
what he thinks is a fairly uncomplicated and acceptable life: He
has a wife in Brooklyn and a mistress in the Bronx.
   But when his first wife, whom he had thought was dead, suddenly
shows up, his ``uncomplicated'' life becomes a shambles.
   Paul Mazursky has adapted a novel by Isaac Bashevis Singer and
crafted it into a richly told human drama, ``Enemies, a Love
Story.'' It's a tale filled with irony, humor, joy, tragedy set in
the world of Holocaust survivors in New York, 1949.
   Herman (Ron Silver) survived the war by hiding in a hayloft. His
family's former servant, Yadwiga (Margaret Sophie Stein), cared for
him. What's a lad to do after the war? He marries her and brings
her to America _ Coney Island, U.S.A.
   Yadwiga exists to be the perfect wife (slave). She polishes his
bedroom slippers, practices Judaism so she can convert, never
questions his many trips out of town to sell encyclopedias.
   The trips are to the Bronx home of his hot lover, Masha (Lena
Olin). Theirs is a passionate and totally physical arrangement,
despite the presence of Masha's mother.
   Herman can't live without Masha so he marries her. He feels
obligated to Yadwiga and remains married to her as well.
   But Tamara (Anjelica Huston) is another story.
   Crippled by the Nazi bullets she took in her hip at a death
camp, Tamara is the woman who bore his children, the woman who is
all-woman and who knows him best. Her independence and humor about
his current situation drive him up a wall. Still, he does not want
to lose her.
   Mazursky's touch is masterful. He pulls just the right
performances from his ensemble with little effort, and retains the
integrity of each character. His camera is not judgmental. If
anything, it acts as an understanding lover.
   Huston is marvelous: She's strong, witty, vulnerable but
independent, sexy, knowing, charming and bitchy. Her accent is a
little irritating at times, but soon is obscured by an excellent
piece of acting.
   Olin, who so impressed with her role as one of the passionate
lovers in ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' gives a stunning
and moving performance as the troubled Masha.
   Stein is a Polish stage and screen actress who makes her
American movie debut with ``Enemies.'' She lends a tender grace to
the simple adoring peasant woman, and emerges a strong film
presence.
   Silver does most of his acting with expressions and moves.
Herman is a man who harbors many ghosts and who, like many who
survived the Nazis, is deeply scarred by history. It's what he
doesn't say, what he doesn't do that tells us who he is.
   ``Enemies, a Love Story,'' is a deeply felt testament to any
survivor at any time, and its universality is in its ability to
caress the humanity and joy of everyday life.
   The Morgan Creek production for 20th Century Fox is rated R.

   ``License to Kill'' (CBS-Fox Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98. Rated
PG-13)
   
   Bond _ James Bond _ is a grim figure in ``Licence to Kill,'' in
which the secret agent takes on a murderous Latin drug lord in
Florida and Latin America. While earlier 007 films offered a sly,
roguish charmer given to jaunty double entrendres, ``Licence to
Kill'' serves up a moody, humorless Bond.
   Which is to say, no Bond at all. Bond, played by Timothy Dalton
in his second 007 film, is upstaged this time by the gadgetry and
special effects.
   Worse, not even the villain lives up to the usual standards.
While previous villains were often megalomaniacs who wanted nothing
less than the entire world, Sanchez _ played with reptilian charm
by pockmarked Robert Davi _ is a bad guy of almost real-life
proportions. He's not much worse than some of the drug lords making
headlines these days.
   In place of Bond, ``Licence to Kill'' offers lots of violence,
including a few gruesomely creative ways to die, and the usual
fiendish weapons, as unveiled by gadget scientist Q.
   Davi is so believable that his character comes off as
conventional. Talisa Soto is perfectly wooden as Sanchez's _ and
later Bond's _ love interest, and Carey Lowell plays an agent whose
most alluring quality is the way she keeps her gun in a thigh
garter.
   But without a compelling Bond, ``License to Kill'' rarely rises
above the level of a good episode of ``Miami Vice.''

   ``Road House'' (MGM-UA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R)
   
   The Double Deuce is a down and dirty bar where the low-rent
patrons mix it up at the slightest provocation, a toilet of a place
so mean that someone hits a blind guitarist in the face with a
bottle. Then comes Dalton (Patrick Swayze).
   Dalton _ a bouncer with fists of steel, Zen-like calm and a
philosophy degree from New York University _ weeds out the
undesirables among his bouncers, schools them in self-restraint and
has the place looking like a yuppie nightspot in no time.
   But in doing so he runs afoul of Brad Wesley, a high-class thug
who bleeds local merchants for protection money and at one point
flips a coin to decide who will live and who will die.
   This is a violent tale as simple-minded as a comic book, and
this bouncer-with-a-brain stuff is a little much.
   But ``Road House'' is packed with action and rollicks along to a
rip-roaring ending.
   Swayze (``Dirty Dancing'') gets the job done as a sort of
next-generation, shirtless Clint Eastwood, playing a squinty-eyed
loner from out of town who takes on the local bully. Ben Gazzara is
a stylishly evil Wesley.
   ``Road House.'' See it in the safety of your own home.

   ``Dr. Feelgood'' (Elektra) _ Motley Crue
   
   Rx for feeling good? Send for Motley Crue's ``Dr. Feelgood.''
   Produced by Bob Rock, who just wrapped the Cult's ``Sonic
Temple,'' the fifth album from heavy metal vaudevillians Motley
Crue has something for everyone.
   If you're mulling over the current political disarray in the
world, there's ``Time to Change,'' the musically sappy but
lyrically stinging closing ballad.
   If you like things a bit more playful, there's ``Sticky Sweet,''
``She Goes Down'' and ``Same Old Situation (S.O.S.).''
   But the wittiest, most Aerosmith-like of these is the
down-in-the-bayou groove of ``Slice of Your Pie,'' a two-part tale
of lead singer Vince Neil leering at a female passer-by, then
getting her where he wants her via the closing grind, a steal from
the Beatles' ``I Want You (She's So Heavy).''
   Numbers such as the barroom stomp of ``Rattlesnake Shake'' and
the near-speed metal of ``Kickstart My Heart'' show off the new and
improved musicianship of guitarist Mick Mars and bassist Nikki
Sixx, who both leave behind most of the usual metal riffs they used
in 1987's ``Girls, Girls, Girls.''
   Standouts are the title track, a tale of urban blight as seen
through a drug kingpin's rise and fall, and the dark ``Without
You,'' written by Sixx for drummer Tommy Lee and his actress wife,
Heather Locklear.
   The latter, praising monogamy, is a nice break from the
relentless barrage of the sex songs on ``Feelgood,'' and the
mushiness of recent power ballads such as Warrant's ``Heaven.''
   If you want Aerosmith, buy their latest, ``Pump,'' but the
closest thing on the Motley's record is ``Don't Go Away Mad (Just
Go Away).'' It's a breakup song with a smart attitude, despite the
ending that strains to use the cute title.

<HEAD>The Artists: David Retropsective Ends Bicentennial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France ends a hectic year of bicentennial
celebrations with an immense retrospective of the works of
Jacques-Louis David, the painter who put his genius to the service
of politics _ and ultimately, his own ambition.
   On show through Feb. 12 in the Louvre are 245 paintings,
sketches and drawings by the man whose artwork and career reflect
the turbulent and bloody events of 200 years ago.
   ``The Oath of the Jeu de Paume'' and ``The Distribution of the
Eagles,'' monumental works too fragile to be moved, can be seen at
the Palace of Versailles.
   Few French artists were as problematic as David, who emerges
from history as hungry for power as the successive dictators he
served. He was chief propagandist of the revolution and later the
premier painter of Napoleon Bonaparte. After the emperor's fall,
David fled to Belgium where he lived until his death, too proud to
ask for a pardon from the restored Bourbon monarchy.
   His remains came home to France on Dec. 19 for a proper and
official burial in the Pere Lachaise cemetery in Paris.
   ``This is both a symbol of Franco-Belgian friendship as well as
a tribute to the man whose life and work were wedded to history,''
French culture minister Jack Lang said.
   A political propagandist, the artist immortalized such
revolutionary heroes as Jean-Paul Marat, whom he depicted dead in a
bathtub, and Joseph Bara, the young boy bayonetted for refusing to
salute the king and who cried ``Vive la Republique'' instead.
   More than any other artist, David's work recounted the events of
his day as they happened. ``The Coronation of the Emperor and the
Empress'' (1805-07) looks much like a modern-day news photo,
despite the fact that David painted himself into the spectator's
gallery and added Napoleon's mother when she was absent.
   In his private life, David was ruthless. Hated and loved, feared
and respected, he had few friends and confided in no one. Some say
he was plain cold-blooded. As a member of the Committee of General
Security, he signed many arrest warrants, sending some of his own
artist colleagues to the guillotine.
   Though he escaped death after Robespierre's fall, he did spend
some time in jail where he produced two of his most fascinating
works, a haunting self-portrait and the huge painting ``The Sabine
Women.''
   Inspired by a true-to-life historical event, David depicts the
ancient Sabine women thrusting themselves and their babies between
battling Romans and Sabine men.
   Often interpreted as an appeal for national reconciliation in
war-torn France, David wrote, ``That was my thought when I grabbed
the paintbrush.''
   Critics agree that modern art begins with David. An unparalled
draftsman and master of color, he abandonned the flowery,
decorative styles of his predecessors and embraced simple
structures and forms borrowed from classical painting and sculpture.
   His embrace of classical themes _ the result of a five-year stay
in Rome, in 1775-80 _ was interpreted in many different ways. For
Robespierre and his revolutionary followers, David was a precursor
of the values they invoked to justify the Reign of Terror.
   David's ``The Lictors Bringing Back to Brutus the Bodies of His
Sons'' (1789), characterized by Brutus' icy stoicism, was often
cited as a perfect example of the personal sacrifice necessary for
the overall good of the nation. The work, in fact, was a royal
commission and had nothing to do with the revolution.
   A gifted portraitist, David also immortalized the coquettish and
beautiful Juliette Recamier reclining on her day bed, and Napoleon
astride his rearing white horse crossing the St. Bernard Pass.
   He even flaunted the strict rules of the Academy to which he
belonged, depicting his subjects on huge canvasses normally
reserved for historical tableaux or religious themes.
   Visitors familiar with David's work will be surprised to see the
number of portraits David never finished, including the famed
Madame Recamier, because he often quarreled with his subjects.

<HEAD>Music Makers: A Punk by Any Other Name</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gavin Friday is a punk. His hair isn't spiked,
his clothes aren't torn and his music might seem too sophisticated.
But still, he's a punk. Punk is an attitude, Friday insists.
Worrying about looks and sound runs against everything punk stands
for. And, according to Friday, punks were around long before Johnny
Rotten picked up a microphone and screamed. That means Oscar Wilde,
Jacques Brel and Bob Dylan are punks, too.
   ``When I was 17, around 1976-77, I shaved my head and became a
punk,'' explained the 30-year-old Irish singer-songwriter, who
named his new album, ``Each Man Kills the Things He Loves,'' after
a Wilde poem. ``It was great for a while, but the media made it all
fashion.
   ``The whole message was if you have something to say, say it.
Get up on the stage and say it. That was the best thing about punk.
You don't have to practice your guitar for six years, just get up
and try.''
   Friday admires writers such as Wilde and Bertolt Brecht, who
used humor and irony to coat stinging social satire. In that
spirit, the album's title track sounds like a demented vaudeville
tune. The music rolls and crashes like a ferris wheel sprung from
its girders, like a merry-go-round speeding out of control.
   The lyrics are sung gleefully, your worst nightmare delivered
with the warmth of a Christmas carol.
   ``I really just relate to the words in my own way and put the
melody to the way I felt it should be,'' he said in an interview.
``The words are really dark, but I didn't want to sing them like
that. I wanted a circus type of feel.''
   He never sounds happier than on Dylan's ``Death Is Not the
End.'' Cheer up, he sings, no matter how bad life gets, death is
not the end. Change the lyrics to an advertisement for deodorant,
and you might never know the difference.
   ``It interests me how people don't read that much anymore in
general, and I wonder if people listen to lyrics in songs. I did it
singsong so pople will join in. Then they think, `Hey, what am I
singing? What are those words?' That element really attracts me.
Like life is cabaret, no problems, right? Uh, uh.''
   Friday grew up in Dublin, the eldest boy of six children in a
strict Roman Catholic household. It didn't take long to rebel. By
age 10, he was a rock 'n' roll fanatic and hung out with kids who
felt the same way, such as young Paul Hewson, the future Bono Vox
of U2 fame.
   ``We were kids that related to music and we thought we were
God's gift to the world,'' Friday said. ``Every kid thinks he's
special. You're heading into puberty and you don't know who you
are. Everyone misunderstands you.
   ``You're thinking, `Leave me alone, I want to grow up,' and
music becomes your best friend. I loved Marc Bolan, Roxy Music and
David Bowie. I thought I was the only man in the world who felt
that way. It's weird when you find other people like that.''
   Bono got mad and got rich. Friday got mad and stayed mad. His
first band, ``The Virgin Prunes,'' was harsh, even by punk
standards. Critics loved them, but popularity was out of the
question. Eventually, Friday lost patience as well.
   He was tired of the punk scene. All that sound and fury was
boring him. So he began listening to Brecht and Kurt Weill and
looked for a collaborator with a classical background who could
help arrange the music. In 1986, Friday found his man in Maurice
Roycroft, nicknamed ``The Man Seezer.''
   ``He had studied theology and philosophy, worked in a choir and
studied cello and piano since he was four,'' Friday said.
   ``It was inspiration with all these idiots you work with who are
trying to do what (Jimi) Hendrix did 20 years ago, or Bowie, or U2.
He was into Brecht and Weill. It was like chalk and cheese. He was
so focused, I had to push him out, and he tried to pull me in.''
   For Friday, punk is a universal language. Classical musicians
are welcome, so are 19th century poets. Emotion matters more than
form or content. That's why Friday covers Brel's ``Next,'' using a
punk's disgust to practically spit out the French composer's
tortured lyrics.
   ``It's angry, really angry: `Don't ever be next.' `Don't ever
stand in line for those guys.' `Be your own person.' I saw him
(Brel) on video doing this in French in about 1984. I couldn't
understand a word he said, but ... I knew what he was talking
about.''

<TEXT>
   Rien Poortvliet lives in a rustic house in the
tiny Dutch village of Soestduinen. On a recent walk, the author
found a chestnut on the ground and began kicking it ahead of him.
After losing the first chestnut, he quickly found another and
continued.
   He's no better when it comes to sleep. Anything less than seven
hours and he's miserable the next day. Away from home, he dreams of
lying on his new, firm mattress, with his four dogs snoring by the
bed and the window open so he can hear the owls over a cool, night
breeze.
   Some might consider this behavior immature or childish.
   Childish? Poortvliet happily agrees.
   ``My friend, Wil (author Huygen), has said, `When you have the
child in your heart, be careful to keep it there, not to lose it,''
said Poortvliet, who collaborated with Huygen on the best-selling
children's book ``Gnomes'' and the new ``The Book of the Sandman''
($17.95, Abrams).
   ``When making books or drawings, I do have the child in my
heart,'' he said. ``I don't want to let that part of myself get
away.''
   American author Delia Ephron lives in a house in Los Angeles.
She was once childish, she admits. As a kid, she hated coming
downstairs when her parents invited friends over; Ephron was 25
years old before she actually threw a party of her own.
   But she's changed now. She would certainly never kick a chestnut
_ that, she says, would be impolite. Ephron has a more
sophisticated way of relaxing: She makes up tests for her nieces
and nephews, impromptu multiple choice exams on etiquette for all
occasions.
   For instance, you're at a restaurant and the waiter brings you
soup. You're about to eat when you notice there's a fly in it. Do
you: A. Swat it. B. Eat it. C. Say to the waiter, ``Excuse me, but
a fly is swimming in my soup.''
   The kids always laugh, Ephron says, and her nieces proudly
provide the right answer (the nephews proudly give the wrong one).
``Aunt Delia,'' as she calls herself in her work, believes a comedy
of manners works better than drama.
   ``It's such a great way to teach manners without ever really
teaching manners,'' said Ephron, whose newest book, ``Do I Have to
Say Hello?'' ($14.95, Viking), includes pages of offbeat quizzes.
   ``I think of children as uncivilized and that's what I love the
most about them,'' she said. ``I wrote this as much to write about
what they really do than to teach them the right thing to do.''
   Ephron seemed born to write, although not necessarily for
children. One sister, Nora, is the author of ``Heartburn'' and
wrote the screenplay for ``When Harry Met Sally ...''; another
sister, Hallie, is a novelist.
   Delia Ephron had been at work for about a year when she dashed
off ``How to Eat Like a Child,'' a short piece that was published
in 1979. ``Aunt Delia'' had arrived.
   ``I was very nervous about being a writer because everyone in my
family was a writer,'' said Ephron, now collaborating with Nora on
the screenplay for the Meg Wolitzer novel, ``This Is Your Life.''
   ``One day I wrote this piece and very quickly wrote it. I didn't
think I was writing a book for children. I was writing an adult
book; the original piece was written in the New York Times. I was
absolutely shocked when kids thought it was funny. I suddenly knew
that this was what I knew how to do,'' she said.
   Poortvliet, on the other hand, had been an artist for years in
an advertising agency, but happily gave up his comfortable salary
in the early 1970s for the chance to illustrate children's books.
   He speaks not only of the gift for writing, but the gift of
writing. Sharing with a child ``The Book of the Sandman,'' and
earlier works such as ``Gnomes'' and ``Noah's Ark,'' is like
pulling up a chair and carefully explaining a remarkable adventure.
   ``Making children's books does not mean making childish
drawings,'' he said. ``For all my books, `Dogs' or `Noah's Ark,' I
use my drawings to tell and to show, `Come here and look how
elegant a doe can jump over a fence.'''
   Ephron also insists that writing, especially for children,
requires a special generosity of spirit.
   ``I wasn't someone who wanted to be around children, but I do
think there's an emotional connection that you make,'' she said.
``It's more than thinking like a child, it's some sort of emotional
understanding of childhood.
   ``I think what you're going to write as a creative person is
pretty well set by the time you're 14. It's about who you are and
your take on life, something that sets in when you're very young.''
   While ``Do I Have to Say Hello?'' can be read anywhere _ the
dinner table (with the parents' permission, of course), the
playground, the car _ ``The Book of the Sandman'' is very much a
bedtime book, to be cuddled like a favorite stuffed animal.
   ``It starts with the teddy bear in bed and the feeling of that
cozy, warm teddy bear,'' Poortvliet said. ``And I believe that's
the work of those books, they do the same like the teddy bear
does.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Delta Blues Shot With Rock Riffs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHERA GROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's called ``Snake music'' _ Delta
blues shot through with rock riffs and punchy drumming.
   And if the drummer gives the beat a soulful touch, it's because
he once played for Aretha Franklin.
   The band is the Snakes, who have released their self-titled
debut album amid comparisons to the Fabulous Thunderbirds. The
group, composed of veteran recording session musicians, plays a
tight mix of original and reworked blues and rock 'n' roll tunes.
   The connection to the Fabulous Thunderbirds doesn't end with the
sound. Snakes pianist Wally Wilson co-wrote the Thunderbirds' hit
``Powerful Stuff,'' featured in the soundtrack for the movie
``Cocktail.''
   Wilson, who is also a veteran country music and rock songwriter,
says the band didn't plan for the new LP to sound like the
Thunderbirds, but he likes the comparison.
   The album contains Snakes' versions of two songs by the late
blues legends Robert Johnson and Bukka White: Johnson's ``32-20''
and White's ``Aberdeen,'' a marriage of acoustic Delta blues and
hard-edged rock. It also features ``Walkaway,'' heard on the
soundtrack for the movie ``Major League.''
   Perhaps the most unusual tune on the LP is ``Pay Bo Diddley,'' a
humorous but scathing look at how the famous rock 'n' roll pioneer
was cheated out of royalties by smooth talking record company
executives.
   Wilson persuaded Diddley to come to Nashville to sing and play
guitar on the cut.
   ``When we brought him up here to do the session, he loved it,''
Wilson said. ``It was his song. He was king for a day.''
   Wilson adds that he had to wire half of the cash fee for the
session to Diddley at his Florida home before the performer would
come to Nashville. He was paid the other half, in cash of course,
once he arrived.
   Recording an album wasn't on the minds of founding members
Wilson and guitarist-vocalist Mike Henderson when they met and
began playing the blues in Nashville.
   ``We decided we would get the Mike and Wally show together and
play Holiday Inns and places like that,'' Wilson joked.
   ``We got a four-piece band together to play Monday nights at the
Bluebird (Cafe),'' he said. The Bluebird is known as a breeding
ground for new talent and many artists have been signed to their
first recording contracts after appearing there.
   At first the Snakes played to an audience consisting mainly of
waitresses, but in time college students and members of the music
industry became fans.
   ``Pretty soon ... it was jam packed in there,'' Wilson said.
   He credits that success to the combination of original members
Henderson, bassist Glenn Worf and drummer Bill Swartz. But as the
group's sound began to evolve from straight blues to blues-rock,
guitarist Kenny Greenberg was added and Swartz was replaced by
veteran rhythm and blues drummer James Stroud.
   The lineup started playing more clubs in Nashville and attracted
the attention of Curb Records executive Dick Whitehouse, who signed
them to a record deal.
   The effortless dovetailing of the musicians' styles is the
reason for their success, Wilson says.
   ``Kenny is an incredible rock guitarist. When he came here (from
Louisville, Ky.,) he was going to play country. That lasted about
two days,'' said Wilson, who migrated to Nashville from Dallas and
started as a janitor at a music publishing company.
   ``Kenny is the leading guy in this part of the South for playing
rock 'n' roll. He has been featured in Guitar Player magazine. He's
done a lot of album work.''
   Wilson characterizes Worf as the best musician in the band.
``Glenn is an incredible bass player. He is very musical. He could
be a jazz musician.''
   Stroud also is a record producer and has drummed for such greats
as Aretha Franklin. Henderson grew up listening to the blues. He
usually sings and plays the harmonica wearing an old Esso service
station attendant's shirt and a battered straw cowboy hat.
   ``He is the strangest guy I've ever met. All of his clothes are
second hand,'' Wilson said. ``He thinks it's ridiculous for people
to pay more than $20 for an article of clothing. If you see him in
a suit, it will be a $10 suit.''

   After obtaining permission in writing from her parents, Donald
Waite proposed marriage to Susan Parsons on bended knee in an open
Hansom cab in the middle of Manhattan, to the cheers of a crowd of
New York onlookers who spotted the ring and clustered around the
cab.
   Since they had been living together for about five years, Don
was pretty sure that Susan would say yes. But he had her parents'
blessing handy, just in case, when he popped the question on Oct.
31, 1988. To nobody's surprise, Susan did say yes.
   What followed was a year of intense planning by the couple for a
wedding that would be personal to them, yet involve their families
and friends.
   The story of how Susan Lynn Parsons, 28, and Donald Merrill
Waite, 48, planned this most important event for both of them is a
good indicator of the new ways of marriage in the United States,
circa 1989-90.
   Their wedding took something from the past and something from
the present, uniting tradition with life today. What was old was
the sense of joy and anticipation in melding two lives into one,
the desire to make vows in front of family and friends, and the
wish to have a wonderful party in a beautiful place, with all the
trimmings of music, delicious food, photos to commemorate the
occasion.
   What was current was their determination that the wedding
reflect their unique history and tastes and that both would play
equal roles in making the party happen.
   The care they put into arranging their wedding also reflects the
couple's determination to make a go of this, the second marriage
for Don and the first for Susan. And their story may be
increasingly typical these days when two out of five marriages
dissolve.
   The couple planned and paid for their wedding themselves,
sharing decisions equally. They held the wedding where they live _
not in the bride's home town _selecting a country farmhouse owned
by Don's brother for the party and a nearby church for the ceremony.
   The event took place on Sunday afternoon, but many guests came
for the weekend. The round of celebrations included a Friday
evening bachelor party, a Saturday afternoon decorating session at
the farm, a buffet dinner Saturday evening at a relative's home,
and a post-wedding brunch on Monday morning for those who stayed
on, when the couple opened their wedding presents.
   Susan, a dancer, and Don met when she applied for a
between-engagements job as a waitress in his Manhattan restaurant.
They had known each other for eight years when Don proposed
marriage, the night she returned from performances in the national
tour company of the show, ``Dirty Dancing.''
   The couple took just under a year to plan their Oct. 8, 1989,
wedding, throwing themselves into it with enthusiasm. Though Susan
researched wedding form in etiquette books, they felt free to
deviate from tradition. In virtually every aspect of the wedding _
from selecting the church and ceremony through menu planning,
attire, music and photography _ they personalized the traditional
choices.
   They looked at sites in New York City where they lived (they
have since moved to California) but decided early that they wanted
a country wedding. After investigating catering halls and country
clubs, they chose a church ceremony and a home party.
   After a 12:30 p.m. service at the Bedford, N.Y., Presbyterian
Church, 140 invited guests made a short drive to ``The Farm,'' the
nearby country home of Don's brother, Ralph Waite, an ordained
Presbyterian minister who is better known as the actor who played
John Walton in ``The Waltons'' television series.
   Ralph, who no longer has a congregation, donned ministerial
robes to participate in his brother's marriage ceremony. Susan was
attended by her two sisters, Don by another brother and his two
grown sons.
   Before the exchange of vows, Ralph offered some personal
reminiscences about the couple, then invited other guests to add
theirs. Don's sons and Susan's dance teacher were among those who
spoke.
   ``There were laughter and tears,'' recalls Susan, who says some
of the speakers surprised her with the depth and sincerity of their
comments.
   After pronouncing the couple man and wife, Alcorn asked all
guests to bless the marriage by responding in unison, ``I do.''
   The Waites lit a candle of unity as part of the service. Then
the scriptural reading from First Corinthians concluded the
ceremony.
   After a short pause for photos, the wedding party reconvened at
the farm for an afternoon of dining and dancing to the music of a
five-piece band. Since the house was not large enough to
accommodate the crowd, Don and Susan rented two heated tents _ one
for dining, one for dancing. The tents were set up against a
backdrop of rural splendor of meadow, trees and distant hills.
   The site set the mood for food and decor. In keeping with the
Waites' preference for an informal party and for healthy whole
foods, caterers Molly Siple and Gillie Holme created a fall harvest
buffet that included ham, roast turkey, cornbread, squashes, New
England baked beans, salads, cheese and fruit and wedding cake. As
guests assembled, hors d'oeuvres of smoked salmon, corn tartlets
filled with chili, smoked trout on endive and cheese crusts were
passed by waiters. Seasonal flowers and vegetables _ pumpkins,
squashes, autumn leaves, chrysanthemums _ decorated each table, the
tents and the grounds.
   Two bars were set up. One was for alcoholic drinks and the other
for non-alcoholic drinks, including a variety of sodas and hot
apple cider.
   ``We went on instinct when interviewing and choosing the
caterer,'' recalled Don.
   Music for dancing was furnished by members of a five-piece band,
all friends of the groom. The photographer, also a friend of the
couple, recorded the event.
   With a beautiful natural setting _ the trees were beginning
their seasonal change to brilliant autumn reds and golds _ not much
decoration was needed. Instead of hiring a florist, the couple,
some guests and their caterer embellished the setting with 35 pots
of chrysanthemums Don bought for the occasion. A wagonload of wood
chips was used to create a pathway, and items already on the
property, such as an antique tractor, were embellished with dried
grasses and leaves and seasonal fruit. A grape arbor was hung with
bunches of grapes.
   It was a wedding celebration that few guests wanted to end. At
twilight, guests slowly began to leave. Then the bride exchanged
her long white dress for jeans and the groom and his attendants
changed from morning coats and tuxedos into work clothes to clean
up the site before going home.
   Out-of-town guests were accommodated in a block of rooms
reserved for them at a nearby Holiday Inn.
   The wedding, however, was not over. On Monday morning, Ralph
hosted a brunch at which the couple opened their gifts. Then on
Tuesday, members of the family who had come from almost every part
of the country gathered once again at the farm. The occasion was a
memorial service for a beloved relative who had died after a long
illness. ``We were afraid it might be a downer,'' recalled Don,
``but it was a joyous occasion.''

   The wedding ceremony of Susan Parsons and Donald Waite expressed
their relationship with each other, their families and their
friends.
   ``And that's a what wedding should do,'' says Rev. Paul Alcorn,
co-pastor of the Bedford, N.Y., Presbyterian Church in which the
couple were married.
   Alcorn says that most couples now want the wedding ceremony to
reflect their personal histories. In this instance, the groom's
brother _ an ordained minister _ officiated in the service with
Alcorn, and the congregation was asked to consent verbally to the
union. Then anyone who wished to could speak about the couple, a
part of the ceremony known as sharing time.
   The wedding also was typical because one partner had been
divorced, says Alcorn. ``A significant proportion of couples come
from a background of divorce.''
   Some other trends noted by Alcorn and others: Premarital
counseling is taken much more seriously. Alcorn says couples are
``very interested in interpersonal dynamics,'' and ministers are
likely to initiate discussions on how relationships succeed and
fail.
   ``More couples are opting for a more traditional type of service
than five to eight years ago, but with contemporary nonsexist
language. They avoid masculine-only gender pronouns and the thees
and thous. It's not just the father of the bride giving daughters
away. In 95 percent of the services, both families give their
blessing,'' says the pastor. He says he found the same thing true
in prior pastorates in Neenah, Wis., and suburban Chicago.
   Rabbi Daniel Syme, author of the book, ``The Jewish Home'' and
vice president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations in New
York, finds that Jewish couples in the Reform tradition ``are much
more interested in knowing the meaning of the ceremony and the
symbols that will be part of that ceremony, as opposed to passive
participation in a ceremony which is not understood.''
   Interest in restoring traditional ceremonies but updating them
to reflect a more equal role for women also is an important trend,
he said. In Jewish ceremonies, it's common for both sets of parents
to join the couple under the wedding canopy, or chupa.
   Other ways in which tradition is returning include the use of a
Jewish marriage document in Hebrew and Arabic, known as a ketuba.
However, the ketuba (the word comes from the Hebrew word meaning
``written'') has been recast to reflect the equality of the sexes
in the marriage covenant, says Syme.
   Among a growing number of Reform Jewish couples, the groom wears
a yarmulke, or skullcap, and makes similar caps available to all
men in the temple. Reform Judaism eliminated the requirement for
the headgear many years ago.
   Donning the skullcap signifies both the re-embracing of
tradition and the fact that many of those now affiliated with
Reform congregations came from more traditional homes. ``For them
the yarmulke is an important symbol,'' says Syme.
   ``It is customary now for the couples getting married in the
Catholic faith to enter more into the planning of their wedding,''
says Bishop Patrick V. Ahern, Vicar of Staten Island. N.Y., and
pastor of the Church of the Blessed Sacrament there.
   ``In the old days, it was a fully developed ceremony which they
accepted and didn't modify,'' according to Ahern, who has been a
priest for 45 years. The changes introduced by the Vatican Council
15 years ago make it easier for couples to exercise some choices.
   ``Couples are delighted to have that opportunity to participate.
They get a pamphlet listing options and in most cases go over it
very carefully,'' says Ahern. ``Often they design very beautiful
ceremonies for themselves, selecting the readings from scripture
and using certain permissible options.'' He says a favored Biblical
reading is the section on love in First Corinthians. The Waites
chose this.
   Many Catholic couples will opt for a candle-lighting ceremony.
Each lights a taper and then together they light a third candle, to
symbolize the unifying sacrament of marriage and their equality as
man and wife. They often turn to each other in exchanging consent
vows, adds Ahern.
   Rabbi Alex Goldman, author of the novel ``The Rabbi Is A Lady''
and 12 other books and religious leader of Temple Beth El, a
conservative temple in Stamford, Conn., reports that there has been
a change in choices of ceremonial music of the wedding.
   ``Gone almost completely are traditional military marches like
`Here Comes The Bride.' Instead, music that has come out of Israel
and is drawn from the Psalms or Solomon's Song of Songs is
preferred. This gives the ceremony a more romantic and more loving
character.''

   Offering guests a festive meal after the wedding ceremony is a
way of sharing the happiness of the bride and groom, so part of the
feast reflecting the couple's ethnic backgrounds is appropriate,
says Molly Siple, who with partner Gillie Holme catered the Sunday
afternoon country wedding of Donald and Susan Waite.
   While you do need one dish that virtually everyone will like _
in New York, chicken, turkey or poached salmon fulfill the
requirement _ other selections can be more adventurous. If
ingredients of a particular ethnic favorite are available locally,
professional caterers will enjoy the challenge of preparing these
dishes for your guests, Siple says.
   Food served can take a cue from the season and time of day. Of
course, practical considerations of budget and cooking facilities
also need to be considered in menu planning.
   The menu at the Waites' wedding was dictated by minimal cooking
facilities, the outdoor setting, autumn season and the country
locale.
   Requests for a healthful menu light on saturated fats and sugar
and dishes prepared without alcohol also were taken into
consideration. All these factors made a harvest theme natural, says
Siple.
   The menu included ham, roast turkey and condiments, New England
baked beans, a melange of seasonal squashes and cornbread on the
main buffet table. There were a separate salad station (tomatoes
with basil, marinated mushrooms and greens), a table for cheeses
and fruit and another for the wedding cake.
   The Waites' choices are part of a trend to more healthful fare
and ethnic dishes, according to Modern Bride editor Cele Lalli. The
use of several different buffet stations, making it easy to offer a
variety of dishes and serve a crowd more efficiently, also was
typical, she says.
   Lighter fare, such as a choice of fish, chicken or beef, is
being offered at many weddings around the country. Some invitations
arrive with a request for guests to indicate their main course
preference _ a practice Lalli finds unappealing. It's more gracious
to have the choice made just before the meal, she says.
   One reason for more adventurous menus is that ``more couples now
are actually planning and paying for their own event. As a result,
their tastes and budgets are taken into account,'' says Boyce
Brawley, a partner in the catering firm, New York Parties, and
co-author of a new book of the same name.
   Brawley says that when the couple plan the wedding, they're more
likely to opt for an informal event than their parents might have
been. Younger people prefer an extended cocktail party with finger
foods and passed foods and several serving stations. As a rule,
that's less costly than a sit-down meal, ``but not if you want
everything that you would have had at a dinner,'' says Brawley.
   ``Weddings of this type are not quite so formal and are more
conducive to conversation,'' he says. People have a chance to
circulate. Formalities and traditions of toasting and cake cutting,
however, are observed just as much by the young, he says.
   Late afternoon teas are increasingly popular. ``Since this is
not necessarily a period when parents are paying for the wedding,
the lesser expense of a tea is welcome.''
   Brawley says that mixing ethnic foods with more standard dishes
is becoming more common. If the bride and groom are of different
ethnic backgrounds, it's a practice to serve foods from both
traditions. ``Nothing is wrong with mixing ethnic flavors. After
all, this is a union of two families, and you want to make everyone
feel comfortable. We may even ask the couple for family recipes.''
   Brawley says that while more variety is sought in dishes, a few
foods turn up often. ``Nine times out of ten some form of salmon
will show up, and meats such as lamb, duck and quail are being
ordered far more often. People are ready to experiment.''
   Wedding planner Marcy Blum says the eclectic menu makes for a
more festive party: ``Food becomes part of the entertainment. With
six or seven buffet stations, the party flow works better at a
large wedding,'' she adds.
   Blum, who is based in New York but helps plan weddings in many
areas, says many people prefer to offer fowl rather than red meat.
She agrees that ethnic foods are popular _ and part of a trend
toward ethnicity throughout the event.

   When planning their wedding party, Donald and Susan Waite
confronted the issue of whether and how to serve alcohol at their
wedding.
   The Waites decided to serve both liquor and non-alcoholic
drinks, set up at separate bars. The Waites took another step that
is becoming more common, according to their caterer: They specified
that no alcohol be used in food preparation.
   Serving food laced with spirits creates a problem for people
with ulcers and other physical disabilities and for recovering
alcoholics, so it's better not to do so, according to caterer Molly
Siple. The Waites' sensitivity is not unique. ``My mail is filled
with questions on how to handle alcohol,'' says Cele Lalli, editor
of Modern Bride. It can be particularly touchy if one family has
religious scruples against alcohol and the other family does not.
   ``I always tell readers that they don't have to serve alcohol if
doing so would make them uncomfortable. Often a good compromise is
to have two separate bars _ one with alcohol and the other
without,'' adds Lalli.
   According to Millie Martini Bratten, an editor at Bride's
magazine, ``We see more people beefing up the nonalcoholic side of
the wedding by serving designer waters and natural sodas. There's
more of a choice for people who don't drink.''
   Boyce Brawley, of New York Parties, says concern about guests'
drinking is much more evident among hosts than it used to be. ``Our
bartenders can cut someone off by not serving them.'' At some
weddings, only champagne and sparkling water are served. If there
is a full bar, bartenders are urged to exercise discretion, perhaps
making succeeding drinks weaker for a guest if they notice he has
been consuming a great deal of alcohol.
   There was a period when everything, including the cake, was
soaked in liqueur. That's no longer fashionable, according to
Brawley. ``The idea of being a social drinker is being looked at
with more scrutiny.''
   Wedding consultant Marcy Blum says hosts worry about too long a
cocktail hour. ``They don't want guests drinking for two hours,
whereas in the past they didn't care. At two recent weddings we set
up a separate non-alcoholic bar and featured non-alcoholic
prominently. Smoking grass outside _ something that used to happen
at weddings _ is no longer considered acceptable,'' she adds.

   One of the surprising things Don and Susan Waite learned in
planning their wedding is that a celebration at a public place _ a
restaurant, catering hall or country club _ can be less expensive
than one at home.
   Most catering halls are equipped with everything needed to
entertain a crowd. So they can offer a package price lower than an
event at a private site, where many items must be rented
individually. The one-stop wedding party also may take less time to
plan.
   The Waites decided against going this route because they wanted
to keep control of all the details. They especially liked the idea
that their wedding in all its aspects would be a personal
reflection of them. And they could keep the party going as long as
they wanted. They discovered that most public places have more than
one wedding in a day, so they would have been limited to a booking
schedule.
   The Waites spent about $20,000 on their wedding and the party,
not including the cost of clothing. Susan's dress cost about $800,
while Don and his attendants rented their attire.
   Costs worked out as follows: $3,000 to rent and erect two large
heated tents, $2,000 for photography, $2,000 for the band, and
$12,000 for the catering services, food and beverages.
   A tip the Waites offer others who are planning a wedding is to
decide on the guest list early and to order extra invitations.
   ``We thought we had 100 friends and relatives to invite. So we
ordered 100 invitations. Then we thought of 100 more we had to
have. We had to order extra invitations, which was quite
expensive,'' recalls Susan.

   Social scientists will tell you that the October, 1989, wedding
of Susan Parsons, 28, and Donald Waite, 48, is an good example of
demographic trends affecting marriage in the United States.
   According to demographer Arlene Saluter, U. S. Census Bureau
statistician, people are older at first marriage than they once
were. The median age for women is 23.6 years; for men, 25.9. These
1988 statistics are the latest and represent a trend.
   ``Young adults are postponing marriages until later to pursue
education and careers. The high cost of housing is also a factor,
as is the acceptability of alternative arrangements, such as
sharing households,'' says Saluter. Most people _ at least 90
percent _ will marry eventually, she adds. Statistics show that the
chance of divorce is lessened by advanced education, so by waiting
longer, couples may have a more stable marriage.
   At 28 for the bride and 48 for the groom, there is a 20-year age
difference between bride and groom. Though unusual, this is part of
a slight trend toward age differences of eight years or more
between partners, according to U.S. National Center for Health
Statistics demographer Barbara Foley Wilson.
   Comparing 1976 and 1986, Wilson found that in 1976, the groomrecently
married couples whom she interviewed for
her book, problem areas included combining possessions, lifestyles
and close relationships and adult friendships they had with
individuals other than their spouse. Another important issue is
that women come to marriage committed to careers.
   McDonough, whose own recent marriage was to a man 16 years older
and of a different religion, says that there are more marriages
between individuals of different religious or cultural traditions
who may have vastly different sets of experiences and expectations.
``The families have a lot more work to do to assimilate this new
union.''
   The differences can be either problems or opportunities.
Depending on how they are handled, ``they can lead to a stronger
marriage between partners who bring more to a relationship.''
   Unexpressed fears about differences can lead each partner to
doubt the wisdom of the step they are about to take. When unvoiced,
the worries become a generalized anxiety which becomes attached to
the wedding event itself.
   ``Almost everyone I interviewed experienced a great deal of
turmoil about small details of the ceremony and reception,'' she
says. Becoming overwrought over such issues as where people sit or
the color of the napkins is usually a cover for other emotional
issues.
   ``There is almost always a question of whether the couple will
satisfy themselves or their parents.'' Since they are older and
more self-assured and often paying for the wedding themselves, the
couple are more likely to make decisions in keeping with their own
wishes. However, how to do this tactfully, without alienating the
parents, is often a central issue of the wedding.
   ``My parents were divorced very acrimoniously 15 years ago, and
I wanted them both to attend my wedding. It took a lot of work. I
had it at a friend's home rather than at my mother's so my father
would feel comfortable, invited my father's new wife and made sure
to invite my mother's close friends, too,'' says McDonough.
   ``The attempts I made were helpful, although at times my husband
and I thought about simply eloping. I am glad I had the wedding I
always wanted.''
   She advises others to verbalize their fears because ``it is more
fun to plan a wedding if you are aware of the emotional issues and
try to do something about them.''
   ``In the 1950s we had a little box we all called marriage. The
'60s threw it out and everyone said no more boxes for me,'' says
Barbara Tober, editor of Bride's magazine.
   In the 1970s many people realized marriage could be reshaped to
fit their needs, and in the 1980s many became comfortable with the
idea that their marriage could be different from others.
   Tober says that ``the key to '90s attitudes will be that
marriage is something you mold, a freeform sculpture, a work of art
in progress that you can do anything you want with.''

   Don't get so wrapped up in the excitement of
courtship and planning your wedding that you put off planning your
marriage, cautions a mental health specialist.
   Talking things out is the key to starting and maintaining a good
marriage, says Donna J. Rankin, associate professor of community
and health nursing at Loyola University. ``When you think to
yourself, we'll talk about this later, that later may be too late.''
   Subjects that are best aired before the ceremony include
parenting, finances, career and educational plans, dealing with
relatives and friends, compatibility, sexuality and other shared
intimacies, and religion and spirituality, both for the couple and
the children they will have.
   ``Everything is fair game for discussion at this point,'' says
Rankin. ``Too many couples think they can talk later, but if you
don't do it now, will you ever get around to it?''
   Rankin says most problems emerge after the honeymoon phase, a
period which which can last for just a few months or as long as
several years. Then the reality sets in, and you see your partner
as he or she really is. Rankin says this can be revealing but not
necessarily negative.
   ``Many of the couples I see for counseling yearn for `the good
old days' of their marriage, wishing it could be like the marriage
was previously,'' she says. ``You can't expect marriage to grow
without change, but change can hurt and requires adjustment by both
parties.''
   Rankin advises couples to have a serious discussion of their
life together at least once a year and suggests anniversaries as a
good time. ``Examine where you've been and where you're going.''

   The engagement ring _ whether set with diamonds or other
precious gems _ is now likely to be more elaborate than the
long-traditional half-carat solitaire. And it's also more expensive.
   The average price of a diamond engagement ring in l988 reached
an all-time high of $1,325, a 23 percent increase over the previous
year, according to Lloyd Jaffe, chairman of the American Diamond
Industry Association.
   One of the reasons, he says, is that couples are waiting until
they are older to marry. ``(This) may account for the trend of
brides and grooms to purchase larger and better quality stones.''
says Jaffe.
   While in most cases the groom still pays for the ring, both he
and the bride share in choosing it, according the William G.
Underwood, president of the American Gem Society. He says older
couples, who account for two-thirds of engagement ring purchases,
are spending about three times as much as younger couples.
   The diamond association says that 73 percent of engagement rings
purchased in l988 were diamonds, while the gem society estimates
that about 55 percent of today's couples are picking alternatives
to the half-carat diamond solitaire.
   Diamonds are being picked from a wider variety of cuts,
including pave, baguette, channel and marquise shapes. And more
couples are choosing rubies, sapphires and other colored gemstones.
   The gem society says that women marrying for the second time are
likely to pick one ring, often set with one center stone and
complementary stones, rather than the engagement and wedding ring
combination.

   You want to look terrific at your wedding, not just because it's
your day in the spotlight, but because the pictures made will be
among the most tangible mementos of the event.
   But just like every other detail of the celebration, getting
your hair, makeup and skin ready takes planning and care.
   ``Hair and makeup are the keys to a bride's beauty, and she
should devote as much care and attention to them as she does to the
selection of her dress,'' says Denise O'Donoghue, Bride's magazine
beauty editor.
   Along with Prell, the shampoo maker, she advises getting hair
into shape early. If you plan to color, highlight or permanent your
hair, do it well enough in advance to fine tune the result.
Preliminary shaping should be done about three or four months in
advance and a fresh cut done about three weeks before the wedding.
Freshly washed and conditioned hair will look fullest and best in
the photographs. Smooth wispy flyaway strands with hairspray, but
be sure to do so before stepping into your gown to avoid staining
or spotting on light-colored, delicate fabrics.
   Also plan your makeup, which may be different from your daily
wear. ``Remember, you will be wearing white from head to toe. Since
the only color will be on your face, your palette has to be just
right,'' says O'Donoghue.
   She recommends experimenting ahead of time, using a white sheet
to simulate the effect of the gown. This will help you discover
whether you'll look better in peach- or pink-tinted makeup. She
advises forgoing frosted or pearlized makeup items, since the
resulting iridescence reflects too much and will make your skin
photograph unnaturally.
   Choose a light foundation toned to your skin and soften blusher
and eyeshadow by blending the edges. Soft black or brown mascara
should be lightly applied, since the white of the gown will
intensify its impact. And, of course, the mascara should be
waterproof to avoid streaking from tears.
   Then, have a friend make test pictures to see how the makeup
choices do on film.
   Nails should be professionally manicured every three or four
weeks, with the last session the day before the wedding. Choose
pastel pink or peach shades consistent with your makeup.
   Part of the preparation is getting skin into shape, according to
L'Oreal Cosmetics, which recently introduced a top French skincare
collection called Plenitude. According to Linda Harris, vice
president of product development, the key to healthy skin is
cleansing and moisturizing. Bar soaps are too harsh and strip
natural oils, she says, so the job should be done with gels (for
oily skin) or creams (dry skin).

   No bridal couple really needs to start out with a lifetime
supply of salt and pepper shakers but no coffeemaker. So if you`re
giving shower or wedding gifts, make use of bridal registries to
avoid duplicates or wrong patterns. Or personalize your gifts.
   Bridal registries at local stores are recommended by Jacqueline
Greenwood, Black &amp; Decker's bridal program manager. ``Listed here
are gifts the bride has indicated she wants and needs. One can't go
wrong giving a gift from this list,'' she says. ``Make sure to
purchase it at the store where the registry is, so that it will be
crossed off and no one will duplicate the gift.''
   But if getting a gift idea from the registry seems too
impersonal and routine, go ahead and make a creative, personal
choice, she says. And giving a personal gift to the bride, instead
of a household item, is appropriate if you're a friend of the
bride. ``Roommates in college? Get a college memento _ perhaps a
framed photograph or painting of the campus,'' she suggests.
   Greenwood advises thinking first of items that are in nearly any
household but perhaps not owned by someone just setting up
housekeeping. For example, if you choose a spice rack, fill it up
with a variety of spices to start with.
   Appliances are among the most common gifts, and irons,
coffeemakers or blenders will be among those needed. A personal
touch suggested by Greenwood is to pair a corn popper with
membership in the local video rental store.
   She cautions that the giver should think small, choosing compact
versions of kitchen appliances, since the couple's first home
likely will be compact.
   And if you're giving a shower party, pick a theme that will help
organize the gift choices _ such as something for every room in the
house or apartment.

   Affluent couples who want a ``royal'' honeymoon can be
accomodated at Cliveden, one of England's better known stately
homes, with a travel package by Fischer Travel Enterprises of New
York.
   Honeymooners can enjoy Cliveden's setting in 375 acres set along
the Thames, along with various outdoor and water sports, according
to Bill Fischer, president of the agency. The 300-year-old house
was once home to Frederick, Prince of Wales, the Dukes of
Buckingham, and the Astors.
   He also suggests a Hayman resort holiday off the Great Barrier
Reef in Australia, or a private pavillion suite at Amanpuri, on
Puket Island on the southern coast of Thailand.
   ``Many couples seek out excitement during their wedding trip, to
make it truly special, says Fischer. _
   For those who want the wedding in an exotic locale, with most
arrangements taken care of, there is the Damion Waring Estate on
the island of Oahu, Hawaii.
   The estate's gardens were originally designed as an outdoor
photography setting for the late R.G. Damien Waring, a noted
wedding photographer in Hawaii. Couples who came for their bridal
pictures began asking to have their weddings there. The requests
spawned the estate's business as a wedding center.
   The estate managers, who include Waring's widow, Lurlene, say
that weddings often can be done less expensively at the estate than
at home. The enterprise provides a wedding coordinator who in
consultation with the couple will organize choice of priest or
minister, music, witnesses, transportation, hair and makeup for the
bride, tuxedo rental for the groom, along with photographic and
video coverage of the ceremony. The estate even will assist the
couple in obtaining the marriage licence.
   The estate can be contacted at 5253 Kalanianaole Highway,
Honolulu, Hawaii 96821, or 800-648-5040. _
   European packages with honeymooners in mind are being offered in
l990 by Air France.
   Couples can take in the Spirit of Carnival in Venice, Italy,
from Feb. 23 to March 1, the Grand Prix in Monte Carlo from May 23
to 28 or the Beaujolais Nouveau Celebration in France from Nov. 11
to 15.

   Wedding bells are all right, but those who get married in the
Oklahoma County Courthouse in Oklahoma City can no longer celebrate
with rice or birdseed.
   Oklahoma County Commissioners have voted to ban the throwing of
rice, birdseed, confetti and other similar substances in and around
the courthouse.
   Rice and birdseed traditionally have been tossed at weddings as
symbols of fertility, but the commissioners' action apparently was
not an effort to limit population growth.
   Commissioner F.G. ``Buck'' Buchanan says the policy was enacted
as a safety measure. ``We've had people who have been hurt by
sliding on rice and so forth.'' _
   A French designer has created a wedding dress valued at $7.3
million, requiring a squad of guards at its modeling in Paris.
   Designed and made by couturier Helene Gainsville for her 1990
bridal collection, the lace gown is embroidered with 723 white
diamonds.
   Alexandre Reza of Place Vendome selected the jewels for the
dress, which took more than 3,000 hours to create.

   The new edition of ``Bridal Guide: A Complete Guide on How to
Plan Your Wedding'' by Pamela Thomas is a combination source and
workbook to help you cope with all the details of your wedding.
   Besides the obvious arrangements of setting the date and places
for the ceremony and reception, the book covers details that might
get overlooked -- changing names on legal documents, or parking
facilities for guests. The book gives a countdown plan to keep
track of how far ahead arrangements should be started. Chapters
cover budgeting, showers, bridal registry, invitations, clothing,
flowers, videos and photography, transportation, the licence, the
cake, the honeymoon and many other details.
   The book is published by Bridal Guide Ltd. of La Crosse, Wis. _
   A new column in Bride's magazine helps steer bridal consumers
away from scams and shoddy goods and services. Called ``Watch
Out!!!,'' the column will offer precautionary tips and tell what to
do if you get stung.
   ``Many brides have been victimized by disreputable wedding
professionals when they are most vulnerable _ frenzied due to the
enormous task of arranging a wedding, and panicked over the amount
of money they're spending,'' writes columnist Laurie Werner. _
   If the bride doesn't receive an electric frypan, blender and
iron as gifts, these are the first appliances she'll buy herself,
according to a survey by the Association of Home Appliance
Manufacturers and Bride's magazine.
   The survey showed that all brides want small appliances as gifts
and that blenders and frypans top the list, desired by 74 percent
of those surveyed. Other popular appliances are automatic drip
coffeemakers, electric can openers, hand-held mixers, toasters and
irons. _
   Most men and women would re-marry their spouses if they had it
to do over, according to a survey commissioned by Korbel Champagne
Cellars.
   Among those surveyed, 91 percent said they'd pick the same mate.
The happiest of the sample are those who have been married for less
than seven years.
   ``Both men and women appear to be equally happy with their
choice of a spouse,'' says Marie Rama, Korbel's director of
weddings and entertaining. ``Regionally, Northeasterners say they
have the highest number of happy marriages, with 94 percent of
those surveyed maintaining that they would re-marry their spouses.
Respondents living in the North Central region of the country, with
89 percent, are the least likely to say `I Do' again.'' _
   A two-piece bridal set in sterling silver from Towle
Silversmiths features a cake knife and trowel for serving wedding
cake, which can be used for other cakes and pies after the wedding.
The set comes in all patterns and is boxed in a hand-rubbed
hardwood storage chest. Price is about $125. _
   Easy care glamour for the trousseau might include lacy,
old-world lingerie done up in modern fibers, such as Creme de
Captiva or Patina from Allied Fibers. Makers using the fabrics
include Character, Val Mode, Gilligan &amp; O'Malley, Fernando Sanchez,
and Nightflowers. _

   The wedding ceremony of Susan Parsons and Donald Waite expressed
their relationship with each other, their families and their
friends.
   ``And that's a what wedding should do,'' says Rev. Paul Alcorn,
co-pastor of the Bedford, N.Y., Presbyterian Church in which the
couple were married.
   Alcorn says that most couples now want the wedding ceremony to
reflect their personal histories. In this instance, the groom's
brother _ an ordained minister _ officiated in the service with
Alcorn, and the congregation was asked to consent verbally to the
union. Then anyone who wished to could speak about the couple, a
part of the ceremony known as sharing time.
   The wedding also was typical because one partner had been
divorced, says Alcorn. ``A significant proportion of couples come
from a background of divorce.''
   Some other trends noted by Alcorn and others: Premarital
counseling is taken much more seriously. Alcorn says couples are
``very interested in interpersonal dynamics,'' and ministers are
likely to initiate discussions on how relationships succeed and
fail.
   ``More couples are opting for a more traditional type of service
than five to eight years ago, but with contemporary nonsexist
language. They avoid masculine-only gender pronouns and the thees
and thous. It's not just the father of the bride giving daughters
away. In 95 percent of the services, both families give their
blessing,'' says the pastor. He says he found the same thing true
in prior pastorates in Neenah, Wis., and suburban Chicago.
   Rabbi Daniel Syme, author of the book, ``The Jewish Home'' and
vice president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations in New
York, finds that Jewish couples in the Reform tradition ``are much
more interested in knowing the meaning of the ceremony and the
symbols that will be part of that ceremony, as opposed to passive
participation in a ceremony which is not understood.''
   Interest in restoring traditional ceremonies but updating them
to reflect a more equal role for women also is an important trend,
he said. In Jewish ceremonies, it's common for both sets of parents
to join the couple under the wedding canopy, or chupa.
   Other ways in which tradition is returning include the use of a
Jewish marriage document in Hebrew and Aramaic, known as a ketuba.
However, the ketuba (the word comes from the Hebrew word meaning
``written'') has been recast to reflect the equality of the sexes
in the marriage covenant, says Syme.
   Among a growing number of Reform Jewish couples, the groom wears
a yarmulke, or skullcap, and makes similar caps available to all
men in the temple. Reform Judaism eliminated the requirement for
the headgear many years ago.
   Donning the skullcap signifies both the re-embracing of
tradition and the fact that many of those now affiliated with
Reform congregations came from more traditional homes. ``For them
the yarmulke is an important symbol,'' says Syme.
   ``It is customary now for the couples getting married in the
Catholic faith to enter more into the planning of their wedding,''
says Bishop Patrick V. Ahern, Vicar of Staten Island. N.Y., and
pastor of the Church of the Blessed Sacrament there.
   ``In the old days, it was a fully developed ceremony which they
accepted and didn't modify,'' according to Ahern, who has been a
priest for 45 years. The changes introduced by the Vatican Council
15 years ago make it easier for couples to exercise some choices.
   ``Couples are delighted to have that opportunity to participate.
They get a pamphlet listing options and in most cases go over it
very carefully,'' says Ahern. ``Often they design very beautiful
ceremonies for themselves, selecting the readings from scripture
and using certain permissible options.'' He says a favored Biblical
reading is the section on love in First Corinthians. The Waites
chose this.
   Many Catholic couples will opt for a candle-lighting ceremony.
Each lights a taper and then together they light a third candle, to
symbolize the unifying sacrament of marriage and their equality as
man and wife. They often turn to each other in exchanging consent
vows, adds Ahern.
   Rabbi Alex Goldman, author of the novel ``The Rabbi Is A Lady''
and 12 other books and religious leader of Temple Beth El, a
conservative temple in Stamford, Conn., reports that there has been
a change in choices of ceremonial music of the wedding.
   ``Gone almost completely are traditional military marches like
`Here Comes The Bride.' Instead, music that has come out of Israel
and is drawn from the Psalms or Solomon's Song of Songs is
preferred. This gives the ceremony a more romantic and more loving
character.''

   Policymakers at the Federal Reserve will move
to push interest rates lower, possibly as early as this week,
private economists say.
   The expected round of credit easing in response to evidence of a
weakening economy and moderating inflation would cause a variety of
business and consumer rates to fall, the economic forecasters say.
Among the rates that could drop would be the prime rate and home
mortgage rates.
   The Federal Open Market Committee is meeting today and Tuesday
for its final strategy sessions of the year.

dollars from their employees' pension programs to finance buyouts,
ward off takeovers or simply pocket the profits.
   These ``reversions,'' legal under a 1974 law, face growing
criticism amid warnings that parts of the nation's $2 trillion
private pension system are on shaky ground and could eventually
force a massive taxpayer bailout.

   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit surged to
$10.2 billion in October, the worst imbalance in 10 months, as a
record level of imports swamped a small rise in exports, the
Commerce Department said.
   The October deficit was a sharp 19.8 percent higher than the
September imbalance of $8.51 billion, reflecting a higher foreign
oil bill and big increases in imports of food and industrial
supplies, the government said Friday.

   A sharp drop in gasoline costs helped push
wholesale prices down in November for the third time in five
months, the government reported.
   The annual rate of inflation, as measured by the Labor
Department's Producer Price Index released Friday, was 4.6 percent
for the first 11 months of the year, up from 4 percent for all of
1988 but much lower than was feared earlier this year.
   The index dipped 0.1 percent last month following a 0.4 percent
gain in October and a 0.9 percent spurt in September. It declined
0.5 percent in July and 0.4 percent in August.

   Industrial production was little changed in
November despite rebounding from a major strike and a devastating
earthquake, the government said.
   The Fed attributed the 0.1 percent gain Friday to a rebound from
the Boeing Co. strike and from lingering effects in the computer
and related industries from the San Francisco Bay-area earthquake
in October, when output slumped 0.6 percent.

<HEAD>United, American Airlines Cleared of Reservation Monopoly Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. District Court jury has found no
evidence to substantiate a claim that United Airlines and American
Airlines monopolized the airline reservation market by giving
travel agents underpriced computer systems.
   A federal jury ruled Friday against four airlines that asked for
damages totaling $149 million from United, which operates the
Apollo reservation system, and American, which runs the Sabre
system.
   The plaintiffs contended that travel agents bought the United
and American systems because the airlines undercut the actual
price, and that agents then were asked to sign exclusive contracts.
   ``The jury has confirmed what American has long maintained: that
the marketing of computer reservation systems to travel agents is
extremely competitive,'' Robert L. Crandall, American's chairman
and president, said in a statement.
   United Vice President Edward Hoenicke said that ``United's
position as to the fairness of its pricing for the Apollo service
and its contract and marketing practices have now been vindicated.''
   When the case began about five years ago, a number of airlines
were listed as plaintiffs, but their numbers were reduced by
mergers and out-of-court settlements.
   The remaining plaintiffs were Northwest Airlines, which was
suing American; and Alaska Airlines, Midway Airlines and Muse Air
Corp., which were suing United.
   Max Blecher, an attorney for the plaintiff airlines, attributed
the verdict to U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie's decision to
throw out fraud and racketeering claims.
   ``In the case the judge left us to try, we did not have our best
ammunition,'' Blecher said. ``We were not playing with our
strongest suit.''
   In January, Rafeedie is scheduled to preside over a separate
trial on similar claims against American and United, this time by
Continental Airlines and two other carriers.

<HEAD>Rolls-Royce Workers End Strike After Winning 37-Hour Work Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rolls-Royce PLC, a maker of aviation
engines, cut its work week from 39 to 37 hours to end a six-week
strike by 2,000 engineering workers at its Glasgow plant.
   The workers voted by a 3-1 majority Saturday in favor of a
management offer to gradually reduce the basic work week to 37
hours by November 1991, Rolls-Royce and union leaders said. They
return to work Monday.
   In return, local unions agreed to greater flexibility on working
practices and job training to prevent a falloff in productivity at
the plant.
   Engineering unions have brought 10,000 workers out on strike
since mid-October in a selective campaign to shorten the standard
39-hour British work week for its 2 million members in 5,000
companies.
   Agreement on a 37-hour work week by 1992 has already been
negotiated at two other engineering companies, Smiths Industries
PLC of Cheltenham and NEI-Parsons of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
   More than 7,000 manual workers at three British Aerospace PLC
plants in England have been on strike since mid-October in an
effort to win a 35-hour week.

<HEAD>Researcher Stands By 1984 Report Supporting S&amp;L That Later Failed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The researcher whose 1984 report said a
controversial investment strategy posed no danger to Lincoln
Savings and Loan says he stands by his evaluation even though those
investments have been blamed in the S&amp;L's subsequent failure.
   George J. Benston, now a professor at Emory University, was with
the University of Rochester in New York when he issued the study,
paid for by Lincoln Savings of Irvine, Calif.
   ``I stand by the conclusions I drew from the data I had,''
Benston said last week.
   The report was used by Lincoln to battle regulators who sought
to block it from increasing its ``direct investments'' in real
estate and undeveloped land.
   In a direct investment an S&amp;L becomes an owner _ not merely a
lender _ in a project, putting off income from loan payments in
favor of a hoped-for profit when the project is sold. For Lincoln,
many of those deals went sour and have been blamed in part for
Lincoln's collapse.
   Benston's report was endorsed by Alan Greenspan, then a private
economist paid by Lincoln and now chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board.
   Greenspan has been criticized for his role, as have five U.S.
senators _ all beneficiaries of campaign contributions from Lincoln
Savings' owner _ who held a special meeting with S&amp;L examiners to
ask why the thrift was the subject of federal scrutiny.
   Fifteen of the top 17 S&amp;Ls Benston cited in his report to show
that direct investments were profitable have since failed.
   Benston argues direct investments were not the main reason.
   ``They had big losses on their loan portfolios, not their direct
investments,'' he said.
   Edwin Gray, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the
nation's top S&amp;L regulator from 1983 to 1987, counters that direct
investments played a major role.
   ``I think he (Benston) made a disastrous mistake,'' said Gray,
now president of Chase Federal Bank in Miami. ``I don't know how
much he was paid by Lincoln, but his advice was as wrong as wrong
can be.''
   Benston's report delayed early attacks on direct investments,
Gray said, and ``in significant part, that led to the thrift
crisis.''
   This year Congress voted to phase out S&amp;L authority to make
direct investments.
   Benston, now promoted by Emory University as a thrift industry
expert, said his report merely provided an accurate analysis of
contemporary data.
   ``I'm a researcher,'' he said. ``If it turns out that the world
has changed, I'll change my conclusions. But I still don't know for
sure what happened at Lincoln.''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's two largest automakers, Toyota Motor Corp.
and Nissan Motor Co., reported Monday that their exports fell more
than 15 percent in November from last year.
   Toyota Motor said its exports fell 17.0 percent to 123,834
vehicles, while its overseas production rose by 90.3 percent from a
year earlier to 52,108 vehicles.
   It said it sold 234,405 vehicles in Japan in November, up 12.6
percent from November 1988. It was the automaker's eighth
consecutive month-to-month increase in domestic sales, it said.
   Toyota held a 35.7 percent share of the Japanese market in
November, up 1.3 percentage points from November 1988, it said.
   Nissan, Japan's second-largest automaker, said its exports in
November fell 19.4 percent from a year earlier to 76,822 vehicles,
while its overseas production rose 5.1 percent to 56,653 vehicles.
   Nissan sold 113,452 vehicles in Japan in November, up 8.6
percent from a year earlier, it said, for a 22.1 percent share of
the Japanese market, down 1.3 percentage points.
   Nissan attributed the increase in domestic sales to business
prosperity in Japan and the decrease in exports to a slump in the
U.S. market and an increase in overseas production.

   It's crunch time at Nintendo's only U.S.
repair shop.
   With 800 broken electronic game machines to fix each day, scores
of technicians are working feverishly to get them finished and back
home in time to play the new games placed under Christmas trees.
   When Super Mario won't jump, when the screen goes blank, when
the whole gadget chooses to be a lump of uncooperative plastic, the
place to send the misbehaving merchandise is Nintendo of America's
headquarters in this Seattle suburb.
   In a workroom crammed with testing equipment, TV monitors, spare
computer boards and electronic parts from wounded toys, the 160
technicians try to make things right.
   The home office is the only place in the United States to go
with broken Nintendo Entertainment Systems, game packs and other
products for the popular electronic toy. That will change next
year, says Jon Pedersen, Nintendo director of technical services,
as the company starts opening dozens of service centers around the
country.
   At the moment, however, Pedersen is worried about this week.
   ``Right now we're looking at quite a big load for the Christmas
rush,'' Pedersen said. ``We're trying to do the best we can now to
get everything back to the consumer, which means we have to ship by
Wednesday.''
   They've been making about 800 repairs a day, up from 400 to 500
before the holiday season. On the other hand, with Nintendo selling
9 million more game systems this year, ``there's never really been
a normal load,'' Pedersen said.
   ``It grows with the hardware sales. It never really levels off.''
   Nintendo's Entertainment System, a small computer that lets
owners play games on a TV screen, has been the nation's top-selling
toy the past three years. So far, nearly 20 million systems have
been sold in this country, plus about 101 million game cartridges.
   The company expects the game system will be in 22 percent of all
U.S. households by the end of 1989, said spokesman Bill White.
   Pedersen says the machines and games are pretty reliable, with a
problem rate of about one-tenth of 1 percent. But with about 120
million control decks and game cartridges sold, that works out to
something like 120,000 repair jobs.
   The No. 1 troublemaker for Nintendo ``is simply dirty contacts
between the game pack and the control deck,'' Pedersen said.
   ``Basically, because of the age group of the individual who uses
this product, there tends to be a lot of sugar.''
   The machines don't like carpet fuzz either, so when you play on
the living room rug, put something under deck, Pedersen says.
   Nintendo devices carry a 90-day warranty. After that, it's a
flat $30 to fix control decks and $10 for each cartridge, no matter
the problem.
   ``Well, we will call them to ask why we got a sack of parts,''
Pedersen said. ``But I don't think to date we've refused a repair.''
   Starting early next year, Nintendo will open repair centers at
some of its ``World of Nintendo'' retail outlets. By the end of
1990, there should be about 200 service outlets, each capable of
doing any repair the main workshop can.
   That won't mean Pedersen will be cutting back.
   ``The way the workload increases around here, I don't see it,''
he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marriott Corp. today announced a major
restructuring, including the sale of its fast food and family
restaurant businesses, in an effort to reposition the company for
the next decade.
   The company also said that it has completed the sale of its
airline catering division to a group of senior managers for $570
million. That sale was expected to yield more than $200 million for
Marriott.
   ``As we move into the 1990s, we want to sharpen Marriott's focus
on mega-markets in lodging and contract services which together
have an estimated aggregate potential of more than $400 billion in
industry annual sales,'' said J.W. Marriott Jr., chairman and
president, in a news release.
   ``We believe the restructuring will help the company to grow at
15 to 20 percent per year from our 1989 profit base for continuing
operations,'' Marriott said.
   The plan calls for the sale of 358 company-operated Roy Rogers
fast food restaurants in the Middle Atlantic states in the first
quarter of 1990. Those stores were expected to register about $400
million in sales this year.
   Marriott also said it intends to sell the 434 units operated by
its family restaurants division, including 235 Bob's Big Boy, 79
Wag's, 31 Bickford's, 57 Howard Johnson's and 32 Allie's
restaurants. In total, these restaurants had 1989 anticipated sales
of about $440 million.
   The company also announced it has repurchased 32 million shares,
or 24 percent, of its common stock over the past three years,
leaving 104 million outstanding.
   Marriott said one of the company's key objectives is to be a
leader in each of its segments.
   ``We have concluded that it is unrealistic for us to continue to
pursue this goal in `stand-alone' restaurants,'' Marriott said.
   ``In fast food, we have a strong regional concept in a highly
competitive segment dominated by a handful of national chains. In
the family restaurant segment, competitive conditions have changed
significantly within the past year, and we believe it now is too
difficult for a new grand to become number one,'' he said.
   The company, headquartered in suburban Bethesda, Md., expects to
record pretax restructuring charges and writeoffs of between $225
million and $250 million on continuing operations in the fourth
quarter of this year. Pretax writeoffs and reserves of $50 million
to $75 million also will be incurred in the sale of the restaurant
operations, the company said.
   Despite the additional costs, William J. Shaw, executive vice
president and chief financial officer, said he expected per share
income from continuing operations in fiscal 1989 to be up slightly
from 1988.
   Marriott, the nation's largest hotel company, has projected 1990
sales of $7.5 billion.
   ``Our airline catering and `stand-alone' restaurant operations
are sound, profitable businesses,'' Marriott said. ``But they do
not offer the same scale of long-term market growth potential as
our other major businesses.''
   The company has recently launched a new division _ senior living
services _ for older Americans.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The soybean market led grain futures prices lower
in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade following
reports of weekend rain in southern Brazil, a leading soybean
producer.
   The weather has been dry in the early Brazilian growing season,
raising fear of drought.
   Some of this morning's selling also reflected profit-taking
after last week's modest gains in the soybean and wheat markets.
   Weaker outside markets _ particularly a sharp early drop in gold
prices _ set a bearish tone across the grain-trading floor.
   Sub-zero temperatures in the nation's midsection helped support
the wheat and soybean markets last week. Temperatures have warmed
up slightly but are expected to plunge again before the weekend.
   Trading activity is likely to drop through the week, though, as
traders begin their holiday weekends.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to { cent lower
with the contract for delivery in December at $4.12} a bushel; corn
futures were \ cent to } cent lower with December at $2.35 a

   Live cattle were .03 cent lower to .20 cent higher with December
at 78.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .18 cent to .43 cent

   Eastern Airlines agreed over the weekend to sell
its prized South American routes and other assets to American
Airlines as part of a plan to restructure from a 9-month-old
strike, a published report said today.
   Eastern was scheduled to meet with its creditors committee in
New York before releasing a statement, a company spokeswoman said.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak wouldn't comment directly
about The Wall Street Journal story, which said a tentative
agreement in the months-long negotiations had been reached over the
weekend. The report said the transaction will total $450 million to
$500 million.
   American Airlines spokesman Ed Stewart said the company had no
comment.
   Eastern, which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on
March 9, five days after being crippled by a strike of its three
unions, had planned to sell its South American routes as part of
plans to emerge as a smaller carrier. Negotiations with American,
which has coveted the South American routes for its expansion of
Miami regional operations, stalled in August.
   Eastern initiated new talks some two months ago, amid concerns
about cash shortfalls in Eastern's rebuilding plan.
   Eastern has delayed presenting a new reorganization plan to
creditors while the negotiations have continued. Eastern hopes to
emerge from Chapter 11 in early 1990.
   The Journal report today, citing unidentified sources, said
American would get Eastern's South American and Caribbean routes,
plus gates and landing sites at various airports. American also
would obtain some other assets of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp.,
including Continental Airlines' Miami-London route, the report said.
   The Journal reported that the agreement came about after
Continental agreed to settle a long-standing lawsuit against AMR
Corp., American's parent company. That suit sought as much as $1
billion in damages and alleged that American's computer
reservations system gave American an unfair advantage.
   The sale of international routes must receive government
approval.

   The stock market lost more ground today,
extending the decline that began late last week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 14.08 on Friday,
dropped another 5.33 to 2,734.22 by noontime today on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading

   Brokers said traders remained uneasy about the outlook for
real-estate finance and regional bank stocks after the Bank of New
England on Friday announced projected increases in its loan-loss
reserve and non-performing assets.
   In the past couple of weeks, Wall Street has been devoting
increased concern to the soft real estate market in many parts of
the country and the problems real-estate debt might pose should
prices of properties lag for an extended period.
   Bank of New England shares led the active list, down 1 at 8 on

Boston fell | to 16{ and Federal National Mortgage was down 2{ at

   Otherwise, analysts said hopes persisted that stocks could
overcome their recent hesitancy and gain ground in the next few
weeks, aided by the lifting of pressures from yearend tax selling.
   Marriott rose 1[ to 35}. The company announced a restructuring
plan that calls for its departure from the fast-food and family
restaurant business and the buyback of an additional 10 million of
its shares.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks

   The number of working U.S. oil and gas rigs
climbed 25 to total 1,079 after slipping by four last week, Baker
Hughes Inc. reported.
   The latest rig count is up from the 930 a year ago, the company
reported Monday.
   Baker Hughes' rig count, a widely watched industry index of
drilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively
producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Texas showed the largest gain
with seven, followed by Wyoming, six; Louisiana, four; Kansas and
New Mexico, three each; North Dakota, two; and Colorado, one.
   California fell by five and Oklahoma slipped by two from last
week. Michigan and Pennsylvania were unchanged.

automaker's first assembly plant at Marysville.
   The Japanese-owned company, now the fourth-largest automaker in

next year. In 1991, the company expects the plant to produce
150,000 cars, bringing Honda's total auto production in Ohio to
510,00 Accords and Civics that year.
   The Marysville plant, about 3.1 million square feet, also makes
Civic four-door sedans, as well as Accord four-door sedans and
two-door coupes. It produces 360,000 cars a year.
   Honda said the $380 million East Liberty plant has 450 employees
working one shift during the remaining five days of production this
year. At full production, the plant will have about 1,800 employees
on two shifts.
   The company said the plant will help meet its production needs
for exporting cars. Honda plans to increase exports to Japan and
other countries from about 12,000 cars this year to 70,000 in the
early 1990s.

   Most grain and soybean futures prices fell
slightly Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade as badly needed
precipitation fell in U.S. winter wheat region and the Brazilian
soybean belt.
   In the Great Plains, the precipitation was in the form of snow,
which should help insulate the dormant winter wheat crop from the
brutal cold in the nation's midsection. The development was bearish
for new-crop wheat contracts, those for delivery next spring.
   In Brazil, where it's late springtime, weekend rains brought
relief to the soybean crop, which has been suffering through hot,
dry conditions. Brazil is the world's second-largest soybean
producer after the United States.
   Sub-zero temperatures in the Plains and Midwest helped support
the wheat and soybean markets last week. Temperatures have warmed
up slightly but are expected to plunge again before the weekend.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1\ cents lower to 2 cents
higher with December at $4.15 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1{

   Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as

up 2 percent from a year ago but 3 percent below the level of two

   Marketings of ``fed'' cattle in November totaled 1.50 million
head, fractionally below a year ago and 1 percent below two years
ago.
   The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last
month was reported at 1.99 million head, up 18 percent from a year
ago and 22 percent more than two years ago.
   This was the largest November placement total since 1977, and
was the result of cattle moving into feedlots rather than going
onto wheat pastures.
   Net placements of 1.90 million for November was 20 percent above
last year and 24 percent more than two years ago.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
states, which account for about three-fourths of the nation's beef.
The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of Dec.
1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

   The dollar ended mixed Monday against key
foreign currencies in quiet, directionless trading.
   Gold prices declined.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $411.80 a troy ounce, down $2.10 from Friday.
Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at
$412.75 an ounce, off $1.75.
   Currency dealers said market activity was light since many
traders already have started to close out their books for the
calendar year.
   But Earl I. Johnson, a trader with Harris Trust &amp; Co. in
Chicago, said, ``The dollar is vulnerable on the downside,'' as
evidence of a weaker economy continues to surface.
   Some traders have turned their attention toward the Federal
Reserve's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee, which began
meeting Monday for a two-day gathering.
   Economists maintain the Fed is likely to decide to push interest
rates lower because of softening economic growth, thereby lowering
the value of the dollar.
   ``(U.S.) interest rates should head down, while West German
rates are firm,'' Johnson said. ``That's a prescription for a
weaker dollar.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed at 144.22 Japanese yen, down from 144.30
yen Friday. It traded at 144.10 yen in London, and at 143.725 yen
in New York, down from 144.15 yen Friday.
   The dollar was mixed against the British pound. Sterling fetched
$1.6020 in London, down from $1.6055 late Friday, and $1.60685 in
New York, up from $1.6030.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.7210 West German marks, up from 1.7190; 1.5410 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5480; 5.8800 French francs, up from 5.8785;
1,285.00 Italian lire, up from 1,283.50; and 1.16075 Canadian
dollars, unchanged.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Friday: 1.7245 West
German marks, up from 1.7225; 1.5480 Swiss francs, down from
1.5485; 5.8890 French francs, up from 5.8885; 1.9455 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.9480; 1,289.25 Italian lire, up from
1,286.50; and 1.1610 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1606.
   Gold declined in London to a late bid price of $409.25 an ounce
from $412.25 Friday. In Zurich, gold closed at $408.50 an ounce,
off from $412.50 Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold slipped $2.10 to close at $410.97 an
ounce.
   Silver prices also declined. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery closed at $5.565 a troy ounce, down from
$5.607 Friday. Silver fell in London to $5.55 an ounce from $5.62.

<HEAD>Heating Oil Futures Skyrocket as Cold Snap Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heating oil futures soared Monday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as forecasts for more brutally cold weather attracted new
buyers to a market that has been climbing with barely a pause for
five weeks.
   On other other commodity markets Monday, precious metals were
lower; livestock futures were mixed; and grains and soybeans were
mostly lower.
   Heating oil futures settled .49 cent to 4.24 cents higher with
the contract for delivery in January up 4.24 cents at 74.66 cents a
gallon, a four-year high.
   Unleaded gasoline futures finished 1.3 cents to 1.74 cents
higher with January at 54.51 cents a gallon; crude oil futures
settled 3 cents to $1.12 higher with January at $22.22 a barrel,
the highest level since last April.
   With sub-zero temperature readings boosting domestic demand for
heating oil, the entire energy complex has become a weather market.
The cold snap that descended on the nation's midsection last week
is expected to continue into this weekend, bringing unseasonably
frigid temperatures to most of the United States east of the
Rockies.
   ``We've had weather markets in heating oil before but in my
lifetime I don't remember a weather market developing this early in
the season,'' said James Ritterbusch, a energy market analyst with
Carson Petroleum Co., a Chicago-area oil distributor.
   Weather markets can create huge profits for speculators but they
are notoriously treacherous. A hint of a change in the weather
pattern can send prices plummeting.
   The heating oil market began its climb from about 60 cents a
gallon in early November amid concerns about tight supplies of
heating oil in Europe, which also had an early run-in with Arctic
weather.
   But the European weather has since warmed and river levels there
have risen with rain, opening transportation channels that had been
problematic.
   ``A week or two ago, you saw a lot of cargoes from South America
being redirected from North America to Europe,'' Ritterbusch said.
``I think some of those ships are now going to be making a U-turn.''
   Precious metals futures fell moderately on New York's Commodity
Exchange as the dollar showed some strength. Prices opened sharply
lower but trimmed their losses by midday, with support stemming
from tension over the shooting of a U.S. soldier in Panama.
   Gold futures settled $2.10 lower across the board with December
at $411.80 a troy ounce; silver was 3.9 cents to 4.2 cents lower
with December at $5.565 a troy ounce.
   Pork futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on
ideas that cold weather would curtail hog marketings.
   Cattle futures settled mixed in cautious trading ahead of the
Agriculture Department's monthly cattle-on-feed report.
   The report, which was released after the close, showed 2 percent
more cattle on feedlots Dec. 1 than on the same date a year ago
compared with market expectations for no change.
   November feedlot placements were much higher than expected while
marketings off of feedlots were only slightly above expectations.
   Analysts expected the report to prompt some selling of live
cattle futures at the opening Tuesday. But the report was perceived
as bullish for the cash cattle market and gains there could
partially offset selling pressure in the futures markets.
   Live cattle futures settled .10 cent lower to .35 cent higher
with December at 78.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent
lower to .30 cent higher with January at 84.57 cents a pound; live
hogs were .30 cent to .55 cent higher with December at 53.45 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .13 cent to .88 cent higher with
February at 52.07 cents a pound.
   Most grain and soybean futures prices fell slightly on the
Chicago Board of Trade as new snow insulated the winter wheat crop
from the cold and rain brought refief to soybean crops in southern
Brazil.
   Wheat futures settled 1{ cents lower to 2 cents higher with
December at $4.15 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1{ cents lower
with December at $2.34{ a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2} cents
lower with December at $1.42 a bushel; soybeans were { cent to 2{
cents lower with January at $5.80} a bushel.

<TEXT>
   Former stock speculator Salim B. Lewis on Monday
was spared a prison term for stock manipulation by a federal judge
who ordered him to work in a drug rehabilitation clinic, saying
``your skills should not be wasted.''
   Lewis, 50, a prominent Wall Street veteran whose downfall
resulted indirectly from the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal,
was placed on three years probation and fined $250,000 after
pleading guilty to three counts for illegally inflating the price
of Fireman's Fund Corp. stock in May 1986.
   U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe also fined Lewis' firm,
S.B. Lewis &amp; Co., $400,000 for violating federal securities laws.
   Lewis faced up to 15 years in prison and a fine of $750,000 and
the firm a maximum $1 million fine for the manipulation, which
raised the value of Fireman's Fund stock immediately before a Lewis
client, American Express Co., sold a large amount of shares in a
new public offering.
   American Express was never charged, and there is no proof that
it or Lewis profited from the manipulation. But under federal
securities laws, profit is not necessary for a crime to have been
committed.
   ``I recognize my conduct was wrong,'' Lewis told the court.
``For this I am deeply sorry.''
   He said he was not motivated by greed but by a desire to punish
rival speculators attempting to bid down the price of Fireman's
Fund. The government said his version of events was ``simply not
supported by the facts.''
   Lewis pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court in August,
reversing his assertions of innocence nine months after he was
indicted.
   The charges stemmed from a 1987 guilty plea by former Los
Angeles stockbroker Boyd Jefferies, who testified against several
Wall Street figures in the government's criminal fraud crackdown.
   Jefferies was implicated in the scandal by Boesky, the convicted
inside trader now in a New York halfway house finishing a
three-year prison term.
   Lewis was ordered to work 40 hours a week for one year at Daytop
Village, a Manhattan-based drug rehabilitation clinic. He must work
20 hours a week at the clinic in the second and third years of his
probation. Lewis will work at Daytop as an executive consultant,
Arkin said.
   ``You should be sentenced in such a manner that your skills
should not be wasted,'' Lowe said.
   But she added: ``I firmly believe your actions undermined the
integrity of (the financial) system. I have no problem saying that
should not be tolerated or go unpunished.''
   Prosecutors alleged Lewis requested two of Jefferies' employees
to buy more than 400,000 shares of Fireman's Fund on May 8, 1986,
in an attempt to drive its price up 12{ cents to $38 a share.
   The indictment also accused Lewis of promising to reimburse the
Jefferies employees for any losses and of hiding his role through
phony records.
   On May 9, 1986, American Express announced it would sell 8
million shares of its 41 percent owned Fireman's Fund at $41.50 a
share, a new stock offering that had been widely expected.
   Prosecutors said American Express made $88 million from the sale
but they never offered evidence that any of that profit was tainted
by what Lewis did.
   Lewis said he manipulated the stock price to foil
``short-sellers'' in Fireman's Fund stock. Short-sellers are
speculators who sell borrowed stock to push down the value,
repurchase it at a cheaper price, return the borrowed shares to the
lender and pocket the difference as profit.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission in September 1988 banned
short-selling in new stock offerings like that of Fireman's Fund,
exactly the type of activity Lewis claimed he'd tried to thwart.
Stock prices tend to fall after announcement of a new issue, which
dilutes the stock's value.
   Vincent DiBlasi, attorney for S.B. Lewis &amp; Co., said the firm
had fired all but seven of 44 employees and is liquidating.
   Lowe said the firm's demise sends ``the appropriate message to
the investment community that if a company engages in this type of
activity it will no longer be around.''
   ``In other words the death of a company is as final as the death
of a human being,'' she said.

   The unabating pre-Christmas cold snap drove
heating oil futures prices to their highest closing levels in
nearly four years on Monday, and crude oil futures soared above $22
a barrel for the first time since April.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract for
No. 2 heating oil climbed 4.24 cents to 74.66 cents a gallon in
active trading. Domestic heating oil last closed higher on Jan. 7,
1986, when it hit 75.67 cents a gallon. The January contract had
risen 3.14 cents a gallon on Friday.
   The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the leading
grade of U.S. crude, rocketed $1.12 to settle at $22.22 per
42-gallon barrel.
   It was the highest level since April 20, when the near-month
crude contract closed at $24.65 a barrel, according to a New York
Merc statistician, who asked not to be identified by name. The
January contract rose 45 cents a barrel on Friday.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for January ended the session at
54.51 cents a gallon, up 1.71 cents from Friday's settlement. The
unleaded gasoline contract rose 1.19 cents on Friday.
   ``We are seeing weather-driven markets right now, led by heating
oil,'' said Evan Baron of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc.
in New York.
   He said the cold weather that has swept across much of the
nation in the past week is usually not seen until January or
February.
   ``Heating oil distributors were simply not prepared for this
kind of extended cold weather this early in the season,'' Baron
said.
   William Byers, director of futures research at Bear Stearns &amp;
Co. Inc., said cold weather in Europe several weeks ago inhibited
shipments of oil products, adding to the problems when the weather
worsened in the United States.
   In addition, he said, inventories of home heating oil are
slightly below what they were a year ago.
   Byers said one reason for the jump in crude prices was that the
January contract expires at the end of trading on Tuesday. Other
contract months rose but finished below $22 a barrel.
   He said reports of continued turmoil in Panama failed to exert
as much influence on the market as on Friday, when the reports were
cited as a major factor in the rise in crude prices.

<HEAD>SEC Withdraws Appeal in 1983 Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has
withdrawn an appeal to a federal judge's dismissal of its
6{-year-old civil case against Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co. Inc.,
officials said Monday.
   Tom Carter, SEC regional counsel, said the withdrawal was filed
Dec. 11 in the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   He declined to comment on the reason, but said it had nothing to
do with a separate disciplinary inquiry the SEC has undertaken into
the activities of Blinder, Robinson, a leading penny stock
brokerage.
   Penny stocks are inexpensive shares of startup companies ranging
from biotechnology research labs to energy and mining concerns. The
stocks usually are traded over-the-counter and have been targeted
by federal authorities as a frequent breeding ground for fraud.
   The SEC filed the civil case in April 1983, contending Blinder,
Robinson had failed to keep correct books and records and violated
customer protection regulations.
   In April, U.S. District Judge Lewis T. Babcock dismissed the
case after determining the SEC failed to comply with a court order
and had not acted in good faith.
   The judge also said the SEC could not use documents or testimony
obtained in the 1983 case in court against Blinder, Robinson.
Babcock said his ruling was justified by ``the SEC's egregious
conduct in this case.''
   On Dec. 12, Babcock ordered the SEC to pay Blinder, Robinson
$58,575 in attorney's fees, Carter said.
   In a news release issued Monday, Blinder, Robinson executives
said they are pleased ``that justice has been served by the award
of attorney fees and costs to defendants.''
   Carter said the SEC is considering a possible appeal to the
specific amount of the fees.

   Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG are discussing a
European joint venture to produce multipurpose vehicles, but Ford
is releasing few details about it.
   Ford spokeswoman Lin Cummins said Monday the two companies were
involved in talks about ``a possible European cooperation in a
specific product segment.'' She refused to elaborate.
   Tom McDonald, a spokesman for Volkswagen's U.S. subsidiary,
Volkswagen of America Inc., said he knew nothing of European talks
between his parent company and Ford.
   The collaboration would be the latest in a string of joint
ventures proposed by automakers to take advantage of the emerging
unified European market.
   Monday's editions of Financial Times said in a story from London
the two companies were discussing a minivan project aimed at
mid-1990s production.
   Ford and Volkswagen are involved in Autolatina, a company that
develops, manufactures and distributes cars and commercial vehicles
in South America.
   Ford and Nissan Motor Corp. plan to begin joint production of a
minivan at Ford's truck plant in Avon Lake, Ohio, in the fall of

   The stock market took its sharpest drop in five
weeks Monday, hit by selling attributed to spreading worries about
the real-estate outlook.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 42.02 to 2,697.53,
for its biggest single-day loss since it dropped 47.34 points on
Nov. 6.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 7 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
361 up, 1,289 down and 362 unchanged.
   Brokers said traders remained uneasy about the outlook for
real-estate finance and regional banks after the Bank of New
England on Friday announced projected increases in its loan-loss
reserve and non-performing assets.
   In the past couple of weeks, Wall Street has been devoting
increased attention to the soft real estate market in many parts of
the country, and the problems real-estate debt might pose should
prices of properties lag for an extended period.
   Some observers contend that the situation could become a primary
contributing factor to a debt-induced business slump in 1990.
   Also, analysts said, traders began dumping stocks on fears that
a yearend rally they had been anticipating might not materialize.
   Bank of New England shares led the active list, down 1{ at 7{ on
the heels of a 3]-point drop Friday.
   Among other mortgage and regional banking issues, Citytrust
Bancorp fell 2{ to 14|; Bank of Boston ~ to 16\; Shawmut National
1{ to 17~; First Interstate Bancorp 4] to 43[; Federal National
Mortgage 2| to 31[, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage 5~ to 61~.
   The money-center bank group also came under selling pressure.
Bankamerica dropped 2[ to 23~; Chemical Banking 2 to 29\;
Manufacturers Hanover 1~ to 31], and Chase Manhattan 1[ to 31~.
   Losers among the blue-chip industrials included International
Business Machines, down 1] at 93|; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph,
down } at 46; USX, down } at 34[, and McDonald's, down ] at 33~.
   Marriott dropped 1 to 33|. The company announced a restructuring
program, including a planned move out of the fast-food and family
restaurant business, but also estimated lower fourth-quarter
earnings.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 184.79 million
shares, down from 240.39 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 223.24 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $57.74 billion, or 1.71
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 3.28 to 190.17.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 6.21 to 393.60, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 6.37 at 343.77.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
tumbled 7.81 to 436.03. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 370.86, down 4.64.

<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge on Monday gave
cash-poor Braniff Inc. permission to sell valuable takeoff and
landing slots in Chicago and New York to American Airlines.
   Braniff arranged an emergency hearing in federal bankruptcy
court and obtained approval to sell one slot at New York's
LaGuardia Airport and three slots at Chicago's O'Hare International
Airport to American for $400,000.
   On Dec. 7, Braniff won court permission to sell an airport gate
in Fort Myers, Fla., to American for $2.15 million. U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge C. Timothy Corcoran III approved the sale on condition that
$750,000 be set aside in case Braniff is later liquidated.
   Corcoran indicated he would continue requiring some proceeds of
asset sales to be held in escrow, saying he was worried that
nothing would remain for creditors if Braniff were to be liquidated.
   Braniff creditors requested Monday that the $400,000 from the
slot sale be placed in escrow with the revenue generated from the
Fort Myers gate sale. Braniff attorneys agreed to the request.
   Since filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Sept. 28 and
drastically reducing staff and flights, Braniff has existed on
emergency infusions of cash from the sale of assets.
   The Orlando-based carrier stopped operating all but a few
charter flights and laid off most of its remaining employees Nov.
7. Its workforce is down to 275 employees from more than 4,800
before the bankruptcy filing.
   Lawyers involved in Braniff's bankruptcy proceeding say that by
selling its assets, the carrier is trying to gain more operating
time until it can devise a reorganization plan.

   Wall Street brokerage Drexel Burnham
Lambert Group Inc. will pay a $225,000 settlement to Virginia in a
securities and mail fraud case, state officials said Monday.
   The junk-bond dealer is also barred from soliciting new retail
business in Virginia for two years, the State Corporation
Commission said.
   Drexel has agreed not to solicit new business over the telephone
or set up new retail offices in Virginia for the 2-year period,
after which the company can request the commission's approval to
resume business in the state, the commission said in a statement.
   There are about 300 Drexel agents registered in the state, the
commission said.
   Earlier this year Drexel and its parent each pleaded guilty to
six counts of securities and mail fraud in connection with a
Justice Department investigation of insider trading.
   The Virginia Securities Act allows the commission to take action
against a brokerage if it has been found to have engaged in any
fraudulent transaction or convicted of any felony.
   The settlement is based partly on an agreement between Drexel
and the federal government, in which the company agreed to pay $650
million in compensation and fines in the insider trading case.

   ConAgra Inc. said Monday its net income rose
12.8 percent for its second fiscal quarter, giving the diversified
food conglomerate record earnings for the period.
   The Omaha-based company reported a profit of $63.9 million, or
52 cents per share, for the quarter ended Nov. 26, compared with
$56.8 million, or 47 cents per share, in the same period last year.
   ConAgra reported sales of $3.86 billion for the quarter, up 36
percent from sales of $2.84 billion in last year's second fiscal
quarter.
   For the first half of its fiscal year, net income was up 20
percent to $113.9 million, or 92 cents a share, from $95 million,
or 79 cents a share, last year, the company said. Net sales were
$7.87 billion, up 39 percent from $5.65 billion last year.
   Charles M. Harper, ConAgra's chairman and chief executive,
attributed the results to ``ConAgra's food chain balance.''
   ``As food industry conditions change, different ConAgra
businesses come to the fore,'' he said. ``Fiscal 1990 is a case in
point, and we continue to expect record earnings for the full
year.''
   He said there are many domestic and international opportunities
for the company.
   ``For example, the current political trends in Eastern Europe
hold considerable promise for a basic food company whose job is to
help feed people better,'' he said.

<HEAD>Government Lending Agency Fails To Serve Consumers, Nader Group Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A little-known government agency created 11
years ago to lend money to cooperative organizations has failed to
adequately serve consumers since it was privatized by the Reagan
Administration in 1982, a group affiliated with activist Ralph
Nader charged Monday.
   The Nader group, Center for Study of Responsive Law, charged at
a news conference that the National Cooperative Bank has in effect
used the subsidy from a low-interest $184.3 million federal loan to
provide the profits necessary pay its executives high salaries and
provide financial benefits to large cooperatives serving small
businesses rather than consumers.
   In 1988, only 5 percent of the bank's 641 member cooperatives
served businesses rather than individuals, yet 30 percent of the
bank's $199.6 milion in disbursements during the year were to the
business cooperatives, even though the law limits lending to
business cooperatives at 10 percent of the total, according to a
report prepared for the Nader group by Seyoum A. Haregot.
   The report also claimed the bank is not doing enough to serve
low-income consumers or to stimulate the formation of new
cooperatives.
   Nader, in a forward to the report, said bank has abandoned its
``one-cooperative, one vote'' principle in favor of a voting system
that gives control of the organization to large, established
cooperatives.
   He said the bank's managers drove it from ``serving ultimate
consumers and toward a commercial banking model replete with
executive emoluments, all the while enjoying its substantial
taxpayer subsidy.''
   The federal subsidy to the bank totaled $119.5 million from 1982
through 1988, according to Haregot's report. Salaries, benefits and
bonuses to the bank's nine top executives totaled $1.3 million in
1988, including $250,000 to Thomas S. Condit, president and chief
executive officer of the bank, the report said.
   In a written response, Linda R. Lewis, corporate vice president
of the bank, said the salaries were in line with the pay of other
financial institutions and said the bank has not been obligated to
keep its pay comparable to government salaries since its
privatization.
   She said the bank disagreed with Haregot's argument that it lent
too heavily to business-owned cooperatives, saying that ``we
believe a cooperative owned by a business is in fact owned by
ultimate consumers.''
   Also, the bank, at mid-1989, had a low-income loan portfolio of
$131.8 million, she said.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, said he was ``deeply concerned'' about the ``failed
promise'' of the bank and said it would be ``placed on the
oversight agenda of the committee.''

   Ford Motor Co. announced Monday it is offering
rebates of up to $1,000 on all 1989 and 1990 Aerostar minivans,
matching incentives announced last week by Chrysler Corp.
   Effective Monday, rebates on 1989 Aerostars were increased from

Ford said.
   The incentives will be offered indefinitely, the automaker said.
   On Friday, Chrysler for the first time began offering rebates on
its popular minivans, the Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and
Chrysler Town and Country. The rebates are $1,000. Chrysler
dominates the market for minivans, a class of vehicle it created.
   General Motors Corp. has not said whether it will offer similar
incentives for its minivans.
   The rebates come at a time of a continuing sales slump in the
auto industry that has lead to widespread temporary plant shutdowns.

   Boeing Co. engineers and scientists rejected a
three-year contract with the world's largest commercial jet builder
but technicians and support workers ratified a separate pact, union
leaders said Monday night.
   Charles Bofferding, president of the Seattle Professional
Engineering Employees Association, said members of the professional
unit voted by 69 percent to reject their contract offer but also
voted 52 percent against authorizing negotiators to call a strike.
   It was the first time in the unaffiliated union's history that
engineers and scientists rejected a contract offer, he said. The
union consists of nearly 9,300 of 15,200 affected Boeing scientists
and engineers.
   About 8,300 of Boeing's nearly 12,800 technical and support
workers belong to the technical workers unit. Almost all of those
covered by both contracts are in the Puget Sound area.
   Leaders of the engineers union will contact Boeing officials
immediately about returning to the table, Bofferding said.
   ``We are critical parts of the Boeing team, and we affect them
in all areas,'' he said.
   Bofferding said the voting rate for both units exceeded 80
percent, a record. The unions vote by mail.
   The offers included general pay hikes totaling 3 percent for
engineers and 7 percent for the lower-paid technicians.
   Bofferding said he believed the main factor in the engineers'
rejection was the belief that the money package was too small
compared with that won by Boeing production workers in a 48-day
strike that ended last month.
   The Machinists' three-year pact includes pay increases of 4
percent the first year, 3 percent the next two years; productivity
bonuses of 10 percent, 5 percent and 4 percent of annual gross pay;
and a boost in the cost-of-living formula from 86 percent of
inflation to nearly 100 percent.
   The offer to engineers, who now make an average of nearly
$40,000 a year, called for a 3 percent wage increase and a
productivity bonus of 10 percent of gross pay in the first year and
no further general increases.

   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto denied news
reports Tuesday that Japan's central bank will raise its official
discount rate by 0.5 percentage point to 4.25 percent later this
week.
   Speaking at a news conference, Hashimoto said Bank of Japan
Governor Yasushi Mieno told him Tuesday morning that he knew
nothing about the news reports when the two met at a monthly
meeting of economy-related Cabinet ministers earlier in the day.
   The Yomiuri Shinbun and the Asahi Shinbun, the nation's two
largest newspapers, quoting unidentified sources, reported the
central bank is making final adjustments with the Finance Ministry
on the rate hike, which they said will be put into effect this week.
   If the bank action is taken, it will be the third such discount
rate hike in Japan this year.
   Hashimoto said Mieno gave no indication of a plan to boost the
discount rate during the meeting. The minister said the domestic
economic situation does not demand a third increase in the discount
rate this year because prices are stable, even though exchange rate
levels require watching.
   After the news conference, Hashimoto told Japanese reporters
that he has instructed the ministry's monetary officials not to
agree to any central bank plan to raise the official discount rate
if the bank came up with such a plan, Kyodo News Service said.
   Japan's current discount rate, after a 0.75 percentage point
raise March 31 and another 0.5 percentage point hike Oct. 11,
stands at 3.75 percent.
   A spokesman for the central bank refused to confirm or deny the
reports.
   Mieno, who assumed the central bank's highest post Sunday, told
reporters at his first news conference Monday that a strong yen is
necessary for the continued expansion of Japan's domestic
demand-led economy.
   Mieno said the nation's economic conditions are favorable, and
growth should continue as long as prices remain stable. But he said
the central bank must continue to keep the situation under close
surveillance.
   The official discount rate, the rate the central bank charges on
its loans to commercial banks, has a strong impact on other
domestic rates. Higher rates tend to make the country's currency
more attractive to investors.
   The newspapers said the rate hike is intended to curb
inflationary pressure and to stem the continuing weakness of the
yen against the dollar.
   A lower yen tends to make imports more expensive in Japanese
market, while making Japan's products in overseas markets less
expensive.
   The spread of rising land prices beyond Tokyo and the tightening
of the labor market are also behind the measure, the reports said.
   The measure is also aimed at narrowing the gap in interest rates
between Japan and other industrialized countries, they said.
