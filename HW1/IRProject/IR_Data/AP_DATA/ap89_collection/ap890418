<HEAD>Controversial Police Officer Suspected In Huge Brushfire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former police officer, whose acquittal on
brutality charges sparked riots here in 1980 and who was recently
arrested on drug charges, has been linked to a huge brushfire that
shrouded Miami, officials said Tuesday.
   Alex Marrero, 34, has been connected to charred documents found
at the source of the 12,000-acre blaze that began April 8 in
western Dade County, said Joe Subic, an investigator for the state
Department of Agriculture.
   Police suspect the burning of the documents may have been
connected with Marrero's arrest in a sting operation, although
Marrero himself could not have set the fire. The records were set
on fire with gasoline, Subic said.
   The charred documents were from Eastern Security and
Investigations Inc. in Miami, which Marrero owned and operated.
   Subic said the fire broke out only hours after Marrero and Drug
Enforcement Administration agent Jorge Villar were arrested on
cocaine distribution and bribery charges.
   ``He couldn't have set the fire himself because he was in jail
at the time,'' Subic said.
   The investigator speculated that Marrero could have passed an
order to an associate that the records be burned.
   Arson charges will be brought against whoever started the fire.
   ``The Florida division of forestry will be billing Alex for the
cost of the fire,'' he said, estimating the cost at upwards of
$100,000.
   State and federal firefighters worked for more than three days
to battle the blaze which, with the help of shifting winds April
11, sent a blanket of thick white smoke over downtown Miami and
much of south Florida.
   The flames forced the evacuation of 745 detainees held at the
federal Krome Avenue Detention Center.
   Marrero and Villar were arrested April 8. They are accused of
providing protection for a cocaine shipment that actually was an
undercover operation, and face up to life in prison if convicted.
   In 1980, Marrero and three other officers were acquitted of
charges they beat black insurance executive Arthur McDuffie to
death after a chase, triggering bloody riots.

<HEAD>Plan Recommended To Integrate Louisiana Universities</HEAD>

   A powerful 17-member board should be
established to govern higher education in Louisiana as a means of
better desegregating the state's colleges and universities, a
court-appointed official said Tuesday.
   The suggestion was included in a long-awaited, 137-page report
by Paul Verkuil, president of the College of William and Mary, who
was appointed after black leaders, educators and politicians were
unable to reach an agreement to end a long-running desegregation
lawsuit.
   The report brought the state a step closer to ending a legal
battle that began when the U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit
in 1974. A three-judge federal panel that appointed Verkuil will
have the final say.
   Verkuil's report marked a victory for Gov. Buddy Roemer, who has
been urging the Legislature to establish a single board to replace
the four bodies that currently oversee higher education in the
state.
   Verkuil also said the state should make Louisiana State
University at Baton Rouge the major research, undergraduate and
post-graduate institution in the state, with the toughest admission
standards in Louisiana.
   Twelve other four-year institutions would be divided among a
second and third tier of schools with less stringent admission
standards and fewer post-graduate programs.
   Admission standards at all universities are virtually open to
everyone now.
   In recommending a single higher education board, Verkuil went
against the wishes of black leaders who feared the board would be
insensitive to the needs of Louisiana's two major predominantly
black universities, Grambling State University in north Louisiana,
and the Southern University System based in Baton Rouge.
   Grambling is governed by the Board of Regents and Board of
Trustees, which oversees most of the predominantly white
institutions. Southern has its own governing board.
   An attorney for Southern was light in his criticism of the
recommendation.
   ``For the historically black universities, it could have been
worse,'' said William Jefferson, a Democratic state senator from
New Orleans who is a leader of the Legislative Black Caucus.
   Jefferson was pleased with Verkuil's suggestion that a
percentage of the state budget be reserved for enhancement of
Grambling and Southern, although Verkuil didn't recommend a
percentage or a dollar amount.

<TEXT>
   Change comes slowly down the two-lane
highway that winds through forests, dairy farms and cattle barns
into Greensburg.
   It's taken four decades for desegregation to reach the seat of
St. Helena Parish, and even now a visitor looking for John Hall's
house behind the Masonic lodge is asked, ``You talking about the
white Masonic hall or the black one?''
   ``This parish hasn't changed since 1907. ... Education has been
what kept it like it is,'' said Hall, a construction worker who has
spent 37 of his 70 years fighting to give black students _
including his 14 children _ a chance.
   Hall filed suit in 1952 after being told that the school
district didn't have money to furnish a black school. Ironically,
segregation ended because the district couldn't afford to keep it
going. This semester is the first in St. Helena Parish with all
black and white students under the same roof.
   Under a plan approved in December by U.S. District Judge John
Parker in Baton Rouge, classes were consolidated into three
buildings, including one that Hall and other black residents built
in the early 1950s.
   ``I'm not trying to take credit for anything,'' Hall said. ``I
wanted my children to get an education and that's what they got.''
   St. Helena Parish has one of Louisiana's poorest school
districts. About 95 percent of the parish's annual $6.5 million
budget comes from the state. Until Jan. 6, its 2,040 students, 70
percent of them black, attended seven schools.
   ``There is no question the St. Helena Parish School Board has
been operated in violation of the U.S. Constitution,'' Parker said
in December, adding that consolidation ``means desegregation will
be accomplished.''
   He said some of the schools ``are not fit for a dog house.''
Superintendent Perry P. Spears said all seven were substandard.
Spears, who is black and went to school here, plans to do away with
a fifth school and is working to float a $7.5 million bond issue
this fall to improve the remaining two.
   ``I enjoyed my elementary and high school career in St. Helena,
but at the same time I knew that we were not being supported
equally,'' he said.
   The point was driven home for Spears when he became
superintendent three years ago and saw that white schools had
equipment like washing machines and dryers for the athletic
programs. The black schools did not.
   Back in the early 1950s, black students often sat on soft drink
cases, boxes and pieces of logs to listen to a teacher who didn't
have enough supplies ``or even a chair to sit down on,'' Hall said.
``These schools were as bad as anything you've ever seen. I don't
know why they'd send children up here to get an education at a
place like that. I'd rather put them under a tree.''
   In 1952, he asked the board for a new black school. Officials
told him there wasn't enough money, but they made a deal _ build
the school yourself and the parish will furnish it. The black
community pitched in their meager assets and their elbow grease to
build a new school. Hall returned to complete the deal _ and was
told there was no money for furnishings.
   ``I told him right then that I'm going to take my children up
there to go to school with the white folks,'' he said. ``He took
him a good laugh. He and his crew had a big fun-making deal about
it, I understand.''
   Hall didn't laugh. He, his father, and two other black residents
who still want to remain anonymous went to A.P. Tureaud, an
attorney for the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.
   ``They said you're going to have some mad white folks here,''
Hall said. ``I said I was already mad.'' Despite the warning, he
said, the black residents faced ``nothing more than talk. All kinds
of threats and talk.''
   Although the Supreme Court outlawed segregated schools in 1954,
Hall's suit and scores of other desegregation cases floated in the
courts for years.
   In the 1960s, St. Helena Parish built a modern black high
school. A few blacks started going to white Greensburg High School
and a few whites attended classes in the black schools. ``It was
all token desegregation,'' Hall said.
   Segregation hurt both black and white students, he said. ``You
can't hold back one race without holding the other back.''
   Over the years, running seven schools used up the parish's
allotment of state-supported teacher salaries and resulted in
duplication of basic classes. As a result, few advanced classes
were offered and the students suffered.
   ``We have not been able to offer a comprehensive curriculum,''
Spears said. ``I feel that was the biggest disadvantage we had over
the years.''
   Under consolidation, elementary school students eat lunch in a
makeshift cafeteria set up in an old gymnasium, and some attend
class in trailers. Head Start pupils still go to the cramped
building that black residents built.
   Most opposition came from parents, Spears said. ``They have
caused a problem by letting their kids see how much they oppose
consolidation. I don't think our kids generally oppose
consolidation.''
   In fact, students give consolidation a mixed review.
   ``It's going on pretty well now,'' said Pamecia Foskey, a black
senior. ``It's all coming together. We're thinking of it as one
school.''
   ``It'll probably be better next year, but I won't be around to
find out,'' said Kelly Smith, a white sophomore who is going to
private school in Mississippi next fall.
   ``It's gone better than everybody thought,'' said DeAnn Fugler,
a white sophomore who also plans to go to private school. ``It's
too crowded right now. If the facility gets better, I might come
back. It's hard to tell.''
   About 150 students, mostly white, have enrolled in private
schools or are illegally attending public schools in other
parishes, Spears said.
   He is enthusiastic about the future, especially if the bond
issue passes.
   ``I think that the community is going to have more pride in its
schools. We won't have that competition between schools. The
competition is because we had all-white and all-black schools.''
   A recent high school basketball game was an example of what
Spears hopes will become the rule. ``It was obvious that these were
kids that had never been brought together before. The support was
like we hadn't had before. It's now one-and-one. I feel good about
it. It's going to be a family relationship.''
   Hall, who thought his lawsuit would be settled in four or five
years, isn't so sure. ``It will be slow, slow. The chance for
change will have to come with the new generation, not with none of
the ones who are here now.''

   Enraged by jealousy, Dong Lu Chen smashed his
wife's skull. He was tried and convicted _ and placed on five
years' probation by a judge who agreed with defense arguments that
his guilt was mitigated by his traditional Chinese values.
   The result was a tempest: denunciations by groups representing
Asians and women; threats by the local chapter of the National
Organization for Women to file a complaint with the state
Commission on Judicial Conduct, charging the judge with ``bias and
prejudice''; an announcement that prosecutors would review the case
for grounds of appeal.
   ``There's just no basis for a judge to give this kind of
sentence based on a culture. There is a role for cultural
considerations in some instances, but not in a case where a man has
killed his wife,'' said Margaret Fung, executive director of the
Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund.
   Chen, 51, could have been sentenced to five to 15 years on his
second-degree manslaughter conviction.
   Chen, his wife, Gian Wan, and their two teen-age children came
to New York from Canton, China, three years ago and found life
difficult. According to testimony, in order to get a job the former
farmer had to leave his family in New York and go to Maryland where
he worked for eight months as a dishwasher.
   When he came home during those months, Chen's 41-year-old wife
refused to have sex with him and he suspected she was seeing
another man.
   In a tearful confession, Chen told police that on the morning of
Sept. 7, 1987, he accused his wife of infidelity. She did not deny
the allegation. Enraged, he attacked her with a hammer in their
Brooklyn home and crushed her skull with eight blows.
   At Chen's five-day, non-jury trial, Hunter College
anthropologist Burton Pasternak testified that the Chinese hold
marriage to be sacred. The defense expert said a Chinese man could
``reasonably be expected to become enraged'' upon learning of his
wife's infidelity.
   However, a spokesman with the Chinese consulate in New York, Yao
Shan Vhou, said that in today's China such rage would not justify
the crime, and a husband could be charged with murder.
   ``If he killed a person, he must be held responsible for it.
It's only common sense,'' the spokesman said.
   At the March 30 sentencing, state Supreme Court Justice Edward
Pincus said Chen had already spent enough time in jail for the
killing _ 18 months _ and said cultural considerations warranted
the light sentence.
   Pincus noted ``the effect of his wife's behavior on someone who
is essentially born in China, raised in China and took all his
Chinese customs with him to the United States.''
   Chen's ``cultural background ... made him more susceptible to
cracking under the circumstances,'' Pincus said.
   While some Asian women interviewed gave Pincus credit for trying
to be sensitive to foreign traditions, all agreed his leniency
showed he was misdirected and had no understanding of modern Asian
law and culture.
   ``We were really alarmed by the sentencing and the image it
sends to non-Asians _ that Asian cultures sanction wife killing,
which is not true,'' said Monona Yin, co-chairwoman of the
Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence.
   Ms. Yin and others said the sentencing sent a potentially more
harmful message to immigrant women _ that the U.S. justice system
won't protect them.
   Feminist leaders said adultery cannot justify reducing the value
of a life.
   ``It was unjust and it degrades women's position back to no more
than a commodity that could be bought or sold or done away with,''
said Doris Koo, director of the civil-rights organization
Asian-Americans for Equality.
   Last week, Pincus' clerk said the judge would not talk about the
case. Earlier, Pincus told New York Newsday that Chen ``is not a
loose cannon. ... This guy's not going to do it again and he has
suffered.''
   Pincus also said the state probation department recommended
probation because Chen had shown remorse.

   A watch made from a meteorite and a
diamond-covered timepiece whose $1.4 million pricetag was out of
this world are among the timely attractions at this year's Watch,
Clock and Jewelry fair.
   The 1,860 exhibitors from 16 European countries, the United
States, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore are in Basel until Wednesday
to show off their latest collections.
   It's also a time when manufacturers take stock of new trends.
   The consensus this year among watch manufacturers was that
consumers are willing to pay higher prices for a watch perceived as
unique.
   ``There has been a clear change in consumer behavior,'' said
Klaus Wehner, president of the German Watch Industry. ``The average
price has increased and a watch is no longer just an instrument to
tell time. It is a fashion accessory.''
   One that fell into that category was a solid gold watch covered
in diamonds that is priced at $1.4 million. It's nearly impossible
to see its hands through all the sparkle, but one visitor observed:
``It's a watch for people who don't need to know what time it is.''
   One Swiss manufacturer displayed watches with faces it said were
made from a meteorite discovered in Greenland in 1894 by the
American explorer Robert Peary, who later went on to discover the
North Pole. The company said it only had enough meteorite to make
900 watches, so the series would be limited.
   Swiss watchmakers said mechanical watches were making a comeback
among wealthy consumers, although quartz brands outnumbered them by
nearly 5-1 last year.
   Swiss companies displayed complicated mechanical watches at the
fair, many with intricately carved movements visible through a
transparent back.
   The major technological innovation was a clock powered by
ultrasonic waves. The timepiece was invented by Japan's Akira
Kumada and Takahiko Iochi, who teamed up with a Swiss company.
   The clock face is made of two glass discs that represent the
hour hand and minute hand, and which rotate at controlled speeds
when hit by ultrasonic waves. A microprocessor in the
futuristic-looking clock regulates the frequency of the waves.
   By the end of the year, the company plans to produce 1,000 small
and large ultrasonic clocks, ranging in price from $1,500 to
$10,000.
   Another innovation, aimed at left-handed people, the
handicapped, and women with long fingernails, had no stem for
setting the time. Instead, the wearer presses on the watch crystal
to move the hands.
   Jewelry designers noted a trend toward using more platinum,
following the Japanese lead.
   The trend is likely to take root elsewhere. As French jeweler
Charles Abouchar put it, ``the Japanese like platinum, and if they
like it, it will be around for a while.''

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The revolt against Haiti's leader,
Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, after he fired four ranking officers linked
to drug running illustrates the depth of army involvement in the
illegal trade.
   Washington says this impoverished Caribbean nation has become a
major transit point in the past three years for drugs _ mainly
Colombian cocaine _ on the way to the United States.
   Although cocaine seizures in Haiti in 1988 doubled from the
previous year to nearly 1{ tons, according to a State Department,
``corruption is a problem and the judicial system is weak. Haiti's
long coastline and mountainous interior also facilitate smuggling.''
   Avril has dismissed or retired more than 140 officers, many
suspected of drug trafficking, since soldiers put him in power in
September after ovrthrowing Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.
   ``Since Avril came to office Haitian cooperation has increased
tremendously,'' a U.S. diplomat said. ``But the biggest problem
remains the corruption of the army, the willingness of certain
officers to transship drugs from incoming boats to outgoing
planes'' at isolated ports and airstrips.
   U.S. officials have made a crackdown on narcotics traffic a
condition for restoring $70 million in aid suspended after the
November 1987 election was canceled when thugs killed 34 voters.
   It is common in Haiti for a captain or major whose pay is $900 a
month to drive a Mercedes and live in a wealthy suburb.
   ``The success of drug-running here is due to low army salaries,
cheap raw material and huge profits,'' a Western European diplomat
said. ``One thousand dollars worth of cocaine can arrive here from
South America and sell in the U.S. for $100,000.''
   Contraband and other rackets also are widespread among the 7,000
men of Haiti's army. A diplomat said: ``To crack down on drugs and
contraband in the Haitian army would be like a snake devouring its
own tail. Avril has no choice, but the Americans are making him go
too fast.''
   Avril narrowly escaped a coup April 2 led by four army officers.
Loyal soldiers rescued him at the airport, where he had been taken
in handcuffs to be deported.
   A government statement blamed the plot on opponents of his
``vast campaign against drug trafficking, contraband and
corruption.''
   Last week, two army units rebelled: the 750 men of the
Dessalines Barracks adjacent to the presidential palace and the
elite 400-member Leopards Batallion. Avril's 1,100-man Presidential
Guard smashed the uprising in a two-day assault on the Dessalines
Barracks.
   Rebels in the Dessalines, a notoriously repressive unit,
expressed anger at what they considered Avril's arbitrary
dismissals of the four officers.
   Col. Jean-Claude Paul, former Dessalines commander, was indicted
on drug charges early last year in Miami and died in November.
Poisoned soup was said to have killed him.
   A foreign military expert said Paul was popular with his men
because he ``spread drug money around. He was like their
godfather.''
   Avril dismissed the four officers the day after a visit to Haiti
by Richard Melton, a deputy assistant secretary of state. A U.S.
Embassy official denied Melton brought a list of people to be
fired, but said he ``told Avril the U.S. is interested in his
efforts against drug traffickers.''
   Diplomats said the four coup leaders, who were not the officers
fired, acted from personal ambition and because they felt the
dismissals presaged another purge.
   ``Avril is walking a very thin line,'' one said. ``The drug
runners have big money and everything to lose in a democratic
system. One wonders if they will not always block the democratic
process.''
   Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs in
Washington, said Avril should dismiss hundreds of junior fficers
and soldiers involved in drug transshipment in rural areas.
   ``He has hardly cleaned out the stable,'' Birns said. ``He has
just gotten rid of a few shovel-loads of manure.''

<DATELINE>JACKALOF BAY, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the ground, it sounds like a lot
_ this many thousand feet of boom here, this many thousand feet
there.
   But from the air, the miles of protective barrier desperate
Alaskans have spread out to keep the nation's worst oil spill from
their corner of paradise look pitifully inadequate.
   In the quiet coves and inlets of Kachemak Bay, the view is
encouraging. The taut line of boom, some of it homemade, gives the
appearance of a beaver dam during spring's high water.
   The fortifications at Tutka Lagoon look worthy of its
importance. Pale blue, commercially manufactured boom swirl in a
semi-circle from the narrow mouth of the lagoon.
   Lest any oil creep by, a second line extends hard across the
mouth between steep rocky shorelines, punctuated by thick Sitka
spruce.
   Several hundred yards up the narrow channel sits an emerald
pool, the crown jewel of the lower Cook Inlet pink salmon fishery.
   Floating wooden pens, housing more than 40 million salmon
smaller than a finger, nestle inside a blue diamond of boom. This
hatchery accounts for about 90 percent of the pink salmon caught
commercially each year in the lower inlet.
   The Gulf of Alaska is just a short trip away. This side of the
Kenai Peninsula has been hard hit by the oil the residents of Cook
Inlet and Kachemak Bay hope to escape.
   Just above the mouth of Port Dick Creek, mountain goats seek out
patches of vegetation exposed by retreating snow. A bright orange
boom slumps on the mudflats below.
   Several hundred yards out, a glob of weathered oil ``mousse''
clashes with the crystalline water.
   Farther toward the gulf are more and more patches of mousse,
ribbons of rainbow-hued sheen streaming behind them in the wind.
   In the open water, the mousse has stretched into long strands by
days of vigorous wind. On one side of the spectacular rocky
outcropping, known as Gore Point, squats a large pool of the sickly
brown oil.
   Nearby, seagulls hover almost motionless against the wind,
oblivious to the slow, agonizing death awaiting them should they
swoop into the water.
   ``I wonder what's going to happen to an animal when it gets
tangled up in that?'' asked pilot Bill De Creeft, who has flown
floatplanes throughout the region for 23 years.
   White boom protects a small stream from one side of Porth
Chatham. Farther out, streamers of mousse snake toward sensitive
intertidal basins.
   Near Elizabeth Island, unconnected to any land mass, several
hundred feet of boom known as ``sea curtain'' are temporarily
abandoned. Rough seas have prevented its use in conjunction with
skimmer boats, and heavy oil streams by on either side.
   The island's shore of shattered stone is a favorite spot for a
dwindling sea lion population.
   Before English Bay, the oil peters out. Only the gleen of
reflected sunlight shines off the gently undulating sea.
   A tiny necklace of orange boom chokes off the stream at the back
of the lagoon adjacent to English Bay. Although few people live in
the village, it will be the largest population the oil has
encountered since it began streaming out of Prince William Sound a
couple of weeks ago.
   In contrast to the seeming indifference of English Bay, around
the corner Port Graham bristles against the threat. Cleanup crews
are mobilizing there for quick deployment.
   Booms of various sizes and color sprawl disjointedly among the
fleet of boats there to tend them. The crude log booms built in
Homer Spit look like jumbles of matchsticks on an aquamarine table
top.
   The oil hasn't turned the corner into fish-laden Cook Inlet _
Anchorage's outlet to the sea _ but it is hard to look uncritically
at the surf-scarred beaches heading back toward Homer.
   For a long time to come, every passerby will be looking for the
tell-tale signs of oil instead of the raw beauty of the coast.

   It was a chocolate-lover's delight, but a
big headache for everyone else when a candy-ladened tractor-trailer
overturned on U.S. 6 spilling 15 million pieces of M&amp;Ms.
   ``There was candy everywhere,'' said Police Chief Jim Brown.
   It took a dozen teen-agers almost eight hours to collect the
42,000 pounds of candy, including 11.1 million pieces of plain M&amp;Ms
and 4.1 million pieces of peanut candy, said Brown.
   The accident occurred early Sunday when an eastbound van crossed
the center line and struck the tractor-trailer, state police said.
   No serious injuries were reported.
   Brown said the cleanup began at daylight and continued until
mid-afternoon. The teen-agers were hired by the trucking company's
insurers at $10 an hour to pick up the individual and family-sized
packages, many of which had broken open, he said.
   ``Everybody munched on some candy as they went,'' he said.

   So that it can accommodate more of the foreign
dignitaries who want to visit, Japan will suggest that they forgo
imperial ceremonies and banquets in favor of ``working visits,'' a
Foreign Ministry official said.
   Japan cannot invite more than eight foreign dignitaries a year
if each is honored with ceremonial events at the Akasaka State
Guesthouse and black-tie banquets at the Imperial Palace, the
official said Monday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Dignitaries of more than 40 nations want to visit Tokyo, and
Japan will welcome them for ``working visits'' if they agree to
dispense with the ceremonies in favor of ``practical talks,'' the
official said.
   The government was expected to approve the new system at today's
regular Cabinet meeting, he added.
   He said Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey, due Sunday for a
four-day visit, would be the first foreign guest under the new
system. Haughey is to meet Emperor Akihito, but no court banquets
or ceremonial events are scheduled.

<TEXT>
   America's long debate on legal abortion has
changed few minds: For all the emotional rhetoric, public opinion
on the issue has remained largely stable, and deeply divided, for
more than a decade.
   ``Usually opinions ebb and flow with the tide of events. On this
issue, not at all,'' said James Shriver of the Gallup Organization.
``It just seems to be a bedrock opinion that has been unshaken by
all the turmoil.''
   Not all polls are in accord. While most show no trends, some
have tracked a slight decline in support for abortion in the 1980s,
when President Reagan took a strong anti-abortion posture. Still
others see pro-abortion shifts.
   The difference, owing to the issue's sensitivity and the
ambivalence many Americans feel toward abortion, is the wording of
questions used to track opinion. Polls find Americans personally
disapprove of abortion _ most call it murder _ but at the same
time, most are loathe to restrict it.
   Consequently, some movement against abortion appears in National
Opinion Research Center polls that pose specific circumstances
under which abortions may be sought. Polls on broader policy views,
however, show no movement.
   Gallup, for example, has asked since 1975 simply whether
abortion should be legal under any circumstances, under certain
circumstances, or illegal. The most liberal group has fluctuated
from 21 percent to 25 percent; the middle, 52 percent to 57
percent; and abortion opponents, 17 percent to 22 percent.
   As a trend, Shriver said recently, ``That's absolutely flat.''
   But NORC, at the University of Chicago, has found changes in
acceptance of abortion under specific conditions. Support for
abortion for a married woman who did not want more children slipped
from 47 percent in 1980 to 40 percent in 1988; those saying poverty
was grounds for abortion fell from 52 percent to 42 percent; and
those accepting abortion for an unwed woman who did not want to
marry the father fell from 48 percent to 39 percent.
   NORC pollster Tom Smith, who classified these movements as
``quite small but regular,'' attributed them to the Reagan
administration's anti-abortion posture and aggressive campaigning
by anti-abortion groups. It follows that such efforts, making their
appeal at a personal level, would have an effect on the more
personal poll questions.
   Kathleen A. Frankovic, a CBS News pollster, agreed that
anti-abortion activity may have made it more comfortable socially
to express anti-abortion opinions. Still, she noted, broader
measures _ focused more on policy matters than on personal views _
have not moved consistently.
   A CBS News-New York Times question, for instance, has found a
slight increase in support for current abortion law, from 38
percent in 1985 to 46 percent this year. And the share approving of
legal abortion if a woman and her doctor agree on it has held
steady _ 62 percent in 1980, 61 percent now.
   The group saying no to abortions if the woman and her doctor
agree was 19 percent in 1980, 25 percent in early 1981, 22 percent
later in 1981 and 25 percent this year; with a 3-point error margin
and no annual figures through most of the 1980s, it is difficult to
discern a trend.
   In NBC News-Wall Street Journal polling, those saying decisions
on abortion should be left to a woman and her doctor made up 78
percent in 1980 and 72 percent this year. That also was within the
margin of error, and there was even less movement in the group, in
another question, that said abortion should not be illegal:
Sixty-one percent in 1982, 62 percent in 1989.
   Similarly, a Harris poll question since 1973 has asked if
respondents favor or oppose that year's U.S. Supreme Court ruling
legalizing abortion. Support was at 52 percent in 1973 _ and 56
percent this year.
   ``What we find is that people feel that a woman should have the
right to have an abortion, but they personally feel uncomfortable
about abortions,'' said Mary Klette, an NBC pollster. ``It's just a
very personal opinion, and no matter what happens, it doesn't
change.''

   An apologetic note was left in the car
of a winery worker before he allegedly slit the throats of his
three young daughters, court documents revealed Monday.
   The FBI, meanwhile, joined the hunt for Ramon Salcido, 28, who
was charged with four counts of murder and three counts of
attempted murder in Friday's rampage, which left seven dead.
Authorities said he may have fled to Mexico and acknowledged they
will have a tough time finding him.
   The note, written in Spanish, was found inside the
blood-splattered 1979 Ford that Salcido is believed to have been
driving before it was discovered abandoned in San Rafael Friday
afternoon.
   Police believe Salcido cut his daughters' throats later that
evening, killing two of them, at a garbage dump 15 miles north of
San Rafael.
   ``Forgive me God, but this law made me do it,'' said the note,
which was written in Spanish. ``We could live better, me and my
children, but what can I do.''
   Officials could not say what ``this law'' meant, but Salcido was
reportedly upset by a child-support court order last week.
   The note was filed in federal court Monday in support of the
FBI's request for an arrest warrant charging Salcido with unlawful
flight to avoid prosecution, which was granted by U.S. Magistrate
Frederick Woelflen.
   An FBI affidavit said investigators believed Salcido had escaped
to Mexico.
   ``We will finally locate him and get him, but it's hard work to
do that,'' said FBI spokesman Chuck Latting.
   Authorities assume Salcido went south ``because he's a Mexican
national. We know that last Christmas he visited Mexico. In
absolute, total honesty we have no indication which direction he
went,'' Latting said.
   ``I would be very surprised if he hung around. He could still be
in Sonoma County as far as we know.''
   Salcido, who comes from the Mexican state of Sinaloa, was
described by some acquaintances as friendly and well-mannered, and
by others as a paranoid cocaine user prone to violent outbursts.
   The slayings began with the deaths of his wife, his
mother-in-law, two of his wife's sisters, and one of his
co-workers. Two of his daughters, Teresa, 1, and Sofia, 4, were
found dead at a garbage dump Saturday.
   A third daughter, 3-year-old Carmina, was reported in stable
condition Monday at Petaluma Valley Hospital with a slashed throat.
Her grandfather, Bob Richards, visited her Monday and both were
protected by armed deputies.
   Salcido was charged with four counts of murder Monday in the
slayings of Mrs. Salcido, Teresa, Sofia and the co-worker. Murder
charges have not been filed yet in the other three killings.
   Salcido was also charged with three counts of attempted murder
in the attacks on Carmina, another co-worker and the co-worker's
wife.
   Although photos and descriptions of the 5-foot-9, 180-pound
Salcido have been circulated to California airports and border
guards, Sonoma County Sheriff Richard Michaelsen theorized that the
former Grand Cru winery worker hasn't strayed far from the murder
scenes in the lush wine-producing county north of San Francisco.
   ``My best guess is that he's laying low. We're assuming he's in
our county or in Marin County,'' the sheriff said.
   ``He may be holed up waiting for the media attention to ease up.
... Anybody who happens on his path is in extreme danger,''
Michaelsen said.
   Latting acknowledged that Salcido is believed to have extensive
contacts within the Hispanic community.
   ``It makes it tough,'' said Latting. ``I mean it's hard, dirty
work.''
   Salcido came the United States as an illegal immigrant, but
apparently became a legal resident after his 1984 marriage to the
former Angela Richards, who was a U.S. citizen, immigration
officials said.
   Grand Cru winery owners offered a $5,000 reward for information,
and another $10,000 was allocated by Gov. George Deukmejian on
Monday. Sonoma County Supervisor Janet Nicholson said she will ask
the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday to chip in $20,000 ``in hopes
that he (Salcido) will be apprehended before harming someone else.''
   Meanwhile, county residents have been unsettled by the killings.
   ``People are real scared around here,'' said Dorothy McCann, a
store clerk who lives in Glen Ellen with her boyfriend. ``We have a
loaded gun in the cupboard. People are just looking at each other.''
   The Los Angeles Times reported that the Salcido marriage became
severely strained after Salcido told his wife, three days before
her death, that he had been ordered to pay substantial child
support to an ex-wife in Fresno County _ a woman Angela Salcido had
known nothing about.
   ``Now I can get an annulment,'' next-door neighbor Steve Nielsen
quoted her as saying.
   Val Hansen, owner of the Valley of the Moon bar about a mile
from Salcido's dingy, one-bedroom home in Boyes, said he used to
see Salcido come in for a beer a couple of times a week.
   ``He was always nice, `Hello, how are you?' That sort of
thing,'' Hansen said. ``He never caused any sort of trouble. ... He
was always upbeat.''
   Hansen said Mrs. Salcido seldom came to the bar with her
husband, but sat primly at his side when she did. ``They never
fought or even bickered, maybe it was almost too perfect,'' he
recalled.
   Brian Mann, a clerk at the Boyes Hot Springs Food Center, said
Salcido told him he married Angela four years ago because she got
pregnant.

   Blood donations rose 10 percent last
year because many people wanted to take the accompanying compulsory
AIDS test discreetly, a drug industry newsletter.
   Researchers say many donors want to take the test for AIDS
antibodies ``without making it obvious,'' the Swiss pharmaceutical
industry's ``Health File'' said Monday. The bulletin did not
provide figures.
   Switzerland has the highest AIDS rate in Europe. World Health
Organization figures put the 1988 rate at 5.4 cases per 100,000
people, followed by France with 3.5 cases.
   Researchers found that many more people from high-risk groups,
such as homosexuals, prostitutes and drug addicts, come forward for
AIDS antibodies testing when authorities guarantee anonymity, the
monthly Swiss industry bulletin said.
   Testing positive for AIDS antibodies indicates the person tested
was exposed to the virus, though it does not mean the person has
the immunity-stripping disease.

<HEAD>Amnesty Challenges Report Clearing British Soldiers in Gibraltar
Deaths</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International today questioned an official
finding that cleared British soldiers in the shooting deaths of
three unarmed IRA members in Gibraltar. It said the inquest jury
acted on incomplete evidence. Amnesty noted that Spanish police,
who were involved in tracking the three to the Gibraltar border,
did not testify. It also cited conflicting testimony.
   Britain has faced persistent questions over the March 6, 1988
killing of Irish Republican Army members Mairead Farrell, Daniel
McCann and Sean Savage by a military unit believed to have been
flown in from Britain.
   The shootings stirred an international controversy.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's office said it saw the
Amnesty report, which was published today.
   ``As far as we are concerned the whole matter has been fully
considered (by the inquest) and we see no grounds for opening up a
fresh inquiry,'' said a spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The inquest jury ruled 9-2 in September that the killings were
lawful.
   Amnesty, a London-based, worldwide human rights organization and
winner of the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize, demanded anew that a judical
inquiry be made in the killings.
   Its report said the inquest in Gibraltar failed to allay
suspicions of ``an official policy of deliberate planned killings
of suspected members of armed opposition groups.''
   Amnesty sent three observers to the inquest, led by Stephen
Owen, a lawyer and ombudsman of British Columbia, Canada.
   Owen said in an interview Monday that he was not accusing the
British of stepping beyond the law. ``I'm saying doubt remains that
has to be resolved.''
   Amnesty said the inquest in the British colony of Gibraltar was
conducted properly and that the verdict reached fairly, but was
based on ``evidence which from the outset was incomplete.''
   Britain said it acted on information the three were armed and
planned to set off a car bomb in the middle of tourist-packed
Gibraltar, on the southern Spanish coast. The IRA, which is
fighting to rid Northern Ireland of British rule and unite it with
the Irish Republic, acknowledged the three were members sent to
Gibraltar ``on active service.''
   Testimony showed, however, that the three were unarmed; no bomb
was found in their car, and according to witnesses, at least two of
those killed appeared to be trying to surrender when shot.
   The government said the officers feared the agents might have
remote-control devices to explode the car bomb.
   Amnesty complained, ``Details about government policy, the
planning of the operation, and the quality of the intelligence were
not revealed.''
   It said Spanish police testimony could have helped establish
whether the three were known to be without guns or explosives.
   Much forensic evidence was destroyed ``because standard
procedures were not followed,'' and the state pathologist was
denied adequate post-mortem facilities and ballistics reports, it
said.
   The report added:
   ``Most of the key independent civilian eye witnesses were
discovered by media journalists and not by the police. ... The
organization is also concerned that discrepancies between
witnesses' testimonies had not been resolved and that many
questions remained unanswered such as ... from what exact position
the soldiers had fired, and whether the suspects had made attempts
to surrender.''
   It noted that police in Northern Ireland were accused before of
killing when they could have made arrests and said, ``The inquest
has again failed to alleviate public concern that these suspects
were killed rather than arrested.''
   Two weeks ago, British trial lawyer Hilary Kitchin, who also
observed the inquest, wrote that it fell short of international
legal standards and raised questions about the legality of the
killings.

<HEAD>Harsh Fallout Doubted From Premature Fusion Announcement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A premature claim by Georgia Tech scientists that
they created low-temperature fusion shows that researchers must be
careful about announcing their findings.
   ``There is a lot of pressure to advertise oneself in this
increasingly competitive world where research money is hard to come
by,'' said Dr. Arnold Relman, editor of the New England Journal of
Medicine.
   ``The public doesn't know what to think. There's a lot of
cynicism about science, a lot of time being wasted.''
   The Tech scientists' claim, the second such that was withdrawn
within the past year, has not prompted the school to put a tighter
rein on what its researchers announce, said Thomas Stelson, Tech's
executive vice president.
   ``We are fundamentally an open institution,'' he said.
``Academic freedom is a sort of a sacred issue. A faculty member
can do whatever he wants. We do not centrally review the hundreds
of papers that go out of here each year nor do we intend to.''
   The ``cold fusion'' claim was retracted two days after the
announcement when the researchers found there may have been
problems with instruments.
   ``My wildest guess is that it won't make any difference,'' said
Joseph Ford, a physics professor known as a dissident voice on the
faculty. ``The individuals who submitted (the experiment) have
something of a track record. I don't think most people will pay
much attention to the fact that they jumped the gun.''
   He said the school may have a temporary public relations
problem, especially because the announcement follows the premature
claim that Tech researchers had produced a metal alloy that could
function at record-high temperatures. Those results in
superconductivity could not be verified by other researchers and
the project was dropped.
   ``But alumni are not going to quit giving and agencies are not
going to quit funding,'' Ford said.
   He said the fact that the admission made the front page might
discourage others from jumping the gun.
   ``But if people wish to be reckless or careless, nothing
prevents that,'' Ford said.
   Officials at the National Academy of Science in Washington,
D.C., declined to speculate on what effects on the school might be.
   Stelson said Georgia Tech has a strong program in areas related
to the experiment and that the announcement should have no effect
on it.
   ``We have a good technical background and we would like to
contribute to this area,'' he said.
   The process of peer review is intended to find faulty methods or
reasoning that might render an experiment or discovery invalid
before the results are presented.
   While not foolproof, it substantially reduces the likelihood of
having to retract announced results.
   The discovery of cold fusion was announced March 23 by
scientists at the University of Utah. The process is seen as a
potential for cheap, clean and virtually inexhaustible supply of
energy.
   The Utah announcement sent scientists scurrying to build their
own versions of the process.
   Five Georgia Tech scientists led by James Mahaffey, using what
they knew from press accounts and computer bulletin boards, came up
with what they thought was a duplicate process.
   After a press conference announcing their work, it was
determined that problems with some equipment put the results in
doubt.
   ``We thought we had it all calibrated right but we found out
that one instrument was more temperature-sensitive than we
thought,'' Stelson said. ``We have new detectors. We're in the
process of checking them out in some detail.''

   Secret Service agents arrested a 37-year-old man
who called the White House to claim he could breach security
surrounding President Bush's visit Monday, and then left his
telephone number.
   Richard Gregory of Clinton Township was taken into custody at
Selfridge Field Air National Guard base as the president arrived
there to fly out of Michigan, said Jim Hughes, head of the Detroit
Secret Service office.
   Gregory had called the White House earlier Monday.
   ``He stated that he had a theory about how to penetrate the
security around the president. But in that theory, it involved a
man wearing a business suit and carrying a cellular telephone that
would actually be an explosive device,'' Hughes said.
   Gregory left his car telephone number, and police used it to
trace information about him, Hughes said. Officers were on the
lookout when Gregory arrived at Selfridge Field's main gate.
   ``When he was apprehended at the main gate of Selfridge, he was
carrying a cellular telephone. He had a briefcase also,'' Hughes
said.
   An ordnance squad from the base found no explosives after
examining the telephone and blowing apart the briefcase with a
water cannon.
   As Gregory arrived at the base, about 25 miles northeast of
Detroit, the president was arriving at a different gate, and was in
no danger, the agent said.
   Bush traveled to nearby Hamtramck to announce economic
incentives for Poland, speaking before about 4,000 people in this
largely Polish community.
   Agents have no idea why Gregory called the White House, but
treated him as though he were a threat to the president.
   ``When he called the tune, we played it,'' Hughes said.
   Gregory faces federal charges of interfering with a Secret
Service agent's duty. He later was questioned and detained by
Secret Service officials in Detroit and had not been formally
charged Monday night.

<TEXT>
   An Israeli army investigation
into the slayings of four Arabs during a raid by border police
indicates an ``excessive use of firearms, faulty planning and bad
execution.''
   The army on Monday released its preliminary findings of the
bloodshed Thursday in the village of Nahalin, four miles southwest
of Bethlehem.
   Villagers said two police snipers, firing from a second-story
window, killed three young Palestians and wounded several others.
   The International Red Cross denounced the raid.
   Although the initial army report was critical of the border
police, it denied allegations that the police had acted with
premeditation.
   An army spokesman said last week that the paramilitary border
police entered the village before dawn to apprehend residents
suspected of having thrown stones at Israeli cars. He claimed the
police opened fire when rocks were thrown at them.
   Villagers gave a different version.
   They said the raid began 5 a.m. as 22 jeeploads of border police
conducted house-to-house searches and fired indiscriminately as
many residents emerged from dawn prayers during Ramadan, the Moslem
holy month.
   ``They shot at anything that moved _ dogs, donkeys, people,
cars,'' said Naim Shakarneh, whose brother Subheh was among those
killed.
   The villagers said the worst violence occurred outside the
Azawieh mosque when worshipers heard the gunfire, ran into the
streets and began hurling rocks at the police.
   They blamed three deaths on two policemen who they said fired
from a building across the street from the mosque.
   Fatmeh Ibrahim Abu Mor, 28, who owns the building taken over by
the two officers, said they ordered her to let them in, went to a
window on the second floor ``and started shooting.'' She said after
the police left she found more than a dozen cartridges on the floor.
   Residents said the three Palestinians were killed within 20
yards of each other _ one on the roof of a low building, another
near the mosque and the third in the street beside a rock slab.
   The fourth Palestinian was killed in a cemetery across the
street from the mosque, according to the villages.
   Doctors at Jerusalem's Makassad Hospital said a fifth victim was
brain dead.
   It was one of the deadliest single incidents since Arabs in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip began an uprising against Israeli
occupation in December 1987.
   Rajah Shehadeh of Law in the Service of Man, a West Bank
affiliate of the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists,
called the Nahalin raid an act of ``willfull killing and bodily
harm.''
   He said Monday the group appealed to signatories of the Fourth
Geneva Convention, which deals with the protection of people in
occupied areas, ``to meet their clear obligation.''

   Baby boomers move over. Three guys in their 20s
are talking about their generation and promising to ``end the '60s
in your lifetime.''
   ``Let's make nostalgia a thing of the past!'' is the rallying
cry of the National Association for the Advancement of Time, whose
members say they're tired of the boomers' cultural agenda.
   ``There's so many of them. If they want to live in their past,
that's fine _ but they're forcing ME to live in their past,''
gripes Bruce Dillenburg, 29, of Chicago. He founded NAFTAT with
friends Bruce Elliott of Los Angeles and John Keeney of New York
City.
   Here's a sampling from Dillenburg's long list of complaints:
   Movies _ ``The Big Chill.''
   Theater _ the revival of ``Hair.''
   Television _ ``The Wonder Years.''
   Books _ volumes on the riotous 1968 Democratic National
Convention in Chicago, ``as insignificant an event as ever happened

   Dillenburg and Elliott got together in 1987 and discovered their
mutual exasperation with ``oldies'' radio. They decided it was time
to get the Monkees off their backs.
   Preserve what is worth remembering from the '60s _ the Beatles,
Bob Dylan and the civil rights movement, for example _ and scrap
the rest, Dillenburg suggests.
   NAFTAT is part of a natural anti-boomer backlash, according to
Northwestern University sociologist Bernard Beck. He says any
cultural statement that lasts too long ``seems to generate
resentment.''

   Don Roberts may not be rich, but he knows
how to get to the gold faster than anyone else.
   Roberts, of Diamond Bar, Calif., won Sunday's 27th annual speed
gold-panning contest with a time of 7.55 seconds _ an unofficial
world record, according to the contest's organizers.
   The old record was 9.23 seconds, set in 1985 by Bob Box of
Ahwahee, Calif.
   The contest tests a person's ability to swiftly sift through a
pan of sand and leave eight clean nuggets. It had been held for a
quarter-century in Rosamond, Calif., but was moved last year to
Dahlonega, site of an 1828 gold rush, the nation's first.
   Roberts' victory kept the contest trophy in the family. His
father, Jack, took home the gold last year with a time of 12.73
seconds.
   ``I think this record will stand for at least five to 10
years,'' the father said. ``There was a lot of history set here
today. This is going to become a big national event.''
   His son wasn't so sure.
   ``I've seen pans in practice as fast as five seconds so until
the record gets down to five seconds, I can't see it lasting,'' he
said.

   As if New York weren't expensive enough. The
cost of loving it is going up.
   The state, after years of allowing manufacturers free use of the
``I Love New York'' logo, will start charging royalties this year.
   People who print the logo on sweatshirts, keychains, pens or
other consumer goods will be forced to give New York state between
6 and 10 percent of the money they make, said Stephen Morello, a
state deputy commissioner for economic development.
   The state has spent more than $100 million advertising itself to
tourists since beginning the ``I Love New York'' advertising
campaign in 1977, he said.
   ``We think this is one modest way to begin recapturing some of
the investment without negatively impacting the motto's
effectiveness,'' Morello said.
   The state registered the motto with a red heart symbol in place
of the word ``love.'' Though the symbol has been adapted for a
variety of bumper stickers and other uses, the state only holds the
trademark for loving New York.

<HEAD>U.S. Group Opens Office In Panama To Watch Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. organization that sent
American observers to the Philippines for that country's disputed
1986 elections has opened an office in Panama to monitor the May 7
general elections.
   The government, however, issued a statement Monday warning that
it had not authorized any foreign organization to open electoral
information offices but stopped short of saying it intended to
close the Center for Democracy office.
   Allen Weinstein, president of the Washington-based center, told
a news conference that his organization's goal is to help bring
about ``national reconciliation'' and democracy in Panama.
   A letter signed by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of
the Senate subcommittee on hemispheric affairs, said the opening of
the office demonstrates the U.S. government's worry about whether
Panama's government will live up to its promises to hold free
elections.
   Weinstein said the office will give out ``informal and
unofficial information'' about ``all phases of the electoral
process.''
   The Center for Democracy includes Republican and Democratic
party leaders and senators.
   Panama said it had invited election observers from Antigua,
Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Jamaica and Nicaragua.
   Relations between the United States and Panama have deteriorated
since Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's de facto leader, was
indicted by a court in Florida on drug-running charges in February
1988.
   President Eric Arturo Delvalle then tried to fire Noriega, but
the general orchestrated Delvalle's ouster. The United States has
imposed economic sanctions on Panama through April 1990, but
President Bush said the sanctions could be modified if the
elections are fair.
   The Center for Democracy was founded in 1984.

   Failure to improve the U.S. educational system
could saddle America's economy with ``enormous long-term costs,''
the congressional Joint Economic Committee said today in its first
bipartisan report since 1980.
   America is falling behind the rest of the world in promoting
literacy and job skills even though it already spends more money
per student than any other country in the world, the committee said.
   While the panel did not break any new ground in recommending
solutions to education problems or others facing the economy, it
was able for the first time in nine years to issue a bipartisan
report, supported by both Democrats and Republicans on the
20-member committee.
   During the Reagan years, the panel of senators and House members
became a battleground of warring economic ideologies with Democrats
and Republicans unable to reach any common ground.
   Members of the panel gave credit for the show of unity to Rep.
Lee Hamilton, the new chairman of the committee. Hamilton had
pushed hard for a joint report as the proper congressional response
to President Bush's calls for a bipartisan effort to address the
huge federal budget deficit and the country's other economic
problems.
   Hamilton, D-Ind., said members of the committee agreed that the
most crucial thing Congress and the administration need to do is
address the federal budget deficit.
   ``Realistic and prudent budgeting should be our top economic
priority,'' Hamilton said.
   The report, however, did not provide any specifics on how the
gap between revenues and spending should be narrowed.
   On education, the report cited statistics showing that the
country has an overall dropout rate of 25 percent, with rates for
blacks hitting 40 percent and for Hispanics exceeding 50 percent.
Partly as a result, approximately 13 percent of 17-year-old
Americans cannot read, write or count, the report said.
   The committee said ``education is perhaps the most prominent
area where our nation's shortcomings threaten to impose enormous
long-term costs.''
   ``If we are to keep up with the rest of the industrialized
world, we must do much better in promoting literacy, job skills and
reducing the rate of elementary and secondary school dropouts,''
the panel concluded.
   During the Reagan administration, the Democratic portion of the
report stressed the country's plunging international fortunes,
citing huge trade deficits and the emergence of the country as the
world's largest debtor nation as evidence that Reagan's economic
policies were not working.
   The Republicans on the panel would counter that Democrats were
being unduly pessimistic in failing to give Reagan's policies
credit for the longest peacetime expansion in history, a recovery
from the 1981-82 recession which is now in its seventh year.
   Sen. William Roth, the ranking Republican on the committee,
praised Hamilton for taking a more conciliatory approach this year.
   ``By recognizing the economy's strengths, we are able to discuss
concerns as well,'' Roth, R-Del., said in a statement which
accompanied the report.
   Some Democratic members of the panel said they were concerned
that in trying to reach agreement, the committee had glossed over
serious problems.
   Four Democratic members of the panel, Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins,
D-Calif., and Sens. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md.; Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas;
and Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., filed statements raising concerns about
specific problems.
   Bentsen noted that the U.S. merchandise trade deficit, which
improved dramatically in 1988, is expected to worsen again this
year, ``exacerbating our dependence on foreign capital and causing
U.S. foreign debt to balloon beyond $600 billion.''
   Sarbanes, the past chairman of the joint committee, said he was
concerned that the report ``conveys an inappropriate sense of
complacency.''
   ``Over the past decade, we have created unprecedented imbalances
_ in the budget, in international trade, in the accumulation of
both domestic and international debt _ which suggest we are skating
on very thin ice,'' Sarbanes said.
   Among the economic problems which should be addressed, the
report cited rising inflationary pressures, the pace of
productivity increases, the financial problems facing the savings
and loan industry, the Third World debt crisis and rising levels of
debt among American corporations and consumers.
   In addition to more resources for education, the report cited
research and development on new technologies, environmental
cleanup, poverty and homelessness as areas where additional
resources are needed.

<HEAD>More Americans Voted Overseas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A smaller proportion of Americans voted in
last year's presidential election than in 1984, but the rate went
up for those who voted while abroad, according to the head of the
Federal Voting Assistance Program.
   Henry Valentino said the overseas rate rose to 35.3 percent from
33 percent four years earlier, based on an estimate that 2.5
million civilian Americans were outside the country on Election Day.
   But despite the improvement, that rate was still lower than the
overall turnout, which was 50 percent.
   ``It's because so many Americans abroad don't know they're
allowed to vote, or find it too much trouble to get an absentee
ballot,'' Valentino said in an interview. ``It's not like just
going down to the corner polling place.''
   He added that the increase last year was due to efforts made by
both political parties to get out the vote.
   Many states have slow and complex procedures for issuing
absentee ballots, especially to Americans who live in other
countries. Some voters mail in their ballots too late for them to
reach election boards in time to be counted.
   Valentino calculated that 21 House seats and eight Senate seats
could have been decided by the absentee vote.
   Of the roughly 750,000 members of the armed forces stationed
abroad, 63.2 percent voted, compared with 55.3 percent in 1984.
Valentino credited ``intensive and aggressive voting assistance''
by the military for the high rate among that group.
   Valentino's office is part of the Department of Defense, but is
responsible for helping both the military and civilians overseas to
vote.
   Older soldiers, like older civilians at home, were more likely
to vote. In the armed forces only 46.2 percent of the 18- to
20-year-olds turned in ballots, compared with 71.6 percent for
those 45 and older.
   Each military unit has an officer responsible for helping get
out the vote. Valentino said their efforts were visible in an even
bigger increase of voting by dependents of Americans in the armed
forces _ spouses, grown children and other relatives in their
households. That rate jumped to 57 percent from only 27.6 percent
four years earlier.
   Voting by the 200,000 civilian employees of the U.S. government
abroad and their dependents also increased, rising to 64.5 percent
from 57.5 percent in 1984.
   But in general, a smaller proportion of Americans vote than do
residents of other countries with unrestricted elections.
   ``I used to say it was fewer than in any country except
Botswana,'' said Curtis Gans, head of the Committee for the Study
of the American Electorate.
   ``Now I understand that Botswana is ahead of us.''

   A pipe bomb exploded at a K mart department
store Monday night, seriously injuring a 5-year-old girl,
authorities said.
   Only about 50 shoppers were in the store when the bomb went off
and no other injuries were reported, but the mother of the child
was treated for fainting, police said. The source of the bomb was
not immediately known.
   The victim, Erin Bower of Indianapolis, lost four fingers and
half of her left hand in the explosion, and also suffered facial,
eye and abdominal injuries, authorities said.
   She was taken to Methodist Hospital, where she was listed in
stable condition before undergoing surgery, hospital spokesman
David Richards said. The explosion occurred about 7:50 p.m. at a K
mart in northeast Indianapolis, said a spokesman for the Castleton
Fire Department. There was no fire.
   Scott Minier, a spokesman for the Marion County Sheriff's
department, described the bomb as having a ``pressure-sensitive
release.'' He said it was concealed among packages of trash bags in
the hardware section toward the rear of the store.
   ``We believe it was in another box stashed in the trash bags,''
Minier said. Police dogs trained to sniff out bombs were searching
the store late Monday.
   Minier said there were no bomb threats or any other warning that
the bomb would explode.
   Louis M. Profeta, a medical student at Indiana University, said
he was shopping with his girlfriend when the explosion occurred.
   ``We were a few aisles away, we heard a loud muffled explosion,
like a large balloon exploding,'' Profeta said. ``Then we saw a
cloud of smoke and flaming debris shoot up in the air. I went
running toward the area then I thought it might be a gunshot blast,
so I stopped.''
   Profeta said all of the shoppers in the store and the K mart
employees scrambled for the door after hearing the explosion. Then
he and another shopper with some medical training went to help the
girl.
   ``I saw the little girl, her clothes were on fire and the mother
was screaming. Both father and mother were covered in blood,''
Profeta said. ``We rendered first aid and got the father and mother
away, then got her stabilized.''

<HEAD>Lower Prices for Spices Reported as Pepper Loses Ground</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cost of importing pepper and other spices
favored by Americans as food seasonings has tumbled sharply, but
it's still nothing to sneeze at, says the Agriculture Department.
   Last year's import bill was $349.4 million for 191,545 metric
tons of assorted spices, ranging from allspice and anise to
turmeric and vanilla beans. That was down from a record $438.6
million and 208,694 tons in 1987.
   ``It's not an indication that the trend in spice consumption is
being reversed,'' says Rex Dull of the department's Foreign
Agricultural Service. ``Rather, it was a technical correction ...
primarily involving pepper imports.''
   Pepper is the biggest item on the U.S. list of spice imports.
Most is black pepper but there is a substantial amount of white. In
1988, unground black pepper imports were valued at $95.2 million
for 26,939 tons, compared with $147.8 million for 31,372 tons in
1987.
   Indonesia was the biggest supplier last year, followed by India
and Brazil.
   Some relief for the pepper supply was provided in January by the
Food and Drug Administration when it eased an 18-month-old policy
of automatic detention of shipments from India until those had been
checked for possible salmonella contamination. The Indian
government can now certify that pepper meets FDA standards.
   Dull, who works in the agency's horticultural and tropical
products division, said in a recent telephone interview that for
several years global pepper supplies were tight and prices high.
   In 1987, for example, the price of Indonesian black pepper was a
12-month average of just over $2.37 per pound delivered to New York
City. Indian black pepper was almost as high.
   ``There was anticipation that the supply would improve and
prices come down,'' Dull said. ``Prices did come down in part of
1988, but there was fear that drought would reduce India's harvest
and they came back up late in the year.''
   But the increase wasn't nearly as great as the runup of pepper
prices in the mid-1980s. Until September 1985, the New York spot
price of Indian black pepper was less than a dollar per pound.
   Last October, the New York price dropped to an average for the
month of 99.5 cents, the first time in more than three years that
it had been less than a dollar. However, prices quickly regained
lost ground and in March averaged $1.59 per pound.
   Dull is the author of the USDA agency's latest annual report on
1988 spice trade. The report, issued this week, noted that while
pepper was the main reason for reduced imports, there were other
items also affected.
   ``High prices and producer-government controlled marketing
practices have tempered the demand for cassia, nutmeg and mace,''
the report said. ``Smaller crops have resulted in higher prices for
mustard seed, saffron, sesame seed, paprika and Pakistani chili
peppers.''
   Prices of anise, cloves and Java vanilla beans were down,
however, the report said.

   Soybean farmers like to think of foreign
buyers in giant terms, like Japan or Western Europe, but an
Agriculture Department report suggests a shrimp can be a pretty
good customer, too.
   Daryl A. Brehm, U.S. agricultural attache in Jakarta, Indonesia,
says there is a promising outlook for selling more U.S. soybeans to
that Southeast Asian country to feed an expanding shrimp industry.
   ``Exports (of shrimp) are rising, and the potential for
increased production barely has been scratched,'' Brehm says in the
forthcoming May issue of AgExporter magazine published by the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
   ``More efficient production methods would call for increased
soybean and soybean meal imports, which make up a portion of
commercial shrimp feeds,'' he said. ``U.S. exports of these items
to Indonesia could benefit from this modernization.''
   The country now has about 250,000 hectares of brackish shrimp
ponds, with a potential to expand to 3 million hectares, and fresh
water ponds _ now covering only 33,000 hectares _ could expand to 1
million, Brehm said. A hectare is about 2.47 acres.
   Indonesian shrimp exports were worth more than $300 million last
year, with Japan taking about 80 percent. And, even with declining
international prices, ``returns from well-managed production are
lucrative, with reports of 100 percent profits not uncommon,'' he
said.
   The American Soybean Association has been providing technical
help to Indonesian shrimp farmers, advocating ``a semi-intensive
system that requires a relatively small capital outlay,'' Brehm
said. A relatively low-cost pelleted feed could be used.
   At present, less than 10 percent of the Indonesian shrimp
farmers used a commercial feed. The association concluded that a
lower-cost feed and education programs could revolutionize the
production of shrimp in Indonesia _ and boost the sales of U.S.
soybeans.

   Decades-long friendships with a convicted
felon and a wealthy Texas developer could prove to be the undoing
for House Speaker Jim Wright, who faces charges he violated 69 of
the chamber's rules.
   The names of William Carlos Moore and George Mallick were
frequently mentioned as the House ethics committee's outside
counsel, Richard J. Phelan, detailed the charges against Wright in
his 279-page report.
   The committee said Monday it found ``reason to believe'' the
Texas Democrat skirted House rules limiting outside income,
requiring reporting of gifts, and barring acceptance of gifts from
peoplr with a direct interest in legislation.
   Specifically, the committee alleged that Wright had ``an overall
scheme'' to evade House limits on outside earned income by selling
bulk quantities of his book, ``Reflections of a Public Man'' to
groups to which he had delivered speeches. The honorarium payments
_ which are limited under House rules _ were characterized as
royalties.
   The book was the brainchild of Wright and Moore, who envisioned
a collection of the speaker's earlier speeches, poems and writings
which ``would be sold at low cost to a very broad audience
including college students and `average citizens,''' said Phelan's
report.
   But the book rarely made it into the hands of ``average
citizens.''
   ``The real focus of the marketing effort for Reflections of a
Public Man was on bulk sales to trade associations and other
groups,'' the report said. ``Almost 98 percent of all sales ...
were bulk sales of 15 or more books.''
   Wright's friendship with Moore dates back to 1954 when Moore
worked for the Texan's first congressional campaign, handing out
campaign literature and canvassing voters door-to-door.
   In 1963, Moore became political and legislative director of the
Texas Conference of Teamsters, and later served in Washington as
the union's director of political and legislative action. In that
role, Moore ``reported directly to Teamsters President James H.
Hoffa.'' The former union president disappeared July 30, 1975, and
his body has never been found.
   In 1975, Moore pleaded guilty to one count of income tax evasion
and the government in return agreed not to prosecute him for income
tax evasion in 1968 and 1969 or for misappropriation of Teamsters'
funds for personal use.
   Two days before his sentencing, Wright wrote to the judge asking
for leniency for Moore.
   ``It is without reservation that I now ask the court, on Mr.
Moore's behalf, to take into consideration the obvious value to us
all of Mr. Moore's continued presence in our communities,'' Wright
wrote.
   Moore served 4{ months of a two-year sentence in federal prison.
   Mallick, a Fort Worth real estate developer, first met Wright in
1962 or 1963 when the congressman cut the ribbon opening a shopping
center in the state's Tarrant County, the report said.
   Over the next 20 years, the relationship between the two men was
mainly social although Mallick worked on Wright's campaigns and he
and his sons have been longtime members of the Wright Congressional
Club.
   As a developer, Mallick put forth the ``Mallick Concept'' of
inexpensive apartments for single or newly-married people that in
square footage were about the size of a House trailer.
   In 1979, Mallick formed the Mallight Investment Corporation
which was owned by Mallick, his wife, Marlene, and Betty and Jim
Wright. The company, which later changed its name to Mallightco,
was created ``for the purposes of acquiring and developing real
estate, buying and selling securities and making other
investments,'' the report said.
   Betty Wright was placed on the Mallightco payroll in 1981 as a
consultant ``hired to seek out and research new investment
opportunities,'' according to Phelan's report. Mallick and Mrs.
Wright looked into investments involving converting sugar cane to
alcohol, making bulgar wheat cakes and joining a limited
partnership backing the movie, ``Annie.''
   The committee found, however, that Mrs. Wright did little work
to warrant her $18,000-a-year salary, which proved to be a
financial burden for the company. Mallightco often had to borrow
money or delay payment to provide Mrs. Wright with her salary.
   ``Mallick has produced no work product created by Mrs. Wright as
an employee of Mallightco _ no reports, no correspondence, no notes
of telephone conversations, no investment analyses,'' the report
said.
   In addition, Mrs. Wright's background as a member of the staff
of the House Public Works Committee and executive secretary of a
leading Fort Worth hotel did not make her qualified to evaluate
possible investments, the report said.
   ``Mrs. Wright's salary from Mallightco was not a bona fide
salary, but rather a gift indirectly from Mallick to Jim Wright
through two intermediaries _ Mallightco and Mrs. Wright,'' it said.
   In total, Mallick improperly provided Wright with $145,000 in
gifts over a 10-year period, according to the charges, and the
committee found that the Fort Worth developer had a direct interest
in legislation before Congress.

   The ethics report on House Speaker Jim Wright
lets him off the hook on some of the most serious allegations that
were made against him, giving him a better chance of winning the
public debate on his case.
   On the long list of charges investigated by the ethics
committee, potentially the most serious involved misuse of public
office and of public money. Those have been dismissed.
   What's left are nearly six dozen charges involving Wright's
rather unusual personal finances.
   The speaker had a sweet book publishing deal where he received
55 percent of the royalties and sold his book in bulk to interest
groups. The committee says that may have been a deliberate scheme
to evade limits on outside income, from which royalties are exempt.
   And a business partner supplied the speaker with a home in Fort
Worth, a car, and an $18,000-year job for his wife. The committee
classified those as gifts that the speaker failed to report.
   The most serious remaining charge is the committee's belief that
the business partner, George Mallick, had an interest in
legislation. If it finds that to be the case, those gifts not only
were not reported, they were against the rules.
   But that most serious charge may also be the weakest, in that
the committee found Mallick had an interest in legislation only in
a very broad sense. It did not find that Wright did legislative
favors that specifically helped Mallick, or that Mallick sought
such favors.
   Wright's allies were cheered by the report.
   ``There's nothing new here,'' said Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas,
part of Wright's informal defense team. ``I think the speaker
clearly will be found innocent.''
   Given the higher standard of proof needed for the panel to
determine that Wright did, indeed, violate House rules, Rep. Beryl
Anthony, D-Ark., speculated that the charges might die in committee.
   Also working in Wright's favor is the decision by House
Republicans to lay low for the time being, for fear of appearing as
shrill accusers who can't wait for the next step: the speaker's
rebuttal to the committee.
   The Republican rhetorical calm gives Wright the opportunity to
seize the spotlight to his advantage. Those efforts have already
begun.
   On the question of the book deal, Wright is pointing to the
specific exemption that book royalties enjoy under House rules.
   And on the question of gifts, the speaker is playing his trump
card _ transforming the issue by characterizing the committee
report as an attack on his wife and vowing to defend her honor.
   The speaker is making these points in carefully-controlled
televised settings, and he has canceled his regular pre-session
news conferences so he doesn't get his point dulled by fussy
questions from reporters.
   Wright's biggest public relations test could come when the
ethics committee hears his rebuttal to its charges. Those hearings
could well be public and the speaker will surely have to provide
good answers to some very tough questions.
   A strong performance, one that gains him support from the
general public, could help carry Wright's career forward even if
the committee finds him guilty of some relatively minor violations.
   A bad showing could help bring him down, even if he's exonerated
by the committee.
   Republicans are ready to apply the same ``fitness to serve''
test that Democrats applied to John Tower _ an argument that the
accumulated evidence is enough even if no single item can bring him
down. And they intend to make the full House vote on Wright's
ethics, regardless of the committee conclusion.
   One thing is clear: Wright's survival will require a marathon
effort on his part.
   Awaiting committee action behind the current set of charges are
others, some potentially more serious.
   The panel is still investigating a joint investment by Mallick
and Wright in an oil and gas well that seemed unusually profitable
despite the limited apparent value of the well itself.
   And in a separate ethics case which has so far been on the back
burner, Wright has been accused of improper public disclosure of
CIA covert action in Nicaragua.
   Wright told reporters last summer that he had ``clear
testimony'' from CIA people that the agency sought to stir up civil
unrest in Nicaragua with hopes of provoking a harsh crackdown by
the leftist Sandinista government. Republican members of the
intelligence committee and others cried foul.
   So far, Democrats are sticking with Wright and there's no clear
evidence that he's costing the party votes. The Democrats recently
won two special elections to fill vacant House seats, including one
in Vice President Dan Quayle's old Indiana district.
   But as the next election grows closer, and the Wright case gets
more national exposure, Democrats will be watching the polls.
   It may not be enough for the ethics committee to let Wright off
the hook _ if he wins that battle. The speaker's challenge for the
coming months must be finding ways to win favor with the public.

   In a June 1984 White House discussion on
whether to solicit third-country support for the Nicaraguan
Contras, George Bush foresaw potential trouble for the Reagan
administration.
   ``The only problem that might come up,'' the then-vice president
said, ``is if the United States were to promise to give these third
parties something in return so that some people could interpret
this as some kind of an exchange.''
   But as disclosures at Oliver North's trial have shown, Bush,
wittingly or unwittingly, quickly became involved in quid pro quo
arrangements with third countries as part of an administration
effort to help the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Bush has refused to comment on his role in the Contra support
network, saying he doesn't want to prejudice North's trial. But the
questions raised by disclosures in North's trial are unlikely to go
away without an eventual response by the president.
   In depicting North as a mere cog in a huge machine aimed at
keeping the Contras alive, North's lawyers have disclosed that:
   _Nine months after Bush pinpointed the problem that could result
from enticing countries to support the Contras, he met with
Honduran President Robert Suazo Cordova. Bush announced expedited
delivery of U.S. military and economic aid to the Central American
country.
   _The month before Bush's visit, President Reagan had approved a
secret quid pro quo plan slipping more than $110 million in extra
assistance to Honduras in exchange for its continued support of the
Contras.
   _Bush was copied in to receive a Feb. 19, 1985, memo
recommending the approach to Honduras that ``provides incentives
for them to persist in aiding the freedom fighters.''
   _A Feb. 20, 1985, memo contained the notation ``we want VP to
also discuss this matter'' next to a discussion of the quid pro quo
arrangement.
   _Bush was copied in on another memo dated May 1, 1985, in which
Reagan approved a $4.5 million increase in CIA support for Honduras.
   After Bush at the June 25, 1984, meeting spelled out the
potential trouble, Reagan minutes later closed the discussion with
an admonition for secrecy.
   ``If such a story gets out, we'll all be hanging by our thumbs
in front of the White House until we find out who did it,'' Reagan
said, according to a record of the meeting released at North's
trial.
   Reagan's periodic cautions to aides that third-country Contra
assistance shouldn't be revealed were largely adhered to until
North's trial on charges of trying to cover up various aspects of
the Iran-Contra affair.
   The congressional Iran-Contra committees uncovered third-country
support for the Contras, but failed to show that the Reagan
administration enticed the countries into providing it.
   The rewards for Honduras were part of the approach the Reagan
administration made to at least 11 countries seeking help for the
Contras, the North trial has shown.
   The Honduran deal and some other quid pro quo arrangements
spelled out in the courtroom took place before the Pell amendment
took effect in October 1985. It barred U.S. officials from
agreeing, ``expressly or impliedly,'' that foreign aid or military
assistance to any third country would be conditioned on assistance
to the Contras.
   Versions of the Boland Amendment in effect from October 1984 to
October 1986 banned military aid by U.S. intelligence agencies to
the Contras.
   Reagan's interpretation of the Boland amendment, according to
testimony at North's trial by national security Robert McFarlane,
is that it simply didn't apply to the National Security Council
where North worked.
   But North and others saw the Honduran deal as a possible
violation of the Boland amendment, as reflected in a Feb. 20, 1985,
memo by North and NSC aide Raymond Burghardt.
   ``Notwithstanding our own interpretations (of the Boland
amendment), it is very clear from the colloquy during the
(congressional) debate ... that the legislative intent was to deny
any direct or indirect support for the military-paramilitary
operations in Nicaragua,'' said the memo.
   North and Burghardt objected that the State Department was going
to have the U.S. ambassador to Honduras, John Negroponte, deliver
word of the arrangement to the Honduran president. North and others
had proposed a secret emissary, who would be unlikely to be called
before Congress.
   ``Negroponte, who will be called upon to testify during his
confirmation hearings for assistant secretary, will undoubtedly be
queried on whether or not such overtures were made to the
Hondurans'' after the Boland amendment went in effect, said the
memo.
   ``In short, the decision to proceed without an emissary places
both Amb. Negroponte and our hopes with the Hill at increased
jeopardy. We still believe that our original concept of an emissary
is the proper way in which to proceed.''

<HEAD>NRC Votes to Let Peach Bottom Plant Restart</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will be
watching closely when Pennsylvania's Peach Bottom nuclear plant
starts up for the first time since on-the-job sleeping by operators
prompted the shutdown of the two plant reactors.
   The NRC voted 3-0 Monday to lift an order that had kept the
plant closed since March 31, 1987, when the commission said
sleeping and inattention by 33 control room workers posed a safety
threat to the public.
   ``The operators must never again betray the special trust and
countenance of the public,'' NRC Chairman Lando Zech told utility
representatives. ``We will be watching you very closely.''
   Plant officials must complete a checklist of technical items
before beginning the ascension to full power, which will take 14
weeks and be closely scrutinized by NRC inspectors.
   The process is expected to begin as early as Thursday with the
withdrawal of control rods, allowing a nuclear reaction to occur.
   Management changes by Philadelphia Electric have successfully
addressed the ``root causes'' of the earlier problems, the NRC
staff said in recommending that the commissioners permit the plant
to restart.
   Many of the problems at Peach Bottom occurred on the overnight,
or ``graveyard'' shift. On at least two occasions, according to NRC
testimony in 1987, three of the four control room employees
responsible for running the plant were asleep at the same time.
   To end catnaps by operators, plant officials replaced
comfortable, high-backed chairs in the control room with low-backed
models. The NRC noted Monday that the control room was ``brighter''
than in 1987, that low levels of radioactivity had been reduced
within the plant, and that operators had a better appearance.
   Of 39 operators now at the plant, 24 were there at the time of
the shutdown, and all have been retrained.
   A year after the shutdown, James L. Everett stepped down as the
chairman and chief executive officer of Philadelphia Electric Co.,
the plant operator, following criticism of the handling of Peach
Bottom.
   Philadelphia Electric spokesman Bill Jones said there was no
celebration at the plant marking the end of the shutdown, which
cost the company about $250 million in plant modifications,
purchases of replacement power, and its share of a $1.25 million
fine.
   The fine, largest in NRC history, was split among Philadelphia
Electric and the plant's other three owners. The others are Public
Service Gas and Electric of Newark, N.J.; Atlantic Electric Co. of
Atlantic City, N.J.; and Delmarva Power and Light Co. of
Wilmington, Del.
   Philadelphia Electric learned a valuable management lesson about
monitoring nuclear reactors, ``but it certainly has been an
expensive lesson,'' Joseph Paquette Jr., the company's chairman and
chief executive officer, said after the vote.
   Peach Bottom operates two units on the Susquehanna River near
the Maryland border. The NRC's action on Monday means one reactor
will be able to restart, with the other remaining dormant until the
company seeks to restart it in September.
   NRC Commissioner James Curtis missed Monday's meeting because he
was out of the country. Commissioner Kenneth Rogers did not vote
because he once served on the board of one of the plant's owners,
the NRC said.

   Gasoline prices around the country rose
suddenly after the Exxon Valdez spilled 10 million gallons of oil
in Alaska, but Exxon and a government energy official told a Senate
hearing the accident wasn't the reason.
   That wasn't enough to convince Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,
who criticized other oil companies for passing up an invitation to
appear Monday before his Energy subcommittee on energy regulation
and conservation.
   ``You have an amazing burden of proof to convince the American
people that the oil companies didn't exploit the Valdez accident,''
Metzenbaum said. ``I also invited Arco, Mobil, Chevron, BP, Texaco,
Shell and Amoco, and I regret their failure to appear.''
   In the three weeks following the spill, gasoline prices jumped
10 to 30 cents a gallon across the country.
   Tracy Stanton, a Shell service station owner in Columbus, Ohio,
said in his 20 years of business he has never seen such a rapid
increase in gasoline prices in such a short period of time,
including during the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s.
   J.T. McMillan, senior vice president of Exxon, told the Senate
subcommittee: ``The idea that Exxon raised prices to profit from
that spill is completely unfounded. The marketplace will not permit
any unusual costs incurred by a particular supplier, like the costs
necessary to clean up the oil spill in Alaska, to be recovered in
the marketplace.''
   Although the Alaskan oil spill temporarily affected the price of
crude oil to the West Coast, the price of gasoline has been
increasing for several months overall because the cost of crude oil
has been rising, he said.
   W. Henson Moore, deputy secretary of the Department of Energy,
agreed with McMillan that prices had been rising before the
accident.
   Moore said that the spill and the oil lost because of the
five-day shutdown of shipping from Prince William Sound amounted to
about 13 million barrels, but he said the loss ``had no lasting or
permanent effect on gasoline prices.''
   The oncoming summer driving season, increased regulations,
higher cost imports and added excise taxes were other contributors
to higher prices, McMillan said.
   Metzenbaum and others on the panel pressed the energy deputy
secretary for a deeper explanation of increasing prices, but he
said complete data were unavailable and the department was still
analyzing the situation.
   Stanton, the service station operator from Ohio, blamed ``oil
company greed'' and the control the major oil companies have gained
at the refinery level and by increasing their number of
company-operated service stations. Stanton is the former president
of the Service Station Dealers of America.
   The senator criticized Exxon's plan to deduct the costs of
cleaning up the spill from the taxes they pay the federal
government.
   ``For every dollar they (Exxon) spend, the taxpayer will pick up
34 cents,'' said Metzenbaum. ``Why shouldn't Exxon foot the bill?''
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., has introduced a bill that would
prevent the deductions, which Exxon said were a legitimate business
loss allowed in the tax code as a deduction.

   Imagine a road from Los Angeles to
Phoenix, Ariz., 30 feet wide and coated with 4,200 gallons of oily
black slime per mile. Now slop the goop onto remote beaches and
coves along Prince William Sound.
   The Exxon Valdez tanker wreck has left about that much oil on
the sound's once pristine shoreline _ Exxon figures it at 366
miles. And the giant corporation has won federal approval for its
plan to clean it up.
   But the ambitious strategy revealed Monday faces sharp
skepticism and new demands that it be broadened to include other
polluted areas. Some officials just smiled sadly when asked its
chance of success.
   The plan calls for a mobilization by early June of 4,000 people
and scores of vessels. By Sept. 15, they're supposed to erase the
tarry remains of the nation's worst oil spill from the rocky
beaches of one of the world's richest regions for fish and wildlife.
   Adm. Paul Yost, the head of the Coast Guard, approved the
proposal Monday. But he wondered if Exxon could meet its goals in
the face of the sound's notorious weather and the limited time
available.
   ``I'm concerned whether the level of activity can be kept up
through the summer to complete cleanup,'' said Yost, who demanded
the plan last week.
   Dennis Kelso, commissioner of the Alaska Department of
Environmental Conservation, described it as barely adequate.
   ``It needs more work,'' he said, adding it would be next week
before he would comment on whether he believed it would work.
   Yost, overseeing the cleanup at President Bush's direction,
listened to the concerns of Kelso and other state officials. He
then gave Exxon until May 1 to come up with plans to deal with oil
contamination outside the sound and disposal of oily waste.
   ``The plan will be expanded to add in these other concerns,''
said Exxon spokesman Don Cornett.
   He said that on Saturday, Exxon would field its first landing
craft equipped to work on the spill.
   But Exxon consultant Ed Owens said that initially, more time
would be spent on training than cleaning.
   ``I don't think you should expect a big parade and fireworks on
that day,'' he said. ``If you get out there, you'll see something
happening.''
   The 987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez sumped more than 10 million
gallons of crude oil into the sound after it ran aground on Bligh
Reef on March 24. The company has been criticized for its initial
response.
   Oil now stretches along Alaska's south-central coast for
hundreds of miles. Scores of beaches and miles of shore in the
sound are sticky black wastelands, and parts of the Kenai Fjords
National Park and other areas in the Gulf of Alaska have been
contaminated.
   Exxon estimates 4,200 gallons of oil per mile are on the sound
shoreline _ 1,260 gallons per mile in the lightly oiled spots to as
much as 12,600 gallons per mile. The shore averages 30 feet wide.
   State officials have identified more than 50 beaches in the
sound that need to be cleaned.
   ``But there are probably hundreds more,'' said Kelso's deputy,
Larry Dietrich. ``By the time you add in the gulf beaches, whew.''
   With the time remaining before winter, Exxon will have to clean
two or more miles per day to finish by its target.
   But Steve Havig, a state ecologist, said one mile a day would be
optimistic.
   Exxon plans to use cold salt water, suction pumps and hot-water
guns on the shoreline.
   Owens, the Exxon consultant, said that on Monday two crews
worked on a quarter-mile beach on Naked Island. Two others were to
be dispatched later in the week. But training the crews is
time-consuming.
   ``In the first month, you're slogging and dogging it through.
The learning curve right now is down there,'' Owens said, pointing
at the floor.
   ``The plan is a plan. We'll change it as much as it needs to
be.''
   State and federal agencies that are part of a shoreline advisory
committee have concluded Exxon's plan was inadequate.
   For instance, the plan identifies areas to be cleaned and adds
in mileage for contingencies.
   ``The contingency figure of 60.8 miles is grossly inaccurate.
... The western shoreline of PWS, which is still subject to oiling,
is 1,481 miles. Other figures are also unsubstantiated,'' the
committee wrote, referring to the sound.
   And, among other things, it questioned whether Exxon could
mobilize as quickly as described in the plan, which calls for the
operation to hit high gear by June 11.
   But Owens said Exxon has an ally in the sea's relentless
scouring.
   ``The shoreline cleans itself naturally by wave action,'' he
said. ``I would say that by next spring there will be a pocket or
two we may have missed, and by pockets I mean a few tens of yards.''

<HEAD>Bush Sees Possible End to Post-War Division of Europe</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sweeping economic and political changes
adopted by Polish authorities are having the side effect of
encouraging the Bush administration to talk more assertively about
a possible end to the post-war division of Europe.
   While announcing some new economic initiatives aimed at
promoting lasting reform in Poland, President Bush also alluded
Monday to the divisions that have plagued Europe since 1945.
   ``The United States has never accepted the legitimacy of
Europe's division,'' Bush said. ``We accept no spheres of influence
that deny the sovereign rights of nations.''
   Bush's words made clear his view that his willingness to
increase economic cooperation with Poland and other like-minded
East bloc countries is only part of a broader agenda. His ultimate
goal is an end to both the political divisions in Europe and the
dubious distinction of that continent's central region of being the
world's most heavily militarized area.
   It was 50 summers ago that Germany invaded Poland, setting in
motion a series of events that produced death, devastation and
ultimately the division of the continent, where bitter Cold War
confrontations were routine for a generation after the war's end.
Berlin for a time was synonymous with East-West brinkmanship.
   Now the talk is of arms reductions, cooperation and a shift
toward deemphasis of ideology, processes that have acquired
considerable momentum since the advent of the Gorbachev era in the
Soviet Union.
   Almost a month to the day after Moscow proposed huge cutbacks in
armies and tactical warplanes in Central Europe, the Communist
authorities in Warsaw reached agreement with opposition leaders on
legalizing the Solidarity trade union and on holding democratic
elections.
   And Bush traveled to the Polish-American city of Hamtramck,
Mich., on Monday to extoll the new paths being taken by the Warsaw
leadership.
   ``If Poland's experiment succeeds, other countries may follow,''
Bush said. ``While we must still differentiate among the nations of
Eastern Europe, Poland offers two lessons for all.''
   ``First, there can be no progress without significant political
and economic liberalization,'' he said. ``Second, help from the
West will come in concert with liberalization. Our friends and
European allies share this philosophy.''
   Later, a senior State Department official said the changing face
of Poland augurs well for the future stability of Europe. As
mistrust based on differing ideologies diminishes, tensions will
abate as well, said the official, asking not to be identified.
   ``We have supported and encouraged the efforts of the nations of
Eastern and Central Europe to become freer, more independent and
more prosperous,'' he said.
   ``We have believed, and believe now, that movement in this
direction will create a more stable and secure Europe that is in
everyone's interest, including those of the USSR.''
   Still, the official said the package of economic incentives
announced by Bush will almost certainly disappoint the Poles. When
implemented, the measures could lead to perhaps only a marginal
expansion in Polish exports to the United States and U.S. private
investment in Poland as well as some debt relief.
   All of the steps are linked to the actual carrying out of
Poland's political and economic reforms.
   And, as the official noted, the United States and other allied
countries can have only a peripheral impact on ending Poland's
acute economic distress.
   ``No outsider can save Poland,'' the official said.
   Nonetheless, the mood now, early in the Bush administration,
contrasts markedly with the situation almost eight years ago not
long after Ronald Reagan became president.
   At the time, Poland declared martial law and the brief
experiment in independent trade unionism there was crushed. It was
a time when Reagan responded by imposing economic sanctions against
Poland, when there were fears that a Soviet invasion might be
imminent.
   Bush acknowledged on Monday how much things have changed in the
interim, not only in Poland but elsewhere in the East bloc.
   ``The winds of change are shaping a new European destiny,'' he
said. ``Eastern Europe is awakening to yearnings for democracy,
independence and prosperity.''

<HEAD>House Passes Hatch Act Change</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has voted overwhelmingly to repeal
major portions of the Hatch Act and let federal Civil Service
employees participate in partisan political activity on their own
time.
   Despite the 297-90 House vote Monday, final enactment into law
is far from certain. The House approved an almost identical bill
last year, but it died in the Senate.
   The administration is opposed to the bill and Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh has said he will recommend a veto should it reach
President Bush's desk.
   The measure was pushed strongly by various unions representing
federal workers, and their leaders were quick to praise the House
members who voted for it.
   ``This is not a political party issue ... it's a political
freedom issue,'' said Robert M. Tobias, president of the National
Treasury Employees Union. ``We urge the Senate to join the House in
standing firmly on the side of rights for federal workers.''

<NOTE>As Costs Rise for Poor, Number of Available Homes Shrinks</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poor families face a shrinking number of
low-cost homes and apartments, even as federal spending and the
number of families aided rises, according to a private study.
   More of the poor had to pay more for housing because of soaring
costs from 1978 to 1985, said the study titled ``A Place to Call
Home.''
   The study was produced by two groups that generally advocate
increased funds for social programs, the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities and the Low Income Housing Information Service.
The authors used data from a 1985 housing survey.
   The study said the proportion of poor renting families who pay
at least 60 percent of their income for rent and utilities rose
from 44 percent in 1978 to 55 percent in 1985.
   The number of houses and apartments available for a monthly rent
of $250 or less _ 30 percent of the income of a family making
$10,000 a year _ was 9.7 million in 1970, or 2.4 million more than
the comparable number of families.
   In 1978, there were still 370,000 more units than families, but
by 1985 the number of families had risen to 11.6 million while the
number of houses and apartments available at $250 or less had
fallen to 7.9 million _ a deficit of 3.7 million affordable housing
units. Of the 7.9 million, 800,000 were vacant and 1.5 million were
occupied by families with incomes above the poverty line.

<NOTE>House Approves Bill To Make King Holiday Commission Permanent</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has passed legislation to make the
Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday Commission a permanent
agency with authorized spending of $500,000 a year.
   The legislation, sponsored by Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., passed
the House Monday on a 305-84 vote. A similar measure is pending in
the Senate, which failed to act before adjourning last year on a
House-passed bill to make the commission permanent.
   The commission was established by Congress in 1984 to
institutionalize the federal holiday in honor of the slain civil
rights leader. Authorization for the commission expires May 1.
   Conyers told the House on Monday that the commission is needed
more now than ever before because most young people have no
first-hand knowledge of the civil rights movement.
   While the commission has received no federal funds in the past,
Conyers and other supporters of the bill argued that the $500,000
annual authorization is needed because private funds for the
panel's work have been drying up.
   The Senate bill, sponored by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., would extend
the commission for five years at a cost of $1.5 million.

<HEAD>U.S. Biologist To Help Save Giant Turtles From Extinction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARI S. MANIAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American biologist has embarked
on a two-year effort to help Malaysia save from extinction a
species of sea turtle that scientists say has been around for at
least 150 million years.
   Jeanne A. Mortimer, assistant professor at the Archie Carr
Center for Sea Turtle Research at the University of Florida in
Gainesville, arrived in February to work on saving the endangered
giant leatherback turtle.
   She said in a telephone interview today that the World Wide Fund
for Nature and the Malaysian Fisheries Department asked for her
help after she attended a conference on turtles in Kuala Lumpur in
1987.
   ``We want to increase the success rate of the hatcheries ...
besides educating the public on how to treat the leatherbacks,''
said Ms. Mortimer, who has worked on similar projects in Costa
Rica, Nicaragua, Mexico, Brazil, Pakistan and Thailand.
   The turtles, which reach as much as 6{ feet in diameter and
1,100 pounds, roam the seas as far away as Japan, Australia and the
Philippines and live as long as 100 years.
   Between June and August they return to lay their eggs on eight
miles of sandy beach on the South China Sea at Rantau Abang, 180
miles northeast of Kuala Lumpur.
   Ms. Mortimer said that in the 1950s, about 2,000 of the giant
leatherback turtles, whose scientific name is Demochlys Coriacca,
came ashore to lay eggs. Last year, however, just 40 to 50 returned.
   The alarming decline in the turtles' numbers has been attributed
to pollution, pilfering of eggs and disturbance by tourists.
   Officials say some leatherbacks mistake plastic bags for jelly
fish, the staple of their diet, and choke to death.
   Some Malaysians eat the turtles' eggs, which are a little
smaller than tennis balls, because they think it will improve their
sexual prowess.
   Ms. Mortimer said she will conduct courses for hatchery workers,
tourist guides and the public on how to treat leatherbacks.
   Also, hatchery workers will be on hand when the turtles return
to lay their eggs and will build fences around them.
   Maylasia recently passed a law that bans eating the eggs and
their collection, unless they are gathered for hatching.
   Since 1961, the Fisheries Department has collected endangered
eggs and reburied them. After about 55 days, baby turtles emerge
and are released into the sea.
   About 450,000 turtles have been released like this, but only one
in 1,000 survive to reach adulthood because other sea creatures
prey on them, scientists say. The turtles lay between nine to 14
eggs at a time and visit the beach five to nine times during the
season.

<TEXT>
   Before killing his family and
committing suicide, the son of Mercedes McCambridge left the
actress a letter saying she had called him a ``sniveling wimp'' and
``hurt every member of my family.''
   The letter and other documents left by John Markle were made
public Monday by the state Supreme Court after it rejected Ms.
McCambridge's attempt to keep them private.
   Markle, 45, killed himself, his 45-year-old wife, Christine, and
daughters Amy, 13, and Suzanne, 9, in their Little Rock home Nov.
16, 1987. Three days earlier, Markle was fired from the Stephens
Inc. brokerage house for charging trading losses to his employer's
accounts and profits to his mother's account, police said.
   In his 13-page letter dated October 1987, Markle exonerated his
mother for the trading scheme but complained of her treatment of
him.
   ``I was essentially raised by live-in maids and relatives. ... I
was conceptualized to save a bad marriage. ... I watch you try to
kill yourself twice. You have never been there for me when the
chips were down,'' he wrote.
   ``When I cried on the phone you called me a `sniveling wimp'
...''
   A lawyer for Ms. McCambridge said Monday she ``is not available
for comment at this time.''
   In his diary, Markle mentioned his moods and wrote of relying on
God.
   On Oct. 27, 1987, he expressed concern for his family: ``None of
these people deserve me. I have put all of their futures in
jeopardy. My relationship with my mother has been destroyed. I fear
I have placed my family at considerable financial risk, i.e., I am
broke and they my children have no inheritance left because of my
action. Christine says I have put the family last and I have. There
really is only one choice now.''
   Nov. 8: After being stopped by a policeman for speeding and not
getting a ticket, Markle wrote, ``I had a real sense that God had
intervened and that perhaps that was a sign of something. That p.m.
I was pretty low and just turned it over to God. That seemed to
work.''
   On Nov. 10: ``I know I have done wrong by my stealing and the
contempt I have for the system. I am sorry for all the pain it has
inflicted on my wife and children.''
   Nov. 11: ``God give me the sign. More and more I am just giving
it over to God when I get scared.''
   The letter said that Markle's problems at work worsened when his
mother sent telegrams telling Stephens officials she hadn't known
what her son was doing with her account. He wrote: ``I wished you'd
never done a lot of things you did. Night mother.''
   Ms. McCambridge appeared in the Pulitzer Prize-winning play
``Night Mother.'' In that play, the mother's daughter committed
suicide.
   In the letter, Markle made brief references to other Hollywood
names. He wrote that Ms. McCambridge was on location in Arizona for
the movie ``Johnnie Guitar'' when she ``and Joan Crawford were both
drinking and fighting like hell'' in some incident. He mentioned
``Sterling Hayden physically separating you after Joan had thrown a
gin bottle at you.''
   The letter's last page included this: ``Is this clear to you?
That you have hurt every member of my family. That you have hurt
me; that I stood by you under some really adverse conditions and
that you have never done anything but manipulate me for your
purposes.''

   Sen. Danny Staples reached for his
gavel to bring his rowdy colleagues to order. But the gavel was
missing, so he went for the next best thing: the heel of his shoe.
   Staples was presiding over the Senate Monday night during a rare
evening session in which the chamber debated a dog-racing bill.
   When the chatter and noise got to be too much, Staples looked
for the gavel amd when he couldn't find it, he removed his shoe and
banged the heel on the lecturn.
   ``It's a night session and there's going to be order,'' Staples
said in explaining his decision.
   When other senators noticed the makeshift gavel, laughter broke
up the sometimes testy debate. They came to the rescue, finding a
replacement wooden gavel that Staples used the rest of the night.
   The bill was defeated.

<HEAD>Mexican Teachers Strike Over Pay, Corruption</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGIO CARRASCO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of striking teachers have forced up
to half the country's public schools to close and vowed to stay out
until their wages are doubled and their union is purged of
corruption.
   The National Education Workers' Coordinate, a dissident group
within the National Education Workers Union, went on strike Monday
claiming the support of about half of Mexico's 1.1 million public
school teachers.
   There were no reports of violence.
   ``The strike will last indefinitely, until we obtain a positive
response to our demands,'' said coordinate leader Teodoro Palomino.
He said 8,000 schools in Mexico City and in 21 of Mexico's 31
states had suspended classes.
   Education Secretary Manuel Bartlett threatened unspecified
punitive measures against the teachers.
   ``We must all meet our responsibilities. If not, we suffer the
consequences,'' he said Monday night in an interview on the
Televisa television network. ``It's not legitimate to strike to
resolve internal labor problems. ... It damages education in this
country.''
   According to government figures, 25.4 million students attend
public schools.
   The coordinate on Sunday rejected a government offer to increase
pay by 10 percent and fringe benefits by 18 percent.
   Teachers make about $150 a month and President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari has acknowledged that they are badly underpaid. But he says
the government cannot afford the coordinate's demand of a 100
percent raise.
   Coordinate leaders also demand ``democratization'' of the
National Education Workers Union _ Mexico's largest union _ and the
removal of union leaders they claim are corrupt.
   Jobs within the union have for decades been considered posts to
reward loyal officials of Salinas' Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI), which has governed the country since it was formed 60
years ago.
   The strikers accuse union leader Carlos Jongitud Barrios, a PRI
senator, and other union officials of rigging union elections and
taking bonuses and other perks while the rank-and-file was
suffering the effects of Mexico's 7-year-old economic crisis.
   Since taking office on Dec. 1, Salinas has tried to restore
public confidence in his party by ordering the arrests of the head
of the oil workers' union and a leading stockbroker on corruption
and other charges.
   A recent study by the liberal magazine Proceso said 80 percent
of Mexico City's 100,000 grammar school teachers could not afford
homes or cars.
   Nearly all had to work at extra jobs and many drove taxis to
make ends meet, according to the magazine.
   ``They've turned us into peddlers,'' said Juan Buendia, a
teacher at Jose Clemente Orozco elementary school in Atizapan.
``Some of us sell things on the street to buy chalk and erasers for
the students.''
   The government increased salaries by an average 20 percent last
year, when inflation ran at 51.9 percent.

<HEAD>Jury Finds Private College Wrongfully Dismissed Student For Obesity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private college wrongfully dismissed a
nursing student when it forced her to leave the school because she
did not lose weight, a federal jury ruled.
   The jury Monday told Salve Regina College in Newport to pay
Sharon Russell $30,515 for tuition and wages she was deprived of
while completing her nursing degree at a school in West Hartford,
Conn.
   ``No one has the right to put any student through what I went
through,'' said Russell, 24. ``Hopefully it will deter this from
happening again.''
   Russell weighed 328 pounds in her junior year, around the time
she signed an agreement with the Roman Catholic college that she
would lose 2 pounds per week for the rest of the academic year or
drop out. She also agreed to regularly attend Weight Watchers
meetings.
   Russell was ultimately given a passing grade and allowed to
register for her senior year on the understanding she would diet
during the summer, which school attorney Steven P. Snow said she
did not do.
   In the fall of 1985, the college informed Russell she would not
be allowed to return for her senior year. It maintained Russell's
obesity had interfered with her ability to perform certain clinical
duties.
   ``A college ought to have the right to establish their own
standard minimum requirements and enforce those,'' said Snow.
   The $2,775 Russell paid for her first semester tution was not
refunded, said her attorney, Edward T. Hogan.
   The school breached its contract with Russell because she
substantially performed her educational duties and the contract for
weight reduction, said Hogan. He said she maintained a grade-point
average higher than 3.0 out of a possible 4.0, and only failed a
clinical course because of an instructor's bias.
   Snow said Russell had difficulty teaching diet classes and with
cardio-pulmonary resuscitation.
   Snow said the college had the same right to respond to Russell's
overeating as it would if a student's performance were affected by
drugs or alcohol addictions.
   ``I would think that every college in American would be
concerned about the adverse precedential affects of this ruling,''
he said.
   Russell said students in her class who smoked were not forced to
sign similar contracts.
   Russell, who said she gained weight after leaving Salve Regina,
completed her degree at St. Joseph's College, where she had to
repeat her junior year because her Salve Regina credits for that
year were not accepted.
   Russell, now a nurse in St. Petersburg, Fla., said she lost
substantial weight after she had her stomache stapled in August
1986, while at student at St. Joseph's. She declined to divulge her
current weight.

<TEXT>
   A doctor has vowed to clear his
name of fraud charges filed by Switzerland despite being barred
from traveling abroad by a U.S. judge, who feared cancer patients
might die in his absence.
   Dr. Rajko Medenica's trial on charges of defrauding the Swiss
government of $2.6 million opened Monday in Geneva. It was recessed
until Wednesday so the Swiss judge could consider a defense motion
for postponement until Medenica can attend.
   Medenica, a native of Yugoslavia who became an American citizen
last year, was ordered in March to surrender his passport and
remain in the United States by federal District Judge Sol Blatt Jr.
   Several of Medenica's patients had said they might die if the
doctor were jailed in Switzerland and unable to continue his
treatments.
   Medenica has developed a form of cancer therapy that tailors
interferon treatments to individual patients, many of whom who have
been treated unsuccessfully elsewhere.
   His patients include former heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali, who
was given the treatment for a blood disorder.
   During a recent interview, the physician said he feels caught
between his responsibility to his patients and his desire to return
to Europe to clear his name.
   ``As a new American, I don't want to start my life by having
something dirty and something I'm not responsible for happening in
Europe,'' he said.
   The Swiss government alleges Medenica was responsible for fake
billing while treating patients, including many Yugoslavs, at a
state hospital in Geneva and a private clinic from 1973 through
1981.
   In 1983, he was sentenced in absentia in Yugoslavia to 20 years
in prison on related charges and his Yugoslavian property,
including a seaside villa, was confiscated.
   While jailed in Switzerland for 15 months as authorities
investigated his case, 36 of his patients died, according to court
documents.
   Medenica was released from the jail in 1984 after former South
Carolina Gov. John West, whose daughter was treated for throat
cancer by Medenica, persuaded a judge to grant bond. West also
helped raise much of Medenica's $300,000 bail.
   The doctor then came to Hilton Head Island and with the help of
South Carolina's two U.S. senators, Strom Thurmond and Ernest
Hollings, fought Yugoslavia's request for extradition.
   Medenica, 49, strongly denies any fraud. He says his records
show he performed all the services for which he charged, even
giving Yugoslavs a 50-percent discount. The billing, he said, was
handled by the Yugoslavian consulate and Swiss authorities.
   ``I am always concerned about my patients,'' he said. ``One of
the biggest problems ... in Switzerland was that I was blindly
looking at the patients and the other people organized the
billing.''
   Attorney F. Lee Bailey, who represented Medenica during his
hearing before Blatt in Charleston, admitted the billing documents
were false but said they were not fraudulent.
   ``If patient A got $100 worth (of services) and was charged $50
and if patient B got charged $100 and got $50 worth, at the end of
the day justice was done but the documents were false,'' he said in
a telephone interview from Boston.
   If the Swiss proceed with the trial without Medenica, Bailey
said he will ask Blatt to reconsider his order keeping the doctor
in this country or appeal the ruling to the 4th U.S. District Court
of Appeals.
   Bailey also suggested the Swiss case could be tried in the
United States because it is based largely on documents. That would
allow Medenica to attend the trial and tend to his patients, he
said.
   In their motion in the Swiss court Monday, Medenica's attorneys
asked for a postponement of eight to 12 months so the doctor could
train someone to care for his patients in his absence.

   The dollar gained against the Japanese yen in
trading in Tokyo on Tuesday, and stock prices recovered from an
early setback.
   The dollar closed at 132.10 yen, up 0.27 yen from Monday's
finish of 131.83 yen. The dollar opened higher at 132.23 yen and
ranged between 132.00 and 132.27 yen during the day.
   Traders said the dollar-yen exchange rate changed little as
participants avoided making any major moves ahead of the scheduled
release of the U.S. consumer price index for March later Tuesday.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues added another 13.33 points, or 0.04 percent, to
finish trading at 33,321.66, another record high. The stock average
gained 157.89 points on Monday.
   Dealers said the Nikkei index recovered after an initial decline
as participants began buying steel and machinery issues.
   Trading was active despite the coming release of U.S. consumer
prices, said a dealer with a major securities firm in Tokyo.
   Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 1.1
billion shares, up from 750 million shares on Monday.

   Homeowners should find non-chemical ways to
keep their grass green instead of using lawn care products that
have been linked to cancer, a consumer group says.
   But the Professional Lawn Care Association says the industry is
well-regulated and takes proper care to use products safely.
   The report issued by Public Citizen, a non-profit consumer group
founded by Ralph Nader, said 12 of the 40 pesticides most often
used by commercial lawn care firms are suspected human carcinogens.
   Twenty-one of the pesticides can cause long-term health problems
like birth defects, liver, kidney or nerve damage; 20 can cause
short-term ailments similar to flu; and 36 have caused eye, skin or
throat irritation, the group said.
   James Brooks, spokesman for the lawn care industry group, said
the study was ``old news'' and based mostly on isolated incidents.
   ``We have to be registered and certified in most states,''
Brooks said. ``We are regulated. We use chemicals as recommended on
the label. If you follow the procedures and directions and all
that, then they are not going to cause any undue health problems.''
   Dr. Barry Troutman, director of education for the lawn
association, said scientific evidence indicates the products don't
cause adverse health effects when used as directed by the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   He criticized the study for being too ``anecdotal'' and not
``science-based.''
   The study, written by Laura Weiss, calls on the EPA to:
   _Ban lawn care pesticides suspected of causing cancer.
   _Conduct a comprehensive exposure study for all lawn care
chemicals, speed up testing for neurotoxic effects of all
pesticides and their inert ingredients and take regulatory action
to protect consumers.
   _Require lawn care companies to provide customers with
government information on the known and potential health effects of
lawn care pesticides.
   _Ensure that federal agencies take decisive action against lawn
care companies that make false or misleading claims about the
safety of their products.
   _Appropriate funds for programs that promote use of non-chemical
pest control systems.
   Alicia Tenuta, spokeswoman for the EPA, said the agency had not
seen the study and could not comment on it.

   Plantation Foods Inc. of Waco, Texas, has
voluntarily recalled all of its ``Plantation Turkey Franks''
because some were found to be contaminated with a potentially fatal
bacteria, federal officials said.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the recall after
some franks were found to be contaminated by Listeria monocytogenes.
   USDA said the plant was ordered Friday to stop production
immediately and to hold all remaining franks. The plant resumed
production on Monday following the recall.
   The franks are sold at the retail level in 1-pound packages and
to institutions in 10-pound packages under the brand names
Plantation Turkey Franks, NIFDA Turkey Franks, CODE Turkey Franks
and Nugget Turkey Franks. The franks were distributed in southern
states from Georgia to California, USDA said.
   USDA said the Centers for Disease Control confirmed the presence
of Listeria monocytogenes in the franks during an active
surveillance investigation on listeriosis.
   Roane Lacy Jr., chief executive officer of Plantation Foods,
said test batches will be produced in five separate operations over
the week, and it won't be known until the end of next week whether
shipments can resume.
   USDA said healthy people are at little risk for listeriosis;
most vulnerable are people with weakened immune systems _ infants,
pregant women, the elderly and the chronically ill.
   Listeriosis is usually manifested as meningitis or
meningo-encephalitis, which affects tissues around the brain or
spine, or septicemia, which is blood poisoning.

   A helicopter pilot's inexperience and poor choice
of aircraft may have been the difference between a daredevil prison
escape of a drug kingpin and the tangled wreckage lying inside the
compound.
   Moments after former powerboat champion Benjamin ``Barry''
Kramer leaped onto the small helicopter that swooped into the
exercise yard Monday morning, the craft's rear rotor became tangled
in the 12-foot fence surrounding the Metropolitan Correctional
Center.
   ``Had he not hit the fence, he would have escaped,'' said Warden
John Clark.
   The crash left Kramer with a broken right leg; pilot Charles
Clayton Stevens, 34, of Gold Beach, Ore., suffered two broken legs
and facial injuries.
   They were taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital, where they were
listed in guarded but stable condition today.
   Although Stevens once spoke of his love for working in a hostile
environment, he was known to regulars at nearby Tamiami Airport as
a nervous airman with a student pilot's license.
   ``He was very squirrelly on the helicopter,'' said Paul Barth,
president of Biscayne Helicopters Inc. ``We sort of stayed away
from him.''
   Other experienced pilots wondered about Stevens' selection of
the two-seat Bell 47-1A helicopter to try to snatch Kramer, who is
serving life without parole for distributing half a million pounds
of marijuana throughout the Midwest.
   ``In my opinion, that would not be the kind of bird to use,''
said airport patrolman Rich Fisher. ``That's an observation
helicopter. It's no work horse. It's a light-duty, slow-moving
machine.''
   Calvin R. Coady, a flight instructor for Aris Helicopters Ltd.
of San Jose, Calif., said Stevens paid him $35,000 in cash for the
37-year-old helicopter Dec. 17.
   ``I remember it very well _ the majority of the money was $100
bills, with a few 50s,'' Coady said, adding that the large amount
of cash made him suspicious but that he didn't ask Stevens about
its source.
   Most of the 1,000 prison's inmates are awaiting federal trial.
The 36-year-old Kramer was being held in a special high-security
area because he was considered an escape risk.
   ``We are not surprised to hear of the attempted escape. After
all, Mr. Kramer is a man of tremendous wealth facing a life
sentence,'' said Tom Cash, special agent in charge of the Drug
Enforcement Agency in Miami. ``But we never anticipated the
method.''
   The DEA in February warned the U.S. Marshal's Office that Kramer
might be planning to break out, Cash said. Kramer would have no
problem financing an escape, he said.
   ``We estimate that Kramer made about $60 million in drug
smuggling,'' Cash said. ``We only confiscated $20 million in cash
and we know he used offshore banks.''
   The brazen escape attempt unfolded like the 1975 Charles Bronson
movie ``Breakout.''
   ``That movie has given everybody the idea that escaping prison
in a helicopter is a piece of cake,'' Cash said.
   Stevens dropped low enough for Kramer to jump onto one of the
landing skids. The helicopter started to rise, but then caught its
rear rotor in the wire atop the fence around the 50-by-200-foot
exercise area and crashed.
   Kramer was sentenced after his conviction in Illinois with
former car-racing star Randy Lanier on charges of running a
multimillion dollar pot-smuggling ring.
   He was brought to the prison outside Miami to face a
marijuana-smuggling indictment in Fort Lauderdale and a Miami gun
charge.
   U.S. Marshal Dan Horgan said Kramer now faces an attempted
escape charge, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in
prison, and Stevens faces charges of aiding an escape.
   In an interview last summer with The World newspaper of Coos
Bay, Ore., Stevens said he was a sea diver who harvested sea
urchins, albacore, clams, kelp, mussels and oysters for export to
Japan.
   ``My goal is to make money,'' he told the newspaper. He added
that although he could make as much as $1,500 a day as a diver, he
wasn't in the business only for the money.
   ``I'm trained for that environment,'' he said. ``It's exciting,
an adrenaline high. It's just such a hostile environment. I love
it.''
   He also said the diamond earring he wears would one day pay for
his funeral.

<TEXT>
   The Tamil Tigers separatist guerrillas
have appointed a Sri Lankan-born British Tamil to start peace talks
with the Sinhalese-dominated government, officials and Tamil
sources said today.
   Anton Balasingham, recently named head of the political section
of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eeelam, was expected to arrive
here from London ``in the next couple of days,'' sources close to
the rebels said.
   The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In a surprise move during the weekend, the Tigers declared they
were ready to begin peace talks with President Ranasinghe Premadasa.
   The declaration came after the Tigers were blamed for three days
of bombings that killed at least 79 people.
   So far there has been no explanation for the sudden change of
heart by the largest Tamil guerrilla group.
   The Tamil sources said Balasingham's first mission is to talk
with the government about a time and place for the talks. After
that, he will be a member of the Tigers' negotiating team, the
sources added.
   Evans Cooray, Premadasa's press secretary, said the president's
office was notified shortly before midnight Monday that Balasingham
had been designated to make arrangements for the talks. Cooray said
the message was contained in a telex from the Tigers' information
office in London.
   Premadasa, who took office in January, had offered to start
talks with both the Tigers and Sinhalese militants about ending the
ethnic violence that has claimed more than 12,600 lives in this
once-idyllic Indian Ocean island since 1983.
   The Sinhalese extremists, whose group is called the People's
Liberation Front, have not responded to the Sinhalese president's
call.
   Sinhalese have dominated Sri Lanka's government and military
since the island, formerly called Ceylon, became independent from
Britain in 1948. Mostly Buddhists, they make up 75 percent of the
country's 16 million people.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, comprise 18 percent and say they
are discriminated against in jobs and education.
   Efforts by Premadasa's predecessor, President Junius R.
Jayewardene, to make peace with the Tamil separatists spurred a
violent backlash by ultranationalist Sinhalese who said the
government was offering too many concessions to the Tamils.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index overcame
losses in early trading to close at yet another high today, and the
dollar rose slightly against the yen.
   The dollar closed at 132.10 yen, up 0.27 yen from Monday's
131.83 yen finish. It opened at 132.23 yen and ranged between
132.00 yen and 132.27 yen
   In the previous three trading days, the dollar had slipped a
total of 1.02 yen.
   The dollar-yen rate moved little today as market players awaited
the release later in the day in Washington of the U.S. consumer
price index for March, traders said.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average added
13.33 points, or 0.04 percent, and finished Tuesday's trading at a
record 33,321.66. It also had set a record Monday when it gained
157.89 points to close at 33,308.33.
   The index lost in morning trading but recovered in the afternoon
as investors, expecting little increase in the U.S. price index,
started buying, said Kenji Ishizuka of Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
   ``This showed that market players were quite optimistic about
the figure, which they think wouldn't be much different from last
month,'' he said.
   The market expects a 0.6 percent increase in the price index in
March, up from February's 0.4 percent.
   Other dealers said some investors were concerned the price index
might show signs of inflation.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 1.1 billion shares,
up from Monday's 750 million. Among gainers were steel and
machinery issues.

<TEXT>
   A South Korean television producer
heavily in debt was arrested in Indonesia on charges of trying to
defect to North Korea, news reports said today.
   South Korean security agents arrested Hwang Song-joo, 30, at the
airport in Jakarta on Monday as he tried to board a plane for
Vienna, according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.
   Yonhap said Hwang had planned to defect to the communist north
from Vienna.
   It said Hwang had frequented the North Korean embassy in Jakarta
and asked to defect to an eastern European nation, but was
persuaded to go to North Korea.
   Hwang worked for the Korean Broadcasting System as a producer
and fled South Korea in March after creditors demanded he repay the
$225,000 he had borrowed for stock market investments, Yonhap said.

   About 200 communist guerrillas firing
automatic weapons and grenade launchers attacked an army supply
depot in the central Philippines today and killed six soldiers, the
military reported.
   The raiders also wounded 10 soldiers and captured two others
during the 3{-hour firefight in the town of Candoni in Negros
Occidental province, about 350 miles southeast of Manila, an army
spokesman said.
   Negros Island, the country's sugar bowl, is considered a
stronghold of the communist New People's Army.
   The two captured soldiers were later abandoned in a house
several miles from the clash site, the official said.
   He quoted the two soldiers as saying at least 30 of the raiders
were killed, but the report could not be independently verified.
   ``They were carrying them aboard several bamboo carts drawn by
carabaos (water buffaloes) with bodies piled up, one on top of the
other,'' he added.
   The rebel army has been waging a 20-year-old war in a bid to
establish a Marxist state in the Philippines.

<TEXT>
   The Alaska Public Radio Network board has
decided to return $32,283 that Exxon Corp. had donated to help the
network cover the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
   ``I think there is a perceived conflict of interest,'' network
executive director Diane Kaplan told the board at an emergency
meeting Monday. ``I believe it would be inappropriate for us to
accept it.''
   Exxon officials said late last week that the oil company had
sent the network a check after they learned state legislators were
considering a supplemental budget request for the money.
   Network officials said at the time that they would accept the
check and that they did not consider it an ethical issue.
   Exxon, the owner of the tanker that ran aground last month and
spilled more than 10 million gallons of oil into Prince William
Sound, has underwritten network programs in the past, as have other
oil companies.
   Exxon's oil-spill contribution, however, was unusual in that it
was provided as reimbursement for coverage of a specific news event
in which it has been accused of negligence.
   Kaplan stressed that network officials did not ask Exxon or the
legislators for the money, and that accepting it would not have
compromised news coverage by the network's member stations.
   However, the board agreed that the appearance of a conflict of
interest could jeopardize the network's credibility. The six-member
board voted unanimously to return the check with a letter of thanks
to Exxon.
   Exxon spokeswoman Jan Cool said the company understood the
board's reasoning.
   ``Our intentions were entirely honorable,'' she said. ``We
certainly wouldn't have made the grant if we felt we were putting
the public broadcasting network in any kind of compromising
position.''

<TEXT>
   The indictment of House Speaker Jim
Wright on charges of violating House rules did little to shake the
trust held in him by many in the district he's represented more
than 30 years.
   ``If somebody goes to him and asks for help _ not to pay a bribe
_ if you go to Jim Wright, he'll do his job: he'll help you,'' said
Ed Brown, who manages Silver Spur Saloon in the Fort Worth
Stockyards, a historic district revitalized with federal aid won by
Wright.
   The House Ethics Committee issued a report Monday citing 69
alleged violations of House rules by Wright, including accepting
nearly $145,000 in gifts and planning to avoid limits on outside
income.
   ``I give somebody the benefit of the doubt _ until it's proven
that he's done something more than anybody else up there,'' said
Mike Smith, owner of the Paris Coffee Shop, where a steady stream
of Fort Worth politicos, business workers, senior citizens and
hospital employees flow from early morning until mid-afternoon.
   Wright often stops in the shop during visits to Fort Worth. A
picture of him hangs on the wall.
   While friends voiced their support for Wright, others said he
should receive the same treatment given another Texan, former U.S.
Sen. John Tower, in Washington recently.
   ``I think he's guilty and they ought to hang him _ just like
Tower,'' said businessman Gary Dempsey.
   ``I think he's guilty,'' said Tish Lucas, a Housing and Urban
Development employee here. ``Any time a woman takes $18,000 a year
and a Cadillac when she's living in Washington, D.C., when the jobs
are here _ that doesn't make sense,'' Lucas said, referring to
allegations that Wright's wife was paid a salary but did little
work.
   But Mike Price, director of Fort Worth's Greenwood Funeral Home,
disagreed.
   ``Being a Republican and looking at it from that viewpoint, I
think what he did is not that bad,'' Price said. ``I think the
committee is just vindictive and they're just out to get him. They
haven't liked Jim Wright since he got elected Speaker of the House.
They're just trying to get rid of him.''
   And others staunchly defended the 17-term Democratic congressman.
   Mayor Bob Bolen said he thought the House Ethics committee came
up with very little against the Speaker.
   ``It's staggering to me ... unless there is something they
haven't disclosed, that it's taken two months and $2 million, and
almost paralyzed Congress, to find these very minor infractions,''
Bolen said.
   ``Really, the type of things that he's done don't bother me that
much,'' said Mara Hoyler, an employee of the Texas Cycling Journal.
``What bothers me is if they're going to do (such an investigation)
with him, they should do it to everyone.
   ``It's a Texas massacre,'' Mrs. Hoyler said. ``First it was
Tower, now Wright. I think it's more of a Texas problem than a
political one. ... I think the other states are out to get us.''

<HEAD>Peres Turns Aside Challenge at Party Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres turned aside a
challenge to his leadership of the left-leaning Labor Party at a
marathon meeting where he came under stiff criticism for his peace
policies and for losing the last national elections.
   The 12-hour session of Labor's Central Committee on Monday
underscored widening dissatisfaction with Peres' handling of
Israel's second largest party.
   Peres came under attack mainly from four party officials and
Cabinet ministers who have already announced or indicated
intentions to try to unseat him at the party's convention in 1990.
   But the challengers never brought their proposals to a vote and
Peres boasted today that the meeting's result amounted to backing
for his leadership.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a longtime rival of Peres, did
not speak at the meeting. Analysts believe he would be the most
serious challenger to Peres if he steps forward at the convention
next year.
   One of the challengers, former party secretary Uzi Baram, said
the party needed a more dovish platform and should support peace
talks ``with every Palestinian who recognizes Israel, including the
PLO.''
   The Israeli government rules out talks with the PLO, which it
considers a terrorist organization.
   Peres is more dovish than Shamir in his peace policies, but he
backs the refusal to talk to the PLO. The party platform expresses
that view but there are growing voices for a more flexible approach.
   Three other challengers to Peres who have also urged conditional
talks with the PLO focused on Labor's electoral loss to the
right-wing Likud bloc of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   Likud edged out Labor 40 to 39 seats in the 120-member
parliament last November. Labor later joined Likud as a junior
partner in a broad-based coalition government.
   Peres, foreign minister in the last joint government, took the
finance job this time, aiming to help his movement's ailing
collective farms and industries. However, the new job has virtually
locked him out of influencing foreign policy.
   ``We have to analyze our failures, we have to correct them.
People should realize that it's time to change leadership,'' said
Mordechai Gur, a minister without portfolio.
   ``There was an ideological failure, an organizational failure
and a failure of leadership,'' said Iraqi-born Energy Minister
Moshe Shahal, another challenger. The fourth was Communications
Minister Gad Yaacobi.
   ``I know there is not a good feeling or mood in the party,''
Peres responded, speaking to the 1,300 party delegates at a Tel
Aviv convention hall.
   ``Those who feel that I should continue, vote for me, and those
feeling that someone else should, vote for him,'' Peres said.
   He told army radio today that the results clearly left him in
charge. ``I never received a vote of confidence like at this
meeting,'' Peres said.

   Former House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip''
O'Neill defended his besieged successor, calling Jim Wright ``the
most honest and decent man I know.''
   The House Ethics Committee on Monday formally charged the Texas
Democrat with 69 violations, including trying to evade limits on
outside earnings.
   ``Jim Wright would never do anything he thought was wrong or was
breaking the rules of the Congress,'' O'Neill said Monday.
   O'Neill said perceptions of ethical behavior have changed since
the Nixon years, and few people would survive the intense scrutiny
focused on those in public life today.
   He also criticized the committee for hiring a professional
prosecutor to investigate Wright.
   ``He's just out there to see if he could nail someone,'' O'Neill
said. ``Here he is with 69 particulars. You only do that with a
grand jury. They're treating Jim differently than they ever treated
anybody else. I feel sorry for Jim Wright.''
   One charge accuses Wright with using a book he wrote,
``Reflections of a Public Man,'' to evade limits on outside income.
The committee says he sold a large quantity of the book to a group,
claiming the payment as royalties.
   O'Neill said he believed the sale could have been accomplished
by Wright's staff without his knowledge.
   He called other charges technical ommissions, little items a
public official may forget to report, putting him in violation of
various rules.
   Wright is ``the most honest and decent man I know,'' the retired
Massachusetts Democrat said during a speaking engagement here.
   O'Neill said he believes committee members had to come up with
the charges to justify the $1.5 million they spent on the
investigation, which has gone on for most of a year.
   ``They chase after so many things out there, especially with the
leadership,'' said O'Neill. ``There are not many people who you
can't go over tooth and nail and find something. We're being
over-investigated.''

   Nothing is certain but death, taxes and last-minute income tax
returns, and two extra days to file didn't change that for millions
of Americans.
   Filers jammed post offices, IRS information centers and
accountants' offices on Monday.
   ``Human nature doesn't change because they have two more days,''
said Helen Adorjan, an Illinois Revenue Department spokeswoman.
``They just procrastinate two more days.''
   Time for dithering ran out at midnight Monday because April 15
fell on a weekend. Many people were grateful for the reprieve.
   ``I got it done Sunday night,'' said Dennis de la Mata of
Chicago. ``The extra two days made a big difference. This is the
first time in nine years that I filed on time.''
   Businesses that thrive on tax season also found reason to cheer.
   ``We're taking in more clients, a lot of new clients,'' said
Idelle Rubino, a receptionist at the H&amp;R Block office near the
University of California, San Francisco, Medical Center. ``More
time to pay means more won't take the time to do it themselves
until the last minute.''
   Long lines and traffic jams surrounded many post offices, but
some people found ways to ease the strain.
   Los Angeles rock station KLSX-FM offered coffee and donuts at
the downtown Terminal Annex, the city's main mail processing
center, which posted buckets at curbside until midnight.
   ``We want to add some merriment and not make the people feel bad
that they're procrastinators,'' said KLSX disc jockey Peter Tilden.
   The home of the Dallas Cowboys saw unusual off-season activity
as the Internal Revenue Service set up shop at the Texas Stadium
ticket office. IRS officials passed out advice while a pizza
delivery service passed out free pies and an entertainer in Mickey
Mouse costume helped ease tensions.
   In Pittsburgh, the first game of the National Hockey League's
Patrick Division finals between the Penguins and the Philadelphia
Flyers apparently helped prevent a late filing crunch.
   ``It's been crazy, but good. It was a little more congested last
year,'' supervisor Don Smith said at the downtown post office. ``We
had people dropping off their returns on their way to the hockey
game.''
   Protesters with complaints about how the government will spend
the tax checks also gathered at filing points.
   In San Francisco, members of the Berkeley-based Northern
California War Tax Resistance distributed $6,000 from people who
refused to pay all or part of their taxes because they contend 60
percent of federal income taxes are used for ``war and war
preparations.''
   The Philadelphia Jobs With Peace Campaign protested quietly
outside the city's main post office by displaying model tanks, guns
and bombers. And six placard-waving members of the Libertarian
Party flanked lines of cars outside the main post office in Tuscon,
Ariz., urging people to support abolition of the income tax.
   George Paris, who says he is homeless but paid taxes on his
earnings from part-time jobs, stood near the Birmingham, Ala., post
office holding a sign reading ``Build Homes, Not Bombs.''
   An estimated 6 million Americans were expected to file their
income taxes on Monday, according to the IRS.
   Not everyone had to have their returns in the mail last night.
   Residents of Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, Connecticut,
upstate New York and Massachusetts got an extra day because Monday
was the Patriots' Day holiday in Massachusetts. They have until
tonight to mail returns to the IRS office at Andover, Mass.
   But already, IRS officials elsewhere were busy planning for next
year. They will hold a public meeting a week from today in
Indianapolis for suggestions on how the agency can do its job
better.
   ``We're hoping people won't forget about taxes now that tax
season is over,'' said Carolyn Stumpf, an IRS spokeswoman.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors filed bribery charges today against a
former senior government official caught up in the Recruit
stock-profiteering scandal and said they will now focus the
investigation on politicians.
   Aides of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and former Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone profited in the stock deals, but both
men have denied any personal wrongdoing.
   The scandal has seriously eroded public confidence in the
Takeshita government, and support for the prime minister fell below
4 percent in a poll by Kyodo News Service last week.
   The Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office today charged
Kunio Takaishi, 59, a former vice minister of education who was
arrested on March 28.
   He was the 14th person _ all businessmen or bureaucrats _
arrested so far in the scandal.
   All now have been formally charged, and prosecutors said they
would turn their attention from bureaucracy's part in the scandal
to the role of politicians.
   Takaishi is accused of receiving bribes from Recruit Co. and
providing favors for the information and publishing conglomerate.
   Others who have been charged include Recruit founder Hiromasa
Ezoe; Takashi Kato, a former vice minister of labor; and Hisashi
Shinto, former chairman of Japan's telecommunications giant, Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp.
   Recruit sold unlisted stocks in a subsidiary at bargain prices
to about 160 influential politicians, public officials and
businessmen. The buyers profited handsomely when the shares were
listed for public trading and shot up in price.
   According to a 1988 Supreme Court decision, the sale of stock
bound to rise in price and not available to the general public
could amount to bribery.
   At least 17 politicians, including Takeshita and Nakasone, have
been linked to the scandal directly or through stock purchases by
aides.
   In addition, Takeshita has acknowledged receiving more than $1
million in political contributions from Recruit in 1986 and 1987,
but has said the donations all were legal.
   Despite repeated demands from opposition parties that he resign
and call elections to allow a public judgment, Takeshita has vowed
to stay on and push for political reforms.
   Passage of the budget for this fiscal year, which began April 1,
has been blocked by an opposition boycott of Parliament in support
of demands that Takeshita resign or call Nakasone to Parliament for
questioning about his role in the affair.

<HEAD>Dollar Stable in Thin European Trading, Gold Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fluctuated in a narrow range in
extremely thin European trading late this morning as the market
awaited key U.S. inflation statistics.
   Gold prices moved up.
   The release today of the U.S. consumer price index for March was
likely to give an indication as to whether there was any room for
the U.S. Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy, traders said.
   One Rome trader said a rise in the index could lead the Fed to
tighten monetary policy and the dollar would rise.
   Another Rome trader said market sentiment toward the dollar was
neutral and that it was uncertain that the inflation report would
move the dollar out the doldrums.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7090, compared with
$1.7095 Monday.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday:
   _ 1.8633 West German marks, up from 1.8565
   _ 1.6385 Swiss francs, unchanged
   _ 6.3070 French francs, up from 6.2825
   _ 2.0999 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0953
   _ 1,366.50 Italian lire, up from 1,364.00
   _ 1.1850 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1855
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.27 yen to a closing 132.10 yen. Later in
London, it was quoted at 132.25 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $385.25 a troy ounce, up
from $385.00 bid late Monday. At midmorning today, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $385.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $385.40, up from $384.50 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 6 cents to close at a bid
$386.68.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $5.81 a troy
ounce, up from Monday's $5.80.

   Family ties proved wildly profitable for two
clans who combined to win half of the record $69.9 million Illinois
Lotto jackpot.
   The two families, with members in four states, claimed their
$17.5 million prizes Monday, while the holders of two other winning
tickets had yet to be identified by state officials.
   ``We just couldn't believe it,'' said MaryAnn Dixon, 37, of
suburban Naperville, when she and her husband discovered after
Saturday night's drawing that they were winners. ``When we called
everyone, no one would believe us. We had to keep repeating, like,
`Hey, we're not kidding.'''
   The winning ticket was one of 15 Mrs. Dixon bought on behalf of
herself, husband Daniel and 10-month-old daughter, Kate, as well as
her parents _ Louis and Mary Matlosz of Elizabeth, N.J. _ and two
brothers and a sister and their families in New Jersey. Mrs. Dixon
is expecting a second child in July.
   Daniel Dixon, 38, said he had no plans to quit his job as a
mechanical engineer for Molex Inc. of Lisle, an electrical
component manufacturer. ``I like my job,'' he said.
   Not so with some other winners. Ron Miller, 36, of Little York,
said he plans to quit his job as a hog buyer at a meat packing
plant and ``try something a little more fun _ maybe professional
bass fishing.''
   Miller, who is married and has a 10-year-old daughter, will
split his winning share with brother Scott, 29, of Chandler, Ariz.,
and a brother in Stafford, Texas, represented Monday by his wife,
Barbara.
   Scott said he plans to stop driving a delivery truck and travel
or take some courses, while Barbara said she plans to pay debts and
invest in her new dress-designing business.
   Ron Miller said he called his sister-in-law Barbara on her
birthday six days before the drawing and suggested a three-way,
15-ticket pool, ``seeing as the lottery prize was so high.'' He
said he was ``hysterical'' after learning of his fortune.
   The news got around fast in Little York, a town of about 300 in
west-central Illinois, and a big sign in the post office declared,
``Congratulations, Ron.''
   The final figure for the jackpot, boosted by four winner-less
drawings and a frenzy of ticket-buying last week, was $69,940,000,
said Lottery Director Sharon Sharp. The prizes will provide each
family with about $874,000 a year before taxes for 20 years.
   The two other winning tickets were sold in the Chicago area and
in southern Illinois, and officials said the holders were expected
to come forward later this week.
   The winners beat odds of 12.9 million to 1 to pick the six
winning numbers from 1 to 54: 3, 14, 32, 40, 46 and 54.
   The jackpot beat the previous record U.S. lottery payout of
$61.98 million last October in California. That pot was split among
three winning tickets.
   The largest single winner in U.S. history remains a Florida
woman who won $55.16 million in her state's lottery in September.

<HEAD>Note Seeking God's Mercy Found In Salcido's Car; Manhunt Joined By
FBI</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACK SCHREIBMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GLEN ELLEN, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities said they found a note
asking God's forgiveness inside a man's blood-splattered car hours
after he killed five people and shortly before he slit the throats
of his three young daughters.
   Other new details also emerged about the bloody rampage in which
seven people died, including allegations that winery worker Ramon
Salcido had tried to kill the wife of a co-worker but his gun
jammed.
   Salcido continued to elude authorities today as a 5-day-old
manhunt stretched from Canada to Mexican.
   The note written in Spanish was found inside the car along with
a .22-caliber semi-automatic pistol and Salcido's Social Security
card, according to documents filed Monday in federal court in San
Francisco.
   ``Forgive me God, but this law made me do it. We could live
better, me and my children but what can I do,'' said the note filed
in support of an FBI request for a warrant charging Salcido with
unlawful flight to avoid prosection. A magistrate granted the
warrant.
   Officials did not say what ``this law'' meant, but Salcido
reportedly was upset by a court order last week to pay nearly
$6,000 in overdue child support and to make monthly payments of
$511 for a 4-year-old daughter in Fresno.
   Police found the car Friday afternoon in a San Rafael alley,
about 15 miles south of Petaluma, near where his daughters were
found Saturday.
   Police believe two of the girls were slain Friday night and left
at a trash dump. Salcido's 3-year-old daughter, Carmina, survived
despite having her throat slashed from ear-to-ear.
   Carmina, listed in stable condition at Petaluma Valley Hospital,
was asked by a detective what occurred at the dump: ``Cut her, cut
her twice,'' the girl said, making a slicing motion with her hand
across her throat, according to the documents.
   The detective then asked if her father did it. She responded,
``Yeah, yeah,'' and began to cry. Five minutes later, she said
spontaneously, ``Dad hurt me,'' according to the court papers.
   Carmina is under armed guard at the hospital, where gifts
continued to pour in.
   Her 28-year-old father _ described by some as friendly and good
worker and by others as an insanely jealous heavy drinker who used
cocaine and toted a gun _ has not been positively sighted despite
hundreds of calls from across California and as far away as Maine,
authorities said.
   Murder charges were filed Monday in Sonoma County against
Salcido in connection with the slayings of his wife, Angela, 24,
and daughters Sofia, 4, and Teresa, 1, and of co-worker Tracy
Toovey.
   The court papers said 33-year-old Kenneth Butti, who survived an
attack outside his ranch Friday, told a detective Salcido had tried
to shoot Butti's wife but the gun malfunctioned.
   Butti said ``he could hear the click as the hammer fell, but
that there was no explosion,'' according to the court papers.
   No charges have been filed in the three other slayings, of
Salcido's mother-in-law, Marian Louise Richards, 47, and her
daughters, Ruth, 12, and Marie, 8. Authorities believe they, Mrs.
Salcido and Toovey were killed Friday morning.
   Although photos and descriptions of the 5-foot-9, 180-pound
Salcido have been circulated at California airports and border
guards, Sonoma County Sheriff Richard Michaelsen speculated Salcido
hasn't strayed far.
   ``My best guess is that he's laying low,'' said Michaelsen.
``We're assuming he's in our county or in Marin County. He may be
holed up waiting for the media attention to ease up.''
   However, FBI spokesman Chuck Latting acknowleged that Salcido,
who entered the United States illegally but is a legal resident,
could try to slip back to his native Mexico.
   To aid the search, a $15,000 reward has been posted.
   The uncertainty and the slayings have left many county residents
tense.
   ``People are real scared around here,'' said Dorothy McCann, a
grocery store clerk who lives in Glen Ellen with her boyfriend.
``We have a loaded gun in the cupboard. People are just looking at
each other.''

   Madonna, 30 years old and rich, says she's just
a ``working-class girl'' in some respects.
   She told Vogue magazine in its May issue that she can be a bit
of a tightwad even though the money is there.
   ``I hate waste and I hate to waste money. I don't see the point
of having more than one car. And I hate to waste food,'' said
Madonna, who reportedly made $46 million in 1988.
   ``Well, there's a difference between being born into money and
making money. I've made my money. I'm from a poor background and
basically I'm still a working-class girl in terms of my ethics,''
she said.
   Madonna told the magazine that splitting up with actor Sean Penn
after three years of marriage hurts but has not left her depressed.
   ``Sad. I'm sad about it,'' she said. ``Very sad. You can't be
married to somebody for 3{ years and then just forget him.''

   Police today arrested Saudi arms dealer
Adnan Kashoggi on a warrant issued by a U.S. judge in a
racketeering case involving Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, the
Justice Ministry announced.
   A ministry statement said Kashoggi was charged with ``illegal
property dealings'' including with real estate owned by the former
Philippines president and his wife and valuable paintings that
disappeared from Manila's Metropolitan Museum after Marcos went
into exile in February 1986.
   Kashoggi was arrested at a Bern hotel and taken to the district
jail in downtown Bern, police said.
   The reputed broker of the arms deal at the heart of the
Iran-Contra scandal was indicted in October in New York on
racketeering and other charges in a case centering on the Marcos'
alleged theft of $103 from the Philippines treasury to buy art and
real estate in New York City.
   Kashoggi, who has lived in Paris, is accused of submitting a
false document to French officials who were seeking evidence at the
request of U.S. investigators.
   He also posed as the owner of valuable paintings and New York
property secretly held by the Marcoses, prosecutors have said.
   The Swiss justice ministry statement said a warrant for his
arrest was issued March 24.
   Under the terms of a U.S.-Swiss extradition treaty, U.S.
authorities will have to formally request Kashoggi's extradition
within the next 60 days.
   Kashoggi has 10 days to file an appeal and request his release,
the announcement said. The Federal Tribunal, Switzerland's supreme
court, would have the final say if he fights an extradition order.

   Students mourning the death of reformist leader
Hu Yaobang staged a sit-in today at the Great Hall of the People,
the seat of government, to demand greater democracy, a free press
and more money for education.
   About 3,000 students from at least five Beijing universities
marched to Tiananmen Square and about 1,000 sat outside the Great
Hall, refusing to leave unless authorities agree to meet with them
and publish their grievances.
   In Shanghai, more than 1,500 students marched during the night
chanting pro-democracy slogans.
   The student marches were the largest in China since 1986-87
pro-democracy protests that resulted in Hu's forced resignation as
Communist Party chief.
   They reflected not just grief at Hu's death but students'
unhappiness with their living conditions and bleak career prospects.
   In Beijing, student representatives were allowed inside the
Great Hall to present their demands but emerged shortly after noon
to say that the only response had been to ``go home.''
   Police kept a low profile throughout the day and made no effort
to stop the demonstrations.
   Hu, who died of a heart attack Saturday at age 73, is a hero of
Chinese students because he was considered a champion of the rights
of intellectuals.
   He was forced to resign in early 1987 after being accused by
party conservatives of failing to take harsh measures against the
pro-democracy student demonstrations of December 1986 and January
1987.
   Today's Beijing protest became increasingly political in nature
as the day went on, with students who carried banners and wreathes
dedicated to Hu chanting ``Long live democracy, down with
dictatorship, overthrow bureaucracy, down with corruption!''
   Students from Beijing University and People's University were
later joined by demonstrators from Qinghua University, a prominent
engineering school, the Nationalities University, the Beijing
School of Economics and other schools.
   The student representatives allowed inside the Great Hall
demanded repudiation of past official campaigns against liberalism,
freedom of speech and of the press, more money for education and
abolition of Beijing regulations against street demonstrations.
   They also demanded that senior leaders reveal their incomes and
that the Communist Party reassess its ouster of Hu.
   March leaders placed a 15-foot banner in Hu's honor on a
monument in Tiananmen to revolutionary heroes.
   One student climbed onto the monument and demanded the
resignation of the Communist Party's ruling Politburo, a 22-member
body. The students cheered wildly and also cheered his call for a
reassessment of Hu and a government apology for past unspecified
mistakes.
   The students were surrounded by a crush of thousands of curious
Chinese workers and peasants, many from outside Beijing who were
visiting Tiananmen Square, China's symbolic center of power and a
main sightseeing attraction.
   Students sang the Internationale and national anthem and
chanted, ``Oppose dictatorship. Down with corruption. Overthrow
bureaucracy. Long live democracy.''
   Several hours after they began their protest under a hot sun,
the head of the legislature's visitor's department, Luo Xiaozha,
came out and told the students their demands ``are too big for one
person to decide on right away.'' He promised to report them to
members of the legislature's standing committee.
   Beijing University Vice President Luo Haocai urged them to
return to campus ``and rest.'' The students booed both officials
and said they would disperse only if authorities agreed to publish
a full account of their grievances in the state-run media and
arrange a meeting for them with the legislative standing committee.
   There was no immediate response to the new demands.
   ``We are disappointed in Deng Xiaoping,'' one People's
University student said of China's senior leader who first promoted
Hu but later joined in ousting him. ``A few years ago we supported
him, but in his later years he has made many mistakes, just like
Mao Tse-tung.''
   Mao, leader of China's revolution, is officially acknowledged to
have made a catastrophic mistake in allowing the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution, a violent far lefist campaign in which thousands of
people were killed or injured and tens of thousands had their
careers destroyed.
   The student said the 84-year-old Deng, like Mao, has become
reluctant to give up power and unwilling to brook any opposition.
   Jason Hurpado of Portland, Ore., an English teacher at
Shanghai's Fudan University, said the overnight demonstration in
that city broke up shortly after students reached party
headquarters.

   Police firing tear gas stormed four
factories held by strikers and arrested 175 workers today, and the
government warned it would use troops to keep vital industries
running if labor unrest spreads.
   Also today, radical students battled riot police in three cities.
   Officials said riot police seized the electronics and machinery
factories at dawn in Puchon on the western outskirts of Seoul after
strikers refused to give up. Some strikers hurled firebombs and
rocks at the officers, but police officials said they had no
reports of serious injuries.
   Radical students calling for the overthrow of President Roh
Tae-woo's government staged campus protests in Seoul and other
cities today, the eve of the anniversary of a student uprising on
April 19, 1960.
   Students hurling firebombs and rocks battled riot police in
campus clashes in the provincial cities of Chonju, Suwon and Taejon
when authorities blocked them from marching into the streets.
Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said about 2,500 students
were involved in the provincial protests.
   About 8,000 students shouting ``Down with dictatorship!'' and
''Yankee go home!'' staged a peaceful march through eastern Seoul.
Thousands of riot police watched but did not intervene apart from a
few minor scuffles.
   About 18,000 riot police were mobilized in Seoul to prevent
violent protests, officials said.
   Police stormed the Seoul office of a government lawmaker and
overpowered eight students who had attacked the office with
firebombs and then occupied it, officials said.
   ``Overthrow Roh Tae-woo,'' the students yelled during the attack.
   The government has warned that a growing wave of strikes
threatens South Korea's political stability and the economy.
   Labor Minister Chang Yung-chul urged workers and management to
settle wage disputes peacefully.
   But Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon also issued orders to use
troops and military equipment to keep vital industries running if
threatened by strikes. Kang said radicals fomenting labor unrest
would be sternly punished.
   Officials said there were no immediate plans to deploy military
forces.
   Government officials charged that militant labor unions were
trying to organize a nationwide strike to mark the May 1
international labor holiday. Union leaders have denied the charge.
   Industrial workers, many of whom are poorly paid and work long
hours in poor conditions, are demanding major wage increases to
share in South Korea's growing prosperity.
   The government ordered a major crackdown on labor disputes after
Roh warned last week that strikes threatened to hamstring the
economy. He said walkouts had cost $2.4 billion in lost production
and that exports were down $600 million so far this year.
   Two of the country's three car producers, Daewoo and Kia, said
today they had resumed partial production after being forced to
halt operations Monday.
   But Hyundai, the nation's biggest car producer, said it had not
resumed operations because of strikes and a shortage of spare parts.
   Also today, some 200 journalists staged a peaceful protest in
Seoul to denounce the government for arresting two journalists who
wanted to visit communist North Korea. The protesters said the
government was trying to suppress press freedom.

<HEAD>Sudanese Rebels Claim Capture Of Strategic Garrison Town</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudanese rebels claim to have captured a
strategic garrison town in southern Sudan where an international
relief effort is trying to avert 100,000 famine deaths.
   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army, in a Radio SPLA
broadcast monitored in Nairobi, said they had taken the town of Bor
on Monday and wiped out its garrison.
   ``Remnants are being mopped up in the forest around the town,''
the rebels said in the broadcast Monday.
   Bor lies in the heart of the southern Sudanese region targeted
by a U.N.-coordinated relief effort that hopes to deliver, before
rains begin next month, May, enough food to feed 2.3 million people
until October when the rains traditionally end.
   Failure of the project could mean starvation for 100,000 people,
say relief officials who estimate that more than 250,000 southern
Sudanese died in 1988 due to war and the famine it created.
   However, U.N. officials now concede less than half their
original target of 105,000 tons will be met due to bureaucracy,
sluggish donor support and poor planning.
   Bor is about 125 miles north of Juba, a town key in the $132
million relief effort and the government's last major stronghold in
the south.
   The rebels took up arms against Sudan's Moslem-dominated
government in Khartoum in 1983, demanding autonomy and more
economic development for the predominantly Christian and animist
African-descended south.

<HEAD>Customs Seizes Eastern Jet For 14th Time Over Cocaine</HEAD>

   Customs inspectors seized one of the few Eastern
jets still flying and fined the strike-crippled airline $1.2
million after finding 75 pounds of cocaine in a mail bag in the
cargo hold.
   The Boeing 727 confiscated on Monday was the 14th Eastern
jetliner seized since September for transporting the drug into the
country. The fine is in addition to nearly $3 million owed from
previous drug-related violations.
   Eight previous drug shipments were in bags similar to the sack
in which the cocaine was found Saturday.
   The plane landed Saturday at the end of a trip that included
stops in Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru and Panama, said Customs spokesman
Michael Sheehan.
   On top of the fine, Customs demanded a letter of credit from the
carrier before releasing the plane.
   ``We hate to kick an airline while it's down,'' Sheehan said,
``but we will not allow illegal drugs into the country.''
   Last month, the Miami-based airline filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in New York.
   Customs cashed three previous credit letters, worth about $3
million, out of concern over Eastern's financial troubles.
Normally, Customs holds the letters until it negotiates an accord
on the fine with the airline.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak expressed anger over the
seizure and the decision by Customs to cash the credit letters.
   She said Customs would have to go to bankruptcy court to get its
money.
   ``We don't think that fining airlnes and seizing their aircraft
is the way to stop drug trafficking,'' Ms. Ceremsak said.
   ``We're obviously conducting an internal investigation,'' she
said, ``Obviously, the people putting things on our aircraft are
very clever.''
   She said Eastern last year spent $3 million on security and has
not cut back on security this year, despite Eastern's drop to about
one tenth of its flight schedule since the start of the Machinists'
strike March 4.
   In a related development, eight former Eastern baggage handlers
went on trial Monday on charges of conspiring to smuggle cocaine.

   Authorities today lifted the curfew in the capital
of Soviet Georgian and searched for 14 people reported missing
after troops broke up a pro-independence demonstration in the
city's center.
   The curfew was imposed in Tbilisi after the military tried to
disperse the demonstrators on April 9 and at least 19 people were
killed. A Georgian official acknowledged Monday that one of the 19
was shot by soldiers.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, a native of Georgia and
a former Communist Party chief of the republic, said the violence
damaged President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform efforts.
   Shevardnadze has been in Georgia for more than a week trying to
ease tensions.
   ``We should learn how to communicate with the people, for the
destiny of perestroika, democratization and renewal of our society
depends on this,'' he said in remarks distributed by the official
Tass news agency. ``There is no other road.
   ``What happened in Tbilisi is a tragedy for the people. Vast
damage has thus been done to perestroika and democratization
processes.''
   Official Radio Moscow said Georgian officials decided on Monday
to lift the curfew after noting a ``substantial improvement of the
situation in the city.''
   Students were reported to be back in classes today and public
transportation was operating normally.
   Lea Umanishvili, chief editor of Georgian television in Tbilisi,
said the curfew was lifted this morning. And Zurab Lomidze, deputy
director of the Georgian news agency Gruzinform, said on Monday
that the soldiers and tanks, which arrived on April 7, would begin
leaving today.
   Ms. Umanishvili said in a telephone interview from TV
headquarters that no tanks and only a few soldiers were visible on
the streets.
   She said the Ministry of Health still was searching for 14
people listed as missing after the clash. The list consists of
three or four boys ages 11 to 13, two women, and the rest men, she
said.
   Tbilisi residents have been plastering lists to walls charging
that 100 people disappeared after the clash and that many of them
died in addition to the 19 in the official death toll.
   Rolad Beridze of the Georgian Foreign Ministry denied the rumors
of a higher death toll. He said Monday that most of the reported
disappearances had innocent explanations.
   Beridze said Monday that soldiers shot and killed one resident
who was violating the first night of the curfew on April 9. He said
two companions were wounded with the curfew violator.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said Monday that three
girls who had reportedly disappeared were found to have been taking
a vacation at a suburban resort.
   Pravda today quoted district military officials as saying that
the curfew and the military operations had cost $1.6 million.
   The area has been closed to foreign reporters.
   The demonstrations began on April 4 when protesters criticized
calls from members of the republic's ethnic Abkhazian minority to
break away because of alleged discrimination by Georgians.
   Other protesters have demanded Georgia secede from the Soviet
Union because of alleged interference from the central government.

<TEXT>
   Where there's no smoke, there's ire _
particularly when a public university in this tobacco-growing state
tries to limit smoking.
   Members of the Legislature's Tobacco Task Force raised the
threat of reprisals Monday against the University of Louisville
over a policy that took effect March 1 limiting smoking to
designated areas in 100 campus buildings.
   ``We've got basically some people that are wanting to bite the
hand that feeds them,'' said Sen. John Rogers.
   The task force ordered a study of tobacco's contribution to the
Kentucky treasury and the size of the University of Louisville's
share. The Legislature convenes in 1990 to write the budget for
higher education through 1992.
   Rep. Clay Crupper, who called for the study, said his
tobacco-growing constituents were angry about a state institution's
implied hostility toward tobacco.
   ``They pay a lot of taxes,'' said Crupper, chairman of the House
Agriculture Committee. ``I've got letter after letter, `Whatever
you do, don't let them have any of our tax dollars from tobacco
because they don't deserve it.'''
   Dan Hall, special assistant to university President Donald
Swain, and Larry Owsley, university vice president for
administration, said the policy was not a slap at tobacco growers
or discrimination against employees who smoke.
   ``We're not on any crusade. We are in this to try to regulate a
situation in a working environment,'' Owsley said.
   But the task force was unmoved.
   ``You folks remind me a lot of a teen-ager who needs money, but
you're somewhat embarrassed about your parents,'' Rogers said. ``If
something happens that the money ... you want is not forthcoming,
then I think that you're going to have to bear a part of the
burden.''
   The senator said the smoking restrictions should be scrapped.
   ``If you've got a few people that are squealing because they
don't like the smoke, which do they like the best or the least? The
smoke or the paycheck? Because tobacco is very instrumental in
paying their salaries,'' Rogers said.

   A counterfeiter's children unintentionally alerted
police when they tried to buy ice cream with phony coins, the
Communist Party daily newpaper reported today.
   Alexander Ilchenko, a factory worker in Leningrad, had been
forging coins worth the equivalent of 32 cents and exchanging them
for real coins in automatic change-making machines, Pravda said.
   Two coins escaped from Ilchenko's home mint and rolled under the
television set, and his son and daughter found them and went to buy
ice cream. The vendor noticed the coins were fakes and took the
children to police, Pravda said.
   Ilchenko was convicted of counterfeiting and given a three-year
suspended sentence, Pravda said. It did not say when the trial took
place.
   The newspaper quoted Ilchenko as testifying that he could find
no other way to get out of ``an extremely tough financial
situation.''

   Planes today searched for two crewmen missing
after a ship carrying cement sank 400 miles off Cape Cod.
Twenty-three people were rescued from a lifeboat.
   The 652-foot Star of Alexandria, bound for New York City from
Athens, sent out a distress call Monday morning, when crew members
said it began taking on water in 12-foot seas and winds of 30 to 35
mph, the Coast Guard said.
   There was no immediate explanation of what caused the ship to
founder.
   Coast Guard and Navy planes spotted a lifeboat and a life raft
and directed another merchant ship to the scene, said Coast Guard
Petty Officer Randy Midgett. The freighter picked up 23 crewmen
from the lifeboat, Midgett said.
   ``They're all in good health, some minor cuts and scrapes,'' he
said.
   However, the rescuing freighter found an empty life raft, and
two crew members were unaccounted for, the Coast Guard said.
   The crew of the Star of Alexandria was composed of various
nationalities, said Chief Petty Officer Joe Gibson, who had no
additional information on the crew.
   Built in 1966, the Star of Alexandria was registered in England
and designed to carry bulk freight. The ship is owned by Caribene
Investments Ltd. of Gibraltar, according to Bureau Veritas, a
Paris-based shipping registry.
   ``The cement is contained within the hull of the ship and it
probably went right to the bottom,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Commander
Paul Milligan.

   Abebe Mekonnen continued Ethiopa's domination of
men's marathoning and Norway's Ingrid Kristiansen turned the tables
on rival Joan Benoit Samuelson in winning the Boston Marathon.
   Mekonnen broke away from Tanzania's Juma Ikangaa with about 1{
miles left in the 26-mile, 385-yard race Monday to win in 2 hours,
9 minutes, 6 seconds, the seventh fastest time ever in the
93-year-old race.
   Mekonnen, 25, missed the 1988 Olympic marathon because his
country joined North Korea's boycott of the Seoul Games. He said he
was happy with his victory but added, ``I don't consider it my
Olympic race.''
   Ikangaa finished second in 2:09:56 and John Treacy of Ireland
came in third in 2:10:24, just as they did last last year.
   Kristiansen failed in her bid to become the first woman
marathoner to beat 2:20, but she led every step of the way and
wasn't seriously challenged in taking her second victory here.
   Her winning time of 2:24:33 was the third-fastest ever for a
woman.
   Samuelson, the 1984 Olympic champion and course record-holder at
2:22:43, struggled to come in ninth in 2:37:51. She had beaten
Kristiansen in their three previous meetings.
   Marguerite Buist of New Zealand finished second among the women
in 2:29:04 and Kim Jones of Spokane, Wash., was third in 2:29:34.
   Each of the winners received $45,000, plus appearance money. The
race drew 6,418 official entrants.

   Seven people died today in the aftershocks of a
serious earthquake that struck a remote southwestern region, the
state-run news agency said.
   The initial tremor Sunday, measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale,
was centered on Batang county, a mountainous area near Sichuan
province's western border with Tibet. At least four were reported
killed.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said today's aftershocks killed
seven people, injured 37 and destroyed 700 houses. The strongest
aftershock measured 4.4 on the Richter scale, Xinhua said.
   Communications with Batang were hampered by heavy snow Sunday
and disrupted phone lines Monday, the agency said.
   It said casualties and damage in neighboring Markam county, a
region inhabited by Tibetans, were not known because roads to the
region were blocked. The Richter scale is a gauge of energy
released by an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded
on a seismograph. A quake measuring 6 can cause severe damage in a
populated area.

   Vicious shelling across this embattled
city killed eight more people before dawn today but then subsided
long enough to allow rescuers to begin evacuating 70 wounded Moslem
civilians to a French ship.
   Pillars of flame from blazing buildings seared the darkness
overnight while Christians and Moslems pounded each other's areas
with artillery and rockets in a nightlong blitz.
   In addition to the overnight deaths, police reported 43 wounded
as the divided capital's population huddled in underground bunkers
and bomb shelters for a third straight night.
   The casualties raised the toll from six weeks of fighting to at
least 270 killed and 975 wounded, mostly civilians. By police
count, 53 people have been killed and 218 wounded in almost
non-stop artillery and rocket exchanges since sundown Saturday.
   The bombardment slackened at daybreak into intermittent
exchanges between mainly Christian army units loyal to Gen. Michel
Aoun and an alliance of Syrian troops and Moslem and Druse
militiamen.
   During the lull, rescue teams assembled the 70 wounded Moslems
in Moslem west Beirut near the home of acting Prime Minister Salim
Hoss, who heads a Moslem Cabinet vying for power with a rival
Christian government.
   On Saturday, the French navy hospital ship Rance evacuated 14
wounded Christians from the port of Jounieh, north of Beirut.
   This morning, a Lebanese vessel, the Ibrahim, left the port of
Sidon 25 miles south of Beirut with 35 of the wounded civilians and
some relatives.
   Jamal Dousouki, a wounded rescue worker, was accompanied by his
sister Sawsan. He said he was maimed Sunday when a shell exploded
in west Beirut near an ambulance he was riding in.
   The explosion ``hurled me and my colleague, Mohammed Rustom, out
of the ambulance .... I lost my leg and Rustom was seriously
wounded. I was screaming for help, but there was nobody in the
street,'' he said.
   ``Rustom crawled to me. He had enough strength in him to drag me
to the ambulance. He started it and drove slowly. He was bleeding
all the time. Shortly after we reached hospital, he passed away,''
Dousouki said, his eyes brimming with tears.
   Mustafa Itani, 20, another rescue worker who lost his left leg
and eye in the shelling last week, was in shock. To each question,
he replied only, ``I don't know.''
   The wounded were escorted by France's Minister for Humanitarian
Assistance, Bernard Kouchner, and French Ambassador Paul Blanc. The
French ruled Lebanon until 1943.
   The Lebanese ship was to make a second trip later in the day to
evacuate another 35 wounded Moslems, including 10 civil defense
workers, said Dr. Kamal Mohana Mohanna, a public health adviser to
Hoss.
   Mohanna said the evacuees will be flown from the Rance to
``hospitals in France for proper treatment.''
   The Lebanese ship was to return to port with medicine.
   Kuwait's foreign minister called Monday for an emergency meeting
of the Arab League to discuss the fighting. The foreign ministers
of the 22-member league would meet at group headquarters in Tunis,
Tunisia, but no date has been announced.
   The nightlong barrages escalated sharply around midnight,
minutes after Aoun declared in an interview with the Christian
Voice of Lebanon radio station that his forces would crush
President Hafez Assad of Syria.
   ``Lebanon will be his graveyard and that of his regime,'' Aoun
boasted, even though his forces are outnumbered by at least 3-1.
   The independent An-Nahar daily quoted Druse warlord Walid
Jumblatt, Syria's main ally in the current fighting, as saying it
was impossible for Aoun drive the Syrian army out of Lebanon.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains about 40,000
troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League mandate.
   The current fighting broke out March 8 after Aoun, who heads the
Christian Cabinet, ordered a blockade of militia-run ports. It was
part of his effort to restore state authority, which has eroded
during 14 years of civil war.

   Police arrested Saudi arms dealer Adnan
Khashoggi today on U.S. charges that he helped Ferdinand and Imelda
Marcos hide millions of dollars in paintings and property plundered
from the Philippines.
   Khashoggi, a jet-setting financier known for his big deals and
an alleged central role in the Iran-Contra affair, faces charges
stemming from ``illegal property dealings,'' a Justice Ministry
statement said.
   The Marcoses fled the Philippines in February 1986 after the
military-civilian uprising that deposed Marcos and brought
President Corazon Aquino to power. They are accused of taking an
estimated $3.5 billion in cash and property.
   The U.S. government has accused Khashoggi of fronting for Marcos
to help divert and hide the former president's ownership of real
estate and valuable art.
   Khashoggi, 54, was arrested in a Bern hotel this morning and was
taken to the district jail in downtown Bern, the ministry statement
said.
   It was not immediately known why he was in Bern but he is
reported to hold interests in several European companies. His
office in Saudi Arabia declined immediate comment on the arrest and
referred inquiries to Khashoggi's lawyer, identified as Sami Fadel,
whose whereabouts were not disclosed.
   U.S. indictments naming the Marcoses, Khashoggi, five other
people and a California bank accuse the couple of plundering more
than $100 million from the Philippine treasury to buy real estate
and expensive art objects in New York.
   Khashoggi, the reputed broker of the arms deal at the heart of
the Iran-Contra scandal, was indicted in October in New York on
racketeering and other charges in the case.
   Khashoggi, who has lived in Paris, is accused of submitting a
false document to French officials who were seeking evidence at the
request of U.S. investigators.
   He also posed as the owner of paintings and New York property
secretly held by the Marcoses, prosecutors have said.
   Specifically, he is charged with racketeering, obstruction of
justice and mail fraud. Conviction of the charges would carry
penalities ranging from five to 20 years in prison.
   The Philippines claims that after the Marcoses went into exile
in Hawaii, their agents and Khashoggi carted away 25 paintings from
New York properties owned by the Marcoses. The action allegedly
came after a California federal judge ordered that none of the
Marcoses' property could be moved.
   Khashoggi allegedly sold 12 paintings for $3.2 million.
   The Swiss Justice Ministry statement said a warrant for
Khashoggi's arrest was issued March 24.
   Under the terms of a U.S.-Swiss extradition treaty, U.S.
authorities will have to formally request Khashoggi's extradition
within the next 60 days.
   Khashoggi has 10 days to file an appeal and request his release,
the announcement said. The Federal Tribunal, Switzerland's supreme
court, would have the final say if he fights an extradition order.
   Khashoggi, born in Mecca as the oldest son of the personal
physician of the late King Ibn Saud, has been in the headlines for
decades.
   Known for his flamboyant lifestyle and negotiating talents,
Khashoggi figured in several kickback scandals with U.S. aircraft
manufacturers paying him large amounts for arranging multi-billion
dollar defense contracts.
   He was also involved in the Iran-Contra affair in which proceeds
from sales of U.S. arms to Iran allegedly were funneled to
U.S.-backed rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist government.
   At one time, published reports estimated his personal wealth at
up to $4 billion. But declining oil prices and stricter control of
arms dealings were said to reduced his fortune.
   Mrs. Marcos has pleaded innocent to the charges contained in the
U.S. indictment. Marcos has said he is too ill to appear in New
York for legal proceedings.

<TEXT>
   The statue shows Justice as blind, and federal
appeals Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg says it sometimes needs to be
invisible as well.
   Ginsburg proved his point by deleting two-thirds of his dissent
in a case before releasing it publicly. Ginsburg said he was
withholding 12 of the 18 pages because his opinion was based on
secret government information, The Washington Post and The
Washington Times reported today.
   Civil liberties lawyers were quick to criticize the highly
unusual procedural step, and one likened it to secret actions of
the notorious Star Chamber that existed in England until 1641.
   ``It's bad enough to have secret evidence,'' said Kate Martin,
director of the American Civil Liberties Union project on national
security litigation. ``His dissent is an effort to write secret
law.''
   Ginsburg's opinion was issued in a suit alleging the FBI, as
part of its domestic surveillance program of the 1950s and 1960s,
engaged in illegal activity to discredit a New York man who was a
Communist Party member.
   The plaintiff alleged that government agents planted a
fictitious report in a car he used, causing Communist Party members
to think he was a government informant and expel him from the party
in 1964.
   The government wanted the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia to order a lower court to dismiss the case without
hearing it because it didn't want to release material that the
defense wanted to obtain through pre-trial discovery proceedings.
The appeals court rejected the government request.
   The appeals court majority said the government had not presented
compelling evidence that disclosure of its activities 20 and 30
years ago would result in disclosure of state secrets today.
   But Ginsburg, whose nomination to the Supreme Court was
withdrawn two years ago after it was revealed he had smoked
marijuana, said the lower court had ignored the government's
``legitimate and compelling interest in preventing disclosure of
exceedingly sensitive national security information,'' the
newspaper said.
   However, major portions of the judge's dissent were deleted from
the version released publicly and also from that given to the
plaintiff's lawyers. Only government lawyers were allowed to see
the full version.
   The Post and Times said court officials could not remember any
other instances in which the appellate court here had issued a
secret opinion.
   Mark Lynch, former head of the ACLU national security project,
told the Post: ``This is unusual and goes further than any case I'm
aware of. On the face of it, it's troubling. Our whole system of
law depends on court decisions being public.''

way, but with his engineer's mind he might have liked the
groundbreaking use of computers for a campus vote today at his alma
mater.
   State and county officials are watching the vote at Stanford
University _ where the nation's 31st president was elected the
school's first student body treasurer 95 years ago _ as a test of
whether computers terminals replacing paper ballots can attract
voters, prevent fraud and keep out hackers.
   If turnout is as high as expected, the election will be the
biggest ever taken by computer terminal in the United States.
   The election, using about 70 university-owned or rented Apple
Macintosh computers and software written by a sophomore, is
expected to cost at least $3,000 less than the $13,000 spent last
year.
   The votes are expected to counted within two hours after the
polls close Wednesday night, instead of the five days it took last
year.
   ``We're observing the Stanford election as an interesting
experiment,'' said John Mott-Smith, coordinator of voter outreach
for the California secretary of state.
   Among the questions Mott-Smith and county officials have are how
``user friendly'' and how secure the system is, compared with paper
ballots that always can be examined and recounted.
   ``The bottom line is the people have to have confidence that the
system is accurate,'' Mott-Smith said.
   The Stanford program developed by Sandy Aronson requires the
13,000 students eligible to vote to punch in their names and school
ID numbers to prevent them from voting more than once.
   ``If the computer detects that it's being tampered with in some
manner, it will make a lot of loud noises and alert the poll
watcher,'' said Steven Krauss, elections commissioner and a
sophomore.
   Other schools using computerized elections have had minor
problems amid overall encouraging results, those involved say. At
Boston University last week, a disk failure caused 248 of the 3,159
votes cast to go uncounted.
   At Stanford, about 5,000 students generally vote, Krauss said.
Nearly 100 candidates are running for various offices.
   Paper ballots will be used by students at Stanford's three
overseas campuses and by those who refuse to use the computers.
   ``There will probably always be people on campus who don't know
how to use a Mac and are dreadfully afraid of using the machine,''
Krauss said.

   The nation's biggest school system plans to
teach its students not to carry guns.
   Schools Chancellor Richard Green on Monday announced a week-long
``teach-in'' next week for all students on the dangers of guns,
with a list of suggested activities.
   The youngest could prepare art work warning about guns, for
example; the oldest could hold debates or write model gun laws.
   ``Violence and weapons have no place in schools,'' Green wrote
to parents of the system's nearly 1 million pupils. Yet, he noted,
guns and other weapons are confiscated in the schools daily.
   Green called for help at home with the program, asking that
parents teach nonviolence and caution against drug use, which was
linked to the prevalence of weapons. He also warned that children
caught with weapons would be suspended.
   About 200 guns were confiscated from pupils in 1987-88, the last
school year for which figures were available, said Board of
Education spokesman Bob Terte.
   In a separate program, the board has been placing monitors with
hand-held metal detectors at the entrances to five high schools, on
a rotating basis. That program is being expanded to 10 more schools
in September.
   No weapons have been found on pupils, but some weapons turn up
in the bushes outside when word gets out that the monitors are
present, Terte said.

<TEXT>
   District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry was
noticeably absent when federal drug czar William J. Bennett held a
meeting with area officials on his emergency plan to fight the
capital's drug plague.
   Bennett insisted Monday there was nothing to stop him and Barry
from working together, despite Bennett's statement a week earlier
that Washington's drug problem is so out of control that ``serious
questions of local politics and governance can no longer be avoided
or excused.''
   Barry testified before a congressional committee while Bennett
was briefing local officials on his plan to curb drug use and
drug-related violence in the District.
   Washington became the nation's murder capital last year with 372
murders, most of them drug-related. So far this year, there have
been 150 slayings, compared with 99 at the same time in 1988.
   Five homicides were recorded Monday, including one in which a
female police sergeant was slain by a fire inspector who then
killed himself in what authorities called a love triangle. Police
said it was one of the bloodiest days in the city since seven
Hanafi Muslims were killed at their headquarters on Jan. 18, 1973.
   Barry's effectiveness in the fight has been criticized because
of his friendship with Charles Lewis, indicted last week on drug
charges, and a federal investigation of his own conduct.
   Bennett said Monday that he had not spoken directly with Barry
since the plan was announced April 10, but he said Barry had been
invited to the meeting and he urged reporters to drop the
personality issue.
   ``We are not in the process of developing a relationship,''
Bennett said. ``We are trying to respond to the drug problem. This
issue about whether Marion Barry and I will stand up in public and
put our arms around each other is not the issue, and you ought to
get off it.''
   Barry, meanwhile, was asking the Senate Appropriations
Committee's District of Columbia panel to assign 500 federal police
officers to Washington's police force to handle routine police
duties while regular city police battle the drug dealers. That $36
million proposal was not included in Bennett's plan.
   Barry also requested congressional help in persuading the Navy
to relinquish land the city seeks for a new prison facility.
Bennett had taken the city to task for failing to build a new
500-bed pretrial detention facility although it received $50
million from Congress three years ago to do so. Construction has
been held up by court battles.
   Barry on Monday also signed emergency legislation establishing a
curfew for most teen-agers and a temporary ordinance allowing
police to bar people from gathering on city streets.
   The legislation marks the city's second curfew attempt, after
the first one was challenged in court.
   Bennett's hourlong private meeting Monday with the local
officials was triggered by their confusion over what Bennett's plan
meant to them.
   The plan called for creation of a metropolitan area task force
of law enforcement agents with an additional 57 federal officials
assigned to the area, as well as construction of the pretrial
detention facility and a 700-bed federal prison.
   The local officials were concerned about whether the war on
drugs would end at the District boundary line and whether they
would get stuck with a new prison or pretrial detention facility
housing Washington's evil-doers.
   Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke attended the sesion, saying
afterward that ``there were still many more questions than answers
today.''
   But the prison issue was defused somewhat over the weekend when
Bennett's staff reversed earlier statements and said Bennett did
not anticipate the need for two new prisons in Maryland. One
federal prison is already being planned in Cumberland in Allegany
County.
   But the site for the pretrial detention facility has not yet
been decided, and Bennett refused to speculate on where it might be
built.
   Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, a critic of Bennett's plan as
being too limited, met with Bennett later in the day.

<TEXT>
   Investigators have found no
evidence linking two jailed Palestinians to the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103, even though a similar bomb was seized in a probe of the
suspected terrorists, officials said today.
   A 35-year-old federal police officer was killed and another was
critically wounded Monday when they tried to disarm the bomb.
   Alexander Prechtel of the federal prosecutor's office said
investigators only have ``very vague'' indications the two
Palestinians held by West German authorities may have been involved
in the Pan Am disaster.
   All 259 people aboard the Pan Am plane and 11 on the ground died
in the Dec. 21 terrorist attack in which a bomb disguised as a
radio-cassette player blew up the jet over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   A similar bomb hidden in a radio tuner exploded at the federal
police headquarters in Wiesbaden on Monday as two experts were
trying to defuse it.
   The 29-year-old officer who survived the blast was fighting for
his life today, said Willy Terstiege, a spokesman for the
Bundeskriminalamt, the federal police headquarters.
   Jochen Schroers, spokesman for the Frankfurt prosecutor's office
involved in the Pan Am investigation, said Monday's blast ``has
nothing whatsoever to do with our investigation.''
   The two Palestinians, alleged members of the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, remain in
investigative custody in West Germany following their arrest in
October after what police said was the biggest illegal weapons bust
in the nation's history.
   Prechtel said the bomb that exploded Monday was discovered
during investigation of the Palestinians, but he and other
officials declined to say when or where the explosive device was
found.
   Terstiege said two bombs were delivered to the Wiesbaden
headquarters Monday by authorities in the West German state of
North Rhine-Westphalia, where part of the October weapons
confiscation took place.
   Security sources, who requested anonymity, said the bombs were
discovered in raids on suspected Palestinian terrorist hideouts.
They also declined to say when or where the bombs were found.
   Officials of the Hesse state prosecutor's office, which is
investigating Monday's explosion, refused to comment on how similar
that bomb was to the one that blew up the Pan Am jet.
   Investigators in the Pan Am case have concluded the plane was
blown out of the sky when a detonator sensitive to changes in air
pressure set off plastic explosives packed into a radio
cassette-player in a suitcase.
   An identically disguised bomb containing Czechoslovak-made
plastic explosives was among the large quantity of weapons and
explosives seized in October raids of suspected hideouts of the
Popular Front in Frankfurt and Neuss.
   Police arrested 14 suspects in the October raids but only the
two remain in custody: Hafez Kassem Dalkamoni and Abdul Fattah
Ghandanfar.
   Prechtel said they are suspected of trying to set up terrorist
cells in West Germany.
   ``We have no evidence that the two might have been involved in
the Lockerbie bombing,'' Prechtel told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview from Karlsruhe.
   ``British investigators said the Pan Am explosion was caused by
the same type of (plastic) explosive that was found in Frankfurt,''
he said. ``But they haven't given us any proof of this.''
   CBS News last week cited unidentified U.S. government officials
as alleging that 21-year-old Khalid Jaafar unwittingly carried the
bomb aboard the plane in his baggage.
   But Prechtel said evidence shows that Jaafar, one of the victims
of the bombing, was innocent.
   ``As far as I know, the British have said the bomb was in a hard
suitcase,'' Prechtel said Monday. ``Mr. Jaafar seems to be
innocent. We know Mr. Jaafar had two small, soft-covered bags, so
we have no evidence that someone gave him a bomb.''

   GPA Group Ltd. today announced it was ordering 308
planes, the largest single purchase of aircraft in aviation history.
   The $16.8 billion order will be shared by the American companies
Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas, and Airbus, a European consortium,
officials of the Irish aircraft-leasing company said.
   A similar announcement was made in London today, and a news
conference was scheduled for New York as well.
   The biggest previous aviation order _ worth $10.5 billion _ was
placed by Delta Air Lines last September for 225 orders and options
on Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas airplanes.
   The current order combines with previous orders announced in
1986 to bring the total GPA buying program to 819 planes worth
about $30 billion. That figure includes some planes already
delivered.

<TEXT>
   A series of bombs today blacked out most
of the capital, damaged a government office, and injured one man at
the start of a one-day general strike against the military
government, police said.
   There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the
attacks. However, leftist urban guerrillas have often bombed
electric towers while battling the 15-year-old regime of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet.
   Today's explosions began shortly after midnight, destroying
several power towners and blacking out large areas of this city of
4.5 million people. Some neighborhoods remained without power well
into the morning.
   Several other bombs went off around Santiago, injuring one man
and damaging the government office, a bank and other buildings,
police said.
   It was not immediately clear if the strike had succeeded. Public
transportation was reduced, but thousands of workers walked to
their jobs or took the few operating buses.
   The government said Monday it had taken ``all the necessary
measures'' to prevent disorder and urged people to go to work.
Police were reported on maximum alert, and officers with machine
guns guarded some street corners.
   The strike was called by the United Workers Central, the
nation's largest labor federation.
   It is demanding freedom for its two top leaders, who were
banished to provincial towns last year for calling a strike in
October 1987. That strike was the last mass protest against the
government.
   The labor group also wants an increase in the monthly minimum
wage from $59 to $100.
   Diego Olivares, the labor group's acting president, said Monday
the strike should be peaceful.
   However, some leftist groups called for street demonstrations
today in Santiago and other cities. Police said they would not
allow such protests.
   A series of mass protests shook the government from 1983 to
1986, leaving at least 200 dead.

   Sir Peter Taylor began a government-ordered
investigation of Europe's worst soccer disaster today, as a
14-year-old boy lost his fight for life and brought the death toll
to 95.
   Taylor, a lord justice of appeal, said he wants to ensure
similar tragedies never occur.
   In Switzerland, Europe's chief soccer executive apologized for
comparing English fans to wild animals. But Jacques Georges,
president of the European Union of Football Associations, also has
indicated that fans' behavior at the club semifinal in Sheffield
may keep British clubs barred from European cup tournaments,
despite a recent vote to readmit them in 1990.
   Of 170 people injured Saturday, 25 still are being treated in
Sheffield. Nineteen are in intensive care.
   A coroner was to start an inquest today to determine the cause
of six of the deaths. Police have identified all the victims except
the boy who died today.
   Newspaper reports indicated the deaths may have been caused by a
police officer's attempt to prevent a fatal accident among fans
pressing to get into Sheffield's Hillsborough stadium.
   In Liverpool, nine injured fans filed writs in the High Court
seeking damages for personal injuries. The writs allege negligence
or breach of duty against South Yorkshire police and the Sheffield
Wednesday soccer club whose stadium was the scene of the disaster.
   Before heading to the stadium, Taylor held a news conference
with West Midlands Chief Constable Geoffrey Dear, who is conducting
a separate inquiry into the actions of South Yorkshire police.
   ``I would respectfully say to all those who are disposed to
comment on this terrible disaster that it would be better for us to
wait to ascertain the facts before proposing any solutions,''
Taylor said.
   He promised his inquiry will cover all aspects of the tragedy,
including the behavior of fans outside the match, policing, sports
ground safety, crowd control and government plans to require soccer
fans carry identity cards.
   ``The focus of the inquiry will be to find out what happened and
make recommendations as to how this situation can be avoided in the
future,'' Taylor said.
   Evidence from fans would form an important part of the inquiry,
which will include public hearings, he said.
   Dear said evidence from the police inquiry will be passed to
Taylor and the coroner.
   ``This inquiry is seeking the truth and to cut away the
mythology that is beginning to grow,'' he said.
   The disaster occurred Saturday at an English Football
Association Cup semifinal between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.
   All the victims were Liverpool fans either crushed against a
crowd-control fence in front of a standing-room-only terrace or
trampled or suffocated by the panicked crowd.
   Officials and fans accuse police of letting thousands of fans
into the stadium late and then responding too slowly when
late-comers crushed fans against the 10-foot-high fence. There also
are charges some fans had forged tickets or no tickets at all for
the sold-out match at the stadium, which has a capacity for 54,000.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, the Cabinet member responsible for
police, told Parliament on Monday the government may ban
standing-room-only terraces at major soccer clubs.
   He also said the police officer's decision to open the outer
gate will be a central question for Taylor's inquiry. Survivors say
4,000 fans were pushing at the turnstiles trying to get inside.
   The Times of London today said Superintendent Roger Marshall
ordered the gate be opened because he feared late-comers would
force the collapse of a wall next to the gate.
   The judge who headed an inquiry into the 1985 Bradford fire when
56 people died cautioned today that large crowds always breed
danger and absolute safety can never be guaranteed.
   ``There are no easy solutions. You can make recommendation after
recommendation but at the end of the day there is always a human
element,'' Sir Oliver Popplewell told The Associated Press.
``Balancing the problem of hooliganism with the problems of safety
and from other sources is a very complex matter.''
   England's football association gave the go-ahead Monday for the
cup competition to continue. But the Liverpool team decided today
to postpone for one week a decision on whether to participate any
more this year.

   A U.S. attack jet on a training flight
crashed near this village in eastern England, killing the pilot and
scattering ammunition over a stretch of farmland, officials said
today.
   Authorities cordoned off the site after army officials warned of
the danger from the ammunition of the A-10 Thunderbolt II that went
down Monday about 20 miles north of the university town of
Cambridge.
   The crash killed Capt. Donald R. Roberts, 29, of Rochester,
N.Y., said a spokesman for the 3rd U.S. Air Force in Britain.
   The spokesman said earlier that a second member of the two-man
crew ejected before the crash and parachuted to safety. However,
officials later corrected that report, saying only the pilot was
aboard.
   The plane was on a routine training mission from the nearby
Bentwaters air base, said the spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The spokesman said the plane carried practice ammunition that
had a propellant charge, not an explosive charge. But he cautioned
against anyone handling the shells.
   Experts from Bentwaters, 72 miles east of London, warned
Cambridgeshire police about the danger of the scattered ammunition
and police warned the public to stay clear of the crash site.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association said the
crash brought down overhead power lines and that it was the second
A-10 crash in Cambridgeshire in 13 days and the third in five
months.
   The Thunderbolt II is a ``tank-buster'' specializing in
low-level ground support maneuvers. It was built to carry
air-to-surface missiles and a 30mm cannon.

   Authorities may block off the house
where Adolf Hitler was born on the 100th anniversary of the Nazi
dictator's birth, an official said today.
   ``There is concern that the house may be the target of
attacks,''said a local official speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said authorities were considering closing Salzburger Vorstadt
street, where the house is located, on Thursday, the anniversary of
Hitler's birth. He said the street also may be closed Wednesday.
   Hitler lived there only in the first three years of his life,
but the house has been the subject of controversy and occasionally
the target of neo-Nazi activities. It is privately owned, leased by
the government and now houses a day nursery.
   Newspapers reported authorities received threats and word that
ultra-rightist groups were planning to meet in Braunau on Thursday.
   ``We cannot take any risks. The terror threats must be taken
seriously,'' Johan Gruber, a prefecture spokesman told the daily
Oberoesterreichische Nachrichten.
   The newspaper said some 300 law enforcement officers were
expected to be deployed Thursday.
   Authorities were concerned there not be a repeat of events 10
years ago on Hitler's birthday, when uniformed neo-Nazis caused
disturbances near the house, the newspaper said.
   Owners of the 20 shops nearby threatened to take legal action if
the street is closed, according to the newspaper.

<TEXT>
   A jury rejected a plea of insanity and convicted a
stockbroker of murdering his former boss one day after being fired.
   Superior Court Judge John Irwin immediately sentenced
42-year-old Lonnie Gilchrist to life in prison Monday in the 1988
shooting death of George Cook.
   The jury, which began deliberations on Thursday, rejected
Gilchrist's claim that he was in the grips of a paranoid psychosis.
   One day after he was fired in 1988 for not meeting performance
levels, Gilchrist entered Cook's Merrill Lynch office and shot the
regional vice president three times with a .22-caliber pistol as
the executive sat behind his desk.
   Witnesses said that as Cook crawled toward his door crying for
help, Gilchrist shot him twice more, beat and kicked him and
yelled, ``No billionaire is going to do this to me!''
   Steven R. Lively, another Merrill Lynch employee and a former
Boston College football star, tackled Gilchrist in Cook's office
and held him until authorities arrived.
   Defense attorney Norman Zalkind argued that Gilchrist's
childhood with an abusive and alcoholic father left him feeling
persecuted and blaming prejudice for his failures. Gilchrist, who
is black, had gone to the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People to file a complaint against Merrill Lynch.
   Before the shooting, Gilchrist completed a $125,000 bond
transaction, canceled a dental appointment and told co-workers he
was going to teach Cook a lesson. Assistant District Attorney
Ronald Moynahan said Gilchrist's business-as-usual manner showed he
was in control at the time.
   ``I think it's very important that the word go out that our
criminal justice system (is) determined by jurors of our peers and
not by the psychiatrists of the world,'' Moynahan said after the
verdict.
   Gilchrist graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's
Wharton School.
   Lively, who is black, quit the firm three months after the
shooting and filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission
Against Discrimination accusing Merrill Lynch releasing his name to
offset bad publicity on race relations.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher today praised
greater freedom of expression in the Soviet Union and defended her
ban on broadcast interviews with members of the Irish Republican
Army.
   Opening a 35-nation conference on improving the exchange of
information between the East and West, Mrs. Thatcher also
reiterated that Britain will not bow to Moslem demands to ban
Salman Rusdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses.'' Many Moslems consider
the book blasphemous.
   Mrs. Thatcher said the novel ``broke none of our laws.''
   ``There must never be an area where the government has
discretion (to censor); it must always act within the law,'' she
said.
   The meeting of government officials, journalists and other
delegates from Eastern and Western Europe, the United States and
Canada, follows an East-West Conference on Security and Cooperation
in Europe held in January.
   The Vienna conference ended with participants committing to
facilitate news reporting and improve working conditions for
journalists. The London meeting is aimed partly at assessing
whether countries have lived up to their promises.
   Western nations are expected to use the month-long conference,
known as the Information Forum, to test the scope of Soviet
glasnost, or openness.
   Mrs. Thatcher said major changes in the Soviet Union and East
bloc countries now allow ``greater freedom to express views and
opinions that are not necessarily those of governments and ruling
parties.''
   But she said there was still distance to go.
   ``There will only be a common European home if the occupants can
mingle and talk freely,'' Mrs. Thatcher said, referring to Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev's comment that the West should view the
Soviets as part of Europe.
   There was speculation that Eastern bloc countries will react to
Western prodding on freedom of expression and human rights with
jibes that Mrs. Thatcher has curbed the media.
   As well as the IRA ban, imposed last year, critics point to her
attempts to ban the publication of ``Spycatcher,'' the memoirs of a
retired intelligence agent, and to what they regard as inadequate
proposals for the reform of Britain's secrecy laws.
   ``I make no apology for measures taken to prevent men of
violence using television and radio to spread fear and create an
illusion of authority,'' Mrs. Thatcher said. ``Terrorists have no
respect for freedom. They exploit freedom only to undermine it,''
she said.

   Three rivers flooded their banks and a
cotton-growing region in Uzbekistan, destroying 300 homes and
submerging 300 more, Tass news agency reported today.
   More than 2,000 people were evacuated in time and no one was
killed when the flood hit the Andizhan region of the Central Asian
republic Monday evening, the Soviet agency said.
   The Mailisai, Tentaksai, and Chirtaksai rivers swelled because
of torrential rains, carrying away the seeds planted for thousands
of acres of cotton and other crops, Tass said.
   Residents are building dikes against the rivers' waters, which
remain high, it said.

   Twelve cars of a New Delhi-bound
passenger train derailed today in central India, killing at least
32 people and injuring more than 80, officials said.
   Twelve people died at the accident site and 20 succumbed at
Lalitpur Hospital, according to Matthew John, director of railway
safety for the Railway Ministry.
   Twenty of 80 people hospitalized were in critical condition, he
said. An undetermined number of other injured passengers were
awaiting transportation to hospitals, he said.
   The 21-car Karnataka Express left the southern city of Bangalore
on Monday and had been scheduled to reach the Indian capital late
today. John said the train derailed at 2:30 p.m. in a remote area
between Lalitpur and Telwara stations in Madhya Pradesh state, 280
miles south of New Delhi.
   O.P. Sood, deputy director for railway safety, said 12 cars left
the tracks and ``heavy casualties were feared.''
   Initial reports said nine cars flipped over after leaving the
tracks, but John said that was incorrect.
   About 16 of the train's 21 cars carried passengers, Sood said.
The total number of people aboard the train was not immediately
known.
   Railway Minister Madhav Rao Scindia reached the site shortly
after the derailment and was supervising rescue and relief
operations, Sood said.
   Ambulances with doctors and medicines were rushed to the scene
from the neighboring towns of Jhansi and Bina, United News of India
reported.

<HEAD>Principals Challenge School Reform Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The principals' union has gone to court to
challenge a reform plan that would strip them of tenure and give
parents more of a say over schools.
   ``Principals should be the (chief executive officer) of their
schools rather than a political person that works at the whim of
the council,'' said Bruce Berndt, president of the Chicago
Principals Association.
   ``Tenure, we feel, is a necessary component for principals to
take them out of the political arena.''
   The association, which represents 450 of the district's 505
principals, some of whom work at more than one school, filed suit
Monday in state court.
   The lawsuit questions the constitutionality of the election
process for parent-controlled local school councils at each of
Chicago's 595 public schools and challenges a provision that strips
principals of tenure.
   Donald Moore, executive director of Designs for Change, an
education advocacy agency that helped write the law, said that if
successful, the lawsuit would cut the heart out of school reform in
the 410,000-student system.
   ``We always felt that two of the most vital elements of the bill
were to give parents a majority voice in the education of their
children and to eliminate principal tenure so that principals could
be held accountable for their performance,'' said Moore.
   Under the reform law, to take effect next month, parent-majority
councils would be elected by mid-October at each school.
   Parents would elect parents, teachers would choose teachers and
the community would elect its representatives _ a process the
lawsuit called unconstitutional.
   The councils, to be composed of six parents, two community
leaders and a principal, would evaluate principals and recommend
dismissing unsatisfactory ones.
   Under the law, principals also would be placed on four-year
performance contracts.

   He explained to the children that he wanted them to go back to

   Mexican police say they believe the
``witch'' of a murderous cult of drug smugglers has been killed on
orders from the group's leader, but a Texas sheriff says he
suspects a ruse by the two fugitives.
   U.S. and Mexican authorities have sought Sara Villareal Aldrete,
a 24-year-old student at a Texas college living in Mexico, since
the first of 15 victims of the cult were unearthed at a ranch south
of the U.S. border last week.
   She was at first believed to be accompanying the reputed
``padrino,'' or godfather, of the cult, Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo,
26. But the Houston Chronicle and Houston Post reported that police
believe he may have ordered her death.
   ``She may have known too much. She may have been ordered killed
_ maybe by the padrino. We believe she could have been killed and
buried in Mexico (City),'' Juan Benitez Ayala, commander of the
Federal Judicial Police in Matamoros, told the Chronicle.
   Mexican police believe Constanzo and two companions flew from
McAllen to Mexico City on April 10 and then to Miami the next day,
the day 12 mutilated bodies were found on a ranch 20 miles west of
Matamoros, said Benitez.
   Cameron County Sheriff Alex Perez, based in this border city,
said he believes Ms. Aldrete is alive, even though Mexican
officials reported finding her purse, her passport and $15,000 in a
Mexico City apartment.
   ``It just might be a put-on,'' Perez said. ``If they did find a
purse or found the passport, that may have been just a trick by
Sara and Constanzo to (appear) she is dead. All these crooks work
that way. ... To me, she is still alive.''
   U.S. authorities have arrested one man and issued warrants for
two others in the growing international investigation. Mexican
authorities earlier arrested four people.
   Investigators believe the drug smugglers committed grisly human
sacrifices to protect themselves from the law.
   Serafin Hernandez Rivera of Brownsville was arrested Monday in
Houston on charges of marijuana importation, possession and
conspiracy. He belongs to a family suspected of involvement in drug
trafficking for at least 12 years, said Oran Neck, chief Customs
agent in Brownsville.
   Neck said warrants also were issued for Martin Quintana and
Malio Fabio, two Mexican citizens believed to have participated in
the sacrificial slaying and mutilation of University of Texas
student Mark Kilroy, who disappeared while vacationing along the
border during spring break.
   The two were among six suspects who remained at large and were
considered dangerous, Neck said.
   Hernandez is the fifth suspect to be arrested. His father,
Brigido Hernandez, owns the northern Mexico ranch where human
sacrifice was practiced by the cult in the belief it would bring
magical protection to the group's illicit business, authorities
said. The father is not accused.
   Serafin Hernandez's son, Serafin Hernandez Garcia Jr., and
brother, Elio Hernandez Rivera, are among the four suspects in
custody in Matamoros, across the border from Brownsville. Formal
Mexican charges were expected to be filed against them today.
   Saul Hernandez Rivera, brother of Hernandez Sr. and Elio
Hernandez, was machine-gunned to death last year in Mexico in a
drug-related execution, Neck said.
   Authorities have identified Constanzo's two companions as
Quintana and Alvaro de Leon Valdez.
   A person who answered the telephone at the Mexican police office
in Matamoros early today said Benitez was not available and there
wasn't anyone else who could comment on the case. Calls to the
Customs office in Brownsville late Monday weren't returned.
   The filing of Mexican charges against the four men in custody
was delayed by the discovery on Sunday of two bodies on a
collective farm two miles south of the Santa Elena ranch.
   The two victims were identified as Moises Castillo, 52, of
Houston, and Hector de la Fuente, 39, of Ejido San Francisco, west
of Matamoros, both of whom had been missing since May. They did not
appear to have been tortured or mutiliated like other victims,
authorities said.
   Jose Piedad Silva Arroyo, Mexico's chief federal narcotics
investigator for northeastern Tamaulipas state, said authorities
were considering adding the two victims' deaths to the murder,
kidnapping, drug and weapons charges pending against the four
suspects.
   Officials said the two victims were drug dealers somehow
involved with the cult, and Neck said the men were executed in a
drug deal that went bad. Relatives of the two men denied they had
any connection with drug trafficking.

   Four masked assailants today killed a
Palestinian woman in the occupied West Bank, claiming she
collaborated with Israel, Arab reports said. Fifteen Palestinians
were reported wounded in clashes with soldiers.
   The West Bank and the occupied Gaza Strip were virtually shut
down by a general strike called to protest the army's alleged use
of confiscated Arab-owned cars to make surprise raids on
Palestinian villages.
   The Israeli newspapers Maariv and Al-Hamishmar reported the army
was investigating slogans found on walls in the Gaza Strip in
recent days calling on Arabs to ``gather firearms'' for renewed
revolt against Israel.
   Arab reporters said the graffiti called only for keeping up the
``armed struggle,'' a standard slogan of the 16-month Palestinian
uprising. The Palestinians' main weapons have been stones and
firebombs, and the use of guns would mean greater violence.
   The wounding of 15 Palestinians today came during at least four
separate clashes between Israeli troops and stone-throwing
protesters in the Gaza Strip, Arab reports said. The army said it
was checking the reports.
   A 14-year-old Arab boy also was wounded just outside Jerusalem
when an Israeli truck driver fired on stone-throwing youths, Israel
radio said. The youth was hospitalized in critical condition.
   The army said the boy apparently was shot by a garbage truck
driver after the vehicle was stoned in Al Azariye village, or
biblical Bethany.
   On Monday, six Arabs died, including two teen-agers shot by
soldiers and a man and a woman killed in a family feud in Gaza City
that some reports said was sparked by allegations of collaboration
with Israel.
   The army today denied that soldiers had killed one of the
victims, a 13-year-old girl from Dheishe refugee camp, which was
the scene of one of Monday's worst clashes.
   ``A complete investigation has shown that there is no connection
between any army action and the girl's death,'' the army
spokeswoman said.
   The spokeswoman, who is not identified under military
regulations, refused to elaborate on other possible causes of the
girl's death and said the girl's family took her body for burial.
   The army also said the circumstances were unclear in the Gaza
City deaths and in the stabbing death this morning of a 43-year-old
woman in the West Bank city of Nablus.
   Nadira Boulus reportedly was stabbed by four attackers masked
with Arab headdresses who broke into her home. Arab reports said
the attackers' supporters ringed the woman's house during the
stabbing.
   Ms. Boulus' death raised the number of Palestinians killed in
the uprising o 439. Eighteen Israelis also have died in the revolt.
   Arab and Israeli reports said the circumstances of the deaths in
Gaza City of Kamal Khalil Ayad, 30, and Rifkah Abdel Hamid Ayad,
52, were unclear. Some reports said a family feud erupted over
accusations of collaboration with Israel.
   Both the Gaza City victims suffered multiple bullet wounds to
the head and chest. The relationship between them was not known.
   Arab reports said two other members of the family, a 3-year-old
girl and a 25-year-old man, also were shot. The army said two
people were killed and three wounded in the incident.
   During the Palestinian uprising, more than 65 of the
Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs on suspicion of
helping Israel.

   A Senate committee today approved a new
attempt to write into law a fairness doctrine that would require
broadcasters to air opposing sides of controversial issues.
   The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, on a
voice vote, sent the measure on to the full Senate. A companion
measure is awaiting floor action in the House.
   Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., voted against the bill, and
Committee Chairman Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., noted that Sen. Bob
Packwood, R-Ore., also opposed the bill, although he was not
present for today's vote.
   Critics such as Packwood contend that the fairness doctrine,
which was promulgated in the 1940s on the principle that radio and
television spectrum was scare, is outdated is this era of cable TV,
satellites and video cassette recorders.
   Broadcasters claim the doctrine exerts a ``chilling effect'' on
discussions of controversial issues and is an unconstitutional
infringement on their First Amendment rights.
   But the bill's primary sponsor, Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii,
said the need for such legislation is greater than ever. He said
there is evidence broadcasters have been devoting less time to
controversial issues since the Federal Communications Commission
repealed its fairness doctrine in 1987.
   A virtually identical measure passed Congress in 1987 but was
vetoed by then-President Reagan, who said it violated the First
Amendment.
   The Justice Department told Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman
of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, that it was
recommending that President Bush veto the new bill if it passes
Congress.

<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a major victory for
consumers, today upheld state laws that allow those indirectly
affected by illegal price-fixing to sue for monetary damages.
   By a 7-0 vote,the court reinstated efforts by four states _
California, Minnesota, Alabama and Arizona _ to participate in a
multimillion-dollar settlement of a nationwide conspiracy to fix
cement prices.
   Lower courts had relied on a 1977 Supreme Court decision in
which the justices said federal antitrust law does not permit
``indirect purchasers'' to sue.
   But writing for the court today, Justice Byron R. White said the
1977 ruling was never intended to preclude state laws allowing such
lawsuits.
   ``It is one thing to consider the congressional policies
identified in (the 1977 decision) in defining what sort of recovery
federal antitrust law authorizes,'' White said. ``It is something
altogether different, and in our view inappropriate, to consider
them as defining what federal law allows states to do under their
own antitrust law.''
   Under the 1977 ruling, if a manufacturer illegally conspires to
fix a product's price and sells it to a retailer, the retailer may
sue for triple damages. But if the retailer passes on the illegally
inflated price when selling the product to the ultimate consumer,
the consumer may not use federal antitrust law to sue.
   Today's decision, however, allows such consumers to sue under a
state antitrust law.
   Justice Department lawyers, who sided with the appeal filed by
the four states in the cement price-fixing case, told the court
that at least 11 other states and the District of Columbia have
enacted laws expressly giving indirect purchasers the right to sue.
   The states are Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland,
Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico, Rhode Island, South Dakota and
Wisconsin.
   In the case decided today, the four states sought to sue in
behalf of county and municipal governments that had purchased
cement or products containing cement.
   A spate of lawsuits was filed against cement manufacturers in
1976 and 1977, alleging a nationwide conspiracy to fix prices. Each
of the four states involved in today's court action filed a suit,
based in part on state laws protecting indirect purchasers.
   The litigation was consolidated in federal court in Arizona, and
by 1981 cement manufacturers had agreed to pay $32 million to
settle the case.
   Direct purchasers then challenged the states' right to be
compensated for indirect purchases.
   A federal trial judge, later upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, threw out the states' suits. Today's decision
reinstated them, saying the lower courts wrongly concluded that the
state laws unduly interfere with federal law.
   White said allowing enforcement of state antitrust laws
protecting indirect purchasers does not impair the effectiveness of
federal antitrust law.
   Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor did not
participate in the case, for unannounced reasons.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Expanded airlines' protection against big damages, limiting
the financial penalties that may be imposed against Korean Air
Lines for a 1983 disaster in which 269 people died when a KAL
passenger jet was shot down over Soviet airspace.
   By a 9-0 vote, the justices said the airline will not have to
pay more than $75,000 in damages for each person who died in the
disaster.
   _ Backed out of deciding the validity of a 1987 attempt by
Congress to limit the president's authority to withhold classified
information from it.
   In an unsigned opinion, the justices sent the case back to a
federal trial judge for further study.
   _ Ruled unanimously that states may prosecute employers for
withholding accrued vacation pay owed fired workers.
   The court, in a case from Massachusetts, said the federal
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) does not pre-empt
criminal prosecution in such cases.
   The antitrust case is California vs. ARC America Corp., 87-1862.

   The Supreme Court today backed out of deciding
the validity of a 1987 attempt by Congress to limit the president's
authority to withhold classified information from it.
   In an unsigned opinion, the justices sent the case back to a
federal trial judge for further study.
   The high court cited several changed circumstances, including
the possibility that the dispute may have become moot.
   At issue was a national security directive adopted by President
Ronald Reagan in 1983 requiring federal officials, before they are
allowed access to classified documents, to sign an agreement that
they will never disclose the information.
   The directive also established a standard form for officials to
sign, promising they never will divulge classified or
``classifiable'' information without written permission from proper
executive-branch authorities.
   Federal employee unions and some members of Congress bridled at
the directive, particularly the use of the word ``classifiable.''
   They said the presidential order restricted free-speech rights
of federal employees and ``allows after-the-fact classification of
information in order to punish whistleblowers for making
disclosures that embarrass their superiors.''
   Members of Congress said the directive would bar those federal
employees who sign from revealing information to Congress that it
is entitled to receive.
   Congress then enacted a spending bill aimed at blocking the
executive branch from withholding classifiable information or from
impeding congressional access to such material.
   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch struck down the legislation
last year as unconstitutional.
   The American Foreign Service Association, representing members
of the nation's diplomatic corps, joined with senators and House
members from both political parties in appealing directly to the
Supreme Court.
   But the cout today sent the case back to Gasch, noting that the
term ``classifiable'' has been given a new, narrower interpretation
by executive-branch officials.
   The case is American Foreign Service Association vs. Garfinkel,
87-2127.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and
Communist Party chief Wojciech Jaruzelski met today for the first
time in more than seven years, a day after the trade union was
legalized.
   ``I feel satisfaction. We have come a very difficult and long
way,'' Gen. Jaruzelski told reporters after the meeting.
   He said that ``reconciliation is a process, not an act,'' and
cited the broad agreement on political and economic reform reached
between communist authorities and the opposition.
   ``Today we only put another seal, in a way, on that accord,'' he
said.
   Walesa left the meeting without talking to reporters.
   Walesa and Jaruzelski began the meeting with a handshake inside
a reception room of the parliament building near downtown Warsaw,
said an official photographer who was present at the meeting. He
requested anonymity.
   The two men then sat on a sofa and had a long conversation
during the first part of the one-hour reception, reported
Solidarity activist Zbigniew Bujak, who was among the approximately
30 people present.
   The deliberately low-profile meeting was requested by the
government, according to an opposition source who demanded
anonymity.
   Jaruzelski issued the martial law decree of Dec. 13, 1981, that
resulted in the imprisonment of Walesa and thousands of other
Solidarity activists and the outlawing of the East bloc's first
independent trade union.
   But now Jaruzelski has led his reluctant party to reinstate
Solidarity, which he hopes will help pull Poland out of its
economic crisis.
   ``A new chapter is starting in the history of Poland, and it
seems that both of the politicians are characterized with a great
sense of timing and a capacity to respond to the challenges of the
time,'' said deputy government spokesman Zbyslaw Rykowski.
   Walesa and Jaruzelski last met Nov. 4, 1981, about a month
before Jaruzelski imposed martial law and had Walesa jailed.
   Walesa attended today's meeting as a member of the Arbitration
Commission, which was appointed to oversee implementation of the
economic and political accords between the Solidarity-led
opposition and the government.
   The commission included 13 opposition delegates, many of whom
also had been jailed at Jaruzelski's order. In addition to
Jaruzelski and Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, the leaders
of Poland's two communist-allied political parties also were
present at the meeting.
   Solidarity was officially legalized Monday by three-judge panel
in a Warsaw provincial court, in the same room where the union had
its original charter approved in November 1980.
   Solidarity was suppressed after 16 months with the imposition of
martial law. The union movement was outlawed the following year.
   Party and government officials admit that by legalizing
Solidarity they hope to encourage the West to provide economic help
to Poland, which is burdened by a $39 billion foreign debt.
   In the April 5 accords, the government also agreed to create the
first freely elected legislative chamber _ a Senate that would have
veto power over the existing unicameral parliament, the Sejm.
   On Monday, Walesa had breakfast with Foreign Minister Roland
Dumas of France and said Poland must focus on solving its economic
crisis now that his union is legal.
   ``We have achieved half a victory for the moment. Now it's a
question of seeing if we can take advantage of all the
possiblities,'' Walesa told Dumas.
   Walesa praised President Bush on Monday for announcing an aid
package for Poland's economy. ``Bush is a great man and he knows
the Polish situation very well,'' he said.
   Walesa on Monday also attended a meeting of an opposition
committee supervising selection of independent candidates for the
June parliamentary elections, which will be the first in Poland
open to the opposition since 1947.
   The 1947 voting, which allowed communists to take unchallenged
power, was criticized in the West as tainted. This year's voting is
planned to remove the party's full monopoly on power, but still
leaves it in a dominant position.
   Solidarity members, who predict the union will grow to 5 million
to 7 million members, immediately face the twin tasks of organizing
the union and the election campaign.

<HEAD>Court Rules Employers May Be Prosecuted for Withholding Vacation
Pay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States may prosecute employers for withholding
accrued vacation pay owed fired workers, the Supreme Court ruled
unanimously today in a case from Massachusetts.
   The court said the federal Employee Retirement Income Security
Act (ERISA) does not pre-empt criminal prosecution in such cases.
   ERISA covers employee welfare benefit plans, but accrued
vacation pay is more akin to a worker's salary, the court said.
   ``Except for the fact that the (vacation) payment has been
deferred, such payments are as much a part of the employees'
regular basic compensation as overtime pay or the payment of salary
while the employee is absent on vacation,'' said Justice John Paul
Stevens for the court.
   The ruling leaves Massachusetts officials free to prosecute
Richard Morash, president of the Yankee Bank for Finance and
Savings.
   The Yankee Companies Inc. in May 1984 acquired the financially
troubled Home Savings Bank.
   A year later two vice presidents, Christopher Winslow and
William Tuttle, were fired. Winslow said the bank owed him $14,520
for 66 unused vacation days and Tuttle said he was owed $11,146 for
42 unused vacation days.
   State prosecutors filed criminal charges against Morash after he
refused to pay the money _ except for the vacation days the vice
presidents were owed for the few months they worked in 1985 before
their firings.
   Morash was accused of violating a state law that applies
specifically to employers accused of not paying wages to workers,
including vacation benefits.
   The Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled the law was pre-empted by
ERISA because the vacation pay was part of the bank's employee
benefit plan. States are barred by ERISA from using criminal laws
to enforce such plans, the state court said.
   Law enforcement officials from 12 states joined Massachusetts in
urging the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the state court ruling.
   The states are Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota,
New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Vermont,
Wisconsin and Wyoming.
   The states said federal law and enforcement mechanisms are
inadequate to protect workers wrongfully denied vacation pay.
   Stevens said today that criminal prosecution is permitted in the
case of vacation payments owed by a single employer. The situation
would be different if a separate fund was created by a group of
employers to guarantee vacation benefits to laborers who regularly
shift jobs from one employer to another, he said.
   The case is Massachusetts vs. Morash, 88-32.

<HEAD>Collapsed Bridge Was Listed In Poor Condition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OLIVER SPRINGS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Urgent repairs were recommended
twice since 1985 but never carried out on a bridge that collapsed
over the weekend, killing a teen-ager and injuring two others,
inspection records show.
   The bridge was listed in ``critical'' condition after
inspections in 1985 and 1987, meaning it ``should be closed until
the indicated repair is completed.''
   State inspectors had found rotting guardrails and soil erosion,
and the records show that no repairs were made. The inspectors also
noted that a fire apparently had been set on some of the bridge's
wood a few years ago.
   The three victims from the Saturday night accident were riding
in a pickup truck that plunged 30 feet onto railroad tracks below.
   Local officials said the truck may have driven off the span,
knocked out a support on the way down and caused the bridge to
collapse.
   The state had no authority to enforce repairs on the span
because until last year it was owned by CSX Transportation, said
Gwen Hopkins, spokeswoman for the state Transportation Department.
CSX sold the bridge to Anderson County last year, said Lloyd Lewis,
a company spokesman in Jacksonville, Fla.
   Asked why the railroad had not addressed the problems cited in
the inspections, Lewis responded: ``Whatever did not happen three
years ago doesn't matter. We're not responsible anymore.''
   The county applied earlier for money to replace the structure,
said county attorney David Stuart. ``There was no doubt that it was
time to be replaced,'' he said.
   Glen Smith, 44, said his brother died in 1981 when his car hit
the bridge rail and went over the side. The accident led to a
petition drive to build a new bridge, he said.
   Saturday's accident was the second involving a Tennessee bridge
failure in two weeks. Inspection reports on both structures warned
earlier of problems.
   Eight people died April 1 in the collapse of a bridge over the
Hatchie River 45 miles north of Memphis. Investigators said flood
waters had weakened the supports of that bridge.

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright today took his
defense against ethics charges to the most important jury of all _
the 260 House Democrats who re-elected him speaker just four months
ago, and who will have the final say over whether he keeps that
post.
   ``I told them I intend to fight, and I intend to win,'' Wright,
D-Texas, told reporters after addressing a closed-door session of
the Democratic Caucus in the House chamber. He received a standing
ovation at the end of the 30-minute speech.
   As lawmakers left, they described Wright's defense as detailed
and specific, but they appeared agonized over the decision that
faces them in the coming weeks.
   ``The easy thing for Democrats to do is to throw Jim Wright over
the side and instantly install (House Majority Leader) Tom Foley
behind the wheel,'' said Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont. ``It may be
that the toughest political vote of our lives will be the one to
save him.''
   Democratic Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., predicted Wright will be
able to knock down many of the 69 charges against him and will
remain speaker. ``The main thing is for the American people to
understand that these are mere accusations,'' he said.
   Filing of the charges on Monday made Wright the first speaker in
U.S. history to be formally charged with ethical wrongdoing by the
House, although some of his predecessors have been tainted by
scandals.
   The voluminous report of the ethics committee included new
details about how he sold thousands of copies of his book,
``Reflections of a Public Man,'' to special-interest groups.
Several colleagues called those deals the most troubling of the
charges against the Texas Democrat.
   In one case, a March 1986 speech to the Fertilizer Institute,
the trade group planned to give Wright a plaque or a small gift in
return for his appearance. But Wright's office arranged instead for
the group to buy $2,023 worth of books, yielding the congressman
$1,112 in royalty income.
   House members are limited by the rules to accepting no more than
30 percent of their salaries in outside speaking fees. The House
ethics panel found reason to believe that Wright circumvented that
limit by converting speech honoraria into book royalties, which are
exempt from the limits.
   In two other cases _ a speech to the Ocean Spray cranberry
organization in the fall of 1985, and a speech in March 1986 to the
Mid-Continent Oil &amp; Gas Association _ Wright sold books instead of
collecting speaking fees, and was given the books to distribute as
he saw fit. The ethics committee saw those as unreported gifts to
the speaker.
   ``My view is that count one (dealing with the book sales) is the
most serious issue,'' said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., vice chairman
of the House Democratic Caucus, the organization of all 261 House
Democrats.
   ``It's a bad day. It looks rotten. But at some point in time,
the facts do make a difference'' and will help the speaker, he said.
   The speaker's problems were the No. 1 topic of conversation on
the House floor, but lawmakers were reacting cautiously in public
to Monday's formal filing of charges against Wright, the equivalent
of an indictment.
   ``I think we have a responsibility to keep our minds open and
our mouths shut until we have an opportunity to read the report,''
said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., who wrote many of the rules Wright is
charged with violating.
   ``We learned that the charges are not trivial, they are not
technical, and they are not aimed at his wife,'' as Wright had
argued last week, said Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., a close ally of
Georgia Republican Rep. Newt Gingrich, whose complaint last May
launched the Wright investigation.
   Republicans were going out of their way not to lambaste Wright,
fearing that to do so would only make it easier for the speaker to
rally Democrats against what he has portrayed as a partisan
vendetta. Instead, Republicans simply pointed to the ethics panel's
unanimous bipartisan vote to issue the formal statement of charges
against Wright.
   Democrats pinned their hopes on rebutting what they saw as the
weakest part of the ethics committee's case, the charge that Wright
improperly accepted some $145,000 in gifts from Fort Worth
developer George Mallick because Mallick had a direct interest in
legislation before Congress.
   The rules bar acceptance of more than $100 in any calendar year
from a person deemed to have a direct interest in congressional
action.
   The panel, in its report, said Mallick's large oil and gas and
real estate investments set him apart from the general public and
made it ``reasonable to infer'' that he would be interested in
lawmaking on taxes and real estate development. In addition, he had
dealings with savings and loan institutions and with a Fort Worth
redevelopment project that were affected by bills before Congress,
the committee said.
   Less easy to dismiss were the counts relating to the book sales.
   ``The most damaging thing in the report _ and that doesn't mean
it's convictable _ is the book business,'' said Rep. Charles
Wilson, D-Texas, a Wright defender.
   Other Democrats were pointing to the counts against Wright that
had been dismissed, charges that involved misuse of his public
office and public funds, and were minimizing the ones that remain.
   Observed one Wright defender, Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas: ``You
would have thought that he had shot four nuns in the church.''
   The panel said it was still investigating the unusually high
purchase offer made by a company for Mallightco's interest in an
oil and gas well as Wright's blind trust was selling its interest
in the company he co-owned with Mallick. Wright's interest was sold
June 9, at the same time the ethics investigation was opened, and
the high offer raised the value of the shares.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Tuesday by the Supreme Court.
   
   ANTITRUST
   
   The court, in a major victory for consumers, upheld state laws
that allow those indirectly affected by illegal price-fixing to sue
for monetary damages.
   By a 7-0 vote,the court reinstated efforts by four states _
California, Minnesota, Alabama and Arizona _ to participate in a
multimillion-dollar settlement of a nationwide conspiracy to fix
cement prices.
   The case is California vs. ARC America Corp., 87-1862.
   
   KAL CRASH
   
   The court expanded airlines' protection against big damages,
limiting the financial penalties that may be imposed against Korean
Air Lines for a 1983 disaster in which 269 people died when a KAL
passenger jet was shot down over Soviet airspace.
   By a 9-0 vote, the justices said the airline will not have to
pay more than $75,000 in damages for each person who died in the
disaster.
   The case is Chan vs. Korean Air Lines, 87-1055.
   
   CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
   
   The court backed out of deciding the validity of a 1987 attempt
by Congress to limit the president's authority to withhold
classified information from it.
   In an unsigned opinion, the justices sent the case back to a
federal trial judge for further study.
   At issue was a national security directive adopted by President
Ronald Reagan in 1983 requiring federal officials, before they are
allowed access to classified documents, to sign an agreement they
will never disclose the information.
   The case is American Foreign Service Association vs. Garfinkel,
87-2127.
   
   VACATION PAY
   
   The court ruled unanimously that states may prosecute employers
for withholding accrued vacation pay owed fired workers.
   The court, in a case from Massachusetts, said the federal
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) does not pre-empt
criminal prosecution in such cases.
   The case is Massachusetts vs. Morash, 88-32.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time magazine says it will vigorously fight a
libel suit filed by Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou over an
article reporting an accusation he stole millions of dollars from a
bank.
   The lawsuit was filed in London and announced here Monday by
Papandreou attorney Leonard Boudin, who said the premier is seeking
as-yet unspecified damages.
   The lawsuit cites the cover story in Time's international
edition March 13. A similar article in the U.S. edition was not on
the cover.
   The articles quoted former Greek bank president George Koskotas,
who is jailed in Massachusetts, as saying he passed millions from
the Bank of Crete to Papandreou and other figures in the premier's
Socialist government.
   Papandreou, premier since 1981, has denied the accusation.
   Boudin said that in using Koskotas, Time was relying on ``a man
whose character and reputation for truth is questioned by Time
itself in the article.''
   Time said that it tried repeatedly to get Papandreou's response
and that it noted in the article earlier denials made by the prime
minister.
   ``Time magazine will take whatever steps are necessary to fight
the allegations of this lawsuit and defend its right to report
news,'' the magazine said in a statement.
   Boudin said the lawsuit was filed in England because the story
was more damaging abroad and because it is easier for a public
figure to make a case under English libel law than under American.
   Since last fall, allegations of financial wrongdoing at the Bank
of Crete have rocked the Papandreou government, which is up for
re-election in June.
   The scandal and the 70-year premier's open affair with a
34-year-old former airline stewardess have hurt him with voters.

   Ten convicted drug smugglers were hanged
Tuesday, Tehran radio reported.
   The report, monitored in Nicosia, said the men smuggled and
distributed more than 2,680 pounds of opium, 275 pounds of hashish
and 30 pounds of heroin.
   Some also were convicted of kidnapping, illegal possession of
weapons and resisting arrest, the radio said.
   Iranian authorities launched a nationwide anti-narcotics
campaign in January and have arrested more than 2,000 people
allegedly involved in trafficking and drug abuse.
   The campaign, which has triggered gunbattles with smuggling
gangs, has centered on regions along the eastern borders with
Afghanistan and Pakistan.
   The hangings raised the number of drug-related executions to 398
since Jan. 21, when a new law took effect mandating the death
sentence for anyone caught in possession of even small quantities
of narcotics.
   Officials have said about 1 million Iranians are believed
involved in drug abuse, but unofficial estimates put the number at
double that.

   Volkswagen of America Inc. has agreed to pay
$670,000 and the United Auto Workers $48,000 so settle claims that
they discriminated against black employees, a spokesman for the
automaker said today.
   About 800 blacks could share the money under the settlement,
which is subject to approval by U.S. District Judge Gustave
Diamond, who is presiding over the 6-year-old case. He scheduled a
June 13 hearing on the settlement.
   ``This is not an admission of guilt on VW's part or the UAW's
part,'' said VW spokesman Tom McDonald in Troy, Mich.
   He said the defendants settled to avoid the costs of further
litigation and to ``make sure that the reputation of Volkswagen
remains as high as it was when we were making cars in Westmoreland
County.'' Volkswagen closed its lone U.S. assembly plant last year,
citing declining sales of its Golf and Jetta models.
   Individual payments would range from $70,000 to a supervisor who
said he was harassed on the job to $200 for hourly workers who were
fired before their 90-day probations expired.
   Any money not claimed by individuals will be used to establish a
scholarship fund for minority students.
   The plaintiffs had sought $70 million when they filed the
class-action suit in 1983.

<HEAD>Controversial Drug Testing Plan Prompts Discussion Of Drugs In Schools</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WOODSTOCK, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A muddy field beside a hillside in rural
Vermont seems an unlikely place to debate drug testing for high
school athletes.
   But the 28 members of the Woodstock Union High School lacrosse
team running their drills there at have come under more scrutiny
than they've ever faced before because of a drug testing program
proposed by coach Charles Gibbs Jr.
   It's the first of its kind in Vermont and has prompted debate
throughout the state.
   ``It's just one little coach's attempt in one little area to
help kids say no,'' Gibbs said.
   The program is completely voluntary and his players think fewer
than half of the squad will sign up. The program probably won't
begin for at least another week.
   ``I think it will work, but I don't have to prove to anyone I
don't do drugs,'' said player Eli Kent, who's decided not to
participate.
   Everyone who volunteers, Gibbs included, will put their names in
a hat. Two names will be chosen every Monday and those players will
submit to urinalysis.
   A player will be suspended for two weeks if the test comes back
positive. A subsequent offense will result in a one-year suspension.
   Gibbs believes the plan will help students resist peer pressure
to try alcohol and drugs.
   But not everyone looks at it that way.
   ``To me it smacks of `1984,' even though it's five years late,''
said school board member Robert O'Donnell, referring to the George
Orwell novel in which government looks over people's shoulders to
maintain a strictly controlled society.
   O'Donnell, the only member of the school board to vote against
the plan, said he believes it encourages students to try to beat
the system rather than helping them make decisions for the future.
   ``We need to empower them to make the right decision, not to set
up a penal measure,'' he said.
   O'Donnell said athletes already are asked to sign a statement
saying they won't use drugs or alcohol. He also said the school has
a counseling program to help teen-agers deal with drug abuse.
   What's more, students and school officials don't feel drug
problems in Woodstock are any worse and, in fact, may be less
severe than in many other towns.
   ``From what I've seen, there aren't any really heavy drugs at
all,'' said Donald Caffrey, a junior and member of the lacrosse
team. He does not plan to participate in the testing program.
   It's not the first time such a program has been suggested. A
school board plan in Lafayette, Ind., to randomly test high school
athletes and cheerleaders for drug use was upheld by a federal
appeals court and could be implemented this fall. The American
Civil Liberties Union is considering appealing the case to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   Gibbs defended the legality of his plan in a written proposal to
the school board.
   ``First, it is voluntary and only voluntary. Second, there is no
criminal penalty which attaches to testing positive,'' he said,
adding that he didn't think it was much different from a curfew for
team members.
   The Vermont chapter of the ACLU does not plan to challenge the
program because no one has filed a complaint. But executive
director Leslie Williams isn't keen on the idea.
   ``It seems to me that the intentions are good here,'' she said.
``But they're not thinking through. They say that it's a voluntary
program, but we all know what it's like in high school. Its going
to be pretty hard to say no'' to the program.
   Williams said the tests amounted to a bodily search without
probable cause.
   Gibbs believes the proposal has prompted the community to assess
its social situation and examine the example it is setting for its
youth. But he stressed that the plan is an experiment.
   ``I think it's worth it for this season to try it _ to see if it
does any good,'' Gibbs said. ``(But) if I find it's dividing my
team between those who sign up and those who don't, it's gone.''

<HEAD>New Lloyd Webber Musical Opening to Mixed Reviews</HEAD>

   Andrew Lloyd Webber's new musical ``Aspects of
Love'' received mixed reviews today following weeks of speculation
in the British press that the Tony Award-winning composer was
losing his Midas touch.
   The show is his first musical since the Broadway smash hit ``The
Phantom of the Opera,'' which swept the Tony Awards last season.
The new show, made up of songs without spoken dialogue, signals a
newfound emphasis on emotion over spectacle from the man who
brought felines and trains to melodic life in ``Cats'' and
``Starlight Express.''
   Charles Osborne in The Daily Telegraph said the show, which
opened Monday at the Prince of Wales Theater, was ``certainly
Andrew Lloyd Webber's best so far.''
   However, Milton Shulman in The Standard found the show ``a
mannered, rather precious operetta ... singularly lacking in real
passion.''
   At a cost of $3.4 million, the production sold advance tickets
worth $8.5 million. It is sold out through 1989.
   The musical, set in France and based on a 1955 novel by David
Garnett, relates the tangled romantic intrigue among three
generations of a family and their entourage. Their ``aspects of
love'' include romance between cousins and lesbianism.
   The black-tie opening came five days after the show's originally
scheduled debut.
   The premiere was delayed by problems with scenery and length. In
addition, James Bond actor Roger Moore, who was to play aging
dilettante George Dillingham, left the show during rehearsals.
Moore said he felt he was not up to singing the part.
   The show marks director Trevor Nunn's first musical since his
production of ``Chess'' bombed on Broadway last year.
   Jack Tinker in The Daily Mail applauded Lloyd Webber's daring.
``This is uncharted territory on so many fronts,'' he wrote. But he
added that he wondered ``whether the public are prepared for such a
show of courage or not.''
   Michael Billington in The Guardian praised the show for
exploring ``the human heart rather than the possibilities of
high-tech scenery.'' But he called it ``a beguiling, fitfully
pleasing musical, rather than a perfect one.''
   Irving Wardle in The Times called it ``a well-crafted show,''
but he faulted the music as ``timid and uninteresting.''
   The cast includes Kevin Colson, who inherited Moore's role, as
the wealthy painter, George, and Michael Ball as his nephew, Alex.
Both men are romantically linked to a French actress, Rose,
performed by American Ann Crumb.
   Kathleen Rowe McAllen, another American, plays George's Italian
mistress, Giulietta. Diana Morrison is George's young daughter,
Jenny, who becomes ensnared by the dangerous liaisons around her.
   The show's most heavily plugged song, ``Love Changes
Everything,'' has received extensive airplay on British radio. It
is sung by Ball, who is being hyped as the London theater's new
teen hearthrob.
   ``Aspects of Love'' helps resuscitate a genre, the English
musical, which received a double blow last year with the
back-to-back Broadway failures of ``Chess'' and ``Carrie.''

<HEAD>Czechoslovak Leader Says No Rehabilitation of Dubcek</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Poland, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The leader of Czechoslovakia's Communist Party
said Tuesday there will be no rehabiliation of Alexander Dubcek,
who led the 1968 ``Prague Spring'' liberalization campaign that was
crushed by Soviet tanks.
   ``We don't intend any political rehabiliation or return of
Alexander Dubcek to political activity,'' Czechoslovak leader Milos
Jakes told reporters. ``No one would accept that except for a few
people.
   The return of Dubcek might be misunderstood and could ``lead to
instability,'' he said.
   Jakes held a news conference after meeting with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev on a working visit to the Soviet Union.
   The Czechoslovak Communist Party lags behind parties in Hungary
and Poland in adopting reforms modeled on Gorbachev's restructuring
campaign, but Jakes said it was reforming at its own pace.
   ``Czechoslovakia is not a conservative force on the map of the
world,'' he said.
   ``We have similar tasks to the Soviet Communist Party. Certainly
we take into account our internal conditions in Czechoslovakia when
we determine the rate and scope of change,'' he said. ``We also
take into account the experience of the Soviet Union. This is very
important to us.''
   Parts of Gorbachev's reform effort are similar to changes
initiated by Dubcek in 1968. But the Czechoslovak leadership
installed after Dubcek was ousted in April 1969 has resisted
political change.
   A series of protests demanding political and economic reforms
rocked the Czechoslovak capital of Prague this year. In a
much-publicized trial, dissident playright Vaclav Havel was
convicted of incitement and obstructing police and sentenced to
jail.
   Dubcek was allowed to travel to Italy in November, his first
trip abroad in 18 years, but in March he was denied permission to
attend the congress of the Italian Communist Party.
   The Czechoslovak party newspaper Rude Pravo charged in March
that recent interviews Dubcek has given to Western journalists were
used to give ``a semblance of authenticity'' to ``slanders'' of the
current leadership.
   Jakes said the Czechoslovak party under Dubcek set a correct
course for reforming the country's political and economic
structure, but it got out of control.
   ``The leadership of that time was not able to guide the country
along the right road,'' Jakes said. ``We witnesses the weakening of
socialism and he violation of traditions that had existed since
1948,'' the year communists took power.
   Dubcek today ``is a private citizen and he speaks his own
mind,'' Jakes said.
   Noting that Dubcek's sons have professional careers and that the
former Czechoslovak leader is living on a pension, Jakes added, ``I
don't think he has grounds to complain.''
   Jakes said the party was willing to give more power to smaller
parties that are allied with it, but does not plan to allow the
creating of opposition parties, as Hungarian communists have
pledged.
   Reforms in Czechoslovakia, as well as in the Soviet Union where
a political opposition is not permitted, must be carried out by the
Communist Party, he said. ``If it is not headed by the party the
process will not lead to strengthening of socialism,'' Jakes said.

   Consumer prices jumped 0.5 percent in March,
propelled by higher costs for food, energy and apparel, and helped
produce the largest quarterly increase in two years, the government
reported today.
   Last month's climb in the Labor Department's Consumer Price
Index followed advances of 0.6 percent in January and 0.4 percent
in February.
   Overall, consumer prices in the past three months rose at a
compound annual rate of 6.1 percent.
   It was the largest quarterly increase since the first three
months of 1987, when prices rose 6.3 percent on an annual basis,
and was significantly higher than the annual consumer price rises
of 4.4 percent registered for each of the past two years.
   Price increases have been even steeper at the wholesale level,
where inflation ran at a compound annual rate of 10.2 percent in
the January-March period, the largest quarterly increase in eight
years.
   Daniel T. Van Dyke, senior economist at Bank of America in San
Francisco, said in advance of today's report that while price rises
have moderated some since the start of the year, ``we still have a
problem'' with the pace of inflation.
   ``We're in a period where the inflation rate seems to be hanging
around 5 to 5.5 percent,'' Van Dyke said. ``That is too high for
any long-run kind of equilibrium and I don't think that's what the
Federal Reserve has in mind either.''
   Food costs last month rose twice as much as they did during the
previous month, up 0.8 percent in March after advancing 0.4 percent
in February.
   Energy costs, meanwhile, registered their sharpest increase
since August 1987 last month, advancing 1.1 percent after rising
0.6 percent in February.
   The boost in petroleum-based energy prices, up at a 22.4 percent
annual rate so far this year, accounted for more than two-fifths of
the price acceleration during the first quarter, the Labor
Department said.
   Rising food prices were responsible for nearly one-quarter of
the price increases during the quarter, it said.
   Excluding those two volatile categories, other consumer prices
rose 0.4 percent in March, the same pace as in February.
   The March figures left the overall Consumer Price Index at 122.3
percent of its 1982-84 base, meaning that a hypothetical selection
of goods costing $100 during the base period would have cost
$122.30 in March, 70 cents more than in February.
   The overall index, unlike other figures in the report, is not
adjusted to remove the effect on prices of seasonal fluctuations.
   President Bush told a meeting of construction unions today that
the key to continued economic health for the nation is to bring
down inflation and interest rates by reducing the federal deficit.
   ``We must keep inflation and interest rates down and ... the way
to do that is to bring the budget deficit down,'' he said.
   The Labor Department offered these other details on price
changes in March:
   _The increase in food prices was largely a reflection of a 2.4
percent jump in prices for meats, poultry, fish and eggs.
   _Apparel prices rose 1.4 percent last month after dropping 0.2
percent in February. The increase was blamed on the introduction of
higher-priced spring and summer fashions, particularly for women.
   _Gasoline prices shot up 2.1 percent in March after advancing
1.7 percent during February. Gasoline prices were up 4.8 percent
for the first three months of 1989.
   _Medical care costs rose 0.5 percent in March following
increases of 0.8 percent in both January and February.
   _Entertainment costs were up 0.3 percent last month, with
increased ticket prices for events such as movies, concerts and
sporting events accounting for most of the increase.
   Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New
York, said before today's report that the nation is in for ``a
string of unpleasant inflation numbers for awhile.''
   He said that in addition to higher costs for food and energy,
rising prices for materials and wages are contributing to inflation.
   The latest survey by Blue Chip Economic Indicators in Sedona,
Ariz., which each month polls 50 of the nation's leading
forecasters, found the consensus estimate for inflation this year
had risen to 4.9 percent from earlier expectations it would reach
4.7 percent.
   The economists forecast an easing of inflation later in the
year, reflecting some expectations that a recession will arrive
late in 1989 or early next year that would reduce price pressures,
the survey found.
   The Federal Reserve Board for a year has been pushing up
interest rates and tightening its grip on the money supply in an
effort to restrain economic growth and keep inflation in check.
   But analysts caution that it takes a long time for slower growth
to translate into lower inflation, and some fear that the Fed will
tighten credit so severely that its anti-inflation campaign
unintentionally pushes the country into a recession.
   Steinberg said that while the economy already is showing signs
of cooling as the expansion stretches into a seventh year,
``historically, inflation tends to peak after the economy has prety
much slowed down.''
   ``Usually it's after the start of a recession that inflation
peaks,'' Steinberg said. ``I think it's going to be the same story
this year.''
   Van Dyke, however, said the Fed should be able to avoid a
recession by quickly easing up on credit should the threat of an
economic downturn emerge.
   ``If the Fed thought the economy was entering a recession, I
think it would move extremely rapidly (to ease credit),'' Van Dyke
said. ``I think that would have an impact.''

<HEAD>Records of Consulates Will Be Turned Over to Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Records of Imperial Russian consulates in the
United States and Canada in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
which have been in U.S. custody for 55 years, will be turned over
to the Soviet Union at a ceremony in Moscow Wednesday.
   Don W. Wilson, archivist of the United States, will deliver to
Soviet authorities the first boxes of the original files of the
consulates, the National Archives announced Tuesday.
   The boxes contain such items as passport application forms of
the Tsarist period, dated 1918 and containing a blank for ``social
rank,'' and a letter from Count Ilya Tolstoy inquiring about his
brother, the novelist Leo Tolstoy.
   The remainder of the more than 400 boxes will be returned to the
Soviet Union in the course of the year, the archival agency said.
The papers have all been microfilmed, and the copies will be
available to researchers here.
   The documents, created from about 1862 to 1922, are from files
of Soviet consulates in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Honolulu,
Philadelphia, Portland, Ore., and Seattle, and in Montreal and
Vancouver, British Columbia.
   Until 1933, the records were stored in the Russian Embassy in
Washington. At that time the Russian financial attache, who was
custodian of the records, asked the U.S. government to take
custody. They were moved to a warehouse under the auspices of the
State Department and were occasionally consulted by officials of
the Soviet Embassy, the announcement by the archives said.
   In 1947, they were transferred to the National Archives for
safekeeping.
   ``These records, which document official government activity,
should properly be held for research use in the Soviet Union,''
Wilson said in a statement issued here. ``For years the United
States has supported the efforts of the International Council on
Archives and UNESCO to see that archival materials which have
migrated from their country of origin should be returned to their
proper home.''
   Wilson is in the Soviet Union as head of the U.S.-U.S.S.R.
Commission on Archival Cooperation for negotiations on joint
archival projects including an agreement on cooperation in
genealogical research.
   The announcement said Fedor M. Vaganov, chief of the main
archival administration of the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers and
Soviet head of the commission, would represent the Soviet Union at
the presentation ceremony.
   It said the records related, among other things, to property
claims and activities of Russian nationals in the United States and
Canada, principally from 1900 to 1917. Others deal with
Russian-American trade, Russian church affairs and consular routine.

   Edward M. Brecher, a writer who once
argued in favor of the right to end one's life at a time and in a
manner of one's own choosing, has died in what was ruled a suicide.
He was 77.
   Brecher, who was found dead at home Saturday, wrote ``Opting for
Suicide'' for The New York Times Magazine in 1979 after he had
contracted cancer of the colon the previous year.
   He was the author of numerous books and articles on medical,
scientific and social subjects.
   A son, Jeremy, said Monday that Brecher left one note for family
and friends and another for the police saying he felt the time had
come for him to end his life.
   Dr. Gurd Gudernatch, an assistant state medical examiner, said
today that Brecher died by asphyxiation and his death has been
ruled a suicide.
   For much of his long writing career, Brecher collaborated on
books and articles with his wife, Ruth Ernestine Cook Brecher, who
died in 1966. They received the Albert Lasker Award for medical
journalism in 1963.
   The couple wrote ``An Analysis of Human Sexual Response,'' a
1966 version for the general public of Masters and Johnson's
``Human Sexual Response.''
   Among his later works were ``The Sex Researchers,'' ``Licit and
Illicit Drugs'' and ``Love, Sex and Aging.''
   Brecher was born in Minneapolis and graduated from Swarthmore
College. He received a master's degree from the University of
Minnesota.
   In 1947, he became an associate editor of Consumer Reports and
four years later he joined the U.N. Technical Assistance
Administration as an editor. He worked mainly as a free-lance
writer since 1952.
   Survivors include two other sons and four grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   The latest education slogan from the Bush
administration is ``deregulation.''
   Broached last week before a cheering audience in a Union, N.J.,
high school, President Bush's offer to reduce the red tape long
associated with federal education programs was hailed as a step
that would give school officials flexibility to better serve needy
youngsters.
   But at least a few worried that unless very carefully crafted,
deregulation might mean a return to the bad old days before the
civil rights era when schools had no one looking over their
shoulders to ensure that the poor, the handicapped and other
disadvantaged students got the education they were entitled to.
   ``We want to waive some regulations for poorer communities,
allowing them to pool state and federal funds in exchange for
higher accountability and performance,'' Bush said.
   ``We'll give you the flexibility, you show us the results,'' he
said.
   Bush didn't elaborate, and U.S. Department of Education
officials said they had no further specifics to offer.
   ``We're still working on how to implement what the president
said,'' Charles Kolb, deputy undersecretary of the U.S. Department
of Education, said in an interview Monday.
   But the call for more federal flexibility was generally welcomed
by educators who have long decried the paperwork of programs such
as bilingual education, vocational education, migrant education,
education for the handicapped and ``Chapter 1,'' which provides
remedial programs for low-income pupils.
   Clearing away needless regulations also squares neatly with
current school reform efforts which stress more freedom for
educators in exchange for better classroom results. Deregulation
advocates point out that forcing educators to account for every
federal nickel not only wastes time, but may actually hurt children.
   Federal accounting rules make it difficult to serve certain
children in regular classrooms. Youngsters getting remedial help
under Chapter 1, for example, often find themselves separated from
their peers for part of the school day because that's the only way
to fulfill the requirement that such children are the sole
recipients of the federal aid.
   But school officials increasingly criticize such ``pullout''
programs because they tend to segregate, stigmatize and label
children with special needs.
   ``These kids are not pulled out for any pedogogical purposes,
but only for accounting purposes,'' said Gordon Ambach, former New
York state school superintendent who heads the Washington-based
Council of Chief State School Officers.
   ``I, as a former chief and representing chiefs across the
country, would be pleased to see some deregulation efforts,'' he
said.
   ``As a general proposal, we like that,'' agreed Albert Shanker,
president of the American Federation of Teachers. ``Some of the
regulations have been too restrictive. It's meant having to pull
kids out of classrooms to get special programs.''
   But others, notably Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the
National Education Association, believe the cheerleaders of
deregulation may need to be reminded why Congress put that red tape
in education programs in the first place.
   Many of the biggest federal education programs were conceived
during the 1960s Civil Rights era. Before that time, some funds
intended for poor or handicapped students disappeared into the
general operating funds of school districts, never reaching the
students they were intended for.
   ``I think we would have to look very carefuly at any effort to
remove regulations,'' Futrell said. ``A lot of people forget that
the money used to be spent on equipment, not for the students in
those programs. The regulations are there to make sure there are
certain levels of quality.''
   Such concerns indicate that while many educators may greet
deregulation warmly in principle, it could be tough to implement in
practice.
   The many groups representing migrants, disabled and
disadvantaged youngsters will certainly press Bush and Congress for
assurances that deregulation won't mean that schools will no longer
be held accountable for reaching the intended targets of federal
programs.

<HEAD>Experiment Runs Longer, With Greater Energy, Efficiency, Pons Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WHITE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A University of Utah scientist who claimed
to have achieved nuclear fusion in a jar of water says further
experiments have yielded even more energy and run more efficiently.
   Chemistry professor Stanley Pons also said at a news conference
Monday that the claims he made last month with British colleague
Martin Fleischmann had been partly verified by more than 60
university and private laboratories.
   Fleischmann, of the University of Southampton, said in a Radio
Netherlands interview that he had not wanted to announce the
process until next year, but because of the importance of the work,
the scientists had to ``publish and be damned.''
   The two drew skepticism from experts when they announced March
23 that an experiment using common lab equipment at room
temperature had been run for more than 100 hours and had achieved
nuclear fusion, producing four times as much energy as it used.
   Pons said Monday that a controlled fusion reaction has been
sustained more than 800 hours in a small flask containing heavy
water and a palladium electrode. He said recent tests produced
roughly eight times the energy consumed.
   Pons said researchers measured the production of 20 to 30 watts
of electricity from the experiment, or about 67 watts per cubic
centimeter of electrode. That compares with 26 watts per cubic
centimeter in the earlier experiments.
   Of the more than 60 other experimenters, Pons said none has
reported observing both the production of neutrons and the high
level of heat that he and Fleischmann produced.
   Neutrons are a tell-tale sign of fusion, the process powering
the sun, in which tremendous amounts of energy are released when
the cores of two hydrogen atoms fuse.
   Scientists say that if fusion can be created as easily as Pons
and Fleischmann claim, it could be a relatively inexpensive and
virtually inexhaustible energy source.
   Pons said most of the other researchers have chosen not to make
their findings public, and he would not identify them. ``They said
they either are going to publish or are holding off for legal
reasons,'' Pons said.
   Pons said the next major step in his research will be to
generate sufficient energy to perform some observable task.
   Fleischmann, in the radio interview, said he did not expect
quick verification of the work done in Utah.
   ``I don't think a significant series of experiments can be done
in under three to six months after people have started
experiments,'' he said.

   An award-winning newspaper columnist died Tuesday
after being beaten by two youths he had approached to complain
about noise from their idling engines, police said.
   Masahiro Yoshino of the national newspaper Mainichi Shimbun, who
won a Japan Press Club award in 1987 for his column ``Pieces from
Recent Events'' and an award of the Japan Newspaper Editors and
Publishers Association in 1964 for his coverage of organized
violence by gangsters.
   Yoshino, 56, died at a hospital five hours after he was punched
and kicked by the young men, who fled in a car, said a police
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said Yoshino was beaten Monday night in front of a small
railway station in Fujisawa, 30 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   Yoshino, who apparently had been drinking at dinner, was
returning home with his wife and 42-year-old nephew when he picked
up a steel pipe from the road and approached the youths stopped in
four cars and a motorcycle, the official said.
   The motorcycle rider was noisily racing his engine, the official
said.
   He said Yoshino told the youths, ``I don't like hot rodders. I
will teach you to behave yourselves.''
   Two young men emerged from one car, took the steel pipe from
Yoshino, punched him to the ground and kicked him repeatedy in the
head, the official added. The nephew also was injured, he said.

<HEAD>Arthritis Theorist Dies After Long Illness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thomas McPherson Brown, author of a
controversial theory on the treatment and cause of rheumatoid
arthritis, has died following a long illness, officials at an
Arlington, Va., hospital said Tuesday.
   Brown, 82, was on the faculty of the George Washington
University School of Medicine in Washington for 22 years before he
founded the Arthritis Institute at the National Hospital in
Arlington in 1970.
   Officials at the hospital said Brown died on Monday.
   Brown was best known for his promotion of antibiotic treatment
of rheumatoid arthritis, a disease that he believed is caused by a
type of bacteria. He said in a recently published book, ``The Road

thousands of arthritis sufferers.
   However, spokeswoman Connie Raab at the National Institute of
Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease, one of the National
Institutes of Health, said, ``Most experts by far agree that it
hasn't been proven that antibiotics are an effective treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis. It would be great if it worked, but it just
hasn't been proven.''

<HEAD>`Gulag Archipelago' to be Published in Hungary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Hungarian publishing company has
announced plans to release ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' Alexander
Solzhenitsyn's monumental history of Soviet labor camps, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
   The newspaper Esti Hirlap said the publishers, Szabad Ter, would
publish the book soon, but did not say when.
   A French publishing firm that is in charge of printing the
exiled Russian writer's works in Paris has given the Budapest
publishers a three-month option to decide whether they show an
interest in the book, Esti Hirlap said.
   ``The Gulag Archipelago'' posed a fundamental challenge to
Soviet authority. In it, Solzhenitsyn argued that Stalin's terror
was no aberration, but was rooted in Lenin's concept of total rule
by the Communist Party. In January 1974, the book was denounced as
``slanderous'' and the author as a ``renegade'' in Pravda, the
party's official newspaper.
   The French firm also signed a contract with Hungarian publishers
on two other books by Solzhenitsyn, ``Cancer Ward'' and ``The First
Circle.'' The books circulated in the Soviet Union as ``samizdat,''
self-published manuscripts that were passed from hand to hand.
   Szabad Ter has recently published two books about Imre Nagy, the
premier during the Hungarian uprising in 1956.

   Police today said they were looking for two
men who left a department store seemingly unconcerned moments after
a pipe bomb hidden in a toothpaste container maimed a 5-year-old
girl.
   The bomb apparently exploded in Erin Bower's hand after she took
the pump-type container from a shelf at a K mart store Monday
night, investigators said today.
   The explosion blew off four fingers and half her left palm and
injured an eye and her abdomen, officials said. Methodist Hospital
spokesman David Richards said her doctor is ``cautiously optimistic
of partial vision in that eye.''
   None of the 50 other people in the store was seriously hurt.
   Charles A. Petersen of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, said the bomb apparently was electrically fired. ``It
was a little more sophisticated than the average pipe bomb. It took
some knowledge to construct it,'' he said.
   Police said they have no suspects and no motive in the bombing
but were searching for two men seen leaving the store when the
explosion occurred.
   Detective Sgt. Mike Kouns said the men did not appear to be
concerned about the bombing, unlike other customers. Investigators
released composite sketches of two men based on descriptions from
store employees, Kouns said.
   Kouns said that police would question K mart employees who have
been fired recently but that there was no immediate reason to
believe a former worker was involved.
   The store received no warning before the explosion, which
occurred about an hour before closing, said Sheriff Joseph G.
McAtee.
   ``The store looks like everybody dropped whatever they were
looking at,'' said Scott Minier, a Sheriff's Department spokesman.
``There's blood on the tile. The trash bag area is a mess. There is
a blood and merchandise scattered all over.''
   Minier said the bomb had a pressure-sensitive release.
   ``It sounded like a pop,'' said a clerk, Judy Kiefer. ``The
first thing I heard was a child screaming. A lot of people were
saying, `Get out of here.'''
   The girl's mother, Maurine Bower, 31, suffered a minor shrapnel
injury to one of her legs and fainted. She was treated at the
hospital.
   Louis M. Profeta, a medical student at Indiana University, was
shopping when the bomb exploded.
   ``I saw the little girl, her clothes were on fire and the mother
was screaming. Both father and mother were covered in blood,''
Profeta said. ``We rendered first aid and got the father and mother
away, then got her stabilized.''
   The father, Kevin Bower, 31, was holding his youngest daughter,
Megan, 1, at the time of the explosion.
   The severed portion of Erin's hand was packed in ice and taken
to the hospital, but officials said it could not be reattached.
   ``She still has her thumb and about half of the palm of her
hand,'' said Barbara McGraw, a hospital spokeswoman.
   Authorities brought in dogs to sniff out more explosives. None
was found.
   Other K mart stores in the Indianapolis area planned to take
precautions as a result of the bombing, Minier said.
   Agents of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are
aiding the investigation.

<HEAD>Aerospace Workers' Union Representative Attacks Proposed Plane Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The proposed FSX fighter plane deal with Japan
will cost America jobs and might damage national security, a
representative of the aerospace workers' union told Congress on
Tuesday.
   ``We know the deal does not serve our members' interests, does
not serve the economic interests of their communities and we are
unconvinced that it serves our national security interest,'' said
William Holayter, legislative director of the International
Assocation of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
   Holayter told the House Banking subcommittee on economic
stabilization that the proposed deal for Japan to build its own
version of the F-16 fighter would jeopardize the jobs of 10,000
union members employed on production lines by General Dynamics in
Fort Worth, Texas.
   The Bush administration is reviewing a memorandum of
understanding signed with Japan in the final months of the Reagan
administration under which General Dynamics, based in St. Louis,
would develop with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries an advanced
version of the F-16, for deployment in the 1990s.
   Critics say the deal is a $7 billion giveaway of U.S. technology
that will help Japan develop its own aircraft manufacturing
capacity, an industry in which the United States retains the lead.
   However, an independent analyst told the subcommittee that the
FSX deal would benefit the United States as much as it would Japan.
   ``I cannot see how the FSX project, with its specialized fighter
engine, will provide Japan with some technology to break through
the commercial jet engine market, technology they do not already
possess in a form more germane to the commercial market,'' said
George Berke, a former fighter pilot who now works as a defense
analyst and consultant in Washington.
   Japan has been assembling and manufacturing components for
advanced U.S. aircraft since the Korean War in the early 1950s,
said Berke, and that has not caused the United States to lose
either jobs or its lead in the field.
   ``More jobs will be lost if we rebuff the Japanese than we can
hope to gain by insisting on an off-the-shelf buy,'' he said.
   William R. Hawkins, an analyst for the U.S. Business and
Industrial Council, and William G. Phillips, president of the
National Council for Industrial Defense, a lobbying group, opposed
the proposed deal.
   Hawkins urged Japan to buy U.S.-made F-15 or F-18 fighters to
replace its own aging fleet of F-1 fighters, and said Tokyo sought
the FSX deal because it ``wants to expand its aerospace industry
and bring its technological capabilities up to the first rank.''
   Phillips, whose group has campaigned against what he called the
erosion of America's industrial base, applauded ``President Bush
for his willingness to carefully review the intricate details of
the deal and his insistence on changes in the basic documents.''

<HEAD>Feds Wanted to Seize Frat House After Cocaine Arrests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DURHAM, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors wanted to seize a
University of New Hampshire fraternity house after two members were
arrested for selling cocaine, but school officials opposed the
action, according to a report published today.
   Kappa Sigma's president and a fraternity brother were charged in
1988 with selling cocaine to undercover police inside the house,
and police favored seizing it under federal drug laws, The Union
Leader of Manchester reported.
   ``Durham police presented the case to the U.S. attorney's
office, and we were eager to adopt the case. We believed it was
meritorious and had decided to do it, provided we got the
cooperation of the university,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney David
Vicinanzo told The Union Leader.
   The newspaper said Vicinanzo refused to discuss a meeting he had
with university officials. He said only, ``We didn't do the
forfeiture.''
   Vicinanzo did not immediately return a phone call this morning.
   Gregg Sanborn, dean of student affairs, told the newspaper,
``Given the specific information relating to this case, we did not
feel (the house) was subject to forfeiture.''
   Federal drug forfeiture laws allow prosecutors to seize homes,
cars, boats and other property used for drug trafficking.
   Both fraternity members pleaded guilty to drug charges. One
served 80 days in jail; the other was sentenced to a year, the
newspaper said.
   Sanborn said both students withdrew from the university and
would be subject to university discipline if they sought
readmission.

<TEXT>
   Readiness of U.S. military forces should take
priority over modernization and force size in this time of tight
Pentagon budgets, U.S. commanders said Tuesday.
   ``Readiness is pre-eminent,'' Gen. Duane H. Cassidy,
commander-in-chief of the U.S. Transportation Command, told the
Senate Armed Services Committee. ``Readiness will affect our people
first. Most important it will make them see that they can't do
their job in a hollow force.''
   Cassidy joined Gen. Colin L. Powell, commander-in-chief of the
Forces Command, and Gen. Thomas C. Richards, deputy
commander-in-chief of the U.S. European Command, in an appearance
before the committee.
   Powell, who was national security adviser in the Reagan
administration, and Richards stressed that readiness must take
priority over modernization of aircraft, tanks, ships and other
systems and the size of U.S. forces.
   ``When the squeeze finally comes and you can't do it all, then I
would vote in an instant for a smaller but ready force,'' Powell
told the committee.
   Richards, who said he spoke for NATO commander Gen. John Galvin,
said ``the readiness of our force must come first. If we have to
take any cuts, then modernization and force structure are both
areas we must go to before we look to readiness of the forces.''
   President Bush and congressional budget negotiators announced
last Friday an agreement to cut $10 billion from the fiscal 1990
defense budget instead of the previously expected $6.3 billion.
   Then-President Reagan had proposed a budget authority of $305.6
billion for fiscal 1990, which opens Oct. 1, but Bush and
congressional officials agreed on authority of $295.6 billion.
   In his testimony, Powell emphasized that the Pentagon needs some
indication of the type of defense the nation envisions.
   The one thing the Defense Department ``needs more than anything
else is a clear sign what the American people and Congress will
support in the future,'' the general said. ``What's killing us is
the lack of stability.''

<TEXT>
   Authorities may block off the house
where Adolf Hitler first lived to avoid protests and possible
attacks on Thursday, the 100th anniversary of the Nazi dictator's
birth, officials said Tuesday.
   ``We cannot take any risks,'' Johan Gruber, a spokesman for the
district prefecture, told the daily newspaper Oberoesterreichische
Nachrichten.
   Salzburger Vorstadt street, where the house is located, may be
closed on Thursday, the anniversary of his birth, a local
government spokesman said on condition of anonymity. He said the
street also might be closed on Wednesday.
   The newspaper said local officials received threats and heard
that neo-Nazis were planning to meet in Braunau on Thursday. About
300 police were expected to be deployed, the paper said.
   Hitler lived in Braunau the first three years of his life. But
the house, which is privately owned and now holds a day nursery,
has been the subject of controversy and the target of neo-Nazi
activities.
   Ten years ago on the April 20th anniversary, uniformed neo-Nazis
created disturbances near the house, something authorities hope to
avoid Thursday, the newspaper quoted officials as saying.
   On April 5, the government placed an anti-Fascist memorial stone
in front of the house. The granite is from the quarry of the
Mauthausen concentration camp, where the Nazis killed tens of
thousands of Jews. The inscription reads: ``For Peace, Freedom and
Democracy. Never Again Fascism. Millions of Dead Warn.''
   Owners of shops on the street said they would take legal action
if the area was blocked off, the newspaper said.

   Riot police arrested 175 workers in
pre-dawn raids at factories held by strikers Tuesday and battled
radical anti-government protesters during nationwide marches. At
least 11 people were reported injured.
   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon issued orders to use troops and
military equipment to keep vital industries like power plants and
defense factories running if they are threatened by strikes.
   The government, which says a growing wave of strikes threatens
stability, ordered a crackdown last week. President Roh Tae-woo
said strikes had cost $2.4 billion in lost production and $600
million in reduced exports this year.
   Riot troopers firing tear gas seized the electronics and
machinery factories Tuesday in Puchon on the western outskirts of
Seoul, police said. They said some workers hurled firebombs and
rocks but reported no serious injuries.
   Government officials say militant labor unions and dissidents
are trying to incite a general strike on May 1, an international
labor holiday. Union leaders deny the charge.
   News reports said about 27,000 students took part in protests
Tuesday at 44 campuses across the country.
   About 10,000 students shouting ``Down with dictatorship!'' and
``Yankee go home!'' mounted peaceful street marches outside two
Seoul campuses on the eve of the anniversary of a 1960 student
uprising. The students demand the ouster of Roh.
   Violent campus riots broke out in the provincial cities of
Chonju, Taejon, Suwon and Pusan when police used tear gas to block
students from marching, according to Yonhap, the South Korean news
agency.
   In Pusan, 11 people were injured in clashes between about 2,000
demonstrators and riot police outside Pusan National Teachers
College, Yonhap said.
   Riot police stormed the Seoul office of a government lawmaker
Tuesday and overpowered eight students who had attacked with
firebombs and occupied it.
   No overall injury or arrest total was available.
   Police also raided offices of labor activists and dissidents in
three cities near Seoul on Tuesday, seizing about 10,000 labor
leaflets. At least 10 activists were arrested on charges of
inciting strikes.
   Labor Minister Chang Yuyng-chul urged workers and management to
settle wage disputes peacefully, but he said the government would
intervene to stop violent strikes or any other illegal activity.
   Two of the country's three automakers, Daewoo and Kia, said
Tuesday they had resumed partial production after strikes closed
them down the day before. But Hyundai, the nation's biggest car
producer, said it had not resumed work because of work stoppages
and a shortage of spare parts.

<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Robert Mugabe announced
Tuesday a market-oriented investment code to attract domestic and
foreign capital to this southern African nation's flagging economy.
   His long-awaited announcement indicates Mugabe is moving away
from the Marxist-Leninist principles he espoused when he led the
white-ruled British colony of Rhodesia to independence as
black-governed Zimbabwe on April 18, 1980.
   It won cheers from 40,000 people celebrating the ninth
independence anniversary at a rally where trumpet fanfares and
military parades inherited from the colonial era competed with
rhythmic traditional dances and tribal drums.
   Mugabe promised to relax state controls of prices and wages and
make it easier for companies to send profits out of the country.
   The lack of an investment code has scared away foreign
speculators as the government juggled vows to nationalize with
assurances that its word should be good enough for investors who
demanded some kind of insurance.
   As a result, the biggest private foreign investments since
independence are a bubblegum factory built by Danes and a
U.S.-funded baked beans cannery.
   Nevertheless, Zimbabwe remains among black Africa's most
prosperous nations.
   Mugabe said real economic growth has occurred, but the pattern
``has been highly unsatisfactory'' and threatened to reduce living
standards.
   ``It is my government's conviction that the country should enter
a new phase of sustained growth and development so that the economy
responds more adequately to the challenges we face and aspirations
of our people,'' he said.
   The government now recognizes the need for a more rational and
market-orientated way to determine prices and incomes, Mugabe said
in a sharp turn away from previous policies that is in line with
reforms being attempted in other African states.
   Economists long have urged Mugabe to introduce economic reforms
to attract foreign capital at a time when 140,000 students leave
schools each year to compete for just 8,000 jobs.
   Mugabe, 65, made major social reforms in the country by
introducing cheap schooling and free health care. But Zimbabwe's
agriculture-oriented economy remains largely in the hands of
100,000 minority whites who favor free enterprise.

<TEXT>
   The congressional Joint Economic Committee,
responding to President Bush's call for a new spirit of
cooperation, put aside nearly a decade of bickering between
Democrats and Republicans and issued a bipartisan report Tuesday on
the state of the U.S. economy.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., the committee chairman, hailed the
consensus report, the first the committee has been able to produce
since 1980, as a breakthrough which would set the stage for
Congress and the administration to tackle such tough economic
issues as the federal budget deficit.
   During the Reagan years, the 20-member committee of senators and
House members became a battleground over Reagan ecowith the panel so badly
split that it was forced to issue two
annual reports eanomic policies
ch year, one authored by Democrats and the other
by Republicans.
   However, Hamilton, who took over as chairman of the panel this
year, pushed hard for a consensus report, saying it was needed both
for ``symbolism and substance'' to show that the two parties were
willing to put aside the past decade of warfare in an effort to
address the country's economic ills.
   ``This report ... provides a realistic, accurate assessment of
the strengths, weaknesses and uncertain's No. 1 economic power, but we
are
not without serious problems.''
   The report said that reducing the huge federal budget deficit
was the most important economic priority facing Congress and the
administration, but it did not provide any suggestions on how the
gap between spending and revenues should be narrowed.
   It also listed the need for improving the country's education
system as a top priority, contending that failing to upgrade
education could saddle America's economy with ``enormous long-term
costs'' in an increasingly competitive global economy.
   America is falling behind the rest of the world in promoting
literacy and job skills even though it already spends more money
per student than any other country in the world, the committee said.
   The panel cited statistics showing that the country has an
overall dropout rate of 25 percent, with rates for blacks hitting
40 percent and for Hispanics exceeding 50 percent. Partly as a
consequence, 13 percent of 17-year-old Americans cannot read, write
or count, the report said.
   Other economic problems cited in the report were the country's
low personal savings rate, the emergence of America as the world's
largest debtor nation, the Third World debt crisis and the
financial difficulties of the nation's savings and loan
associations.
   In each of those areas, as with the federal budget deficit, the
committee did not offer any specific solutions, but Hamilton said
he was convinced that a consensus was beginning to emerge in
Washington on ways to solve the various problems.
   Sens. William Roth, R-Del., and Steven Symms, R-Idaho, praised
Hamilton for taking a more conciliatory approach this year but both
warned against raising taxes as a way of tackling the budget
deficit.
   Even with the joint report, both Democrats and Republicans felt
the need to issue separate accompanying reports. The Democrats used
their report to go into greater detail on various problems facing
the economy while the Republicans touted the successes of the
Reagan tax cuts in stimulating the 6{-year economic recovery, the
longest peacetime expansion in history.
   Four Democratic members of the panel, Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins
of California, and Sens. Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, Lloyd Bentsen
of Texas, and Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, filed individual
statements voicing concern that the committee may have glossed over
serious problems in its effort to reach a consensus.
   Bentsen said that the U.S. trade deficit, which improved
dramatically in 1988, is expected to worsen again this year,
``exacerbating our dependence on foreign capital and causing the
U.S. foreign debt to balloon beyond $600 billion.''
   Sarbanes, a past chairman of the committee, said he feared that
this year's report ``conveys an inappropriate sense of
complacency.''
   ``Over the past decade, we have created unprecedented imbalances
_ in the budget, in international trade, in the accumulation of
both domestic and international debt _ which suggest we are skating
on very thin ice,'' Sarbanes said. ``We do ourselves and our
children a great disservice if we fail to recognize these problems
and take steps to correct them.''

   Israelis cleaned their houses of bread and
other leavened foods Tuesday and made last-minute preparations for
the Passover holiday that commemorates the exodus of the ancient
Israelites from Egypt.
   The Jewish holiday begins Wednesday evening with a traditional
feast known as a Seder.
   The army organized Seder meals on its bases, but budget
constraints forced it to cancel its main Passover feast with
dignitaries, an army spokesman said.
   The 16-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip kept many soldiers on patrol, but they received holiday
care packages, the spokesman said. He said they contain ``all the
needs to make a Kosher Seder, matzo, sweet red wine, gefilte fish,
all kinds of good dishes.''
   Many Israelis headed for resorts to enjoy the holiday,
especially the Red Sea and Sea of Galilee.
   Lior Raviv, a manager at King Solomon Hotel at the Red Sea
resort of Eilat, said he expects 600 people for Passover dinner.
``We started making the matzo balls tonight and will have made
about 2,000 by tomorrow afternoon,'' he said.
   Matzo is the wafer-like, unleavened bread that the ancient
Israelites are said to have eaten during the exodus because they
had no time to leaven yeast for bread. Most Israelis today do not
eat bread or other leavened goods during the holiday.
   Travel agents reported an increase of more than 10 percent in
Israeli travel abroad for the holiday. Yigal Yardeni of Peltours,
Israel's oldest travel agent, said Israelis went away for many
reasons, including to forget the uprising.
   ``Israelis want to escape, not just this intefadeh (uprising) in
the territories, but the feeling of isolation that has accumulated
in Israel over the past 40 years. They need this holiday to clear
their heads,'' he said.
   In Jerusalem's ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim, the
pungent smell of bleach hung in the air Tuesday as families carried
out traditional spring cleaning aimed at removing all bread and
other leavened products from their homes.
   Religious seminary students removed books from synagogues
Tuesday to shake out any bread crumbs that might have lodged in the
pages.
   The country's two chief rabbis symbolically sold all the state's
``hametz,'' forbidden Passover foods, to an Arab lawyer from east
Jerusaelm for about $5,500, the Chief Rabbinate said. The sale is a
traditional legal fiction reversed after the holiday.

   The United States has withdrawn the last two
of its four AWACS radar-surveillance planes from Saudi Arabia in
light of the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, the Pentagon said
Tuesday.
   The withdrawal of two of the huge early-warning planes along
with two tanker aircraft came last weekend, said Lt. Col. Keith
Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman.
   The four planes arrived in the United States at Tinker Air Force
Base, Okla., on Monday, he added. The first of the AWACS planes had
been withdrawn last January, with the second following in March.
   The Saudis have five of the planes in their air force, but the
United States deployed additional ones at the height of fighting in
the Persian Gulf two years ago. The U.S. planes, in cooperation
with the Saudi aircraft, flew continuous surveillance missions over
the gulf while U.S. Navy ships were escorting oil tankers.
   The Iran-Iraq cease-fire began last August and while little
progress has been made on a peace treaty, both sides continue to
respect the truce. As a result, the United States also has begun
withdrawing some of its naval force in the region.

<HEAD>Senators Say Bigger SEC Budget Needed to Prevent Financial Scandals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Banking Committee leaders on Tuesday
promised to support a bigger budget for the Securities and Exchange
Commission, raising the possibility of a savings-and-loan type
scandal if the government relaxes its vigilance over financial
markets.
   ``When we fail to provide the funds needed to staff a regulatory
agency ... then we leave too many opportunities for unscrupulous,
or simply incompetent, individuals,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., chairman of the securities subcommittee. ``I hope we can
apply the lessons from that (savings and loan) experience.''
   Dodd was supported by Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania, the
senior Republican on the subcommittee, and Sen. Donald W. Riegle
Jr., D-Mich., the chairman of the full committee.
   Heinz said that in one year Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond
chief Michael Milken, accused in the government's biggest-ever
securities fraud case, earned $550 million _ more than four times
the SEC's $135.2 million budget for 1988.
   ``It's truly a remarkable irony,'' he said.
   SEC Chairman David S. Ruder complained that the SEC's staff
total has remained almost flat since 1980, increasing from 2,041 to
2,050 during a time when securities trading has mushroomed. Ruder
is seeking budget authorization of $178 million in 1990, $212.6
million in 1991 and $238.1 million in 1992.
   ``Without additional resources, the commission's enforcement
staff will be unable to maintain its current pace of enforcement
actions,'' he said.

   Investigators of a stock scandal that has shaken
public trust in Prime Minister Noburu Takeshita and prompted
resignations of three Cabinet ministers said Tuesday they will
concentrate on prosecuting politicians.
   They made the statement after bringing bribery charges against
former Vice Minister of Education Kunio Takaishi, who was arrested
March 28.
   Fourteen bureaucrats and businessmen have been arrested in the
scandal centering on the publishing and information conglomerate,
the Recruit Co. They include Takashi Kato, a former vice minister
of labor, and Hisashi Shinto, former chairman of the
telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.
   Prosecutors said Tuesday's action concluded their inquiry into
the government bureaucracy's part in the scandal. They said they
will now focus on politicians.
   At least 17 politicians or aides, including those of Takeshita
and former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, reportedly received
large profits from 1986 sales of stocks in a Recruit subsidiary.
Most of the politicians, including Takeshita, have denied personal
wrongdoing.
   In a poll released Sunday, Takeshita's popularity sank to 3.9
percent, an all-time low. The survey followed his acknowledgement
last week that he had received more than $1 million in political
contributions from Recruit.
   Opposition parties repeatedly have demanded that Takeshita
resign and call new elections because of the scandal, but Takeshita
has vowed to stay on and push for ethics reform.
   Recruit sold unlisted shares at bargain prices to about 160
influential politicians, public officials and businessmen. The
recipients made large profits when the shares were listed shortly
afterward for public trading and shot up in price.
   Investigators said Tuesday that former Recruit chairman Hiromasa
Ezoe had sought Takaishi's help in blocking Education Ministry
plans to impose new regulations on job placement magazines. The
publications are one of Recruit's main lines of business.
   Ezoe sold the 59-year-old official 10,000 shares of stock
``which were certain to rise in value and extremely difficult for
the general public ... to obtain,'' the prosecutors said.
   According to a 1988 Supreme Court decision, the sale of stock
bound to rise in price and not available to the general public
could amount to bribery.
   Takaishi resigned from the ministry in June 1988 to run for
Parliament but pulled out of the race after his links to the
scandal were disclosed.

   A kitten so young its eyes were barely open
was found in a truckload of tents shipped from Memphis, Tenn., to
New Orleans for the annual Jazz and Heritage Festival.
   ``It's amazing it wasn't crushed. They throw those tents on the
truck,'' festival director Nancy Ochsenschlager said as the tents
were being put up Tuesday.
   She said workers at Mahaffey Tent Co. in Memphis found a stray
cat and her litter among the tents when they were loading them onto
a truck Thursday. Workers told her later the cat moved three of the
kittens and they did not see or hear the one she left behind.
   The kitten was found when workers unfolded the tents Saturday
for the weeklong festival that begins April 28.
   ``It was crying. It cried for a long time. When we finally got
it to eat something it went to sleep,'' Ochsenschlager said.
   Festival organizers named the tiny stowaway Fess, nickname of
jazz great Professor Longhair. It was adopted by Don Sidney,
production and stage coordinator for the Jazz Fest.

   A Cuban air force MiG-21 fighter jet crashed
into three houses today in the Cuban city of Holguin, the official
Cuban news agency Prensa Latina reported. There was no immediate
word on casualties.
   The agency quoted an airport official as saying the Soviet-made
fighter slammed into the homes at 9 a.m. in Holguin, about 470
miles east of the capital of Havana.
   The dispatch monitored in Mexico City did not say what caused
the crash.
   Firefighters blocked off the crash site while rescue workers and
military personnel searched for possible victims, the report said.
   ``Radio reporters in Holguin told Prensa Latina the plane,
belonging to the province's air base, completely destroyed a house
at 88 Jose A. Cardet St. and caused serious damages to at least two
others,'' the agency said.
   A witness said the fighter flew ``like it was riding a wave,
moving constantly at low altitude with its lights on'' seconds
before the crash, the report said.
   It said the plane went down in a working class residential
neighborhood several blocks from a public school.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves Bill to Make Fairness Doctrine a Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill that would require broadcasters to air
opposing views on controversial issues was approved by a Senate
committee Tuesday.
   The bill, virtually identical to a measure passed by Congress in
1987 but vetoed by then-President Reagan, was sent to the full
Senate on a voice vote by the Senate Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee.
   Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., voted against the bill. Committee
Chairman Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., noted that Sen. Bob Packwood,
R-Ore., also opposed the bill although he was not present for
Tuesday's vote.
   The bill would write into law the so-called fairness doctrine
that the Federal Communications Commission repealed in 1987. A
companion measure was passed out of committee April 11 to the
House, where it is awaiting floor action.
   The Justice Department told House Energy and Commerce Committee
Chairman John Dingell, D-Mich., it was recommending that President
Bush veto the bill if it passes Congress.
   When the FCC overturned the fairness doctrine, it cited First
Amendment concerns and also said the rules were outdated.
   The doctrine had been promulgated in the 1940s on the premise
that broadcasters should be required to be fair because only a few
``voices'' had access to public airwaves.
   But critics such as Packwood contend there is no shortage of
voices today in this era of cable TV, satellites and VCRs.
   Broadcasters claim the doctrine exerts a ``chilling effect'' on
discussions of controversial issues and is unconstitutional.
   But the bill's primary sponsor, Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii,
said the need for such legislation is greater than ever. He said
there is evidence broadcasters have been devoting less time to
controversial issues since the FCC repealed the doctrine.

<TEXT>
   The bicentennial of George Washington's
inauguration will be observed by Sotheby's with a sale of old
American manuscripts, including the first newspaper account of his
induction into office.
   The auction of 150 lots of American historical manuscripts, to
be held April 25, has sparked great interest among potential
buyers, Mary-Jo Kline, a vice president at the auction house, said
Tuesday.
   ``After two years of talk and celebration of the bicentennial of
the Constitution and its outcome, people really didn't need to be
reminded that this is an important month for Washington,'' she said.
   A highlight of the auction will be a report of Washington's
inauguration on April 18, 1789, that ran in the May 2 issue of the
Gazette of the United States. It is expected to bring $10,000 to
$15,000, the auction house said.
   The newspaper was established by John Fenno on April 15, 1789,
to provide a reliable source of news about the new government. The
Gazette's story about Washington's swearing-in on the balcony of
Federal Hall in New York City is probably the first printed account
of the event, according to Sotheby's.
   The May 2 issue that will be sold on the auction block is one of
10 copies known to survive. The other nine are owned by
institutions.
   One of the most interesting Washington-related items to be sold
is a 12-page fragment from the manuscript of Tobias Lear,
Washington's secretary from spring 1786 to 1793. The entry of
October 1786 provides a verbatim version of Washington's memories
of Benedict Arnold's treason in 1780.
   Washington begins his account of Arnold, who furnished the
British army with intelligence reports, by recalling: ``I had a
good opinion of Arnold before his treachery'' and ends by calling
him a ``mean, pittiful scoundrel.''
   The manuscript is estimated at $15,000 to $25,000.

   Swedish officials are taking their
sweet time in deciding whether entertainer Liza Minnelli will face
criminal charges over smuggling her dog into a hotel.
   ``It is a matter of bureaucratic procedure and there is no
rush,'' said Prosecutor Bjarne Rosen, who will make the decision.
He said Tuesday that customs police have completed their part of
the investigation into the ``Lilly'' affair of the cairn terrier.
   He'll decide in two or three weeks, Rosen said.
   Authorities seized Minnelli's dog at a Stockholm hotel on April
11 after her arrival on a tour with Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis
Jr.
   Inspector Stig Thelberg said at the time that ``Liza is guilty
of smuggling'' in violation of Sweden's strict quarantine laws.
Officials allowed the dog to be sent to Paris while Minnelli stayed
to perform.
   Dogs brought to Sweden must be put in quarantine for four
months, a measure credited with keeping the country free of rabies.
Minnelli, who came by bus from The Netherlands, said she had been
misinformed about the rules.

   Margo Adams, the ex-mistress of
Boston Red Sox star third baseman Wade Boggs, said she was paid
nearly $500,000 by Penthouse magazine for her story and seminude
photos.
   Ms. Adams disclosed the fee Monday at the 1989 conference of the
Organization of News Ombudsmen. The omudsmen investigate complaints
from newspaper readers and television viewers.
   The second of her two-part story and eight seminude photographs
appear in the May issue of Penthouse.
   Ms. Adams said she has few complaints about the coverage of her
story.
   ``I'm really not going to say what people expected, that I think
I've been treated unfairly _ I don't,'' Ms. Adams said.
   Most news reporters were fair to her, but sports writers, who
knew about the relationship between the two, protected Boggs
because of friendship, she said.
   She said she was surprised that those writers didn't contradict
Boggs' initial denial that the two had been involved because the
writers knew personally about the relationship.
   ``I sat on airplanes with these writers, went out to eat with
them. I knew them quite well,'' she said.

   A federal appeals court today refused to
release search warrants and related documents from the Pentagon
bribery investigation.
   Rejecting attempts by news organizations to inspect the
documents, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 3-0 that the
public has no right to such material, at least until a grand jury
has issued indictments.
   The ruling upheld decisions by judges in Los Angeles and San
Diego.
   Judge William Norris said the public's interest in observing the
judicial process is outweighed by the potential damage to an
investigation, including the risk of evidence being destroyed and
innocent people being maligned.
   More than a dozen people have been convicted or have pleaded
guilty in the 2-year Operation Ill Wind probe, in which contractors
and consultants are accused of bribing Pentagon officials for
inside information useful in winning contracts.
   Federal prosecutors obtained 39 search warrants in 16 judicial
districts around the country in June 1988.

<HEAD>Alaska Seafood Group Proposes $41 Million Ad Campaign</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Tanker Spill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Alaska seafood group has proposed a
$41.3 million advertising campaign to reassure anxious consumers
that state seafood remains pure despite last month's oil spill.
   At least part of the money could come from the Exxon Corp.,
whose tanker ran aground March 24 and spilled 10.1 million gallons
of North Slope crude oil into one of the nation's richest fishing
grounds.
   Merry Tuten, executive director of the Alaska Seafood Marketing
Institute, outlined at a board meeting Monday a major television
campaign and ads in national and international seafood and consumer
publications.
   Tuten told the joint state and industry group that the spending
plan ``was a guesstimate'' and that a final budget could be much
higher _ or much lower _ depending on the outcome of market
research.
   The tentative budget, which has been submitted to Gov. Steve
Cowper for review, is nearly seven times the size of the
institute's annual budget.
   Much of this year's campaign pitches the virtues of ``pure''
Alaska seafood from pristine coastal waters, ads aimed at consumers
spooked by reports of pollution in East Coast fishing grounds.
   In an April 7 letter to Tuten, Exxon's Don Cornett offered to
finance a state marketing campaign to reassure consumers or
wholesalers who ``believe that the supply or quality of Alaska
seafood will be affected.''
   ``Based on your analysis, we want your recommendations, and
budget figures for an appropriate marketing response. The ASMI
would have control ... and Exxon would be willing to provide
appropriate funding.''
   But some board members worried that taking the money might
hinder later efforts to collect damages from Exxon. Tuten said any
Exxon financing will be reviewed first by the state attorney
general's office.

   College students are planning a campus
demonstration in favor of legalizing marijuana _ but not, they
insist, for the reasons you might think.
   In an era of anti-drug sentiment, University of Illinois
students planning the 13th annual ``Hash Wednesday'' say they want
to promote the cannabis plant as a source of pulp for paper and
fiber.
   One of the organizers, Debby Spindel, said smoking pot in the
open or yelling obscenities at police will be discouraged.
   Steve Hager, an Urbana native and editor of High Times magazine,
said that if fast-growing marijuana plants were used as a source of
pulp in place of trees ``the greenhouse effect and deforestation
would never be happening.''
   ``The whole issue has shifted to the environment,'' Hager said
of efforts to legalize the forbidden weed.
   Jon Gettman, national director of National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws, said legalizing the growing of marijuana
makes economic sense.
   ``We grow $33.1 billion of it a year just for the flower,''
Gettman said. ``We're talking about giving farmers another
legitimate cash crop.''
   No matter what they claim as the purpose of the legalization
drive, police will be on hand Wednesday, said campus spokesman
Terry Shephard.

   Carolyn Freeman and Viola Crow insisted for
23 years that they were being billed for their neighbor's water.
They took sponge baths and recycled dish water in futile attempts
to reduce their bills.
   This month, the city finally acknowledged that the elderly
sisters were right _ and agreed to pay back everything they were
owed.
   ``I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown'' over the large
water bills, said Mrs. Freeman, 69. ``We've been counting the
drops.''
   She said she took her first real bath at home this weekend for
the first time in more than two decades. ``It was wonderful,'' she
said.
   The sisters' troubles began in 1966, when this little town west
of Athens started charging for water by usage instead of a flat
rate.
   Their bills started soaring although they did everything they
could to cut down on water use: set up a barrel to catch rain
water, took sponge baths, recycled dish water, even ate canned
vegetables to avoid having to wash fresh ones.
   Finally, city workers confirmed this month what the widows had
suspected all along _ the water line to the house next door ran
through their meter.
   Mayor C.D. ``Buck'' Holliday offered to reimburse the women
$280, the amount they've overpaid since 1986 when the city's
billing was computerized, but he later agreed to total repayment.
   ``I think they should give her free water for the rest of her
life, plus (pay) her for all her inconvenience,'' said assistant
city clerk Elaine Hyde. She said she didn't know how long it will
take to calculate how much the sisters should get.

   Oliver North and national security adviser
Robert McFarlane collaborated in lies to Congress reminiscent of
the tactics Adolf Hitler used in ruling Nazi Germany, the
prosecutor said today in final arguments at North's Iran-Contra
trial.
   ``North and McFarlane were following Adolf Hitler's old
strategy, which is the victor will never be asked if he told the
truth,'' prosecutor John Keker told the jury.
   In rebuttal, defense attorney Brendan Sullivan declared that
anyone ``who links Colonel North to Adolf Hitler is not credible
and should not be believed.'' He called the comparison outrageous.
   ``This man is not Adolf Hitler,'' Sullivan said, ``and he
doesn't do things like Adolf Hitler.''
   ``In this case, the government is off track and running wild,
and you should stop it,'' he told the jurors, who are expected to
begin deliberating Thursday.
   Keker also contended that North, a former White House aide,
tried to clear himself of charges by claiming ``the devil made me
do it.''
   North ``blames other people. `McFarlane made me to it. Casey
told me to do it,''' he said. William Casey was CIA director at the
time.
   Keker also called North ``the Joe Isuzu of government'' for
allegedly telling lies to the attorney general in November 1986 as
the Iran-Contra affair was erupting.
   Isuzu is a character in an television auto commercial who lies
outrageously.
   Continuing his assault, Keker suggested that North stole money
to help pay for a family car.
   North is accused of 12 criminal charges, including obstructing
Congress and making false statements to Congress and the attorney
general. They focus on an alleged attempt to cover up various
aspects of a secret Reagan administration operation to aid the
Contra rebels in Nicaragua when Congress banned U.S. aid.
   Conviction on all counts carries up to 60 years in prison and $3
million in fines.
   ``The tragedy of Oliver North is that the man who cared so much
for freedom in Nicaragua forgot about the demands of freedom ...
here at home,'' said Keker.
   He said that if North had looked up when he went into the Nov.
23, 1986 interview with the attorney general, he would have seen
these words inscribed in stone:
   ``Where law ends, tyranny begins.''
   Keker said North responded to congressional inquiries in the
late summer of 1985 by falsely denying that the National Security
Council staff was assisting the Nicaraguan rebels.
   In preparing the letters, North was ``shutting down,
obstructing, halting, fouling up'' the congressional inquries, said
Keker.
   North made similar denials a year later in a meeting with the
House Intelligence Committee.
   When he took the witness stand in his own defense, North cried
in describing the false statements he had made to the committee on
Aug. 6, 1986.
   ``Were they real tears or were they crocodile tears?'' said
Keker. ``When he lied to them, he didn't shed any tears. He was
thorough and convincing.''
   North acknowledged that he didn't tell the committee the truth,
but said he didn't know he was breaking the law in doing so.
   Keker dismissed North's suggestions that he was following orders
from top Reagan administration officials such as McFarlane and
Casey. Such claims are ``no more a defense'' than ``the devil made
me do it,'' the prosecutor said.
   ``Telling the truth is something you learned at your mother's
knee,'' prosecutor Keker told the jury following eight weeks of
testimony in the trial of the former White House aide.
   ``Government by deception is not a free government,'' Keker
said. ``Government by deception is not a democratic government.
Government by deception is not a government under the rule of law.''
   He said that in contrast to North's portrait of himself as a
Marine who simply followed orders, the former National Security
Council aide also ``described himself as a man of great power.''
   He said North ``did not hesitate'' to abuse that power by
saying, ``This is the White House calling,'' whether the call was
to Cabinet officials ``or a car dealer.''
   Keker contended that North stole some of the money in a $300,000
cash fund operated from his office safe to pay for a used car. The
fund was financed by Contra leader Adolfo Calero and retired Air
Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, whom North had enlisted to run arms
to the Contras.
   North testified that he got money for the GMC Suburban vehicle
from a metal box nailed to his closet floor at home.
   ``Oliver North gave you a story about buying that car which
turns out not to be true,'' Keker told the jury.
   ``He used the operational account'' in his office safe, which
was a source of ``liquid, untraceable, unaccountable funds,'' said
Keker. ``They were given to him without any'' strings attached ``at
all.''
   Keker said North also used travelers checks from Calero ``as a
personal piggy bank.'' North is charged with unlawfully converting
$4,300 in travelers checks to his own use.
   Former National Security Council staffer Mary Dix testified
Friday that North complained he was extremely short of cash on at
least five occasions, stopping suddenly in mid-1985.
   North ``says he was never tempted'' by the $300,000 cash fund in
his office, said Keker. ``You don't need to be an accountant, you
don't need to be a lawyer'' to figure out what happened, the
prosecutor said. ``Use your common sense.''
   Asked last week whether he got cash from Secord the same day he
had paid off the vehicle, North said he couldn't recall.

<HEAD>Walesa, Jaruzelski Meet for First Time in Seven Years</HEAD>

   Lech Walesa shook hands Tuesday with Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski, the man who ordered the Solidarity founder
arrested in 1981, and the Polish leader said later he was
satisified by the symbolic reconciliation.
   Walesa did not speak to reporters after the meeting with
Jaruzelski, their first since Nov. 4, 1981 _ five weeks before the
martial-law crackdown.
   A fragment of the emotionally charged session appeared on Polish
TV news. ``A mountain with a mountain ...,'' said Jaruzelski as he
greeted Walesa.
   ``I hope we will never part again,'' replied Walesa.
   Jaruzelski's greeting was the beginning of a saying in Polish
that in full goes: ``A mountain with a mountain cannot meet, but a
man can meet a man.''
   The face-to-face meeting between the man who once sought to
crush Solidarity and the one who vowed to revive it lasted for
about one hour in a comfortable reception room in the parliament
building on a wooded bluff near downtown Warsaw. It occurred one
day after Solidarity was declared legal again.
   Jaruzelski rarely speaks to reporters, but after the meeting he
gave an impromptu news conference. ``I feel satisfaction. We have
come a very difficult and long way,'' he said.
   ``Reconciliation is a process, not an act. So if we talk about
an act, it is rather the round table,'' referring to the two months
of negotiations that led to agreements April 5 between the
opposition and communist authorities.
   Outside the parliament building after the meeting, Walesa smiled
and shook hands with Jaruzelski; Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, the
interior minister; and other party and government leaders.
   Other opposition participants also were reserved in commenting
on the meeting. Many of them were imprisoned following the Dec. 13,
1981, martial-law decree issued by Jaruzelski to suppress the East
bloc's first independent trade union.
   Later, top union adviser Bronislaw Geremek, said: ``The round
table started in an atmosphere of tension and expectation and later
changed. And today the meeting also began with some tension, but
later the atmosphere of the round table found its culmination.''
   Speaking by telephone from his home, the historian added, ``The
road to national reconciliation is long and rough, and we are only
at the beginning of this road.''
   Official photographs showed Walesa and Jaruzelski laughing
together. In one photograph, Walesa had a glass of cognac on a
table in front of him.
   Walesa wore his traditional Solidarity pin and a badge with a
picture of the Black Madonna of Czestochowa, Poland's most revered
religious icon, on his lapel.
   The occasion was a reception given by Jaruzelski immediately
after the first meeting of the Arbitration Commmission, a group set
up to oversee implementation of economic and political reforms.
   Jaruzelski did not exclude further meetings with Walesa, telling
reporters that such meetings ``will cease to be something
extraordinary. If there is a need I think we will be meeting, make
contacts. I think all conditions exist for it.''
   He said the ``meeting obviously did not have a substantial
character. It was more symbolic. But I think (it was) valuable as
it creates a certain climate, a certain mood, which should spread
to society.''
   Jaruzelski led a reluctant Communist Party to allow
reinstatement of Solidarity, and he hopes the movement will help in
pulling Poland out of its economic crisis.
   During its first legal phase in 1980-81, the union claimed 10
million members out of an 18 million-member workforce. Union
leaders expect Solidarity to attract 5 million to 7 million members
now that it is legal again.
   A government spokesman portrayed the meeting as a sign Poland
has changed course after the historic round table agreements that
also permit the opposition to field independent candidates to the
existing parliament and a new 100-member senate.
   ``A new chapter is starting in the history of Poland, and it
seems that both of the politicians are characterized by a great
sense of timing and a capacity to respond to the challenges of
time,'' said deputy government spokesman Zbyslaw Rykowski.
   Besides Jaruzelski, Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, once
an ardent defender of martial law, the heads of Poland's two other
communist-allied political parties, and other senior party and
government officials were present.
   Walesa was accompanied by about a dozen top union leaders and
advisers to the meeting. Some were casually dressed in jeans and
sweaters.
   In the busy first day of the reborn Solidarity union, Walesa had
a breakfast meeting with Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France
and said that Poland must focus on solving its economic crisis now
that the union is legal.
   He then met with opposition leaders picking independent
candidates for the June elections to parliament.
   Walesa and his wife, Danuta, and several top advisers depart for
Rome on Wednesday to meet with Polish-born Pope John Paul II.

   A female professional wrestler known
as ``Mount Fiji'' and six other people have been charged with
assault, rioting or battery on authorities who tried to break up an
unruly bridal shower.
   The partygoers, most of them Samoan-Americans, alleged brutality
and racism by sheriff's deputies called to the party in suburban
Cerritos on Feb. 11.
   District Attorney Ira Reiner said Monday no charges will be
filed against the officers, who he said were attacked while
responding to complaints from neighbors.
   ``This was a mob, and there were very large people,'' Reiner
said. ``This began with a 290-pound man picking up a cinder block
and heaving it at a sheriff's deputy.''
   Sheriff Sherman Block said nine of the 15 deputies injured
required medical attention.
   An arraignment is scheduled May 1 in Los Cerritos Municipal
Court for David Dole, 28, Sale Paopao, 19, Jon Talamaival, 25, and
Mark Rodarte, 25, on charges of assault with a deadly weapon on a
peace officer and misdemeanor rioting.
   Emily Dole, 31, a wrestler, was charged with obstructing a peace
officer and rioting. Two other women, Opa Tagaloa, 23, and Sheron
Dole, 20, were charged with battery and rioting, and Tagaloa with
obstructing a police officer.

<TEXT>
   Adnan Khashoggi, the flamboyant Saudi
financier once reputed to be the world's wealthiest man, was
arrested Tuesday on charges he helped Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos
hide riches stolen from the Philippines.
   The jet-setting arms merchant, allegedly the man who brokered
the Iran-Contra arms deal, was seized by police at an elegant Bern
hotel and jailed, said Pierre Schmid, assistant director of the
Swiss Federal Police Office.
   Schmid said the arrest came shortly after the U.S. Embassy
tipped off Swiss authorities that Khashoggi was in the capital and
demanded his arrest.
   The United States plans to submit a detailed extradition request
within 60 days as required by treaty, said U.S. Embassy spokesman
Michael Korff.
   Khashoggi, the Marcoses, five other people and a California bank
were indicted in October by a U.S. District Court in New York.
   The indictment accuses the ousted Philippines dictator and his
wife of stealing more than $100 million from the Philippine
treasury to buy real estate and expensive art objects in New York.
   Overall, the Philippines says the couple took $3.5 billion in
cash and property.
   The U.S. government alleges that Khashoggi, 54, posed as owner
of some of the assets to help hide that they actually belonged to
Marcos, prosecutors have said.
   Khashoggi is charged with racketeering, conspiracy, obstruction
of justice and mail fraud. Racketeering alone carries a penalty of
up to 20 years in prison.
   Swiss authorities said a U.S. diplomatic note demanding
Khashoggi's arrest cited four buildings in Manhattan and a
collection of paintings that disappeared from a Manila museum.
Khashoggi allegedly bought them for Marcos as part of ``obfuscation
maneuvers'' during the ex-president's reign, Schmid said.
   Marcos fled into exile in Hawaii after the February 1986
civilian-military uprising that put Corazon Aquino in power.
   Under the U.S.-Swiss extradition treaty, Swiss authorities must
decide whether Khashoggi's alleged offenses are considered criminal
acts under both U.S. and Swiss law.
   Police arrested Khashoggi in a ``gentlemanly'' way without using
handcuffs at the downtown, five-star Hotel Schweizerhof where he
was staying, manager Jean-Jacques Gauer told The Associated Press.
   He was taken to the nearby district jail, the Swiss justice
ministry said. Schmid indicated bail was likely to be set
exceptionally high.
   Khashoggi, 54, arrived in Switzerland on Monday for unidentified
medical treatment, said a well-placed Swiss official speaking on
condition of anonymity. Khashoggi, who has lived in Paris, has
visited a Bern hospital in the past for rejuvenating fresh cell
therapy.
   His office in Saudi Arabia declined immediate comment on the
arrest.
   The Philippines claims that after the Marcoses went into exile,
their agents and Khashoggi carted away 25 paintings from New York
properties owned by the Marcoses. The action allegedly came after a
California federal judge ordered that none of the Marcoses'
property could be moved.
   Khashoggi allegedly sold 12 paintings for $3.2 million.
   Khashoggi was quoted by a Saudi newspaper in October as denying
the allegations contained in the indictment and classifying the
case as a civil rather than criminal action.
   Khashoggi has 10 days to file an appeal and request his release.
The Federal Tribunal, Switzerland's supreme court, would have the
final say if he fights an extradition order.
   Born in Mecca as one of 14 children of the late King Ibn Saud's
personal physician, Khashoggi became known for his flamboyant
lifestyle and business talent.
   He figured in several kickback scandals, with U.S. aircraft
manufacturers allegedly paying him large amounts for arranging
billion-dollar defense contracts.
   He reputedly was the main financier and broker in the
Iran-Contra affair, where proceeds from sales of U.S. arms to Iran
allegedly were funneled to rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist
government.
   Khashoggi said in 1986 he lost $10 million on the deal.
   Published reports once estimated Khashoggi's personal wealth at
up to $4 billion and he was reported to be the richest man in the
world. But falling oil prices, stricter control of arms dealing and
loss-making deals recently have reportedly left him in financial
straits.
   Mrs. Marcos has pleaded innocent to the charges contained in the
U.S. indictment. Marcos has said he is too ill to appear in New
York for legal proceedings.

   The House prepared today to accept a federal
commission's recommendations to shut down 86 military bases, but
some members maintained that the final list was not a fair one.
   ``We do need to address the wide expenditure of taxpayers' money
but we have a right to expect ... competence, honesty and
fairness,'' said Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., at the start of debate
on a resolution to reject the commission's plan.
   In the cases of Fort Sheridan and Chanute Air Force Base in his
state of Illinois, Porter claimed, ``We got uninformed judgment. We
got an unintelligent approach.''
   He argued that the information the commission used in estimating
the bases' value was outdated and erroneous.
   Both Democratic and Republican leaders said the House was
certain to accept the commission's plan.
   ``It's time to get serious about deficit reduction,'' said Rep.
Ronald Machtley, R-R.I. ``Obsolete bases have drained our
resources. ... The recommendations are the only viable option for
cutting expenditures of funds.''
   Last month, the House Armed Services Committee voted 43-4 to
support the report by the Commission on Base Realignment and
Closure, as the commission is formally known.
   Although they acknowledged that the resolution to disapprove
will likely be defeated, lawmakers from New Jersey, California and
Illinois continued to plead with their colleagues Monday.
   ``We've been told ... mistakes have been made,'' Rep. Jim
Saxton, R-N.J., said in a speech on the chamber floor. ``The House
has an opportunity not to be party to that mistake.''
   In debate last week, lawmakers cited congressional reports that
found the commission used incorrect information as a basis for its
decision and overestimated savings from the base closings.
   Savings from the plan, which also includes substantial changes
at 54 other facilities, are estimated at $694 million a year at
first. Savings over 20 years are estimated at $5.6 billion.
   The law requires that Congress either reject the entire plan or
allow it to go into effect as s.
   In a related development Monday, the National Federation of
Federal Employees filed suit against the goverment to prevent the
closings, saying the law creating the commission was
unconstitutional.
   The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court said the Base Closure
and Realignment Act violates the Constitution ``by improperly
delegating the important legislative function of regulating the
disposition of government property, to the unelected secretary of
defense, and to the unelected members of the commission.''
   The union represents 5,000 employees at George Air Force Base
and Norton Air Force Base in California, and Chanute Air Force Base
in Illinois. All three bases are scheduled to be closed.
   James M. Peirce, president of the union, said the commission
based its decision on ``erroneous and out of date information.''
   ``To put it simply, the commission blew it and it doesn't appear
as if the majority of Congress gives a damn,'' he said.
   The union is seeking a declaratory judgment from the courts on
whether the Base Closure and Realignment Act is unconstitutional.

<HEAD>Court Says Price-Fixing Victims Can Sue on Anti-Trust Grounds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave consumers a
chance to recover, through antitrust lawsuits, the extra money they
spend because of illegally inflated prices.
   By a 7-0 vote, the justices said state laws may allow those
indirectly affected by illegal price-fixing to sue for monetary
damages.
   Lower courts had struck down such state laws, ruling that they
are precluded by the federal antitrust law's bar on suits by
``indirect purchasers.''
   ``This is an extremely important victory for the American
consumer,'' said Ramon Klitzke, a Marquette University law
professor who had studied the case decided Tuesday.
   ``I foresee many cases in which lawyers representing consumers
will pursue antitrust remedies in state courts, and consumer
associations will file `class action' lawsuits in behalf of
numerous consumers,'' Klitzke said.
   In other matters, the court:
   _Ruled that international airline passengers do not have to be
told beforehand that they cannot collect more than $75,000 in the
event of an accident.
   The court, in a unanimous decision stemming from the 1983
shooting down of a Korean Air Lines jet in Soviet airspace, freed
KAL from having to pay more than the $75,000 per-passenger limit
because the airline failed to give adequate warnings on tickets.
   _Ruled unanimously in a Massachusetts case that states may
prosecute employers for withholding accrued vacation pay owed fired
workers.
   _Was urged during a courtroom argument session to strike down as
unconstitutional some of the huge punitive-damages awards won in
personal-injury cases and other lawsuits.
   The price-fixing decision reinstated efforts by four states _
California, Minnesota, Alabama and Arizona _ to participate in a
$32 million settlement of an alleged nationwide conspiracy to fix
cement prices.
   At least 11 other states and the District of Columbia have
enacted antitrust laws giving indirect purchasers the right to sue.
   The states are Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland,
Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico, Rhode Island, South Dakota and
Wisconsin.
   Klitzke predicted that ``attorneys general in other states now
will recommend to their legislatures that similar laws be enacted.''
   The court's ruling restores a right the nation's consumers
enjoyed until a 1977 decision by the justices.
   In that decision, the court had interpreted federal antitrust
law as barring most lawsuits by ultimate consumers even if they
suffer the most harm from the illegal conduct.
   Under the 1977 ruling, if a manufacturer illegally conspires to
fix a product's price and sells it to a retailer, the retailer may
use federal antitrust law to sue for triple damages.
   But if the retailer passes on the illegally inflated price when
selling the product, federal law bars the consumer from suing.
   Tuesday's decision, however, allows such customers to sue under
state antitrust laws.
   A spate of lawsuits was filed against cement manufacturers in
1976 and 1977, alleging a nationwide conspiracy to fix prices. Each
of the four states involved in today's court action filed a suit,
based in part on state laws protecting indirect purchasers.
   Four states sought to sue on behalf of county and municipal
governments that had purchased cement or products containing cement.
   The litigation was consolidated in federal court in Arizona, and
by 1981 cement manufacturers had agreed to pay $32 million to
settle the case.
   Direct purchasers then challenged the states' right to be
compensated for indirect purchases.
   A federal trial judge, later upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, threw out the states' suits.
   Writing for the high court, Justice Byron R. White said that
allowing enforcement of state antitrust laws protecting indirect
purchasers does not impair the effectiveness of federal antitrust
law.
   Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor did not
participate in the case for unannounced reasons.

   A small amount of radiation was released
earlier this year when a nuclear weapons experiment went awry, a
spokesman for Sandia National Laboratories has confirmed.
   The incident occurred Feb. 3 on the Tonopah Test Range, about
200 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
   Sandia spokesman Nigel Hey said an 8-inch howitzer cannon shell
filled with electronic equipment and radioactive material was fired
above the range. Hey said a parachute attached to the shell failed
to open and the shell penetrated the Earth instead of floating
gently to the ground.
   The device did not explode, Hey said.
   Sandia officials decided the next day to blow up the dummy
warhead with dynamite rather than move it.
   Hey said the explosion contaminated an 80-square-foot area of
the test range with small amounts of uranium. State health
officials say snow in the area prevented Sandia officials from
cleaning up the contaminated area for 20 days.
   Bill Schneider, chief of the bureau of regulatory services for
the state Division of Health, said health officials monitored the
ground for radiation on March 7, and found no contamination.
   Sandia is an Energy Department contractor and conducts several
experiments a year in conjunction with the department's office of
military operations.

<HEAD>Bush Tells Conservatives He Still Supports the Idea of Tuition Tax
Credits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush reassured conservatives that he
still supports the idea of tuition tax credits for parents of
private school students, according to those who met with him
Tuesday.
   In addition, Bush received high marks, after a White House
meeting with a group of evangelical Christians and other
conservatives, for the personal example he sets by attending church
services every Sunday and by his concern for people.
   ``On behalf of the evangelicals, we are extremely pleased with
Mr. Bush,'' said Billy Zeoli, president of Gospel Films, who added
that more than any policy directive it was ``mostly his example''
that encouraged them.
   Asked if he was implying criticism of former President Reagan,
who spoke often of Christian values but rarely went to church,
Zeoli said he was making no comparison and that ``everyone has
their own style.''
   The group discussed other family-centered issues, including
Bush's child-care proposal and the recent Washington march by
hundreds of thousands of pro-abortion supporters.
   On March 29, Bush had raised conservative concerns when he told
a student who asked if his parents should get a tax break for
paying tuition to send their son to a private school: ``No, they
shouldn't.'' Bush added: ``Can't afford to do that.''
   When the conservatives told him Tuesday of their worries about
those comments, the president ``indicated there had been some
confusion and that philosophically he still thought credits were
good but that the budget would not allow it,'' according to Gary
Bauer, president of the conservative Family Research Council and
one of those at the meeting.
   Bauer, interviewed by telephone, and others, who spoke to
reporters outside the White House, said they were satisfied with
Bush's assurances. They said they recognized the budget argument
and were happy at least with his philosophical stance.
   White House press spokesman B.J. Cooper said that Bush has not
wavered in his support for the idea of tuition tax credits, but
that as the president had said on March 29, the constraints of the
federal budget and the need to maintain revenues are not conducive
to creating such a program this year.
   In those earlier comments, Bush had told the boy who questioned
him, ``Everybody should support the public school system and then,
if on top of that, your parents think that they want to shell out
in addition to the tax money, tuition money, that's their right.
But I don't think they should get a break for that.''
   The Reagan administration had supported the idea of tuition tax
credits for parents sending children to private schools, but
dropped the idea in a major overhaul of the tax system.
   Bush's March 29 comments caused Robert Dugan Jr., director of
the National Association of Evangelicals, to send a letter
expressing ``dismay'' about Bush's apparent shift of position.
   The conservatives, who in the past have been suspicious of
Bush's commitment to many of their causes, were generally
complimentary of him after Tuesday's meeting.
   ``As a general rule, evangelicals are happy and pleased with the
job the president has been doing,'' said Adrian Rogers, former
president of the Southern Baptist Convention.
   There was much discussion on abortion, with the conservatives
indicating they hoped the massive turnout by the pro-choice group
would not make Bush soften his anti-abortion stance.
   Bush said Tuesday that he supported the right of the protesters
to voice their opinions, said Jerry Vines, president of the
Southern Baptist Convention.
   However, he was ``very reassuring'' in his statement opposed to
abortion, said Bauer.

<HEAD>Court Says International Passengers Don't Have to be Warned about
$75,000 Liability Limit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that
international airline passengers do not have to be warned by
carriers _ even in the fine print _ that they can collect no more
than $75,000 apiece in air disasters.
   In a case stemming from the Soviet downing of a Korean Air Lines
jet that claimed 269 lives in 1983, the court said an airline's
failure to alert passengers to the $75,000 limit does not expose it
to greater financial penalties.
   By a 9-0 vote, the justices said KAL will not be penalized for
its failure to use the proper size type on its tickets to alert
passengers to the $75,000 limit.
   Such warnings generally alert passengers that they must buy
private insurance if they want additional financial protection.
   While the court was unanimous in shielding KAL from larger
damages, the justices were sharply divided in granting airlines
even broader protection from costly lawsuits.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court said an international agreement known
as the Warsaw Convention does not force airlines to give passengers
any adequate warning on their tickets that there is a $75,000
damage limit.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said, ``The
Warsaw Convention does not eliminate the limitation on damages for
passenger injury or death as a sanction for failure to provide
adequate notice of that limitation.''
   In a separate concurring opinion, Justice William J. Brennan
took issue with the breadth of Scalia's opinion.
   Brennan said Scalia's opinion means airlines are free to give
passengers no warning at all about how much they can collect. Under
the court's decision, Brennan said, the only time an airline could
be forced to pay more than $75,000 is ``when no passenger ticket at
all is delivered.''
   The ruling permits airlines to omit any warning about their
financial liability even in the fine print, Brennan continued.
   ``Notice that is not minimally legible, at the least, is no
notice at all,'' he said.
   Joining in his concurring opinion were Justices Thurgood
Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   Tuesday's case has its origins with the flight of KAL Flight 7,
which was en route from New York City to Seoul, Korea, when it was
shot down by a Soviet military airplane Sept. 1, 1983. The KAL jet
flew more than 300 miles off course and entered Soviet airspace
over the Sea of Japan.
   All aboard were killed, including Rep. Lawrence McDonald, D-Ga.
   Many of the victims' families, including McDonald's widow, sued
KAL in various federal courts. The wrongful-death lawsuits were
consolidated and presented to a federal trial judge here.
   Lawyers for the victims' families in 1984 asked U.S. District
Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. to declare that KAL was not eligible
for the $75,000-per-death cap imposed by the Warsaw Convention.
   A separate private pact among airlines, the Montreal Agreement,
says the notice of the $75,000 limit must be specified in print
size no smaller than 10-point type.
   The KAL tickets announced the limit in 8-point type.
   Robinson ruled in favor of Korean Air Lines and the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals here upheld his decision in 1987, dismissing the
suit by the passengers' families.

   The head of the team that redesigned the
faulty space shuttle booster rockets is leaving NASA this week to
become an aerospace official for Lockheed Corp.
   John Thomas, 52, is retiring as special assistant to the
director of the Marshall Space Flight Center to become Lockheed's
Kennedy Space Center site director.
   At the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, he has
worked on the Skylab and Spacelab programs as well as helping
pinpoint a failed booster rocket seal as the cause of the 1986
Challenger explosion. The redesigned solid fuel rockets have flown
successfully three times.
   Thomas will direct Lockheed's contract work processing space
shuttles, including stacking boosters and mating the shuttle
orbiters and boosters to the external fuel tank.
   Thomas said a decision to leave Marshall and NASA after 28 years
in various space agency assignments came after considering
``whether I wanted to go on doing what I was doing ... or go do
something different.''

   New residential construction suffered its
second straight decline in March, the government said Tuesday in a
report that analysts cited as evidence the housing industry will
bear the brunt of a campaign to restrain economic growth.
   The Commerce Department report said construction of new homes
and apartments dropped 5.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 1.4 million units in March after plunging 12 percent in
February.
   Construction of single-family homes slowed to an annual pace of
994,000 units, the slowest rate since January 1985, while starts of
multi-family dwellings fell 8.8 percent to an annual rate of
403,000 units.
   Applications for building permits, meanwhile, fell 13.7 percent
in March after dropping 6.1 percent in the preceding month. That
was the biggest monthly drop since a 14 percent decline in October
1981, in the early stages of the last recession.
   Tuesday's report contained ``nothing but negatives'' for the
nation's housing industry, said David Seiders, chief economist for
the National Association of Home Builders.
   But that was seen as good news by those worried about
accelerating inflation, who hope that slower economic growth will
help restrain price increases.
   Analysts said the March report showed that housing is feeling
the pinch of interest rates pushed upward by the Federal Reserve
Board as part of its campaign to restrain the economy and check
inflation.
   Fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages are now averaging 11.11 percent,
up almost one full percentage point from a year ago, according to a
national survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   ``Housing is always something that gets hit hard by higher
interest rates,'' said economist John Hagens of the WEFA Group in
Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``The interest-sensitive sectors of the economy
will bear the brunt of any downturn.''
   Thomas Holloway, senior economist for the Mortgage Bankers
Association, said further weakness in housing is likely to show up
in the next few months, but ``if we're lucky, the housing sector
will probably emerge a little stronger than it is right now.''
   Nevertheless, a growing number of analysts are worried that the
Federal Reserve is unlikely to complete its anti-inflation campaign
without pushing the country into a recession, with housing leading
the way downward.
   Housing is likely to ``lead us into a significant slowdown and
ultimately, probably, a mild recession,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist for the Boston Co. ``That probably will be the price paid
to get inflation down.''
   Economist Michael Sumichrast, publisher of a housing newsletter,
said the Federal Reserve's tight money policy was ``killing housing
very successfully.''
   ``It's clearly a housing recession,'' Sumichrast said. ``I think
it's fair to say we are in the forefront of a recession. I don't
think you can really turn it around any more.''
   The weakness in March was led by a steep 34.1 percent drop in
construction activity in the Northeast, where housing starts fell
to an annual rate of 149,000 units, the slowest pace in the region
since September 1983.
   Seiders said that decline represented an ``inventory
correction'' after heavy overbuilding in the region earlier in the
1980s, when demand was strong and prices were rising.
   Starts of new homes and apartments were off 5.2 percent in the
South, dropping to an annual rate of 546,000 units, while starts in
the West dropped by 1 percent to a rate of 395,000 units.
   The Midwest was the only region to enjoy an increase in
activity, with new construction climbing 10.4 percent to an annual
rate of 307,000 units.
   The 13.7 percent decline in building permits in March left
permits at an annual rate of 1.22 million units, the slowest pace
since October 1982.

   A dozen cars of a passenger train
derailed in a rocky region of central India on Tuesday, killing 40
people and injuring 119 others, officials said.
   The death toll was expected to rise, with at least 20 of the
injured in critical condition, said Matthew John, director of
railway safety for the Railway Ministry.
   Officials said they did not know what caused the derailment of
the 21-car Karnataka Express, which left the southern city of
Bangalore on Monday for New Delhi and was carrying about 1,000
people. Officials said it ran off the track in a remote region
between Lalitpur and Dailwara stations, 280 miles south of New
Delhi.
   Eight of the derailed cars rolled down an embankment, John said.
About 16 of the train's cars carried passengers and the rest
carried freight, he said.
   About 20 people died at the scene and the rest died shortly
after arrival at Lalitpur Civil Hospital, two miles from the
accident site, John said.
   Twenty of the most critical cases were moved to a hospital in
Jhansi, the nearest major town, he said.
   Railway Minister Madhav Rao Scindia arrived at the accident site
to supervise rescue operations. All rail travel to southern India
was canceled because wreckage blocked the tracks.
   The Railway Ministry ordered an inquiry into the accident.
Officials said they did not know how fast the two-engine train was
traveling.

<HEAD>Inquiry Begins Into Britain's Worst Sports Disaster</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soccer fans kicked, harassed and urinated on
police as the officers tried to rescue victims of the Sheffield
stadium disaster, a Conservative lawmaker charged Tuesday.
   The government officially began its inquiry into the tragedy,
Britain's worst sports disaster. During the night, the death of a
14-year-old boy pushed the death toll to 95.
   Police have been sharply criticized for their handling of crowd
on Saturday at Hillsborough Stadium, where the deaths occurred just
minutes into an English Association Cup semifinal match between
Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.
   Irvine Patnick, a Conservative member of Parliament representing
Sheffield, said officers told him Liverpool fans hindered police as
they tried to save people. Similar claims, attributed to
undientified police officers, appeared in press reports.
   ``They told me they were hampered, harassed, punched, kicked and
urinated on by Liverpool fans,'' Patnick said. ``All of this
happened to them ... and now they are being blamed.
   ``I saw the bruising on their bodies and the state they were in
and there is no doubt in my mind that it is true.''
   South Yorkshire's chief ambulance officer, Don Page, said one of
his men needed hospital treatment after being attacked as he
treated an injured fan.
   The stadium disaster occurred when thousands of fans were
allowed to enter an already crowded standing-room-only ``terrace''
area. Spectators were trampled in the rush or suffocated against a
10-foot fence built to keep fans off the field.
   Of the 170 people injured, 25 still were being treated in
hospitals, including 19 in intensive care.
   Writs were filed in Liverpool High Court Tuesday for nine of the
injured. They are seeking damages for personal injuries and
alleging negligence or breach of duty by South Yorkshire Chief
Constable Peter Wright and the Sheffield Wednesday Soccer Club.
   News reports have centered on speculation that the deaths may
have been caused by a police decision to open a gate to relieve
crowding outside the stadium, admitting the flood of late-comers.
   Appeals Judge Peter Taylor, who is heading the government
inquiry, said it was too early to pinpoint the major issues.
   ``The focus of the inquiry will be to find out what happened and
make recommendations as to how this situation can be avoided in the
future,'' he said at a Sheffield news conference with West Midlands
Chief Constable Geoffrey Dear, who is conducting a separate inquiry
into the actions of South Yorkshire police.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, however, told the House of Commons
on Monday that the issue of the opening of the gate would be a
central question of the inquiry.
   Hurd said the government may ban standing-room-only sections at
major soccer clubs.
   Meanwhile, Jacques Georges, Europe's top soccer official,
apologized for comparing English soccer fans to beasts.
   Georges, president of the Switzerland-based European Union of
Football Associations, withdrew his remark after angry protests
from English soccer officials,
   A Sheffield coronor's inquest began Tuesday into the cause of
six of the deaths. Lawyer Harry Livermore, who is representing the
six families, rejected Georges' apology.
   ``The tragedy will never will never be forgotten or forgiven,
nor will the remark of Mr. Georges, however many times he may
apologize,'' he told South Yorkshire coroner Dr. Stefan Popper.
   The Football Association also said it approves of continuing the
Cup competition, but the Liverpool team decided Tuesday to postpone
for one week a decision on whether to continue participating.
Liverpool club chairman John Smith called the association
``insensitive'' for asking for a decision so soon.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of civilians fled west Beirut
on Tuesday as Christian and Syrian gunners held their fire briefly
to allow the evacuation of 70 severely wounded Moslems to a French
hospital ship.
   Hundreds of cars packed with suitcases, mattresses and blankets
sped down a seaside highway to south and east Lebanon as the
wounded were assembled outside the home of acting Prime Minister
Salim Hoss.
   Eight people were killed and 43 wounded overnight as the city's
divided population huddled in bunkers and bomb shelters for a third
night. That raised the toll to 270 killed and 975 wounded since
fighting erupted March 8.
   Pillars of flame from burning buildings lighted the sky and the
city was laden with smoke as Christian army units and Syrian and
Moslem gunners bombarded the capital with rocket, artillery and
tank fire.
   Police said the state's Christian Channel 5 television station
in east Beirut took 30 direct hits. It has stopped broadcasting.
   A Christian barrage gutted Moslem Radio Beirut's nine-story
building Sunday.
   France's President Francois Mitterrand asked President Bush,
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and other world leaders
Tuesday to help end the fighting in this former French colony, said
Mitterrand spokesman Hubert Vedrine.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III told the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee the United States is unable to end the
violence and has only scant influence with Syria.
   Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported a telephone
conversation between Mitterrand and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak ``crystallized the idea of making joint efforts at the
international level to halt the bloodshed.''
   The Arab League Council called an emergency meeting for Friday
on Lebanon, although it has failed to rein the fighting with three
failed cease-fires.
   The council comprises foreign ministers of the 22 member states
which in 1976 granted Syria a mandate to pacify Lebanon. Damascus
maintains 40,000 troops in Lebanon.
   ``I can't take it any more,'' said Farah Shatilla of west
Beirut. ``We can live without bread, electricity and water. But
hearing the screams of death and agony of our neighbors, this I
can't take.''
   An artillery round early Tuesday hit Mrs. Shatilla's neighbors
on Rue Verdun. The explosion killed four people and wounded 11, two
of them children.
   ``Oh Allah, please send someone to help us! We have dead people
here!'' a man screamed after the blast.
   Rescuers arrived 10 minutes later. As they dug through the
rubble, more rounds hit the neighborhood and started fires.
   The duels escalated dramatically around midnight, minutes after
the Christian Voice of Lebanon radio station aired an interview in
which Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun vowed to crush President
Hafez Assad of Syria.
   ``All the things that we have been worried about have been
crushed. One head remains to be crushed: it is Assad's head,'' said
Aoun, whose beleaguered forces are outnumbered at least 3-1.
   Voice of the Nation radio in Moslem west Beirut said Aoun has
``gone mad.''
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt, a staunch ally of Syria, said of
Aoun: ``All he's doing is destroying Lebanon.''
   The wounded Moslems were driven with 50 relatives in ambulances
and taxis to Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut. They were to be
ferried to the floating hospital, Rance, then flown to France.
   Non-stop barrages that have raged since Saturday eased into
sporadic firing as Kouchner, French Minister for Humanitarian
Assistance, escorted the wounded. He already has evacuated 14
wounded Christians to the Rance.
   Another French navy vessel, the tanker Penhors, was sailing off
Lebanon while Kouchner negotiated with rivals Aoun and Hoss to
unload fuel oil to reactivate power stations. Beirut has been
without power since Sunday. That has halted water pumps, too.
   Also sailing off Lebanon are two Cypriot-flagged ferries that
will keep sailing despite fierce shelling, their agents said
Tuesday.
   The Baroness and its sister ship, Larnaca Rose, provide the only
link with the outside world for the besieged Christians and have
carried thousands to Larnaca since the fighting started.
   On Sunday, the Baroness was shelled at its anchorage in Jounieh
port, 12{ miles north of Beirut.
   ``The shelling wasn't aimed at us ... If we'd been the gunners'
target, they'd have sunk the ship,'' Greek skipper Dionysos
Papanicolatos said Tuesday before leaving Larnaca on the 9-hour
voyage to Lebanon.
   ``They were aiming at the apartment blocks in Jounieh and at the
port itself,'' he said.
   A spokesman for the shipping agency I.S. Geropoulos said the
vessels now will anchor 10 miles offshore and passengers will be
taken aboard by speedboat.
   Beirut's only international airport shut down five weeks ago.
   The fighting started after Aoun ordered a blockade of
militia-run ports that deprive the treasury of $100 million a year
in tax revenues.
   Jumblatt, whose militia runs two such ports, rejected Aoun's
decision and starting shelling the 800-square-mile Christian
enclave.

<TEXT>
   Mississippi, which has one of the nation's
highest illiteracy rates and some of its poorest school districts,
launched a campaign Tuesday to put teaching computers into every
public elementary school.
   The state will raise $13 million for the project over four years
with the help of two foundations.
   Gov. Ray Mabus said the Riordan Foundation of Los Angeles and
the RORD Foundation of New York will make an initial investment of
$1.5 million to begin installing computers this fall and raise an
additional $5.5 million over the next three years. He said the
state would provide about $1.5 million a year in matching funds.
   The computer learning system would be made available to
kindergartens and first-grades.
   ``We have a goal in Mississippi for everybody to read and write.
I think today we are taking a big step in that direction,'' Mabus
said a news conference with Richard Riordan of the Riordan
Foundation and Richard Dowling of the RORN Foundation.
   The foundations presented the first $1.5 million to the governor.
   Mabus said he hoped to get the computer labs _ which include
computer work stations, listening library station and other working
areas _ in place in about one-third of the school districts by this
fall. The state has about 150 school districts.
   The program will use an IBM system called ``Writing to Read,''
which allows children to write anything they can say and read what
they write. The system also allows children to learn at their own
pace.
   ``We feel this is the way to teach literacy. It is a very
wonderful system. The kids love it,'' Riordan said. ``What happens
is they hear the words, they play games with it. They can't wait to
get into the labs for the next session.
   ``If they are slow, it doesn't criticize them. They really good
about themselves,'' he said.
   Mabus and his wife, Julie, have vowed to fight illiteracy in the
state. Based on 1980 census data, state officials estimate that as
many as 400,000 adults in Mississippi have less than nine years of
formal education and that most of them are functionally illiterate.
   Mabus said the project's goal is to ensure that ``every child in
Mississippi ... can read and write by the time they leave the first
grade.''
   ``What we are talking about is giving our students and teachers
the very best tools to teach reading and writing. Mississippi will
be the first state in the country _ to our knowledge _ to have such
an extensive computer literacy system for its children,'' he said.
   Riordon said his foundation has provided for similar computer
learning systems in several California cities, and in Kansas City,
Mo., Chicago and New York, but said most of those were pilot
projects.
   He said this was the foundation's first statewide effort.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Collective Farm Directors Wary of Land Leasing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Collective farm directors are wary and confused
about new laws permitting them to lease land, but most see the move
toward private property as the only way to increase production,
according to a survey published Tuesday.
   Of the 176 heads of collective farms questioned by the Kursk
Agricultural Institute, only one-fifth believed strongly in leasing
and nearly half answered, ``I have doubts about it, but I just
don't see any other way.''
   Results were published in the Communist Party daily newspaper
Pravda.
   ``The conviction is widespread that the attitude toward leasing
could flip by 180 degrees one fine moment _ and goodbye to the
valuables attained through sweat and blood,'' wrote Y. Vorobyov,
dean of the institute in Kursk, a southwestern Russian city.
   One-fifth of the farmers believed leasing would only make things
worse, and 7 percent ``consider the situation so far gone that they
don't see any way out of it'' Pravda said.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told party leaders last month
they must give farmers a feeling they are masters of the land
because billions of dollars worth of investment brought only
marginal increases in harvest.
   On April 9, a new decree was published giving Soviet citizens
sweeping rights to lease land for 50 or more years, pass it on to
their children and sub-lease it. The decree created property rights
that had been virtually non-existent under 70 years of communism.
   The leasing decree's success in bringing economic improvement is
expected to depend on the bureaucrats who have the power to enact
the reforms or block them.
   Asked about the main obstacles to leasing, 38 percent of the
survey's respondents cited farmers' reluctance to undertake a new
enterprise; 34 percent pointed to farm specialists' disbelief that
the leasing would really be ``serious and long-term''; and 22
percent cited ``unclear ideas'' among farm leaders themselves about
what leasing meant.
   In all, however, almost two-thirds saw leasing as a positive
phenomenon, Pravda reported.
   Vorobyov wrote that two years ago, a similar survey asked more
than 500 farm specialists if they planned to lease land, and 25
percent gave a ``categorical no'' while only 10 percent said they
did.
   ``We have been taught by the bitter experience of the past,''
Pravda said, referring to the collectivization period of the 1930s
when millions of peasants were forced to give up their land to
collective farms.

<TEXT>
   Tamil rebels chose a Sri Lankan-born
British national to set up peace talks with the government aimed at
ending their 6-year-old war for a homeland, officials and rebel
sources said Tuesday.
   Anton Balasingham, head of the political section of the largest
Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, will set
the date and place for the talks, and participate in the
negotiating team, according to rebel sources.
   Evans Cooray, press secretary to President Ranasinghe Premadasa,
said the government had been notified Balasingham was designated to
make arrangements for the talks.
   On Saturday, Tamil rebels accepted an invitation by Premadasa
for meetings on ending the ethnic violence that has claimed more
than 12,600 lives since 1983. The announcement came after they were
blamed for three days of bombings that killed 79 people.
   Premadasa extended the offer to the radical Sinhalese People's
Liberation Front, which has not responded to the president's call.
   The Front launched a violent campaign against the government,
saying it was making too many concessions to the Tamils. They have
been blamed for more than 2,500 killings since January.
   Sinhalese extremists killed six people late Monday in separate
attacks in Southern Sri Lanka, an official said on condition of
anonymity. Victims included a soldier, a policeman and his brother,
the official said.
   Tamil militants have been fighting since 1983 for a separate
homeland they propose to carve out of the northern and northeastern
provinces, where most Tamils live.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, comprise 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people. They say they are discriminated against
in jobs and education by the majority Sinhalese.
   Sri Lanka's government and military has been dominated by the
Sinhalese since the island, formerly called Ceylon, became
independent from Britain in 1948. Mostly Buddhists, they make up 75
percent of the population.

   The nation has been coming back slowly from
last summer's drought, but conditions are improving, government
reports showed Tuesday.
   Streamflows increased in March for most of the nation, the U.S.
Geological Survey reported, although below normal rates persisted
in the Northeast, a portion of the Southeast and part of the wheat
belt.
   Overall, about 30 percent of the nation was still classified as
in severe or extreme drought at the end of March, compared to 33
percent in February and a high of about 40 percent last August, the
National Climatic Data Center reported.
   Only nine times in this century has drought been more widespread
in March, according to the center, a division of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Those years were 1902,
1934-35, 1940, 1954-55-56-57 and 1977.
   The Northeast has emerged as a major water problem area, with
the Delaware River basin hovering near the drought emergency level,
the Geological Survey reported.
   Rainfall this month has helped push water levels in the basin
above the emergency mark, the agency said, but not by a wide margin.
   The Delaware River was measured at only 2.4 billion gallons per
day in March, 61 percent below normal and the second lowest level
since 1940.
   In the Northeast, below-normal streamflows were reported in
Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey
and northern Ohio.
   The St. Lawrence River, one of the nation's largest, averaged 12
percent below normal for the month at 142 billion gallons per day.
   The survey also noted that flows were below normal in most of
Georgia, northern Florida and southern South Carolina.
   To the west, below-normal water flows were recorded in most of
Kansas and in parts of Wyoming, Nebraska, Missouri and North Dakota.
   On a national level, 45 river-measuing stations reported
below-normal rates while flows were above normal at 35 locations
and near normal at 99 places last month, the survey said.
   The Mississippi River _ which fell so low that barge traffic was
disrupted last summer _ was measured at 793 billion gallons a day
in March, 50 percent more than normal.
   Among the Mississippi's major tributaries, the Ohio averaged a
normal 161 billion gallons per day, while the Missouri was 28
percent below normal with a flow of 34 billion gallons per day.
   The Geological Survey reported that the Columbia River was 16
percent above normal at 92 billion gallons per day for the month.
   Other regions reporting above-normal streamflows for the month
included most of Oregon; northern Nevada and California; parts of
Colorado and New Mexico; northern and western Texas; Delaware and
the easternmost portions of Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina.

   Fort Benning authorities have reprimanded
27 officers and non-commissioned officers for physically abusing
Army trainees by ordering too much exercise, a spokesman said.
   The 27 face varying punishments including relief from duty,
formal reprimand, forfeiture of pay, demotion, confinement and
extra duty, Lt. Col. McDonald Plummer said this week.
   The 39 trainees from C and D companies of the 3rd Battalion,
32nd Infantry Regiment, were hospitalized in mid-February,
complaining of soreness and muscle swelling. All but two returned
to training. One is being treated for kidney malfunction at Walter
Reed Memorial Hospital and the other is out of the hospital.
   A new Army directive requires drill sergeants to ease up on
running and high-impact workouts during part of basic training. The
directive affects Fort Benning and the Army's other seven
basic-training posts.

   A prisoner who has been on death row for 29
years, longer than anyone in the United States, is recovering from
heart bypass surgery paid for by the state, officials said.
   ``People could criticize, but our policy has been to correct any
medical problem that would cause a man's health to deteriorate,''
said William Seabold, warden of the Kentucky State Penitentiary
near Eddyville. ``We weren't going to not do it just because he's
74 and on death row.''
   Henry Anderson underwent surgery last week at Western Baptist
Hospital in Paducah, where he was listed in stable condition and
was under 24-hour guard.
   Seabold said the state has not received a bill but acknowledged
it will be ``extremely high.'' The hospital would not disclose the
bill.
   Anderson, convicted of murder in the 1958 shooting of a doctor
who diagnosed him as mentally ill, had his appeal put on hold in
1962 and he refused to plead guilty to have his sentence commuted
to life.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Justices Deluged with Abortion Mail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans in record numbers are writing and
telephoning the Supreme Court to express their views on abortion,
but a court spokeswoman says it's all to no avail.
   ``I hope they understand this is not a popularity contest. We
are not keeping score of who favors abortion and who does not,''
Toni House said about the tens of thousands of letters and hundreds
of telephone calls reaching the court each day.
   Ms. House, the court's public information officer, said, ``While
people have a right to write to the court I hope they do not expect
that the enunciation of their opinion will have any effect on the
justices.''
   The court is to hear arguments April 26 in a key abortion-rights
case from Missouri in which the justices are being asked to
overturn or substantially limit their landmark 1973decision
legalizing abortion.
   Ms. House said the volume of court mail and calls increased
dramatically when the justices last January agreed to study the
Missouri case, and that switchboard operators and mailroom
employees have been ``laboring against the rising tide'' since the
massive march on Washington by abortion rights advocates earlier
this month.
   In normal times, the court receives about 1,000 pieces of mail
daily. The court's mailroom was inundated with an estimated 46,000
letters Monday. Nearly 19,000 more arrived Tuesday.
   Some send more than letters. The court has received a number of
clothes hangers, grisly symbols of illegal abortions, and numerous
photographs of aborted fetuses.
   ``People should understand the difference between this branch of
government and the legislative and executive branches, where public
feedback is part and parcel of what they do,'' Ms. House said.
``This is not like writing to a member of Congress. It's
ineffective.''
   Nevertheless, Ms. House's willingness to talk about the public
outpouring likely indicates that it has not gone unnoticed by at
least some of the justices.
   Mail addressed to a particular justice is delivered to his or
her chambers. It is not known how many of the justices actually
read any of the letters.
   ``As best I can tell, most of them do not,'' Ms. House said.
   Most callers do not get beyond the court's switchboard
operators, although some end up talking to Ms. House or her
assistants. Virtually none reaches a justice's chambers.
   In a speech in Seattle last weekend, Justice Harry A. Blackmun
said he is receiving ``voluminous'' mail about abortion, and
indicated he is reading at least some of it.
   The author of the court's 1973 ruling in Roe vs. Wade, Blackmun
said some writers have branded him ``morally rotten'' and
``responsible for the deaths of more babies than anyone in the
world.''
   Blackmun has received thousands of such letters for years, and
has told some at the court that he has developed a tolerance to
abusive language.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, viewed as a pivotal vote, is
receiving more abortion-related mail than any other member of the
court, Ms. House said.
   ``Much of the mail appears to be orchestrated. A great deal of
it is pre-printed and is merely signed by the mailer,'' Ms. House
said. ``That's true on both sides of the issue.''

<TEXT>
   The massive Exxon oil spill in Alaska's Prince
William Sound has blackened the image of the entire oil industry
and thrust it into ``a pivotal time in its history,'' Energy
Secretary James D. Watkins said Tuesday.
   ``Every oil company will have to confront the images created by
the spill,'' Watkins said in a speech to the National Petroleum
Council, a group of private energy officials that advises the
energy secretary on policy issues.
   Watkins said his department would attempt to persuade Congress
and the general public that the March 24 spill of 10 million
gallons of Alaskan crude by the tanker Exxon Valdez was an
aberration that should not halt oil development in Alaska.
   ``We're going to talk about the track record of the industry _
6{ billion barrels of crude shipped out of Valdez in a dozen years
on nearly 9,000 tankers with virtually no environmental damage _
until now,'' Watkins said.
   He stressed, however, that the enormity of the Exxon spill had
galvanized public opinion in a way that evolving problems, such as
U.S. reliance on foreign oil, could not.
   ``Obviously, the oil industry has suddenly and tragically
reached a pivotal time in its history,'' Watkins said, adding that
it would require efforts by the entire industry to recover from
public relations damage caused by the Valdez spill.
   Watkins said his department would continue to lobby for
legislation permitting oil companies to explore for oil in the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. A Senate bill offering such
authorization was approved by the Energy and Natural Resources
Committee in early March but was put on hold after the Exxon spill.
   ``We're going to ... attempt to break the linkage that I'm
afraid is developing in the public's mind that the Valdez incident
means that we no longer can risk new development on the North
Slope,'' Watkins said.
   Watkins said pursuit of possible oil discoveries in the Arctic
refuge was justified as a means of limiting the nation's growing
dependence on imported oil.
   ``Our vulnerability to oil supply disruptions is greater today
than it was at the time of the Arab oil embargo (and) becoming more
apparent to the American public as we approach and perhaps pass the
50 percent oil import mark,'' he said.

<HEAD>Afghan Forces Reopen Supply Route to Kabul</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Government forces reopened Kabul's
main overland supply route that had been blocked by Moslem
guerrillas, and a convoy of 1,300 trucks and other vehicles resumed
its journey toward the capital Tuesday, officials said.
   In the battle for the eastern city of Jalalabad, the guerrillas
launched another assault, attacking it from four directions, said
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani.
   Foreign journalists saw about 200 trucks from the convoy reach a
government checkpoint on the Salang Highway just north of the
capital Tuesday. Amani said more would arrive throughout the night
and Wednesday.
   He said the convoy, which was blocked for more than a week,
began moving again after the government soldiers dislodged the
U.S.-backed guerrillas from two posts on the highway.
   Helicopter gunships provided air cover for the convoy, which
included a few crowded buses and taxis. Gunfire was heard as the
vehicles moved south, but truck drivers said it was not serious.
   Government troops in armored personnel carriers waved their caps
and cheered as they saw the convoy's vehicles approach the capital.
   After the departure of Soviet troops in February, Soviet
supplies continued to move down the 260-mile Salang Highway until
the guerrillas blocked it on April 6.
   The government on Tuesday sent a separate convoy of about 105
trucks from Kabul to Jalalabad, about 75 miles to the east, Amani
said. He said he believed the vehicles had reached the city.
   However, some guards at a checkpoint about 10 miles east of
Kabul said the road was closed. Others said it was open most of the
way.
   That road has been blocked for more than two weeks by
Pakistani-based guerrillas who have been attacking Jalalabad since
March 6.
   Amani said 18 civilians were killed and 21 wounded in the
Jalalabad fighting. Two government soldiers were killed and five
injured, while 47 guerrillas died and 19 were injured, he said.
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas have made Jalalabad the target of
their first major offensive since the departure of the Soviet
troops, who had been helping the Marxist government.
   Amani also reported 32 guerrillas killed in battles to the south.
   There was no way to confirm those reports independently.
   In other fighting, guerrillas attacked a district near the
southern city of Khost, Amani said. He said no civilians or
government troops were killed but 18 guerrillas died.
   Government forces also battled guerrillas in the southern
province of Kandahar, killing 14 and wounding 40, Amani said.

<TEXT>
   NASA rolled out a full-scale model of
its next generation space shuttle for public viewing Tuesday, with
hopes it will impress those holding the purse strings for the
nation's space program.
   The 115-foot mockup of the planned Shuttle-C, an unmanned,
cargo-carrying space shuttle, was put together in a hanger at
Marshall Space Flight Center for about $500,000.
   The model will be shown to visiting congressman and other VIPs,
and is expected to become part of bus tours through Marshall
operated by the Alabama Space and Rocket Center.
   It might also travel to NASA's Kennedy Space Center so
technicians can practice handling future space shuttle vehicles.
   ``It's more than just something to look at; it's a design tool
that our engineers will use in deciding how systems they're working
on will fit in full scale and how they would be used and ultimately
how we would handle something like Shuttle-C,'' said Larry Russell,
a Marshall engineer.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration hopes to get
the first funds for a $1.5 billion Shuttle-C development program in
its fiscal 1991 budget, with the program managed through Marshall.
   The center is responsible for development and management of the
space shuttle fleet's main engines, booster rockets and external
fuel tanks.
   As proposed by Marshall engineers, Shuttle-C would be a wingless
version of the existing space shuttles, using the same propulsion
systems, two shuttle main engines, external fuel tank and two solid
fuel booster rockets.
   Shuttle-C would weigh about 75,000 pounds empty, less than half
the weight of the 174,000-pound manned orbiters. It could carry
payloads in its 16-by-82-foot cargo bay as heavy as 145,000 pounds,
three times the weight current shuttles can lift.
   Unlike its manned counterparts, however, Shuttle-C could not be
reused and would be discarded like old booster rockets.
   ``We need a heavy lift vehicle to get major pieces of the space
station into orbit, and we think Shuttle-C is what we need,'' said
J.R. Thompson, Marshall director and deputy NASA
administrator-designate.
   NASA could fly a working version of Shuttle-C by 1994 if
congressional funding begins next year, Russell said.

   Robert H. Bork, still stinging from the
Senate's rejection of his nomination to the Supreme Court two years
ago, says he was the victim of liberals who are trying to take
control of the nation's laws and culture.
   The former federal appeals court judge said Monday that the
political blood-letting continues to infect Contress and is a
mounting threat to President Bush.
   ``The members of the '60s generation have reached middle age,
and they have brought their ideological baggage with them,'' Bork
told the Economic Club of Indianapolis.
   He says liberals are trying to manipulate judicial and executive
branches of the government to change the American way of life.
   ``These folks want to run the presidency from Capitol Hill, and
they want to have the Supreme Court enact the laws that Capitol
Hill does not dare,'' Bork said.
   ``The fact is that our political parties have grown increasingly
polarized, and the mood in Washington right now, I think, is little
short of poisonous,'' he said.

   An 80-year-old reputed former Mafia boss
was shot to death Tuesday as he drove his car outside Palermo,
police said.
   Antonino Mineo was a top Mafia figure in the 1960s, according to
Tommaso Buscetta, a former mob member turned informer whose 1986
testimony led to the trial of hundreds of alleged Mafia members.
Mineo was acquitted in 1987 for lack of sufficient evidence.
   Investigators told the AGI news agency that the slaying near
Bagheria was probably linked to Mafia killings in the area in
recent days.
   Police said Mineo appeared to have been shot by two gunmen. No
witnesses came forward, the ANSA news agency said.
   According to Buscetta, Mineo was stripped of his Mafia
leadership in the mid-1970s because of his age.

   South Korea announced Tuesday it will
create a youth volunteer corps to offer technical assistance to
less developed countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
   The Korean Young Volunteers is patterned after the U.S. Peace
Corps, said Lee Soo-jung, press secretary to President Roh Tae-woo.
   He said the government program will give youths experience in
international cooperation and allow South Korea to contribute to
less-developed nations.
   It has not been decided where the first group of volunteers will
go.
   In the latter half of 1990, the program will send abroad 50
young people, selected mainly from among college students, and 100
annually in succeeding years, Lee said.
   He said members of the service corps will receive five months of
training, and will be paid salaries and living allowances during
their two-year overseas tours.
   The volunteers will offer assistance in health and sanitation,
agricultural techniques, community development, sports and youth
activities, and education and cultural pursuits, Lee said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Tuesday the United States has extremely limited influence on the
warring factions in Lebanon and can do little through diplomatic or
political pressure to improve the situation.
   ``It is a great tragedy that is very, very intractable,'' Baker
told the Senate Foreign Relations Commitee. ``It does not lend
itself to an easy solution.''
   He said that for all practical purposes, the State Department is
limited to issuing statements strongly deploring the violence,
urging a ceasefire and calling for the withdrawal of Syrian forces
from the country.
   ``We make a lot of statements and sometimes it is frustrating to
think that is really about all we can do,'' Baker said. ``I don't
know what else, frankly, we can do. We have scant influence with
the Syrians.''
   Baker said President Bush discussed the Lebanon situation
earlier in the day with French President Francois Mitterrand, but
he did not elaborate.
   In Paris, presidential spokesman Hubert Vedrine said Mitterrand
had contacted Bush as well as British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and several other world leaders to solicit their help in
ending the war.
   Baker said that some people believe there ``ought to be somehow
some greater activity or action on the part of the United States,
either unilaterally or acting jointly with France.''
   ``We don't see the potential for that right now,'' he said.
   Responding to questions, Baker said that the United States is
urging international support for mediation efforts by the 21-nation
Arab League to bring a stop to fighting between Christian and
Moslem forces.
   ``It is our view that the initiative that has the greatest
chance of success is the initiative of the Arab League,'' Baker
said.
   Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum, R-Kan., asked if it would help
matters to call the U.S. ambassadors to Lebanon and Syria home for
consultation.
   ``I don't know how much a statement recalling ambassadors would
make,'' Baker replied.
   ``The situation in Lebanon remains a rebuke to everyone's hopes
for a restoration of stability and independence for that tragic
country,'' Baker said.
   Casualties from the fighting in Lebanon during the past six
weeks total at least 270 killed and 975 wounded.
   Syria maintains about 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab
League mandate.

   Rebel raids and the abduction of six
staff members forced the closure of a 300-bed hospital run by a
Roman Catholic mission in northern Uganda, a newspaper said Tuesday.
   Dr. Pierre Levi Cotti, the hospital director, said the facility
on the outskirts of Gulu, 280 miles north of Kampala, won't be
reopened until the government can guarantee security.
   Rebels seeking drugs have raided the hospital 12 times since
last year, according to the state-run New Vision newspaper.
   In March, they abducted the deputy director and five nurses from
the facility, which is run by the Italian Verona Fathers, the
newspaper said. All but one nurse were later released.
   Rebels of the Holy Spirit Movement, one of 10 insurgent groups
seeking to overthrow President Yoweri Museveni, have staged attacks
in the Gulu area in recent months.

<TEXT>
   Volkswagen of America Inc. and the United Auto
Workers agreed to settle a racial discrimination lawsuit for
$718,000 without admitting any of the allegations filed on behalf
of about 800 former employees.
   U.S. District Judge Gustave Diamond, who is presiding over the
6-year-old case, scheduled a June 13 hearing to consider approving
the settlement.
   Under terms agreed to March 24, the American subsidiary of the
German auto company would pay $670,000, and the union would pay
$48,000, said Tom McDonald, VW spokesman in Troy, Mich.
   The defendants settled to avoid the costs of further litigation.
   ``It's also our intention to make sure that the reputation of
Volkswagen remains as high as it was when we were making cars in
Westmoreland County,'' McDonald said. The company referrred to the
plant, which has subsequently been closed, as VW-Westmoreland.
   ``This is not an admission of guilt on VW's part or the UAW's
part,'' said McDonald.
   Volkswagen also agreed to pay $250,000 in lawyers' fees.
   The class-action lawsuit was filed in 1983 by black workers who
claimed they were victims of harassment and racially motivated
firings by company management and that the union failed to provide
protection.
   Volkswagen closed its lone U.S. assembly plant last year, citing
declining sales of its Golf and Jetta models.
   About 800 blacks could share the money if they accept the
settlement terms. Individual payments would range from $70,000 to a
supervisor who said he was harassed on the job to $200 for hourly
workers who were fired before their 90-day probations expired.
   The plaintiffs had sought $70 million.

<TEXT>
   Burmese government troops shelled
and seized an important base of Karen insurgents Tuesday, killing
10 students who were defending the camp and wounding 12, sources
said.
   Sporadic shooting continued into the early afternoon, said a
Thai police officer, Col. Amphol Ngamchit.
   The camp, the third important rebel base seized in five months,
is in Burma's southeastern Karen State, near the border with
Thailand.
   The students killed in the attack joined the rebels after
September's military coup in Burma and subsequent crackdown on
student-led dissent. Amphol said other students and rebels at the
camp fled to a region 19 miles to the southeast.
   Col. Thepho Trichana, superintendant of the Thai border patrol
police in the area, said some shells strayed into Thai territory
from Tuesday's fighting, destroying three houses and a school
cafeteria. The area had been evacuated and no one was injured, he
said.
   Government forces began the offensive against Htee Ger Nee two
weeks ago, Amphol said.
   Last month, troops seized the longtime Karen stronghold of Maw
Poh Kay. They seized two other bases near the Thai border in
January and December.
   Burmese troops have been fighting the Karen National Union and a
dozen other minority groups since shortly after the country
achieved independence from Great Britain four decades ago. The
Karens, an ethnic minority, accuse the government of reneging on
promises of greater regional autonomy made at that time.
   Minorities make up about 30 percent of Burma's 38 million
people, who are predominantly Buddhist.

<HEAD>Bush's Choice of Atwood for No. 2 at Pentagon Approved by Senate
Panel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Armed Services Committee voted
unanimously Tuesday to recommend that the Senate confirm President
Bush's choice of General Motors executive Donald Atwood to become
deputy defense secretary.
   By 20-0, the committee approved Bush's nomination of the
automaker's vice chairman to take over the No. 2 civilian pos at
the Pentagon.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the committee, expressed hope
that the full Senate would vote on the nomination either Wednesday
or Thursday.
   During his confirmation hearing, Atwood promised to sell his
more than $3 million in company stock to avoid any conflict of
interest. He also said he took out an insurance policy to guarantee
his GM pension should the company fail, to protect against any
suggestion he would use his government office to protect the
company for the sake of a pension.
   Atwood, 64, owns about $1.4 million in restricted GM stock
options and about $1.2 million in Class E common stock as well as
other types of common stock estimated at over $750,000, documents
show.
   In addition, Atwood owns from $5,000 to $15,000 in AT&amp;T stock
and from $50,000 to $100,000 in Exxon stock. Financial disclosure
forms only require listing a range of assets.

<HEAD>Soviet Says Fighting Should End</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The continuing turmoil in Afghanistan will
``tarnish the international atmosphere'' unless an end to the
fighting is found, a Washington-based Soviet diplomat said Tuesday.
   ``Everybody is going to lose,'' if the conflict continues, said
Oleg Derkovsky, counselor at the Soviet Embassy.
   Derkovsky, in a meeting with a group of reporters, repeated
Soviet charges that Pakistan has violated the U.N.-mediated Geneva
Accord which oversaw the withdrawal of Soviet troops from
Afghanistan on Feb. 15.
   In recent weeks, the Soviets have repeatedly accused Pakistan of
interfering in Afghanistan by supporting Moslem guerrillas in their
decade-long fight to topple Kabul's government.
   The Geneva accord calls for Pakistan and Afghanistan not to
interfere in each other's internal affairs. The United States and
Soviet Union are guarantors of the pact, which was signed last year.
   But the United States has vowed to continue to support the
rebels as long as Moscow continues to ship munitions to the Kabul.
The rebel leaders are based in Pakistan, which has funneled much of
the U.S. weaponry and support to the rebels over the years.
   Derkovsky called the conflict, in light of the Soviet pull-out,
``a civil war'' that will grow into a regional conflict.
   ``Regional conflicts tarnish the international atmosphere,'' the
diplomat said.
   He charged the United States with violating the spirit of the
accord and called the U.S. decision to send a special ambassador to
the rebel factions ``not a helpful step.''
   The Soviet official, who questioned the U.S. policy of not
recognizing the Kabul regime, said the act ``confuses the
situation'' because the official would not be dealing with a
recognized government.
   The official's statement came a day after U.S. Ambassador Thomas
R. Pickering said the pro-Soviet Afghan government has turned to
the United Nations Security Council in a bid ``to retain its waning
grip on Afghanistan.''
   The ambassadors of Cuba, East Germany and Mongolia had called
Monday for a U.N.-arranged cease-fire and an international
conference to set up a coalition government in Afghanistan.
   The new U.S. ambassador accused Kabul of trying to involve other
nations in its struggle for political survival.
   ``The Afghan people themselves must be allowed to determine
their own future, without outside interference or coercion,''
Pickering told the council.

<HEAD>Repeal of Program Introduced</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of House Republicans introduced
legislation Tuesday to repeal parts of the catastrophic health
expansion of Medicare passed last year _ mainly the income tax
surcharge imposed on the well-to-do elderly to help finance the
program.
   The measure, unveiled at a news conference, would keep most of
the major benefits of the program, but revamp a prescription drug
benefit and make its more generous provisions apply only to
low-income Medicare beneficiaries not poor enough to qualify for
Medicaid.
   However, the measure passed by overwhelming margins with
bipartisan support in both the House and Senate last year _ despite
vocal opposition from those opposed to the surcharge feature _ and
was signed into law by then-President Reagan with great fanfare.
   That surcharge that has provoked a barrage of letters to members
of Congress even though it does not apply not apply at all to any
of the estimated 60 percent of the 32 million Medicare
beneficiaries who do not have enough income to pay federal taxes.
   Of the 40 percent subject to the surcharge, only those couples
with annual incomes of $100,000 or so would be subject to the
maximum surcharge of $800 a person _ or $1,600 per couple _ that
frequently is cited as example of the additional burden placed on
the elderly to pay for the program.
   Rep. Michael Bilirakis, D-Fla., a lead sponsor of the
legislation, acknowledged in an interview that many of his own
constituents who have complained mistakenly believe they will be
subject to an income tax surcharge.
   Bilirakis and other sponsors also acknowledged that getting
their bill passed will be an uphill fight and that their first
hurdle will be to get a hearing for their legislation in the
Democratic-controlled House.
   But Bilirakis said he is hopeful the letters of complaint
reaching Capitol Hill will have the same impact as the outpouring
of opposition to a recent proposal for a congressional pay raise.
   On that issue, he said, ``They bombed us and bombed us and
bombed us and finally Congress bent.''
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Finance Committee
that has main jurisdiction over the issue in the Senate, has
already said he probably will schedule a hearing merely to air the
issues raised by opponents to the progressive financing nature of
the catastrophic health expansion.
   Bentsen expressed confidence that whatever support may be
emerging for redoing that portion of the bill will evaporate once
the large majority of Medicare beneficiaries not subject to the
surcharge realize they are likely to either see their own premium
payments go up or have benefits reduced.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel of Illinois, who signed on as a
cosponsor, said he reacted in response to ``so many people out
there who have raised their voices'' about costs of the Medicare
expansion.
   He said that, at the very least, discussion f the legislation
should drive home the point that ``there is no magic wand you can
wave here and have it all free.''

   The Tax Court turned thumbs down Tuesday on a
Minnesota undertaker who took a business tax deduction for $11,000
of expenses of wedding receptions for two daughters.
   William L. McReavy of Minneapolis and his wife, Kathleen,
claimed the receptions as an advertising-entertainment expense,
contending that 82 percent of the people invited were clients or
referral sources for his Washburn-McReavy Funeral Chapels, Inc.
   ``The personal element of the expenses for the McReavys'
daughters' weddings was so prominent that we believe that even a
person not versed in the tax law would know that the corporation
could not deduct them,'' the court held.
   The court was so unimpressed by the argument that it allowed the
Internal Revenue Service to add a negligence penalty to the
McReavys' bill.

   Four masked youths wearing Arab headdresses
broke into the home of a Palestinian woman accused of collaborating
with Israel and stabbed her to death Tuesday, Arab and Israeli
military reports said.
   Most stores and businesses in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip were closed by a general strike that halted public transport.
   Israeli troops in the occupied lands shot and wounded at least
30 Palestinians in clashes with stone-throwers Tuesday, Arab
hospital officials said. They said the ages of the wounded ranged
from 8 to 52.
   At least 439 Palestinians have been killed in the 16-month-old
uprising against Israeli occupation, and 18 Israelis have been
slain.
   Eighteen of Tuesday's casualties were reported in Gaza's Khan
Yunis refugee camp. Doctors said 18-year-old Amir Ahmed Risik was
in critical condition with a bullet in the chest and was moved to a
hospital in Israel.
   Arab reporters said the trouble in Khan Yunis began with
stone-throwing in the morning in which 10 people were wounded. In
the afternoon, they said, camp residents marched to the home of a
youth killed earlier in the week and more clashes occurred.
   An army official confirmed the death but provided no details.
   Another casualty was a 14-year-old Arab boy shot on the
outskirts of Jerusalem when an Israeli garbage truck driver opened
fire on youths who stoned his vehicle, the army said. The shooting
occurred in Azariye, the Arabic name for biblical Bethany.
   Doctors at Mukassed Hospital said he had a critical head wound.
   Jerusalem police closed three private schools established to
tutor students from the occupied lands whose universities have been
closed by Israeli military authorities, Israel radio reported.
   The schools, run by teachers from West Bank's Bir Zeit and
Bethlehem universities, were discovered after an Arab youth from
Gaza was detained in Jerusalem and told police about them, the
radio said.
   It said police were trying to determine whether other such
schools had been started to to circumvent the university closing.
Jerusalem police spokesmen were not available for comment.
   All Arab universities were closed in January 1988, soon after
the uprising began, on grounds they were focal points of the revolt.
   On Monday, six Palestinians died, including two teen-agers said
to have been shot by soldiers during funeral marches that turned
into anti-Israeli protests.
   The army Tuesday denied one of the teen-agers, Rafideh Khalili
Ahmad Abu Laban, 13, was a victim of army gunfire.
   ``She was not killed during the clash between soldiers and local
residents,'' an army spokesman, adding that the investigation
continued but was hampered by the parents' refusal to allow an
autopsy.
   Witnesses in the Dheishe refugee camp said the girl was watching
a funeral march from a nearby hillside when she was struck in the
forehead by a bullet apparently fired by soldiers.
   Arabs identified the victim of the stabbing Tuesday as Nadira
Boulus, 43, of Nablus on the West Bank. She was dead on arrival at
nearby Rafidiyeh hospital, doctors said.
   An army spokesman confirmed the death.
   Arab reports said Ms. Boulus suffered multiple stab wounds from
four attackers masked with kaffiyeh headdresses. Supporters of the
attackers ringed the house during the killing.
   The reports said Ms. Boulus previously was beaten by Palestinian
activists who accused her of collaborating with Israel.
   Arabs have killed more than 65 of the Palestinians who died in
the uprising, accusing them of helping Israeli authorities.
   In Israel, police detained three Palestinians in connection with
a fire that destroyed 70 trees near Jerusalem in a forest named for
the late President John F. Kennedy.
   The fire was put out, said police spokesman Uzi Sandori.
   Last summer, thousands of acres of trees were burned in Israel.
Authorities blamed Palestinians after uprising leaders urged such
attacks.

<TEXT>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
Tuesday delayed a vote on the nomination of John Negroponte to be
ambassador to Mexico because of questions raised about his part in
the Iran-Contra affair.
   The panel also voted to postpone a vote on the nomination of
Joseph Verner Reed as Chief of Protocol for the White House.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., blocked the vote because Reed wrote a
letter last year to former Secretary of State George Shultz asking
that PLO chief Yasser Arafat be allowed to address the United
Nations, said a congressional source. Reed wrote the letter in his
capacity as a U.N. undersecretary after Shultz denied Arafat a visa
to come to New York.
   Three ambassadors were approved by the panel, including Michael
Armacost as ambassador to Japan, James Lilley as ambassador to
China and Terence A. Todman as ambassador to Argentina. The
nominations must now be approved by the full Senate.
   Postponement of the a vote on Negroponte was requested by Sen.
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., the chairman so he could review classified
answers provided by the nominee late Monday regarding his role in
the plane to aid the anti-Nicaraguan Contras, said the source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The committee had asked Negroponte to explain the messages he
conveyed to the Honduran goverment in 1985 when he served there as
ambassador. The message involved continued support for the Contras
at a time when Congress had banned U.S. military aid to the rebels.
   Negroponte denied at his confirmation hearing that the message
he was asked to relay offered Honduras accelerated U.S. economic
and military aid in return for its support of the Contras.
Documents which have surfaced at the trial of former White House
aide Oliver North suggest such a quid pro quo may have been offered
to the Hondurans by George Bush when he served as vice president.
   But Negroponte, who was present at Bush's meeting with Honduran
President Roberto Suazo in March 1985, has denied there was any
talk of a swap.

   Oliver North was portrayed to his trial jury
Tuesday as a liar who couldn't stop, and as ``the Joe Isuzu of
government'' who followed Hitler's maxim that ``the victor will
never be asked if he told the truth.''
   Said prosecutor John Keker, in final arguments at North's trial:
``If Ollie North wanted to get it done, he didn't care if he broke
the law.''
   But, in return, defense lawyer Brendan Sullivan said anyone
``who links Colonel North to Adolf Hitler is not credible and
should not be believed.'' He called the comparison outrageous.
   ``This man is not Adolf Hitler,'' Sullivan said, ``and he
doesn't do things like Adolf Hitler.''
   The defense lawyer was scornful of his opponents, saying
everything the government sees North as doing ``is through a dirty
glass.''
   Why shouldn't North have thrown papers away, he asked, when they
referred to the secret operations of the government.
   ``In this case,'' Sullivan told the jury, ``the government is
off track and running wild, and you should stop it.''
   North, the former National Security Council aide who was at the
center of the Iran-Contra vortex, sat stone-faced at the defense
table as prosecutor Keker methodically tried to dismantle his
American-hero image.
   ``Telling the truth is something you learned at your mother's
knee,'' Keker said. ``Government by deception is not a free
government. Government by deception is not a democratic government.
Government by deception is not a government under the rule of law.''
   After North's lawyer finishes his closing argument Wednesday,
there will be rebuttal and then the trial _ now in its 12th week _
will go to the jury, which will then be sequestered.
   Prosecutor Keker told the jurors Tuesday, ``I will be asking you
to return a verdict of guilty as to each of these 12 counts against
Oliver North.''
   He said, ``The tragedy of Oliver North is of a man who cared so
much for freedom in Nicaragua, but forgot about the demands of
freedom and democracy here at home.''
   If convicted on all counts, the maximum penalty for North could
be 60 years in prison.
   The charges include six counts of lying to Congress and
withholding information; obstructing a presidential inquiry and
making false statements to investigators; altering, shredding and
concealing documents; receiving an illegal gratuity, a security
system at his home; stealing money from a Iran-Contra account, and
conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service.
   The charges focus on an alleged attempt to cover up various
aspects of a secret Reagan administration operation to aid the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   Standing behind a portable lectern and using a huge chart that
outlined the charges, Keker contended that North, a highly
decorated former Marine officer and White House aide, had a defense
of ``the devil made me do it.''
   North ``blames other people. `McFarlane made me to it. Casey
told me to do it,''' the prosecutor said. Robert McFarlane was the
national security adviser at the time of some of the alleged
offenses and William Casey was CIA director.
   ``In time, a good man turned into a bad man,'' said Keker in a
low, unemotional voice. ``Once lying becomes a habit, it's hard to
stop. He put his hand on the Bible and swore to tell the truth.''
   He said when North was questioned in November 1986 by the
attorney general and aides about the diversion of Iranian arms
sales profits to the Contras, ``they thought he was telling the
truth.''
   But, said Keker, ``he was by this time the Joe Isuzu of
government.'' ``Isuzu'' is a character in an automobile television
commercial who tells lie upon lie.
   In August 1985, when two congressmen sent letters asking for
information about North's activities, McFarlane and North gave
false answers, Keker said. North said he supplied the answers at
McFarlane's direction.
   ``North and McFarlane were following Adolf Hitler's old
strategy, which is the victor will never be asked if he told the
truth,'' Keker said. ``If the lies work, Congress will stop asking
questions.''
   Keker said North ``did not hesitate'' to abuse his power by
saying, ``This is the White House calling,'' whether the call was
to Cabinet officials ``or a car dealer.''
   That reference was to testimony last week focusing on North's
purchase of a used $8,000 GMC Suburban. North told the jury that he
paid for the vehicle with cash he kept in a metal box at home. The
prosecutor suggested that Iran-Contra co-defendant Richard Secord
helped pay for it.
   ``He lied about that tin box because he knew that we knew that
he had paid cash for his car in October 1985 and he couldn't
explain how he got the cash for the car, so he made up a story
about the tin box,'' Keker charged.
   The Iran-Contra operational fund under North's control contained
as much as $300,000, Keker said. ``Not even a saint could avoid
being tempted by $300,000 in liquid, untraceable funds,' he added.
``And Oliver North is no saint.''
   The government noted that North's daughter got a horse for
$7,000 in September 1986 and intimated the money came from that
fund. But Sullivan said North sold one of the two houses he owned
in 1986, easing his money burdens.
   Sullivan painted North as a slighted hero.
   ``He faced machine gun fire like a wall of death,'' Sullivan
said. ``If you listen to the government, you'd believe Colonel
North went to work every day and decided what kind of crime to
commit in which meeting.''
   Speaking of Keker's Hitler line, Sullivan told the jury, ``It is
outrageous. It should send a course of rage through all of you.''
   Sullivan told the jurors that they stand between a citizen and a
government and ``in this case the government is off track, running
wild.''
   He said the case is ``the government blaming Ollie North for
everything.''
   ``Colonel North is about four rungs down'' in authority,
Sullivan said at one point.
   Dealing with the attorney general's questioning of North after
the Iran-Contra link became public, he asked, ``Why didn't he
(Edwin Meese III) go to the president. He's the one who gave the
authority for shipping missiles, who signed the finding
(authorizing the shipment). Why ask Ollie North, why not ask the
president?''

<HEAD>Bush Signs Package of Non-Military Aid to Contras</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday signed into law a
$49.8 million package of non-military aid to sustain the Contra
rebels until Nicaragua holds elections early next year.
   Bush reiterated his pledge to support a diplomatic solution in
Nicaragua and repeated his call for the Soviet Union to advance the
peace process by ending its military aid to Nicaragua's leftist
government.
   ``The Soviet Union must match its rhetorical support for the
peace process with concrete action to halt military aid, to end
subversion in that region and to promote genuine democracy in
Nicaragua,'' Bush said.
   Administration officials have stated they want to see positive
action in that vein by the Soviet Union, and that it could result
in a more favorable economic or trade stance toward the Soviets by
the United States.
   Officials estimate the Soviet Union provides about $500 million
a year to Nicaragua in military aid and about the same amount in
economic aid.
   A top State Department official, meanwhile, said he had warned
the Contras that they risk a cutoff of the new aid unless they
expel a commander convicted of human rights abuses.
   ``Legally we would have the basis,'' to halt the aid, said Chris
Arcos, deputy assistant secretary of state.
   He said the Contra military tribunal last month had convicted a
commander known by the nom de guerre Commandante Mack, but that the
leader was seen in the Contra camps subsequent to the time he
should have been expelled.
   Arcos said he has been assured by the Contra leadership that
they expel those convicted of human rights abuses, but that he was
trying to find out if that had occurred with Commandante Mack.
   In brief remarks in a Rose Garden ceremony before he signed the
compromise legislation his administration worked out with Congress,
Bush threw the ball to Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
   ``The success of the Central American peace process and the
prospects of national reconciliation in Nicaragua depend on full
and honest Sandinista compliance with their repeated pledges of
democracy and freedom.''
   ``It's clear that close international scrutiny and sustained
pressure will be critical to induce Sandinista compliance.''
   The new aid package was worked out on March 24 after lengthy
negotiations between administration officials and congresssional
leaders.
   Bush was joined at the signing by Democratic and Republican
leaders of the House and Senate.
   The compromise represented a major breakthrough in U.S. policy
toward Central America, following years of conflicting actions.
Bush's agreement to forgo military aid in favor of a diplomatic
approach was a break with the Reagan administration's unrelenting
push for military support for the rebels.
   The package calls for humanitarian assistance to provide
non-lethal aid to the rebels until the Nicaraguan elections
scheduled for next February.
   The money also could be used to repatriate the Contras under
conditions considered politically acceptable for their return.
   The Bush administration is pushing for establishment of
democratic reforms by the Sandinistas as part of those conditions.
   ``We've yet to see genuine Sandinista compliance,'' Bush said
Tuesday. ``Thus far, they've refused to negotiate with the
opposition regarding the necessary conditions for fair elections,''
he added.
   The aid money will go through the State Department's Agency for
International Development program, cutting out any involvment by
the CIA, which has sometimes posed a sticking point in past
congressional debates on the Contra issue.
   The package also includes $4.2 million, through AID to be
administered by the Catholic Church in Nicaragua, in medical
assistance for civilian victims of the civil war.
   The Contras, an army estimated at about 11,000 fighters, are
encamped along the Honduran border. Although the military aid
needed to keep them at war has been discontinued by Congress, they
have been kept alive with U.S. food and humanitarian assistance.

   Soviet troops in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi
are being replaced by civilian volunteers to maintain order after
violent clashes between soldiers and demonstrators, the official
Tass news agency said Tuesday.
   A doctor who treated victims of the April 9 clashes, in which at
least 19 people died, told a meeting of the Georgian Academy of
Sciences Friday that troops used poison gas when they dispersed the
demonstration in front of the central government building. A
videotape of the meeting was shown to journalists in Moscow Tuesday
night.
   A midnight to 5 a.m. curfew was lifted Tuesday morning, and the
staged withdrawal of troops began, Tass said.
   ``Tanks and armored personnel carriers have vanished from city
streets, and armed patrols are no longer in sight,'' the news
agency said. ``They have been replaced by volunteers acting in
close contact with the police force.''
   The evening newspaper Izvestia said the streets of Tbilisi were
being patrolled by 4,000 volunteer workers and 750 policemen.
``They took upon themselves the responsibility for securing order
in the city,'' it said.
   Troops and tanks moved into Tbilisi on April 7 after three days
of pro-independence rallies. Early on the morning of April 9,
soldiers moved to clear the downtown of demonstrators in the deadly
clash, and authorities imposed a curfew from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, a former first
secretary of the Georgian Communist Party, who has been in Tbilisi
nine days in a personal attempt to restore calm, left on Tuesday,
according to Soviet television. Fellow Politburo member Georgy P.
Razumovsky accompanied Shevardnadze back to Moscow.
   At Friday's meeting of the Academy of Sciences, Shevardnadze
said he had met with nationalist leaders, workers and factory
bosses. He promised that if they could keep the city calm and make
sure workers showed up Monday morning, he would have the troops
withdrawn and the curfew lifted.
   The videotape showed Shevardnadze listening passively as about a
dozen members of the academy lambasted the local government for the
way it handled the demonstration. They charged that soldiers used
spades to brutally beat protesters, and chased them for blocks
after they were dispersed.
   Vakhtan Petriya, a physician who initially treated victims of
the clashes, said, ``Three persons taken in were poisoned by
aerosols.''
   He said soldiers used a nerve gas contained in canisters and
aerosol containers. ``We were at a loss on how to treat them,'' he
said. ``I don't know the compound used in the gas.'' Shevardnadze
did not respond.
   Another member of the academy, who did not identify himself when
he spoke, directed his remarks directly to Shevardnadze. ``They
actually hurt people by using sharp spades and knives,'' he said.
``I would like to tell you about that bluntly, Eduard.''
   One speaker described how soldiers, after dispersing the
protesters, chased a young girl for several blocks, then up two
flights of stairs in the Intourist Hotel, where she was beaten.
   Other speakers accused the government of attempting to use the
media to cover up the actions of soldiers during the clashes. ``Our
mass media, especially television, produced programs that were
incompetent,'' said a teacher of literature at Tbilisi University,
who did not give his name.
   ``A half-truth is worse than a falsehood,'' he said. ``This
causes speculation. This is a knife in the back of perestroika and
democratization.''
   When Shevardnadze addressed the academy, he made no attempt to
rebut the allegations of brutality and use of gas to disperse the
protesters, charges made last week by residents in telephone
interviews with Western reporters.
   Instead, he urged Georgians not to let the events of April 9
stand in the way of restructuring the country. He said they should
``develop perestroika without bloodshed and barricades.''
   In response to a question from the audience, he said the order
to deploy troops against the demonstrators came from the local
Communist Party leadership and not from President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   ``If that was true, I would not be standing before you now,'' he
said, adding that he was sent to Georgia by Gorbachev to calm the
situation.
   Shevardnadze denied there was censorship or attempts to muzzle
the Soviet press in covering the 10 days of military patrols and
curfew. Foreign journalists have been barred from traveling to
Tbilisi and the Soviet national press has offered little
information on the clash itself.

<HEAD>East-West Information Flow Still Impeded, Says West</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher opened a
35-nation conference on press freedom and the flow of information
between East and West Tuesday by declaring that Europe will stay
divided until all its peoples ``can mingle and talk freely.''
   In her address, Mrs. Thatcher defended her controversial ban
last year on British radio and television interviews with members
of the Irish Republican Army as an anti-terrorist measure.
   But she said Britain could not ban ``The Satanic Verses,'' a
novel that many Moslems regard as blasphemous, because the British
author, Salman Rushdie, ``broke none of our laws.''
   Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez-Ordonez of Spain spoke on
behalf of the European Community.
   He said that despite 14 years of negotiations between Western
and Communist countries, ``anachronistic but real obstacles'' still
impede the flow of information and ``working conditions for
journalists are still not what they ought to be.''
   The monthlong conference, called the Information Forum, is an
offshoot of the East-West Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe. That conference ended this year in Vienna with the 35
participating nations promising to improve the flow of information,
including pledging greater freedom for their national media and for
foreign correspondents.
   The Vienna conference was the second stage of negotiations that
began in Helskini in the 1970s.
   Nations taking part include every European country, except
Albania; the United States and Canada.
   East Germany, the only communist country to speak at the
conference Tuesday, accused unspecified Western journalists and
news organizations of spreading ``disinformation.''
   ``Only information the truth of which is established, rather
than speculation, is spread (in East Germany),'' said the
delegation chief, Ambassador Hans Voss.
   ``News agency reports of doubtful content or dubious origins
have no place in the media of the German Democratic Republic.'
   As Mrs. Thatcher opened the conference, her officials announced
she will visit the Soviet Union next year. Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev visited Britain this month.
   ``He (Gorbachev) told us of the progress of perestroika
(restructuring) in the Soviet Union,'' said Mrs. Thatcher. ``We
welcome and support his reforms, as well as the remarkable
political change taking place in Poland and Hungary.''
   There is still a way to go, she said, adding, ``There will only
be a common European home if the occupants can mingle and talk
freely.''
   She said the Vienna talks had estalished the principle that
``any country is entitled to enquire about, check and question the
policies of others in the field of human rights and freedoms.''
   ``The commitments ... are not on a pick and choose basis. Trust
is impossible when the promises we make to each other as well as to
our own peoples are broken.''

   ``The death was from the combined effects of phenobarbital and
alcohol,'' Rosko said at a news conference.
   Laboratory tests showed that two other drugs were present in
Hoffman's system, Rosko said, but he added they were in small
amounts and had no connection with Hoffman's death.
   Hoffman, a 1960s activist who held to his anti-establishment
convictions, was found dead April 12 at his home in New Hope. He
was 52. His body has been cremated.
   Phenobarbital is a long-acting sedative and an anticonvulsant.

   The timetable for removing South
African troops from Namibia will be abandoned unless all black
nationalist guerrillas withdraw to Angola soon, Foreign Minister
Pik Botha said Tuesday.
   Botha said the U.N. plan to bring independence to Namibia still
is on schedule, despite heavy fighting this month when guerrillas
of the South-West Africa People's Organization crossed into Namibia
from Angola.
   But the timetable will be disrupted if guerrillas still in the
territory do not leave by month's end, Botha said.
   South Africa claims 1,600 guerrillas entered Namibia, also known
as South-West Africa, after April 1 in violation of an agreement
they would remain in Angola at least until mid-May.
   According to South Africa, 278 guerrillas have been killed and
28 captured, about 380 have returned to Angola, and about 900
remain in Namibia. SWAPO says the numbers are much lower.
   Botha said his troops will not return to their bases or withdraw
to South Africa, as called for in the U.N. plan, until a total
SWAPO withdrawal is verified.
   South Africa does not disclose its troop strength in Namibia,
but it is supposed to have no more than 12,000 soldiers there by
May 14.
   In Windhoek, the Namibian capital, territorial officials said
U.N. personnel escorted three SWAPO guerrillas into Angola Tuesday.
The three were among only seven guerrillas who have turned
themselves in at U.N. assembly points to be sent to Angola. The
officials said the four others remained in Namibia.
   Tuesday's transfer was the first by U.N. forces since the
assembly points were established last week in northern Namibia.
   The territorial officials also reported a landmine explosion
damaged an army truck Monday in the northern Namibia. They said no
one was injured by the blast, which they blamed on SWAPO.
   At a news briefing, Botha expressed annoyance at reports that
security forces acted callously in disposing of bodies of slain
guerrillas. He said such reports diverted attention from SWAPO's
responsibility for the combat.
   Armed forces chief Gen. Jannie Geldenhuys said his troops had
firm instructions not to bury enemy bodies in mass graves. But he
said ``relatively inexperienced'' policemen did so when ``suddenly
confronted with large numbers of dead in blistering heat.''
   By Tuesday, only seven guerrillas had reported to U.N.
checkpoints established to give the insurgents safe passage back to
Angola. The others who have withdrawn did so on their own.
   South African, U.N. and local community officials have predicted
few guerrillas will venture near the assembly points because of
heavy concentrations of South African-led police and soldiers
around each area.
   U.N. police monitors are to be deployed in northern Namibia this
week, and their superiors have urged residents to report any
incidents of harassment or brutality. There have been numerous
allegations that security forces have been mistreating SWAPO
supporters.
   South Africa has ruled the mineral-rich territory since World
War I. In December, it agreed to allow independence in exchange for
Cuba withdrawing its estimated 50,000 troops from Angola.
   SWAPO has been fighting South African rule since 1966 and is
favored to win most votes in independence elections scheduled for
November.

   An explosion shook a North Sea oil rig Tuesday
night as it was being evacuated because of an oil leak. No
casualties were reported.
   A spokesman for Shell Expro, the owner of the Cormorant Alpha
rig, said 227 workers wer being evacuated because of the gas leak
and about 100 were still on the platform at the time of the
explosion.
   He said none of the workers was in in the immediate area where
the explosion occurred on a leg of the platform in the vicinity of
the gas leak, and there was no fire.
   The evacuation continued, but about 60 personnel considered to
be essential remained aboard the rig located 100 miles northeast of
Lerwick in Shetland, according to the spokesman, who was not
identified.
   The company reported earlier that gas was discovered leaking
from the rig after a plug was dislodged during installation
operations.
   Cormorant Alpha produces about 40,000 barrels of oil a day.

   The leaders of seven European nations joined
the heads of several world institutions Tuesday to celebrate the
independence of this tiny nation with a long history.
   During the festivities, the delegations from the Soviet Union,
West Germany, Britain, France, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands
also carried out a series of one-on-one discussions of East-West
relations and European unification, officials said.
   Prime Minister Franz Vranitzky of Austria met with Soviet
Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov and discussed Austria's plans to ask for
admission to the European Economic Community trade bloc, officials
said.
   Prime Minister Helmut Kohl of West Germany held an informal
meeting with Ryzhkov to talk about the visit of Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev in late spring.
   During the festivities, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar praised Luxembourg as ``one of the most stable and
prosperous countries in the world.''
   Luxembourg, with a population of about 370,000, was declared
independent 150 years ago after 400 years of foreign control. The
seven nations whose leaders were visiting Tuesday signed the Treaty
of London in 1839, making Luxembourg a Grand Duchy independent of
the Netherlands.
   Luxembourg's head of state, Grand Duke Jean, also hosted an
informal lunch Tuesday for the government leaders, EEC Commission
President Jacques Delors, NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner
and Perez de Cuellar.
   The smallest member of the EEC, Luxembourg borders West Germany,
France, and Belgium. Lying on a crossroads of the Roman and
Germanic cultures, its population speaks Luxembourgish, a German
dialect, in addition to French and German.
   It covers 998 square miles, less than the area of Rhode Island.

<HEAD>Capitol Statue to Be Restored</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The giant bronze statue of Freedom on top of
the Capitol dome is so badly deteriorated after 125 years that it
will be removed _ probably by helicopter _ brought to the ground
and restored, the architect of the Capitol said on Tuesday.
   Architect George White made the disclosure at a ceremony
launching a multi-million dollar fund raising effort to provide
private-sector dollars to finance restoration projects at the
Capitol and to create a fund to buy art works associated with its
past.
   White said the first projects will be the restoration of the
statue, formally titled ``Armed Freedom,'' and the installation of
marble fountains on the Capitol's East Plaza, ending its use as a
parking lot.
   He estimated the cost at $300,000 to $400,000 but said that the
paving of the entire plaza in patterned stone will likely cost more
than $6 million.
   The statue, which weighs 14,985 pounds, rises 19 feet six inches
from the top of the dome. It was hoisted into position and bolted
into place on Dec. 2, 1863.
   ``It hasn't been touched since,'' White said. ``When we had the
dome repainted last summer we confirmed that the statue is in vary
serious condition.
   He said that cracks had developed in some of the interior
fastenings of the statue and that an exterior piece of the staue's
flowing robes had fallen out. The statue consists of five separate
pieces of cast bronze bolted together and attached to a cast-iron
base.
   ``The whole thing is in really bad condition,'' White said.
``Bronze does deteriorate.''
   In preparation for removing the statue a protective cage will be
built around it, White said and added:
   ``We'll probably take it down by helicopter.''
   White estimated the cost of the project at $250,000 but added,
``It could cost a lot more, depending on how serious the damage is
when we get it down and are able to examine more closely.

<HEAD>Administration Wants to Keep Control of Visits by Communists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration told Congress on
Tuesday it wants to preserve the right to control entry to the
United States of anyone who was ever a Communist.
   The stance was spelled out in a letter to Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass, who has led a six-year fight to change the current law and
limit the power of the government to keep out visitors from abroad.
   The National Education Association, a private group, distributed
a letter to Congress in support of Frank's bill. It said the
present law has been used to keep out Primo Levi, the Italian
chemist and novelist, Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez and
Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes.
   The letter from the administration, signed in the name of Joe D.
Whitley, acting associate attorney general, said, ``Unless our
reservations are addresssed, the department cannot support the
enactment of this proposed legislation.''
   He asked for changes to Frank's bill that would permit the
attorney general to set conditions for the visit to the United
States of anyone who has ever belonged to a Communist party or to
one of its affiliates.
   Frank criticized the Justice Department, which he said had
refused to discuss his bill with him and then had sent its
nine-page letter of objections only on the morning of the session.
   He said he may agree with some of the objections but would not
discuss them at Tuesday's session.
   Meanwhile, the Judiciary Committee's immigration subcommittee
rejected, 7-3, an effort to amend Frank's bill in such a way as to
preserve the administration's right to control the visits of
present and former Communists. Rep. Lamar S. Smith, R-Texas, is
expected to propose the amendment again as the bill goes through
later stages in the House.
   ``I, too, am a supporter of free speech,'' Smith told the
subcommittee. ``However, our country's national security should
never be jeopardized for free speech.''
   Smith was opposed by Rep. Hamilton Fish Jr., R-N.Y., who joined
the Democrats in voting against the amendment.
   ``The exclusion of Communists is out of date,'' Fish said in an
interview after the session.
   ``There are different kinds of Communists in different
countries. Some would be people we wouldn't want as visitors.
Others would be acceptable. An Italian Communist, for example, is
different from many others,'' he said.
   Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn, chairman of the subcommittee,
ridiculed Smith's proposal.
   ``With that amendment in force, George Washington would never
have been able to get back in if he had left the country,''
Morrison said. ``It would exclude anyone with revolutionary ideas.''

<HEAD>Members of Congress Seek Human Rights for Displaced Cambodians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 100 House members are asking the Thai
government to help Cambodians ``held against their will'' leave
refugee camps near the Thai-Cambodian border and under the control
of the communist Khmer Rouge.
   A letter sent to Thai ambassador Vitthya Vejjajiva said that
thousands of the perhaps 100,000 displaced Cambodians in Khmer
Rouge-controlled camps ``are held against their will ... and would
move to other camps if they had the freedom to do so.''
   A copy of the letter bearing the names of members of both
parties was circulated Tuesday by Asia Watch, a private human
rights monitoring organization.
   It quoted reports as saying camp inmates are subjected to
summary executions, forced removal to mine-strewn combat areas,
forced labor, torture, denial of medical treatment and other abuses.
   As a first step toward providing freedom of movement to the
displaced Cambodians, the letter asked Thailand to facilitate free
access by international relief agencies to Khmer Rouge camps on its
soil. It welcomed recent reports that the Thai government was
considering measures to improve the refugees' situation.
   The Thai Embassy said the letter was received and preparing a
statement on it.
   Countries working toward a political settlement involving the
withdrawal of Vietnamese military forces from Cambodia have urged
safeguards against a return to power by the Khmer Rouge, blamed for
millions of deaths during its rule of Cambodia before the 1978
Vietnamese invasion. Thailand has been accused of seeking to use
the Khmer Rouge as a buffer between its forces and the Vietnamese
army in Cambodia.

<HEAD>Robbers Commit Suicide After Standoff, One Surrenders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three bank robbers committed
suicide and a fourth surrendered after their hostage escaped from a
plane used in a getaway attempt, officials in northeastern Brazil
said Tuesday.
   A fifth robber committed suicide Saturday, a day after the drama
began, police said. Officials said the robbers had made a pact to
commit suicide if their crime failed.
   The episode that ended Monday night at Val-de-Caes airport in
the Amazon River city of Belem began Friday when five gunmen tried
to rob a bank in Acu, 1,860 miles northwest of Rio, authorities
said.
   When police arrived, the gunmen took five hostages and demanded
a plane and pilots to make their escape with $24,674 in cash.
   Police gave them a Brazilian-made 19-seat Bandeirantes, and the
robbers released all their hostages except one.
   The subsequent chase covered more than 1,200 miles across
northern Brazil.
   On Saturday, the robbers and their hostage flew to Belem, 2,140
miles northwest of Rio, where they released the pilot and co-pilot.
   When negotiations with police stalled, one of the robbers shot
himself. His body was left on the runway and taken to a morgue.
   On Monday, the Roman Catholic archbiship of Belem, the Most.
Rev. Alberto Ramos, met with the robbers and offered to take the
place of Fonseca as hostage. The gunmen refused.
   Police said hostage Hudson Fonseca, manager of the Northeastern
Bank of Brazil in Acu, slipped away from his captors Monday night.
The robbers had tried unsuccessfully to negotiate for a new
aircraft to replace the plane they were given earlier, authorities
said.
   ``They were exhausted and desperate,'' federal police
spokeswoman Myrtes Nabuco de Oliveira Pontes said by telephone.
``When the police refused to meet their demands for a new plane,
they began tearing the aircraft apart.''
   Teams of police sharpshooters surrounded the commuter plane,
which was parked on a landing strip.
   However, three robbers came down the plane's stairway pointing
pistols at their own heads shortly after the hostage escaped and
shot themselves without warning, federal police agent Fernando
Cesar said.
   A suspect remaining in the plane then called out for a
cigarette, which a police officer outside offered to him, the agent
said. When the suspect came out for it, authorities grabbed him and
took him into custody, he said.
   News reports said officials had stormed the plane, but officials
denied using force.

<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city is considering a plan to put
alarms or exploding dye packs inside its parking meters to stop
vandals who have smashed or stolen half of them in the past nine
months, officials said Tuesday.
   Merchants are angry because motorists ignore parking
restrictions when the meters don't work, and customers are
discouraged by fewer open parking spaces.
   ``This meter problem is a really frustrating situation that's
costing the city a lot of money, and what's odd is that the thieves
are not getting much for their efforts,'' said Public Works
Director Terry Roberts.
   Vandals who bash or steal the meters can hope at best to get $20
for their efforts. In many cases they get only a few dollars, or a
few cents if they can't pry open the vault-like coin containers,
Roberts said.
   But more than 4,000 of the city's 8,500 parking meters have been
bashed in, broken open or ripped right out of the ground and carted
off. Police find the twisted metal carcasses strewn under freeway
underpasses and in parks.
   ``It seems people popped a few tops off the meters some months
ago and found it was easier than they thought and, of course, the
word spread,'' Roberts said.
   About 75 people have been arrested in the parking meter
bashings. Police have vowed to seek felony theft charges in as many
cases as possible, said Lt. Larry Eade.
   ``We've arrested people who have filled up shopping carts with
the meters, then covered them up with their belongings,'' Eade said.
   The city, with a population of about 350,000, has lost about
$450,000 in revenue because of damaged meters. It will cost
$840,000 to replace 7,000 of the old meters with a $120
tamper-resistant version, officials said.
   Some of the new, heavy-duty meters are in place, but they are
not immune to vandalism either.
   Thieves sometimes rip out the new machines, take them to
secluded locations and bash them open, police said.
   The city plans to allocate $12,000 for overtime to fund an
undercover police squad looking into the problem, and may put
alarms or exploding colored dye packs in meters, said Yvonne
Garcia, chief of staff to Mayor Lionel Wilson.
   ``If these people are causing all these problems just for a few
nickles and dimes, I think they've got to be pretty stupid,'' said
Al Federas of Lake Shore Travel, one of the merchants who
complained about the thefts.

<HEAD>Scientist Says Test Proves Utah Fusion Experiment Not Chemical Reaction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scientist said Tuesday a controlled,
simultaneous test of a University of Utah chemist's claim to have
achieved nuclear fusion in a jar of water proved the energy
produced did not come from a chemical reaction.
   Robert Huggins, Stanford University professor of material
sciences, said his experiment using palladium electrodes in jars of
heavy water and plain water in a picnic basket produced energy that
may have resulted from fusion.
   Huggins said he can't be sure the energy is from fusion, but is
certain it is not from a chemical reaction, as some other
scientists have speculated. He suggested the energy may result from
a different type of fusion than is commonly known.
   He said he ran five experiments over two weeks, using a jar of
heavy water, or deuterium oxide, and a jar of plain water. If the
experiments produced the same results, he said, it would indicate
the energy was not from fusion.
   Instead, he found much higher temperatures from the deuterium,
which meant the energy probably was not a chemical reaction because
there is no essential chemical difference between the two kinds of
water.
   ``There are significant thermal differences between the
deuterium and the hydrogen (plain water) system,'' he said. ``We
don't say what it is.''
   The discovery of cold fusion was announced March 23 by
University of Utah chemistry professor Stanley Pons and British
colleague Martin Fleischmann.
   Pons, who said Monday further experiments with heavy water and a
palladum electrode yielded even more energy and run more
efficiently, noted the apparent cold fusion discovery had been
partly verified by more than 60 university and private laboratories.
   Of the more than 60 other experimenters, Pons said none has
reported observing both the production of neutrons and the high
level of heat he and Fleischmann produced.
   Neutrons are a tell-tale sign of fusion, the process powering
the sun, in which tremendous amounts of energy are released when
the cores of two hydrogen atoms fuse.
   Scientists say that if fusion can be created as easily as Pons
and Fleischmann claim, it could be a relatively inexpensive and
virtually inexhaustible energy source.

   The state Senate voted 13-11 on Tuesday to
repeal three 1848 laws making abortion a crime.
   The bill, passed by the House on March 23, now goes to Gov. Judd
Gregg, who has not said whether he will sign it. Gregg has said he
personally opposes abortion.
   The laws have not been enforced since the 1973 U.S. Supreme
Court ruling legalizing abortion.
   The swing vote in the Senate was Democrat James St. Jean, who
said abortion is a decision for a woman to make in accordance with
her own religious beliefs.
   Fourteen other states have old anti-abortion laws on the books
that are unenforceable because of the Roe vs. Wade decision, but
there has been debate over whether they could take effect if the
high court overturned the decision.
   The states are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut,
Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi,
Oklahoma, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
   The Supreme Court plans to hear arguments April 26 in a key
abortion-rights case from Missouri in which the justices are being
asked to overturn or substantially limit their landmark 1973
decision.

<HEAD>Italian Scientists Achieve Fusion in a `New Way'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PIA HINCKLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian scientists announced Tuesday they achieved
nuclear fusion at room temperature with a different process than
other recent ``cold fusion'' experiments have used.
   They cautioned it was too soon to tell if their process would
prove practical for generating energy.
   The scientists said recent experients at the National Agency for
Alternative Energy in Frascati, just outside of Rome, produced
large emissions of neutrons but too little energy to register.
   Emissions of neutrons _ particles of an atom _ are evidence of
fusion.
   Fusion, the process that powers the sun, produces energy when
the cores of two hydrogen atoms fuse. In contrast, conventional
nuclear power plants use fission, which is the splitting of atoms.
   Scientists have long searched for a way to harness nuclear
fusion. Standard experiments have used extremely high temperatures.
   Last month, an American and a British researcher said they
produced fusion at room temperature.
   But unlike that work, the new Italian experiments did not use
electrical current to trigger the reaction. And they did not use
``heavy water,'' which contains a heavy version of hydrogen called
deuterium.
   ``The experiment is totally different from former ones,'' said
Umberto Colombo, head of the National Agency for Alternative
Energy. ``We have paved the way for a new road to fusion research.
What we don't know yet is if the energy generated is sufficient to
justify practical application.''
   ``If this experiment were not of such great importance to the
public, we would never have announced the discovery at this
point,'' said Professor Francesco Scaramuzzi, 60, who performed the
experiments. ``We are still in a very preliminary phase.''
   Scaramuzzi said that on two occasions they measured high
emissions of neutrons after placing a sample of the element
titanium and deuterium gas in a special metal tube and subjecting
it to various pressures and temperatures.
   The neutrons appeared in one case after applying high pressure
and low temperature, and in another at low pressure and room
temperature.
   The agency decided to begin the experiments after Stanley Pons
of the University of Utah and Martin Fleischmann of the University
of Southampton in England announced on March 23 that they achieved
nuclear fusion at room temperature.
   Pons and Fleischmann said their experiment using common lab
equipment had been run for more than 100 hours and produced four
times as much energy as it used. In a similar experiment,
researcher Steven Jones of Brigham Young University in Utah found
evidence of only very low energy output.
   On Monday, Pons told a news conference in Salt Lake City that
more than 60 university and private laboratories partly verified
the claims he made last month with Fleischmann.
   He also said further experiments yielded even more energy and
ran more efficiently. He said a controlled fusion reaction has been
sustained more than 800 hours in a small flask containing heavy
water and a palladium electrode and that recent tests produced
roughly eight times the energy consumed.
   Pons said researchers measured the production of 20 to 30 watts
of electricity from the experiment, or about 67 watts per cubic
centimeter of electrode, compred to 26 watts per cubic centimeter
in the earlier experiments.
   Those experiments used electrolysis, in which an electrical
current was used to herd hydrogen atoms into metal electrodes,
where the atoms were apparently forced to fuse because of proximity.
   Scaramuzzi told a news conference, ``After (Steven) Jones'
experiment, I asked myself, how important is electrolysis? There
must be more than one road to fusion.''
   Scaramuzzi said that the energy output of his experiment at this
scale was too low to be registered.
   In a separate development, the official Czechoslovak news agency
CTK said Tuesday that a team of Czechoslovak physicists also
produced room-temperature fusion through the electrolysis method.
   Pavol Povinc, who led the team of scientists from the Comenius
University's faculty of mathematics in Bratislava, capital of
Slovakia, announced they had achieved fusion on Monday.

<HEAD>$6 Million Cleanup Research Program Unveiled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Assoicated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department announced a joint $6
million, three-year research program with the petroleum industry
Tuesday to develop better recovery and cleanup equipment and
methods for large oil spills.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. said the department would
pay for half of the program, with the American Petroleum Institute
paying for the other half. The department's current budget for such
research is less than $150,000.
   ``In the wake of the Exxon Valdez accident, we must make sure
that our oil spill contingency plans are thoroughly re-examined to
meet our responsibility for protecting the environment,'' said
Lujan.
   He made the announcement after meeting for about 20 minutes with
Richard Marro, chairman of Amoco and chairman of the American
Petroleum Institute, and with Charles DiBona, president of the
industry organization.
   Lujan said he was flying to Alaska on Wednesday for a four-day
tour of areas affected by the March 24 spill from the Exxon tanker
that has caused environmental havoc in Prince William Sound and
along Alaska's southern coastline.
   Meanwhile, the department said it was planning to step up
inspections at offshore oil drilling platforms to check whether the
industry ``is prepared to respond'' to an oil spill emergency. A
report on the inspections is to be presented to Lujan late next
month.
   The $6 million research effort over three years is aimed at
developing and field testing various methods and technology for
dealing with massive spills. Lujan has described the containment
equipment in Alaska at the time of the Exxon spill as little more
than ``tinker-toys'' that would not have contained the spill even
if it had been deployed rapidly.
   In Alaska, said Lujan, oil containment booms frequently broke
from the force of the waves and oil syphoning equipment was far too
slow to do much good.
   Department officials said the joint Interior-industry study will
involve laboratory and field testing of various oil-burning
techniques, new high-speed steerable booms, and more advanced
skimmer technology for clearing oil from ice-laden waters.
   Various chemicals, some of which are supposed to disperse oil
while others are designed to keep it together, also will be tested
under the program, the officials said.
   Marro said that while the industry has conducted research into
oil spill recovery technology for years ``there are lessons to be
learned'' from the Alaskan spill.
   He suggested the industry still does not know all it should
about how best to anticipate oil movement in a cold-water
environment and, for example, once new equipment becomes available
it remains unclear how it should be deployed.

   The House voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to back
a plan to close 86 military bases and scale back five more despite
complaints that the move will not save as much as advocates had
promised.
   By a vote of 381-43, the House rejected a resolution to
disapprove the recommendations of the Commission on Base
Realignment and Closure, giving the green light for Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney to follow through on the panel's proposals
beginning in January.
   ``It is incumbent upon all of us to make sure this base closing
list is implemented,'' the chairman of the House Armed Services
Chairman, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said moments before the vote.
   The commission's recommendations affect a total of 145 domestic
military installations by closing some, reducing the operations of
others and changing the missions of additional bases.
   The law establishing the commission, the Base Closure and
Realignment Act, requires that, once approved by the secretary of
defense, the commission's recommendations proceed unless both
houses of Congress vote to disapprove them, in which case none of
the proposals would take effect.
   The House action means the changes proposed by the commission
will proceed.
   In debate before the vote, opponents of the move said it would
not save as much money as the commission projected.
   ``This list simply does not save money,'' said Rep. Jim Saxton,
R-N.J.
   He was jointed by representatives from Illinois and California
in saying that the plan would not save $694 million in the first
year, or $5.6 billion over 20 years, as the commission projected.
   ``In terms of savings, I don't believe they're there. In terms
of expenditures, I believe thy're underestimated,'' said Saxton,
who opposes the closing of Fort Dix in his home state.
   Saxton cited a congressional report that said the savings in
closing Fort Dix had been overestimated by $20 million.
   The New Jersey representative also noted that a report by the
General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, had
found that the commission used incorrect data in its analysis of
Army training centers, including Fort Dix.
   ``Had accurate data been used, Fort Dix would hae been ranked
first,'' Saxton said.
   Rep. Terry Bruce, D-Ill., said the estimated savings rely on
major defense policy changes, including reductions in personnel,
and not on the closing and realigning of bases.
   ``The whole tone of the commission was based on manipulating
data, changing ratings, fudging dollar figures and misleading both
Congress and the public,'' Bruce said.
   All but a dozen of the votes for the resolution came from
representatives from Illinois, California and New Jersey. Among the
plan's supporters, Rep. Ronald Machtley, R-R.I., argued that it was
``time to get serious about deficit reduction.''
   ``Obsolete bases have drained our resources. ... The
recommendations are the only viable option for cutting expenditures
of funds,'' he said.
   Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., a member of the House Armed
Services Committee, said that although the GAO had found some
errors in the commission's work, the bottom line was still the
savings.
   ``Maybe we don't save as much money on some of the bases, maybe
we disagreed with the models that was used, but they never said on
one of these bases that it was going to cost money to close them if
you look at it over a six-year period,'' Schroeder said.
   Last month, the Armed Services Committee voted 43-4 to support
the commission report.
   Schroeder also said that she and Rep. Brian Donnelly, D-Mass.,
will introduce legislation next week to close and realign bases
overseas.
   Schroeder said that total basing costs overseas have increased
nearly 500 percent since 1974 and that leaving those installations
out of the domestic base closure bill was a ``glaring omission.''
   ``Our allies have insisted on higher and higher payments for the
permission to operate bases on their soil,'' Schroeder said. ``In
essence we are being forced to pay more for the privilege of
defending our allies _ $2 billion a year, up from $200 million in
1974.''
   Twenty-six Democrats and 17 Republicans voted for the resolution
while 229 Democrats and 152 Republicans voted against it. Four
Democrats and five Republicans did not vote.
   Voting for the resolution were Reps. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz.; Barbara

<HEAD>Poland Acknowledges Bush's Aid Initiative</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The communist government said Tuesday that
President Bush's economic aid plan for Poland is ``a step in the
right direction after years of restrictions and limitations.''
   But deputy government spokesman Zbyslaw Rykowski strongly
disagreed with Bush's assessment that ``communism is fading.''
   ``Communism is not falling, and we will try to prove this,'' he
told a news conference.
   ``Developments in Poland, which have made the U.S.
administration change its stance toward Poland, undeniably testify
to the fact that we are moving forward and create new hopes.''
   Bush on Monday disclosed economic incentives to reward Poland
for steps toward democracy and to encourage further political and
economic reforms.
   The package included asking Congress to lower tariffs on
selected Polish imports under the generalized system of
preferences, and seeking congressional approval of U.S.-guaranteed
loans to stimulate private investment in Poland.
   Bush also announced a new U.S. willingness to work with other
Western financial leaders to help Poland deal with its $38 billion
foreign debt.
   Taken together, the moves could work to Poland's economic
advantage to the tune of more than $1 billion.
   ``The Polish government interprets this statement (Bush's) as a
step in the right direction after years of restrictions and
limitations,'' Rykowski said.
   He said Poland would be able to evaluate the package fully on
``the basis of concrete results.''
   If fully implemented, the U.S. package would largely reverse
economic sanctions taken against the government in 1981-82 after it
imposed martial law and banned Solidarity.
   A Warsaw court restored the independent trade union's legal
status Monday in accord with an agreement reached April 5 between
communist authorities and the opposition on economic and political
reform.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa praised Bush for his action when
he arrived in Warsaw Monday night from Gdansk.
   ``Bush is a great man and he knows the Polish situation very
well,'' Walesa told reporters. He called the U.S. aid proposal
``quite large.''

<HEAD>Shamir Meets with Hungarian Leader, Mediation Role Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
met Tuesday with Communist Party chief Karoly Grosz, and Hungary
announced it has assumed a mediating role in the Middle East.
   Shamir's sudden, unannounced trip raised speculation in Israel
that the two countries were about to restore diplomatic ties.
Hungary broke ties with Israel during the 1967 Middle East war.
   Shamir told the official MTI news agency shortly before his
departure that he hoped Israel and Hungary would establish normal
diplomatic relations ``in the very near future.''
   ``But I can't give any definite date,'' MTI quoted him as saying.
   Hungarian officials did not disclose the purpose of Shamir's
two-day visit, nor did they give details on his meeting with Grosz.
   However, the state news agency MTI quoted Foreign Ministry
spokesman Istvan Komoroczki as saying, ``Hungary has agreed to act
as a mediator and will try to persuade all parties concerned in the
Middle East crisis to sit down to the negotiating table.''
   Israeli radio reports also said Shamir was discussing an East
bloc role in Mideast peace efforts.
   The reports did not elaborate, but Hungary may be taking over a
role long attributed to President Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania.
   Ceausescu leads the only East bloc country that did not sever
relations with Israel during the 1967 Middle East war. However,
many countries now shun Romania because of its human rights record.
   Hungarian Premier Miklos Nemeth has said he expects full
diplomatic relations to be restored between Hungary and Israel by
June.
   Hungary is seeking removal of trade barriers imposed by Israel,
Kovacs told MTI. The agency said the Israelis have stressed they
extend trade preferences only to countries with which they have
full diplomatic ties.

   The Soviet Union has experienced at least three
fatal stadium panics similar to the one that took 95 lives in
England last weekend, a Soviet newspaper reported Tuesday.
   Thousands of fans were allowed to enter an already crowded
standing-room area of the Sheffield stadium on Saturday, and
spectators were trampled or crushed against a fence.
   Sovietsky Sport said dozens of people died in Moscow's Lenin
Stadium on Oct. 21, 1982, during a game between Spartak Moscow and
Haarlem of Holland. It said cries of horror were heard when
``dozens of people died under the heels of thousands.''
   Authorities would not say at the time whether anyone was killed
or injured. Unofficial sources said a woman fell into a narrow
passageway and people trying to help her were trampled by the crowd.
   The article in Sovietsky Sport also said some boys died in a
crush at a junior hockey match between the Soviet Union and Canada
in Moscow's sports palace in 1975, but did not say how many.
   People also were killed in Krasnoyarsk in Siberia in 1982 at the
opening ceremony of the Spartakiad, a national winter sports
festival, it said.

<HEAD>Barry Friend Linked to Drug Ring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles Lewis, an old friend of Mayor Marion
Barry, has had dealings with a man arrested as part of a major drug
crackdown in the nation's capital, according to sources familiar
with an ongoing probe into the drug ring.
   Investigators have gathered information that Lewis, already
under indictment on drug charges in separate cases in the District
of Columbia and the Virgin Islands, has dealt with Rayful Edmond
III, the alleged leader of a powerful local drug ring.
   However, Lewis and Edmond did not deal drugs together, the
sources said. Instead, Lewis may have purchased drugs from Edmond
or his partners when he traveled to Washington on several occasions
during the past year, the sources said.
   Edmond, 24, was arrested along with 16 other persons over the
weekend in what U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens called the ``most
significant'' crackdown on illegal drugs ever in the city.
   Lewis was indicted last Thursday on seven counts of perjury and
three counts of cocaine possession, stemming from an investigation
into Barry's visits to Lewis' hotel room last December.
   Lewis, a former District of Columbia and Virgin Islands
government employee, was charged with lying to a federal grand jury
about whether he possessed cocaine on Dec. 22, on a day on which
Barry visited him. Lewis is also charged with lying about using
cocaine with two separate individuals on Dec. 21, a day on which
Barry twice visited him.
   The federal probe began after city police on Dec. 22 were
inexplicably called off an attempt to make an undercover drug
purchase from Lewis, 48, after Barry showed up at his hotel room.
Barry has acknowledged contacting police officials looking into the
affair but has said he was only trying to speed up the probe.
   Lewis also went on trial Monday in the Virgin Islands on charges
he attempted to sell cocaine to undercover FBI agents during March.
   Stephens said Edmond's cartel, made up mostly of family members,
may have been responsible for up to 25 percent of the cocaine sold
in Washington, as well as a number of drug-related murders.
   Edmond and eight other accused members of the ring are being
held without bond after hearings Monday before a U.S. magistrate.
Seven other adults and a juvenile were also arrested on Saturday in
a sweep that followed a two-year investigation.
   Stephens said the case remains open, but wouldn't say if or when
he expects to make more arrests.

   House Speaker Jim Wright, opening his defense
against a string of ethics committee charges, sought Tuesday to
rally Democratic colleagues and told them, ``I intend to fight and
I intend to win.''
   He said that while he may have made mistakes in judgment, ``I
have never done anything to dishonor this institution and I never
will.'' At the same time, Democrats agonized over the political
decision they face on whether to keep Wright as speaker, and one
said ``It may be that the toughest political vote of our lives will
be the one to save him.''
   In a half-hour speech to a private session of the Democratic
Caucus in the House chamber, and later in press releases, Wright
chose to concentrate his defense on one issue: the charge that his
wife, Betty, did no substantial work for the $72,000 she received
from a Fort Worth friend from 1980 to 1984.
   But more troubling to many of his colleagues were charges that
Wright sought to evade House limits on outside earned income
through seven bulk sales of his book, ``Reflections of a Public
Man,'' most of them made in lieu of accepting speaking fees from
interest groups.
   Wright received a standing ovation at the end of his caucus
speech, which included an admission that he had made some errors in
judgment and ``may have made some mistakes in my life,'' according
to participants.
   He also told his fellow Democrats, who re-elected him as speaker
just four months ago, that he did not want to continue to hold the
post if he couldn't be an effective leader of the party, according
to one member present.
   Emerging from the chamber, he told reporters: ``I told them I
intend to fight and I intend to win. I told them I have never done
anything to dishonor this insitution and I never will.''
   Wright's lawyer, William C. Oldaker, was consulting with the
ethics committee to arrange a speedy appearance for the speaker
before the committee to answer the charges. Late Tuesday, the
speaker sent a letter to the panel formally denying all counts
against him.
   Rep. John T. Myers of Indiana, the ranking Republican on the
ethics committee, said while the panel would try to expedite
matters in accord with Wright's request, it would be difficult to
cut much time from the process without denying due process to
either side. He said it could take up to two months to bring
Wright's case to a disciplinary hearing.
   Following Wright's speech, most Democratic House members
interviewed voiced tentative support for the speaker. Many said
they had not yet read the ethics committee's voluminous report
formally charging him with 69 instances of rules violations, and
added that they were waiting to see whether the panel takes all of
those issues to a disciplinary hearing.
   But they acknowledged that growing political heat from their
home districts _ and what lawmakers hear when they go home for the
long Passover weekend _ would play a role in whether Wright remains
as speaker.
   ``The recess will have some role, because every member is
undoubtedly aware that if we have to make difficult votes in
defense of the speaker, those will be used in 30-second Republican
political ads against us'' in the next election, said Rep. Pat
Williams, D-Mont.
   ``The easy thing for Democrats to do is to throw Jim Wright over
the side and instantly install (House Majority Leader) Tom Foley
behind the wheel,'' Williams said. ``It may be that the toughest
political vote of our lives will be the one to save him.''
   ``It's not going to be about justice,'' added Rep. Ron Dellums,
D-Calif. ``It's going to be about how it'll play in Peoria.''
   Rep. Timothy J. Penny, D-Minn., said he was most concerned about
Wright's book sales, which the ethics panel charged were used as a
ruse to circumvent the rule that caps outside earned income at 30
percent of a member's salary.
   ``If there's a rigid interpretation of the rules, he's OK,''
Penny said. ``But if there's strong evidence they were trying to
circumvent income limits, that's a gray area.''
   Penny said he did not attend Wright's speech because he was
uncomfortable with what he termed efforts by the Democratic
leadership to make the ethics case into a test of partisan loyalty.
   ``We're trying to make it us against them, Democrats against
Republicans. ... That's not the nature of these ethics questions,''
he said.
   Penny also said he believed there is a growing public perception
of wrongdoing by Wright which will cause political problems no
matter how the case is resolved.
   ``The committee could recommend no sanction, and (Wright) could
still be under some pressure to step down,'' he said.
   ``There's been a slowdown and a morale loss,'' said Rep. Bill
Richardson, D-N.M. ``It's a very bleak period. I've been in
Congress seven years and I've never felt so bad and down about
being a member of Congress.''
   Republicans, meanwhile, appeared to seek to turn up the heat on
Democrats, holding a news conference to outline their own
legislative agenda for the next two years and declaring ``it's time
for Democrats to help govern or get out of the way.''
   ``We have to get by the blaring headlines, quite frankly, and
get back to work,'' said Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill. But
Michel and Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., denied they were seeking
to capitalize on Wright's problems.
   Wright was gathering affidavits from people in Fort Worth who
said they had worked with his wife and observed what she did in
return for her $18,000-a-year salary from real estate developer
George Mallick and the partnership the two couples formed, known as
Mallightco.
   He said she had researched investment opportunities in real
estate and office building ventures in Fort Worth and New York and
studied investments in a winery, in the movie version of the
musical ``Annie,'' and in oil ventures and stock purchases.
   ``The fact is that my wife worked. She earned her pay,'' Wright
said.

   The first lawsuit filed under a new law
prohibiting housing discrimination against families with children
was filed Tuesday against the owners of a New Jersey apartment
complex.
   The suit, filed by the Justice Department's civil rights
division, charges that LaFonge Associates violated the recently
amended Fair Housing Act by refusing to rent a one-bedroom
apartment to a single parent and a child.
   Amendments to the Fair Housing Act that were enacted by Congress
last year housing discrimination against people with handicaps and
those with children. Retirement communities with special facilities
for elderly people are exempt from the law.
   The suit charged that LaFonge Associates ``engaged in a pattern
of practice of discrimination against persons on the basis of
familial status in the rental of dwellings .''
   The company, which owns Somerset Mews Apartments in Franklin
Township of Somerset County, N.J., was accused of telling
prospective tenants that it preferred to families without children.
   The Justice Department, acting on a complaint by the Housing
Coalition of Middlesex County of New Brunswick, sought an
injunction to force the company to stop the alleged discriminatory
practices.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey, also seeks
compensatory damages and a civil penalty ``in order to vindicate
the public interest.''

   The Tax Court turned thumbs down Tuesday on a
Minnesota undertaker who took a business tax deduction for $11,000
of expenses of wedding receptions for two daughters.
   William L. McReavy of Minneapolis and his wife, Kathleen,
claimed the receptions as an advertising-entertainment expense,
contending that 82 percent of the people invited were clients or
referral sources for his Washburn-McReavy Funeral Chapels, Inc.
   ``The personal element of the expenses for the McReavys'
daughters' weddings was so prominent that we believe that even a
person not versed in the tax law would know that the corporation
could not deduct them,'' the court held.
   The court was so unimpressed by the argument that it allowed the
Internal Revenue Service to add a negligence penalty to the
McReavys' bill.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people attacked banks, police
stations and stores in a southern town Tuesday to protest price
increases imposed by the government, witnesses reported.
   One report said 25 people were injured before police restored
order in Maan, a town of 25,000 people 120 miles south of Amman.
   Price increases are part of an agreement with the International
Monetary Fund to reduce budget deficits as a step toward
rescheduling much of the $6 billion debt.
   King Hussein's government has promised to continue low,
subsidized prices for such staples as bread, milk and rice. A loaf
of Arabic flat bread costs less than 4 cents.
   Yousef Azem, a former member of Parliament, said the protest
began among public transport drivers, who went to schools and
rallied students to demonstrate. He estimated 3,000 people were
involved in the protests.
   A merchant said it seemed like ``the whole town participated. I
heard people chanting slogans because of the price hikes and
increases in rent. They were chanting slogans against the
government.''
   On Sunday, the government raiserd gasoline prices 25 percent to
the equivalent of about $1.65 a gallon, imposed an annual license
fee of $370 on taxis and raised the fees for other vehicles. Prices
of cigarettes, cooking gas, alcoholic beverages and telephone calls
went up by 10 to 50 percent.
   Jordan imports most consumer goods and those prices have risen
sharply because of a devaluation early last year that reduced
exchange rate for the dinar from about $3 to $1.85.
   Many landlords also raised rents because of the devaluation, but
monthly wages equivalent to $185-$370 for most workers have not
gone up. The government also has cut overtime and other fringe
benefits for public workers.
   Unemployment, almost nonexistent five years ago, has risen to 20
percent by some estimates.
   The crisis arose because of declines in Jordan's main sources of
foreign exchange: money sent home by Jordanians living abroad and
aid from Arab nations.
   Azem said 25 protesters and policemen were injured Tuesday in
Maan. He said the crowd stoned or burned five banks and attacked
two police posts and several government offices.
   A hotel worker in Maan said: ``About six cars were smashed. You
can now see the traces of burned cars.'' He reported seeing several
banks stoned and a small fire set in the entrance of one.
   Officials in Maan insisted it was only a small protest and
denied any buildings had been attacked. ``A few young men after
leaving school before noontime burned tires and demonstrated, but
police stopped them peacefully,'' said Faheem Nawayseh, deputy
governor of the region.
   There was no immediate official word on casualties or arrests.
   Crown Prince Hassan, acting as regent during King Hussein's
visit to the United States, flew to the town and met with
residents, advancing a planned visit by one day.
   A report by the official Jordan News Agency said representatives
of taxi drivers and owners met with Transportation Minister Khaled
Haj Hassan in Amman and condemned ``the havoc created this
morning'' by some drivers.
   It said Hassan announced that taxi fares would be increased
Wednesday to compensate for the increased costs but bus fares would
not change.

<HEAD>Bush Sends Congress Medicaid Proposal for Pregnant Women, Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday sent Congress his
proposal to add 374,000 pregnant women and children to the Medicaid
program in an effort to reduce the nation's high infant mortality
rate.
   ``Infant and maternal care is an area where we must invest in
the future,'' Bush said in a statement. ``I am particularly
disturbed by the fact that the infant mortality rate for black
infants is nearly twice that for whites.''
   Bush announced the outlines of the initiative in February as
part of his fiscal 1990 budget. He proposed Medicaid spending of
$37.6 billion _ $3.3 billion or 9.6 percent more than this year's
budget for the federal-state health assistance program for the poor.
   States would pick up the cost of the added coverage.
   His plan would require state Medicaid programs, by April 1,
1990, to cover pregnant women and mothers with infants as long as
their incomes are within 130 percent of the federal poverty line.
This would require coverage for a single pregnant woman with an
income of up to $10,426; a household of two with an income up to
$13,078; a household of three, $15,730; and a household of four,
$18,382.
   States have been moving toward a threshold of 100 percent of the
poverty line that is required by current law to be reached by July
1, 1990, and they have the option of going to 185 percent. That
option would remain under Bush's plan.
   Currently, all but 10 states cover pregnant women and infants up
to 1 year old at 100 percent of the poverty level or more. Ten
states use a cutoff of more than 100 percent, according to the
Health Care Financing Administration, which administers the
Medicaid program.
   The president's plan also would require states to improve
participation in Medicaid by running outreach programs in areas
that have high infant mortality rates and to provide Medicaid
services to pregnant women who are presumed eligible before they go
through a formal eligibility determination.
   Also under the program, all children under 6 who receive food
stamps would be covered by Medicaid for immunizations.
   Bush also proposed spending $20 million in fiscal 1990 and 1991
on a new program to improve coordination among three federal
programs serving women and children _ Medicaid, Maternal and Child
Health, and the Women, Infants and Children nutritional program.
   The increases in Medicaid coverage would be paid for by
reductions in the federal matching rate for state administrative
expenses. The rates, currently ranging from 75 percent to 100
percent, would be reduced gradually to a uniform 50 percent.
   ``This legislation does not do all that we want to do but it
does do what we can do at this time,'' Bush said.
   Public health officials have been concerned for some time that
infant mortality rates in the United States have not been improving
as fast as in other nations. The United States dropped from 19th in
1980 to 22nd in 1985 among nations in the world ranked by infant
mortality rates.
   In 1985, the infant mortality rate for white Americans was 9.3
deaths per 1,000 births, while it was 18.2 per 1,000 for black
Americans.

   Miss Ball, with her late former husband Dezi Arnaz, starred in
the 1951-1957 television show ``I Love Lucy,'' one of the most
popular TV shows of all time. It is still seen around the world in
syndicated reruns.
   The red-haired entertainer went solo in 1962 with ``The Lucy
Show.'' The name was changed to ``Here's Lucy'' in 1968. The show
went off the air in 1974.
   She and Arnaz started their own production company, Desilu, on a
shoestring budget of $5,000 in 1950. The Arnazes were divorced in
1960, and two years later Arnaz sold his share of the studio to
Miss Ball for $3 million. In 1967, she sold the company to Gulf &amp;
Western for $18 million.
   Miss Ball married nightclub comedian Morton in 1961. He became
her executive producer.
   Her last public appearance was during the 61st annual Academy

<TEXT>
   In a landmark decision
Tuesday, a judge found four Eskimos innocent of charges of public
mischief arising from protests of low-level NATO flights over their
traditional hunting grounds.
   ``I am satisfied that the four believe their ancestors predate
any Canadian claims to ancestry on this land,'' Judge James
Igloliorte told a makeshift courtroom set up in the community hall
of this Labrador village.
   ``Through their knowledge of ancestry and kinship, they have
shown that none of their people ever gave away rights to the land
to Canada.''
   Daniel Ashini, chief of the local Innu band of Eskimos; Ben
Michel, a band council member; Elizabeth Penashue; and her son,
Peter Penashue _ were accused of entering the runway area at the
Goose Bay air base in September to protest the flights by Canada,
West Germany, Britain and the Netherlands.
   The provincial court judge, himself an Innu, accepted defense
arguments that the four held an ``honest belief'' that the land on
which the airbase is located belongs to the Eskimos, and therefore
they committed no wrong.
   The judge urged a political settlement to the dispute between
the Ottawa government and the Eskimos over the NATO flights and
simulated bombing runs the natives say have made a battleground of
the territory they claim as a homeland.
   Igloliorte said the government ``must negotiate answers to their
problems since the court is unable to answer these problems for
them.''
   Native leaders hailed the ruling as a victory. The government
gave no indication on whether it would appeal the decision.
   After the verdict, the four accused jumped to their feet and
clapped, as did the 150 Eskimo men, women and children who attended
the three-day trial earlier this month.
   The ruling ``calls on Canada to enter into a new era of
relations with the Innu (Eskimo)'' said a beaming Ashini. ``The era
of extinction of rights through an unjust land claims process is
over.''
   James O'Reilly, a native affairs lawyer, termed the judgment a
significant victory for the native people of Canada.
   ``The fact that (the judge) would recognize traditional rights
as being sufficient to override arguments of national defense is
certainly a first, as far as I can see,'' he said in an interview
from Montreal.

   A ship capsized in a storm, leaving at
least two people dead and scores missing, the official Antara news
agency reported Tuesday.
   A police report said at least 26 were missing after the ship
capsized Saturday off Ambon Island in Indonesia's eastern Maluku
province.
   Antara said the small vessel Super Star was overcrowded with 142
passengers when it was caught in a storm and huge waves nine miles
off Hitu, Ambon, about 1,440 miles east of the capital, Jakarta.
   The agency said 62 people survived and two bodies were found,
which would leave 78 people not accounted for.
   Police Sgt. Laode Sakili said in Ambon that the 30-ton Super
Star had 74 people aboard, including seven crew, and that 26 people
were missing and two bodies were recovered after the craft
overturned on its way from Piru on Seram Island to Hitu. He said 46
people survived.
   Sakili said his latest report was received Monday from the
scene, and he could not confirm the Antara account.
   Antara said Capt. Wani Tanalessy sent distress signals, but the
first rescuers did not reach the scene until midnight, more than 11
hours after the ship sank.

   Thunderstorms developed Tuesday over parts of the southern
Plains and Virginia, and snow fell around the south end of Lake
Michigan.
   Thunderstorms developed in the afternoon over sections of
Oklahoma and Arkansas. In northwestern Arkansas, a thunderstorm
produced hail as big as marbles in Madison County.
   Showers were scattered from Illinois to West Virginia.
   Around the southern end of Lake Michigan, snow was occasionally
mixed with rain at Chicago in the morning, and snow continued over
parts of northern Indiana and southern Michigan and the northwest
corner of Ohio in the afternoon. Visibility dropped to a half-mile
in moderate snow at South Bend, Ind.
   The showers and thunderstorms were produced by a frontal system
that extended from New England to Kentucky and the southern Plains,
separating warm weather over the mid-Atlantic Coast states and the
Southeast from cool air prevailing over the north-central states.
   The contrast across the front was especially noticeable in
Indiana. At 2 p.m. EDT, while the snow was falling at South Bend
with a temperature of 34 degrees, 300 miles away at Evansville in
the state's southwestern corner it was 73 degrees.
   North of the front, temperatures were only in the 40s and 50s
from the Great Lakes to the northern and central Plains.
   Thunderstorms also developed during the afternoon over the Blue
Ridge mountains of western Virginia, with small hail reported in
the Shenandoah Valley.
   Scattered showers also were reported over southeastern Florida.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 33
degrees at Limestone, Maine, to 95 at Gila Bend, Ariz. Tuesday's
low in the 48 contiguous states was 19 degrees at Marquette, Mich.
   For Wednesday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast

the central Gulf Coast states and southeastern Texas. Showers were

   A congressman investigating the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission on Tuesday criticized as insufficient
the background checks done on prospective employees of the
exchanges.
   ``As far as people with criminal records _ I don't think there
is any question that those people are likely to be identified
through the fingerprint system,'' said Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla.
   ``It's the so-called white collar crime. We very likely we could
have people who were released from a job without being
prosecuted,'' he said.
   English chairs the House Agriculture subcommittee on
conservation, credit and rural development, which is to find out
whether changes should be made in the CFTC before Congress votes to
reauthorize it.
   It's the CFTC's job to police the commodity futures exchanges.
In the wake of a two-year FBI undercover probe of the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, members of
Congress have been wondering if the CFTC has been doing its job.
   ``Our purpose is to identify weak spots in the system,'' said
English. ``As far as background checks _ that is one weakness we
found today.''
   English's comments followed a briefing by congressional
investigators who have been looking into the operations of the CFTC.
   It was the first in a series of briefings that will be conducted
before CFTC reauthorization hearings are held.
   Staff investigators told the subcommittee that hiring policies
on the exchanges vary.
   No background checks are conducted at the Kansas City Board of
Trade, the Minneapolis Grain Exchange and the Philadelphia Board of
Trade, said James McDonald, a subcommittee staff member.
   ``Each of the three exchanges indicated they conducted an
interview and checked with the references,'' he said.
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange investigates driving records,
credit history and previous criminal convictions and verifies
addresses and social security numbers before hiring anyone into
management, accounting, finance and administration, or the
purchasing and security departments.
   Hiring at the Chicago Board of Trade is similar, said
congressional staff member Gwenetta Blackwell, though she noted the
personnel department there does not check for prior criminal
records during its background investigations.
   Neither exchange has a prohibition against hiring someone with a
criminal record, though if the information is known it would not be
disregarded, she said.
   To be registered with the National Futures Association, a person
must be fingerprinted and undergo a ``name check'' with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to determine whether there is
record of any past disciplinary record in the securities industry.
   ``NFA does not investigate the individual's employment and
educational history, or credit standing and life style as is done
for security clearance investigations,'' said David Tarosky.
   Organizations which must register through the NFA include
futures commissions merchants, introducing brokers, commodity pool
operators, commodity trading advisors, associated persons and floor
brokers.
   In upcoming weeks, the subcommittee will be briefed on
compliance and disciplinary actions, trading practices including
dual trading, sales practices, reparations and arbitrations,
clearing houses and the status of audit trails and trade timing,
with information on technological advances.

<HEAD>Pentagon Considering Cutting Both Attack Subs From Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon is considering the elimination of
both nuclear-powered attack submarines from the 1990 budget, two
congressmen said Tuesday.
   Reps. John G. Rowland, R-Conn., and Herbert H. Bateman, R-Va.,
said they have learned that Defense Department officials were
taking a serious look at eliminating the SSN-688 attack submarines,
which are the last two of the Los Angeles class series the Pentagon
planned to order.
   The proposal was revealed at a House Armed Services seapower
subcommittee hearing during which the lawmakers urged Navy
officials to fight to keep the submarines. The congressmen
represent the home states of the two manufacturers of the Los
Angeles-class subs _ the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics
Corp. in Groton, Conn., and the Newport News (Va.) Shipbuilding Co.
   Vice Adm. William D. Smith, deputy chief of naval operations,
pledged his support for the submarines. He noted that elimination
of the submarines would mean that this would be the first year the
United States had not ordered an attack submarine since 1953.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is expected to annouce next week
plans to cut $6.4 billion from the 1990 budget proposed by
President Reagan. Elimination of the two Los Angeles class subs
would save about $1.5 billion.
   In an interview after the hearing, Rowland said proponents of
the submarine cuts inside the Pentagon are arguing the subs are
expendable since they are the last in the Los Angeles-class series.
   The Navy ordered its first SSN-21 Seawolf submarine, which will
replace the Los Angeles-class subs, last year from Electric Boat.
No Seawolfs were included in the 1990 budget, but two are expected
to be purchased the following fiscal year.
   Rowland and Bateman argued that the United States cannot afford
to eliminate two attack submarines in light of advances in Soviet
submarine technology and production.
   The news of the possible sub cuts came as Navy officials
defended the Pentagon's submarine program and its anti-submarine
warfare technology, which have come under intense scrutiny since an
indepenent study last month warned that recent major advances in
submarine quieting by the Soviets have rendered traditional
detection methods close to obsolete.
   Following the hearing, Rowland sent a telegram to Cheney urging
him to retain the Los Angeles class submarines.
   ``These two 688 submarines are state-of-art and are needed to
assure U.S. qualitative superiority over Soviet submarines force.
Cutting two 688s from budget makes little sense in view of Soviet
(anti-submarine warfare) advances,'' Rowland wrote.

   Some of the crack cocaine sold on
Broward County streets was processed not in dark labs in
crime-ridden neighborhoods, but on the seventh floor of the county
courthouse.
   The sheriff's office has been turning cocaine into the purified,
smokable form because it can't get enough to supply undercover
officers setting up street sweeps to arrest buyers.
   Defense attorneys say that, at best, the sheriff's office is
ethically wrong to make crack, also known as rock.
   A spokesman for Broward Sheriff Nick Navarro, who seems to
thrive on publicity and controversy, said Tuesday the sheriff was
pleased with the operation's results.
   ``With all this publicity, I suppose all the attorneys will be
keenly aware of it,'' said spokesman Jim Leljedal. ``We believe our
cases will stand up.''
   Although the sheriff's office had believed it was the first in
the nation to make its own crack, the Polk County sheriff's
department last June produced 11 ounces of crack cocaine for
undercover use.
   ``I've never heard of that in my whole life before,'' said Con
Dougherty, spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration in
Washington.
   ``We'd like to point out that none of this cocaine is going out
on the streets,'' said Leljedal, adding that besides providing
undercover officers with crack for their sweeps, the program
ensures that buyers are arrested in possession of real cocaine.
   Before going into court, the sheriff's office must prove that
the purchased material is the illegal substance, a problem because
sales of bogus crack are common, Leljedal said.
   He also rejected suggestions of entrapment, saying: ``These are
people who went out on the street to buy crack. They're addicts.''
   Some attorneys have different views.
   ``I think there's something sick about this whole system where
the police make the product, sell the product and arrest people for
buying the product,'' Broward Public Defender Alan Schreiber told
the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel in a story published Tuesday.
   The sheriff's chemist, who has made enough crack to sell for a
total $20,000 on the street, said it makes his job easier because
the drug usually stays inside cellophane bags during the sale and
arrest, so he can identify it without having to analyze it
chemically before going into court.
   Chemist Randy Hilliard uses impounded cocaine to refine into
crack, and made his first batch in February from 2.2 pounds of
seized cocaine. He noted that use of confiscated drugs for sting
operations isn't unusual.
   The sheriff's office made 2,300 crack-related arrests in the
first three months of this year. Leljedal didn't have precise
figures for 1988 arrests, but Navarro _ who also heads a statewide
anti-crack task force _ has said his anti-crack operations have
been a national model.
   Navarro's department is featured in the Fox TV network's
real-life series ``Cops'' and allowed Geraldo Rivera to participate
in an undercover operation for a television special, and his
prediliction for getting on the local evening news led a Miami
Herald columnist to dub the show ``Nick at Nite.''
   Navarro, re-elected by a landslide last November to a second
four-year term, says his diligent pursuit of crack has strong
community support.
   ``I can tell you, you ask the father or mother of any kid who's
on crack cocaine if they have any reservations and see what they
tell you. They have none,'' Navarro said of his latest move.
   Navarro twice has been ordered into court by judges who
threatened him with contempt citations. Most recently, a federal
judge complained about his use of tents to house overflow inmates.
Other critics have said the crack sweeps overburden courts and
jails and do little to provide a lasting solution.

   Friends famous and obscure are headed to
this industrial city to mourn native son Abbie Hoffman, whose
memorial service Wednesday starts with a peace march in the city
where his activism began.
   Hoffman, 52, was found dead on April 12 at his home in New Hope,
Pa., and his body has been cremated. A coroner said Tuesday that
Hoffman committed suicide by swallowing the drug phenobarbitl mixed
with alcohol.
   But his brother, Jack Hoffman, insisted that the death was
accidental.
   ``I just think he took a little too many and he took a good slug
of booze,'' he said. ``My brother had a very strong love and
affection for me and he wouldn't have left me alone like this.''
   The residue of about 150 pills and alcohol were found in his
system.
   ``Abbie, as many of you know, was somewhat careless with pills
and we always warned him about this kind of thing,'' said Jack
Hoffman, who managed his brother's finances.
   In the past week, newspapers have editorialized about Hoffman's
antics, such as burning money at the New York Stock Exchange and
naming his book ``Steal This Book.''
   Vandals last weekend spray-painted ``steal this courthouse'' on
a building where he was tried with Amy Carter, daughter of former
President Carter, for their arrests during a 1986 anti-CIA
demonstration.
   His family has been flooded with letters, telegrams and
condolence calls from entertainers, the Carter family, even foreign
embassies, his brother said. ``I'm not going to say which,'' he
said. ``Let's just say some of our NATO friends.''
   In keeping with Hoffman's career, his family has planned a noon
peace march Wednesday from his mother's house to Temple Emanuel,
which he attended as a child and where a memorial service will be
held.
   ``I want it to be a celebration,'' Hoffman said. ``I want
everybody to be singing and swinging and swaying.''
   Folk singer Pete Seeger volunteered to lead the march and sing
protest songs, he said.
   Jack Hoffman said his brother died nearly broke, despite his
book contracts and success on the lecture circuit. ``He gave just
about everything away,'' he said. ``He didn't die with a Rolex. He
died with a full heart.''
   Besides his brother and mother, Hoffman leaves a sister,
Phyllis; three children from his two marriages; and his long-time
companion, Johanna Lawrenson. Hoffman's ashes were given to Ms.
Lawrenson, his brother said.

<HEAD>Teachers Continue Strike For Higher Pay, Against Corruption</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The education secretary summoned leaders of a
dissident teachers movement and the government-backed union Tuesday
in an attempt to resolve a teacher's strike for higher pay and the
removal of corrupt union chiefs.
   Defying government warning, thousands of Mexico's public school
teachers cut classes for a second day to push for a 100 percent pay
increase and greater democracy in their union, which with 1.1
million members is the largest in Mexico and one of the biggest in
Latin America.
   Before dawn, Education Secretary Manuel Bartlett summoned
leaders of the National Education Workers' Coordinate, a dissident
group within the National Education Workers Union, and the
government-backed union leadership, a strike activist said on
condition of anonymity.
   The coordinate has rejected a government offer to increase pay
by 10 percent and benefits by 18 percent. Teachers earn about
$147.50 a month after taxes.
   Bartlett warned on national television late Monday that striking
teachers could face disciplinary action if they didn't return to
their jobs.
   He said teachers in the federal school system will receive a net
salary increase of 20 percent once an umbrella 10 percent increase
for state and federal teachers goes into efect in May.
   ``To attend to the teachers' demands above what is now possible
would mean a serious financial mess for the economic course of the
country,'' the department said in an advertisement published
Tuesday in Mexico City newspapers.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari acknowledges that teachers
are badly underpaid, but says his hard-pressed government cannot
afford to double salaries.
   ``This is a fight for dignity. This is a fight against hunger,''
said Maria del Carmen Moctezuma, 45, as she sat inside the empty
Victor Maria Flores primary school she directs. ``We support the
strike and won't abandon the fight to improve our economic
condition,'' she said.
   Silvestre Gomez Sotelo, a 42-year-old teacher at the school,
called the government's wage offer ``a slap in the face.''
   ``I invite the education secretary to try living on our
salary,'' Gomez said.
   The dissidents claimed the support of about 500,000 of Mexico's
1.1 million public school teachers when the walkout began Monday.
The figure was not confirmed by the Education Department.
   ``Our movement is a success. Today we expect the solidarity of
90 percent of teachers across the country,'' coordinate leader
Leonardo Gonzalez Monter said in a telephone interview.
   Gonzalez said about 3 million students in Mexico City and the
southern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca skipped classes Tuesday.
   According to government figures, about 25.4 million students are
in the national public school system at all levels. Private schools
were not affected.

   More than 500 police dislodged hundreds of
demonstrating students from in front of the Communist Party
headquarters early Wednesday and moved them back toward their
universities.
   Police used no force and no arrests were reported as the
demonstrators left peacefully.
   The police action at least temporarily ended more than two days
of marches and demonstrations by thousands of students in Beijing
and Shanghai demanding more democracy.
   About 1,500 demonstrators were milling outside the ornate gate
of Zhongnanhai, the headquarters of the Communist Party, when
police arrived in jeeps at 4:20 a.m.
   The police formed a line across the six lanes of Changan
Boulevard, the capital's main thoroughfare, and began walking
toward the students.
   ``To march on the seat of government is illegal and cannot be
permitted,'' said a loudspeaker mounted on a truck. It said the
people of Beijing ``love and remember'' former Communist Party
chief Hu Yaobang, but ``some people have been using his death to
carry out irregular activities.''
   Hu, 73, died Saturday and his death brought about the
demonstrations and memorial marches. Hu, considered a liberal, was
ousted from power in early 1987 for failing to stop pro-democracy
student rallies in 1986-87.
   About 3,000 demonstrators had gathered in front of Zhongnanhai
Tuesday, but the crowd had dwindled to about half that when police
moved in.
   The police provided two buses for students and a few boarded the
vehicles while the others walked back toward their universities,
followed by policemen. The demonstrators offered no resistance.
   ``Getting arrested in China is not like getting arrested in
America,'' one student said. ``Here your whole life is ruined.''
   Although no arrests were reported, students said three of their
representatives who entered Zhongnanhai had not left the compound.
   Shortly after midnight some of the students had tried to force
their way into the walled complex, and they were shoved back
repeatedly by dozens of plainclothes policemen.
   Flowered wreaths honoring Hu and carried by some students were
torn to pieces in the struggle.
   The student rallies began Monday and early Tuesday when about
2,000 students from Beijing University and other schools marched
four hours to place banners on a monument to revolutionary heroes
in Tiananmen Square.
   Wreath-carrying students from other colleges paraded to the
monument throughout the day Tuesday, and hundreds of students
staged a daylong sit-in in front of the Great Hall of the People,
demanding freedom of speech and press and public disclosures of the
incomes of officials.
   They chanted ``Long live democracy!'' and ``Down with
dictatorship!'' Repeatedly they sang the ``Internationale'' a
socalist anthem.
   They also shouted, ``Come out Li Peng!''
   Li, China's premier, recently rejected rapid political reforms,
saying too much democracy would lead to political instability.
   Late Tuesday the students marched around the square in a rally
that swelled to about 10,000 people, including bystanders. Many of
the demonstrators walked for about 300 yards down Changan Boulevard
to Zhongnanhai while others left the procession.
   ``This is the most serious demonstration in the past 10 years,''
said one student who took part in the 1986-87 demonstrations. ``We
did not come here (to Zhongnanhai) then because it is so
sensitive.''
   It was the first major demonstration at Zhongnanhai since the
1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when radical youths known as Red
Guards tried to enter the walled compound to drag out leaders they
accused of capitalist crimes.
   In Tiananmen, the 100-acre plaza that is the symbolic center of
power in China, many peasants, other workers and young people had
joined the students.
   Some bystanders expressed support but said they doubted the
rallies for democracy would achieve anything and economic issues
were more important.
   ``You can't eat democracy,'' said one worker who complained
about inflation now at a rate of more than 30 percent in some
cities.
   Some student leaders issued seven demands and asked for a
representative from the National People's Congress, the parliament,
to meet with them.
   The demands were for a reassessment of Hu's role, an end to
anti-liberal political campaigns, revealing the incomes of leaders,
freedom of speech and press, better pay for intellectuals, an end
to a ban on demonstrations and news coverage of the student rallies.
   Administrative officials from the Congress who met student
representatives Tuesday refused to accept the demands and told the
demonstrators to go home.

   Moslem fundamentalist and secular
students battled each other for three hours with homemade guns and
bombs Tuesday at northern Rajshahi University, leaving one student
dead and 50 injured, police said.
   Police broke up the brawl with tear gas, and the university was
shut down indefinitely.
   Police contacted by telephone in Rajshahi, 120 miles northwest

<HEAD>Prosecutor Offers Drug Users a Deal, Turn in a Dealer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SNOW HILL, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For a limited time only, drug users in
Maryland's Worcester County can avoid prosecution by kicking the
habit and turning in their suppliers.
   An ad running in several weekly newspapers offers amnesty from
prosecution until May 15 and includes a phone number to the
county's special narcotics team. The ads first appeared last
Wednesday and Thursday.
   ``On Friday, we got so many phone calls we had to advise the
people who were calling to call back this week because we couldn't
process them all,'' State's Attorney B. Randall Coates said Tuesday.
   Coates, who signed the ad, wouldn't say how many people tried to
take advantage, but said it was substantially more than a dozen.
   When drug users call, authorities question them to decide
whether they are qualified for the program. Those who are are asked
to arrange a drug purchase from their dealer with an undercover
officer present, Coates said.
   ``Once we have that, we arrest the seller and give immunity to
the user,'' Coates said. The immunity is only good for the last
known drug violation that has gone unprosecuted.
   Users will be referred to the county's drug program.
   The offer does not does not apply to drug dealers, smugglers or
drug-operation financiers, the ad says. However,those offenders can
also make a deal by cooperating with authorities.
   Coates said the amnesty idea has proven effective for collecting
revenue from tax cheaters in Maryland and elsewhere, so he decided
to try it to help curb the drug trade.
   ``The purpose of the ad is to give those who do have a problem,
and want help, the opportunity to come forward and get the help
they need,'' he said.
   ``The other purpose of the ad is to make it clear to those who
are selling or smuggling in this county ... that we are serious
about prosecuting them and in fact, they cannot trust anybody, let
alone law enforcement.
   ``We are hoping they will not want to deal in Worcester County
because they can get turned in by the people they are selling to,''
Coates said. ``It's a psychological war as well as a prosecution
war.''
   Worcester, on the lower Eastern Shore, contains Ocean City,
Maryland's most popular resort. Ocean City's off-season population
of about 5,000 regularly swells to 300,000 on summer weekends,
providing another incentive for getting local dealers off the
streets before the vacation season begins.
   State Attorney General J. Joseph Curran called the program ``a
novel idea.''
   ``What it's doing is making people in the drug network nervous
and that's good from a law enforcement standpoint,'' Curran said.
``And it's letting them know that after May 15, nothing will be
tolerated.''

   A Cuban air force MiG-21 jet fighter on a
training mission crashed into three houses in Holguin, eastern
Cuba, on Tuesday, killing the pilot and injuring six people on the
ground, Cuban news reports said.
   The Soviet-made, single-seat jet crashed near a public school at
9 a.m. in the Loma de la Cruz working-class neighborhood,
destroying one house and badly damaging at least two, the Cuban
news agency Prensa Latina quoted airport officials as saying.
Holguin lies 475 miles east of Havana, the capital.
   Prensa Latina, monitored in Mexico City, identified the pilot as
Lt. Rafael Varona Nieves, 22. It said at least one civilian was in
intensive care with burns.
   The report gave no indication as to why the jet crashed. Prensa
Latina quoted a witness as saying the plane was flying ``like it
was riding a wave, moving constantly at low altitude with its
lights on'' just before it hit.

<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan rebel leaders Tuesday accused their
country's leftist government of unleashing a pre-election campaign
of repression and murder, and a human rights group offered some
unprecedented confirmation.
   ``The Sandinista government is massacring supporters of the
resistance,'' Contra director Aristides Sanchez said at a news
conference in the group's Miami headquarters. ``They are wiping out
our entire social base.''
   The Contras accused the Sandinista military of slaughtering 40
to 50 civilians over the past two months in northern Nicaraguan
provinces where the U.S.-supported rebels were once strongest,
including 13 in the town of Apantillo.
   For the first time, the widely respected human rights group
Americas Watch, which in the past has criticized the Contras,
agreed that the Sandinistas are killing suspected rebel
sympathizers in the countryside.
   ``We cannot dismiss them as isolated incidents any more,'' said
Americas Watch spokesman Juan Mendez in Washington. ``We have
written the Nicaraguan government and are waiting to see what they
are doing about this.''
   The withdrawal of armed Contras that followed a recent series of
peace agreements has left their supporters open to repression, said
Adolfo Calero, another of the seven rebel directors.
   ``They are taking advantage of the truce and the peace
agreements to eliminate all our supporters,'' Calero said.
   A physician, who calls himself ``Dr. Henry'' and who has treated
Contra troops and sympathizers inside Nicaragua for five years,
said the Sandinistas also have mined roads along the Honduran and
Costa Rican borders, resulting in the deaths of eight innocent
victims.
   On another matter, Calero charged that the Supreme Electoral
Council, newly created to oversee next year's planned national
elections, violates promises the Sandinistas made at a meeting of
Central American presidents in El Salvador to create a ``balanced''
commission.
   He said President Daniel Ortega and the Sandinista-controlled
national assembly will appoint and approve all five members,
including two representatives of the opposition.
   ``This is no way to initiate the electoral process in
Nicaragua,'' Calero said. ``And we expect the Central American
presidents to demand it be changed.''
   The Contras, who have just won a $50 million non-lethal aid
package from the United States, denied they have been pressured by
the Bush administration to return to Nicaragua to participate in
the efforts to democratize the country.
   ``I have heard nothing from the Bush administration, and I will
return to Nicaragua when I decide to, which is when the internal
opposition asks us to return,'' Calero said.

<HEAD>Dogs Search Roadsides For Missing Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police dogs began searching woods and
fields bordering 25 miles of road Tuesday for the bodies of two
young women missing and feared to be the victims of a serial killer.
   The six dogs found nothing but will continue the search
Wednesday, said Jim Martin, spokesman for the Bristol County
district attorney's office.
   Since July, police have found the bodies of eight women, ranging
in age from 25 to 36, near this port city 40 miles southwest of
Boston.
   Martin said the dogs were covering new ground as well as
rechecking areas where the other bodies were found.
   Missing are Christina Monteiro, 20, last seen in May, and Sandra
Botelho, 25, who disappeared in August.
   ``The waiting for the families is very tough. If they are out
there, I want to find them and get it over with for them,'' said
the search coordinator, Connecticut State Trooper Andrew Rebmann.
   The dogs, which found the remains of three of the eight victims,
are on loan from police forces in this state as well as
Connecticut, New Hampshire and Maine.
   The bodies were found within a 10-mile radius, most of them
along three highways. All the victims were known drug users, many
of them prostitutes, and some of the women knew each other from
dealings in New Bedford's seamy Weld Square district, police said.
   Police began getting reports last May from families looking for
the missing women, but it was only in November, after three bodies
had been found, that investigators decided the disappearances and
slayings might be related.
   Investigators believe one person, or a group working together,
killed the women.
   There have been no arrests but Martin says police have four
suspects.

<TEXT>
   A jury convicted a Christian Science
couple of murder and child abuse Tuesday in the death of their
7-year-old daughter for relying on spiritual practitioners to cure
her diabetes.
   William Hermanson, 42, and his wife Christine, 38, were charged
with third-degree murder and felony child abuse. Their daughter,
Amy, died of diabetes in 1986 after the couple tried to heal her
with prayer instead of medical treatment.
   The Hermansons face three to seven years in prison under state
sentencing guidelines. Sarasota Circuit Judge Stephen Dakan set no
sentencing date and released the Hermansons on their own
recognizance.
   ``We were disappointed and surprised,'' defense attorney Charles
Arnold said after the six-member jury deliberated three hours. ``We
will be filing motions for a new trial.''
   Jurors refused to comment as they filed silently from the
courthouse.
   Christian Science doctrine relies on prayer and spiritual
practitioners rather than on medicine to heal. However, there are
no church sanctions for followers who seek medical aid and a
Christian Science nurse who tended Amy testified that when she saw
prayer wasn't working she urged a spiritual healer to summon an
ambulance.
   The Hermansons were the first Christian Scientists in 20 years
prosecuted in the United States for denying a child medical care
for religious reasons, church representatives said. Five other
religious exemption cases are pending, three in California, one
each in Arizona and Massachusetts.
   Last week, with the jury out of the room, a state witness
testified both parents had sought medical treatment for themselves,
but not for their daughter.
   The jury never heard that testimony because the judge upheld a
defense objection that prosecutors withheld the information from
opposing attorneys before trial, violating rules of discovery.
   During the weeklong trial, defense laywers claimed the couple
were legitimately practicing the tenets of their religion, a right
they said was protected under Florida law. The defense called no
witnesses, however.
   A 1975 state law protects parents who withhold medical treatment
from their sick children if they are ``legitimately practicing''
their religious beliefs.
   Prosecutors said the case was about the child's rights, not the
parents' religious rights. Amy was sick for weeks and her parents
let her die without any medical attention, the state said.

<HEAD>Nine Yugoslav Soldiers Go On Trial For Hostile Activity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine soldiers, said to belong to a
banned Albanian separatist organization, went on trial on charges
of trying to burn down the military academy in Belgrade last
August, the state Tanjug news agency reported Tuesday.
   It said the military prosecutor's office filed charges saying
the nine hoped the blaze would spread from one building in the
complex ``to other facilities and cause great damage.'' It did not
say when the trial began.
   Only a small fire broke out in the hall, and that blaze was
quickly extinguished, with minor damage reported.
   The nine include five ethnic Albanians, three Croats and a
Slovene, said the liberal Slovenian Mladina youth weekly.
   The nine could face a maximum prison term of 15 years if
convicted.
   Also on Tuesday, Bosnia's leadership charged that Nenad
Kecmanovic, a leading candidate for the republic's representative
on Yugoslavia's collective federal presidency, passed sensitive
information to unidentified foreign intelligence agents.
   But Kecmanovic, dean of Sarajevo University in Bosnia's capital,
accused party conservatives in the republic of plotting with state
security police to discredit him for his liberal political views.
   Last week, the Bosnian legislature failed to elect either of two
official candidates for Yugoslavia's nine-man presidency after
Kecmanovic, heavily favored to win the vote, unexpectedly announced
his withdrawal from the race.
   In a letter published Monday by Belgrade's Borba newspaper,
Kecmanovic said he had to withdraw and accused the state security
service and the republic's leadership of conspiring to block his
election by falsely accusing him of having secret contacts with
foreign diplomats.

<TEXT>
   The body of an Austrian official of a medical
aid group was found beside a road in an eastern city, and police
said the victim had been shot twice in the head.
   La Republica, a Lima newspaper, said Tuesday that Josef Piescher
was killed by the Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla movement.
   But officials said the motive for the attack and circumstances
have not been determined and an investigation is continuing.
   La Republica reported a man claiming to be a member of the
Shining Path said in a phone call to a Pucallpa radio station that
Piescher was killed because he was a U.S. CIA agent conducting
anti-insurgency activities.
   The Peruvian government and Austrian Embassy said police found
Piescher's body Monday on the outskirts of Pucallpa, 355 miles
northeast of Lima.
   Austrian Ambassador Udo Ehrlich-Adam told The Associated Press
that Piescher was vice president of the private Amazon Fluvial Aid
program and he had been killed Sunday night or early Monday.
   He said Piescher was about 40 years old and had arrived in Peru
a week ago on a regular inspection visit.
   Amazon Fluival Aid is headquartered in Vienna and has its
Peruvian base in Pucallpa to provide medical assistance to Indians
living along the regional rivers, according to the ambassador.
   Piescher was the fourth foreign aid worker to be killed in Peru
since last June.
   Police blamed Shining Path guerrillas for the killing of
Constantine Gregory, 25, of Los Angeles in June and the slayings of
two French aid workers in December. Gregory, a U.S. agriculture
adviser, was killed in a hamlet near the city of Huancayo, 125
miles east of Lima.
   Police reported Shining Path guerrillas killed a mine union
leader in Cerro de Pasco and a village mayor and his wife in
Cachachi. They said the shootings occurred Sunday but reports did
not arrive here until Tuesday from the remote sites in the Andes
Mountains.
   More than 14,000 people have been killed in violence linked to
the Shining Path since the group began its fight against the
government nine years ago.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. grand jury indicted 11 people,
including the alleged ``godfather'' and ``godmother'' of a
human-sacrificing cult of drug smugglers blamed for 15 deaths, on
drug charges Tuesday.
   The alleged ``godfather,'' Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo; Sara
Aldrete Villarreal, the alleged ``godmother,'' and the other nine
were indicted by a federal grand jury in McAllen, Texas.
   They were charged with conspiracy to import marijuana, importing
marijuana, conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute the drug
and possession with intent to distribute, authorities said.
   Constanzo, Aldrete and four others remained at large. Four men
are in custody in Mexico and another suspect was arrested Monday in
Houston.
   Meanwhile, a Mexican police official said most of the 15 bodies
exhumed in a rural area over the past week were those of drug
traffickers and not random sacrificial victims.
   Juan Benitez Ayala, commander of the Federal Judicial Police in
this border city, said the investigation has shifted to Mexico
City, where officials believe several murders are linked to Adolfo
de Jesus Constanzo, 26, the alleged ``godfather.''
   Benitez refused to comment on statements he made to reporters
Monday, when he speculated that Aldrete, 24, may have been killed
by Constanzo because she knew too much about the organization.
   U.S. officials said they thought she was still alive, even
though Mexican officials reported finding some of her personal
effects in an apartment containing an apparent occult altar.
   ``It just might be a put-on,'' said Cameron County Sheriff Alex
Perez in Brownsville, Texas. ``If they did find a purse or found a
passport, that may have been just a trick by Sara and Constanzo to
(make it appear) she is dead ... I think she is still alive.''
   He said the investigation in Matamoros has shown that most of
the 13 bodies unearthed at the Santa Elena Ranch 20 miles west of
Matamoros last week and two found Sunday at a nearby cooperative
farm were those of drug smugglers.
   ``I have information about only four people who were
sacrificed,'' Benitez said, adding that ``the great majority were
drug traffickers.''
   Of the 15 victims, ``some were tortured, some were only shot,
and there were the young people who were sacrificed.''
   University of Texas student Mark Kilroy, 21, of Santa Fe, Texas,
abducted from a Matamoros street, was one of the four sacrificial
victims not involved in the drug business, Benitez said.
   He said at least eight and possibly more of the victims were
either associates or rivals of the Constanzo group.
   Officials have searched at least three residences in Mexico City
linked to the group, Benitez said. ``There are a lot of murders in
the Colonia Roma (area of Mexico City) connected to Constanzo,'' he
said.
   Benitez said a woman arrested Sunday in Mexico City, Maria
Teresa Quintana, 20, was deeply involved in the occult practices of
some members of the group, who sought magical protection for their
smuggling.
   Her brother, Martin Quintana, is one of three men for whom new
federal drug-related warrants were issued Monday in Brownsville.
   Quintana, and another named in the new warrants, Malio Fabio,
are believed to have participated in the occult faction of the
Constanzo organization.
   One man arrested on those warrants, Serafin Hernandez Rivera of
Brownsville, was arraigned Tuesday in Houston, where he was
arrested.
   Benitez said Hernandez' father, Brigido, former owner of the
Santa Elena Ranch, is being sought in Mexico. Serafin Hernandez
Rivera's son, Serafin Jr. and brother, Elio, faced federal Mexican
arraignment Tuesday in Matamoros. Hernandez Rivera's brother,
Ovidio, also is being sought in connection with the slayings.
   Sheriff Perez said officials had confirmed that Constanzo and
two other men took a flight from McAllen, Texas, to Mexico City the
day the first 12 bodies were found. He said investigators believe
they then flew to Miami.
   Perez said it appeared Ms. Aldrete did not accompany them, but
he would not elaborate.
   Some of the drug ring members practiced human sacrifices in a
belief, apparently influenced by the Palo Mayombe religion, that
the slayings and mutilations might protect them magically. A movie,
``The Believers,'' which deals with a violent cult, influenced the
sect's members, according to confessions, officials said.
   Actor Martin Sheen, who starred in the movie, said Monday: ``I
am too shocked and deeply upset that anything I'm involved with
could be so misinterpreted and lead to such a heinous crime.''
   Sheen, who also is known for his peace activism, starred as a
police psychiatrist investigating the cult in the John Schlesinger
film.

   North Korea accused the United States of ``aerial

Tuesday.
   A broadcast by the Korean Central News Agency, monitored in
Tokyo, said: ``The United States let U-2 strategic reconnaissance
plan fly ... along the military demarcation line at about 9:00 a.m.
this morning (Tuesday) to commit aerial espionage against the
northern half of Korea.''
   ``Such espionage was conducted 15 times in April,'' the report
said, claiming that U.S. reconnaissance flights had spied on North
Korea 85 times recently.
   KCNA also accused the United States of using an E-3A AWACS plane
in South Korea ``to spy on the ... northern half of Korea.''
   An AWACS (airborne warning and control system) plane is used to
detect and track aircraft hundreds of miles away.
   The United States has about 42,000 troops based in South Korea
under a defense treaty. The communist North and capitalist South
have been discussing ways to ease tensions on the peninsula,
divided since 1945.

police agent died in the hospital.
   The government said that drug traffickers have been operating at

   The chairman of Exxon Corp. on Tuesday angrily
defended the company's response to the Alaska oil spill and blamed
delays in the cleanup on indecisive regulatory agencies.
   ``The most damaging that's being said about us is that we've
delayed it, we're very slow to respond, and so forth. That's
absolutely not true,'' Lawrence G. Rawl said at a news conference.
   Rawl said the plan to clean up Prince William Sound and 305
miles of shoreline, announced by the company Monday, had been
approved by all necessary agencies. The Exxon Valdez ran aground
March 24, spilling 10 million gallons of crude oil in the nation's
worst oil spill.
   Exxon promised to have most of the beaches and rocks clean by
mid-September.
   Some officials, including Adm. Paul Yost, head of the Coast
Guard, have expressed skepticism that the cleanup can be
accomplished that rapidly.
   ``What does he want us to do, put in a deadline next year so
that he can say it's too damn late, that deadline you got in
there?'' Rawl said, adding, ``You're damned if you do and you're
damned if you don't.''
   The cleanup will involve at least 4,000 workers who must contend
with high tides and rocky shores in hard-to-get-to places.
   ``Logistical problems are horrendous,'' Rawl said. ``These are
not meant as excuses, I just want you to know that you just can't
cover this place up as if you had a sand beach somewhere.''
   ``Now I'm not going to tell you that if you go up there a year
from now you won't find some black places on some rocks,'' Rawl
said, ``but we're going to make every effort to get it off. I am
telling you that a year from now the toxicity will be eliminated.''
   Yost, who left Tuesday for Washington to brief President Bush,
declined to comment on Rawl's outburst but said he was glad Rawls
felt confident the cleanup could be accomplished.
   ``I'm on his side,'' Yost said. ``I say let's give him a shot at
it.''
   He repeated his reservations about whether Exxon could beat
Alaska's notorious weather and brief summer and get the beaches
cleaned by winter.
   But he said there was ``nothing personal'' in his reservations.
   Rawl repeatedly defended Exxon's reaction to the spill, saying
contingency plans were foiled by a lack of decisive action by the
Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation and the Coast Guard.
   He said Exxon had enough oil dispersant on hand to begin
spraying March 25, about 30 hours after the spill, and was awaiting
approval from the state and the Coast Guard.
   Records Exxon filed with the state after the accident said
controlling the Valdez spill would have required 500,000 gallons of
dispersant. When the tanker hit the reef, according to earlier
reports, Exxon had only 3,795 gallons on hand, and just 110,000 six
days later.
   ``I'm not trying to say we're not responsible,'' Rawl said. ``It
was our ship, we spilled the oil, we intend to clean it up and we
intend to do it promptly.''

   Cheney, now in the midst of slashing the fiscal 1990 budget to
comply with a White House-congressional compromise, will return
immediately to Washington on Thursday evening, according to the

   The first researcher to obtain room
temperature fusion offered his services Tuesday to one of the
nation's top nuclear laboratories in hopes of getting support for
his research in return.
   University of Utah professor Stanley Pons said that in helping
Los Alamos National Laboratory scientists to duplicate his fusion
experiments, he could gain their collaboration on future research.
   Los Alamos thus far has been unable to confirm the results that
Pons and his British colleague, Martin Fleischmnann, obtained last
month at the University of Utah.
   ``I don't think there can be any collaboration until they start
getting a result. And so it's my determination now to make sure
that they do,'' Pons said.
   Pons said Monday he had sustained a controlled fusion reaction
more than 800 hours in a small flask containing ``heavy'' water,
which contains the isotope deuterium, and a palladium electrode. He
said recent tests produced roughly eight times the energy consumed.
   Pons told a news conference that the results he and Fleischmann
obtained had been partly verified by more than 60 university and
private laboratories around the world.
   In Stanford, Calif., on Tuesday, Stanford University professor
Robert Huggins said that in trying to duplicate the Utah work he
had determined that the energy produced may have been caused by
fusion and did not come from a chemical reaction, as some other
scientists have speculated.
   Pons, who left Tuesday without a commitment from Los Alamos,
said he was able to find one possible reason why scientists here
had been unable to duplicate his experiment. The palladium
electrodes they used are not in the same form as the rods he used
in Utah, Pons said.
   Pons said Los Alamos has sophisticated spectrometers and other
precise measuring devices that could be useful in confirming the
results of his research.
   ``One of the purposes in coming down was to see if there is
equipment that I could use that would lead to confirmation or more
substantiation of some of the new experiments that we are doing,''
he said.
   Pons said his research may open the door to practical
application of nuclear fusion, in which tremendous amounts of
energy are released when the cores of two hydrogen atoms fuse.
   Scientists in the past had been unable to fuse atoms except at
temperatures in the millions of degrees.
   Nuclear power plants produce energy through fission, in which
atoms are split. The process requires radioactive fuel and
generates large amounts of radioactive waste; fusion does not.

   A senior official in former president
Milton Obote's ruling party was convicted of five counts of murder
Tuesday and sentenced to death.
   Uganda's High Court ound Haji Musa Ssebirumbi, 47, guilty of
joining six soldiers in the 1981 beating deaths of a policeman and
four residents of the village of Kikandwa.
   The village is about 40 miles north of Kampala in an area known
as the Luwero Triangle, where thousands of people thought unloyal
to Obote were killed by government soldiers and paramilitary groups
between 1981 and 1985.
   Ssebirumbi was a member of the Central Executive Committee of
Obote's ruling Uganda People's Congress and a prominent businessmen
in Kampala. Obote was overthrown in 1985 and Sseibirumbi was
arrested two years later.

   Yippie founder Abbie Hoffman committed
suicide with a ``massive overdose'' of the drug phenobarbital, the
coroner said Tuesday.
   ``The death was from the combined effects of phenobarbital and
alcohol,'' Coroner Dr. Thomas Rosko said at a news conference.
   Hoffman, who held fast to his anti-establishment convictions and
made his points with searing humor, was found dead April 12 at his
home in New Hope. He was 52.
   ``I think it is likely that he literally fell asleep and died in
his sleep,'' Rosko said. ``Other than that, what occurred in his
last hours is strictly speculation.''
   The autopsy found the residue of about 150 pills, several times
the lethal dose even without the presence of alcohol, the coroner
said. Phenobarbital, a barbiturate, is a long-acting sedative and
an anticonvulsant.
   Hoffman's blood alcohol level was .20, twice the legal limit in
Pennsylvania, Rosko said.
   The coroner said laboratory tests showed two other drugs were
present in Hoffman's system. But he said the small quantities of
propranolol, used for cardiovascular conditions, and
benzodiazepine, a class of drugs including the sedative Valium, had
no connection with Hoffman's death.
   Although Hoffman was considered a self-taught expert in drugs,
Rosko said there was no evidence he was using drugs for pleasure.
   The coroner said he relayed his findings to Hoffman's family
minutes before his news conference.
   Although Rosko ruled the death a suicide, Hoffman's brother,
Jack, held out hope it was an accident.
   ``Abbie, as many of you know, was somewhat careless with pills
and we always warned him about this kind of thing,'' Jack Hoffman
said at a news conference in Worcester, Mass., the family's
hometown.
   Hoffman's mother, Florence, declined to comment.
   The day after her son's body was found, she speculated that he
had committed suicide, saying he had sounded depressed in recent
telephone conversations. But the next day, she said the family no
longer suspected suicide.
   Other relatives and friends mentioned suicide. Rosko said Friday
there was no indication then that Hoffman killed himself but that
preliminary results were inconclusive. Rosko's autopsy report last
week also did not elaborate on a trickle of blood reported found
caked under Hoffman's nostril.
   In June 1988, Hoffman said he was taking painkillers a doctor
had prescribed for injuries he suffered in an auto accident.
   Hoffman was last seen alive on April 11 by a girlfriend of his
landlord. He was found dead by a neighbor, Michael Waldron, who
told police Hoffman had been depressed about the car accident.
   A memorial service planned Wednesday in Worcester, Mass., is to
include a peace march from his mother's house to Temple Emanuel,
which Hoffman attended as a child.
   ``I want it to be a celebration,'' said Jack Hoffman. ``I want
everybody to be singing and swinging and swaying.'' Folk singer
Pete Seeger volunteered to lead the march and sing protest songs,
he said.
   Hoffman's family has been flooded with letters, telegrams and
condolence calls from entertainers, even foreign embassies, his
brother said. ``I'm not going to say which,'' he said. ``Let's just
say some of our NATO friends.''
   Jack Hoffman said his brother died nearly broke, despite book
contracts and success on the lecture circuit. ``He gave just about
everything away,'' he said. ``He didn't die with a Rolex. He died
with a full heart.''
   Hoffman rose to prominence with the Chicago Seven, a group of
radicals tried on charges of conspiring to disrupt the bloody 1968
Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The others were Thomas
Hayden, Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Reynard C. Davis, Lee Weiner
and John Froines.
   Theatrics at the 4{-month-long federal trial included
wild-haired defendants and a 74-year-old judge, Julius Hoffman, who
ordered Bobby Seale, a former Black Panther leader, bound and
gagged in the courtroom. Seale's trial was later severed from the
others.
   Hoffman and four others were acquitted of conspiracy but
convicted of crossing state lines with intent to riot. Their
convictions were overturned.
   During a reunion of the Chicago Seven last year, Hoffman
characterized himself as ``an American dissident.''
   Hoffman started the loosely organized Yippie movement, or Youth
International Party, in 1968 to bring together radicals to protest
the government and the Vietnam War.
   Hoffman went underground in 1974 to avoid trial on cocaine
possession charges. He emerged nearly seven years later and
revealed he had lived in upstate New York and had undergone plastic
surgery.
   He moved to the Philadelphia suburb of New Hope several years
ago during the height of a losing battle against a Delaware River
pumping station.
   Besides his brother and mother, Hoffman leaves a sister,
Phyllis; three children from his two marriages; and his long-time
companion, Johanna Lawrenson. Hoffman's ashes were given to Ms.
Lawrenson, his brother said.

<HEAD>Israeli Official Says Egypt Accepts Election Idea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Foreign Ministry official said Tuesday after
returning from Cairo that Egypt accepts the idea of elections in
the occupied territories proposed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   Foreign Ministry Director-General Reuven Merhav said Egyptian
Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid and other Egyptian officials
reacted positively to Shamir's plan for elections to choose
representatives with whom Israel could negotiate Palestinian
autonomy.
   ``They accept, rather than support, the principle of
elections,'' said Merhav, who returned Monday from a four-day visit
to Egypt. ``I made it very clear the only way to get things moving
was through elections ... I think at this stage the principle was
accepted.''
   Merhav said the Egyptians raised no conditions for their support
and did not allude to statements by President Hosni Mubarak that
the vote should be held under international supervision.
   Nor did the Egyptians refer to the insistence of the Palestine
Liberation Organization that Israel withdraw from the occupied
territories prior to balloting, he said.
   ``There was no talk of international supervision. This was not
in the cards at all,'' Merhav told reporters. ``The (issue of the)
PLO also was not raised.''
   On Sunday, during Merhav's visit, Egyptian officials criticized
Israel's handing of the 16-month Palestinian uprising and demanded
a positive Israeli response to the PLO's revised stand recognizing
Israel's right to exist.
   The officials made no formal statement on Shamir's election
plan. PLO chief Yasser Arafat has demanded Israeli withdrawal and
international supervision as conditions for accepting elections.
   Shamir proposed his plan at a meeting with President Bush last
week. It essentially mirrors the 1978 U.S.-sponsored Camp David
accords, rejected by the Palestinians because they promise only
self-rule under Israeli control.
   Both Shamir's plan and Camp David call for later negotiations on
the final status of the Gaza Strip and West Bank, occupied by
Israel since the 1967 Middle East war.
   The one change in Shamir's plan is the offer to hold elections
to choose Palestinian represenatives to negotiate an interim
settlement with Israel. Previous Israeli proposals called for
elections only after an autonomy agreement was worked out.

<TEXT>
   Two sisters who kidded each other about getting
rich were revealed Tuesday as the very wealthy holders of one of
four winning tickets from a world-record $69.9 million Lotto
jackpot.
   Linda and Barbara Lambert will share almost $17.5 million. They
join two family clans announced as winners of two other tickets
Monday, Illinois State Lottery officials said.
   The identity of the fourth winner has not been revealed.
   At a news conference, the Lamberts described their feelings when
the lottery was drawn Saturday night.
   ``She called me and said, `We won,''' Linda said. ``By the third
time she said it, I knew she wasn't kidding.''
   Linda Lambert, 39, is a high school biology teacher and lives in
Forest Lake, northwest of Chicago.
   Her sister, who would say only that she was the older of the
two, lives in Chicago and is a solid-waste program manager for the
federal Environmental Protection Agency.
   Linda Lambert said she and her sister played Lotto regularly and
once joked about opening a business ``slinging pizzas'' if they
ever won. She said she plans to use her share of the money to write
children's books, but has no immediate plans to quit her job.
   She said she kept her good fortune a secret from co-workers
Monday.
   ``It was torture, but it was also a lot of fun because everybody
was telling lottery stories,'' she said.
   The sisters bought 37 Lotto tickets last week. The winning
ticket was among 15 Barbara Lambert bought at a newsstand in a
Chicago Transit Authority train station on the Northwest Side.
   ``I went back and told the owner, `I heard you sold the winning
ticket,' and he said, `Yeah, and I'll bet you got it.'
   ``He didn't believe me so I told him I'd bet him $50,000,''
Barbara said. ``Eventually, we settled on a lunch bet.''
   One of the other winning tickets was bought by MaryAnn Dixon,
37, on behalf of herself, husband Daniel and 10-month-old daughter,
Kate, as well as her parents _ Louis and Mary Matlosz of Elizabeth,
N.J. _ and two brothers and a sister and their families in New
Jersey.
   The other drawing winner, Ron Miller, 36, who is married and has
a 10-year-old daughter, plans to split his share with brother
Scott, 29, of Chandler, Ariz., and a brother in Stafford, Texas.
   The final figure for the jackpot, boosted by four winner-less
drawings and a frenzy of ticket-buying last week, was $69,940,000,
said Lottery Director Sharon Sharp.
   The winners beat odds of 12.9 million-to-1 to pick the six
winning numbers from 1 to 54: 3, 14, 32, 40, 46 and 54.

<TEXT>
   Taffylike tar mixed with seaweed was
scoured off a beach Tuesday at the end of spectacular Resurrection
Bay near Seward, the first town outside Prince William Sound to
suffer oil on its shores.
   High tides and southerly wind off the Gulf of Alaska pushed the
crude oil up the fjordlike channel, where two Coast Guard
oil-skimming ships were out of action because the goo gummed up
their pumps, Deputy Seward City Manager Darryl Schaefermeyer said.
   ``We put protective booming up around the critical (salmon)
spawning streams in the bay four weeks ago,'' Schaefermeyer said.
``But as far as the rest of the bay there was no effective way of
booming it all off.''
   The Coast Guard reported fresh sightings of oil on remote
beaches on the Kenai Peninsula. A Valdez center for cleaning
oil-fouled birds said at least 1,850 birds had died from the spill,
along with 328 sea otters. The center has cleaned and released 22
birds.
   Resurrection Bay, with a channel 600 feet deep, is about 125 air
miles from where the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24,
dumping more than 10 million gallons of Alaska crude oil into
Prince William Sound.
   Adm. Paul Yost, the Coast Guard chief, approved Exxon's cleanup
plan for the sound Monday, but expressed reservations about whether
it could succeed.
   Lawrence Rawl, chairman of Exxon Corp., reacted angrily Tuesday.
At a news conference in New York, he said he was confident that
most of the beaches and rocks would be clean by mid-September.
   ``Now I'm not going to tell you that if you go up there a year
from now you won't find some black places on some rocks, but we're
going to make every effort to get it off,'' he said. ``I am telling
you that a year from now the toxicity will be eliminated.''
   Yost, before leaving for Washington on Tuesday to brief
President Bush, said he believed Exxon's cleanup plan was a good
start.
   ``Exxon is committed to doing this. I say let's give him (Rawl)
a shot at it,'' he said.
   But he said he still had reservations that Exxon could clean the
beaches by winter, and added that if efforts lagged, he would force
the company to throw more people and gear into the task.
   Yost gave Exxon until May 1 to complete a cleanup plan for
outside the sheltered sound, where the work is likely to be even
harder along the wild Gulf of Alaska coast.
   In Boston, Massachusetts state Sen. Carol Amick said she was
organizing a one-day boycott throughout New England on May 2 to
protest Exxon's ``failure to respond'' to the environmental
disaster.
   A sizeable but undetermined amount of oil has seeped out of the
sound and into the gulf, where currents carried it southwest along
the Kenai Peninsula. A weekend storm pushed oil north onto hundreds
of miles of rocky beaches and far up the bays and inlets, including
Resurrection Bay.
   Huge swells along the exposed coast will often prevent boats or
crews from working close to the beach, said Peter Fitzmaurice,
chief ranger at Kenai Fjords National Park, which stretches from
Seward southwest along most of the southern coast of the peninsula.
   ``They can work the inner bays, but if a big swell comes in,
there's no way they'll be able to work near the rocks,'' he said.
   Farther southwest near the end of the peninsula, skimming
operations have been on hold for several days because of waves up
to 12 feet. experts say he ships are designed to work in waves of
no more than five feet.
   A huge Soviet oil skimmer able to process far more oil in much
heavier seas than skimmers now available is scheduled to arrive
Thursday in Seward.
   ``Everyone has some pretty high hopes for this Russian ship,''
Schaefermeyer said. ``It's pretty big, 430 feet, and it apparently
has the capacity for getting far down into the water to get at some
of the stuff you can't see.''
   The state ferry Aurora, carrying 20 skiffs on a cleanup mission
since early this month, was greeted by a balloon-carrying crowd as
it returned to Valdez for six hours to resupply.
   The skiffs round up oil with floating booms, then tow it to a
barge for disposal by a ``super-sucker'' vacuum hose. Workers said
the technique had been used to remove 200,000 gallons of oil from
the water.
   Coast Guard aircraft reported oil washing ashore all along the
Kenai Peninsula headlands, and spotters saw ``significant shoreline
impact'' at Lone, Perry and Culross islands in Prince William
Sound, the Coast Guard said.
   The Coast Guard sent three skimmers to Perry Island but
operations stalled because pumps were unable to remove the
now-tarlike oil from the skimmers.
   Exxon said it had recovered 1.13 million gallons of oil _ about
11 percent of the amount spilled.
   Meantime, Exxon and the oil pipeline consortium Alyeska were
given 90 days warning Tuesday that environmental groups intend to
sue them to ensure cleanup of America's worst oil spill.
   The Sierra Club, Wilderness Society and Audubon Society were
joined by an array of local, state and national organizations in
serving the notice, which is required under federal resource
conservation law.
   In Washington, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said Tuesday
that the spill has blackened the image of the oil industry.
   ``Every oil company will have to confront the images created by
the spill,'' Watkins said in a speech to the National Petroleum
Council, a group of private energy officials that advises the
energy secretary on policy issues.
   He said his department would try to persuade Congress and the
public that the spill was an aberration that should not halt future
oil development in Alaska. Watkins said his department will
continue to lobby for legislation permitting oil companies to
explore for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

<HEAD>U-2C Spy Plane Sets Flight Records Before Being Retired</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's last remaining
U-2C spy plane, which photographed clandestine missiles in Cuba and
military bases in the Soviet Union, set eight records Tuesday on
one of its last flights.
   The plane, commonly called simply a U-2, is being retired and
put on display after 34 years of service.
   It was the second day the once-supersecret surveillance plane
made special flights from this desert base 60 miles north of Los
Angeles to try and set new records before being retired.
   Lockheed test pilot Ron Williams, 54, shattered existing
altitude records in the plane's weight class by about 40 percent,
according to Lockheed spokesman Nick Durutta.
   The records include reaching an altitude of 72,720 without a
payload and in horizontal flight. It also climbed to various
altitudes faster than previous record holders.
   The aircraft had previously flown at such altitudes but the
marks were not verified. The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration and the Federation Aeronautique International must
still confirm Tuesday's records.
   Lockheed reported that on Monday the plane soared to 73,700 feet
in 12 minutes and 13 seconds, shattering by more than 20,000 feet
the previous altitude record for a plane in its weight class.
   ``There's only one U-2C in existence that is still flying,''
said Maj. Susan Randle of Strategic Air Command Headquarters at
Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska.
   The last U-2C will be flown to Warner-Robbins Air Force Base in
Georgia on April 26 to be put on display.
   The Air Force will continue to fly the updated U-2R model built
in 1981.
   Because of the craft's top-secret nature the military has never
confirmed the exact number built in 1955 by Lockheed at its
top-secret ``skunk works'' plant, but it has been estimated at 57.
   It was a U-2C that brought back the photographic proof during
the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 that the Soviets had installed
missiles in that island country just off the coast of Florida.
   It was also a U-2C that the late Francis Gary Powers was
piloting over the Soviet Union when it was shot down in 1960. His
capture helped chill the Cold War even more as Soviet Premier
Nikita Khruschev canceled a summit meeting with President Dwight
Eisenhower.
   More recently, U-2s were used to record the eruptions of Mount
St. Helens and to provide information to firefighters battling last
summer's blazes in Yellowstone National Park.
   The plane, a forerunner of the stealth fighter, was designed by
Lockheed to fly undetected nearly 14 miles above the Earth. Several
were shot down on missions, and many crashed in flight because the
planes were so tricky to fly due to their thin wings. The Air Force
loaned several to NASA-Ames Research Laboratories at Moffett Field,
near San Francisco.
   The plane's days became numbered with the advent of satellites
and a new generation of spy planes, including the SR-71 Blackbird.

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States said Tuesday that it is becoming
more difficult to monitor compliance with a proposed
chemical-weapons ban because of greater sophistication in the
chemical industry.
   Ambassador Max L. Friedersdorf, addressing the 40-nation
Conference on Disarmament, said determining that there are no
hidden stocks of chemical weapons and no secret production
facilities remain ``our most formidable challenge.''
   He said the challenge is becoming more difficult because of the
trend in the chemical industry to produce multipurpose facilities
that can easily be converted to manufacture chemical-weapon agents.
   Measures to prevent cheating are one of the main issues that
have prevented an agreement on a treaty to ban the use, production
and stockpiling of chemical weapons. The negotiations are now in
their 21st year.

   A woman and three children were found
slain in a home at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac Tuesday after her
husband turned back efforts by relatives to see her for two days,
police and neighbors said.
   The husband, 36-year-old Lee Artis Carter, was taken into
custody and transported to a hospital for cuts on his wrists caused
by a razor blade, firemedics Chief T.L. Bryant said.
   Carter, who works as a bagger at the Gunter Air Force Base
commissary, was charged with capital murder, said Montgomery County
Disrict Attorney Jimmy Evans.
   Police spokesman Wyatt Gantt confirmed that a multiple homicide
occurred at the Carter home, a single-story, brown brick residence
in a middle-class neighborhood, but he declined to release
additional details.
   Bryant said firemedics were called Tuesday to the City Jail to
treat Carter for wounds to both wrists. At Jackson Hospital, he was
treated and returned to police custody, hospital spokeswoman Vicki
Jones said.
   Police would not say when or how the cuts occurred.
   Carter's wife, 35-year-old Nell Carter, worked for the state
Department of Corrections' ``Free by Choice'' program, an anti-drug
effort involving lectures by inmates on the dangers of drug abuse.
Corrections spokeswoman Debbie Herbert confirmed that Mrs. Carter
was one of the victims.
   Neighbors said the other victims were her three children. School
officials identified them as 13-year-old Shameka Davis, 8-year-old
Natasha Carter and 7-year-old Lee Artis Carter Jr. Neighbors said
Carter was the father of the younger two children. But police
refused to confirm the victims' identities.
   Neighbor Mark Carter, no relation to Lee Artis Carter, said he
saw police at the home early Tuesday. He said he talked with Bubba
Davis, Nell Carter's brother. Mark Carter quoted Davis as saying
Lee Artis Carter would not let Davis in the house Monday and that
Davis came back that night with police.
   ``They had been trying to get in touch with her all day Sunday
and Monday,'' Mark Carter quoted Davis as saying. ``He said she
didn't go to work Monday and the kids didn't go to school.

   Joe and Lorraine Caldera celebrated their 25th

share of last week's $13.1 million Lotto jackpot.
   The Calderas and four relatives held the only winning ticket for
the drawing April 12.
   ``Not bad. Twenty-five years, and what a way to celebrate!''
said Mrs. Caldera at the state lottery office in the World Trade
Center.
   They got the good news Thursday when returned home from Rome,
where Caldera, an insurance sales manager, had attended a
convention.
   ``We were ready to sit down, unpack and relax, and we came home
to a house full of screaming people,'' said Mrs. Caldera, 44. ``I
thought they had quite a nerve throwing a party in my own house.''
   Then it sank in: She and her husband, along with her mother, her
brother and his wife, and a brother-in-law, would split the jackpot.
   ``It was chaos. I had no idea what was going on,'' Caldera said.
``I thought at first it was a party for our anniversary, but
thought, No, they wouldn't do that at 3 in the afternoon.
   ``We just dropped the luggage. I was in a state of shock.''
   For the next 20 years, a check for about $500,000 will arrive,
to be split by the Calderas; Richard and Helen Colgan of Mineola;
Alice Colgan of Queens; and John Seychel of Queens.
   The group played the same number for nine months.

   A passenger who made a bomb threat on an American
Airlines flight to Puerto Rico was detained Tuesday after the
jetliner returned safely to Miami International Airport,
authorities said.
   No bomb was found aboard the plane, police said.
   About half an hour after Flight 975 departed for San Juan, the
suspect indicated he was in possession of a bomb, and the pilot
directed the plane back to Miami, said FBI spokesman Paul Miller.
   The A-300 Airbus carrying 205 passengers and a crew of nine
landed safely in Miami at about 2:50 p.m., and the passengers used
chutes to quickly evacuate on a remote section of the field, Miller
said.
   Two passengers suffered minor injuries coming down the chute,
Miller said. They were treated at a local hospital and released.
   Armando Rosado, 21, of Ponce, Puerto Rico, was arrested and
charged with interference with flight crew members and false
information and threats, Miller said.
   No explosive was found on the plane by the police bomb squad
dispatched to search the aircraft, he said.
   Rosado was taken to the Metropolitan Correctional Center in
south Dade County to await a federal hearing Wednesday.
   The passengers were to travel on to San Juan Tuesday night
aboard different carriers, airline spokesman Ed Stewart said from
American headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas.

   A frenzied, cocaine-fueled night of
drinking and dancing by a winery worker preceded the savage spree
that left six family members and a co-worker dead, friends said
Tuesday.
   ``He party, party, party all the time _ run around all night,''
one of Salcido's friends said in an interview with the San
Francisco Examiner, recalling Ramon Salcido's extended binge before
Friday's killings. ``He drink everything _ beer, wine, tequila.''
   Between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. Friday, Salcido's wife,
mother-in-law, two sisters-in-law, and his co-worker were
butchered, shot or both. The next day, three of Salcido's daughters
were found with their throats cut, two of them dead.
   The surviving girl, 3-year-old Carmina, is recovering in
Petaluma Valley Hospital. She told investigators her father cut her
and her sisters.
   Sonoma County Sheriff's officials revealed in a news release
late Tuesday that Salcido may have been in San Francisco sometime
after the spree.
   The sheriff's office, in discounting a reported sighting of
Salcido at the Mexican consulate in Sacramento late Friday morning,
said it conflicted with a ``more substantial contact'' with him in
San Francisco.
   Officials declined to reveal further details.
   Salcido's friends said the binge started Wednesday night, a day
after he was served with Fresno County court papers ordering him to
pay $511 a month support for a 4{-year-old daughter from another
marriage, plus nearly $6,000 more to the county for back payments.
   Salcido, broke, was outraged. He told friends his ex-wife had
run off with another man. She has been in hiding under police
protection since the attacks.
   A friend said Salcido, 28, cornered ``a bunch of coke'' from a
source in San Rafael on Wednesday, then returned home to Boyes Hot
Springs, a few miles from Sonoma, and started hitting automatic
teller machines for cash.
   The FBI said when the machines refused to spit out any more
money, Salcido tried to sell his car.
   On Thursday night, the bars closed and the drugs gone, Salcido
staggered stoned into the Sonoma Mission Inn, a top-class,
$200-a-night resort complex a half-mile from Salcido's home in a
rundown section of the town.
   Salcido tried to get a room. The clerk said they were full.
   ``I think it's maybe the coke he did'' that set off the rampage,
said another friend. ``He (used) five or six grams ... and he got
crazy.''
   Salcido has been charged with four of the murders and is sought
on a federal warrant for flight to avoid prosecution.
   In Santa Rosa, Sheriff Dick Michaelsen said the hunt for Salcido
was centered in Sonoma County and adjoining Marin County and that
the fugitive might be laying low. But the FBI said he might be
heading for Mexico.
   In San Francisco, warrant-supporting affidavits filed against
Salcido in U.S. Magistrate's Court this week revealed that he left
a note seeking forgiveness and blaming the law for the rampage,
appearing to refer to the court order in the child support case.
   ``Forgive me, God, but this law made me do it,'' the note read
in Spanish. ``We could live better, me and my children, but what
can I do?''
   The note was found inside his blood-spattered car along with a
.22-caliber semi-automatic pistol and Salcido's Social Security
card.
   The court papers also said that Kenneth Butti, who survived an
attack outside his ranch Friday, told a detective Salcido had tried
to shoot Butti's wife but the gun malfunctioned.
   Butti said ``he could hear the click as the hammer fell, but
that there was no explosion,'' according to the court papers.

   A plane searching for two sailors missing from a
freighter that sank in stormy seas spotted a body floating in the
Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday, a Coast Guard official said.
   Twenty-three rescued sailors nursed bruises and waited for news
while long-range aircraft and several merchant vessels fanned out
over 480 square miles of ocean about 400 miles southeast of Cape
Cod, where the Star of Alexandria sank Monday.
   The body was spotted by one of three Coast Guard planes, Coast
Guard Petty Officer Mike Milan said in New York.
   Surviving crew members said one of the missing sailors
apparently injured himself when he jumped overboard as the ship
went down.
   ``The feeling is that was him,'' Milan said. ``But we haven't
given up hope of finding the other man.''
   Milan said the second man had a chance to survive because he was
uninjured and wearing a life jacket when he washed off a life raft.
   ``The water temperature is warm enough that he could survive
indefinitely,'' Milan said.
   ``One way or another we hope to wrap this thing up tomorrow,''
he said.
   The surviving crew members, who were transferred to the Coast
Guard cutter Chilula from the British freighter Ravenscraig earlier
in the day, should arrive in Boston late Wednesday, he said.
   ``The crew will be interviewed as to what happened on the ship
and then the company that owned the ship will take care of it from
there,'' Petty Officer Gary Rives said.
   He said it still was unclear what caused the sinking.
   The Ravenscraig picked up the 23 multinational crew members
after rescue planes spotted a lifeboat and a life raft and guided
the 950-foot vessel to the scene, said Petty Officer Joe Gibson. A
second life raft was recovered, but empty, he said.
   The 500-foot Star of Alexandria was bound for New York City from
Athens when crew members reported it began taking on water in
12-foot seas and winds of between 30 mph and 35 mph, Gibson said.
   The Star of Alexandria was registered in England and designed to
carry bulk freight. The ship is owned by Caribene Investments Ltd.
of Gibraltar, according to Bureau Veritas, a Paris-based shipping
registry.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Richard Cheney has told
President Bush that he favors building a railroad-based version of
the MX nuclear missile and scrapping the planned Midgetman missile,
The Washington Post reported.
   Cheney made his views known in a meeting Tuesday afternoon at
the White House before leaving for a NATO meeting in Europe, the
newspaper reported in its Wednesday editions.
   But a White House source who declined to be named said no
decision was made at the meeting, which was called as the next step
in the long fight over whether to build a rail-based version of the
10-warhead MX or up to 500 of the single-warhead Midgetman.
   No timetable has been set for making a decison, said the source,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Both weapons are designed as successors to the Minuteman, which
has formed the heart of the nation's land-based atomic missile
force for two decades. The Pentagon has also built 50 MX weapons
for deployment in silos in Nebraska and Wyoming.
   If Cheney favors the rail-based MX over the Midgetman, he would
be taking the position long favored by the Air Force. Service
officials have proposed creating 25 trains, each with two MX
missiles aboard, and keeping them on western military reservations,
to be moved out onto civilian tracks in time of crisis.
   The Midgetman has chiefly been supported by Democrats, who
control Congress.
   Cheney is scheduled to appear before Congress next week to
unveil Bush's plans for amending the Pentagon budget proposed
earlier this year by then-President Reagan. Bush has to approve $10
billion worth of budget cuts to meet lowered spending targets.

   Explosions blacked out most of Santiago
Tuesday night, and police said two men were killed while trying to
place a bomb at a utility tower after a national strike turned into
a day of street battles.
   Chile's largest labor federation had called the national strike
to protest the military government's banishment of two union
leaders into internal exile. Government officials and business
organizations called the strike a failure.
   Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse groups of
strikers and their supporters in Santiago and other cities, and
more than 100 people were arrested.
   Those disorders tapered off at dusk, but after nighfall the
violence spread to the slums ringing Santiago. Demonstrators
blocked street with burning barricades, and gunshots and explosions
were heard.
   Police said security forces in Santiago intercepted two men
attempting to place an explosive device at a utility tower and
opened fire, killing both suspects.
   Most of Santiago, with a population of 4.5 million, was blacked
out at about 9:30 p.m., and police blamed the power failure on
bombings of several electric-line pylons. Within a half hour power
had been restored to some secions of the capital.
   The Interior Ministry said 138 people were arrested throughout
the country, including 84 in Santiago, during the day. No report
was issued on the later violence.
   At dusk the streets in downtown Santiago were virtually
deserted, the air thick with tear gas. Public transportation came
to a standstill as bus owners withdrew their vehicles after several
were damaged.
   ``What strike?'' Interior Minister Carlos Caceres said when
reporters asked about the walkout called by the United Workers
Central, which claims 300,000 members in Chile's labor force of 4.5
million.
   He said the situation was ``near normal throughout the country.
Workers attended their jobs normally and schools were also
funcioning normally.''
   The minister and other officials acknowledged public transport
was severely curtailed in the morning and attributed it to fear by
drivers of attacks on themselves and their vehicles.
   Diego Olivares, acting president of the labor federation, said
thousands of workers stayed home and many others went to their jobs
late. Osvaldo Verdugo, president of the National School Teachers
Association, said more than half the students in Santiago did not
attend school.
   Olivares' federation called the strike to protest the continued
banishment to small provincial towns of its president, Manuel
Bustos, and vice president, Arturo Martinez. Both were sentenced
last September to 541 days of internal exile for calling a strike
in 1987.
   Independent reports confirmed little absenteeism at most
industries and factories, but some industries were idled by lack of
electric power.
   Parts of Santiago also had been blacked out by bombings early
Tuesday, and Caceres said those attacks ``confirm what the
government said, that the real aim of this strike was to promote
violence and terrorism.''
   The government power company said seven power pylons were
destroyed ``by terrorists'' in the bombings Tuesday morning.
   There was no immediate report on the damage from the Tuesday
night attacks.
   A police report on the bombings early Tuesday said at least
eight explosions in Santiago wounded two men and damaged a bank,
telephone company office bus terminal and municipal building.

   Failure to improve the U.S. educational system
could saddle America's economy with ``enormous long-term costs,''
the congressional Joint Economic Committee said today in its first
bipartisan report since 1980.
   America is falling behind the rest of the world in promoting
literacy and job skills even though it already spends more money
per student than any other country in the world, the committee said.
   While the panel did not break any new ground in recommending
solutions to education problems or others facing the economy, it
was able for the first time in nine years to issue a bipartisan
report, supported by both Democrats and Republicans on the
20-member committee.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., the new chairman of the committee,
said members agreed that the most crucial thing Congress and the
administration need to do is address the federal budget deficit.
The report, however, did not provide any specifics on how the gap
between revenues and spending should be narrowed.

   Gasoline prices around the country rose
suddenly after the Exxon Valdez spilled 10 million gallons of oil
in Alaska, but Exxon and a government energy official told a Senate
hearing the accident wasn't the reason.
   That wasn't enough to convince Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,
who criticized other oil companies for passing up an invitation to
appear Monday before his Energy subcommittee on energy regulation
and conservation.
   ``You have an amazing burden of proof to convince the American
people that the oil companies didn't exploit the Valdez accident,''
Metzenbaum said. ``I also invited Arco, Mobil, Chevron, BP, Texaco,
Shell and Amoco, and I regret their failure to appear.''
   In the three weeks following the spill, gasoline prices jumped
10 to 30 cents a gallon across the country.

   Americans in record numbers are writing and
telephoning the Supreme Court to express their views on abortion,
but a court spokeswoman says it's all to no avail.
   ``I hope they understand this is not a popularity contest. We
are not keeping score of who favors abortion and who does not,''
Toni House said in commenting on the more than 40,000 letters and
hundreds of telephone calls reaching the court each day.
   Ms. House, the court's public information officer, said, ``While
people have a right to write to the court I hope they do not expect
that the enunciation of their opinion will have any effect on the
justices.''
   The court is to hear arguments April 26 in a key abortion-rights
case from Missouri in which the justices are being asked to
overturn or substantially limit the landmark 1973 decision
legalizing abortion.

   A doctor has vowed to clear his
name of fraud charges filed by Switzerland despite being barred
from traveling abroad by a U.S. judge, who feared cancer patients
might die in his absence.
   Dr. Rajko Medenica's trial on charges of defrauding the Swiss
government of $2.6 million opened Monday in Geneva. It was recessed
until Wednesday so the Swiss judge could consider a defense motion
for postponement until Medenica can attend.
   Medenica, a native of Yugoslavia who became an American citizen
last year, was ordered in March to surrender his passport and
remain in the United States by federal District Judge Sol Blatt Jr.
   Several of Medenica's patients had said they might die if the
doctor were jailed in Switzerland and unable to continue his
treatments.

   The House voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to back
a plan to close 86 military bases and scale back five more despite
complaints that the move will not save as much as advocates had
promised.
   By a vote of 381-43, the House rejected a resolution to
disapprove the recommendations of the Commission on Base
Realignment and Closure, giving the green light for Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney to follow through on the panel's proposals
beginning in January.
   ``It is incumbent upon all of us to make sure this base closing
list is implemented,'' the chairman of the House Armed Services
Chairman, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said moments before the vote.
   The commission's recommendations affect a total of 145 domestic
military installations by closing some, reducing the operations of
others and changing the missions of additional bases.

   NBC captured its fourth straight television
season Tuesday, winning by the largest margin in 32 years with a
little help from ``The Cosby Show,'' ``Cheers,'' ``A Different
World'' and ``The Golden Girls.''
   NBC won all 30 weeks of the September to April season, the first
time any network has done so since 1963-64, and claimed three of
the four most popular series, according to A.C. Nielsen Co.
end-of-the-year ratings.
   The network's margin of victory, 24 percent, was the
second-largest in Nielsen history, the network said.
   Boosted by its working-class situation comedy ``Roseanne,'' the
season's highest-rated new series and No. 2 overall, ABC finished
in second place. CBS, saddled by the aging serials ``Dallas,'' tied
for No. 30, ``Knots Landing,'' tied for 28th, and ``Falcon Crest,''
tied at No. 54, came in last among the three networks for the
second year in a row.

<HEAD>Kingsley Plays Another Historic Figure _ With This One Looking On</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ben Kingsley had played real-life figures
before, but none that were still living, much less there on the set
watching his performance.
   In the HBO movie, ``Murderers Among Us: The Simon Wiesenthal
Story,'' Kingsley plays the title character, famous Nazi hunter
Simon Wiesenthal, who at 80, was most interested in how his story
was to be put down on film for posterity.
   In the opening scene of the movie, premiering Sunday, Wiesenthal
is liberated from the concentration camp where he risked his life
making drawings of the horrors as a record of the Nazi crimes.
Craig T. Nelson plays Maj. Harcourt, an American officer who was
among the liberators.
   ``I did the first scene involving collapsing into Craig T.
Nelson's arms with my drawings,'' recalled Kingsley, ``and I looked
up from doing that scene, and there was Simon sitting about 20 feet
away from me with tears streaming down his face, but smiling at me
like a kind uncle who's watched his nephew win the 400 meters, you
know, a wonderful mixture of great pain and great pride that we had
got it on film.
   ``And that's what he wanted to do, is get it down on paper, get
it down on film, get it in front of the hearts and the eyes and the
minds of young people who either do not know or do not believe that
these things took place. And I'm afraid they have to know.''
   Kingsley, who won an Oscar in 1982 for his lead performance in
``Gandhi,'' said he was picked by Wiesenthal to play the part.
``This from the man himself was very flattering and, more
importantly, very, very encouraging,'' Kingsley said in a telephone
interview from his home in London.
   ``I thought, well, at least he's behind the casting, which gave
me some confidence, because the scale of the man is almost
unactable. The scale of experience, what he had to witness, is
almost unimaginable,'' Kingsley said.
   ``I knew that it would be a very difficult role, very difficult
indeed, and Simon's embrace of me was very important, emotionally,
psychologically, for my morale as an actor.''
   Kingsley said he had been in Wiesenthal's home city of Vienna
making an Italian film when he first heard of the HBO project in
1987, but decided not to meet with Wiesenthal until the offer was
firm. Then he and Renee Soutendijk, who plays Cyla Wiesenthal in
the movie, went together to meet the couple.
   ``It was a very, very exciting and extraordinary meeting, full
of emotional information, not simply because I was going to portray
the man, but to meet the man was an important experience,''
Kingsley said.
   ``You are meeting a prophet, you are meeting a spokesman, the
voice of 11{ million people. And that really comes off the man, the
energy of that obsession, and I use that word kindly, and that
burning quest is visible in the man's eyes, his physique, in his
voice and in the massive authority that he has every time he
speaks. Very kind, very wise man, but a very formidable character.''
   The movie traces Wiesenthal from his liberation in 1945 through
his tireless quest to bring Nazi war criminals to justice, most
notably Adolph Eichmann, who had escaped to Argentina. Through
Wiesenthal's efforts, Eichmann was arrested and brought to Israel
where he was tried, convicted and hanged.
   Wiesenthal has actively participated in publicizing the film,
which he sees as an extension of his work keeping the Holocaust
alive in people's minds so it cannot happen again. Kingsley avoided
thinking of the sociological ramifications of the movie during
filming.
   ``If you're climbing a mountain knowing that you have to place a
flag on the top of the mountain, when you're halfway up the
mountain, if the flag is in your knapsack, you don't keep taking it
out and looking at it. What you look at is where you put your hand
next and where you put your foot next. ... If the ramifications of
placing the flag on the top of the mountain are your preoccupation,
10-to-1 you're going to fall off the mountain.''
   Kingsley, who most recently appeared in the comedy ``Without a
Clue'' with Michael Caine, is off to Brazil next month to film a
French comedy, ``The Fifth Monkey.''

   Simon Wiesenthal stood among 40 naked,
shivering men as a Nazi officer stepped down the line, shooting
each man in the temple and sending them toppling into the stone
quarry below.
   Two men away from being shot, Wiesenthal was reprieved. A
messenger ran up and said his services were needed to paint a sign
honoring Adolf Hitler's birthday.
   Wiesenthal dedicated his survival to the dead, documenting the
Nazi atrocities and hunting down some 6,000 Nazis over the past 40
years so they could be brought to trial.
   The story of his life, powerfully portrayed by Oscar-winning
British actor Ben Kingsley, is told in ``Murderers Among Us: The
Simon Wiesenthal Story,'' a Home Box Office production premiering
Sunday on the pay-cable channel.
   ``The message in the movie is justice, not revenge,''
Wiesenthal, 80, said after seeing the three-hour film at a preview
here. ``I am one of the witnesses. After I am gone, the movie will
survive.''
   Was the movie true-to-life? ``This is not a case of fact being
stronger than fiction,'' he said in an interview. ``It was all
fact, even the dramatization.''
   Kingsley, 54, best-known for his Oscar-winning performance as
the pacifist Indian leader Gandhi, bears a strong likeness to
Wiesenthal in his younger years. ``We were born on the same date,
Dec. 31. Maybe that's why he was totally in my skin. He's a
brilliant actor,'' said Wiesenthal, who spent time with Kingsley
during filming in Hungary.
   When Wiesenthal first walked onto a set depicting the Mauthausen
concentration camp where he was held, he wept. ``It was so strong,
I couldn't help crying,'' he said.
   More than 40 years ago, when U.S. troops rolled into Mauthausen,
they found a beaten Wiesenthal, half-starved. ``It's OK, you're
alive,'' says an American major, played by Craig T. Nelson in the
movie, as he cradles Wiesenthal in his arms. ``Yes, but why?''
Wiesenthal asks.
   The major convinces Wiesenthal to help him set up a war-crimes
unit that could use his photographic memory of the Nazis who ran
the camp.
   Wiesenthal is reunited with his wife, Cyla, whom he had thought
must have died during their six-year separation. A daughter is
born. When the U.S. war-crimes unit is sent home, Wiesenthal asks
for its files and moves his family to Vienna to set up his
now-famous documentation center.
   His wife _ played by Dutch actress Renee Soutendijk _ wants only
to forget. He cannot. ``We must never forget or it will happen
again,'' he tells her.
   After a crank caller threatens to kidnap their daughter and his
wife demands that he move the family away from Vienna's persistent
manifestations of anti-Semitism, Wiesenthal says: ``I have to do
this. I survived.''
   Guilt at his survival translates into recurring nightmares. The
most persistent is based on a true experience: Wiesenthal is told
that his mother has been rounded up by the Gestapo and put on a
train for transportation to a death camp.
   He is working at the train station at that time, shortly before
he, too, is taken away, and he goes running along the rails
frantically banging against the doors of the locked box cars
shouting. ``Mrs. Wiesenthal! Mrs. Wiesenthal!''
   He hears wailing and screaming from inside the cars, the
engineer stokes the furnace, and the train chugs off taking his
mother to the gas chambers.
   ``I swear, I swear, I swear,'' he shouts as he falls to the
ground and vows to find her killers.
   But it's not revenge he is seeking, Wiesenthal tells his
teen-age daughter. ``You musn't hate, you musn't blame them all.''
   Not even when an Austrian court acquits Franz Murer, an Austrian
officer known as the ``Butcher of Vilna'' for his atrocities at the
Vilna ghetto; not even when he tracks down a Nazi who tied two Jews
together so he could shoot one in the mouth and prove to a
colleague that the bullet would pierce the skull of the other man;
not even when Nazi sympathizers firebomb his apartment with his
wife and daughter inside.
   ``When I go to heaven and meet the 6 million'' who perished in
the Nazi Holocaust, Wiesenthal said, ``I want to tell them I hunted
down their killers. I didn't kill them, because we're better than
they are. We believe in justice.''

<HEAD>World's Fastest Computers May Be Japanese Before Long</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: John Cunniff is on assignment.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Supercomputers are the Lamborghinis of
data-processing, capable of tearing through more operations in one
second than someone with a hand-held calculator could do in several
lifetimes.
   The nation that makes the world's fastest computers has a
special claim to world leadership in high technology. For years,
that nation has been the United States. In a decade or so, it may
well be Japan.
   Two events a week apart show how quickly Japan is moving to
surpass the United States in supercomputing:
   _Last Monday, Japan's NEC Corp. announced it will come out next
year with a family of supercomputers faster than the machines that
will be released about the same time by Cray Research Inc., the
Minneapolis-based world leader.
   _This Monday, Control Data Corp. said it was folding ETA
Systems, the supercomputer operation that lost more than $100
million last year.
   Once again, Japanese companies are mounting a single-minded
campaign to achieve superiority in a field traditionally dominated
by Americans. And once again, their long-term focus is paying off.
   ``They have a one-track mind. They want to build the best so
they find ways of doing it,'' said Sidney Fernbach, a consultant
and retired director of computer operations at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory.
   Fernbach oversaw supercomputers at Lawrence Livermore that were
used for designing nuclear weapons and experimenting with nuclear
fusion. Now he chairs a supercomputing committee for the Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
   ``I have no optimistic things to say about the U.S.
supercomputer industry. I am just horrified,'' he said in an
interview.
   Disaster for U.S. supercomputing is not imminent. Cray continues
to control about two-thirds of the world market, by one measure.
Hundreds of programs have been written to run on Cray machines, and
that software will keep customers coming back.
   Moreover, Cray's total reliance on supercomputers for a living
keeps the company sharply focused on its mission.
   ``Cray has done a lot of things very, very right,'' said Michael
P. Burwen, president of the Palo Alto Management Group consulting
firm.
   Otherwise, though, most signs are pointing the wrong way.
   _Japan's big three (NEC, Hitachi Ltd. and Fujitsu Ltd.) are
vertically integrated, meaning they make everything needed for a
supercomputer from microchips on up. They can tailor chips to their
own needs. Cray, in contrast, relies on its competitor Fujitsu for
high-speed logic chips.
   _Japan makes much faster single processors, forcing Cray and
other U.S. companies to compete by lashing together many processors
(for Cray, eventually 64). Making that many work together on a
problem is diabolically difficult.
   _With the help of Americans, Japanese companies are catching up
in their one weak area, software. The Houston Area Research
Consortium has become a software bonanza for NEC since the
consortium agreed to buy the only Japanese-made supercomputer in
the United States. The trend is sure to continue as software
developers adapt their programs for Japanese machines.
   What should be done? The federal government, the world's biggest
purchaser of supercomputers, already has a buy-American policy,
although procurement rules inhibit potentially fruitful cooperation
between buyers and sellers.
   The National Science Foundation backs a network of supercomputer
centers, but it is aimed more at using the machines than designing
better ones.
   It is not clear how much good an industry-government research
partnership like Japan's 10-year project would do. Fernbach favors
it, while Burwen argues that in Japan, NEC, Hitachi and Fujitsu
compete so intensely with each other that they never contributed
their best work.
   Fernbach favors cultivating new U.S. supercomputer producers by
having government agencies in effect promise to buy their first
machines.
   Besides Cray and ETA, Thinking Machines Corp. of Cambridge,
Mass., has sold some supercomputers, and others are expected from
Evans &amp; Sutherland Computer Co. and Amdahl Corp. (whose largest
shareholder is Fujitsu).
   The Japanese most fear International Business Machines Corp.,
which leads in unit sales of supercomputers if its specially
equipped mainframes are counted. IBM is the only company that, like
the Japanese, is vertically intgrated from chips on up.
   IBM is supporting the start-up Supercomputer Systems Inc., which
was founded by former Cray designer Steve Chen. It also is working
with Los Alamos National Laboratory to develop a powerful new
supercomputer.
   Still, Fernbach, for one, is pessimistic. ``I think the Japanese
are going to steal the whole computer business away from us,'' he
said.

   Agonizing personal experience led Linda Noie to
her fervent anti-abortion stance. Ten years ago, she had an
abortion _ but still carried a fetus to term and gave birth. She
shared her private anguish over that failed abortion with The
Associated Press, in a story that is one in a series examining the
emotional question of abortion rights as the U.S. Supreme Court
prepares to hear arguments this week.

   Two months after her abortion, Linda Noie
feared a cancerous tumor was growing inside her. But the rhythmic
buh-bump of a fetal heartbeat heard through a stethoscope confirmed
she was still pregnant.
   ``My tumor had a heartbeat, two beautiful arms and two beautiful
legs,'' Ms. Noie said.
   The episode in 1979 transformed Ms. Noie into a zealous
pro-lifer. Now the state director of Women Exploited By Abortion,
she lives next door to the clinic where she had the five-minute
surgery and pickets there at least twice a week.
   Her son, Joshua, now 9 years old, joins her at marches, rallies
and speeches. He wears a T-shirt saying: ``I Survived the Abortion
Holocaust.''
   ``If that baby could make it through that terrible experience,
that baby was mine, no matter what,'' Ms. Noie, 44, said. ``Nobody
was going to talk me into killing this baby. I thought I committed
murder one time. I wasn't going to do it again.
   ``There is a reason Joshua survived. I think God wanted to start
his army in the spiritual battle against abortion. He wanted
somebody to be on the front lines. Here we are, out on the
battlefront.''
   Nationally, the bitter abortion fight is approaching a turning
point.
   The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments April 26 on a
Missouri case that could narrow or overturn a 1973 ruling that
established a woman's right to abortion.
   When defenders of a woman's right to choose a safe, legal
abortion have marched on Washington, D.C., most recently April 9,
some have carried coat hangers as brutal reminders of back-alley
butchery done before 1973.
   Those opposed to abortion like Ms. Noie counter with pictures of
fetuses being cut up or sucked out of the womb. She has yelled at
patients and jumped in front of cars bringing pregnant women to the
Fox Valley Reproductive Health Care Center, where she had her
unsuccessful abortion.
   Her mailbox is painted crimson and adorned with red ribbon to
symbolize babies' blood.
   ``I don't want anyone else to get hurt like I was,'' Ms. Noie
said. ``I made a bad mistake. It eats away at me every day. I want
to be there for somebody else. I don't want them to look out and
not have anybody, like I did.
   ``Abortion doesn't just mean being unpregnant. It's legalized
murder. Babies are being killed,'' she said. ``You just can't put
it in a closet. That door doesn't quite shut tight. It's going to
creep out some day.''
   Ms. Noie says she's on a crusade to help women who feel guilt or
suffer psychological scars after their abortions. Dr. Vincent Rue,
a psychotherapist and former teacher at UCLA, called this condition
post-abortion syndrome and said it can include ``suppressed
hostility, unresolved mourning for the loss of the fetal child and
a re-experiencing of the abortion.''
   The way Ms. Noie sees it, the clinic either botched the abortion
or aborted a twin fetus.
   Maggi Case, director and owner of the clinic, declined to
comment on Ms. Noie's case because she is ``not at liberty to
discuss a patient's medical records.''
   Ms. Noie cried several times as she recounted her achingly
private pain in a recent interview. Her gaze frequently drifted out
the dining room window to a child's swing set and sandbox in the
backyard.
   In 1979, she was recently divorced after 15 years of marriage
and had two children aged 16 and 10. A waitress, she became
pregnant to a restaurant customer who befriended her.
   Afraid, confused and burdened with a pregnancy her boyfriend
didn't want, she scheduled an abortion at the clinic for Jan. 12.
   The day of the surgery, she wrote one word in her calendar
diary: ``slaughterhouse.'' After a five-hour wait in the crowded
clinic, she spent five minutes on the operating table. Her
boyfriend paid in cash.
   ``I was mixed up. I was wishing somebody would break in and take
me out of there. I wanted it stopped,'' Ms. Noie said. ``The pain
was awful. It seemed very, very wrong.
   ``I killed a baby. I felt so dirty and crummy. It was like part
of me was gone,'' she said. ``I couldn't look at myself in the
mirror. I was ready to commit suicide, not because I wanted to die,
but because I hated myself so badly for what I had done.''
   That night, she and her boyfriend ended their relationship.
   Ms. Noie returned a month later for a checkup, complaining about
being dizzy and weak at work. She was told the abortion had
``removed particles of conception'' but her hormones hadn't
readjusted.
   On March 29, she came back again and was referred to a second
doctor. When he checked her for a suspected tumor, she was given a
stethoscope and was asked, ``Do you want to hear your baby's
heartbeat?''
   Ms. Noie says her son has hearing lapses, memory loss and other
health effects that she attributes to the abortion.
   She returned to the clinic about a year after Joshua was born.
Dressed in black, she circled the stone and frame building,
touching it while Joshua played with driveway pebbles.
   ``I wanted to make sure it couldn't hurt me anymore,'' she said.
   A chain-link fence erected by the clinic marks the property line.
   ``I had nightmares when I first moved in,'' Ms. Noie said. ``I
dreamed of little babies with charred arms and legs crawling out of
the barrels in back where they burn their medical waste.
   ``Joshua likes the house, but he tells people he lives next to
the place where they kill babies,'' she said. ``Once when he was 3
years old, he woke up screaming at night and said, `Mommy, why did
you do it? Didn't you want me?'''

   Democracy was just a word to
Paraguayans in the 34 years Gen. Alfredo Stroessner ran the
country. It's something more than that now as the nation heads into
elections May 1, but some people are still wary.
   ``A lot of people believe we are already living a democracy, but
we say it is only a transition which began suddenly and could end
just as suddenly,'' says Euclides Acevedo, president of the
opposition Revolutionary Febrerista Party. ``We hope it will
culminate in democracy.''
   Andres Rodriguez, who toppled Stroessner on Feb. 3 and became
the provisional president, has lifted restrictions on political
parties, restored civil liberties, accused former government
officials of corruption and torture, allowed exiles to return.
   But Rodriguez, like Stroessner, is a general who used his
position to amass riches and act with impunity.
   And he is the presidential candidate of the ruling Colorado
Party, which is almost certain to win the presidency and control of
Congress in the balloting.
   Domingo Laino, Rodriguez's main rival for president, notes that
changes so far have come from the top, not the bottom, where
farmers are clamoring for land, workers for the enforcement of
labor laws, politicians for constitutional reform, women for equal
rights.
   ``What's going to happen when people demand more than the
government wants to give? There could be a crisis,'' Laino said in
an interview at his sprawling home where until recently he often
was held under house arrest.
   However, he added, ``I'm optimistic and I think the country is,
too. People feel we are moving forward.''
   After an initial outburst of public joy, Paraguayans settled
down quickly after Rodriguez's coup.
   Victor Baez Mosqueiro, head of the InterUnion Movement of
Workers, began pressing for labor reforms such as the right to
strike and to join a union other than the pro-government Paraguay
Workers Confederation.
   ``Now that we have freedom, we're going to demand a raise,''
teacher Maria Rosa Marin said. ``Before, we were afraid they would
fire us.''
   In general, Paraguayans seem anxious for change, not vengeance,
and are looking hopefully to the future from a past that saw
state-of-seige legislation renewed every 90 days for 32 years and
people followed, beaten up, jailed and exiled.
   ``The question is whether the Colorado Party can correct the
errors committed by the Colorado Party. I doubt it,'' says Fernando
Vera, an economist and the presidential candidate of the
Revolutionary Febrerista Party.
   Asked that question, Edgar Ynsfran, Stroessner's onetime
interior minister and now an adviser to Rodriguez and the
third-ranking member of the party, responded, ``I'm not certain
that we do have that capacity, but the good will is there.''
   A lot changed, or at least appeared to, the very morning
Rodriguez told Paraguayans by radio that the 76-year-old Stroessner
had ``resigned'' after all-night fighting between troops firing
tanks shells and heavy machine guns at each other.
   Rodriguez, 65, formed a Cabinet that observers say is excellent.
He publicly endorsed human rights and invited opposition leaders
like Laino to the national palace.
   The stolid, stocky general now wears civilian clothes in public,
travels with few bodyguards, talks with reporters without requiring
questions to be submitted in advance, seems sensitive to the
opinions of others and plays tennis with U.S. Ambassador Timothy
Towell.
   Paraguayans are impressed not only by the return to publication
of the banned newspaper ABC Color, but also by Rodriguez's visit to
a hospital that was a hotbed of opposition to Stroessner, and to a
Mass celebrated by a bishop who was reviled by the former
government.
   ``Just by walking into the hospital ... Rodriguez was saying
they (doctors and nurses) were right in their struggle,'' said Jose
Carlos Rodriguez (no relation), a 41-year-old economist, political
scientist and pollster.
   Though photographs of Rodriguez have cropped up in tourist
hotels as well as government offices, he has not sought the cult of
personality that enveloped Stroessner, for whom a polka, a river
steamer, a neighborhood, an airport and a city were named.
   ``Stroessner was a god in Paraguay,'' said Benjamin Arditti, a
33-year-old sociologist. ``By toppling Stroessner, Rodriguez also
demonstrated that no one is god, not even him; and that he realizes
that the country is not going back to where it was.''
   Another change that Paraguayans noticed and like is that
Rodriguez attends functions with his wife and daughters.
Stroessner, in contrast, didn't live with his wife and had several
mistresses over the years. He now is in exile in Brazil.
   ``Rodriguez supports family values,'' said Aldo Zuccolillo,
editor of ABC Color.
   ``Yes, the Colorado Party is going to win. ... If Satan
overthrew Stroessner, every Paraguayan would vote for the devil.''
   But part of the explanation, however, is the dominance of the
Colorado Party, which claims 1.4 million supporters, requires
membership as a condition of public employment, and finances itself
by payroll deductions.
   The party also will benefit by an out-of-date voter list that
even Colorados admit is bloated, and by practices like the
requirement that each party, no matter how small, distribute its
own ballots to thousands of polling desks across a rural, in many
areas roadless, country the size of California.
   Still, Rodriguez has a popularity that can't be denied.
   ``I have confidence in Rodriguez, not just because he replaced
Stroessner,'' said Maria Celeste Solis, an 18-year-old student
standing in line to register to vote for the first time. ``The
others seem disorganized to me. He's more mature, competent.''
   Businessmen were won over, and Paraguay's economy was
stabilized, when Rodriguez unified the currency exchange rate.
   Opposition politicians decided to participate in the elections
when Rodriguez promised not to run again in 1993, endorsed
constitutional reform, reopened voter registration, gave candidates
access to the national radio network, and required that voters'
fingers be dipped in indelible ink to prevent multiple voting.
   Rodriguez also thought to provide homes for the families of
soldiers _ on both sides _ who died in the fighting during the coup.
   ``He really is a man of the people,'' said the Rev. Mario
Melanio Medina, a Catholic priest and frequent critic of
Stroessner. ``When he gives his word, he will try and keep it.''
   The diplomatic view, however, is wait and see.
   ``The question is,'' said one foreign diplomat, ``is all this a
political exercise, or is it a reflection of something new and
better? Our general view is, once you unstop the bottle, you can't
put the cork back.''

   They are part of the legacy of the 2.7 million
Americans who went to Vietnam to help fight a war, the sons and
daughters of fathers who left years ago. Unwanted and scorned in
the land of their birth, many abandoned by their Vietnamese
mothers, they yearn to start a new life in America. U.S. officials
say help is on the way for the 10,000 or more Amerasians remaining
in Vietnam, but the question is whether their fathers will welcome
them.

<TEXT>
   The war was still raging that
day 15 years ago when Vietnamese nuns heard the cries of a baby boy
stuffed in a garbage can and took him inside their orphanage to
raise.
   Today, Nguyen Thanh Binh, the son of a black American who went
home and a Vietnamese mother who abandoned him, shares the plight
of thousands of Amerasian youths languishing in the decay of
Vietnam, desperately trying to get out and find their fathers.
   ``My circumstances are miserable,'' says Lam Anh Hong, 18, whose
mother gave her away to a relative. ``I always live with hope. I
don't give up hope.''
   Like Binh and Hong, many of the Amerasians born of American
fathers and Vietnamese mothers were abandoned by both parents, left
in orphanages or with relatives or friends, often to fend for
themselves.
   Many of the Amerasians are jobless, homeless, uneducated,
unwanted, barely able to speak English. They sleep at night on the
sidewalks and in the parks. Some turn to prostitution to stay alive.
   Blacks like Binh also are victims of a Vietnamese caste system.
White Amerasians may be at the bottom in the clannish Vietnamese
society, but they are at the top within the Amerasian society. The
black Amerasians are at the bottom.
   All suffer the taunts of their Vietnamese peers, ``Amerasians no
good. Go to America.''
   Charlie Brown Phuong, at 25 one of the older Amerasians, was one
of those abandoned by their mothers. ``She don't want I be her
son,'' he says.
   Phuong was raised in a Roman Catholic orphanage in Da Nang but
ran away when he was 11 and boarded an evacuation ship to Ho Chi
Minh City as North Vietnamese forces swept southward to conquer
South Vietnam in 1975.
   Now he sells newspapers, cigarettes and bread and sleeps in a
park. ``Nobody helps us,'' he says. ``Look at my eyes. They are
very old because I work very hard.''
   But some get lucky. Nguyen Thi Thu Huong, an 18-year-old wearing
a blue ribbon in her brown hair and pink slippers on her mud-caked
feet, was found one day selling postcards for nickels and dimes,
washing herself in a fountain in the center of the city. Her father
left Vietnam when she was 2.
   ``Only foreigners help,'' she says. ``I feel lonely. I feel sad.
I want to be in the U.S. to study, work and have friends. I go, I
have a job and a good house.''
   Then, a short time later, she is a Cinderella, on her way to
America with her mother, one hand carrying a suitcase, the other
affectionately wrapped around her 8-year-old Vietnamese
half-brother. A small group of Amerasian street kids went to Tan
Son Nhut Airport to see them off.
   U.S. officials say help is also on the way for the 10,000
Amerasians they estimate still remain. Vietnamese authorities put
the estimate at 16,000 but that's hard to pin down because no
official census has been taken. More than 6,000 Amerasians and
11,000 of their relatives have left Vietnam legally since the start
of the U.S. Orderly Departures Program in 1980.
   Bruce A. Beardsley, director of the Orderly Departures Program
in Bangkok, Thailand, has cut much of the bureaucratic paperwork
and persuaded the Vietnamese to do the same.
   ``I have been pushing the best I can to get departures to go at
a much more rapid rate,'' he says. ``We're trying to expand the
transportation net.''
   At one point early this year, 5,500 Amerasians and their family
members already approved for resettlement in the United States were
awaiting transportation.
   Some of the Amerasians camp out in a park next to the Foreign
Ministry, awaiting the roll of the dice, the anticipated approval
that will be their ticket to America. In the interim, they hang out
in front of the hotels, clinging to American tourists, begging not
only for money but for affection.
   Some Amerasians carry the physical scars of war as well as the
mental pain of rejection.
   Pham Thi Lan, 22, never knew her father. Her mother died of
heart disease when she was 8. When her stepfather remarried, he
threw her out of the house and she went to live with her
grandmother. Her neck and chest are scarred by napalm.
   Vuong Thanh Hai, 20, has a hole in his head and only one arm.
His father left when he was born, his mother died when he was 6.
Shrapnel from a 155mm artillery shell cut away his right arm.
   The Amerasians are the legacy of some 2.7 million Americans who
served in Vietnam until the last were withdrawn in 1973. Other
Americans, including military and civilian employees of the U.S.
Embassy, remained until the U.S.-supported Saigon government of
South Vietnam fell to Communist North Vietnam in 1975.
   Many Amerasians and their fathers have been trying for years to
find each other. But some Amerasians were rejected by fathers who
want nothing to do with them. Some of the fathers, already married,
went back to their American families. Others returned and married
American women after the war and started new families. Some may be
unaware that they left offspring behind.
   But for some who do know, the wrenching memories have driven
them into post traumatic stress disorder and counseling, unable to
resolve the guilt of leaving their child in the streets.

   Paul Deal has two families, one American, one Amerasian, 10,000
miles apart.
   But he lost touch with his family in Vietnam more than 15 years
ago and has spent years trying to find out what happened to the son
he has never seen.
   Deal, now a 40-year-old factory worker in River Falls, Wis., was
22 and had served more than two years in the Army in Vietnam when
he married Tran Thi Ngoc Hue in December 1971.
   Deal left Vietnam in May 1972, while his pregnant wife stayed
behind awaiting her visa.
   ``I was told she would follow me, that there was no problem,''
he says. ``I tried to get back over after I knew she was not
getting out, but they wouldn't let me go.''
   Nine months after Deal left Vietnam, Paul Jr. was born, on Feb.
21, 1973. The father's only ties to his son are photos of the boy
when he was 3 months old.
   After that, American forces left South Vietnam, but fighting
continued with North Vietnam and two years later the south fell to
the Communists.
   The letters and photos from Deal's Vietnamese wife stopped
coming after September 1973. He hasn't heard from her or his son
since.
   ``I could never understand what happened, how I lost her,'' he
said. ``I got the runaround from all over this country for years. I
wrote to everybody from Congress to the president.''
   Thinking he had lost everything, Deal married an American woman.
His Vietnamese marriage, he said, is not legally recognized in the
United States.
   Deal has three sons, ages 7, 10 and 13, by his American wife,
but he often wonders what became of his Amerasian son.
   ``I'm just praying he's alive, and her, too, and that someday
we're going to meet,'' he says.
   Deal has enlisted the aid of Bruce Burns, an attorney in San
Jose, Calif., who specializes in tracing Amerasians and their
fathers.
   ``If they don't find them,'' he says, ``I'm going back to try to
find them myself. I want him in the States. He belongs here because
he is American and he is my son.''

   The latest revival of Dixieland jazz, which has
become all but an epidemic in California for obscure reasons, is a
return to New Orleansian basics with aficionados rummaging through
musty attics, piano neches and antique shops in search of obscure
sheet music. Take a listen as Anna and Fred Wahler bring together
several semipro bands and hundreds of fans for their Spring Fling.

<TEXT>
   Outside, it's raining in sheets, but
Anna Wahler could care less. She and husband Fred are hosting a
Spring Fling. Let the good times roll.
   Or, according to the jazz rondos of the four bands they have
invited to the Fling, ``The World Is Waiting for The Sunrise'' or
``Shine Away Your Bluesies'' and, befitting proper guests, ``Carry
Me Back to Old Virginny.''
   Fred, 73, is retired from the post office, Anna as paymistress
for the White House, which is irrelevant here. What is not is that
Anna has picked up more splinters from benches listening to antique
musicians at Preservation Hall in New Orleans ``than I would care
to count.''
   Anna and Fred are jazz buffs. So are the 450 weekend attendees
at their Fling at the Hilton Hotel here. And so are the musicians
who are making $200, more for love than money. And so are God knows
how many more bands and fans _mostly white and middle class _
throughout this land who couldn't make it.
   We are not talking about guys in straw hats who oompah ``When
The Saints Go Marchin' In'' at political clambakes. That has been
scornfully dismissed as Disneyland jazz.
   Dixieland, for want of a more precise term, has had more
revivals than Lazarus. This current one, all but an epidemic in
California for reasons various ologists can't seem to define, is a
return to New Orleansian basics. The bands and their claques have
backpedaled down the 'Sippi like riverboats in reverse, upturned
musty attics, mined abandoned piano niches and antique shops for
ancient, obscure anthems as if Charlie Mingus and Led Zeppelin had
never been born.
   ``They're good tunes. You wonder why they're obscure,'' wondered
John Wood, a tuba player. There is a bit of one-upmanship in
finding the least-known golden deadie, airs even most fans don't
know.
   The musicians are almost to a man men. They are long-ago
graduates of high school bands who remember Dad's old 78s played on
windup Victrolas. They are full-time lawyers, Indians (e.g.,
Charlie Castro of the High Sierra Jazz Band present at the Fling)
and merchant chiefs. They are weekend minstrels because they want
to be, not have to be. Listen! Some are playing right now.
   Stan Vincent, the 53-year-old adman trombonist of The New Black
Eagle Jazz Band that is revered by Boston buffs next only to the
sacred cod, has planted his feet firmly, set to go to work on
``Seattle Hunch.'' To his right, Eli Newberger, a noted
pediatrician, hugs his pre-World War I weapon in his lap like a
mistress.
   He inhales deeply, then begins mouth-to-mouth resuscitation into
the mouthpiece like a Laocoon wrestling with the intestinal steam
plant that is his tuba. It reverberates with Jovian judgment, then
murmurs falsetto, light as baby breath.
   Tony Pringle, who once got top billing when he was young in
Liverpool _ ahead of a rock group called The Quarrymen before they
changed their name to The Beatles _ leads the band with a cornet
whose ancestor was one he sent away for the minute he heard his
first Jelly Roll Morton record. His barking horn snaps at the best
notes, omitting the lesser for his confreres to chew. Pumping
behind them is a rhythm section of a dental professor whose
curriculum vitae runs 23 pages, an architect and a psychologist.
They begin exhuming ``Leaning on Your Gate.''
   The Black Eagles are succeeded by the host ensemble, The Buck
Creek Jazz Band. (Fred and Anna live on Buck Creek.) Their leader,
another architect named Jim Ritter, assumes a rifleman's stance,
draws a bead on the notes inside his cornet, then fires them in
staccato bursts into the audience. Beside him John Skillman, a
Pentagon engineer, writhes at his arpeggios like someone trying to
squirm out of a girdle while playing clarinet at the same time. The
outcome is commanding. This unearthed chorale is ``Shaking the
Blues Away,'' something whose mummified sheet music they had seen
and practiced only that morning.
   On to ``His Eye Is on The Sparrow,'' a hymn of reverence
featuring co-leader Jim Mesich, an environmental consultant, on his
euphonium, a higher-pitched cousin of Newberger's plumbing. Mesich
once ad-libbed the vocal in lamenting verses for a deceased
grandchild. His wife had to leave the room. Jazz is communication
of soul. Newberger once reduced a pub full of Scots to tears
whispering his tuba to ``Heather on the Hill.''
   ``People who said Dixieland is dead don't have that pulse in
their hearts,'' says Skillman.
   When Buck Creek played for its 10th birthday here two years ago,
80 percent of the audience was from California. Out there, there is
scarcely a freeway caravansary, a suburban converted prunery or a
gentrified Sierra mining camp that doesn't have its resident jazz
band. Custer's Last Band. Natural Gas. Sutterville Stompers. The
Nightblooming Jazzmen.
   There's a circuit of jazz festivals in California. Sacramento's
in May is the biggest with 120 traditional jazz bands from all over
the world, including this year the Peace Hotel Old Jazz Band from,
yes, Shanghai. The faithful trail along after them in their RVs
like kids tagging along at a New Orleans brass band funeral,
collecting souvenir admission buttons as they go.
   The musicians reciprocate. A trombone case at Anna's Fling bears
stickers from Sydney, Auckland, San Diego, Davenport, Iowa (home of
the beatified Bix Beiderbecke), Edinburgh, Eindhoven in the
Netherlands, Munich in Germany.
   ``Trad'' jazz bands play their oldies on cruise ships, at
college concerts, in gin mills, auto body shop grand openings,
even, in the case of the Black Eagles, at the installation of an
Episcopalian bishop in Boston. The Catholics graciously lent their
cathedral for the ceremony because it was bigger. The Eagles, just
as graciously and ecumenically jazzed ``Together'' from their
500-tune repertory.
   Money is rarely a motive for the trad musician. Oh, Newberger,
who once flew from Africa to Denver for a gig, says he took in
$16,000 last year tubaing. If a Black Eagle made all 120 or so of
the band's gigs in a year, his kitty might be $24,000. But Betty
Ritter says her husband and his playmates possibly clear $4,000
each.

<TEXT>SPRINGFIELD: $4,000 each.''    Bob Jackson, who mutes his trumpet
with an old tomato can for The Grand Dominion Jazz Band making its East
Coast debut for the Fling, says if he were a bowler, his music ``might
make me enough to buy a new ball once in a while.''    With no aim in
mind other than the pleasure of listening, Anna and Fred hand-picked their
band from amateurs they knew in the Washington area. The criteria were
compatability of sound, personality and wives. With but one personnel change,
Buck Creek remains the same. Mesich even insists that at band dinners wives
sit in, too. Anna uses the world ``family.'' So does the band.    ``Social
life?'' Vincent once was queried. ``The band is our social life.''   
The arranged marriage of Buck Creek contrasts with how other bands form,
although the matrimonial metaphor applies to any of their existences. Buck
Creek set up housekeeping here 10 years ago on a three-Sundays trial run
and has lived happily at the Hilton ever since.    The Black Eagles met
on a blind date, as it were, via the jungle drums of the roving semipros
at Boston one-nighters in 1971. Newberger met Pringle, and the offspring
followed. They make their home at the Sticky Wicket Pub in Hopkinton, Mass.,
where the Boston marathon has its starting line.    Both these extended
jazz families have stayed basically, remarkably, intact although the Black
Eagles divorced a clarinet after domestic strife that reportedly verged
on fisticuffs which they don't talk about.    Buck Creek paid for its
first record with a crab feast Anna and Fred threw in the back yard like
the doting parents they are.    Grand Dominion is an international marriage
of Vancouverians and Seattletonians whose members coalesced from other
jazz bands north and south of the Peace Bridge and eschew tight knitting
used by the well-rehearsed Eagles and Creeks in favor of increasingly incendiary
choruses.    ``But a band has to like each other,'' says Jackson. ``If
not, you don't swing.''    ``I've played with a lot of bands,''
says Skillman, who learned his first clarinet in the coat room of a one-room
schoolhouse in Michigan where the music teacher held weekly instruction.
``This time I got lucky. Harmony and rhythm are basic components of this
music. If you don't rehearse, you don't have harmony, although we usually
don't end up where we started.''    Any hobby done well has its cost.
John Wood's lawn is often long-haired. The house needs painting. Dr. Cornelius
``Pam'' Pameijer, a dental professor, drives from Hartford, Conn., to Hopkinton,
Mass., every Thursday for the Eagles' night at home. All the semipros weave
gigs, festivals and tours abroad into their careers.    ``You get away
from the tensions,'' says Pameijer's wife, Huguet, ``and express yourself
in a positive way and make hundreds of people happy and yourself happy.''
   ``You don't have to play when you don't want to. It's the best of both
worlds,'' says Ulster-born Jim Armstrong, 49, Grand Dominion's trombone
and one of many Redcoats come to the New World to show the colonists
how to play their native music. His horn, which tumbles out more notes
in a set than many do in a lifetime, is surcease from the ``mission impossible''
of teaching history and French to high schoolers in Vancouver.    For
Newberger, whose milieu at Harvard's Children's Hospital is illness and
child abuse and rotting family life, music is a way of communicating with
others in a common tongue after a week of the seamy and the ugly and the
esoteric, confining vocabulary of professional medicine.    Dancing is
to traditional jazz as okra is to gumbo. Betty Ritter remembers a California
festival that almost came to blows because there wasn't a dance floor.
Playing jazz is a fever that dies in isolation. It needs infection, spreading
to the dancers out front, temperatures rising with the band getting more
febrile in response.    Listening to Skillman, music cascading like marbles
poured down a staircase, middle-agers lay down their beers and head for
the dance floor. They dance as Grand Dominion, with Armstrong's slide
flicking like a serpent's tongue, plays ``Ti-Pi-Tin,'' justly described
by leader and banjoist Mike Cox (cnother Brit) as ``a song you'd expect
to hear on an ocean liner by a potted palm band.''    Merrill Hammond,
an octogenarian who grew up in Boston ``where the soapy saxophone sound
orginated in the '20s,'' has been a musician, naval officer, an early disc
jockey and a collector of rare jazziana. He's in from Arizona spreading
lore.    Merrill has a piece of wallpaper from Lulu White's Mahogany Hall
given him when that storied Storyville bordello in New Orleans was demolished.
   Millie Jackson and husband Bob, who piloted Pat Brown's plane when
Brown was governor of California, are in from Ventura. They are regulars
on the festival circuit: Fresno in February, Monterey in March, Three Rivers
in April, Sacramento in May, Reno in June, Pismo Beach in October, San
Diego in November. And every other year to Europe with the Nightblooming
Jazzmen, this year blowing up the Rhine on an excursion boat.  
 Why California?    ``I really don't know,'' says Millie, who is later
to shimmy among the tables with a parasol as Buck Creek dispenses ``Short
Dress Gal.''    Someone at the Fling commented on the absence of blacks
on or off the stage at the Fling.    ``I've never seen a black combo or
even a musician at a festival, and this music is their roots,'' says Betty
Ritter. ``Maybe that's why. They want to get away from all that.''   
``They think it's Uncle Tom music,'' said somebody else.    Unfortunately,
there wasn't a black in sight to ask if anyone had it right.    Anna and
Fred put up about $35,000 as hosts of the Fling, including $1,500 per band
plus expenses.    ``I think we'll make it back,'' says Fred. ``Otherwise
we'll have to sell the house.''    The fans and bands are like that. Everything
for art.    Al Haberman of St. Petersburg, Fla., was sitting down front
and was torn. He didn't want the music to stop on schedule at 6:45 p.m.
on Sunday, 47 hours and 45 minutes after it had begun.    On the other
hand, he had a flight to catch to make a jazz concert later that night
back home.

<HEAD>Logan Airport Seeks to Cut Delays; Challenged by Federal Government</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who runs Boston's Logan Airport faced the
same problem plaguing major airports worldwide: how to cut the
delays that were making flying an ever more unpleasant experience.
   His solution: discourage small planes from using the airport by
raising their takeoff and landing fees while cutting the charges
for commercial airliners.
   ``If you think that all planes are created equal, then I'm
wrong,'' says David W. Davis, executive director of the
Massachusetts Port Authority. ``But there's no way you can convince
me that a small plane with two people aboard has the same priority
as a large airplane with 400.''
   Small aircraft that had paid a flat $25 to land at Logan found
themselves facing a bill for $100-plus every time they set down.
Jumbo jets, by contrast, had their $800 landing fee cut in half.
   Davis' plan worked. The number of private and commuter planes
using the airport fell by one-third. Logan, ranked last in on-time
performance among the 27 biggest U.S. airports last May, surged to
second place in the December rankings.
   But the federal government disagreed with the move, saying the
new regulations violated federal aviation laws and were
``inconsistent with national transportation policy.'' As 1988
ended, the port authority suspended its fee revisions until a
federal appeals court hears arguments in the dispute early next
month.
   On one side are the nation's air travelers and airport
operators, struggling as they are with steadily growing demands for
limited runway space. On the other, private aircraft owners,
corporate plane users and commuter airlines, all of which contend
that a six-seat Piper Cub has the same right to use a runway as a
400-seat DC-10.
   Airports operate like bakery counters: Pilots wanting to take
off or land are all given numbers and must wait their turn. And,
like the bakery customer out to buy two dozen doughnuts, three
loaves of bread and a pound of cookies but who must wait for the
person before him to purchase his lone sticky bun, pilots are all
treated alike.
   Davis argues that the result of such an egalitarian policy, for
more and more people, comes down to a single word: wait.
   Wait to board the plane. Wait for clearance to take off. Wait at
the other end for permission to land. Wait with other passengers
whose trips have likewise been bollixed up for luggage, for a cab
and for the traffic on jammed highways to clear.
   But critics accuse the Massport director of trying to
single-handedly dictate transportation policy and transgressing
long-established laws that guarantee aircraft equal access to the
nation's runways.
   John Baker, president of the 265,000-member Aircraft Owners and
Pilots Association, says eliminating all the small planes wouldn't
cure congestion at Logan. What the airport really needs, he says,
is another runway _ one set aside for private planes.
   Jonathan Howe, president of the National Business Aircraft
Association, says that if the Massport program stands, other
airports might follow with their restrictions, creating ``chaos''
in the skies.
   But even critics give Davis credit for forcing a debate on
capacity at the nation's overburdened airports.
   Consider these facts:
   _Air passenger traffic has doubled since Jimmy Carter
deregulated airlines a decade ago. In 1976, 11.5 million people
flew through Logan; by 1988, terminal traffic more than doubled, to
23.3 million.
   _Requests to take off and land frequently hit 100 an hour during
Logan's peak periods. That's fine in good weather, when the airport
can handle 110 flights each hour, but not so fine on the one day in
five of bad weather. Then, capacity shrinks to 80 takeoffs and
landings an hour.
   _Before Davis restructured runway fees, port authority officials
say, private and commuter planes accounted for 40 percent of
Logan's takeoffs and landings, but just 6 percent of passengers.
   _Port authority officials say rush-hour backups routinely hit 60
minutes in 1987. Sometime next year, they project, the delays may
stretch to 100 minutes unless the number of takeoffs and landings
falls.
   To deal with these issues, Davis rejiggered the way runway-use
fees were assessed, arguing that many airport costs are fixed and
bear no relation to the size of planes using the facility.
   ``If a Cessna needs fire and crash assistance, you're not going
to send one pick-up truck with a fire extinguisher,'' he says. ``If
a Beechcraft needs to land on a snowy day, you're not going to plow
the middle third of the runway and let it go at that.''
   Authorities felt their logic was unassailable and noted besides
that discouraging a single small plane from using Logan could help
speed hundreds of jumbo jet passengers on their way.
   The U.S. Department of Transportation felt differently.
   In November, a federal administrative law judge ruled that
Logan's fee restructuring violated aviation laws and unfairly
saddled small planes with ``a disproportionate amount of airport
costs.''
   The next month, Deputy Transportation Secretary Mimi W. Dawson
upheld the ruling by law judge Burton S. Kolko.
   At the same time, New England legislators had gotten Congress to
threaten the port authority with a cutoff of $10 million in aid
unless the old fee structure was reimposed.
   Massport backed off; the $25 minimum was reborn.
   Opponents of the plan make these arguments:
   _The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association says that even
before Davis' revisions, private planes accounted for just 3
percent of Logan's peak-hours operations.
   ``They phony up the numbers by using 24-hour numbers,'' says
Baker. ``There are periods at Logan where you can shoot a cannon
through there and not hit an airplane.''
   Besides, he adds, few pleasure flyers use airports like Logan
these days.
   ``You put yourself in the elephant line and you suffer the same
privations that everybody else does in the airlines because of
irrational airline scheduling,'' Baker says.
   _The National Business Aircraft Association, which represents 83
percent of the Fortune 500 companies, says the issue in Boston is
the right of equal access to airports and airspace.
   Says Howe:
   ``If you've got the chairman of the board of IBM flying into
Boston to sign an agreement to open up a major computer
manufacturing business that's going to employ 5,000 people in a
Boston suburb, is it more important for him to arrive there in time
to sign that agreement than it is to delay a load of passengers
coming back from Bermuda on vacation?''
   Thomas Champion, Davis' assistant, responds to Howe's argument
by maintaining that a majority of airline passengers suffering
lengthy delays ``weren't charter loads of revelers on their way to
Bermuda or Cub Scouts going to Disneyworld. They were business
travelers.''

<HEAD>Soviets Look for Ways to Curb Grain Waste, Expert Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Always hard-pressed for enough grain of its
own, the Soviet Union has been forced to import huge quantities
from the United States and other countries, partly because of
sloppy harvesting and other wasteful practices.
   The waste has long been an issue in the Kremlin, where
generations of leaders have sought ways to offset the losses by
boosting annual production goals. Last month Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev proposed a new wave of reforms.
   Christian J. Foster, an Agriculture Department economist, says
Gorbachev's proposals ``could bring some changes to Soviet
agriculture, but their full implementation remains to be seen.''
   The proposed reforms were adopted by the 300-member Central
Committee, including the reorganization of the Soviet bureaucracy
and the expansion of long-term land leasing by private individuals
and organizations.
   Other reforms, which are to be worked out in the coming year,
include changes in the procurement prices for seasonal farm
products, decentralizing agricultural planning and increasing
investments in rural areas.
   Meanwhile, according to USDA estimates, the Soviet Union's grain
stockpile in 1988 and 1989 will decline for the first time in seven
years.
   ``Poor harvesting, storage, processing and transportation
practices cause substantial Soviet grain losses,'' Foster said.
``Now, the Soviets are increasing efforts to cut these losses.''
   Foster, writing in the current issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine, said that it has been virtually impossible for even
Soviet leaders to determine accurate grain supply and demand
statistics.
   One reason for inaccuracies has been the traditional Soviet
practice of reporting grain output on the basis of ``bunker''
weight, which includes excess moisture and foreign materials, or
dockage, such as weeds, soil and pebbles.
   Foster said a Soviet newspaper in May 1988 charged that ``the
time has come for the leaders of the agro-industrial complex to
restructure this strange procedure ... and to stop deceiving both
themselves and us.''
   The Kremlin last summer published for the first time information
about the excess moisture and dockage in state grain procurements.
The government also announced that grain production figures would
be available on a clean-weight basis this May, he said.
   Losses to the 1988 Soviet grain harvest, which was reported by
Moscow at 195 million metric tons, were estimated by USDA at 11
percent, or 22 million tons. The big 1987 harvest of 211.4 million
tons had dockage and waste losses of 14 percent, or 30 million tons.
   Foster said the 1988 estimate ``reflects reduced grain output,
greater care in handling and dry harvesting conditions last
season.''
   But the losses appear to be endemic in the current production
system. According to the noted Soviet economist Nikolai Shmelev,
``Every year (the Soviet Union) loses as much as 25 percent of its
grain'' due to poor harvesting practices, bad processing and
storage and transport difficuties.
   Foster said a lack of drying facilities partly accounts for the
excessive moisture in Soviet grain crops, and ``even in dry
weather, the short growing season in the Siberian regions often
does not permit plants to dry out before harvest.''
   According to one authority, he said, a huge part of the Soviet
grain area is not harvested quickly enough, resulting in yearly
losses of 17 million to 20 million tons. Another authority said
that if the harvest could be shortened by only a week or 10 days,
yields could be boosted enough to produce an additional 30 million
to 40 million tons.
   Foster said the Soviet Union's use of grain as livestock feed
continues to rise to record levels, reflecting the government's
desire to boost the output of meat, poultry and dairy products.
   But the Soviets are trying to do this by increasing yields per
animal, while deemphasizing growth in animal numbers. However, he
said, there is reportedly much overfeeding of grains to livestock
because of a lack of proper balance in animal rations.
   For example, the share of grain in mixed livestock feed produced
by the state was reported at 68.4 percent in 1988. Comparatively,
the grain share in U.S. and West European mixed feeds is around 45
percent, which use much higher proportions of protein supplements.
   ``Soviet specialists report that at least 50 million to 60
million tons of all grain used for feed in the socialized sector is
fed nearly straight or only coarsely ground,'' Foster said. ``They
estimate that if properly balanced with oilmeals and other
additives, grain use could be reduced 16 million to 18 million tons
a year.''
   Furthermore, he said, improved livestock rations could free a
significant amount of high-quality wheat for human consumption.
   A much-publicized move to restrict vodka production has not had
much effect on total grain consumption. According to USDA's
estimates, the Soviet Union's total use of grain for industrial
purposes in 1988-89 will be unchanged from the five million tons
consumed in 1987-88.
   ``Although production of alcohol from grain may decrease, the
use of grain in non-alcoholic beverages likely will increase,''
Foster said. ``Output of vodka in 1987 (the latest year available)
fell another 16 percent to its lowest level in 31 years, reflecting
the Gorbachev strategy aimed at curbing alcohol consumption.''

walk-in clinics have changed the everyday practice of medicine.

<TEXT>
   Working at a hospital emergency
room in 1975, Dr. Robert Gordon sensed a business opportunity amid
the bad backs and twisted ankles he saw each day.
   ``The vast majority of cases didn't need to be seen in a
hospital. These were the people with cuts and bruises who were
waiting for hours,'' said the lanky practitioner. ``It seemed as
though something else would work better.''
   Gordon's notion was simple: A private clinic where people could
walk in without an appointment, see a doctor without a long wait
and walk out without a big bill.
   Fourteen years after Gordon started what is considered the first
walk-in clinic on a North Providence shopping strip, his idea has
been copied by giant health corporations, big-city medical centers,
community hospitals and individual doctors.
   Along the way, it has helped change the way many doctors work
and become one of the most visible examples of a quiet
transformation in American medicine _ the subtle evolution of
health care from a calling to a business.
   The mythical, almost saintly family doctor, the kindly dispenser
of compassion and prescriptions, is being replaced by 9-to-5
employees of large health enterprises and by entrepreneurs who
generate income by ordering tests on their diagnostic machines and
by selling drugs they prescribe.
   ``Everywhere you look, you see for-profit corporations providing
health care. In this climate, doctors start considering themselves
businessmen because they are treated as businessmen,'' said Dr.
Arnold Relman, editor of the New England Journal of Medicine and
perhaps the nation's most vocal critic of corporate medicine.
   Although by no means the only symptom of medicine as business,
the walk-ins have been a lightning rod for those who pine for a
return to medicine as they remember it. They criticize these
businesses for their in-and-out, no-hand-holding brand of treatment
and for what they sense is an unseemly concern for the bottom line.
   ``One of our tenets is continuity of care; the same doctor
seeing the same patient over time is much more efficient and
effective,'' said Dr. Jim Jones, president of the American Academy
of Family Physicians. At walk-in clinics ``that principle is being
violated.''
   While they have invited unflattering comparisons with hamburger
chains and muffler franchises _ they are often called
doc-in-the-boxes _ these clinics have changed the way doctors work.
   Many private practitioners now keep longer hours and hang out
signs offering walk-in service to attract new patients and keep old
ones. Hospitals have opened quick-care annexes to their emergency
wards and put their own store-front clinics downtown to serve as
magnets to attract patients to fill their empty beds.
   At least 4,000 walk-in clinics operate nationwide. Last year, 50
million patients paid them $2.5 billion to sooth minor aches and
ills. Their financial success, however, has been less than
stunning. Many who got into the enterprise learned that fast
medicine, like fast food, needs high volume to survive, and there
simply were not enough broken arms and bruised noggins to go around.
   Most analysts agree clinics must see 30 to 40 patients a day,
seven days a week, to stay out of the red.
   ``The people who use these services don't necessarily come back
because they aren't the sorts who want a regular sort of
medicine,'' said Regina Herzlinger, a Harvard Business School
professor and an expert on the business of health care.
   ``To make the practice viable, you had to always bring in new
recruits, and that's a very expensive way of doing any business,''
she said.
   Gordon and his early imitators initially billed themselves as
emergency or urgent care centers to emphasize their similarity to
the emergency room, but hospital administrators and doctors in
private practice complained that people with heart attacks or
serious injuries might mistake these shops for true emergency rooms
_ and die for their error.
   The early walk-in clinics were also viewed as money machines.
   ``Business people fell in love with the idea without realizing
the problems,'' said Chicago surgeon Bruce Flashner, who opened one
clinic after another starting in 1979.
   Humana Inc., the hospital chain, bought Flashner's 20 units for
$17 million in 1985 and eventually operated 150 MedFirst clinics
around the country.
   For most of the major franchise operators, however, the bubble
burst.
   Owners found they couldn't pull in enough patients and money to
cover the startup costs of $300,000 to $500,000 and high salaries
for doctors and nurses. Many clinics folded or were sold. Humana
closed or sold off its entire clinic operation, writing off $40
million.
   Despite the shakeout, the industry continues to grow. Many of
the newest outposts are operated by hospitals, which often view
them more as marketing tools than money makers. And despite the
condescending attitude of many health professionals toward these
clinics, they have no trouble attracting doctors.
   Most young physicians finish residency training with crushing
debts. They need jobs and cannot afford to buy established
practices or start new ones. However many, like Gordon, simply
prefer clinic medicine.
   ``I don't like getting involved with patients,'' he said. ``I
don't like long, protracted following of cases, seeing people over
the years and making little adjustments in their medication. I like
to see them and send them along.''
   Walk-ins are far cheaper than emergency rooms, but with base
fees ranging from $30 to $50, they are often more expensive than
traditional office doctors.
   Their success also depends on billing for more than the standard
office visit fee.
   ``You need other revenue generators, like X-rays and testing,''
said Nancy Kane, an assistant professor of management at the
Harvard School of Public Health who has studied the industry.
   Some doctors who have worked for a number of walk-in clinics
complain they are pressured or paid to do tests that may not be
necessary, a claim clinic officials deny.
   Health Stop, now the nation's largest chain with 112 units,
encourages its doctors to think of the clinic as their private
practice and to get patients to return for blood sugar checks, high
blood pressure consultations and other standard care.
   ``Sometimes I think we're re-inventing the private practice,''
said Dr. Joseph Maloney, Health Stop's executive vice president.
   Linda Douglas, a physician at an Oak Brook, Ill., Health Stop
unit, has seen shifting philosophies as owners changed in her three
years as a walk-in clinic doctor. Today she says some 80 percent of
the people she sees are regular patients.
   ``Initially, the gist of the thing was we just want to see
patients once,'' she recalled. ``Now you've got to have doctors
build a practice and if I don't deliver quality care to my
patients, they're not going to come back.''

<HEAD>Age Of Fetal Viability Lowered by Full Month Since Roe vs. Wade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1973, when the Supreme Court issued the Roe
vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion, the fate of babies born
more than two months premature was simple.
   They died. Almost invariably.
   In the 16 years since that court decision, advances in treatment
have lowered the age of viability for premature infants by a full
month.
   Human beings who at birth are smaller than a person's palm and
weigh just over a pound now are nurtured by an arsenal of
equipment, drugs and skills that didn't exist in 1973.
   Now, babies born in major hospitals after only 24 weeks of
gestation have a fighting chance to survive, flourish and go home.
   Thus, if certain conditions are met, some abortions still may be
performed on fetuses with a potential for viability outside the
womb, forcing hospitals, clinics and doctors to make rending
decisions that touch the very heart of the abortion controversy.
   Maureen C. Edwards, a physician who specializes in treating
premature babies at George Washington University Hospital, believes
that in many cases the lines have ``merged.''
   ``The therapeutic abortions are being performed within a range
that we might have a viable baby,'' said Dr. Edwards. Such
abortions usually folow prenatal tests, such as amniocentesis, that
detect some genetic abnormality in the infant, she said. But some
abortions at the edge of the second trimester are performed for the
convenience of the mother.
   ``There are places that will terminate at 23 or 24 weeks,'' said
Dr. Edwards. ``It is part of the problem.''
   The Supreme Court is hearing arguments Wednesday on a Missouri
case in which the justices are being asked to overturn or
substantially limit the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing
abortion. Among the issues before the court is a regulation that
requires doctors in some cases to determine whether the fetus is
viable. If such a determination is made, the regulation says, the
doctor must perform the abortion in a way best designed to preserve
fetal life.
   An infant brought into the world after only 24 weeks of
gestation faces an awesome struggle to survive. There's not a
single organ in the baby's body that is yet ready to live unaided
outside the womb. The lungs, heart, brain, liver and digestive
system all are only partially formed. All of the blood in the body
of such a baby equals only about three tablespoons.
   The lungs are usually the organs most threatened by early birth.
In many cases, the air sacs have yet to develop the blood vessels
needed for the body to absorb oxygen from inhaled air.
   A critical substance, surfactant, is also missing. This sudsy
protein, which a fetus usually develops in about the 30th week,
keeps the lungs from collapsing between breaths. Its absence often
leads to respiratory distress and death.
   In many cases, a premature infant's brain is not yet ready to
support life and is unable to control breathing and other automatic
body processes.
   Often, the preemies' heart valves and vessels are still
unfinished and not functioning well.
   And, almost invariably, the babies are unable to take food by
mouth, a factor that for decades meant death.
   ``The rule was, if they can't take food by gut, then they
died,'' recalled Dr. Edwards.
   In 1973, size alone could determine fate. Premature infants were
micro-creatures in a macro-world of medicine that was unable to
cope with miniscule needs.
   Needles were too large for veins almost as fine as human hair.
Breathing machines overpowered fragile lungs. Medicine or nutrition
could not be delivered in the precise, fractional measure needed.
Some babies actually drowned when health care workers attempted to
feed or medicate them using intravenous, gravity drips.
   But the doctors and nurses kept trying, and learning. Mistakes
that cost lives in 1973 became knowledge that saves lives today.
   Catheters small enough for the infants were made and became
common in nurseries. Engineers developed a micro-pump that splits a
daily dose of liquid nutrition or medicine into fractional ounces
and delivers the precise amount, drop by drop, through the
catheters to the small, struggling humans.
   Nutritionists learned how to feed babies by needle, helped by
the micro-pumps to deliver the exact balance of sugar, fat and
protein in small doses.
   New ventilators were developed to deliver air to incubators at
the exact pressure, temperature and humidity needed for tiny lungs.
   Medical workers began to recognize that it was possible to save
these small humans and the challenge attracted new talents. Doctors
and nurses who might have chosen other types of medicine now worked
with premature infants in the nursery.
   ``The possibility of intervention brings more people into the
field,'' said Dr. Charlotte Catz of the National Institute of Child
Care and Human Development, a part of the National Institutes of
Health. ``The passive observer is not a very exciting thing.''
   All of these factors worked together to slowly drop the
viability age to 24 weeks.
   ``There hasn't been a single breakthrough, but more a
refinement,'' said Ernest N. Kraybill, a neonatal expert on the
faculty at the University of North Carolina school of medicine.
``There's been a refinement of both our technology and our ability
to use it on very small babies. We're now having the results with
700-gram babies that we once had with 1200-gram babies.''
   The survival rate at the limit of viability, now less than 50
percent, may improve soon when researchers perfect an artificial
surfactant, the protein that helps the lungs absorb oxygen. The new
drug is now being tested in selected hospitals and appears to be
successful in relieving some respiratory problems of the premature.
   But experts don't expect the age of viability for preemies to
ever drop below 24 weeks.
   ``In most species, premature babies just don't live. Premature
puppies don't live. Premature sheep don't live,'' said Dr. Edwards.
``There is a natural limit.''
   ``I think we are at the limit now,'' said Dr. Maria
Delivoia-Papadopoulos, chief of perinatal services at the
University of Pennsylvania Hospital. ``Below 24 weeks, the whole
system _ brain, lungs, heart _ is not developed enough.''
   More and more, doctors also are questioning whether society
should push for survival below 24 weeks.
   By some estimates, it takes about $1 million dollars to assure
just a year's survival for a baby born three months premature. And
nearly all such children require later medical care to correct
problems of prematurity.
   ``When you think about ... the tremendous cost for that purpose
and contrast it with all the simple, inexpensive things that need
to be done for bigger babies with better prospects of survival _
such as immunization _ it suggests that we maybe shouldn't be
investing resources into such extremely high technology for a tiny
group of babies with such poor prospects,'' said Kraybill.
``Keeping 23-week babies alive may not be an appropriate national
priority.''

   ``Clean and Sober'' (Warner Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated
R)
   
   Michael Keaton, a genuinely funny comic actor who never really
hit his stride in film comedies, emerges as a dramatic actor of
astonishing power in ``Clean and Sober,'' an excellent movie about
the wasting disease that doesn't lend itself to the last act in
opera.
   This is one of those movies that everybody avoided because all
the critics everyone really detests were crazy about it and
Keaton's poor taste in scripts had eroded one's good opinion of him.
   ``Johnny Dangerously,'' ``Mr. Mom,'' ``The Squeeze'' and their
ilk probably cost Keaton an Academy Award nomination for his fine
work in ``Clean and Sober'' as a real estate broker up to his ears
in debt and up to his nose in cocaine.
   Our hero wakes up one morning with a comatose girl in his bed.
So to dodge the cops, he chugs a couple of beers and checks into a
drug rehabilitation clinic.
   Kathy Baker does a fine job as the troubled woman he meets in
``detox,'' Morgan Freeman is excellent as the ex-addict rehab
counselor and the brilliant M. Emmet Walsh plays the
alcoholic-addict who tries to help our hero get straight.
   Keaton is in superb touch with his character throughout, playing
his part with an honest simplicity that is genuine and affecting.
   Screenwriter Tod Carroll can be faulted for taking a
conventional approach to the subject, but avoids the cliches for a
messier truth. Director Glenn Gordon Caron (of TV's
``Moonlighting'') faultlessly handles the material.
   Each generation of Hollywood filmmakers seems to rediscover
addiction as a mirror of the human soul. That's how we got ``Lost
Weekend,'' ``The Man With the Golden Arm,'' ``The Days of Wine and
Roses'' and other less distinguished films. ``Clean and Sober'' is
one for the '80s, and one of the best.

   ``Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death'' (Paramount
Home Video. VHS, $79.95; Beta, $29.95. Rated PG-13)
   
   There's an imaginary jungle stretching from Bakersfield, Calif.,
to the Mexican border. This is where all the avocados grow. It also
is where the ancient Amazon commune of man-eating piranha women
live, as well as the dreaded barracuda women.
   If you can buy all of that, then you'll have no trouble with
``Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death.'' Or maybe you
will, because the movie is stupid and silly no matter how you look
at it.
   It takes a stab at some sort of backwards humor about feminism
and male chauvinism. But it's merely pretentious and not very funny.
   Adrienne Barbeau plays a talk show anthropolgist whose lines
read like something out of junior high school. When she's fencing
with Margo Hunt (Shannon Tweed), a feminism instructor, she
congratulates herself on her good form and says, ``I learned in the
ancient weaponry course at Berkeley.''
   Later, when she throws herself into a seething piranha pit, she
says, ``You don't know how degrading it is to be on the David
Letterman Show! I can't go back to that!''
   The acting is as wooden as the actors.
   Bad jokes abound. So do misadventures as Margo, Bunny (Karen
Mistral) and Jim (Bill Maher), a clumsy Indiana Jones-type, enter
the jungle to save the Free World's supply of avocados, and the
pickers, from the voracious females.
   But there's a happy ending. The bad guys are defeated, and the
piranha women and the barracuda women unite and live happily ever
after in the jungle, protected as a primitive culture.
   Oh, in case you need to know: The prime difference between the
two groups is that the piranhas ``tear their men into strips like
beef jerky and eat them with guacamole dip,'' while the barrcudas
insist on clam dip.
   Running time is an eternal 90 minutes.

   Symphony No. 29 in A major, K. 201; Symphony No. 39 in E flat
major, K. 543; Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Herbert
Von Karajan (Deutsche Grammaphon)
   
   One way to take your Mozart is like coffee _ light and sweet.
Herbert von Karajan tends more towards dark, no sugar in this
recording of two Mozart symphonies: No. 29, one of the composer's
first great symphonies, and No. 39, from the final troika of
masterpieces.
   What a marvelous, sleek machine the Berlin Philharmonic is. Like
a lustrous Mercedes-Benz sedan, it glides through symphonies. The
orchestra's character is that it needs no character, because its
sheer sound is so perfect. Karajan, the aging potentate of European
music, brings slow tempos, some beautiful effects and a weighty
intensity that occasionally borders on the plodding.
   The A major symphony, written by the 17-year-old Mozart, has one
of the most marvelous openings of his symphonies, an inviting,
mysterious murmur in the strings. The andante is a serenade, played
lovingly by the Berlin strings. Karajan elicits an appropriately
courtly dance quality to the third movement menuetto. The orchestra
brings clarity and spirit to the churning final allegro con spirito.
   The highlight of the disc comes in the adagio introduction of
the E flat symphony. Karajan and his forces are at their best,
bringing an expansiveness and tautness to this grandiose, operatic
section. The clarinets, which take the place of oboes in this
symphony, have some lovely melodies. In loud passionate passages of
the second movement, Karajan sometimes errs on the side of the
plodding when trying to sound intense. In another section,
successive woodwind entrances sound beautiful but aimless.
   On the basis of the second movement, it's no surprise that the
minuet sounds a little relentless. The jaunty final allegro lacks a
little in jaunt. Fast passages are clean but lifeless.
   This disc is a thing of beauty, but for listeners who want more
interesting recent Mozart symphonic issues, consider recordings by
Sir Charles Mackerras and the Prague Chamber Orcehstra on Telarc.

   ``The Raw &amp; The Cooked'' (MCA) _ Fine Young Cannibals
   
   There are dozens and dozens of bands out there making
nondescript, electronic pop music. Some of it's pleasant enough but
most fades quickly from memory.
   Those bands don't have a voice. What sets Fine Young Cannibals
apart is a Gift _ lead singer Roland Gift, to be precise.
   Roland Gift is the vocalist ex-English Beat members Andy Cox
(guitars) and David Steele (keyboards and bass) found singing for a
British R&amp;B band in a London pub. Together, they formed Fine Young
Cannibals in 1985.
   On ``The Raw &amp; The Cooked,'' Fine Young Cannibals' second album,
Gift shifts from breathy falsetto to raw, wrenching yells to a
lower register that sounds as if his throat is lined with oak.
   The result is a remarkable vocal performance not heard since the
death of Otis Redding _ to whom Gift is often compared.
   ``The Raw &amp; The Cooked'' is, above all, a fun record. You can
dance to the bright guitar hook of ``She Drives Me Crazy,'' while
the hit ``Good Thing'' and another tune, ``It's OK (It's Alright)''
are both R&amp;B numbers made to move you.
   There's straight, guitar-based rock 'n' roll on ``Don't Look
Back,'' which showcases Andy Cox's ringing style, reminiscent of
early Beatles or Byrds.
   But back to the Gift. Two songs, if played back to back,
demonstrate his incredible vocal range.
   ``I'm Not the Man I Used to Be'' is a gripping ballad that finds
Gift pleading with a woman to stay with him even though he's weak.
And on ``As Hard As It Is,'' Gift takes his voice way down low to
show strength in the face of adversity.
   Fine Young Cannibals is a fine young band with a possibly great
lead singer. The tunes are catchy and intelligent, if a bit
over-electronic.
   If only the group had a drummer instead of a drum machine to put
a floor under it all _ but who's complaining?

   ``Sunshine on Leith'' (Chrysalis) _ The Proclaimers
   
   Garage rock meets Celtic folk music in an Edinburgh pub and the
result is this jaunty album from The Proclaimers. Twin brothers
Charlie and Craig Reid have written a collection of songs that
would sound best live in a crowded, smoky tavern.
   The simple arrangements and spare production of this record come
close to capturing that sound. Nothing artificial here _ or at
least it sounds as though each song might have been recorded in one
take.
   The politics of frustration are heard in ``What Do You Do'' and
``Cap in Hand'' (``I can't understand why we let someone else rule
our land''). But the more common theme is love conquering sorrow
(``Then I Met You,'' ``I'm on My Way,'' ``Oh Jean''). And ``Come on
Nature'' is a delightfully honest expression of sexual desire (``I
just want to spend some time being boy to the girl'').
   The Reid brothers and their band have made good use of varied
influences, including a touch of American country. But a distinctly
Scottish sound comes through, not only in their accents, but in the
stomping beat of many of their songs. And as ``Oh Jean'' builds to
its finish, the words ``I love her I love her'' are sung over and
over like the drone note of a bagpipe.
   The lyrics are unsophisticated, sometimes even trite, the vocals
rough and throaty. The tables and chairs are of bare wood, the
floor is grimy and the light is bad. Faded photographs and flags
hang from the... Well, you get the picture.

<HEAD>Star Watch: A Good Movie Makes You Cry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Samuel Goldwyn never read ``Wuthering Heights,''
but that didn't stop him from producing the classic film with
Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon.
   He knew little about baseball, but still insisted on making
``Pride of the Yankees,'' the story of Lou Gehrig.
   He always referred to Lillian Hellman's play, ``The Little
Foxes,'' as ``The Three Little Foxes,'' and he fought with Warner
Bros. to allow Bette Davis to star in the movie.
   For Goldwyn, one of Hollywood's most celebrated and colorful
producers, what mattered was a good story, especially one that
could make him cry.
   ``He was deeply drawn to people films, to emotional subjects,''
said A. Scott Berg, author of ``Goldwyn: A Biography'' ($24.95,
Knopf), an extensive biography of the film mogul. ``His serious
films have great, emotional moments in them. I think he poured all
his bottled-up emotions into those movies.''
   Goldwyn's own life had all the drama of his best films. He was
born Schmuel Gelbfisz in 1879, the son of a struggling Warsaw
antique dealer. The young Gelbfisz had no desire to remain with his
impoverished family, leaving by foot at age 16 with a vow to go to
America and never return.
   He boarded a passenger ship in Liverpool late in 1898. Goldwyn
later claimed that upon reaching the United States on New Year's
Day 1899, he kissed the ground. Calling himself Samuel Goldfish,
the young immigrant found work in upstate New York as a glovemaker
and eventually became a salesman, earning enough money to buy a
brownstone on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
   On a muggy afternoon in 1913, his life changed forever. Goldfish
left his Fifth Avenue office and headed uptown. When he reached
34th Street, he decided to check out the ``flickers'' at the Herald
Square Theater.
   Like Adolph Zukor, Louis B. Mayer and other immigrants, Goldfish
instantly saw the potential of moving pictures and decided he
wanted to be part of ``a whole new, exciting world.''
   In 1916, he and theater producer Edgar Selwyn formed Goldwyn
Pictures (Goldfish later adapted the company's name for himself).
Selwyn dropped out, and Goldwyn went on to produce movies for more
than 40 years.
   ``Goldwyn saw the movies as a medium by which he could invent
this character called `Goldwyn,''' Berg said. ``How could you be
`The Great Goldwyn' making gloves. I think he saw he could have a
universal stamp.''
   The universal stamp, what the producer would call ``The Goldwyn
Touch,'' was a series of powerful dramas such as ``Wuthering
Heights,'' ``Dodsworth,'' and the 1946 Academy Award-winner, ``The
Best Years of Our Lives'' _ movies that brought tears to the eyes
of millions of moviegoers, especially Goldwyn.
   ``He brought his emotions into those movies,'' Berg said, ``Not
just making them, but watching them. That's part of the key to his
success as a filmmaker. When he watched them, he became an
audience.''
   Instead of using the sophisticated market research today's
studio businessmen employ, Goldwyn just followed his heart.
   ``If he cried, it worked,'' Berg said. ``When he saw the
birthday sequence of `Stella Dallas' for the first time, when no
one shows up for her daughter's birthday, he wept and wept and
wept. Then he saw the end when Stella's out there in the rain and
is pushed along by a policeman. He sobbed everytime he saw the
movie.''
   ``Wuthering Heights,'' ``Best Years,'' ``The Little Foxes'' and
``Dodsworth'' were all directed by William Wyler, with whom Goldwyn
had a relationship best compared to that of New York Yankee owner
George Steinbrenner and manager Billy Martin.
   Again and again, the two stubborn immigrants fought, with the
director vowing never to work for Goldwyn and the producer becoming
enraged over Wyler's fondness for numerous retakes.
   ``They both wanted the same thing, as Wyler told me time and
again,'' the author said. ``They fought about how to make a picture
better. They were artistic fights.''
   Goldwyn's films may have made people cry, but the producer's
mangling of the English language was a source of great amusement.
Everyone in Hollywood had a favorite ``Goldwynism.'' When warned
that ``The Little Foxes'' was a ``caustic'' play, Goldwyn snapped
back, ``I don't give a damn how much it costs. Buy it!'' He would
back out of uncomfortable situations by insisting, ``Include me
out!''
   While the filmmaker once groaned to his analyst, ``I hate my
mouth,'' Berg insisted that even Goldwyn was amused by his
malapropisms.
   ``I think he reached a point where he realized just how charming
they were. His analyst would assure him that they were endearing.
People weren't laughing at him. They loved him for them. It ain't
bad being in Walter Winchell's column every day.''
   Goldwyn died in 1974, outlasting nearly all his contemporaries.
As Berg noted, while Mayer, Zukor and the other moguls were
eventually kicked upstairs, Goldwyn remained his own boss.
   ``I think the crucial theme is survival,'' Berg said. ``Goldwyn
was front and center all that time. He always worked against the
tide. He figured it may be tougher swimming, but in the end he'll
get there.''

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most scions of Hollywood's founding fathers
guard the family archives as if they were CIA files. But Samuel
Goldwyn Jr. gave total access to his father's biographer, A. Scott
Berg.
   ``I felt it was the only way I could attract a first-class
biographer,'' said the younger Goldwyn, himself the head of a
prosperous film company. ``It's a gamble you take.
   ``My father said he wanted `an honest book.' I took him at his
word. I'm not sure if he were alive that he would want it quite so
honest. I think that it is on the whole an honest biography. When
someone gives you 8{ years of his life to do this book, as Scott
did, you have to take that chance.''
   Why did it take so long to research and write ``Goldwyn: A
Biography'' (Knopf, $24.95)?
   ``Research, research, research,'' the 39-year-old author said.
``I was given access to a real treasure trove of material,
basically 50 years of Hollywood history, none of which anyone had
ever gone through. So it was all there for the first time.
   ``I immediately realized that with this material I could tell
the whole history of Hollywood. So I wanted to interview as many
people as I could from the various eras that were included. I
interviewed about 250 people, of whom 60 are dead now.''
   Goldwyn and Berg were interviewed at the Century City offices of
The Goldwyn Co. Young Sam operates in his own manner, building his
company with smaller films and foreign releases. He's now branching
out with big-name movies such as ``Stella'' with Bette Midler.
   Goldwyn appears to have escaped the soul-numbing later life that
has afflicted many sons of the pioneers. How?
   ``I had a very strong father, but I also had one who taught me
that the most important thing is to survive,'' he said. ``If
there's any one message in this book, it's about survival _ human
survival in Hollywood.''
   Berg added: ``If Sam Goldwyn was not the most interesting of
Hollywood producers, he was certainly the most quintessential. I
thought his life would be the most interesting lens through which I
could tell the whole history of the movies.
   ``What sustained me throughout was that I genuinely admired him
for the career he put together. We're all dealt a hand at birth,
and I think he was dealt a lousy one _ a lot of twos, threes and
fours, no picture cards.
   ``There he was in Poland at the height of the pogroms. His
family situation he was not crazy about: His father died while he
was very young, and he was responsible for the support of his
mother and five siblings. Pretty awful. Nothing going for him
except this enormous drive, enormous energy, enormous will to
survive.''
   Like many immigrants in the early century, he was drawn to the
movie business. He joined with Jesse Lasky and Cecil B. DeMille to
produce one of Hollywood's first features, ``The Squaw Man.'' But
Goldwyn could never tolerate partners, and he soon launched his own
company.
   Many people thought the producer was part of
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Not so. He had sold his interest in his
company, which kept the Goldwyn name, by the time it merged with
Louis B. Mayer's studio and the Metro Co.
   As an independent, the Samuel Goldwyn Co. produced an
astonishing number of classics: ``Stella Dallas,'' ``Dodsworth,''
``Dead End,'' ``Wuthering Heights,'' ``The Little Foxes, ``The
Pride of the Yankees,'' ``The Best Years of Our Lives,'' ``Guys and
Dolls.'' His last movie was a disappointing adaptation of the
Broadway hit ``Porgy and Bess'' in 1958.
   Goldwyn suffered a stroke in 1969 and died in 1974 at age 94.
The Samuel Goldwyn Co. dissolved. Sam Jr.'s firm, The Goldwyn Co.,
was an entirely new enterprise, but it did retain the original
Goldwyn film catalog.
   Berg, who wrote the acclaimed ``Max Perkins: Editor of Genius,''
covers it all and provides a few surprises. The major one: the
great love in the life of Frances Goldwyn, Sam's wife, was director
George Cukor (``My Fair Lady'').
   Despite Mrs. Goldwyn's deep feelings, the relationship was
platonic, since Cukor was a homosexual. Nevertheless, Mrs. Goldwyn
arranged for Cukor to be buried at Forest Lawn alongside herself,
her husband and her mother.

<HEAD>The Artists: Painting Is Very Much Like Cooking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIA TEJERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first sale Fernando Botero ever
made was in his hometown of Medellin, Colombia, back in the late
1940s. He was a 15-year-old who amused himself by doing watercolors
of bullfights and matadors.
   More than 40 years later, Botero is an internationally famous
painter who has returned to the fiesta brava of the bullfight. But
don't expect blood and sand and moments of truth: His chubby
bullfighters parade around the ring with smiles of anticipation,
and even the dignified picadors have the air of a Sunday outing.
   A courtly 57, Botero considers himself a completely Latin
American artist, although it would be hard to find real-life
counterparts of his voluptously overweight prostitutes and children
anywhere on the continent.
   Or, for that matter, of his famous self-portrait with Louis XIV,
with a tiny Botero in a business suit next to an impressively
rotund monarch in full regalia.
   ``My painting is based on Latin America. It's what I know
best,'' he says. ``I could never paint a North American subject,
for instance. I don't see myself painting George Washington.
   ``Of course, what you see in my paintings you won't find in
Colombia. One captures the essence. It is not a matter of standing
in front of reality and painting a picture postcard. I'm a painter,
not an illustrator.''
   Botero was in Caracas to inaugurate, at the Museo de Arte
Contemporaneo, a showing of 100 drawings and oil paintings on
bullfighting.
   ``My uncle Joaquin was a fanatic aficionado, and he would take
me to the plaza to see the best toreadors from Spain and Mexico.
Manolete, El Cordobes and Dominguin, all the best ones came to
Medellin during the winter, when the season is over in Europe. My
uncle was such a fanatic, he wanted me to be a matador, too. So he
enrolled me in a school in Medellin.''
   Botero never became a toreador, much less a matador (the highest
grade of toreador). He was not a success at the Medellin bull
fighting school, and still recalls the terror he felt when he faced
his first and only bull. However, he liked the colorful spectacle
and, when he began painting at the age of 14, started with
watercolors of the corridas and the picadors (horseback riders who
direct the bull with long lances, or ``picas.'')
   ``There was a craftsman who had a workshop near the bull ring,
where he sold tickets for the corridas,'' says Botero in the
introduction he wrote for the exhibit's catalog. ``One day, he saw
my watercolors and he said, `Give them to me, I'll put them in the
window and maybe someone will buy when they buy tickets.' And that
is how I sold my first paintings.''
   This was before he was expelled from a Jesuit-run high school
for writing an article on ``Picasso and Non-Conformism in Art'' for
the local newspaper.
   Critics always use the word ``humor'' to describe a Botero
painting, but Botero himself is dead serious about his work and
sees himself as a pioneer for ``bringing back volume to modern
art.''
   In the 1960s and '60s, when he was living in New York, he had
``the courage to try something different in spite of the absolute
dictatorship of abstract art, to go against current fashions and
what my friends and fellow artists were doing ... the history of
painting is the history of those who dare to paint differently.''
   His technique is painstaking, building up layers and layers of
paint, trying to imitate as much as possible the richness and depth
of the Italian Quattrocento, the period he most admires.
   ``Painting,'' he says, ``is very much like cooking. You keep
adding ingredients you like _ a touch of this, a touch of that, a
touch of humor _ until you get what you want.''
   He believes all his fellow Latin American artists should travel
and visit museums and galleries abroad, and not stay at home out of
misguided patriotism. It's not just that travel broadens the mind,
he says. ``It's a matter of keeping up standards. If an artist
doesn't measure himself against real quality, he stagnates and
grows soft.''
   Botero lives in Bogota most of the time with his second wife,
the sculptor Sophia Vari, but spends at least a few months every
year in Paris or New York.
   As famous as his work is, one painting is renowned throughout
Latin America. His ``Official Portrait of the Military Junta
(1971),'' gathers every single cliche about the military
dictatorships that have haunted Latin America.
   There they are: The Man on Horseback. The Moustachioed Colonel
Dripping Medals. The Mistress with Her Mink Stoles.
   Stripped by Botero of all power to terrify, they gaze out of the
frame, fat, pink and ridiculous.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a Quaker, Bonnie Raitt has devoted long hours
to the cause of world peace. Once she straps a guitar around her
shoulder, however, the gloves come off.
   Equally adept at singing hard rockers and soulful ballads, she
emphasized in a recent interview that at 39, she does not intend to
mellow with age.
   Her new album, ``Nick of Time,'' contains music worthy of such
titles as ``I Will Not Be Denied,'' ``Real Man'' and ``I Ain't
Gonna Let You Break My Heart Again.''
   ``If anybody had any doubts about how I feel, they can just
listen to those three songs. `I Will Not Be Denied' is the
strongest statement on what I feel about love at the moment. The
songs are cathartic and I will be not denied. I will get what I
deserve. When you get beat up, you eventually stop taking it.''
   The past decade has been difficult for Raitt. Warner Bros., her
longtime record label, dropped her in 1983, refusing to release the
album she had just completed for three years. Contractual
difficulties forced her to tour without a band for the last two
years, and she had to overcome a drinking problem.
   But her luck has begun to change. When producer Hal Wilner put
together an album of Disney songs last year, he paired Raitt with
Don Was of Was (Not Was) on ``Baby Mine,'' from the ``Dumbo''
soundtrack. Raitt and Was became fast friends and he ended up
producing ``Nick of Time,'' released on Capitol Records.
   The album's 11 songs include covers of John Hiatt and Jerry L.
Williams as well as two Raitt compositions.
   ``I wanted to make it a roots, stripped down record,'' she said.
``It was an easily accomplished, well thought out, very smooth
album _ the best recording situation I've ever had.''
   Raitt, the daughter of Broadway singer John Raitt, was born in
Los Angeles and quickly became interested in music, learning folk
songs at summer camp.
   ``All the counselors were from colleges that were experiencing a
folk music revival. Being a little 10-year-old impressionable kid,
I idolized my counselors. I completely bought into Bob Dylan's
lyrics as seriously as the rest of America, but I was a little
kid.''
   Joan Baez was also an early favorite.
   ``She killed me when I was a kid. She was Quaker also. I wanted
so badly to have long hair and be thin. I'd look in the mirror and
wonder when I was going to get cheekbones.''
   Raitt's musical interests broadened as a teen-ager. She would
listen to early rock 'n' roll and soul music, and began a lifetime
passion for blues after entering Radcliffe College in 1967.
   ``Through the college radio station I met Dick Waterman, who
managed `Big Boy' Crudup and Mississippi John Hurt and had helped
rediscover Son House. We became really good friends and through him
I met all those blues guys. I got to travel, carry their things for
them and got to know all of them and watch them play.
   ``I was a complete blues nut but I never expected to do this for
a living. I just kind of played as a hobby. Then one day I needed
to make some money and a girl was playing at a club. I knew I was
at least as good as her.''
   Raitt's first two albums, ``Bonnie Raitt'' and ``Give It Up,''
came out in the early 1970s and showed her love of jazz, soul,
blues, folk and rock. She covered songs by the Marvelettes, Stephen
Stills, Jackson Browne and blues singer Sippie Wallace, another
major influence.
   Although just in her early 20s, Raitt showed surprising depth
and confidence, tackling the complex emotional themes of ``Love Has
No Pride'' and ``Too Long at the Fair.''
   ``People call and say the songs have really touched them, that a
song has gotten them through a difficult period or they met their
boyfriends through my show. You either touch people or you don't,
and if you're lucky you get to do it for a living.''
   She used a variety of producers in the '70s, including Paul
Rothchild and Peter Asher, who also worked with Linda Ronstadt and
James Taylor.
   ``I basically produce myself,'' Raitt said. ``I pick the songs
with the collaboration of the producer. The producer's a partner,
another set of ears. It's a voice of rationality when I get too
emotionally involved. ... You need to have a partner in there
because it's a lot of pressure.''
   Her political and musical interests merged in 1979 when she
helped organize the celebrated MUSE (Musicians United for Safe
Energy) concerts at Madison Square Garden. She continues to help
with a variety of causes, including the anti-apartheid movement in
South Africa, and the campaign against deforestation in the Amazon
jungle.
   ``I used to go to peace marches and civil rights marches when I
was a kid. I stuffed envelopes when I was 11. I first picked up the
guitar when I was a little kid because Bob Dylan and Joan Baez were
singing protest songs at peace marches.
   ``Justice is justice, whether it's between a man and a woman or
a guy and his dog.''
   Raitt concludes ``Nick of Time'' with an original song, ``The
Road's My Middle Name,'' a bluesy stomp that reaffirms her
dedication to music.
   ``I never pretended to be a great artist or a great
originator,'' she said. ``I'm just an interpreter of good music. If
my voice and guitar playing, sensibility of putting together a
band, and arrangement of songs appeals to a certain group of
people, then all I need is enough fans to allow me to pay the
musicians.''

<TEXT>
   Through the 446 pages of Margaret Atwood's new
novel, ``Cat's Eye,'' characters help each other, hurt each other,
grow up, get jobs marry, have children, divorce. Some even die.
   And the book's narrator, Elaine Risley, actually forgets events
depicted at the beginning of the story.
   Atwood, author of the acclaimed best seller, ``The Handmaid's
Tale,'' has always been interested in the process of time:
accelerating it, slowing it, even freezing it like a still picture.
   ``I think it's why people write time travel stories,'' said
Atwood, one of Canada's best known writers. ``I remember being
quite riveted by H.G. Wells' `Time Machine.'''
   ``Cat's Eye'' (Doubleday, $18.95) is one of the author's most
personal novels. Elaine is a middle-aged Canadian painter returning
to her hometown of Toronto for an exhibit of her work.
   Several of the events described in ``Cat's Eye'' come from
Atwood's own life.
   Like Atwood, Elaine lived for several years in the Canadian
wilderness as a child, had a free-spirited mother and a father who
was an entomologist given to expounding theories about the fate of
the world. While Atwood has resented being too closely identified
with the characters of her previous stories, she doesn't hesitate
to agree that she and Elaine have much in common.
   ``It's wonderful material, great material. How could I not use
it? When things you found so interesting and wonderful are gone,
you want to know they exist somewhere so you put them in a book.''
   The novel's title refers to a blue marble that Elaine first
acquires as a child and manages to hold onto throughout her life.
While everything else in ``Cat's Eye'' is affected by the passage
of time, the marble remains unchanged, a tangible reminder of
Elaine's childhood.
   ``I think we all remember through objects a lot,'' Atwood said.
``We remember a lot through smells, but I think we remember a great
deal through items in our lives.
   ``If it's a city, we remember through landmarks. Whenever you
see those things, you remember something in your life. A lot of
things are remembered through popular songs. There are some songs
in the book as well. All of those things I think are keys to
memory.''
   ``Cat's Eye'' is closer in style and content to earlier novels
such as ``Life Before Man'' and ``Lady Oracle,'' than to ``The
Handmaid's Tale,'' which imagines life in a country run by
right-wing extremists. As Atwood explained, she had little concern
about following up such a popular book.
   ``I always just go along in my own way. I'm a writer who got
popular by accident. I've always written literary books, and I'll
continue to write them.
   ``I think it's very nice that I have a large audience but that
wasn't the general idea. I think every once in a while someone
comes along like an E.L. Doctorow who somehow clicks into
something.''
   She admitted to having doubts about ``The Handmaid's Tale,'' now
being made into a feature film starring Natasha Richardson and
Robert Duvall, worrying it would not be well received.
   ``I think it could have been an artistic disaster. Writing
utopia is tricky, it can easily get detoured into a tour of the
sewage plant. It can become a depiction of society that excludes
the characters.''
   But having considered the novel for many years, Atwood felt she
could no longer put it off.
   ``It was interfering with all the other books I was trying to
write,'' she said. ``It kept getting into other work where it
didn't belong. The only way to stop it from doing that was to write
this book.''
   Born in Ottawa in 1939, Atwood was first known for her poetry,
winning the Governor General's Award in 1966 for ``Circle Game,''
an anthology.
   Her first novel, ``The Edible Woman,'' came out in 1969 to mixed
reviews but ``Surfacing,'' ``The Lady Oracle'' and ``Life Before
Man'' established her as an exceptionally witty writer with
interests ranging from the environment to the transience of modern
relationships.
   ``I think many, many areas always go into your writing,'' Atwood
explained. ``That's one of the differences with novels or being a
dentist. A dentist excludes everything except what he's
concentrating on, whereas being a writer is the art of synthesis,
it's inclusionary, because life is multiple; it includes
everything.''
   In ``Cat's Eye,'' she has some fun at her own expense when
Elaine spots a poster of herself _ with a mustache:
   ``Whoever drew this mustache knew what he was doing. Or she:
nothing precludes that. It's a curled flowing mustache, like a
cavalier's, with a graceful goatee to match. It goes with my hair.''
   Atwood, whose novels have often been called feminist because of
their hard-edged look at how women cope in a male-dominated world,
shows men in a more positive light in ``Cat's Eye,'' giving
affectionate portrayals of Elaine's father, brother and second
husband. In fact, women are responsible for much of the wrongdoing,
especially Elaine's childhood friends, who subject her to endless
ridicule and cruelty.
   ``I was getting a little tired of the view that all men were
horrible. In the Victorian age, women had to be good or somehow
better.''
   But Atwood, who called one of her poetry collections ``Power
Politics,'' has not softened her outlook.
   ``The foreground is women's culture, but the background is men's
culture, ready to strike. Every once in a while, the background
comes to the foreground. We think we live in a peaceful country but
it's an illusion.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Buck Owens And Ringo Starr Team Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Resurgent country music star Buck Owens
says ``doodling around'' with former Beatle Ringo Starr was a
milestone of his long career.
   Owens, the former grinning co-host of the ``Hee Haw'' syndicated
TV show, and Starr recently recorded a duet of the song ``Act
Naturally.'' Both had separately released the song in the 1960s.
   ``I've never had so much fun in all my life,'' the 59-year-old
Owens said about his recording session with Starr in London at the
Abbey Road Studios, where the Beatles recorded often.
   ``I'd been out of music for a while and so had he,'' Owens said.
``He played me a little bit of drums. `Doodling around' we called
it. He's very talented.''
   The much anticipated record will probably be released this
summer.
   ``How many people get a chance to sing with Ringo Starr?'' Owens
mused as he reflected on his career upswing.
   The duet marked another achievement in a rebounding career for
Owens, who left ``Hee Haw'' in 1986 after 17 years on the country
music comedy show.
   In the past year, he re-emerged as a recording artist after
about 10 years away from the studio to concentrate on his business
interests. He and rising country star Dwight Yoakam teamed up on
the No. 1 country hit, ``Streets of Bakersfield.''
   The song added to Owens' long list of honky-tonk hits, including
``I've Got a Tiger by the Tail,'' ``Together Again,'' ``My Heart
Skips a Beat,'' ``Love's Gonna Live Here,'' ``Gonna Have You,''
``Buckaroo,'' ``Only You'' and ``Before You Go.''
   As a songwriter, he composed ``Crying Time'' which was a hit by
Ray Charles.
   In April, in honor of Owens' many contributions to country
music, the Academy of Country Music gave him its Pioneer Award.
   Owens, in keeping with his return to the stage, said he'll
probably show up on ``Hee Haw'' again. ``I left a lot of friends
there,'' he said in an interview.
   ``I loved doing it. It was lots of fun.''
   He quit for much the same reason he ceased his recording career
in 1979: too much exposure.
   ``I felt that doing the same show for that long might be like
being married to the same woman too long,'' he said.
   A fateful meeting in Owens' office in Bakersfield, Calif., led
to his return to the recording scene. Yoakam showed up one day and
he and Owens hit it off immediately.
   ``When I first saw him, I saw a rebel,'' Owens recalled. ``I saw
in him a freshness, an absolute attitude of `I'm going to play my
music my way.' He has great charisma and he could be the next big
superstar.
   ``He could be able to sell as many records as George Strait or
Randy Travis or some of the others.
   ``It's been brewing, this rage toward more traditional country
music. You began to see the tip of the cowboy hat and then the
hurricane came: Highway 101, the Desert Rose Band, Rodney Crowell
and all these people bringing good pickin' and attracting young
concert goers.''
   ``I guess I missed it (cutting records) more than I thought I
would. I remember my wife saying, `Get something to do or you're
going to kill us all.''
   So he teamed up with Yoakam and also released the solo album
``Hog Dog.'' He began scheduling concert appearances where his
famous red, white and blue guitar could be seen in public again.
Then the duet with Starr materialized.
   Owens described the ``Act Naturally'' duet as ``his version and
my version and our version and a little surprise or two along the
way. He gives a little Texas-type yell. I guess you'd call it
country rock.
   ``Ringo sings it better than ever. His voice is much broader
than it was when he was with the Beatles,'' he said. ``He was very
friendly and posed for pictures with anybody who asked. He was
about the most approachable famous person I've ever met.
   ``I'm thinking about how best the record can be received. I
don't want to gimmick it up.
   ``I've got a good feeling about the song. We did one song only,
but we talked about other things. We might do another track and may
do a video.''
   Owens said Starr has a keen sense of humor and would be a good
guest on ``Hee Haw.''
   ``He'd fit right in.''

<HEAD>Bush Administration Blocks Japanese Purchase Of High-Tech Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has temporarily blocked
a Japanese company from buying a New Jersey manufacturer involved
in nuclear weapons production, according to a published report.
   The New York Times reported in today's editions that it was the
first time a foreign acquisition has been stopped since enactment
of legislation in August that empowered the president to halt
investments that endanger national security.
   The Times said the Tokuyama Soda Company of Tokyo, a major
producer of chlorine and caustic soda, had sought to buy General
Ceramics of Haskell, N.J., a $30 million-a-year manufacturer of
high-tech ceramics, for $59 million.
   But the U.S. Energy Department objected because of classified
work that General Ceramics is doing for the department's Y-12 plant
in Oak Ridge, Tenn., which makes parts for the nuclear weapons
program, The Times said.
   Among General Ceramics' products are beryllium ceramics, which
are used in electronic circuits that are components of the nuclear
weapons thought to be made at the plant, the newspaper said.
   The new law under which the Bush administration stopped the
acquisition established a public procedure for review and gives the
administration the power to go to court to block such deals.
   The review of the General Ceramics deal was conducted by the
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is
composed of representatives below Cabinet level of the Treasury,
State, Commerce, Defense, Justice and Energy Departments and the
office of the U.S. trade representative.
   The Times reported that General Ceramics is holding discussions
with the government and with Tokuyama to resolve the issues raised
by the Bush administration.
   In a press release, General Ceramics said Tokuyama Soda
``expects to proceed with the proposed transaction if and when
arrangements satisfactory to the government have been worked out.''

<HEAD>Control Data To Drop Supercomputer Business, Cut 3,100 Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Control Data Corp. is hoping the
abandonment of its supercomputer subsidiary, a technical success
that turned into a financial fiasco, sets the stage for sustained
growth after several years of problems.
   But observers say the trouble created by the company's ETA
Systems will take some time to ease.
   ``Putting the cork on it ends the cash drain, but it will take
cash to clean up and get out of it. The company doesn't have much
in the way of cash. There's a real problem there,'' said Martin
Knoblowitz, a vice president at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. in New
York, which said Monday's announcement could mean a downgrade in
Control Data's credit rating.
   About 3,100 jobs will be cut in the restructuring unveiled
Monday, and the company expects restructuring charges of $490
million. More than half of the 3,100 job lost will come in
Minnesota, Chairman Robert Price said.
   Most of the restructuring costs will be taken in the second
quarter, Price said. The changes should result in a profitable
second half of 1989 and set up sustained growth, he said.
   Nonetheless, he called the decision to dump ETA six years after
it was formed ``very, very hard and very painful.''
   ``While ETA was a technological success, it was a very large
drain on the company,'' Price said. ``It's the highest-risk part of
a very high-risk industry.''
   Supercomputers are designed to handle large quantities of data
and operate at extremely high speeds. Among their uses are nuclear
weapons design, weather forecasting and oil exploration.
   ETA, which employed 800 people, lost $100 million in 1988 and
never made money for the company. Since its founding, ETA sold 34
machines ranging in price from $1 million to $20 million, Price
said.
   Price said the company explored the idea of selling ETA or
operating it in a joint venture. But he said the market did not
support those options partly because a buyer or partner ``would be
taking on a considerable burden.''
   He said the company could not obtain financing on its own to
continue ETA, which he said had no market momentum.
   The shutdown of ETA will cost about $350 million, said John
Buckner, Control Data's chief financial officer. The other charges
against earnings will stem from a streamlining of the company's
Cyber mainframe computer business, where staff cuts will be made.
   Price said Control Data will only recover a ``modest'' sum from
the sale of ETA assets and its licensed technology. Japan and other
countries will be considered as potential markets for the
technology, but there may be resistance from the U.S. government on
a foreign sale, said Frank Ryan, a Control Data spokesman.
   The company will now concentrate on mainframe computers, data
storage, technical services and information services, such as its
Arbitron Ratings Co., Price said.
   Control Data stock fell 87 cents a share to $21.50 Monday on the
New York York Stock Exchange while the stock of crosstown rival
Cray Research Inc. closed up $1 at $54.87{. Cray dominates the
industry but is being challenged by Japanese makers.
   ``I'd be smiling if I were Cray Research right now,'' said Roger
Redmond, an analyst for Minneapolis-based Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood
Inc.
   Redmond said the actions taken by Control Data were necessary,
but he said he was surprised by the high estimated cost of the
restructuring. He said Monday's announcement ends rumors that
Control Data will sell its mainframe business.
   Buckner said Control Data is in the process of negotiating a new
lending agreement with its banks. The company received a waiver on
its current pact because it could not meet requirements of
maintaining profitability and a net worth of $950 million, Buckner
said.
   Meantime, the banks have agreed to give the company $30 million
in credit and allow $105 million in existing letters of credit that
already have been tapped to stand.
   The last good year financially at Control Data was 1983, when
the company posted a profit of $161.7 million. It earned $1.7
million last year and $19.3 million in 1987 and lost a total of
$832 million in 1986 and 1985. It also has lost money in its last
two quarters, including a $12.8 million loss in the fourth quarter
of 1988.

<HEAD>Kodak Introduces Two Throwaway Cameras, New Film</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH PICHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. introduced two new
disposable 35mm cameras today, one that can be used underwater and
another that has a special wide-angle lens to better capture scenic
views and city skylines.
   The company also showed off three new 35mm films and said it is
in the process of changing the packaging on its 200-speed Kodacolor
Gold film to include the words ``multi-purpose.''
   The packaging change was not related to the April 5 introduction
of OneFilm by Polaroid Corp., said Wilbur Prezzano, Kodak's general
manager of photographic products.
   OneFilm, Polaroid's line of 200-speed conventional film, is
touted by the company as the ideal all-purpose film for people who
are confused or tired of trying to figure out what film to buy.
   ``If this were an average day, there would be 100 million
pictures taken around the world, color negative pictures, taken
across a wide spectrum of lighting conditions, by different types
of people, different knowledges,'' Prezzano said Monday. ``To think
that those 100 million pictures would be best served by one product
... is incorrect.''
   He said the packaging change and the new products are part of a
continuing effort by Kodak to divide the overall photographic
market by selling products designed for specific uses or for
specific groups.
   ``I think that's part of a general trend in worldwide
manufacturing,'' said Eugene Glazer, a stock analyst for Dean
Witter Reynolds in New York. ``The days of coming up with new
products that are as homogenous as possible seem to be coming to an
end. Certainly, we are seeing that in photography.''
   Even Polaroid, which seemingly bucked the niche trend with its
one-size-fits-all new film, believes it's participating in
pigeonholing the world's amateur photographers.
   ``We see OneFilm as a niche product too. It just happens to be
the largest and most underdeveloped niche,'' said Alan Verch, a
spokesman for the Cambridge, Mass.-based company.
   Kodak's new cameras, while only having limited uses, are
nonetheless quite novel.
   The ``Stretch'' camera, which has a list price of $12.95,
produces unusual long and narrow prints, 3{ by 10 inches, with a
wide-angle 25mm lens. It can capture about one-third more area than
standard ``point-and-shoot'' 35mm cameras.
   It's for use outdoors only and comes loaded with a 12-exposure
roll of 200-speed Kodacolor Gold film.
   The ``Stretch'' camera will be available in Europe this summer.
A similar model also will be sold in Japan. The ``Stretch'' will be
available in the United States later this year.
   Kodak's other new camera, the ``Weekend 35,'' can take
photographs up to 12 feet underwater and comes loaded with a roll
of 24-exposure Kodacolor Gold 400-speed film.
   It's retail price is $13.95. Kodak will begin selling it in U.S.
coastal areas in late June.
   Disposable cameras have been sold in Japan for several years,
where they are a fast-growing product. Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd. of
Japan and Kodak introduced disposable models in this country in
1987. The models are aimed at tourists who neglect to bring their
cameras along on vacation. Kodak's new cameras are designed to
broaden the appeal of disposable models.
   Glazer said that these and other ``niche'' cameras _ Kodak also
has cameras designed for children and for teen-agers _ are going to
play a key role in the photographic industry in coming years.
   ``Each one, taken separately, is relatively unimportant, but in
combination, in total, I think they'll be extremely important.''
   But Michael Ellman, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., said
he's not convinced that niche cameras are the wave of the future
because most people use one or two cameras; they don't want to rely
on all different kinds.
   The three new 35mm films Kodak introduced are:
   _A 125-speed Ektar film. Ektar is Kodak's premium film designed
for the advanced amateur photographer. Previously, it was only
available in 25-speed and 1000-speed.
   _A 1600-speed Kodacolor Gold film. This brings a very high speed
to Kodak's all-purpose color negative film.
   _An improved Kodacolor Gold 400-speed film with finer grain and
more accurate color.

<HEAD>Minorco Loses Another Round in Takeover Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Africa-linked Minorco S.A., the free
world's largest gold concern, has lost another round in its bid to
acquire the No. 2 gold producer Consolidated Gold Fields PLC.
   A federal judge in Manhattan on Monday refused to modify an
order barring Minorco from acquiring more Gold Fields stock.
   The decision by U.S. District Judge Michael B. Mukasey continues
a preliminary injunction he issued last October.
   Gold Fields has significant gold mining holdings in South
Africa, Australia and the United States, including 90 percent of
Newmont Gold, the largest gold producer in the country.
   Last fall, Minorco, a Luxembourg corporation largely controlled
by two South African concerns, Anglo American Corp. of South Africa
and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., launched a $4.9 billion
hostile takeover bid _ since upped to $6 billion _ for Consolidated
Gold Fields.
   But Gold Fields, a British concern, resisted and filed an
antitrust action in New York, claiming that a takeover could result
in Minorco's ``dominating the strategically important world gold
market.''
   ``This court enjoined the takeover because the resulting
combination would control 32.3 percent of the non-communist world
gold market,'' Mukasey said in a 45-page opinion issued Monday.
   Minorco, through its various holdings, is the largest gold
producer in the West, accounting for 20.3 percent of all
production. Gold Fields, with about a 12 percent share, is the
second-largest, according to court papers.
   Mukasey's injunction also prevents Minorco from selling its Gold
Fields holdings to other entities within the South African
conglomerate without court approval.
   Minorco sought to modify the injunction, allowing it to complete
its acquisition of Gold Fields while promising to sell off certain
U.S., Australian and South African assets within a year to resolve
antitrust allegations made by Gold Fields.
   But Mukasey rejected that bid saying there was no guarantee that
Anglo and DeBeers wouldn't eventually repurchase the divested
concerns because South African laws enable companies there ``to
conceal the source of their overseas investments in order to avoid
the effects of anti-apartheid laws.''
   Last month, a federal appeals court upheld Mukasey's preliminary
injunction on antitrust grounds and ordered him to consider whether
the takeover bid violates U.S. securities laws.
   In Monday's ruling, however, Mukasey rejected Gold Fields'
claims that Minorco had failed to fully disclose its South African
interests in violation of U.S. securities laws.
   Gold Fields sought to widen the scope of the injunction by
claiming Minorco violated the anti-fraud provisions of U.S.
securities laws, for allegedly ``making and false and misleading
statements'' about how much control South African corporations and
individuals have over it.
   Gold Fields claimed the Oppenheimer family of South Africa
indirectly controls Minorco, Anglo American and DeBeers and that
the stigma of South Africa's apartheid racial policy could make it
difficult to conduct business in some countries.
   But Mukasey found those claims were only part of a delaying
tactic to push Minorco's offer past its April 26 deadline, which
under British law would bar it from renewing its bid for more than
a year.

   Northwest Airlines' parent company may begin
negotiating with suitors but may also consider restructuring moves
including the acquisition of another company or liquidation of the
airline, its board has decided.
   ``All interested parties will be given a fair chance to
demonstrate their ability to consummate a transaction,'' NWA Inc.
said in a statement Monday announcing that its board of directors
had given permission to management to negotiate with interested
buyers, including billionaire oilman Marvin Davis.
   ``Non-public information would be provided to qualified third
parties who execute an acceptable confidentiality agreement,'' NWA
said.
   But NWA repeated its contention that Davis' $2.7 billion,
$90-a-share bid is inadequate, and said it would give strong
preference to ``all-cash, fully financed bids.''
   Meanwhile, Davis announced in a statement released early today
how he would finance his bid for the nation's fourth-largest
airline.
   The financing package totals approximately $3.3 billion and
would be used for the acquisition of NWA and to refinance, as
necessary, NWA's existing senior debt, according to the statement.
   Citicorp North America Inc. and Citibank, N.A., would provide
$2.4 billion of senior debt, of which Citibank has committed to
lend $500 million and would syndicate the balance with a group of
other major banks, the statement said.
   Also, Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. would raise
$600 million of subordinated debt.
   Approximately $300 million for the acquisition would be
contributed in the form of equity by a Davis family investment
partnership.
   In addition, Citibank would provide a $250 million back-up
revolving line of credit to be available to supplement NWA's
working capital, the statement said.
   ``We believe this is a very strong financing package,'' Davis
said. ``With this financing package, no sales of any strategic
assets will be required to meet the company's financial obligations.
   ``In fact, we would expect _ and could comfortably finance _ the
expansion of NWA's passenger capacity by over 30 percent over the
next six years.''
   State officials have fought Davis' takeover effort because they
fear that Davis would have to sell part of NWA to finance the deal.
   Northwest and state officials could not be reached immediately
to comment on Davis' financing package.
   NWA's statement, stressing that no decisions have been made,
also noted possible restructuring moves including the acquisition
of another company, a partial or complete liquidation of the
airline, a repurchase of shares, a special dividend to
shareholders, or a sale of equity to third parties.
   Analysts said the board's announcement accomplishes several
things.
   Dick Warden, an analyst with IDS Financial Services Inc., said
it could flush out other potential bidders.
   ``Maybe they're saying, `Is there anyone out there who's
serious? If not, let's get back to the business of running an
airline,' '' Warden said.
   Gov. Rudy Perpich, who has led efforts to stop Davis from buying
NWA, said the announcement indicated Northwest officials were
``just protecting their flank'' against stockholder discontent.
   Perpich, who met with Davis during the weekend in San Francisco,
said he's convinced that Davis is determined to continue with his
bid to buy the airline. which has its headquarters in this
Minneapolis suburb.
   ``Davis has been at this for quite some time, over a year, and
it isn't just a lark for him,'' Perpich said. ``He's real and
determined.''
   The governor said he would ask legislative leaders today for
quick action on a legislative package unveiled Friday that aims to
protect workers, consumers and the state if Northwest is taken over.
   Two other investment groups also have been identified as
possible suitors for the airline but have not publicly stated their
intentions.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in the regular weekly auction to the lowest level
in two months.
   On Monday, the Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 8.57 percent, down
from 8.71 percent last week.
   Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average
discount rate of 8.59 percent, down from 8.78 percent last week.
   The rates were the lowest since Feb. 21, when three-month bills
sold for 8.51 percent and six-month bills averaged 8.50 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.88 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,783.40 and and 9.11 percent for six-month bills selling for
$9,565.70.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, rose to 9.48
percent last week after averaging 9.47 percent the week before.

   Housing construction, suffering under the
impact of rising mortgage rates, fell 5.4 percent in March as work
on single-family homes slowed to the weakest pace in more than four
years, the government said today.
   The housing report by the Commerce Department was likely to
intensify fears that the economy is in danger of toppling into a
new recession. Housing, because it is so sensitive to rising
interest rates, is often a harbinger of troubles in other sectors
of the economy.
   The report said applications for building permits, a good
indicator of future activity, plunged by 13.7 percent in March, the
biggest monthly drop since a 14 percent decline in October 1981, in
the early stages of the last recession.
   The 5.4 percent decline in construction of new homes and
apartments was the second monthly decrease, following a 12 percent
drop in February. It left construction work at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.4 million units last month as work on
both single-family homes and apartment buildings weakened.
   Construction of single-family homes dropped below the 1 million
mark to an annual rate of 994,000 units, the slowest pace since
January 1985.
   Starts of multi-family units fell 8.8 percent to an annual rate
of 403,000 units.
   Econommists have blamed rising mortgage rates for the housing
slowdown. Fixed-rate mortgages are now averaging 11.11 percent, up
by almost one full percentaage point from a year ago, according to
a national survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   The Federal Reserve over the past year has been pushing interest
rates higher in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures. But
President Bush and various members of Congress have expressed fears
that the Fed may be in danger of overdoing the credit-tightening. A
growing number of economists have started to predict that a new
recession is likely to begin by late this year or early in 1990.
   The weakness in March was led by a steep 34.1 percent drop in
construction activity in the Northeast, a region which until
recently had been experiencing a building boom triggered by
improving fortunes of high-technology industries in the area.
   But in March, Northeast construction starts fell to an annual
rate of 149,000 units, the slowest building pace in the region
since September 1983.
   Starts of new homes and apartments were off 5.2 percent in the
South, dropping to an annual rate of 546,000 units while starts in
the West dropped by 1 percent to a rate of 395,000 units.
   The Midwest was the only region of the country to enjoy an
increase in activity, with housing construction climbing by 10.4
percent to an annual rate of 307,000 units.
   The 13.7 percent decline in building permits in March followed a
6.1 percent fall in February and left permits at an annual rate of
1.22 million units, the slowest pace since October 1982.

   Stock prices opened sharply higher in brisk
trading today, influenced by government reports on consumer prices
and housing starts.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials surged 21.26 points to
2,359.05 after a half-hour of trading at 10 a.m. EDT.
   Advancing issues outpaced decliners by about 15 to 4 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 810 issues up, 220 down and 448 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 35.26 million shares.
   The Labor Department reported today that the Consumer Price
Index jumped 0.5 percent in March, fueled by higher costs for food
and energy. That followed rises of 0.6 percent in January and 0.4
percent in February and put the annual inflation rate at 6.1
percent, higher than the 4.4 percent increase in 1988.
   Analysts said the March figure was in line with market
expectations and fit in with other economic data in recent weeks
indicating that inflationary pressures may be easing and that the
economy may be growing at a slower pace.
   ``The bond market is acting very well and the stock market is
following suit,'' said John Burnett, senior vice president,
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   Although inflation is still running at a rate many consider too
high for long-run equilibrium, ``the perception is that maybe we're
at or getting near a peak in interest rates,'' Burnett said.
   In a second report the Commerce Department said that housing
starts fell 5.4 percent last month, pressured by rising mortgage
rates.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 1.15 to 170.20.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index jumped
1.08 to 337.30.
   On Monday, the market finished narrowly mixed as investors
awaited the consumer price report. The Dow Jones industrial average
closed 0.73 point higher at 2,337.79.
   Declining issues barely edged out advancers on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 762 issues down, 697 up and 521 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 128.54 million shares, one of the
slowest trading days of the year, down from 169.78 million in
Friday's session.

   Fairchild Industries Inc. has decided to
begin negotiations with the Carlyle Group for a possible purchase
of the company, the aerospace electronics company announced today.
   Carlyle, a Washington-based investment partnership, on April 12
offered $17 per share for all outstanding common shares.
   At a meeting Monday, the Fairchild board appointed a special
committee of outside directors to consider the proposal and other,
unspecified matters. The board acted on the measure, before the
Carlyle offer expired at 6 p.m., Fairchild spokeswoman Deborah
Tucker said today.
   Carlyle originally offered $15.50 per share and boosted its
offer to $16.30. The Fairchild board, however, rejected both offers.
   In a prepared statement on April 12, Carlyle indicated that
discussions had been held with Fairchild's financial advisors.
Carlyle owns about 14.8 percent of Fairchild's stock.
   The proposed purchase price is 72 percent over the closing
market price per share on July 25, the date when Carlyle acquired
its first Fairchild stock.
   Fairchild stock closed Monday on the New York Stock Exchange at
$15.75.
   Security National Bank has agreed to provide $330 million to
finance the deal, according to Carlyle. The outstanding common
stock is worth about $250 million, but costs associated with the
deal would probably push the total cost of the deal up to about
$400 million, according to Stephen Norris, a managing director of
Carlyle.
   In a prepared statement today, Carlyle said is was pleased with
the announcement and planned no further public comment at this time.
   Norris has stated that Carlyle has no intention of breaking up
the company.
   Fairchild's annual meeting is scheduled for April 26.

   President Bush today promised union leaders
``the door will be open'' to them at the White House while skirting
two issues that have caused a souring of labor's relations with the
new administration: the Eastern Airlines strike and the fight over
raising the minimum wage.
   ``We have had honest differences, but we agree on goals,'' the
president told a gathering of about 3,000 officials of building
trades unions. ``You build a better America every single day.''
   While avoiding the Eastern and minimum wage issues, Bush courted
his audience by promising to appoint officials to the National
Labor Relations Board ``whose neutrality and integrity are above
reproach. My appointments will not be anti-labor or, as I say,
anti-business.''
   That comment drew Bush hearty applause from the union officials,
who have accused former President Reagan of appointing anti-labor
representatives to the labor relations board.
   The speech was Bush's first to a labor organization since his
election. Although many union leaders have complained recently
about the administration's positions, Bush promised ``the door will
be open'' even though he is likely to have ``honest differences''
with labor.
   Bush also saluted the American labor movement for supporting
Poland's Solidarity movement, saying, ``When the free trade
movement is threatened, so too is democracy.''
   The president received a polite response from the delegates and
was given a standing ovation when he entered the room and another
as he departed.
   Bush's appearance came 24 hours after Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell told the AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades
Department conference that ``the president is against us'' in the
minimum-wage fight and urged them to press him on the issue.
   ``Maybe you can ask him this question,'' Mitchell told the
delegates. ``How is it that the president can propose a tax cut of
$30,000 a year for the very richest Americans and yet at the same
time say that 30 cents an hour for the poorest Americans is too
much? I say that is wrong and that is unfair.''
   Mitchell, D-Maine, was referring to Bush's proposal to cut
capital gains taxes, and to the 30 cents an hour difference between
Bush's offer to raise the minimum wage to $4.25 by 1992 and the
$4.55 target in legislation passed by both the House and Senate.
   The delegates gave Mitchell rousing applause when he vowed to
pass the Democrats' minimum wage bill and a number of other
Democratic initiatives ``with or without'' Bush's support.
   Perhaps mindful of the recent souring of labor's relations with
the White House, Building and Construction Trades Department
President Robert A. Georgine on Monday told delegates Bush deserved
their courtesy.
   ``Despite our political differences, and there are many ...
(Bush) is an honorable and decent man,'' Georgine said.
   The only major labor union to endorse Bush, the Teamsters, is a
member of the building trades group. Leaders of several of the
participating unions said they expected Bush and Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole, who was to address the gathering after the
president, to receive polite welcomes.
   Still, the president's appearance comes as the initial hope
labor leaders had of improved relations with the White House is
giving way to a growing belief among the union officials that the
new administration offers slim prospects for changing the
anti-union bent of the Reagan years.
   As evidence they cite Bush's refusal to intervene to block the
strike by machinists at Eastern Airlines and his promise to veto
the Democrat-sponsored minimum wage bill.
   In refusing to block the Eastern strike, now in its seventh
week, Bush became the first president to ignore a recommendation of
the National Mediation Board, which urged Bush to delay a strike by
using his power to appoint an emergency mediation board.
   ``We were hoping that the relations would have been a lot closer
but someone obviously has decided differently,'' said Robert
McGlotten, labor's top Washington lobbyist. ``Our door is still
open. We're not interested in confrontation, but the White House
doors are closed. ... It makes things a lot tougher when you're not
talking to anybody.''

   The first fiber-optic cable across the Pacific
Ocean went into service today, tying the United States and Japan
together more tightly than ever before.
   The cable, no bigger than a garden hose, stretches 8,271 miles
from California, through Hawaii, splitting in the western Pacific
into legs that travel to Guam and Japan.
   Pacific Link vastly increases the capacity for communication
across the Pacific, which is sometimes called the ocean of
America's future.
   Instead of driving a golden spike, the builders of the $700
million cable marked its completion with a video teleconference
between Japan and the boardroom of the New York Stock Exchange.
   ``The distance between the two countries has become shorter,''
Shiro Uramatsu, executive vice president of the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, said from the Japanese end of the hookup.
   ``We now have a new base, a new plateau'' for communications
services, John Berndt, president of International Communications
Services for American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., said in New York.
   The completion of Pacific Link comes just four months after
completion of the first fiber-optic cable across the Atlantic,
TAT-8, which was inaugurated with a video speech by author and
futurist Isaac Asimov.
   Fiber links will now stretch most of the way around the world,
competing with satellites for the business of carrying phone calls,
computer traffic and video conferences. Satellites are still used
for television.
   Unlike traditional copper cables, fiber-optic cables carry
information in pulses of laser light. The single new cable will be
able to carry 40,000 phone calls at a time across the Pacific,
compared with less than 1,000 for the two copper cables already in
service combined.
   AT&amp;T owns 35 percent of the cable. Kokusai Denshin Denwa,
Japan's international phone company, owns 23 percent. There are 30
partners in all, including MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint
Communications Co., as well as phone companies in Australia,
Brunei, Canada, France, West Germany, Hong Kong, South Korea, New
Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan, and Britain.
   Laying fiber across deep oceans required some special
considerations. Surfers had to be moved aside at Hawaii's Makaha
Beach to make room for a dinghy that brought the cable ashore.
Sharks are attracted to the cables, so they had to be sheathed in
steel to a depth of about 8,500 feet. That makes those sections
about the thickness of a man's fist.
   The trans-Atlantic cable has suffered three partial outages in
its brief life, two caused by damage from fishing trawlers on the
French leg and one caused by an electrical short on the British
leg, said AT&amp;T spokesman Rick Wallerstein.
   The Pacific Link leaves the West Coast at Point Arena, about 100
miles north of San Francisco. After its split in the western
Pacific, the southern leg goes to Guam and the northern touches
land in Chikura, Japan.
   Phone traffic between the United States and Japan is growing
about 20 percent a year, Wallerstein said. Worldwide international
phone traffic is growing about 15 percent a year, a figure that
includes the Japan growth, he said.

   Stock prices staged an across-the-board rally in
heavy trading today, influenced by government reports suggesting
inflationary pressures eased slightly during March.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 29.33 points to
2,367.12 at 11 a.m. EDT. An hour earlier, the blue-chip indicator
was 21.26 points higher.
   Advancing issues outpaced decliners by about 3 to 1 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 920 issues up, 311 down and 516 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 73.59 million shares.
   The Labor Department reported today that the Consumer Price
Index jumped 0.5 percent in March, fueled by higher costs for food
and energy. That followed rises of 0.6 percent in January and 0.4
percent in February and put the annual inflation rate at 6.1
percent, higher than the 4.4 percent increase in 1988.
   ``People were expecting the numbers to be worse,'' said Thomas
Walsh, head of equity trading for Nikko Securities International.
``It's not a great number but the street is viewing it as an OK
number and it has stimulated buy interest.''
   Analysts said the March figure was in line with market
expectations and fit in with other economic data in recent weeks
suggesting that inflationary pressures may be subsiding.
   Although inflation is still running at a rate many consider too
high for long-run stability, ``the perception is that maybe we're
at or getting near a peak in interest rates,'' said John Burnett,
senior vice president at the investment firm of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette.
   A second report by the Commerce Department that housing starts
fell 5.4 percent and building permits plunged by 13.7 percent last
month was taken as further evidence that the economy is slowing and
that it will lead to lower inflation, observers said.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 1.56 to 170.61.

   Dow Chemical Co. and Eli Lilly &amp; Co. will
combine their plant science businesses to form an agricultural
company in Indianapolis, the companies said Tuesday.
   The companies hope to begin construction in 1989 on an
Indianapolis marketing and research facility for Dow Elanco Inc.,
Dow Chemical spokeswoman Sarah Opperman said.
   Dow Elanco Inc. would be one of the largest research-based
agricultural companies in the world, with projected sales of about
$1.5 billion in its first year of operation, the companies said.
   About 200 jobs would be moved from Dow Chemical's Dow
Agricultural Products facilities in Midland to Indianapolis over a
three-year period, Opperman said.
   Current employees of Dow Agricultural Products and Eli Lilly's
Elanco Products Co. would be incorporated into the new company,
Opperman said.
   She said the companies haven't projected what additional jobs
might be involved, but the new venture will employ about 2,800
including field personnel.
   The venture would be formed by consolidating Dow Chemical's
plant science business, Dow Agricultural Products, and Dow's
industrial pest control business with Eli Lilly's plant science
business, Elanco Products Co.
   Eli Lilly will retain Elanco's animal health business.
   Opperman said Dow Chemical and Eli Lilly have signed a letter of
understanding and hope to reach an interim agreement this summer on
the cashless transaction that would form the new company.
   Dow will receive 60 percent of the new venture's earnings and
Eli Lilly 40 percent, she said.

<HEAD>Pickens Says No Hostile Intent in Koito Stock Purchase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. corporate takeover specialist T. Boone Pickens
Jr. arrived in Japan Tuesday after denying any hostile intent in
his purchase of the largest block of shares in Koito Manufacturing
Co., a Japanese auto parts maker.
   ``There was nothing hostile about it. We're not trying to take
over Koito,'' Pickens said in an interview broadcast Tuesday by the
Japan Broadcasting Corp.
   Pickens also called the purchase of stock a ``test case'' for
access to the Japanese market by American investors, and said he
was traveling to Japan to explain the move to Koito management.
   As of March 31, Pickens held 32.4 million shares, or 20.2
percent, of Koito stock. Koito is a major supplier of lighting
systems to Toyota Motor Corp., which owns 19.1 percent of its
shares, and to Nissan Motor Corp., which owns 5.95 percent.
   ``We evaluated the situation and felt that Koito was a company
that was one of the best in its business worldwide,'' Pickens said
in the interview, conducted before his departure from the United
States. ``We thought it was a good investment.''
   Pickens warned that public sentiment in the United States would
turn against Japan if it does not allow access for American
investors.
   ``Japanese are making a big mistake when they don't invite
Americans into Japan as America has invited the Japanese in,''
Pickens said. He said his investment was ``a test case to see what
the attitude is toward an American investor in Japan.''
   Many Japanese analysts have looked at Pickens' purchase as a
possible ``greenmail'' attempt. In greenmail, a hostile corporate
suitor makes profits when his stock is purchased at a premium by
another shareholder friendly to the company.
   Hostile takeovers are still relatively rare in Japan.
   Japanese news reports have said the Finance Ministry is
investigating possible irregularities in Pickens' acquisition of
the shares, including incomplete or tardy disclosures to
authorities regarding the purchase.

   Citizens and Southern Corp. Chairman Bennett A.
Brown, addressing shareholders today, painted takeover suitor NCNB
Corp. as an institution more concerned with making a name for
itself than with sound banking practices.
   Brown urged the shareholders to support the C&amp;S board in its
rejection of NCNB's $2.4 billion stock transfer offer.
   ``Let me put it bluntly. NCNB cannot afford C&amp;S,'' Brown said to
loud applause.
   Brown repeatedly referred to NCNB's recent acquisition of a 20
percent stake in First RepublicBank Corp. of Texas, now called NCNB
Texas, saying it was an example of NCNB's risk-taking approach.
That acquisition came after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
picked NCNB to manage the ailing Texas bank.
   ``It (NCNB) is managed with the purpose of making a name for
itself among the world's largest banking institutions,'' Brown
said. ``That's not our mission.''
   Brown said shareholders would benefit more from C&amp;S'
``risk-averse'' approach to banking, which he said provided more
sustained growth.
   ``Neither the initial offer nor the street-rumored offers come
close to reflecting the value of the C&amp;S franchise. The fact is
that C&amp;S is already performing in a manner that produces reliable
long-term value for our shareholders,'' he said.
   He was given a standing ovation when he concluded his address.
   Later, Brown was asked by a shareholder whether he would
consider putting the NCNB proposal to a shareholders' vote. Brown
said he would not.
   ``It is the board of directors' responsibility. Shareholders can
vote to elect or replace the board,'' Brown said.
   Today's annual meeting in Atlanta was the first gathering of C&amp;S
shareholders since North Carolina-based NCNB Inc. made an
unsolicited bid last month to acquire the Atlanta-based banking
company.
   Though matters pertaining directly to the NCNB bid were not on
the agenda, the proposed takeover drew much attention to the
meeting and had been expected to dominate discussion.
   In official business, the shareholders approved a measure that
would authorize the board to consider the effect any acquisition
would have on C&amp;S employees, customers, suppliers, creditors and
communities where the bank does business. The vote count was not
immediately available.
   C&amp;S spokesman Scott Scredon said 16 states now require company
boards of directors to take the broad view in deciding whether to
agree to a takeover, but Georgia law gives companies the option of
whether to go beyond shareholder interest.
   Lynn Easley, spokeswoman for NCNB in Charlotte, N.C., said
Monday the company did not plan to have a representative attend
today's meeting in Atlanta.
   NCNB last month offered to merge with C&amp;S under a stock transfer
at the time valued at $2.4 billion. The C&amp;S board April 3 rejected
the offer, saying it was inadequate and not in the best interest of
the shareholders.
   Despite repeated requests from NCNB Chairman Hugh L. McColl Jr.,
C&amp;S officials have refused to meet with NCNB to discuss the offer
further. McColl has said all aspects of the deal are negotiable,
though he said NCNB will not make a cash offer.
   In a letter Monday to Brown, McColl said NCNB would make a
``substantial price increase'' in the proposal if C&amp;S would agree
to a face-to-face meeting.
   Last week, the two companies engaged in an increasingly heated
exchange of statements, in which C&amp;S said the takeover bid was
senseless and riddled with regulatory hurdles, and NCNB accused C&amp;S
of waging a disinformation campaign.
   McColl, in a visit to Atlanta last week, said C&amp;S shareholders
should decide whether to accept the offer. He did not specify how
he intended to get the issue to a shareholder vote.

   Grain and soybean futures prices fell slightly
this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade following overnight
showers in the Midwest and a National Weather Service forecast for
more rain early next week.
   Corn and soybean prices had risen sharply Monday on dry-weather
fears fueled by private forecasters' long-range predictions for
little rain and rising temperatures in the Corn Belt.
   But scattered showers in the region last night and this morning
dampened the bullish enthusiasm, as did the National Weather
Service's latest 6-to-10-day outlook, which was issued after
Monday's close.
   Nevertheless, analysts said the National Weather Service's track
record so far this spring has been spotty.
   ``Their 6-to-10-day forecasts have been consistently wrong,''
said analyst Susan Leighty of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in
Chicago.
   In early trading, wheat was } cents to 2{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.09 a bushel; corn was 2 cents to
3\ cents lower with May at $2.74} a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1{
cents lower with May at $1.97} a bushel; soybeans were 2} cents to
5 cents lower with May at $7.44{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were higher while pork futures were mixed in

<HEAD>SEC Investigating Georgia Power Tax Accounting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tax accounting practices at Georgia Power Co.,
already under investigation by a federal grand jury, are being
reviewed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The federal agency began its own investigation last month,
according to papers filed with the SEC. The probe includes Georgia
Power and its parent firm, the Southern Co.
   The U.S. Justice Department last year began investigating
alleged tax fraud at the utility after a Georgia Power accountant
provided the Internal Revenue Service with information regarding
possible violations of federal law in the method by which spare
parts were accounted for in financial documents. A grand jury in
Atlanta currently is hearing testimony in that investigation.
   An attorney for the Southern Co. said the SEC activity was a
``natural outgrowth'' of the Justice Department probe.
   The SEC is looking at how the utility holding company handled
the disclosure of financial and tax accounting in proxy statements,
reports, documents and other securities materials submitted to the
SEC and investors, according to Southern.
   Ronald L. Crawford, assistant regional commissioner for the SEC
in Atlanta, said agency policy prohibited comment on investigations.
   Southern is the parent firm of Georgia Power, Alabama Power,
Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and Savannah Electric.
   Thomas J. Hartland, an attorney representing Southern, said the
company was not surprised by the SEC investigation, though the
federal agency did not formally notify the company.
   ``We would have been surprised had the SEC not undertaken this
kind of fact-finding in administering the Holding Company Act and
securities laws,'' Hartland said.
   The Southern Co. did not mention the SEC investigation in its
recent annual report to stockholders, but a company spokesman said
the report already had been printed when the company learned of the
probe.
   The investigation was noted in the financial statement that
publicly owned companies must file annually with the SEC.

   Stock prices rose in heavy trading today, after
two government reports that suggested inflationary pressures eased
slightly in March.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials had advanced 28.78
points to 2,366.57 at noon EDT. The blue-chip indicator was up
29.33 points an hour earlier.
   Advancing issues outpaced decliners by about 5 to 2 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 938 issues up, 365 down and 529 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 104.96 million shares.
   The Labor Department reported today that consumer prices, as
measured by the Consumer Price Index, jumped 0.5 percent in March,
fueled by higher costs for food and energy. That followed rises of
0.6 percent in January and 0.4 percent in February and put the
annual inflation rate at 6.1 percent, higher than the 4.4 percent
increase in 1988.
   ``People were expecting the numbers to be worse,'' said Thomas
Walsh, head of equity trading for Nikko Securities International.
``It's not a great number but the street is viewing it as an OK
number and it has stimulated buy interest.''
   Analysts said the March figure was in line with market
expectations and fit in with other economic data in recent weeks
suggesting that inflationary pressures may be subsiding.
   Although inflation is still running at a rate many consider too
high for long-run stability, ``the perception is that maybe we're
at or getting near a peak in interest rates,'' said John Burnett,
senior vice president at the investment firm of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette.
   A second report by the Commerce Department that housing starts
fell 5.4 percent and building permits plunged by 13.7 percent last
month was taken as further evidence that the economy is slowing and
that it could lead to lower inflation, observers said.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was

   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index advanced

<HEAD>American, Delta Cut Price On Initial Sale of Reservations Partnership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After three months of trying to sell shares in
their new joint reservations system, American Airlines and Delta
Airlines today announced they were cutting the price by 25 percent
on the first segment of the partnership in a move to help speed
federal approval.
   ``We are serious about bringing other partners into this
partnership,'' said John Hotard, a spokesman for American's SABRE
system. ``So for the first 20 percent, we will sell it at $15
million a percentage point.''
   Delta paid American $650 million in February to join up with
SABRE, the nation's largest reservations system, in a 50-50
partnership. The airlines said then that they each would sell up to
half of their interest.
   At the time, the companies put a $20 million price tag on each
percentage point. In other words, it would have cost $400 million
to buy 20 percent of the partnership _ 10 percent each from
American and Delta.
   That amount would now cost $300 million.
   The as yet unnamed partnership is being reviewed by the Federal
Trade Commission, which is studying whether it restricts trade.
SABRE is the nation's largest airline reservation system with about
38 percent of the market; Delta's DATASII system is one of the
smallest at about 6 percent market share.
   Hotard said the price was reduced to show the airlines are
serious about bringing in other partners.
   ``We have had some serious airlines, both domestic and
international, come and talk to us and look at the deal,'' Hotard
said, but none have agreed to buy into the partnership.
   ``As we said in our original announcement, we want to bring
others into the venture as quickly as possible,'' American Chairman
Robert Crandall said. ``We have formed this partnership in good
faith, and we are serious about building the partnership into a
worldwide computer reservations system.''
   Delta Chairman Ron Allen, in a joint statement with Crandall,
said, ``We are also interested in the participation of non-airline
related firms such as hotel and car rental companies who have shown
an expertise and interest in information management and computer
technology.''

<HEAD>Bush Administration Blocks Japanese Deal To Buy NJ Company</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS dateline to Washington sted New York</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has temporarily
blocked a Japanese company from buying a U.S. manufacturer involved
in nuclear weapons production, the Energy Department said today
   Tokuyama Soda Co. of Tokyo, a major producer of chlorine and
caustic soda, is seeking to buy General Ceramics of Haskell, N.J.,
a $30 million-a-year ceramics manufacturer, for $59 million.
   Douglas Elmets, an Energy Department spokesman, said the General
Ceramics sales was being blocked and, ``We're speaking with them to
resolve the situation.''
   Elmets said he could provide no other details.
   The New York Times reported today that the Energy Department
objected to the deal because of classified work that General
Ceramics is doing for the department's Y-12 plant in Oak Ridge,
Tenn., which makes parts for the U.S. nuclear weapons program.
   The Times said it was the first time a foreign acquisition has
been stopped since enactment of legislation in August that
empowered the president to halt investments that endanger national
security.
   Among General Ceramics' products are beryllium ceramics, which
are used in electronic circuits that are components of the nuclear
weapons thought to be made at the plant, the newspaper said.
   The new law under which the Bush administration stopped the
acquisition established a clear and public procedure for review and
gives the administration the power to go to court to block such
deals.
   The review of the deal was conducted by the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the United States, which is comprised of
representatives of the treasury, state, commerce, defense, justice
and energy departments and the Office of the U.S. trade
representative.
   The Times reported that General Ceramics is holding discussions
with the government and with Tokuyama to resolve the issues raised
by the administration.
   General Ceramics said in a statement that Tokuyama Soda
``expects to proceed with the proposed transaction if and when
arrangements satisfactory to the government have been worked out.''

<TEXT>
   GPA Group Ltd., one of the world's biggest
aircraft leasing companies, today announced it has ordered or
placed options on 308 aircraft valued at about $17 billion, the
largest civilian airplane order ever.
   Boeing Co. is the major beneficiary of the orders, GPA said. It
said it will buy 182 Boeing airplanes for $9.4 billion.
   GPA said it will buy 92 of the Seattle-based manufacturer's 737
narrow-bodied, twin-jet planes, 50 Boeing 757 narrow-bodied
twin-jet models, and 40 Boeing 767 twin-engine wide-bodied jets.
   In addition, GPA said it will purchase for $3.1 billion 64
McDonnell Douglas Corp. MD-80 narrow-body twin-jets and 8 McDonnell
Douglas MD-11 wide-body, three-engine jets, it said.
   The company announced earlier today in Paris that it also was
ordering $4.3 billion worth of airplanes from Airbus Industrie, the
European consortium. It will buy 30 of Airbus Industries' A320s; 10
A330s; and two A340s. It said it also has placed options to take a
further 10 A330s and two A340s.
   At a news conference in New York, GPA Chairman and Chief
Executive T.A. Ryan said the company plans to take delivery of 80
to 100 new planes a year over the next six to seven years.
   ``For the first time, it provides massive flexibility for the
airlines and particularly the smaller carriers,'' Ryan said. ``The
airline business is going to increase and the number of passengers
is going to increase very dramatically.''
   He noted the airlines' growing use of operating leases for
aircraft, which average 6{ years for GPA.
   Ryan said the financing for the purchases will be provided by a
group of U.S. and Japanese banks led by Citibank.
   GPA said the engine suppliers include CFMI, a joint venture of
General Electric Co. of the United States and France's Societe
Nationale d'Etudes et Construction de Moteurs Aviation; General
Electric; United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt and Whitney;
Rolls-Royce PLC, and International Aero Engines, jointly owned by
United Technologies, Daimler-Benz AG and Rolls-Royce.
   The announcement had been expected. The company said last week
that it planned to disclose big orders today.
   The previous largest order was Delta Air Lines' $10.5 billion
worth of orders for and options on 225 Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas
airplanes last September.
   GPA's order reflects the importance of aircraft leasing
companies, which account for about one-fifth of all aircraft
orders. It also underscores the growth of the airline industry plus
airlines' concern with replacing their aging fleets.
   Leasing companies provide airplanes to airlines which
increasingly do not want, or do not have the money, to buy the
airplanes themselves.
   Some airlines have complained that the leasing companies' role
in the industry has boosted airplane prices and is lenthening the
long waiting lists for aircraft.
   GPA, based in Shannon, Ireland and formerly called Guinness Peat
Aviation, is privately owned by several companies, including the
airlines Air Canada and Aer Lingus. The carriers hold stakes of 16
percent and 11 percent, respectively.
   GPA currently owns or leases 172 aircraft operated by 64
carriers in 32 countries.
   Its net profits for 1988-1989 were expected to total $150
million compared with $101 million in the previous fiscal year.

   The Senate today rejected the first effort to
amend savings and loan bailout legislation, signaling an uphill
fight for senators trying to change the plan negotiated behind
closed doors by members of its banking committee.
   Senators voted 66-32 to block an amendment, offered by freshman
Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., which would weaken the administration's
control over a new Resolution Trust Corp. for disposing of an
estimated $400 billion of real estate expected to fall into the
government's hands because of S&amp;L failures.
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., not a member of the committee,
pleaded with colleagues to vote on the amendment based on its
merits.
   ``The banking committee is not the fountain of all wisdom. To
suggest that the document is sacred and every word is infallible
... well, we just may as well go home now,'' he said.
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., one of the banking panel's senior
members, told senators they could be accommodated when the bill
reaches a House-Senate conference, but for now he said, ``It's a
better bill than the House bill and I think we ought to leave it
alone.''
   Revenues from the sale of the real estate are to be used to
reduce the taxpayers' costs from the bailout, expected to total
some $200 billion over the next 30 years.
   President Bush wanted the new agency to be run under a
three-member board made up of Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady,
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan.
   The Senate Banking Committee expanded the board to include two
businessmen to be appointed by Bush. Kerrey wanted to expand the
board to seven members and give its chairman the power to name his
colleages while weakening the status of Brady, Thornburgh and
Greenspan by making them ex-officio members.
   Because the board will have control over the greatest
concentration of land, buildings and real estate ever amassed in
the nation's history, the potential for scandal is unprecedented,
Kerrey said.
   However, the banking committee's chairman, Sen. Donald W. Riegle
Jr., D-Mich., and ranking Republican, Sen. Jake Garn of Utah,
opposed Kerrey's amendment, saying it would put too much control in
private interests.
   ``It goes further than we ought to go at this time,'' Riegle
said.
   Leaders want the bill passed by Wednesday and Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has threatened to call senators
back to work Friday, in the middle of the Passover recess, if they
miss the deadline.
   ``The bill is a carefully crafted compromise,'' Garn said.
``Extraneous and controversial amendments could upset that balance
and lead us into bickering and delays we simply cannot afford.''
   In most respects, the legislation tracks the proposal presented
in February by Bush, pledging $157 billion to the problem over the
next 10 years and providing a smorgasbord of reforms, chief among
them a requirement that S&amp;L owners back their lending with more of
their own capital.
   Most changes in the president's plan were crafted by the
committee behind closed doors, then ratified in a public session
last Thursday. And despite the plea for fast action, several
senators, both on and off the committee, are seeking another crack
at further amending the plan.
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., a committee member, said he would offer
an amendment scrapping the administration's proposal for keeping
$50 billion of the spending out of the budget deficit.
   Graham maintains that including the spending in the budget will
reduce the government's cost of borrowing the money.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, is examining a variety of
amendments, including measures requiring institutions to cash
government checks, offer low cost checking accounts to poor people,
and disclose their record of lending to poor and minority
neighborhoods. He is also considering a measure repealing special
tax benefits designed to encourage purchase of failed S&amp;Ls.
   Other senators who may offer changes include:
   _Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., who would give small, solvent S&amp;Ls
more time than other S&amp;Ls to meet capital requirements.
   _Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., who would force large banks to pay
insurance premiums on deposits from foreigners. Even though those
deposits are not technically insured, they are usually protected
because regulators have a policy of keeping big banks afloat rather
than closing them.
   Meanwhile, three consumer groups _ the Consumer Federation of
America, Consumers Union and the Association of Community
Organizations for Reform Now _ castigated both the House and Senate
versions as providing loopholes in what appear to be tough capital
requirements.
   The groups particularly criticized the Senate bill for allowing
S&amp;Ls 25 years to remove goodwill from their books. Goodwill, which
is not permitted to banks, represents the value assigned by
accountants of an institution's value as a going concern. It
disappears when an institution fails and is liquidated.
   ``Unfortunately, the talk on Capitol Hill is much tougher than
the bills that are rapidly moving through the House and Senate,''
said Michelle Meier, an attorney with Consumers Union.

   Stock prices closed strongly higher Tuesday as the
release of favorable U.S. economic statistics helped to ease the
market's fears about inflation.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 19.7 points, or 0.9 percent, at 2,074.4. The index rose as
much as 23.3 points at mid-afternoon. At its lowest, the index was
up 0.7 point at the opening.
   Volume was moderate, with 530.8 million shares changing hands,
up from Monday's light 469.4 million shares.
   Shares moved up tentatively through the morning but then took
off following news that U.S. consumer prices for March rose 0.5
percent, slightly better than market expectations, and that U.S.
housing starts unexpectedly dropped 5.4 percent for the month.
   The reports were doubly effective at reassuring the market,
coming after Friday's spate of favorable economic news that also
sent the market higher.
   The latest economic figures, signaling a slowing of the U.S.
economy and a consequent reduction in inflationary pressures, also
gave a sharp boost to prices on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones
industrial average was up nearly 30 points at the time of the
London close.
   The numbers ``gave the market some short-term satisfaction.
People's perceptions of interest rates and inflation have moved
into the background,'' one trader said.

   Two Wall Street investment firms Tuesday
reported sharp drops in quarterly earnings, with profits down 18
percent at Morgan Stanley Group Inc. and 22 percent at Bear Stearns
Cos.
   Morgan Stanley reported net income of $81.1 million, or $2.02
per share, for the quarter ended March 31, compared with $98.6
million, or $2.55 a share, in the same 1988 quarter.
   The firm reported revenue of $1.24 billion, a 5 percent rise
from $975 million in the first quarter of last year, primarily due
to a 48 percent increase in interest and dividend revenue.
   Bear Stearns reported quarterly earnings of $41.1 million, or 47
cents a share, compared with $52.4 million, or 59 cents a share
last year. The drop came despite a 26 percent rise in revenue to
$624 million from $494 million in the same 1988 period.
   The earnings declines come during a weak business environment on
Wall Street.
   Morgan Stanley reported a heavy drop in revenue from trading,
down to $196 million from $239 million, and investments, which
plunged to $572,000 from $4.7 million.
   Morgan Stanley executives said in a statement that ``difficult
conditions'' in debt markets were offset by high financial advisory
revenues; international equities sales and trading; and foreign
exchange and commodities business.
   The firm reported total capital of $2.5 billion.
   Bear Stearns, the holding company for the investment banking and
brokerage firm Bear Stearns &amp; Co., did not break down its earnings
statement. It reported total capital of $1.4 billion.

   Newspaper and publishing magnate Robert Maxwell is
trying to buy a controlling interest in the English-language
Jerusalem Post Daily, his office said Tuesday.
   ``We can confirm that a report we have seen from Jerusalem is
correct but we are not making a statement about it,'' said Judy
Welsh, a press officer for Maxwell, chairman of Mirror Group
Newspapers Ltd.
   London's Financial Times business daily said Maxwell appeared
likely to secure 55 percent of the Jerusalem Post in a joint bid
with Charles Bronfman, head of the Claridge investment group based
in Montreal, Canada.
   The report quoted Maxwell as saying if the joint bid was
successful he would be the managing partner.
   The Financial Times said the 55 percent stake was marketed by
Koor Industries, which it described as Israel's largest industrial
group.
   The Jerusalem Post also publishes a weekly international edition
that claims to have 170,000 subscribers worldwide.
   Maxwell last year bought a stake in the publishers of the Tel
Aviv-based Hebrew newspaper, Ma'ariv.

   In addition, the committee authorized advisers to hold
discussions with ``any other interested parties and continue to
explore other approaches designed to maximize stockholder values,''
the company said in a statement.
   Fairchild has rejected offers by Carlyle of $15.50 and $16.30
per share. The latest offer expired Monday. Carlyle owns about 14.8
percent of Fairchild's stock.
   The proposed purchase price is 72 percent over the closing
market price per share on July 25, when Carlyle first acquired
Fairchild stock.
   The outstanding common stock is worth about $250 million, but
costs associated with the deal would probably push the total cost
of the deal up to about $400 million, said Stephen Norris, a
Carlyle managing director.
   Carlyle said in a statement Tuesday it was pleased with the
announcement to hold talks about the deal but did not elaborate.
   Fairchild's annual meeting is set for April 26.
   Carlyle, founded two years ago, has pursued a series of friendly
takeovers and last year acquired Oakite Products Inc., a New Jersey
chemical company, in partnership with the French bank Paribas.
   Carlyle also made an unsolicited offer for Chi Chi's Inc., a
Louisville, Ky., restaurant chain. Chi Chi's was acquired by
another company and Carlyle profited on its investment.

   Stock prices were sharply higher in active
trading today, after the government reported a drop in housing
starts and a smaller-than-expected rise in consumer prices last
month.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 40.14 at 3 p.m.
EDT. The blue-chip indicator had gained 37.39 points by 2 p.m.
   Advancing issues outpaced decliners by about 7 to 3 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 1,020 issues up, 435 down and 495
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 178.27 million shares.
   The Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell 5.4
percent in March and applications for building permits plunged by
13.7 percent. Although the report raised recession fears in some
sectors, stock analysts said the market interpreted the numbers as
good news for the economy, because it suggested an easing of
inflationary pressures.
   The Labor Department also reported today that consumer prices
jumped 0.5 percent in March after rises of 0.6 percent in January
and 0.4 percent in February. Although that put the annual inflation
rate at 6.1 percent, higher than the 4.4 percent increase in 1988,
the market had braced itself for something worse.
   ``It's not a great number but the street is viewing it as an OK
number and it has stimulated buy interest,''said Thomas Walsh, head
of equity trading for Nikko Securities International.
   Analysts said the March figure fit in with other recent economic
data suggesting that the economy is slowing.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 2.03 to 171.08.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had
gained 2.44 to 338.66.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Northwest Airlines was
up 7 points to 97\ after its parent company announced Monday that
it might sell the nation's fourth-largest airline, amid takeover
threats from billionaire oilman Marvin Davis.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Retreat On Rain Forecast, Yeutter Comments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade on a forecast for rain
in the Corn Belt and signs that the United States is becoming
stingier with its wheat exports.
   The National Weather Service, in a forecast issued late Monday,
predicted average to above-average rainfall in the Midwest early
next week, an outlook that prompted modest selling of corn and
soybean futures.
   Many private meteorologists continued to predict dry weather,
though, which limited the declines.
   Wheat futures prices dipped after an Agriculture Department
official said the agency had suspended its grain export subsidy
program, which has been a major channel for large wheat sales to
the Soviet Union and China.
   But Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter later said the
announcement was in error and that the USDA had made no decision to
suspend the program, despite relatively low stock levels of wheat
and dry-weather damage to the ripening winter wheat crop.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents to 3\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.07 a bushel; corn was 1{ cents
to 2\ cents lower with May at $2.75\ a bushel; oats were { cent to
2 cents lower with May at $1.98{ a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents
lower to 1{ cents higher with May at $7.48 a bushel.

<HEAD>Citizens and Southern Affirms Rejection of NCNB Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citizens and Southern Corp. on Tuesday reaffirmed
its rejection of a $2.4 billion hostile takeover bid by NCNB Corp.,
saying both companies should ``get back to the business of
banking.''
   C&amp;S's board of directors voted unanimously against the offer
shortly after Chairman Bennett A. Brown told shareholders that
NCNB, a Charolotte, N.C.-based banking company, was interested only
in gambling on risky expansions.
   ``We will continue to fight all the way,'' he said. ``We have
better staying power.''
   In a statement issued later, Brown said the board sent a letter
to NCNB's board explaining the rejection and ``suggesting that both
of these institutions get back to the business of banking and avoid
further distraction and expense.''
   Brown urged shareholders to support the C&amp;S board in its April 3
rejection of NCNB's stock transfer offer made last month, saying
NCNB stock might be overvalued. The board Tuesday simply reaffirmed
its earlier vote.
   ``Let me put it bluntly. NCNB cannot afford C&amp;S,'' Brown said to
loud applause.
   ``Let's get beyond all the recent speculation on Wall Street and
in the press and face reality,'' he said. ``The NCNB offer makes no
sense. It would be bad for C&amp;S, bad for our shareholders, and bad
for our employees, customers and the communities we serve.''
   Despite repeated requests from NCNB Chairman Hugh L. McColl Jr.,
C&amp;S has refused to discuss the offer further. McColl has said all
aspects of the deal are negotiable, but that NCNB will not make a
cash offer.
   In a letter Monday to Brown, McColl said NCNB would make a
``substantial price increase'' in the proposal if C&amp;S agrees to a
face-to-face meeting.
   Brown said NCNB's recent acquisition of a 20 percent stake in
First RepublicBank Corp. of Texas, now called NCNB Texas, was an
example of NCNB's high risk-taking approach. That acquisition came
after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. picked NCNB to manage the
ailing Texas bank.
   ``NCNB has no financial flexibility,'' Brown said. ``Its
management has invited us to gamble on both Texas and taxes. I will
tell you it is of very questionable value at best.''
   The North Carolina bank, he said, cannot put up cash for the
acquisition, ``so they have no way of protecting the value that our
shareholders would expect in a stock transaction.''
   NCNB spokeswoman Ginny Mackin said the company had no immediate
comment Tuesday's developments. NCNB said it did not have a
representative at the meeting.
   When asked by a shareholder, Brown said he would not consider
putting the NCNB proposal to a shareholders' vote. ``It is the
board of directors' responsibility. Shareholders can vote to elect
or replace the board,'' Brown said.
   Also Tuesday, C&amp;S employees bought a full-page ad in The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution addressed to shareholders. It said the
employees stand with management against the NCNB offer.

<HEAD>Five Big Banks Report Profit Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Five of the nation's largest bank holding companies _ Citicorp,
Bankers Trust Corp., Wells Fargo &amp; Co., Continental Bank Corp. and
Mellon Bank Corp. _ reported an increase Tuesday in their
first-quarter profit over a year ago.
   Meanwhile, Beverly Hills, Calif.-based Great Western Financial
Corp., one of the biggest U.S. thrift companies, had flat earnings.
Its net income totaled $57.2 million, or 45 cents a share, vs.
$56.1 million and 45 cents in 1988.
   Citicorp, the nation's largest banking concern, based in New
York, said net income for the three months ended March 31 soared 48
percent to $529 million, or $1.52 a share, from $358 million, or
$1.01 a share, in 1988. The latest quarter included a $77 million
gain from the sale of a building in Tokyo.
   Bankers Trust, based in New York, said it netted $164.3 million,
or $2.02 a share, up 30 percent from last year's earnings of $126.0
million, or $1.61 per share.
   Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, had a profit of $141.5
million, or $2.56 per share, an 18 percent rise over net income of
$120.4 million, or $2.15 per share, in 1988.
   Continental Bank, located in Chicago, said it earned $76
million, or $1.23 per share, up 10 percent from $69 million, or
$1.10, in 1988. The 1989 quarter included a $17 million gain from
the sale of real estate while last year's quarter included a $15
million gain from a pension settlement.
   Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank said its profit more than tripled
to $77 million, or $1.67 per share, from $25 million, or 65 cents
per share, in 1988.
   Citicorp said strength in core businesses such as consumer
banking and in its investment banking sector more than offset weak
foreign exchange markets and a rise in expenses.
   Net interest income rose 8 percent to $1.8 billion from $1.7
billion, while overall revenue, including non-interest income,
jumped 14 percent to $3.5 billion from $3.04 billion.
   Total expenses were up 7 percent to $2.6 billion from $2.4
billion. That included a 27 percent increase in its provision for
possible credit losses to $358 million from $283 million.
   Bankers Trust said it's improvement in quarterly income resulted
mainly from increased non-interest revenue, although that was
partially offset by a higher loan-loss provision.
   Non-interest revenue totaled $485.4 million for the first
quarter, up 47 percent over $154.6 million a year ago, while
non-interest expenses was up 23 percent to $437.5 million. Net
interest income remained unchanged at $238 million.
   During the quarter Bankers Trust's loan-loss provision rose to
$35 million from $10 million.
   Wells Fargo said its net interest income totaled $544 million
for the quarter, compared with $478.6 million a year ago.
Non-interest income rose 19 percent to $185.4 million from $156.2
million last year.
   Non-interest expense totaled $386.5 million, up from $371.6
million a year ago. The increase was due primarily to the ongoing
expenses of Barclays Bank of California, which was acquired in the
second quarter.
   The provision for loan losses in the first quarter was $100
million, compared with $75 million in the quarter of 1988.
   Continental Bank said its latest results were the best for a
first quarter, with all its business sectors showing strength. It
said total revenue rose 7 percent to $292 million. Expenses
declined from a year ago, reflecting a corporate restructuring that
included employee cuts.
   The provision for loan losses totaled $19 million, compared to
$10 million a year ago.
   Mellon's quarterly net interest income reached $212 million, up
11 percent, from $190 million in the 1988. Its non-interest income
also rose, to $212 milion from $190 million. Total operating
expenses fell 15 percent to $283 million from $298 million.

<HEAD>United Technologies Earnings Rise 1.2 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Technologies Corp. said Tuesday
its profit rose 1.2 percent from 1988, when one-time factors had
boosted profits.
   The diversified defense contractor said it earned $123.7 million
for the first quarter of 1989 on revenue of $4.46 billion, compared
to net income of $122.2 million on revenue of $4.33 billion for the
same period a year ago.
   Earnings per share for the quarter were 95 cents, compared to 94
cents per share for the same period a year ago.
   First-quarter results from 1988 included a pre-tax gain of
$156.0 million from the sale of Essex Group, a wire and cable maker
based in Fort Wayne, Ind., and certain leasing subsidiaries. That
gain was largely offset by $148.8 million in pre-tax charges from
rebudgeting of major radar contracts at Norden Systems and some
writeoffs and relocations.
   Besides the net gain of $7.2 million, the 1988 quarter included
$13.8 million in pre-tax profit from Essex before its March sale.
   United Technologies' products include Pratt &amp; Whitney aircraft
engines, Carrier heating and air conditioning systems, Otis
elevators and escalators, Sikorsky helicopters, Hamilton Standard
aerospace systems and Norden defense systems.
   Robert F. Daniell, UTC chairman and chief executive officer,
said Otis, Pratt &amp; Whitney and UT Automotive contributed
significantly to first-quarter results.
   Daniell noted that orders for Pratt &amp; Whitney's commercial
engines continued to surge, with the aircraft division recording
$1.6 billion in commercial engine orders alone during the first
quarter.
   For the third year in a row, Pratt &amp; Whitney won the majority of
the U.S. Air Force fighter engine competition, receiving 60 percent
of the 1989 order.

   Turner Broadcasting System and two other

aimed at the Southeast, TBS said Tuesday.
   Atlanta-based TBS said it will join with American Television &amp;

   Terence F. McGuirk, president of Turner Cable Network Sales,
said the companies plan to launch the service by Jan. 1, 1990,
programming six to eight hours of sports daily.
   The ``reasonably priced sports and sports-related programming''
produced by the network will be aimed at cable systems' basic

Carolina and Tennessee, TBS said.
   The company said other partners might join the venture later.

   Trying to overcome skepticism about its rebuilding
plans, strike-crippled Eastern Airlines enrolled more pilot
recruits and Tuesday ran full-page ads featuring pilots who have
crossed the picket lines.
   ``We're building a better, stronger, more unified airline and we
are as proud as ever to wear the Eastern uniform,'' said ads with a
photo of three veteran pilots and a list of nearly 200 other
pilots. They ran in the New York Times, Washington Post and the
Miami Herald and will run again next week, said company spokesman
Robin Matell.
   Matell also said Eastern this week began six-week training
courses for 79 new pilots. Two previous classes of 34 each will
complete training in mid- and late-May, the company said.
   ``Many of them rank with the caliber of pilot flying for Eastern
many years,'' said Frank Causey, Eastern's vice president for
flight operations.
   Pilots union spokesman Ron Cole scoffed at Eastern's claims,
saying they're part of ``a publicity blitz they've got on right
now'' to try to bolster the parent Texas Air's claim that Eastern
won't be sold and is being rebuilt as a smaller, efficient carrier.
   ``This is a misguided attempt to show the bankruptcy court and
the pilots that Mr. Lorenzo's downsizing effort is working. It
hasn't worked before and it isn't working now,'' Cole said.
   Company hopes of overcoming the March 4 Machinists union strike
were undercut when 3,400 of the 3,600 pilots honored Machinists
picket lines. Without the pilots, Eastern has been stuck at just
over 100 flights a day, or 10 percent of its pre-strike schedule.
   The company claims it can rebuild without the unions, but many
industry analysts have expressed doubts that Eastern could come
back generating enough revenues to satisfy creditors. Texas Air
said assets will be sold to raise cash, but the unions continue to
hope for a buyer to rescue Eastern, which is in Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization.
   Cole said company officials have been calling striking pilots at
home in hopes of luring them back to work and sent a videotape to
the pilots' homes. He said retired Eastern pilots, other Eastern
employees who have pilots' licenses and even disabled pilots have
been called. Even one fired pilot was called, Cole claimed.
   Matell said a company pilots communications committee has been
keeping up contacts with pilots. He said the committee has gone
through pilots' lists making calls and may have unknowingly called
disabled pilots. Matell noted that pilots must pass physical
examinations before flying again.
   Causey said the newly recruited pilots have an average 15{ years
of flying experience, with military, corporate or commuter airline
experience common and even some pilots from major carriers.
   The Air Line Pilots Association has said there is an
industrywide shortage of experienced pilots and Cole said Eastern
is offering a misleading appraisal of its recruits.
   Those participating in the ad campaign see it differently.
   ``I was flabbergasted at my fellow pilots, that so many chose to
buy the ALPA line about Frank Lorenzo,'' said Paul Richardson, a
26-year Eastern pilot. ``For me, it was a non-decision. Eastern's
been very good to me, as it has to all pilots.''
   The flying pilots said they've had few problems with strikers,
other than placards shoved in front of their cars and other minor
incidents.

   Stock prices finished sharply higher today after
two economic reports helped ease market fears about inflation.
   The market shot up at the opening kicked off by active program
trading that soon led to a broad-based rally.
   The rally followed a surge in the bond market after news that
housing starts were down dramatically and consumer prices rose less
than expected in March.
   Analysts said the two reports helped ease concerns about rising
inflation and provided further evidence that the economy slowed
last month.
   The Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell 5.4
percent in March while applications for building permits plunged
13.7 percent.
   Consumer prices jumped 0.5 percent last month, slightly below
market expectations of about 0.6 percent, according to a report
from the Labor Department.
   ``The number was not better than epected but within
expectations,'' said Jack Garry, equity analyst with Butcher &amp;
Singer Inc. ``It gave people the impetus to get out there and buy.''
   The March Consumer Price Index pushed the annual inflation rate
to 6.1 percent, higher than the 4.4 percent increase in 1988.
Consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in January and 0.4 percent in
February.
   ``The market is still concerned about inflation but the figures
were encouraging,'' Garry said.
   Analysts said the sharp decline in housing starts, spurred by
rising mortgage rates, also increased the likelihood that the
Federal Reserve would not continue raising interest rates and might
even move to lower rates.
   ``Clearly the economy is slowing and clearly the Fed may have to
ease monetary policy,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at
First Albany Corp.

<HEAD>Crude, Gasoline Prices Push Ahead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crude oil and gasoline futures prices rose again
Tuesday, driven higher by buying due to supply considerations and
technical market factors. Wholesale home heating oil prices pulled
back.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, West Texas Intermediate,
increased 29 cents to settle at $21.51 per 42-gallon barrel. The
contract had gained 93 cents in the two previous sessions.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
unleaded gasoline for May delivery spurted 1.78 cents to 73.86
cents a gallon, after rising 2.06 cents and 1.21 cents on Monday
and Friday, respectively.
   The near-month crude and gasoline contracts are now trading at
the highest levels since January 1986.
   May wholesale home heating oil, which rose 0.85 cent Monday,
skidded 1 cent and settled at 52.76 cents a gallon.
   Several considerations motivated energy brokers to buy Tuesday,
said Mary L. Haskins, a vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.
   Traders bought partly to adjust their holdings before the May
crude contract expires on Thursday. A widespread expectation that
weekly industry statistics due late Tuesday would show a
significant reduction in petroleum stocks also encouraged buying as
did a report that output from an oil platform in the North Sea was
disrupted due to a leak.
   Continuing speculation that supplies will be unusually tight
this spring and summer has lent a bullish tone to the energy
markets lately, particularly in the past three weeks since an Exxon
oil tanker accidentally spilled 10 million gallons of oil in
Valdez, Alaska.

<HEAD>SEC Plans To File Civil Suit Against Bilzerian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission plans to
file a civil suit against Singer Co. Chairman Paul A. Bilzerian,
who already faces criminal charges for alleged securities and tax
fraud, according to a published report.
   The SEC notified Bilzerian last month of its intent to file the
suit seeking ``substantial monetary disgorgement,'' The Wall Street
Journal reported in Tuesday's editions. The notification was
disclosed in court documents, the Journal said.
   According to the documents, William R. McLucas, an SEC
enforcement official, also notified other unidentified individuals
that they would be sued by the agency in connection with the
alleged fraud. McLucas declined to disclose the identities of these
people, the Journal said.
   Bilzerian, 38, is scheduled to go to trial May 1 on the tax and
securities charges involving three corporate raids. Bilzerian has
asserted his innocence.
   The criminal case is likely to go ahead first even if the SEC
files its civil suit before May 1, the newspaper said.
   A civil suit would allow the government to seek to reclaim funds
it alleges were earned illegally. The amount reclaimed through this
process, called disgorgement, often exceeds the amount the
government can collect in fines from a criminal conviction.
   In addition, the burden of proof is less strict in a civil case,
making it easier for the SEC to prove its charges through a civil
suit.
   The criminal charges involve Bilzerian's publicly disclosed
raids on Hammermill Paper Co., H.H. Robertson Co., and Cluett,
Peabody &amp; Co., and an undisclosed investment involving Armco Inc.
   Bilzerian's $1.06 billion takeover of Singer, completed last
year, was not part of the indictment.

   The disposable camera craze will be
coming to a beach and scenic lookout near you very soon thanks to
Eastman Kodak Co.
   The company introduced two throw-away 35mm cameras Tuesday, one
that can be used underwater and another that has a special
wide-angle lens to better capture panoramic views and group shots.
   Both cameras come already loaded with a roll of film and cost
under $15.
   ``With lower prices, added quality and versatility, cameras are
becoming personalized,'' said Wilbur Prezzano, general manager of
photographic products for Kodak.
   Disposable cameras, which are basically cardboard and plastic
wrapped around a roll of film, are used once and taken to a
photofinisher, who removes the film and throws away the camera.
   They were first introduced in Japan several years ago and have
become quite popular there. Both Kodak and Fuji Photo Film Co.
introduced disposable models in the United States in 1987.
   Initially, the disposable cameras were designed for sale to
tourists who may have forgotten their cameras and wanted some
vacation photos. But the two new cameras introduced by Kodak are
designed to broaden that appeal.
   ``These cameras are basically creating new picture opportunities
and bringing more people into photography and that's good,'' said
Mark Obenzinger, a stock analyst with Wood, Gundy &amp; Co. in New York.
   Obenzinger said 9 million disposable cameras will be sold
worldwide this year according to industry estimates. Next year,
that number is expected to reach 15 million.
   Although that's still a small amount, considering that Kodak
estimates there are currently 330 million regular, or
non-disposable, cameras in use around the world, the fast growth
rate has attracted the photo giant's eye.
   That means Kodak will be introducing more disposable cameras in
the future, Prezzano said.
   ``We will continue to brainstorm and ... get feedback from
consumers as to what their needs are. The only limit is the number
of good ideas people come up with,'' he said.
   The two new cameras are:
   _The ``Stretch'' camera, which has a list price of $12.95. It
produces unusual long and narrow prints, 3{ by 10 inches, with a
wide-angle lens. It can capture about one-third more area than
standard ``point-and-shoot'' 35mm cameras.
   It's for use outdoors only and comes loaded with a roll of
200-speed Kodacolor Gold film.
   The ``Stretch'' camera will be available in Europe this summer.
A similar model will also be sold in Japan. The ``Stretch'' will be
available in the United States later this year.
   _The ``Weekend 35'' camera, which can take photographs up to 12
feet underwater and comes loaded with a roll of 24-exposure
Kodacolor Gold 400-speed film.
   Its retail price is $13.95. Kodak will begin selling it along
U.S. coastal areas in late June.
   Kodak also said Tuesday it plans to change the packaging on its
200-speed Kodacolor Gold 35mm film to include the words
``Multi-purpose film'' on the box.
   Analysts said this in response to the introduction two weeks ago
of OneFilm by Polaroid Corp., which company officials touted as a
kind of one-size-fits-all film for consumers who were confused
about what film to buy.
   Kodak also introduced three new 35mm films: a 125-speed film to
round out its new Ektar line for advanced amateur photographers; a
1600-speed Kodacolor Gold color negative film to bring high speed
to its regular line of film; and an improved 400-speed Kodacolor
Gold.

<HEAD>Ramada Agrees to Sell Hotel Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MEL REISNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ramada Inc. will pare down to a gambling
operation and lose its name after completing an agreement to sell
its 825 hotels and motels to New World Development Co. of Hong Kong
for $540 million, Ramada announced Tuesday.
   In turn, Prime Motor Inns of Fairfield, N.J., will pay an
undisclosed sum to New World to operate as franchisor of roughly
600 hotels and motels in the United States that are under the
Ramada and Rodeway names.
   The sale of the hotel group will reduce Ramada's holdings to
three casinos in Nevada and one in Atlantic City, N.J. The Ramada
name will belong to New World, and the gaming company will continue
its headquarters in Phoenix under a new name, which has not been
selected, Cole said.
   Ramada announced March 24 that it had agreed to sell its Marie
Callender Pie Shops restaurant business. That sale for undisclosed
terms will be completed by the end of the month, Cole said.
   Cole said he expected completion of the restructuring within two
to three months.
   Shareholders in Ramada will get $7 a share in cash and
one-quarter share in a new company formed to own and operate
Ramada's present gaming business.
   The transaction is a major step in Ramada's restructuring plan,
begun last October, company Chairman Richard Snell said.
   ``New World and Prime are making a major commitment to achieve
success for the 800-plus hotels in the Ramada and Rodeway
systems,'' Snell said in a prepared release. ``The present Ramada
Inc. shareholders will benefit from their investment with cash and
a continuing interest in the new gaming company.''
   The hotel group has more than 144,000 rooms under the Ramada
Inns, Ramada Hotels, Rodeway Inns and Renaissance Hotels banners.
Prime Motor Inns will not act as franchisor for the Renaissance
Hotels or any overseas Ramada properties.
   Cole said the new company had no immediate plans to purchase
other casinos. Its four properties will be TropWorld Casino and
Entertainment Resort in Atlantic City, Tropicana Resort and Casino
in Las Vegas, Ramada Express Hotel Casino Laughlin, Nev., and
Eddie's Fabulous 50's Casino in Reno.
   He said the new company would employ about 10,000 people. Ramada
currently employs about 20,000 _ half in its gaming operations,
5,600 in the hotel group, and about 3,400 in the restaurant
business.
   Studies last year persuaded the directing board that gaming was
the way to profitability.
   The company lost $5.1 million last year, but Cole said the new
smaller company expected to return to profitability.
   Last year Ramada got $477 million in revenue from casino
operations and $244 million from hotels and motels. It had income
from continuing operations from casinos of $40 million and
operating income from hotels and motels of $15 million.
   Cole announced a preliminary estimate of first-quarter results
showing revenues of $124 million and operating losses of $19
million. Ramada had sales of $101.9 million and a $364,000
operating loss in the year-earlier quarter.

<HEAD>Nine Banks Sue Bank of America for Student Loan Losses Foul-Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine of the world's largest banks are asking
a federal judge to hold Bank of America responsible for up to $650
million in student loan losses, what they called the most expensive
foul-up in the program ever.
   Identical U.S. District Court lawsuits filed Monday said Bank of
America was to blame for the losses because, as the loans trustee,
it failed to ensure proper procedures were followed.
   Huge losses in the complicated case stem from failure to follow
federal guidelines for collection of $1.4 billion in student loans,
which in turn voided federal guarantees for the loans.
   Bank of America, which anticipated the suits, said it would have
no comment because it had yet to see the filings.
   Filing the suits were Citibank, the nation's largest bank;
Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank of the Netherlands; and seven of Japan's
largest banks, Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Sumitomo, Fuji, Industrial Bank of
Japan, Mitsubishi, Bank of Tokyo and Mitsubishi Trust.
   State and federal auditors discovered required collection
procedures were neglected on at least 250,000 loans, the suits said.
   The banks involved in the suits had extended letters of credit
to back the $1.4 billion in loans, mostly to vocational school
students who have a high default rate, the suits said.
   While the letters of credit made the banks responsible for
defaults, the banks believed they were protected because the loans
were guaranteed by the federal government. Strict collection
guidelines were required, however.
   The U.S. Department of Education said in March that it wouldn't
honor the loan guarantees.
   ``As a result, the banks will be forced to pay out hundreds of
millions of dollars ... which will not be reimbursed,'' the
lawsuits said.
   Losses have already exceeded $350 million and estimates of total
losses range from $450 million to $650 million. Bank of Tokyo said
it alone has lost $177 million.

<HEAD>Irish Leasing Company Places $17 Billion Order</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ireland's GPA Group Ltd. joined the aircraft
buying spree Tuesday, announcing a record-breaking order for 308
new planes valued at $17 billion.
   The purchase of jets made by Boeing Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp.
and Europe's Airbus Industrie is the largest civilian aircraft
order ever, topping Delta Air Lines' $10.5 billion order for up to
225 Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft last September.
   The Delta order was followed by other huge purchases, as several
U.S. airlines scrambled to buy new planes.
   At news conferences in New York, London and Paris, GPA officials
said the leasing company had placed firm orders for 121 new planes
and had taken options on another 187, most of which are likely to
be exercised.
   GPA, based in Shannon, Ireland, is one of the world's biggest
aircraft leasing firms. Its leading rivals include International
Lease Finance Corp. of Beverly Hills, Calif., and Ansett Transport
Industries Ltd., a huge Australian company that is half-owned by
media tycoon Rupert Murdoch.
   GPA's order reflects the growing importance of aircraft leasing
companies, which account for about one-fifth of all aircraft
orders. It also underscores the airlines' concern about replacing
their aging fleets.
   Boeing is the major beneficiary of the orders. GPA said it will
buy 182 Boeing airplanes for $9.4 billion, comprised of 92 Boeing
737 narrow-body, twin-jet planes, 50 Boeing 757 narrow-body
twin-jet models and 40 Boeing 767 twin-engine wide-body jets.
   GPA will pay McDonnell Douglas $3.1 billion for 64 MD-80
narrow-body twin-jets and 8 MD-11 wide-body, three-engine jets.
   The leasing company also is ordering $4.3 billion worth of
airplanes from Airbus Industrie, a European aircraft manufacturing
consortium. GPA will buy 30 Airbus A320s, 10 A330s and two A340s.
In addition, the company took options on another 10 A330s and two
A340s.
   GPA plans to take delivery of 80 to 100 new planes a year over
the next six to seven years.
   GPA said the engine suppliers include CFMI, a joint venture of
General Electric Co. of the United States and France's Societe
Nationale d'Etudes et Construction de Moteurs Aviation; General
Electric; United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt and Whitney;
Rolls-Royce PLC, and International Aero Engines, jointly owned by
United Technologies, Daimler-Benz AG and Rolls-Royce.
   ``This significant commitment means that we expect to purchase
about 10 percent of all of the commercial jet aircraft delivered
through the mid-1990s,'' GPA Chairman and Chief Executive T.A. Ryan
told reporters in New York. ``We will thus maintain our leadership
and dominant market share of the new aircraft operating lease
business which continues to grow rapidly.''
   Aircraft leasing fills the gap between manufacturers unable to
keep up with demand and airlines in a hurry to get planes to stay
competitive. Lessors like GPA buy up batches of different kinds of
planes and lease them to carriers in a pinch.
   ``For the first time, it provides massive flexibility for the
airlines and particularly the smaller carriers,'' Ryan said. ``The
airline business is going to increase and the number of passengers
is going to increase very dramatically.''
   The average length of a GPA operating lease is 6{ years. Its
relatively young fleet of planes are an average 3 years old,
compared with around 12 years for jetliners operated by U.S.
carriers.
   Ryan said the financing for the purchases will be provided by a
group of U.S. and Japanese banks led by Citibank.
   GPA, one of Ireland's largest firms, is privately owned by
several companies, including Air Canada, the Irish airline Aer
Lingus, Prudential Insurance of the United States and Mitsubishi
Trust Bank of Japan. Air Canada and Aer Lingus hold stakes of 16
percent ats for 1988-1989 are expected to total $150 million, up
from $101 million in the previous fiscal year.

   At $17 billion, Tuesday's aircraft order by
Ireland's GPA Group Ltd. for 308 new planes from three
manufacturers became by far the biggest order in aviation history
for commercial jetliners.
   Here is a look at the GPA order and other major orders placed in
the industry, by size:
   _$17 billion by GPA. Boeing Co. received $9.4 billion in firm
orders for 92 Boeing 737 models, 50 757s and 40 767s. All have two
engines. McDonnell Douglas Corp. got firm orders of $3.1 billion
for 64 MD-80 twin-jets and 8 MD-11 three-jet models. Europe's
Airbus Industrie received firm orders of $4.3 billion for 30 A320s,
10 A330s, and two A340s. Also, options for an additional 10 A330s
and two A340s.
   _$10.7 billion order in September 1988 to Boeing and McDonnell
Douglas by Delta Air Lines. The airline ordered nine MD-11 jumbo
jets and nine Boeing 767s, and took options on another 31 MD-11s,
16 767s, 100 MD-88s and 50 Boeing 757s. Value estimated by analysts
since Delta did not divulge dollar amounts.
   _$6 billion order in February 1989 to McDonnell Douglas by
American Airlines, for 50 MD-11 wide-body jetliners, at $4 billion,
and 100 MD-80s, at $2 billion. Only eight orders for MD-11s are
firm. Value estimated by industry analyst, since neither the
manufacturer nor buyer would divulge details.
   _Up to $5.20 billion in orders in March 1989 by American
Airlines for up to 150 Dutch Fokker-100 short-haul planes and 35
Boeing jetliners. American placed firm orders for 75 Fokkers and
options for another 75 in a deal potentially worth $3.09 billion.
The Boeing order is for 25 757-200s and 10 767-300ER aircraft, with
an estimated value of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion.
   _$5.04 billion order in May 1988 to Boeing and Airbus Industrie
by International Lease Finance Corp. Orders were for 78 Boeing
737s, 18 Boeing 767s and four 747 Boeing jumbo jets, plus four
Airbus A300s, six A310s, 18 A320s and two A340s. Options include 19
737s, four 767s and one 747.
   _$4.1 billion order in August 1986 by British Airways PLC for 16
late-model 747s and 12 options.
   _$4.1 billion order in December 1987 by Air France for 16
late-model 747s and 12 options.

   For 1988, Boeing's orders for 640 jetliners represented more
than one-half of all the 1,104 jetliners ordered from major
manufacturers. Others were McDonnell Douglas, 240; Airbus, 161;
British Aerospace, 39, and Fokker, 24.

<HEAD>Inflation Hits 6.1 Percent, at an Annual Rate, in First Quarter</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 5th graf pvs, Stock prices, with market closing at post-crash
high.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Higher food and energy costs boosted consumer
prices 0.5 percent in March and resulted in a 6.1 percent annual
inflation rate for the first three months of 1989, the largest
quarterly advance in two years, the government said Tuesday.
   Last month's gain in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index
was fresh evidence that inflation continues to run above the 4.4
percent rate registered in both 1987 and 1988.
   Analysts said the bad news isn't over yet.
   ``Inflation was uncomfortably high, widespread and entrenched in
March,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co. ``We
haven't seen the last of these high numbers because there will
still be a rippling through of rising business costs for both
materials and wages and rising energy costs in the next few
months.''
   But stock prices rose sharply, with the Dow Jones 30-stock
industrial average gaining 41.61 points to close at 2,379.40, a
post-crash high.
   Thomas Walsh of Nikko Securities International in New York said
that ``people were expecting the numbers to be worse. It's not a
great number but the street is viewing it as an OK number and it
has stimulated buy interest.''
   Economist James Annable of the First National Bank of Chicago
commented:
   ``The market is betting that the economy is slowing down pretty
dramatically. I suspect that's wrong. We expect slower growth, but
good growth. Inflation is going to continue to inch upward.''
   Expectations that the economy is cooling off were bolstered by a
report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday that showed housing
starts had fallen 5.4 percent in March, with construction of
single-family homes beginning at the slowest pace in more than four
years.
   ``The only good news on inflation was the bad news on housing,
underscoring a weak first quarter economy and raising hope that
later on inflation can recede,'' Sinai said.
   For a year, the Federal Reserve Board has been nudging interest
rates upward in an effort to slow the economy and arrest inflation.
But a growing number of analysts are worried that the
anti-inflation campaign will slow the economy so much that the
unintended result will be a recession.
   ``The Fed needs to ease pretty soon,'' said David Seiders, chief
economist for the National Association of Home Builders. ``If they
don't, I think a recession in late 1989 or early 1990 is probably
inevitable.''
   Economist John Hagens of the WEFA Group, a forecasting firm in
Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said the nation appears destined for a round of
``stagflation,'' in which the economy slows while prices continue
to rise, forcing the Federal Reserve to choose between further
restraining growth to curb inflation and boosting the economy to
stimulate employment.
   President Bush told a building trades group the key to continued
economic health for the nation is bringing down inflation and
interest rates by reducing the federal deficit.
   ``We must keep inflation and interest rates down and ... the way
to do that is to bring the budget deficit down,'' he said.
   The March increase was traced in part to higher food costs,
which last month rose 0.8 percent, twice as fast as in February.
   Taken together, prices for meats, poultry, fish and eggs rose
2.4 percent.
   Energy costs, meanwhile, registered their sharpest increase
since August 1987, advancing 1.1 perent, practically double the
preceding month's 0.6 percent.
   Gasoline prices climbed 2.1 percent last month after rising 1.7
percent in February. For the first quarter, gasoline costs jumped
4.8 percent.
   The boost in petroleum-based energy prices, up at a 22.4 percent
annual rate so far this year, accounted for nearly one-half of the
first quarter price acceleration, the Labor Department said.
   Food price increases were responsible for nearly one-fourth of
the quarter's gain, the department said.
   Excluding those two volatile categories, consumer prices rose
0.4 percent in March, the same as in February.
   Clothing prices rose 1.4 percent last month after dropping 0.2
percent in February. The increase was blamed on the introduction of
higher-priced spring and summer fashions, particularly for women.
   Medical care expenses rose 0.5 percent after jumping 0.8 percent
in the preceding month.
   The March figures left the overall Consumer Price Index at 122.3
percent of its 1982-84 base, meaning that a hypothetical selection
of goods costing $100 in the base period would have cost $122.30 in
March, 70 cents more than in February.
   The overall index, unlike other figures in the retail price
report, is not adjusted to remove the effect of periodic,
predictable seasonal fluctuations.
   In another government report Tuesday, the Labor Department said
Americans' average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation,
were down 0.1 percent in March after falling 0.9 percent a month
earlier.
   Average weekly earnings, before adjusting for inflation, were
$328.86, up 4.1 percent from a year earlier.

<HEAD>Speedup in Crop Payments Announced to Help Farmers Recover from Drought</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs graf 17, bgng ``Asked if,'' to refer to current drought
in winter wheat belt; adds four grafs on export subsidy program. Also moved
on general news wires.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday announced a speedup
in crop payments to help farmers recover from last summer's drought
but said that ``perilous budget-deficit times'' will mean cuts in
other farm programs.
   Speaking on a radio interview program from the Agriculture
Department, Bush said he was authorizing the acceleration of
price-support payments ``to provide some extra money to farmers
early in the crop year.''
   ``We're listening. We are with the American farmer in these
tough times,'' Bush said.
   He said the move would mean about $850 million in early payments
for wheat, feed-grain, rice and cotton farmers.
   The step also helps budget writers meet deficit-reduction
targets for 1990 by shifting the $850 million out of fiscal 1990,
which begins on Oct. 1, and into the current fiscal year.
   Bush, putting on headphones in a small broadcast booth in the
Agriculture Department, answered questions from agricultural
broadcasters for about 15 minutes. The program was sent out over
the agency's agricultural radio network.
   The president also announced creation of a working group on
rural development to be headed by Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter. He said the group would evaluate existing federal
rural-development programs and make recommendations.
   ``Events such as last year's drought reinforce the need to
develop and diversify the rural economy in the years ahead,'' Bush
said.
   The price announcement made by Bush makes an additional 10
percent available to farmers in so-called advance-deficiency
payments.
   These are advances farmers can draw from the government at the
start of a crop season against later payments.
   Tuesday's action raised from the current 40 percent to 50
percent the size of advance payments wheat and feed-grain farmers
can collect, and from 30 percent to 40 percent the share rice and
cotton farmers can collect in advance.
   The advances are against anticipated government support
subsidies to help farmers recover the difference between market
prices and federally set target prices.
   One interviewer asked Bush how he reconciled heavy cuts in farm
programs under the budget compromise recently negotiated by the
White House and congressional leaders with his campaign vow not to
balance the budget on farmer's back.
   ``We are in perilous budget-deficit times. We've got to get the
deficit down. And the best thing we can do to help the American
farmer is to get these interest rates down. And the best way to do
that is to make the tough decision on the spending side of our
budget,'' he said.
   ``Now, having said that, I feel that farmers are (for) fair
play,'' Bush added.
   ``Yes, `ag' is taking a hit. But so is a wide array of programs
across the board,'' he said.
   Asked if the speedup in payments would be the sum total of
federal help for producers who are being hurt by the drought
currently gripping Kansas and much of the winter wheat area, Bush
said: ``This should not be viewed as the definitive answer. We hope
it is something that will help the farm family.''
   Yeutter, who appeared with Bush on the program, added: ``Clearly
we don't have an open spigot that just spits out federal dollars in
any situation today. But we'll be as sympathetic and as
accommodative as we can be within rather severe budgetary
restraints.''
   Asked about reports that the government's program to subsidize
exports of wheat and other farm commodities is being scuttled,
Yeutter said no such plan is in the works. However, as he has
previously, Yeutter said the USDA's Export Enhancement Program, or
EEP, will come under review.
   But no EEP allocations currently in effect will be curtailed, he
said. The program provides subsidies to private exporters for the
sale of designated commodities to specific countries at reduced
prices. The object is to make U.S. products competitive with other
foreign suppliers, notably the European Economic Community.
   ``All that is at issue at the moment is any future allocations
that might be made'' under the EEP, he said. Those will be
considered on a case-by-case basis ``primarily because of our
stocks (of grain) condition and the weather conditions that now
prevail.''
   But Yeutter stressed that ``this is not to suggest that we're
going to put any kind of moratorium on the EEP program ... we
haven't made that kind of decision.''

<HEAD>GTE Earnings Rise 15 Percent; MCI Up 121 Percent; SW Bell Up 9.2
Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Telephone companies reported higher earnings Tuesday, with gains
of 121 percent at MCI Communications Corp., 15 percent at GTE Corp.
and 9.2 percent at Southwestern Bell Corp.
   MCI, the Washington-based long-distance company, said its
earnings rose to a record $128 million, or 51 cents a share, from
$58 million or 20 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue rose 33
percent to $1.5 billion from $1.13 billion a year earlier.
   Bert C. Roberts Jr., MCI's president and chief operating
officer, attributed the success to increased traffic that more than
offset a rate cut. MCI signed data-networking contracts during the
quarter with such companies as Chrysler Corp. and Cray Research
Inc., Roberts said.
   GTE said its earnings rose to $329 million, or 97 cents a share,
from $286 million, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
rose 5 percent to $4.1 billion from $3.9 billion a year earlier.
   Local telephone service, the company's major business, gained 7
percent in revenue to $3 billion. It said operating income rose
only fractionally to $689 million because of rate actions by
regulators in California and Texas.
   St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell said its net income for the
first quarter rose to $238.8 million, or 79 cents a share, compared
with earnings of $218.7 million, or 73 cents a share, in the first
quarter of last year. Revenue rose 2.9 percent to $2.1 billion from
$2 billion in 1988.
   Southwestern Bell Chairman Zane Barnes said the improvement was
tied to to the region's economic recovery.

<HEAD>Palladium Futures Plunge Again On Fusion Skepticism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Palladium futures prices plummeted the permitted daily limit for
the second straight session Tuesday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange amid growing skepticism about the market impact of recent
nuclear fusion research.
   Other precious metals prices also declined, largely in reaction
to government reports that showed weaker inflation than many
observers had expected.
   On other markets, gasoline futures surged while other petroleum
futures were mixed; grain and soybean futures retreated; and
livestock and meat were mixed.
   Palladium settled $3.35 to $9 lower with the contract for
delivery in June at $165.65 a troy ounce. The daily price limit was
expanded to $9 from $6 following Monday's limit decline.
   The spot price of palladium on the New York Merc fell to $165 a
troy ounce, $20 below the 8-year high reached last Thursday on
speculation that demand for the white metal would explode in the
wake of a startling fusion experiment at the University of Utah.
   In that project, scientists used both palladium and platinum as
components in an experiment in which they claimed to have recreated
in a jar of water the nuclear reaction that powers the sun and
stars.
   Palladium and platinum futures prices fell sharply Monday
following weekend news reports that the Utah finding was unlikely
to stir significant new demand for the metals.
   More speculators bailed out or took profits on Tuesday, despite
Utah chemistry professor B. Stanley Pons' announcement that more
than 60 university and private laboratories had at least partially
verified the results obtained by him and his research partner,
Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton, England.
   ``No one's really sure what are the practical applications and
how long it will take for it to reallly absorb into the market,''
said Jack Barbanel, director of futures trading with Gruntal &amp; Co.,
a New York brokerage house.
   Platinum futures prices also fell, but much more modestly than
palladium and more in line with gold, which slipped in reaction to
the Labor Department's report of a lower-than-expected 0.5 percent
rise in consumer prices in March.
   Platinum settled $2.20 to $2.70 lower on the New York Merc with
July at $548.50 a troy ounce. On New York's Commodity Exchange,
gold settled $2.70 to $3.50 lower with June at $387.40 a troy
ounce; silver was 5 cents to 7.9 cents lower with May at $5.78 a
troy ounce.
   Gasoline futures continued their strong advance on the New York
Merc on expectations that the American Petroleum Institute's weekly
survey would show a drop in U.S. gasoline supplies.
   Indeed, the API reported after the close that gasoline stocks
fell by 2.1 million barrels last week. Crude oil stocks were down
5.7 million barrels and distillate stocks increased by 516,000
barrels.
   In Tuesday's trading, West Texas Intermediate crude settled 3
cents lower to 29 cents higher with May at $21.51 a barrel; heating
oil was .21 cent to 1 cent lower with May at 52.76 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .90 cent to the limit 2 cents higher with May
at 73.86 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade on a forecast for rain in the Corn Belt and
signs that the United States is becoming stingier with its wheat
exports.
   Wheat settled 1 cent to 3\ cents lower with May at $4.07 a
bushel; corn was 1\ cents to 2\ cents lower with May at $2.75{ a
bushel; oats were } cent to 1{ cents lower with May at $1.98\ a
bushel; soybeans were 5 cents lower to 1\ cents higher with May at
$7.48{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures finished narrowly mixed in choppy,
lackluster trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle settled .25 cent lower to .28 cent higher with June
at 71.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .27 cent
higher with May at 76.45 cents a pound; live hogs were .12 cent
lower to .35 cent higher with June at 46.50 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .30 cent lower to .60 cent higher with May at
33.30 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Apple Computer Reports 29 Percent Profit Drop; Lotus Off 71 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc. reported a 29 percent drop in its quarterly
profit Tuesday, while Lotus Development Corp. said its earnings
fell 71 percent.
   Apple, the personal computer giant based in Cupertino, Calif.,
said earnings in its second fiscal quarter were hurt by previously
announced problems with high-cost computer memory chips.
   Apple's net income fell to $56.4 million from $79.7 million
while earnings per share were 44 cents compared to 61 cents for the
second quarter of 1988.
   Net sales were $1.25 billion, a 44 percent increase over the net
sales of $867 million a year ago.
   For the first six months of its fiscal year, Apple said its
profit slipped to $196.8 million, or $1.54 per share, from $201
million, or $1.53 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $2.65
billion from $1.91 billion.
   John Sculley, Apple's chairman and chief executive, said the
problem of an oversupply of chips bought at peak prices ``is now
substantially behind us.''
   International sales accounted for 40 percent of total revenues
during the second quarter. The figure was 38 percent in the second
quarter last year.
   ``Macintosh sales continue to record strong gains around the
world,'' said Sculley.
   In January, the company, fresh from a 16 percent profit jump in
the first quarter, said it expected earnings to drop significantly.
Analysts predicted earnings per share would fall to 35 cents to 45
cents.
   The purchase of the 1 million-bit memory chips was made at a
time when prices were high because of a worldwide shortage of the
memory chip. Apple then increased its prices on the more expensive
models of its Macintosh system, a move that hurt sales when
customers favored less expensive systems.
   In an effort to rekindle sales, Apple cut the prices on its
higher-priced Macintosh models.
   ``We are well on our way to surpassing $5 billion in revenues
this fiscal year,'' Sculley said today. ``As we enter the second
half of fiscal 1989, we are experiencing strong demand for our
Macintosh products, particularly our two newest computers, the
SE-30 and the IIcx.''
   Lotus, the Cambridge, Mass.-based maker of personal computer
software, said first-quarter earnings fell to $5.3 million, or 13
cents a share, from $18.3 million, or 40 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose to $120 million from $117.3 million a year
earlier.
   Lotus hit a setback last fall when it announced that the newest
version of the spreadsheet program Lotus 1-2-3, the engine that has
driven growth since 1983, was projected to be shipped in the second
quarter of 1989 instead of the end of 1988 as planned.
   Company officials said Tuesday that Release 3 of 1-2-3, a
three-dimensional spreadsheet, is being tested and is on schedule
for June shipment.
   ``First-quarter revenues came in as expected and we're
encouraged by a number of trends,'' said Jim Manzi, Lotus president.

<HEAD>Dollar Closes Lower In Europe; Gold Falls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell Tuesday in reaction to an
inflation report that helped stocks and bonds. Gold prices also
fell.
   The Labor Department said consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in
March, which was in line with expectations and diminished concern
that the Federal Reserve would tighten credit to slow the economy
and quell inflation.
   Tight credit is bad for the stock and bond markets but it helps
the dollar by encouraging foreign investors to buy dollars to take
advantage of high U.S. interest rates.
   The government report confirmed that inflation has reached a
higher plateau but nonetheless did not indicate inflation as severe
as some had predicted.
   ``It was just another indication to the interest-rate players
that perhaps the Fed can sit back for the time being without
forcing rates higher,'' said Scott Horwitz, a senior trader at the
Bank of Boston in New York.
   Friday's news that the March producer price index rose only 0.4
percent had already signaled the slowdown.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7185 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.7095 Monday. The
pound also rose against the dollar in New York, to $1.7164 from
$1.7133.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.27 Japanese yen to a closing 132.10 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 131.48 yen. In New York, the
dollar fell to 131.40 yen from 132.16.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8525 West German marks, down from 1.8605; 1.6270
Swiss francs, down from 1.6405; 1.1863 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1850; 6.2710 French francs, down from 6.3005; and 1,360.13
Italian lire, down from 1,366.35.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday:
1.8528 West German marks, down from 1.8565; 1.6283 Swiss francs,
down from 1.6385; 6.2750 French francs, down from 6.2825; 2.0935
Dutch guilders, down from 2.0953; 1,366.95 Italian lire, up from
1,364.00; 1.1848 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1855.
   In Hong Kong, gold fell 6 cents to close at a bid $386.68 a troy
ounce.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $383.25 a troy ounce,
compared with $385.00 bid late Monday. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold
fell to close at a bid $384.00 compared with $384.50 bid late
Monday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold fell to $383.50 an
ounce from $386.20 Monday. Later, Republic National Bank of New
York said gold bullion was bid at $383.10 an ounce as of 4 p.m.
EDT, down from $385.30 late Monday.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market to a late bid
price of $5.78 a troy ounce, compared with Monday's $5.80. On the
New York Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell to $5.763
an ounce from $5.811 on Monday.

   Scott Paper Co. reported record
first-quarter sales, net income and per-share earnings Tuesday,
despite increased pulp and other manufacturing costs.
   Dollar sales increased 13 percent to $1.27 billion from $1.13
billion in 1988, while first-quarter net income rose to $86.5
million compared to $74.0 million last year. Primary earnings were

   The stock market surged to a new post-crash high
in active trading Tuesday, after new economic data signaled
moderation in the economy and helped ease fears about inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials shot up 41.61 points to
2,379.40, the highest level since the Oct. 19, 1987, stock market
collapse and well above its previous post-crash high of 2,347.14 on
Feb. 7.
   Tuesday's move was also the sharpest one-day rise since Oct. 20,
1988, when the blue-chip indicator rose 43.92 points.
   In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declining
ones by about 11 to 5 in nationwide trading of New York Stock
Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,047 issues up, 471 down and 464
unchanged.
   Share prices leaped at the opening following a sharp rally in
the bond market on news that housing starts were down dramatically
and consumer prices were in line with expectations.
   The Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell 5.4
percent last month amid rising mortgage rates while applications
for building permits plunged 13.7 percent.
   Although the housing numbers raised recession concerns, stock
analysts said the market interpreted the report as good news
because it signaled a slowing economy which could lead to lower
inflation.
   Consumer prices jumped 0.5 percent in March, slightly below
market expectations of about 0.6 percent, according to a report
from the Labor Department.
   ``The number was not better than expected but within
expectations,'' said Jack Garry, equity analyst with Butcher &amp;
Singer Inc. ``The market is still concerned about inflation but the
figures were encouraging. The economy appears to be headed in the
right direction.''
   The reports also raised the prospect that the Federal Reserve
would avert further credit tightening.
   ``The rise in the bond market and decline in interest rates
suggests at a minimum that the Federal Reserve is not going to
tighten credit further and ... is going to be under pressure to
lean in the other direction, that is, ease monetary policy,'' said
Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at First Albany Corp.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 208.65 million
shares, up from 128.54 million in Monday's session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 247.057 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $35.003 billion in
value, or 1.17 percent. The NYSE's composite index of all its
listed common stocks rose 2.08 to 171.13.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Northwest Airlines
rose 7[ to 97] after its parent company announced that it might
sell the nation's fourth-largest airline, amid takeover threats
from billionaire oilman Marvin Davis and others.
   Prime Motor Inns, which agreed to acquire Ramada's U.S.
franchise, rose 2{ to 28\, while Ramada fell } to 11]. Citicorp
gained 1[ to 30\ and Wells Fargo rose 2 to 70~.
   K mart closed down 1[ at 38[ after a disappointing earnings
forecast and Lockheed fell [ to 45}.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 4.86 to 352.87, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 4.30 to 306.02.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose

<HEAD>IRS Rules LILCO May Deduct Shoreham Losses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS ^Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service has ruled that
Long Island Lighting Co. can write off losses it would sustain as a
result of a plan to scrap the Shoreham nuclear power plant, utility
officials said Tuesday.
   The decision will allow LILCO to write off some $2.8 billion in
losses it anticipates if it wins approval of a deal to sell
Shoreham to the state, which would then dismantle it, LILCO
spokesman Jim Lois said.
   The IRS's latest ruling confirmed its Sept. 15 decision to allow
LILCO to write off losses from an earlier plan to dismantle
Shoreham, he said. That plan, which had required approval of the
state Legislature, fell apart when lawmakers declined to vote and
the deal expired.
   But New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and LILCO reached a new settlement
earlier this year which did not require legislative approval. The
new agreement, which would sell Shoreham to the state for $1 in
exchange for a decade of annual rate increases of up to 5 percent,
is one step away from approval.
   ``I guess what (the IRS) did is they reviewed the new settlement
agreement, realized it's fundamentally the same for tax purposes as
the agreement of 1988, and have isued a letter ruling that we
received today confirming our entitlement to a tax writeoff,'' Lois
said.
   The IRS ruling came one day after the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission staff reported that the embattled $5.5 billion plant
meets all federal safety requirements and is ``operationally
ready.'' NRC Chairman Lando Zech tentatively set a vote on the
full-power license for Thursday and all indications are the license
will be granted.
   However, the action may be largely symbolic. Under the latest
shutdown plan, LILCO has agreed not to put the license to use until
its shareholders vote on the negotiated settlement. That vote must
take place on or before June 15, and LILCO Chairman William J.
Catacosinos told the NRC Monday that the utility's board will
recommend that shareholders approve the deal.
   LILCO and the state would then seek to have Shoreham's license
transferred to the Long Island Power Authority and the New York
Power Authority would oversee decommissioning and dismantling of
the plant.
   However, the Department of Energy has said it would attempt to
block transfer of the license, although a DOE spokesman said Monday
that strategy was still being worked out.

   President Bush scored points with organized
labor Tuesday in his first post-election speech to a union audience
but avoided any talk of his positions on the Eastern Airlines
strike and minimum wage, which have soured labor's relations with
the new administration.
   ``I want this door at the White House to stay open,'' Bush told
about 3,000 delegates representing building trades unions from
across the country. ``I want to work with you.''
   The closest Bush came to discussing his recent differences with
labor was when he told the delegates: ``There's a lot more to the
relationship between the White House and the labor organizations
than one issue or another. ... We have had honest differences but
we agree on goals and what matters is that we make progress on
issues of shared concern.''
   Bush was received politely by the union delegates but came under
fire later in the day on Capitol Hill, where Democrats leading the
labor-backed effort to raise the minimum wage chastised the
president for refusing to negotiate with them and accused him of
turning his back on the nation's working poor.
   ``President Bush has been poorly advised to test his political
muscle on innocent victims of an inadequate minimum wage; the old,
the young, the disadvantaged and even the ambitious trying to pay
the escalating cost of education,'' said Rep. Austin Murphy, D-Pa.
   The Democrats compared Bush's promise to veto their minimum-wage
bill with his efforts to expand capital gains tax breaks, a
proposal whose benefits would primarily be enjoyed predominantly by
wealthy Americans.
   ``The president ought to have as much concern for the poor as he
does for the rich,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell.
   Labor had several visible confrontations with former President
Reagan on issues like the firing of striking air traffic
controllers and White House opposition to legislation requiring
employers to give workers advance notice of plant closings. But
labor's lasting resentment toward Bush's predecessor stems more
from what they considered to be staunchly anti-union appointments
to the National Labor Relations Board.
   Bush took pains to avoid exciting the labor animosity that
flourished during the Reagan years. He praised the already cordial
crowd and improved his standing with labor leaders by promising to
make NLRB appointments ``whose neutrality and integrity are above
reproach.''
   ``My appointments will not be anti-labor or, as I say,
anti-business. They will be based on fair trade,'' Bush said, as a
shout of ``Amen'' was heard from one Texas delegate in the
applauding audience.
   ``That is indeed a welcome step,'' said AFL-CIO spokesman Rex
Hardesty.
   Bush also praised the group's patriotism, role in the nation's
economic growth and efforts on behalf of Poland's Solidarity
movement, saying ``wherever the free trade movement is threatened,
so too is democracy.''
   But noticeably missing from the speech were any direct
references to Bush's promise to veto minimum wage bills that have
cleared the House and Senate or his refusal to intervene to block a
strike that has grounded Eastern for nearly two months.
   Union leaders said the omissions were not surprising.
   ``I wouldn't expect him to discuss those fronts,'' said Hardesty.
   ``It might have turned the audience (against him) real fast,''
said another union official who asked not to be identified.
   Bush has promised to veto the minimum wage measures because they
would raise the base wage to $4.55 an hour, 30 cents an hour more
than the president supports, and do not contain a provision
allowing all new employees to be paid a subminimum wage for six
months. Bush has said such a ``training wage'' must be part of any
minimum wage increase for him to support it.
   In refusing to exercise his authority to block the Eastern
strike, Bush became the first president to ignore a recommendation
of the National Mediation Board.
   Those decisions have soured the early tone of labor's relations
with the Bush White House, but labor leaders still view Bush far
more favorably than they did Reagan.
   And the group he appeared before Tuesday was among the safest of
union audiences for Bush. The president of the AFL-CIO Building and
Construction Trades Department, Robert A. Georgine, is a longtime
acquaintance of the president and among the unions represented at
the conference was the Teamsters, the only major union to endorse
Bush in the presidential race.
   Georgine introduced Bush as ``one of the finest individuals this
country has ever produced'' and said the president ``can differ
with you philosophically or politically and still hold your
respect, and you his.''
   Bush was warmly received by the delegates, who gave him standing
ovations when he entered and left. Missing, however, was the
cheering and other signs of enthusiasm that punctuated ovations
Monday for House Speaker Jim Wright and Mitchell.
   Mitchell told the delegates ``the president is against us'' and
had urged them to question Bush about the minimum wage. But there
was no opportunity for them to do so.

<HEAD>Mass. High Court Says Paramount Not Liable for Post-Film Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paramount Pictures and a local movie theater are
not responsible for the death of a teen-ager who was knifed by a
young man who had just seen the 1979 film ``The Warriors,'' a
Massachusetts court ruled Tuesday.
   The victim's family had filed suit against Paramount and the
Saxon Theatre Corp., seeking damages on the grounds of wrongful
death. They charged that Paramount and the theater knew that ``The
Warriors'' was inciting violence around the country.
   In Superior Court, Judge Harold Flannery dismissed the suit on
the grounds that the movie-maker and theater had no ``special
relationship'' to the dead youth and therefore had no duty to
protect him from his attacker.
   When the family appealed, the state Supreme Court decided to
hear the case. In a unanimous ruling written by Justice Francis
O'Connor, the high court upheld the dismissal but added that the
defendants were protected by constitutional rights.
   ``Although the film is rife with violent scenes, it does not at
any point exhort, urge, entreat, solicit or overtly advocate or
encourage unlawful or violent activity on the part of viewers,''
O'Connor wrote. ``It does not create the likelihood of inciting or
producing `imminent lawless action' that would strip the film of
First Amenment protection.''
   The suit was filed in 1981 by William Yakubowicz on behalf of
his dead son, Martin, against Paramount and Saxon.
   The complaint charged that 16-year-old Martin died from a knife
wound inflicted on the night of Feb. 15, 1979, by Michael Barrett,
who was returning from seeing ``The Warriors'' at Saxon's theater
on Tremont Street in Boston.
   According to court records, two other youths had been killed
near theaters showing ``The Warriors'' in Palm Springs and Oxnard,
Calif., just three days before Yakubowicz was stabbed in Boston.
That same week, Paramount officers advised theaters showing the
film to hire security guards and offered to pay for them.
   After viewing the film themselves, the Supreme Court justices
rejected the family's argument that ``The Warriors'' was an
incitement to illegal violence. For that reason, the court held
Paramount blameless in making it and Saxon blameless in showing it.

<HEAD>Korean Minister Begins High-Level Meetings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea's minister of trade and industry
began a series of meetings with top U.S. officials Monday about the
two countries' booming trade and U.S. irritation over Korea's
multibillion-dollar surplus with America.
   Minister Han Seung-soo's visit was regarded as part of Seoul's
efforts to persuade the Bush administration not to target South
Korea under a new U.S. law authorizing sanctions against countries
with persistent surpluses regarded as the result of trade practices
harmful to American business.
   Han met Monday with Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, U.S.
Trade Representative Carla Hills and officials of the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce. He was Mosbacher's dinner guest. The minister also met
Edward Derwinski, secretary of veterans affairs, whose past
relations with Korea were aired during Derwinski's confirmation
process.
   Meetings were scheduled Tuesday with Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and influential
Democratic Congressmen Dan Rostenkowski and Sam Gibbons.
   Han planned more Washington meetings Wednesday followed by a
visit to New York to address the Asia Society and meet former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
   His visit was preceded by the announcement last week of
purchases of more than $1.5 billion worth of U.S. jetliners by
Korean-based carriers.
   Two-way U.S.-South Korean trade is about $35 billion a year,
with last year's U.S. deficit $8.6 billion.
   Korea boosted purchases of American products 45 percent last
year and is second only to Japan in purchase of U.S. foodstuffs. It
is the sixth-largest overall buyer of American products.

   The government on Tuesday unveiled the broad
outlines of a plan for states to help poor families get off welfare
and become self-sufficient by requiring aid recipients to
participate in education, job training and work programs.
   The plan provides that one parent in two-parent welfare families
will have to work at least 16 hours a week in the public or private
sector as a condition for receiving benefits, and single welfare
parents with children 3 years or older will have to participate in
employment and training programs. Also, teen-age parents who have
not completed high school will be required to return to school or
work toward an equivalent degree.
   The plan requires states to guarantee child care for parents who
participate in the education and training programs.
   The Department of Health and Human Services outlined the plan in
proposed regulations to implement the Job Opportunities and Basic
Skills Training program _ a $3.3 billion, five-year initiative
passed by Congress last year as part of the Family Support Act.
   The legislation was the first major overhaul of the country's
welfare system in a half-century.
   The regulations, published in Tuesday's Federal Register, are
open to public comment for 60 days. The department is to issue
final rules by October.
   States initially will have to bring 7 percent of their caseload
in Aid to Families with Dependent Children programs under the new
plan, and by 1994 will be required to have 20 percent in the
program.
   Kathy Patterson of the American Public Welfare Association,
which represents the state human services agencies that will
implement the program, said the association remains concerned that
the participation rates ``don't reflect realistic performance
goals''.
   As a result, she said, states may wind up ``channeling people
through meaningless tasks'' to meet the terms of the law.
   Alica Smith of the National Governors' Association said the
regulations require single parents with children 3 years old and
older to spend 35 hours a week in employment and training programs
to be counted as a JOBS participant. But some of these programs do
not meet for 35 hours a week, so welfare agencies will have to find
something else for people in those programs to do to count them as
participants.
   HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan, speaking at a news conference,
called the law and the regulations ``a turning point for our
nation's welfare system.
   ``At a time when as many as one in four American children are
born into poverty, the JOBS program will be especially important in
helping to break the generational cycle of long-term dependency,''
he said.
   The regulations set out the framework within which each state
will design its JOBS program. Any state that doesn't comply risks
losing federal funds for AFDC, the primary government assistance
program for poor families. About 90 percent of such families are
headed by women.
   Sullivan estimated that up to 138,000 families will be able to
leave the welfare rolls over the next five years and said that ``is
only a beginning.'' About 3.5 million families receive AFDC, which
costs the federal government about $8.5 billion a year. States
match the federal share with their own funds.
   The JOBS program is expected to cost the federal government
about $3.3 billion over the next five years, Sullivan said. States
must match the federal money with at least 50 percent of their own
money. The matching rates vary among the different sections of the
program.
   State programs are required to be in place by Oct. 1, 1990, but
states may have their plans approved by the Department of Health
and Human Services and in place on July 1 of this year. Seventeen
states and the District of Columbia have told HHS they want to
begin their programs in July, officials said.
   Those states are Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Georgia,
Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New
Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and
Wisconsin.

<HEAD>Earnings Up 82.4 Percent Despite Takeover Fight Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp. said Tuesday its
first-quarter profit climbed 82.4 percent despite the sizeable
costs of a bitter eight-month battle to stave off a takeover
attempt.
   Net earnings were $25.9 million, or 29 cents per share, for the
first quarter compared with $14.2 million, or 23 cents a share, in
the first quarter of 1988.
   First-quarter revenue rose 7.8 percent to $442.3 million from
$410.1 million a year earlier.
   The latest results include $38.5 million in expenses involved in
fighting off Shamrock Holdings Inc.'s hostile bid.
   Those expenses included $20 million reimbursement for a portion
of Shamrock's expenses stemming from the litigation and tender
offer and $18.5 million in its own legal, investment banking and
other expenses.
   Operating profits nearly tripled to $73.4 million from $26.2
million in the same period in 1988.
   I. MacAllister Booth, Polaroid president and chief executive,
said the first quarter profits resulted from changes made in the
cost structure, manufacturing operations and work force at the
company.
   ``Expanding consumer, business and industrial instant film usage
is a key element in our overall strategy,'' said Booth. ``...This
redirection of our marketing efforts has enabled us to spend
marketing dollars more efficiently, reducing marketing expenses
while, at the same time, allowing us to target the distinct heavy
film user groups in each of our businesses.''

<HEAD>Quarterly Profit Down 43 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALABASAS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lockheed Corp. said Tuesday its first
quarter profit plummeted 43 percent, due primarily to the
completion of a major Air Force cargo plane order and an increase
in its effective tax rate.
   Net earnings, which included discontinued operations, were $62
million, or $1.04 per share, compared with $114 million, or $1.84
per share, for the same period of 1988.
   Sales for the first quarter totaled $2 billion, down from
revenue of $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 1988.
   Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep said the downturn was in line
with company expectations noted in an April 4 reorganization
announcement.
   Tellep blamed the earnings decline primarily on completion of
the 50-plane C-5B cargo jet production program and an increase in
the effective tax rate.
   Adjustments of about $10 million for cost increases on two
aircraft modification programs and the timing of C-130 transport
deliveries also contributed to the downturn in revenues and program
profits, he said.
   The aerospace company delivered four C-130s in the first three
months of 1989 compared with 10 of the aircraft during the same
period a year ago. Tellep stressed that C-130 deliveries for all of
1989 were expected to be comparable to the 36 delivered last year.

<HEAD>Senate Defeats Effort to Scuttle Bush S&amp;L Bailout Financing</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 2nd graf to CORRECT Graham's home state</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Tuesday rejected an effort to
add the $50 billion taxpayer share of a savings and loan bailout to
the fiscal 1989 budget, a move that could have stuck President Bush
with the biggest federal deficit in history.
   On a 50-48 vote, the Senate rejected a move by Sen. Bob Graham,
D-Fla., to waive provisions of the 1985 Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction law in order to balloon this year's deficit to at least
$213.3 billion to pay for the bailout.
   Under the budget reduction law, waiving its provisions would
have required 60 votes.
   Graham said financing the bailout costs through direct
borrowings by the Treasury rather than through a complex
alternative off-budget scheme wanted by Bush would save taxpayers
$4.5 billion over 30 years or $150 million annually in lower
interest costs.
   ``We're the generation that created this horrendous problem,
that cut the cake at the party, but we're not the ones who are
going to pay for it,'' he said. ``Since we're transferring the
costs to our children and grandchildren, the least we can do is be
honest about it and try to lower the costs.''
   Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, questioned whether the savings through
Graham's effort would ever materialize, predicting the interest
costs on the entire federal debt could rise by as much $500 million
if it jumped by $50 billion at once.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and other administration
officials have repeatedly said they would recommend that Bush veto
any bailout package that tampered with his financing scheme.
   Citing estimates that the bailout's costs are growing by $500
million to $1 billion a month, Garn said, ``If we delay this bill
for a few months because of a fight over a veto, we've eaten up all
the savings'' in Graham's plan.
   The official estimate for the budget deficit for the current
fiscal year ending next Sept. 30 is $163.3 billion, or $27.3
billion over the $136 billion Gramm-Rudman target set in September
1987. But officials expect it to swell by several billion dollars
more if interest rates do not fall or if the economy slows down.
   Dumping the bailout costs into the budget would have swelled the
deficit to $213.3 billion, just $8.8 billion below the record
$221.1 billion in 1986 under President Reagan.
   Earlier Tuesday, the Senate gave voice vote approval to an
amendment by Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., to expand the Racketeering
Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act to include crimes against
S&amp;Ls, banks and other financial institutions and the federal
deposit insurance system.
   Senators who privately negotiated the S&amp;L rescue package with
the administration over the past two weeks beat back other efforts
to weaken Bush's control over the bailout.
   By 66-32, the Senate defeated an amendment by Sen. Bob Kerrey,
D-Neb., which would have substituted an independent board for one
dominated by Cabinet members to sell some $400 billion in real
estate the government is inheriting as a result of the S&amp;L crisis.
   The vote may have reflected senators' desire for an 11-day
recess as much as an endorsement of Bush's S&amp;L plan, which over the
next 30 years will cost a minimum of $260 billion, two-thirds of it
from taxpayers.
   ``I know how the herd instinct works around here,'' said Sen.
Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., who supported Kerrey's amendment. ``They can
smell that recess hour,'' he said of his fellow senators.
   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, repeated his threat to
call the Senate back in on Friday and next week, if necessary, if
the bailout package is not approved by Wednesday afternoon.
Otherwise, the Senate would not meet again until May 1.
   The 564-page bill was negotiated with the administration two
weeks ago largely through three behind-closed-door caucuses among
the 12 Democrats and nine Republicans on the Senate Banking
Committee.
   Similar legislation is being examined in the House, where the
banking committee is to begin acting on amendments next week.
   The Senate panel's chairman, Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., and
Garn, its ranking Republican, pleaded with members not to offer
amendments, saying it would upset the delicate balance of a complex
package.
   ``We simply cannot afford bickering and delays,'' said Garn,
citing estimates that the problem will continue to grow by $1
billion a month until the rescue package is put in place.
   However, senators not on the banking committee expressed
resentment at the efforts by its leaders to rush action on the bill.
   ``The banking committee is not the fountain of all wisdom,''
said Bumpers. ``To suggest that this document is sacred and every
word infallible ... (and) if the other 80 senators not on the
banking committee have no say, ... we may as well just go home
now.''
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., a committee member, said the
vote defeating Kerrey's amendment indicated other attempts to alter
the package also will be rejected, ``even ones that have some
merit.''
   ``Once you start making exceptions ... you run the risk of
losing the balance,'' he said.
   Kerrey's amendment would have established an independent
seven-member board to run the Resolution Trust Corp., a new agency
that will take control of all the assets or loans of failed S&amp;Ls
and the real estate that secured them. Revenues from the sale of
the real estate are to be used to reduce taxpayers' costs.
   Bush wanted the new agency to operate under a three-member board
made up of Brady, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   The Senate committee's compromise calls for a five-member board
that would include two members appointed from the private sector in
addition to Brady, Thornburgh and Greenspan.
   Because the board will have control over the greatest
concentration of land, buildings and real estate ever amassed in
the nation's history, Kerrey said the potential for a political
scandal is unprecedented.
   Other senators, however, said they want to have a board
controlled by Bush Cabinet members in order to be able to hold the
administration accountable if problems arise.
   ``Often independent boards outside the control of an
administration become captives of interests,'' said Sen. Paul
Sarbanes, D-Md.

   Two hotels in China are among six new and
eight converted hotels added to the Holiday Inn chain in the first
quarter of 1989, the chain's parent company announced Tuesday.
   The two hotels in the People's Republic of China, in Xian and
Chongging, give the company a total of five hotels in China,
Holiday Corp. said. Two more hotels are scheduled to open later
this year in Guangzhou and Dalian. Holiday Corp. expects to operate
a total of 20 hotels in China by 1995.
   The remaining four new hotels opened in Columbus, Ohio; Lima,
Ohio; Decatur, Ga.; and Cancun, Mexico.
   Of the eight hotels converted to Holiday Inns, six are in the
United States, one in Ratigen, Germany, and one in Leige, Belgium.
   Holiday Inn plans to add 50 hotels in 1989, with more than half
of those converted hotels. The chain is the world's largest hotel
operator, with 1,590 hotels in 51 countries.
