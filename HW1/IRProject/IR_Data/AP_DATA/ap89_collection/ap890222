<HEAD>Union Activists, Riot Troops Clash In Salvador</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas knocked out
power to 60 percent of the country Wednesday, authorities said, and
leftist unionists clashed with riot squads after an explosion
damaged a union hall.
   Utility officials said guerrilla attacks on electricity lines
caused widespread power outages early Wednesday that continued into
the night.
   Officials said on condition of anonymity that seven electricity
pylons carrying main power lines were toppled, cutting off power to
an estimated 60 percent of the country.
   They said power was not expected to be restored for two or three
days.
   Meanwhile, leftist unionists smashed windows, set fire to cars
and clashed with riot troops on Wednesday after a blast damaged a
union hall.
   About 200 union members marched through the city center carrying
firebombs and sticks after the blast caused extensive damage at the
National Federation of Salvadoran Workers hall.
   The bomb went off shortly before dawn and caused no injuries.
Police said they do not know who caused the blast, but union leaders
blamed armed forces and goverment agents.
   The marchers burned an estimated 10 vehicles. Treasury Police
fired assault rifles in the air when the marchers passed the offices
of the Labor Ministry. No injuries or arrests were reported.
   The unionists broke windows of several stores along their march
route. People not participating in the march looted some of the
stores.
   Riot squads followed the marchers back to the damaged union
headquarters and surrounded the building with troops and tanks. One
soldier threw a tear gas grenade at the demonstrators barricaded
behind sand-filled flour sacks.
   A military cordon around the union headquarters was lifted
Wednesday evening.
   On Tuesday, rebels attacked two major army bases, killing four
soldiers and three civilians.
   The level of violence and guerrilla attacks has increased as the
debate drags on over a rebel proposal to postpone until September
the presidential elections scheduled for March 19. The guerrillas
say they will recognize the elections if they are delayed.
   The rebels made their offer Jan. 24 and met Monday and Tuesday
with Salvadoran political party leaders in Mexico to discuss the
proposal.
   The U.S.-backed government has been strongly opposed to delaying
the elections.

   Foreign leaders streamed into Tokyo on Thursday for
the funeral of Emperor Hirohito, and authorities tightened security
even further because of threats of violence by radical groups.
   President Bush arrived at 1:05 p.m. (11:05 p.m. EST Wednesday) on
Air Force One at Haneda Airport and was greeted by Chief Cabinet
Secretary Keizo Obuchi and other Japanese officials.
   The president, First Lady Barbara Bush and Secretary of State
James A. Baker III moved quickly into a motorcade to embark on a
busy schedule with a long roster of foreign leaders who came to
attend the funeral on Friday. Bush was wearing a dark blue suit with
a red striped tie, and Mrs. Bush wore a black coat in the 45-degree
chill.
   An hour earlier, French President Francois Mitterrand arrived at
Haneda. Bush and the French leader planned to have lunch at the U.S.
ambassador's mansion in central Tokyo.
   Police said traffic on expressways was 50 percent below normal
Thursday morning and 20 to 30 percent lower than normal on city
streets because many drivers decided not to brave the heavy security
roadblocks.
   On Wednesday, a list of 71 arriving foreign leaders included King
Hussein of Jordan, King Juan Carlos of Spain and Indonesian
President Suharto. Dignitaries representing 163 countries will be on
hand for the state funeral for Hirohito, who died Jan. 7 at age 87.
   Bush has an ambitious agenda of a dozen brief meetings with other
leaders. Bush meets Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita Thursday, and
Mrs. Bush will take tea with Takeshita's wife, Naoko.
   Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, who have made daily visits
to join in a vigil in the chamber in the Imperial Palace where
Hirohito's coffin lies, will meet each of the visiting dignitaries
in audiences and functions scheduled through Tuesday.
   As part of the week's ``funeral diplomacy,'' Takeshita met
Wednesday with early arrivals, including Finnish President Mauno
Koivisto, Soviet Vice President Anatoly Lukyanov and President
Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire. He was scheduled to see 40
foreign dignitaries before Sunday.
   Japanese and Soviet officials, meanwhile, agreed to continue
meetings in March and May aimed at resolving the old dispute over
Soviet-held islands north of Japan.
   ``The talks were not on concrete issues and did not bear concrete
fruit ... but positive progress was made in the sense that both
sides agreed to continue meetings,'' said a senior Foreign Ministry
official, speaking on condition he not be identified.
   Japanese authorities, determined to prevent disruptions of this
unprecedented opportunity for diplomatic contacts, began strict
inspections of mail and cargo shipments.
   Security at the airports where foreign dignitaries were arriving
was tightened following the discovery Tuesday of timed projectile
launchers near the New Tokyo International Airport at Narita, 40
miles northeast of Tokyo.
   Police said the launchers apparently were set by radical groups
seeking to disrupt funeral events, but news reports said their
projectiles did not contain explosive charges. On Wednesday, 7,000
uniformed and plainclothes police were deployed in the area,
officials said.
   In all, 32,000 police will mobilized throughout the city on
Friday.
   Authorities conducted double-checks of baggage at airports. Cargo
and mail shipments were inspected and restricted, and some
commercial flights were been canceled to accommodate arriving
foreign delegations.
   Teams of 10 to 20 policemen manned vehicle checkpoints throughout
the city while others kept a constant surveillance over central
Tokyo and the routes to the airports. Some officers poked into
garbage set out at curbside and others searched roadside bushes.
   A powerful explosion Feb. 3 at Togo Shrine in central Tokyo,
believed to have been carried out by extremists, occurred in a
carefully patrolled area about a half-mile from the Shinjuku
Imperial Gardens, where the funeral will be held.
   Projectiles similar to those found at Narita were launched in
April 1986, apparently in an attempt to disrupt plans for
celebrating the 60th year of Hirohito's reign, and the following
month, when the leaders of seven major industralized democracies met
in Tokyo.

   A 41-year-old man who said he was tired of
being bullied shot his older brother to death with a replica of an
AK-47 assault rifle, police said.
   Paul M. Kacsmar was charged with criminal homicide in the death
of Francis Kacsmar, 46, and held in the Allegheny County Jail
without bond.
   Police said Paul Kacsmar called them Tuesday evening. When they
arrived, Kacsmar blurted out he had shot his brother because he was
tired of being bullied. The two men had shared a home in this
blue-collar community on Pittsburgh's southeastern border.
   Francis, shot four times in the chest, was found dead in the
living room when police arrived. A Valmet 62-S rifle, a replica of
the Soviet AK-47 military assault rifle, was discovered in the
kitchen, police said.
   Police found about 50 other guns in the house in addition to a
collection of military and weapons magazines and a collection of
miniature soldiers.

   A 13-year-old student pulled a loaded
pistol in a classroom and pointed it at his teacher, who had refused
to publish a photo of the boy wearing a T-shirt reading ``Anarchy
Now,'' officials said.
   As students scrambled for cover, 32-year-old Allen Eberhart
grappled with the youth and wrested the .357-caliber Magnum from him
Tuesday, said Los Angeles County sheriff's Deputy Gabe Ramirez.
   The youth, whose name was withheld because of his age, was booked
for investigation of assault with a deadly weapon and was taken to
Juvenile Hall, Ramirez said.
   The confrontation followed a prolonged dispute between the
teacher and student over publication of the youth's photograph in
the Rosemont Junior High School yearbook, Ramirez said. In the photo
the boy wears a T-shirt bearing the slogan ``Anarchy Now.''
   The student entered Eberhart's class to harangue the teacher, who
told the student to leave.
   The student instead told Eberhart to come closer, saying, ``I
want to show you something,'' Ramirez said.
   ``As Eberhart neared the student, the juvenile pulled a loaded
.357-caliber Magnum from his coat and pointed it at the teacher,''
Ramirez said.
   The gun belonged to the boy's parents, Ramirez said.

<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Rain Man'' took off at the weekend box
office on the strength of its eight Oscar nominations, but the
film's performance still wasn't good enough to top the
record-setting opening of ``The 'burbs.''
   Despite generally negative reviews, ``The 'burbs,'' a new comedy
starring Tom Hanks as a suburban homeowner bedeviled by peculiar
neighbors, collected $11.1 million in its first four days of release
to land in first place.
   Universal Pictures said it was the best opening weekend ever for
a film released in the first quarter.
   ``Rain Man,'' a study of a contriving car salesman who tries to
understand his autistic savant brother, finished second. Boosted by
a leading eight Academy Award nominations last Wednesday, including
best picture and best actor for Dustin Hoffman, ``Rain Man'' grossed
$6.7 million.
   With the holiday weekend running a day longer than the previous
weekend, ``Rain Man's'' take was up a robust 47 percent.
   In third place was ``Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure,'' a new
comedy about two teen-age time travelers, with receipts of $6.2
million. It was followed in fourth by ``Three Fugitives,'' featuring
Nick Nolte and Martin Short as crooks on the run, which collected
$4.6 million.
   In fifth place was the slimy sequel ``The Fly II,'' starring Eric
Stoltz as the son of a mutated scientist, on ticket sales of $4.3
million.``Beaches,'' a melodrama starring Bette Midler and Barbara
Hershey, grossed $3.7 million to finish in sixth place.
   Just behind it was ``Cousins,'' the English-language remake of
France's ``Cousin, Cousine,'' with a gate of $3.5 million.
   Rounding out the top 10 were the corporate success comedy
``Working Girl,'' in eighth with $2.72 million; ``Dangerous
Liaisons,'' the tale of power-hungry seducers in pre-revolutionary
France, in ninth with $2.717 million; and the new drama ``True
Believer,'' featuring James Woods as a crusading lawyer, in 10th
with $2.6 million.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations Co., with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.
   1. ``The 'burbs,'' Universal, $11.1 million, 1,951 screens,
$5,690 per screen, $11.1 million, one week.
   2. ``Rain Man,'' United Artists, $6.7 million, 1,590 screens,

<HEAD>`Diff'rent Strokes' Star Pleads Innocent to Armed Robbery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COMPTON, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Diff'rent Strokes'' star Todd Bridges,
already jailed on an attempted murder charge, pleaded innocent to
armed robbery in another case involving an alleged confrontation
with his car repairman.
   Bridges entered the plea Tuesday in Los Angeles County Municipal
Court and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for March 23. The
actor remained in jail without bail on an attempted murder charge
filed in another case.
   The latest charge stems from a Jan. 23 incident in which he
allegedly pulled a gun and took his BMW automobile from a repairman
without paying the nearly $500 repair charge.
   ``The person we believe to be Bridges took his car to the place
to be repaired and, instead of paying, took the car away at
gunpoint,'' said Deputy District Attorney Patti Ryan.
   Bridges, who played Willis Jackson on TV's ``Diff'rent Strokes,''
has pleaded innocent to charges he shot Kenneth Clay five times at
an inner-city drug den on Feb. 3. Clay survived and identified
Bridges as the attacker.
   The charges against the actor are the latest in a string of
brushes with the law.
   Last year, he pleaded no contest to a charge of making bomb
threats against an auto customizer he hired to work on his Porsche.
The actor was given a suspended sentence of one year in jail.
   In 1983, Bridges paid a $240 fine for carrying a concealed
firearm, and last year he was convicted of reckless driving.

   Right-wing extremists killed 25
people in West Germany during the past 10 years and injured scores
of others, a government agency says in a new report.
   The Constitutional Protection Office, a division of the Interior
Ministry, says in the report released Tuesday that there are about
25,000 such extremists in the country, of which between 450 and 500
are violent extremists.
   The report says right-wing extremists committed more than 1,200
violent crimes from 1983 to 1987, including 29 terrorist acts. The
crimes included bombings, personal attacks and destruction of Jewish
landmarks and property.
   The Constitutional Protection Office said the worst right-wing
terrorist attack occurred in 1980 during Munich's Octoberfest
celebrations, when a bomb blast killed 13 people.

   Sketches of some of the places that President Bush will be
visiting during his trip to three Asian capitals, beginning today:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>TOKYO</NOTE>
<NOTE>The Okura Hotel</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Bush will spend two nights in the hotel, most likely in the
Imperial Suite used by then President Reagan during the 1986
economic summit. The hilltop site of the 27-year-old hotel was owned
by the noble Okura family, which had run one of the big pre-war
industrial combines called zaibatsu.
   The 888-room hotel, across the street from the U.S. Embassy and
ambassador's residence, just finished a three-year refurbishment
last September. The management says the U.S. delegation is taking
about 400 of the Okura's rooms, and 13 other foreign delegations to
the funeral of Emperor Hirohito also will be housed there.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Akasaka Palace</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The palace, where Hirohito spent part of his young manhood and
early married life before he ascended the throne in 1926, was
completed in 1909 to be the crown prince's residence, and was such a
grand building that the Meiji Emperor (1868-1912) was said to be
unwilling to visit it.
   Modeled on the palace at Versailles and the Louvre, Akasaka
Palace is a grand example of architecture in the late Meiji period
when Japan, then emerging in a rush from feudal isolation, was
trying to outdo the West. Most of the building materials and
furnishings were imported.
   The palace, which sits in its own large park, was restored in the
1970s and now is used as a guesthouse for foreign dignitaries and to
hold major conferences, such as the 1986 economic summit. Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita will host a reception there following the
Hirohito funeral.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>The Imperial Palace</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The main ceremonial building within the moated, 284-acre palace
grounds in the center of Tokyo, the Imperial Palace was built in
1968 to replace a structure lost in a World War II firestorm caused
by U.S. bombing.
   The palace grounds include ponds, moats and forests as well as
administrative buildings and the Fukiage Mansion where Hirohito
lived through his final illness.
   The moats, walls and some structures date from the 17th century,
when the whole complex was called Edo Castle, the fortified
headquarters of the Tokugawa Shogunate that then ruled Japan from
Edo, the old name of Tokyo.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Shinjuku Imperial Gardens</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The site of the Hirohito funeral services, the park once served
as the garden for the imperial household. In mid-April, it becomes
one of the favorite places in Tokyo for people to picnic under what
seem to be clouds of cherry blossoms.
   A sanctuary has been constructed for the funeral, as well as two
tents 482 feet long to shelter 10,000 Japanese and foreign
dignitaries from the February weather.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>BEIJING</NOTE>
<NOTE>Great Hall</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   This cavernous, Soviet-style hall of beige-colored stone was
built in less than a year for the celebration of the communist
government's 10-year anniversary in 1959. It sits on the west side
of Beijing's broad Tienanmen Square in the traditional heart of the
city, and is the site for all major gatherings, including Communist
Party conferences and legislative sessions.
   Bush, like other state visitors, will come here for his official
red-carpet greeting, including cannon volleys and gifts of flowers
from small children who jump up and down and shout in sing-song,
``Warm welcome.''
   The president also will be toasted by China's top leaders at a
Great Hall banquet. The central banquet hall, with a two-story-high
ceiling, can sit 5,000 people and often does. But it is a long way
from the basement kitchen, and food often arrives cold.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Zhongnanhai</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Meaning ``the Central and South Seas,'' Zhongnanhai is a 213-acre
compound embracing two large lakes that used to be part of the
imperial palace grounds. It now serves as Communist Party
headquarters, and many visiting leaders, including Bush, are taken
behind its well-guarded vermillion walls to meet with party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang.
   In the past, many top leaders also lived in Zhongnanhai, although
the current leaders are believed to live most of the time in their
own homes. A small portion of Zhongnanhai is open to Chinese
tourists as a park, but remains closed to foreigners.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Chongwenmen Christian Church</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Bush is expected to attend services at this Protestant church
hidden behind high stone walls along a narrow hutong, or alley. The
stone church built by missionaries with a round, dark-wood vaulted
ceiling usually is filled to capacity on Sundays with about 1,500
people, making it one of the largest of Beijing's six Protestant
churches.
   It was being used as a factory when Bush lived in Beijing as the
U.S. envoy. Like all other churches and temples, its religous
functions were halted during the radical leftist Cultural Revolution
of 1966-76, when religion was banned. It reopened as a church in
1983.
   During the ban on religion, however, the pastor, the Rev. Kan
Xueqing, was ordered by the government to hold Sunday services for
the small foreign community. The Bushes attended, and in 1975 Kan
baptized their daughter, Dorothy, then 16.

<NOTE>Diaoyutai State Guesthouse</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese antiques, a king-sized bed, gold-plated plumbing and an
electric massage chair are among the accommodations awaiting Bush in
this elegant, high-security government hotel.
   Diaoyutai, ``the fishing terrace'' covering 100 acres of park,
served as a retreat for emperors more than 800 years ago. The
communist government built guest villas there in 1959 to accommodate
the many foreign leaders visiting on the 10th anniversary of the
communist takeover.

<NOTE>The Blue House</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The house and its auxiliary facilities have been used as the
nation's presidential residence since the first Republic of Korea
was formed in 1948, and is now the home of President Roh Tae-woo.
   Built in 1927 by Japanese colonial rulers, the big two-story
granite structure derives its name from its tiled roofs, which are
painted blue. It is on a mountainside north of the city center, near
the remaining royal palaces of the Chosun Dynasty kings, who ruled
Korea for five centuries. The U.S. military administration used the
Blue House as its headquarters for three years after Korea was
divided in 1945.

<NOTE>The National Assembly</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The National Assembly building, home of South Korea's unicameral
legislative body, is a domed six-story structure surrounded by
granite columns said to symbolize the harmony of diverse opinions of
the Korean people.
   The assembly building was constructed in 1975 on an island in the
Han River, which runs through the capital city. Bush made a speech
at the National Assembly during his visit in April 1982 as vice
president.

   The garrison is headquarters for the Combined Forces Command, the
U.S. Forces Korea, the U.S. 8th Army and the United Nations Command,
and serves as operational control center for the 42,000 U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.
   Located on 714 acres south of central Seoul, the garrison was
used as the Japanese Imperial Army headquarters until after World
War II. It has 20.4 miles of paved roads, 1,225 buildings and homes
for more than 6,000 families and military personnel. There are
stores, theaters, schools, a hospital, fire station and power plants
_ a city within a city.

   Ara Dunomalyan's large, sad eyes took on
a gleam and he suppressed a proud grin as he toddled along the
corridor of Yerevan's orthopedic center, showing off his mobility
with an artificial leg and a cane.
   The 4-year-old has triumphed over tragedy, learning to walk and
smile again after the Dec. 7 earthquake that crushed his left leg
and took the lives of his mother and brother.
   The innocence of childhood has allowed him to forget the horror
of the day it rained concrete in his native town of Spitak. But the
Armenian and West German adults who have nursed him through trauma
have longer memories and more fragile hearts.
   Eyes welled up with tears among the circle of grownup spectators
when the motherless tot completed his performance for visiting
foreigners by slipping a downy arm around the neck of a reporter who
stooped to watch at his eye level, brushing her cheek with a kiss.
   ``Children forget pain more easily than adults,'' the child's
grandfather, Mikhail Dunomalyan, said as Ara hobbled off behind a
brigade of wheelchairs bearing legless children through an obstacle
course of nurses and technicians.
   The orthopedic center on a hill overlooking the smog-shrouded
Armenian capital has been helped by a prosthesis workshop set up by
the West German Red Cross.
   Orthopedic technician Kristof Blum of Saarbruecken works in the
room filled with child-sized rubber hands, plastic knee joints,
artificial feet and connecting braces that slap visitors in the face
with the reality and breadth of the suffering inflicted by the
disaster.
   Blum and a half-dozen Armenian assistants put in long days in the
laboratory custom-making prostheses and working through the list of
amputees that lengthens daily as word of the clinic's work spreads
through the distant, backward villages hit hardest by the earthquake.
   A despondent Spitak father approached a visiting Red Cross
inspection team Monday to inquire if his crippled 15-year-old
daughter could be sent back with them to West Germany for treatment.
   ``This happens every day, people wanting to send their children
abroad for the same treatment we've worked to provide here,'' Blum
said. ``They all want what is best for their children and they
believe that it lies far away. But what they fail to understand is
the need for the family to be close by to help during the recovery
period. Sometimes a mother or father is all these children have
left.''
   The clinic's hallways and stairwells are crowded with idle and
homeless relatives of the patients brought here from makeshift
hospitals set up in the earthquake zone to treat the more than
31,000 injured.
   Relief efforts in the 10 weeks since the disaster have
concentrated on the immediate tasks of medical care and food supply,
and the provision of new housing for the estimated 100,000 left
homeless will take at least two years.
   The relatives of those hospitalized spend their days caring for
the patients and their nights in tent cities and temporary shelters.
   ``Ara's ready to go home now, but he has no home to go to,'' said
Ilya Osepyan, director of the 250-bed orthopedic clinic that has
treated thousands of victims.
   ``We are trying to arrange temporary shelter for those who have
recovered at a children's sanatorium, but the adults have to be
accommodated, too,'' the doctor said.
   Blum has fitted more than 30 children with artificial limbs since
he arrived a month ago, as well as 50 adults. More than 300 people
are awaiting prostheses, and the clinic expects to fulfill that need
within six months.
   ``The children's prostheses must be replaced as they grow, so we
expect to keep volunteers here for at least two years, or until a
local staff can be trained to take over the work,'' Blum said.
   The prosthesis center is one of several projects taken on by the
West German Red Cross under the loosely organized disaster recovery
plan being developed by the Soviet government.
   Worldwide donations that generated a record foreign contribution
for disaster relief have slowed to a trickle, but international Red
Cross societies and church organizations have collected hundreds of
millions of dollars for long-term relief and are negotiating with
Moscow and Yerevan authorities over how the money can best be spent.
   The West German Red Cross has built a field hospital in the city
of Stepanavan, where 80 percent of the buildings were destroyed, and
plans to reconstruct the village of Kursali, near Spitak, with the
help of volunteers from the Soviet republic of Estonia.
   ``The tears have dried and everyone will eventually be treated,''
Osepyan told the West Germans who toured the prosthesis workshop and
recovery wards. ``But it will take years to bring Armenia back to a
state that could be considered normal.''

   The governor offered on Tuesday to lead
negotiations aimed at ending a two-day walkout at state-run General
Hospital that had National Guardsmen in combat fatigues caring for
hundreds of patients.
   Gov. Edward D. DiPrete made the offer to Joseph G. Fargnoli,
president of the union representing the hospital's nurses and
attendants, as the two met privately for about an hour, said Nanci
Martin, DiPrete's spokeswoman.
   ``The governor's going to hold a meeting at 10 a.m. tomorrow in
his office for both sides,'' Martin said. Previous negotiations have
seen DiPrete's aides shuttling between both sides, but this meeting
would be face to face, she said.
   Fargnoli made no commitment to DiPrete that the workers would
return, Martin said. Fargnoli still had to report to the union's
executive committee, which would decide on further action, union
spokesman Henry Griggs said.
   Earlier Tuesday, a judge gave the strikers 24 hours to end their
walkout, the second job action in three weeks in a dispute over
staffing. Superior Court Judge Antonio S. Almeida granted the
state's request for a back-to-work order, citing a risk of
``irreparable harm'' to patients.
   DiPrete called out the National Guard on Sunday for the second
time in three weeks after a walkout by scores of workers over
staffing levels. Talks broke down Friday.
   State officials had warned that patients' lives were threatened,
and hospital administrator James P. Benedict said he was ready to
``empty out entire units.''
   The governor visited the hospital and said he was willing to keep
the Guard on duty ``as long as they need people here.'' He said he
was satisfied with the patient care.
   Sixty-eight Guardsmen, including seven with nursing training,
were at the hospital, Benedict said. About 40 were working at the
neighboring Institute of Mental Health, where union workers also
failed to show, said a Guard spokesman.
   Guardsmen spent much of their time bathing and feeding patients
at the 480-bed hospital, which serves primarily chronically ill
patients needing long-term care.
   The guardsmen are paid an average of $60 per day, said Capt. John
Loughlin, a Guard spokesman.
   A four-day sickout by union members ended Jan. 31 when DiPrete
called out the Guard.
   The workers are angry at what they claim is the state's failure
to fill vacancies. The state, in an effort to cut overtime costs,
has refused in many cases to bring in additional workers to replace
employees who call in sick.
   ``Staffing is the prerogative of management,'' DiPrete said.
``We're on the threshold of what will be a milestone of philosophy
of who operates the hospital.''
   Benedict said 16 acute-care patients had been moved to other
hospitals, and six more would be shipped out. About 410 patients
were at the hospital.
   ``I'll be contacting more facilities than I've contacted already
in hopes of appealing to them to take patients more rapidly for
us,'' the hospital director said. ``We could begin to empty out
entire units, if need be.''
   Thirty-two of 85 normally scheduled attendants were on duty for
the morning and afternoon shift. Twenty-four of 32 nurses were on
duty for the morning shift and 20 for the afternoon shift. Some
workers had been held over from previous shifts.
   ``Any emergency can happen at any time, so I feel the patients'
lives are in danger,'' said hospital medical director Dr. Rajnikant
Shah. He said half the patients were in medical danger.

<TEXT>
   AFL-CIO leaders offered praise for Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole after their first meeting despite
disagreements on proposals to raise the minimum wage and expand
child care and parental leave opportunities.
   ``I'm sure that there will be some areas where we disagree and
will pursue our best efforts in the Congress but I have a high
regard for the secretary of labor, for Secretary Dole,'' federation
president Lane Kirkland said Tuesday after the second day of the
AFL-CIO's annual meeting.
   For her part, Mrs. Dole emerged from the meeting with the labor
group's Executive Council with a promise that she would open her
door to organized labor _ something union leaders say was missing
during the Reagan administration.
   Nonetheless, there were several evident disagreements between the
positions of the administration and labor, particularly over whether
legislation to increase the minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.65 an hour
should contain a provision allowing for a lower training wage for
youths.
   Mrs. Dole said Bush's support hinged on inclusion of the training
wage, something labor leaders fervently oppose.
   The two sides agreed to work together on an issue Mrs. Dole
raised _ studying ways to establish ``portable'' pension systems so
workers who change jobs frequently because of the changing economy
can amass a retirement fund.
   Neither side offered specifics of how such a program would work,
but Kirkland thanked Mrs. Dole for raising the issue and said labor
would offer its ideas to her.
   Mrs. Dole also promised a thorough review of a proposal, released
by the department before she took office, to lift a nearly
50-year-old ban on industrial homework in the women's apparel
industry. But she said she was reluctant to even consider
re-establishing several similar bans in the garment industry that
were lifted during the Reagan years, a request the Executive Council
had made on Monday.
   Whether the cordial relationship between labor and the Bush
administration lasts could be determined in the next 10 days, when
Bush likely will decide whether to name an emergency board to
intervene in stalled negotiations between Eastern Airlines and 9,000
members of the International Association of Machinists.
   The machinists are scheduled to strike March 4 but the AFL-CIO
has asked Bush to intervene, a move that would automatically push
back the strike deadline 60 days.
   Mrs. Dole said Bush was awaiting advice from the Labor and
Transportation departments before making a decision.

   The movie ``Rain Man,'' about the relationship that
develops between an autistic man and his self-seeking brother, won
the Golden Bear top prize for a full-length film at the annual
Berlin Film Festival.
   Dustin Hoffman received a special Golden Bear for his performance.
   The film, which also stars Tom Cruise, was directed by Barry
Levinson and has been nominated for eight Academy awards in the
United States.
   The festival jury of 11 judges, chaired by the former head of the
Paris and Hamburg Operas, Rolf Liebermann, awarded the Golden Bear
for the best short film to ``Pas a Deux'' by director Gerrit van
Dijk of the Netherlands.
   In addition to the Golden Bear awards, seven Silver Bear prizes
were awarded Tuesday as the 12-day festival ended.
   Other U.S. performances receiving prizes at the festival included
a Silver Bear for Gene Hackman for his staring role in ``Mississippi
Burning,'' a film about racially motivated murder 25 years ago; and
Eric Bogosian for his work in ``Talk Radio,'' about an ambitious
late-night talk show host who takes advantage of listeners.
   The Silver Bear for best director was won by Czechoslovak Dusan
Hanak for his 9-year-old film ``I Love, You Love,'' which was banned
by Communist authorities in his homeland until last year.
   Chinese director Wu Ziniu was awarded a special Silver Bear prize
for his entry entitled ``Wan Zhnong'' or ``Evening Bells,'' which
recounts a last-ditch attempt by Japanese troops to escape capture
at the end of World War II.
   French star Isabelle Adjani received a Silver Bear for her role
in ``Camille Claudel.''

   The first Bible printed in America, in the
language of the Algonquin Indians, sold Tuesday for $330,000 at a
Christie's auction.
   The volume, bound in black morocco leather and ornately
gilt-tooled, is the finest known copy of 220 Bibles printed in
Cambridge, Mass., in 1661 and 1663. The edition was translated by
John Eliot into the language of the Algonquin Indians who lived in
the town of Natick, Mass.
   Of the 220 copies, 200 were bound in sheep or calf hide for the
Indians and the remaining 20 were presented to King Charles II of
England.
   The Eliot Bible belonged to the Estelle Doheny Collection from
St. John's Seminary in Camarillo, Calif. and was sold on behalf of
the Archdiocese of Los Angeles to New York dealer Glenn Horowitz,
according to Christie's spokeswoman Gloria Harris.
   Christie's has sold more than 2,000 lots worth $33 million from
the 15,000-volume collection owned by the archdiocese, including 220
on Tuesday. On Wednesday, 207 other lots are to be auctioned,
featuring the autographs of four signers of the Declaration of
Independence.
   The autograph of signer Button Gwinnett of Georgia is contained
in a letter dated July 12, 1776, and estimated to be worth up to
$250,000.
   The Doheny collection comprises a library of rare books and
manuscripts, including early printed books, Bibles, illuminated
manuscripts, English and American first editions and fine bindings.

<HEAD>Production Of Classic Rocking Chair To Stop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Brumby Rocker, a classic chair on
Southern porches for nearly a century and a fixture in Jimmy
Carter's White House, will rock into history when production ends
later this month.
   Carole Melson, who revived manufacture of the high-backed,
cane-seated rocker in 1972, said supplies of air-dried oak boards
needed for the rocker have dwindled in the past two years. Nearly
all commercially available hardwood is kiln-dried.
   So even though there are customers for the chairs, which cost
$745 to $845, she decided to stop production at the end of the month.
   ``I'm fighting a losing battle here,'' Mrs. Melson said. ``I
don't want to substitute. It's better to retire it than to mess it
up.''
   The chair, one of the oldest unchanged products still made in
Georgia, has been called a Southern icon. Jimmy Carter took a Brumby
to the White House with him when he was president.
   Lt. Gov. Zell Miller, who has a Brumby in his office, said the
decision to stop making them was ``a shame.''
   ``I wish I had more than one,'' he said. ``It's one reason that I
stay so mellow and in such good humor.''
   Donald C. Peirce, decorative arts curator at the Atlanta High
Museum of Art, which has a Brumby in its furniture collection, said
Mrs. Melson ``was sort of reviving a craft tradition. It's sad to
see something like that no longer available.''
   The Brumby Chair Co. started as a barrel-making operation shortly
after the Civil War, Mrs. Melson said. The first rocker likely was
built by 1875, and the design was put into production around 1890,
she said.
   At its peak, the company employed hundreds of workers at its
Marietta plant and produced thousands of rockers a day. The company
closed during World War II, she said.
   Mrs. Melson said she discovered an old Brumby in the 1960s when
she was looking for a comfortable chair in which to rock her
children to sleep.
   ``I had to rock them by the hour,'' she said.
   She and her husband, Frank, were so taken with the chair that
they decided to bring it back and make it under license from the
family-owned Brumby Chair Co., which existed only on paper.
   Her husband died shortly before the couple's Rocker Shop in
Marietta opened in 1972.

<HEAD>Judicial Order From Relative Keeps Navajo Nation Under MacDonald</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Navajo tribal judge Tuesday barred
the ruling council of the country's largest Indian nation from
ousting its chairman _ his brother-in-law _ who has been accused in
congressional testimony of corruption.
   The Tribal Council had tried to place Chairman Peter MacDonald
and his associate, Vice Chairman Johnny Thompson, on administrative
leave. As a result of the judge's action, Thompson apparently became
temporary chairman of the council's winter meeting, which had tried
to choose different leaders to preside over the battle over
MacDonald's fate.
   Tribal District Judge Harry Brown, MacDonald's brother-in-law,
issued the temporary restraining order, said Geoffrey Standing Bear,
MacDonald's attorney. Brown scheduled a hearing for Friday to
determine whether to permanently halt the council's decision to
place MacDonald and Thompson on paid leave, Standing Bear said.
   Brown found that the council failed to follow the correct
procedure for removing a chairman from office last Friday night,
when it voted 49-13 against MacDonald and Thompson, Standing Bear
said.
   ``The chairman is entitled to his constitutional rights,'' he
added.
   Standing Bear would not answer questions about why he went to a
judge in Kayenta, about 140 miles by indirect roads from the tribal
capital, when he could have sought the order in any district court.
   He acknowledged that MacDonald and Brown are married to sisters,
and said Brown expected to be overruled by another judge because of
the conflict.
   Council members nevertheless were advised by Navajo Attorney
General Michael Upshaw to ``obey the order of the court.'' Upshaw
refused to comment further, but said he would answer written
questions from the council on the legality of further procedures.
   After Brown's order was read, chairman-designate Marshall Plummer
stood up, Thompson sat down, and Plummer squatted at the right of
Thompson's chair.
   The subtle transfer of power was indicated by Thompson's
remaining seated, said councilman Leonard Haskie of Tohachi, N.M.
   ``Marshall Plummer stepped aside out of respect for the court and
only did that because of the court order,'' Haskie said. ``We plan
to consult with our attorneys on our next course of action, because
the Navajo Nation cannot continue at a standstill.''
   MacDonald was in Window Rock but did not attend the meeting, his
staff said.
   A U.S. Senate committee heard testimony earlier this month that
MacDonald took kickbacks and gifts, particularly in a deal in which
a Phoenix oilman made $7.2 million profit from the sale of the Big
Boquillas Ranch to the tribe.

   Mildred Burke, a 20-year women's world
wrestling champion who attributed her success to her muscular build
and her alligator clutch hold, died Saturday. She was 73.
   Ms. Burke, who was 5-foot-2, 138 pounds in her wrestling prime,
had such a well-muscled build that the Police Department once
displayed her poster in its offices to shame its officers into
staying in shape.
   Ms. Burke, wrestling champion from 1936 to 1956, claimed to have
invented the alligator clutch, a pinning maneuver in which the
opponent is twisted into something resembling a pretzel.
   She was listed in ``Ripley's Believe It or Not'' for doing 100

editor. In her later years she operated a wrestling school in Encino.

   Placido Domingo joined other classical performers
in a concert at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday to benefit the
Soviet-Armenian Earthquake Relief Fund of the American Red Cross,
and organizers said $350,000 was raised.
   The superstar tenor kept busy through the evening, singing,
playing piano, introducing the other artists and conducting the
audience for the ensemble sections of the finale, the drinking song
from ``La Traviata.''
   ``It's probably the first concert ever organized in 10 days. It's
probably the last,'' said James D. Wolfensohn, chairman of the
Carnegie Hall board, as he announced that the event had raised
$350,000. ``There are no parties; there is no dinner. All the money
goes to Armenia.''
   Soprano Aprile Millo got the evening's standing ovation, after
singing Dvorak's ``Ode to the Moon'' from ``Rusalka.'' Mezzo-soprano
Elena Obraztsova, who flew from Moscow just for the concert, was
called back for an encore and won the audience's hearts with a soft
Russian song.
   Domingo played piano and sang while Mstislav Rostropovich played
cello in Massenet's ``Elegy.'' Domingo also sang an ``Otello'' love
duet with newcomer soprano Kallen Esperian.
   Paata Burchuladze, who has the true Russian bass sound, sang from
``The Barber of Seville'' and Mussorgsky's amusing ``The Flea.''
Samuel Ramey showed that an American bass can be great, too, with an
aria from Verdi's ``Attila'' and Kern's ``Old Man River.'' American
mezzo, Frederica von Stade, also sang.
   The evening included instrumentalists, highlighted by
Rostropovich's exquisitely played ``Sonata in G minor for Cello and
Piano'' by Rachmaninoff. Pianists were Alexander Toradze and
Vladimir Viardo. Violinist Vadim Repin, 17, flew from Moscow to play
Wienlawski's ``Fantaisie Brilliante,'' a piece which exhibited his
virtuosity.
   Loris Tjeknavorian conducted an ensemble from the American
Symphony in his own ``Armenian Elegy.'' Accompanying pianists were
Eugene Kohn, Mason G. Senft, Samuel Sanders and Irina Vinogradova.

   Comedian Robin Williams found a new use
for the brass pudding pot traditionally given to the Hasty Pudding
Theatricals' Man of the Year.
   ``The country's only a trillion dollars in debt. Please help,''
the 1989 award recipient said as he passed the pot around at a
Harvard University news conference Tuesday.
   Williams wore a rainbow-colored brassiere and wig and shared a
stage with female impersonators Tuesday as he accepted the prize,
which recognizes a ``lasting and impressive contribution to the
world of entertainment.''
   ``I'll put it on the shelf,'' he promised.
   Hasty Pudding, the nation's oldest undergraduate dramatic
organization, gave an identical brass pot and its Woman of the Year
Award to actress Kathleen Turner last week.
   Williams received his award before the curtain went up on the
Hasty Pudding's 141st annual musical farce, a spoof on Prohibition
called ``Whiskey Business.'' As always, the show has an all-male
cast, including many students dressed as women.
   Since gaining fame as Mork in the television series ``Mork &amp;
Mindy,'' Williams has gone on to success in films including ``The
World According to Garp'' and ``Moscow on the Hudson.'' His
portrayal of Adrian Cronauer, the comic disc jockey in ``Good
Morning, Vietnam,'' earned him a Golden Globe best-actor award and
an Academy Award nomination in 1987.
   His latest movie, ``The Dead Poets Society,'' is scheduled for
release in June. Williams said he portrays a teacher of English
literature in a private boys' school in 1959, a role with ``some
humor, more drama.''

Hall of History Tuesday, the Rev. Val Peter jokingly presented him
with the Academy Award given to Spencer Tracy for his role as Father
Flanagan in the 1938 movie ``Boys Town.''
   ``Here's the Academy Award right here,'' said Peter, Boys Town's
executive director. ``I'd like to present this to you this morning
for this magnificent performance.''
   Boys Town Mayor Corey Randle gave Scott a giant cookie and a
plaque making him an honorary resident. Scott surprised Randle by
giving him a kiss.

   Fred Rogers says he's baffled by the slick look
and frantic pace of many shows outside his television
``neighborhood.''
   ``All I know is that I'm offering myself as I am and as I do.
What I'm creaing is not something false to me,'' the host of ``Mr.
Rogers' Neighborhood'' said in an interview in the March issue of
Parents magazine. ``And there must be those who feel that their
truth is in this kind of mayhem.''
   Rogers says honesty is what he aims to give the children who
watch his program.
   ``That's what I long for them to have _ as many honest adults in
their lives as possible,'' he said.
   ``What I believe, and hope comes through on the program, is that
each person is unique, that each person is valuable, and that each
of us longs to be loved.''

   Carly Simon says her stage fright makes the
prospect of appearing at the Academy Award ceremonies scary, so
she's figured out a better way to claim her Oscar if she wins the
award for best song.
   ``I intend to have a look-alike,'' Simon said Tuesday on ABC's
``Good Morning America'' program. ``If they think it's the real me,
that's even better. Only my hairdresser will know for sure.''
   Simon has been nominated for the song ``Let the River Run,'' from
the film ``Working Girl.''
   The singer-songwriter said she didn't know who would perform the
song at the award ceremonies March 29. ``I haven't been approached
about that,'' she said.

   Col. Fred Gregory says he found it easier to
navigate the heavens aboard the space shuttle than to make a 20-mile
drive to a rural school in central Louisiana.
   ``Buckeye is just not on anybody's map,'' Gregory said,
apologizing for arriving at the town from Alexandria 53 minutes
late. ``I went around the Earth every 90 minutes. I was driving
longer than that today.''
   Gregory, 48, who piloted the space shuttle Challenger on a 1985
mission and is scheduled to command a classified shuttle flight in
August, spoke Monday at Buckeye Elementary School, one of several
schools in the state he is visiting.
   The 10-year astronaut said he was looking forward to his next
flight.
   ``It's a DOD (Department of Defense) mission so I can't tell you
anything about it, but we're going to have a great time,'' he said.

   Former San Diego Chargers running back Chuck
Muncie was sentenced to 2{ years in federal prison for perjury and
dealing cocaine after a judge ignored pleas for leniency from
Muncie's ex-coach, Don Coryell.
   ``The only way you're going to get the message in this case is if
you go to jail,'' U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving told Muncie
on Tuesday.
   Defense attorney Cindy Aaron submitted eight letters, including
one from Coryell, the former Chargers coach, supporting a request
that Muncie be released to undergo drug rehabilitation.
   ``I'm more than willing to get my life back in order,'' said
Muncie, 35.
   Irving gave Muncie 18 months in prison for his Dec. 12 guilty
plea to dealing 2 ounces of cocaine to an undercover federal agent.
The judge added another year for perjury for Muncie's claiming under
oath Jan. 5 that he hadn't used cocaine since 1985. He tested
positive for the drug afterward.
   Irving told Muncie he had lied to federal probation officers, his
attorney and to the court. That ``simply can't be tolerated,'' the
judge said.

   Koch joined Culture Commissioner Mary Campbell Tuesday in
presenting the citywide campaign, ``New York and the Arts: A

   ``Much of New York's cultural life remains invisible,'' said
Campbell. ``Our young people are assaulted every day with what's
wrong with this city ... we have to spread the good news.''
   ``New York is Dance,'' ``New York is Heritage,'' ``New York is

theatre, music, art, museums and gardens and zoos.
   Fifteen thousand posters will line the walls of subways, bus
stations, airports and other gateways to the ``cultural capital of
the world.''
   The 30-by-46-inch posters, financed by Philip Morris Companies
Inc., are part of a campaign that includes advertising in print,
radio and television, and recruiting multilingual students to guide
the city's annual 17 million visitors. The $500,000 campaign is

<HEAD>Salvadoran Rebels Offer To Lay Down Arms If Military Cuts Made</HEAD>

to meet with rebels on the offer. Picks up 7th pvs, `Reports from ...'

   El Salvador's leftist rebels offered
Tuesday to lay down their weapons if the military is sharply cut,
the police force reorganized and next month's presidential elections
postponed by at least four months.
   The rebels proposed the compromise during a meeting with
representatives with Salvadoran political parties, who said they
would see President Jose Napoleon Duarte on Wednesday and asked him
to meet with rebels on the offer.
   It was the first time the rebels had offered to lay down their
arms. Last month, they offered for the first time to participate in
national elections.
   Delegates of the 13 political parties issued a declaration
Tuesday night saying they were committed to consider the offer of
the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front ``and to offer
our contribution in whatever is necessary to the peace process as
long as the government ... accepts the possibility of realizing the
contents of the proposal.''
   The parties had met for two days to discuss how to end a
nine-year civil war that has claimed 70,000 lives.
   The front's offer attempted to address a major stumbling block in
the talks _ the constitutional requirement that Duarte leave office
by June 1 _ by proposing an interim president.
   There was no immediate response from the government.
   The rebel proposal appears aimed at neutralizing El Salvador's
rightist-dominated military, which has warned publicly it might
seize power in a coup if Duarte does not step down as scheduled.
   ``I would say in general that the government has to talk now that
they cannnot refuse or evade direct talks with the FMLN,'' said
Ruben Zamora of the the leftist Democratic Convergence, a coalition
of six small parties.
   The offer was made as guerrillas in El Salvador attacked the
country's principal army base and an engineering detachment, leaving
eight dead and 17 injured.
   Reports from San Salvador said the rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, was standing firm against postponing
the March 19 vote, which it is favored to win, but deputy chairman
Jose Francisco Merino Lopez said the party would not tip its hand.
   The Arena and guerrilla representatives met for talks Tuesday
morning but both groups refused to disclose details.
   At an afternoon news conference, one Arena delegate, Jose
Francisco Guerrero, called the guerrilla attitude ``sincere'' but
would not say whether the party favored or rejected postponement of
the election.
   ``Peace is very distant but the distance is not so great,'' said
Guerrero. ``With the cooperation of the FMLN and ours we can achieve
peace in the short term.''
   Guillermo Ungo, presidential candidate of the Democratic
Convergence, told reporters here the new guerrilla proposal was ``a
very important change that would give us a better chance for peace.''
   But Ungo said he did not see any possibility of achieving
concrete results. The rebels themselves appeared pessimistic about
the prospects of their offer.
   ``For reactionaries such as Arena it would seem that the meeting
with the FMLN is more an opportunity for dilatory maneuvers than the
mature response that the people demand for a viable means of
pointing the country toward peace,'' they said in a Tuesday
broadcast on the clandestine Radio Venceremos.
   ``Rejection of the proposal will mean the war will not only
continue, but will escalate,'' the radio said.
   Essentially, the guerrilla front reduced its original request for
a postponement by two months. In January, the front asked for a
six-month postponement after a cease-fire goes into force.
   The FMLN broadened the scope of the talks here with its call for
a cease-fire, for cutting the armed forces from its current strength
of about 56,000 to its 1978 level of 12,000, and for a merging of
three police forces into a single force.
   The proposal also called for members of death squads be brought
to justice. Many slayings have been attributed to death squads
allegedly linked to Arena, a charge Arena denies.
   Both sides at the talks here have acknowledged that even if they
reach an accord, they would still confront the problem of pursuading
the military and the government to go along.
   A text of the proposal, distributed here and in San Salvador,
called for the establishment of three multiparty commissions to
negotiate an end to the fighting, rewrite the country's election
laws and setting up international verification of the entire peace
process.
   The front proposed a March 19 deadline for the commissions to end
their work. It suggested the national legislature choose an
independent provisional president to rule the country after June 1,
when the constitution says Duarte must leave office.
   ``As one way around the constitutional issue on elections, the
FMLN proposes the Legislative Assembly name an independent as
provisional president with the agreement of the political parties
and the explicit stipulation that his term runs until the
elections,'' the guerrilla proposal said.
   The other major party represented at this mountain resort about
40 miles southeast of Mexico City are the incumbent Christian
Democrats, running second in polls. The Democratic Convergence is
running a weak third.

   A 57-year-old man who admitted setting up bogus
federal programs to entice young children to participate in
so-called scientific experiments was convicted of 12 counts of
sexually abusing children.
   An Allegheny County jury deliberated 5{ hours Tuesday before
deciding Eugene Allen of suburban Wilkinsburg was guilty of all
charges, including sexual abuse of children, indecent assault and
corrupting the morals of a minor.
   Allen, a traveling salesman who dropped out of high school,
photographed two children, aged 8 and 9, while catheterizing them
and using a self-invented device called a kidney machine on them.
   He claimed his research and experiments with the device, which he
had advertised as federally sponsored, were legitimate efforts to
detect kidney failure in children.
   Dr. Norman T. Welford, former deputy director for the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration, testified the machine, which was heated up
when in use, would have ``cooked'' the children if it had operated
as Allen intended.
   Allen's experiments on the children were filmed in his basement
and at a cottage in rural Cochranton.
   Testifying in his own defense Tuesday, Allen said he videotaped
and photographed hundreds of encounters with children and stored the
tapes under floorboards in his house ``for my own sexual pleasure.''
   He said he thought about seeking medical help, but ``was too
embarrassed.''
   Allen faces 55 to 111 years in jail.

   An armed man who attacked an
Irish Republican Army funeral egged on a crowd of mourners who
chased him through the cemetery and he killed one pursuer with a
grenade, witnesses testified.
   The witnesses said Tuesday that Michael Stone, 33, chatted
casually with three young women before launching his gun and grenade
attack last March on mourners gathered around the graveside of three
IRA members killed by British commandos in Gibraltar.
   Stone has pleaded innocent to 38 terrorism charges stemming from
11 incidents dating back to November 1984.
   In the Milltown Cemetery rampage, three people were killed and
dozens injured before Stone was captured by the crowd.
   One of Stone's pursuers, 20-year-old Thomas McErlean, was fatally
wounded by a grenade Stone threw, witnesses said.
   Stone, a Protestant, denies belonging to any of the outlawed
organizations involved in sectarian attacks on Northern Ireland's
Roman Catholic minority.
   Prosecutor Ronnie Appleton said on the opening day of the trial
Monday that when police told him he had killed at least two people,
Stone allegedly replied: ``Brilliant. I am game for anything.''
   The IRA is fighting to drive the British out of Northern Ireland
and unite the mostly Protestant province with the Catholic Republic
of Ireland under a leftist administration.

   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos told a House
panel he knew neither his exact budget nor how he would pay for
President Bush's $441 million in new education programs, prompting
one lawmaker to complain of deception by the White House.
   Initially, education officials said the $441 million for Bush's
new programs would come on top of former President Reagan's proposed
$21.9 billion education budget for fiscal 1990. But Cavazos backed
off that Tuesday during an appearance before the House
Appropriations subcommittee on labor, health and human resources and
education.
   ``The only thing that we have today that is solid is the $21.9
billion,'' Cavazos told subcommittee chairman William Natcher, D-Ky.
Cavazos added there would be ``no set number'' until after
negotiations with Congress were completed.
   The administration testimony prompted Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., to
complain:
   ``All the critical decisions have been postponed to a later date
in order to pretend that a process is moving forward when in fact it
is not. There is a very important deception going on here.''
   Democrats are becoming increasingly irritated over Bush's failure
to specify spending cuts to comply with deficit reduction
requirements. Instead Bush sent Congress a series of initiatives,
including the 10 education programs costing $441 million, and said
cuts would be negotiated later with Congress.
   Bush, in presenting a $1.16 trillion budget, has said cuts must
come from a pool of discretionary programs worth $136 billion in the
current budget. By freezing that figure for 1990, budget makers will
have to trim $10 billion to $11 billion in what would have been
normal growth in the programs.
   Many of them are educational programs.
   ``I can understand why you might be chafing a little bit about
the numbers,'' deputy education undersecretary Charles Kolb told
members of the panel. ``But ambiguity is inherent in this process.''
   ``I think the president has made it absolutely clear as to where
his priorities lie in terms of education,'' Kolb said.
   ``Well, he may have made it clear to you, but let me tell you
something, I have no idea where this money is supposed to come
from,'' Obey interrupted.
   ``It is certainly legitimate to question whether ... those are in
fact real initiatives or public relations initiatives which might
become real at a later date only if other spending cuts can be found
in your department,'' Obey said.
   Reagan recommended that 24 programs be eliminated and the
resulting $750 million in savings be shifted to several large
programs serving the disadvantaged. Cavazos embraced that plan as
well as Bush's new programs, most of them stemming from campaign
promises.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is
defending U.S. booksellers that have pulled ``The Satanic Verses''
from their shelves, saying they may have ``well-founded fears'' in
the face of Iranian death threats.
   Baker said Tuesday that the United States has a responsibility to
speak out against Iran's threats, but he refused to criticize the
U.S. corporations and bookstores that now refuse to sell the book.
   The book is viewed by many Moslems as blasphemous. While author
Salman Rushdie has said he did not intend to insult fellow Moslems,
Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has refused to accept the
apology and has ordered the writer killed.
   Baker's restrained comments contrasted with the heated
denunciations of terrorism issued repeatedly by former Secretary of
State George Shultz.
   Baker discussed the book controversy during testimony before the
House Foreign Affairs Committee. Several congressmen were far more
critical of the U.S. booksellers that have pulled the book in
response to the Iranian threats.
   Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said that while the bookstore
companies may have ``legitimate concerns,'' he argued that they are
setting a dangerous precedent.
   ``American publishers and book distributors are at this moment on
the front lines of defending our fundamental freedoms to speak and
to publish. It appears to me that they have done a grave national
disservice,'' Torricelli said.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., asserted that ``spineless American
bookchains'' are ``trembling before these terrorist threats of the
Ayatollah.''
   Some of the nation's largest chains, such as B. Dalton and Barnes
&amp; Noble, took ``The Satanic Verses'' off the shelves, but they
refuse to say whether they will continue to sell the book.
WaldenBooks has removed the book from shelves, but will continue to
sell it upon request.
   ``I'm not sure it's our job to sit here in judgment on those
people,'' ``We have spoken out. We will continue to do so. We will
continue to work quietly with our allies with respect to issues of
terrorism, and state-sponsored terrorism like this,'' Baker told the
committee.
   ``I do think it's incumbent upon us as a government to continue
to pursue a policy that rules out concessions to terrorists. But it
seems to me that concessions to terrorists may be different than
well-founded fears on the part of private citizens about their own
welfare and safety.''
   President Bush said Tuesday that such bookstore owners should be
given ``the protection of the law.''
   Bush condemned Iran's death decree against the British novelist
as ``deeply offensive to the norm of civilized behavior'' and warned
that Tehran would be held accountable for any actions against
American interests.

<HEAD>National Peace Garden Design Competition Expected to Attract 2,000</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Organizers predict more than 2,000 entries for
design of a National Peace Garden _ a monument dreamed up by a
California teacher, approved by Congress and signed into law by
former President Reagan.
   The competition, open to any U.S. citizen or resident alien,
offers a $20,000 prize for the selected design, with up to 12 other
prizes.
   The $4 million to $6 million cost is to be covered by public
contributions and private grants that organizers hope to raise. They
have so far collected about $150,000 in grants and are beginning an
appeal for public contributions.
   Washington architect Paul Spreiregen, professional adviser for
the competition, said the monument is intended to stand ``as a
simple, universal, and beautiful reminder that peace _ the absence
of war and the personal freedom to develop the talents with which we
each are created _ is our highest priority.''
   Spreiregen directed competition for the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial, which attracted a record 1,422 entries and has become
Washington's most-visited monument.
   Christine Cestello, competition project manager, said project
offices in Berkeley, Calif., and Washington already have received
more than 500 inquiries about the competition. She said organizers
hope to get about 5,000 designers registered and more than 2,000
entries.
   Ms. Cestello said designs for the garden can use small or large
plants, trees, waterways, structures, sculptures or anything the
designer considers appropriate for expressing the national goal of
peace.
   The site, southeast of the Jefferson Memorial on Hains Point at
the confluence of the Potomac and Anacostia rivers, is essentially
clear except for a sculpture called ``The Awakening,'' which Ms.
Cestello said is on loan from the artist and will be moved. The
sculpture depicts a giant-sized human form coming out of the earth.
   The National Park Service designated the site for the memorial
last July.
   The project was envisioned by California teacher Elizabeth
Ratcliff, who pushed for congressional approval and is president and
founder of the National Peace Garden Project.
   ``I just looked around and saw all the great monuments to the
past and all the wars we've been involved in,'' Mrs. Ratcliff said.
``It just suddenly came into my mind that what we needed in our
capital is a living monument to peace.''
   Eight judges will select the winners. They include an art museum
director, a sculptor, two landscape architects, two architects, and
two authors.
   In addition to the winning entry, judges will award $10,000 for
second place, $5,000 for third place and up to 10 honorable mention
awards of $500 each. Entrants have until May 31 to register and Aug.
31 to submit designs. The law says construction is to begin by June
30, 1992.

<TEXT>
   President Bush is making his sixth visit to
China this week. On previous trips, he found the streets dusty, the
architecture reminiscent of Hollywood and the Chinese inattentive to
his desires to see high officialdom.
   He also concluded that his guest room probably was bugged.
   In ``Looking Forward,'' the pre-election autobiography he wrote
with journalist Victor Gold in 1987, Bush recalled some diplomatic
code words from his first visit to China. He wrote that when an
official said it was ``not convenient'' to meet with him, that meant
he ``would see the official when hell freezes over.''
   If it was ``possible, but might take a while,'' it might be five
to 20 years.
   On this visit, of course, Chinese officials will find it both
convenient and possible to meet with the American president who
first went to Beijing as U.S. diplomatic envoy in the fall of 1974
and served 16 months.
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, paid an unofficial return visit in
1977.
   Then, in a 1980 trip as presidential candidate Ronald Reagan's
running mate, he tried, not very successfully, to ease Chinese
anxieties over Reagan's policy of close ties with the government on
Taiwan.
   In 1982, Bush visited again as President Reagan's vice president
and Chinese officials said their meetings gave new momentum to
stalemated talks on Chinese objections to U.S. arms sales to the
Taiwanese.
   In 1985, back in Beijing on another presidential mission, he
found the Chinese still irritated by American support for Taiwan,
but responded that the administration was reducing its arms sales to
the Nationalist Chinese.
   Today, the issues are different, and Bush told reporters at a
Jan. 27 news conference that ``on a nostalgic basis, needless to say
... Barbara and I are looking forward in a very personal way to
going back to Beijing.''
   The president in his book had an observation on the security
afforded a visiting American official.
   He had 15 security officers with him on his 1985 visit and is
expected to be accompanied by a full Secret Service contingent when
he arrives this time. In 1974, however, he questioned whether
visiting Secretary of State Henry Kissinger needed all the
bodyguards he brought with him.
   ``I stopped counting after half a dozen,'' he said. ``The number
did seem excessive in a country so tightly controlled that the
American secretary of state's security was virtually guaranteed by
his hosts.''
   He also found the Chinese capital dusty.
   ``For all Beijing's historic grandeur, a month there had reminded
Barbara and me of life on East Seventh Street in Odessa, Texas, in
1948,'' he wrote in his account of the Kissinger visit. ``Like
Odessa, the Chinese capital lies in the center of a great plain.
Unpaved side streets make for limited visibility when the wind kicks
up.''
   There was also a suggestion that the Chinese had bugged the guest
house where Bush stayed during the Kissinger visit.
   According to Bush's account, his wife finished addressing an
envelope, then looked around for some way to affix a glueless
Chinese stamp to it and commented, ``Everything's here but the
glue.''
   Bush said that he and John Holdridge, his deputy chief of
mission, were the only other people in the room. But the next day
there was a bottle of glue on the desk.
   He also recalled being taken with Kissinger on a visit to the
nearby city of Suzhou and driven down an empty boulevard while he
saw ``masses of people huddled on side streets, held back by
barricades ... an eerie, even frightening demonstration of how a
totalitarian government can control its population.''
   Bush found the U.S. diplomatic compound in Beijing ``reminiscent
of Southern California architecture in the 1920s: Sunset Boulevard _
one part Spanish, one part Oriental.''
   The envoy was provided by the U.S. government with a Chrysler
sedan, but he and Mrs. Bush took up a mode of transportation more
common among the Beijing Chinese. They rode bicycles.
   The minister who baptized the Bush's 16-year-old daughter,
Dorothy, in 1975 still serves as pastor of Chongwenmen Christian
Church, where Bush may attend services during his two-day visit.

   Experts inside the Internal Revenue Service are
recommending a thorough overhaul of the 150 separate civil penalties
that can be imposed on people who make tax mistakes.
   Although the proposals have not been approved by the IRS or
higher federal agencies, most of the suggestions have been endorsed
by IRS Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs. He says the present
crazy-quilt penalty system is difficult for taxpayers to understand
and the IRS to enforce.
   ``While the merit of each individual penalty can be defended,
when taken together they sometimes produce unintended results and
have a combined impact that can be too severe,'' Gibbs said Tuesday
in presenting an IRS task force report on penalties to a House Ways
and Means subcommittee.
   If taxpayers do not understand why they are being penalized, he
said, compliance with the tax laws can suffer.
   When the 1954 tax overhaul was enacted, there were only 14 civil
penalties. Most taxpayers will never encounter the bulk of today's
150 penalties, which are used to punish behavior ranging from
defacing a stamp on a liquor bottle to fraudulently failing to
report income.
   The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
recommended that Congress streamline IRS penalty procedures but take
its time creating new penalties.
   ``Now that the interest paid by individual taxpayers is no longer
(fully) deductible while the interest received from the government
is fully taxable, it does not seem that this differential is
necessary, logical or fair,'' said Arthur S. Hoffman, chairman of
the organization's tax division. ``It is a major irritant to many
taxpayers and is generally perceived as patently inequitable.''
   Chief Judge Arthur L. Nims III of the U.S. Tax Court asked
Congress to increase the penalty that the court may impose on
taxpayers who file frivolous tax suits. Raising the $5,000 penalty
would discourage tax-shelter suits, he said. He also recommended the
court be permitted to penalize lawyers who draw such suits.
   Gibbs said that if the IRS task-force report should become law,
it would result in considerably fewer separate penalties. As for
simplification, he promised only that the new system would not be
more difficult to comprehend than the present one.
   A typical low- or middle-income taxpayer is likely to encounter
only three or four of the 150 penalties. For example, failing to
file a return or to pay taxes owed can result in a penalty. A filing
error caused by negligence can bring another. Fraud can mean still
another.
   In 1986, the IRS imposed 22.9 million penalties for $6.9 billion,
but 49 percent of the dollar amount was wiped out, usually as a
result of negotiations with taxpayers.
   For the IRS, the biggest problem is with informational returns,
such as the requirement that employers and financial institutions
file reports of wages or interest paid. About 6 million payers send
the IRS 1 billion documents. Failing to include the correct Social
Security number or filing the documents late can result in a penalty
on the payer of $50 per document.
   The group also proposed that a person who is entitled to a refund
be subject to a $100 penalty for failing to file a return.
Apparently, many taxpayers in that category now do not file. Gibbs
said the absence of a penalty results in expenditure of IRS
resources to secure a return and inhibits an audit to determine the
person's claim.

<HEAD>Farm Exports Employ Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly a million Americans depend on the export
of farm goods for their jobs, according to an Agriculture Department
study.
   In calendar 1987, an estimated 903,000 jobs were generated by
U.S. agricutural exports valued at $28.6 billion. More than a third
of the nation's harvested cropland was used to produce for foreign
buyers.
   William Edmondson of the department's Economic Research Service
said farmers and their workers accounted for about 380,000 of the
jobs linked to exports. The other 523,000 were outside the farm
sector but were directly or indirectly related to the processing and
distribution of farm exports.
   Edmondson, whose analysis was prepared for the March issue of
Farmline magazine, said the total business activity created by farm
exports far exceeds the actual sales.
   By his reckoning, each dollar received from agricultural exports
in 1987 stimulated another $1.65 of output in the U.S. economy.
   ``For example,'' the report said, ``farmers buy machinery and
chemicals to produce exported crops. Cattle producers buy feed to
produce exported animal products. And farm products need to be
processed, packaged and transported to their destinations.''
   As a result, the nearly $29 billion in agricultural exports in
1987 was said to fuel an additional $47.2 billion in supporting
activities.
   ``This additional economic activity included $7.2 billion in the
farm sector, $3.7 billion in the food processing sector, $15.2
billion in other manufacturing sectors, $5.8 billion in trade and
transportation, and $15.3 billion in other services,'' the report
said.
   Farm exports have long been regarded as a major force in the U.S.
economy, ranging far beyond the fields and granaries of farmers
themselves. In the early 1980s, when exports were considerably
larger, the impact was even greater.
   ``In the peak year of 1981, when $43.3 billion worth of exports
were sold, export-related employment was estimated at 1.2 million,
about a third higher than the 1987 figure,'' the report said. ``U.S.
farm exports fell by about a third between 1981 and 1986.''

   The Agriculture Department says the U.S. wheat
stockpile will be whittled down this spring to one of the smallest
inventories since the end of World War II.
   By June 1, the beginning of the 1989-90 wheat marketing year, the
inventory may be about 534 million bushels, the smallest since the
mid-1970s, the department's Economic Research Service said Tuesday.
That would be less than half of the June 1, 1988, carryover of 1.26
billion bushels.
   Measured against total use, the June 1 wheat reserve of 534
million bushels would be about 21 percent of the 2.56 billion
bushels consumed domestically and exported in 1988-89, the lowest
stocks-to-use ratio since the 17 percent of 1973-74.
   ``Prior to that, the last time the stocks-to-use ratio was below
20 percent was at the end of World War II,'' the report said.
   The average farm price of wheat in the 1988-89 marketing year is
forecast to range from $3.65 to $3.80 per bushel, more than $1 above
last season.
   In the early 1970s, the Soviet Union bought huge amounts of U.S.
wheat, which helped drain off the stockpile. By the end of the
1973-74 marketing year, the wheat reserve was down to 340.1 million
bushels, compared with total needs that year of 1.97 billion bushels.
   Drought cut into the 1988 wheat harvest, and there has been brisk
export demand the past couple of years.
   Plantings of winter wheat last fall for the 1989 harvest were up
sharply, but the crop has been hurt by dry conditions in large areas
of the Great Plains.
   ``The increase is attributed to higher wheat prices and the
lowering of (federal program) acreage reduction requirements from
27.5 percent to 10 percent,'' the report said.
   Winter wheat accounts for about three-fourths of total U.S. wheat
production, with the remainder coming from spring-planted crops. The
report said, ``Plantings of the 1989 spring wheat and durum crops in
coming months are also expected to be up sharply.''

   Production of farm-grown catfish in January was
an estimated 26.9 million pounds, up 4 percent from a year ago,
according to a monthly report by the Agriculture Department.
   Prices paid to growers averaged 78 cents per pound, up 10 cents
from January 1988, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board
said Tuesday. The January price received by processors for dressed,
whole fish averaged $1.61 per pound for ice pack and $1.72 for
frozen fish.
   Imports of freshwater catfish during December, the most recent
month listed, totaled 182,000 pounds, down sharply from 464,000
pounds a year earlier, the report said. Seventy-seven percent of the
imports were from Brazil.

<HEAD>Experts See Split Decision in Adult Bookstore Case</HEAD>

   A Supreme Court ruling permitting states to use
anti-racketeering laws against adult bookstores could have a silver
lining for supporters of freedom of expression, says an expert on
First Amendment issues.
   ``I'm quite encouraged,'' said Bruce Ennis, a lawyer who has
argued many high court cases involving freedom of speech and freedom
of the press.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, said states may use
anti-racketeering laws to crack down on adult bookstores.
   But they also barred states from employing such tough
crime-fighting statutes to shut down the stores before trials are
held to determine whether any of the material sold is obscene.
   Left unanswered is whether the anti-racketeering laws permit
confiscation of bookstore inventories _ including non-pornographic
material _ after there is a judgment that the stores sold obscene
items.
   Ennis said he is heartened that the three dissenters Tuesday
would prohibit such post-trial seizures. He said he is confident at
least two other justices would join in barring such blanket
confiscation of property when the high court addresses that issue.
   ``I think we'll pick up at least two votes,'' he said.
   But law enforcement officials said Tuesday's court ruling
upholding an Indiana anti-racketeering statute is a big victory for
them.
   ``We won the war,'' said Stephen M. Sims, an Indiana prosecutor
who conceded that bookstore owners won some ``sub-battles.''
   Indiana Attorney General Linley E. Pearson said, ``I think the
real reason that you have the crackdown in these kinds of cases is
because the people do not want adult bookstores in their
neighborhood.''
   The law that was upheld Tuesday, Indiana's Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), is patterned after a federal
statute aimed primarily at organized crime. Most states have similar
anti-racketeering laws, and in 19 states besides Indiana the law can
be used to battle pornography.
   A presidential commission on pornography, appointed during Ronald
Reagan's administration, urged all states to take similar steps to
limit the spread of sexually explicit material.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens said the
Indiana law violates freedom of expression by allowing authorities
to seize the contents of a bookstore and padlock its doors after a
trial in which two books, films or magazines sold there have been
judged obscene.
   The law arms ``prosecutors not with scalpels to excise obscene
portions of an adult bookstore's inventory but with sickles to mow
down the entire undesired use,'' Stevens said.
   Noting that the court's majority did not decide whether
post-trial seizures of property are constitutional, he said the
justices should have resolved that issue by ruling that such
confiscation of property in obscenity cases is unlawful.
   Stevens was joined by Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall.
   Indiana's RICO law provides for up to eight years in prison and a
$10,000 fine for each offense.
   A second related law provides civil penalties that permit
authorities to seize property owned by anyone convicted of a RICO
offense.
   The justices were unanimous Tuesday in ruling that such property
seizures may not take place before trial.
   Indiana authorities said the 19 other states with
anti-racketeering laws that apply to obscenity are Arizona,
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia,
Hawaii, Idaho, New Jersey, North Dakota, New York, North Carolina,
Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin.
   The Indiana law was challenged by Fort Wayne Bookstores Inc. One
of its stores was shut down in March 1984. Law enforcement officials
padlocked it and seized its inventory.
   Tuesday's ruling allows the state to proceed with a trial against
the bookstore owners, even though the pre-trial seizure of the
property was overturned.
   In other action, the court:
   _Refused to kill a $90 million lawsuit against television
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart and others filed by Marvin Gorman, a
defrocked evangelist Swaggart had accused of adultery in 1986.
   _Allowed Kentucky to begin enforcing a 1986 abortion law as
altered by a federal judge last year. The law requires girls under
the age of 18 to notify their parents or obtain a judge's consent
before having an abortion.
   _Ruled, by a 6-3 vote in a Texas case, that states may not give
preferential treatment to religious publications by exempting them
from taxes imposed on other books, magazines and newspapers.

<HEAD>National GOP Ready to Censure Duke</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Republican officials are prepared to
denounce Klansman-turned-Republican state lawmaker David Duke with a
resolution likely to be approved by the party's executive committee
on Friday.
   At the direction of party chairman Lee Atwater and the apparent
concurrence of President Bush, a resolution was drawn up Tuesday
declaring that while Duke may be a registered Republican ``he is not
a Republican in gesture, deed or belief.''
   In Louisiana, where Duke won election to the state legislature,
the Republican reception was more accommodating.
   ``I don't understand what Lee Atwater is talking about,'' said
GOP state Rep. Art Sour. ``Censure him for what? The only control we
have over him is what he's done since he's been a Republican.''
   ``We will see if Mr. Duke is what he says he is or what the media
says he is,'' added state Rep. Peppi Bruneau, GOP caucus chairman.
``If he's what he says he is, he has no problem. He got to the House
the same way everybody else did.''
   The Louisiana legislature is convening for a special session, and
there is a challenge to seating Duke. But members of both parties
predicted that the move would fail and that he would become one of
18 Republicans in the 105-member chamber.
   At the national party headquarters, an anti-Duke resolution
already was ready for adoption by the party's executive council on
Friday.
   The resolution declared that ``the Republican National Committee
and the Republican Party reject and condemn David Duke, his beliefs
and the hate and fear he promotes.''
   In addition, the resolution declares that ``Duke will not be
considered a member of the Republican Party and will not receive any
aid or assistance of any kind whatsoever from the Republican
National Committee. Duke may be a Republican in party registration
but he is not a Republican in gesture, deed or belief.''
   Citing Duke's former roles as grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan
and founder of the National Association for the Advancement of White
People, the resolution said, ``Duke and these groups preach
doctrines of racial, religious and ethnic hatred, bigotry and
discrimination against American citizens which are abhorrent to the
American tradition and have no place in the Republican Party.''
   Duke, 38, defeated home builder John Treen, 63, in Saturday's
election for a seat in the Louisiana House despite endorsements for
Treen by Bush, former President Reagan and the most powerful
political figures in the suburban New Orleans area. Both candidates
were registered Republicans.
   Duke has scoffed at threats to deny him national Republican Party
money, saying he never received any during his successful
legislative campaign. He also has said he is ``as much a
Republican'' as anyone.
   At a news conference Tuesday, Bush conceded his endorsement of
Duke's opponent might have been viewed by Louisiana voters as
``improper or overkill.''
   But, the president said, ``I did what I did because of
principle.'' He said Duke's record ``is one of racism and bigotry.''
   Atwater, who last week severely criticized Duke, said Tuesday
that he now wants to avoid getting into a public debate with the
former Klan leader.
   ``It plays right into his hands. What he wants is to get into a
prolonged argument with me on television, any other kind of media.
   ``He's a very effective demagogue and I'm not going to give him
an opportunity to do that any more.''

   A bomb ripped through City Hall,
injuring nine people and damaging about 40 percent of the
three-story building, police said. One person was critically injured.
   No one claimed responsibility for Tuesday night's attack and
police said they did not have any suspects.
   Police said the blast destroyed the city's computer, treasury and
finance departments. Mayor Rodimiro Zelaya estimated the damage at
$1.2 million.
   Eight of the injured were women and the ninth, indentified as
Ivan Cabrera, was hospitalized in grave condition, police said.
   City Hall worker Gloria Cruz, who received minor injuries, told
reporters ``I saw an explosion... and later I was in the hospital. I
don't remember anything that happened.''
   It was the third bombing since Saturday in Honduras, which has
experienced an increase in violence this year.
   A bomb exploded Monday night one floor below offices of the
Department of the Interior. No injuries were reported.
   On Saturday, a crudely made explosive device thrown at the rear
of a bus carring U.S. servicemen north of Tegucigalpa injuring three
soldiers and two Honduran civilians.
   No one has claimed responsibility for either attack.
   Last month, three prominent figures were killed in or near the
capital.
   Nicaraguan Contra rebel commander Manuel Rugama was shot to death
by unidentified assailants as he drove alone on a road just outside
Tegucigalpa and Carlos Diaz Lorenzana, attorney for alleged Honduran
drug trafficker Juan Ramon Matta, was gunned down in his home.
   Former Honduran Armed Forces Gustavo Alvarez Martinez was fatally
shot by an unidentified group of gunmen outside his home on Jan. 25.

<HEAD>Secretary of State Says Peace Plan Lacks Incentives for Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III says the
peace plan drafted by Central American presidents is a good
beginning but lacks deadlines or any means of enforcing compliance
if Nicaragua reneges.
   But a key Democratic senator says the plan issued last week by
the presidents of El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and
Nicaragua stands on its own merits and will proceed with or without
the United States.
   Baker told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday the
peace plan is flawed because it fails to account for what he said is
Nicaragua's record of broken promises, specifically pledges to
permit free elections and a free press and to liberate political
prisoners.
   He said any participation by the Sandinista government in a new
peace agreement should be monitored ``with the best verification we
can get, because the promises have been made more than once and
broken more than once.''
   A ``carrot-and-stick'' approach _ with the imposition of specific
deadlines _ is needed to spur the Sandinistas to keep their word,
Baker said.
   ``What is lacking is a mechanism for enforcement to translate
these principles into reality,'' he said. ``We need to establish
timelines for performance. And we have to develop incentives and
disincentives to improve the prospects for such compliance in the
first place.''
   Baker called again for the end to partisan battling in Congress
over Central American policy and aid to anti-Sandinista Contra
forces, now located in camps along Honduras' border with Nicaragua.
   But Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations subcommittee on the western hemisphere, said Baker
appeared to be treating the five-nation accord ``in a backhanded
fashion.''
   ``When I hear statements that this is not a satisfactory plan, I
get the feeling we think the plan doesn't go into effect unless we
say it's OK,'' he said. ``This plan is not contingent on anything.
This plan goes forward whether we like it or not.''
   Dodd said, however, that if Nicaragua makes substantial progress
toward meeting its promises of democratization in the coming weeks,
Congress will convert future aid for the Contra rebels into
relocation assistance, rather than humanitarian supplies to maintain
them as a military force in their border camps.
   Baker said the decision by the Central American presidents to
address the future of the Contras and their Honduran camps
themselves and to make a specific proposal within 90 days leaves the
situation vague.
   The proposal cannot be judged ``until you know what the plan
is,'' he said.
   ``But we will not abandon the democratic resistance as we give
diplomacy a chance,'' Baker said.
   Turning to El Salvador, Baker said he believes the United States
lacks ``the luxury not to recognize any government that emerges''
from upcoming elections there, even if those elections are won by
the rightist Arena party.
   He also said while there has been significant improvement in
respect for civil rights in El Salvador over the last eight years,
``there has been some recent regression,'' including murders
possibly committed by uniformed members of the armed forces

   The rocket was found by a cleaning worker and dismantled shortly

   Next to the rocket a leaflet was found reading ``Manuel Rodriguez
Front, National Patriotic War. Free Motherland or Death.''
   The Manuel Rodriguez Front is the main leftist urban guerrilla
band fighting the government of military President Augusto Pinochet.
   The rocket was aimed at the Diego Portales Building, which houses
the four-man military junta that Pinochet leads.
   It was not immediately known whether any of the four were in the

<TEXT>
   Suffolk County, New York state and the Town
of Southampton withheld information from the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission and should be dismissed from licensing proceedings for
the Shoreham power plant, say lawyers for the Long Island Lighting
Co.
   ``The issue before this commission ultimately is who is in charge
here,'' said Donald P. Irwin, a lawyer for LILCO, which owns
Shoreham.
   Irwin argued Tuesday that the state and local governments
deliberately defied the licensing board in an attempt to keep the
Shoreham case in a legal morass that has lasted for 3{ years.
   But a lawyer for Suffolk, Herbert Brown, said the county did not
show ``bad faith'' when officials refused to speculate before a
licensing panel what they would do in the event of an accident at
the Shoreham plant.
   Because the county has no evacuation plan, they could not say
what they would do, he reasoned.
   The NRC is considering whether to dismiss the state and local
governments from the Shoreham licensing proceedings. NRC spokesman
Frank Ingram said he did not know when a decision might come.
   If the state and local governments are dismissed, theoretically
no objections would remain to licensing Shoreham.

   The nation should react to the greenhouse
effect on global warming by using natural gas instead of coal and by
developing ``safe and publicly acceptable'' nuclear power, a House
panel was told.
   Robert M. White, president of the National Academy of
Engineering, said Tuesday these are among measures needed to prevent
further build-up of greenhouse gases that could be responsible for
global warming.
   White and three other witnesses cautioned that scientists still
do not know whether burning of fossil fuels and other human
activities will cause significant temperature changes, leading to
heat waves and drought.
   One witness, University of Virginia professor Patrick J.
Michaels, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee it would be
more prudent to await more study before making drastic policy
decisions.
   ``Our policy should be commensurate with the state of our
scientific knowledge,'' the professor of environmental sciences told
the energy and power subcommittee.
   Michaels said climate experts have a ``clouded vision'' of future
global warming, and added, ``basing sweeping environmental policy''
on such uncertainties ``is especially risky, even if the policy is
otherwise rational.''

<NOTE>GAO Says Agency Officials Ordered Changes in Report on Spotted Owl</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional report says Fish and Wildlife
Service officials ordered a changes in a report in an effort to keep
the spotted owl off the endangered list.
   The General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress, said officials
ignored scientific evidence and ordered revisions in a study
prepared by biologists in the agency's Northwest regional office.
Scientists had concluded that unless logging was slowed in ancient
forests of the Northwest, the owl could face extinction.
   The timber industry in the Northwest has opposed any effort to
name the owl a threatened or endangered species, fearing that such a
move would disrupt logging in public forests. Environmentalists have
advocated protecting the owl as part of their campaign to halt
logging of old growth forests.
   ``While changes are an inevitable part of any draft report review
process, the nature of the changes made in this case and the way
they were made raise questions about whether objectivity was
maintained,'' the GAO said.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service, an Interior Department agency
which determines what should be designated for protection as
threatened or endangered, is required to consider only ``biological
factors'' in making its decision.

group, guided the Bulgarian guests to a bar in the other direction.
   Upstairs in the club, normally ``reserved for hotel guests
only,'' the bartender also appeared a bit confused by the news
conferences the free trade union movement holds after its nearly
daily talks with authorities on restoring Solidarity's legal status
and ending Poland's acute economic crisis.
   ``It's really interesting to listen, but it's bad for business.
These journalists have to work and they don't drink,'' said
Kazimierz Krajewski.
   Solidarity has had no offices in Warsaw since it was crushed in a
December 1981 military crackdown and subsequently outlawed.
   So it had to ask the government to find a place for it to hold
news conferences during the so-called round-table talks that began
Feb. 6.
   Authorities first offered Solidarity offices at nearby Warsaw
University, but the rooms were too small and there were not enough
telephones.
   Finally, the government-backed Patriotic Movement for National
Rebirth, a national unity organization, rented rooms for the
opposition in the Europejski.
   ``It's a great improvisation,'' said Kazimierz Woycicki,
organizer of the press office.
   Dozens of union activists have pitched in to run the press
service, compiling news bulletins and monitoring official coverage
of the talks.
   Every afternoon, Solidarity press aides redecorate the
rose-colored room. A Solidarity banner is hung on the wall and piles
of still-banned underground newspapers are placed on a coffee table.
   The underground press, which has thrived despite Communist
authorities' attempts to quash it, and since the round-table talks
began its press corps has turned out in force for the flurry of
Solidarity and official news conferences.
   The addition of these ``alternative'' journalists and questions
from curious Solidarity activists who clog the room often cause the
news conferences to drag on for as long as two hours, sending some
Western journalists to the bar or back to their offices.
   ``From time to time it's difficult for us ... some Solidarity
activists don't always know what a press conference is and they try
to start a discussion rather than asking pointed questions,'' said
Woycicki, himself a journalist for a church-affiliated monthly.
   Solidarity has opened its conferences to the state-controlled
media and is keeping careful tabs on the way the round-table talks
are being covered.
   Every morning at 9 a.m., Woycicki, Solidarity national spokesman
Janusz Onyszkiewicz and several other Solidarity spokesmen analyze
official newspapers and watch televison news reports on videotape.
   They are especially interested in how other Communist countries
are covering the round table.
   ``The journalists from Tass (the official Soviet news agency)
showed a big interest in our job. We have quite free relations with
them,'' Woycicki said.
   For the underground press, reporting on the round-table talks has
offered them freedom unknown since Solidarity had its own press
during its 16-month legal existence.
   ``I can imagine a better situation with typewriters and
telephones, but I am not going to grumble,'' said Krzystof Leski, a
journalist of the underground weekly Tygodnik Mazowsze, who is
trying to coordinate coverage of news conferences by the opposition
press.
   Government news conferences at the official Interpress Club just
across Victory Square offer simultaneous translation for foreign
journalists and better working conditions.
   But attendance there has been lower and the proceedings seem dull
in comparison to the bustle at the Europejski _ where only the
barkeeper seems anxious for it all to end.

<HEAD>Diaper Services Make Environmental Appeal for the Reusable Kind</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Diaper services are hoping that a newfound
concern with the environment might help the cloth variety stage a
comeback against disposables.
   Perhaps no other product has had such an impact on child rearing
as the plastic and cellulose disposable diaper. But critics say the
disposable diaper, which does not decay when buried, has been adding
to the country's garbage problems since their use became widespread
in the 1970s.
   An estimated 18 billion such diapers are used _ and disposed of _
each year, according to a new study that was commissioned by the
trade group for diaper service companies. The disposable diapers
accounted for an estimated 3.6 million tons of waste last year,
about 2 percent of all waste buried in landfills, said the report by
Carl Lehrburger, an expert in waste management.
   Lehrburger was planning to discuss the results today at a news
conference.
   Although Lehrburger insists that the National Association of
Diaper Services had no editorial control over the study, he
nevertheless recommends as an immediate step that parents be
encouraged to shift to cloth diapers. Beyond that, he suggests that
governments consider a tax on disposable diapers and at the same
time provide tax incentives for the diaper service industry to
encourage such a switch.
   In the coming months the cloth diaper advocates plan to press the
environmental concerns as they lobby environmental groups as well as
state and local officials, said John Shiffert, executive director of
the association, in a telephone interview Tuesday from its
Philadelphia headquarters.
   While at least 21 states have debated legislation in recent years
limiting or banning plastic packaging waste, only in two states _
Oregon and Washington _ have the debates focused specifically on
disposable diapers, acknowledges Lehrburger. In both states the
legislation affecting diapers failed.
   Disposable diaper manufacturers have in the past disputed the
claim that soiled diapers pose a health hazard and have suggested
the impact of disposable diapers on the landfill problem is being
exaggerated.
   Officials of both Procter &amp; Gamble and Kimberly-Clark, which
together account for 80 percent of the disposable diaper sales,
could not be reached Tuesday.
   Lehrburger, in his report, estimates that about 2 percent of the
wastes put into landfills comes from disposable diapers. And as
states and local governments impose recycling requirements on other
garbage such as bottles and paper, these diapers will account for an
even higher percentage of the total wastes buried.
   ``As a society we have been sold on the idea of `disposability'
without full recognition of the costs associated with this
convenience,'' writes Lehrburger,
   The report, he continues, hopefully will be ``the beginning
point'' for a public policy debate over the benefits and drawbacks
of what many parents of young children have come to consider an
indispensable product.

<HEAD>New Paraguayan Leader Vows to Fight Drug Trafficking, Congressman
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first U.S. lawmaker to visit Paraguay since
the coup earlier this month says the South American nation's new
leader is vowing to rid the country of its reputation as a haven for
``thieves and scoundrels.''
   Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., said Tuesday that he met for an
hour last week with Gen. Andres Rodriguez, who ousted President
Alfredo Stroessner in a coup Feb. 3.
   ``In our conversation, the provisional president was very
specific,'' Morrison said. ``He even assured me that he is willing
to receive requests from those who hunt war criminals, because he
wants to end Paraguay's historic reputation as a haven for ex-Nazis,
drug dealers and Third World dictators.''
   The congressman said Rodriguez also promised to help fight drug
trafficking. Paraguay is known as a key money-laundering center for
cocaine profits.
   But Morrison, who later in the day briefed State Department
officials on his visit, said the Bush administration should ``base
its policies toward Paraguay on future actions'' not promises.
   Also on Tuesday, the political council of the Organization of
American States adopted a resolution that the Rodriguez government
``guarantee a process of democratization with true participation of
all the political parties in clean and impeccable elections.''
   A special envoy of the new Paraguayan government accepted the
unanimous resolution.
   The council acted after a Paraguayan opposition leader, Domingo
Laino, suggested that holding elections too early would ensure
return to power of Stroessner's Colorado Party. Laino noted that the
OAS human rights commission has declared that Paraguay's political
structure is seriously tilted toward the Colorado.
   Laino said the Christian Democratic Party and his own Liberal
Party are illegal and the current law forbids the establishment of
alliances or electoral fronts.

<HEAD>Nikkei Closes At Record High, Dollar Off 0.53 Yen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices rose to close Wednesday at another
record high on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, while the U.S. dollar edged
lower against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar ended trading at 126.62 yen, down 0.53 yen from
Tuesday's 127.15-yen finish. The currency opened at 126.75 yen and
traded between 126.50 yen and 126.80 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which shed
197.00 points Tuesday, recouped 331.85 points, or 1.04 percent,
closing at 32,311.93, a new record high.
   The index's rebound came on the heels of testimony Tuesday by
U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, in which he told
the Senate Banking Committee in Washington of the need for a tighter
U.S. economy to fight inflation.
   Nobuto Nakahari, a trader with Nomura Securities in Tokyo, said
the Tokyo market was doing well in spite of such discouraging
factors as a three-day weekend starting Friday, the day of the
funeral for the late Emperor Hirohito, and a widening
stock-profiteering scandal.
   Eight people, including former government officials and business
leaders, have been arrested on bribery or securities law violation
charges in connection with the stock transactions.
   Executives of the Recruit Co., an information-employment
conglomerate, allegedly sought to buy influence by offering more
than 1.5 million unlisted shares to at least 150 politicians, public
officials and business leaders. Most of them later sold the stocks
for sizable profits.
   In currency dealings, the dollar lost ground as Japanese
investors started selling it after Greenspan's congressional
testimony, in which he gave little indication of a hike in the U.S.
discount rate.
   Trading was light in the absence of major market-affecting news,
said one dealer with a Japanese commercial bank in Tokyo.

<HEAD>Federal Commission Criticizes Chicago Board of Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade should broaden its
review of futures contracts, daily trading activity and traders in
order to do a better job of detecting abuses, a government agency
has concluded.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which reviewed the
activities of the world's largest futures market from July 1987 to
April 1988, said the board's routine computer surveillance program
was inadequate.
   The CFTC called for modifications to the program.
   A similar criticism was levied by the agency in its last review
of the board of trade in 1986, but received little public attention.
However, the latest report comes as a federal grand jury in Chicago
is reviewing evidence from a two-year FBI undercover investigation
of widespread alleged abuses at the board of trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   In reaction to the FBI investigation, Congress is closely
scrutinizing both the Chicago markets and the commission's oversight
of them. The agency's legislative authorization expires Sept. 30 and
Congress may demand reforms before passing it.
   In response to the report, board of trade officials noted that
the exchange's directors voted earlier this month to spend $1
million this year to improve the exchange's computerized trade
reconstruction system, which is designed to catch improper trades.
   Officials estimated then that the system was already about 90
percent effective in catching abuses. They said the upgrade would
increase the system's effectiveness to 100 percent.
   They also noted that over the past three years the exchange has
expanded its investigative office by 75 percent.
   ``We are always looking for constructive criticism about our rule
enforcement record from the CFTC,'' Board of Trade President Thomas
R. Donovan said in a statement.
   The CFTC report took note of the improvements, but said, ``It is
too soon to evaluate the changes.''

<HEAD>Judge Recommends $115 Million For 1978 France Oil Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Both sides claimed victory but promised appeals
after a judge recommended a $115.2 million judgment against Amoco
Corp. for the massive oil-spill damage from the 1978 wreck of a
supertanker off France.
   Tuesday's decision by retired U.S. District Judge Frank McGarr
was the latest round in a legal battle pitting the government of
France and about 90 other plaintiffs against Chicago-based Amoco.
   ``While we're gratified for some of the plaintiffs, this is still
only a small portion of the actual damages,'' said attorney Barry
Kingham, who represented the towns, associations of oystermen and
fishermen, hoteliers and the two French counties most affected by
the spill from the Amoco Cadiz.
   ``The judge is looking at the cleanup costs, but he has
consistently failed to recognize the harm goes beyond that,''
Kingham added. ``That will be the basis of our appeal.''
   Amoco attorney Frank Cicero said the recommendation by McGarr
``vindicates Amoco's position from the outset _ the damage claims
have been exaggerated.''
   ``Now we'd like to get the judgment in place, then go ahead and
appeal,'' he said.
   But a final judgment may still be far in the future.
   McGarr, who retired from the federal bench after the original
ruling but continues to serve as ``special master'' in the case,
scheduled a March 14 hearing on yet another possible revision.
   When it is completed, McGarr will forward a finished draft of his
recommendation to U.S. District Judge Charles Norgle, who will enter
a final judgment.
   In January 1988, McGarr recommended $85.2 million in damages
against Amoco. After appeals from plaintiffs, he increased the
amount by $30 million Tuesday.
   The largest recommended increase went to the government of
France, which is now in line for an award of $44.4 million, compared
with $31.9 million in the original ruling 13 months ago.
   At the lower end of the revisions were some 100 French towns,
whose commerce and well-being were affected by the spill that
created an oil slick 18 miles wide and 80 miles long, killing
thousands of birds and millions of sea creatures and washing waves
of thick black tar along 100 miles of coast.
   The towns had received $7.3 million in the original judgment and
sought an additional $8 million, but received only an additional
$200,000.
   Interest will be added to each award.
   The cash figures in the original award, as well as Tuesday's
recommendation, were in French francs. Attorneys for both sides said
the combined awards now total about $115 million _ $61 million in
actual damages and $54 million to $60 million in interest.
   In previous rulings, McGarr assessed liability to both Amoco and
Astilleros Espanoles S.A., the Spanish firm that built the Amoco
Cadiz and defaulted by refusing to recognize the district court's
jurisdiction.
   Amoco is continuing with litigation to recover the entire cost of
the judgment from Astilleros, said company attorney Cicero.
   ``Anywhere we can find assets, we can sue to collect those assets
for the judgment,'' he said.
   Amoco's shares rose 37.5 cents Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange to close at $77.125.
   The Amoco Cadiz ran aground two miles off the Brittany coast
March 16, 1978. The huge tanker, which had lost the use of its
rudder, had been under tow through the English Channel by a
German-owned tug when the towlines snapped in hurricane-force winds
and heavy seas and the ship became impaled along the rocks off
northwest France.

<HEAD>Coup Figure Says Post-Marcos Elections Planned, Not Aquino Presidency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military officers whose mutiny
helped propel Corazon Aquino to power initially planned to set up a
provisional government and hold new elections to replace Ferdinand
Marcos as president, a key conspirator said today.
   But Navy Capt. Rex Robles said then-Defense Minister Juan Ponce
Enrile, leader of the mutineers, decided Mrs. Aquino should instead
be sworn in as president to prevent Marcos from a making legal claim
to the office.
   Robles made the remarks during an interview on radio station DZRH
on the third anniversary of the mutiny, which triggered the popular
uprising that drove Marcos from power on Feb. 25, 1986.
   U.S. officials first refused to support the mutineers and did so
only after it became clear that Marcos was finished, Robles said.
   He said the Reform the Armed Forces Movement had planned to
launch a coup against Marcos in December 1985 but postponed the move
after he called a ``snap election'' for Feb. 7, 1986.
   ``So we decided to postpone until sometime after elections,
around April or May in the summer,'' Robles said. But the
conspirators advanced their plans after public outrage over massive
cheating in the election, in which both Marcos and Mrs. Aquino
claimed victory.
   ``If we succeeded in ousting Marcos or asking him to step down,
our plan was we would set up a transition council, either five to
seven members,'' Robles said. ``Our agreement was whoever joined the
transition council would not run in the election which we would hold
because it would be unfair.''
   When it appeared the mutiny would succeed, Robles said civilian
and military opponents met to discuss how to establish the legal
authority of a post-Marcos government.
   According to Robles, Enrile told the gathering: ``It is necessary
to swear Mrs. Aquino into office right now.'' Several politicians
were shocked by the suggestion.
   But Robles said Enrile argued that by swearing in Mrs. Aquino
first, Marcos ``would have to play catch-up'' and would lack legal
authority.
   ``It was Sen. Enrile's idea,'' Robles said. ``They were not
prepared (to accept) that concept that you must beat Marcos to the
presidency.''
   The National Assembly certified Marcos as the election winner
several days before the mutiny, but he had not taken his oath.
   Marcos took his oath on Feb. 25, 1986 soon after Mrs. Aquino was
sworn in. He fled Manila hours later aboard a U.S. helicopter and
departed before dawn the next day for exile in Hawaii.
   Movement members frequently have complained that they were never
given credit for their role in ousting Marcos. The reform movement
included former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, sought in the
violent August 1987 attempt to topple Mrs. Aquino.
   Enrile was fired as defense minister on Nov. 23, 1986, after an
alleged coup plot by his followers. He was elected as the only
opposition member of the Senate in May 1987.

   Actress Linda Gray has had enough of Sue Ellen
Ewing and will leave Southfork, J.R. and the ``Dallas'' nighttime
soap cast after 11 years.
   ``She's going on to pursue various other things that she had in
the works,'' her publicist Jeffrey Lane said Tuesday in announcing
the departure. He said the ventures would probably be in television
or films.
   Miss Gray, 46, will leave the show at the end of the current
season, Lane said. It wasn't known how her ``Dallas'' character
would be eliminated from the series.
   In the past, the show has featured odd twists and bizarre plots
to explain character exits, including an entire season that
evaporated as a dream sequence.
   Miss Gray played the role of the alcoholic wife of Larry Hagman's
conniving, womanizing character, J.R. Ewing, in the popular
``Dallas'' series.
   The actress has performed in two television movies, ``Haywire''
and ``The Wild and The Free,'' both in 1980. She played a divorced
mother of two struggling for custody in ``Not in Front of the
Children'' in 1982.
   Miss Gray was a model with two children before becoming an
actress in her early 30s.

<HEAD>Tokyo Stocks Surge To Record High, Dollar Off 0.53 Yen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index rebounded
sharply today, closing at another record high, while the U.S. dollar
fell against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 197.00-point loser Tuesday,
shot up 331.85 points, or 1.04 percent, today and closed at
32,311.93. The gain was the largest this year.
   Strong buying interest among both individual and institutional
investors, largely due to stability in the currency market and in
interest rates, contributed to the rise, said a dealer with Daiwa
Securities in Tokyo.
   In heavy trading, with first section volume estimated at 1.4
billion shares, steel, construction and auto shares were among
gainers.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 126.62 yen, down 0.53
yen from Tuesday's close of 127.15 yen. The currency opened at
126.75 yen and ranged between 126.50 yen and 126.80 yen.
   The dollar's weakness in Tokyo followed comments Tuesday by U.S.
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan in congressional
testimony, dealers said.
   Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee that the United
States would keep its current monetary policy unchanged as it sought
to head off inflation. He was to testify again today.
   Some market players had expected him to suggest higher interest
rates, said a dealer with a major commercial bank in Tokyo, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Such expectations helped push the dollar up by 1.40 yen on
Tuesday. Higher U.S. interest rates make dollar-denominated
investments more attractive to foreigners.
   Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita told a news
conference today that he sees the dollar remaining steady against
the yen and that he expects no major changes in Japanese or U.S.
economic policies.
   ``Foreign exchange rates (for the dollar) probably won't move
far, either up or down,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dry Weather, Water Shortages Plague Large Parts Of World</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic NY4</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian priests are leading prayers for rain, Argentina is
rationing electricity and reservoirs in the United States are
dropping as seemingly unrelated weather in several regions of the
world has led to drought.
   The problem is critical in southern Europe, where about 25
percent of the normal amount of rain has fallen since Dec. 1, and in
the South American countries of Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay,
officials say.
   In northwestern Spain, drinking wells have dried up in some towns
in Galicia and potable water has had to be brought in by truck.
Water is being rationed in other towns in the region. Weather
records in Oviedo, the capital of Asturias, show it's the worst
drought since 1876.
   Electricity in Buenos Aires is shut off for up to three hours a
day in different sections of the capital because river levels are
too low for hydroelectric plants to operate at full power.
   In the United States, the Agriculture Department's chief
meteorologist, Norton Strommen, said a recurrence of last year's
severe drought is unlikely. However, the Northeast coast has had a
dry winter and officials in New York and Boston are worrying about
water shortages.
   Extremely dry weather has also hit southern Florida, and water
usage is being restricted in several towns along the Gulf of Mexico.
Severe to extreme drought conditions are also persisting in large
sections of the country's Midwest and West, turning the winter wheat
crop yellow in some areas.
   Peter Newhouse, a cereal crop expert at the U.N. Food and
Agricultural Organization in Rome, said the agency is worried the
droughts will hurt the world's grain production.
   ``This year is crucial more than any other year because poor crop
production in the last two years has brought stock levels down
nearly to those of the world food crisis in the early 1970s. An
unprecedented 200 million tons are needed to re-build stocks to the
minimum levels needed for global food security,'' Newhouse said.
   Most of Africa, where large regions are perennially parched, is
enjoying a relatively wet year, however, with replenishing rains
falling even in the normally dry Sahel region south of the Sahara
Desert.
   ``Africa has been, for the most part, pretty good,'' says Dave
Miskus, a meteorologist with the U.S. Climate Analysis Center in
Washington, D.C. ``The only really dry area has been southern
Zimbabwe and northeastern South Africa.''
   But along the Mediterranean coast of Europe, the skies have
produced little _ if any _ rain since Dec. 1, forcing some cities in
Italy to ration water and prompting priests to add weekly prayers
for rain to Roman Catholic church services.
   Rainfall has ranged from less than 10 percent to less than 50
percent of normal in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Yugoslavia and Greece,
weather officials say.
   ``Those areas along the Mediterranean coast should be getting
most of their rain (at this time of year), but that whole region has
been extremely dry. Some parts of Italy have had no precipitation at
all since Christmas,'' said Miskus, who tracks worldwide weather
patterns.
   Since late December, dry weather has spread north through most of
the rest of Europe, with large regions receiving less than two
inches of rain and some areas less than one inch. The Scandinavian
countries, West Germany, parts of Poland, Scotland, Ireland and
England have largely been spared from the dry weather.
   Meteorologists blame the drought on a strong ridge of high
pressure over central Europe since December, preventing
Mediterranean storms from forming or intensifying.
   Yet while some regions of the world are enduring prolonged dry
spells simultaneously, weather experts don't believe there is a
single phenomenon linking these events.
   ``I don't think it has a unifying cause to it,'' said Robert
Harnack, a professor of meteorology at Rutgers University in New
Brunswick, N.J. ``In any given year, with the world as big as it is,
there are always places going in one extreme or the other. I have no
reason to believe this year is any more abnormal than other years.''
   In the southern Alps, unseasonably warm temperatures and a lack
of precipitation combined to hurt business this winter for ski
resorts, forcing some to close because there wasn't enough snow.
   In northern Italy, fruit growers and ski resort operators have
asked the government for emergency relief funds.
   Agricultural losses have been estimated at $1.5 billion as low
lake levels prevent farmers from irrigating their crops in several
regions.
   Water rationing is in effect in several hard-hit areas, including
Genoa and Sardinia.
   In the Sardinian city of Iglesias, residents receive water only
in five-hour periods from Monday through Friday. In the northern
port city of Olbia, residents who use water for non-domestic
purposes, such as washing cars, face fines of up to 1 million lire
($750).
   Crop production in Portugal has been hurt and government
officials have blamed the drought for increased food prices in
Lisbon. Reservoirs north of the Tagus river, running through central
Portugal, are only 28 percent full.
   In Spain, forest fires have increased because of the dry
conditions and have ravaged more than 4,048 acres of woods and
meadows in Asturias since Jan. 1 _ more than all the land burned in
fires there last year.
   In Galicia, the region's legendary green fields have turned ochre
because the region has received 30 percent of its normal amount of
rainfall from November through January _ the least amount of rain in
30 years, weather officials say.
   Farmers and cattle ranchers also are desperate for water in a
large chunk of the South American continent. From June 1 to Feb. 18,
Miskus said, precipitation has been from 20 percent to 50 percent of
normal in northern Argentina, Uruguay, eastern Paraguay, southern
Brazil and southeastern Bolivia.
   In Buenos Aires, night sports and music events have been
canceled, and hours have been reduced for subways and television
broadcasting. The drought has shriveled crops and forced ranchers in
neighboring Uruguay to sell or slaughter cows because they don't
have enough feed.
   ``Normally, they get most of their precipitation in the summer,''
Miskus said. ``It's been almost a six-month drought down there.''

<HEAD>Report Questions Wide Use of Chemotherapy in Early Breast Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A federal recommendation to give chemotherapy to
all victims of early breast cancer will mean needlessly treating
65,000 women at a cost of $338 million to improve the outlook for
just 5,000 others, a new analysis concludes.
   Until recently, drug and hormone therapy were given exclusively
to women whose tumors had spread to their lymph nodes. Those whose
cancer had not visibly progressed beyond their breasts were treated
with surgery and radiation therapy alone.
   However, four new studies suggest that even those with early
breast cancer could benefit from chemotherapy drug treatment. The
therapy somewhat improves their chances of remaining cancer-free
during the years immediately after their surgery, although there is
no evidence that they ultimately live any longer.
   Three of the studies, conducted in the United States, were the
basis of an unusual recommendation last May by the National Cancer
Institute. Without revealing details of the studies, the agency sent
letters to cancer specialists suggesting that they give drug therapy
to all breast cancer patients.
   But Dr. Merrill I. Feldman of University Hospital in Boston,
co-author of one of the studies, said, ``There is a lot of
resistance to treating women who are node negative'' _ who don't
show evidence of cancer in the lymph nodes.
   ``Many people didn't feel that the alert from the NCI was
documented by enough evidence to justify it,'' he said. ``It still
doesn't justify putting all women on this, unless they fit the
strict criteria of the women in these studies.''
   The details of those studies, plus one conducted in Europe, are
finally being published in Thursday's issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine.
   In general, the studies found that about 80 percent of the women
getting drug treatment were still free of disease after about four
years, compared with about 72 percent of those who were not treated.
There was no significant difference, however, in the death rates
between the two groups.
   But for doctors the dilemma is knowing whom to treat. About 70
percent of women with early breast cancer are cured of breast cancer
with surgery or radiation alone. Many physicians are reluctant to
treat everyone, when only a small minority could possibly benefit,
yet there is no way at present to know who really needs the
medicines.
   In an editorial in the journal, Dr. William L. McGuire of the
University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio noted that
if doctors used drug therapy to treat all 70,000 women diagnosed
each year with early breast cancer, they would prevent recurrence in
5,040 of them. The rest would have been treated needlessly, and the
therapy would have cost $338 million. As many as 50 to 100 women
would die from the treatment itself.
   ``I would argue that the cost considerably outweighs the benefits
of treating all node-negative patients, especially in the absence of
a proved survival benefit,'' McGuire wrote.
   But in another editorial, Dr. Vincent T. DeVita Jr. of Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, a former head of the cancer
institute, said the studies document ``an impressive reduction in
the risk of recurrence.'' He recommended that drug treatment be
offered to all breast cancer patients except those with very small
tumors.
   Several experts agreed that the decision to use the medicines
should be left up to the patient and not be made by the physician
alone.
   ``The mistake would be for doctors to automatically give the drug
without explaining the unresolved issues about whether there will be
a survival advantage and the possible long-term side effects,'' said
Dr. Nicholas Robert of New England Medical Center, a co-author of
one of the studies.
   Robert said he would consider drug treatment for somewhat more
than half of women with early breast cancer, while Feldman said it
might be reasonable for about 70 percent.
   The four studies published were:
   _The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, or
NSABP, treated 679 women with tumors that did not respond to
hormones. After four years, 80 percent of those getting a three-drug
combination were cancer-free, compared with 71 percent in a
comparison group.
   _A second NSABP study treated 2,644 women with tumors sensitive
to hormones. After five years, 83 percent getting the synthetic
hormone tamoxifen were cancer-free, versus 77 percent in a
comparison group.
   _A multi-hospital study directed by Dr. Edward G. Mansour of
Cleveland Metropolitan General Hospital treated 403 women with large
tumors. After three years, 84 percent getting a four-drug
combination and 69 percent in a comparison group were still free of
cancer.
   _The Ludwig Breast Cancer Study Group in Europe treated 1,275
women with early breast cancer. After four years, 77 percent of
those who received a four-drug combination were cancer-free, as were
73 percent in a comparison group.

   A month after offering to participate in
national elections, El Salvador's leftist rebels say they will lay
down their weapons if the armed forces are cut and next month's
presidential vote is postponed.
   Leaders of the country's political parties, to whom the rebel
Farabundo Marti Liberation Front made the offer on Tuesday, said it
seemed to reflect a sincere guerrilla desire for peace.
   They said in a resolution that they would today meet with
President Jose Napoleon Duarte and ask him to immediately engage the
rebels in talks.
   The rebel and political leaders had met for two days _ the first
such meeting of its kind _ in an effort to end a nine-year civil war
that has claimed 70,000 lives, most of them civilian.
   Representatives of the 13 parties agreed late Tuesday to press
their U.S.-backed government to discuss the new rebel offer directly
with its authors, who were for the first time offering to lay down
their arms.
   ``We are going to press right away for a meeting with the
executive branch and legislative branch, '' said Francisco Merino,
vice presidential candidate for the rightist Republican Nationalist
Alliance, or Arena.
   Arena has been leading in the presidential polls and, along with
Duarte and the military, has opposed any arrangement that would
postpone the vote.
   In El Salvador on Monday, guerrillas attacked the country's
principal army base and an engineering detachment, leaving eight
dead and 17 injured.
   ``Rejection of the proposal will mean the war will not only
continue, but will escalate,'' rebel radio declared.
   Guerrilla leaders were clearly pleased with the outcome of the
meeting. Their last talks with the government fell apart after the
murder of human rights leader Herbert Anaya Sanabria in October 1987.
   ``The parties have opened the possibility of a national
consensus,'' rebel commander Schafik Jorge Handal told a news
conference after the meeting at a resort complex in this town 40
miles south of Mexico City.
   The rebels are calling for an agreement with the government on a
cease-fire, electoral reforms and postponing the March 19 vote at
least four months to give them a chance to enter the political
process peacefully.
   They are also calling for cutting the Armed Forces from 56,000
members to 12,000, and for consolidating the National Police, the
National Guard and Treasury Police under civilian authority.
   In return, the guerrillas offer to lay down their arms and end
their decade-long election boycott.
   ``The proposal of the FMLN is very clear: they're searching for
peace,'' said Julio Adolfo Rey Prendes, presidential candidate of
the centrist Authentic Christian Movement. ``This is the first time
that such a thing has happened.'' The catalyst for the Oaxtepec
gathering was a January 23 rebel proposal to take part in the
elections and respect their outcome if the voting were postponed by
six months.
   Duarte, the military and Arena, which recently wrested control of
the National Assembly from the president's Christian Democrats, have
scorned the January proposal.
   Now, however, Arena is party to Tuesday's agreement to consider
the expanded peace plan and Duarte must confront the public pressure
of his country's most powerful political party.
   ``I would say in general that the government has to talk now,
that they cannot refuse or evade talks with the FMLN,'' said Ruben
Zamora, head of the Democratic Convergence, a coalition of small
leftist parties.
   Duarte, who is suffering from terminal cancer, will also be
pressured to reign in a battle-hardened military with a long history
of human rights abuses.
   Last week, Defense Minister Gen. Eugenio Vides Casanova said if
the elections were postponed and Duarte stayed in power past June 1,
when his constitutional term ends, the army might intervene.

<HEAD>Bookstore Chains That Yanked `Verses' May Have Been Worried About
Lawsuits</HEAD>

   When is a bookstore legally liable for terrorism?
   The bookstore chains that pulled ``The Satanic Verses'' off their
shelves probably did so with at least one eye on lawsuits filed
against Pan Am after a terrorist bomb blew up the airline's Flight
103 last year.
   The companies _ Waldenbooks and B. Dalton _ said concern for
employees' and customers' safety mandated withdrawal of the novel.
   The Ayatollah Khomeini had pronounced the book sufficiently
blasphemous to warrant a death sentence for its author, Salman
Rushdie, and those involved with its publication.
   Waldenbooks said its store managers had received bomb threats.
   Legal experts say the companies undoubtedly had another cause for
concern: their potential liability if someone were injured or killed
in a terrorist attack.
   The companies ``might be concerned about their employees, and
they might be concerned about themselves,'' said George Gabel of
Jacksonville, Fla., chairman of the American Bar Association's
committee on defamation.
   Spokesmen for the companies declined to say what role, if any,
the threat of lawsuits played in their decision, or on exactly what
information they based their actions. But in an article Tuesday on
the op-ed page of The New York Times, Waldenbooks president Harry
Hoffman referred to the fate of Flight 103 and the 259 people aboard.
   Saying that his decision to remove the novel followed ``real
threats made against the lives of real people,'' Hoffman added: ``We
have only to contemplate the downing of the Pan Am flight to be
reminded that such threats may be taken seriously.''
   In that case, the airline was informed by the government that
bomb threats had been made against Pan Am jetliners flying to the
United States from Frankfurt, West Germany. U.S. diplomatic
personnel were notified of the threats, but the general public was
not.
   Flight 103 from Frankfurt to New York blew up over the village of
Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, killing all 259 aboard. Some of the
victims' relatives have sued, claiming Pan Am should have disclosed
the threats.
   In the ``Satanic Verses'' case, the ayatollah sentenced to death
its author, Salman Rushdie, ``and all those involved in its
publication who were aware of its content.''
   Legal experts said that a lawyer could legitimately interpret
``publication'' to mean ``distribution,'' and give his client sound,
albeit rather conservative, advice: get the book off the shelf and
out of the windows.
   But they also said a bookstore that wants to keep selling the
book could do so without running an unreasonable legal risk.
   Assume the worst: a store continues to display and sell the book,
a bomb explodes and a customer is hurt; he sues the store for
negligence, claiming that the bookseller had shirked his common law
``duty of reasonable care'' by continuing to sell the book despite
threats.
   The customer's case hinges on the immediacy of Khomeini's threat,
and the reasonableness of the store's response. Was the threat
directed at bookstores in general or merely publishers? Was it too
remote to be credible? Did the store post some sort of warning of
its own to customers?
   Several prominent lawyers said they liked the store's chances in
a legal fight.
   ``I don't see a specific warning having been given here (by
Khomeini),'' said Robert Bohner, a Brooklyn attorney who has
represented plaintiffs in many negligence cases. ``The chances of
liability in a case like this are probably rather slim.''
   Gabel said that given the number of book stores in the country
and the wording of Khomeini's statement, ``I would think a bookstore
would be fairly safe.''
   Andrew C. Hecker Jr., a Philadelphia attorney who heads the ABA's
committee on torts, said, ``The question is whether a company must
heed every warning it gets. It might be that if every warning were
heeded, you could not conduct your business.''
   Hecker said the bookstore might also rely to some extent on the
public policy favoring freedom of speech.
   Although it has been invoked repeatedly over the past few days,
the First Amendment is largely irrelevant in the Satanic Verses
case; it protects Americans against action by their government, not
by bookstores or ayatollahs, and it can't excuse negligence by
merchants.
   But a bookstore facing a negligence suit for refusing to suppress
a book would probably be in better legal shape than one being sued
because it failed to clean the ice off its front steps.
   ``It's the public's right to have access to this book versus the
ability of a foreign potentate to create enough terror to suppress
it,'' Bohner said. ``Where are we going to draw the line? A court
would have to address that somewhere.''
   But where?
   ``That's a question that has kept me up at night,'' Hecker said.
``Every instinct says you don't want to give into this (threat), but
your heart goes out to people who are hurt. I don't know how you
resolve the issue.''

   An unmanned Soviet space satellite has sent back to
Earth the first images of the largest of Mars' two moons, the Tass
news agency said.
   The space probe, launched July 12, began orbiting Mars on Jan. 29
as part of a program to unlock the secrets of the red planet and its
largest moon, Phobos, which is seven miles in diameter.
   The Phobos II probe was moved into an closer orbit Saturday and
began beaming broadcasting images of the moon at midday Tuesday,
Tass said.
   ``A high-quality image of Phobos from various angles was recorded
on nine television sequences,'' Tass said in a dispatch from the
flight control center in Moscow.
   Phobos II carries instruments and experiments prepared by 12
countries as well as the European Space Agency.
   A sister ship, Phobos I, failed to respond to commands last
September when a ground controller sent an erroneous computer
command. Its flight controllers have since been unable to
communicate with it.
   The Phobos mission is a precursor to what officials say will be a
manned mission to Mars early next century.

   A state university that held a Sexuality Week
featuring a ``condom dance'' and a lecture on the female erogenous
zone drew complaints from a senior state senator, who called the
school ``a center of carnal knowledge.''
   Republican state Sen. James Donovan, chairman of the Senate's
Education Committee, said Tuesday the State University of New York
at Albany ``terribly misplaced'' its spending priorities by holding
Sexuality Week.
   But a spokeswoman for the university, noting that only 38
students attended the ``condom dance,'' said it's wrong to criticize
the university's morals.
   ``It was a weeklong series of programs designed to teach students
how to be responsible sexual partners and how their behavior affects
relationships with other,'' Christine McKnight, spokeswoman for the
university, said of Sexuality Week.
   Donovan, however, said ``every tax-paying citizen'' of New York
should be aware of Sexuality Week.
   ``SUNY Albany has always been a pillar'' of the state university
system, the senator said. ``But instead of becoming an institution
known for its academic prowess, it is becoming a center of carnal
knowledge.''
   ``All of us agree that we must combat AIDS and that education
about sex can contribute heavily to this fight,'' Donovan said. ``I
cannot believe that the state of New York and its university system
believe that `condom dances' are the solution.''
   Students attending the ``condom dance'' were given free condoms
and treated to ``four hours of sexually explicit music,'' Donovan
said. Another event of ``Sexuality Week'' was a 15-minute film and
lecture on the so-called ``G Spot,'' a supposed female erogenous
zone.
   McKnight said most of the programs were funded by student
organizations, like the Student Association and Inter-Fraternity
Council. She said she wasn't sure if any university funds were used
for events.
   Sexuality Week is held on other campuses across the country to
highlight issues of safe sex during the week of Valentine's Day,
McKnight said. It's the fifth straight year it's been held at SUNY
Albany and hasn't been a controversy in the past, she said.
   People who came to see the presentation on the ``G Spot''
expecting a dirty movie instead saw a very informative film and
lecture, she said.
   And the turnout for the ``condom dance'' was ``disappointing,''
she said, probably because it was held just before a three-day
holiday weekend.

   In the largest heroin raid in U.S. history,
police and federal agents tracked $1 billion worth of the drug from
Southeast Asia to two homes in New York City, where it was hidden
inside hundreds of tires.
   The 800-pound seizure made the notorious ``French Connection''
case seem modest by comparison, and showcased the rise of Asian drug
smugglers, authorities said Tuesday.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney said ``Operation White Mare'' and
some other recent cases provide ``clear proof that the Chinese are
responsible for 70 to 80 percent of the heroin that is smuggled into
New York.''
   Since 1985, the supply of heroin from Asia has increased, and
Asian drug rings have supplanted heroin operations run by
traditional American organized crime families, the prosecutor said
at a news conference held to announce the seizure.
   The 800 pounds, with a street value estimated at more than $1
billion, ``would supply 40 to 50 percent of all the heroin needed
for some 200,000 addicts on an annual basis in New York City,'' he
said.
   Authorities say investigators set out 18 months ago to identify
major Chinese heroin distribution and import networks operating in
the metropolitan area. Working on a tip from an informant, an
Asian-American FBI undercover agent infiltrated the ring.
   The investigation culminated in raids Monday night and Tuesday
morning, when 17 people were arrested and $3 million in cash was
seized in addition to the drugs.
   Another nine people were arrested in Hong Kong today, authorities
said.
   Officials said the 800 pounds originated _ as much of the U.S.
heroin supply does _ in the ``Golden Triangle,'' the rugged
borderlands of Burma, Thailand and Laos.
   From there the heroin was tracked to Hong Kong, where it was
packed inside small hollow rubber tires designed for carts. The 264
boxes of tires were smuggled into Los Angeles and trucked to New
York, where they were found in rented trucks outside two homes in
Queens, according to James M. Fox, an assistant FBI director.
   However, Hong Kong officials believed the heroin was shipped
directly from Thailand to the United States, said Chris Cantley,
acting chief staff officer of the police narcotics bureau in Hong
Kong.
   ``Basically, in this whole affair, the organizational brains were
in Hong Kong,'' he said.
   Charges are expected to be filed Thursday against some or all of
the nine Hong Kong Chinese arrested in a pre-dawn sweep today,
Cantley said. He said U.S. authorities may seek extradition of some
of the suspects.
   Thirty-one people from New York, Los Angeles, Detroit, San
Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore, Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver were
named in a criminal complaint filed with the U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn.
   Of those, 14 were already jailed in Detroit, Buffalo, Toronto and
Hong Kong, and the other 17 were arrested here during the three
raids.
   The investigation identified Fok Leung Woo, also known as ``Peter
Woo,'' a longtime resident and businessman in Manhattan's Chinatown,
as the ring's leader. Woo is former chairman of the Chinatown
Democratic Club, Maloney said.
   ``Woo was not so much the head of an operation ... as he was a
broker, an entrepreneur who brought people together,'' Fox said.
   Maloney, whose office had prosecuted some of the ``French
Connection'' cases, said the 800 pounds of heroin seized Monday is
an unheard-of amount.
   Other major heroin busts in the United States include the seizure
of 570 pounds of heroin allegedly imported from Asia by Kon
Yu-leung, who was arrested last year; the ``Pizza Connection'' case,
in which 200 pounds of heroin imported through Sicily was seized;
and the ``French Connection'' case, in which 70 pounds of heroin
imported through Marseilles were seized between 1968 and 1971.

   At least a dozen Central American refugees
have been detained and hundreds more kept waiting under a new
federal immigration policy of quickly evaluating applications for
political asylum.
   The new policy went into effect slowly Tuesday, the day after it
was announced by Immigration and Naturalization Service officials
who said they wanted to discourage Central Americans from entering
the United States with ``frivolous'' applications for asylum.
   By Tuesday afternoon, only 45 Central Americans, half from
Nicaragua, were under review while 200 others waited to be processed.
   Two State Department advisers recommended denying asylum to 25 of
the 45, and the others were still under consideration, INS spokesman
Mario Ortiz said. He said the INS decided to detain at least 12 of
the 25 pending deportation hearings.
   INS District Director Omer Sewell said the addition of 500
federal workers in the Brownsville area, the main entry point for
Central American asylum seekers, will help as the new process is
phased in during the next few weeks.
   But critics say it already is operating at inhumane speed, and
they have expressed outrage at INS plans to hold rejected applicants
in tents erected inside a minimum-security prison.
   The Catholic Bishops of Texas charged that they foresaw ``the
creation of the largest concentration camp on U.S. soil since the
incarceration of Japanese-Americans during World War II.''
   Only immigrants who can show persecution are entitled to asylum;
those who come to better themselves economically can be deported.
The INS maintains that most Central Americans arriving in south
Texas do not qualify for refugee status.
   Under the new plan, asylum applicants may get an answer on the
same day they apply, but they are subject to immediate arrest and
detention if denied asylum.
   Before Tuesday, applications could take weeks to process, and
aliens were released on their own recognizance while they awaited
appeals or deportation.
   The INS began erecting tents at its rural Port Isabel Service
Processing Center here in case the number of detainees at the
facility exceeds bed space. The agency said as many as 5,000 could
be detained in large circus-like tents within the 315-acre facility
that is surrounded by a 7-foot fence topped with barbed wire.
   Many of the applicants showing up at the center Tuesday were
unaware that they were subject to arrest if their cases were denied.
   ``We didn't know about it,'' said Luis Vasquez, 29, from El
Salvador, adding he would take his chances anyway.
   ``I just can't go back to Nicaragua,'' said Manuela Diaz, who
started crying while talking about conditions in her homeland.
   The applicants entering the facility generally paid little
attention to six people who were fasting across the road from the
center in protest of the new procedures.
   The three Salvadorans and three Roman Catholic nuns from South
Texas said they would remain there until the government granted
regugee status to Salvadorans and halted military aid to that
country.
   The Texas Catholic Conference said the new policy ``ignores the
facts of life in Central America that are causing the massive influx
of refugees to our country.''
   ``The INS statement speaks of `frivolous' applications.
Apparently any applications by people who have suffered dreadfully
from civil war are frivolous,'' it said in a statement.
   Brownsville immigration attorney Linda Yanez said 15 attorneys
had formed a group called the Cameron County Pro Bono Project to
defend those denied asylum.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, called the new policy a ``real step
forward'' but termed it a ``short-term solution to what may not be a
short-term problem.''
   ``The INS obviously believes it can reduce the flow of Central
American immigration by sending a `no-free-ride' signal. That may be
the case,'' Bentsen said. ``But we've got 40,000 contras in Honduras
and the prospect of a detention camp in South Texas may not be
enough to deter them from making the trip north.''

   Tony Award-winning actress Phyllis Frelich is
leading a coalition of deaf and hearing-impaired groups in
condemning use of a non-handicapped woman on CBS-TV's ``The

   Miss Frelich, who is hearing-impaired, complained Tuesday that a

   ``They say they could not find a hearing-impaired actress capable
of carrying the role,'' Miss Frelich said. ``We know better.
   ``Would anybody even consider hiring a white actress to paint her
face black and pretend to be black? Of course not. Then why do they
do the same thing to us? Why must we be subjected to this insulting
and demeaning discrimination,'' she said.
   The actress, who won a Tony in ``Children of a Lesser God'' on
Broadway, has launched a month-long letter-writing campaign
targeting CBS President Kim LeMasters and ``The Equalizer'' producer
James McAdams to prevent the episode from being aired.
   McAdams, the series executive producer, said the producers hired
a hearing-impaired man to play Miss Nixon's hearing-impaired fiance
and they auditioned several deaf actresses in the New York area but
could not find someone ``who was right for the role.''
   Howie Seago has the leading guest role of the boyfriend and there
are several deaf actors in supporting roles, McAdams said.
   ``We did earnestly look for a hearing-impaired person,'' McAdams
said. ``If we didn't consider any deaf actresses, if we slammed the
door in their face, then they'd have a point.''
   He said Frelich's protest could discourage other producers from
making programs about handicapped people.

   Doctors used a man's big toe to replace
his right thumb after the finger was severed during an industrial
accident, hospital officials said.
   David Hemmert, 19, of Owosso underwent the 14-hour operation Jan.
24, said officials at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital here.
   ``To tell you the truth, when I was told about this kind of
surgery, I wasn't too hip on it at first,'' Hemmert said Tuesday.
``After thinking it all over, I decided to go for it _ and I gained
more than I lost.''
   Hemmert was working for a window frame company when he
accidentally cut off his right thumb with an industrial saw, said
his surgeon, Dr. David Hing. The severed digit was replaced with the
big toe on the man's right foot.
   Hing said the man's new ``thumb'' will allow him to again grasp
objects with his injured hand.

<HEAD>Bush Invites Leading Chinese Dissident to Dinner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's best-known dissident, Fang Lizhi, said
today that he has been invited to attend a banquet hosted by
President Bush for Chinese senior state leaders.
   Fang, known for his sharp criticisms of Marxism and his call for
more democracy in China, said in a telephone interview that he plans
to attend the Sunday night dinner at a Beijing hotel.
   He said that if he has a chance to talk to Bush he will bring up
the issue of human rights, including the imprisonment of political
activists in China.
   Bush arrives in Beijing Saturday for a two-day visit following
his attendance of the funeral of Emperor Hirohito in Tokyo.
   The U.S. president is to dine at the Great Hall of the People
with President Yang Shangkun on Saturday night. The following day,
the American side is to host a return banquet for Yang and other
Chinese leaders.
   Premier Li Peng is also expected to attend that dinner.
   U.S. Embassy officials declined to provide other names on the
guest list, said to number about 500.
   Fang, also known for his work as an astrophysicist, gained
international prominence in early 1987 when he was fired from his
job and expelled from the Communist Party after being accused of
fomenting nationwide student demonstrations for democracy.
   He has since been the Chinese government's most outspoken critic,
decrying human rights abuses and demanding a faster pace of
democratic reform.
   Last month, Fang wrote an open letter to senior leader Deng
Xiaoping calling for an amnesty for political prisoners.

   The world's biggest block of cheese was
beginning to show its age, but that didn't put off residents of this
small town _ not necessarily cheese-lovers _ who came out to see the
wonder.
   ``It's the biggest thing I've ever seen in the way of cheese,''
John Watson said of the 40,060-pound block of cheddar. ``It looks a
little moldy on the top but that doesn't hurt cheese.''
   The immense milk curd, listed as the world's largest cheese by
the Guinness Book of World Records, has been touring the country
since May as a promotion for an Oklahoma City food company. It
stopped at a supermarket in Beckley, about 50 miles southeast of
Charleston, on Monday.
   ``It doesn't look like it weighs 40,000 pounds,'' said Florence
Church. ``But wouldn't it make a lot of lovely cheeseburgers?''
   Even 6-year-old Ashley Skeens was impressed.
   ``I hate cheese. I just wanted to look at it,'' Ashley said.
   Pat Patterson, the truck driver who is carting the cheese named
Belle of Wisconsin, said it will be sliced and sold in commemorative
packages when the tour ends.

   Radio announcer Dennis Heart broadcast a
wedding proposal to his girlfriend Joann on his morning show, then
found he had to sort out the responses.
   Several women named Joann phoned in to accept his offer. What's
more, ``We had two women call who said they'd be willing to change
their name to Joann,'' said Anita Lynn, the show's newscaster on
station WKGR.
   Joann Mileni, who lives with Heart in this town just west of Palm
Beach, was driving near Boca Raton when she heard the proposal
Monday morning. But rather than call in with her answer, she headed
straight for the station's Fort Pierce studio about 60 miles up the
coast.
   ``I've been doing some soul searching,'' Heart said, as the theme
song from Romeo and Juliet played in the background. ``I've just
been going through the James Brown and Aretha Franklin records last
night. As ... you know, I've been involved with my lady Joann for
almost a year, and I thought I'd take this time to ask her to marry
me.''
   Nearly an hour later, Ms. Mileni walked in the studio and
accepted, but only after Heart repeated the proposal on his knees.

<HEAD>Dissatisfied Boat Owner Flies High With Message</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unhappy boat owner is going to unusual heights in
his one-man war against a Washington-state boat maker.
   ``Want trouble? Buy my Tollycraft!'' reads a giant sign pulled by
a plane over the Miami Boat Show every afternoon since last
Wednesday.
   Henry A. Leonard is paying $3,000 to fly the sign for a week in
his latest effort to get the Tollycraft company to reimburse him for
his 34-foot boat, which he claims has a defective hull.
   Leonard, a commercial property appraiser from Tarrytown, N.Y.,
also has been at dockside wearing a T-shirt that says ``My
Tollycraft is garbage'' and handing out a flier that says ``My
Tollycraft is a lemon.''
   He says he has spent between $25,000 and $30,000 at boat shows in
three states and in legal fees on a pending New York lawsuit in
which he seeks about $180,000 in reimbursement for what he claims to
have spent on the boat.
   ``I don't care how much it costs if I can stop one person from
being hurt,'' he said.
   Tollycraft representatives declined comment on Leonard, but the
company has responded with its own campaign after failing to get a
federal judge in New York to stop Leonard's on grounds it is
defamatory.
   A flier prepared by Tollycraft's attorney accuses Leonard of
trying to coerce the company into meeting his outrageous demands.
   According to the flier, Leonard has refused to allow the company
to fix the problem and has sued demanding that it ``refund his
purchase price, plus every penny he has ever spent on the boat, down
to fuel and electricity.''
   Leonard also ran an advertisement in The New York Times.
   ``Nightmare for sale,'' the ad said. ``Trouble from day one,
thousands spent attempting to repair ... make offer. The owner
assumes no responsibility.''

<HEAD>Navajo Chairman Reinstated _ By His Brother-in-Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald, ousted
last week by the tribal council, has been reinstated by order of his
brother-in-law, a tribal judge.
   Tribal Judge Harry Brown issued a temporary restraining order
Tuesday overturning the council's ouster of MacDonald, who has been
accused of corruption, and Vice Chairman Johnny Thompson.
   A short time later, Thompson presented the court order to the
council and was seated as chairman pro tem in MacDonald's absence.
The council then recessed its winter meeting until today.
   Geoffrey Standing Bear, MacDonald's attorney, said Brown
scheduled a show-cause hearing Friday morning to determine whether
to permanently order the council not to place MacDonald and Thompson
on administrative leave.
   Brown found that the council failed to follow the correct
procedure for removing a chairman from office last Friday, when it
voted 49-13 against MacDonald and Thompson, Standing Bear said.
   ``The chairman is entitled to his constitutional rights,'' he
added.
   John Chapela, a lawyer who heads a recall movement against
MacDonald, complained that the order was issued in Kayenta, about
140 miles from the tribal capital of Window Rock.
   ``Legal matters affecting the Navajo Tribe have to brought before
the Window Rock court,'' Chapela said. ``Otherwise, it would look as
if people were shopping around to find the most favorable court.''
   Standing Bear said he avoided the Window Rock court because
Navajo Tribal Police Chief Bill Kellogg suggested that there was
``potential for unrest'' there.
   Noting that Brown and MacDonald are married to sisters, Standing
Bear said Brown anticipated handing over the case to another judge
if challenged.
   Members of MacDonald's staff said the chairman was in Window Rock
but chose not to attend the tribal council meeting.
   The previous week's action against MacDonald and Thompson
followed congressional testimony that MacDonald shared in a Phoenix
oilman's $7.2 million profit from the sale of the Big Boquillas
Ranch to the tribe.
   Thompson was not implicated in the alleged under-the-counter
dealings.
   The Navajo chairman receives $55,000 a year for running the
nation's largest Indian tribe, with an estimated 200,000 members,
including 170,000 living on the reservation.

   A sharp earthquake struck beneath the
Pacific Ocean about 120 miles southwest of Alaska but apparently
went unnoticed early today, officials said.
   Alec Medbery of the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center said the
temblor hit at 1:25 a.m., registering 5.8 on the open-ended Richter
scale.
   Medbery said he called the National Weather Service station in
Kodiak at the state's southern edge but was told no one there felt
the quake, and the observatory received no calls of inquiry or
reports of damage.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion in which every
increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. A
reading of 6.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of
5.5.
   A quake of 5 can cause considerable damage and one registering 6
is capable of causing severe damage.
   The 1964 Alaska quake that killed 131 people measured 8.4 on the
Richter scale.

<HEAD>Former Moscow Party Chief Boris Yeltsin Wins Place On National Ballot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boris Yeltsin, the ousted Moscow Communist Party
chief and outspoken critic of party conservatives, won a spot today
on the ballot to represent the capital in the new national
legislature, Radio Moscow said.
   Yeltsin, who lost the party job in November 1987 after
complaining about the slow pace of reform, received 532 votes at an
electoral committee meeting that ended before dawn at the ornate
House of Unions in downtown Moscow.
   Yevgeny Brakov, director of the giant ZIL automotive plant,
received 570 votes and will compete with Yeltsin for one spot in the
March 26 elections.
   Both were chosen by committee members from a field of 10
potential candidates to represent Moscow.
   The committee made its decision after the two candidates
presented campaign platforms in the chandelier-lit red-and-white
Hall of Columns.
   Yeltsin, 57, and Brakov ``both support restructuring and
democratization, but propose different solutions to specific
problems,'' the radio said.
   Under an law approved in December, two-third of the seats in the
new 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies will be filled by
candidates nominated in the workplace and chosen by voters on a
territorial basis.
   The rest of the deputies are to be chosen by party, union,
professional and other officially recognized groups.
   The new congress will meet annually and choose the Soviet
president and members of a new, smaller and more active sitting
parliament.
   Yeltsin told the committee members before they approved his
candidacy that he staunchly supports President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policies, both at home and abroad.
   ``From the viewpoint of the strategy of external politics, I
fully support him,'' he said in a seven-minute speech interrupted
six times by applause. ``From the viewpoint of the strategy of
internal politics, fully.''
   But, he said, ``from the viewpoint of tactics, I have my own
opinion.''
   Brakov, 51, presented a mainstream program, also supporting
Gorbachev's reforms and focusing on the need for better supplies of
food and consumer goods, a line more likely to be acceptable to
Communist Party officials.
   He was nominated by 33 workers' groups compared to 19 for Yeltsin.
   Because election law permits candidates to be nominated in more
than one geographical area early in the campaign, Yeltsin also has
been nominated in Sverdlovsk, where he could stand a better chance
of election.
   Until he was removed as a non-voting member of the ruling
Communist Party Politburo a year ago, Yeltsin was one of the
strongest backers of Gorbachev's policies of perestroika and
glasnost, or openness.
   At the time, Gorbachev accused him of being overly ambitious and
blaming others for his mistakes.
   Hospitalized with heart trouble after he was sacked as the Moscow
party chief, Yeltsin said at the meeting that he was ``physically
healthy and ready to fight.''

<TEXT>
   Two rap music groups nominated for Grammy
Awards say they are boycotting tonight's ceremonies because they are
insulted their new category was shunted off the the live television
broadcast.
   ``The real Grammy award is the chance to appear on the Grammy
Awards show, with its audience of 100 million Americans,'' said Will
``Fresh Prince'' Smith in a statement. ``Rap music is simply too big
to be overlooked like this.''
   The categories of rap and heavy metal were added to the 76
divisions of awards for the CBS-TV show, the 31st edition of the
Grammys. The show is hosted by Billy Crystal and produced by Pierre
Cossette.
   Folksinger Tracy Chapman and vocal gymnast Bobby McFerrin lead
the nominees. If Miss Chapman sweeps in her six nominated
categories, she will be the first artist to win six trophies in one
night since Roger Miller did it in 1966 for his single ``King of the
Road.''
   Fifteen of the awards are being televised, including the hard
rock and heavy metal for which the group Metallica is a nominee
along with Iggy Pop, Jane's Addiction, Jethro Tull and AC@DC.
   There will be a rap performance by Kool Moe Dee, but that award
category will be called during the usually fast-paced pre-televised
ceremony in which most of the awards are given.
   Rappers say it's an insult, and at least two nominated duos,
Salt-N-Pepa and DJ Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince, plan to boycott
the show.
   Among other musicians slated to perform are Whitney Houston, the
Manhattan Transfer, Luther Vandross, Kool Moe Dee, Sinead O'Connor,
Linda Ronstadt, Melissa Etheridge, Toni Childs, Tracy Chapman and
Itzhak Perlman.
   Special tributes also were set for jazz, country and western and
gospel music.
   Metallica is set to perform their new single ``One,'' from the
nominated album ``...And Justice For All.'' The group is popular
with heavy metal fans, but the band's uncompromising lyrics have
kept it from the wider radio airplay enjoyed by hard rock groups
like Bon Jovi.
   No one was more surprised than Metallica members to learn they
had been asked to perform, one member said.
   ``We've been very stubborn to make sure things would be done our
way and that we wouldn't have to give up creative control,''
Metallica member Lars Ulrich told The Associated Press.
   ``It's great we have been able to take this attitude all the way
to performing live on the Grammys and to be nominated, knowing it's
all being done on our terms,'' he said.
   For the top nominees, Miss Chapman was named in the best song,
record and female pop performance categories for ``Fast Car.'' She
also was nominated for best new artist, and her self-titled album
was nominated for the year's best LP and best contemporary folk
performance.
   McFerrin, already a Grammy veteran with five awards, had
nominations for best song, record and pop male vocal for ``Don't
Worry, Be Happy,'' his No. 1 single. McFerrin, who uses no
instrument except his own voice and body, also was nominated for
best male jazz vocal performance for the song ``Brothers'' and a
best album nomination for ``Simple Pleasures.''
   Another contender for top awards was singer Anita Baker with four
nominations for her one eligible song, ``Giving You The Best That I
Got,'' which competed with Miss Chapman and McFerrin in the record
and song categories. The tune also received best female rhythm and
blues performance and best overall rhythm and blues song performance.

   The dollar was steady in quiet European trading
late this morning. Gold prices rose strongly.
   Foreign exchange traders said they expected the dollar to remain
stable in lackluster trading over the next few days as the market
tried to sort out the implications of U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan's Congressional testimony.
   Greenspan was scheduled for a second day of testimony today, but
traders said they didn't expect it to give them a new lead.
   ``What he had to say, he has said,'' one Rome trader said.
   The dollar gained potential support from Greenspan's indication
that because of inflationary pressures he wouldn't lower interest
rates any time soon. But at the same time, he predicted only modest
growth for the U.S. economy, indicating little fear the economy is
overheating.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, which fell
to $1.7455 from $1.7565 Tuesday.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.8406 West German marks, down from 1.8420
   _1.5695 Swiss francs, up from 1.5685
   _6.2725 French francs, down from 6.2735
   _2.0767 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0910
   _1,351.50 Italian lire, down from 1,356.00
   _1.1965 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1897
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.53 yen to a closing 126.62 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 126.85 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $385.40 a troy ounce, up
from $380.75 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning today, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $386.00.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $385.90, up from $383.00 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.17 to close at a bid $387.51.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $5.94 a troy
ounce, up from Tuesday's $5.93.

<DATELINE>CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The company representing the disbanded
Beatles has sued Apple Computer Inc. challenging its use of the
``apple'' trademark on some of its products, a newspaper reported.
   In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in London, Apple Corps Ltd. accused
the Silicon Valley computer company of violating a secret 1981
agreement under which the Beatles' company allowed Apple Computer to
use the trademark on computer products, the San Francisco Chronicle
reported.
   The agreement retained the right of Apple Corps to use the fruit
as a trademark in its music business, and Apple Computer promised
not to enter that field, according to the Chronicle, which said a
draft copy of the lawsuit was filed in the chancery division of
Britain's High Court of Justice.
   Over the past few years, however, the computer company has
developed top-selling new hardware with music synthesizing
capabilities, and the Beatles' company claims those products break
Apple Computer's promise.
   The lawsuit asks the court for an injunction to bar Apple
Computer from breaching the agreement and seeks unspecified damages,
legal fees and interest.
   The computer company, however, does not believe it is in breach
of the agreement, a company spokeswoman said. But company officials
would not comment in detail on the suit because they had not yet
seen it, she said.
   Under the agreement reached in November 1981, Apple Computer,
founded in 1977, paid the Beatles an unknown amount for the right to
keep using its famous apple trademark.
   Apple Corps had been founded ten years earlier and its activities
included releases under the Apple label and a chain of clothing
stores.
   Steve Wozniak, a co-founder of Apple Computer, said on Tuesday he
was not aware of the agreement.
   ``I never heard anything about a fuss over the name,'' said
Wozniak, who is no longer associated with Apple Computer.
   The other co-founder was Steve Jobs and some company histories
trace the name to his recollections of working in the Oregon apple
country where he became convinced apples are a perfect food.
   The Beatles pop group broke up in 1970, but the London-based
company still represents the busines interests of the three
surviving members of the Beatles and the estate of the late John
Lennon.
   Wayne Cooper, a San Francisco lawyer representing the Beatles'
company in the dispute, said negotiations between Apple Corps and
the computer company broke down at a meeting in London Feb. 13.

   Security checks intensified today after the
discovery of two projectiles on launchers aimed at the runway of a
Tokyo airport where dignitaries have begun arriving for Emperor
Hirohito's funeral, officials said.
   An unprecedented number of foreign dignitaries are streaming into
Japan for Friday's state funeral for Hirohito, which radical groups
have threatened to disrupt.
   On Tuesday, police discovered timers set on two mortar-like
projectiles on explosive-charged launchers aimed at the runway at
Narita airport. Police would not disclose when the projectiles were
set for launching.
   As a result, authorities stepped up security at Narita and Haneda
airports, where 71 foreign delegations were to arrive today.
   In all, dignitaries representing 163 countries were expected for
the funeral, including President Bush, who arrives Thursday.
   The launchers apparently were set by radicals, but local news
reports said today that the projectiles themselves did not contain
explosive charges. The weapons were discovered in a field about 650
yards from the southern tip of the airport. A Foreign Ministry
official said the launchers were 36 inches long and the projectiles
8 inches long and 2 inches in diameter.
   Similar projectiles were launched in April 1986, apparently in an
attempt to disrupt plans for celebrating the 60th year of Emperor
Hirohito's reign, and in May 1986, when the leaders of seven major
industralized democracies were meeting in Tokyo.
   Today was the first day for a series of ``funeral diplomacy''
meetings with world leaders in Tokyo preceding the funeral of
Hirohito, who died Jan. 7 at age 87 after a 62-year reign.
   Strict personal and luggage inspections were enforced today at
Narita airport and 7,000 uniformed and plainclothed police patrolled
the area.
   Passenger luggage underwent double-checks, and the Kyodo News
Service reported a security effort more intense than that at the
Seoul Olympics.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita met with Finnish President Mauno
Koivisto at the Akasaka State Guesthouse and was scheduled to meet
separately with Soviet Vice President Anatoly Lukyanov and President
Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire later today.
   Takeshita will meet with about 40 of the 55 heads of state who
will attend the funeral, including Bush and President Francois
Mitterrand of France.
   Leftist groups opposed to the monarchy have vowed to disrupt the
funeral and one hinted it might launch a bomb attack to disrupt the
funeral but said a direct attack on the ceremonies of the 13-hour
funeral would be difficult because of the 32,000-strong police force
that will guard it.
   A spokesman for Kakurokyo, or the Revolutionary Workers's

<HEAD>Showers, Warm Temperatures Along East Coast; Arctic Air Hits Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms dampened the Atlantic Coast from
Florida to New Jersey early today and another wave of cold arctic
air began pouring into the Midwest.
   The thunderstorms and heaviest rain were concentrated over
Florida, where several cities recorded over half an inch of rain
Tuesday evening and early today.
   Mild weather accompanied the coastal rain, with early morning
temperatures in the 50s as far north as Boston.
   Nine Southeast cities tied or set new high temperature records
Tuesday. They included Norfolk, Va., where the temperature hit 76,
one degree above the old mark, just three days after the city was
buried by nearly a foot of snow.
   Cooler air prevailed west of the Appalachians. Arctic air flowed
into the northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley from Canada,
generating some snow along Lake Superior in Upper Michigan. A snow
and blowing snow advisory was in effect for the area with up to 6
inches expected.
   A mixture of freezing drizzle, sleet and snow glazed parts of
northeast Ohio Tuesday evening.
   Drier weather should bring some relief to flood-stricken
Kentucky, although there was a chance for some light drizzle or snow
flurries today.
   Clear skies prevailed over the Great Plains and much of the
southwest, and rain was reported over western portions of Washington
and Oregon.
   Today's forecast called for rain along much of the Atlantic
Coast, with thunderstorms in Florida, and rain in the Pacific
Northwest and northern California. Scattered snow was expected in
the eastern Great Lakes region, the central and northern
Appalachians and northern New England. Some snow also was expected
in Upper Michigan.
   Highs were forecast to be in the single digits and teens from the
northern Plains through the upper Mississippi Valley to the upper
Great Lakes; the 20s and 30s in Montana, the middle and lower
Missouri Valley, the middle Mississippi Valley, the Tennessee and
Ohio valleys and the lower Great Lakes area; the 60s from central
California to the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, and across northern
Florida and southeast Georgia; and the 70s and 80s in Southern
California, the Desert Southwest and southern Florida.
   Highs elsewhere were expected to be in the 40s and 50s.
   Temperatures at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 10 degrees below zero at
Warroad, Minn., to 77 degrees at Miami and Key West, Fla.
   Other reports:
   _East: Atlanta 47 cloudy; Boston 52 partly cloudy; Buffalo 31

<HEAD>Eric F. Goldman, Professor And Former Johnson Advisor, Dies At 73</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRINCETON BOROUGH, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eric F. Goldman, a Princeton
history professor and award-winning author who served as a special
consultant to President Lyndon B. Johnson, has died at the age of 73.
   Goldman, an authority on 20th century American history, died
Sunday at the Medical Center at Princeton. He was buried Monday.
   Through a long and distinguished career as a historian and
educator, Goldman won four honorary degrees and two national book
awards, and hosted a television program that won two Emmy awards.
   He is perhaps best known for the 1952 book ``Rendezvouz With
Destiny: A History Of Modern American Reform,'' which won the 1953
Bancroft Prize for ``distinguished writing in American history''
from Columbia University.
   The New York Times Book Review called the book ``one of the most
learned, most provocative and best written books in a long, long
time.''
   Goldman, a professor emeritus at Princeton University, began his
career there as an assistant professor in 1942. In 1962, he was
named the first Philip and Beulah Rollins professor of history. He
taught until his retirement in 1985.
   Goldman served as Special Consultant to the President in the
Johnson Administration from 1963-66 and drew on his experience to
write a critical account of the administration, ``The Tragedy of
Lyndon Johnson,'' published in 1969.
   After his short stint in government, Goldman contributed to many
scholarly and popular publications and was a staff writer for Time
magazine.
   From 1959 to 1967, he served as moderator of the NBC television
show ``The Open Mind,'' which won Emmies in 1962 and 1966.
   Goldman was married to Joanna Jackson Goldman, who died in 1980.

<HEAD>Soviet, Israeli Ministers Fail To Bridge Differences</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign ministers of the Soviet Union and
Israel met today for 2{ hours but failed to bridge differences on
how to peacefully resolve the Middle East crisis.
   Eduard Shevardnadze and his Israeli counterpart, Moshe Arens, met
at the Soviet Embassy overlooking the Nile River and agreed to
discuss their differences further at a later date. They didn't say
where or when.
   Shevardnadze, on a 10-day Middle East tour, told reporters
Tuesday he would try to persuade Israel to enter negotiations with
the Palestine Liberation Organization, which the Jewish state
considers a terrorist group.
   The Soviet Union severed ties with Israel after the 1967
Arab-Israeli war and has been a major Arab supporter. Tentative
Soviet-Israeli contacts began only recently, and both ministers
appeared to regret the long break in communication.
   ``The worst thing is not to have a dialogue,'' Shevardnadze said.
Arens referred to the ``long dry spell, 20 years, of not talking
together.''
   ``Our conclusion is that we want to meet some more,'' Arens said.
``We have to extend contacts. We have to find ways to present our
views. I think we are creating a basis for understanding, possibly
for agreement.''
   Today's talks with Arens, however, brought no breakthrough for
Shevardnadze to convey to PLO chairman Yasser Arafat at a meeting
scheduled this evening.
   ``We cannot say that we have come to a solution on all aspects,
but that was not our expectation. To expect that would be naive,''
Shevardnadze said after the meeting.
   ``Fundamentally, we agreed to continue contacts at foreign
ministers' level and other levels,'' Shevardnadze added. ``There are
differences between us, different views, and we will continue
discussions.''
   Arens said Israel and the Soviet Union ``are in a process of
building a foundation of understanding.''
   He repeated Israel's position on the need for direct talks with
Arab partners on peace.
   ``Israel made peace, salaam, with Egypt,'' Arens said. ``If the
rest of the Arab world followed Egypt's example and made direct
contacts, we will have peace.'' Egypt and Israel signed a peace
treaty in 1979, the only one between an Arab country and the Jewish
state.
   The Soviet minister noted Israeli's importance in bringing peace
to the region.
   ``The state of Israel is a most important factor in the
settlement. Without good will from Israel, there can be no solution
for the problem. Another aspect is that without the Soviet Union,
also no peace,'' Shevardnadze said.
   He said that Soviet-Israeli experts would meet in a few days to
discuss the issues in depth.
   Neither minister referred to speculation the Cairo meeting could
set the stage for restoration of relations between the Soviet Union
and Israel.
   Yasser Abed-Rabbo, head of the PLO's information department and a
member of the organization's 15-man Executive Committee, said the
Soviets should not renew relations unless Israel accepts an
international conference.
   Like the Arabs, the Soviet Union wants an international peace
conference sponsored by the United Nations, which would be attended
by the PLO and other regional parties as well as the five permanent
members of the Security Council.
   Israel opposes this, fearing such a conference would be
prejudiced against it, but Israel has said it would accept a
conference under the aegis of the Soviet Union and the United States.
   Shevardnadze said that even had he agreed with Arens on an
international peace conference, that would not mean the conference
would be held immediately.
   He said the Soviet Union is discussing the Middle East with the
United States and that the subject will figure in his scheduled
March 6 meeting with U.S. Secretary of State James Baker III.
   ``I am a natural optimist. This is the only way,'' Shevardnadze
said. ``The conflict has to be resolved.''
   Arens flew home early this afternoon. Arafat arrived about half
an hour later to meet with the Soviet minister.

<HEAD>Zoo Finds Second Egg Laid By Endangered Birds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two eggs laid by captive pairs of endangered
California condors have been placed in incubation while anxious
scientists wait to learn whether either one is fertile, zoo
officials said.
   The newest egg, discovered Tuesday at the San Diego Wild Animal
Park, was produced by condors UN1 and AC4 one day after an egg was
found at the state's other breeding station at the Los Angeles Zoo,
park spokesman Tom Hanscom said.
   ``We've had in hand 18 eggs and this one is on the small side,
but we've seen healthy birds hatch from smaller eggs,'' he said.
   Both eggs must incubate for about a week before keepers will be
able to tell whether they're fertile. If so, a chick could hatch in
about two months if there are no complications, officials said.
   The egg found Monday at the Los Angeles Zoo was removed Tuesday
from the plywood nest box of male Cuyama and female Cachuma when
both vultures were away from it, zoo spokeswoman Lora LaMarca said.
   The 8{-ounce egg, about 5 inches long and 3 inches wide, was
placed in a padded wooden box with hot water bottles to keep it warm
during the trip to the state's other condor breeding station at the
Wild Animal Park.
   The egg was transferred to the northern San Diego County park
because the Los Angeles Zoo is installing new incubation facilities,
LaMarca said.
   Dr. Mike Wallace, curator of birds at Los Angeles Zoo, said after
the egg was laid Monday that he hoped to collect as many as three
eggs from Cuyama and Cachuma during the January through April laying
season.
   The condors recycle their mating habits if their nest loses an
egg, and the female usually takes a month to produce another egg, he
said.
   All 28 California condors known to remain alive are in captivity,
half at the Los Angeles Zoo and half at the Wild Animal Park near
Escondido. The condor eggs discovered this week are among the only
three laid in captivity.

   Burt Reynolds returned to the small screen last
week, and television viewers were apparently mighty pleased.
   His two-hour movie ``B.L. Stryker,'' part of ABC's rotating
``Mystery Movie,'' ranked 13th in the weekly A.C. Nielsen ratings.
That's better than the other two movies in the series _ Peter Falk's
``Columbo,'' which had stiff competition from CBS' ``Lonesome
Dove,'' and ``Gideon Oliver,'' which premiered Monday night.
   Last week was uneventful, despite being part of the February
sweep _ one of four months a year when local stations' ratings are
measured and networks pile on the specials to help affiliates. There
wasn't a movie or miniseries in the top 10, and NBC's series won the
week.
   Without big events, viewing numbers were back down slightly below
normal. The three networks had a combined audience share _
percentage of sets in use _ of 67. The season average has been 68.
Three-network shares had soared into the 80s earlier this month for
``Lonesome Dove.''
   Next to ``B.L. Stryker,'' NBC had the highest-rated movie of the
week, ``Swimsuit,'' at 20th. The first part of ABC's ``Passion and
Paradise'' two-parter did not inspire passionate ratings. It ranked
51st.
   NBC made it 35 in a row after winning the week ending Feb. 19
with an average, prime-time Nielsen rating of 16.2. CBS had a 13.1
and ABC 12.2. Each rating point represents 904,000 households with
televisions.
   The top-rated shows of the week were: ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC,
with a rating of 26.2 and a 41 share; ``A Different World,'' NBC;
``60 Minutes,'' CBS; ``Golden Girls,'' NBC; ``Cheers,'' NBC;
``Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS; ``Roseanne,'' ABC; ``L.A. Law,'' NBC;
``Empty Nest,'' NBC; and ``Hunter,'' NBC, tied with ``Who's the
Boss?'' ABC.
   The lowest-rated were: ``A Man Called Hawk,'' ``Tour of Duty,''
``Dolphin Cove,'' ``West 57th,'' ``Almost Grown,'' ``Smothers
Brothers,'' ``Pete's Dragon,'' ``Murphy's Law,'' ``HeartBeat'' and
``A Fine Romance.''
   The ``CBS Evening News'' continued to win in the news race. Last
week's numbers couldn't have been much closer, though, with
four-tenths of a rating point separating the three broadcasts. CBS
had an 11.5 and 20 share; ``ABC World News Tonight'' had an 11.3 and
20; ``NBC Nightly News'' had an 11.1. and 20.

<TEXT>
   A man was charged in 13 break-ins at
churches and day-care centers after he was found hiding in a church
closet wearing disposable diapers, police said.
   James Phipps Davis, 35, of Greensboro, is charged with breaking
into four churches and a day-care center between Dec. 23 and Feb.
15, when he was caught hiding inside a church closet.
   The break-in spree began one day after Davis was released from
the state prison unit in McLeansville, where he served time for a
break-in conviction. The facilities reported food and small items
missing, including baby bottles, blankets and disposable diapers.
   At Church of the Covenant Presbyterian, a church member entering
the nursery about 6 a.m. Jan. 28 discovered a man sleeping in a crib
with a baby blanket and toys. The startled intruder awoke and fled
through a window.
   Davis was arrested Feb. 15 after a police sergeant spotted a man
entering College Place United Methodist Church through a window. He
was found in a closet wearing the diapers and holding a pocketknife,
said police detective L.E. Baulding.
   Davis was arrested and charged with 13 counts of felony breaking
and entering, one count of breaking into a car, and one count of
withholding a credit card. The last two charges stem from the theft
of a purse from a car near Davis' home.
   The morning after her car was broken into, the owner found a
diaper swaddled around a sawhorse in her yard, Baulding said.
   When arrested, Davis was carrying a bag with dozens of photos of
infants cut from magazines, Baulding said.
   ``He told me he wanted to talk to the infants to tell them he had
had a tough life and that they should be good,'' Baulding told The
Greensboro News &amp; Record.
   Davis is being held at the Guilford County Jail under $50,000
bond.

   Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
said today the Western reaction to his execution order against
author Salman Rushdie proves that opening Iranian contacts to the
rest of the world was wrong.
   Khomeini also lashed out at the ``liberals'' or pragmatists in
the Islamic republic, who support greater contacts with other
nations, and vowed he would never cede power to them.
   ``At the beginning of the revolution we gave posts to people who
were not totally with us in ideology and the bitter results of that
are plainly evident,'' Khomeini was quoted as saying by Tehran Radio.
   ``As long as I am here I will not let the government fall into
the hands of the liberals,'' Khomeini said.
   He did not mention anyone by name. Parliament speaker Hashemi
Rafasnjani and President Ali Khamenei are leaders of what is
perceived as the pragmatic faction in government.
   Publication of Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses'' was a sign from
God that policies supported by the liberals will not work, the
patriarch said.
   ``Those who believe that if we act in a pragmatic way they (the
East and West) will humanely reciprocate and will respect the
nation, Islam and Moslems, to them this is an example,'' Khomeini
said.
   ``God wanted it to happen in this way so that we may no longer
think in simplistic ways,'' he said.
   Excerpts of the speech were carried on Tehran Radio and monitored
in Nicosia.
   Khomeini warned that economic sanctions against Iran will not
sway his death ruling against Rushdie, who lives in London and has
been in hiding since the execution order was given Feb. 14.
   The European Community, Norway, Sweden and Canada have withdrawn
their envoys to Tehran.
   Several other European countries have threatened to cancel visits
by trade delegations, and President Bush noted the American
sanctions already in place when asked about U.S. reaction to the
execution order.
   A West German television station reported today that the Cabinet
was considering economic sanctions because of the Rushdie death
threat. West Germany is Iran's most important trading partner.
   The pragmatists in Iran say its future development hinges on more
freedom inside the country and greater contact with other nations.
   In addition to foreign expertise and perhaps financing needed for
postwar reconstruction, the pragmatists have said Iran needs more
liberal policies internally so the society could develop in a
high-tech era.
   Their efforts to open Iranian contacts with the rest of the world
since the August cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war have been
undermined by Khomeini's death sentence.
   When Khamenei said on Friday that Rushdie might be pardoned if he
apologized, Khomeini quickly reaffirmed the execution order.
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes their religion by
portraying the prophet Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and
suggesting that he wrote the Koran, the holy book of Islam, rather
than receiving it from God.
   Khameini, ending a three-day visit to Yugoslavia, said in a news
conference in Belgrade that the concept of freedom of speech should
not be confused with freedom to insult the more than 1 billion
Moslems throughout the world.
   ``Over the past few days, we have been witnessing a very ugly
event which will in all likelihood continue to excite public and
Moslem opinion throughout the world,'' Khamenei said in remarks
carried by the official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia.
   Khamenei said Western governments could not profess belief in
freedom of speech at the same as accepting the insult to all
Moslems, IRNA reported.
   ``There is no solution to the Rushdie affair,'' the president
said. ``An arrow has been shot and is unerringly aimed at its
target.''

<HEAD>Law Gives China Broad AIDS-Testing Authority</HEAD>

   A new law authorizes health officials to order
AIDS tests for any Chinese deemed at risk of contracting the disease
and to place all sufferers in quarantine, officials at the Public
Health Ministry said today.
   Sun Xinhua of the ministry's Disease Prevention Department said
major eastern cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Canton,
already have begun sample testing of Chinese whose jobs bring them
into contact with foreigners, such as hotel workers and tour guides.
   Sun said that under the new law, ``if local authorities want
someone to be tested, he must be tested. He has no right to refuse.''
   He said authorities also might order testing of people who came
into contact with a known AIDS sufferer, and they too ``would have
no right to refuse.''
   Nan Junhua, another official in the same department who helped
draft the law, said it gave the government authority to test the
country's entire 1.09 billion people if need be. But he said
widespread testing was not needed because few Chinese are at any
risk of being exposed to acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``If any Chinese is found to be an AIDS sufferer, he will be
quarantined and will not be allowed to continue working or going to
school,'' Nan said. More than a dozen foreigners have been expelled
over the last few years after it was discovered they had AIDS or had
been exposed to it.
   China, which is practically AIDS-free, has stressed erecting
barriers to the AIDS virus entering the country rather than testing
its own people.
   However, as China's traditional mores against casual sex have
weakened and other sexually transmitted diseases such as gonhorrea
have reappeared, some medical experts have pressed for wider AIDS
testing.
   Only two Chinese are known to have died from AIDS: a man who had
visited New York and a hemophiliac boy who reportedly was infected
by an imported blood product. Four other Chinese who used imported
blood products have tested positive for the virus but have not
developed the disease.
   China since has banned imports of blood products. Last year it
began requiring Chinese who return after more than a year abroad to
be tested for AIDS. Foreigners who come to China for more than a
year also must be tested.
   No cure has been found for AIDS, which is caused by a virus that
attacks the body's immune system, leaving it vulnerable to
infections. The virus most often is transmitted through sexual
contact, contaminated blood or sharing contaminated hypodermic
needles.
   China's new Infectious Disease Prevention Law takes effect in
September. It was approved Tuesday by the National People's
Congress' 135-member Standing Committee, which meets between annual
sessions of the full congress.
   In addition to AIDS, the law's testing mandate also covers the
plague, cholera and 34 other infectious diseases. Sun said China
previously had only administrative regulations covering infectious
disease testing and treatment.

   The city's new law banning ownership of
semiautomatic assault weapons will hurt law-abiding gun owners more
than criminals, gun control opponents complained.
   ``Over the next couple of weeks, I think you will find a lot of
spontaneous outrage to it by gun owners and sportsmen,'' said
Charles H. Cunningham, Ohio liaison for the National Rifle
Association. He said Tuesday the NRA's legal branch would soon
review the ordinance.
   Several cities passed laws banning semiautomatic weapons after a
gunman used an assault rifle to kill five children and wound 30
other people at a school playground in Stockton, Calif. on Jan. 17.
   Wilmette, Ill., became only the fifth municipality in the nation
to ban handguns when its village board unanimously adopted such an
ordinance Tuesday. The ordinance requires handgun owners to turn
their weapons into police for safekeeping. They could reclaim them
if they move out of the Chicago suburb.
   The Cleveland City Council passed the ordinance 20-0 Friday. City
Law Director Marilyn Zack signed it into law Tuesday as acting mayor
in the absence of Mayor George V. Voinovich, who is vacationing. She
also signed into law, with the mayor's approval, an ordinance
allowing some police officers to carry 9mm pistols, a more potent
weapon than the ones police now carry.
   The City Council passed both gun measures after a public hearing
in which police made a plea for help in their struggle against drug
traffickers.
   At a news conference Tuesday to voice concern about the gun law,
William Bash, technical adviser to the Sportsmen and Firearms
Counsel, estimated that more than 75 percent of city gun owners
would be affected by the change.
   Police Commander Robert Bolton said a common gun that would fall
under the new law's restrictions would be a semiautomatic action,
center-fire rifle or carbine that accepts a detachable magazine with
a capacity or 20 rounds or more.
   Other guns banned are semiautomatic shotguns with a magazine
capacity of more than six rounds and semiautomatic handguns that are
designed to accept a detachable magazine holding more that 20
bullets.
   Richard Horvath, an attorney for the city, said gun owners will
have until March 3 to take their guns out of Cleveland or make them
inoperable.
   Under a mandatory sentence provision, a violation is a
first-degree misdemeanor that calls for six months in jail and a
$1,000 fine.

   An official Chinese newspaper today accused
Japan's prime minister of trying to whitewash Japanese aggression
during World War II.
   Japan's ambassador to China apologized for any misunderstanding
over Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's statement and said Japan
recognized the great harm it inflicted on other Asian countries
during the war.
   The China Daily commentary criticized Takeshita's speech last
week to Japan's Parliament, in which he said future historians must
decide whether Japan was the aggressor in the war.
   The newspaper said it was surprised that Takeshita ``should make
such cynical utterances'' and ``would rather resort to sophistry
than speak the truth.''
   ``Such an absurd approach to such an important issue by a
Japanese leader will smear the image of Japan as a trustworthy
member of the world community and may lead the Japanese people
astray once more,'' the commentary said.
   ``It often happens that we have friends who bow deeply and smile
courteously and talk nicely at meeting you. But their friendship
proves dubious by their actions behind your back.''
   On Monday, a Chinese legislator accused Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita of ``a gross deception that nobody will believe.''
   More than 10 million Chinese lost their lives during Japan's
1937-45 invasion of the Chinese mainland.
   Japanese Ambassador Toshijiro Nakajima, in a meeting with Vice
Foreign Minister Liu Shuqing, today expressed regret that
Takeshita's comments had not been correctly conveyed.
   Liu said China acted with restraint in responding to Takeshita's
statement, but may not be so tolerant if such pronouncements are
made again in the future.
   Japanese sources said Nakajima went to the Foreign Ministry on
orders of Takeshita to clarify the Japanese position.
   The sources said Nakajima said Japan caused serious harm to its
Asian neighbors during the war and must recognize that it is
regarded internationally as the aggressor.
   Under a communique issued when diplomatic ties were established
in 1972, Japan accepted responsibility for the wartime suffering it
caused.
   The China Daily commentary was written by Zhang Huimin, head of
its opinion page.
   He said, ``We are willing to let bygones be bygones and make
friends with the Japanese so long as they repent of their past
behavior.''
   But, he said, those ``recalcitrants'' who try to whitewash
Japan's past war crimes ``fill me with anger and repugnance, for
many shocking memories of the early years are still vivid in my
mind.''
   The writer related how as a child he hid ``terror-stricken,'' in
a cave during Japanese bombing raids and saw the ``gutted, charred
houses and heaps of rubble'' left by invading Japanese troops.
   Sino-Japanese relations today are generally good. Japan is
China's biggest trading partner outside Hong Kong and most important
source of foreign credit.
   Japan's chief government spokesman, Keizo Obuchi, said Monday
that Takeshita had spoken about the misery Japan caused to other
Asian countries during the war, and that there had been a
misunderstanding of his intentions when he said that future
historians should decide on Japan's role as an aggressor.

   Workers today were building a bridge
so vehicles could get to the remote, swampy site of a jet cargo
plane crash that presumably killed eight people, officials said.
   Four bodies have been removed from the wreckage of the C-141B
Starlifter plane that went down on a military reservation in the
Florida Panhandle, said Staff Sgt. Robert Pfenning, a spokesman at
Norton Air Force Base at San Bernardino, Calif., where the plane
departed Monday.
   Meanwhile, a special Air Force panel today is to open an
investigation of the Monday evening crash at the Eglin Air Force
Base Reservation.
   Victoria Hanson, a spokeswoman at Hurlburt Field, said more than
100 workers were building the bridge today. ``This should speed up
removal of the bodies,'' she said.
   Air Force civil engineers worked through the night to build a
half-mile dirt road to the site.
   The swampy terrain, thick brush and a series of thunderstorms
Tuesday hampered rescue and recovery efforts. Helicopters,
bulldozers and bridge-building equipment were used.
   The plane went down about four miles north of Hurlburt during its
final approach. No cause has been determined for the crash, which
occurred during sporadic thunderstorms and high wind, said Col.
Howard Oakes, an Eglin spokesman.
   Pfenning identified the plane's crewmen were Capt. Mark J.
Chambers, 30; Capt. John F. Young, 30; Master Sgt. Robert E. Wright
Jr., 37; Tech. Sgt. Ronald D. Grubbs, 29; Staff Sgt. Karl M. Kohler,
32; Airman 1st Class Scott D. Craig, 22; and Staff Sgt. John W.
Remerscheid, 33.
   Remerscheid was assigned to the 14th Military Airlift Squadron at
Norton. The others were assigned to the 52nd Military Airlift
Squadron at Norton. No hometowns were given.
   The eighth man was identified as retired Air Force Capt. John G.
Galvin of Jacksonville. Ms. Hanson said Galvin boarded during a
refueling stop at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado.
   The huge four-engine plane was on a regularly scheduled flight
and was to have gone on to Howard Air Base in Panama after picking
up cargo and personnel here.
   Oakes said the plane fell short of the runway, cleared a 200-yard
swath through woods and ended up nose-down in a swamp.

<HEAD>Former Sheriff Files Suit Over `Mississippi Burning' Movie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON HARRIST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former sheriff has filed an $8 million
libel suit against the makers of the movie ``Mississippi Burning,''
claiming he was portrayed unfavorably in the film.
   ``They have sure done some terrible harm,'' the former Neshoba
County sheriff, Lawrence Rainey, 65, said today in a telephone
interview from his home in Meridian. ``Everybody all over the South
knows the one they have playing the sheriff in that movie is
referring to me.''
   Rainey, who now works for a black-owned security guard service,
was sheriff at the time of the 1964 slayings of three civil rights
workers near Philadelphia. The deaths prompted an FBI investigations
that led to conspiracy charges being filed against 18 men, including
Rainey, who was later acquitted.
   The movie, an Orion Pictures release, is a fictional account of
the slayings of Michael Schwerner, James Chaney, and Andrew Goodman.
   The lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court at Meridian
charges ``defamation of character, libel and invasion of privacy,''
attorney James G. McIntyre said.
   McIntyre, who defended Rainey in the 1967 conspiracy trial,
described his client as ``a man trying to make a living the best way
he can, a man trying to live out his life peaceably.''
   A person answering the phone at Orion Pictures offices in New
York today said no one was immediately available for comment. Calls
to Orion's offices in Los Angeles were answered by a recording.
   McIntyre said he had received no response from Orion on his
demand several weeks ago that the makers correct what he described
as untruths in the film, including the actions of the sheriff at the
time.
   Rainey said the film falsely portrayed his activities and
attitude during the period and had wronged the people of Neshoba
County.
   ``What they said happened and what they did to me certainly
wasn't right and something ought to be done about it,'' the former
sheriff said.
   Rainey said he had been ``catching some playback'' from those who
had seen the film and his employer ``has been catching some of it
too.''
   The movie, directed by Alan Parker and starring Gene Hackman and
Willem Dafoe, has been criticized by some civil rights activists who
say it maligns blacks and portrays the FBI agents as heros.

<TEXT>
   Foreign trade failed to make headway in 1988 due to
production of shoddy goods, a fluctuating international economy and
a failure of joint ventures to perform as expected, a newspaper said
today.
   ``Last year did not see any considerable rise in Soviet foreign
trade, estimated at 132 billion rubles ($213.8 billion),'' the
Government Herald said.
   It said a drop in prices for basic fuel and raw materials and
growing protectionist trends in Western countries made international
markets unfavorable for Soviet goods over the past three years.
   The article, focusing on the problem of exporting goods, said
very few Soviet-made items were immune to the fluctuations of
international money markets.
   ``Meanwhile, Soviet industry continues producing planes,
vehicles, tractors and agricultural machines whose specifications
differ very little from previous models and which are inferior to
Western types,'' the Government Herald said.
   Economic relations with socialist states also proved
unsatisfactory, the newspaper said. ``New forms of cooperation have
not yet produced any returns, and direct ties between socialist
countries have turned into a means to exchange deficit items,'' it
said.
   Further compounding the foreign trade problem is the slow pace at
which joint ventures get under way, the newspaper said.
   Despite the economic promise of joint enterprises, ``business
circles in foreign countries tried to set up ventures which would
not require any substantial investments,'' the newspaper said.
   It said initial capital of 81 joint ventures out of a total of
192 proposed ranged from only $32,400 to $1.62 million.
   To revitalize foreign trade, the newspaper said it is necessary
to improve the ``fundamental democratization'' of foreign economic
ties and to introduce new methods of economic management.

   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency workers
will not return to the Fernald uranium processing plant because of
the risk of exposure to radioactivity, despite new assurances from
the operator, a spokeswoman said.
   The operator of the plant, which processes uranium for nuclear
weapons, says that the Feed Materials Production Center is safe and
that the urine sampling analyses it uses to test people for
radiation exposure are reliable.
   In addition, the tests have been vindicated by outside
laboratories, Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio announced Tuesday.
   The EPA made the decision last week after two of its inspectors,
including Catherine McCord, chief EPA inspector at the plant, were
contaminated with uranium in December while attending meetings at
the facility, which is 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati. The plant
is owned by the federal Energy Department.
   Anne Rowan, a spokeswoman in the EPA's Chicago regional office,
said the EPA had not seen Westinghouse's announcement about the
vindicated tests and was unfamiliar with it.
   ``We have not changed our position,'' Ms. Rowan said.
   She said the EPA is investigating its own testing methods, which
showed that its inspectors were exposed to uranium.
   The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency also is keeping
inspectors away from the plant until the exposure problems are
corrected.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega kicked off the
10-year anniversary of the uprising that brought his leftist
Sandinistas to power by saying the nation must not let its guard
down against U.S.-backed rebels.
   ``Reagan left; the revolution stayed,'' Ortega told 35,000 people
at a rally in Managua on Tuesday evening.
   Ortega was to meet today with opposition leaders to discuss
electoral reforms. He said the talks will center on the accord he
and the presidents of El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and
Guatemala signed Feb. 14 in El Salvador.
   He said the National Assembly on Feb. 28 will discuss freeing
more than 1,700 former soldiers who served under ousted President
Anastasio Somoza. He said 2,000 jailed rebels, known as Contras,
will be freed ``in the same measure that the Contra force is
dismantled.''
   ``As long as the Contras are there, the United States is there,
threatening,'' Ortega said. ``We cannot yet let our guard down.''
   Traditional cumbia music was played and uniformed civilians waved
flags and pictures of the man who gave their Sandinista movement its
name.
   The rally and a march began celebrations leading up to July 19,
the date marking 10 years since the Sandinistas entered the capital
after they toppled Somoza. The festivities also commemorated the
55th anniversary of the death of Augusto Cesar Sandino, a
nationalist general who was shot by U.S.-backed National Guard
troops on Feb. 21, 1934.
   One-third of the people at the rally Tuesday evening were dressed
in green military uniforms, including reservists, young men and
women in the mandatory military service, and regular army personnel.
   In a speech earlier Tuesday opening the National Assembly's fifth
session, Ortega said any electoral reform drawn up during talks with
the opposition ``will have to be debated, approved or disapproved at
this site.''
   During their meeting in El Salvador, the five Central American
presidents agreed that Nicaragua will institute democratic reforms,
such as giving equal air time to opposition parties, amnesty for
some political prisoners and including opposition representation in
the Supreme Electoral Council.
   Ortega also promised to move up elections to February 1990, 10
months earlier than scheduled.
   The presidents also agreed to draft a plan within 90 days to
dismantle the Nicaraguan rebel force now living in Honduran
territory.
   Through most of Reagan administration, the United States gave
arms to the Contras. In February 1988, Congress stopped military aid
and continued only humanitarian assistance to the Contras, 10,000 of
whom now live in camps in neighboring Honduras with about 10,000
relatives.

   About 175 people picketed the office of

editorials as anti-Semitic.
   The students on Tuesday chanted outside the Michigan Daily

   Among the editorials the protesters found offensive was one Feb.
14 suggesting Israelis may have planted the bomb that caused the
Dec. 21 crash of Pan Am Flight 103 in Scotland, killing 270 people.
   Amy Harmon, co-editor of the Opinion Page, said the paper opposes
Israeli policies toward Palestinians but is not anti-Jewish.

   Traffic jams flourished this week as
motorists jumped from their cars to scoop up thousands of $100 bills
apparently tossed from a car. But there was a catch: The money was
funny.
   In fact, the pale lime-green bills didn't look much better than
photocopies, but that didn't stop motorists Monday and Tuesday, as
they screeched to the side of roads and jumped out to get rich quick.
   ``It was a zoo. People were really frothing at the mouth,'' said
police Sgt. Ron Flathers. ``Since Benjamin Franklin's picture is on
the $100 (bill), we say it was raining Benjies from heaven.''
   The first cash storm was reported at 9 p.m. Monday when $50,000
to $100,000 was found along four miles of a parkway. A short time
later, about $10,000 in bills were reported fluttering along the
Costa Mesa Freeway.
   Then on Tuesday morning, $200,000 more littered the San Diego
Freeway in San Clemente.
   Secret Service agents are trying to learn the source of the money.

<TEXT>
   Communist authorities today
arrested a spokesman from the Charter 77 human rights group, a
dissident said, one day after a co-founder of the group was
sentenced to nine months in jail.
   Tomas Hradilek was detained in his hometown of Lipnik nad Becvou,
200 miles east of Prague, and charged with inciting rebellion and
damaging Czechoslovakia's image, said dissident Anna Sabatova.
   There was no official confirmation, but authorities in this
communist country do not routinely report arrests. If convicted,
Hradilek could be imprisoned up to five years, Ms. Sabatova said.
   The charges are based on two letters he wrote last month to
Communist Party chief Milos Jakes and to President Gustav Husak
protesting the violence police used to break up peaceful gatherings
in Prague.
   ``This is glasnost in Czechoslovakia,'' said fellow Charter 77
activist Vaclav Maly, referring to the greater openness Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev has advocated but which has failed to
take hold in Czechoslovakia.
   Maly said today's detention means all three spokesmen for the
movement are in police custody. Charter 77 _ the Soviet bloc's
oldest, unofficial human rights organization _ was formed in January
1977. It was named for the document issued by founding members
calling on Czech to respect civil liberties.
   Maly and Sabatova spoke to Western reporters outside the trial of
fellow Charter spokesman Alexander Vondra and six other dissidents
charged with hooliganism for trying to lay flowers in memory of
student Jan Palach on Jan. 16 at Prague's Wenceslas Square.
   Palach burned himself to death Jan. 16, 1969 to protest the 1968
Soviet-led invasion of his homeland that crushed a reform movement.
   Vaclav Havel, a prominent playwright and a Charter 77 founder,
was sentenced Tuesday to nine months in jail after he was convicted
of inciting people to attend the Jan. 16 memorial service, which
authorities contend was a demonstration.
   Later Tuesday, six members of an official human rights committee
held a first meeting with Western human rights campaigners and
members of the Charter 77 movement, state media and dissidents said
today.
   Representatives of Helsinki monitoring committees in four West
European countries and the United States attended the meeting, the
Communist Party daily Rude Pravo said in a brief report that did not
mention the Chartists' attendance.
   Maly, who also attended, said the discussion focused on changes
needed in Czechoslovak laws, in particular new rules that double to
a year the maximum jail penalty for violating public order laws.
   This week's detentions signal a crackdown by the communist rulers
on Charter 77 movement and leaders of other emerging independent
groups.
   The trial of the seven opened Tuesday and resumed today with
defendants repeatedly challenging police testimony.
   An eighth defendant, Charter 77 spokeswoman Dana Nemcova, is in a
hospital and will be tried separately.
   Judge Antonin Tesik, who four times has ordered the defense to
``shut up,'' denied a defense attorney's request to instruct
witnesses on perjury after one policeman testified that when the
dissidents were arrested ``the crowd applauded and called us (the
police) heroes.''
   Most Czechoslovaks were dismayed by the police action against
peaceful demonstrators.
   The defendants said they planned no demonstrations and intended
to leave the square after laying flowers.
   Information about the proceedings came from a Reuters
correspondent and a correspondent for Voice of America radio
station, who were the only foreign journalists allowed to attend.

<HEAD>Dade Metro Commission Passes Ordinance Against Window Washers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials hope the prospect of fines and jail will
wipe out the practice of washing car windshields and then begging
motorists for payment.
   Under a Dade County ordinance approved Tuesday by the Metro-Dade
Commission, people arrested for windshield washing along roadways
could face a $500 fine and up to 60 days in jail beginning next week.
   The ordinance is particularly aimed at Miami, where, as in other
cities, homeless people wash windshields of cars stopped at traffic
lights to earn spare change. Miami did not specifically outlaw the
practice, but police have arrested washers occasionally on charges
of impeding traffic.
   In August, the fatal shooting of a windshield washer by a Miami
police officer rekindled demands to rid the streets of the washers.
   A Dade Circuit Court judge will hear evidence today to determine
whether the officer acted properly. The officer claims he shot the
washer in self-defense when he lunged at him with a knife.
   ``Motorists in Dade are afraid of these men,'' said Metro-Dade
Commissioner Jorge Valdes, who sponsored the ordinance after he said
his wife was frightened when a washer approached their car.
   ``I think it's very important that we work for the public safety
of the citizens, no matter what the consequences,'' Valdes said.
   Commissioners Barbara Carey and Charles Dusseau voted against the
restriction. Both wanted the washers gone, but thought the penalties
too harsh.
   County Manager Joaquin Avino said it's unlikely that violators
would spend much time in jail.
   ``Cells are already too crowded with more serious criminals. ...
What you basically have is a revolving door,'' Avino said. ``They
would be booked and released on their own recognizance.''
   ``I think the ordinance will give enforcement more teeth,'' Miami
police spokesman Ray Lang said.

<HEAD>Court, in California Case, Says Party Leaders May Make Endorsements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States may not prohibit political party leaders
from endorsing primary election candidates, the Supreme Court ruled
today.
   The justices, by an 8-0 vote, struck down such a California law
as an impermissible infringement of constitutionally protected
freedom of speech.
   The court also struck down as unconstitutional California laws
limiting the term of office for party leaders and dictating the
make-up of state party central committees.
   A federal appeals court had thrown out key California election
laws, and today's decision upheld that ruling.
   ``The challenged California election laws burden the First
Amendment rights (of freedom of speech and freedom of association)
of political parties and their members without serving a compelling
state interest,'' Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote for the court.
   In overturning the ban on primary election endorsements, Marshall
said that attempts to preserve party unity and protect voters from
confusion and undue influence cannot justify such a prohibition.
   He said the state also failed to prove that its regulation of
political parties' leadership structure was necessary to ensure
orderly and fair elections.
   Justice John Paul Stevens did not join Marshall's opinion but, in
a separate concurring opinion, also voted to strike down the
California laws. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist did not
participate in the case for unannounced reasons.
   California revamped its election laws around the turn of the
century to break the grip on political parties by wealthy special
interests, particularly the Southern Pacific Railroad Co.
   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in its ruling last
year, said such laws as the ban on primary election endorsements now
have the effect of undermining the parties' main goals.
   Agreeing with the appeals court today, Marshall said, ``Depriving
a political party to endorse suffocates'' its freedom of speech and
association.
   He added: ``The endorsement ban prevents parties from promoting
candidates at the crucial juncture at which the appeal to common
principles may be translated into concerted action, and hence to
political power in the community.''
   The case is Eu vs. San Francisco County Democratic Central
Committee, 87-1269.

   Strained Egyptian-Israeli relations showed
strong signs of improvement today when the countries agreed on
compensation in a border dispute and Egypt's foreign minister
accepted an invitation to visit Israel.
   The thaw coincided with the approach of the 10th anniversary of
the neighbors' peace treaty, the first and only one between an Arab
nation and the Jewish state.
   Visiting Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens spoke of increased
confidence and said the March 26, 1979 peace treaty ending 30 years
of war between the two nations is ``the foundation stone'' for an
overall Arab-Israeli settlement.
   The agreement, announced Tuesday night by Tourism Minister Fuad
Sultan, removed the major obstacle to Egypt's recovery of the Taba
enclave, awarded by international arbitration in September.
   Under the agreement, Egypt will pay $37 million _ little more
than half the initial claim _ to the Israeli owners of the
Aviya-Sonesta Beach Hotel in Taba.
   If the hotel earns more than $6.3 million a year, the owners will
get that amount up to a ceiling of $3 million a year.
   Sultan said Egypt also will pay $1.15 million for Rafi Nelson
Village, a cafeteria with tourist cabanas on Taba beach.
   The 250-acre enclave overlooks the Red Sea's Gulf of Aqaba at the
southern end of the Egyptian-Israeli frontier.
   President Hosni Mubarak said last month that compensation was the
main impediment to implementing the arbitration ruling.
   Still being discussed are access to Taba for Israelis and
delineation of the frontier from the final border marker to the
beach, a stretch of 150 yards. Egyptian and Israeli officials said
only minor differences remain.
   Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif told reporters that final
agreement is expected by the end of February at a meeting in Taba of
Egyptian, Israeli and U.S. representatives. El-Sherif said Egypt
will take over after Taba on March 15 after Israel withdraws.
   Israel refused to relinquish Taba when it completed its
withdrawal from Egypt's Sinai peninsula in April 1982. Bilateral
talks failed and the dispute was referred to arbitrators in Geneva
in 1986.
   After meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
today, Arens said his Egyptian counterpart, Esmat Abdel-Meguid, had
accepted his invitation to visit Israel at a date to be fixed later.

   Gov. Edward D. DiPrete today urged union
leaders to end a walkout at the state General Hospital, where for a
third day National Guard troops substituted for striking nurses and
attendants.
   The first face-to-face talks between hospital and union officials
began less than five hours before a judge's 3 p.m. back-to-work
order was to take effect. Union leaders did not say whether they
would comply with the order.
   ``I ... believe that the elements for the settlement are right
now there,'' DiPrete told the negotiators. But, he added, ``it's
going to take some work.''
   National Guard troops in combat fatigues took over for the
striking attendants and licensed practical nurses when the walkout
began Sunday night at the 410-patient hospital, which provides
long-term care for the chronically ill. Union leaders have
complained about staffing changes at the facility.
   Nanci Martin, DiPrete's press secretary, said talks between the
union and officials of the state Department of Mental Health,
Retardation and Hospitals would be mediated by DiPrete aide Robert
K. Vincent and state Labor Director Bernard Singleton.
   Today's negotiations followed a private hourlong meeting between
DiPrete and union President Joseph G. Fargnoli on Tuesday night,
Martin said.
   ``The governor is hoping that both sides will discuss this,'' she
said. ``The governor is going to be available.''
   Fargnoli made no commitment that the workers would return to
their jobs, Martin said.
   About 120 guardsmen, including seven with nurses training, worked
at the hospital and the neighboring Institute of Mental Health where
union members also failed to show up for their jobs, said Capt. John
Loughlin, a Guard spokesman.
   ``When you join the Guard you realize there's a possibility
you'll be called out to something you may not be totally familiar
with, or may not be totally thrilled about,'' Loughlin said.
   Sue Carberry, a registered nurse who reported to work, said that
although the combat fatigue-clad guardsmen helped to bathe, feed and
dress patients, ``if they don't have someone to tell them what to do
it's difficult.''
   ``I can change my son's diaper, but it's a little different
changing someone else's,'' said Sgt. Al Topp. ``I couldn't do it if
I worked here full time.''
   DiPrete said during a hospital visit that he was willing to keep
the Guard out ``as long as they need people here.'' He said he was
satisfied with the patient care.
   Martin, the governor's spokeswoman, declined to say if DiPrete
prepared concessions to the union, but said he directed hospital
officials to continue staffing patterns that the state imposed last
week to curb overtime, prompting the walkout.
   About a third of 85 normally scheduled attendants and about half
of the nurses reported for work Tuesday, hospital administrator
James Benedict said.
   Benedict said 22 acute-care patients were at or would be moved to
other area hospitals.
   The hospital's medical director, Dr. Rajnikant Shah, said about
half the patients were in medical danger.
   ``I'll be contacting more facilities than I've contacted already
in hopes of appealing to them to take patients more rapidly for us.
We could begin to empty out entire units, if need be,'' Benedict
said.
   A four-day sickout by union members ended Jan. 31 when DiPrete
called out the Guard and threatened to fire employees who failed to
report for work.
   The members of Local 1350 of the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees claim the state has failed to fill
vacant staff positions at the hospital called for in their contract.
The state, in an effort to cut overtime costs, has refused in many
cases to bring in additional workers to replace employees who call
in sick.

   An inmate used a ``John Dillinger
special'' _ a pistol carved from a bar of soap _ to escape from the
Lake County Jail, where Dillinger himself pulled a real gun to
escape 50 years ago.
   Robert Edward Gregory, 25, a convicted burglar, pulled the fake
pistol on a court bailiff Tuesday, then used it to steal a car,
police said. He later was arrested wihtout incident by police who
spotted the car and returned him to jail. No one was hurt.
   According to legend, Dillinger escaped from the jail in 1934
after brandishing a gun he carved from wood. The legend lives even
though it later was revealed that Dillinger had used a real
.45-caliber automatic.
   Dillinger remained free four months, until he was shot dead in
Chicago in July.
   Gregory's soap gun bought him less than an hour of freedom.
   ``The guy is an artist,'' said Lake County Sheriff Stephen R.
Stiglich. The gun was shaped like an Army .45-caliber pistol and was
blackened with shoe polish or dye, police said.
   Gregory, who served 3{ years of a five-year sentence for
burglary, was arrested in September for public intoxication and
possession of a firearm after taking a potshot with a rifle while
sitting in a car with friends. He had remained in the county jail
since then.
   Just before his escape, Gregory had appeared before Lake County
Judge James A. Krajewski for violating his parole in that incident.

   President Bush is still assessing his options
in the Middle East, and his meetings this week with Arab and Israeli
leaders are unlikely to produce new U.S. initiatives to end the
conflict in the region, analysts say.
   Bush departed today for Japan and the funeral of Emperor
Hirohito. While there, he will meet with King Hussein of Jordan and
Presidents Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Chaim Herzog of Israel, as
well as other world leaders.
   Preparations also are under way to line up visits to the United
States in March and April by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
Hussein and Mubarak, sources said.
   At a news conference Tuesday, Bush told reporters that he would
not be rushed into formulating a policy toward the Middle East
simply because Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze is
engaging in high-profile diplomacy in the region.
   Bush said he wants to take his first Mideast step to be a
``prudent'' one. ``I don't want to be stampeded by the fact that the
Soviet foreign minister takes a trip to the Middle East,'' he said.
   Bush has talked before about pursuing a go-slow policy in the
Middle East.
   ``You crawl before you walk,'' Bush said a week after his
inauguration, when asked whether the time had come for Secretary of
State James A. Baker III to meet with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.
   ``There is no policy,'' said Mideast expert Judith Kipper of the
Brookings Institution, at least in part because key positions still
remain unfilled at the State Department.
   Apart from supporting the Reagan administration's decision to end
a 13-year boycott of direct contacts with Arafat's PLO, Bush has
said little to indicate how _ and whether _ his Mideast policy might
contrast with the shuttle diplomacy pursued without success by the
previous administration.
   In fact, Baker last week told European diplomats he thought that
they, too, should move carefully in the area of Mideast peace
offensives.
   A Baker aide, describing the secretary's response to a survey of
the situation by a European Community team, quoted Baker responding
that ``this is an area that if you don't prepare an initiative in
the right way, if you push too hard on the wrong level and on the
wrong issues, the possibilities that are there might be pre-empted.''
   In small bits and pieces, some general Bush administration
Mideast policy principles have begun to emerge:
   _Vice President Dan Quayle told the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith on Feb. 10 that the United States would not try to
impose a settlement on Israel, which has been stung by the American
opening to the PLO.
   _Bush administration officials believe Israel must show more
flexibility in ending the violence in the occupied territories of
the West Bank and Gaza strip. The State Department criticized Israel
in its recently-released human rights report, saying Shamir's
government had used unnecessary force in quelling Palestinian
violence in the territories.
   _Baker said at his confirmation hearings that he is opposed to an
independent Palestinian state.
   Further complicating the Bush administration's formulation of its
Mideast strategy is a new and more aggressive role by the Soviet
Union.
   Shevardnadze said in Damascus, Syria, last week that the Kremlin
will push for an international peace conference on the Mideast under
the auspices of the United Nations.
   Several Mideast scholars in this country complain that the Reagan
administration gave only lip service to the notion of an
international conference with Soviet participation, and say the U.S.
government did not genuinely support that concept in the last eight
years.
   What remains obscure is whether Bush will follow the Reagan
administration approach of trying to set up Arab-Israeli
negotiations _ and what role the PLO would play in such talks.
   The effort failed despite four trips to the region by former
Secretary of State George P. Shultz, and several separate missions
by former Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy.
   Israel vehemently opposes U.S. dealings with the PLO, and
administration officials say Foreign Minister Moshe Arens will meet
with Baker in the second week of March.
   But Israeli Embassy spokesman Yossi Gal said, ``We expect to be
working very closely with the administration.''
   Several private experts disagreed on whether Bush's cautious
approach was the correct one.
   ``It would be a grave mistake on the part of the administration
to move too fast,'' said Neil Pickett of the Hudson Institute.
   ``I am hoping for a cautious and methodical approach,'' he said,
``but I am very aware of the pressures on him (Bush) not to do
that.''
   Samih Farsoun, an American University professor, said, however,
``there seems to be an international consensus that the U.S. drags
its feet.''
   ``The time for a U.S. peace settlement is now, and the auspices
for it is the United Nations,'' he said. ``I think it is time to
move forward because the PLO has come around.''
   Ms. Kipper, who recently returned from a Mideast tour, said the
administration has shown little enthusiasm for new peace initiatives
because ``they would like to see the Israelis come up with new ideas
in the occupied territories.''
   ``There are very real differences between the United States and
Israel,'' she said. Ms. Kipper said that the opening to the PLO has
transformed ``a dormant policy difference into an active policy
difference.''

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today sidestepped deciding
whether a criminal defendant's right to be tried by his peers is
violated when prosecutors disqualify potential jurors based on their
race.
   By a 7-2 vote, the justices ruled against Frank D. Teague,
sentenced to 30 years in prison for the armed robbery of a Chicago
supermarket and for the attempted murder of police officers shot
after the robbery.
   Four justices _ one vote short of the majority needed to set
binding legal precedent _ said Teague should not be allowed to raise
the representative-jury issue.
   The four, led by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, said federal courts
should not establish new constitutional guidelines when ruling on
so-called habeas corpus appeals by criminal defendants.
   Such appeals attack a defendant's state court conviction or
sentence on grounds that federal constitutional rights were
violated. The appeals always follow unsuccessful state court appeals
by the defendants.
   The justices in 1986 ruled that prosecutors never may disqualify
potential jurors based on their race. The court said such tactics
violate equal-protection rights.
   But a subsequent decision strictly limited the retroactive effect
of the 1986 ruling. The court said previously that the 1986 ruling
does not apply to convicted criminals who, like Teague, had
exhausted direct appeals in state courts prior to when the 1986
ruling was announced.
   Teague's habeas corpus appeal did not raise the equal-protection
issue, but instead attacked a prosecutor's exclusion of 10 potential
black jurors on grounds that it violated Teague's right to a jury
selected from a cross-section of the community.
   Teague, who is black, was convicted in 1978 by an all-white jury.
   If Teague were to win on the fair cross-section challenge, he
would be entitled to a new trial even though the high court's 1986
ruling came too late to help him.
   Past Supreme Court rulings have applied the Sixth Amendment's
fair cross-section requirement to pools of potential jurors but not
to juries actually selected.
   O'Connor said the court should not decide whether the fair
cross-section requirement applies to selected juries as well because
that ruling could not apply to Teague.
   Her opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens
also voted to uphold Teague's conviction but for differing reasons.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall dissented.
   The case is Teague vs. Lane, 87-5259.

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top PLO official said today his organization
supports a Palestinian state alongside Israel and said the
Palestinian National Charter calling for destruction of the Jewish
state is open to discussion.
   Salah Khalaf, Yasser Arafat's No. 2 man, spoke on a videotape
smuggled into Israel from Tunis, Tunisia. The tape was shown at a
Middle East peace symposium in Jerusalem.
   In an unusual direct appeal to Israel, Khalaf, known by his nom
de guerre Abu Iyad, assured his audience the PLO recognizes the
Jewish state and deplores violence.
   ``We have arrived at a truth that we hope the Israeli leaders
will arrive at before it is too late. This is the truth which says
that two peoples and two states must coexist in this land,'' Khalaf
said.
   ``All other matters are open to discussion, our covenant and
yours can be discussed,'' Khalaf said.
   The ``convenant'' refers to the Palestinian National Charter.
   Khalaf called for direct PLO-Israeli talks before an
international Middle East peace conference proposed most recently by
the Soviet Union.
   Israel considers the PLO a terrorist organization and refuses to
hold direct negotiations with it.
   The 15-minute videotape was screened at a symposium on the
Arab-Israeli conflict organized by the International Center for
Peace in the Middle East, a private Tel Aviv think tank headed by
former Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban of the Labor Party.
   The appeal followed demands by liberal Israelis that the PLO deal
directly with Israel instead of seeking Western support for its
positions. The United States opened a dialogue with the PLO in
December after Arafat recognized Israel and renounced terrorism.
   ``The people of Israel have a fear that Arafat is addressing
Europe and the U.S. State Department, and not the real or imaginary
fears of the Israeli people,'' Shlomo Avineri, an Israeli political
scientist, told the symposium earlier. ``I hope he (Arafat) will one
day talk to our people.''
   But Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir reiterated his refusal to
negotiate with the PLO. ``I see it (the PLO) as a stumbling block on
the road to peace, a very serious obstacle,'' he said on Israel Army
radio in a telephone interview from Paris.
   Khalaf, who spoke in Arabic, said the PLO supported a Palestinian
state alongside Israel.
   ``The real issue is not negotiations in which Israel seeks this
piece of land and we seek that piece of land. This is a small
geographic area without much elbow room. We do not seek to have a
Berlin Wall or any other wall separating us,'' Khalaf said.
   Addressing himself to ``every child in Israel, to every woman and
every man,'' he said the PLO was ``genuine in our desire for a
strategic peace, a peace in which we shall bring security and
stability to this region.''

   Hundreds of authors marched outside the Iranian Mission to the
United Nations today as outraged writers stepped up their protests
over the reaction to Salman Rushdie's novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   ``I write controversial books. What publisher is now going to
take chances with a controversial book?'' asked activist Abbie
Hoffman, one of about 300 writers marching in a driving rainstorm
outside the mission in New York City.
   The members of the National Writers Union, on the sidewalk across
from the mission, carried signs which said ``Free Speech Is
Fundamental'' and ``Hands Off Our Constitution.''
   Union president Alec Dubro was rebuffed by building security at
the mission when he attempted to deliver a letter there expressing
outrage at the death threats toward Rushdie.
   The writers then marched on two Fifth Avenue book stores _ B.
Dalton's and Barnes &amp; Noble. Both stores are owned by B. Dalton, one
of the chains that has pulled the book from its shelves in several
cities.
   ``To see book stores caving in like that to demagoguery is
horrifying. These are the largest book-sellers in the country,''
said author Laura Shapiro. ``They exist in honor of freedom of the
press. For them to be so cowardly is despicable.''
   Writers' union locals also planned rallies today in Boston,
Washington, Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco.
   A group of prominent authors, including Norman Mailer, Susan
Sontag, Joan Didion, E.L. Doctorow, Robert Caro and Gay Talese,
scheduled a public reading of the book in Manhattan today.
   In Dover, Del. a high school English teacher says she has
encouraged her students to spend part of today protesting outside a
Waldenbooks store. That chain, the nation's largest, has also
withdrawn of the book ``Satanic Verses'' from display on its shelves.
   ``It's not against Waldenbooks, but the position of leadership
the U.S. has failed to take making it necessary for them to drop the
promotion of sales of the book,'' said Dover High School teacher
Phyllis Levitt.
   Iran's religious leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, has placed a bounty
on Rushdie's head, saying ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam.
Khomeini also threatened anyone involved in the book's publication.
   ``We've never seen writers as deeply outraged as they've been
over this issue,'' said Alec Dubro, president of the National
Writers Union. He blamed the ``craven response'' of the chains as
well as the threats themselves.
   The chains cited their employees' safety as the reason for
removing the book. The threats also prompted Rushdie to cancel a
U.S. promotional tour and go into hiding with his wife,
American-born novelist Marianne Wiggins.
   Ms. Wiggins was reported today to have canceled a similar
seven-city U.S. tour to promote her new novel, ``John Dollar.''
   Because so many bookstores have stopped selling ``Satanic
Verses'' out of fear of violence, a trio of Yale University
graduates has set up a toll-free number, 1-800-544-7475, through
which anyone may order the book.
   ``We were discussing this and decided it's kind of scary that the
book is relatively unavailable to the American public,'' said one of
the men, Kevin Kiernan of New York. ``A lot of people just don't
know what is in the book and people want to see what is in the
book.''
   Kiernan said they'll sell the book for the retail price, $19.95.
He said they have made arrangements with the book's publisher,
Viking Penguin, but he did not yet know how long it would take to
fill an order.
   In a telegram, the eastern branch of the Writers Guild of America
told Len Riggio, chairman of B. Dalton and Barnes &amp; Noble, that the
group ``strongly protests your removal of the Salman Rushdie book
from the shelves of your stores.''
   ``Intimidation and fear generated by those who do not believe in
our system of free speech cannot justify your company imposing a new
form of censorship,'' it said.
   ``We believe your action sets a dangerous precedent under which
any type of literary material could be forced out of circulation if
threats are made against the distributors, broadcasters or
exhibitors of that material,'' the telegram said.

the nation.

   The Arizona Republic, Phoenix, Ariz., on drug tests:
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is headed in the right
direction with its move toward a rule requiring random drug and
alcohol testing of employees at all U.S. nuclear power plants.
   Given the risks and the magnitude of mishaps, it is frightening
to think that workers at such critical jobs would not be closely
monitored, and certainly the monitoring should include regular
checks for evidence of substance abuse.
   Implementation of the proposed regulation, which would apply to
all utilities operating or building atomic power stations, hinges on
final approval by the NRC, which is expected to rule in about a
month, and official publication of the rule, which could take an
additional month.
   The possibility _ more likely a probability _ also exists of a
time-consuming legal challenge. ...
   The mere thought of an alcohol-impaired or a drug-high technician
loose in the operational section of a nuclear power plant is
chilling. Let the testing begin.

   The Daily Oklahoman, Oklahoma City, on the costs of Congress:
   Taxpayers are supporting a congressional bureaucracy in
Washington that will cost more than $2.2 billion this year.
   Where does all this money go? Much of it supports a bureaucracy
that has grown to 37,500 workers, including staff of individual
members' offices and committees.
   As if this year's budget wasn't big enough, the lawmakers want
even more for fiscal 1990. Congress has proposed an extra $53
million for postal expenses, to cover heavy election-year
``official'' mailings.
   The budget also includes hefty increases for House and Senate
employee salaries and office expenses.
   How many taxpayers believe they're getting their money's worth? A
recent poll gave Congress a favorable rating of only 53 percent.

   The Greenwood (Miss.) Commonwealth on President Bush and the
budget:
   For all of George Bush's conciliatory talk to Congress about the
budget, the problem is still there: We're spending far too much
money, or we're taxing too little.
   Instead of this ``no new taxes, read my lips'' approach, we would
prefer for the president to talk straight to the American people,
call for sacrifice if that's what's necessary _ more taxes and less
spending to get the red ink under control.
   We've had eight years of Ronald Reagan's wishful thinking and
Congress' irresponsibility which has gotten the nation into bad
financial trouble.
   We hope Bush will be different.

   Walla Walla (Wash.) Union-Bulletin on gun lobbyists:
   The National Rifle Association had Sen. Howard Metzenbaum in its
crosshairs, and missed. Politicians around the country should take
notice.
   The NRA, considered by many to wield the power of an 800-pound
gorilla, may be nothing more than a monkey on the back of
politicians.
   The NRA and other gun lobbyists base their political clout on the
support from millions of hunters and other gun owners across the
nation who fear they will lose their weapons.
   Thankfully, the American people would not stand for politicians
taking away hunters' guns or restricting their use.
   However, the truth is most Americans, whether gun owners or not,
do not object to an appropriate and reasonable form of gun control,
specifically legislation aimed at banning semiautomatic assault
weapons. ...
   Metzenbaum, now pushing legislation to halt sales of AK47s,
Israeli-made Uzis and a host of other military-style weapons, has
challenged the NRA and not been hurt. Despite being an NRA target in
last fall's election, Metzenbaum easily won re-election to his
Senate seat from Ohio.
   It's time for other lawmakers to follow Metzenbaum's lead and
toss the NRA monkey off their backs.

   Arkansas Democrat, Little Rock, Ark., on Winnie Mandela:
   Sometimes, it takes an event of incomprehensible horror to shake
people to their senses.
   By now, most everyone knows that Winnie Mandela _ the prominent
South African anti-apartheid activist and wife of jailed African
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela _ has been disowned by her
country's civil rights leaders for her complicity in the murder of a
child, 14-year-old James ``Stompie'' Seipei.
   The United Democratic Front, South Africa's largest
anti-apartheid organization, issued a statement saying its
membership is ``outraged by her obvious complicity'' in the
abduction and slaying of the boy, who was involved in black activist
causes. The child was allegely abducted by members of the Mandela
United Football Club, the gang of rogues and thugs who act as
``bodyguards'' for Mrs. Mandela.
   In all, three young activists were allegedly killed by these
outlaws, and two more have disappeared and may be dead.
   While we abhor the horrors of apartheid _ the bulldozing of black
townships, the racist oppression, and the murders of men like Steven
Biko, who was much more moderate than Mandela _ we also abhor the
type of Marxist dictatorship the Mandelas seek to replace with it.
   The Winnie Mandelas of South Africa cannot be allowed to prevail.
The people of her country, black and white, deserve better.

   Philadelphia Daily News on gun control:
   President Bush is ``absolutely not'' backing a federal ban on
sales of semi-automatic weapons.
   Bush supports the tortured logic of the National Rifle
Association that assault rifles, like the AK47 used in the recent
killings of five schoolchildren in Stockton, Calif., can be used for
hunting or target practice.
   That could probably also be said about flame throwers and grenade
launchers, but that's no reason to make those ... things readily
available to any nut who can afford the price.
   Bush ... wants the states to punish criminals more severely.
   Presidential leadership is needed to make it harder to buy guns
that are used primarily to shoot people and to better screen those
who buy these guns.
   There's no way to get to a kinder, gentler nation with an AK47 on
the shoulder of every homicidal maniac in creation.
   The president must realize that, and it's time he said it.

   Forum, Fargo, N.D., on a new tax on gasoline:
   The drive to reduce the nation's staggering budget deficit has
some members of Congress and the Bush administration seriously
considering imposition of a 50-cent-per-gallon excise tax on
gasoline.
   That's the wrong approach for at least three reasons.
   First, such a tax would unfairly place a larger part of the
burden of deficit reduction on rural states. While drivers in the
wide-open West pile up more miles on the road than do travelers in
urban states where mass transit is available, the additional revenue
from the gasoline tax would go for deficit reduction rather than
highway and bridge maintenance. ...
   Second, there is convincing evidence additional motor fuels taxes
inhibit economic growth. The Department of Energy estimated in 1987
that a 25-cent-per-gallon tax would cut the gross national product
about .5 percent.
   And finally, higher gasoline taxes would be regressive _
especially unfair to lower income people who spend a larger fraction
of their incomes on motor fuels than do more affluent drivers.

   Hobbs (N.M.) Daily News-Sun on parental choice and public schools:
   Already, 13 states give parents the option of selecting superior
schools where their children can receive a good education. President
Bush, moreover, endorses this free-market strategy of getting the
most from U.S. public schools.
   The biggest obstacle to this reform is the 1.7-million member
National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers' union.
   NEA lobbyists contend that open enrollment would further divide
students along economic lines, thereby consigning low income
children to educational ghettos.
   Such an argument is nonsense, as free choice would liberate
disadvantaged youngsters from inferior ghetto schools.
   What the NEA really fears is that its members would have to be
more accountable to the public.
   Parental choice may not be a cure-all for the malady afflicting
many of the nation's public schools. But it is the most effective
means of motivating those schools to offer much more to their
students.

   The Huntsville (Ala.) Times on ``The Satanic Verses'':
   Iran's extreme reaction to the (Salman) Rushdie novel (``The
Satanic Verses'') should not surprise anyone.
   The Islamic fundamentalists who have ruled the country for a
decade have imposed the same intolerance at home, killing, torturing
and imprisoning even the mildest of dissenters.
   Remember, it was Iran's stated intent to export the Islamic
revolution that directly led to the long, bitter war with Iraq. Iran
couldn't defeat Iraq, so now it looks elsewhere.
   It seems so basic, but it bears repeating: Iran cannot dictate to
the world what books it may read or what ideas it may discuss. Every
culture would like to see all of humanity molded in its likeness,
but freedom of expression must remain a common bond in the
brotherhood of man.
   Perhaps Iran will someday return to its senses.

   St. Louis Post-Dispatch on a U.S.-Japan fighter plane:
   Last fall, the U.S.-Japan fighter plane deal appeared set. But
the Bush administration has delayed a final decision for a month,
with different departments arguing whether the plan should go ahead
at all.
   These second thoughts are warranted. ...
   The latest deal involves General Dynamics and Mitsubishi in the
FSX ground attack fighter based on the F-16. The Pentagon and the
State Department, more interested in short-term political goals,
gave the Japanese very liberal terms _ too liberal argue the critics.
   Of the $1.2 billion in development costs, the United States will
get only 35 to 40 percent of the subcontracts, while Japan will get
the rest as well as all production.
   But what is even more troubling is that Tokyo will also get
access to composite material and building technology that could
allow it to expand its aviation industry, allowing it to compete
with the U.S.
   The critics are right; the deal should be renegotiated. The
present arrangement harms American interests both in the short and
the long term.

   The Evening Sun, Baltimore, on refugees:
   The problem of refugees is as old as the problem of human
conflict. Currently, more than 13 million people around the world
need protection and assistance after fleeing their homes because of
wars and insurrections, political oppression or economic hardship.
   Yet, according to a study from the Worldwatch Institute in
Washington D.C., that sobering figure will soon be exceeded by a
less traditional category of refugees _ people displaced from their
homes because of environmental disasters.
   Those disasters may be sudden, like the 1986 nuclear accident at
Chernobyl. ... Other disasters are more gradual, such as the
impoverishment of productive farmland in sub-Saharan Africa. ...
   In many parts of Africa and Asia, land that is still usable has
been strained to the point that it can no longer yield enough to
guarantee a suitable diet.
   The result is malnutrition, a warning sign that migration _ the
most drastic response to environmental degradation _ is likely to be
the inhabitants' next response.

   Los Angeles Times on South African racism and poverty in South
Africa:
   An extraordinary eight-year study ... has detailed more
thoroughly than ever before the appalling depths of South Africa's
poverty, the pervasive suffering of its black majority and the
inexorable change taking place that may _ or may not _ lead to
democracy and liberation from racism. ...
   The report, co-authored by South Africans Francis Wilson and
Mamphela Ramphele, rejects the present-day strategy of their
government to eliminate piecemeal some of the elements of apartheid.
...
   ``The agony of South Africa is due primarily to the fact that
those with political power have left no room for those who would
change the society to use legitimate democratic channels to do so,''
Wilson and Ramphele write. ...
   Wilson is a professor of economics at the University of Cape
Town. Ramphele is also on the faculty there and is a celebrated
figure in efforts to end apartheid.
   They share the credit with 450 others _ scholars, researchers,
experts in special fields _ who generated about 300 separate study
papers that were the basis for the final report. ...
   It is already on sale in South Africa and will be available soon
in American bookstores. It is required reading for anyone who would
seek to understand South Africa and try to facilitate the cause of
justice there.

   The Journal, Providence, R.I., on Winnie Mandela:
   Among South Africa's repressed black majority, Winnie Mandela has
stood for years as a proud symbol of the fight against the country's
hated system of apartheid.
   Last week, however, her prestige was shattered when fellow
apartheid foes denounced her, saying her increasingly erratic
behavior was injuring their cause. ...
   Mrs. Mandela, who in 1986 had endorsed the practice of murdering
black informers and government collaborators, had become too
militant for many other black leaders.
   She became a publicity hound, built an enormous mansion in Soweto
and organized tough bodyguards into a so-called ``soccer club.''
Hers became a cult of personal power run amok. ...
   While it may have pained black South Africans to spurn a woman
they had once admired, they correctly saw that their cause was too
precious to risk for anyone's personal ambition.
   Perhaps from a distorted sense of loyalty to her jailed husband
and his quiet crusade, Winnie Mandela overreached herself.

   Post-Bulletin, Rochester, Minn., on the Soviet withdrawal from
Afghanistan:
   Like the U.S. departure from Vietnam, the exodus of Soviet forces
from Afghanistan will not bring peace to that devastated land.
   In fact, the Soviet army's departure is only the prelude for what
may be even more savage fighting between the government and
guerrilla forces.
   The parallels with Vietnam are remarkable. Soviet soldiers
returning home have reported that the public is indifferent and does
not appreciate their service. ...
   The United States went to Vietnam to stop the spread of
communism, but left with the entire country under Communist
domination. The Soviets went to Afghanistan to support a Communist
puppet regime, but left that regime to its fate at the hands of a
large and confident guerrilla force.
   The lesson of the past two decades is one that has been learned
before: Wars often are fought for the wrong reason and create
disasters greater than the ones they were designed to prevent.
   The Soviets have left Afghanistan. The disaster they leave behind
will be a cruel burden for the people of Afghanistan and for those
who support them for decades to come.

   Just two days after sleet and snow blanketed North Carolina,
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms swept through the state, killing
one person, injuring more than a dozen and teaching 227
schoolchildren the value of being prepared.
   Meanwhile, floodwaters receded in Kentucky and Tennessee, where
something new began falling from the sky: snow.
   Flurries began swirling around Nashville early today as
temperatures dropped into the 20s throughout Tennessee, bringing a
reprieve from the heavy rains that have plagued the region for more
than a week. Most of Kentucky also got light snowfall overnight.
   A clash between warm and cold air was blamed for the severe
weather Tuesday in North Carolina, where a construction worker died
in the collapse of a house he was building near Lillington, about 25
miles south of Raleigh. Four people were injured in that incident.
   The National Weather Service said there were apparently some
tornadoes in the state, but could not confirm individual accounts of
twisters.
   In Anson County, just north of the South Carolina border, the
storm destroyed a cable television business, sent a tree crashing
through the roof of a house, blew over two airplanes at an airport,
ripped the tin roof off a service station and tore part of the roof
off the Morven Elementary School _ where pupils went through a storm
drill last week.
   ``We had just had our tornado drill last week so that children
knew exactly what to do,'' said Gloria Truman, the school secretary.
``They were out of the classroom and in the hallway in about 15
seconds. They were perfect. You could not ask for them to be any
better.''
   One of the 227 children, fourth-grader Shannon Short, 9, recalled
the storm in vivid detail.
   ``It was thundering and the glass was bumping and then the top of
the ceiling started shaking. That's when it started,'' she said.
``The rain was splashing on the windows. It sounded like rocks. We
had to get out because the rain was falling in on our classroom.''
   About 30 miles north in Moore County, several trailers
overturned, injuring four people, while to the east in Richmond
County, wind tore half the roof off a motel in Rockingham.
   In Kentucky, crews doubled their efforts to pump flood water from
Lebanon Junction, a town south of Louisville that has been inundated
by the recent floods. National Guard Sgt. Ian Lamb said a second
heavy-duty water pump was flown in by helicopter and lowered onto a
rain-soaked levee that was too soft to support a truck.
   About 150 families left their homes in Calhoun, Livermore and
Rumsey in McLean County in western Kentucky because of flooding from
the Green River, said Don Armstrong, a spokesman for the state
Division of Disaster and Emergency Services. The river was expected
to crest at 10 feet above flood level by Friday.
   Authorities said flooding may have been to blame for the death of
a woman whose body was found Tuesday night in 18 inches of water in
her basement in LaRue County.
   In western Tennessee, about a dozen people were expected to begin
cleaning up today in the town of Obion, where nearly 400 people were
evacuated after a levee on the Obion River burst.
   Schools were closed Tuesday in four Tennessee counties where
roads were under water, but reopened today when they cleared.
   However, authorities said they were confident that the flooding
threat was passing with the end of the rains. Virtually all of
Tennessee's swollen rivers had either passed flood stage or were
expected to by Friday, forecasters said.

   A cargo ship carrying 17 people sank in the
Atlantic Ocean early today, and rescuers battling 90 mph winds and
rough seas recovered four bodies and searched for the 13 other crew
members, the coast guard said.
   U.S. long-range helicopters, British planes and ships, and a
Danish fishing vessel joined the search for survivors from the
Panamanian-registered Secil Angola, which sank 350 miles west of
Scotland.
   At midday, a Royal Air Force plane returning to Britain spotted
nine life jackets in the water, and Flight Lt. Jim McLeod said
survivors were ``possible.''
   The Danish vessel, the Hordagutt, recovered the bodies, the coast
guard said. Officials said the search was contining.
   McLeod said winds up to 90 mph, combined with snow flurries and
40-foot waves, made it difficult to see anything on the water.
   The Secil Angola, carrying salt from Spain to Iceland, sank at
7:30 a.m. after losing its forward hatch covering and taking on
water, the coast guard said.
   The first distress call came at about midnight, said coast guard
spokesman John Griffiths in Clyde, Scotland.
   At 6 a.m., the ship's captain sent a last desperate message:
``There is great danger. Helicopters please hurry.''
   An RAF Nimrod maritime reconaissance aircraft, the first on the
scene, reported the stricken vessel was awash _ just above the
surface of the water _ at 7:20 a.m., said Griffiths.
   Minutes later the pilot reported radio contact has been lost, the
ship had turned on its side and sank.
   Griffiths said the Nimrod dropped three life rafts and other
rescue equipment onto the water.
   When helicopters reached the area, one crewman was lowered by
cable to search each dinghy and life raft for survivors, said a
spokesman at the rescue coordination center at Pitreavie, Scotland.
   ``On these dinghies the canopies inflate automatically,'' he
said, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   ``If you are inside, in these kind of conditions ... you don't
poke your head out of the slot,'' he said. ``They would not hear the
aircraft, so the winchman has to go down to look at each one
individually.''
   The crewman had only one hour to complete his search before the
helicopter, operating at maximum range, was forced to return to
Britain to refuel, he said.
   The rescue center requested help from the U.S. Air Force, which
sent two long-range helicopters with midair refueling capabilities
from Keflavik, Iceland, 550 miles away.
   ``Our helicopters had to refuel in air twice,'' said Lt. Matthew
Hamilton. ``They encountered some really bad weather about 7:30, had
to fly around it, which added about 100 miles to their trip.''
   When British officials initially indicated they thought there
were no survivors, the American aircraft returned to base, he said.
   ``Based on the water temperature and the sea state and the
weather, we decided that it was best that we turn around and come
back,'' he said.

Interest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a victory for the federal
government, today made it easier for some creditors to collect more
money from those who declare bankruptcy.
   The court, by a 5-4 ruling in a case from Detroit, said the
government is entitled to certain interest payments on taxes owed by
a bankrupt company.
   The case stems from a petition filed by Ron Pair Enterprises
before a bankruptcy judge in Detroit in 1984.
   The government said the company owed it $53,278 in taxes,
penalties and interest accrued prior to the filing of the bankruptcy
petition.
   The company agreed to pay the amount, but refused to pay
additional interest accrued after the filing of the petition.
   The government said the company should pay the post-filing
interest because the collateral, tax liens on company property, that
secure the debt owed the government exceed the amount of the
original debt.
   The Supreme Court today agreed, and overturned a ruling by the
6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals against the government.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, in his opinion for the court, said the
bankruptcy code, which was revised by Congress in 1978, permit
post-filing interest payments in such cases.
   The Internal Revenue Service has filed secured claims in
bankruptcy proceeding totaling more than $730 million from 1982
through 1986, including $186 million in 1986 alone. Federal
officials said state and local governments and private creditors
also have millions of dollars at stake.
   Joining Blackmun were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
Dissenting were Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, William J. Brennan,
Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens.
   The case is U.S. vs. Ron Pair, 87-1043.

   The Supreme Court ruled today that public
officials may not be sued when their alleged gross negligence
permits a child to be abused by a parent.
   By a 6-3 vote, the justices said a state does not have a
constitutional duty to protect people, including abused children,
who are not in the state's custody.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said,
``As a general matter...we conclude that a state's failure to
protect an individual against private violence simply does not
constitute a violation of the (Constitution's) due process clause.''
   In other matters taken up today:
   _ The court ruled that states may not prohibit political party
leaders from endorsing primary election candidates. The justices, by
an 8-0 vote, struck down a California law as an impermissible
infringement of constitutionally protected freedom of speech. The
court also struck down as unconstitutional California laws limiting
the term of office for party leaders and dictating the make-up of
state party central committees.
   _ The justices sidestepped deciding whether a criminal
defendant's right to be tried by his peers is violated when
prosecutors disqualify potential jurors based on their race. By a
7-2 vote, the justices ruled against Frank D. Teague, sentenced to
30 years in prison for the armed robbery of a Chicago supermarket
and for the attempted murder of police officers shot after the
robbery. Four justices _ one vote short of the majority needed to
set binding legal precedent _ said Teague should not be allowed to
raise the representative-jury issue.
   _ The court, in a victory for the federal government, made it
easier for some creditors to collect more money from those who
declare bankruptcy. The court, by a 5-4 ruling in a case from
Detroit, said the government is entitled to certain interest
payments on taxes owed by a bankrupt company.
   In the child-abuse case, the court rejected an appeal on behalf
of a Wisconsin boy, Joshua DeShaney, who since age 4 has been
seriously and permanently brain damaged from beatings by his father.
   In an unusual emotional dissent, Justice Harry A. Blackmun
exclaimed, ``Poor Joshua! It is a sad commentary upon American life
and constitutional principles...that this child, Joshua DeShaney,
now is assigned to live out the remainder of his life profoundly
retarded'' and without an opportunity to sue the state.
   Social workers were accused of violating Joshua's constitutional
rights by failing to come to his rescue after they had repeated
evidence he was being beaten.
   But Rehnquist said the state's awareness of the boy's plight does
not mean it has a duty to protect him.
   Only ``when the state takes a person into its custody and holds
him there against his will'' does the Constitution require officials
to take responsibility for the individual's safety and well-being,
Rehnquist said.
   ``While the state may have been aware of the dangers that Joshua
faced in the free world, it played no part in their creation nor did
it do anything to render him any more vulnerable to them,'' he said.
   Nor does the fact that the boy was once in the state's custody
change the situation, the chief justice added. ``The state does not
become the permanent guarantor of an individual's safety by having
once offered him shelter,'' he said.
   Joining Rehnquist were Justices Byron R. White, John Paul
Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall joined Blackmun in
dissent.
   A suit in Joshua's behalf was filed against the Winnebago County,
Wis., Department of Social Services and two of its employees.
   The boy first came to the attention of the welfare agency when he
was brought to a hospital in 1983 with cuts and bruises.
   The girlfriend of Joshua's father said the boy was injured in an
attack by another child.
   Officials suspected he was being abused by adults and a social
worker, Ann Kenmeter, was assigned to the case.
   Joshua was returned to the custody of his father, Randy DeShaney,
with a recommendation that DeShaney's girlfriend move out of the
house because DeShaney had hinted she might be abusing the boy.
   DeShaney's former wife and Joshua's mother, Melody DeShaney, was
living in Cheyenne, Wyo., where the couple had been divorced.
   A month after the first hospital visit, Joshua again was treated
for suspicious injuries.
   Ms. Kenmeter visited the DeShaney home on several occasions and
noticed bumps on Johsua's head. The boy also was treated again at a
hospital for various bruises and injuries. Also, DeShaney's
girlfriend still was living at the home.
   Ms. Kenmeter visited the DeShaney home on March 7, 1984, and was
told that several days earlier Joshua had fainted in the bathroom
for no apparent reason. But according to court records, the social
worker did not ask to see the boy.
   The following day Joshua was treated at a hospital for head
injuries that destroyed half his brain, leaving him profoundly
retarded and institutionalized for the rest of his life.
   The boy's father was convicted of child abuse and sentenced to
two to four years in prison.
   The county social services department and its employees were sued
by Joshua's mother on grounds the boy was deprived of liberty
without due process.
   Today's Supreme Court ruling upheld a federal appeals court
decision that threw out the suit.
   The case is DeShaney vs. Winnebago County, 87-154.

   Congressional Democrats resumed their criticism
of President Bush's $1.16 trillion budget today, accusing the
administration of sidestepping needed decisions on savings.
   Richard G. Darman, the administration's budget director, defended
the fiscal 1990 blueprint before the House Budget Committee today,
but the panel's chairman, Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said Bush's
call for deficit savings over a wide range of programs _ without
specifying where spending would be cut _ was inadequate.
   ``These are important to the country and to the American
people,'' Panetta said of the domestic programs that could face
spending reductions. ``The public is entitled to know where the
president stands on these crucial programs.''
   Republicans on the budget committee defended the proposal.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, the panel's ranking Republican,
said he believed Bush had presented ``a pretty complete budget
picture within 19 days of the inauguration.''
   Darman told the Senate budget panel on Tuesday that the best way
for Bush and the Democratic-controlled Congress to work out a budget
was by negotiating.
   ``We must come to an executive-legislative agreement,'' Darman
told the senators. ``To that end, as a matter of practical reality,
we must negotiate.''
   But Darman ran into a torrent of criticism over the budget that
Bush presented to Congress on Feb. 9.
   Much of it focused on what is becoming known as the budget's
``black box'' _ a collection of more than 1,000 programs, mostly in
domestic areas, that the president wants to hold to the same $136
billion spending total in effect for this year.
   The proposal would save $10 billion to $11 billion from budget
growth that would occur otherwise, but Democrats say Bush's budget
leaves Congress with the painful job of selecting programs to cut.
   ``Where are the cuts going to come from?'' asked panel chairman
Jim Sasser, D-Tenn. ``We don't know. The Bush administration has yet
to tell us.''
   Darman, for the first time, indicated that the administration
considered the ``black box'' approach to be among the items that
could be negotiated.
   ``That's one option,'' he said of the grouping of programs.
``Another option is one that says if you've got ideas for priorities
that need to be funded, we'd like to see those.''
   Lawmakers also repeated charges that the assumptions Bush used
about the economy's expected performance were so optimistic that
they would unrealistically diminish the amount of savings needed to
satisfy the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law. That legislation
requires a deficit of no greater than $100 billion next year, or
automatic spending cuts are triggered.
   Sen. J. Bennett Johnson, D-La., said that since there are no
elections this year, and thus no immediate pressures on legislators
seeking re-election, ``We ought to do some serious budgeteering.''
He said that many lawmakers, however, ``are not willing to engage in
a charade.''
   Republicans jumped to Darman's support, including Sen. Pete V.
Domenici, R-N.M., the senior Republican on the committee, who said
he disagreed with the Democrats on the need for fine detail.
   ``I don't think we have to know the details but rather an overall
view,'' he said.
   And Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., said past budgets proposed by
President Reagan were usually pronounced dead on arrival.
   ``Yours is still quivering so I guess you're ahead,'' he told
Darman.
   Administration and congressional officials have held several
meetings already to discuss Bush's budget, and more will be held,
Sasser told reporters after Tuesday's hearing.
   In the most recent session Tuesday morning at the White House,
Bush, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, House Speaker
Jim Wright, D-Texas, and others spent most of their time talking
about the budget process rather than specific program or spendng
decisions, participants said.

   Israeli troops shot and wounded seven
Palestinians today, an Arab reporter said, and underground leaders
of the uprising called for a ``day of confrontations'' to mark the
anniversary of a radical PLO faction.
   A top PLO official said today the organization supports
establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, and he said
the Palestinian charter calling for destruction of the Jewish state
is open to discussion.
   The army sealed the Gaza Strip house of a man suspected of
hurling concrete blocks from his roof at troops, an army official
said. Troops also sealed rooms in three other Gaza Strip homes.
   In the West Bank village of Beit Amin, residents discovered in a
well the body of a man accused of cooperating with Israeli
authorities. Muhammad Abed Suleiman, 25, disappeared two months ago
and residents believe he was killed by fellow Palestinians. An army
official said he was investigating the report.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has said more than 60 suspected
collaborators have been killed by fellow Palestinians since the
December 1987 start of the uprising. In all, 384 Palestinians and 16
Israelis have died in the revolt against Israel's occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   A leaflet distributed by the underground Unified National
Leadership of the Uprising called for a ``day of confrontations''
with troops today to mark the 1969 founding of the Marxist
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical
Palestine Liberation Organization faction led by Nayef Hawatmeh.
   Israel radio reported troops were put on alert.
   Four people wounded in today's protests were hurt in a clash that
occurred when soldiers raided West Bank villages north of Jerusalem
and rounded up dozens of suspects, an Arab reporter said. Hospital
officials confirmed the reports of wounded, and said the youngest
shot was a 13-year-old boy.
   Three other Palestinians were shot and wounded when troops fired
on students hurling rocks at them in Gaza's Jebaliya and Shati
refugee camps, an Arab reporter said.
   An army spokesman said he was checking the reports.
   He said troops sealed three rooms in three homes in Gaza's
Abassan village. They belong to Palestinians accused of setting fire
to a municipal council building to protest a visit by military
personnel, he said.
   Two of the homes only had two rooms, meaning half the house was
blocked off. A family of five lived in one, and an eight-member
family lived in the other.
   During a peace symposium in Jerusalem, a videotape was shown of
Salah Khalaf, Yasser Arafat's No. 2 man.
   Khalaf, known by his nom de guerre Abu Iyad, assured his audience
the PLO recognizes Israel and deplores violence and said: ``We have
arrived at a truth that we hope the Israeli leaders will arrive at
before it is too late. This is the truth which says that two peoples
and two states must coexist in this land,'' Khalaf said in the
address.
   ``All other matters are open to discussion, our covenant and
yours can be discussed,'' Khalaf said.
   The convenant refers to the Palestinian National Charter.

   A man threw a firebomb at the dormitory of London's
main mosque today, causing minor damage but no injuries, a mosque
spokesman said.
   The assailant was caught by police patrolling nearby, said the
spokesman, who requested anonymity.
   Scotland Yard refused to comment on a report in the Evening
Standard that detectives were investigating links with a possible
anti-Moslem backlash following Iran's execution order against
British author Salman Rushdie for his book ``The Satanic Verses,''
which many Moslems consider offensive.
   Police said a 33-year-old man would appear before a magistrate
today charged with arson. They gave no further details.
   The spokesman said a gasoline-filled bottle hit the wall beside a
bedroom window of the dormitory building, part of the mosque complex
in Regent's Park in central London. The bomb scorched the wall but
did no other damage.

<TEXT>
   More than 6,000 municipal workers Wednesday
began a weeklong strike that will halt garbage collection and leave
parks without attendants.
   ``If you don't find a solution ... Greece will stink!'' went the
cry from more than 5,000 demonstrators outside the Interior Ministry.
   The strike began with a march to press demands for a collective
wage agreement and salary increases.
   Dimitris Mihalopoulos, president of the union of municipal
workers, said they were striking because the socialist government
reneged on a promise to settle the dispute.
   ``We are the people who, rain or snow, from daylight to midnight,
clean the cities ... It's not fair that more than 6,000 of us should
not have a collective wage agreement,'' Mihalopoulos said.
   The strike also includes city clerks, record-keepers and road
workers.
   Mihalopoulos said the workers' average monthly salary of about
$400 ``was not enough to support a family.''
   A similar strike last year resulted in piles of uncollected
garbage rotting on streets. Radio stations asked residents to keep
their garbage at home during the strike.

   The federal budget, reflecting a
continuing favorable economic climate, showed a surplus in 1988 for
the third straight year, the Finance Ministry said Wednesday.
   Federal finances finished $795 million in the black, exceeding
the government target by $18.5 million, according to ministry
estimates.
   Last year, federal spending rose 11.6 percent to $16.9 billion,
but revenue rose 12 percent to $17.78 billion, the ministry said.
   Regional and local authorities in Switzerland spend much more
than the federal government, which accounts for only a small part of
national spending.

   A policeman has been fired for standing aside and
watching while three television reporters were beaten up, the
official Xinhua News Agency said Wednesday.
   The report said the reporters from a TV station in Jiangxi
province, southern China, were on their way to cover a story in
November and asked the policeman to help them through a traffic jam.
   Instead, the policeman pulled them out of their car and watched
while three men beat them up, Xinhua said.
   The report did not identify the assailants or explain why they
attacked the reporters.
   It said the ``local masses were indignant and protested'' when
the incident became known. The policeman was fired and the attackers
were charged with assault.
   The official China Daily also reported that a court in
northwestern Shaanxi province dismissed a lawsuit filed by a police
officer who said local journalists had defamed him with reports his
police station was crude and unsympathetic toward farmers. The judge
ruled the court must support constructive journalistic criticism of
public institutions and protect journalists' rights.

   Police divers found a tunnel under a prison block
that soon will house scores of leftist terrorist suspects, police
said Wednesday.
   The tunnel was more than 20 feet long and ended 60 feet short of
an outside wall of Rebibbia prison, on the outskirts of Rome, police
said.
   Police anticipated the arrival of Red Brigades and other leftist
terrorist suspects for the start of a trial, and recently began
scrutinizing the prison compound. Divers discovered the tunnel,
about 13 feet under ground, while they were inspecting the sewer
system, Italian news reports said.
   It was discovered a few days ago, said police officials who spoke
on condition of anonymity and declined to give many details.
   Paramilitary police announced Tuesday they had arrested three
people, one of them linked to a right-wing terrorist group, for
possessing explosives to be used in a planned escape from Rebibbia.

   All Nippon Airways said Wednesday it will buy 20 of

   The contracts will be signed shortly for delivery of four to six

between 1992 and 1996, said spokesman Takayuki Shimada.
   ANA, Japan's largest domestic airline, began flying international

   Under a 1986 contract, it received two B747-200s, with nine
others expected to be delivered by 1991.
   The B747-400s, which can carry 500 people, will be used on
domestic and international routes, Shimada said.
   ANA currently has a fleet of 102 aircraft, including 21 Boeing
747s, 11 TriStars, 34 Boeing 767s, 14 Boeing 737s, 11 Japanese
YS-11s and six Boeing 727s. It has ordered 20 Airbus A-320s to
replace the 737s and 727s on domestic routes after 1990.

<HEAD>Forest Fire Payment Plan Negotiable, Administration Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A controversial plan to pay for fire fighting
on public land is only a starting point for negotiations with
Congress on ways to trim the federal budget, an Agriculture
Department analyst said today.
   The plan was proposed in the Reagan budget sent to Congress in
January and has been endorsed by President Bush as part of the
on-going talks with Capitol Hill on ways to reduce spending.
   Under the Reagan proposal, part of the receipts collected by the
Agriculture and Interior departments for timber sales, mining,
recreation and other fee-paid activities _ that normally go to the
states _ would be used to pay fire-fighting bills.
   The plan was ``not directly addressed'' by Bush in his message to
Congress or in documents provided by the Office of Management and
Budget, ``but it wasn't overruled, either,'' said Mike McDonald of
the USDA's budget office.
   White House budget director Richard Darman calls the Reagan
budget proposals ``a starting point for negotiations in Congress,''
McDonald said in a telephone interview.
   For many years, the Forest Service has kicked back 25 percent of
its annual receipts to the states. In the 1988 fiscal year that
ended last Sept. 30, for example, more than $318 million went to 41
states and Puerto Rico. Oregon led with $144.5 million.
   McDonald said that under the plan, estimated fire costs would be
deducted from estimated total national receipts. The remainder then
would be apportioned to the states where the forests are located.
   As it stands now, each state's share of forest revenues would be
reduced by 18.4 percent.
   ``I've been telling people that whatever you got last year,
presuming that receipts are relatively steady ... the
receipt-sharing payment probably would be about 18.4 percent less
under the Reagan proposal,'' McDonald said.
   That is also the starting point for the Bush proposal, he said.
   ``The only difference betweena the two is the Reagan proposal was
more firm as part of the president's budget,'' McDonald said. ``The
Bush proposal is merely a starting point for negotiation.''
   Using the formula of 18.4 percent, this year's state shares of
the forest earnings _ assumming receipts are about the same as in
1988 _ would be reduced to less than $260 million from $318 million.
Oregon's share would drop to about $118 million from $145 million
last year.

<TEXT>
   Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke was
sworn in as a member of the Louisiana House today after surviving
two last-minute attempts to block him from taking his seat.
   Duke, a Republican, had overcome opposition by President Bush,
former President Reagan other prominent party leaders to defeat
homebuilder John Treen in Saturday's election in Metairie, a nearly
all-white suburb of New Orleans.
   ``I love this country and I love this state and I am anxious to
get to work and solve the problems of this state,'' Duke told a
packed House chamber today.
   Duke took the oath of office at 10:35 a.m. after the House voted
69-33 to table a motion by a freshman representative to investigate
Duke's credentials.
   Louisiana's House and Senate convened today for a special session
to consider rewriting the state's tax code.
   About 30 minutes before the Legislature convened, State District
Judge Clarence McManus rejected a motion by Treen to block Duke from
taking his seat. Treen, also a Republican, had contended that Duke
did not meet residency requirements.
   Odon Bacque, an independent legislator from Lafayette, then asked
the House to investigate whether Duke was a legal resident of the
district as he was called to the podium to receive the oath of
office. But the House voted to table the motion, clearing the way
for Duke, 38, to be sworn in.
   ``Men of principle must stand when principles are placed in
jeopardy and now is such a time,'' Bacque told the House.
   But Democratic Rep. John Alario urged the House to table the
motion, clearing the way for Duke to take his seat.
   ``I stand here today not to defend Mr. Duke but to defend
democracy. I am confident there is a super majority in this
Legislature who will stand for equal justice for all, no matter who
is elected to its membership,'' Alario said.
   Duke accused Bacque of engaging in ``political chicanery.''
   Duke's 227-vote margin of victory was certified Tuesday by the
secretary of state's office in Baton Rouge after the votes were
counted.
   Treen says Duke lived in a home a few blocks outside his district
and kept an apartment in the district so he could run there. State
law requires a candidate to have lived in the district he wants to
represent for at least a year.
   Duke declined to say whether he had two addresses but said he met
the residency requirements ``in every respect. It's a frivolous
challenge.''
   At a news conference in Baton Rouge, he said he had changed since
his days in the Klan and promised to silence his critics with his
work in the Legislature.
   ``I'm just really proud to live in America,'' said Duke. ``I'm
also looking forward to an end to the hoopla.''
   Duke left the Klan in 1980 but remains the president of the
National Association for the Advancement of White People, which he
describes as a civil rights group for everyone.
   ``I'm certainly not the David Duke I was during my years in the
Klan, but I'm certain I've grown like all people do, mentally,
spiritually,'' he said. ``I believe in the civil rights of all
people. I think the criticism I've endured will be muted by my
activities in the House of Representatives.''
   National Republican Party officials disagree with Louisiana GOP
leaders over how to respond to Duke's election. Under national party
Chairman Lee Atwater's direction, a resolution was prepared
declaring that Duke was ``not a Republican in gesture, deed or
belief.''
   The resolution was expected to be adopted by the party's
11-member executive council, which will confer by telephone Friday.
   But members of the Republican caucus at the Louisiana House said
there were no plans to bar Duke from their ranks if he was sworn in.
   Duke joined the GOP a few days before declaring his candidacy.
Treen is a longtime Republican who was backed by President Bush and
former President Reagan.
   Bush said in Washington that the unprecedented high-level
endorsements may have helped Duke inadvertantly. He said voters may
have considered his letter of support ``improper or overkill,'' but
added that Duke's record is ``one of racism and bigotry and, I'm
sorry, I just felt I had to speak out.''

<HEAD>Microwave Examined After Mystery Illness Hits Seven</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHEFFIELD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health officials were examining a new
microwave oven Wednesday after seven people, including an ambulance
worker and a doctor, fell ill mysteriously in its vicinity.
   Two people remained in a hospital isolation unit following the
incident, which occurred after the microwave and a TV set were
delivered to an apartment in a suburb of this north England city,
said police.
   The seven _ four people from the apartment, the doctor, his
driver and the ambulance worker _ felt dizziness, burning sensations
around their face and eyes, and some had convulsions, police said. A
dog in the apartment suffered symptoms as well.
   Police examined both appliances at the apartment and
environmental health officials took the microwave to a laboratory
for further examination.
   Rotherham Police Inspector Tony Swabey said the cause of the
illness was not known but ``we are looking at these appliances
closely because it is known that microwaves in particular can give
off rays.''
   The incident occurred early Wednesday at the apartment of Betty
Bisby, 52. Her two daughters _ Linda Young, 26, and Christine
Kendrick, 30 _ were staying the night, along with a family friend,
Les Jarvis, 55.
   After becoming ill, they called a doctor, who also became sick,
along with his driver. The doctor called an ambulance, and although
at the doctor's behest the worker who came inside wore protective
clothing, she suffered burning symptoms as well.
   Mrs. Young and Jarvis were treated at a hospital and released,
but Mrs. Bisby and Mrs. Kendrick remained in an isolation unit at
Sheffield's Lodge Moor Hospital.
   The three others did not require medical treatment.
   Fire crews checked the apartment but did not find any gas leaks
or toxic fumes. The environmental health department in Rotherham
refused comment.

<HEAD>Parents of Victims Decry Gaps in Federal Law</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 10 grafs new with testimony; picks up at pvs 3rd graf, Earlier
Tuesday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parents of two children who were sexually
attacked on the Cherokee Indian reservation said today that gaps in
federal laws covering Indian crimes made prosecution of the
offenders a four-year nightmare.
   Larry Blythe told a special Senate investigating subcommittee
that his 2-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son were raped in 1984
on the reservation in western North Carolina.
   He said trials were held and the abusers convicted, but their
life sentences were overturned on appeal because the prosecutors had
used a state law to obtain the convictions.
   State laws do not apply to crimes on Indian reservations.
   In a second trial, prosecutors searched the federal statutes for
language that referred to the rapes and could not find wording that
applied to such a crime against a boy.
   The defendant pleaded guilty last spring to assault causing
bodily harm and got a 10-year sentence, Blythe said.
   He said federal statutes have since been amended for cases like
his children's but similar loopholes could exist for other types of
crimes.
   ``I'd like to see them pass a law that the (federal) act affects
any crime on the reservations,'' he said.
   On Tuesday an FBI agent testified that child molesters gravitate
to Indian reservation schools because background checks are lax and
there are no laws requiring officials to report suspected cases of
sex abuse.
   David Small, supervisory special agent in Phoenix, told the panel
that molesters also seek teaching jobs on reservations because they
``usually are in remote areas, making it easy to prey on children.''
   Earlier Tuesday, a former teacher testified in a video tape that
he molested boys at the Cherokee Elementary School in western North
Carolina for 14 years before being caught.
   The teacher, Paul Wade Price, is serving a 10-year sentence at
Butner Federal Correctional Institution after pleading guilty in
1986 to one count of child molestation. In the taped interview, he
said he molested at least 25 boys, ages 8 to 12.
   Congress in 1974 passed a law saying states would lose federal
funds if they did not enact statutes making it a crime to withhold
information about suspected child sex abuse in schools. But state
law does not apply to Indian reservations, where BIA schools are
totally federally financed. The federal government lacks such a law.
   Child sex abuse on reservations is the topic of hearings this
week by a special unit of the Senate Select Committee on Indian
Affairs, which also has been looking into corruption in Indian
contracting procedures and organized crime involvement in gaming
operations on reservations.
   After hearing from Price and two mothers whose sons were molested
by him, the committee listened to eight witnesses from law
enforcement agencies and the Indian Affairs bureau who all said the
federal government should pass a law requiring that cases of
suspected child sex abuse be reported.
   Witnesses from the BIA said that despite a new policy requiring
school personnel to report cases of sex abuse, the BIA does not get
much information. William Mehojah, BIA branch chief for Indian
elementary and secondary school programs, said no disciplinary
action has ever been taken for failure to report.
   Robert Haley, general chairman of the Indian law enforcement
section of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, said
investigation of child abuse cases are sometimes hampered by the
refusal of tribes to let the children off the reservation to testify.
   He said U.S. attorneys should be given the power to get the
testimony.
   Mehojah said many teachers have gone to work before background
checks were complete because of paperwork delays.
   Other testimony indicated that even when schools are warned about
the history of a potential teacher, that teacher may get hired
anyway.
   Arthur Justice, dean of education at the University of South
Carolina-Spartanburg, testified that he had been instrumental in
removing Price as a seventh grade teacher in 1972 from another
school and had warned the Cherokee school officials about him, but
14 years passed before Price was removed.
   Ollie Locust, a teacher's aide at Cherokee elementary, said she
saw Price fondling a boy in the hallway and told the school
principal, but nothing was done.
   Teacher Betty Brintnall and Ms. Locust said it was common
knowledge around the school that Price had a penchant for young
boys, but no action was taken until a mother complained.
   Agent Small said he knew of other cases in which Indian school
administrators knew that a teacher had been molesting students, but
would not tell the next school system that hired him.
   ``It's an easy out,'' said Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who
chairs the special investigative committee. ``Let the person
resign.''
   ``I never have seen a more clear failure of government
responsibility to U.S. citizens than we have seen in the last few
days,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a committee member. ``What
is so tragic in this case is that they are little children.''

   A store clerk in a bulletproof glass
cashier's cage told police she simply grinned and telephoned for
help when a man who said he had a gun tried to rob her.
   Night shift clerk Judy Frisco, 39, said the hold-up man came into
her service station-grocery early Tuesday and said, ``I want your
money. ... I have a 9mm and I am going to get you. ... I can blow
this window away.''
   But Ms. Frisco apparently did not believe he could. She began

   Members of every opposition party walked
out of Parliament today to protest the government's acceptance of
$470 million from Union Carbide for the 1984 Bhopal gas leak, which
killed 3,400 people.
   When the legislators met a second time to discuss the Feb. 14
settlement with the Danbury, Conn.-based corporation, several
lawmakers denounced the amount paid by Union Carbide as too low.
   At the Supreme Court, a petition filed today sought $600 million
in damages from Union Carbide for the world's deadliest industrial
accident.
   The Association for Socio-Legal Literacy, a social service group,
sought the higher award because the high court's Feb. 14 settlement
rendered the gas victims without further legal remedy.
   The government settled after suing for $3 billion.
   Opposition legislators yelling ``surrender to multinationals!''
left Parliament after House Speaker Balram Jakhar refused to admit a
censure motion against the government's acceptance of the Supreme
Court's Feb. 14 order that instructed Union Carbide to pay the $470
million as full and final settlement.
   Madhu Dandavate, the leader of the opposition in Parliament and a
member of the Janata Party, said: ``What we are talking about is
very basic. The fundamental right to human life has been violated by
the Supreme Court order.''
   About 300 legislators were in Parliament when the opposition
walked out. The Congress Party holds 412 of the 544 seats.
   In the special session on the Bhopal session later today,
Communist Party legislator Saifuddin Chowdhury chastised the
settlement. ``Is human life so cheap in this country we must accept
such a low amount?'' he said.
   Legislators from the governing Congress Party defended the
settlement, but even some of them said it was too low.
   K.N. Pradhan, a legislator from Bhopal, said: ``I agree the
compensation is very low, but at least it is money in hand. What
good would $3 billion have done after 20 years when the cases were
finally settled and all the victims were dead.'' The debate was
inconclusive.
   About 2,500 surviving victims of the Dec. 3, 1984 disaster, when
methyl isocyanate leaked from the pesticide plant of a Carbide
subsidiary, came to the Indian capital Tuesday to protest the
settlement, saying the sum was too low and demanding that Union
Carbide officials be hanged.
   The pesticide plant in Bhopal, the state capital, was operated by
Union Carbide of India Ltd., a subsidiary of the U.S. multinational.

<TEXT>
   A woman who authorities say had a
long-standing rivalry with a sister found stabbed to death this week
has been arraigned on charges of helping the killers escape.
   Wearing a jail uniform and frequently weeping, Shari L. Bierman,
20, appeared Tuesday in Wyandotte County Circuit Court to face
charges of felony theft and aiding a felon to escape in the death of
Syndi S. Bierman, 17, an honor student and athlete at Piper High
School.
   Miss Bierman's beaten and stabbed body was found Sunday in the
bedroom of her home in Piper, an unincorporated community of about
2,500 people about 20 miles northwest of Kansas City.
   Shari Bierman's boyfriend, Conrad Joseph Hernandez, 24, and
Archie E. Owens Jr., 20, were charged in absentia with the killing.
   Hernandez surrendered today to Oklahoma authorities after a
disagreement with his companions over whether to surrender, police
said. Owens remained at large.
   Hernandez indicated he would waive extradition to face the
charges, said Sgt. John Bowman, a Tulsa police spokesman.
   Shari Bierman was held under $50,000 bond after District Attorney
Nick Tomasic told the judge that the investigation was continuing
and that additional charges could be filed against her. He also said
she should be held for her own safety until Owens and Hernandez were
captured.
   The men were stopped Monday while hitchhiking in Oklahoma, but
authorities there didn't know they were wanted in Kansas and didn't
detain them.
   Rick Grosko of the Wyandotte County Sheriff's Department said
there had been a long history of animosity between the two sisters.
``They seemed to go together like oil and water,'' he said.
   ``There was jealousy because Syndi is pretty and popular, Shari
got pregnant and dropped out,'' said Lisa Hennessy, who had been
visiting the younger sister at the Bierman home Saturday night
before the slaying.
   Syndi Bierman was upstairs preparing for bed after a visit from
two friends, while her sister and the two men were downstairs in the
basement, Tomasic said.
   Tomasic said the two men began removing items from the house and
confronted Syndi Bierman, making sexual advances toward her. In the
attack that followed, her throat was cut and she was stabbed in the
chest and abdomen and beaten, officials said.
   Authorities said it was unclear where Shari Bierman was during
the attack. She phoned the sheriff's department to report a burglary
and her sister's body was found when officers arrived.

   Writers today denounced Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's call for
the death of Salman Rushdie, and West Germany asked the U.N.
Security Council to address the issue. President Bush said he
supports moves to isolate the Islamic republic.
   Khomeini said the Western reaction proved it was wrong for Iran
to open contacts to the rest of the world.
   A conference of Moslem theologians in Saudi Arabia said Rushdie,
who was born into a Moslem family, should stand trial in an Islamic
country for his novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' a Saudi newspaper
reported today.
   Rushdie's wife, American novelist Marianne Wiggins, canceled a
U.S. book-promotion tour to stay with her husband, who is in hiding
in Britain. She had planned the tour to promote ``John Dollar,'' her
latest novel.
   Anti-terrorist police today guarded a plant in Cles, Italy, where
``The Satanic Verses'' was being printed, and Italians placed
hundreds of orders for it as a publisher prepared to release a
second run of the controversial book.
   West Germany, Iran's biggest trading partner, said today it had
canceled two visits by Cabinet ministers to Iran, and it called on
the Security Council to take up the issue.
   A West German television network said the Cabinet also discussed
``further measures'' against Iran. ``If the mullahs adhere to the
execution order against (Rushdie), then economic sanctions will no
longer be ruled out,'' the ZDF network reported.
   West Germany already has decided to remove its ambassador from
Tehran as part of an action by the 12 European Economic Community
countries.
   Bush said on Tuesday he supported the EEC decision and told a
news conference in Washington that no matter how offensive Rushdie's
book may be to Moslems, ``inciting murder and offering rewards for
its perpetration are deeply offensive to the norms of civilized
behavior.''
   Khomeini, who issued a death sentence on Rushdie on Feb. 14, said
economic sanctions will not change his stance, and he said
publication of ``The Satanic Verses'' was a sign from God that Iran
should not reach out to Western nations.
   ``God wanted it to happen in this way so that we may no longer
think in simplistic ways,'' he said.
   Hundreds of literary figures marched outside the Iranian Mission
to the United Nations in New York this morning and then to two Fifth
Avenue book stores _ B. Dalton's and Barnes &amp; Noble _ which have
pulled ``The Satanic Verses'' from their shelves.
   ``I write controversial books. What publisher is now going to
take chances with a controversial book?'' asked activist Abbie
Hoffman, one of those participating.
   A trio of Yale University graduates set up a toll-free number
through which anyone may order the book. The number, 1-800-544-7475,
was scheduled to go into effect at 3 p.m., said Kevin Kiernan of
Manhattan.
   The novel, which some say insults Islam, will debut as No. 2 on
The New York Times Book Review's best-selling hardcover fiction list
in the March 5 issue, the Times said today.
   The paper published a full-page advertisement from the
Association of American Publishers, the American Booksellers
Assocation and the American Library Association that says: ``Free
people write books, free people publish books, free people buy
books, free people read books.''
   In the Netherlands, more than 800 Dutch writers, artists,
publishers and journalists today took out a half-page ad in national
newspapers requesting their government to break diplomatic ties with
Iran if the execution order is not rescinded.
   Publishers in France, West Germany, Greece and Turkey canceled
plans to publish the book, which has been banned by at least seven
countries, including India, Pakistan and Egypt.
   Canada's revenue minister, Otto Jelinek, who made the decision
not to ban ``The Satanic Verses'' in Canada, said he was under
police guard after receiving death threats.
   In London, the 2,000-member International Press Institute
deplored the death threats against Rushdie as ``a gross violation of
civilized standards on the right of life and the right to freedom of
expression.''
   The Moslem World League, meeting in Saudi Arabia, said Rushdie
should be tried in absentia in an Islamic state ``for his ...
misleading allegations against Islam,'' the London-based newspaper
Al-Sharq Al-Awsat reported.
   Many Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' is sacrilegious because
it casts doubt on central tenets of the Islamic faith. The book, for
example, portrays the prophet Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and
suggests he wrote the Koran, the holy book of Islam, rather than
receiving it from God.
   Nicholas Browne, Britain's charges d'affaires in Iran, returned
home with two other top diplomats today and said: ``The statements
by Ayatollah Khomeini have given us no choice but to leave Tehran.''
   A total of $5.2 million has been offered by Iranian clerics for
Rushdie's murder. The writer issued an apology Saturday, but
Khomeini rejected it.

   Guerrillas knocked out 40
percent of the nation's electric power lines and attacked military
positions in at least six towns today, one day after offering to
stop fighting if elections are delayed.
   The Farabundo Marti guerrilla radio said four soldiers were
killed and 21 injured in the attacks. The military did not release a
casualty list.
   Military sources who requested anonymity said that at least one
guerrilla was killed and two wounded.
   On Tuesday the rebels attacked two military installations,
killing eight people and wounding 17. On the same day, their leaders
offered to disarm if the military is sharply cut and presidential
elections are postponed.
   Guerrilla sabotage today put seven of the state power company's
19 high power electric lines out of service today, said a spokesman
for the company.
   Local civil authorities said the sites attacked today included
the northeastern town of Metapan, the northern towns of San Miguel
de Mercedes and Potonico, and the eastern towns of Usulutan and
Chinameca.
   In downtown San Salvador, a bomb partially destroyed a local
headquarters of the National Workers' Federation, but there were no
casualties and responsibility for the blast was unclear.
   El Salvador's major political parties were meeting in Mexico on
Tuesday with senior rebel commanders to discuss the guerrillas'
proposal to end the nine-year war.
   On Tuesday, rebels attacked the 4,000-member 1st Brigade's
headquarters. It was the fifth attack on a major military
installation in this capital since November.
   With jurisdiction over the capital and its environs, the brigade
headquarters is considered the country's most important military
installation.
   The 1st Brigade's commander reported no casualties inside the
downtown base and said damage was negligible. The rebels used two
pickup trucks fitted with catapults. The detonation of one explosive
charge launches the bombs and simultaneously blows up the vehicle.
   The 6:20 a.m. explosion of one vehicle killed Pedro Martinez and
his wife, Maria Teresa, an elderly couple who lived near the
headquarters.
   The rebels also attacked the headquarters of the Detachment of
Engineers in Zacatecoluca, 35 miles southeast of San Salvador.
Officers said four soldiers, including a major, were killed at
Zacatecoluca and a civilian and a Civil Defense trooper were killed
in fighting nearby.
   In Zacatecoluca, guerrillas and soldiers battled three hours
before dawn around the engineer's base.
   Base commander Col. Benjamin Canjura said Maj. Donald Sampson was
killed in the fighting. Three other soliders were reported killed
when a rocket-propelled grenade hit the truck they were traveling
in. One civilian and one Civil Defense trooper were killed in a
clash in a nearby village.
   Canjura said 13 soliders and one civilian were wounded in the
fighting. There was no immediate word on guerrilla casualties.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Jews who studied their religion
clandestinely for years came out into the open Wednesday to enroll
in the first school of Jewish studies in the country since Stalin's
time.
   The opening of the Judaic Studies Center ``is the event we've
been awaiting all our conscious lives,'' said Yuriel Neishtadt, who
sported a full black beard and wore a hand-woven religious skull cap.
   Neishtadt, 31, said he secretly studied Hebrew and Jewish prayers
with small groups of friends.
   Until recently, Soviets were jailed for teaching Hebrew. Among
the most prominent teachers was Josef Begun, who served more than
three years in prison on charges of anti-Soviet agitation and
propaganda, before being released exactly two years ago. He
emigrated to Israel in January 1988.
   In a symmetry of history permitted by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reforms, Neishtadt and other Soviet Jews will be taking
classes from descendants of some of the country's Jewish leaders.
   Rabbi Gedalya Rabinowitz, director of Yeshiva Oholei Yitzhak in
Jerusalem, told about 200 people gathered for the opening that his
``great grandfather's great grandfather'' had established a Jewish
school in Moscow 150 years ago.
   ``And now I am here 150 years later at the inauguration of a new
house of study and prayer,'' said the gray-bearded Rabinowitz. He
then gave the center's first lecture, about customs of the
springtime holiday of Passover.
   Rabbi Joel Poupko, director of Judaica for the Jewish Community
Centers of Chicago, said his grandfather headed a Yeshiva in the
Russian city of Yelets but was imprisoned under dictator Josef
Stalin in 1926.
   ``It is some 63 years later, and we give thanks to almighty
God,'' Poupko told the audience at the House of Scientists.
   The Jewish center, known as a Yeshiva, will be housed elsewhere
in Moscow, in an apartment complex owned by the Soviet Academy of
Sciences. On the Soviet side, the center is organized by the Academy
of World Civilizations, a branch of a Geneva-based group of
scientists known as the World Laboratory. On the Western side, help
comes from the Aleph Society, a group of philanthropists in Israel
and the United States that supports the work of Rabbi Adin
Steinsaltz, one of the world's most prominent specialists on the
Jewish Talmud and a teacher at the new center.
   The center, with an initial enrollment of 80 students, will train
rabbis and scholars in the Bible, the Talmud, Jewish law and history.
   Another of the visiting scholars, David Berger, a history
professor at Brooklyn College, said he helped interview prospective
students and was almost brought to tears. One man in his 20s who had
studied with his father began his interview by citing from memory a
passage from the Torah in Hebrew, Berger said.
   ``There's a level of commitment that is really remarkable and you
don't see it in the West where we take things for granted,'' Berger
said.
   But one student who was chosen accused the Soviet government of
supporting the center purely for ``propagandistic purposes'' and
said some would-be classmates were discouraged from enrolling. The
student spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Gorbachev has opened many doors for Jews and other religious
groups, and has promised changes in a 1929 law prohibiting religious
classes for the young.
   For the Soviet Union's estimated 1.8 million Jews, the
liberalization has meant an increase in emigration, the opening last
week of the first Jewish cultural center in the Soviet Union in more
than 50 years, greater tolerance of religious celebrations and less
repression of Jewish activists.
   On Tuesday, leaders of the Washington-based B'nai B'rith group _
once villified in the Soviet press and popular literature _
presented a founding charter for a branch to 40 Moscow Jews, said
spokesman Daniel Mariaschin.
   Steinsaltz said the Soviet Union was once the ``Jewish

status.
   However, he cited a Jewish saying that cautions: ``Every
beginning should be judged by what comes after.''

<HEAD>China Denounces Calls for Amnesty for Political Prisoners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>

   The government Wednesday denounced calls for an
amnesty for political prisoners as ``interfering in the
administration of justice.''
   ``It is against China's legal principles ... to stir up public
opinion in an attempt to overturn independent jurisdiction by
soliciting signatures,'' the official Xinhua News Agency quoted an
unidentified Justice Ministry official as saying.
   It was the first government response to a series of calls by
Chinese intellectuals for the release of political prisoners,
especially activist Wei Jingsheng, who has been jailed since 1979.
   Leading dissident Fang Lizhi first suggested an amnesty last
month in an open letter to senior leader Deng Xiaoping. Last week,
33 intellectuals, including some of China's most famous writers and
thinkers, sent the government and ruling Communist Party a second
letter appealing for an amnesty.
   Since then, nearly 50 more people have signed a petition
supporting the appeal, as have more than 600 Chinese citizens in the
United States. Thirty-two scholars in Nationalist-ruled Taiwan have
signed a statement of support.
   ``We wanted to show our support for this wonderful idea,'' said
Hong Zhu in Cambridge, Mass., who signed with her husband, mainland
journalist Liu Binyan.
   Liu, 64, a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University, is the most
famous of the Chinese who have signed in the United States. He was
fired as a reporter for China's leading newspaper, the People's
Daily, and kicked out of the Communist Party in 1987 because of his
crusade against government corruption.
   ``I know the authorities will not be too happy about this, but I
don't think they can do anything to us,'' Hong said of the petition.
She said more than 600 names of signers were published Tuesday in
Chinese-language newspapers in New York.
   The London-based human rights group Amnesty International
estimates China has thousands of prisoners of conscience.
   Xinhua quoted the Justice Ministry official as saying, ``No
organization, be it a political party, government, people's congress
or any other institution, nor any person has the power to alter a
court verdict.''
   He added, ``It is my hope that people will maintain a sober
attitude and safeguard China's political environment characterized
by stability, unity, democracy and harmony.''
   The official did not say if any action would be taken against
those who signed the letters and petitions. He mentioned by name
only one signer, Chen Jun, 30, who studied in the United States and
now runs a private bar. He distributed copies of the letters to
reporters last week.
   Other signers included Bing Xin, 87, one of pre-revolutionary
China's most famous woman writers; well-known poet Bei Dao and Su
Shaozhi, a leading Marxist theorist.
   The official noted that while in the United States, Chun
contributed to the magazine China Spring, which China considers
reactionary and has banned. The New York-based China Spring is run
by Chinese nationals and defectors, and promotes democratic reform
in China.
   The magazine's editor, Ding Chu, said in an interview it is
helping collect signatures in the United States in support of the
proposed amnesty.
   Ding, a graduate student at Long Island University who said he
plans to return to China, said supporters will be going to New
York's Chinatown to collect signatures.
   ``We are trying to get 20,000,'' he said. There are more than
30,000 Chinese studying in the United States, with dozens more
scholars visiting to lecture or do research.
   The call for a political amnesty comes during one of the most
lively periods of political debate in China in a decade. For several
heady months in 1978-79, the government did not interfere as Chinese
put up thousands of protest posters on a Beijing wall that was
dubbed Democracy Wall and small unofficial magazines were circulated
calling for democracy.
   But in the spring of 1979, officials began arresting Democracy
Wall participants, including one of the leaders, Wei Jingsheng. Wei
remains in jail and is rumored to have gone insane.

<HEAD>78-Year-Old Man Sentenced To Two Years House Arrest In Shooting of
Wife</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYANN MROWCA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRIENDSHIP, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 78-year-old man who fatally shot his
bedridden wife and then swallowed a handful of pills was sentenced
today to two years of house arrest.
   Frank J. Reinl also was placed on 10 years of probation by Adams
County Circuit Judge Raymond Gieringer, whose voice cracked and who
paused several times during an hourlong sentencing hearing.
   ``Sir, what you did was absolutely wrong. The court cannot
condone it,'' the judge said. ``You may have considered it an
ultimate act of love _ I believe you did _ but it was wrong.''
   Before he was sentenced, Reinl cried, trying to explain briefly
why he killed his wife.
   ``I realized she could not be alone for a single second,'' he
told the judge.
   He described how his wife, who had suffered a series of strokes
and had been released from a hospital six days before the shooting,
kept getting out of bed to go to the bathroom every few seconds.
   Reinl pleaded guilty in November to one count of second-degree
murder in the Feb. 8, 1988, shooting of his wife, Rose, 73.
   Shortly before the shooting, Reinl had lost more than 30 pounds
and learned he had progressive leukemia, defense attorney Gary
Kryshak said.
   ``There is nothing that this court is going to do that is going
to punish Frank Reinl more than the fact that he has to live with
what he did,'' Kryshak said.
   Adams County District Attorney Mark Thibodeau agreed, saying it
was obvious that he loved his wife. Reinl had been meticulous in her
care since she suffered her first stroke in June 1987 and called the
doctor to the point of being bothersome, he said.
   But the prosecutor said what Reinl did was still wrong and a
message had to be sent to the public that it would not be condoned.
   ``It would serve no purpose to put you in prison. The prisons are
already full,'' the judge told Reinl. ``But his court must send a
message that it's not OK to take a life, not even a loved one.''
   He also ordered Reinl to pay $5,000 to start a crime prevention
fund, noting that the presentence report indicated he was ``a man of
some means.''

   Three bodies have been recovered
from a grain mill that was destroyed in an explosion and subsequent
fire, but four workers remained missing, it was reported Wednesday.
   Seven people were hospitalized, the official CTK news agency
said, adding only that six of them were ``out of danger.''
   The explosion took place just after noon Tuesday in a four-story
grain mill at Surany in western Slovakia.
   The Communist Party daily newspaper Rude Pravo said 15 fire
brigades from surrounding towns were called in to help extinguish
the fire that caused an estimated $200,000 in damage.
   Experts were seent to the scene to investigate the cause of the
blast.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Says He Wasn't Satisfied With Denials About North</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: CORRECTS attribution of quote to Hamilton sted McFarlane in
20th graf, `I do''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The former chairman of the House intelligence
committee testified today that he wasn't satisfied with White House
denials of news reports that Oliver L. North was helping Nicaraguan
rebels in defiance of a congressional ban on such assistance.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., testified that then-national security
adviser Robert McFarlane assured him in two letters and a 1985
committee briefing that neither North nor other National Security
Council aides was helping the Contra guerrillas.
   ``Were you satisfied with the response?'' prosecutor John W.
Keker asked Hamilton, the lead-off witness at North's trial in U.S.
District Court.
   ``No, I was not,'' Hamilton replied. ``The press stories
continued in large numbers; it was of great interest to Congress.''
   The inquiries were first made in August 1985 following news
reports that North was helping raise money for the Contras and
giving the rebels tactical military advice despite prohibitions on
U.S. aid first enacted by Congress in the so-called Boland Amendment
of 1984.
   ``This was the most controversial matter of policy in Washington
at the time,'' Hamilton testified. ``It was not possible for me to
go onto the floor of the House of Representatives without members
asking me about the news stories.''
   Prosecutors are trying to show that North, then a Marine
lieutenant colonel serving on the NSC staff, subverted the processes
of government by helping McFarlane draft false answers to letters
from Congress inquiring about the news reports of his activities.
   Accurate answers to congressional inquiries are needed, Hamilton
said, because ``we can't fulfill our responsibility unless we have
accurate information from the executive branch.''
   Keker asked Hamilton ``whether it's all right to go and lie to
the intelligence committee?''
   ``No,'' the lawmaker replied.
   The question and answer drew a defense objection that was
sustained by Judge Gerhard A. Gesell.
   North is charged, among other things, with obstructing
congressional inquiries into his activities in 1985 and 1986.
McFarlane, who is expected to testify as a prosecution witness, has
pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor counts of withholding information
from Congress.
   Following further reports of his activities, the committee
questioned North directly during an Aug. 6, 1986 meeting in the
White House Situation Room, Hamilton said.
   ``Colonel North insisted they had not violated the Boland
Amendment and that they had not assisted the Contras by raising
money and had not provided any military advice to the Contras,'' he
said, recalling the meeting.
   ``My recollection is clear, that Colonel North insisted there was
no violation of the Boland Amendment,'' the congressman said.
   Hamilton said the news reports about North's fundraising
activities sparked ``enormous interest'' among House members because
``the debate in this country through a large part of the 1980s was
on whether or not the Contras should be funded by the United States
government.''
   ``That became a very controversial debate,'' Hamilton said,
culminating in the passage of the Boland Amendment that prohibited
U.S. intelligence agencies from using money to help the Contras.
   Under defense cross-examination, Hamilton conceded that the
series of Boland Amendments were a confusing set of laws but
insisted that ``there was throughout that period of time a
prohibition of any aid for military or paramilitary activities.''
   He also dismissed a suggestion by North's chief defense lawyer,
Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., that the Boland Amendment did not apply to
the NSC.
   ``I do not recall anyone saying to me this language does not
apply to the National Security Council,'' Hamilton said. ``The
letter Mr. McFarlane wrote to me specifically said that the language
did apply and I accepted that.''
   It was only after this period that supporters of Contra aid
claimed that the amendment did not apply to the NSC, Hamilton said.
   He conceded, however, that ``I do not read that language as
applying to the president of the United States'' provided the chief
executive does not use the CIA, the Defense Department or other
intelligence agencies to aid the Contras.
   During direct examination, Keker tried to undercut the claim in
Tuesday's opening argument by Sullivan that Congress couldn't be
trusted with secrets because it ``leaked like a sieve.''
   Hamilton said the White House shared secrets with the
intelligence committee throughout his two-year tenure as its
chairman. Those secrets were carefully guarded by the 16-member
panel, he said.
   ``I am not aware of any information that I was not permitted to
see,'' Hamilton said. ``I was never refused a request for
information.''
   North is charged with nine felony counts of lying to Congress and
to a presidential investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.
   He also is charged with illegally using a tax-exempt foundation
to raise private donations to arm the Contras, and with two counts
alleging he personally profited from the Iran-Contra affair.
   North faces up to 60 years in prison and fines totaling $3
million if convicted on all counts.

   The State Department expressed deep regret
Wednesday over the sentencing of a dissident Czech playwright,
calling it ``bitter testimony'' to the lack of human rights in
Czechoslovakia.
   Vaclav Havel, a human rights activist, was sentenced Tuesday to a
nine-month prison term after he was convicted of inciting people to
attend what Czech authorities regarded as an anti-government
demonstration last month.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said that the
administration had strongly urged the Czechoslovak government last
week to drop the charges against Havel and to enter into a dialogue
with dissident groups in Czechoslovakia.
   ``Mr. Havel's trial yesterday and his nine-month sentence are
bitter testimony to the lack of respect for fundamental human rights
in Czechoslovakia,'' Redman said.
   He noted in particular that much of the government's case on the
incitement charge against Havel apparently involved his interviews
with Western media, including Radio Free Europe.
   Ironically, Redman said, these interviews were intended by Havel
to head off a reported plan by a group to repeat a 1969 act of
self-immolation by Jan Palach, a student who was protesting the
Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia the previous year.
   ``Havel had been thwarted in his efforts to use Czechoslovak
media to appeal to this group not to commit such an act and had
turned in frustration to Western media, which routinely provide
information of broad interest to Czechoslovak public opinion, which
official media do not carry,'' Redman said.
   ``We're also troubled by reports that even more individuals may
face charges arising from last month's peaceful demonstration in
Prague. We again urge the Czechoslovak government to abandon the
confrontational practices of the past.''

   Scores of saffron-robed Soviet Hare
Krishna devotees chanted and danced in ecstasy after they arrived in
the land where their faith began.
   The 49 men _ all but one with shaven heads _ and 10 women arrived
from Moscow on Tuesday to begin a three-week pilgrimage.
   ``We are in the land of Caitanya!'' they shouted as they ran from
an Aeroflot plane into Calcutta airport's arrival lounge.
   Caitanya is the 14th century Indian Hindu philosopher whose
teachings are followed by devotees around the world.
   Under the leadership of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
the Kremlin has sought to portray itself as more tolerant of
religions.
   Although Soviet law does not forbid the practicing of religion,
it requires that religious groups be registered with the state. Hare
Krishnas have said in the past that authorities have refused to
register them or failed to respond to their requests for
registration. They have claimed that Hare Krishnas have been jailed
or placed in psychiatric hospitals as recently as August 1987.
   ``Gorbachev's perestroika and glasnost has really worked. We are
here thanks to the new policy of our leader,'' said Olga Kiscleva, a
Moscow teacher and poet in her early 30s.
   She said she joined the Hare Krishna movement nearly 18 years ago.
   The pilgrims said they were the first followers of the Soviet
Union's International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskcon)
allowed to make a foreign visit.
   At a news conference, Ms. Kiscleva and other members of the group
said their movement had only recently attained tolerance in the
Soviet Union.
   ``Until April 1988 Iskcon was virtually banned in the Soviet
Union,'' Ms. Kiscleva said. ``During that period many of the Iskcon
followers were jailed. Then came May 1988 when Iskcon was given
Soviet official recognition. We are now free to practice our
religion publicly.''
   She said there were 450 ``initiated Iskcon devotees'' in the
Soviet Union and at least 10,000 other Hare Krishna followers.
``They are living in 60 different cities and preaching the Iskcon
philosophy,'' she said.
   Their ranks included writers, artists, teachers, engineers and
scientists, Ms. Kiscleva said.
   ``Ours is the first group to visit India, the birthplace of Lord
Caitanya. Many more will follow,'' she added.
   The chant of ``Hare Krishna'' _ ``Praise Krishna'' _ was
recommended by Caitanya as the simplest form of prayer to the Hindu
deity. Krishna, who personifies the ideal child, lover and
philosopher, is revered as one of the 10 incarnations of Lord
Vishnu, a member of Hinduism's supreme trinity of gods.
   The Soviets plan to spend a few days in Calcutta and then embark
on a tour of temples in India. They are scheduled to return to
Moscow on April 15.

   ``She calls me Charlie and that's fine,'' said
Charles H. Price II, U.S. ambassador to the Court of St. James's.
``I always refer to her as prime minister.''
   Price was talking about the relationship he has forged with
Margaret Thatcher during a 5{-year spell as ambassador to the Reagan
administration's close ally.
   He said the first call he got at the embassy on the night of the
Pan Am air disaster was from Mrs. Thatcher, offering him a ride to
the crash site in Lockerbie, Scotland.
   He ended up going on his own, but Mrs. Thatcher's gesture was ``a
measure of how considerate and thoughtful she is,'' he said.
   Price, 57, returns this month to his native Kansas City, Mo., to
resume his banking career as an executive and chairman-designate of
Ameribanc Inc. His successor is President Bush's nominee, Henry
Catto, a onetime U.S. chief of protocol.
   Ronald Reagan's man in Margaret Thatcher's Britain has had a U.S.
foreign service plum: an imposing embassy in Grosvenor Square and an
elegant residence, Winfield House, in 12 acres of private grounds in
Regent's Park, and an Anglo-American relationship that has seldom
been closer.
   Yet, his years of service were a trying time for the United
States and its West European allies.
   The 1987 treaty to remove the superpowers' medium- and
shorter-range nuclear missiles from Europe raised old West European
anxieties about America loosening the mutual defense
responsibilities within the NATO alliance. European Economic
Community moves to dismantle internal trade barriers by 1992 raised
U.S. fears of a ``Fortress Europe'' looming to keep out U.S. goods.
   Price predicts that in the next few years the Bush
administration, driven by pressure in Congress to make the Europeans
pay more for their defense, will fulfill one of Mrs. Thatcher's
worst fears and reduce the 325,000 U.S. troops in Europe.
   ``Burden-sharing,'' said Price of the arguments about defense
spending within the alliance, ``is a real issue which is potentially
divisive.''
   ``When Americans think about the fact ... that the cost of
maintaining that (troop) presence is larger than the combined
contribution of all the other allies, that becomes a very simplistic
thing that politicians can latch on to quickly in the fact of the
(federal) budget deficit problem,'' adds Price.
   ``I would not necessarily be surprised if in the course of the
next 2-3 years there was an American troop reduction.''
   On trade relations, Price is more optimistic, despite a current
dispute over an EEC ban on hormone-treated U.S. beef that has the
seeds of a damaging trade war.
   Price returns home a committed Anglophile, unshaken by
demonstrations over nuclear arms and the biggest protest this decade
at the embassy when 6,000 people converged after the 1986 U.S.
bombing of Libya. Mrs. Thatcher provoked a domestic uproar by
allowing the bombers to fly from British bases.
   Price, who built up an inherited candy business in Kansas City
and branched into banking, was named ambassador to Belgium at the
start of Reagan's first term. He arrived in London in 1983 to
replace John Louis, who made little impact as ambassador.
   Price often has been a go-between, and he traveled regularly on
the British prime minister's plane as the Thatcher-Reagan rapport
grew.
   Aides said he displayed a keen grasp of issues _ praise not
always given by career diplomats who sometimes grumble that
political appointee ambassadors are ill-informed figureheads
enjoying the fruits of their election campaign contributions.
   The Prices are leaving Winfield House a gift of a sculpture of
Barbara Hutton, the Woolworth heiress who built the beautiful
neo-Georgian house 50 years ago and gave it to the United States as
a residence for the ambassador in 1946.

   President Bush's nomination of John Tower to
become defense secretary ran into fresh difficulty today when two
Democratic senators said the latest FBI background report does not
end questions about Tower's drinking habits.
   ``It is not the clean bill of health that one would have us
believe,'' Sen. J. James Exon, D-Neb. told reporters.
   ``If he (Tower) hadn't touched anything but a couple of glasses
of wine at dinner since 1982 I wouldn't be concerned. There are
parts of the report that indicate that several people don't think
that's the case,'' Exon said.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., also questioned anonymous White House
officials who have been quoted in published reports in recent days
as saying the report found Tower had a drinking problem in the 1970s
but no longer does.
   ``That is not an accurate description of that file,'' said Levin.
   The Democrats spoke with reporters as many Republicans, taking
their cue from Bush, were rallying around Tower.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said this morning on NBC's ``Today''
program that he believed the tide was turning in Tower's favor,
adding, ``So far there has been no substance to this veritable
blizzard of allegations that we have seen.''
   Levin and Exon both are members of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, which scheduled a closed-door meeting today to discuss
the latest FBI report.
   The panel had tentatively been expected to vote on the nomination
Thursday, and Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the committee's senior
Republican, said he hoped that would still be the case.
   Bush gave Tower a strong vote of confidence on Tuesday and said
the FBI report had ``gunned down'' the allegations against Tower.
   But Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., said on NBC this morning he had
reservations about taking a vote Thursday.
   ``I'd have to say there's a lot of hearsay and innuendo in there
(the FBI's latest background report on Tower's activities), on the
other hand, there are some substantive things that I think need
further evaluation,'' Dixon said.
   The report included some damaging allegations, Dixon said,
including ``recent statements, not things from the 1970s,
unfortunately by people that refuse to be identified.'' The
allegations were mostly regarding Tower's personal actions rather
than his business connections, he said.
   McCain said he had reviewed the FBI's findings on allegations of
drinking problems, womanizing and financial irregularities, and saw
nothing to disqualify the former senator from the Pentagon job.
   ``We've been at this now for 10 weeks. We're starting to affect
national security. This process could go on forever. We need a
secretary of defense,'' McCain said today.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the committee chairman, declined Tuesday to
say how he intends to vote, saying: ``I want to hear what other
people think, too.''
   Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., circulated a letter he wrote four days
ago to the Denver Post in which he said he was ``troubled'' by some
allegations against Tower. An aide said he had no further
information on Wirth's views.
   On Tuesday morning, Bush used a news conference to announce that
the FBI had ``gunned down'' the allegations made against Tower.
   ``What I got from it was that there has been a very unfair
treatment of this man by rumor and innuendo, over and over again
rumors surfacing with no facts to back them up,'' the president said.
   The president said he was convinced that Tower ``is not only
capable of doing this job, but will do it in an outstanding way.''
   Even some of Tower's closest aides have conceded the former
senator drank too much in the 1970s, but insist that is no longer
true. Asked about that and whether the Texan had undergone
treatment, Bush said: ``I say there is no evidence of any kind of
the disease, alcoholism. None. None whatsoever.''
   Within hours of Bush's public embrace of Tower, Republicans began
echoing their president.
   ``We ought to have a unanimous vote'' for Tower, said Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., said he had a reaction of ``deep
personal anger ... that the system which permitted so many
unsubstantiated charges.''
   Wallop, an Armed Services Committee member, said the report
contained ``lots of opinion but no place in there where there is
corroboration, documentation or any kind of substantiation.''
   One dissenting Republican voice belonged to Rep. Mickey Edwards
of Oklahoma.
   Edwards said Tower has lost the credibility he needs to lead the
Pentagon because he has accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in
consulting fees from defense contractors since leaving the Senate in
1985. ``I don't think that has anything to do with who he's sleeping
with or whether he has one glass of wine before he goes to bed or
two,'' Edwards said.
   With most of the attention focused on the Senate committee, a
House subcommittee called a closed-door session for today to hear
from Berne Indahl, a State Department security officer. Sources say
Indahl has told investigators previously that he learned of
allegations of womanizing against Tower when he conducted a security
investigation in 1986 of the U.S. delegation to arms control talks
in Geneva. Tower was chairman of the delegation at the time.
   Despite the report, Nunn has said previously the Armed Services
Committee checked out reports of Tower's actions in Geneva and was
satisfied there had been no security breaches.

<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State officials have found
potentially dangerous levels of mercury in largemouth bass from the
Everglades but are waiting for additional test results before
issuing health warnings.
   The discovery comes at the height of the season in the Everglades
and on nearby Lake Okeechobee, one of the top bass-fishing spots in
the nation.
   Concentrations of the heavy metal were more than double federal
safety guidelines, the Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services said this week.
   The samples were taken in November; a second set of samples was
requested earlier this month.
   ``Personally, I don't think I'd eat any of those fish until the
results come in and HRS says it's safe,'' said Frank Morello, a
state fisheries supervisor.
   Mercury can cause birth defects and affect the nervous system,
causing poor coordination, numbness, deafness and impairment of the
sense of taste and smell, although experts say it takes long-term
exposure to high levels to cause problems.
   Additional test results will not be available for two to three
weeks, said Dr. Thomas Atkeson, HRS program manager for
environmental epidemiology.
   ``A period of two or three weeks is not going to make a
difference in anybody's life. I'd like to see a more robust data set
... before making a decision,'' he said.
   Officials said they don't know the source of the mercury but plan
to look at past use of now-banned pesticides by sugar growers,
illegal dumping of electronic components and air pollution.
   HRS, the state Department of Environmental Regulation and the
Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission have formed a mercury
contamination task force.
   The game commission also found high levels of mercury in four
alligators that had been killed last week for examination. The
reptiles were taken from the same Everglades canals where the
tainted fish were caught.
   The first sample of nine Everglades bass showed mercury levels
ranging from 1.2 to 3.4 parts per million. A second set of 15 fish
from the same areas ranged from 1.5 to 2.75 parts per million. The
alligators tested had concentrations from 1 part per million to 2.37.
   The federally established level for concern is 1 part per million.
   If future tests show the levels to be between 0.5 and 1.5 parts
per million, a warning will be issued against eating the fish more
than once a week, said HRS spokesman Steve Konicki.

   Opposition legislators on Wednesday
rejected the $470 million compensation that Union Carbide Corp.
agreed to pay victims of the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster, and they
promised to force the government to fight for more money.
   Survivors of the world's worst industrial disaster marched in
their own protest Wednesday as yet another petition was filed, this
one from a social service group seeking $600 million in damages for
death and injury caused by the lethal cloud of gas that seeped out
of a storage tank at Bhopal pesticide plant.
   The $470 million was part of a settlement reached Feb. 14 between
the U.S.-based multinational and the Indian government, which
originally demanded $3 billion.
   ``Is human life so cheap in this country we must accept such a
low amount?'' said Communist Party legislator Saifuddin Chowdhury.
   ``Our consciences are not dead, and neither are those of the
victims who are suffering but have come here to show they will not
be humiliated,'' he said in a special parliamentary debate.
   About 2,500 gas victims came to New Delhi from Bhopal to protest
the settlement Wednesday at the Boat Club, a grassy expanse half a
mile from Parliament building. They were supported by 500 Delhi
University students.
   Police prevented them from marching to Parliament.
   In Bhopal, 1,000 victims marched outside the residence of Chief
Minister Motilal Vorha of Madhya Pradesh state.
   More than 3,400 people were killed in the disaster, and 20,000
more are listed as seriously affected by the leak of methyl
isocyanate. Deaths attributed to it continue at the rate of at least
one a day.
   More than 500,000 damage claims have been filed. The latest was
filed Wednesday by the Association for Socio-Legal Literacy, a
social service group which sought a direction from the Supreme Court
ordering Union Carbide to pay $600 million because the Feb. 14 order
rendered the gas victims ``remediless.''
   Unde the agreement, the single payment absolves Union Carbide
from any other claims in the disaster. India's Supreme Court long
ago dismissed criminal charges brought against the Danbury,
Conn.-based multinational.
   Wednesday's parliamentary debate was inconclusive.
   Madhu Dandavate of the opposition Janata Party said Parliament
was the only forum that could reverse the Supreme Court order.
   ``We in this House must try to compensate them (victims) for the
tremendous suffering,'' Dandavate said. ``The settlement is a total
surrender to Union Carbide.''
   If it came to a vote, legislators of the governing Congress Party
vastly outnumber the opposition and have supported the government's
argument that a settlement had to be reached quickly to help victims
who already have suffered for four years.
   Congress Party legislators denied charges during debate that the
government colluded with Union Carbide, but some agreed the figure
of $470 million was low.
   K.N. Pradhan, a legislator from Bhopal who was personally
affected by the leak, said, ``I agree the compensation is very low,
but at least it is money in hand. What good would $3 billion have
done after 20 years when the cases were finally settled and all the
victims dead?''

   U.S. Ambassador Theodore Gildred,
a California businessman and philanthropist, will be replaced
following the May 14 national elections, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
   A spokeswoman at the U.S. Embassy said she had no comment on the
report in La Nacion, which cited sources in the Foreign Ministry.
   She added, however, that Gildred ``is not a career diplomat. He's
a businessman. He's been happy here, but he has other things to do.''
   Gildred, 53, is founder and chairman of the board of the San
Diego-based Torres Pines Bank, and the Lomas Sante Fe Co., which
develops and manages real estate.
   He presented his credentials to President Raul Alfonsin in
November 1986.
   President Bush will nominate as a replacement Terence Todman, a
former assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs and
ambassador to Chad, Costa Rica and Spain, La Nacion reported.
   Foreign Minister Dante Caputo was told of the impending change
this week while in Washington, La Nacion reported.

   Supreme Court justices sharply questioned
attorneys Wednesday who defended two holiday religious displays
which a federal appeals court has banned from Pennsylvania public
buildings.
   At issue in the case involving the line between church and state
are a nativity scene displayed inside the main entrance of the
Allegheny County Courthouse in Pittsburgh and a Hanukkah menorah at
another public building a block away.
   The Supreme Court's ruling in the case, expected by July, may
also provide guidance to dozens of communities uncertain about the
legality of using public resources for Christmas or Hanukkah
displays or events.
   The case presents Justice Anthony M. Kennedy with his first
opportunity to consider how high a wall the Constitution requires
between government and religion.
   Questions posed by the justices during arguments concerned how
local officials could be fair to everyone while displaying Christian
and Jewish symbols.
   County attorney Peter Buscemi argued that the religious symbols
were essentially passive, and that the case presented no government
coercion. He said the Constitution did not require the purging of
religious symbols by society.
   But Kennedy asked: ``Are all symbols passive? Would a cross be
passive?''
   Justice Antonin Scalia suggested that the county had put itself
in a difficult position by involving itself in religious symbols.
   ``What if you had an enormous menorah and a little, tiny creche
or an enormous creche and a little, tiny menorah?'' Scalia asked.
   Scalia also asked whether local officials, by their action, would
be bound to honor requests to include symbols of other religions in
the displays. That fairness theme was echoed by several other
justices.
   ``How large must the religious group be to be entitled to that
type of representation?'' asked Justice John Paul Stevens.
   ``It needn't be that large,'' replied Nathan Lewin, an attorney
for Chabad, a Jewish organization that donated the menorah to the
city.
   In its case, the county relies largely on a 1984 decision
allowing communities nationwide to include nativity scenes in
officially sponsored holiday displays.
   In that ruling, the high court let Pawtucket, R.I., officials
place a creche in a Christmas display because such decorations as
Santa Claus, reindeer and snowmen were also included.
   But lower courts have treated the 1984 decision as a narrow one,
and have disallowed various Christmas displays deemed too religious.
   American Civil Liberties Union attorney Roslyn Litman argued
Wednesday that to display the nativity scene and menorah, the local
governments had taken a religious stance.
   ``This is not accommodation, this is promotion. This is not
neutrality, this is favortism,'' she said.
   Later, in an interview, she said that ``I think they (the
justices) did seem concerned about the lack of neutrality being
shown.''
   The nativity scene is part of the Pennsylvania county's Christmas
carol program. Local officials say it is donated each year by a
Catholic men's organization, which permits it to be exhibited along
with a sign with its owner's name on it.
   The controversy began when the ACLU asked for the removal of the
nativity scene in 1986 by the county commissioners.
   They replied that the display endorsed no particular religion,
and simply expressed the wish of ``Good Will to All Men.''
   A later complaint filed by the ACLU sought to bar city officials
from displaying the menorah outside the City-County building, and
the two cases were eventually combined. The menorah was loaned by a
Jewish organization. It sat near a Christmas tree.
   By 2-1, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said local
officials, because of the Pittsburgh displays, ``have tacitly
endorsed Christianity and Judaism and have therefore acted to
advance religion.'' The decision meant the displays could not be
shown during the holiday season last year.

   President Bush today launched a hectic
five-day mission to the Far East, his first overseas trip as
president. The White House said the journey might not generate quick
headlines, but would demonstrate that ``the United States is an
Asian power.''
   Bush traded a pre-dawn Washington drizzle for a light snowfall
here, stopping to refuel en route to Japan. He will also make a
weekend visit to China and a 4{-hour stop in South Korea.
   Following the 7{-hour flight from Washington the president spoke
to several thousand airmen in blue, Army infantrymen in camouflage
uniforms and schoolchildren in parkas in a huge hangar at the
airbase. He recalled that one of his predecessors, President William
Harrison, spoke at his inauguration for 3{ hours, caught pneumonia
and was dead within a month. ``I will be brief,'' said Bush.
   The president was introduced to the friendly crowd by Rep. Don
Young, R-Alaska, who said he wanted to welcome ``Mr. President and
Mrs. President.''
   It is unusual for an American president to travel overseas just
33 days after his inauguration, but Bush decided to go to Tokyo to
represent the United States on Friday at the state funeral of
Emperor Hirohito, who died of cancer at the age of 87 on Jan. 7.
   In his speech here Bush noted that Elmendorf was the first stop
18 years ago in a trip that made Hirohito the first emperor in
Japanese history to set foot outside his homeland.
   Bush said he would pay his respects in Tokyo, and added, ``It is
as well a measure of our respect for a valued ally and fellow
democracy that I make this trip.''
   ``At each stop,'' Bush said, ``I aim to strengthen key
relationships with our friends and partners in the Pacific region.''
   Meanwhile, however, the White House released a statement by Bush
suggesting he was not interested in a U.S.-Japanese free trade
agreement modeled after a U.S.-Canadian pact to eliminate all trade
fees and import barriers.
   Bush said that Tokyo and Washington agree on the need for
mulilateral and bilateral efforts to create a more open
international trading system.
   `We will stress the multilateral approach,'' Bush said. ``We are
always open to new ideas, but in our view the key now is to work
hard for the succeess'' of international trade talks known as the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   His comment was made in a written response to questions submitted
by the Kyodo news service. Typically, the responses are written by
the National Security Council staff.
   Asked if he agreed with Defense Secretary-designate John Tower's
view that Japan should extend its sea land defense beyond the
present 1,000-mile limit, Bush said, ``We are fully satisfied with
the mutually agreed division of defense roles and missions in our
security arrangements ....''
   Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, on
Tuesday disputed suggestions that Bush is making the journey before
he has a cohesive foreign policy in place.
   ``The president is not trying to make quick headlines,''
Scowcroft said. He said Bush wants to develop policies that ``will
aid us in where we think we'd like to be at the end of the century.''
   Over the next five days, Bush will travel 18,095 miles. He'll
spend 36 hours on his plane before returning to Washington on Monday
night.
   Because of the 14-hour time difference with Washington, Bush will
arrive in Tokyo at about 1 p.m. local time on Thursday with much of
the work day ahead of him. However, his body clock will tell him
that it's 11 p.m. Wednesday at home.
   The trip gives Bush an opportunity to highlight the American
profile in Asia before a dramatic new chapter in Sino-Soviet
relations. In May, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will go to
Beijing for talks with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping _ the first such
summit in 30 years.
   Hirohito's funeral is expected to draw representatives of 154
countries, including 55 heads of state.
   Taking advantage of the gathering, Bush will hold more than a
dozen 15-to 30-minute meetings in Tokyo with kings, presidents and
prime ministers from around the world.
   Scowcroft said Bush will meet with the leaders of Egypt, Israel,
Jordan, Singapore, Pakistan, Thailand, West Germany, France,
Belgium, Turkey, Brazil and Nigeria. More meetings will be added.
   ``We're going to try to see as many as possible so the substance
will not be extensive,'' Scowcroft said. He said there will not be
any decision-making meetings.
   However, the national security adviser said it is important for
the leaders to have a ``face-to-face opportunity to get at least out
on the table a few issues for discussions.''
   After two nights in Tokyo, Bush will fly to Beijing, where he
spent 16 months beginning in the fall of 1974 as the U.S. diplomatic
envoy. Bush said recently that ``on a nostalgic basis, needless to
say, Barbara and I are looking forward in a very personal way to
going back to Beijing.''
   In Beijing, Bush will confer with China's four top leaders,
including Deng, President Yang Shangkun, Communist Party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang and Premier Li Peng.
   The president will spend two nights in Beijing and then fly to
Seoul for a stop of less than five hours. Scowcroft said Bush will
underscore ``the partnership of our two countries, the solid
security relationship and our appreciation for the flowering of
democracy by our old ally.''
   Even so, with anti-Americanism on the rise in South Korea, there
is a good chance of demonstrations in Seoul during Bush's brief stay.

<HEAD>AFL-CIO Report: Workers Face Hazards at Mexican Plants Near U.S.
Border</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Workers at Mexican factories just across
the U.S. border are routinely exposed to toxins because of vague and
little-enforced safety and environmental laws, labor leaders were
told Wednesday.
   A report to the AFL-CIO Executive Council blamed both the U.S.
and Mexican governments for the problems, saying Mexico has been
tardy in regulating workplace safety while the United States has
ignored the abuses because the area is attractive to American
corporations looking for cheap labor and scant government regulation.
   ``Both countries must undertake a massive effort to address this
alarming situation,'' said the report, which prompted a council
resolution condemning the situation and demanding action from both
governments.
   The study looked at the nearly 800 ``maquiladoras'' employing
approximately 300,000 Mexicans in the Rio Grande. The term, Spanish
for ``golden twins,'' refers to plants operated by foreign
corporations, most of them American.
   The report said that many workers are exposed to toxic chemicals
such as PCBs and that many locals drink contaminated water from
storage drums that once held hazardous materials.
   Communities that get their drinking water from the area have
unusually high cancer rates, and much of the waste that by law
should be returned to the United States for dumping instead is
disposed of in Mexico, the report said.
   Environmental problems associated with illegal and improper
dumping of toxins have spilled over into bordering communites in
Texas and California, the report said, citing California's polluted
New River as a prime example.
   ``But American companies don't seem deterred,'' it said. ``They
see increasing opportunity to capitalize on cheap labor and to
escape stringent health, safety and environmental regulations in
this country by shifting operations to Mexico.''
   The problems are complicated because the operations based in the
region are those that typically produce dangerous waste, such as the
chemical and electronics industry, said the report by Leslie Kochan,
an Oregon Department of Environmental Quality official who formerly
worked on environmental issues for the Texas Center for Policy Study.
   In addition, the factories are also rife with abuses of workers,
including wages of as little as $2.90 a day and working conditions
``that resemble the sweatshops of the late 19th and early 20th
century,'' the report said.
   Workers often are denied information about the hazardous
substances they handle and work without protective clothing and
equipment, the report said.

<HEAD>Court Rules State Cannot Be Sued For Failing To Protect Abused Child</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, ruling against a child who
suffered brain damage from repeated beatings by his father, said
Wednesday states generally may not be sued even if they negligently
fail to shield people from abuse by others.
   The 6-3 decision said public officials have no constitutional
duty to protect those who are not in state custody. The court said
there is no legal recourse even in the ``undeniably tragic'' case
where officials were aware of the beatings but did not intervene.
   The court killed a lawsuit in behalf of Joshua DeShaney, a
Wisconsin boy who since age 4 has been profoundly retarded and is
expected to remain institutionalized for the rest of his life.
   Child welfare officials and the state were sued by Joshua's
mother, Melody DeShaney, on grounds the boy was deprived of liberty
without due process.
   But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court,
said, ``Nothing in the language of the due process clause itself
requires the state to protect the life, liberty and property of its
citizens against invasion by private actors.''
   ``Because ... the state had no constitutional duty to protect
Joshua against his father's violence, its failure to do so _ though
calamitous in hindsight _ simply does not constitute a violation of
the due process clause,'' he said.
   In an unusual emotional dissent, Justice Harry A. Blackmun
exclaimed, ``Poor Joshua! It is a sad commentary upon American life
and constitutional principles ... that this child, Joshua DeShaney,
now is assigned to live out the remainder of his life profoundly
retarded'' and without an opportunity to sue the state.
   Blackmun accused the court of ``sterile formalism'' for failing
to grant Joshua and his mother an opportunty to seek damages from
the state.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall also dissented.
   Brennan said, ``My disagreement with the court arises from its
failure to see that inaction can be every bit as abusive of power as
action, that oppression can result when a state undertakes a vital
duty and then ignores it.''
   Rehnquist rejected arguments that the state had a duty to protect
Joshua because it once had given him shelter and because social
workers suspected he was being abused.
   Only ``when the state takes a person into its custody and holds
him there against his will'' does the Constitution require officials
to take responsibility for the individual's safety and well-being,
Rehnquist said.
   ``While the state may have been aware of the dangers that Joshua
faced in the free world, it played no part in their creation nor did
it do anything to render him any more vulnerable to them,'' he said.
   ``The state does not become the permanent guarantor of an
individual's safety by having once offered him shelter,'' Rehnquist
added.
   He was joined by Justices Byron R. White, John Paul Stevens,
Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   The suit in Joshua's behalf was filed against the Winnebago
County, Wis., Department of Social Services and two of its employees.
   The boy first came to the attention of the welfare agency when he
was brought to a hospital in 1983 at age 4 with cuts and bruises.
   Joshua was returned to the custody of his father, Randy DeShaney
of Neenah, Wis., and a social worker, Ann Kemmeter, was assigned to
the case.
   The boy's mother had divorced DeShaney and was living in
Cheyenne, Wyo., at the time.
   Ms. Kemmeter visited the DeShaney home numerous times, including
on March 7, 1984, when she was told that several days earlier Joshua
had fainted in the bathroom for no apparent reason. According to
court records, she did not ask to see the boy after being told he
was asleep.
   The following day Joshua was treated at a hospital for head
injuries that destroyed half his brain.
   Ms. Kemmeter later said, ``I just knew the phone would ring some
day and Joshua would be dead.''
   The boy's father was convicted of child abuse and sentenced to
two to four years in prison. He was freed on parole after serving
less than two years.
   In another case, the high court said states may not prohibit
political party leaders from endorsing primary election candidates.
By a vote of 8-0, the court said such a California law impermissibly
infringes constitutionally protected freedom of speech.
   The court also struck down California laws limiting the terms of
office for party leaders and dictating the makeup of state party
central committees.
   The court also heard arguments in a Pittsburgh case over the
validity of religious displays in government buildings. A decision
is expected by July.

   Members of Congress testified today that a
federal commission's sweeping plan to close 86 military bases and
partly close five more fails to meet the cost-effective goals the
panel had set.
   The members also told the House Armed Services subcommittee on
military installations and facilities that they had difficulty
obtaining information on which the commission based its decisions.
   ``Our request for detailed documentation of their findings
resulted in their sending us a two-inch paper trail with much of the
pertinent information deleted,'' said Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., who
testified on the commission's recommendation to put his state's Fort
Dix on semi-active status.
   ``Unless the Department of Defense provides the New Jersey
delegation with the facts that back up their decision I will be
forced to conclude that the commission's report was based on shoddy
research and that their recommendations are an insult to Congress,''
Bradley said in a prepared statement.
   Under the commission's plan, the government would save $5.6
billion over 20 years with the closure of 86 bases, the partial
closure of five and the transfer of operations to 54 other bases.
   Former Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci approved the plan last
month. Congress has 45 days after March 1 to either block the plan
or allow it to go into effect.
   Joining Bradley was Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who said the
decision to reduce Fort Dix to semi-active status ``is pennywise and
pound foolish.''
   ``The government has invested $160 million to upgrade Fort Dix
since 1980, including $6.9 million this past year for range
modernization and a new maintenance shop,'' Lautenberg said in a
statement.
   All told, 22 members of Congress testified before the committee
about plans to close or reduce bases in their states or districts,
with many saying they had to file Freedom of Information requests to
obtain information on the base closing recommendations.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., chairwoman of the subcommittee,
said that after the hearings, ``members may still object to the
closing of certain bases, but they ought to be able to do so with a
complete understanding of why the commission recommended what it
did.''
   Rep. Ed Madigan, R-Ill., said the closing of Chanute Air Force
Base in eastern Illinois would have a ``devastating impact'' on the
rural area of the state.
   And he added: ``For national security reasons, I do not have any
faith in a report that recommends closure of the only base which
provides Minuteman missile maintenance training. I do not have faith
in a report that so falsely states that there would only be a
moderate economic impact.''
   Closing of the Chanute Air Force Base would result in a loss of
1,139 military jobs and 1,681 civilian jobs, and an estimated
savings of $68.7 million annually, according to the commission's
report.
   Rep. Terry Bruce, D-Ill., cited the construction of new
facilities at the base, including a weather training facility, cold
storage facility and a regional waste water treatment facility.
   ``All construction of these projects occured within the last six
years, with a price tag of over $66 million,'' Bruce said. ``This
construction would have to be duplicated at the receiving bases
should Chanute be closed.''
   Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said according to her estimates,
plans to close the Presidio in San Francisco ``will cost the
taxpayer $26 million more per year to maintain Presidio Park and the
6th Army at Fort Carson (in Colorado) and to provide health care to
military retirees in San Francisco, than it does now.''
   ``Closure hurts, rather than helps, our efforts to cut the
deficit,'' Boxer said.

<HEAD>Residents Cite Drawbacks to Big City Life</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds. CORRECTS spelling of Muscovites throughout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

   Big city life has certain drawbacks, whether
your home is New York City or Moscow, according to a recent joint
survey of residents of those and other metropolises.
   For instance, 33 percent of Muscovites and 38 percent of New
Yorkers said they were afraid to go out alone at night on the street
where they lived.
   In addition, 38 percent of the Moscow residents were unhappy with
their public transportation, as were 36 percent of those surveyed in
New York. Two-thirds of the Muscovites and 64 percent of the New
Yorkers gave their local schools a grade of C, D or F.
   Surveys of sentiments in Moscow, New York, Boston, Detroit and
San Francisco were sponsored by American news media from those
cities and conducted in Moscow with the help of the Soviet Institute
of Sociology. Results were reported in late January and early
February by the sponsoring news organizations.
   Soviet and American polling experts held a briefing here
Wednesday to shed light on such mysteries as why virtually none of
the Muscovites owned up to heavy drinking and why 17 percent never
heard of the Marxist leader of Nicaragua.
   About 1,000 people each were surveyed by telephone in December in
Moscow and New York, and 600 in each of the other U.S. cities. The
surveys had a three-point margin of error for the Moscow and New
York results, and four points for the other cities.
   Several American reporters, veterans of Moscow assignments who
recalled lines outside state-run liquor stores, questioned the
credibility of any survey that depicted Muscovites as abstemious.
   When asked how often they drank alcohol, not even 1 percent of
the Moscow residents said they drank ``almost every day,'' 5 percent
responded once or twice a week; 17 percent said once or twice a
month; 41 percent said several times a year, and 36 percent said
never.
   By contrast, 12 percent of the San Franciscans, 9 percent of
Bostonians, 6 percent of New Yorkers and 5 percent of Detroiters
owned up to drinking almost daily.
   ``Nobody accepted the `not drinking' (figures from Moscow) on
face value,'' said John Marttila of the Boston polling firm of
Marttila &amp; Kiley, Inc., which undertook the surveys with Market
Opinion Research.
   Elena Bashkirova of the Institute of Sociology in Moscow said the
Soviet anti-alcoholism drive may be working. She also suggested that
Soviets may drink on fewer occasions than Americans, but more
heavily.
   The surveys found that 67 to 79 percent of the U.S. citizens said
they were ``very proud'' to be Americans, and 18 to 22 percent of
the rest were ``quite proud'' of their country. In Moscow, 39
percent said they were very proud to be a Soviet citizen and 38
percent were quite proud.
   Sixty-nine percent of the Muscovites said they never went out to
dinner at a restaurant; only 4 to 7 percent of the Americans said
they never dined out. A third to a half of the Americans said they
dined out once or twice a week, compared with 2 percent of the
Muscovites.
   Twenty-three percent of the Muscovites never heard of Iran's
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini; 25 percent never heard of Pope John
Paul II; 38 percent knew nothing of Libya's Moammar Gadhafi and 17
percent were in the dark about Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega.
   That ``surprised us most of all, with the level of attention to
Daniel Ortega, who is every day on (Soviet) television news or mass
media,'' said Bashkirova's colleague Valeriy Korobeinikov. It shows
people set their own priorities when listening to world news, he
said.
   The surveys were funded by the New York Daily News; WCBS-TV and
WCBS radio in New York; WCVB-TV in Boston; the Detroit Free Press,
and KRON-TV in San Francisco.

<HEAD>University of Michigan Law School's Decision Decried by FBI</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with details from Bollinger, additional information
from FBI on Ohio State, numbers of law-trained agents hired; No pickup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation on
Wednesday decried the University of Michigan law school's decision
to ban FBI recruiters for a year because a judge found that the
agency had discriminated against Hispanic agents.
   ``We feel very frustrated in this process,'' said Milt Ahlerich,
assistant FBI director for congressional and public affairs. ``How
are we to strengthen, ... how are we to get top quality FBI agents
on board if we are not allowed to come on to top quality campuses?''
   Lee Bollinger, dean of the University of Michigan law school,
said Wednesday that he imposed the ban in December _ which will last
through the end of the school year in May _ after several students
noted that the FBI was being sued in Texas by Hispanic agents over
discrimination.
   ``The students said it was in violation of our placement
anti-discrimination policy'' for such an organization to be allowed
to recruit at the school, Bollinger said.
   He said he wrote to FBI Director William Sessions about it in
September, and almost as soon as he sent the letter, the judge in
Texas ruled in favor of the Hispanic agents.
   ``This was systemic discrimination,'' not just a single
situation, Bollinger said.
   Sessions wrote him back, saying the FBI does not discriminate and
asking that the agency be allowed to come to the law school to
recruit, Bollinger said. In December, Bollinger wrote Sessions
again, saying that ``for this academic year, we would not allow our
facilities to be used'' by the FBI.
   ``He has still not responded to the Dec. 19 letter,'' the dean
said.
   Francis X. Beytagh, the dean of the Ohio State University law
school, told The Washington Post for a story in Wednesday's editions
that that school imposed a ban on FBI personnel recruiting on campus
but allowed it to continue distributing employment information.
   However, Ahlerich said the situation at that law school had not
changed.
   ``We were not on campus doing recruiting meetings'' before, he
said, adding that the FBI has regular contact with the placement
office there and meets with those seeking jobs at an off-campus
office.
   When the Ohio law school expressed concerns, ``We wrote them a
letter that explained to them our policy,'' he said. ``The
recruiting practices there have not changed at all.''
   What triggered the University of Michigan law school limitations
on FBI recruitment was a successful discrimination lawsuit filed by
FBI agent Bernardo Matias Perez on behalf of 311 Hispanic agents.
U.S. District Judge Lucius D. Bunton, who found last September that
the FBI had discriminated against the Hispanic agents, is holding a
hearing to determine how much the FBI should pay them as
compensation for denial of promotions and assignments to unrewarding
and hazardous duties. The agents are seeking $9.2 million.
   Ahlerich noted that several University of Michigan campuses,
including the Ann Arbor campus where the law school is located,
allow on-campus recruiting by the FBI, but he urged the law school
officials to ``revisit their decision.''
   ``Law schools are important to the FBI. Out of 9,500 on-board
special agents, approximately 1,300 are law-trained,'' he said.
   ``We believe that agent applicants that have law training are
particularly well-suited to the special agent position,'' he said.
``If the bureau is to be sensitive and particularly able to handle
challenges of sophisticated crime problems that we have in this
country today, including handling of civil rights investigations, we
need very capable, sensitive applicants, and lawyers fill that role
in many instances.''
   Over the past three years, the FBI has hired about 1,855 special
agents, of whom about 320, or 17 percent, are trained in law,
according to figures provided by Ahlerich.
   He said he knows of only one agent who was graduated from the
University of Michigan law school.

<HEAD>Mediator Meets with Airline, Union Representatives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal mediator began meeting Wednesday with
representatives of Eastern Airlines and the Machinists union in an
effort to reach a settlement before a 30-day cooling-off period
expires, the director of the National Mediation Board said.
   Charles Barnes, executive director of the board, said the board
requested the meetings ``to make, in effect, a last attempt to
resolve differences before termination of the 30-day cooling-off
period.''
   The airline rejected the board's offer of binding arbitration to
end the 16-month dispute. That rejection triggered the 30-day
period, after which the union will be free to strike and the airline
free to impose its disputed terms on workers.
   The cooling-off period ends at midnight March 3.
   Mediator Harry D. Bickford was meeting with the two sides, Barnes
said. The meetings are expected to continue.
   Eastern, which estimates it is losing $1 million a day, is
seeking $150 million in wage concessions from the airline's 8,500
Machinists union members.

<TEXT>
   White House budget director Richard Darman,
attacked by Democrats for playing games when the deficit must be
cut, refused Wednesday to reveal President Bush's policies on a wide
swath of domestic programs.
   Darman repeatedly declined to say what spending levels Bush
wanted next year for programs such as care for poor pregnant women,
veterans' education, mass transit, or even the Job Training
Partnership Act _ the bill Bush cited in choosing Dan Quayle for his
vice presidential running mate.
   ``President Bush's position is that he wants to negotiate the
answer to that, and you don't like that apparently,'' he told Rep.
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., during one particularly testy exchange
during his testimony before the House Budget Committee.
   Boxer, demanding specifics, said that while some of the
initiatives in the $1.16 trillion budget Bush presented on Feb. 9
sounded good, ``we haven't really seen the bad parts.''
   Bush placed $136 billion in programs, mostly domestic agencies,
together in a ``flexible freeze'' with no increase to cover rising
costs, and without endorsing increases or cuts on any particular
program so long as the total remained the same.
   Boxer complained that Bush's fiscal 1990 budget appeared to
``reward the military establishment with full inflation while you
kill'' domestic programs.
   Darman responded that Boxer was applying a ``double standard'' _
judging military programs as increased when they go up with
inflation but calling domestic programs cut when they don't keep
that pace.
   The president's budget has it the other way around. Military
programs were deemed ``frozen'' when they were boosted to cover
inflationary costs. Domestic programs were frozen when they had no
increase at all.
   Darman denied that the hundreds of programs in the
administration's ``flexible freeze'' category were ones that Bush
doesn't care about. ``We just don't care as intensely,'' he said.
   Budget committee chairman Leon Panetta criticized Darman for
outlining options but not Bush choices in the hundreds of pages of
documents he was presenting to Congress.
   ``There have been too many games played with the deficit issue in
the past,'' Panetta said. ``My concern is when you strip the
rhetoric aside ... some of the same games are being played.''
   He cited optimistic economic forecasts, and the assumption that
Congress was going to approve new government fees and sell-offs of
government assets that it has rejected in the past.
   Darman repeated his request that Congress join in negotiations
with the administration. ``Why wait. Why don't we start right
away,'' he said.
   But Panetta said, ``What you have presented may not help
negotiations. It may hurt negotiations.''
   Congress has a deadline of April 15 to produce a final budget.

   Seventy-five sick and disabled Iraqi
prisoners of war arrived home Wednesday, leaving behind six comrades
who requested political asylum in Iran, officials said.
   The 75 are among 260 Iraqi POWs that Iran said it would free to
mark the 10 anniversary of its Islamic revolution earlier this
month. Twenty-five of the 260 have asked to stay behind, according
to reports by the official Islamic Republic News Agency monitored in
Cyprus.
   The first group of 80 prisoners arrived home Tuesday, and another
80 will be repatriated Thursday, said IRNA.
   An official of the International Committee of the Red Cross in
Baghdad confirmed that Iranian authorities told the organization
Wednesday that six POWs asked for asylum.
   He said the all-Swiss committee gave medical examinations to all
the prisoners and chartered the plane that carried them home. He
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The plane will fly back to Tehran to transport the last batch of
prisoners on the 2{-hour ride Thursday.
   A United Nations-sponsored cease-fire halted the gulf war Aug.
20. But peace negotiations have stalled and a previous agreement to
exchange prisoners of war in November collapsed over mutual
recriminations of bad faith, including the numbers requesting asylum
on both sides.
   Iraq released 255 Iranians last month.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross has registered
50,182 prisoners held by Iran and 19,284 Iranians in Iraqi hands.
But United Nations and other officials estimate the number of
prisoners at 100,000.

<HEAD>American War Veteran Favors U.S. Assistance to Vietnam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American Vietnam War veteran who
recently accompanied a group of U.S. high school students to Vietnam
says the United States owes the Vietnamese development assistance.
   ``Our knowledge of history heavily tainted with hindsight enables
veterans like myself as well as civilians to realize that we made
some very big mistakes as a country,' said Tim Porta, 44, owner of a
resort hotel in Maine.
   ``We owe it now to the Vietnamese people to establish this
infrastructure that will enable them to go it alone. It has to be
done ... and really come from the heart and without strings
attached,'' Porta said in an interview Tuesday. He suggested the
United States could help pay for badly needed roads.
   Porta traveled to Vietnam with his 18-year-old son, Michael, one
of 17 students on a two-week educational tour that began Feb. 2. In
Vietnam, the students toured schools and discussed U.S.-Vietnamese
relations.
   ``The Vietnamese have the intellect, the desire, tremendous drive
and 10 years of exposure to a race of people that were light years
ahead of them and then all of a sudden it went out like a light in
1975 and then they were left with nothing,'' the elder Porta said.
   Trip organizer Stephen Knight, a history teacher from Fairfield,
Maine, said American textbooks on Vietnam were inadequate and that
traveling was the best way to learn.
   ``As a teacher, I would hope that they get a better understanding
of the problems of the world, how poor people are, how hard they
have to work for a living,'' said Knight, adding that the students
kept journals during their stay in Vietnam.
   The students have been studying about Vietnam for a year in a
specially accredited history class taught by Knight. The students,
averaging about 17 in age, came from Lawrence High School,
Messalonskee High School, Skowhegan High School, Waterville High
School and Waynflete High School, all in the Portland, Maine, area.
   Despite common complaints about rough toilet paper, dirty
bathrooms and unclean drinking water, the students described their
trip as ``valuable experience.''
   ``I just wanted to see how the people live,'' said Michael Porta.
``Even though they don't have a whole lot in their lives, a whole
lot that's positive or to look forward to, it seems like the people
are content, happy with what little they do have, whereas in America
everyone wants more.''
   Sixteen-year-old Heidi Holmes said: ``Americans have a mirrored
view from what veterans have told them. Things are more vivid if you
see them and learn them for yourself.''
   College student Kevin Cloutier, 21, who joined the tour, said
Americans should bury the past.
   ``I think the Americans feel they have to dwell on the war, dwell
on the people who were in the war and our policies even though the
war is over,'' he said.
   ``We still have to try to analyze what we did over there while
the Vietnamese want to forget that and let bygones by bygones and
continue the future as friends, not enemies,'' Cloutier added.
   The Americans left Bangkok on Wednesday for home.

<HEAD>Analysis Of Savannah River Tritium Reactors At Least A Year From
Completion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department cannot complete a major
analysis of its three idled tritium production reactors at Savannah
River, S.C. before the first one is ready to be restarted, a
department adviser told Congress on Wednesday.
   It's ``probably going to take a lot longer than a year'' to prove
that the reactors can safely withstand the most serious plausible
accident they are expected to face, John Ahearne told the energy and
power subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Ahearne, a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is
chairman of the department's Advisory Committee on Nuclear
Facilities Safeguards.
   Department officials have testified in other hearings that they
hoped to restart one of the reactors by the end of 1989. This
restart date has been getting later and later _ at one point last
fall, the department was saying it hoped to restart one reactor by
the end of 1988.
   When all the other work is complete, the secretary of energy will
have to decide whether to permit the restart, weighing the need for
tritium against the incompleteness of the analysis.
   Tritium is an essential ingredient in many of the nation's
nuclear weapons. It must be replenished every few years because 5.5
percent of any starting amount decays in the course of a year. Just
when the power of the weapons would decay to an unacceptable point
is a secret, but the Boston Globe recently reported that Pentagon
officials had said an 18-month or two-year pause in tritium
production might be tolerable.
   The department ordered the Savannah River reactors closed last
year for safety and management upgrading after the operator, Du Pont
Co., brought the only active one into full operation at half power
despite an unexplained power surge during startup.
   The most serious plausible accident is what the civilian nuclear
power industry calls the ``design basis'' accident, that is, the
worst accident the plant designers have taken into account.
   Such a hypothetical accident would vary according to the plant
design and site _ for instance, in one place it might be a tornado,
in another it might be an earthquake.
   The Savannah River reactors are supposed to be able to shut down
safely on emergency cooling even if they suffer a ``double
guillotine break'' of a main cooling system pipe, a complete break
in two places that removes a section of pipe and cuts normal coolant
flow to zero.
   Until recently, Ahearne said, ``They have not had the analytical
capability'' in the department to prove by calculation that the
reactors would be safe in such a case.
   In 1986, the department cut reactor operations to 75 percent of
full power because of uncertainty that such a break could be
handled. After a National Research Council report calling attention
to the uncertainties the following year, power was limited to 50
percent.
   ``My conclusion is I don't think they are going to have (the
analysis) done when they'r ready to restart and that's where the
subjective judgment (of the secretary) comes in,'' Ahearne said in
an interview after the hearing.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission sometimes has permitted
civilian power plants to start operation before the analysis of the
design basis accident has been completed if it judged the
probability of such a accident sufficiently low, Ahearne said.
   ``It's not that unusual in the commercial world,'' he said.
   Such an analysis is enormously complicated mathematically and
sometimes cannot be completed until computer models are checked
against experiments in actual scale models of sections of the
reactor piping.
   Chris Sankey, spokeswoman for the Energy Department, said
department officials wanted to give James Watkins, nominated to be
energy secretary, a chance after his expected confirmation to get up
to speed on all restart issues before it addresses comments like
Ahearne's.

   President Bush announced Wednesday that
he will nominate Robert R. Glauber as undersecretary of the
treasury, succeeding George D. Gould.
   Glauber, 49, is a consultant to the Treasury Department and
previously was chairman of the advanced management program at the
Harvard Business School.
   The White House announced the appointment during Bush's refueling
stop in Alaska enroute to his five-day, three-nation trip to Asia.
   The president also announced the nominations of three candidates
for federal judgeship:
   _ Ferdinand F. Fernandez of California to be a member of the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in the 9th circuit succeeding Warren J.
Ferguson. Fernandez has been a U.S. district judge for the central
district of California since 1985 and previously had been a
California state judge. He is 51.
   _ Pamela Ann Rymer to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
9th circuit succeeding Anthony M. Kennedy, who was elevated to the
Supreme Court by former President Reagan. Rymer has been a U.S.
district judge for the central district of California since 1983.
She is 48.
   _ Melinda Harmon of Texas to be U.S. district judge for the
southern district of Texas succeeding John D. Singleton Jr. Harmon,
who had been Singleton's law clerk from 1973 to 1975, has been a
Harris County district court judge in Texas since 1988 and
previously worked for 13 years as a lawyer for Exxon Co., USA. She
is 42.

   A health research group on Thursday called for
a halt to experiments with narcotic-laced lollipops given to
children to calm them before surgery, saying that giving drugs in
the form of candy sends a ``dangerous message.''
   But doctors defended their experiments with the sedative and
discounted the potential for increased drug abuse. They said their
studies have found that delivering the narcotic fentanyl in a
lollipop instead of with a needle is less stressful and traumatic
for children about to undergo general anesthesia.
   ``In this setting, a one-time occurence, I don't believe that
we're going to be putting the subliminal message into children's
heads that candy equals drugs,'' said Dr. Lawrence Feld, a pediatric
anesthesiologist at California's Stanford University Medical Center,
who headed one of the studies.
   ``It's something that we always have to consider with any kind of
drug,'' he said in an interview Thursday. ``We looked at the risk
and the benefits and consider it (drug abuse potential) to be a
nonissue.''
   Public Citizen Health Research Group, in a letter to the Food and
Drug Administration, said offering the sedative in lollipop form
sends children ``a dangerous message'' about drugs being candy and
is of ``dubious clinical need or safety.''
   Sidney M. Wolfe, director of the health research group, said,
``Giving lollipops laced with a powerful narcotic to children who,
in the words of one research group, `visibly enjoyed the
premedication experience,' as one might expect children sucking
lollipops to do, is a major step in the wrong direction.''
   Fentanyl has been approved by the FDA as an injectable drug. In
the studies, it is mixed into a hard candy, mounted on a stick and
given to children to suck on before they undergo general anesthesia
or a painful diagnostic procedure.
   The FDA has not approved the oral form of the drug except for use
in the controlled experiments. Anesta Corp. of Salt Lake City,
formed by anesthesiologists and the University of Utah to test and
develop the oral form, said the studies began 3{ years ago and will
continue for a year or two more before the company seeks approval to
market oral fentanyl commercially.
   Wolfe said approving oral use of the drug, which is far stronger
than morphine and, he said, is a favorite drug of abuse among
anesthesiologists and ``street'' users, would likely increase drug
abuse.
   Jeffrey Blumer, a pediatric pharmacologist at Case Western
Reserve University School of Medicine in Ohio who also signed the
letter to the FDA seeking a halt in the studies, said the narcotic
could be administered by means other than injection or lollipop,
such as rectally or through the nose.
   In lollipop form, he said, ``we're giving drugs in a formulation
that make them attractive to children.''
   But William Moeller, president of Anesta, said the oral form of
the drug has advantages over sedatives delivered by needle. It
reduces stress in children who are about to undergo anesthesia _
instead of fearing an injection, the child simply sucks on the
lollipop and dozes off and a calm patient is delivered for
anesthesia. Also, the drug's analgesic properties reduce trauma in
the patient by reducing the heart rate and blood pressure during the
surgical or diagnostic procedure, he said.
   ``It's another way, a better way of being able to premedicate and
induce anesthesia in children,'' said Dr. Theodore Stanley, an
anesthesiology professor at the University of Utah School of
Medicine and originator of the oral form of fentanyl. ``It's less
stressful and makes anesthesia safer.''
   The FDA discounted concerns about fentanyl lollipops increasing
drug abuse. FDA spokesman Bill Grigg said:
   ``We just don't see any reason to think in doctors' hands this
would lead to any abuse. ... But all those issues would be explored
before a product was approved.''
   More than 400 people, mostly children, have been part of the
study. Experiments have been completed at the University of Utah
Medical Center, the University of Texas Medical Center in Houston
and Stanford University Medical Center, and other studies are in
progress at other medical centers Moeller declined to identify.

<HEAD>Union Leader Says Namibians Wary of South African Intentions</HEAD>

   A Namibian union leader said
Wednesday his compatriots remain deeply suspicious of South African
intentions in the mineral rich territory, despite an independence
plan set to begin April 1.
   ``Namibians can smell their independence in the air,'' said Ben
Ulenga, general secretary of the powerful Mineworkers Union of
Namibia.
   But he added, ``given the past treachery of the (South African)
apartheid regime, Namibians are very cautious and vigilant.''
   South Africa, which has ruled Namibia for 74 years, is to begin
implementing a United Nations independence plan April 1 leading to
elections early in November.
   Officials of the South-West African People's Organization, the
guerrilla movement that has waged a 22-year war for independence,
says the South African government is actively working against an
election victory for them and will attempt to destabilize the
territory.
   ``Namibia's future is tied up with events in South Africa,'' said
Ulenga, a SWAPO member. ``If the apartheid regime is in power
indefinitely there will be very little chance for peace and
stability in Namibia.''
   Ulenga, who spent nine years in a South African prison for his
guerrilla activities, spoke at a meeting sponsored by Tribute
Magazine, a black-oriented monthly published in South Africa.
   SWAPO is favored to win the elections but has not detailed its
political and economic policies.
   SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma has said the organization favors a
socialist economy, but says he foresees a mixed economy initially
and does not intend to embark immediately on widespread
nationalization.
   The organization has not made clear whether a SWAPO government
would tolerate opposition parties, such as members of the current
transitional government.
   ``We can never forget about those who have been working in close
cooperation with the South Africans,'' said Ulenga. ``Reconciliation
does not mean condoning the crimes of apartheid, the crimes of
collaboration with apartheid,'' he said of the system of legalized
race discrimination.
   Mwilima Kupuzo, a black Namibian serving in the
soon-to-be-disbanded interim Parliament, said a SWAPO government
will seek to create ``a one-party state dedicated to socialism.''
   Kupuzo, in the audience while Ulenga spoke, accused SWAPO of
intimidating people into supporting the group.
   He represents the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, a multiracial
coalition that favors a multiparty democracy and free enterprise.
The alliance holds the largest number of seats in the transitional
government, which was established by South Africa in 1985 as an
interim step to independence. SWAPO was banned so it could not
contest elections.

<HEAD>Former Sheriff Files Lawsuit Over `Mississippi Burning' Movie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON HARRIST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Mississippi sheriff on Wednesday
said he sued the makers of the movie ``Mississippi Burning'' for $8
million because ``they have done me terrible harm and they ought to
face up to it.''
   ``Everybody all over the South knows the one they have playing
the sheriff in that movie is referring to me,'' said Lawrence
Rainey, 65, who on Tuesday filed a libel suit against Orion Pictures
in federal court in Meridian.
   The critically acclaimed movie, which has received seven Academy
Award nominations, is based on the 1964 slayings of three civil
rights workers in Neshoba County. Rainey was sheriff at the time.
   Bill Bernstein, a spokesman for Orion in New York, said the movie
maker had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on it.
   Rainey, who now works for a black-owned security firm in
Meridian, said the character of the sheriff in the film made it
appear he failed to carry out his responsibilities and was ``a
terrible person.''
   The deaths of Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman
prompted an FBI investigation that led to conspiracy charges against
18 men, including Rainey, who was acquitted.
   In the film, the character Sheriff Stucky is a backwoods lawman
who disliked blacks. Stucky is depicted as someone who did not
participate in the actual killings but helped protect those
responsible by not investigating.
   The charges against Rainey followed much the same line, with
officials alleging the sheriff and others conspired to violate the
civil rights of the victims.
   ``What they said happened and what they did to me certainly
wasn't right and something ought to be done about it,'' Rainey said.
   He has said he was innocent of any coverup, carried out his
responsibilities and was not a racist. He said he would have never
made the remarks attributed to the sheriff in the film.
   His attorney, James G. McIntyre, who defended Rainey in the 1967
conspiracy trial, said he received no response from Orion to his
demand several weeks ago that it correct what he described as
untruths in the film.
   The movie, directed by Alan Parker and starring Gene Hackman and
Willem Dafoe, has been criticized by some civil rights activists who
say it maligns blacks and inaccurately portrays the FBI agents as
heroes.

   Anti-apartheid groups said
Wednesday police officials are exploiting the criminal investigation
of Winnie Mandela's bodyguards to create divisions in the black
community.
   Activists said police even offered to pay for the funeral of
14-year-old Stompie Seipei, who allegedly was beaten at Mrs.
Mandela's home in December.
   Seipei's decomposed body was found in January, and two of Mrs.
Mandela's bodyguards were charged with the killing Monday.
   ``Police are trying to divide the (black) community and blame
Stompie's death on frictions in black groups,'' said Lister Skosana
of the Tumahole Civic Association, an anti-government community
group from Seipei's hometown in central South Africa.
   The teen-ager's death is at the center of a growing scandal
surrounding the wife of jailed African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela and a group of unofficial bodyguards calling
themselves the Mandela United soccer club. They lived at her home in
Soweto, the sprawling black township outside Johannesburg.
   One team member, Jabu Sithole, and self-described team coach
Jerry Richardson, have been charged with the killing of Seipei and
abductions and beatings of three other men.
   Anti-apartheid leaders last week accused Mandela United of waging
a ``reign of terror,'' renounced Mrs. Mandela, and urged their
followers not to associate with her. They accused her of
``complicity'' in the abductions and beatings.
   Joyce Seipei, the dead boy's mother, said at a news conference
that police offered to pay for his funeral but she declined to
accept.
   Police spokesman Col. Steve van Rooyen denied police offered to
pay.
   Police usually place tight restrictions on funerals of political
activists, limiting the number of mourners to 200 and the ceremony
to three hours.
   Skosana said police promised Mrs. Seipei there will be no
restrictions on her son's funeral Saturday. Van Rooyen said he was
unaware of any restrictions.
   Police usually are reluctant to comment on investigations and
court cases, but they repeatedly have volunteered information in the
events surrounding Mrs. Mandela.
   When they raided her house Sunday, they were accompanied by a
crew from the state television network. The video film showed Mrs.
Mandela in a nightgown and Richardson pulling on a pair of pants
after being awakened and arrested.
   Mrs. Seipei refused to comment about Mrs. Mandela, saying through
an interpreter, ``I have not met her and I don't want to meet her.''
   The African National Congress said it believes Mandela United was
``infiltrated by the enemy,'' a reference to the South African
government.
   The exiled guerrilla movement, based in Zambia, said it
previously had urged Mrs. Mandela to disband the group, but she had
refused.
   ``She was left open and vulnerable to committing mistakes which
the enemy exploited,'' the statement said.
   Police sometimes boast publicly about their ability to infiltrate
opposition groups. Van Rooyen declined to comment when asked if
informers were active in Mandela United.

<HEAD>State Department Regrets Lack of Progress in Informal Peace Talks</HEAD>

   The State Department said Wednesday it regrets
a lack of progress in informal peace talks on Cambodia and called on
Vietnam and authorities in Phnom Penh to make a ``major effort to
address seriously the remaining issues'' including formation of an
interim government.
   President Bush is expected to take up the Cambodia matter in his
talks this weekend with the Chinese in Beijing, said department
spokesman Charles E. Redman, who spoke as Bush began a trip to
Japan, China and South Korea.
   Redman, declining to offer details of Bush's planned discussions,
was asked to comment on the end of the latest round of informal
peace talks among factions seeking power in Cambodia.
   The talks deadlocked over formation of a provisional government
to rule in Phonm Pen until elections can be held, and little
progress was made on establishing a timetable for ending the
Vietnamese occupation.
   The Chinese supply military aid to the Khmer Rouge, the largest
faction in a three-party opposition coalition battling the
Vietnamese-supported government. The United States supplies
non-lethal aid the two non-communist factions in the coalition _
followers of former head of state Prince Sihanouk, and the Khmer
People's National Liberation Front of Son Sann.
   Through Hanoi, Moscow supports Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia.
   ``We regret that more progress was not made at the second Jakarta
informal meeting toward achieving an acceptable and comprehensive
settlement,'' Redman said of the peace talks, held in Indonesia.
   Redman called on Vietnam and the authorities in Phnom Penh ``to
make a major effort to address seriously the remaining issues,
particularly the formation of an interim government preceding
elections in Cambodia and the participation of an international
presence sufficiently strong to carry out its duties in support of a
settlement.''
   While Redman did not define what he meant by ``an international
presence,'' there have been calls for an international peacekeeping
force to oversee the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops.
   He said the United States supports a ``comprehensive agreement''
to ensure a lasting solution in Cambodia.
   He argued that Sihanouk's role was ``crucial as leader of an
interim government preceding elections and as the focus for national
unity.''
   Redman restated U.S. support for the ``verified and complete''
withdrawal of all Vietnamese forces, effective safeguards against a
Khmer Rouge return to power, and restoration of genuine
self-determination to the Cambodian people.
   He said the United States is involved in ``close, active, and
regular consultations'' regarding a Cambodian settlement with the
Soviet Union, China, the governments of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, and the non-communist opposition groups.
   ``We are prepared to support those practical and reasonable
measures which will help achieve the goal of a free, independent,
and peaceful Cambodia,'' Redman said.
   Cambodian guerrilla leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh, son of
Prince Sihanouk, has called for the United States to become more
involved in the negotiations to end the conflict in Cambodia.
   Ranariddh also has told reporters that he believes the impasse
over Cambodia may only be broken after the May summit in Beijing
between Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping.

<HEAD>Watkins Vows To Shake Up Nuclear Plant Management Within Six Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James D. Watkins, the designated energy
secretary, told Congress Wednesday he would assemble within six
months the nucleus of a new management team to shake up a nuclear
weapons complex ``desperately in need of change.''
   The retired admiral, in seeking to become the first career
military man to head the Energy Department since it was created in
1977, also vowed to tackle an array of conventional energy problems,
including growing dependence on foreign oil.
   Watkins won warm praise from nearly every member of the Senate
Energy and Natural Resources Committee during his three hours of
testimony. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., the committee chairman, set a
vote on the nomination for next Wednesday.
   Watkins, 61, spent four decades in the Navy, capping his career
with a four-year stint as chief of naval operations. In 1987 he led
a presidential AIDS commission to a series of widely praised
recommendations on what to do about the deadly disease.
   He was closely associated with the Navy's nuclear program but has
no experience in the conventional energy field, which he has called
his Achilles' heel.
   ``You come to us with a certain luster,'' said Sen. Howard M.
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, a strong critic of the Energy Department's
handling of the 17-site complex in 12 states that develops, produces
and tests the nation's nuclear weapons.
   The weapons plants, key parts of which were built in the 1940s
and 1950s to develop the world's first atomic bombs, have been
breaking down in recent months, exposing flaws in safety procedures,
technical standards and management. Widespread contamination of soil
and groundwater also has been discovered. Estimates for correcting
the problems range from $81 billion to $155 billion.
   ``Problems relating to safety, health and the environment have
not only been backlogged to intolerable levels but, in effect,
hidden from public view until recently,'' Watkins said.
   He called the Energy Department's management system ``antique,
out of date ... and desperately in need of change.'' He said he
would put together ``the fundamental embryo'' of a new management
team to impose major changes on the nuclear complex.
   The weapons plants are run for the Energy Department by private
contractors. Watkins said the department historically has put too
much emphasis on meeting nuclear production goals at the expense of
safety and the environment.
   ``I will organize a management team that understands how to
motivate people, how to achieve and reward excellence, and how to
reject and deal firmly and fairly and swiftly with incompetence,''
Watkins said.
   Under the existing department management, ``there is little risk
in being careless, little incentive to excel,'' he said, adding that
he would seek to instill a work attitude that would allow the
department to regain its public credibility.
   Watkins was not asked whether he supports the department's
existing blueprint for modernizing and cleaning up the nuclear
weapons complex. That report, issued shortly before President Reagan
left office last month, proposed a series of controversial actions
to revitalize the complex over the next 21 years. It put the cleanup
and modernization cost at $81 billion over that period.
   On other subjects, Watkins said he would:
   _Seek to limit the nation's reliance on foreign oil by promoting
a wide array of actions, including using federal funds to develop
the technology to burn ``clean'' coal, open up more federal lands to
oil exploration and give oil drillers new tax breaks.
   _Support efforts, mainly by private industry, to develop
methanol, or wood alcohol, as an alternative to gasoline. This would
sharply reduce the need for crude oil.
   _Try to increase the pool of talent in the Energy Department and
to promote creativity in its staff. He said his ``number one
objective'' was leading the department to higher standards of
personal excellence among the work force.

   David Duke, a former grand wizard of the
Ku Klux Klan, overcame two last-minute challenges and was sworn into
the Louisiana Legislature on Wednesday as black lawmakers vowed to
keep an eye on him.
   Duke took the oath of office after surviving a lawsuit and an
attempt by a lawmaker to deny him his House seat in a dispute over
whether Duke was a legal resident of his suburban New Orleans
district, which is 99.6 percent white.
   ``I want to allay fears that I will be divisive or a problem in
this great body,'' Duke told his new colleagues. ``I truly believe
when we took the pledge of allegiance this morning and we said
justice for all, I believe in that for America.
   ``And I believe that discrimination is wrong and reprehensible
when it is waged against anyone, black or white, in this country.''
   Duke, 38, smiled broadly and waved before Speaker Jim Dimos
administered the oath, which followed an attempt by Rep. Odon Bacque
to have the House investigate whether Duke lived in the Metairie
district a year as required by law. Opponents have said Duke lives a
couple of blocks outside the district.
   Earlier Wednesday, John Treen, a 63-year-old Metairie homebuilder
who fell to Duke by 227 votes in Saturday's special election, lost a
last-minute lawsuit in state court to block Duke from being seated
for not meeting the residency requirement.
   Duke also was accepted by the House Republicans as one of their
own, despite a move by national party chairman Lee Atwater to
repudiate him as a member of the GOP. An anti-Duke resolution was
drawn up Tuesday for action on Friday by the GOP executive council.
   President Bush and former President Reagan had taken the
extraordinary step of throwing their support to Treen, a longtime
Republican. Duke, who ran for president in 1988 as a Democrat,
joined the GOP just a few days before declaring his candidacy for
the House seat.
   Duke was cheered by supporters who packed the House chamber on
Wednesday. Some lined up along the side of the House floor and
others grabbed seats in the balcony. Duke's entourage booed House
members who rose to object to the swearing-in, but Dimos banged his
gavel and threatened to expel them.
   Two black House members walked out when Duke was sworn in.
   ``This a democracy and no one is above those laws,'' Bacque told
the House. ``The question before us today is, is Mr. Duke eligible
to serve?''
   Democrat Rep. John Alario argued that the time to challenge
Duke's residency was before the election, and he asked the House to
table Bacque's motion, effectively moving to seat Duke.
   After the motion was approved 69-33, Bacque said he would have no
further comment on his action. ``It's over,'' he said.
   A string of lawmakers, many of them black, took turns at the
microphone warning Duke that they would be keeping an eye on him.
   ``We are resolved and committed to make sure that racism will not
become the order of the day,'' said Rep. C.D. Jones.
   Duke was also welcomed as a member of the Republican legislative
caucus and met informally with other GOP legislators. ``It was a
nice fit. We talked about tax reform,'' said Rep. Jim St. Raymond.
   Outside on the Capitol steps, about 15 young adults marched in
protest, carrying signs reading ``David Duke's a Nazi Kook'' and
chanting.
   Duke was a grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan during the 1970s and
an international spokesman for the group, and was founder of the
National Association for the Advancement of White People. He once
was photographed in a Nazi uniform.

<HEAD>Stars And Stripes Editors Seek Protection From Military Censorship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Editors of the Pacific Stars and Stripes urged
Congress on Wednesday to give control of the newspaper to an
independent civilian editor, complaining it now is subjected to
censorship and ``browbeating'' by military officers.
   Defense department officials and officers contended there is no
censorship but acknowledged there is a widespread perception that it
exists. They said management changes are not needed.
   The comments came at a hearing of the House Armed Services
subcommittee on readiness at which representatives of the General
Accounting Office said an investigation had found that military
commanders and their representatives ``have attempted to influence
the reporting of news'' by both the Pacific and European editions of
Stars and Stripes.
   Rep. Earl Hutto, D-Fla., the subcommittee chairman, said he hoped
the hearing had ``cleared the air'' but said no immediate follow-up
action was planned.
   Martin N. Ferber, an official of GAO's international affairs
division, said that although the Pentagon intended to establish
guidelines to protect Stars and Stripes against censorship and
command influence, ``it has not accomplished this objective.''
   Ferber said the problem is rooted in the fact that Stars and
Stripes is a government publication, striving simultaneously to
provide news to U.S. military personnel stationed overseas while
also acting as an information organ for the armed forces.
   This dual purpose, he said, leads to conflict between civilian
journalists attempting to exercise constitutional rights of freedom
of the press and commanders charged with executing a military
mission.
   ``Different expectations by these groups are the primary reason
allegations of censorship exist,'' Ferber said.
   He said a survey conducted by the Society of Professional
Journalists established evidence that was ``conclusive at Stars and
Stripes in the Pacific but inconclusive for the European paper.''
   ``We found that the content of the news covered in Stars and
Stripes, compared to the wire services from which the news was
drawn, was consistent with the allegations we investigated,'' Ferber
said.
   The current Pacific editor of Stars and Stripes, and two former
editors all said censorship was routine at the newspaper and called
for civilian control of the editorial product.
   ``I had running skirmishes with various generals and admirals who
wanted to kill _ or plant _ stories in the news columns despite the
ill effect that such censorship and news management had on the
newspaper's already battered integrity and despite clear military
regulations that proscribed such abuse,'' said Timothy Hutchinson,
executive editor of Pacific Stars and Stripes from 1981 to 1984.
   ``This browbeating had been going on for decades in the Pacific
... and the results of it were painfully obvious,'' Hutchinson said.
``Staff morale was terrible, and circulation was plummeting.''
   Dewey W. Brackett, the current Pacific editor for the newspaper,
contended the situation has not changed,
   ``In my judgment Pacific Starts and Stripes today is a wilful
failure,'' he said. ``The paper's independence and integrity has
been purposely cast aside''
   ``The reason the paper is censored is sadly simple _ It disturbs
the generals and admirals,'' Brackett said. ``They do not like to
read negative stories about the U.S. government, the Defense
Department, the military installations and personnel under their
command or the governments of the Asian countries in which they are
located.''
   But Air Force Col. Edwin J. Montgomery, the current commander and
editor in chief of pacific Stars and Stripes, strongly disagreed.
   ``I have never had anyone _ no flag officer, no ambassador, no
bureaucrat, no one _ force the running or killing of a story, nor
has anyone dictated how a story should be edited or played,'' he
said.
   He said the paper's reputation is threatened by ``the largely
anonymous, but publicly trumpeted, allegations that the newspaper is
censored.''
   Montgomery said he believes that certain civilian employees
``have an agenda and the agenda is to remove all military influence
over the paper.''
   He also complained that the GAO report to Congress was
``seriously flawed'' and said differences between the European and
Pacific editions of Stars and Stripes or choices of what news
service copy was run were ``editorial judgment,'' affected by such
things as other stories competing for space.
   Two senior Pentagon officials also said the issue is editorial
judgement, not censorship.
   ``I fervently believe the system we have in place is sound,''
said William E. Hart, deputy assistant secretary of defense for
public affairs.
   ``Our paramount objective is to ensure a free flow of news and
information,'' said Jordan E. Rizer, director of the American Forces
Information Service. ``There has never been a calculated withholding
of news ever reported to me.''

   La Toya Jackson, big sister to

<HEAD>Party Attacks People's Front as Extremist</HEAD>

   The Communist Party of Lithuania has accused a
grassroots political group of becoming too extreme in its opposition
to government policies, Pravda said Wednesday.
   The Communist Party newspaper, in a report on a Lithuanian party
meeting a day earlier, accused some members of the Sajudis movement
of moving from support for party reform to clear opposition.
   Sajudis, part of the People's Front political movement, was
formed in the Baltic republic last year to push for greater
cultural, political and economic autonomy from Moscow.
   ``At the plenum it was noted that the extreme position started to
dominate the activity of Sajudis, at least of several of its leaders
and members,'' Pravda said.
   ``Today the movement has started to distance itself from its
initial proposals. Consciously or unconsciously, a part of Sajudis
openly is nearing the slogans of the clearly anti-socialist
(Lithuanian Liberty) League, and the so-called Party of Lithuanian
Democrats,'' the report said, referring to groups that advocate
outright independence for Lithuania.
   Party leaders said ``the threat of a split on national grounds is
quite serious'' in the republic, Pravda said.
   The plenum signified an effort by the party to regain the control
that has been shaken by the sudden emergence of Sajudis and the
spread of nationalist sentiments.
   Under pressure from Sajudis, the small republic has declared
Lithuanian the official language and chosen the flag of the
independent republic that existed between the world wars as the
republic's official banner.
   However, authorities were able in November to thwart an effort to
declare the republic sovereign in all areas except foreign policy
and defense matters as did Estonia, another Baltic republic.
   The Kremlin has tried without success to cool the ethnic
sentiments in the Baltic republics and elsewhere in the country.
   Sajudis has been active in putting forward candidates for
multiple-candidate elections March 26 for a new nationwide congress
of people's deputies, sometimes at the expense of party-backed
candidates. Pravda said the Lithuanian party also criticized many of
its own members for sympathizing with the organization.
   The plenum sharply criticized some official publications and
Lithuanian radio and television for leaning toward Sajudis, and the
party's ideological department came under attack for its lack of
activity.
   Kremlin-led calls for consolidation of ethnic groups into a
single program supporting Moscow's policies ``remain only on paper
so far,'' Pravda said.
   The plenum was held on the same day that the republic's
government declared Lithuanian the official language, making
official an act passed by its legislature in October.
   A week ago, Lithuanian activists marked the anniversary of the
declaration of independence from revolutionary Russia in 1918 with
rallies. A year earlier, a tight police presence had prevented any
such demonstrations.
   Ethnic Lithuanians make up about 80 percent of the republic's 3.6
million people, the largest such indigenous population in any of the
three Baltic republics.

   The House Veterans Affairs Committee on
Wednesday called for a $1.3 billion increase in the Bush
administration's recommended budget for the new Department of
Veterans Affairs.
   The committee's recommendation to the House Budget Committee, 4.3
percent more than what Bush submitted, was approved 27-0.
   The bulk of the increase, $1.1 billion, would be devoted to
medical care, for which the president had sought $10.7 billion.
   Officials of the Veterans Administration, which gets upgraded to
department status next month, have said they will be $600 million
short for medical care in the current fiscal year, but the
administration has not sought a supplemental appropriation.
   The committee recommended a $520 million supplemental
appropriation, of which $432 million would be devoted to medical
care, for the current fiscal year ending Sept. 30.
   Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., told the committee
before the vote, ``The Budget Committee must decided whether to add
$2.1 billion to NASA's budget ... should we proceed to build a space
laboratory when so many veterans health care facilities are in dire
need of repair?

<HEAD>Lawmakers Pick Away at Bush S&amp;L Bailout Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Wednesday sent its
333-page savings and loan bailout bill to Congress, where lawmakers
from both parties immediately started picking away at its key
provisions.
   Members of the Senate Banking Committee attacked provisions to
raise S&amp;Ls' capital requirements, finance the government portion of
the bailout off the federal budget _ at an extra cost of $4.6
billion to taxpayers _ and give the Treasury Department greater
control over the institutions.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady defended the administration's
plan as ``stucturally sound'' and said it ``assures the emergence of
a healthy and strong S&amp;L industry.''
   But senators questioned whether the proposed $90 billion infusion
of cash _ $40 billion of it already committed _ to close or merge
350 insolvent S&amp;Ls and pay for rescuing 205 last year would be
enough to do the job.
   ``Garbage in is garbage out,'' said Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., who
complained about the inaccuracy of past estimates of the bailout
costs by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the agency
that insures S&amp;L accounts to $100,000.
   Heinz said the $50 billion estimated cost of closing or merging
the remaining insolvent thrift institutions assumes that the market
value of their assets _ or loans _ and the collateral backing them
will shrink by only 8.3 percent.
   In the S&amp;Ls closed or merged so far, he said, the government has
found that the market values of those assets and collateral in
disposing of them has been 20 percent to 40 percent below what they
had been listed as on an institution's books.
   The administration also assumes in its package that 30-year bonds
to provide $50 billion over the next three years can be financed at
an annual interest cost of 7.7 percent, compared with the current
9.2 percent interest rate for 30-year Treasury bonds.
   Brady acknowedged the bonds will have to pay at least one-fourth
of a percentage point higher interest than the Treasury securities
to attract buyers, but he predicted the rates will fall if Congress
balances the federal budget.
   ``There's a substantial difference there,'' Heinz told him. ``I
don't see how you can.''
   Over the next 30 years, the administration estimates the total
cost _ including interest on the borrowed funds _ for cleaning up
S&amp;Ls at roughly $200 billion, with about 55 percent of it coming
from taxpayers.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas and the chairman of the House
Banking Committee, called the administration's economic assumptions
``rosy'' and said more realistic ones would show S&amp;L bailout
spending over the next three decades totaling $335 billion _ $183
billion of it from the taxpayers.
   Taxpayers would save $138 billion if Congress directly
appropriated the money rather than borrow it, Gonzalez said. But he
conceded that would require ``a special tax earmarked solely for the
purpose of financing the savings and loan bailout.
   ``Administration policy and political reality may rule out this
more direct approach,'' he said.
   But Sen. Don Riegle, D-Mich. and the Senate Banking Committee
chairman, said $4.61 billion in taxpayer costs could be saved if the
Treasury borrowed the money directly rather than through a ``side
door mechanism'' to keep if off the federal budget.
   James Blum, acting director of the Congressional Budget Office,
told the House Ways and Means Committee that the administration's
off-budget financing plan would boost taxpayer-paid interest
payments on the bailout plan by $100 million to $200 million a year.
   ``I haven't really heard what justifies that premium,'' Riegle
said. ``If there are advantages, they're not obvious to me.''
   Brady said the bailout could be financed as part of the budget
through regular, long-term Treasury borrowings. But he suggested
that it would be at a cost of ``one less Trident submarinme or no
day care ...'' if Congress went that route and still tried to stay
within the bounds of the deficit-reduction law.
   Several other provisions of Bush's bailout plan also were
attacked by senators _ including a measure that would force S&amp;Ls to
raise their capital requirements to 6 percent of their outstanding
loans _ as banks are now required _ over the next two years.
   Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, where a large bulk of the
insolvent S&amp;Ls are located, called that unrealistic.
   ``That may be possible in heaven,'' he said, ``Whether its
possible in Texas I think is debatable.''
   Sens. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., Terry Sanford, D-N.C., and others
indicated a willingness to push a proposal being advanced by the S&amp;L
industry to stretch out the timetable for reaching that 6 percent
capital requirement to five years.
   ``It would be a mistake to think that it (the Bush proposal) is
going to whip through just as it is,'' Sanford said, explaining that
the new capital requirements could destroy some healthy S&amp;Ls.
   Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah and the co-author of 1982 legislation that
largely deregulated the industry, opposed putting new re-regulation
authority under the Treasury Department, as Bush would.
   Garn acknowledged that he might not have the votes in the Senate
to stop that, given the widespread criticism of the way the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board and the FSLIC have regulated S&amp;Ls.
   Riegle, who introduced the administration's legislative package
with Garn on Wednesday, said he planned to have a bill ready for
full action by the Senate by the first week in April.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Navy cited
commanders' ``sacred obligation'' to help mariners in distress only
after a captain refused to rescue refugees who later resorted to
cannibalism, the officer's lawyer said Wednesday.
   Defense lawyer Dan Donato cited the obligation during Wednesday's
session of the court-martial of Capt. Alexander Balian, former
skipper of the USS Dubuque.
   Balian, 48, of Los Angeles, has been on trial since Feb. 10 on
charges of failing to give necessary assistance to more than 80
refugees he encountered in the South China Sea June 9 while en route
to the Persian Gulf.
   Closing arguments in the trial were set for Thursday, after which
the case is expected to go to the six-member jury for Navy captains.
   Thirty-one refugees died and survivors resorted to cannibalism
before they were rescued by Filipino fishermen June 27 after 37 days
at sea, U.N. officials said.
   The defense contends Navy regulations did not authorize captains
to rescue refugees if they were not in ``life-threatening''
situations.
   Balian said Wednesday that under new regulations issued July 23 a
captain ``would be stupid'' not to pick up refugees found at sea.
   Navy officials said the order states in part: ``In the
time-tested creed of mariners, no truth is more universal, more
sacred, than the obligation to assist one another in time of
distress. There is no operations order, no exercise, no commitment,
no timetable that supersedes this charge.''
   Balian said earlier regulations were not as clear.
   On Tuesday, Balian testified he would have rescued the refugees
if he had been correctly informed of their desperate plight. He said
his executive officer, Lt. Cmdr. Stanley Halter, told him the
Vietnamese believed they could make it safely to the Philippines if
they received food and water, which were provided.
   But on Wednesday, Halter denied making such a report to Balian.
   Balian was relieved of his command in August after the Vietnamese
reported the incident to U.N. officials in the Philippines.
   Last Thursday, he was acquitted of a charge of failing to assist
a Vietnamese who drowned.

<HEAD>Military Gives Sudanese Premier One Week To Change Policies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commander-in-chief and 150 other
military officers gave the prime minister one week to reform his
government and work to end the civil war, an army spokesman and
newspapers said Wednesday.
   Military spokesmen denied the ultimatum was a coup threat.
   The official Sudan News Agency said Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi
met throughout Wednesday with the disgruntled officers. The
government said the premier called an emergency Cabinet meeting for
Thursday and planned to consult leading politicians about the crisis.
   The reports appeared a day after Defense Minister Abdel-Magid
Khalil, a former army general, resigned to protest the government's
refusal to accept a peace agreement negotiated by a major political
party. Khalil said Mahdi's policies have left the country starving,
bankrupt and isolated from potential aid donors.
   Also Tuesday, southern rebels said they shelled a government
stronghold and major refugee center for the first time.
   Virtually all Khartoum's papers reported the ``warning
memorandum,'' which apparently was issued Tuesday, but none
specified what action the military chiefs would take.
   The Communist Party organ Al-Maidan said the army warned it would
retaliate if Mahdi tried to punish the memo's signers.
   Army spokesman Brig. Mohamed Osman Malik confirmed the officers
submitted to Mahdi a memorandum ``containing certain demands related
to our problems and concerns.''
   Asked whether the memo foreshadowed a military takeover, Malik
told The Associated Press: ``No, no. There is no coup. We have
already tried these coups in the past, and the army was the only
loser.''
   Another military spokesman said army officers had made ``certain
demands,'' but he would not characterize them as a coup threat.
   Newspapers said army Gen. Fathi Ahmed Ali, the
commander-in-chief, led the meeting of about 150 officers that
drafted the memorandum and gave it to Mahdi.
   The document demanded the government ``choose between war and
peace, and prepare properly for its choice,'' the newspapers said.
   Sudan has spent most of its 33 years of independence under
military rule. The longest spell was 16 years under dictator Gaafar
Nimeiri, whose overthrow in 1985 led to a one-year transitional
military government and Mahdi's election in April 1986.
   On Tuesday night, Sudanese rebels said they shelled the
provincial capital of Juba, a major refugee center in southern
Sudan, destroying a military hospital and ``other vital targets.''
   The Sudan People's Liberation Army broadcast, monitored in
Nairobi, Kenya, gave no casualty estimates and did not say when the
bombardment occurred.
   It was the first reported shelling of Juba since the revolt began
in 1983.
   There was no comment on the reported shelling from the Sudanese
government in Khartoum, 725 miles to the north, and the broadcast
could not be confirmed.
   Juba, a city of 150,000 people on the White Nile River, is the
capital of Sudan's southernmost province of Equatoria. More than
50,000 refugees from fighting and famine elsewhere in Sudan have
crowded into Juba, where they have been supplied with food, clothing
and medicine by the United Nations and other relief agencies.
   The rebel broadcast urged civilians living near military targets
around Juba to evacuate. The rebels also said it had cut road access
to the city.
   The rebels are fighting the mainly Moslem government in the north
to force economic and social reforms in the predominantly Christian
and animist south.

<HEAD>Hardworking Honeybees Give A Boost To Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hard-working honeybee is worth at least
$9.7 billion to farmers, not to mention all that sweet stuff that is
so good on biscuits, a new study by Cornell University showed
Wednesday.
   Honeybees are used by the millions to pollinate major crops of
fruits, berries, vegetables, tree nuts, oilseeds and legumes. Their
keepers rent them out commercially, trucking the bees to crop areas.
   The study was prepared by Cornell for the National Honey Board,
which was authorized by Congress and established by the Agriculture
Department in 1986 to promote honey and honey research, all financed
through a levy on producers.
   About a million colonies of bees are involved in commercial crop
pollination, about a third of all U.S. managed colonies, the report
said. That is about double the number estimated in the early 1980s.
   ``To a significant degree, because of the hard work of the
honeybee we have abundant food supplies at reasonable prices,'' said
Dan Hall, manager of the National Honey Board, which is based in
Longmont, Colo.
   Commercial pollination ranges from blueberries and cranberries in
New England to apples in the Northwest and New York to almonds in
California and some citrus in Florida.
   Other major examples cited included alfalfa seed in the West,
melons in Texas, cucumbers in the Carolinas and Michigan, sunflowers
in Minnesota, and seeds for onions, carrots, celery and other
vegetables in many states.
   Frederick Hoff of USDA's Economic Research Service said that
``many consumers are unaware that honeybees are used to pollinate
foods they are dependent upon. He said the study shows that
pollination is ``even more important than we thought.''
   The Cornell study was based on 1985 information and showed that
the $9.7 billion in direct benefits represented the dollar value of
increased crop yields and quality as the result of honeybee crop
pollination.
   ``Crop quality improvements include larger and more uniform size,
desirable shape, uniform maturation date, and all result in higher
market value,'' the report said.

   The disease that gave W.C. Fields one of the most
famous noses in America can now be treated with a new drug, its
developers said Wednesday.
   MetroGel, developed by Curatek Pharmaceuticals Inc. of suburban
Elk Grove Village, has won approval from the Food and Drug
Administration as the first prescription drug in the United States
specifically for rosacea, or adult acne.
   The condition, which researchers said gave Fields his red,
bulbous nose, affects people in their 30s and 40s, and, if
untreated, can lead to significant disfigurement.
   Most people with rosacea don't even know it is treatable, said
Dr. Jonathan Wilkin, director of dermatology at Ohio State
University, who joined Curatek officials at a news conference
announcing the drug.
   ``Fields entrenched the notion that people who have rosacea are
abusing alcohol,'' Wilkin said. But he added that while alcohol may
aggravate the disease, rosacea can be just as severe in non-drinkers.
   Wilkin also said no one really knows what causes the rosacea. The
condition can be reversed if caught in its early stages, he said.
   In Fields' case, the disorder progressed to what is called
rhinophyma, a condition in which dilated pores on the nose become
excess tissue that results in a bulbous, red appearance, Wilkin said.
   The most common treatment in the past has been oral antibiotics,
which tended to be ineffective or associated with adverse reactions
like allergies, nausea and yeast infections, Wilkin said. ``You
could never depend on those products,'' he said.
   Wilkin said MetroGel has little or no side effects.
   MetroGel, with the scientific name metronidazole, is a
water-based gel that is invisible, odorless and can be used under
makeup.
   Approved by the FDA in November, it is available by prescription
at a cost of $14 to $20 for a one-ounce tube, said Robert J.
Borgman, president of Curatek.
   Wilkin said women are slightly more susceptible to rosacea than
men, but more severe cases are found in men, and heredity also may
play a role.
   People at the greatest risk of rosacea are fair-skinned
individuals who flush easily, and their condition may be triggered
by a variety of factors, including spicy foods, he said.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nov. 7, the anniversary of the Bolshevik
Revolution in Russia, will no longer be a red-letter day in Hungary.
   Instead, Hungarians will celebrate March 15, the anniversary of
the 1848 anti-Austrian uprising, as a public holiday for the first
time this year, spokesman Gyoergy Marosan said Wednesday.
   The Council of ministers took the decision at a meeting
Wednesday, he said.
   The decision to stop marking the anniversary of the 1917
Bolshevik Revolution _ a holiday marked in each of the Soviet bloc
countries _ is indicative of the degree of independence Hungary has
acquired with its ambitious reform program.
   The March 15 anniversary has been marked by small unofficial
rallies since 1972. Since 1983, however, increasing numbers of
people have taken part, and last year, 10,000 people marched through
the streets calling for democracy, a free press and free elections.
   These are some of the same demands made by the leaders of the
1848 uprising to shake off the Hapsburg rule. Although it failed, it
had a long-term effect on the future relations of the
Austro-Hungarian monarchy, and in 1867, the Hungarians were given a
series of unprecedented privileges.
   Alternative groups have demanded for years that March 15 be
declared a national holiday as it bears strong national significance
for Hungarians.
   Official rallies also were conducted in the past with a
reenactment of the reading of a 12-point program for democracy
issued at the time. Hungarians wore the national colors on that day.
   In December, parliament agreed to make March 15 an official
public holiday. It will be celebrated as such this year for the
first time since the communists came to power in 1948.
   Last weekend, more than 15 independent groups rejected a call by
the Communist Party to stage joint celebrations, referring to
previous police force at past independent rallies, the state news
agency MTI reported.
   On Tuesday, Communist Party Central Committee Secretary Gyoergy
Fejti said he regretted the decision, but said he hoped a joint
celebration still could be arranged.
   ``For years we (the party leadership) were accused ... of
speaking with the arrogance of power,'' Fejti said. I would regret
it if the opposition would speak with another arrogance.''

   A British soldier was shot
and killed Wednesday while driving a school bus to pick up army
children from an elementary school in Londonderry, police said. The
IRA claimed responsibility.
   Police later arrested three men in connection with the shooting.
A spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's police
force, said the men were taken to Castlereagh holding center in
Belfast for questioning.
   The Irish Republican Army has targeted British soldiers in its
fight to end British rule in Northern Ireland and unite the
Protestant-dominated province with the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic
Republic of Ireland.
   It claimed responsibility for the shooting in a statement
circulated to news media in Belfast.
   Lance Cpl. Norman Duncan was hit by a hail of bullets while
driving through Londonderry's predominantly Protestant Waterside
district. Duncan, 27, a father of three, was a member of the Royal
Corps of Transport.
   A member of Parliament said in London that the IRA is receiving
semiautomatic rifles, or self-loading, through American arms dealers.
   ``I have received information which suggests that self-loading
rifles ... have been reaching the IRA via arms dealers in the United
States,'' said Barry Sheerman of the opposition Labor Party. He did
not elaborate.
   Britain banned semiautomatic rifles after a man armed with one
killed 16 people and then himself in Hungerford in August 1987.

   Japan successfully launched a research satellite
Wednesday from its space center at Tanegashima, authorities said.
   The launch went smoothly and the satellite, named EXOS-D, entered
its orbit as planned, said the official from the Institute of Space
and Astronautical Science.
   EXOS-D, the 12th scientific satellite launched by the
government-sponsored agency, will study the Earth's auroras and
their relationship to plasma particles emitted by the sun, she said.
   Auroras are luminous displays, usually seen around the north and
south poles, believed to be caused by collisions of charged
particles from the sun and oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the Earth's
atmosphere. The 660-pound satellite contains eight devices to study
and photograph auroras and plasma waves, the official said.
   The satellite's elliptical orbit is expected to range from 250
miles to 6,250 miles.
   Japan limits its rocket launches to only 90 days a year _ 45 days
in July and August and 45 days in January and February _ because of
protests from tuna fishermen in the area of the space center, off
Japan's southern main island of Kyushu. The fishermen say rocket
launches are dangerous.
   Japan entered the aerospace field late because of restrictions
imposed by U.S. occupation forces after World War II, but has
advanced quickly in recent years with a high success rate.

Hawaii to visit public health facilities. ``What I want to try to do
is find ways of delivering that health message in a way that
captures the attention of the American people, and, well, television
is the way to go.''
   ``Not the stodgy documentary that people turn off as soon as they
know what it's about,'' he said Sunday. ``I want it to be exciting
so they see what their problems are and how they can address them.''
   The surgeon general is appointed by the president, and Koop's
term expires in November.

<HEAD>Stocks Plunge As Inflation Concerns Swell</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices fell sharply Wednesday as signs of
accelerating inflation punctured the optimism that has fueled the
stock market's recent rally.
   Stocks suffered from a government report of a jump in consumer
prices and from a statement by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan, who said he was disturbed by inflation's strength.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks skidded 42.50 to
2,283.93, its biggest drop since Nov. 11, when the widely-followed
index tumbled 47.66.
   Broader measures of stock activity also fell, and declining
issues outnumbered advancing ones by nearly 4 to 1 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   The Labor Department said consumer prices rose at an annual rate
of 7.2 percent in January, propelled by higher costs for gasoline,
poultry, fish, eggs and tobacco.
   The report and Greenspan's remarks heightened concerns that the
Fed would push interest rates higher to try to hold down inflation.
   High short-term interest rates could drain money away from stocks
and into higher-yielding securities such as Treasury bills. In
addition, high rates might push the economy into a recession that
would be bad for stocks.
   The stock market had rallied since late last year, returning for
the first time to the levels it held before the October 1987 crash.
Analysts said a sense of optimism had returned to Wall Street.

   Protesters on Wednesday displayed an
eight-foot rendition of a ballot with the names of candidates
crossed out and criticized the government's failure to allow
multiple-candidate elections.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev meanwhile pushed reforms in Soviet
coal country.
   The demonstration by about 500 people in the Ukrainian capital,
the fourth in four nights, was held under a special decree allowing
spontaneous meetings concerning the March 26 elections that will
choose members of a newly formed Parliament.
   Demonstrations normally require government permission, and that
rarely has been forthcoming in the Ukraine. The republic's Communist
Party leader, Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, is the only holdover on the
ruling party Politburo from the era of Leonid I. Brezhnev and
tolerates little dissident.
   Shcherbitsky's name and those of other Ukranian officials were
crossed out on the protesters' banner resembling a ballot. Another
poster read: ``Fear! Why is there only one candidate on the ballot?''
   Oles Shevchenko, head of the Ukrainian group monitoring
compliance with the Helsinki human rights accords, said virtually
all Ukrainian leaders are running unopposed and voters seeking an
alternative will only be able to cross out their names. The party
had promised that the March 26 elections will offer more than one
candidate for seats in the Congress of People's Deputies.
   Competing demonstrators at Wednesday's meeting, whom activists
claimed were government agents, held up a banner charging,
``Nationalism puts the brakes on perestroika,'' Gorbachev's policy
of political and economic reform. The sign was printed in Ukrainian
letters but slipped into Russian in the middle.
   Shevchenko said activists were encouraged by Gorbachev's
statements to Kiev residents broadcast on television Monday night,
suggesting workers throw out bosses who do not support reforms.
   Gorbachev, in the coal-mining center of Donetsk in the eastern
Ukraine on Wednesday, told a group of workers ``those who are trying
to put a stick through the spokes of perestroika, or to puncture the
tire, and let the air out, and reduce the movement of perestroika,
are the most dangerous people.''
   Donetsk is just south of Dnepropetrovsk, the city that was the
power base of Brezhnev, who died in 1982 and now is blamed for
fostering a period of economic and social stagnation and permitting
wide-spread corruption.
   Gorbachev's visit to Donetsk on the third day of his stay in the
Ukraine took up 90 minutes of the nightly news program ``Vremya,''
which normally is only a 45-minute program. The news program showed
Gorbachev talking with residents of the city, visiting factories and
holding a session with a group of miners.
   Workers complained about the inattentiveness of some local
officials and told the Soviet president that the area needs more
modern mining equipment to dig deeper into its coal veins. Gorbachev
preached economic reform, technical renewal and self-reliance.

<HEAD>Allegations Of Fish And Wildlife Service Mismanagement Surface At
Hearing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials have
paid more attention to politics than to protecting the nation's
natural resources, a House subcommittee chairman said Wednesday in
pledging that Congress will fully investigate allegations of
mismanagement at the agency.
   Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., made the comments at a hearing a day
after the General Accounting Office said top FWS officials pressured
biologists in the agency's Northwest regional office into
``sanitizing'' a study which originally warned the spotted owl was
threatened by extinction.
   ``We are well aware that serious allegations have been made in
recent months about the management of the Fish and Wildlife
Service,'' said Studds.
   Frank Dunkle, director of the FWS, told Studds the charges are
``unfounded, inconsequential and you are on a witch hunt,'' he said.
   Among the allegations that Studds said the GAO and the staff of
the Merchant Marine and Fisheries subcommittee on fisheries,
wildlife conservation and environment have or would investigate were:
   _ Political pressures may have influenced the agency's decision
not to list the spotted owl as an endangered species.
   _ The regional director in the agency's Portland, Ore., office
was reassigned for essentially political reasons and Congress was
misled about the reasons for the reassignment.
   _ FWS officials in the Fairbanks, Ala., office were ordered by
Washington-based officials to destroy files on a plan which called
for building a causeway to carry oil drilling equipment to an
offshore site.
   _ Proper procedures were not followed when the agency considered
the environmental impacts of the Two Forks Dam project in Colorado.
   _ Agency personnel have been ordered to carry out directives on
verbal rather than written instructions, and employees in at least
one office were required to sign a pledge that they would not even
keep a memo on file without approval.
   Dunkle refused to answer a string of questions from Studds about
whether political concerns should be allowed to take precedence over
scientific evidence or legal requirements, whether agency personnel
should be transferred because they don't agree with the ``policy
preferences'' of their superiors and whether an open investigation
of the allegations would be ``beneficial.''
   ``I will respond in writing,'' said Dunkle. ``I'm not sure what
you are getting at.''
   ``I'm surprised at your defensiveness,'' said Studds.
   ``My job is to carry out the laws set forth by Congress and I
have done just that,'' said Dunkle.
   After the hearing, Dunkle denied that he had applied any
political pressure on agency officials who eventually decided not to
classify the spotted owl as an endangered species.
   Dunkle told reporters he had not seen the report from GAO,
Congress' investigative arm, and declined comment.
   GAO said FWS officials intentionally ignored scientific evidence
and ordered changes in the study prepared by biologists in the
agency's Pacific Northwest regional office.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service, a Department of Interior Agency,
is required to consider only ``biological factors'' in deciding what
species are designated for protection as threatened or endangered.
   The agency concluded in December 1987 that the owl, which lives
only in ancient timber in Oregon, Washington and northern
California, was not endangered.
   The timber industry in the Northwest has vehemently opposed any
effort to name the owl a threatened or endangered species, fearing
that such a move would disrupt logging in public forests.

<HEAD>Foreign Relations Chairman Asks Bush to Back Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee called on the Bush administration on Wednesday to throw
its weight behind the peace plan offered last week by Central
America's five presidents.
   ``I view these developments as encouraging and for that reason am
dismayed by the unenthusiastic reaction of the administration this
far,'' said Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I. ``We should be providing a
fair breeze behind this initiative to make it work.''
   In the agreement, the Sandinista government of Nicaragua said it
would hold free elections by February 1990 and release some 3,000
political prisoners if bases used by Contra resistance fighters
inside Honduras are dismantled.
   Other signers included the presidents of Honduras, Costa Rica,
Guatemala and El Salvador.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told the House Foreign
Affairs Committee on Tuesday that while the agreement could provide
a good basis for bringing peace and democracy to Nicaragua, it lacks
deadlines and procedures to assure Sandinista compliance.
   He said the Sandinistas have made similar promises in the past
and have broken them each time.
   ``There are risks involved,'' Pell told the Senate. ``There are
no guarantees that the Sandinistas will comply with the accord. They
are Marxists who have not given up their communist principles. But
the economic realities they face provide significant pressure.''
   ``The United States should make known its support for this plan
to give it the best possible chance of working,'' Pell said. ``If it
fails, we should not give cause for that failure to be laid at our
door.''
   Pell said the United States should restructure aid to the Contras
in ways supporting the accord, including providing funds to resettle
the Contras and their families in Nicaragua or other countries.

<HEAD>Sullivan Prepared to Tell Congress He Misspoke on Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Louis Sullivan will tell Congress at his
confirmation hearing that he ``misspoke'' his position on abortion
both in a newspaper interview and to a senator, a source close to
the Health and Human Services secretary-designate said Wednesday.
   In his opening statement to the Senate Finance Committee on
Thursday, he will say he misrepresented his views when he said he
supported women's right to abortion and the Supreme Court decision
that legalized abortion, said the source, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   ``He'll say he misspoke,'' the source said. ``He's going to say
his personal view, his public view is that he's against abortion,''
with the same exceptions that President Bush endorses: in cases if
rape, incest and danger to the life of the mother.
   Finance Committee sources said they expect the confirmation
hearing to go smoothly and that panel members will vote their
approval following the hearing.
   Sources close to Sullivan, who will step down as president of the
Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta to join Bush's Cabinet, say
the nominee initially was unprepared for the heat that could be
generated by the emotion-packed issue of abortion.
   Sullivan riled abortion opponents with remarks he made in an
interview with an Atlanta newspaper shortly after his nomination and
again when Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., reported the nominee had told
him he favored retaining the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision.
   His remarks prompted right-to-life groups to demand assurances
from the Bush administration that Sullivan's policies at the HHS
would follow those of the president on abortion.
   Sullivan's hearing had been scheduled for earlier this month but
was put off at the request of the White House because an FBI
background investigation was still under way and the nominee had not
finished his financial disclosure report.
   Two weeks ago, Sullivan put financial conflict of interest
concerns to rest when he decided to forfeit nearly $300,000 in
severance pay he could have received if he had cut his ties to the
medical school he founded.
   He was prepared to do that, according to a senior administration
official, but was concerned when news reports raised questions about
the arrangement and decided instead to forgo the money and instead
take an unpaid leave of absence.
   Sullivan is expected to be questioned about that decision, as
well as part of the FBI investigation that focused on his connection
to a former Georgia county official convicted of extortion.
   Unrelated to his extortion conviction, Reginald Eaves was paid
more than $34,000 over four years as a part-time lecturer at
Morehouse while he used his seat on the Fulton County commission to
promote issues that benefited the medical school. He gave only two
lectures.
   Sullivan will tell Congress he ``made a mistake'' by hiring
Eaves, which is what he said publicly when the arrangement came to
light last summer, according to a source close to the nominee.

<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department said Wednesday that
the long-time slide in the U.S. cattle inventory has ended and that
producers are beginning to expand their herds.
   According to a USDA report issued Feb. 8, the nation's cattle
inventory as of Jan. 1 was virtually the same as it had been a year
earlier. Many private analysts had been saying the herd numbers
would show another significant decline.
   ``This expansion dramatically changes the beef outlook for 1989
and beyond,'' the department's Economic Research Service said.
``Beef cows number 2 percent above a year earlier, and beef
replacement heifers were up 5 percent.''
   Moreover, the report noted that the Jan. 1 figures showed last
year's calf crop was 672,000 head larger than had been projected
last summer.
   Including dairy animals, the U.S. herd of cattle and calves
totaled a 28-yer low of 99,484,000 head on Jan. 1, down only 40,000
head from a year ago.

   The Senate called on the Bush administration
Wednesday to consider organizing an international long-term
reconstruction effort for those areas of Soviet Armenia devastated
by last December's earthquake.
   It adopted a resolution calling on Secretary of State James A.
Baker III to submit by April 1 a report spelling out what the United
States, perhaps in conjunction with private efforts, could do to
help Armenia rebuild.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., a sponsor of the resolution, said it is
obvious Armenia's needs go beyond the $106 million in international
public and private relief that has been provided since the
earthquake struck last Dec. 7.
   Simon said, ``We cannot lose sight of the stark reality of
Armenia: 500,000 homeless; 25,000 dead; 130,000 injured.''
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said reconstruction in Armenia will cost an
estimated $13 billion.
   ``This legislation asks the administration to explore the idea of
establishing a joint public-private task force to participate in an
international relief effort,'' Pell said.
   ``The international community may be able to find ways to help
rebuild the collapsed towns throughout Soviet Armenia,'' he said.

   A live Maine lobster bought for a
Valentine's Day dinner got a reprieve from a boiling pot when a wife
told her husband she preferred the sea crustacean as a pet instead
of as a main course.
   Suzanne Brown had planned to serve the lobster to her husband,
Dave, to crown a romantic, home-cooked dinner.
   She presented her husband with the $14 catch wrapped in
newspaper, a valentine attached. But when it came time to drop it in
the boiling water, Suzanne proved to be softer skinned than her
hard-shelled prey.
   ``I kinda fell in love with a lobster,'' said Mrs. Brown. ``I
decided I wanted to keep him for a pet.''
   The 1\-pound lobster, dubbed Oscar, stayed alive in the Brown's
refrigerator in a damp towel while Suzanne called around for help in
setting up a lobster tank.
   The Seattle Aquarium couldn't help her, nor could the University
of Washington. She finally went back to seafood market, where she
learned that the smallest commercial tanks go for $1,200.
   So Gary Gerontis of Johnny's Seaford took the lobster back and
promised to fly it back to Gloucester, Maine, so that the wholesaler
can throw it back into the Atlantic.
   ``He could live another 50 years, or he could get caught next
week,'' said Harold Frisk, sales manager for the wholesaler,
International Lobster.

   For $10 you can buy a historic home
from the Springfield Preservation and Restoration group. And the
group will give you $1,000.
   All you have to do is move. The house, that is.
   The six homes for sale are on property purchased by University
Hospital and must be moved by April. The catch is that they may not
be worth the cost of moving them, estimated at $10,000 to $30,000
each.
   The houses, built between 1910 and 1920, are in disrepair and
have become havens for vagrants, making the area dangerous for
hospital employees, said Judy Skelton, a hospital spokeswoman.
   ``We want to work with SPAR to preserve the houses for historical
purposes, but a lot of our employees have to walk past there from
the parking lot and it's just not safe,'' she said.
   University Hospital turned the homes over to the preservation
group, which is selling them for $10 each and then funneling $1,000
from the hospital as an incentive to buyers.

   A team of government and private veterinarians
has cleared the Navy of allegations it mistreated dolphins and sea
lions being trained for various underwater surveillance duties.
   The Marine Mammal Commission review team, after what it described
as an extensive survey of Navy facilities and practices, sharply
criticized a former Navy trainer and other unidentified sources who
charged last November the service was guilty of animal abuse.
   ``The review team found the allegations to be substantively
lacking,'' states the commission's report, released Wednesday by the
Navy.
   The team ``concluded that allegations had been put forward in
such a way as to create an inaccurate picture,'' the report
continued.
   ``Furthermore, the team concluded that, had the sole motivation
underlying the allegations been concern for the health, welfare and
care of the animals, the former trainer would have made better use
than he did of the Navy's Animal Care Committee.''
   The program now includes about 115 animals, the majority of them
dolphins and the remainder of them beluga whales. THe service trains
the mammals to detect enemy scuba divers and to hunt for underwater
mines. The program began more than 20 years ago.
   The Washington-based Marine Mammal Commission, which advises all
federal agencies on the handling of marine mammals, ordered an
investigation after former Navy trainer Rick Trout charged last
November he had witnessed ``incidents of abuse, weight loss,
corporal punishment and damage to animals after transport.''
   Trout, who no longer works for the Navy, made the allegations
during an appearance before the International Marine Animal Trainers
Association meeting in San Antonio, Texas.
   To investigate the charges, the commission appointed a
seven-member review team that included veterinarians or medical
doctors from the Agriculture Department; the National Marine
Fisheries Services; various university faculties, and the Chicago
Zoological Society.
   None of the members had ties to the Navy.
   After conducting lengthy interviews with Trout and other former
Navy employees, and then inspecting Navy facilities and records, the
review team concluded:

   _A Navy dolphin that died after being transported to the Persian
Gulf did not succumb to ``poor training, mistreatment, mishandling
or changes in water temperature.'' The dolphin died of bronchial
pneumonia.
   _``There is no evidence that the nutritional program as it
presently exists has adversely affected the health and welfare of
the animals,'' and certainly no evidence of intentional starvation.
   _The only trainer ever observed using food to ``bait'' a dolphin
during training or dumping fish outside a netted pen as punishment
``was the person making the allegations.''
   _There have been only two isolated incidents within the past
three years of a trainer slapping or striking a dolphin, and in both
cases the trainers were immediately disciplined.
   _During the last 22 months, three dolphins have died at the
Navy's mammal center in San Diego. The deaths ``were not related to
improper training, poor handling techniques or inadequate veterinary
care.''
   _And there is ``no evidence of animals having been blinded or
injured or as a result of poor training procedures.''
   The team did not give the Navy a completely clean bill of health.
For example, it concluded the Navy's San Diego facility _ where
Trout worked _ did a better job than a facility in Hawaii of
ensuring that veterinarians supervised all aspects of care and
training.
   It also criticized delays in the hiring of two additional
full-time veterinarians and noted that ``in the past, there has been
one high-level person within the Pentagon responsible for the marine
mammal program.''
   ``That does not appear to be the case now. The team recommends
that such an assignment be made.''
   All in all, though, the Navy is following or exceeding federal
guidelines for the proper handling of marine mammals, the team said.
And in some areas, such as the ratio of trainers and veterinarians
to animals and medical care standards and record-keeping, the Navy's
performance ``is as good as or better than in other institutions.''

   Postponing the March 19
presidential election, proposed by the rebels as a cornerstone of
lasting peace, appeared no more likely Wednesday than before the
rebels and delegates of political parties met in Mexico.
   The proposal, made by the leftist guerrillas on Jan. 24, has been
the subject of intense debate ever since. They presented a revised
proposal Monday and Tuesday, and the political parties said they
would ask the government to consider it.
   But as the debate drags on, election time draws closer and the
level of violence in this small Central American country increases.
   At a news conference in Mexico City, the rebel Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front said again its offer is good only for a
limited time. Guerrilla commander Roberto Roca said if the
government refused to talk, it will ``bear the blame for
continuation of the war.''
   The war began in 1980 and has killed 70,000 people, mostly
civilians.
   Some politicians described the talks as more a means of keeping
up appearances and avoiding blame for their failure than a serious
consideration of the rebel overture.
   Asked if any better chance existed now for postponing the
elections, Hector Silva, a leader of the leftist Democratic
Convergence, replied simply, ``No.''
   The Farabundo Marti told the politicians it would accept a vote
as early as July and would observe a cease-fire during a four-month
campaign.
   That would still put the election past the June 1 date on which
the constitution calls for President Jose Napoleon Duarte to step
down.
   The insurgents also said the armed forces, now at 56,000 men,
would have to be cut to 12,000 _ their size a decade ago.
   A high-ranking government official said the insurgents softened
their position by accepting an earlier date for elections than
proposed earlier, but hardened it with the stipulation on troop
reducion.
   ``One (bad) element of the new position is enough to sink it,''
he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The U.S.-supplied and tutored armed forces opposed the proposal
from the start.
   ``While millions of Salvadorans clamor for peace and reject
violence, death and destruction, the FMLN, represented in Mexico by
four terrorist chiefs, is launching the most sinister strategic
plans of Marxism-Leninism in order to obtain power by force of
arms,'' the Defense Ministry said in a communique issued Wednesday.
   The armed forces and the rightist Republican National Alliance,
or Arena, consider the guerrilla proposal a ploy. Arena is favored
to win next month's election and has little motivation to accept a
delay.
   The executive branch and the U.S. Embassy also expressed doubts
about rebel sincerity.
   The guerrillas said the war will escalate if their proposal is
rejected and accused political parties of hiding behind the
constitution to avoid serious discussion.
   Party leaders agreed in Mexico to continue discussing the plan
once back in San Salvador and said they would press Duarte's
government to discuss the new rebel offer directly with its authors.
   Duarte four weeks ago said resolution of the matter was up to the
political parties.
   Asked Wednesday if the parties had thrown the ball back to the
government, the government official said, ``It's not so much that we
gave them the ball. We loaned it to them to play with for a while.''
   Guerrilla leader Shafick Handal said the last time the Farabundo
Marti sat down with Duarte, he came to the negotiations empty-handed.
   ``They didn't propose a thing,'' Handal said.
   Legislator Sigifredo Ochoa, a top Arena leader, told local Radio
YSU on Wednesday: ``There in Mexico everyone except us was trying to
see what advantage they could pull out of this. We are the only ones
who have been clear in our position from the beginning.''
   Asked about possible reduction of government troop strength,
Ochoa, a retired colonel, said, ``I'm against it. It changes the
essence of the original proposal.''
   Democratic Convergence leader Silva told The Associated Press
that Arena was rejecting the proposal without spelling out its
position.
   ``It is their way of saying `No' while paying the lowest price
politically,'' he said.
   The rebels meanwhile attacked two major army bases on Tuesday,
killing four soldiers and three civilians.
   Guerrilla sabotage left 60 percent of this Massachusetts-sized
country without electricity Wednesday. Roca said the guerrillas
don't intend to stop fighting while they await a decision on their
proposal.
   ``The operations of the (Salvadoran) army continue. For our part,
so will ours,'' said Roca.

<HEAD>Freighter Crew Lost In Atlantic Storm</HEAD>

   A Panamanian-registered freighter hauling a load of
salt to Iceland capsized and sank in violent seas on Wednesday, and
all 17 crew members died, the coast guard said.
   Ships, rescue planes and helicopters struggled in vain to aid the
Japanese-owned, 2,625-ton Sescil Angola, which sank 350 miles west
of Scotland.
   Squadron Leader Bob Conolly of the Royal Air Force said crew
members may have died because they waited too long to abandon ship.
   Later Wednesday, Clyde Coast Guard on Scotland's west coast said
a Danish fishing boat in the same area also sent a distress call.
Another Danish fishing vessel responded and was escorting it to
Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides.
   The Nunarsuit from Godthab, Greenland, with nine crew, ``had its
bridge windows smashed in by huge waves,'' said a Coast Guard
spokesman, who by custom was unidentified.
   ``But another Danish fishing boat from the same harbor, the
Narssalik, got there and is steaming with it to Stornoway. There are
no casualties,'' he said.
   Planes and ships searched all day for survivors from the Sescil
Angola, which was carrying salt from Spain to Iceland.
   When the search was called off at nightfall, five bodies had been
recovered and six more sighted, rescue services said.
   The freighter had reported water in two holds, and the last
message from the ship's unidentified captain said, ``There is great
danger. Helicopters please hurry.''
   Conolly, captain of a Nimrod reconnaissance aircraft that was
first on the scene, advised the crew to launch their lifeboat
immediately.
   ``The crew did not want to abandon ship. They wanted to come off
by helicopter. They held on too long and the boat turned over,'' he
said.
   But he added that weather conditions were so severe that even if
the crew had abandoned ship earlier, their chances of survival might
have been slim.
   The rescue effort involved Royal Air Force teams from Scotland,
northern England and Wales and U.S. helicopters from Iceland.
   Scottish coast guard officer John Griffiths at Greenock said the
freighter sent out its first distress call shortly after midnight,
and the first aircraft to enter the search took off 12 minutes later
from Kinloss in northern Scotland.
   It arrived over the Sescil Angola at 2 a.m. and dropped life
rafts, two of which were shredded by the wind and blown away.
   The coast guard said the freighter sank at 7:25 a.m.
   The first Royal Air Force Sea King helicopter arrived two hours
later. Winchman Bob Griffths said he was lowered to just above the
tops of the waves to inspect the life rafts.
   ``No one could have survived,'' he said.
   ``The conditions were horrendous. The life rafts were tied
together in pairs and were shooting up and down on 50-foot waves.
There were broken pieces of ship all over the place,'' he said.

   Rain and snow have helped improve the soil
conditions for winter wheat but parts of the Great Plains grain area
still needs moisture, the government's Joint Agricultural Weather
Facility said Wednesday.
   Rain during the week of Feb. 13-19 helped winter wheat in
Oklahoma and parts of Texas, the facility said in its weekly report.
In Kansas, the crop needed snow cover and moisture.
   ``Snow cover was mostly adequate in the northern plains,'' the
report said. ``Additional snow improved cold weather protection in
Michgan; winter wheat was mostly good to fair in Illinois.''
   Freeze damage to grain planted last fall in Washington was still
unknown but was expected to be substantial in some areas, the report
said. Wind damage was light in Colorado and Montana, although
moisture was needed in Colorado to prevent wind erosion to winter
wheat.
   The facility is operated by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments to provide weekly updates on weather and crop conditions.

   The former House intelligence committee
chairman testified Wednesday at Oliver North's trial that he relied
on White House denials of reports of U.S. military help to the
Nicaragua Contras for more than a year until the Iran-Contra affair
became known.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., the first prosecution witness, said
then-National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane twice denied any
involvement in letters in 1985 and at a committee briefing that year.
   A year later Hamilton and his committee directly questioned
North, then an aide on the National Security Council staff about
whether he had violated the Boland Amendment, a 1984 prohibition
against U.S. military aid to the Contras.
   ``Colonel North insisted he had not violated the Boland
Amendment, that he was not assisting the Contras by raising money,
that he had not provided any military advice to the Contras,''
Hamilton said of the Aug. 6, 1986 meeting in the White House
situation room.
   ``I relied on what Colonel North told me at the meeting,''
Hamilton said. ``I believed what Colonel North told me at the
meeting. I did not think there was any credible evidence to the
contrary.''
   North was originally charged with conspiracy in the alleged
scheme to divert money from Iran arms sales to aid the Nicaraguan
Contras. That charge was dropped and he is on trial on 12 felony
charges that include obstructing congressional inquiries into his
activities in 1985 and 1986.
   The committee's inquiries were first made in August 1985
following news reports that North was helping raise money for the
Contras and giving them tactical military advice _ despite the 1984
amendment.
   ``When McFarlane told me they were not engaged in raising funds
for the Contras and that the National Security Council was not
providing military advice ... I took Mr. McFarlane's word for it. I
relied upon what the national security adviser for the president
told me.''
   Hamilton said he thought that information was ``accurate, honest
and correct'' and did not pose questions about the Contras to the
CIA or the Defense Department.
   He told the court that Congress was disturbed in November 1986
when it learned the United States had sold arms to Iran ``because it
ran counter to policy.''
   ``We were telling all the world we do not sell arms to terrorist
nations,'' he said. ``If this was true we were dealing with a
terrorist nation. We were telling the world we did not deal for
hostages but if this was true we did make concessions to get
hostages.
   ``The sale of arms to Iran violated all we understood to be the
policy of the U.S. government.''
   Prosecutors are trying to show that North, then a Marine
lieutenant colonel serving on the NSC staff, subverted the processes
of government by helping McFarlane draft false answers to letters
from Congress inquiring about the news reports. McFarlane, who is
expected to testify as a prosecution witness, has pleaded guilty to
four misdemeanor counts of withholding information from Congress.
   Hamilton will return for more testimony Thursday. The next
witness will be Adolfo Calero, the political head of the largest
Contra faction, the Nicaraguan Democratic Force.
   During Hamilton's testimony, North's wife, Betsy, sat in the
front row of spectator seats and North wrote on a yellow legal pad.
   Before the jury was admitted to the courtroom, Hamilton was
cautioned not to refer in any way to the public testimony North gave
in 1987 at a televised hearing of the House-Senate committees
looking into the Iran-Contra affair.
   North had immunity for that appearance and his trial must be
conducted entirely without information gleaned from his earlier
testimony. Hamilton's testimony, said U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell ``must be solely on what you know of your own knowledge.''
   Hamilton, whose committee has oversight over the nation's
intelligence agencies _ it hears testimony in a specially secure
room in the Capitol _ said he was not satisfied with the official
assurances that North and other NSC aides were not vioating the
Boland ban on military aid to the Contras.
   Two months after North denied to the committee that he was
violating the Boland amendment, an American C-123 cargo plane
crashed during a supply flight to the Contras in Nicaragua. Hamilton
said he learned about the crash in the press. Of the three men
aboard, one, Eugene Hasenfus, survived and said he had been working
for the CIA.
   ``It caused an enormous stir and concern in Washington and
particularly in Congress,'' the congressman said. ``Some members
perceived it as a possible violation of the Boland Amendment.''
   Hamilton dismissed a suggestion by Brendan V. Sullivan, North's
chief defense lawyer, that the Boland Amendment did not apply to the
National Security Council, a claim North and the White House have
made in the past.
   ``I do not recall anyone saying to me this language does not
apply to the National Security Council,'' Hamilton said. ``The
letter Mr. McFarlane wrote to me specifically said that the language
did apply and I accepted that.''
   But Hamilton conceded that ``I do not read that language as
applying to the president of the United States'' provided the chief
executive does not use the CIA, the Defense Department or other
intelligence agencies to aid the Contras.

<HEAD>FBI Arrests Five in Scheme to Fund Libyan Anti-American Demonstrations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents arrested five people on
Wednesday as part of an investigation into a scheme to divert Libyan
student funds to help pay for anti-American demonstrations in the
United States and conferences of American dissidents in the African
nation.
   Special Agent-In-Charge W. Douglas Gow of the FBI's Washington
field office said the charges against the defendants included
conspiracy, wire fraud, credit card fraud and aiding and abetting.
   Their arrests followed by seven months the arrests of seven
others.
   The five new suspects were involved in the overall scheme, but
FBI spokeswoman Bobbi Wallace said she could not comment further
because another suspect remained at large.
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson, who is handling the case, was
unavailable for comment Wednesday.
   The five were indicted Feb. 14 by a federal grand jury in
Alexandria, Va., the FBI said.
   They were scheduled for arraignment in U.S. District Court in
Alexandria on Friday, Ms. Wallace said.
   They were identified as Abdussalam Deghaies, 32, of Aurora, Ill.;
Issa Hammad, 37, of Manassas, Va.; Jafar Jafari, 37, of Bethesda,
Md.; Omar Al-Madani, 31, who lives in the northern Virginia area;
and Maisoun Benmohmed, 26, who most recently resided in Ottawa,
Canada.
   Mrs. Benmohmed is the wife of Mousa Hawamda, who was arrested in
July along with six members of the Peoples Committee for Libyan
Students for diverting the funds.
   The six committee members pleaded guilty before a federal judge
in October. Five of them were deported after paying $20,000 in
fines. A sixth, Saleh Al-Rajhi is serving a five-year prison term.
   Hawamda fled the United States in September and is a fugitive,
Gow said.
   According to prosecutors, the scheme involved money laundering
and violations of the 1986 Libyan sanctions regulations that
prohibit travel to and transactions with Libya. The original
suspects worked through a Libyan students' organization to recruit
and fund members of selected American groups and to gather
intelligence information. The money allegedly was funneled through a
Washington travel agency operated by Hawamda.
   Al-Rajhi obtained personal data on U.S. government employees to
Libya for ``possible retaliation'' for the 1986 bombing raid on
Libya, authorities said. Hudson has said Hawamda, a Libyan
intelligence operative, had participated in a plot to assassinate a
high-level U.S. official, who administration sources later
identified as former White House aide Oliver L. North. North had
helped organize the raid.
   Deghaies was taken into custody in Chicago, while Hammad was
arrested in Manassas, Va., Jafari in Baltimore, Al-Madani in
Arlington, Va., and Mrs. Benmohmed in Alexandria, Va., the FBI said.

   The Environmental Protection Agency rewarded a
Superfund site-inspection contractor for sub-par work, paid contract
employees to attend conferences, and kept some inspection experts
confined to office work for nearly a year, according to an EPA
inspector general's report obtained Wednesday.
   Some contract employees were so frustrated with their inability
to make on-site inspections that they held mock exercises in a yard
near their office in an effort to maintain proficiency in sampling
hazardous materials, the report said.
   The inspector general also cited an EPA official who was so upset
at paying for contract workers to attend conferences, that he wrote
that the practice ``might not hold up too well under any type of
scrutiny _ congressional, inspector general, or otherwise.''
   The contract cited by the inspector general is between EPA and
NUS Corp. of Gaithersburg, Md. The company was hired to provide
field inspection teams to gather information on hazardous waste
cleanup sites in the agency's regions I through IV, headquartered
respectively in Boston, New York City, Philadelphia and Atlanta.
   The inspector general's report, obtained by The Associated Press,
will be reviewed at a hearing Thursday by the House Post Office and
Civil Service Committee's civil service subcommittee, headed by Rep.
Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn.
   EPA inspector general John C. Martin estimated the five-year
contract will cost $125 million by its finish.
   Another inspector general's report to be reviewed by the
subcommittee criticized the Philadelphia-based Region III management
of EPA's emergency Superfund response program. The program uses
contract employees to respond to environmental emergencies.
   The report found that members of a team of groundwater
hydrologists, toxicologists, chemists, and environmental scientists
often were used as file clerks.
   A geologist who charged 676 hours of his time to administrative
support told the inspector general he used the time to file reports,
answer telephones, update lists and maintain charts.
   The inspector general's reports included comments from the EPA,
which defended its actions.
   Regarding the NUS contract, the agency said the audit covered
only the first 13 months of a five-year contract, and failed to list
``major accomplishments'' of the site inspection program that
occurred near the end of the first year.
   ``The language depicting agency management as deficient is overly
strong and inappropriate,'' the EPA said.
   The EPA also disagreed with the emergency response team report,
emphasizing that maintaining good records is within the contract's
scope of work.
   But the agency said that to avoid the appearance of wasteful
work, the clerical tasks will now be handled by personnel from the
American Association of Retired Persons.
   At NUS, the company's vice president for administration, Donald
Couchman, said, ``We regard that (the report) as an internal review
of EPA management and we don't consider it appropriate comment at
this time.''
   The nation's Superfund program is designed to clean up hazardous
waste sites. More than 30,000 potential sites have been identified,
with 1,175 designated for a national priority cleanup list. Remedial
action has been completed at 48 sites, with some work underway at
more than half the priority sites, according to EPA.
   NUS was hired to provide field inspection teams at the potential
sites, ``the federal government's primary investigative capability
within the Superfund program,'' according to the inspector general's
report. The firm handles regions I through IV while another
contractor provides the same services for regions V through X.
   The contractor provides preliminary assessments, site
inspections, special studies and enforcement support, among other
services.
   The inspector general said Boston-based Region I, in December
1986, caused severe morale problems at NUS by ordering personnel not
to perform traditional site inspection visits, but to gather data
from state agency files _ or from consultants working for the
parties potentially responsible for the hazardous waste.
   Only a month after coming on board, NUS ``employee morale was
affected since almost all ... activity was office work,'' the report
said. ``A series of mock field exercises were conducted outside the
... office to maintain SI (site inspection) expertise.''
   This led to transfers and resignations by 41 percent of the
professional contractor staff in Region I, while ``performance
declined at the time of the resignations and transfers,'' the
inspector general's report said. The order against on-site
inspections lasted for 10 months.
   The report said EPA was ``too lenient'' in evaluating NUS
performance, and in giving the company ``award fees'' based on
performance.
   One unit of contract employees ``received laudatory ratings and
award fees of over $90,000 despite the fact that the FIT (field
inspection team) charged over half its time to support tasks, did
not perform field work, and without the region's knowledge NUS
transferred a large segment of the ... team to work on a state
contract,'' the report said.
   One EPA official had these description of NUS work: ``poorly
written...technically inaccurate...less than satisfactory...from
poor to pathetic.''
   At ``the number one Superfund site in the country,'' the Lipari
Landfill in Pitman, N.J., the EPA paid a nominal award fee even
though an EPA official was sharply critical of the company's work,
the report said.

   In a continuing crackdown on
dissent, authorities on Wednesday convicted and sentenced seven
dissidents to up to a year for their part in a banned demonstration.
   The rulings came one day after playwright Vaclav Havel was
sentenced to nine months in jail for his role in the rallies that
commemorated a student who fatally burned himself to protest the
1968 Soviet-led invasion.
   Authorities on Wednesday also arrested and charged the spokesman
of the Charter 77 independent human rights group with inciting
rebellion and damaging Czechoslovakia's image, a dissident said.
   The presiding judge at the two-day trial sentenced dissidents Ota
Veverka, founder of the recently formed John Lennon Peace Club, to
one year in jail and Jana Petrova to nine months.
   Charter 77 activist David Nemec was given a six-month suspended
sentence and Jana Sternova, also a Charter activist, was given four
months suspended. The others received two-month suspended sentences.
   Nemec, Charter spokesman Alexander Vondra, Petr Placak of the
youth group Czech children and Stanislav Penc of the John Lennon
Peace Club, were fined between $200 and $400.
   Petrova, who had been jailed since Jan. 16, cried when she heard
the sentences.
   Veverka charged that Judge Antonin Tesik influenced witnesses
``by putting words in their mouths.''
   At least 12 witnesses had been heard at the trial, all but one
uniformed or plainclothes police.
   ``We are designated the so-called opposition by the (state)
media. A truly democratic state does not need to be afraid of the
opposition,'' Veverka said.
   Wednesday's convictions came amid a chorus of condemnations
Wednesday from Western and some East bloc countries over Havel's
conviction. The works of Havel, a founder of Charter 77 and
Czechoslovakia's best-known dissident, are banned in his country.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman called
the trial and sentence ``bitter testimony to the lack of respect for
fundamental human rights in Czechoslovakia.''
   In France, President Francois Mitterrand demanded the conviction
be canceled. The French Communist Party called it ``inadmissible''
and demanded Havel's immediate release.
   Britain sought an ``urgent explanation,'' Finnish writers
denounced the verdict and a Polish newspaper said a Warsaw theater
plans to stage two Havel plays.
   Thomas Hradilek, a Charter 77 spokesman, was detained in his
hometown of Lipnik nad Becvou, 180 miles east of Prague, and charged
with inciting rebellion and damaging Czechoslovakia's image abroad,
said Anna Sabatova, a fellow activist.
   She told Western journalists that Hradilek, 43, was interrogated
by a judge in the city of Ostrava for two hours and then released
pending a trial. The offenses could jail him up to five years, she
said.
   The charges were based on two letters Hradilek wrote last month
to Communist Party leader Milos Jakes and President Gustav Husak
protesting the police violence used to break up peaceful gatherings
in Prague in January. Radio stations broadcast the letters into
Czechoslovakia.
   Havel and the seven others were convicted on charges of inciting
people to attend the January rally and of obstructing police
officers by ignoring calls to leave downtown Wenceslas Square.
   The dissidents went there Jan. 16 to lay flowers in memory of Jan
Palach, who burned himself alive 20 years earlier to protest the
death of reform after the Soviet-led 1968 invasion.

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on
Wednesday stepped up his warnings about higher inflation, pointedly
noting a disturbing increase in consumer prices, and saying if price
pressures are not brought under control it will intensify the next
recession.
   Appearing for the second consecutive day before a congressional
committee to explain the Fed's conduct of monetary policy, Greenspan
inserted comments into his prepared testimony to take note of a
report showing that consumer prices took the biggest jump in two
years in January.
   The 0.6 percent increase, which translated into an annual rate of
7.2 percent, reflected widespread increases in a variety of goods
and services.
   Greenspan noted that wholesale prices also jumped sharply in
January and blamed both increases in part on higher wage pressures
in the economy.
   Since March of last year, the Fed has been trying to keep the
economy from overheating by a series of credit-tightening moves
which have pushed short-term interest rates up by about 3 percentage
points.
   Greenspan indicated, as he had on Tuesday before the Senate
Banking Committee, that this credit tightening would continue until
the Fed was satisfied that the economy had slowed enough to lessen
inflationary pressures.
   While critics have charged that the Fed's credit-tightening could
plunge the country into a recession, Greenspan said he saw no
current signs of the imbalances that signaled an imminent downturn.
   Instead, he said that the Fed's efforts to control inflation
should lengthen the expansion and make the next downturn less severe
than it would be if inflation gets out of hand, requiring the type
of credit crunch which brought on the severe 1981-82 recession, the
worst downturn since the Great Depression.
   ``If inflation re-emerges, I think a recession will move up on us
much more quickly than we can imagine and when it occurs it will be
a prolonged one,'' Greenspan said.
   President Bush has made several comments since taking office to
the effect that he believed the central bank was over-emphasizing
inflation worries at the risk of slowing economic growth.
   But on Wednesday, Michael Boskin, Bush's chief economic adviser,
said that the administration believed that inflation developments
needed to be monitored closely with swift action taken if it appears
that inflation is accelerating.
   ``We will not tolerate a rise in inflation,'' Boskin said in an
appearance before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
   However, Boskin stressed that it would be wrong to read too much
into one month's inflation performance.
   Greenspan, for his part, sought to play down any disagreements
between the administration and the central bank, saying as he has in
the past that quick action to reduce the federal budget deficit
would be the best tonic for what ails the economy.
   ``I am cautiously optimistic (about making progress on the
deficit) because there is sufficient awareness of the problems ,''
he said.
   On another topic, Greenspan promised to provide a detailed report
on changes the Fed has made in supplying reserves to financially
troubled savings and loans as part of its effort to deal with the
S&amp;L crisis.
   Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., expressed concern about the credit
arrangements, saying he believed they represented a ``fundamental
change in Fed policy.''
   Greenspan said the central bank was in the process of
constructing ``certain liquidity fallbacks'' as part of the overall
S&amp;L rescue effort announced by the Bush administration recently.
   While all the details have not been worked out, Greenspan said
the measures would not differ markedly from procedures the central
bank has employed in the past to extend credit to financial
institutions in need.

   Heritage Ministries, the evangelical
remains of the collapsed PTL ministry, says it needs half a million
dollars in donations by March 1 to prevent the cable network from
falling apart.
   Heritage Ministries President Sam Johnson appealed to viewers of
``Heritage Ministries Today'' on Monday to preserve the ministry,
which is based at the Christian retreat and theme park known as
Heritage USA.
   He said Heritage Ministries owes $492,600 to its 76 affiliate
stations for air time.
   ``We must have all of this money in by March 1 or we will lose
these stations,' Johnson said.
   Johnson said in an interview that donations have lagged because
of uncertainty over the ministry's future.
   Stephen Mernick, a Toronto businessman who bought Heritage USA
earlier this year in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, has refused to say what
he plans to do with the theme park or what place Heritage Ministries
has in his plans.
   The Internal Revenue Service revoked PTL's tax-exempt status in
1988, citing excessive salaries paid to former PTL leader Jim
Bakker. Heritage Ministries was formed as a non-profit entity
devoted to religious broadcasting.

   A House military panel on Wednesday accused
Pentagon officials of dragging their feet in their new
congressionally mandated role as the nation's leaders in the air and
sea detection of drug trafficking.
   ``This ought to be your No. 1 priority because this is an
emergency, whether you believe it or not,'' said Rep. Nicholas
Mavroules, D-Mass., chairman of the House Armed Services
investigations subcommittee.
   The subcommittee's top Republican, Rep. Larry J. Hopkins of
Kentucky, joined Democrats in the chorus of criticism.
   ``We are dead serious about the Pentagon's active role in the
drug war, even it it means we have to drag you kicking and screaming
every step of the way,'' Hopkins told two Pentagon officials at a
subcommittee hearing.
   But the Defense Department officials rejected the subcommittee's
contention that there was a ``lack of enthusiasm'' over the
anti-drug program at the Pentagon.
   ``There's no doubt that those of us in the Department of Defense
have a role in the war on drugs,'' said Lt. Gen. Stephen G.
Olmstead, deputy assistant secretary for drug policy and
enforcement. ``We're enthused.''
   ``I sense your frustration that we haven't gone faster,'' said
Lt. Gen. Thomas W. Kelly, director for operations of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. ``But we're going to do better ... and be making
significant progress over time.''
   Congress, in the midst of election-year anti-drug fervor that
swept Capitol Hill last year, approved $300 million in military
funds to be devoted exclusively to fighting drug trafficking.
   Lawmakers on Wednesday complained that the Pentagon has been too
slow in filing its plan with Congress on how it wants to spend the
money.
   The deadline was Jan. 1. The plan was not submitted until last
week, and then only after the subcommittee scheduled its hearing,
according to subcommittee aides.
   Subcommittee members also criticized the spending blueprint as
much too vague.
   The Pentagon's proposal includes $40 million for the National
Guard, $60 million for the creation of a secure communications
network, $130 million for additional radar and other hardware, $56
million in operations and maintenance costs and $13 million in
research and development.
   But the plan provides few specifics. When pressed, Olmstead said
the military wanted to spend part of the money on ``three or four''
aerostats or unmanned, radar-equipped blimps that cost $20 million
each, but he did not provide other details.
   Any requests for equipment may prove to be a problem.
Subcommittee aides said lawmakers who drafted the drug interdiction
provision last year specified that the money should be used
exclusively for missions and not for new hardware. One aide, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity, predicted the plan would be
rejected by Congress.
   Under the law, the Pentagon cannot spend any of the $300 million
until Congress approves the military's spending plan within 60 days
after it is submitted. Olmstead promised that the money would begin
to be spent ``within hours'' of congressional approval, with the
National Guard receiving top priority.
   But lawmakers said there was no reason why the Pentagon could not
use other funds to begin beefing up drug interdiction efforts right
away.
   ``You have $300 billion (the overall military budget) to play
with. You can and should use any part of that for this emergency,''
Mavroules said. ``You've got the money. Use it. Use it. ... Let's
push this damn thing.''
   Mavroules vowed to call the defense officials back before the
panel within five weeks to measure their progress.

<HEAD>Walesa Appeals For Unity Among Textile Workers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LODZ, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa appealed for
unity Wednesday when he addressed 7,000 supporters at the union's
first legal rally in this central textile center in seven years.
   Behind the scenes, Walesa launched an attempt to patch up a
conflict that split Lodz Solidarity leaders into rival factions.
   Standing in front of a huge Solidarity sign in a hall under the
grandstands of a football stadium, Walesa spoke for 10 minutes, then
spent more than an hour answering questions about the historic talks
that the opposition began with the government Feb. 6.
   ``If the round table fails we will have great fighting, great
strikes and still bigger inflation,'' he said.
   Although Solidarity has not yet been legalized again, the rally
had permission from local authorities.
   Police posted near the entrances did not interfere as supporters
with Solidarity banners lined up to enter the stadium gates, which
were supervised by volunteers wearing red-and-white union armbands.
   Solidarity, the first independent union movement in the Soviet
bloc, was founded in 1980 and outlawed after the 1981 imposition of
martial law.
   For the past two weeks, Walesa has traveled Poland to explain to
the union's rank-and-file his decision to enter into the discussions
and appealing for time to let the talks produce results.
   ``People are being restrained only because of the round table,''
said Zenon Kuchler, a textile workers and veteran Solidarity
activist. ``If not they would be striking. Everyone has a stomach.
We have to eat.''
   Spectators, who came from the textile mills and clothing
factories scattered throughout the city and suburbs, seemed amazed
at the sight of the cavernous hall being used again for an official
Solidarity meeting.
   ``This is a second coming,'' said Kuchler. ``There was a birth
and now a rebirth.''
   Walesa told the crowd: ``Poland belongs to all of us. The problem
is too serious to try and win something as the party, as the
security forces, as Slowik's (the local Solidarity leader) group or
Walesa's group.''
   He was referring to Lodz Solidarity leader Andrzej Slowik's past
criticism of Walesa's leadership, including a 1987 decision to use
union funds given by the U.S. Congress to fund a health commission
that has purchased ambulances for public use.
   ``Let's do something so that our factories are not political.
They should be places where we come to work hard and where we are
paid well,'' Walesa said. ``We are not more stupid or worse than the
rest of Europe. We are simply badly governed.''
   Gesturing and mixing humor with serious arguments, Walesa charmed
the crowd and was frequently interrupted by applause. One questioner
suggested he run for president.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former chairman of the House intelligence
committee resisted attempts by Oliver L. North's chief lawyer
Wednesday to prove that ``Congress leaked like a sieve'' and
couldn't be trusted with secrets.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., the first prosecution witness against
the fired National Security Council aide, firmly defended the House
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence's record of protecting
some of the nation's most closely guarded secrets.
   ``From 1984, 1985 and 1986 leaks occurred on Capital Hill as a
result of members and staff members who provided information,'' said
North's chief defense attorney Brendan V. Sullivan Jr.
   ``(The late CIA) Director (William) Casey told me he didn't know
a single leak from the House intelligence committee,'' Hamilton
replied. ``I will not deny leaks, but neither can I prove any such
leaks.''
   Sullivan is trying to prove that North, who is charged with lying
to Congress about his role in the Iran-Contra affair, had a
well-founded fear of telling lawmakers the truth about covert
operations.
   In his opening statement Tuesday, Sullivan told jurors that ``it
was the perception of the National Security Council and the
president of the United States that the Congress of the United
States leaked like a sieve.''
   And Sullivan tried to make the same point during lengthy
cross-examination of Hamilton, who chaired the intelligence panel
when it questioned North and then-national security adviser Robert
McFarlane about news reports in 1985 and 1986 about covert U.S.
support of the Nicaraguan Contras despite a congressional ban.
   Hamilton acknowledged that selective leaking of classified
information is a game played by the powerful people in Washington to
influence policy.
   ``Information in this town is power,'' Hamilton said. ``If you
control the flow of information, you can profoundly affect the
public policy process. If information that is classified is released
it can somehow impact on public policy.''
   But Hamilton denied a suggestion by Sullivan that he threatened
in a 1985 letter to then-Secretary of State George Shultz to leak
information about a secret CIA intelligence asset, apparently to
force the intelligence agency to sever its relationship.
   ``I did not threaten to leak anything,'' Hamilton said. ``I was
prepared to follow certain procedures of the House intelligence
committee to try to release information.''
   ``If I had succeeded in that, it would have been an authorized
disclosure and not a leak,'' Hamilton said. ``I did not threaten the
Secretary of State with a leak.''
   The exchange between Sullivan and Hamilton also highlighted the
difficulties posed by airing classified information in a public
trial.
   Sullivan showed Hamilton his letter to Shultz, which the defense
attorney described as discussing a man's ``relationship with the
CIA.''
   ``I don't know if I can comment on the contents of this letter,''
Hamilton said.
   ``You don't have to comment on the man's identity,'' Sullivan
said.
   Hamilton said he took no action after meeting with Shultz. ``The
secretary agreed with my point of view.''
   Sullivan also questioned Hamilton about an instance when the CIA
briefed the House intelligence committee in late 1984 and a report
about the classified information was published in a newspaper ``the
very next day.''
   ``I do not assume for a moment that the leak came from Capitol
Hill,'' Hamilton said. ``There are very experienced people in the
administration who leak information after it comes to the Congress.''

<TEXT>
   A special council of Afghan resistance
leaders was suspended for a second day Wednesday while a committee
hammered out plans for an interim government for Afghanistan.
   The cloistered committee of guerrilla field commanders and
scholars was handed the job of proposing a provisional government
after rebel leaders paralyzed by differences failed to make any
headway, rebel sources said.
   At the United Nations, meanwhile, the Afghan government again
accused Pakistan and the United States of supporting Afghan rebel
raids and asked for U.N. help.
   ``Nobody knows where they (committee members) are. Not even the
leaders,'' said Wahab, a spokesman for the Yunis Khalis faction of
Hezb-e-Islami rebel group. ``They have no one with them, not even
guards.''
   The committee's recommendation will be put to a vote by more than
400 delegates attending the special Afghan council, or ``shura.''
Delays and suspensions have marked the shura since it convened Feb.
10.
   Days of acrimonious debate among the top political leaders of the
seven major guerrilla parties based in Pakistan failed to come up
with a consensus on an interim government.
   ``It stagnated,'' a rebel spokesman said on condition of
anonymity. Delegates to the council have become ``very fed up with
too many delays and too much fuss.''
   Shiite Afghan guerrillas based in Iran, where about 2 million
Afghan war refugees live, have boycotted the shura, alleging unfair
representation.
   The Pakistani-based fighters belong to the Sunni sect of Islam,
as do most of Afghanistan's 15 million people.
   The Pakistan-based Afghan fighters, who are supported by the
United States, are loosely divided into Islamic moderates and
fundamentalists.
   The political maneuvering by Afghan guerrillas, called mujahedeen
or Islamic warriors, assumes the ruling communists in Kabul will be
toppled now that Moscow has ended its military intervention there.
   The guerrillas are fighting to establish an Islamic republic in
Afghanistan, and they have predicted the government will fall within
months or even weeks.
   The last Soviet soldier left Afghanistan on Feb. 15, ending nine
years of Soviet military involvement in the civil war. More than
100,000 Red Army troops were in Afghanistan at the height of Soviet
involvement.
   The Afghan government has claimed Pakistan and the United States
have continued to aid the rebels and have violated terms of the
U.N.-brokered agreement that resulted in the withdrawal of Soviet
troops.
   In New York, Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said in a letter
to Security Council president Jai Pratap Rana of Nepal that ``the
territory of Pakistan is used for the purpose of training,
equipping, financing, and recruitment of mercenaries.
   ``Even today there are 120 training camps of armed extremist
groups in Pakistan,'' said Wakil, adding that the U.N. Good Offices
Mission to Afghanistan and Pakistan had been informed of the problem
38 times.
   In the nine months since the signing of the withdrawal accord, he
said, the rebels have launched 557 armed attacks ``mostly on
civilian targets,'' 403 bomb explosions, and fired 201,000 rockets
and missiles on cities, killing hundreds of people and injuring over
12,200, said Wakil.
   Afghanistan has asked Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
to deploy U.N. peacekeeping troops to prevent cross-border raids and
cut supply lines.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission said
Wednesday that an executive of Toys R Us Inc. agreed to settle civil
insider trading charges by repaying $35,000 in illegal profits and a
$10,000 fine.
   The commission had alleged that James M. Markham, former director
of industrial purchasing for the company, used advance knowledge
that the company's 1986 Christmas sales had jumped 27 percent over
1985.
   Markham purchased Toys R Us stock options before the sales
figures were announced publicly and then sold after the
announcement, the agency alleged in a complaint filed last Sept. 26.
   In addition to the money penalties, Markham, without admitting or
denying his guilt, agreed not to violate securities laws in the
future.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
met with his Israeli counterpart and PLO chief Yasser Arafat on
Wednesday, and he said peace in the Mideast is impossible without
Soviet help and Israeli good will.
   Shevardnadze, in his new role as Middle East matchmaker, held
separate three-hour meetings with Israel's Foreign Minister Moshe
Arens and Arafat, who came to the Soviet Embassy dressed in military
fatigues and packing a pistol.
   Radio Moscow attacked the United States on Wednesday for what it
called ``an attempt to undermine Shevardnadze's peace mission.''
   The radio's Hebrew-language broadcast, monitored in Jerusalem,
said the United States encouraged Arens to adopt a tough stand at
his meeting with Shevardnadze. It also criticized President Bush for
his statement Tuesday that Moscow's role in the Middle East peace
talks should be limited.
   Arafat, in a departure from previous positions, said on Wednesday
that he was willing to hold preliminary talks with Israel before the
convening of a proposed international peace conference.
   ``Do you want us to go today to Moscow? Have you another choice?
If they (Israelis) are ready to go just now, we are ready,'' he said.
   But Arens rejected any meeting with Arafat or the Palestine
Liberation Organization, which Israel regards as terrorist. He said
Jordan or Palestinians from the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip should serve as negotiators.
   Talking to Arafat's organization ``cannot be conducive to the
peace process at all,'' Arens said. ``The PLO is the major obstacle
to peace in the area at the present time.''
   Shevardnadze told reporters that it will ``take some time'' for
Israel to make concessions and accept his proposal for an
international conference.
   ``I think that sooner or later the Israelis will understand that
this (need for flexibility) is imperative because the conference
will also mean guarantees for the security of Israel and that
country needs those guarantees,'' he said.
   Describing his effort as an ``act of creative work,''
Shevardnadze staked out a role for the Soviets in efforts to arrange
peace negotiations. His initiative appeared to challenge the United
States's pre-eminence as the only effective broker of peace in the
Middle East.
   ``Without good will on the part of Israel, there can be no
solution to this conflict ... (but) without the Soviet Union, there
can be no peace process,'' Shevardnadze said.
   At a news conference, Arens indicated Israel was dropping its
condition that the Kremlin renew diplomatic ties before it can
participate in the search for regional peace.
   ``I don't believe restoring diplomatic relations can or should be
a precondition,'' he said.
   Shevardnadze did not announce restoration of diplomatic relations
with Israel as some Israeli newspapers had speculated he would.
   But the countries set up a mechanism for expanded dialogue aimed
at reaching a basis of agreement on an approach to Middle East
peacemaking.
   Despite their pleasant words, however, there were no signs of a
narrowing of differences on the biggest obstacles to bringing the
two sides together: convening an international conference and the
PLO's role in the peace process.
   Arens said hours after returning home from Cairo that his talks
with Shevardnadze created a ``basis of understanding'' despite
differences of opinion on peace in the Middle East.
   Noting that Israel and the Soviet Union agreed to hold further
meetings, he remarked, ``I have an impression this naturally leads
to normalization of relations between the two countries.''
   In Jerusalem, a top PLO official said in a taped message that
Israel should hold direct talks with his group.
   ``The realistic solution is that we live side by side and that we
walk the path of peace,'' Salah Khalaf, the No. 2 man in the PLO,
said in a videotape shown at a peace symposium.
   But Arens repeatedly stressed that Israel should negotiate with
neighboring Arab states, not with the PLO.
   Arens urged that Jordan's King Hussein speak for the
Palestinians. But he said if that's not possible, ``we need to find
interlocutors amongst residents of (the West Bank and Jordan) who
can speak for the population.''
   He said it's up to Arab states in the region to change their
positions and declare their willingness to talk peace. ``We want
peace more than any other party, but it takes two to tango,'' Arens
said.
   An Israeli official said on condition of anonymity that
Shevardnadze's 10-day trip through the region has given momentum to
peace efforts. Nevertheless, he said, ``it's not yet at a gallop.''

   A top PLO official Wednesday urged Israel to
hold direct talks with the organization and said the Palestinian
charter calling for destruction of the Jewish state is open to
discussion.
   Salah Khalaf, the No. 2 man in the Palestine Liberation
Organization, spoke in a videotaped appeal to ``every child in
Israel, every woman and every man.'' The 15-minute video was taped
in Tunisia, smuggled into Israel and screened at a peace symposium
in Jerusalem.
   ``The realistic solution is that we live side by side and that we
walk the path of peace,'' said Khalaf, known by his nom de guerre
Abu Iyad. ``Some people wonder if this coexistence is a first stage.
We answer no. We want a definite settlement.''
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, nine Palestinians were
wounded in clashes with troops, Arab doctors said.
   In the West Bank village of Beit Amin, residents found the body
of Muhammed Abed Suleiman, 25, who was suspected of cooperating with
Israeli authorities. Police said the body was found in a well.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   At least 384 Palestinians and 16 Israelis have been killed since
the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip began in December 1987.
   In what appeared to be a conciliatory gesture, Khalaf diverged
from previous PLO positions and called for direct talks with Israel.
In the past, the PLO has insisted that negotiations be held in the
framework of an international Middle East peace conference.
   ``We believe in direct meetings, we are ready for such meetings,
and we say it publicly. Let the Israelis come and meet us secretly,
openly or in any other way. We are anxious for such a meeting,''
Khalaf said, speaking in Arabic and sitting next to a large
Palestinian flag.
   Reporters were given a written English translation.
   ``What is important for us is that these meetings and contacts
and dialogues take place in advance of the conference so that the
conference itself becomes the form in which to bring our agreement
to fruition,'' he said.
   Liberal and leftist Israeli legislators have met in recent weeks
with Faisal Husseini, a top PLO supporter in Jerusalem, and with PLO
officials abroad.
   Husseini, who also spoke at the symposium, said he and other
Palestinian notables could not serve as a substitute for talks with
the PLO.
   ``We shall continue ... to emphasize the indivisibility of the
Palestinian people as well as the necessity of involving the PLO in
any future settlement,'' he said.
   As Husseini spoke, about 10 Israelis wearing skullcaps, a mark of
observant Jews, interrupted his speech.
   ``Dirty Arab! PLO garbage!'' shouted one before being dragged out
by a policeman. Police later returned to search for bombs.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has rejected the
international conference and any contacts with the PLO, which he
considers a terrorist organization.
   Khalaf responded to Israeli fears the PLO's moderate stance was
just a ploy to trick Israel.
   Calling for a Palestinian state alongside Israel, he said: ``All
other matters are open to discussion. Our covenant and yours can be
discussed.'' He was referring to the Palestinian National Charter,
which calls for the destruction of Israel.
   ``Does any Israeli really believe in his heart that it is
possible to destroy 5 million Palestinians? We have asked a similar
question of ourselves and have concluded that we cannot destroy the
Israelis,'' Khalaf said.
   The videotape was shown at a symposium on the Arab-Israeli
conflict organized by the International Center for Peace in the
Middle East, a private Tel Aviv think tank headed by former Israeli
Foreign Minister Abba Eban.

<HEAD>Forlani Replaces De Mita As Head of Dominant Christian Democratic
Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dominant Christian Democrats on Wednesday elected
Arnaldo Forlani as party secretary, a position often called the most
powerful in Italian politics.
   Forlani replaces Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita as party
secretary, despite De Mita's statements that Forlani is too
conservative for his government.
   In a speech earlier Wednesday, De Mita criticized Forlani's call
for closer links with conservative Roman Catholic groups and said
the party could go into an electoral decline as it did in the
mid-1970s.
   De Mita also said he would remain head of the government only if
he receives backing for his policies aimed at cutting the huge
public deficit.
   Forlani's election marked a return to a more traditional
leadership of the party. De Mita is considered part of the party's
left wing, and Forlani is a moderate.
   The new party secretary promised not to bring down De Mita's
10-month-old government, a coalition that includes the Socialists,
Liberals, Social Democrats and Republicans.
   Forlani, 63, the only candidate for the post, won about 85
percent of the votes cast by more than 1,300 delegates, according to
an announcement by the president of the party congress, Amintore
Fanfani.
   In a speech after his election, Forlani referred to the
controversy over De Mita's being head of both the party and the
government. Some party members felt the arrangement concentrated too
much power in one person's hands.
   ``What then is (the debate about) this dichotomy?'' Forlani asked
a cheering crowd of delegates. ``Is it ... for reasons of jealousy,
a thing of personality, factions or ambition?''
   Turning to De Mita, he said: ``I believe that in our relations
there will never be room for elements of this kind.''
   As secretary of the Christian Democrats, Forlani will direct
party policy and preside over a vast patronage system that includes
top jobs in state industry, banking and radio and television.
   Forlani, 63, was secretary of the party from 1969-73 and later
served eight months as premier, resigning in 1981 when Italy
underwent its worst postwar political scandal.
   He stepped down as premier when two members of his Cabinet were
linked to the Propaganda Due (P-2) Masonic lodge, which was accused
of plotting to overthrow Italy's constitutional system. Forlani was
never accused of membership.
   The Christian Democrats have dominated every government for four
decades.

   Police raided homes in the capital and a
northern city and rounded up nine associates of a suspect in the
Flight 103 bombing and an attack on a Greek cruise ship, authorities
said Wednesday.
   The suspected Swedish-based terrorist cell led by Samir Muhammed
Khadar was linked to the Abu Nidal Palestinian group, said police
spokesman Leif Hallberg.
   Police also displayed an array of weapons they said was
designated for a planned attack in Sweden and were seized in August
near Khadar's home.
   Hallberg told a news conference five people were informed they
were suspects in a criminal investigation ``for planning sabotage.''
The notice is the first step of an arrest procedure.
   ``We wanted them to know that we are keeping our eyes on them and
that we don't tolerate terrorism,'' he said.
   The roundup of suspects followed searches of homes in Stockholm
and Umea, 430 miles north of the capital.
   Hallberg police questioned the group that included men and women
_ Swedish and foreign nationals, including stateless Palestinians.
All were released while the investigation continued, he said.
   The key to the alleged terrorist cell was found after Khadar, a
Palestinian resident of Stockholm posing as a businessman, was
linked to the assault on the Greek cruise ship ``City of Poros''
last July 11 in which nine people died.
   Khadar was identified by Greek police as the planner of the
attack. He was originally reported to have died in a car explosion
in Athens hours before the assault, but police said Wednesday there
were contradictory reports on whether he was still alive.
   Other reports linked Khadar, described as the operations chief of
the Abu Nidal group, to the December explosion of Pan Am Flight 103
over Scotland, which killed 270 people.
   Reporters were shown an arms cache found in August near Khadar's
home in a Stockholm suburb near Arlanda international airport.
   Displayed on a table were four Kalishnikov rifles, eight
ammunition clips, 17 F1 hand grenades and two pistols with silencers.
   Also on display were bags of plastic explosives similar to, but
not identical with, the Semtex explosives investigators believe were
used in the Pan Am bombing.
   ``It is very difficult to get such a large amount of weapons into
the country,'' Hallberg said. ``That is why we're convinced they
were going to be used in an attack within our borders.''
   About 10 other people were brought in for questioning as
witnesses, Halberg said. The national TT news agency said one of
them was Khadar's Finnish-born wife, whose name has not been
released for publication.

   Attorneys for a Lebanese hijacker
who fatally shot a French passenger on an Air Afrique jetliner in
1987 asked for a manslaughter conviction Wednesday, saying he acted
on a reflex.
   The prosecution has asked for a murder conviction against Hussein
Hariri.
   In their final argument, Hariri's two lawyers said the death of
French passenger Xavier Beaulieu ``was an unfortunate accident.''
   Lawyers Gerald Benoit and Eric Hess told the court Hariri's claim
that he shot because he felt Beaulieu was making a threatening move
was not disproved during the three-day trial before five judges.
   Benoit and Hess did not contest the hijacking charge. Like
murder, it carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
   Hariri, who has described himself as a ``soldier of God,'' said a
life term would be ``no problem'' for him. ``I am ready to die for
my religion.''
   The verdict and sentence was to be announced on Friday after a
closed session in Federal Criminal Court.
   Hariri went on trial Monday, 19 months after he hijacked the
DC-10 on a flight from Brazzaville, Congo, to Paris to press demands
for the release of Lebanese and Palestinians held by French, West
German and Israeli authorities.
   He was arrested after he shot Beaulieu when his deadline expired
for refueling the plane at Geneva airport.

<HEAD>Witnesses Cite Federal Legal and Staffing Problems</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal governmental system and staffing
problems were cited by witnesses who testified Wednesday at a Senate
hearing on sexual abuse of children on Indian reservations.
   It's not that child sex abuse is inherently worse among Indians
than elsewhere in society, said Jane Burnley, director of the
Justice Department's office for victims of crime.
   It's that the federal government, which has jurisdiction over
Indian reservations, does not have the mechanisms to respond to the
problems the way states do, she said after she testified before a
special unit of the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs.
   Larry Blythe told the committee that his 2-year-old daughter and
6-year-old son were attacked in 1984 on a Cherokee reservation in
western North Carolina.
   He said defendants were convicted but their life sentences were
overturned on appeal because prosecutors had used a state law to
obtain convictions and state laws do not apply to crimes on Indian
reservations.
   In another trial, he said, prosecutors searched federal statutes
for provisions referring to rape and, while such a crime against
females was covered, similar acts on males were not. In his son's
case, a defendant pleaded guilty last spring to assault causing
bodily harm and got a 10-year sentence, Blythe said.
   He said federal statutes have since been amended for cases such
as those involving his children but that similar loopholes likely
exist for other types of crimes.
   Burnley said that since that federal law was amended in 1986,
many more cases of sex abuse on reservations have come to light but
arranging help for victims has been difficult.
   ``Victims' compensation has grown tremendously as a way of
funding treatment for victims of child abuse, but not in Indian
country,'' she told the committee.
   She said about $2 million for fiscal 1989 was earmarked by the
federal government for such cases among Indians, and Indians are
eligible to apply to state governments for money from their victims'
funds. But she said Indian reservations are usually in remote areas
where communication and transportation are poor, making therapy much
more difficult than elsewhere in society.
   Additionally, the panel was told, the Bureau of Indian Affairs
and the Indian Health Service do not have staff people on the
reservations trained to provide therapy for child sex abuse.
   ``It takes time to teach people what happens to children in these
situations,'' said Penny Coleman, who is with the solicitor's office
of the Interior Department.
   Instead of local police, she said, the FBI investigates the cases
on reservations but FBI agents are not trained specifically for
handling child abuse cases and the agency has comparatively small
staffs for the volume of work in Indian crime.
   Linda Guy, social services specialist in the Bureau of Indian
Affairs, said there have been so many changes in leadership in her
department that it is nearly impossible to handle child sex abuse
cases.
   Robert Delaware, acting head of the bureau's social services
division, told the panel he was the sixth acting chief since August
1986 and that he had little knowledge of the child molestation cases.
   ``I was put there to keep the administrative portion going,''
said Delaware.
   Sen. Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., a member of the investigating unit,
said that ``I don't care if you are acting director for one day or
three months, the impression you leave is that it is not your job _
leave it to someone else.''
   ``I can understand the frustration of the people on the
reservation. We're failing at this,'' Daschle said.

<TEXT>
   Striking nurses and attendants were divided
Wednesday on whether to obey a back-to-work court order, but the
governor said a settlement was near after the two sides negotiated
for the first time in five days.
   Gov. Edward D. DiPrete, who called in the National Guard to care
for the 410 patients at General Hospital when the walkout began
Sunday night, said workers who didn't take up their posts Thursday
morning would be fired.
   A hospital spokesman said for the 3 p.m. shift, 32 of 66
scheduled attendants reported, as did 11 of 14 registered nurses and
8 of 15 licensed practical nurses. A judge had set a 3 p.m.
back-to-work deadline.
   ``People are coming back to work in the spirit of abiding by the
court order,'' said hospital director James P. Benedict.
   After a union meeting Wednesday afternoon, some members walked
out chanting, ``No work. No work.''
   DiPrete, who called both sides together for negotiations at his
office, had said earlier a settlement was possible only if the
workers ended their three-day walkout.
   National Guard troops remained at the hospital Wednesday. Thirty
acute-care patients have been transferred to other facilities,
Benedict said.
   The hospital provides long-term care for the chronically ill. A
major factor leading to the strike was a complaint about low
staffing at the hospital.
   Three hours of talks, the first since negotiations broke off
Friday, ended with some concessions but no agreement, said Gerard P.
Cobleigh an attorney with Local 1350 of the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees. ``There are some numbers they
have agreed on,'' he said.
   DiPrete, who traveled to Washington after the meeting, said if
necessary he would bring both sides back to the table. No new
negotiations were scheduled.
   ``I think the ingredients are right here on the table for a
long-lasting settlement to what has been a long-term problem,''
DiPrete said.
   He refused to give details, but said the state's offer of a
53-cent-an-hour pay raise, rejected ovewhelmingly by union members,
was still available. The increase would have raised attendants
starting salaries from $16,600 to $17,600 and nurses starting wages
from $18,800 to $20,000.
   A hearing before Superior Court Judge Antonio Almeida, who
imposed the back-to-work deadline, was scheduled for Thursday on the
state's request for sanctions. The union estimated possible fines of
$200 per day per person for violating the order.
   After the union meeting, one member who would not give his name
said members had voted to stay off the job. He said union President
Joseph Fargnoli told members a settlement was near ``and in a few
days we'll be going back to work.''
   Henry Griggs, a union spokesman, said no vote had been taken.
   Fargnoli said he ``encouraged them to go back to work'' as
outlined in the court-order. ``I guess they decided on an individual
basis'' whether or not to report to work.
   Roberta Reels, a union member, said she would return to her job.
   ``I do want to honor the picket line. I really do. But the court
has issued an order for us to go back to work and I'm going back to
work.'' she said.
   DiPrete said union members had no choice but to return to work.
``The issue on the table right now is, is the union going to obey
the court order?'' he said.

   _About 300 members of the National Writers Union marched in New

300 people heard writers such as Norman Mailer, Larry McMurtry, Gay
Talese and E.L. Doctorow read from Rushdie's work.
   _ Similar protests were staged in Washington and Boston, with
other rallies or panel discussions of the book planned in Chicago,
San Francisco and Minneapolis.
   _ The B. Dalton bookstore chain said B. Dalton and its Barnes &amp;
Noble subsidiary _ with a total of about 1,250 bookstores across the
country _ were reversing Friday's decision to take ``The Satanic
Verses'' off their shelves and will restock the novel.
   _ The Association of American Publishers, the American
Booksellers Association and the American Library Association took
out a full-page ad in Wednesday's New York Times to declare they
would ensure that copies of ``The Satanic Verses'' remain available
in stores and libraries.

<HEAD>Strikes In Kosovo Continue, Communist Leadership Calls Situation
Critical</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of ethnic Albanians,
including more than 1,000 miners occupying their pits since Monday,
stayed off the job Wednesday in the troubled province of Kosovo,
official media reports said.
   The provincial communist leadership held an urgent session
Wednesday afternoon in the region's capital of Pristina, assessing
the security situation in Kosovo as ``extremely critical.''
   Fearing a possibility of open ethnic clashes between the Albanian
majority and Slav minority in the province, a Communist Party
organization of Yugoslavia's federal institutions issued an appeal
``for the use of primarily political means'' in seeking an urgent
stop to the politically motivated labor unrest.
   Responding to miners' demands, Yugoslav Communist Party chief
Stipe Suvar was likely to tour the tense region to try and defuse
the growing threat of a general strike in the province, Belgrade
television said.
   However, a spokeswoman at the federal party headquarters in
Belgrade declined to specify whether or when Suvar would go to
Kosovo, saying ``everything will be known soon.''
   Belgrade radio estimated that more than 10,000 ethnic Albanians
stopped work Wednesday ``in virtually all municipalities'' of the
economically backward southern Yugoslav province.
   The state Tanjug news agency said later that about 2,000 ethnic
Albanian university students from Pristina organized a protest
meeting in solidarity with the striking workers.
   In 1981, the Pristina university students triggered bloody riots
by demanding more autonomy for the province.
   The miners at the Trepca lead and zinc mine, some 125 miles south
of Belgrade, went on strike on Monday to protest alleged
discrimination by authorities in Yugoslavia's largest republic of
Serbia, of which Kosovo is an administrative part.
   Serbian leaders, aided by an unprecedented campaign in the
republic's press, have asserted that the constitution should be
changed to protect the Slav residents allegedly persecuted by ethnic
Albanians, who make up 85 percent of the province's population.
   Also Wednesday, Tanjug reported that the deputy defense minister
of Yugoslavia's republic of Montenegro was fatally shot Tuesday
night by a police officer in Titograd, the republic's capital.
   The news agency said the police officer was detained, but that
motives for the shooting were under investigation. No details were
available.

<HEAD>Police To Stop Arrests Of Blacks Breaking Segregation Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   Police officers no longer will
arrest non-whites using municipal facilities in violation of local
segregation laws, the state radio reported Wednesday.
   The radio said officers from now on will enforce provisions of
the Separate Amenities Act only if they receive a complaint.
   In such cases, the alleged offender will be asked to provide
information and will be advised that court procedings may ensue, but
will not be held in custody.
   The radio said the new procedures were outlined in a circular
being distributed to officers by police headquarters.
   The Separate Amenities Act, adopted in 1953, empowers local and
provincial officials to segregate public facilities such as parks,
libraries, beaches and sports facilities. Many municipalities have
opened some of these facilities to all races in recent years. Many
other cities and towns maintain segregation.
   The governing National Party has been widely accused of hypocrisy
recently because of its harsh criticism of a resegregation campaign
undertaken in towns where the extreme-right Conservative Party won
in local elections last fall.
   Critics noted that the Conservative Party, by restoring
whites-only status at parks and other facilities, was acting in full
accordance with the Separate Amenities Act. Critics also noted that
public facilities remain segregated in many towns controlled by the
National Party.

   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee and other Democrats on Wednesday challenged President
Bush's assessment that an FBI report on John Tower had ``gunned
down'' allegations against the defense secretary-designate.
   ``I did not agree with the president's assessment of this latest
segment of the FBI report ... The president's entitled to his view
but I think most people reading that would not come to that same
conclusion,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., after he chaired a
three-hour, closed-door session of the committee.
   Nunn said the panel is waiting for more material from the White
House on the embattled nomination as well as a transcript from a
separate investigation that a House subcommittee is conducting into
alleged security lapses in the arms control delegation in Geneva in
1986 while Tower was a member.
   Congressional sources said the subcommittee heard testimony
Wednesday from a former secretary to the arms control delegation who
said that before her subcommittee appearance, she felt she was
intimidated by White House staff.
   Deborah Baker told the panel that on Tuesday she met with White
House staff who stressed that Tower was the president's nominee and
emphasized to her the serious implications of her testimony, said
the sources, who requested anonymity.
   Baker served as secretary to retired Air Force Lt. Col. Robert
Moser, whose request for a Department of Energy security clearance
is part of the subcommittee's inquiry.
   Calls to Baker, who is employed at the White House, were not
immediately returned.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the subcommittee, told
reporters afterward he was ``particularly troubled that there
appears to have been an attempt made to limit the testimony of one
of the witnesses to the committee.''
   The panel also heard testimony Wednesday from Berne Indahl, a
State Department Security officer who had been sent to Geneva in
1986 to investigate allegations of security breaches in the U.S.
delegation.
   An Office of Personnel Management review of Moser's request for
the DOE security clearance included allegations that Tower kept both
his secretaries in Geneva as mistresses, said the sources.
   Indahl on Sunday corroborated the review, including the charges
against Tower, the sources said.
   Nunn said the committee will meet again in executive session
Thursday and decide whether to vote on the nomination. ``It is my
hope and I am sure it is Senator Warner's hope that we can vote
tomorrow afternoon,'' Nunn said.
   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., said he thought Bush was being
``overly generous'' in his characterization of the FBI report.
   And even the ranking Republican on the committee, John Warner of
Virginia, said, ``reasonable men and women could look at these
stated facts and have differences of opinion.''
   At least one Democrat said he will vote against the nomination,
citing his concerns about Tower's drinking habits.
   ``I've made a decision, not withstanding the expertise of John
Tower on defense matters, that after careful consideration it's my
considered judgment that we should look elsewhere for a secretary of
defense,'' Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., told reporters. ``Therefore I
will be voting no.''
   Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., said he was ``deeply skeptical.''
   One day after Bush said the latest FBI report had ``gunned down''
the allegations of Tower's excessive drinking, a parade of committee
Democrats said the lengthy background check left them with lingering
questions about Tower's drinking.
   ``It is not the clean bill of health that one would have us
believe,'' Exon told reporters.
   ``If he (Tower) hadn't touched anything but a couple of glasses
of wine at dinner since 1982 I wouldn't be concerned. There are
parts of the reports that indicate that several people don't think
that's the case,'' Exon said.
   Even Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said Bush ``wasn't
totally accurate'' in his assessment of the FBI report, but Dole
told reporters, ``there's nothing in that report that any
fair-minded person reading it would disqualify Tower.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine said the full
Senate would take up the nomination next week.
   Another Democrat, Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, questioned
anonymous White House officials who have been quoted in published
reports in recent days as saying the report found Tower had a
drinking problem in the 1970s but no longer does.
   ``That is not an accurate description of that file,'' said Levin.
   The Michigan senator said he is waiting for the White House to
respond to additional questions that the committee has submitted
before deciding on the nomination.
   Republicans were generally supportive of the nominee's
confirmation chances after reviewing the 140-page, FBI report on
allegations of Tower's drinking habits, womanizing and business
irregularities.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he saw nothing in the report to
disqualify the former Texas senator from serving as head of the
Pentagon.
   ``We've been at this now for 10 weeks. We're starting to affect
national security. This process could go on forever. We need a
secretary of defense,'' McCain said.
   In statements in the Senate chamber, Dole said there had been ``a
lot of garbage heaped upon this nominee in the last 30 days. Enough
garbage heaped on anybody begins to have an impact after awhile.''
   But Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., said he had reservations about
taking a vote Thursday.
   ``I'd have to say there's a lot of hearsay and innuendo in there
(the FBI's latest background report on Tower's activities), on the
other hand, there are some substantive things that I think need
further evaluation,'' Dixon said.

<HEAD>Snow Falls From New England to Appalachians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cold air in East Coast inland areas turned rain to snow from New
England into the Appalachians as rain Wednesday continued along the
northern and middle Atlantic coast.
   Flooding continued in Kentucky, prompting the governor to ask for
federal disaster area status.
   Frigid air moving south was expected to plunge into the middle
Mississippi Valley and extend into the Gulf Coast states dropping
temperatures to the teens and 20s by Thursday morning. Wind chills
could be as cold as 10 below zero in some parts of the Deep South.
   Snow accumulated from parts of New York state into southern West
Virginia. Snow fell from Vermont through eastern New York state into
northeast Pennsylvania.
   A cold front was draped from the Great Lakes into central Texas.
Snow fell from the eastern Great Lakes region into the Ohio Valley,
with gusty northwest winds increasing snow over north-central and
northeast Ohio, northwest Pennsylvania and western New York state.
   Snow blanketed northern Upper Michigan as colder air blew across
the comparatively warmer waters of Lake Superior. In Michigan, 3 to
6 inches of new snow was reported Wednesday morning in Negaunee, 4
inches at Grand Marais and 5 inches at Marquette.
   Rain spread from western Washington state into the northern half
of California.
   Temperatures were still below zero in the early afternoon across
northeastern North Dakota and northern parts of Minnesota.
Temperatures were in the single digits from North Dakota into Iowa
and the upper Great Lakes.
   Northwest winds of 15 to 25 miles an hour were making the north
central parts of the U.S. colder. Wind chill temperatures were
ranging from 20 to 30 below in many areas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 3 below
zero at Thief River Falls, Minn., to 84 at Oceanside, Calif. The low
in the nation was 20 below at Warroad, Minn.
   The forecast for Thursday called for scattered snow from parts of
the upper Ohio Valley through the central Appalachians into the
middle Atlantic and New England coast. Snow was most likely along
the coasts of southern Virginia and North Carolina. Scattered rain
showers were expected from the northern Pacific Coast region into
the northern Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah and northern
Plateau, with showers expected to be more numerous along the
northern Pacific Coast. Scattered rain or snow showers were expected
across western and north-central Montana.
   High temperatures for much of the nation were expected to be in
the 30s or 40s. Highs in the teens were forecast for the Great Lakes
and the St. Lawrence Valley. Highs in the 20s were expected from the
upper and middle Mississippi Valley deep into the Tennessee Valley
and from the central Appalachians into southern New England. Highs
in the 50s and 60s were forecast from the central Pacific Coast
through much of the Great Basin, the central Intermountain region,
the southern Rockies, and the central and southern High Plains into
the Texas Gulf Coast and across the southern third of the Florida
Peninsula. Highs were forecast in the 70s from Southern California
into the southern Plateau, with 80s over southern Arizona.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department must collect and
publicize data on ``hate crimes'' so attacks against people based on
race, religion, ethnic background and sexual orientation can be
fought more effectively, lawmakers from both parties said Wednesday.
   ``There is prejudice abroad in the land. By ignoring it, we
silently condone it,'' said Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly, D-Conn. ``By
documenting its existence, incident by incident, we are forced to
face its reality, whereby we begin to find a solution.''
   Such hate crimes are now reported to the federal government only
as assaults, arson, vandalism, threats or homicides without details
of their roots in discrimination.
   The House passed the Hate Crime Statistics Act last year, but the
measure died in the Senate.
   Congressional aides said the measure failed last year because
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., wanted to strip out mention of ``sexual
preference'' in the final days of the session. Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill., the bill's Senate author, refused and time ran out.
   But this year, advocates are confident the bill will be enacted.
An aide to Helms said she did not know what position the
conservative senator would take on the legislation, but supporters
said they were pushing the measure early to give themselves enough
time to circumvent any Helms opposition.
   Proponents again vowed not to remove the sexual preference
language from the bill. Maine Attorney General James Tierney warned
that such a move could send a signal of condoning crimes against
homosexuals
   Simon planned to bring the measure up for a vote in the Senate
Judiciary Committee as early as next week, and Mrs. Kennelly
predicted easy passage in the House.
   Baltimore County Police Col. Leonard J. Supenski said the measure
would have a tangible effect on police trying to cope with hate
crimes by pointing out problem areas and trends.
   ``We simply must have reliable information,'' said Supenski.
``Who is involved? What happened? What does it look like? Where is
it happening? How often? To how many victims? By whom? Answers to
these questions are important in assessing the needs of the victim
and the community in order to determine appropriate police
response.''
   ``You can't deal with the problem if you don't know the reality
of the facts,'' added Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.

<HEAD>Charges To Be Dropped Against Those Refusing Military Service</HEAD>

   All Hungarians in jail for refusing
military service on grounds of conscience will be released when a
new ruling on alternative civilian duty takes effect in July,
Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar said Wednesday.
   He told a news conference the records of such prisoners will be
cleared.
   Any criminal proceedings now under way against those who recently
refused military service will be dropped if they agree to perform
civilian or unarmed military service, he added.
   The official MTI news agency quoted Kulcsar as saying 73
Hungarians now are in prison for refusing to do compulsory military
service.
   Ten will be freed by the end of the month and the sentences of
the others will be suspended indefinitely as of March 1, and later
automatically canceled when the new law comes into force, MTI said.
   Hungarian men now have to serve 18 months in the army, but the
civilian service in likely to be double that, officials have said.
   In Hungary, only Jehovah's Witnesses and members of the Church of
Nazarenes and Seventh-day Adventists were exempted from military
service in the past. Other conscientious objectors were imprisoned
for up to five years.

<HEAD>Virginia Becomes First State in South to Ban School Paddlings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Gerald L. Baliles says he will sign a
measure making Virginia the first state in the South to ban school
spankings, but adds that he sometimes used corporal punishment with
his two children.
   ``It was not ruled out, but it was used very rarely,'' Baliles,
who has a son in high school and a daughter in college, said Tuesday
after the Senate voted 22-18 to pass a prohibition on corporal
punishment in public schools.
   The measure was approved by the House of Delegates earlier this
month on an 86-11 vote.
   Only 13 other states, none in the South, have banned school
paddlings.
   Almost every local school board in Virginia has a policy
discouraging the practice, said Rondle E. Edwards, assistant
superintendent of public instruction.
   But Virginia law allowed the ``reasonable'' use of spankings, so
district policies did not legally prohibit teachers and school
officials from the practice, said Del. V. Thomas Forehand Jr.,
sponsor of the ban.
   In the Senate debate, supporters said spanking sends a ``might
makes right'' message to youngsters that violence by authority
figures is acceptable.
   Sen. Mark L. Earley said the Office of Civil Rights reported
11,301 instances of corporal punishment in Virginia schools in 1986,
and 90 percent was directed at children between 5 and 9 years old.
Most of those spanked were minority, handicapped or learning
disabled students, he said.
   Sen. Dudley J. Emick Jr. said youngsters who need spanking should
get it at home, not in school.
   ``Anyone outside the family who does it is in big trouble'' at
the Emick household, he said.
   Opponents said the elimination of corporal punishment sends the
wrong message to parents concerned about increasing discipline
problems in the classroom.
   ``A whack on the wrist or a spank on the rear is a better
alternative than putting a disruptive child on the streets,'' said
Sen. R. Edward Houck, who is an assistant principal.
   The Virginia Education Association, a lobbying organization for
teachers, and the Virginia PTA supported Forehand's bill, as did
associations representing school boards and school administrators.
   The measure allows teachers to use physical contact to maintain
order and control, quell a disturbance, protect themselves or
others, prevent a student from harming himself or seize weapons or
illegal drugs.
   Tommy Neal, a research analyst with the National Conference of
State Legislatures, said the 13 states that have banned corporal
punishment in schools are California, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts,
Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island,
Vermont, Wisconsin, Michigan and Maryland.

   Writers nationwide protested Wednesday against
the Islamic death warrant for author Salman Rushdie, and the
controversy led a book company to reverse its decision to pull the
``The Satanic Verses'' from store shelves.
   The B. Dalton bookstore chain and its subsidiary, Barnes &amp; Noble,
said Wednesday afternoon that they would resume selling the book
because of ``the urging of an overwhelming majority of its store
managers and employees.''
   The announcement came after a day of protest _ including a march
on a B. Dalton and a Barnes &amp; Noble store _ and a reading of
excerpts from the book.
   ``I write controversial books. What publisher is now going to
take chances with a controversial book?'' asked activist Abbie
Hoffman, one of about 300 members of the National Writers Union who
marched in driving rain outside the Iranian Mission to the United
Nations.
   Similar protests were staged in Washington and Boston, with more
rallies or panel discussions of the book planned later in the day in
Chicago, San Francisco, Minneapolis and elsewhere. Wednesday marked
the official American publication date of the book, which was
published last fall in Britain.
   More than 300 people heard some of the nation's most celebrated
writers _ Norman Mailer, Larry McMurtry, Gay Talese and E.L.
Doctorow among them _ read from Rushdie's work.
   Susan Sontag, president of the PEN American Center, the writers
group that sponsored the reading, said the threat against Rushdie
was ``an act of international terrorism against the life of the
mind, against human lives.''
   She read a statement from Rushdie's American-born wife, writer
Marianne Wiggins, who along with her husband is in hiding.
   ``Writers everywhere have been weighed and measured by the edict
from Iran,'' Ms. Wiggins said. ``We are a dangerous breed and always
have been, because words outlive their authors. ... Only fear can
stop a writer's writing. Only fear can stop a book from being sold.''
   Mailer lashed out at booksellers who stopped selling the book.
Such merchants ``seem to have more respect for terrorists than for
culture,'' he said.
   Security guards searched bags of each person attending the
reading. About two dozen Moslems protested across the street, with
signs reading ``Satanic Verses is blasphemous'' and ``Rushdie is a
friend of Satan.''
   Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and others in the Islamic
world consider Rushdie's book blasphemous. They have issued death
threats against the author and his publishers. Rushie is an
Indian-born Moslem living in Britain.
   At the protest outside the Iranian mission, security guards
rebuffed National Writers Union President Alec Dubro trying to
deliver a letter expressing outrage at the death threats.
   The writers then marched to two B. Dalton's and Barnes &amp; Noble's
Fifth Avenue book stores. The two chains had pulled the book from
store shelves in several cities. Waldenbooks, the nation's largest
chain, also withdrew the book from display, but said in a statement
Wednesday, ``Store managers continue selling the books where
available.''
   ``To see book stores caving in like that to demagoguery is
horrifying,'' said author Laura Shapiro.
   Former President Carter joined in the criticism of booksellers
who removed the book from shelves, calling it a ``disgrace.''
   Fundamentalists Anonymous, a group organized to counter the
influence of religious fundamentalists, called for a four-week
boycott of the store chains. The Overseas Press Club of America also
issued a statement condemning the booksellers as having demonstrated
``that terrorism and ignorance do pay.''
   And Carole Simpson Stern, president of the American Association
of University Professors, said booksellers who suspended sales of
the book dishonored themselves.
   ``The proper response to a government that proposes a bounty for
the murder of the author of some book it finds offensive is not to
suppress the book. The proper response is to give that book safe
sanctuary as will make clear the futility of trying to kill ideas by
killing authors and burning their books,'' she said.
   Not all bookstores have followed the lead of the big chains.
   The Association of American Publishers, the American Booksellers
Association and the American Library Association took out a
full-page ad in Wednesday's New York Times to declare that they
would ensure that copies of ``The Satanic Verses'' remain available
in stores and libraries.
   In Washington, about 75 people, including novelist Barbara
Raskin, protested outside the Office of Iranian Interest, Iran's
representative in the nation's capital.
   Leaders of the two groups that organized the protest, Arthur J.
Kropp, president of People for the American Way, and Noelle McAfee
of the National Writers Union, were allowed inside to present a
petition opposing the death threats.
   In both Boston and San Francisco, crowds of about 100 people
picketed peacefully outside B. Dalton outlets.
   Elsewhere in Massachusetts, writers and literary critics planned
a panel discussion Wednesday evening to substitute for a canceled
appearance by Rushdie in Cambridge, and U.S. Rep. Barney Frank said
he would read passages of the novel into the Congressional Record to
show his support for the author.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said Wednesday the mounting Western
condemnation of his order to kill novelist Salman Rushdie has proven
the futility of normalizing relations with the rest of the world.
   Iran's revolutionary patriarch also declared the publication of
Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses'' was a Western plot against Islam.
   In New York, hundreds of writers demonstrated Wednesday against
the order outside the Iranian Mission to the United Nations and at
two bookstores on Fifth Avenue _ B. Dalton's and Barnes &amp; Noble _
that pulled ``The Satanic Verses'' from their shelves on Friday.
Rallies were scheduled in Boston, Washington, Chicago, Minneapolis
and San Francisco to coincide with the book's official U.S.
publication date.
   Later, a B. Dalton spokesman who asked not to be identified
announced that B. Dalton and its Barnes &amp; Noble subsidiary _ with
about 1,250 bookstores across the country _ were reversing
themselves and will restock the novel.
   ``At the urging of an overwhelming majority of its store managers
and employees ... and in light of the statement yesterday by the
President of the United States, (we) ... will resume sales of `The
Satanic Verses,''' he said.
   President Bush said Tuesday he supported West European withdrawal
of ambassadors from Iran. On Wednesday Bush said he found Khomeini's
death threat against Rushdie ``deeply offensive to the norms of
civilized behavior.''
   Authors in Finland and the Netherlands also condemned Khomeini's
order Wednesday. Publishers in France, West Germany, Greece and
Turkey have canceled plans to publish the book, which has been
banned as blasphemous to Islam by at least seven countries,
including India, Pakistan and Egypt.
   Libya said Wednesday it has taken measures to confront
publication of the novel. The dispatch by the official JANA agency,
monitored in Rome, did not elaborate.
   A conference of Moslem theologians in Saudi Arabia said the
author, who was born in India into a Moslem family, should stand
trial in an Islamic country for his novel, the Saudi newspaper
Al-Sharq Al-Awsata reported Wednesday.
   Rushdie's wife, American novelist Marianne Wiggins, canceled a
U.S. book-promotion tour to stay with her husband, who is in hiding
in Britain. She had planned the tour to promote ``John Dollar,'' her
latest novel.
   West Germany called on the U.N. Security Council to take up the
Iranian threats.
   West German TV said the Cabinet also discussed ``further
measures'' against Iran. ``If the mullahs adhere to the execution
order against (Rushdie), then economic sanctions will no longer be
ruled out,'' the ZDF network reported.
   West Germany, Iran's biggest trading partner, already has decided
to remove its ambassador from Tehran as part of an action by the 12
European Economic Community countries.
   Khomeini said economic sanctions will not change his stance.
   The West's stinging reaction has exposed its ``true nature and
longstanding hostility ... so that we can come out of this state of
naivety,'' Tehran radio quoted Khomeini as saying.
   ``God wanted it to happen in this way so that we may no longer
think in simplistic ways,'' he was quoted by the radio report, which
was monitored in Cyprus.
   Branding critics ``misled liberals,'' he denounced ``those who
still believe that we should revise our policy and diplomatic
principles ... that our blunt slogans and war caused the West and
the East to become pessimistic about us ... and if we react
realistically they would reciprocate humanely and would respect
Moslems.''
   The statement underlined indications that Tehran's actions in the
Rushdie controversy stemmed as much from the power struggle in the
Iranian hierarchy than from religious outrage.
   Hardliners argue such changes will threaten the 10-year-old
Islamic republic and bring moral decay.
   ``As long as I am alive I will not let the state fall into the
hands of liberals ... As long as I am alive I will never stop
cutting off the hands of agents of the United States and the
U.S.S.R.,'' he was quoted as saying.
   ``At the beginning of the revolution we gave posts to people who
were not totally with us in ideology and the bitter results of that
are plainly evident.''
   He mentioned no names in the statement, but it appeared directed
at several Iranian leaders who have in recent weeks called for a
relaxation of political, social and religious restrictions following
the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the war against Iraq.
   President Ali Khamenei had said Friday that Khomeini's order
might be rescinded if Rushdie apologized, but on Wednesday in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia, he said ``there is no solution.''
   ``An arrow has been shot and it is unerringly aimed at its
target. There is nothing more that can be done,'' he said.
   Iranian clerics have offered $5.2 million for Rushdie's murder.
The writer issued an apology Saturday, but Khomeini rejected it.
   Many Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' is sacrilegious because
it casts doubt on central tenets of the Islamic faith. The book, for
example, portrays the prophet Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and
suggests he wrote the Koran, the holy book of Islam, rather than
receiving it from God.
   In other related developments:
   _ Anti-terrorist police on Wednesday guarded a plant in Cles,
Italy, where ``The Satanic Verses'' was being printed, and Italians
placed hundreds of orders for it as a publisher prepared to release
a second run of the controversial book.
   _ A firebomb was thrown at the dormitory of London's main mosque
early Wednesday, and a newspaper reported that detectives were
investigating whether it was prompted by anti-Moslem backlash to the
Rushdie affair. Police refused comment, and no one was injured in
the blaze, which caused minor damage.
   _ Iran on Wednesday called home its ambassador from Stockholm in
apparent reciprocation for Sweden's withdrawal of its envoy to
Tehran. Sweden said it will continue to look after British interests
in Iran. Britain called home all its embassy staff to protest calls
for the death of Rushdie, a British citizen.

<HEAD>Round-Table On Lebanon Said To Consider Beirut Demilitarized Zone</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Arab League mediation committee opened a meeting
Wednesday with six Lebanese religious leaders in an effort to unify
a country wracked by civil war and a government split between
Moslems and Christians.
   Informed sources said the clerics were being sounded out on a
proposed demilitarized zone comprising greater Beirut, the capital.
   ``The Lebanese should take advantage of the present spirit of
international detente,'' said Sheik Sabah Ahmad Jaber, Kuwaiti
foreign minister and chairman of the Arab League's six-member
committee.
   ``The failure to exploit the committee's good offices will mean
missing an opportunity that may not return,'' he said.
   The Arab League mediation effort aims to prevent formal partition
of Lebanon into sectarian cantons after more than 13 years of civil
war. The strife between Moslems and Christians has been compounded
by Parliament's failure to elect a successor to outgoing Christian
President Amin Gemayel five months ago.
   Before stepping down Sept. 22, Gemayel appointed Michael Aoun, a
Christian, to head an interim Cabinet. Syrian-backed Moslem leaders
rejected the appointment and backed Salim Hoss, who formed a rival
Moslem Cabinet.
   Aoun's appointment, the Moslems charged, violated an unwritten
national covenant dating to Lebanon's independence from France in
1943. The covenant says the premiership is given to the Sunni Moslem
sect, the presidency to the Maronite Christians and the position of
Parliament speaker to a Shiite Moslem.
   The informed sources at Wednesday's meeting, who spoke on
condition they not be identified, said the panel was also sounding
out the clerics on electing a president and a Parliament speaker as
well as on the appointment of a prime minister.
   In addition, the sources said the mediation committee is
proposing to modify an ``Arab deterrent force'' to include troops
from the six countries represented in the panel in addition to the
Syrian forces in Lebanon.
   Arab League members on the panel also included Secretary-General
Chedli Klibi of Tunisia and the foreign ministers of Tunisia, Sudan,
Algeria, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.
   The religious leaders attending are Maronite patriarch Nasrallah
Sfeir; Greek Catholic patriarch Maximos Hakim; acting leader of the
Supreme Shiite Moslem Council, Sheik Mehdi Shamseddin; and Sunni
Moslem Grand Mufti, Sheik Hassan Khaled.
   Also attending were the supreme religious judge of the Druse
community, Sheik Mursel Nasr and the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of
Antioch, Ignatius Hazim.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, has an estimated 40,000
forces there under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate issued in
1976.
   The League panel last month met with Lebanon's three senior
political leaders: Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem,
army commander Gen. Michel Aoun, a Maronite Christian who heads a
rival Christian Cabinet, and Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a
Shiite Moslem.
   Sabah said the committee's next round of talks would be held with
leaders of the rival Lebanese militias.
   The leaders of Lebanon's Christian and Moslem factions were due
to hold talks with the committee on Monday, but the session was
delayed while Sabah held private talks with each leader in an effort
to prepare the way for agreement.

<HEAD>Commission Says Senior Officials Shouldn't Get Honoraria</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to CORRECT spelling of evil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Members of President Bush's ethics commission
agreed Wednesday that senior officials of all three branches of
government should be barred from accepting fees for speeches and
articles whether or not they get a pay raise.
   ``The evil of honoraria is so great _ from the appearance of a
conflict of interest,'' said former Attorney General Griffin Bell,
in proposing a ban on the fees. ``People wonder who's paying all
these honoraria. It undermines confidence in government.''
   All eight members agreed, though there was debate over whether to
couple this idea with a recommendation for a pay raise.
   The tentative conclusions were reached at the third meeting of
the eight-member panel appointed to recommend ways to stiffen and
standardize federal ethics laws and rules. Its final recommendations
are due on Bush's desk March 9.
   Under enormous public pressure, Congress recently voted down 50
percent pay raises for the top officials throughout the government,
even though that recommendation from the Quadrennial Commission and
Presidents Reagan and Bush was coupled with a proposal that members
of Congress stop taking honoraria.
   The only former congressman on the ethics panel, onetime New
Mexico Republican Sen. Harrison Schmitt, said, ``As a practical
matter there is no way to divorce these issues from the salary
issue. A salary recommendation has been made, but as we can all see
it can't be implemented.''
   But Judy Bello, general counsel of the U.S. Special Trade
Representative, replied, ``I support the pay raise, but I support
this ban without the pay raise.''
   Former White House counsel Lloyd Cutler, who chaired the
Quadrennial Commission, agreed. ``Honoraria cannot be justified by
saying that salaries are too low. Salaries should be dealt with
directly.''
   Chairman Malcolm R. Wilkey, a former federal appellate judge,
summed up the consensus: ``The practice of honoraria has become
evil. We'll let others deal with pay questions.''
   If adopted, this would produce a larger impact on Congress than
the executive branch. Executive branch rules already prohibit any
honoraria for speeches or articles written on the area of one's
federal job, so very few are offered.
   Members of Congress may accept honoraria for speaking or writing
on their congressional duties. The House allows members to receive
honoraria up to 30 percent of salary and the Senate up to 40 percent
of salary. Both houses are paid $89,500 a year.
   Among judges, Wilkey said, ``I've observed excessive teaching and
writing basically to earn income.''
   The panel also agreed that top officials in all three branches of
government should have their outside income limited to 15 percent of
their salary. Again, this is the current eecutive branch standard
and is lower than that used in Congress.
   But Bush has said he wants his top officials to receive no
outside income. The panel endorsed letting presidents set higher
standards administratively ``to set an ethical tone,'' as Wilkey put
it.
   They also agreed that membership on the board of directors of
commercial entities ought to be prohibited for top officials in
government.
   Bell pointed out this would overturn a rule allowing judge's
remain on the board of family-owned companies.
   Wilkey replied, ``I think it has to be changed. A man just has to
decide whether he wants to be a judge or not. That rule fit the
ethos of 25 years ago but not now.''
   They agreed that membership by top officials on nonprofit boards
should be subject to approval by ethics officers.
   On accepting lunches from businessmen and journalists, they
agreed the government should have a uniform standard, and they
preferred the executive branch standard, which basically bars them,
to that of Congress where the Senate allows meals under $50 and the
House meals under $35.
   They also agreed that so-called double dipping laws limiting the
pension that retired military officers can receive if they take
civilian federal jobs ought to be revised so that military pensions
were allowed to be taken in full if vested just like corporate
pensions.
   On financial disclosure, the panel agreed to recommend more
reporting than now required for liabilities and for large assets and
income. They suggested an end to the exemptions for reporting
mortgages on one's home and for debts to relatives.
   They also agreed that asset disclosure should say whether the
value was over $1 million as opposed to over $250,000 now and that
income disclosure should say whether its was more than $250,000 as
opposed to more than $100,000, which is the top disclosure category
now.
   At the same time, they recommended that the smaller categories on
disclosure forms be consolidated somewhat to reduce the risk of
error and the burden of getting appraisals of non-marketable assets.
As Wilkey put this questions, ``What's the effective difference
whether an asset is worth $5,000 to $15,000 or worth $15,000 to
$50,000? Why not just $5,000 to $50,000?''

   A petition filed with the state Supreme
Court on Wednesday seeks the overturn of two city bans on
semiautomatic weapons.
   The request for a temporary stay of a Los Angeles ordinance due
to take effect Thursday and a similar measure already in effect in
Stockton claimed the regulations are pre-empted by state law.
   Documents filed with the Supreme Court on behalf of several
individuals contended California already has a regulatory program
governing possession of firearms. They also cited a 1982 opinion by
the state attorney general that cities cannot prohibit possession of
handguns within their municipal areas.
   By overruling the Los Angeles and Stockton measures, the petition
said the court would ``ensure the effectiveness'' of the state's
firearms laws against ``unwarranted interference.''
   The bans on possession of military style assault rifles were
approved in the wake of the slaying of five children last month by
Partick E. Purdy, who came to a Stockton elementary school and
opened fire with an AK-47 semiautomatic weapon.

   A retarded man mistakenly held for 32 years
in a mental hospital gained new freedoms Wednesday with a judge's
ruling that he can live in a less-restrictive setting if he wears an
electronic monitoring device.
   The monitor was among the conditions imposed on Bernt Murphy, 51,
who was committed to the state hospital near Provo following the
1957 rape and beating of a 5-year-old girl, for which Murphy was
found incompetent to stand trial.
   In June, the Utah Supreme Court ruled that Murphy must be freed
from the hospital because he was mistakenly ruled insane by a judge
in 1957.
   On Wednesday, District Judge Pat Brian ordered Murphy transferred
to Opportunity House, on the edge of the hospital property. He will
be allowed to come and go during the day but must report back each
night.
   ``This deals with the most complex and social problems this court
or any other district court has ever resolved,'' the judge said.
   The judge ruled that in addition to wearing the electronic
monitoring device, Murphy must return to court every four months for
review.
   ``The record should be clear. The court will not tolerate
violations of the order. Even a child knows the difference between
right and wrong,'' Brian warned. ``The court and the community wish
you well and have every right to expect you'll succeed.''
   Murphy, estimated to have the mental capacity of an 8-year-old,
cried when he heard the decision.
   His attorney, Brooke Wells, said Murphy feared that the
electronic monitoring device would somehow shock him but calmed down
after being assured it would not.
   Murphy, his arm around Wells' shoulders, said, ``I feel great and
I'm glad to have it over with. ... I'll show them. I want a job in
security.''
   At Opportunity House, where he had been tentatively housed prior
to the hearing Wednesday, Murphy has been in charge of janitorial
duties and a fish pond.
   ``We're not unhappy with this. We always knew it would be a
transitional thing, and this is just fine,'' Wells said. ``We're
going to see how that works. This is an important, happy day.''
   Wells said Murphy has always wanted to prove he can do things on
his own, and the ruling gives him new freedom.
   During questioning about the child rape, Murphy, then 19,
admitted to the 1955 slaying of a 23-year-old mentally retarded
woman he had known at the Utah State Training School for the
developmentally disabled in American Fork.
   Murphy later denied killing the woman and was found incompetent
to stand trial. On the rape charge, he was declared insane. In 1972,
doctors at the state hospital said Murphy had been cured of his
insanity, and he was tried on the rape charge and found innocent by
reason of mental illness. The slaying was never solved.
   In 1985, an appeal was filed on Murphy's behalf, questioning his
continued confinement at the hospital.
   Wells had argued that Murphy could do well in a group home with
other retarded adults. But state officials believed he still is
capable of violent behavior.
   Deputy Salt Lake County Attorney Bud Ellett said the Supreme
Court's ruling and Brian's actions Wednesday had resolved the Murphy
case, and there are no plans to pursue any charges.
   ``He's not insane, but is retarded,'' he said.

<HEAD>Opposition Split Over Government Offer of Talks on Electoral Reforms</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Ortega meeting opposition. No

<TEXT>
   Opposition parties met Wednesday with
President Daniel Ortega to discuss electoral reforms, and at least
one party suggested Ortega not run for re-election.
   The Conservative Democratic Party, which has the largest
opposition representation in the National Assembly with 14 deputies,
also asked for absentee balloting for Nicaraguans abroad, many of
whom live in Miami.
   In a communique issued after party officials met with Ortega, the
Conservative Democrats said, ``Although re-election is not
forbidden, it would be convenient for the peaceful coexistence in
the nation that (Ortega) not present his candidacy for re-election.''
   Ortega has hinted he will run again and seems the likeliest
choice, although the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front has
not announced an official candidate.
   In spurning early elections, the Conservative Democrats echoed
the view of other parties that they don't have enough time to
organize effectively for elections in February 1990.
   The party also demanded that no state property or employee be
used for political propaganda; that the military be denied the vote;
and that the number of regional vote-counting centers be cut in
half, apparently to allow all parties to have observers at all such
centers.
   A faction of the Liberal party met with Ortega on Wednesday.
   This Central American country of about 3 million people has 15
legal political parties. Seven of them are represented in the
National Assembly.
   The 14 opposition parties met Tuesday night to discuss Ortega's
offer of renewing talks on reforming electoral laws.
   ``Most of us decided not to go, but we left the option open for
whoever wants to attend independently,'' Alan Zambrana of the
Communist Party said Wednesday. His party declined Ortega's
invitation.
   Ortega has said negotiations would center on the agreement he and
the presidents of El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala
signed on Feb. 14 in El Salvador.
   It calls for Nicaragua to institute democratic reforms, such as
giving equal air time to the opposition; including opposition
representatives in the Supreme Electoral Council, and allowing
international observers to oversee general elections, which Ortega
moved up by 10 months, to Feb. 25, 1990.
   ``Any dialogue must be with the entire civic opposition,''
Zambrana, a deputy in the assembly, said. ``We're not going to lend
ourselves to the Sandinistas' game of trying to divide us by
inviting us to bilateral talks.''
   It does not appear that the Sandinistas would have to make much
of an effort to divide the opposition. Already existing are three
Liberal parties; four Social-Christian parties and three
Conservative parties.
   The Communist Party and the Marxist-Leninist Popular Action
Movement split the far left. Each has two deputies in the assembly.
   Mauricio Diaz, president of the left-of-center Social-Christian
Popular Party, initially said his party would talk with Ortega, then
said a decision had not been made. His party has the second-largest
opposition representation in the legislature, with six deputies.
   Eric Ramirez's Social-Christian Party is sending two delegates to
meet with Ortega, a party official said.

<HEAD>Japanese Airline Announces Multibillion-Dollar Airliner Purchase</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs lead graf to CORRECT total value of sale of $4.75 billion</HEAD>

   All Nippon Airways of Japan announced Wenesday
an order for 20 Boeing 747-400s and said negotiations are underway
for Boeing 767s that could raise the total value of the two deals to
as much as $4.75 billion.
   The sale of 747-400s for delivery beginning in 1992 came despite
Boeing's inability to meet delivery deadlines for the sophisticated
jumbo jets to other airlines. Company Chairman F. A. Shrontz said
the Seattle-based company hopes to get back on schedule with a new
delivery plan.
   The order, added to six 747-400s ANA ordered in October, makes
the airline the biggest purchaser of the new model. Japan Air Lines
ordered 20 of the same model in July 1987. British Airways ordered
19 in August 1986.
   Only one 747-400 has been delivered, to Northwest Airlines. The
new model takes a smaller crew, has a new wing design, saves fuel,
can fly further and can be equipped to carry more passengers than
the 747-300. Boeing now has 192 orders for the new plane.
   All Nippon, Japan's largest airline with 102 planes, announced at
a news conference with Boeing officials that it will pay $3.15
billion for the 747s, including spare parts and General Electric
engines. The planes are to be used on both domestic and new,
expanding international routes with delivery of from four to six a
year between 1992 and 1996.
   The 747 sale alone is equal to 5.7 percent of last year's U.S.
trade deficit with Japan, ANA officials noted.
   Sigeya Goto, ANA executive vice president, said the company is
also negotiating with Boeing to purchase 15 to 20 Boeing 767s at a
cost of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion. They would also be delivered
beginning in 1992.
   ANA flies more than 27 million passengers a year on 66 domestic
routes and on international flights to Washington, D.C.; Los
Angeles; Beijing and Dalian, China; Guam, Sydney, Seoul and Hong
Kong.
   Next year, Goto said, the airline plans to add flights from Tokyo
to Bangkok, Vienna, Moscow, London and Stockholm. ANA became an
international airline in 1986 with flights to Guam. He said the
airline expects a 30 percent increase in international passengers
this year.
   ``Thanks to the healthy yen, Japanese citizens are travelling the
world and consumer demand is increasing steadily,'' he said.
   Goto said the airline is satisfied Boeing has implemented new
manufacturing procedures that would overcome problems the
manufacturer has had with miswiring in new aircraft. He said that
with the big order, double the number of Japanese technicians would
be sent and their stays at Boeing plants would be longer in
overseeing construction of planes ordered by the airlines.
   The Boeing chairman, in a speech before the International
Aviation Club after the announcement, said delays in 747-400
deliveries ``have been a disappointment to us.''
   Shrontz said other purchasers are being advised of a new delivery
schedule.
   ``We looked at the situation, the magnitude of the work that was
ahead of us and decided we would sacrifice schedule to make sure
that the product that comes out is a quality and defect-free
product,'' Shrontz said.
   He said that recent incidents of cross-wiring found in the
emergency systems of several Boeing airliners were not due to the
push to produce.
   ``I will not say it was isolated because we had more than one. I
will say it tended to be random and I don't think it reflects on any
quality deterioration. It's clear we did not do an adequate job'' in
preventing defects in the system, Shrontz said.
   He said the problem has been fixed, ``and I don't think you'll
see any more of that.''
   The 747-400 includes a stretched upper deck similar to the one on
the 747-300, but can be equipped to carry up to 509 passengers,
instead of 496 for the earlier model. Alternatively, it can be
outfitted with extra fuel capacity to give it a range of about 8,000
miles, which is 1,000 miles further.
   The new model also have six-foot ``winglets'' that improve fuel
economy but extend upward at the ends of the wing so the airliners
do not take up any more space.

   Services were held Wednesday for John Robert Shaw,
the professional wrestler known as Ivan the Terrible, who grappled
with circus bears and boisterous crowds during the 1950s and 1960s.
   Shaw died Sunday at age 65 after a long illness.
   He got his start wrestling and boxing in carnivals while he was a
Dallas police officer.
   After quitting his policeman's job, Shaw began wrestling full
time as one of the Kowalski Brothers and starred on early TV
wresting shows as Ivan Bulba, the Mad Russian from Minsk.
   His wife, Margie, said Shaw was far from the frightful thug he
portrayed in the ring. She said he had an off-stage personality more
teddy bear than grizzly.
   ``He was just the opposite once he got outside of the ring,'' she
said in a telephone interview from her home Wednesday. ``He enjoyed
jokes, playing pranks on his friends.''
   Shaw retired from the ring to become a rancher in the 1960s, but
poor health forced him out of agriculture and he began training
young wrestlers. He was ill for the past six years after suffering a
stroke that damaged his heart, said a daughter, Betty Seaman of
Dallas.
   ``I used to watch him on TV before we met,'' Mrs. Shaw said. ``I
liked watching him because he was so rough and tough. He had a long
beard and hair all over.''
   What caught her eye when they met, however, was the small scars
that seemed to cover his 6-foot-2, 265-pound frame.
   ``So I asked him what happened, and he told me they were from
people in the stands scratching him with their soda bottle caps as
he went by because he had been so mean inside the ring,'' she said.
   ``Ivan _ that's what we called him _ really knew how to work up
the crowd. They'd get furious,'' she said.
   Mrs. Shaw said her husband loved playing practical jokes.
   ``One of his fellow wrestlers drank too much one night,'' she
said, ``and Ivan filled the man's room with dozens of pigeons and
closed the door.''
   Shaw was known also for his generosity _ he donated some proceeds
from his matches to Indian tribes. Sioux tribal members from South
Dakota dubbed him Standing Bear, and he was taken into the Moses
Grey Buffalo Clan.
   ``He looked like a bear and wrestled bears, so they called him
`Bear,''' his daughter said.

<HEAD>Six Bodies Recovered, Search Continues For Others</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HURLBURT FIELD, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescuers recovered the remains of six
people by Wednesday and planned to continue their search for the
bodies of two others presumed dead in the crash of an Air Force
cargo jet, officials said.
   An Air Force safety team arrived to investigate why the C-141B
Starlifter from Norton Air Force Base, Calif., went down during a
violent thunderstorm Monday night.
   The recovered remains are being taken to the regional military
hospital at neighboring Eglin Air Force Base for identification,
said Hurlburt spokeswoman Victoria Hanson.
   The crash site, which was in the Florida Panhandle about four
miles north of Hurlburt, could be reached only on foot or by
helicopter pending construction of a half-mile dirt road through a
heavily wooded swamp inhabited by poisonous snakes and alligators.
   An Air Force civil engineering battalion had not completed the
road, including construction of a bridge over a creek, before the
six bodies were recovered, Ms. Hanson said. The road work was to
continue Thursday.
   Two of the bodies were found inside the plane and four outside
near the nose area, said Col. Howard Oakes, Eglin's base commander.
He said four bodies were found Tuesday and two Wednesday.
   The front of the plane was severely burned and damaged. The rear
half was charred but intact. Searchers had not been through all
portions of the plane Wednesday and were to continue their work at
dawn, officials said.
   While investigators were not yet ready to speculate on what
caused the crash, attention has centered on the weather.
   The four-engine transport had departed Monday morning from Norton
and stopped in Colorado Springs, Colo., en route to Hurlburt where
it was to pick up 50 passengers and their baggage for a flight to
Howard Air Base in Panama.
   The C-141 had a crew of seven and had picked up a passenger,
retired Air Force Capt. John G. Galvin of Jacksonville, during a
refueling stop in Colorado Springs, Ms. Hanson said.
   Staff Sgt. Robert Pfenning, a Norton spokesman, identified the
crew members as Capt. Mark J. Chambers, 30; Capt. John F. Young, 30;
Master Sgt. Robert E. Wright Jr., 37; Tech. Sgt. Ronald D. Grubbs,
29; Staff Sgt. Karl M. Kohler, 32; Airman 1st Class Scott Craig, 22,
and Staff Sgt. John W. Remerscheid, 33. No hometowns were available.

<HEAD>Boy Who Received Rare Double Transplant Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 16-month-old Florida boy who received a
rare liver and small intestine transplant nearly two months ago died
Wednesday.
   Calvin Oliveira's death was caused by a respiratory system
failure, said Dr. Munci Kalayoglu, who performed the liver-intestine
transplant. The boy died at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and
Clinics.
   Calvin's transplanted liver began to fail Tuesday, according to
hospital spokesman Greer Sutter.
   Calvin received national attention after his father, Brazilian
immigrant Carlos Oliveira, made a tearful plea to Florida Gov. Bob
Martinez for help in saving the boy's life. Money for the down
payment on the operation was quickly raised from private and
corporate donors.
   Calvin was the only child of Oliveira and his wife, Adriana, who
worked opposite shifts in restaurants so that they could care for
the baby.
   Although Calvin continued to receive blood and oxygen, Kalayoglu
and the child's parents had agreed Monday that there would be no
attempt to resuscitate Calvin if his heart stopped. The Oliveiras
referred all questions to Kalayoglu, a hospital spokesman said.
   The liver and intestinal transplant was necessary because the boy
was born with use of only 5 percent of his intestine. The
intravenous feeding that kept him alive caused his liver to
deteriorate so severely by December that his only hope was the
experimental operation, Kalayoglu said. The operation took place
Dec. 31.
   Kalayoglu had expected Calvin to be able to use the new intestine
and go off intravenous feeding a few weeks after the operation. But
a mysterious lung ailment developed.
   Family friend Marge Gallece said the long hospitalization made it
likely that Calvin's bills would add up to more than $300,000. Less
than $200,000 has been raised.

   Edward Vrdolyak, a feisty former alderman who once
headed the local Democratic Party, declared Wednesday that he would
seek the Republican nomination for mayor next week through a
write-in campaign.
   ``I'll be your candidate,'' Vrdolyak told 400 supporters who
chanted ``Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.''
   Vrdolyak joined the GOP in 1987, soon after he unsuccessfully
sought the mayor's chair as a third-party candidate. In November he
lost a countywide race for clerk of courts.
   ``I can honestly tell you that I never thought that I would be a
speaker in front of an audience concerning a political topic
again,'' he told the crowd gathered at a restaurant Wednesday night.
``I came out of the November election soundly defeated. I was good
and tired. I was soured on politics.''
   Vrdolyak said he decided to run because many of his admirers told
him ``you are the reason we came to the Republican Party.''
   He pulled out an oversized ballot and showed the crowd how to
write in his name when they go to the polls during next Tuesday's
primary.
   ``If everybody in this room goes out and gets 20 votes it's a
landslide,'' Vrdolyak said.
   Some observers said Vrdolyak, win or lose, could have a
significant impact on the mayoral race.
   ``Nobody ever pays much attention to the Republican Party here,''
said Mike Royko, the Pulitzer Prize-winning syndicated columnist
based at the Chicago Tribune. ``But he could sure create problems,
the most obvious effect of which would be to siphon off white votes
from Rich Daley.''
   Both Democratic front-runner Richard M. Daley, Cook County
state's attorney and son of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, and his
primary challenger, Mayor Eugene Sawyer, said Wednesday that
Vrdolyak would have minimal impact on their contest.
   GOP front-runner Dr. Herbert Sohn, who was endorsed by the city's
Republican Party, is taking the offensive, addressing the issue at
local appearances in these terms: ``Eddie, on Feb. 28th, I'm going
to beat you. ... No one's going to push me around.''
   Some political observers are not so sure, especially in a primary
where the GOP winner traditionally needs fewer than 10,000 votes.
   ``Eddie's like a cat with nine lives,'' said Tom Roesser, a
political analyst who is active in corporate and Republican circles,
``but he hasn't demonstrated an ability to win outside his own
ward.''
   Vrdolyak, 51, earned a reputation as a maverick during the tenure
of the elder Daley, when he led a rebellious group of aldermen who
opposed the administration and came to be known as the Young Turks.
   He held prominent positions in the administrations of subsequent
mayors Michael Bilandic and Jane Byrne.
   In 1983, he led a bloc of white aldermen in a series of
acrimonious City Council battles against the late Harold Washington,
elected earlier that year as the city's first black mayor.
   Vrdolyak, who served 18 years as alderman of the 10th Ward, a
gritty, predominantly white working-class enclave on the southeast
side, left the post in 1987 to make a third-party mayoral run
against Washington.
   Washington won re-election with 53 percent to Vrdolyak's 42
percent. GOP standard-bearer Don Haider, trying to break a
Democratic grip on City Hall dating back to 1931, wound up with 4
percent.
   Washington died in November 1987. An April 4 special general
election will follow Tuesday's party primaries. Voters are choosing
a mayor to serve the last two years of Washington's term.
   Soon after his loss to Washington, Vrdolyak switched to the
Republican Party. He was defeated by Democrat Aurelia Pucinski in
last fall's Cook County clerk race, and returned to private law
practice.

   Authorities charged at least 37 people and a
corporation Wednesday with laundering more than $1 billion in
Colombian cocaine profits through jewelry merchants in Los Angeles,
Texas, Florida and New York.
   The 13-month drug money-laundering investigation was the biggest
of its kind ever undertaken by the government, Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in a statement
released in Washington.
   Many of those taken into custody were brought to court for bail
hearings Wednesday in connection with the case, described in U.S.
District Court documents as a four-year conspiracy involving
wholesale jewelry dealers.
   The documents said that in addition to arrests on the
money-laundering charges, the investigation resulted in the seizure
of 640 pounds of cocaine.
   Code-named Polar Cap, the investigation uncovered an operation
that in the past two years alone laundered an estimated minimum of
$1 billion, the Justice and Treasury departments said.
   ``Unlike recent major money-laundering investigations, Polar Cap
did not involve the undercover infiltration of the organization by
law enforcement,'' Brady said in the statement.
   ``Instead, by following the flow of funds through various
currency transactions reports and electronic and physical
surveillance, the combined law enforcement team was able to uncover
the sophisticated techniques used to conceal the source and
disposition of these illegal proceeds.''
   The investigation involved the Drug Enforcement Administration,
the FBI, the Customs Service, the Internal Revenue Service, U.S.
attorneys offices in several cities and numerous state and local law
enforcement agencies, the statement said.
   The various agencies involved on Wednesday arrested 37 people and
searched 85 locations in Los Angeles, New York and Miami, the
statement said. More arrests and searches were expected.
   The documents showed much wiretapping was used along with close
surveillance of the defendants. In the complaints, authorities
portrayed the money-laundering operation as highly sophisticated,
using pagers, mobile telephones and coded language.
   The federal court documents, totaling over 400 pages, said the
conspiracy involved bank accounts in California, New York, Panama,
Uruguay and elsewhere.
   Authorities alleged the defendants, many of them family groups,
packed their cocaine proceeds in boxes and shipped them between the
jewelry stores in New York, Houston and Los Angeles.
   The documents said that at the Ropex Corp. in Los Angeles, money
was tallied by high-speed counting machines, packed in catalog cases
and other packages and then transported by armored car to Los
Angeles banks for deposit.
   From the banks, the millions were transferred by wire to various
locations around the world and were ultimately used to pay narcotics
suppliers in Colombia and elsewhere, the documents said.
   They said the owners of Ropex-LA created false invoices for the
sales of huge quantities of gold to fictitious persons in order to
explain the source of the currency. In addition, Ropex and another
company, Ronel Refining, allegedly engaged in transfers of large
amounts of gold between themselves in order to reflect new sales.
   Ronel, based in Hollywood, Fla., was the corporation accused in
the complaints.
   A call to Ropex was answered by a man who refused to comment and
hung up.
   The government was tipped off to the alleged scheme in early
1988, the documents said, when the Wells Fargo Bank in Los Angeles
reported that one company had deposited $25 million in a three-month
period.
   One of those charged was Nazareth Andonian, owner of Andonian
Brothers Manufacturing Co. Inc., which does business as Nazareth
Jewelers in downtown Los Angeles. The complaint states Andonian also
has a store in New York and does business internationally under
other names.
   The complaint alleges the Andonian firm alone laundered over $500
million since 1986. A telephone call to the Los Angeles store was
answered by a woman who refused comment.

   President Bush set out today on a hectic
five-day trip to Japan, China and South Korea to demonstrate that
``the United States is an Asian power.''
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, departed before sunrise in a light
drizzle aboard Air Force One, heading for a refueling stop in
Anchorage, Alaska, en route to Tokyo. In Anchorage, Bush will give a
speech outlining themes of his trip.
   The overseas trip comes with Bush barely in office for a month,
and with most aspects of the new administration's foreign policy
still officially under review.
   But Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser,
on Tuesday disputed suggestions that Bush is making the journey
before he has a cohesive foreign policy in place.
   ``The president is not trying to make quick headlines,''
Scowcroft said. He said Bush wants to develop policies that ``will
aid us in where we think we'd like to be at the end of the century.''

   A health research group today asked the Food

painful medical procedures are given lollipops laced with a powerful
narcotic.
   Public Citizen Health Research Group, in a letter to the FDA,
said the drug in the form of a lollipop sends children `'a dangerous
message'' about drugs being candy and is of ``dubious clinical need
or safety.''
   However, both the FDA and the Anesta Corp. of Salt Lake City,
established by anesthesiologists and the University of Utah to test
and develop an oral form of the drug, defended the study and
discounted the potential for drug abuse.
   The narcotic, fentanyl, has been approved by the FDA as an
injectable drug. In the FDA-approved study, it is mixed with
sweeteners, mounted on a stick like a lollipop and administered
orally to children before they are given general anesthesia or
undergo a painful diagnostic procedure.

   A federal recommendation to give chemotherapy to
all victims of early breast cancer will mean needlessly treating
65,000 women at a cost of $338 million to improve the outlook for
just 5,000 others, a new analysis concludes.
   Until recently, drug and hormone therapy were given exclusively
to women whose tumors had spread to their lymph nodes. Those whose
cancer had not visibly progressed beyond their breasts were treated
with surgery and radiation therapy alone.
   However, four new studies suggest that even those with early
breast cancer could benefit from chemotherapy drug treatment. The
therapy somewhat improves their chances of remaining cancer-free
during the years immediately after their surgery, although there is
no evidence that they ultimately live any longer.
   Three of the studies, conducted in the United States, were the
basis of an unusual recommendation last May by the National Cancer
Institute. Without revealing details of the studies, the agency sent
letters to cancer specialists suggesting that they give drug therapy
to all breast cancer patients.

   A month after offering to participate in
national elections, El Salvador's leftist rebels say they will lay
down their weapons if the armed forces are cut and next month's
presidential vote is postponed.
   Leaders of the country's political parties, to whom the rebel
Farabundo Marti Liberation Front made the offer on Tuesday, said it
seemed to reflect a sincere guerrilla desire for peace.
   They said in a resolution that they would today meet with
President Jose Napoleon Duarte and ask him to immediately engage the
rebels in talks.
   The rebel and political leaders had met for two days _ the first
such meeting of its kind _ in an effort to end a nine-year civil war
that has claimed 70,000 lives, most of them civilian.

   In the largest heroin raid in U.S. history,
police and federal agents tracked $1 billion worth of the drug from
Southeast Asia to two homes in New York City, where it was hidden
inside hundreds of tires.
   The 800-pound seizure made the notorious ``French Connection''
case seem modest by comparison, and showcased the rise of Asian drug
smugglers, authorities said Tuesday.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney said ``Operation White Mare'' and
some other recent cases provide ``clear proof that the Chinese are
responsible for 70 to 80 percent of the heroin that is smuggled into
New York.''
   Since 1985, the supply of heroin from Asia has increased, and
Asian drug rings have supplanted heroin operations run by
traditional American organized crime families, the prosecutor said
at a news conference held to announce the seizure.

<HEAD>No Trench Coat For Thriller Writer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES O. CLIFFORD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PORTOLA VALLEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fans of author Alfred Coppel might
be surprised to know he seldom wears a trench coat, de rigueur for
spies and reporters, his favorite subjects.
   An even bigger surprise is that he has no practical experience in
either intelligence work or journalism.
   ``However, I did major in journalism at Stanford (University) and
worked in public relations after World War II,'' said the author of
26 books, including ``Show Me a Hero,'' ``Thirty Four East'' and his
latest, ``A Land of Mirrors'' (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $18.95).
   As for espionage, a suggestion that he's been on the
cloak-and-dagger circuit only brings a laugh from Coppel, 67, who
lives in a two-story rustic home in this exclusive San Francisco
Peninsula community.
   The writer admits that in the 1950s, when caught in a ``fit of
patriotism,'' he offered his services to the CIA. He was interviewed
but was never contacted again.
   Coppel, a P-38 pilot in World War II, wondered why.
   ``In 1961, when a brigade of poor sods stormed ashore at the Bay
of Pigs without air cover, I stopped asking,'' he said.
   The alleged CIA connection has haunted Coppel and, he said, he
has paid a price.
   ``For the last 30 years the critical establishment has become
less part of the literary world than of the world of media and
politics,'' he said. A conservative writer, according to Coppel, is
not likely to be invited to appear on network television shows.
   The literary establishment suffers from what Coppel calls
``slavish liberalism.''
   For that matter, so do most reporters, he says. Just read ``A
Land of Mirrors,'' a tight suspense yarn about the rivalry between
CIA and KGB agents that is rooted in the Vietnam War and serves as
an indictment of the mass media.
   The villain is Jean Thierry, a French journalist who uses his job
as a cover for his KGB work. The book is filled with lines such as
these:
   _ ``The press hated the whole war effort. ... ''
   _ ``The army was more the enemy than the Vietcong. ... ''
   _ ``The media people made a separate peace with the enemy after
the Tet offensive.''
   Don't get the impression that the CIA is always sitting pretty.
One of the most repulsive characters in ``A Land of Mirrors'' is CIA
agent Charlie Blaisdell.
   Because his books carry a tone of authority, it's easy to see how
some people might surmise that Coppel's been a spy. But it's just a
matter of keeping your eyes and ears open, claims the author who
said many of his characters are drawn from life.
   ``My aging gone-to-fat CIA field man is a synthesis of
intelligence officers I have known,'' he said.
   Some characters are pure fiction, of course. But Coppel had many
``macho'' chapters in his life that could have provided him with
such people, who would include his son, a Green Beret in Vietnam.
   Not only was he a fighter pilot, Coppel still holds a commercial
pilot's license. He's also been a race car driver and sail boat
racer.
   But a spy is not on his resume.

   The young man in the film looks down at
his feet uncomfortably and says: ``I don't like to mention that my
brother died in the war in Africa. It makes people uncomfortable.
They look at the floor.''
   In the turbulent years following the April 1974 coup that ended
Portugal's 48-year dictatorship and brought independence to its five
African colonies, the memory of the country's African wars remained
submerged.
   But with the arrival of relative political stability, the
Portuguese, who sent a generation of young men to fight in Angola,
Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau, are beginning to take a look at the
war years through the arts.
   Joao Botelho, a 38-year-old graphic illustrator and independent
filmmaker, was among the first to broach the subject in his 1985
film ``Um Adeus Portugues'' (``A Portuguese Farewell'').
   Told in the present through a series of flashbacks by the brother
and wife of a Portuguese soldier who died in Angola in 1975, the
film is full of longing and sadness. ``To die in Africa, and then
for nothing,'' says the dead man's father.
   In another scene, a soldier reads by lamplight from a geography
book to a group of African children: ``the Minho, the Douro, the
Tajo,'' he drones, citing the names of Portuguese rivers they will
never see.
   In the six months since its publication by the Circulo de
Leitores and Dom Quixote Press, the two-volume ``Os Anos da Guerra''
(``The War Years'') has sold more than 50,000 copies. This is a
record for a collection of essays, poetry, short stores and excerpts
from novels in a country of 10 million inhabitants with the highest
rate of illiteracy in western Europe.
   Half a dozen publishers turned down the book, saying there was no
interest in the subject in Portugal.
   For editors Joao de Melo, 40, and Joaquim Viera, 38, the period
covered in their book marked a time when their generation faced
obligatory conscription or emigration to avoid the draft.
   Melo, a novelist who spent three years as a medic in Angola,
refers to Portugal's ``own little Vietnam'' and says the generation
that succeeded his doesn't know ``how lucky they are not to have
been under constant threat of mobilization.''
   A Defense Ministry report, the first on the 1961-75 conflict,
says 8,920 Portuguese soldiers died and another 23,233 were wounded
during the wars for independence in three of Portugal's five African
colonies. The island colonies of Cape Verde and Sao Tome y Principe
achieved independence peacefully.
   There are no accurate figures available on the number of Africans
dead and wounded in the conflicts.
   ``Some will say we took a long time to come out with these
facts,'' wrote Gen. Manuel Freire Themuda Barata in his introduction
to the report published six months ago. ``Others will say it comes
much too soon.''
   Retired Gen. Altino Pinto Magalhes, who served two separate
stints in Angola and now heads the Portuguese War Veterans League,
says it is a good thing to talk about the war.
   ``In the beginning the Portuguese supported the war out of a
sense of solidarity and patriotism,'' Magalhes said. ``But it was
long, 14 years, and then there was no victory.''
   The league has 53,000 members of the estimated 800,000 Portuguese
who saw service in the African wars.
   Maj. Manuel Lopes Dias, a spokesman for the Association of Armed
Forces Disabled (ADFA), says the organizations's 12,000 members
suffer from both physical and pyschological problems, some of them
just recently manifest, and many of them aggravated by a painfully
slow and complicated Portuguese bureaucracy.
   Although ``war novels'' came out during the period that began
Feb. 4, 1961, when African guerrillas attacked a Portuguese police
station in Luanda, Angola, the theme of the effect of the colonial
wars on Portuguese society is relatively recent.
   Lidia Jorge, one of Portugal's leading novelists, says she wrote
``A costa dos murmurios'' (``The Coast of Whispers'') because
``those who don't want to confront the pain of this memory created a
super-reality, a greater temporal distance that the time that has
actually passed.'' The novel is set in wartime Mozambique.
   Fernando da Costa's play, ``Um jeep de segunda mao'' (``A
Second-Hand Jeep'') was one of the first public presentations to
deal with the wars.
   Portuguese state televison (RTP) has never devoted a documentary
to the subject but did air an hour-long dramatization late last year
of Luis Felipe Costa's short story, ``Era uma vez um alferez''
(``Once There Was a Corporal'') _ the story of an engineer drafted
into the war who steps on what he believes is a land mine, is
exhorted by his captain to be courageous and dies of a heart attack
from the stress. The ``mine'' turns out to be a metal clicker.

   Equipped with protective lighting
filters, a library basement at Wittenberg University is home to one
of the nation's largest collections of the religious works of Martin
Luther, leader of the 16th century Protestant Reformation.
   Some materials in the collection are more than 500 years old.
Some of the documents are kept in a safe. All require special
permission to study.
   ``It's a real treasure for scholars,'' said Regina Entorf,
special collections librarian. ``So many of these things have been
lost through fire and flood and bombing.''
   Ms. Entorf said the materials are invaluable to scholars who need
to trace exact wording of important documents in the intellectual
history of the Western world.
   ``A surprising number of people know that these are here,'' she
said. ``And we do have people come and study them from time to time.
A lot of these things are irreplaceable.''
   The collection boasts about 350 books, pamphlets and prints,
including all of Luther's collected works from the 16th century. The
oldest is a Bible printed in 1478, only 23 years after the Gutenberg
Bible was printed on the world's first printing press.
   ``It's a very beautiful thing,'' said Ms. Entorf. ``It's in the
safe, as is a letter that Luther wrote.'' The letter is to a
parishoner and answers questions about eating meat sacrificed to
idols.
   She said the Wittenberg collection is one of the largest in the
country. Other Luther collections include those at the Folger
Shakespeare Library in Washington and at Stanford University.
   Some of the Wittenberg works were part of the original collection
at the school, which was founded in 1845.
   ``Of course, the people are heavily Lutheran,'' said Ms. Entorf.
``People just kept these books forever. And we've had a lot of gifts
through the years. We've educated pastors from the very beginning of
our history.''
   Wittenberg takes its name from the University of Wittenberg
founded in Germany in 1502 by Frederick the Wise, a lifelong
protector of Luther against the pope.
   Luther was a professor of theology at the University of
Wittenberg. He was the leader of the Reformation, a religious
movement that led to a schism in the Catholic Church and the birth
of Protestantism. His translation of the Bible into German helped
create the modern German language.
   The Wittenberg collection boasts numerous pamphlets written by
Luther.
   ``This is what really spread the Reformation throughout Europe
because these would go to pastors in small towns throughout
Europe,'' she said. ``And that's the way the word would spread.''
   Along with the 1478 Bible and the original Luther letter, the
collection includes a Bible Luther translated from Latin into German
in 1555, a Luther translation of the communion service from Latin
into German and a 1570 church order prescribed by the government on
how church services were to be conducted.
   Ms. Entorf said the Wittenberg collection has held up well, with
the bindings being virtually indestructible if they are treated
properly.
   ``The content is interesting because the original text is here,
and the scholars can trace that back,'' she said. ``But the other
thing that you have is a lot of history in the bindings. So these
are interesting as artifacts to scholars as well as intellectual
content.''
   Printing in the 16th century was often done on linen, which lasts
indefinitely. Covers of the books are made of embossed pigskin or of
parchment, which is dried lambskin.
   Ms. Entorf said fluorescent lighting in the library basement has
special shields to reduce the ultraviolet light and protect the
works.
   ``We don't have climate control yet, but we're working on it,''
she said. ``You need to keep it (the humidity) down in the summer
and up in the winter. It has to be level.''

   The Ecumenical Ministry Minority Bail Bond Fund,
which since its establishment in 1977 has posted $791,000 in bond
for 44 defendants, says that for the first time it has had to
forfeit an accused man's bail money.
   The fund's policy board said the forfeiture was ordered in the
case of Eddie Hatcher, a North Carolina Lumbee Indian, who failed to
appear in court Jan. 17, but that he reportedly intends to repay his
$25,000 bond.
   ``We have always recognized the risk involved, and will continue
to assume the risk of faith on behalf of racial minority persons to
guarantee them their constitutional right to bail,'' the board said.
   Hatcher was charged in a 1988 incident in which he and another
Indian held hostages for 10 hours in a Lumberton, N.C., newspaper
office in demanding a state investigation into alleged official
corruption and racial injustice.

   Speakers at a conference on spirituality and

   Most of the seven presenters told the conference, sponsored by
the United Church of Christ social-concerns agency, that they grew
up in a deeply evangelical faith, which now motivates their
involvement in social causes.
   The Rev. Felix Carrion, pastor of Spanish Evangelical Church in

because he ``knelt ever day for an hour in prayer.''
   ``My God was personal,'' he said, but he found that personal
piety alone wasn't adequate to confront the world. He said, ``if we
really believe in the Lord's prayer that `thy will be done on earth

God'' and work to make life better for the weak and hurting.

   For her latest movie, CBS' ``Naked Lie,''
Victoria Principal's two roles as actress and executive producer
were occasionally at odds.
   ``There were some things that the executive producer wanted the
actress to do, but as the actress I didn't want to do them,'' she
said. ``Generally, the executive producer won.
   ``One day, for instance, the actress had a scene early in the
morning and wanted to take the rest of the day off. But the
executive producer felt it was more economical to have her do one
more scene at the end of the day. Another time, the producer felt
that since the wardrobe had been made for the actress she should pay
half price to take it home. But the actress wanted it and we gave it
to her.''
   She laughed and said, ``I'm sure the supermarket tabloids will
take that and the headlines will read: `Victoria Principal Has Fight
With Self.' For the last few days a tabloid reporter's been parked
outside my house. They've gone through my trash and they've been
following me everywhere I go.''
   ``Naked Lie'' will be telecast this Sunday by CBS. Principal
stars as a prosecuting attorney whose affair with a judge, played by
James Farentino, threatens to destroy her career when they're both
assigned to a politically explosive case.
   The movie is her second since she left ``Dallas'' after nine
years on the hit prime-time soap opera. She had starred as Pamela
Barnes Ewing.
   When she read the screenplay of ``Naked Lie,'' she said, ``I
liked the story. I was drawn to its concept, which was new to TV at
the time. It had aspects of `Suspect' and `Jagged Edge.' I felt it
could be a very tight, suspenseful, romantic mystery. Our story is
very tight, which is unusual for TV. Usually, you can drive a truck
through the plot. You don't have to suspend belief.''
   Principal is developing other projects and has deals with NBC and
ABC. She is in no hurry to do another series.
   ``I own several properties that I think would make good series,''
she said. ``But I want to have deep artistic involvement. It would
have to be done by my company. Doing a series is a grueling
lifestyle. In order to live that lifestyle it would have to be a
project I believe in. It would have to be one from the heart.
   ``The best of all worlds in terms of lifestyle is a half-hour
comedy. I do have one I like. But for one-hour dramas, outside of
`Murder, She Wrote,' there are no shows starring women. First, you
entertain, but if I did a series I'd want to do something
meaningful. If you can touch someone and cause them to think, you've
reached TV's potential. Even if you disturb or upset someone _ as
long as you make the audience feel something.''
   At one point in her career she quit acting and became a talent
agent. She began acting again when she needed money to pay for
tuition for law school. She became so successful the second time she
kept at it. It wasn't long before she was cast in ``Dallas,'' her
only series.
   ``Dallas'' was originally conceived as a kind of ``Romeo and
Juliet'' meets ``Giant'' for her and Patrick Duffy. But Larry
Hagman, as J.R. Ewing, became the major focus of the show.
   Was she bothered at losing the lead role?
   ``Whatever concern I had about that was offset by its success,''
she answered. ``Would I rather be a leading performer in a show that
runs five weeks or part of an ensemble that runs for many years. The
latter, of course. Because of my years as an agent I have an ability
to stand back and look at the project as a whole.''
   Principal said there is no chance she will return to ``Dallas.''
   ``They might bring Pam back, but it won't be me,'' she said.
``They've asked me back, but that's not where my life is going. I
don't want to live my life in reverse. I'm not bitter and have no
ill feelings. I chose to leave simply because it was in my own best
interests.''

<HEAD>Reagan Turned Up Heat; Bush Tries Warmth</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan used to say that when Congress
wouldn't see the light, he'd make them feel the heat. President Bush
is trying for warmth instead.
   Bush's first stint of domestic campaigning as president is, like
Reagan's eight years ago, tied tightly to the budget and the
economy, but with a difference. Reagan sought to pressure a
half-Democratic Congress. It's solidly Democratic now, Senate and
House, and the kind of coalition of Republicans and conservative
Democrats that delivered for Reagan is not in sight for Bush.
   Reagan was campaigning for a right turn from the policies of a
Democratic administration. His first post-inaugural address was a
nationally televised speech from the White House; in it he declared
``we're in the worst economic mess since the Depression.''
   Bush is arguing his case for modest change with praise, not
blame, for what went before. ``We've made tremendous progress and I
mean to build on that progress,'' he said in the first of three
speeches on the budget last week.
   The president said his purpose was ``to talk as directly as
possible to the American people,'' in speeches to a business group
in Manchester, N.H., legislators in South Carolina and college
students in St. Louis.
   Reagan's first term economic wares were a 25-percent, 3-year tax
cut, drastic reductions in domestic spending, and sharp increases
for defense.
   Bush wants a flexible freeze on domestic spending, with increases
for selected social programs, to be balanced by cuts in others _
although his budget doesn't say which ones, and neither does he.
   He'd like a tax cut, on capital gains, but nothing so dramatic as
Reagan's income tax reduction. And Bush's chances of getting the
reduction he wants are slim to none in the Democratic House.
   As part of his road show, Bush told each audience about the items
for which he wants to increase federal spending _ the environment,
space, the war on drugs, education, child care, help for the
homeless.
   That's starting to irk Democrats who say he's taking credit for
projected increases without saying what he wants cut to pay for it.
   In those speeches, Bush also pressed his call for a line-item
veto, so he and future presidents can veto specific spending items
without rejecting an entire appropriations bill. That isn't likely
to happen, either, because Congress would lose its ability to force
spending upon an administration.
   The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, James Sasser of
Tennessee, remarked that Bush wants line-item veto but won't but
won't deliver a line-item budget.
   There are other signs of strain, but both the administration and
Congress still are talking about cooperation rather than
confrontation. Bush stressed that in his speeches, making
bipartisanship a refrain at each stop.
   It was a theme at the Capitol, too. ``You get an A for mood,''
Sen. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana told budget director Richard G.
Darman.
   Reagan talked of bipartisanship, too, during his early days in
the White House. ``I extend my hand in cooperation and I believe we
can go forward in a bipartisan manner,'' he said in one of his
initial messages to Congress.
   But he had a special definition. Reagan bipartisanship meant
Republicans plus conservative Democrats who were predisposed to go
along with the White House. With that coalition vote, he got his
spending and tax cuts and House Democratic leaders couldn't do a
thing about it. The Senate was in Republican hands.
   Bush has neither of those advantages. His bipartisanship means
working with the Democratic leaders of House and Senate, not
confronting them.
   Pressing his program, Reagan told a Republican crowd ``the battle
is on, lines are being drawn.'' Reagan said that when necessary,
he'd go over the heads of Congress, directly to the voters, to get
support for his proposals.
   Bush doesn't talk that way. He says voters want an end to
political bickering. His White House spokesman said the budget
speeches were intended to underscore those aims, not to pressure
Congress.
   ``It's an attempt to explain to the American people that he
intends to work with the Congress,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the
White House press secretary. ``All the indications we have are that
the Congress intends to work with us ... to try to solve this
problem.''

<HEAD>Despite Inflation Talk, Gold Not Shining</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All the talk about reviving inflation these days
has provided little comfort to advocates of gold investments.
   The price of gold, which is supposed to thrive on inflationary
worries, has instead been slumping, hitting 2{-year lows this month.
   Hovering lately around $380 an ounce, it is down more than 20
percent from its early-1988 high near $500 and off about 7 percent
since just the beginning of 1989.
   Even news of a bigger-than-expected 1 percent jump in the
producer price index of finished goods for January failed to stir
gold out of its doldrums.
   In a strange twist, analysts attribute the weakness in gold to
the alarms sounded about the dangers of inflation by such prominent
observers as Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
   ``Recent upward pressure on the producer price index points to a
modest pickup in the inflation rate during coming months,'' say
economists at Merrill Lynch.
   ``But the behavior of gold prices underlines confidence in the
inflation-fighting resolve of the Fed and a belief that inflation
pressures will ultimately be contained.''
   Or as the Value Line Survey put it in its latest quarterly
appraisal of gold-mining stocks, ``the continued assertions by
Chairman Greenspan that inflation in the United States is too high
sends a bearish signal to gold markets.
   ``The concomitant increase in short-term interest rates that the
Fed has orchestrated serves, meanwhile, to shore up the dollar,
placing further downward pressure on bullion quotations.''
   Yields at or near 9 percent on virtually riskless investments
such as Treasury bills represent stiff competition for gold
investments, which pay no current return in most of their various
forms.
   Dividend yields in the 9 percent range can be had in the American
depositary receipts of some South African mining companies, which
trade like stocks and can be obtained through just about any broker.
   However, these stocks are under a cloud because of controversy
over South Africa's political policies, in particular apartheid.
   On top of that, high interest rates increase the cost of carrying
gold on credit, as many dealers and other businesses do.
   Other, separate reasons have been advanced for gold's slump. The
Soviet Union, which ranks behind only South Africa among the biggest
gold producers of the world, is said to have been selling gold in
large amounts lately.
   Reports from gold-trading centers in Europe suggest that these
sales are likely to continue as the Soviets seek to upgrade their
industrial production base under the restructuring effort known as
perestroika.
   All in all, gold's glory days when it soared above $800 an ounce
at the start of the 1980s seem long past.
   Yet there is a vocal camp of analysts and advisers who still
recommend devoting at least a small fraction of one's assets to gold
as insurance, if nothing else, against future inflationary outbreaks.
   Some argue that gold could enjoy a nice rally if for any reason
policymakers such as Greenspan find it tougher than expected to keep
inflation in check.
   ``We are not turning into gold bugs,'' says James Stack, editor
of the advisory letter InvesTech Market Analyst, but recent
stirrings in inflation ``could point toward substantial gains in
gold and gold stocks in the months ahead.''
   ``Don't look for gold stocks to immediately soar,'' he cautions.
``Most investors firmly believe that inflation will fade after this
latest increase in short-term interest rates. It'll take a while to
shake that confidence.''

<HEAD>Director Goes Against Trend Toward `Cute Baby' Movies</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Katie's newborn image filled the big screen
and her cries from the cradle filled the sound dubbing stage as
director Waris Hussein called for louder wailing.
   The NBC movie ``Those She Left Behind'' focuses on the crisis
caused by Katie's arrival. The mother dies in childbirth and the
father is overwhelmed by grief and the responsibility of taking care
of his new daughter.
   ``I'm putting in some more baby cries,'' said Hussein, who sat at
the control board with several sound technicians.
   ``When we filmed, she wasn't crying all the time. When the father
tells her to calm down, she wasn't crying. We made the baby cry a
few times, but you can only go so far in provoking a child. You have
to go with whatever happens at the time.''
   ``Those She Left Behind,'' which NBC will telecast on Monday,
stars Gary Cole as the father, Joanna Kerns as a business associate,
Colleen Dewhurst as his mother-in-law and Mary Page Keller as the
mother. Michael O'Hara wrote the screenplay.
   Hussein said he selected Dewhurst for the role. He'd previously
directed her in two movies, ``And Baby Makes Six,'' his first film
after moving to California, and its sequel ``Baby Comes Home.'' They
were about a middle-aged couple who have another baby even though
they have grown children.
   ``To me this is more than just about being a father,'' said
Hussein. ``It's about adjustment. It's about growth. I'm always
interested in human nature and how it develops. A man thinks he's
shaped his destiny, but it suddenly changes and he has to start from
rock bottom.
   ``It's a life-enhancing experience. Through his wife's death, he
has to reassess his life and grow. Many men hide behind a lot of
macho assertions. The wife has the baby and she takes care of it. A
man left in those circumstances is basically a child. I think a lot
of women are going to dig their husbands in the ribs.''
   Hussein said one of the things that attracted him to ``Those She
Left Behind'' was that it was not a ``cute baby'' movie.
   ``There's a tendency to do pictures about cute babies,'' he said.
``The baby is very pretty, but I didn't want the audience to `ooh'
and `ah' over the baby. This is going to change people's concepts.
Another thing that appealed to me was that it shows how precarious
life is. It can happen to anybody. Someone's here one minute and
gone the next.
   ``Gary returns to an empty house when that very morning his wife
asked him if he'd be home for dinner. The baby still represents his
wife's death. He has to forgive the baby. He has to adjust to his
wife's death. It's about basic human conditions. It has no frills.
It has an honest approach with no false emotions. I like the way he
has to adjust to his mother-in-law.''
   Kerns, who stars in ABC's ``Growing Pains,'' plays an associate
who helps Cole get through the emotional crisis.
   ``They kind of fall for each other,'' she said in an interview,
``but it was nice that they didn't ride off into the sunset. They
didn't get together and `baby makes three.' I loved working with
Waris. He let the actors act. He wasn't in our faces all the time.''
   Hussein also directed the miniseries ``Little Gloria _ Happy at
Last'' and such TV movies as ``Copacabana'' and ``When the Bough
Breaks.''
   ``I tend to gravitate toward character studies,'' he said. ``I
would hate to be categorized over what I do. I'm not really a
`woman's director.' I've done some things unexpected of me. I
directed `Coming Out of the Ice,'' which had only two women in it. I
do have a reputation among certain actresses. The director I most
admire is George Cukor, who was known as a `woman's director.'
Hitchcock, for instance, is not a director I'd want to follow.''
   Hussein was born in India, but was raised in England and went to
Cambridge University. He began as a theater director, then became a
director-trainee at the BBC at 21. He spent seven years at the BBC,
starting with a soap opera and going on to direct the TV version of
``A Passage to India'' in 1965.
   ``When I came to Los Angeles the biggest thrill for me was seeing
the studio back lots,'' he said. ``I grew up with American movies.''

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
the central bank will keep up its inflation-fighting efforts by
pushing interest rates higher to combat what he termed a troubling
acceleration in price pressures.
   Greenspan said Tuesday the Fed expects ``to support continued
economic expansion while putting in place conditions for a gradual
easing in the rate of inflation over time.''
   He added, however, ``the current rate of inflation, let alone an
increase, is not acceptable, and our policies are designed to reduce
inflation in coming years.''

   The White House Office of Management Budget released figures
Tuesday showing long-term interest rates falling 3 percent in two
years to the lowest point in 20 years and savings and loan deposits
growing at an annual rate of 7.2 percent.
   If the administration's projections are off, the government will

sluggishly.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which reviewed the

Tuesday the board's routine computer surveillance program was ``not
properly tailored to efficiently identify potential trading abuses.''

   The dollar was mixed after Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan failed to signal a dramatic shift in U.S. monetary policy

   The Military Airlift Command is the first
announced customer of Korbx, a computer system from American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. that solves problems previously considered
unsolvable, AT&amp;T said today.
   The command said it will use Korbx to determine the most
efficient way to airlift troops and cargo around the world and to
meet the transportation needs of disaster victims.
   One problem for Korbx will be to determine the best way to move
casualties to hospitals in the United States in case of a war that
is fought on several fronts. Such a problem poses 650,000 variables
and 200,000 constraints, the airlift command said.
   Korbx is based on the Karmarkar algorithm, a mathematical
breakthrough invented in 1984 by Narendra Karmarkar, a scientist at
AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories. The package consists of a powerful computer
and software and is costing the command $6.5 million in a
lease-to-own package.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Bob Ford said several other customers had bought
Korbx but were not willing to have their names publicized. He said
the number of other customers was between two and 10.
   The Military Airlift Command was scheduled to announce its
acquisition of Korbx at a news conference today at Scott Air Force
Base in Illinois. Information about the announcement was provided
Tuesday.

<HEAD>Boeing Confident 747-400 Program Is Getting Back On Track</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. isn't looking for scapegoats to
blame for delays in its 747-400 jumbo-jet program, and instead is
concentrating on getting the project back on track, a Boeing
executive says.
   Some of the problems were simply ``unk-unks'' _ insider talk for
unknowns that can't be planned for, said Bruce Gissing, senior vice
president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes.
   Lengthy design, manufacturing and testing processes, along with
unanticipated airline demand, combined to slow production of what is
the world's largest commercial jetliner, Gissing said.
   ``It just blows my mind to try and figure out why we don't
predict this market better, but when you look at all the factors
that go into it, it's unbelievable that we can do as well as we
do,'' Gissing said in a recent interview. ``We are dealing with
thousands of things here that all must mesh together.''
   The delays forced Boeing to push back delivery dates by several
months for 57 of the 747s due out this year _ the first time in two
decades Boeing has failed to meet delivery deadlines.
   The first 747-400 was delivered in late January to Northwest
Airlines, about a month late. Other deliveries, including those to
Japan Airlines and United Airlines, are running about two months
late, Boeing has said. About 172 of the jets have been ordered.
   One problem delaying delivery is a shortage of workers at
Boeing's Everett plant, where the planes are assembled. To ease
this, Boeing is borrowing workers with needed skills from elsewhere
in the corporation, he said.
   Even so, Gissing said, substantial overtime will be needed until
the program stabilizes. The Everett plant employes about 17,000.
   Gissing declined to discuss specific problems with the $125
million, high-technology airplane, but said there were signs almost
from the start that the program would be behind schedule.
   The switch to a two-person cockpit, for example, required
electronic systems dramatically different from earlier 747 models,
which require a flight crew of three. Customers also wanted many
different configurations of the jet, including a choice of Pratt &amp;
Whitney, General Electric or Rolls-Royce engines.
   Each engine requires the 747 to gain a separate certification
from the Federal Aviation Administration.
   Gissing said the plane missed its FAA certification target date
in December.
   Some airlines have said publicly that they will seek compensation
from Boeing for the revenue lost by not taking delivery of the jets
on schedule.
   ``JAL is very upset about the delays, and I think that Boeing
should do something about that,'' said Tad Fujimatsu, a New York
spokesman for Japan Airlines, which learned recently that five of
its 20 747-400s on order would be delayed. ``Just exactly what that
will be is being negotiated by the head office now.''
   Industry watchers, however, say demands for compensation are
likely to be tempered by the airlines' need to preserve a long-term
relationship with the world's largest aircraft manufacturer.
   The 747-400 can be distinguished from other 747s by its curved
wingtips and extra-long upper deck. The jet, which can seat up to
509 passengers depending upon its configuration, promises reduced
fuel consumption, while its two-member flight crews will save on
employee costs.
   But critics of the jets, including some pilots' unions, have
questioned the safety of the smaller crews, which do without a
flight engineer.

<HEAD>GM, Ford Try To Reduce Bad Car Loans With New Credit-Rating Systems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's two biggest automakers, concerned
about rising default rates on car loans they offer through
subsidiaries, are trying to attact more credit-worthy buyers through
new loan programs.
   General Motors Acceptance Corp. is experimenting with a plan that
divides potential borrowers into three categories according to
credit risk, while Ford Motor Credit Corp. is engaged in a similar
plan.
   The GMAC system, which should be in place nationwide within the
next few months, gives dealers more flexibility in setting the
amount of monthly payments, GMAC spokesman John Andrews said Tuesday.
   ``It will afford us the opportunity of getting some
higher-quality customers,'' he said.
   Joy Wolfe, a spokeswoman for Ford Motor Credit, said the
automaker has been experimenting with a preferred customer plan
since last fall and hopes to make a decision this spring about
whether to implement it nationwide.
   The testing, she said, has been going on at 35 of the credit
company's 137 branches and covers up to a third of the Ford
dealerships nationwide.
   Jack Ferry, a spokesman for Chrysler Financial Corp., said the
lending arm of Chrysler Corp. envisioned no program similar to
Ford's or GM's.
   GM officials have declined to say how much they have lost on a
year-to-year basis because of bad loans, but have said their costs
are increasing. Last week, Andrews said GM had boosted its
automotive loan-loss reserve to about $1 billion in 1988, up 2.1
percent from 1987's reserve to cover bad loans.
   Under the GMAC Quality Finance Plan, a buyer provides a credit
history to the finance officer at a GM dealership and the buyer's
credit worthiness is determined. The buyer then is placed in either
an A, B or C category, with A the best loan risk and C the worst.
   Buyers in the A category, who usually have no trouble getting
loans, would be offered lower rates than the rates available under
conventional GMAC loans. B-level buyers would have rates roughly the
same as those determined under current GMAC policies.
   C-category buyers may be required to come up with additional
co-signers, higher down payments or higher monthly payments to
qualify for a GMAC loan.
   Interest rates for the categories vary from city to city and
could have a spread of 5 percentage points.
   The rates also can be affected by whether the dealership is a
recourse or non-recourse business. A recourse dealership would
guarantee a loan to GMAC. In other words, if the loan went sour, the
dealership would pick up the cost, reducing GMAC's potential loss
and keeping consumer rates down.
   A non-recourse dealer would share any bad loan costs with GMAC.
That obligation on GMAC's part would increase the rates to the buyer.
   Andrews said dealers will be briefed on the program during the
coming months, and, like participation in GMAC itself, have the
option of whether or not to join the program.
   One dealer who joined was Howard Chevrolet Inc. of West Roxbury,
Mass. There, finance manager Stu Sterling said it appears to be
working well.
   ``I can say with some certainty that I've saved about 10 percent
of the deals that I would have lost to a credit union,'' he said
Tuesday. ``When I'm able to show them a rate only off by a half a
percent, that the monthly payment will only change less than 50
cents, it's convenient for the customer.''

<HEAD>Analysts: Oil Agreement Will Bolster Prices, But Not For Long</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An agreement among independent oil producers to cut
their oil exports unilaterally by an as-yet-unspecified amount
during the second quarter will help OPEC bolster oil prices in the
short-term, analysts say.
   But the agreement, reached Tuesday at a one-day meeting in
London, will have little impact on the buoyant supply and weak
demand in the oil market, the analysts said.
   ``I think it means the extension of the oil producers' cartel,
even if the countries don't want to commit themselves to OPEC at
this stage,'' said Philip Morgan, an oil analyst at the London
investment firm Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers.
   There was little immediate reaction in the market. After the
group issued a communique early evening outlining its plans, the
spot price of North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded
international crude oil, was $16.30 a barrel, up 10 cents from late
Monday.
   The group of independent oil producers said that a majority of
its members agreed to cut their oil exports, but it didn't identify
them, nor did it say by how much. Other participants agreed to
freeze their exports, it said.
   ``Specific announcements with respect to the above decisions will
be made by the respective authorities in the course of next week,''
the group's communique said.
   Participating at talks at the Mexican Embassy were Mexico, Oman,
Malaysia, Egypt, China, and Angola, the communique said. Also
attending were observers from the Soviet Union, Colombia, North
Yemen, Norway, the U.S. state of Alaska and the Canadian province of
Alberta, it said.
   The agreement ``is fairly significant,'' Morgan said.
   It was important that the independent producers were acting
unilaterally, analysts said, doing so because the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries has managed to curb its production.
   Last year, independent oil producers offered to cut their output
by 5 percent if OPEC agreed to reciprocal cuts. OPEC refused.
   Some OPEC members have expressed resentment that independent
producers enjoy the benefits of the cartel's production limits
without making a contribution.
   OPEC's 13 members are estimated to be producing about 19.5
million barrels a day, 1 million barrels above their agreed
production limit but well below their fourth-quarter output. OPEC
has set a target price of $18 a barrel.
   ``The psychological impact (on the oil markets) will be quite
strong,'' Morgan said. But, he added,``I think the total volume of
the cuts makes little difference to the whole supply and demand
question.''
   James Henderson, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd. in
London, said: ``Basically, we see it as fairly positive for the oil
price short-term.
   ``Basically, it will help OPEC through the seasonal demand
downturn in the second quarter. We still see a dip in the oil price
but not as dramatically as it would have been.''
   Oil prices will fall to $14.50 to $15 a barrel in March and
April, Henderson predicted.
   The analyst said he expects the independent producers to cut
exports by 200,000 to 300,000 barrels a day in the April-June
quarter.
   But, he said, a reduction of up to 300,000 barrels ``isn't going
to have a dramatic effect on the supply and demand balance.''
   The communique also said some participants ``will go back to
their authorities for further consultations in order to determine
their contribution.''
   ``Further meetings of technical experts will be convened on a
regular basis in order to monitor the evolution of the market
situation as well as compliance with the agreement,'' the statement
said.
   The next such meeting was planned for May 16, and would ``also
address the prospects of the second half of the year, a period
viewed by the experts with caution.''
   ``The experts expressed the strong wish of their authorities to

   The Taiwanese company that offered ``Made in
USA'' labels to American distributors of its U.S. flags says it quit
the business because even that ploy didn't generate business.
   ``We stopped sales to the United States about two years ago
because our products were strongly rejected,'' Ni Feng-ming, general
manager of Ming Teh, told an interviewer in Taipei. ``I guess
Americans hate to see their national flag made by foreigners.''
   The Taiwanese government said Tuesday it was looking into the
label-switching allegations, which amount to a suggestion that
American importers violate U.S. country-of-origin labeling law.
   The U.S. Customs Service already is looking into the allegations.
   Both investigations were sparked in part by Rep. Douglas
Applegate, D-Ohio, who asked for the Customs investigation and
publicized the complaints of a Coshocton, Ohio, flag maker.
   The Colonial Flag Co. provided Applegate with a copy of the Ming
Teh solicitation, which says ``we can realize why you need'' to
remove the original label and replace it.
   ``If possible, we suggest you cut off this label after you
receive the goods and spend very little cost to mark on the flags
your own brand name and Made in U.S.A. signs,'' the 1987 letter
said. ``We can offer the labels too.''
   Ni, who said his company never changed the labels on its flags,
blamed the lack of response to the 1987 solicitation on U.S.
protectionism. The company now makes national flags for Canada,
Japan, West Germany and Australia, he said.
   Victor Chin, a spokesman for the Taiwanese government office in
Washington, confirmed Tuesday that country's Board of Foreign Trade
is looking into the matter. He predicted quick action as ``an
example to other companies.''
   ``We are very concerned,'' he said. ``We are concerned about our
image, naturally, but we are also concerned about our free trade
practices.
   ``I assume something will happen this week,'' Chin said.
   Also Tuesday, Rep. Harley Staggers Jr., D-W.Va., resubmitted
legislation that would require that all U.S. flags be made in the
United States.
   ``I am asking that my colleagues help me to keep our Stars and
Stripes raised in the battle against the exploitation of foreign
countries,'' said Staggers, who told the House some imported flags
violate the U.S. Flag Code.
   ``I have, for example, a U.S. flag that was made in Taiwan,'' he
said. ``Superimposed upon it is a Harley Davidson motorcycle with
the words `High Times' written across the gas tank.''
   Chin, an assistant in the public affairs arm of the Coordination
Council for North American Affairs, said the Taiwanese government
didn't want to comment on the potential impact of the ban sought by
Staggers.

<TEXT>
   In the week after the shooting stopped in
their war with Iran, Iraqis went on a $318-million shopping spree in
state-run stores. They bought up television sets, refrigerators and
other luxury items the government released from warehouses.
   Six months later, the state-run stores are closed to
non-government employees and their shelves are empty. One recently
had only a few light sockets in its electrical department.
   Iraqis are beginning to realize that the $60 billion to $70
billion their country borrowed during the 8-year Persian Gulf war is
going to affect their wallets for a long time.
   No one has come forward to help finance reconstruction, although
neighboring Kuwait has said it might offer some aid.
   Creditors are pressing hard for repayment. New laws designed to
attract private money from Iraqis and from around the Arab world
have attracted little interest.
   ``The economic situation's very bad. Salaries are low and prices
go up and up,'' said Mukhtar, 34, who recently started a chicken
farm to try to supplement his family's government incomes.
   ``I think things will stay bad because they have to pay for the
war. It may be five to seven years before it gets better.''
   Diplomats conjecture that Iraq is spreading the estimated $10
billion to $12 billion a year it earns from oil exports too thinly
by trying to pay for reconstruction, buy expensive armaments,
develop heavy industry, meet consumer demands and pay off its debts.
   Iraqi officials maintain the problems are short-term and that the
economy will eventually refloat on the 100 billion barrels of oil
lying under their feet.
   ``I'm optimistic that the price of oil will hold and Iraq will
remain an important oil-producing country for at least the next
century,'' said deputy Foreign Minister Nizar Hamdoon.
   ``Our resources are quite sufficient to pay the debts back. It's
just a question of time.''
   Hamdoon confirmed reports that Iraq will not have to pay back aid
from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, estimated by diplomats at about $30
billion.
   ``Our Arab brothers are very considerate of the fact that Iraq
was defending not just its own interests, but the interests of those
countries,'' he said.
   Diplomats said private suppliers in the Persian Gulf, however,
were balking at writing off an estimated $6 billion to $8 billion in
goods supplied on credit, but the Kuwaiti government might step in
to pay that bill.
   Hamdoon called the $60-billion debt figure ``exaggerated.'' But
the government will not release any exact figure.
   Diplomats say uncertainty over the size of the debt, an
overvalued dinar currency and a lack of trust in the government's
commitment to the private sector are all factors keeping investors
away.
   ``Arab investors really want the Iraqis to open their books, to
say what their debts are,'' said one diplomat.
   Potential investors dislike the discrepancy between the official
and free market currency exchange rates and worry about the
availability of foreign exchange, diplomats said.
   The Iraqi dinar sells for about 50 cents on open markets in
neighboring countries, but Baghdad fixes its worth at $3.
   Investors have to exchange at least 50 percent of their foreign
currency at that official rate.
   In addition, foreign exchange can be hard to find, especially
with an estimated 2 million Egyptian workers in the country who can
legally send home about $2 billion a year.
   Harsh attacks in the press on steep price increases caused by
businessmen passing on the cost of the official exchange rate have
not encouraged investors.
   The price of an automobile tire, for example, went from 14 dinars
($42) to 100 dinars ($300) when private importers took over and
thefts shot up. Prices like 625 dinars ($1,875 at the official
exchange rate) for a small color television unleashes consumer
charges of extortion. Government salaries have been fixed at about
150 dinars ($450) a month since the beginning of the war.
   Iraqi consumers are also railing against shoddy local
merchandise, complaining about everything from heaters that don't
heat to perfume that has no scent.
   President Saddam Hussein's privatization program aimed at
increasing efficiency and luring back billions of dollars held
abroad has met with limited success, with an estimated 30 to 40
percent of the state-run companies put on the block actually sold.
   Small factories have been snapped up, but items like luxury
hotels at $50 million each remain largely unsold. State television
nightly runs 10 minutes of ads for government enterprises on sale.
   The state retains control of 80 percent of the economy and plans
to keep control of heavy industry and the oil sector, with the
exception of gasoline stations.
   In the meantime, Iraqis remain starved for goods.
   Arab tradition dictates that when a friend admires something you
own, you offer it to him, but the offer is customarily refused.
   An Iraqi visiting from Los Angeles said he offered his Ray-Ban
sunglasses, a crocodile leather belt and an Olympus camera to
friends in Iraq.
   They took them.

<HEAD>Pennwalt Rejects Centaur's $110 Per Share Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pennwalt Corp. says it will consider further
restructuring or seek a buyer rather than accept Centaur Partner's
$869 million takeover bid.
   In rejecting the $110-a-share offer Tuesday, Pennwalt repeated
earlier allegations that Centaur lacked necessary funding and that
the investor group was looking for short-term profits rather than an
acquisition by driving up Pennwalt's stock price.
   ``The board expressed the view that alternatives superior to the
Centaur offer exist,'' said Edwin E. Tuttle, chairman of the
Philadelphia-based Pennwalt. ``The board believes that in light of
the restructuring work commenced in March 1988, it would be
inappropriate to sell Pennwalt to Centaur at $110 per share.''
   The company said its management and the investment firm Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co. will study the possibility of selling Pennwalt to
someone else or further restructuring. The company already sold its
pharmaceutical division and most of its equipment businesses in
fighting the takeover attempt.
   ``We will wait to see what proposal, if any, is offered by
Goldman Sachs and Pennwalt,'' Centaur spokesman Jerry Seeman said in
a statement. ``We intend to continue on our course of bringing our
acquisition proposal to shareholders of Pennwalt for a determination
of whether they will support it.''
   Centaur has forced Pennwalt to call a special stockholders
meeting March 30, when the investment firm will try to replace the
board with members who support the takeover.
   Centaur, based in New York and Bethesda, Md., on Feb. 14
increased its 2-month-old, $100-per-share offer to $110 for the
6,982,000 shares of outstanding Pennwalt stock it does not already
own.
   The latest offer is due to expire March 6.
   Pennwalt, which was trading for about $70 per share in June 1988
when Centaur first made its intentions known, closed at $118.25 per
share Tuesday, up $3.37{.

<HEAD>Toy Manufacturer Says It Has Agreed To Be Sold</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An investor trying to buy the Baltimore
Orioles also is heading efforts to buy Worlds of Wonder Inc., the
toy company that rocketed to fleeting success with the talking bear
Teddy Ruxpin.
   The company, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 14
months ago, announced Tuesday it reached a ``definitive'' agreement
to sell the company to a group of New York investors headed by Eli
Jacobs.
   The sale, for an undisclosed amount, is subject to U.S.
Bankruptcy Court approval, but Worlds of Wonder had ``no
expectation'' the plan would not be approved, said Anne Jordan, the
company's general counsel.
   The investors headed by Jacobs, the majority stockholder of a
group buying the Orioles, plan to continue operating Worlds of
Wonder in Fremont under the same name, the company said.
   ``It allows the company to move forward with the plans for a
revitalized business, which we developed over the past year,''
Stephen J. Hopkins, Worlds of Wonder chairman and chief executive
officer said in a statement.
   Hopkins, a corporate turnaround specialist hired after founder
and president Donald Kingsborough resigned at the request of
creditors last year, also said he was pleased with Worlds of
Wonder's showing at the recent Toy Fair in New York.
   Analysts could not immediately be reached for comment after the
Tuesday afternoon announcement.
   In addition to Jacobs _ whose efforts to buy the Orioles must
still be approved by major league owners _ the investment group
includes Franklyn S. Barry Jr., former president of Fisher-Price
Toys, and David Edelman, former president of Ingram Software.
   Once the reorganization plan is approved, a newly formed company
formed by the investors will acquire the toy company's assets for an
undisclosed amount of cash, notes and preferred stock.
   Proceeds from the sale will go to its secured creditors, Algemene
Bank Nederland and Fist National Bank of Chicago, lead bank for a
group of five financial institutions, the company said.
   The new company plans to issue its own stock, which would be
issued only to the investors and creditors, Jordan said.
   The company, founded in a trailer in 1985, saw its sales jump to
$300 million within two years with novel, high-tech toys, including
Teddy Ruxpin and Lazer Tag, in which players ``shot'' each other
with beams of infrared light.
   But the company became plagued by lagging sales and production
and delivery problems. It suffered heavy losses and filed for
bankruptcy protection in December 1987. The company said in its
Chapter 11 filing that it had $312.1 million in liabilities against
$313.6 million in assets.
   Worlds of Wonder, which continued to promote new toys, including
the Skip Stik, a version of the jump rope, announced late last year
it was talking with investors about a possible sale.
   The company has been negotiating the agreement with Jacobs and
the other investors for the past few weeks, Jordan said.
   Just before it filed for Chapter 11 protection, Worlds of Wonder
employed about 500 people. About 120 people now work for the company.
   ``I think the expectation is that the new investors will build up
the company, and if that happens they probably need to increase (the
workforce),'' Jordan said.
   The company hoped to file a reorganization plan with the
Bankruptcy Court in Oakland during the next few weeks and expected
confirmation hearings within a few months, she said.

   Champion Spark Plug Co., the world's largest
spark plug producer, could become part of diversified manufacturer
Cooper Industries Inc. this spring under a $800 million cash buyout
agreement.
   The acquisition, which is expected to begin Thursday and be
completed by May 1, was approved Tuesday by the board of directors
of both companies, said Ellen Myers, a Cooper spokeswoman.
   Chinook Partners L.P., established in 1986 by the founding
Stranahan family to maintain a dominant voice in Champion's affairs,
has not publicly stated whether it would approve Cooper's offer.
Chinook controls 35 percent of Champion's common stock.
   Champion had terminated an earlier agreement to be acquired by
Dana Corp., which had offered to purchase the company for $590
million in cash and stock, or $17.50 a share.
   Dana, an automotive parts giant, today confirmed the termination
of its agreement with Champion and said it does not intend to make a
new offer.
   ``It's not in the best interests of our shareholders to go
higher,'' said Southwood J. Morcott, Dana President. ``We are unable
to identify potential values in the combination that would justify
an increased price.''
   Under terms of the latest agreement, Houston-based Cooper will
pay $21 a share in cash for all of Champion's 33.6 million common
shares outstanding. The deal, including debt reduction legal fees
and other considerations, brings the total purchase price to about
$800 million, Ms. Myers said.
   Champion stock closed at $22.25 a share Tuesday, down 37.5 cents
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   William Prebe, an automotive industry analyst and former Dana
vice president, said he does not expect Cooper to make any changes
at Champion for at least a year.
   ``I think they (Cooper) will begin to absorb their name into
their parts network. I think things will remain pretty much as they
are for at least a year. After a period of time, they will determine
what they will do with the Toledo operation,'' he said.
   Champion is the world's leading manufacturer of spark plugs for
all types of internal combustion engines. It also makes Anco
windshield wiper blades and a variety of other fuel system and
automotive maintenance parts. It has annual revenue of about $720
million and employs about 9,200 people worldwide.
   Cooper, with 1988 revenue of $4.3 billion, is a diversified,
worldwide manufacturer of products from the electricial, electronic,
commercial, industrial, compression and drilling markets.

   South Korea expressed regret Wednesday
over a U.S. government decision that could lead to trade sanctions
for alleged barriers blocking U.S. sales of telecommunications
equipment here.
   ``We deeply regret the U.S. government's designation of South
Korea as a country to open negotiations,'' targeting it for possible
trade sanctions, a Foreign Ministry statement said.
   The statement urged the United States to be more prudent in
applying the 1988 Trade Act.
   Trade Representative Carla Hills announced Tuesday the U.S.
government has designated South Korea and the European Economic
Community for possible trade sanctions if they fail to lower
barriers against U.S. telecommunications equipment.
   Hills reportedly took the action following a five-month
investigation under the law, which requires the United States to
open negotiations with countries considered to be blocking sales by
American exporters.
   If negotiations don't succeed in removing trade barriers within a
year, the law requires U.S. officials to impose trade sanctions.

   Stock prices fell today, weighed down by a
government report that consumer prices rose in January at the
highest rate in two years.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 7.14 to 2,319.29 in
the first half-hour of trading.
   Declining issues led advancers 9 to 5 on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 337 higher, 604 lower and 514 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 22.98 million as of 10 a.m. EST.
   The Labor Department said the 0.6 percent rise in consumer prices
in January was propelled by higher costs for gasoline, poultry,
fish, eggs and tobacco. It followed moderate increases of 0.3
percent in both November and December.
   The January price increase, which is seasonally adjusted, would
amount to an annual inflation rate of 7.2 percent if the pace for
the first month of 1989 held throughout the year.
   Utilities involved in dividend plays accounted for most of the
early volume leaders on the NYSE.
   Among other issues, Champion Spark Plug was off 1] at 20~.
Champion said Tuesday it had signed a definitive agreement to be
acquired by Cooper Industries for 21 a share, convincing some
investors that a bidding war for the company was over.
   Texas Eastern was off [ at 52\. It had jumped 3~ in heavy trading
on Tuesday after Panhandle Eastern began a tender offer for 80
percent of its stock at 53 a share and Coastal, a rival bidder, said
it was weighing its options.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.54 at 165.52. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 0.63 at 324.23.
   On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.61 points to
2,326.43.
   But declining issues outnumbered gainers by nearly 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
611 up, 872 down and 505 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 141.95 million

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady delivered
President Bush's plan for cleaning up the savings and loan industry
to Congress today and asked that it be swiftly approved.
   Noting the president's Feb. 9 challenge to Congress to pass the
funding and reform package in 45 days, Brady said, ``Once Congress
acts, we will be ready to move to stem the hemorrhaging'' by closing
insolvent S&amp;Ls that pay high interest rates to attract depositors.
   ``Fast action ... will help reduce the industry's cost of funds
by getting the insolvent institutions resolved, out of the
marketplace and out of the business of needlessly bidding up the
cost of funds,'' Brady said in testimony prepared for the Senate
Banking Committee. ``... The time to act is now.''
   Bush's plan calls for spending $126 billion through 1999 to shut
down about 350 insolvent institutions and meet commitments from last
year's rescue of 205 others.
   The president also wants changes in the regulatory structure,
including one strongly opposed by the S&amp;L industry: placing the S&amp;L
regulatory agency, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, in the Treasury
Department.
   Brady told the committee, ``We do not intend to micro-manage the
revitalized Federal Home Loan Bank System.'' But, he added,
``Treasury oversight is essential to ensure that these problems do
not occur again.''
   The Treasury secretary also outlined two new refinements of the
plan.
   S&amp;L owners are being required to put up more of their own money,
or capital, but Brady said they would have 10 years to take
``goodwill'' off their books. Goodwill is the value an institution
has as a going concern, but many analysts say it shouldn't be
included in capital because it disappears once an institution is
liquidated.
   Brady also said the maximum insurance premium for banks and S&amp;Ls
would be $3.50 per $1,000 in deposits. The administration previously
said the maximum would be $7.50. Currently, banks pay 83 cents and
S&amp;Ls, $2.08.
   Brady's testimony, the first hearing on the plan since Bush
proposed it two weeks ago, came amid criticism that it provides too
little money and is based on rosy economic projections.
   The White House Office of Management and Budget released figures
Tuesday showing that the administration is assuming long-term
interest rates will fall 3 percent in two years to the lowest point
in 20 years, and that savings and loan deposits will grow at an
annual rate of 7.2 percent even as the government will be curbing
high-flying, fast-growing institutions.
   ``These assumptions are highly optimistic, exceedingly
optimistic,'' said Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in
Alexandria, Va. ``They're just not realistic.''
   Meanwhile, the House Ways and Means Committee was to hear from
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman, who
under Bush's plan would oversee deposit insurance for both
commercial banks and S&amp;Ls.
   Analysts are warning that if the administration's interest rate
projections are off, as they believe, the government will have to
spend hundreds of millions of dollars more per year to finance the
rescue program.
   Also, if the deposit growth is lower than predicted, then
insurance premiums paid by the industry will fall far short of the
$32 billion projected over the next decade. That would mean
taxpayers would have to pay more.
   Bush's plan calls for raising $50 billion by selling bonds over
the next three years. The bonds will be sold in an off-budget
arrangement, which means the government will have to pay more in
interest than on normal Treasury borrowing.
   The OMB plan shows the special S&amp;L bonds carrying a rate 0.3
percentage points higher than long-term Treasury rates. That's ``a
shade optimistic,'' according to Robert Litan, a banking expert with
the Brookings Institution.
   More importantly, however, the government shows long-term
Treasury rates falling from about 9.2 percent now to 6.2 percent in
1991, which would be the lowest rate since 1968.
   ``To say that that's optimistic is the understatement of the
year,'' Litan said.
   Analysts said the deposit growth projections are in line with the
rate of the past 10 years, but are likely too high if the
administration follows through with other parts of its reform
program. S&amp;Ls under the Bush plan would not be allowed to grow
unless their owners put up more of their own money.
   ``There's no way thrift deposits are going to grow that fast in
light of the capital requirements,'' Ely said.
   He also said the interest rate projections imply a very low rate
of inflation and, in that unlikely event, it would be much harder to
meet the deposit growth targets.

<BYLINE>DOE Nominee Says Fixing Nuclear Plants His Top Priority ^By ROBERT
BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retired Adm. James D. Watkins, the energy
secretary-designate, told his Senate confirmation hearing today his
first priority would be to seek major changes in the way the
government runs its troubled nuclear weapons complex.
   Watkins said the Energy Department's defense program ``has not
brought itself into line with nearly all other public and private
nuclear ventures that have now capitalized on lessons learned''
since the 1979 reactor accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.
   ``There is an urgent need to effect a significant change in its
deeply embedded 35-year culture,'' Watkins told the Senate Energy
and Natural Resources Committee, adding that he would seek to make
the department's nuclear operations better run and more open.
   ``Problems relating to safety, health and the environment have
not only been backlogged to intolerable levels but, in effect,
hidden from public view until recently,'' he said.
   Watkins also said he would seek to reduce U.S. dependence on
foreign oil and to promote greater use of renewable energy sources
such as solar power.
   Congressional debate focused in the final five months of the
Reagan administration on the once-secret nuclear facilities was on
determining how bad the safety, technical and managerial problems
are at the 17-site complex.
   Recently, however, the spotlight has begun moving toward the more
complex and politically sensitive question of how to clean up an
environmental mess that the government acknowledges was caused in
part by too much focus on production goals.
   The Energy Department's facilities develop, build and test
nuclear warheads for the Pentagon. A key link in the network _ a
trio of nuclear reactors at Savannah River Plant in South Carolina _
has been shut down since last spring because of safety concerns and
a series of management and technical problems.
   A key dilemma facing Watkins, if he is confirmed in the post, is
how to get the problem reactors running again in order to assure a
supply of nuclear materials.
   Equally pressing, however, is the issue of cleaning up the
pollution from past operations _ the extent of which the government
acknowledges is not yet known.
   Billions of gallons of radioactive waste have been dumped into
soil and groundwater at and around the nuclear plants, which have
been operated under contract by private companies since the late
1940s. While the Energy Department maintains that public health and
safety are not yet threatened it says the risks _ and costs _ grow
the longer an environmental cleanup is put off.
   Watkins said when his nomination was announced Jan. 12 that he
was extremely conscious of environmental needs, but he made no
public comments before his Senate hearing on a plan developed by the
Reagan administration for modernizing the weapons plants.
   Environmental groups have been critical of President Bush's
choice of Watkins, who served a four-year stint as chief of naval
operations before ending his 41-year military career in 1986. He has
no experience in the commercial energy field.
   ``We are concerned that the appointment of Adm. Watkins signals
that cleaning up the bomb plants and developing a sound national
energy policy will continue to be sacrificed in the name of nuclear
weapons production,'' Dan. W. Reicher, an attorney with the
environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council, said shortly
after Watkins' nomination.
   Watkins, 61, studied nuclear reactor engineering in 1958 at the
Oak Ridge, Tenn., National Laboratory, one of the Energy
Department's key nuclear weapons facilities.
   He was an instructor at naval nuclear power training centers in
1960 and in 1964 when he took command of the nuclear-powered
submarine Snook.
   While he enters the Energy Department at a time of heightened
concern about the nuclear weapons program, Watkins also faces tough
problems in the conventional energy field, including a troubled
commercial nuclear power industry.
   Chief among the more traditional issues is the United States'
growing dependence on foreign oil, caused by rising consumption and
falling domestic production. The Reagan administration said rising
oil imports posed a potential threat to national security, but it
determined that no import restrictions were justified.
   The Watkins confirmation hearing originally was scheduled for
Feb. 2. The White House asked for a postponement, citing a delay in
preparing Watkins' finanicial disclosure reports and
longer-than-expected FBI probes of other Cabinet nominees.

   Signs of higher export demand boosted grain and
soybean futures prices this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The wheat market was the leader in early trading, with buy orders
prompted partly by indications that the Soviet Union was bidding for
400,000 metric tons of the U.S. wheat it agreed to buy at subsidized
prices under a long-term grain pact signed late last year.
   An Agriculture Department report showing unexpectedly high wheat
exports last week also contributed to the bullish tone, analysts
said.
   The USDA reported Tuesday that 39 million bushels of wheat had
been inspected for export last week, about 15 million bushels more
than the market had expected.
   Prices of other grain and soybean futures rose in sympathy with
wheat, analysts said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1} cents to 3\ cents higher with
March at $4.27} a bushel; corn was } cent to 1} cents higher with
March at $2.71 a bushel; oats were unchanged to 3 cents higher with
May at $2.20{ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 1} cents higher with
March at $7.47{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were higher
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .03 cent higher with April at
77.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .38 cent lower to .10 cent
higher with March at 84.17 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent to
.37 cent higher with April at 43.15 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .05 cent to .28 cent higher with March at 38.90 cents a

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp. announced Wednesday it is offering a
$99 one-way fare from East Coast points to cities in the continental
United States, Western Europe and Central America.
   To qualify for the special fares, passengers must travel on Pan
Am between Feb. 21 and March 3, on a ticket costing at least $160
round trip. Fliers must submit their boarding pass and remainder of
the ticket from their qualifying flight to a Pan Am ticket office or
travel agent.
   The $99 one-way fare is based on the purchase of a $198
round-trip ticket.
   The special fares are in effect for travel starting between April
4 and May 17. All tickets must be purchased by March 3.
   On international flights, a seven-day minimum, 30-day maximum
stay applies. For domestic flights, a Saturday night stayover is
required. The $99 fare to Europe is available on eastbound flights
on Sunday through Wednesday and on westbound flights on Monday
through Thursday. Weekend travel is permitted for a $50 surcharge
each way.
   Pan Am said it introduced the fares to stimulate passenger
traffic in the period between Easter and the summer, when travel is
relatively light.
   Competitor Eastern Airlines, threatened with a possible strike
March 4 by its Machinists union, recently introduced ``Super
Coupons'' offering passengers sizable discounts if they fly after
that date.
   The coupons, distributed to passengers on Eastern's domestic
flights, entitle passengers to one-third discounts off any
round-trip fare of $200 or more for travel between March 4 and March
22. Between April 5 and April 30, the coupons are good for a 20
percent discount.

<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
intensified his warnings about growing inflationary pressures today,
labeling ``disturbing'' a new report which showed consumer prices
shot up in January at their fastest pace in two years.
   Greenspan, who was appearing for the second consecutive day of
congressional testimony on the central bank's handling of monetary
policy, referred to a government report released earlier in the day
showing that consumer prices climbed by 0.6 percent in January,
spurred by higher costs for food and energy.
   Greenspan said that a recent acceleration in wage increases was
probably the reason that prices at the consumer level were beginning
to climb more rapidly.
   Appearing before a House Banking subcommittee, Greenspan repeated
his belief that the economy is not currently in danger of a
recession. But, he said, if inflation is allowed to get out of hand
the next downturn could come suddenly.
   ``If inflation re-emerges, I think a recession will move up on us
much more quickly than we can imagine and when it occurs it will be
a prolonged one,'' he said.
   Greenspan's warning put further distance between the central bank
and the Bush administration, which has sought to play down fears
that the country was about to embark on a new inflationary spiral.
   President Bush on several occasions has said he believes the
Fed's efforts to push interest rates higher are an overreaction and
run the danger of slowing economic growth.
   The Fed has so far ignored the comments, putting in place just
last week another round of credit-tightening. Consumer prices rose
4.4 percent in 1988, and the latest Fed move followed an unusually
bad inflation report on wholesale prices in January.
   ``Let me stress that the current rate of inflation, let alone an
increase, is not acceptable, and our policies are designed to reduce
inflation in coming years,'' Greenspan told the Senate Budget
Committee on Tuesday.
   The credit-tightening moves come at a particularly delicate time
for the Bush administration, which based its $1.16 trillion 1990
federal budget on assumptions that the economy would continue
growing at a robust rate with interest rates declining significantly.
   That economic forecast has been roundly criticized. Rep. Leon
Panetta, D-Calif. and chairman of the House Budget Committee, said
Tuesday that the Bush assumptions are more optimistic than even the
``rosy scenario'' used by David Stockman in preparing Ronald
Reagan's first budget in 1981.
   Panetta told Michael Boskin, Bush's chief economic adviser, that
wildly inflated economic assumptions ``will come back to haunt us,
and you, in August'' when the administration is required to reassess
the performance of the economy to determine whether mandatory
across-the-board spending cuts will automatically take effect.
   The Bush budget is based on an assumption that economic growth
will accelerate to an annual rate of 3.5 percent this year, up from
2.7 percent growth in 1988, as measured from the fourth quarter of
the previous year.
   In economic assumptions released Tuesday, Greenspan said the Fed
is tailoring its policies to support economic growth of between 2.5
percent and 3 percent in 1989, a top range that would be a full
one-half percentage point below the administration's estimate.
   Nonetheless, both Greenspan and the administration tried to
minimize their disagreements, with both sides listing prompt action
to trim the federal budget deficit as the No. 1 economic priority.
   Greenspan said the important thing is for Congress and the
administration to reach agreement quickly on a credible, multi-year
program to reduce the budget deficit, which is expected to hit $163
billion this year. He said such action would reassure financial
markets and allow interest rates to decline.
   Boskin, testifying before the House Budget Committee, maintained
that the Fed's monetary policies are generally consistent with the
administration's expectations for economic growth.
   He also said he did not see any problem on the horizon that
threatens to end the six-year economic recovery, the longest in
peacetime history.
   ``We are now at a point in the expansion where an acceleration of
inflation is a greater risk than it was earlier,'' Boskin said.
``This risk is real and we certainly do not want inflation to drift
up into the 7, 9 or finally double-digit rates we saw in the 1970s.''
   The central bank has been pushing interest rates higher since
March of last year, an effort which has sent a variety of short-term
interest rates climbing by about 3 percent. The Fed believes that it
is critical to dampen demand by increasing the costs of borrowing in
light of the nation's tight labor markets and high factory operating
rates.

   Stock prices fell today after the government
reported a big jump in consumer prices and Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan said he found recent inflation trends ``disturbing.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped a fraction below
the 2,300 level, falling 26.79 to 2,299.64 in morning trading.
   Declining issues led advancers nearly 4 to 1 on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 273 higher, 1,074 lower and 476 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 81.75 million shares as of noon EST,
compared to 70.97 million shares at the same time Tuesday.
   The Labor Department said consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in
January, the biggest monthly increase in two years.
   The increase was propelled by higher costs for gasoline, poultry,
fish, eggs and tobacco. It followed moderate increases of 0.3
percent in both November and December.
   ``We're beginning to get a stronger inflationary tone,''
Greenspan said today in testimony before the House Banking Committee.
   Traders feared Greenspan would push up interest rates even higher
to squelch inflation. That would tend to draw money away from stocks
and into high-yielding debt securities.
   ``There has been a lot of optimism built into the market and
you're seeing some of that come out,'' said John Candela, head of
fixed-income and commodities trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co.

a big fourth-quarter loss and projected operating losses for the
first half of 1989, did not immediately return phone calls seeking
comment.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's largest airline announced today a $3.15
billion deal to purchase 20 Boeing 747-400 airliners, the largest
purchase yet of Boeing's newest model.
   The purchase by All Nippon Airways, including spare parts and
General Electric engines for the airliners, amounts to 5.7 percent
of last year's U.S. trade deficit with Japan, Boeing and ANA
officials said in a joint statement.
   The Japanese airline now has 78 Boeing 747s, 767s, 737s and 727s
flying its domestic or international routes. ANA, which is the
world's eighth largest airline, bought 11 Boeing 747s in 1986 and 25
Boeing 767s in 1985.
   Sigeya Goto, ANA executive vice president, said the airline
operates 747s on both domestic and international routes. He said the
new airliners are needed because of plans to increase the number of
international flights.
   Goto also announced that ANA was negotiating to purchase 15 to 20
Boeing 767s at a cost of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion to meet
increasing domestic demand. He said delivery of both the 747s and
767s is expected to begin in 1992.
   ANA flies more than 27 million passengers a year on 66 domestic
routes and on international flights to Washington, D.C.; Los
Angeles; Beijing and Dalian, China; Guam, Sydney, Seoul and Hong
Kong.
   Next year, Goto said, the airline plans to add flights from Tokyo
to Bangkok, Vienna, Moscow, London and Stockholm.
   He said the airline selected the Boeing 747-400 because the
airliners have a computer-controlled cockpit system that increases
safety and reduces the work load of the pilots and an improved fuel
system and advanced aerodynamic design that allow it to fly 1,000
miles further than the current 747s.

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pulitzer Publishing Co. on Wednesday reported a
34 percent increase in its fourth-quarter profit, due partly to
increased revenue from the company's broadcasting division.
   ``Fourth-quarter results were encouraging with cash flow from
operations up almost 17 percent, reflecting a strong revenue
performance from broadcasting and the benefit of expense controls in
publishing and broadcasting,'' said Joseph Pulitzer Jr., chairman of
the board.
   ``Television revenues were up approximately 9 percent for the
quarter, partly as a result of the Summer Olympics, which aired on
the company's three NBC affiliates, and political advertising,'' he
said.
   The company reported fourth-quarter after-tax income was $7.7
million, or 73 cents a share, on revenue of $106 million, compared
with net income of $5.7 million, or 55 cents a share, on revenue of
$99.3 million in the same period last year.
   The company said net income for the year increased 28 percent to
$19.6 million, or $1.88 a share, from $15.3 million, or $1.46 a
share, the year before. Revenue increased to $391 million from $367
million in 1987.
   The company publishes the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and The Arizona
Daily Star in Tucson, Ariz., and newspapers and shoppers in the
Chicago area, including the Southtown Economist and The Daily
Calumet, daily and Sunday newspapers.
   The company's broadcasting operations consist of seven
network-affiliated television stations: WYFF in Greenville, S.C.;
WGAL in Lancaster, Pa.; WXII in Winston-Salem, N.C.; KOAT in
Albuquerque, N.M.; KETV in Omaha, Neb.; WLKY in Louisville, Ky.; and
WPTA in Fort Wayne, Ind. The company also owns two radio stations,
KTAR-AM and KKLT-FM, in Phoenix.

<TEXT>
   Persistent concern about inflation and the course
of worldwide interest rates combined with a weak early performance
on Wall Street drove London stock prices sharply lower Wednesday.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 27.3
points, or 1.3 percent, at 2,033.7, the day's lowest level. At its
best, the index was down 4.4 points.
   Volume was little changed from the previous day at 547.8 million
shares, compared with Tuesday's 543.3 million shares.
   Sparking the latest bout of nerves was news of a 0.6 percent rise
in U.S. consumer prices in January and a subsequent comment by
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that he found the increase
disturbing.
   In addition, further declines in the level of the British pound
against the West German mark were taken to mean the government had
room to leave interest rates high for the time being.
   But the widespread declines in equities took place in light
trading volume. What institutional selling there was was met by
reciprocal buying interest. Markdowns by market makers accounted for
much of the price falls, dealers said.
   ``The momentum isn't really there this week. People are willing
to stand on the sidelines,'' one dealer said.

<TEXT>
   Penny stock scams and non-Wall Street insider
trading will be the main targets of a new coast-to-coast federal
battle against securities fraud, investigators say.
   Disclosure of offenses to be prosecuted, made in telephone
interviews this week, marked the first mention of specific
objectives for new task forces in six cities formed by Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh last month.
   The Justice Department is spending $2 million to hire prosecutors
for the fraud patrols, the first permanent structured assault on
financial corruption in a decade of highly publicized Wall Street
crimes. They will be based in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Denver and Kansas City, Mo.
   ``The cases are out here to be done but everybody thinks the only
place you get prosecutions for these things is the Southern District
of New York,'' said Irving Einhorn, regional administrator for the
Securities and Exchange Commission in Los Angeles.
   The task forces were first proposed in 1987 by former U.S.
Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani in New York, who secured 50 convictions
in his five-year term and a reputation for strong-arm tactics in
white-collar prosecutions.
   The task forces are expected to employ one highly criticized
Giuliani tactic: using the threat of federal racketeering laws to
extract cooperation from securities fraud targets.
   The investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. recently agreed
to pay $650 million to settle criminal securities fraud violations,
but said it did so to avoid a seizure of assets under the
Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, known as
RICO. The task forces even have been dubbed ``The Six RICOteers.''
   U.S. attorneys' offices in the six cities are hiring 15
prosecutors and arranging permanent help from the FBI, SEC,
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Internal Revenue Service and
other agencies.
   One task force already has begun an investigation, according to a
progress report submitted to Thornburgh's office last week, said
David Runkel, a spokesman for the attorney general. He declined to
elaborate.
   Investigators said New York cases that have been ignored will get
attention with the addition of six prosecutors. Fraud in penny
stocks _ inexpensive high-risk stocks traded over the counter _ also
will face intense scrutiny.
   ``I have specific cases that would be, could be, should be
prosecuted that are only not being prosecuted because there isn't
someone to assign to them,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce
Baird, who heads New York's securities fraud division.
   In Los Angeles, a probe of ``boiler-room'' telemarketing scams
resulting in 300 indictments in three years has steered resources
from other white-collar crimes. The office obtained its first
insider trading indictment just last week.
   Look for prosecutions of insider trading, stock manipulation and
penny stock fraud under the new task force, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Terree Bowers said.
   ``We're still limited in resoures. Sometimes I feel like I'm
fighting the battle of the Alamo again,'' said Bowers, who heads the
major fraud division in Los Angeles and is getting three more
prosecutors.
   Added the SEC's Einhorn: ``The epidemic is in penny stock fraud,
little manipulations, the fly-by-night operations preying on small
investors that take the money and run and then disappear.''
   In the other cities:
   _San Francisco, home to the Pacific Stock Exchange, is getting
one prosecutor. U.S. Attorney Joseph P. Russoniello said fraud
opportunities are ripe in public offerings by new high-techcompanies
and in real estate.
   _Chicago, deep into probes of its two commodities markets, the
Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange, will get
three prosecutors to target cases on hold, said Executive Assistant
U.S. Attorney Daniel Gillogly.
   _Denver is getting an extra prosecutor to focus on penny stock
firms, historically concentrated there because of its oil and mining
businesses.
   _Kansas City has a small commodities market with 259 members
trading in wheat and stock-index futures. That market isn't under
investigation but U.S. Attorney Robert G. Ulrich said he's received
complaints of stockbroker abuse.
   The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, which notched more than 20
securities fraud indictments last year, is considered the model for
the task forces. The number of securities prosecutors there has
grown from three in 1983 to 14 today, and other agencies have
supplied help.
   ``The federal government had not been vigilant enough to create a
deterrent in that time. They didn't know the level of the problem,''
said Giuliani.
   The effort is seen as important because there is no single
federal agency with jurisdiction to investigate criminal securities
fraud. The SEC can bring only civil charges while the IRS has both
civil and criminal powers.
   Permanently assigning attorneys to securities fraud cases will
create financial crimebusters outside New York, officials said.
   ``There's always been a large body of experts in the U.S.
attorney's office in the Southern District of New York,'' said SEC
Enforcement Director Gary Lynch. ``The fact that there will be
people designated in other offices means they're going to be
developing similar expertise.''

   Trucks and barges pile 52 million pounds of
paper, cans, plastic and other trash daily onto a Staten Island
dump, building the world's biggest mountain of garbage toward a
height rivaling the skyscrapers across the bay in Manhattan.
   Much of that could be recycled, and New York officials have begun
considering a plan to do so. Elsewhere, more and more communities
are already recycling the trash their citizens throw out.
   They have little choice. While the New York dump is planned to
operate 11 more years, a third of the nation's 6,000 garbage dumps
are expected to shut within five years, forcing communities to find
new ways to dispose of their garbage.
   Every American man, woman and child generates 3.5 pounds of
refuse a day _ adding 160 million tons to the nation's trash pile
each year.
   That pile holds 42 percent paper, 23 percent food and yard waste,
9.4 percent glass, 9.2 percent metals, 6.5 percent plastics, and 9.4
percent other materials, according to the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency.
   Ten states already require _ or soon will require _ residents to
separate newspapers, glass jars, milk cartons, tin cans or other
discarded items for recycling trucks or bins. Legislators in 33
states are expected to consider plans to increase recycling this
year.
   ``People don't want incinerators or dumps near them, so they are
beginning to force their elected officials to start recycling
programs,'' said Cynthia Pollock Shea, a senior researcher at
Worldwatch Institute, a non-profit organization that studies
environmental issues.
   Recycling is not new in the United States. During World War II,
``everybody recycled,'' said Barry Commoner, director of Queens
College's Center for the Biology of Natural Systems. ``People even
recycled rubber bands and string.''
   But the efforts to conserve mostly ended with the war. Now only
10 percent of the nation's garbage is recycled, compared to as much
as 60 percent by some cities in Europe and Japan.
   Studies say as much as 86 percent of household trash could be
recycled, and EPA has set a goal of recycling 25 percent in four
years.
   The process of recycling is simple: separating usable products
from the trash; processing them so they can be substituted for more
expensive raw materials at manufacturing plants; and returning them
to the marketplace as parts of new products.
   It has not been so easy to put into effect. Some communities have
had trouble finding buyers for discarded newspapers, glass or
plastic; recycling programs require start-up funds; and, perhaps
most importantly, people's habits of throwing trash into only one
can be difficult to change.
   Still, experts predict recycling will eventually become a part of
the everyday infrastructure of cities and towns.
   ``Today, trash trucks dominate waste hauling,'' said Peter
Grogan, director of material recovery for R.W. Beck and Associates,
which has helped dozens of communities start recycling programs.
``But by the year 2010, we're going to see as many recycling trucks
as dump trucks, recycling centers as common as video shops ... and
recycling introduced in lesson plans in schools across the country.''
   Among the communities now making it easier for residents to
recycle trash, several are considered international models:
   _Hamburg, N.Y., a Buffalo suburb, started a program in 1981 and
now claims 98 percent of its 3,350 households participate. ``Unless
they want to eat their garbage, they better separate it or we won't
pick it up,'' said Ann Kankolenski, a public works department
employee. She said 34 percent of the trash is recycled and nearly
all the rest burned.
   _Seattle residents already recycled 24 percent of their garbage
before the city started its program last year and the city is aiming
for 60 percent in 10 years. Even steel garbage cans are being
recycled.
   _Wilton, N.H., officials say a voluntary six-town program in
southwestern New Hampshire has 70 percent participation. Started a
decade ago, the program recycles 42 percent of the garbage brought
to a center, burns 47 percent and buries 11 percent.
   Even more is possible.
   Connie Leach, Vermont's recycling director, feeds her food scraps
to worms.
   ``They eat everything up,'' Leach said of the little red worms
that are covered with peat moss in a basement box lined with plastic
and newspapers. The worms' digestive system allows them to eat the
food quickly and so far it hasn't attracted cockroaches or mice.
``I've been very surprised at how well it works,'' she said.
   Leach, named Recycler of the Year in 1987 by the National
Recycling Coalition, doesn't stop there. She recycles all her
household waste except for some types of plastics, junk mail on
high-grade paper and light bulbs. In a month, she throws out only
two small bags.
   Ed Steyh, Seattle's administrator of garbage and recycling
contracts, also goes to great lengths to recycle his trash.
   He lives on an island in Puget Sound, where he can recycle only
tin cans. So, on his ferry rides to work he takes newspapers, glass,
aluminum cans and other items.
   ``I bring them to my in-laws and they recycle it with their
things,'' Steyh said.
   Solid waste management companies also are expanding into
recycling, creating more markets for recycled materials.
   ``Everyone is jumping on the bandwagon,'' said Darlene Snow,
recycling director for the National Solid Waste Management
Association, which represents 2,500 companies that handle half of
the nation's household waste and 95 percent of its industrial waste.
   She said the industry approached recycling warily. ``They had a
routine, a routine without a lot of regulations. Then all these
(state) laws came,'' she said. ``What happened was that haulers
nationwide were losing business to recycling.''
   Now, industry seminars on the topic are full, she said.
   The recycling movement also has put in jeopardy some proposed
trash-to-energy incinerators. Planned incinerators have been shelved
in Los Angeles, Seattle, Boston, Philadelphia and Austin, Texas.
   Incinerators have been touted as a way to produce energy and
reduce the amount of garbage, but questions persist about the affect
on air quality and on the disposal of the byproduct of ash laced
with toxins.
   In 1983, New York City proposed what would be the world's largest
trash-to-energy incineration system. The project, which still needs
federal and state permits, faces stiff opposition from
environmentalists and neighborhood groups.
   Environmentalists say the solution to the city's garbage crisis
should be aggressive recycling. Their goals are 60 percent in 10
years, 90 percent in 20 years. Currently, the city recycles less
than 1 percent of its trash.
   However, under legislation proposed earlier this month in New
York City, mandatory recycling would be phased in over five years.
   ``The debate has now changed from, `What are we going to do about
the garbage crisis?' to `How much can we recycle?''' said David
Antonioli, a staff member with the New York Public Interest Research
Group. ``The Earth is not a dump.''

and bottles into containers for pickup.
   _NEW JERSEY: Residents must separate recyclable materials.
Municipalities have until end of 1989 to recycle 25 percent of
garbage.
   _PENNSYLVANIA: Residents must separate recyclables. Goal is 25
percent recycling by 1997.
   _OREGON: Municipalities with populations over 4,000 must provide
drop-off centers and make curbside collection of recyclables at
least once a month.
   _DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: Offices must recycle paper and newspaper
and residents must recycle newspaper and yard waste by Oct. 1.
Residents and businesses will have to separate metals and glass by

   Mountains of scrap tires are being eroded by
entrepreneurs who are cutting them up for fuel, mixing them with
asphalt to extend highway life and using them to soften airport
runways.
   The pioneers are seeking profitable ways to recycle discarded
tires and remove a huge trash problem. An estimated 240 million
tires are added to the highly flammable heaps each year.
   Some tires are recycled the old-fashioned way, by retreading, but
only 20 percent are suited for that use. A few get new life as
buffers for marine and truck loading docks. Some end up in the
backyard as tire swings.
   But most tires just piled up until business people and scientists
recently stepped up efforts to find new uses.
   In Cleveland, for instance, a company is experimenting with
chopped up tires as a fuel additive in coal-fired boilers to see if
they can reduce acid rain, and scrap tires are being used as
components in septic tank systems.
   For some, finding new uses for scrap tires ``is like (hauling)
garbage _ you get paid to take it in and get paid to make it into a
fuel,'' said Anderson B. Carothers, chairman of Waste Recovery Inc.
   His company uses scrap tires as a supplemental fuel at three
wood-processing plants.
   ``We compete against oil in the Northwest, against gas in
Louisiana, and, in the Southeast, we're competing against coal,''
Carothers said.
   Waste Recovery spent $2 million apiece on plants in Portland,
Ore., Houston and Atlanta, each capable of burning 5 million tires a
year, but the company is not making money yet, Carothers said.
   Robert H. Snyder, former research director of Uniroyal, a
tiremaker that is now part of Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co., spent much
of his career trying to build a better tire and now is working to
retire the mountains of leftovers.
   ``It's very clear to me that a scrap tire can very well pay for
its self-disposal,'' he contends.
   Snyder, a consultant in Detroit, said much of his current
research is confidential because he intends to seek patents. But he
said one new use is adding chopped bits of tires to speed up the
composting of sewage sludge.
   ``It's gathering a fair amount of momentum,'' Snyder said, citing
community programs in New Hampshipe and research at Rutgers
University in New Jersey and in U.S. Department of Agriculture
laboratories in Maryland.
   If each of the 250 sludge composting sites in the nation used
scrap tire chips instead of traditional wood chips to promote the
process, a three-year supply of scrap tires would be needed, Snyder
said.
   Another trend people in the business foresee is increasing state
and city regulation of scrap tire disposal. Carothers said disposal
costs range from 25 to 50 cents a tire depending on licensing and
transportation costs.
   Florida, for instance, began a 50-cent surcharge on each new tire
sale this year to finance disposal. The surcharge will double to $1
in 1990.

<HEAD>Dollar Varied In Europe, Gold Higher</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell against most major currencies
in European trading Wednesday. Gold prices were higher and rose in
London by more than $5.
   Foreign exchange dealers said trading was fairly quiet.
   Traders were unhappy because they believe the U.S. interest rate
is not going to be raised soon, dealers said. Higher rates make the
currency more attractive for buyers.
   The feeling was influenced by Congressional testimony by U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan who said he was satisfied
with the dollar's current levels despite a ``disturbing'' increase
in retail prices.
   The British pound came under pressure from a strong West German
mark. One pound was one cent cheaper for buyers in London than on
Tuesday, costing $1.7465 late Wednesday compared with $1.7565.
   Other rates for the dollar in Europe late Wednesday compared with
Tuesday's late rates: 1.8380 West German marks, down from 1.8420;
1.5667 Swiss francs, down from 1.5685; 6.2625 French francs, down
from 6.2735; 2.0725 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0910; 1,350.50
Italian lire, down from 1,356.00; 1.1965 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1897.
   Earlier in Tokyo the dollar eased to 126.62 Japanese yen, down
from 127.15. In London late Wednesday the dollar traded higher at
126.65.
   The late bid price for gold in London, the major center, was
$386.30 a troy ounce, up from $380.75. Zurich's late bid price was
$386.25 dollars, up from $383.00
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $387.51 dollars bid, up from
$384.34.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.97 dollars a troy
ounce, up from $5.93.

   Stock prices tumbled today after the government
reported a big jump in consumer prices and Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan said he found recent inflation trends ``disturbing.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped below the 2,300
level, falling 32.14 to 2,294.29 an hour before the close.
   Declining issues led advancers nearly 4 to 1 on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 314 higher, 1,190 lower and 439 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 142.32 million shares as of 3 p.m. EST.
   The Labor Department said consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in
January, the biggest monthly increase in two years.
   The increase was propelled by higher costs for gasoline, poultry,
fish, eggs and tobacco. It followed moderate increases of 0.3
percent in both November and December.
   ``We're beginning to get a stronger inflationary tone,''
Greenspan said today in testimony before the House Banking Committee.
   Traders feared Greenspan would push up interest rates even higher
to squelch inflation. That would tend to draw money away from stocks
and into high-yielding debt securities.
   ``There has been a lot of optimism built into the market and
you're seeing some of that come out,'' said John Candela, head of
fixed-income and commodities trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co.
   The January price increase, which is seasonally adjusted, would
amount to an annual inflation rate of 7.2 percent if the pace for
the first month of 1989 held throughout the year.
   Utilities involved in dividend plays accounted for most of the
volume leaders on the NYSE.
   Among other stocks, Champion Spark Plug was off 1\ at 21.
Champion said Tuesday it had signed a definitive agreement to be
acquired by Cooper Industries for 21 a share, convincing some
investors that a bidding war for the company was over.
   Texas Eastern was unchanged at 52]. It had jumped 3~ in heavy
trading on Tuesday after Panhandle Eastern began a tender offer for
80 percent of its stock at 53 a share and Coastal, a rival bidder,
said it was weighing its options.
   In over-the-counter trading, MiniScribe was off { at 4 in heavy
volume of more than 4.6 million shares on rumors that a supplier had
cut off supplies because of non-payment of bills.
   Warren Perry, manager of investor relations for the Longmont,
Colo.-based computer disk drive maker, said the rumors were
unfounded. MiniScribe posted a big fourth-quarter loss and projected
operating losses for the first half of 1989.
   Separately, the company said Q.T. Wiles had resigned as its
chairman and chief executive, effective immediately.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 2.02 at 164.04. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 2.91 at 321.95.

<HEAD>Beatles' Company Files Lawsuit Against Apple Computer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The company representing the disbanded pop group
the Beatles is suing Apple Computer Inc. in a dispute over the use
of the ``apple'' trademark, a lawyer for the company said Wednesday.
   Nicholas Valner said Apple Corps Ltd. filed a lawsuit in the High
Court in London on Tuesday accusing the California company of
violating a 1981 agreement.
   Under the agreement, the company representing the three surviving
Beatles and the estate of the John Lennon allowed Apple Computer to
use the apple trademark on some products, he said.
   But Apple Corps contends that Apple Computer violated
stipulations not to use the trademark ``on any apparatus
specifically designed and intended for synthesizing music,'' he said.
   Over the past few years, the computer company has developed
top-selling hardware with music synthesizing capabilities.
   Apple Corps is seeking an injunction to prevent the further sale
of the products and damages, Valner said. He said the alleged
violations were discovered last year.
   In California, a spokeswoman for Apple Computer said it does not
believe it is in breach of the agreement. Company officials would
not comment in detail on the suit because they had not yet seen it,
she said.
   Under the November 1981 agreement, Apple Computer, founded in
1977, paid the Beatles an unknown amount for the right to keep using
its famous apple trademark.
   Apple Corps was founded in 1967 and its activities included music
releases under the Apple label and a chain of clothing stores. The
Beatles broke up in 1970.
   Some Apple Computer histories trace the name to co-founder Steven
Jobs' memories of working in the Oregon apple country, where he
became convinced apples are a perfect food.
   Wayne Cooper, a San Francisco lawyer advising the Beatles'
company in the dispute, said negotiations between Apple Corps and
the computer company broke down at a meeting in London last week.

   Soybean futures prices closed sharply higher
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a surge attributed to
technical factors in the absence of significant supply-and-demand
developments.
   Corn and wheat futures also advanced while oat futures prices
fell slightly.
   The soybean complex repeated a pattern established Tuesday.
Soybean oil prices rallied first on buying by speculators who trade
mainly on chart interpretations. That triggered sympathetic buying
in the soybean and soybean meal markets.
   ``It was a very firm close overall,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Wheat futures were supported by signs of heightened export
demand, including talk that the Soviet Union had submitted a bid for
400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   At the close, wheat was { cent to 2{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.26\ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 3{ cents higher with March at $2.73\ a bushel; oats
were unchanged to 2 cents lower with March at $2.13 a bushel;
soybeans were 4\ cents to 9{ cents higher with March at $7.55 a

<HEAD>Mexico Raises Some Light Crude Oil Prices By 10 Cents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ISAAC A. LEVI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico plans to cut oil exports about 5
percent and raise some crude prices by 10 cents a barrel starting
March 1 in an effort to help strengthen world oil prices, government
sources said Wednesday.
   The disclosures followed Tuesday's meeting in London of non-OPEC
producing countries, including Mexico, who have pledged to support
OPEC's effort to reduce production and raise prices.
   A source at the state oil monopoly, Pemex, who insisted on
anonymity, said the government would announce the cuts within the
next few days.
   Emilio Matar, a spokesman for Pemex, confirmed that the new
prices would take effect March 1.
   The increases would be for the posted price of Mexican light
Isthmus sold to the United States and Western Europe and extra-light
Olmec sold to the United States.
   Energy and Mines Secretary Fernando Hiriart told reporters on
Monday that Mexico was willing to reduce its exports by 5 to 6
percent for the rest of this year, provided other oil exporting
countries reduce their sales.
   The Pemex source said that if other countries honor the London
agreement Mexico would reduce its average daily exports by as much
as 65,000 barrels a day. The amount would probably vary from month
to month, but could average about 5 percent lower than January
exports, the source said.
   The source did not say which countries' exports would be targeted
for cutbacks.
   Details of the London agreement have not been released. A
statement issued after Tuesday's meeting said that some countries
would reduce exports while others would freeze sales temporarily and
that details were forthcoming.
   Production by Mexico, the world's sixth largest crude oil
producer, averages 2.5 million barrels a day. In January, it
exported a total of 1.3 million barrels a day _ approximately half
to the United States. Japan, its principal customer in the Far East,
buys an average of 180,000 barrels daily.
   Mexico also imports 58,000 barrels daily from the United States
for some of its northern border region to save transportation costs.
   Last November, the 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries agreed to lower its exports to 18.5 million barrels a day
in the first half of 1989 to buoy world market prices and called on
independent producers to make similar cuts. Mexico is not a member
of OPEC, but often uses that international cartel's pricing
guidelines.
   OPEC, whose production late last year was estimated at 22.5
million barrels a day, agreed to the new quota after oil prices
sagged to about $10 a barrel, well below the cartel's benchmark of
$18.
   Mexico sets different prices for its crude for the United States,
Europe and the Far East, under long-term contracts with individual
customers.
   The price of heavy Maya to the United States averaged $12.38 a
barrel during the first half of January, while Isthmus averaged
$15.86 and Olmec $16.80 barrel. In Western Europe, Maya averaged
$11.52 and Isthmus $15.71 a barrel. In the Far East, Maya averaged
$12.20 and Isthmus $14.85 a barrel, according to the latest Pemex
figures.
   Pemex sells Olmec, which it started producing in mid-1988 in
small quantities, only to the United States.

   The Nightmare on Ad Street isn't invincible movie
fiend Freddy Krueger, but to the advertising industry it's just as
threatening.
   This nightmare is state taxes on advertising, which have been
proposed in several states despite the ad industry's major victory
over Florida's ad tax.
   Fifteen months after a storm of industry criticism forced Florida
to repeal its short-lived and controversial 5 percent tax on
advertising and a host of other services, ad trade groups nervously
are eyeing Connecticut.
   The head of the Connecticut legislature's tax-writing committee
says he wants to tax advertising and predicts success there could
prompt similar taxes in neighboring New York, Massachusetts and
Rhode Island.
   ``It's the most threatening situation we have faced since the
Florida fight,'' said Dan Jaffe, who heads the Washington office of
the Association of National Advertisers, a trade and lobbying group.
   Legislation that advertisers fear could lead to a tax on
advertising is before a legislative committee in Missouri but is not
expected to go any further. Foes killed a diiluted advertising sales
tax plan _ applying only to political ads _ earlier this month in
South Dakota.
   And in Oregon, state revenue officials have withdrawn their
support for a proposal to tax broadcasting companies on the basis of
viewership in the state.
   Nonetheless, advertisers, their agencies and media buyers say
they must remain vigilant because budgetary pressures are growing in
many states.
   Advertisers argue that taxing advertising will make products more
expensive and depress sales, cutting into state tax revenue.
   They say taxing advertising would reduce the amount of
information that gets out to consumers about products and warn that
states with such taxes risk driving out business and national ad
spending.
   But those arguments are engendering less sympathy in some
cash-strapped states where a few lawmakers say taxing activities
such as advertising is preferable to spending cuts and general tax
hikes.
   ``There is no reason I can see that they should be excluded from
the tax,'' said Sen. William DiBella, a Hartford Democrat who is
backing a proposal to subject advertising to the 7.5 percent sales
and use tax in Connecticut.
   DiBella chairs the committee that will conduct a hearing next
month on the proposal, terms of which are still being drafted. He
estimated that taxing advertising could generate $110 million to
$120 million annually and said the committee may earmark proceeds
for politically-appealing efforts to combat drugs and crime.
   DiBella said in a telephone interview that he has visited
lawmakers in Florida several times to discuss their experience in
taxing advertising and other services _ and said he thinks a similar
tax could work in Connecticut.
   The Florida tax situation attracted national attention because it
taxed out-of-state services used by Floridians. Companies buying
advertisements in magazines or the broadcast networks, for instance,
were required to pay a tax based on circulation or viewership in
Florida.
   The tax, enacted in July 1987, was repealed six months later amid
an outcry that saw ad trade groups cancel conventions planned in the
state and national advertisers threaten to cut Florida ad spending.
   DiBella said he is unimpressed with arguments that companies
would quit advertising in Connecticut or move out of state if
advertising were taxed.
   ``This state has one of the highest per capita incomes in the
nation, and I doubt that anybody is going to turn their backs on
that,'' he said.
   In Missouri, two bills are pending in committee that would end
exemptions for advertising and a number of other items from the
state sales tax.
   But the sponsor of one of the bills, Rep. Karen McCarthy, a
Kansas City Democrat who chairs the panel handling both measures,
said by telephone she has no intention of moving either bill any
further this year.
   Earlier this month, a plan to impose the South Dakota state sales
tax on advertising was killed in the state House even after being
amended to apply only to political advertising.
   In Oregon, the state Department of Revenue recently withdrew its
support for a proposal to change the way the state taxes the profits
of broadcasting companies to include Oregon viewership as part of
the calculation.
   Jim Brown, a state revenue official, said the department changed
its mind about the bill due to opposition from local broadcasters
and a judgment that the proposal was ill-timed. He said the bill
probably was dead for the session.

   Hewlett-Packard Co. said Wednesday it would form
an alliance with 3Com Corp. and buy 5 percent of the computer
networking company.
   Hewlett-Packard and 3Com said they would work together to network
software that allows different brands of personal computers and
workstations to share information and programs.
   3Com, based in Santa Clara, Calif., is a leading maker of local
area networks for personal computers. Hewlett-Packard, the
Cupertino, Calif.-based electronics giant, makes minicomputers and
personal computers.
   Hewlett-Packard will buy 5 percent of 3Com's shares on the open
market at the prevailing market price, Hewlett-Packard spokesman Roy
Verley said. He said acquisitions beyond 5 percent, if any, would be
announced.
   3Com stock edged up 25 cents a share to $26.75 a share in late
over-the-counter trading Wednesday.
   As part of their alliance, the companies will work to make it
easier for personal computers that are connected in a 3Com local
area network to get information stored on a Hewlett-Packard
minicomputer, Verley said.
   The companies said they would jointly promote the use of
Microsoft Corp.'s LAN Manager technology for connecting different
kinds of computers. 3Com already has a version of the software that
it has developed in cooperation with Microsoft, and Hewlett-Packard
will bring out a version based on the 3Com system, the companies
said.
   Some future releases of 3Com products will have the same screen
appearance, or ``look and feel,'' as Hewlett-Packard's New Wave
format, the companies said.

<TEXT>
   Former Home State Savings Bank owner Marvin L.
Warner won a reprieve from jail Wednesday, nearly two years after
his conviction on charges arising from the collapse of the savings
and loan.
   The 1st Ohio District Court of Appeals ordered the Hamilton
County Common Pleas Court to hear Warner's request for a new trial.
Warner is alleging that juror misconduct at his 1987 trial
prejudiced the case.
   The appeals court rejected the argument by the state that Warner
waited too long to ask for a new trial.
   Warner was convicted in March 1987 of nine criminal charges
arising from the March 1985 collapse of Home State, a privately
insured Cincinnati-based savings and loan.
   At the time, Home State owed depositors more than $144 million as
a result of bad investments through securities transactions with ESM
Government Securities Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
   Warner, a millionaire now living in Ocala, Fla., immediately
appealed the conviction and sentence. He was sentenced to 3{ years
in prison and ordered to pay $22 million in restitution to Ohio to
cover the costs of protecting Home State deposits.
   More than a month after the trial, Warner's wife, Jody,
interviewed two jurors who said a third juror's mother-in-law had an
account at Home State. Warner's lawyers argue that the juror would
have been disqualified if the information had been known during jury
selection.
   Home State's collapse caused a crisis for 69 other privately
insured Ohio savings and loans whose deposits were insured by the
same private agency. Gov. Richard Celeste temporarily closed the
S&amp;Ls and ordered them to obtain federal deposit insurance.

<HEAD>Sears Seeks to Standardize Ad Costs, Worrying Some Newspapers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s plans to streamline its
advertising budget is raising concerns among newspapers that count
the nation's biggest retailer as a major source of revenue, industry
leaders said Wednesday.
   Publishers are expressing uncertainty about the financial impact
of the proposed changes by Sears, the nation's largest newspaper
advertiser.
   But some newspaper executives who are negotiating with Sears say
they believe the talks will produce agreements beneficial to both
sides.
   ``Sears, Roebuck and Co. came to the dance with newspapers. The
fact that they want to continue to dance with newspapers is a very
heartening thing to me,'' said Jerry Tilis, vice president of
marketing with Knight-Ridder Inc., which publishes 32 newspapers in
27 markets.
   Sears has indicated that in conjunction with a major corporate
restructuring announced Oct. 31 that it planned to centralize its
ad-buying, and was asking newspaper groups to help by dealing with
Sears at the corporate rather than local level.
   ``From newspaper chains, we are requesting corporate contracts
that will ultimately lead to one order, one invoice, with a single
rate that would cover each newspaper application,'' S. Scott
Harding, Sears' national retail ad manager, said in a speech last
month to a meeting of the International Newspaper Advertising and
Marketing Executives in San Francisco.
   Sears' proposals are rooted in its proposed corporate
restructuring. A major part of the restructuring involves
repositioning Sears' retail outlets as ``stores of superstores''
offering more brand-name goods at discount prices.
   In conjunction, Sears wants to ``dramatically increase the
quality, consistency and impact of our (print) advertising
cost-effectively,'' Harding said in the speech to the Reston,
Va.-based trade association.
   Harding backed up the plea for cooperation with a statement that
some newspaper publishers have perceived as a threat, saying Sears
needs to either reduce its print advertising costs ``or utilize
alternatives that provide a more cost-effective means of reaching
consumers.''
   Reggie Hall, executive director of the International Newspaper
Advertising and Marketing Executives, said Harding's statement was
not so much an ultimatum as a financial fact.
   ``In this business there are always alternatives; that's why it's
so competitive,'' Hall said. ``The yellow pages, billboards, the
back of a bus _ those are all ways of distributing your message.''
   Tilis, who said he had been negotiating with Sears for about six
months, agreed.
   ``I'm sort of happy they're talking to us as opposed to the local
direct-mailer or the local cable advertiser,'' he said.
   Some newspaper-chain executives said Sears' proposals were
accelerating an existing movement toward industry-wide
standardization of national advertising rates.
   Gary Sherlock, executive vice president of newspaper advertising
with Gannett Co. Inc., owner of the nation's largest chain, said his
company had not determined that complying with Sears' proposals
would result in a loss of ad revenue.
   Tilis said newspaper chains might even find an increase in
advertising dollars from Sears.
   ``We have a vehicle _ the newspaper _ that can address most of
what Sears wants to accomplish with their new direction,'' he said.
   ``If we can position ourselves with Sears to be the solution,
then I think the answer is yes. If we're unable to come up with a
fit, then I think the chances of more revenue are not as good.
   ``But what I draw tremendous comfort and confidence from is that
they need to communicate with a massive audience frequently,'' Tilis
said. ``These aren't people saying, `Give me more for less.' These
are people who want to forge new partnerships with newspapers.''

   Stock prices posted their biggest decline in
three months today after the government reported a jump in consumer
prices and the head of the Federal Reserve said he was disturbed by
recent inflation trends.
   The statement by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, coupled with the
Labor Department's report that consumer prices rose at a 7.2 percent
annual rate in January, raised concerns that the Fed would tighten
interest rates to squelch inflation.
   High short-term interest rates could drain money away from stocks
and into higher-yielding securities such as Treasury bills. In
addition, high rates might push the economy into a recession that
would be bad for stocks.
   ``There has been a lot of optimism built into the market and
you're seeing some of that come out,'' said John Candela, head of
fixed-income and commodities trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co.
   The 0.6 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index in January
was propelled by higher costs for gasoline, poultry, fish, eggs and
tobacco. It followed moderate increases of 0.3 percent in both
November and December.

   Consumer prices shot up 0.6 percent last month,
their fastest rise in two years, the government said Wednesday in a
report that analysts cited as fresh evidence of entrenched and
accelerating inflation.
   Propelled by higher costs for food, energy and a variety of other
goods and services, the seasonally adjusted increase in the Consumer
Price Index doubled the moderate 0.3 percent gains of November and
December, the Labor Department said.
   January's rise, if it persisted for 12 months, would amount to an
annual inflation rate of 7.2 percent, a dramatic increase from the
4.4 percent posted for both 1988 and 1987.
   ``Inflation is accelerating, pure and simple,'' said economist
Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. ``It shows some signs of lurching out
of control. Any way you cut that report, inflation was everywhere.''
   He predicted the Federal Reserve Board would respond by swiftly
driving interest rates higher in an attempt to slow the economy and
dampen inflationary presures.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, testifying before a House Banking
subcommittee Wednesday, called January's gain ``disturbing'' and
said the rising prices were probably the result of accelerating wage
increases.
   Financial markets fell sharply as the report and Greenspan's
comments fueled fears of inflation and rising interest rates. The
Dow Jones 30-stock average fell 42.50 points, its steepest drop in
more than three months.
   ``The market is getting a little bit jittery,'' said economist
Dan Seto of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. in New York.
``The market will look for the Fed to put more pressure on interest
rates.''
   Last month's 0.6 percent increase in consumer prices was the
biggest jump since a 0.7 percent rise in January 1987.
   Higher prices for fuels, poultry, fish and eggs, coupled with a
sharp advance in tobacco prices, accounted for much of the price
acceleration.
   Food costs were up 0.7 percent and energy costs rose 0.8 percent.
Even excluding those two volatile categories, consumer prices were
up 0.5 percent.
   Increased food prices were attributed in part to after-effects
from last summer's drought, but also to generally higher costs of
doing business, including rising distribution and packaging expenses.
   Rising energy prices were pinned to higher costs for crude oil.
   One of the biggest increases last month came in costs for tobacco
and other smoking products, which jumped 4.7 percent after major
cigarette makers raised wholesale prices in December.
   The only two bright spots in January's report were clothing and
housing costs. Apparel prices were down 0.1 percent as retailers
continued to mark down winter merchandise. Housing costs rose a
modest 0.2 percent.
   ``The concern has to be that while inflation's not running away
here, it nonetheless is getting somewhat worse,'' said economist
Lawrence Chimerine of the WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa.,
forecasting firm. ``The trend is upward and that's what's
distrurbing.''
   Sinai called the report sobering because ``it is always
unacceptably high inflation that gets the economy in trouble since
it (inflation) drives the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates
more than anyone would like or expects.''
   ``Those higher interest rates damage the economy as part of the
price of getting inflation down,'' he said.
   Last month's advance left the price index at 121.1 percent of its
1982-84 base, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing
$100 during the base period would have cost $121.10 in January, 60
cents more than in December.
   Unlike other figures in the report, the overall index is not
adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.
   In another report today, the Labor Department said Americans'
average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, increased
0.6 percent in January after falling 0.3 percent in the preceding
month.
   Average weekly earnings last month were $329.48 in January, 4.3
percent higher than a year earlier.
   Even in advance of today's CPI figures, worries about inflation
had been heightened by evidence that the economy entered 1989 with
strong momentum and by a sharp 1 percent jump in wholesale prices
during January.
   Greenspan, in congressional testimony Tuesday, had indicated the
central bank would continue to push interest rates higher in an
effort to check inflation.
   ``Let me stress that the current rate of inflation, let alone an
increase, is not acceptable, and our policies are designed to reduce
inflation in coming years,'' he said.
   The Labor Department gave these other details of January price
increases:
   _The increase in food prices was paced by a 1.6 percent jump in
costs for meats, poultry, fish and eggs. Cereal and bakery product
prices rose 1 percent and dairy products were up 1.1 percent.
   _Gasoline costs were up 0.9 percent during the month after
dropping 1.6 percent in December. Fuel oil costs jumped 4.3 percent,
while prices for natural gas and electricity were up 0.3 percent.
   _New-car prices were up 0.7 percent, while used car costs jumped
0.5 percent.
   _Medical care costs rose 0.8 percent.
   The annualized inflation rate is derived from a more precise
calculation of monthly price changes than the monthly number made
public by the department.

<HEAD>Yugo Sending Out Checks to Cover Some Warranty Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugo America Inc. said Wednesday it has resumed
reimbursing dealers for warranty work performed while the
beleaguered company has been entangled in bankruptcy proceedings.
   Yugo dealers, which have dropped to 260 from 340 a year ago, have
complained that they haven't been reimbursed for warranty work or
rebates authorized by the Yugoslavian carmaker.
   Marcel Kole, acting chief executive officer, said checks totaling
$130,000 were mailed for warranty work between Jan. 31 and Feb. 15,
covering all claims for work done during the first two weeks of this
month.
   The amount was slightly little less than warranty expenditures
before Yugo America and its parent company, Global Motors Inc.,
filed for reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws Jan. 30.
   Hearings on the petition are being held in Newark, N.J. Yugo
Ameria is based in Upper Saddle River, N.J.
   Kole said the money was coming from Zavodi Crevna Zastava, the
Yugoslavian company that makes the little economy car introduced in
the United States in 1985. ``Whatever expenses we are incurring,
they are financing,'' he said.
   Kole said the payments mailed Wednesday were for warranty work
performed after the petition was filed in bankruptcy court. Warranty
claims filed with the company before that time are part of
bankruptcy proceedings.
   He also said negotiations are continuing with some unidentified
U.S. organizations about financing a restructured Yugo company.
   ``The Yugoslavians are looking for a prospective investor as a
partner with them,'' Kole said. ``They also recognize that they do
not share the marketing expertise to make this a successful
venture.''
   He said offers from three parties are being discussed and two
groups familiar with U.S. automobile marketing are close to an
agreement.
   Kole said there are about 9,200 Yugos in the hands of dealers and
another 6,000 in the country.

<HEAD>Material Handlers Ask Investigation Of Steel-Import Limit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of the material handling industry asked
President Bush on Wednesday to appoint a commission to study how a
voluntary steel import limit has affected domestic steel prices.
   The voluntary restraint agreement was enacted by Congress five
years ago to restrict the import of foreign steel and help the
domestic steel industry recover from a slump.
   ``We support a strong domestic steel industry,'' said Albert
Leffler, chief executive officer of the Material Handling Industry
of America, a trade group representing tractor, lift truck and robot
manufacturers. ``But we feel something is wrong.''
   Leffler said the reduced manufacturing capacity of domestic
steelmakers and reduced imports have caused steel shortages and
higher steel prices, putting his industry at the mercy of the steel
industry.
   ``The little guy can't question price and quality at the same
time,'' Leffler said during a conference at the industry's trade
show here. ``He has to take what the steel industry gives him.''
   Officials of the material handling industry say steel prices for
U.S. manufacturers rose 17 percent in 1988, while prices for the
auto industry increased only 4 percent.
   Leffler said the material handling industry, which consumes about
15 percent of domestic steel, wants to see some modification in the
restraint agreement.
   He agreed that the U.S. steel industry is healthier since the
enactment of the voluntary restraint agreement. But he said recent
productivity gains by the industry may have been produced by closing
obsolete plants and by the devalued dollar.
   ``Though the VRA program started with the best intentions, it has
created a cartel-like atmosphere that is charged with opportunity
for abuse,'' Leffler said. ``The small customer without a voice will
get lost in the cheers for Big Steel's success.''
   A bill authorizing the extention of the voluntary restraint
agreement is currently before Congress.
   ``We realize that President Bush and many members of Congress are
supporting the extension of the restraint agreement in the fall of
1989, but they have the time now to rethink and modify the program
before it is too late,'' Laffer said.
   He said representatives of the trade group will meet with
congressional representatives of steel producing states to try to
influence them to modify the agreement.

   Oil futures rose Wednesday, led by a sharp
increase in heating oil prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for
domestic heating oil jumped 1.23 cents to close the day at 50.15
cents a gallon. Other contract months also recorded strong gains.
   Crude oil for April delivery closed 21 cents higher at $17.84 a
barrel, while other contract months rose between 24 cents and 29
cents. The crude contract for March closed at $18.59 a barrel on
Tuesday, the last day of trading on the contract.
   Unleaded gasoline also advanced, with the March contract up 0.72
cent at 49.07 cents a gallon and other contracts between 0.35 cent
and 1.18 cents higher.
   Analysts said heating oil futures got a lift from American
Petroleum Institute weekly inventory statistics released after the
close of trading on Tuesday. The API reported heating oil stocks
fell 4.2 million barrels a day last week.
   Crude oil and gasoline inventories were mostly unchanged for the
week, the API said.
   Andrew Lebow, senior broker and analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc., said the reduction in heating oil
supplies stemmed from end-of-the-season liquidation.
   ``That sparked the rally in heating oil futures,'' Lebow said.

   The dollar fell against most major foreign
currencies Wednesday as dealers weighed the implications of a
government report showing consumer prices rose sharply during
January.
   Gold prices gained, driven higher by the inflation report. Prices
for the precious metal rose by more than $5 an ounce in London.
Later, Republic National Bank of New York quoted a gold at a bid of
$386.40 a troy ounce at 4 p.m. EST, up 90 cents from Tuesday's late
bid.
   The Labor Department said consumer prices surged 0.6 percent in
January, the highest montly rate in two years. Last month's rise
doubled the more modest 0.3 percent increases in November and
December.
   Mary Anne Tompkins, a foreign exchange trader at Barclays Bank
PLC in New York, said the inflation report intensified market
speculation that U.S. interest rates will be hiked to slow inflation.
   Higher U.S. interest rates raise the value of dollar-denominated
investments.
   But in the meantime, many dealers seem to be focusing their
attention on the strong West German economy and British economic
prospects.
   The dollar slid against the West German mark, falling below
levels considered key thresholds at which the U.S. currency would
find support. The dollar fell to 1.8380 marks in London from 1.8420
marks late Tuesday. Later in New York, the dollar fell to 1.83425
marks from 1.8440 marks on Tuesday.
   The British pound came under pressure from the mark's strength.
The pound fell in London to $1.7465 late Wednesday from $1.7565 late
Tuesday. In later New York dealings, sterling dipped to $1.7470 from
Tuesday's late $1.74725.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar eased to 126.62 Japanese yen from
Tuesday's 127.15 yen. In London, the dollar traded at 126.65 yen and
later in New York the dollar finished at 126.525 yen, down from
127.15 yen late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's late
rates, included: 1.5658 Swiss Francs, down from 1.5690; 1.1999
Canadian dollars, up from 1.19225; 6.2560 French francs, down from
6.2795; and 1,349.75 Italian lire, down from 1,351.00.
   Other rates for the dollar in Europe late Wednesday, compared
with Tuesday's late rates, included: 1.8380 West German marks, down
from 1.8420; 1.5667 Swiss francs, down from 1.5685; 6.2625 French
francs, down from 6.2735; 2.0725 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0910;
1,350.50 Italian lire, down from 1,356.00; and 1.1965 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1897.
   Gold prices benefit when price pressures build because investors
typically use precious metals as a hedge against inflation. Renewed
demand for bullion this week also has bolstered gold prices.
   The late bid for gold in London was $386.30 a troy ounce, up from
Tuesday's $380.75. Zurich's late bid was $386.25 an ounce, up from
$383.00.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid of $387.51, up from
$384.34.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $386.90 a troy ounce, up $1 from Tuesday's
settlement price.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.97 a troy ounce, up
from $5.93. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery
settled at $5.935 a troy ounce, up from Tuesday's $5.926.

<HEAD>Copper Surges Again On Reported Shipping Delays</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices rose sharply for the second straight day
Wednesday on reports that shipments from Zambia and Zaire would be
delayed by rail problems.
   On other markets, precious metals and energy futures advanced;
grains and soybeans were mostly higher; and livestock and meat
futures were mixed.
   Copper settled 2.3 cents to 5 cents higher on New York's
Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in March at $1.385
a pound. The two-day gain of 12.3 cents in the March contract
represents a 9.7 percent increase in the contract's value.
   Tuesday's strong advance was fueled by reports that flooding had
disrupted copper production at a mine in Zambia, the world's
fourth-largest copper producer, and by a reported decline in the
already tight supplies of copper registered with the London Metal
Exchange.
   Analysts said the gains may have primed the market for another
upward surge. Wednesday's news of shipping delays was not an
especially alarming development; transportation problems are fairly
routine in Zambia and especially in Zaire, the world's No. 7 copper
producer.
   James Steel, a metal market analyst with Refco Inc. in New York,
said the copper market had been technically oversold after a
two-month slide to Friday's low of $1.252 a pound for March
delivery. Copper futures prices peaked Dec. 8 on the Commodity
Exchange at $1.6475, a record high.
   Many speculators exited the copper market as prices fell, leaving
the market thin and susceptible to sharp price swings.
   ``No one trusts this market anymore,'' said Craig Sloane, an
analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. ``It's
very, very treacherous.''
   Gold and silver futures advanced modestly on the Commodity
Exchange in reaction to the inflationary implications of Wednesday's
higher oil prices and the government's report of a 0.6 percent
increase in consumer prices in January.
   Gold settled 80 cents to $1.20 higher with April at $390.20 a
troy ounce; silver was 0.9 cent to 2.1 cents higher with March at
$5.94 a troy ounce.
   Heating oil led the energy complex higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in reaction to the American Petroleum
Institute's report late Tuesday of a 4.1-million-barrel drop in U.S.
inventories of petroleum distillates.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled 21 cents to 29
cents higher with April at $17.84 a barrel; heating oil was .86 cent
to 1.26 cents higher with March at 50.15 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .55 cent to 1.18 cents higher with March at 49.07 cents
a gallon.
   Soybean futures moved sharply higher on the Chicago Board of
Trade in a surge attributed to technical factors in the absence of
significant supply-and-demand developments. Corn and wheat futures
also advanced while oat futures prices fell slightly.
   ``It was a very firm close overall,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Wheat futures were supported by signs of heightened export
demand, including talk that the Soviet Union had submitted a bid for
400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Wheat settled { cent to 2{ cents higher with March at $4.26\ a
bushel; corn was unchanged to 3{ cents higher with March at $2.73\ a
bushel; oats were unchanged to 2 cents lower with March at $2.13 a
bushel; soybeans were 4\ cents to 10 cents higher with March at
$7.56 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .25 cent lower to .07 cent higher with April at
77.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .33 cent lower to .05 cent
higher with March at 84.17 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent
lower to .25 cent higher with April at 42.97 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .17 cent lower to .10 cent higher with March at
38.95 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Stock Market Has Worst Day In Three Months On Interest Rate Fears</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates with closing prices throughout.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fear of inflation and higher interest rates
produced the stock market's worst day in three months Wednesday as
the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell more than 40
points.
   The 42.50-point decline in the Dow Jones average, to 2,283.93,
was its biggest drop since a 47.66-point slide on Veteran's Day,
Nov. 11.
   Triggering the decline was the Labor Department's report that
consumer prices jumped 0.6 percent in January. It was the biggest
rise in two years and amounted to an annual rate of 7.2 percent.
   The inflation report worried stock investors because it increased
the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would continue to jack up
short-term interest rates to discourage borrowing and cool off the
economy.
   High interest rates provide an attractive alternative to stocks.
One-year Treasury bills, for example, provide a guaranteed annual
yield of more than 9 percent.
   ``As short-term rates go up, stocks become less attractive, quite
frankly,'' said James V. Pease, managing director for equities at
McDonald &amp; Co. Securities Inc. in Cleveland.
   Confirming stock owners' fears, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan told a House Banking subcommittee Wednesday that the
latest inflation report was ``disturbing'' and said credit
tightening would continue until the Fed was satisfied that the
economy had slowed enough to lessen inflationary pressures.
   In addition to siphoning money out of stocks, the high interest
rates raise the risk of a recession, which would lower corporate
profits and thus hurt stock prices.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by nearly 4 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
332 up, 1,197 down and 446 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 163.14 million
shares, up from 141.95 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 192.52 million shares.
   Among actively traded stocks, Champion Spark Plug fell ~ to 21].
Champion said Tuesday it had signed an agreement to be acquired by
Cooper Industries for $21 a share, convincing some investors a
bidding war for the company was over.
   Petrolane Partners gained 1{ to 25}. Panhandle Eastern, which has
made a tender offer of $53 a share for 80 percent of Texas Eastern,
said it intends to sell Texas Eastern's 43 percent share to
Petrolane if successful.
   Among blue-chip stocks, General Motors fell 2\ to 86},
International Business Machines fell 2[ to 123] and General Electric
fell 1] to 45|.
   In over-the-counter trading, MiniScribe fell { to 4 in heavy
volume of more than 4.6 million shares on rumors that a supplier had
cut off supplies because of non-payment of bills. Warren Perry,
manager of investor relations for the Longmont, Colo.-based computer
disk drive maker, said the rumors were unfounded.
   MiniScribe posted a big fourth-quarter loss and projected
operating losses for the first half of 1989. Separately, the company
said Q.T. Wiles had resigned as its chairman and chief executive,
effective immediately.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $40.54 billion, or 1.4
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
2.51 to 163.55.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 6.11 to 335.96, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index fell 5.07 to 290.91.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
3.89 to 402.49. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 321.88, down 2.98.

   Q.T. Wiles stepped down Wednesday as
chairman and chief executive of MiniScribe Corp. as rumors of
financial troubles that were denied by the company caused heavy
trading in the stock.
   MiniScribe, a maker of personal computer hard disk drives, fell
50 cents a share to $4 a share in over-the-counter trading of more
than 4 million shares.
   Wiles, 69, resigned during a regular board meeting because ``his
family position does not now allow him to spend the time and energy
required to act as chief executive through another difficult period
in the industry,'' according to a company statement. His resignation
was effective immediately.
   Richard P. Rifenburgh, 57, Wiles' partner at Hambrecht &amp; Quist
Venture Partners, was elected by the board as the new chairman and
chief executive, at Wiles' suggestion.
   Spokeswoman Jeanne Boyd denied one rumor that a major supplier
had cut off supplies because of non-payment of bills. The company
conceded that it was late on some bills but had not been cut off.
``Everything is fine. There are no payment problems,'' she said.
   The 52-week high for the stock was $13.75 a share.
   MiniScribe reported a 1988 fourth-quarter loss last week of $14.6
million and said continuing losses were expected in the first half
of this year because of a slowdown in the market.
   Wiles commented Wednesday that after a growth in revenues from
$115 million in 1985 to $603 million in 1988, it was best to
stabilize the business and prepare for the next expansion period.
   Wiles' resignation comes amid rumors of more layoffs at the
company. MiniScribe laid off 240 Longmont workers in December, and
employees said they expect another round of layoffs when paychecks
are handed out Friday.
   Company officials earlier this week declined to comment on the
layoff rumor.

<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aluminum producers have raised the price of
sheet used in beverage cans by 6 percent, but consumers may have to
swallow little of that even if can makers fail to stem the metal's
rise, industry officials said Wednesday.
   Can makers are likely to fight hard to reject the increases
announced Tuesday, first by Pittsburgh-based Aluminum Co. of America
and then by Reynolds Metals Co. of Richmond, Va., the nation's
second-largest producer behind Alcoa.
   ``We meet a lot of resistance'' to higher prices from bottlers,
said Frank Dalton, spokesman for Crown Cork &amp; Seal of Philadelphia.
``We'd like to give the aluminum companies a lot of resistance too.''
   If the increase sticks, ``it would hurt if we could not pass it
through,'' Dalton said.
   Alcoa blamed the price hike on higher prices for scrap and higher
labor costs.
   Alcoa last raised prices on can body stock to $1.15 per pound in
January 1988. It now cost will about $1.22 per pound.
   Aluminum producers held off raising prices last year because of
an increased threat from steel as a material for beverage containers.
   ``We're still mindful of the competition, but with higher metal
costs and higher labor costs we're forced to make the increase
now,'' Alcoa spokesman Al Posti said.
   A pound of aluminum sheet makes 25 cans, so the extra eight cents
per pound means each can would cost a third of a cent more and each
24-can case an extra 7.6 cents, said David Moison, analyst for
Resource Stratigies Inc.
   ``I would think that wholesalers, retailers and distributors
would completely miss 7 cents a case,'' Moison said.
   Industry analyst Paul Steinke of Wharton Econometrics Forecasting
Associates gives the can makers a good chance of turning back at
least part of the increase.
   ``Both Alcoa and Reynolds...posted record profits in 1988. Can
makers know that. Consumers know that, so I don't think people are
going to accept it at face value,'' he said. ``There may be some
increase but not the full 6 percent.''
   The price move could also be undermined by any economic slowdown,
which many economists expect later this year. Large additions to
sheet capacity by Alcoa and Aluminum Co. of Canada will further
undermine prices by boosting supply, Steinke said.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if the increase was completely eroded
by the end of summer,'' he said. ``If what I'm saying is true, then
I think (consumers) will be pretty immune from it.''
   But aluminum producers been doing well, can makers are being
pinched by suppliers and customers.
   ``The bottlers have been just beating up on the can makers,''
said one can industry executive who spoke on condition he not be
named.
   ``There used to be a lot of smaller family-owned soft drink
franchises around the country. But Pepsi and Coke have bought up so
much of them that these monsters go into negotiations and beat up on
these guys,'' he said. ``Push will come to shove and they'll not
sell cans at a loss.''
   J. Clarence Morrison, a metals analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds,
said tight supplies made the aluminum price hike a foregone
conclusion.
   ``Can stock is fully sold out for 1989 and probably for the first
part of 1990.... Although the price is being raised to $1.23 here,
Japan has been paying as much as $1.50 per pound and cannot meet its
demand,'' he said.
   The contract price for alumina, an intermediate form between
bauxite and aluminum, has doubled from $150 per ton last year to
$300 per ton and the spot market price of alumina has reached $800
at times, Morrison said.
   The price of used aluminum cans, which account for half of the
metal Alcoa uses, has been at record levels of 71 cents to 74 cents
per pound.
   Alcoa on Wednesday raised the price it pays for used cans from 73
cents to 76 cents a pound, Posti said.

<HEAD>Railroad Car Foundry To Reopen, Citing Increased Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL DE LA GARZA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GRANITE CITY, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's former largest producer of
steel freight car frames said Wednesday it would resume production
after a six-year hiatus, primarily because of increased demand for
its product.
   The Granite City foundry, owned by American Steel Foundries,
closed in 1982 when the railroad supply industry went into a steep
recession.
   But ASF president Norman Berg said at a news conference that the
Chicago-based company plans to reopen the plant May 15.
   ``The railroad products business continues to strengthen,'' he
said. ``The market is indicating to us that orders for new freight
cars will continue to gain momentum.''
   Before it closed, the foundry led the nation in producing steel
railroad car side frames and bolsters, which form the undercarriages
of freight cars, Berg said.
   At its peak in 1979 the plant produced 25,000 steel freight car
frames and employed 1,500 workers. Last summer the company recalled
about 35 former employees to get the facility ready for use.
   By early summer, an additional 230 employees will be back on the
job, Berg said.
   Since the early 1980s, Berg said, the company has pumped more
than $14 million into the plant for improvements.
   Plant manager William Donovan said it was impossible to predict
the number of workers who eventually will regain their jobs, since
the employment level depends on industry demand.
   In its first year, however, Donovan said the foundry would have a
payroll of about $5 million _ welcome news for this
steel-industry-based town of 37,000 residents across the Mississippi
River from St. Louis.
   ``This is like a resurrection,'' said Mayor Von Dee Cruse, noting
that the average hourly wage at the plant was $10.
   The foundry had 850 employees when it closed, Cruse said. Since
then, he said, some former foundry skilled labor switched to Granite
City Steel, the town's largest employer with a 3,600-member work
force, while others found jobs elsewhere.
   Others who made the foundry their career but had few skills
remained unemployed, said Cruse, though he could provide no figures.
   Berg said that while the decision to resume production largely
was based on the increased demand for railroad products, company
officials looked at other factors.
   ``We asked for and received agreements from our unions on a
number of necessary work-rule changes,'' he said. ``All four of the
unions have been most cooperative in working with us to reopen this
foundry.''
   The company also cited the Illinois Power Co. for designing a
favorable rate structure. The foundry uses large amounts of
electricity.
   ASF also has plants in Alliance, Ohio, East Chicago, Ind., and
Hammond, Ind., which will continue their operations, Berg said. ASF
is a division of Chicago-based Amsted Industries Inc.

<HEAD>American Express Steps Up Marketing to College Students</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Express Co. is beefing up its marketing
efforts on campus, offering travel bargains and launching a magazine
for college students who carry the American Express Card, the
company said Wednesday.
   Researchers say there are about 7 million fulltime college
students in the United States spending an estimated $44 billion a
year.
   Students also have the potential for substantial earnings growth
once they are graduated and financial service companies are finding
that it can often pay off to establish a relationship while they are
still in college.
   The market research company CollegeTrak said 51 percent of
college students already have one of the major credit or charge
cards.
   Citibank, the nation's largest banking company which has also
courted the college crowd, counts 1.3 million college students as
holders of either its Visa or Mastercard credit cards.
   American Express said the number of college students holding its
payments card has doubled to more than 500,000 in the past two
years, partly because of relaxed eligibility requirements.
   Fulltime college students can get an American Express Card
without meeting any minimum income requirement and without a parent
as co-signer, provided they do not have a bad credit record. The
annual fee is $55, the same as for regular cardholders, and payment
in full is due every month.
   Despite the relaxed eligibility requirements, people who got the
American Express in college ``were just as responsible about
credit'' as other new cardholders, according to Ken Chenault,
general manager of American Express' personal card division.
   Ed Skonicki, a Citibank executive, said his bank has had the same
experience. ``They take responsibility a lot more seriously than you
would expect,'' he said.
   Under the new American Express program, cardholders who are
fulltime students at a four-year college will get two vouchers for
round trips at $99 each between any two domestic destinations served
by Northwest Airlines in the 48 contiguous states.
   In addition, they will get vouchers for reduced rates on
Northwest to specific destinations and bonus mileage toward
Northwest's free travel program.
   Tickets must be purchased with an American Express Card issued to
the student named on the voucher.
   American Express also plans to publish a quarterly lifestyle
magazine, American Express Connections, that will be sent to its
college student cardholders. The magazine will offer tips on travel
and money management, stories about campus theater and the
professions and mail-order clothing, electronics, entertainment and
travel.
   American Express officials declined to specify how much it was
spending on the program, but said it was a multimillion dollar
effort.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Sues Over Gasoline Emissions Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts, leading an effort by the
Northeastern states to dramatically reduce smog-causing gasoline
emissions, sued the Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday for
delaying action on the state's gasoline volatility regulations.
   ``If the EPA can't take the lead in forging an aggressive, new
national environmental policy, then the very least they can do is
get out of the way when states like Massachusetts take the
initiative,'' Attorney General James Shannon said.
   The suit asks the EPA for an immediate decision on the
regulations.
   The state Department of Environmental Quality Engineering
proposed rules last May requiring gasoline manufacturers to
reformulate gasoline sold in Massachusetts, primarily by eliminating
a butane additive, during the summer to reduce smog-causing
emissions.
   Under the regulations, which Massachusetts hoped to impose this
year, gasoline sold in the commonwealth between May 1 and Sept. 15
must have a Reid Vapor Pressure of 9 pounds per square inch or less,
compared with the 11.5 psi common now.
   RVP is the measure of a gasoline's volatility. The lower the RVP,
the less the gasoline evaporates vapors that contribute to the
formulation of ground-level ozone.
   Currently, only California has such standards, which received EPA
approval since the 1970s. But following Massachusetts' action,
Connecticut, Maine, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Vermont passed
similar regulations and now all are waiting to see what happens with
Massachusetts' application to the EPA to implement the gasoline
restrictions.
   Each individual state must receive EPA approval before the
regulations can take effect.
   Massachusetts, which had a record 53 days last summer in which
its air quality exceeded federal health standards from Cape Cod to
the western part of the state, estimates its gasoline regulations
could reduce the amount of volatile organic compounds in the air by
9,000 tons a year.
   Officials have estimated the restrictions implemented regionwide
could reduce these compounds by more than 150,000 tons annually in
the Northeast.
   Massachusetts submitted its regulations for EPA review in July.
In the suit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Boston,
Shannon alleged the agency failed to meet federal Clean Air Act
guidelines requiring a decision in four months.
   ``We have admittedly taken longer than this four months, although
it is arguable whether the four months is a mandatory requirement or
not,'' EPA Regional Administrator Michael Deland said in an
interview.
   Deland said his office told Shannon ``in explicit terms, and this
was prior to our realization that he was going to be filing a suit,
we would process the Massachusetts (application) by this summer's
ozone season.''
   Deland's air quality chief, Steve Perkins, said Massachusetts'
regulations will be published in the Federal Register on Thursday,
beginning a 30-day comment period before the EPA and then the Office
of Management and Budget can make a ruling.
   Deland said that he personally favors Massachusetts' regulations,
but he said other factors to consider include whether the state
regulations would conflict with EPA's proposal to set a national RVP
standard of 10.5 psi. Under the EPA's plan, the national standard
would not reach Massachusetts' 9.0 psi limit until 1992.
   Deland said the oil industry contends it will be forced to
produce more gasoline if it has to eliminate the butane additive
that commonly makes up about 2 percent of the gasoline sold to
motorists.
   ``The oil refining industry has said that they are at maximum
production right now,'' Deland said, ``and are predicting all sorts
of dire consequences come summer (under Massachusetts' plan), namely
gasoline shortages and escalation in gasoline prices.''
   Deland said the Massachusetts limit ``needs to be done in a
measured way.''

<HEAD>Casino Commission Temporarily Bans Drexel From Atlantic City Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM KRATTENMAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCE TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. was
banned Wednesday from New Jersey's lucrative gaming industry because
of criminal charges against the investment firm in a major Wall
Street scandal.
   ``If a corporation does not have the integrity, it should not be
a part of this industry,'' Casino Commissioner W. David Waters said.
   The state Casino Control Commission voted 4-0 to order Drexel to
rescind its current business with three casino holding companies and
refrain from new business.
   The temporary ban applies at least until resolution of the
criminal case and Drexel's application for a state license to do
business in Atlantic City.
   The New York investment firm has agreed to plead guilty to six
felonies and pay a record $650 million to settle charges including
insider trading and other securities fraud violations following a
two-year federal investigation.
   Drexel attorney Clive Cummis asked the commission to delay action
until the securities case settlement is approved by the Securities
and Exchange Commission. He said the case would be resolved in a
month.
   State gaming enforcement officials asked the commission Jan. 31
to impose the temporary ban on Drexel, whose expertise in high-yield
bond financing helped build the Atlantic City casino industry in the
last decade.
   Drexel said it has raised about $2.8 billion in capital for New
Jersey casinos, about 70 percent of the public funds for the
gambling houses. In the process, the company has earned more than
$120 million in fees, according to state regulators.
   Drexel was hired by Griffin Resorts Inc., last November to help
former entertainer Merv Griffin acquire Resorts International Casino
Hotel. In addition, it has been doing business with holding
companies for Del Webb's Claridge Casino Hotel and the Sands Hotel &amp;
Casino.
   Cummis said Drexel officials would meet with the gaming
enforcement division to determine how it would sever ties with the
casinos.
   Industry analysts say Drexel's ouster would leave a void in
Atlantic City because no other investment companies have financed as
many bonds for casinos as Drexel.
   But Commission Chairman Walter Read said: ``It may be a leader,
but I don't think it's the only one.''
   Cummis contended that Drexel should be allowed to continue in
Atlantic City because it had demonstrated a commitment to firing
employees involved in the fraud scandals.
   But Eugene Schwartz, deputy director of the Gaming Enforcement
Division, told the commissioners that promises of a house-cleaning
were not enough to assure the public that Drexel should do business
in the tightly regulated casino industry.
   Because of the sheer volume of its casino trade, Drexel in 1987
was asked to become the first investment company to apply for a
state gaming license.
   Drexel agreed despite complaints that gaming oversight would
amount to overkill because the firm already was tightly regulated by
the SEC.

<HEAD>Newspapers Announce Proposed Joint Operating Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YORK, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The York Dispatch and York Daily Record
announced Wednesday they are asking for a joint operating agreement
that would unite the business and production functions of the two
newspapers.
   The York market is one of the smallest in the nation where two
newspapers owned by different companies are in direct competition.
   Under the proposal, filed with the U.S. Justice Department,
editorial departments of the Record and The Dispatch would remain
separate and under control of the respective newspapers. York
Newspapers Inc., publisher of the Dispatch, would also retain
editorial control over its Sunday newspaper, the York Sunday News.
   Business functions such as advertising, circulation and printing
would be provided by a new, integrated enterprise, the York
Newspaper Co., according to a joint statement.
   Under the proposal, the Record, published by the York Daily
Record Inc. and owned by the Buckner News Alliance, would publish
Monday through Saturday mornings. The Dispatch, owned by Garden
State Newspapers Inc., would publish Monday through Friday
afternoons.
   Asked whether The Dispatch would cease its morning, weekday
edition under the joint agreement, Anthony F. Tierno, Garden State
vice president, responded, ``not necessarily.''
   The Record would cease to publish its Sunday edition, but would
publish on all holidays. The Dispatch would cease publication on
holidays and on Saturday.
   The York Sunday News would continue unchanged. The Dispatch
purchased the Sunday News from Lancaster Newspapers Inc. last year.
   According to the statement, ``financial hardship'' was the reason
for combining the business functions of the two daily newspapers.
   Implementation of the proposed agreement is contingent on the
approval of the U.S. Attorney General's Office. If approved, the
agreement would be put in place as soon as practical, the statement
said.
   Similar joint operating agreements are in place in 20 U.S. cities.
   Tierno said he was unsure how long the review would take but
noted the Justice Department has sometimes taken as long as three
years to make decisions involving other papers.
   ``It's clear in the agreement that both of us have said we will
continue to compete until the (agreement) is voted yes or no. At
that point, we will make whatever decisions have to be made,'' he
said.
   According to ABC figures reported in the 1988 directory of the
Pennsylvania Newspaper Publishers's Association, the Record had a
daily circulation of 40,408 and a Sunday circulation of 38,328.
   The Dispatch listed a daily circulation of 48,310; the York
Sunday News had a circulation of 42,482.
   Garden State Newspapers Inc. is an affiliate of MediaNews
Holdings Inc. of Houston. MediaNews' other newspaper holdings
include the Houston Post and The Denver Post. Garden State announced
Jan. 13, 1988, it was purchasing The Dispatch.
   In Pennsylvania, MediaNews also owns the Johnstown
Tribune-Democrat and The Columbia News.
   Buckner News Alliance also publishes The Sentinel in Lewistown,
Pa.

<HEAD>Lotus Begins Field Testing Of New Spreadsheet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lotus Development Corp. said Wednesday it
has begun field testing the long-delayed new version of its
signature spreadsheet computer program, Lotus 1-2-3.
   An initial group of about 70 customers nationwide will receive
the new version, known as Release 3, during the next two weeks, the
company said.
   Lotus 1-2-3 has been the industry's best-selling spreadsheet
program, used by thousands of large and small businesses for
accounting, since it was introduced in 1983.
   But competitors have been gaining because of Lotus' repeated
delays in introducing the new version, which was originally
scheduled for shipment early last year and is now due out in the
spring.
   Lotus spokeswoman Susan Earabino called the start of ``beta'' or
field testing ``a milestone in the development process'' that puts
Release 3 on schedule for second-quarter shipment.
   Frank King, senior vice president of Lotus' software products
group, said testers will receive hands-on product training and
participate in feedback sessions with Lotus development, marketing
and sales teams.
   More than 5,000 individual testers at several hundred sites
eventually will try out the new spreadsheet, designed for both DOS
and OS-2 computer operating systems, King said.
   Getting Release 3 out by the latest self-imposed deadline is
widely perceived in the industry as a critical proposition for
Lotus, which is dependent on the spreadsheet for an estimated 60
percent of its sales.
   According to International Data Corp., Lotus had 51.2 percent of
the worldwide market for spreadsheets in the first six months of
1988. Microsoft Corp. was second with a 20 percent combined share
for its Multiplan and Excel spreadsheets.
   In an effort to take advantage of Lotus' delays, Microsoft Corp.
has slashed prices on Excel. Some aggressive retailers are selling
it for as little as $209, or $286 below the suggested price.
   Other competitors include Quattro from Borland International
Inc., which functions exactly like 1-2-3.

   The Federal Communications Commission voted
Wednesday to to pull the license of a tiny New York radio station
saying the owner lied, ran a contest where the prize was awarded to
the station and racially discriminated against a job applicant.
   ``He has 90 days to go off the air or 30 days to appeal'' to the
U.S Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, FCC
spokeswoman Rosemary Kimball.
   The commissioners voted 3-0 in a closed session not to renew the
license of Catoctin Broadcasting Corp., which runs WBUZ-AM, a
250-watt station in Fredonia, about 35 miles southwest of Buffalo,
N.Y. The station is owned by Henry Serafin.
   Among the charges against Serafin was that he discriminated
against a black job applicant in 1980, calling her employment agency
and demanding, ``Don't you have any white girls to send me?'' and
adding that the woman ``would make charcoal look white.''
   This was the first time since 1981 that the FCC pulled a
station's license on character grounds, Kimball said. Only about 100
stations have lost their licenses at renewal since the FCC was
founded in 1934.
   FCC lawyer Richard Bozzelli said the clock doesn't start on the
deadlines imposed on Serafin until the order is officially issued,
which could take two to four weeks.
   Serafin, in a telephone interview from the station, said he would
appeal.
   ``They won't let me sell,'' he said. ``If you have no license,
you're out of business, you have nothing to sell.''
   ``Although we do not lightly decide to deny renewal of a license,
we will nevertheless reach such a determination where the record
demonstrates that renewal would not serve the public interest,'' the
FCC said in announcing its decision. ``An analysis of the record
here leads us to conclude that this is such a case.''
   The FCC also found that Serafin had lied to the commission about
the discrimination allegation and about the station's public
inspection file.
   Finally, the commissioners agreed that Catoctin violated FCC
rules by conducting a contest and failing to award the grand prize
of a stereo, instead keeping it for use at the station.
   On Wednsday, Serafin denied all the charges and said the FCC
picked on him ``being small, being poor.'' He has also maintained
that he was the victim of a campaign by the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored people, the Chautauqua County Rural
Ministries Inc. and a staff member of the local Comprehensive
Employment Training Act office, who ``had an ax to grind.'' The
black job applicant Serafin turned away had been sent to the station
by CETA.
   Andrew Jay Schwartzman, a lawyer for the Media Access Project,
which represented groups challenging WBUZ's license, said the FCC
only decided to act in the face of repeated threats to get a court
order to force final action.
   ``They've stalled all the way, even after their own hearing
officer affirmed our charges of blatant racism nearly three years
ago,'' he said. ``It's about time that the FCC started enforcing the
law.''
   The case was originally filed in 1980 but it wasn't until 1986
that an administrative law judge denied the station's application
for license renewal. The judge, Walter C. Miller, found that Serafin
was ``dishonest, untrustworthy and unreliable'' and that he had
``violated a wide variety of commission rules.''
   Serafin appealed the ruling and the case went to an FCC review
board. In 1987, the board concurred with Miller and recommended
``outright denial of renewal of a license ... Serafin is not the
type of person that should be entitled to a public franchise.''
   The station continued to function under a temporary license as
Serafin appealed to the full commission.

<TEXT>
   John D. Goeken filed a lawsuit Wednesday
against GTE Corp., one day after he resigned as chief executive of
the Airfone subsidiary he founded.
   Goeken's lawsuit, filed in DuPage County court, contends GTE
breached his employment contract at Airfone, which provides
air-to-ground telephone service to airline passengers.
   Goeken said in a statement he plans to file a competing
application for air-to-ground telephone service with the Federal
Communications Commission once the Airfone case is resolved.
   In the lawsuit, Goeken seeks release from his employment
agreement and his agreement not to compete with GTE. He has an
unpublished number and could not be reached for comment.
   Stamford, Conn.-based GTE would not comment on Goeken's
allegations because of the pending litigation, said spokesman Harvey
Greisman, reached in New York.
   ``But I can tell you we will vigorously contest the lawsuit he
has filed,'' he said.
   When GTE bought Oak Brook-based Airfone in 1986, it contracted
with Goeken to run the company through 1990, his lawsuit says.
   GTE then ``stripped Goeken of his authority'' and ``unjustifiably
removed his right to control the business and affairs of GTE
Airfone,'' the lawsuit alleges.
   ``I am deeply disappointed in GTE's failure to perform as
promised,'' said Goeken, who also helped start the company that
became MCI Communications Corp., now the nation's second-largest
long-distance telephone service.
   Some agency officials have speculated there is not room on the
airwaves for another service, though satellite relay could expand
the available range.
   Goeken said it is technologically and economically possible to
share the limited frequencies available, citing the benefits of
competition.
   Goeken invented the patented technology used by Airfone to
provide telephone service from airliners moving at speeds exceeding
500 mph.
   Airfone began providing telephone service aboard airliners in
1984, when the system was installed in an American Airlines DC-10.
By the beginning of this year, nearly 1,000 aircraft had been
equipped with the phones.
   Since 1987, the company also has offered Railfone, for use in
commuter and interstate train travel.
   Goeken's lawsuit says that since GTE took over, complaints about
Airfone service have increased, equipment repair is slower and the
number of calls per aircraft has dropped.
   Greisman declined to characterize Airfone's performance and said
GTE does not break out earnings figures for its subsidiaries.
   ``We always believed and continue to believe that it is an
important acquisition,'' he said.
   Goeken will be replaced as Airfone chairman and chief executive
by Terry Parker, president of GTE's mobile communications group,
Greisman said, while Sumter Logan was to continue as president and
chief operating officer.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. will contribute $500,000 to
cancer research as part of a settlement announced Wednesday in a
trademark infringement case brought by an Italian gunmaker against
GM's Beretta model. The automaker also will pay unspecified legal
and administrative fees associated with the lawsuit filed by
Fabbrica d'Armi Pietro Beretta S.p.A., Beretta said in a statement.
   The 500-year-old Italian company, which has registered trademarks
in this country for the Beretta name starting in 1954, sued GM in
federal court in New York last July, seeking $250 million in damages.
   The settlement calls for GM to donate $500,000 to the Beretta
Foundation for Cancer Research, Beretta spokesman Ralph Cole said in
a statement.
   Under the agreement, GM will be permitted to continue to use the
Beretta name for its car line. The automaker also must acknowledge
in its sale catalogs and Beretta owner's manuals that the name is
being used with the permission of the Italian company, the Beretta
statement said.
   ``We believe that this settlement provides an adequate,
conciliatory resolution to both parties of the litigation,'' Beretta
President Pier Giuseppe Beretta said in the statement.
   GM spokesmen did not immediately return telephone messages
seeking comment.
   The gunmaker went after GM when the automaker unveiled the
Chevrolet Beretta in 1987 despite warning letters from Beretta
lawyers the previous year.
   The conflict between the two companies was parodied last month by
Car and Driver magazine, which did a ``road test'' comparing the GM
sports car with the handgun whose name it shares.
   The Italian company makes luggage, clothing, cutlery and optical
equipment as well as target, hunting and military guns.

   Business leaders, warning of a critical
shortage of skilled laborers in the next century, on Wednesday
embraced plans by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy to create a
multibillion-dollar education program for pre-kindergarten children.
   ``Investing in our children is not just rhetoric. It's sound
business practice, although many of our colleagues have yet to make
that discovery,'' said Arnold Hiatt, chief executive officer of
Stride Rite in Cambridge, Mass.
   Top executives from Stride Rite, General Electric Co., Time Inc.,
and Goodyear Tire and Rubber told the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee, which Kennedy chairs, that fast-advancing
technologies require workers with strong educational backgrounds who
can learn new skills quickly.
   Kennedy's ``Smart Start'' program would have the federal
government finance much of the effort through grants to state and
local governments, which would decide whether to have the programs
operated through schools or community organizations.
   State and parental participation would be voluntary.
   Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, said programs for children in
the year before they attend kindergarten have shown that
participants are twice as likely to be literate, twice as likely to
have a job, one-third less likely to drop out of high school and
half as likely to be on welfare.
   One executive who testified Wednesday, Goodyear Chairman Robert
Mercer, told Kennedy's committee that, ``in our tire plants, you
can't have a guy who can't read or write running a million-dollar
tire machine. Today's tire manufacturing is a highly sophisticated,
computer-controlled process.''
   Frank Doyle, senior vice president at General Electric, said his
company is already having difficulty ``finding job applicants at all
levels who meet our requirement of either being ready to work or
ready to train. ... There is little we at GE can do ... with
employees who cannot read, write or count and who are either
unwilling or unable to learn.''
   Kennedy's proposal would have the federal government cover 70
percent of the program's costs in the first year, 60 percent in the
second and 50 percent in each of the next three years. State and
local governments would pay the balance of the costs.
   The legislation proposes a $500 million federal expenditure next
year, $750 million in 1991 and $1 billion in each of the following
three years.
   All children whose family income is less than 15 percent above
the federal poverty line could attend the programs without charge.
Parents of other children would pay on a sliding scale, based on
family income, up to the full cost.
   Half of all slots would be reserved for poor children.

   The B. Dalton and Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore
chains, which pulled ``The Satanic Verses'' from their shelves
Friday, reversed themselves Wednesday and said they will restock the
novel.
   ``At the urging of an overwhelming majority of its store managers
and employees ... and in light of the statement yesterday by the
President of the United States, B. Dalton company will resume sales
of `The Satanic Verses,''' said a B. Dalton spokesman who asked not
to be identified.
   He said the decision applied to the Barnes &amp; Noble subsidiary as
well.
   The two chains have about 1,250 bookstores across the country.
   The spokeman estimated the book's publisher, Viking Press, should
have additional copies of Salman Rushdie's novel to B. Dalton within
10 days.
   ``As has been the company's practice throughout its history, it
makes no recommendations as to the worthiness or lack thereof of any
of the books found on its shelves,'' the spokesman said. ``The
company continues to believe that bookstore employees are not
capable of, nor should they be required to, bear the burden of
resolving conflicts contained on the pages of the books they sell.''
   Paul Slovak, a spokesman for Viking Press, said the publisher had
no immediate comment on the bookstores' reversal.
   In comments Wednesday, President Bush said he found the Ayatollah
Khomeini's death threat against Rushdie ``deeply offensive to the
norms of civilized behavior.''

<TEXT>
   A continued drought this year would push crop
prices to record highs, trigger a new round of food price increases
and magnify loan losses for farm lenders, a government economist
warned Wednesday.
   Mark Drabenstott, assistant vice president and economist at the
Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City, Mo., forecast a bleak outlook
for agriculture if dry weather again plagues the nation's Farm Belt
as it did last year.
   In testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee, Drabenstott
said the effect of the drought of 1988 on farmers, agribusiness,
farm lenders and consumers ``was not as great as had been expected.''
   He said, however, that ``much of agriculture's adjustment
capacity was depleted in 1988, and the effects of continued drought
in 1989 would be more severe.''
   The Agriculture Department's chief meteorologist, Norton
Strommen, has said a recurrence of last year's severe drought is
unlikely. Drabenstott agreed.
   With grain stocks down in the United States from low production
last year, Drabenstott said a repeat of last summer's drought would
push crop prices to ``record or near-record levels.''
   ``Many crop producers added to their 1988 income by selling grain
inventories built up in earlier years, an option that will not be
available in 1989,'' Drabenstott said in his written testimony.
   ``Thus, despite the very high grain prices that would accompany
continued drought, smaller crops and depleted inventories would
probably mean smaller farm income.''
   Higher crop prices also would deliver a ``severe blow to the
livestock industry'' by driving up feed costs, Drabenstott said.
Consumers, he added, would feel the effects of lower meat production
for some time.
   Despite his grim economic analysis, Drabenstott said the
possibility of a continued drought ``appears unlikely.''
   ``Agricultural records indicate that every year of drought in the
United States since 1950 has been followed by a year of rebounding
production, and in most cases the increase in production has even
led to re-accumulation of grain stocks,'' said Drabenstott.
   However, there are concerns that lingering dry conditions in
portions of the country, such as in the winter wheat state of
Kansas, could keep some crop production from increasing.
   Indeed, the government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility,
operated by the Agriculture and Commerce departments, said Wednesday
that, while rain and snow had improved conditions for winter wheat
in some growing areas, the Kansas crop was still in need of snow
cover and moisture.
   As for the drought of 1988, Drabenstott said ``financial
reserves'' from recently good farming years and a $3.9 billion
federal assistance program helped producers minimize the effects of
last year's poor harvests.
   But he suggested that lawmakers could improve agriculture's
ability to adjust to drought by providing farmers more flexibility
to plant different crops. Current government programs, he said,
often make it more attractive to plant crops based on the federal
subsidy outlook rather than market conditions.

<HEAD>Government Seeks $5 Million Fine For Defense Fraud</HEAD>

   Prosecutors asked a judge to fine Rockwell
International Corp. $5 million for overbilling the Air Force on a
sophisticated satellite navigation system.
   Prosecutors said in a sentencing memorandum filed Tuesday in U.S.
District Court that the fine is necessary ``to punish Rockwell
adequately for its egregious contemptuous conduct.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney George Newhouse Jr. called the request
``conservative,'' citing the company's $812 million profit for 1988
and a projected $176 million profit on its NAVSTAR satellite
production contract alone.
   ``The only rational conclusion that can be drawn from the
evidence is that corporate officials at Rockwell knew about the
deception, knew that the auditors were being told lies and approved,
if not directed, that course of action,'' the government said in the
sentencing memo.
   Rockwell on Wednesday rejected the government's contention.
   ``The prosecutor's assertion that higher company officials
`encouraged and countenanced' deceiving the government is absolutely
false,'' Charles Harff, Rockwell's senior vice president and general
counsel, said in a statement.
   Top managers weren't charged in the criminal case, and Rockwell
blames the double-billing on renegade employees who have been fired
and prosecuted separately. The employees aren't accused of profiting
personally.
   Rockwell entered a conditional guilty plea in the case Jan. 19,
which means that if the company succeeds in an appeal of an early
ruling in the case the plea will be stricken from the record.
   In that ruling, Rockwell failed to persuade a judge to dismiss
the charges against it on the grounds it had reported the
double-billing under a Pentagon voluntary disclosure program.
   Rockwell was charged with conspiracy and contempt in an
indictment that alleges the company and two employees overbilled the
Air Force $446,000 for the manufacture of NAVSTAR Global Positioning
System satellites.
   The satellites transmit radio signals that are received by ships
and planes, enabling them to pinpoint their exact location on Earth.
   The overbilling occurred between October 1982 and March 1986, the
government said.
   In addition to the fine, prosecutors asked that Rockwell be
ordered to repay the $446,000 that was overbilled and take steps to
ensure that its employees know the rules of government contracts.
Sentencing was scheduled for Friday.

   General Motors Corp. will contribute $500,000 to
cancer research as part of a settlement announced Wednesday by an
Italian gunmaker in a trademark infringement case against GM's
Beretta model.
   The automaker also will pay unspecified legal and administrative
fees associated with the lawsuit filed by Fabbrica d'Armi Pietro
Beretta S.p.A., Beretta said in a statement.
   A GM spokesman, however, denied that a settlement had been
reached.
   The 500-year-old Italian company, which has registered trademarks
in this country for the Beretta name starting in 1954, sued GM in
federal court in New York last July, seeking $250 million in damages.
   The settlement calls for GM to donate $500,000 to the Beretta
Foundation for Cancer Research, Berett a spokesman Ralph Cole said
in a statement.
   Under the agreement, GM will be permitted to continue to use the
Beretta name for its Chevrolet car line. The automaker also must
acknowledge in its sale catalogs and Beretta owner's manuals that
the name is being used with the permission of the Italian company,
the Beretta statement said.
   ``We believe that this settlement provides an adequate,
conciliatory resolution to both parties of the litigation,'' Beretta
President Pier Giuseppe Beretta said in the statement.
   Ralph Kramer, a Chevrolet spokesman, said the automaker was
pleased with the settlement but still contends the lawsuit was
unnecessary.
   ``It's been our position and continues to be that no one who
would come into a showroom to look at a Beretta would be confused
that the firearms company would have something to do with the car,''
Kramer said. ``But we're glad that it's over and it's behind us
now.''
   But GM spokesman David Hudgens said later Wednesday that
``Beretta's announcement of a settlement is premature.''
   ``We have not signed a settlement agreement with them,'' he said.
``We are hopeful the matter will be resolved in the best interests
of both parties in the near future.''
   The gunmaker went after GM when the automaker unveiled the
Chevrolet Beretta in 1987 despite warning letters from Beretta
lawyers the previous year.
   The conflict between the two companies and the Beretta name was
parodied last month by Car and Driver magazine, which did a ``road
test'' comparing the GM sports car with the handgun whose name it
shared.
   The Italian company makes luggage, clothing, cutlery and optical
equipment as well as target, hunting and military guns.

   Unisys Corp. announced Wednesday that it has
dismissed 1,700 people at 60 U.S. locations as part of a major
restructuring designed to reduce the computer company's work force
by 3 percent this year.
   The company also said from its headquarters in suburban Blue Bell
that it will close a component assembly plant in Nogales, Mexico, at
a cost of 400 jobs.
   About 190 people at the company's headquarters were released
Wednesday, and about 400 more will lose their jobs at the end of
July, when the company consolidates a computer-design group at the
headquarters with a larger division in Roseville, Minn., Unisys said.
   The second hardest hit location was the company's Santa Clara,
Calif., operation, where disk drives are made. The approximately 350
employees affected there opted to work through a 60-day notice
period rather than leave immediately, Hynes said.
   He said the reductions at the company's other U.S. locations
affected by the cutbacks involved fewer than 100 employees each.
   The moves essentially complete the company's plans to streamline
in 1989 in the face of weak results.
   ``Obviously this is a major restructuring ... that has brought us
essentially into the range where we told people we wanted to be for
1989,'' said J. Peter Hynes, a Unisys spokesman.
   After a presentation last week to securities analysts in New
York, Unisys Chairman W. Michael Blumenthal said the company planned
this year to reduce its work force of 93,000 by 3 percent, or about
2,800 people. In addition, the company plans to pare more than $500
million from its inventories by mid-year.
   ``To be competitive, we have got to reduce costs ... brutally,''
Blumenthal said.
   About 100 of those released Wednesday at the company's
headquarters were computer design engineers, Hynes said. The rest
were in administrative and marketing positions.
   Hynes said only ``a small number'' of the affected employees
would be transferred or rehired.
   Hynes said all employees released this week will receive six
weeks' pay in addition to a severance package. All also are eligible
for job counseling, he said.
   Hynes said earlier that about 900 of Unisys' 68,000 U.S.
employees have been offered early retirement so far this year.
   On Tuesday, Unisys introduced a long-awaited line of mainframe
computers designed by the engineering group in Blue Bell. The new
2200 series will replace the company's 1100 line. The product's
release was delayed by several months, hurting sales as customers
postponed purchases until the new line was available.
   Layoffs are not new for the nation's third-largest computer
company, which is the product of Burroughs Corp.'s $4.8 billion
takeover of Sperry in 1986. Since the acquisition, Unisys has pared
18,000 from its payroll through sales of operations and 12,000 more
through early retirements and layoffs.
   Last year's acquisition of Convergent Inc., a California computer
maker, added 3,500 to the company's job rolls.
   Blumenthal acknowledged last week that it had been ``a tougher
year'' than anticipated and that he expected a weakness in sales to
continue in the first half of 1989.
   Sales in 1988 increased 2 percent from 1987, to $9.9 billion.
Although Unisys' profits rose about 18 percent in 1988, most of the
increase was attributable to lower tax rates, not bigger profit
margins. The company's operating profits slumped by nearly
one-quarter in the final quarter of 1988.
   At their meeting with Wall Street analysts Thursday, senior
executives said they expected results from the first three months of
1989 to be ``poor,'' with no revenue growth, largely because of the
bottoming of the 1100 product cycle.
   The second quarter will improve as the new computer line starts
kicking in revenue, while the third and fourth quarters will be
``exceptional,'' they said.
