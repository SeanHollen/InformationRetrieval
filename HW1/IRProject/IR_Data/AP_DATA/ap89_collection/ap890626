   Pete Rose bet on Cincinnati Reds games over a
three-year span beginning in 1985, and once accumulated a $400,000
gambling debt over a three-month period, the sport's investigator
concludes in a 225-page report released Monday.
   The report by baseball investigator John M. Dowd was publicly
released Monday by a state judge who had kept it private until after
he ruled on Rose's request for a temporary restraining order.
   ``Between May and July 1987, Rose bet ... $2,000 per game on
baseball, including Reds games,'' the report said.
   Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Norbert A. Nadel released the
report Monday under pressure from the Ohio Supreme Court, which said
he had no reason to keep it sealed.
   Nadel on Sunday granted Rose's request to block a hearing that
was scheduled for Monday in New York with baseball Commissioner A.
Bartlett Giamatti.
   Rose, Cincinnati's manager, could be banned from the game for
life if it is determined that he bet on the Reds. Dowd's report said
there was much evidence that he did, although it noted that Rose has
denied under oath he ever bet on major league baseball.
   ``The accumulated testimony of witnesses, together with
documentary evidence and telephone records, reveal extensive betting
activity by Pete Rose with professional baseball and, in particular,
Cincinnati Reds games, during the 1985, 1986 and 1987 seasons,''
Dowd said in the report.
   The report quotes Rose associate Paul G. Janszen as saying
``within a three-month period of time, Pete Rose was in debt over
$400,000 to the bookie in New York.'' It does not indicate if the
debt was due to baseball debts or wagers on other sports.
   Rose bet 52 times on the Reds _ and won 29 _ from April 8-July 5,
1987, according to gambling records cited in Dowd's report.
   Dowd cited telephone records and betting slips supplied by
Janszen, who claims to have run bets for Rose, as supporting
evidence. He also said that evidence supports the testimony of
bookmaker Ronald Peters, who claims he took perhaps more than $1
million in bets on behalf of Rose over a two-year period.
   ``The evidence revealed that in order to protect his stature as
one of the most famous baseball players in major league history,
Pete Rose employed middlemen to place bets for him with bookmakers
and at the raetrack and to pay gambling losses and collect gambling
winnings, thereby concealing his gambling activity,'' Dowd wrote.
   Despite the $400,000 debt, the report said, Rose had been
successful early in the 1987 season in bets with Peters, Rose's
chief accuser.
   David Morgan, an associate of Peters, recalled being told by
Peters during the 1987 season that he was ``getting murdered'' by
Pete Rose on baseball.
   ``Morgan stated that Peters advised him that Rose had him
`hooked' for `about seventy-five thousand,' '' the report said.
   In addition, the report says that Rose owned half of a $47,646
Pik-Six ticket at Turfway Park on April 6, 1989. Thomas P. Gioiosa,
Rose's former housemate, ``falsely represented to the IRS that he
was the sole winner,'' the report said. Gioiosa has been indicted
for that and Rose is under investigation by a federal grand jury in
Cincinnati.
   After the Reds beat Los Angeles 5-3 Monday night, Rose was asked
if he believed the report was balanced.
   ``I can give you an outline,'' he said. ``There's 225 pages and
there's two paragraphs positive about me. It's such a biased report
it's unbelievable. But we will face that because there's not a thing
we can do about it.''
   Robert G. Stachler, a Rose attorney, said he was not bothered
that the report was made public. He declined further comment.

<HEAD>Bush Undecided on Flag Amendment</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS grafs 5-7 bgng ``In an,'' with flag comments from interview.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush supports legislation to restore
criminal penalties for flag-desecration, but hasn't decided whether
to back a constitutional amendment, his spokesman said Monday.
   ``We haven't undertaken a kind of legal analysis that would yield
some definitive action,'' said press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   However, he said Bush's views were clear.
   ``He was very upset'' about last week's 5-4 Supreme Court ruling
overturning flag-desecration laws in 48 states, ``and I'm sure
(Bush) shares the views of members of Congress and others who have
all expressed their feeling that the flag should not be desecrated
in any way,'' Fitzwater said.
   In an interview published in Tuesday editions of The New York
Times, Bush said, ``I think I've sublimated some of the passion I
feel, and I'm very open-minded as to what to do about it. And I've
asked our attorney general (Dick Thornburgh) and chief of staff
(John Sununu) to recommend what to do about it.''
   Bush told his interviewers the depth of his feeling possibly
``goes back to one's own personal experience in life, too, being in
the service and all, in combat.''
   Bush's plane was shot down and two crew members killed in 1945.
Bush was rescued from the Pacific Ocean bu a U.S. submarine.
   ``Flag burning is wrong, dead wrong,'' Bush said after the
ruling, but said he would enforce the Supreme Court edict as
president.
   There have been moves in both the House and the Senate to meet
the Supreme Court's objections and make flag-desecration a federal
offense, but lawmakers are divided on how best to accomplish that.
Some favor an amendment to the Constitution.
   ``The Congress is looking at possible legislation. But at this
point we don't have an official view in terms of legislation,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``But I think the president's attitude is certainly clear. And if
legislation was developed and passed, I'm sure it would be one that
he would support.''
   Fitzwater said a ``preponderance of scholars seem to be
suggesting that (a constitutional amendment) is not a very good way
to go.''

<HEAD>Helmsley Tax Evasion Trial Begins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hotel queen Leona Helmsley went on trial Monday
on federal charges that she evaded income taxes by disguising about
$4 million in renovations to her mansion as business expenses.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 68, watched as potential jurors were questioned
about their impartiality and how much they knew about the highly
publicized case.
   By late afternoon, U.S. District Judge John Walker had
interviewed 18 potential jurors and dismissed four.
   Walker said he would screen the pool of 160 prospective jurors
this week and allow attorneys to make their final peremptory
challenges July 5 before opening arguments.
   One man was excused because he said he was upset about being
asked his salary and because he was mad at judges in general for
allowing the flag to be burned, referring to last week's Supreme
Court decision.
   The other potential jurors who were dismissed were a man who had
read an article about Mrs. Helmsley in Monday's New York Post; an
accountant who once did work for a company that will be named at
trial; and a man who said he was angry with the Internal Revenue
Service for the way it handled a tax problem.
   Mrs. Helmsley was named in a 47-count indictment in April 1988
with her husband, Harry, and two former Helmsley executives.
   The Helmsleys, who head a $5 billion hotel and real estate
empire, were accused of evading personal income taxes by concealing
about $4 million in renovations to their Greenwich, Conn., mansion
as business expenses.
   Helmsley, 80, has been found incompetent to stand trial because
of his memory lapses.
   The other defendants, Frank Turco and Joseph V. Licari, are
charged with helping create bogus invoices to make it appear the
renovations on the 28-room mansion were tax-deductible improvements
on business properties.
   Many potential jurors said they knew the Helmsleys from media
reports and Mrs. Helmsley from advertisements for her hotels that
portray her as the ``queen'' of Helmsley-owned hotels.
   Walker allowed jurors to remain in the pool if they said they
could be impartial.
   One answer given by a 28-year-old architect's intern prompted a
cold stare from Mrs. Helmsley.
   The juror was asked what he knew of the Helmsleys from the media.
``He's old and feeble, and Leona runs things,'' the man said.

<HEAD>Germany Moving Against Firm in Iran Chemical Weapons Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The West German government is taking action
against a German firm that has arranged the sale to Iran of
chemicals that make poison gas, U.S. officials confirmed Monday
night.
   The officials said Secretary of State James A. Baker III
discussed the sale with Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
during Genscher's visit to the United States last week.
   ``We've been very happy'' with the German response, said one
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Both officials said they did not have precise details of just
what the German government was doing in the case.
   The New York Times said in Tuesday editions that a Dusseldorf
firm, which U.S. officials did not identify, had acted as a broker
in arranging the sale to Iran of hundreds of tons of thionyl
chloride, a chemical that can be used to make mustard gas, by an
Indian manufacturer.
   The bulk of the chemicals was said not to have been delivered.
   Iranian troops were the targets of several gas attacks by Iraq in
the eight-year war between those two countries.
   Last winter, U.S. officials accused German firms of helping Libya
built a plant that could be used to produce chemical weapons, though
Libya insisted the plant would be used for pharmaceuticals.
   In response, the German government has proposed legislation to
stiffen export controls and penalties for violating them.

<HEAD>Judge Again Extends Sealing Order On Unisys Documents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Monday extended a sealing
order on several documents seized by government agents who were
looking for evidence that Unisys Corp. bought information to help it
win defense contracts.
   Judge Diana E. Murphy extended until July 27 the sealing order
affecting documents taken from the offices of Unisys employees Ralph
Hughes, Bob Elfering and Bill Geiger.
   The three were among those searched on June 14, 1988, in a
nationwide sweep by federal agents investigating possible bribery of
public officials, conspiracy and fraud in the defense department's
procurement system.
   A number of documents relating to searches of the Minnesota
facilities of Unisys have been sealed at the government's request
since June 16, 1988. Other documents have been made public since the
initial sealing order was filed.
   On May 17, the court had extended the sealing order for several
of the documents until June 26, when the government had believed
that its need for continued sealing of the documents would end.
   However, because of scheduling conflicts, the government moved to
extend the order until July 27 because it had been unable to proceed
as quickly as expected.

<HEAD>Vietnam Vets Hope Agent Orange Decision Will Open Door for Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report; dated matter in 22nd graf, `A scientific

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   David Maier believes he lost his arm in the service of his
country. His country, until now, has disagreed.
   The arm _ a casualty of cancer, not combat _ was amputated at the
shoulder seven years after Maier's discharge from the Navy.
   But the Vietnam veteran, now 46 and living in Bay Village, Ohio,
puts the blame for his cancer on Agent Orange, the toxic herbicide
U.S. troops sprayed over the jungles of southeast Asia. He is
convinced it was awash in the coffee-colored Mekong River water
pumped aboard his ship for showers.
   Like more than 34,000 other Vietnam veterans who believe they
have become ill because of Agent Orange, Maier applied for
government disability benefits. And like all but five of those
applicants, he was denied.
   Now Maier hopes his claim will be reconsidered, thanks to a
federal judge's ruling in San Francisco last month that found the
government failed to give Agent Orange claimants the benefit of the
doubt.
   To the surprise of many veterans, the Bush administration decided
not to appeal. Instead, Veterans Secretary Edward Derwinski
announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs, the new name for
the Veterans Administration, would rewrite its rules for granting
disability.
   Derwinski's decision could open the door to claims from hundreds
of thousands of Vietnam veterans.
   Although 34,000 have applied for disability on the basis of Agent
Orange exposure, about 250,000 veterans are listed in a registry of
those who believe they were exposed to the herbicide. Many never
applied because they believed they didn't stand a chance of getting
disability.
   Officials for some veterans' organizations say they're cautiously
optimistic that the VA has changed its attitude along with its name.
   ``It is our feeling at this point that Secretary Derwinski really
does want to see some change,'' said Barry Kasinitz, a spokesman for
Vietnam Veterans of America, the group that brought the lawsuit in
San Francisco.
   Others remain skeptical, their attitude reflecting the deep
bitterness that many Vietnam veterans feel toward a government that
they believe used and abandoned them.
   ``We'll believe it when we see it,'' said James Sparrow, the
executive director of Vietnam Veterans Agent Orange Victims, an
advocacy group based in Stamford, Conn.
   ``It's my feeling that they'll probably do as little as they
can,'' said Sandra Hosty, an attorney for Swords to Plowshares, a
San Francisco group that provides counseling and representation for
veterans seeking benefits.
   Still, Ms. Hosty added, ``I would love to be surprised. I would
love to be wrong.''
   Agent Orange, named for the orange-striped drums in which it was
stored, was developed for the military in the early 1940s. It was a
50-50 mixture of two powerful herbicides _ 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T.
   In Vietnam, U.S. troops sprayed Agent Orange from the air to
strip away the enemy's jungle cover and deplete its crops. It worked
devastatingly well.
   The herbicide was banned after the chemical dioxin, which is
present in 2,4,5-T, was found to be the most carcinogenic substance
ever tested on laboratory animals.
   Veterans organizations have pointed to evidence that the
herbicide may cause serious disorders, including non-Hodgkins
lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma and a liver ailment known as PCT.
   The VA, on the other hand, has maintained that Agent Orange has
been scientifically linked to only one illness in humans, a severe
skin rash called chloracne. And the government has insisted that
veterans seeking benefits because of chloracne provide proof that
they got the rash from Agent Orange, a burden that has been
impossible for most to meet.
   However, in what some veterans see as a partial admission of
responsibility, the VA has provided free medical care to anyone who
believes he or she became ill because of Agent Orange.
   Under Derwinski's new orders, the Department of Veterans Affairs
has begun redrafting its guidelines for disability benefits,
starting by changing the way in which it determines whether a
``significant statistical association'' exists between Agent Orange
and a disease.
   A scientific advisory committee planned to review the proposed
changes at a meeting today with changes to be published in the
Federal Register. Derwinski will make a final decision on the
changes, probably in October.
   Once new guidelines are in place, the VA's advisory committee
will reconsider whether links exist between Agent Orange and
diseases that veterans believe it has caused. Again, a final
decision will be up to Derwinski.
   The stakes are high, as the makers of Agent Orange can attest.
After veterans filed a lawsuit against them, seven chemical
companies settled out of court for $180 million in 1984.
   Derwinski has said cost is irrelevant to the VA's stance.
Disability benefits, which are independent of medical benefits or
Social Security, currently range from $73 a month for a veteran who
is 10 percent disabled to $1,468 a month for a veteran who is 100
percent disabled.
   If just 30,000 veterans were found to be 10 percent disabled, the
cost to the government would be more than $26 million a year.
   For that reason alone, some veterans' advocates say they doubt
the VA will adopt sweeping changes.
   ``The VA would literally be opening the doors to tens of
thousands of claims,'' said Sparrow. ``I just don't see how they
could do it.''
   Fred Juarbe, director of the National Veterans Service program
for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, commended Derwinski for taking ``a
step in the right direction.''
   Still, Juarbe said, ``I think the bottom line is, we're still
going to require legislation. ... Given the way the VA has ruled in
the past, we're not confident that we can rely on the Department of
Veterans Affairs to carry out this policy.''
   One such piece of legislation was introduced in Congress earlier
this month. A bill by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., and Tom Daschle, D-S.D., would provide disability benefits
for veterans who have non-Hodgkins lymphoma or soft-tissue sarcoma,
two of the diseases associated with Agent Orange.
   ``It is time to end the bickering over which study shows the most
connection between Agent Orange and certain illnesses and time to
begin helping Vietnam veterans,'' said Kerry, a former Navy
lieutenant who skippered a patrol boat in the Mekong Delta.
   George Claxton, a former Army sergeant who was, along with Maier,
one of the original plaintiffs in the San Francisco lawsuit against
the VA, said he is optimistic about prospects for change.
   ``I just want the satisfaction of seeing that people are treated
with justice and compassion,'' said Claxton, 46, of Lansing, Mich.,
who believes his exposure to Agent Orange caused bleeding colitis
and a nervous disorder.
   However, he added: ``Personally, I don't ever expect to be paid
back for what Agent Orange did to me. You pay a heavy price for
war.''

   One man's life work is hypnotizing frogs
into pumping iron, and one woman used to get her paycheck from Bozo
the Clown.
   ``Are we a little kooky?'' asks frog mesmerist Bill Steed. ``Look
at it this way. We work when we want to work, we make a fairly
decent living, we make people happy and we're happy ourselves.''
   Psychologist David Weeks agrees. In an upcoming book, he says
such people are among eccentric Americans who share many positive
qualities.
   ``Many of their personality traits add up to a very good recipe
for human happiness,'' said Weeks, of the Royal Hospital in
Edinburgh, Scotland.
   True eccentrics, he said, have a sense of humor, intense
curiosity, a high sense of integrity and a desire to make the world
better or at least happier.
   Weeks has been studying offbeat people for the past five years,
and in an earlier book, ``Eccentrics: The Scientific
Investigation,'' focused on Europeans. His new book is about
Americans, and about half his estimated 1,000 subjects are from
California.
   Weeks doesn't believe Californians are by nature flaky. But
California seems to take pride in its oddballs, he said in an
interview published in Sunday's San Jose Mercury News.
   ``It's very tolerant and proud and nurturing of eccentricity,''
he said. ``In some parts of the world, by contrast, eccentricity is
denigrated. In Sydney, for example, they call them ratbags. Not in
California.''
   Among Weeks' subjects was Steed, who lives in Emeryville across
the Bay Bridge from San Francisco and has toured the fair circuit
with 40 frogs and many laughs.
   His hypnotized frogs lie on their backs and lift tiny barbells
with their front legs.
   Diana Stoneberg is another Californian who became one of Weeks'
subjects.
   A former writer for Chicago's ``Bozo the Clown'' television show,
Stoneberg said being eccentric is ``quite complimentary.''
   ``I'd rather go down as an eccentric than as a routine, normal
person,'' she says.
   Sandra Miner of Los Angeles is an artist who sells religious
television programming from her home. She says her eccentricity ``is
meant to make everyone laugh and get a giggle.''
   One time, she said, she tried to get a giggle out of the
postmaster general of the United States by poking her finger in his
stomach and saying, ``Ding, ding, ding.''
   Weeks, 45, whose Scottish accent belies his New Jersey birth,
says eccentrics are curious because they're committed to whatever
they're doing.
   But theirs is not a neurotic preoccupation because ``they're not
really concerned about what other people think about them,'' he said.

<DATELINE>ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly six years after an army
firing squad killed Prime Minister Maurice Bishop after a military
coup, 17 people accused in the slaying still await a final verdict.
   Bishop's death in a factional struggle within his ruling party
helped lead to the U.S. invasion of the island in 1983. The
prisoners claim they were convicted in a U.S.-backed show trial to
justify the invasion and eliminate the remaining inner circle of
Bishop's Marxist regime.
   Of the 16 men and one woman, 14 are condemned to hang for murder.
Three soldiers charged with the actual shooting face decades in
prison for manslaughter.
   However, the prisoners are asking the Court of Appeal, Grenada's
highest court, to throw out their December 1986 convictions for the
killing of Bishop and several supporters.
   Their appeal has been dragging on since May 1988, straining the
tiny island's treasury and the patience of many of the nation's
90,000 residents, who have little sympathy for the prisoners.
   ``The people are fed up with it,'' said Leslie Pierre, editor of
the Grenadian Voice, an independent weekly newspaper. ``It's been
going on and on and on. ... They want it finished with.''
   The original High Court trial lasted nearly eight months, and it
took a year to produce a 9,000-page court record. The 13 defense
lawyers won a six-month delay to prepare the appeal.
   Seven months into the appeal, the president of the three-judge
court died, and the appeal had to start again with a new president.
   At the current pace, it will go on through fall because the
six-lawyer prosecution team hasn't even started its case.
   Meanwhile, the Grenadian government is paying court costs as well
as the fees and expenses of the 10 Jamaican lawyers representing
those prisoners who claimed indigency.
   So far, the case has cost the government $2.7 million, or 5
percent of the nation's annual $55 million budget.
   ``It's bleeding us, but we're prepared to spend that sort of
money ... so that we can say, `Look at the sacrifice we're prepared
to make,''' to give the defendants a fair trial, said Justice
Minister Danny Williams.
   The killing of Bishop, a popular prime minister, resulted from a
dispute over leadership of his radical People's Revolutionary
Government. A hard-line Revolutionary Military Council, led by
Bernard Coard, took control and placed the prime minister under
house arrest.
   On Oct. 19, 1983, hundreds of Bishop supporters converged on his
residence and set him free.
   However, troop reinforcements rushed in, allegedly on orders of
the military council.
   Bishop, three members of his Cabinet _ including his pregnant
mistress, Education Minister Jacqueline Cleft _ and four other
people were lined up against a wall and shot by three soldiers. A
witness said one assailant slit Bishop's throat long after he was
clearly dead and also cut off a finger to steal a ring.
   President Reagan ordered the invasion involving 1,900 U.S. troops
and small forces from other Carribean island nations. He said he
wanted to protect the lives of about 1,000 U.S. citizens in Grenada
and help restore democracy.
   Those on death row include Coard, Grenada's former deputy prime
minister; his wife, Phyllis; the former armed forces commander, Gen.
Hudson Austin; and the former ambassador to Cuba, Leon Cornwall.
   The prisoners have accused authorities of human rights abuses
ranging from withholding of sheets, blankets and underwear to
beatings, bread-and-water diets and long periods of solitary
confinement.
   Mrs. Coard, a former member of the ruling Central Committee who
wrote a book in prison called ``U.S. War on One Woman,'' claims she
has been held in solitary confinement for the past 4{ years and
allowed to see her husband only in court.
   Prime Minister Herbert Blaize scoffed at the prisoners'
allegations, and Terrence Marryshow, leader of the opposition
Maurice Bishop Patriotic Movement, called them ``only the victims of
a situation that they themselves created.''

   Three months have passed, and the sea still
coughs up dead birds with every change of the tide.
   Three months have passed, and an army of workers 9,000 strong has
yet to completely clean even one heavily oiled beach.
   Three months have passed, and the biggest oil spill in U.S.
history gets bigger every day, spreading its slime farther across
Alaska's wild southern coast, pushing its poison deeper and higher
along the food chain.
   ``We keep hoping for some kind of closure, some sign that this is
all the damage we have and we can deal with it,'' says Anne
Castellina, superintendent of Kenai Fjords National Park. ``But we
can't. The oil disappears one day when the waves clean a beach, only
to wash up on another beach the next day.''

were the first to be fouled after the tanker Exxon Valdez rammed a
reef March 24 and spilled almost 11 million gallons of North Slope
crude oil.
   But the damage didn't stop there. Streamers of oil and tar balls
leaked out between the sound's barrier islands and were pushed by
Gulf of Alaska currents to beaches 450 miles away.
   Oil now has tainted more than 700 miles of shoreline, from the
glacier-carved cliffs of Kenai Fjords to the clamoring bird
rookeries of Katmai National Park, from lonely Cook Inlet beaches to
the mouths of Kodiak Island salmon streams.
   Cleanup workers have found the oil-soaked bodies of about 26,000
sea birds, 784 sea otters and 57 bald eagles. The spreading oil has
other victims. Fishermen and other coastal residents who make their
living from the ocean cringe each week at news of more beaches
polluted and more fishing grounds closed.
   The wreck of the Exxon Valdez created an environmental
catastrophe that unfolds in one little tragedy after another:
   _A wildlife official filming damage on a beach sets a video
cassette down on a black rock, and the rock crawls away. It turns
out to be an oil-smeared duck.
   _A burly fisherman breaks into tears as he describes steering his
boat through the slick: no water lapping, no birds crying, just the
sickening silence of oil slipping past the hull.
   _At a bird rescue center in Seward, some of the patients are
failing. They have been washed clean, but not before swallowing
fatal doses of oil. They don't cry out; instinct tells them not to
advertise their distress to predators. ``They just get real quiet,
sit in a corner and die,'' says rescue coordinator Jay Holcomb.
   Like a candy bar in the hands of a 2-year-old, crude oil from the
Exxon Valdez has gotten onto everything.
   Rainbow sheens on the water stream from suffocating mats of black
goop on beaches. Wind and waves whip oil into a sticky froth that
workers call ``chocolate mousse.'' Tar balls bob in the surf,
washing ashore to melt in the sun and sink into the sand. Oil
splatters driftwood logs high above the tide line and sinks as much
as 3 feet into gravel beaches. Undulating blobs of oil hang below
the water's surface, ready to foul fishermen's nets.
   At first, Exxon boldly promised to clean it all up.
   ``We're going to pick up _ one way or the other _ all the oil
that's out there,'' Exxon spokesman Don Cornett told reporters one
week after the Exxon Valdez ran aground.
   The promise didn't keep for long.
   Exxon was too slow and the spill was too big for booms to contain
the oil immediately after the accident. And the company missed its
chance during the first few days to burn off large quantities of oil
or disperse it with chemicals. Some oil was skimmed up, but for the
most part Exxon had to wait for oil to wash up on shore, where the
goo could be scraped, wiped or flushed painstakingly from rocks and
gravel.
   By May 1, the clean-it-all promise had been modified. Exxon
proposed to clean 364 miles of coastline by mid-September, noting
that it might have to leave 191 additional miles of lightly oiled
shore to be washed by nature.
   The Coast Guard approved Exxon's plan, but even the limited
cleanup may prove beyond the company's capability, despite an
investment of more than $200 million to date.
   The cleanup effort now includes more than 9,000 workers, 800
boats, 45 oil skimmers, and 60 airplanes and helicopters. Hundreds
of workers clad in rain slickers and hard hats crowd into coves that
in most years might see a few fishermen or recreational boaters, if
anyone at all.
   Barges nose up to shore, carrying generators and boilers to heat
the water sprayed from hoses on the beach. Skimmers just offshore
pick up oil as it flushes off the beach, while yet more vessels tend
containment booms to keep the washed-off oil from spreading.
   Where there isn't enough machinery, workers hit the beaches with
shovels, absorbent pads and plastic bags, scooping and scraping and
wiping by hand.
   ``It has become pretty labor-intensive,'' says Exxon spokesman
Amos Plante.
   The Coast Guard, which is overseeing Exxon's cleanup effort, has
``signed off'' on about 50 miles of shoreline along Prince William
Sound. But that doesn't mean a beach is clean _ it just means Exxon
can move on. Even the most intensive scrubbing cannot touch oil
imbedded deep within a beach.
   The word ``clean'' is now taboo on official forms used to track
Exxon's efforts. Workers don't clean beaches anymore. They ``treat''
them.
   The difference is more than semantics, as a visit to a Prince
William Sound beach with a state environmental official shows.
``This,'' says Steve Provant as he kicks an oily rock, ``is a
treated beach.''
   Provant, the on-scene cleanup coordinator for the Alaska
Department of Environmental Conservation, is standing on a Green
Island beach known to officials as GR-1A. The Coast Guard signed off
on this beach May 29, declaring that Exxon crews had ``completed
removal of gross contamination.'' Provant saw it back then, and it
looked pretty good, he says.
   But now the oil is back. Globs of mousse litter the cobbled
beach. Rainwater beads up on the rocks as it would on the waxed hood
of a car. Provant digs into the sand, and his hand comes up greasy
brown.
   ``If you dig, you find oil down quite a ways,'' Provant says.
``You can see how much oil has been washed back in or has percolated
up from below. We're really not through with this beach.''
   Provant's agency hounds Exxon, suggesting ways the cleanup could
run more efficiently. Exxon, state and federal officials spend hours
each day arguing over how deeply to clean particular beaches, or
whether cleaning them will do more harm than good.
   ``Everybody wants a clean beach, us included,'' says Exxon's
Plante. ``The definition of clean is subject to interpretation. What
we're obviously going to do is work as hard to do the best job we
can. We may have some disagreements over whether it's sufficiently
clean.''

   While the arguments rage onshore, the death toll mounts at sea.
   Stymied by vast distances and stormy weather, bird rescuers have
been able to capture, clean and release only about 500 sea birds.
For every surviving bird, more than 50 dead ones lie in freezer vans
_ more than 26,000 in all. And that's just a fraction of total
mortality. Some biologists say that for every dead bird collected,
perhaps 100 have died unnoticed.
   Sea otters appear to be the hardest-hit marine mammal. The 784
dead sea otters collected so far represent about one-tenth of Prince
William Sound's total population. Harbor seals may be suffering,
too, but few carcasses have been found. ``Dead seals sink like lead
balloons,'' explains state marine biologist Kathy Frost.
   The oil's lethal reach extends down the food chain. On some
beaches, mats of oil have wiped out all life, suffocating intertidal
creatures such as limpets, mussels, crabs and starfish.
   And the oil reaches upward, to the tops of tall shoreside spruce
trees where bald eagles roost. Oiled sea birds have become a fatal
attraction for scavenging eagles, killing 57 of the birds of prey.
Biologists have collected lifeless eggs from 30 abandoned eagle
nests in the spill area.
   Hungry brown bears on the shores of Katmai National Park have
feasted on oily bird carcasses until they could eat no more, digging
holes in the sand to cache the leftovers.
   Bears are hardy creatures, but biologists have radio-collared 30
of them to study their reaction to swallowing so much oil. ``We
haven't determined what effect it has on them. But I can imagine
what it would do to me,'' says Katmai National Park Superintendent
Ray Bane.
   At the very top of the food chain are the humans who live close
to nature in coastal villages. When Aleut natives complained that
the oil spill kept them from gathering food through fishing and
seal-hunting, Exxon flew in cases of beef, chicken and diced ham. It
gave the villagers stomachaches.
   Many commercial fishermen have been idled by the spill, though
some have landed jobs with Exxon, leasing their boats at rates of
$3,400 a day and more.
   Most of the salmon and halibut swimming beneath the oil appear to
be surviving. But fisheries worth more than $110 million have been
canceled or postponed by Alaska officials worried that surface oil
might taint fish as they are hauled from the water in fishermen's
nets.
   As spring turns to summer, even Exxon officials are starting to
waver on the question of finishing the cleanup by mid-September, a
deadline long dismissed as unrealistic by some state and federal
officials.
   ``It's always a hope,'' says Exxon's Plante. ``But it's tougher
to predict whether we'll do it by then. That's our plan. We've
always said we will not leave it uncleaned, and if that means coming
back, so be it.''
   The sooner the better for all concerned _ particularly for 120
frisky sea otters now swimming restlessly in floating pens. They've
beaten the odds, thanks to rescuers at an otter hospital in Seward.
The animals are clean, healthy and ready to return to the wild.
   But they must stay put, biologists say, because the wild is not
ready for them.

   Oregon voters face a measure Tuesday
that urges Congress to let the state halt shipments of raw logs
overseas when domestic lumber mills are starving for timber and
workers' jobs are jeopardized.
   The ballot proposal, called Measure 2, seeks to ban export of
logs cut on state land and calls on Congress to make permanent a ban
of export of logs cut on federal land.
   Both supporters and opponents view Measure 2 as a symbolic test
of the public will with jobs at mills jeopardized by both the high
prices for raw logs and by environmentalist lawsuits aimed at
protecting the rare Northern spotted owl and the ancient forests
where they live.
   ``This is the first opportunity anybody in the United States has
had to say `We want timber jobs, we need timber jobs.' That's really
the issue on Tuesday,'' said Doug Stout, vice president for lands
and timber for Bohemia Inc., a lumber company in Eugene that has
contributed $100,000 in support of Measure 2.
   But because of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the same issue five
years ago, the options of Oregon voters are strictly limited. The
high court ruled that only Congress has the right to restrict trade,
declaring an Oregon law banning log exports unconstitutional.
   Because of the ruling, Congress would have to pass enabling
legislation for the state export ban to become effective, even if it
is passed Tuesday as most expect it will.
   The Bush administration is seeking just the opposite, having
proposed to lift a ban of exports of logs cut on federal land,
currently in effect on a year-to-year basis, to take advantage of
premium prices paid by log buyers in China, Japan and Korea.
   Within the timber industry itself, opinions are mixed. Many
companies make money exporting unprocessed logs, while others are
struggling obtain logs for their mills.
   The Pacific Rim Trade Association, which opposes export
restrictions, has decided to concentrate its efforts on defeating
the enabling legislation in Congress, rather than seeking victory in
Tuesday's referendum, said association executive director Rolf
Glerum.
   ``We didn't feel we could raise the money to fight'' Measure 2,
said Glerum. ``Even if we were to win it, it still wouldn't have any
effect. The whole thing is triggered by the Congress.''
   The group's members include Weyerhaeuser Co., the leading
exporter of raw logs in the Northwest, as well as stevedoring
companies, shippers and the International Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen's Union.
   ``One reason we oppose this is we feel it is the camel's nose
under the tent,'' said Glerum, because supporters ``would just as
soon see all log exports banned.''
   Indeed, a recent White Paper from the Oregon Natural Resources
Council pointed to stopping all log exports as a quick fix to the
timber supply crunch that has plagued Northwest mills the past year.
   Glerum and other opponents expect Measure 2 to pass. A recent
poll by The Oregonian newspaper showed support running more than
8-to-1.
   A campaign spending report from May 26 showed Citizens to Save
Oregon Jobs raised nearly $800,000 to push for passage, primarily
from non-exporting timber companies.
   ``We're talking primarily about Oregon logs for Oregon jobs,''
said Pat Amedeo, a lobbyist who serves on the steering committee for
the campaign. ``The big battle, because it is a non-traditional
election date, is to get enough voters to the polls.
   ``I think in terms of sending a message back to Washington, D.C.,
which is part of what the ballot measure does, the more people who
vote, the more significant the message.''
   State Rep. Bernie Agrons was one of the few voices in the
Legislature opposing the measure.
   A former vice president of Weyerhaeuser, Agrons said the measure
would deprive the common school fund and counties of revenues from
state timber.
   Last year, $12.5 million in state timber revenues went to the
common school fund and $18.3 million went to local governments,
predominantly schools. Export logs are generally considered to bring
a premium price about 25 percent higher than domestic logs.

<HEAD>Troubled Tom Bradley Readies for Fifth Inauguration</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mayor Tom Bradley prepared to be sworn in
Friday for an unprecedented fifth term, but investigations into his
finances and ethics are putting a damper on party plans.
   The inaugural party, to be held on the south lawn of City Hall,
is expected to be ``a day of celebration and at the same time
reflection,'' said Bill Chandler, a mayoral spokesman.
   The 71-year-old Bradley rose through the ranks of the police
department and City Council to become the first black mayor of a
major U.S. city when he defeated Sam Yorty in 1973 following a
bitter campaign.
   These days, Bradley points with pride to the city's emergence as
the gateway to the Pacific Rim, as the successful host of the 1984
Summer Olympic games and to a downtown redevelopment effort.
   In April's non-partisan primary, he defeated City Councilman Nate
Holden with 52 percent of the vote, just enough to avoid a general
election.
   Bradley was expected to soar past Holden, but found himself
wounded by disclosures about his financial ties with savings banks
that do business with the city.
   Newspaper reports prompted the city attorney to begin a
conflict-of-interest investigation on March 31. The state Fair
Political Practices Commission later joined the investigation.
   Deeper digging into Bradley's investments yielded questions about
whether he had traded political favors for preferential treatment at
Drexel Burnham Lambert, the investment banking firm. This in turn
prompted inquiries by the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
   In a surprise address to the City Council on May 10, the taciturn
Bradley said he made ``an error in judgment by engaging in outside
employment.'' But Bradley maintained he did nothing illegal, and
said he expects to be vindicated in the still-pending inquiries.
   Since the speech, Bradley has maintained silence about details of
his investments, denying interview requests.
   The spurt of disclosures about Bradley appears to have tapered
off in recent weeks, although investigations apparently have gone in
new directions. One trail, which ran to Drexel investments by House
Majority Whip Tony Coelho, led the California Democrat to resign.
   Bradley's amalgam of labor, minority and business support has
remained largely intact throughout the controversy, although his
influence over the City Council has diminished.
   Some say one barometer of the mayor's strength is with his
proposal to the council last year to raise the cap on Community
Redevelopment Agency spending downtown to $5 billion from $750
million. The money would be spent on revitalizating blighted parts
of downtown; expanding child care, services for the homeless; and
building affordable housing for low-income residents.
   The council is considering creating an oversight committee for
the agency, cutting into the mayor's control. A hearing is scheduled
for Tuesday to discuss how much power such a committee would have.
   Even Bradley's friends say the mayor doesn't hold as much clout
as he once did.
   ``There's no question that (Bradley) has been tarnished by the
many stories, some of which I regard as frivolous and some bordering
on yellow journalism,'' said William Robertson, executive secretary
of the Los Angeles AFL-CIO and a longtime Bradley political ally.
   ``It's been my experience that politicians, and especially a
powerful politician, when he's in trouble, the sharks smell the
blood and they go for the jugular,'' Robertson said.
   But Robertson has continued to support Bradley, calling him a
``person of high integrity.''
   ``Judgments shouldn't be made until all the issues have all been
thoroughly explored,'' he said.
   ``There is not a feeling that it's all over,'' Bradley confidante
Richard Riordan said of the mayor's career. ``He's held his head up
high through all of this.''
   Still, Riordan conceded, ``You have a feeling underneath that he
knows that he's walking more carefully and not twisting arms as
forcefully as he might've in the past.''

   In a pinch, you can fly a plane.
   At least that's what instructors in a unique eight-hour flying
course try to convince pilots' spouses and others who might be
forced to fly and land a plane in an emergency.
   It is rare for a heart attack, food poisoning or other sudden
illness to disable a pilot in mid-flight. But it happens once or
twice a year, and sometimes with dramatic results as air traffic
controllers help a novice find an airport and safely land.
   The ground school instructor in a recent course sponsored by the
Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association's Air Safety Foundation asked
Anne Kennedy, 52, of Graysonville, Md., how she felt about the
prospect of taking the controls of her husband's Mooney 201.
   ``I'm scared to death,'' she said.
   But after four hours of flying with an instructor in the
``pinch-hitter'' course that has taught 35,000 non-pilots the
fundamentals of flying, Mrs. Kennedy said, ``I feel a lot different
about our little plane. I think I understand it better.''
   While the course covers only small planes, Bob Carter, who is in
charge of flight instruction for the foundation, said that in the
unlikely event an airliner's flying crew was disabled, he'd ``go
with the odds'' and ask a trained pinch-hitter to take the controls.
   One student described herself as a former stewardess and said she
took the course because ``if you can work the back end of a plane,
you should be able to work the front end.''
   Another trainee, Julie Zuckerman of Bradford, Pa., told the class
that after her husband's parents were killed in the crash of their
small plane, her husband, David, stopped flying for more than 10
years.
   She bounced the family's Piper Archer twice on the runway before
bringing it down undamaged with a little help from her pinch-hitter
instructor.
   ``I thought it was nerve-wracking,'' Mrs. Zuckerman said. ``But I
loved taking off. I never thought it was so easy and so much fun. I
think I could land it if I had to.''
   Martha Carter of Scranton, Pa., who survived a crash with her
husband four years ago, said she thinks the course is a necessity
for a pilot's wife. But after the crash it took him a while to
convince her to take the class, she said.
   Once in the air, people who have never flown a plane find it
deceptively simple. A push forward on the steering yoke and the
aircraft descends. A pull back and it climbs. Steering left or right
is almost like steering a car, but on the ground, steering is done
by foot pedals, not the yoke.
   Engine speed is controlled with a hand throttle, but trainees
often forget that putting the plane into a descent will also speed
it up and climbing will slow it down.
   The four-hour ground school aims to build confidence, but it also
includes a basic explanation of what makes a plane fly and a
description of its parts and instruments.
   Started in 1961, the weekend course is taught about 20 times a
year, each time at a different airport around the country.
   Richard Busch, flight training director for the foundation, said
about a third of the trainees go on to get pilot licenses. Only a
handful ever actually have to fly with a disabled pilot, Busch said.
   In 1983, pinch-hitter graduate Jane Turner of Phoenix was in the
right rear seat of her husband's plane when he suffered a heart
attack and died. A 78-year-old woman, Edith Merrill, was sitting by
the right-side controls, but the owners and pilots group gave Mrs.
Turner an award for taking over the radio and coaching and assisting
Mrs. Merrill through a safe landing.
   It takes 40 to 60 hours of flying to qualify for a regular pilot
license and costs $3,500 to $4,000.
   The pinch-hitter training costs $240, not including use of an
aircraft. Trainees are encouraged to use the plane they regularly
ride in as a passenger, but they also may rent one.
   Ideally, the course culminates in the pinch-hitter landing the
plane unassisted by the instructor.
   ``I'm not really sure how much control I had over the plane in
that final landing,'' Mrs. Kennedy said after completing the course.
   ``If, God help me, the time ever comes when I have to fly on my
own, then ... well, God help me,'' she said.

   British punk rock star Billy Idol must pay
nearly $23,000 in medical expenses and damages to a woman who was
trampled during one of his concerts, an arbitrator has ruled.
   Lucy Hammond, 31, was sitting in the second row at Memorial
Coliseum for the May 13, 1987, concert when she was trampled by a
crowd that rushed the stage at Idol's invitation, according to court
documents.
   Idol called to the crowd, ``I'm lonely. Come on down here.''
   Hammond's lawyer, Michael Casey, said his client was knocked to
the floor and pinned under folding chairs while the crowd stepped on
her. She suffered multiple sprains and contusions.
   Clifford B. Olsen, a retired Multnomah County circuit judge who
was the arbitrator, said in the June 15 ruling that Idol acted ``in
deliberate disregard of the safety.''
   Idol, whose real name is William Broad, said in his deposition
that he didn't remember the concert.

   Voters in this luxury resort gave
Dutch brewery tycoon Alfred H. Heineken approval to tear down a
72-year-old villa that some wanted to preserve as a historic
monument.
   Eighty-five percent of the 1,431 voting residents rejected a
proposal to bar destruction of the Villa Boehler, according to
official results Sunday.
   Heineken, 65, touched off protests in 1984 when he asked
authorities to allow removal of the villa, which he bought for a
reported $2.7 million the year before.
   He said the ``revolting yellow monstrosity'' partially obstructs
the view from a house on adjacent land that he bought decades ago,
and sought approval for replacing the villa with an annex to his
multimillion-dollar pied-a-terre.
   Hans Rutishauser, chief curator of monuments in Grisons canton,
argued the villa, built for an Austrian industrialist by renowned
German architect Heinrich Tessenow in 1917, is unique and should be
officially protected.

   Senators facing re-election in 1990 have cut
down on privately financed travel that sometimes takes them to
pricey resorts, according to a study of financial disclosures.
   The group, comprising almost a third of the Senate, took 179
privately financed trips in 1988 compared with 223 in 1987.
   Such travel _ usually paid for by corporate and trade
associations _ has been severely criticized this year by members of
Congress and private organizations.
   The Associated Press study of 33 senators was based on travel
statistics compiled on the full Senate by Congress Watch, an
organization founded by consumer advocate Ralph Nader that culled
the data from 1988 Senate financial disclosure reports filed last
month.
   Senators are required to list all reimbursed travel expenses
totaling at least $250. The lawmakers were not surveyed on why the
number of trips dropped.
   While legal, the trips leave members in potential conflicts of
interest involving special interest groups that are pushing for
passage or defeat of legislation. The invitations often include
airfare, several days at a resort or top-of-the-line hotel, and
expenses for a spouse.
   Task forces in both houses are considering whether to eliminate
speaking honoraria in return for a congressional pay raise, but an
end of those fees _ up to $2,000 per speech _ would not necessarily
prevent privately funded travel.
   ``Many of these junkets are designed to give lobbyists the chance
to fraternize with lawmakers, frequently at pricey resorts, and
provide special interest groups with yet another opportunity to gain
access and influence with members of Congress,'' said Joan
Claybrook, head of Congress Watch's parent group, Public Citizen.
   Those who traveled frequently, however, probably have little to
fear from the voters, according to two political scientists, Norman
Ornstein associated with the American Enterprise Institute and James
A. Thurber of American University.
   ``I don't think it will be a devastatingly effective campaign
weapon in 1990,'' said Ornstein, unless the travel has caused a
senator to miss votes.
   ``You're going to have much more luck slamming a guy for doing it
on public expense than at the expense of private interests,''
Ornstein said. ``The public reaction is, `We don't give a damn if
it's taken out of special interests, but don't take it out of our
pockets.'''
   Thurber said there were few studies on voters' reaction to
congressional trips, but added it was his ``gut reaction'' that the
trips ``play almost no role in the way they evaluate the performance
of a member of Congress.''
   The AP found that among those whose current six-year terms are
winding down:
   _Eighteen traveled on fewer privately paid trips in 1988 than in
1987, while 10 increased their travel and five had the same number
of trips in both years. The ratio becomes 18-9 in favor of reduced
travel when Sens. William Armstrong, D-Colo., and Gordon Humphrey,
R-N.H., are subtracted from the list. Both have announced their
retirement.
   _The gap in the number of trips is greater, 164 in 1988 compared
with 223 in 1987, without Sen. James A. McClure, R-Idaho, who listed
no trips in 1987 and 15 in 1988.
   _Six senators facing re-election were among the top 15 privately
financed travelers in the Senate. They are Democrats Joseph R. Biden
Jr. of Delaware, 24 trips; J. James Exon of Nebraska, 23 trips, J.
Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, 21 trips; Sam Nunn of Georgia, 21
trips; and Republicans Mark Hatfield of Oregon, 24 trips, and Alan
K. Simpson of Wyoming, 21 trips.
   Public Citizen found that all senators took more than 1,100
privately financed trips during the 100th Congress, led by John
Breaux, D-La. with 37; Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, 34; Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., 33; Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., 30 and Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, 29.
   Senators who did not accept privately paid travel during the
period were Sens. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas; Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.; John
Danforth, R-Mo.; Humphrey and Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.

   Communist rebels raided a mountain
village in a remote area of Mindanao island and massacred about 30
people as they worshipped in a Protestant church, the military said
Monday.
   The raiders beheaded three people, including a Protestant
minister, before fleeing, the report said.
   Lt. Col. Cresencio Maralit, spokesman for the Philippine
Constabulary, said the incident occurred early Sunday in the village
of Rano, about 640 miles southeast of Manila.
   Maralit said many of the villagers had joined an anti-Communist
vigilante group and had refused to pay ``revolutionary taxes'' to
the communist New People's Army.
   According to Maralit, about 40 members of the Ubo and Bagobo
tribes had gathered inside a United Church of Christ chapel for
morning worship when about 100 guerrillas arrived.
   Guerrillas exchanged gunfire for about 15 minutes with members of
the congregation, who were armed, Maralit said.
   Maralit identified the dead pastor as Abadi Ayap. But a
denomination official in Manila said records indicated no such
pastor by that name.
   Bishop Erme Camba, secretary-general of the denomination, said
the victim could have been a lay pastor. The bishop said he was
still trying to verify the report.
   The United Church of Christ has been widely criticized by the
military for alleged links with Communist rebels because of the
denomination's outspoken stand on human rights.
   In the past, most beheadings in Mindanao have been carried out by
religious fanatics who are frequently used by the military to fight
the Communists.

   At 400 pounds, Sen. Dixon Hall Lewis of Alabama
was the weightiest person ever to serve in Congress.
   Lewis, a Democrat who served first in the House, then in the
Senate, was so heavy he had difficulty finding a carriage driver
willing to take the risk of hauling all those pounds.
   Once, wrote Isaac Bassett, the Senate's assistant doorkeeper for
much of the 19th century, Lewis ``got into a hack and went right
through the bottom, onto the ground _ and if the horses had not been
very tame he would have been killed.''
   Sen. Lewis _ and the extreme rotundity of his profile _ is
presiding this summer over the marble-clad rotunda of the Russell
Senate Office Building, looming from a balcony in the form of a
giant, shadow-casting silhouette.
   Lewis and the silhouettes of six of his senatorial colleagues of
his era form the somewhat whimsical background of an exhibit
illustrating the triumph and travail experienced by the Senate in
its first 100 years, 1789-1889.
   Born in 1802, Lewis served in the House for 15 years. He was
appointed to the Senate in 1844, dying four years later.
   Bassett, who made good use of his powers of observation during
his 60 years of service to the Senate, noted that Lewis rarely rose
from his specially constructed and commodious chair to address the
Senate.
   Bassett wrote that Lewis told him the reason ``was that he was so
big and fat that I would have to fan him, and it would not look very
dignified in such a body as the Senate.''
   But if Lewis was an infrequent speaker, he did listen intently to
the major addresses of others.
   On Jan. 26, 1830, he walked across the Capitol and joined the
throng crowding into the chamber of the Senate, determined to hear
Sen. Daniel Webster of Massachusetts defend the federal union.
   The ``enormous'' congressman was given a seat in the tiny lobby
behind the presiding officer's chair where he became wedged in by
other spectators.
   Because he was separated from the chamber by a painted glass
screen, he could hear Webster but could not see him.
   Describing the scene, Bassett said the frustrated congressman
``deliberately pulled out his knife and removed the obstructing
paint on the glass.''
   But the operation ``caused quite a noise,'' Bassett said.
``Everybody was looking to see where that scratching came from.''
   Finally, Bassett said, Lewis cleared an area ``as large as a
man's hand,'' obtaining a ``good view'' of the famous Webster.
   The senatorial silhouettes, originally made on paper during the
1840s and 1850s and now reproduced larger than life, bring together
an unuusal cast of characters.
   Joining Lewis in larger-than-life profile is, for example, Sen.
John Randolph of Virginia, a thin, stick-like figure described as
``one of the most brilliant, deranged and pathetic men ever to serve
in the Senate.''
   Randolph was known to stride into the Senate followed by a pack
of hunting hounds while flicking a riding crop and drinking a cup of
beer.
   Abusive in speech, he once provoked a duel with Sen. Henry Clay
from which both men emerged unscathed.
   Randolph lived to be 99, dying in 1833 just days before his 100th
birthday.
   Also on the railing above the rotunda floor is a far less
colorful lawmaker, Sen. Felix Grundy of Tennessee, who was described
by doorkeeper Bassett as a consummate insider and master of
parliamentary tactics.
   Near Grundy is Sen. John Forsyth of Georgia who cut a more
visible public swath with blistering oratory and cutting wit.
   Informed that President Andrew Jackson's opponents were forming
the new Whig party, Forsyth remarked:
   ``It is a glorious name, and I have no doubt they will disgrace
it.''

<HEAD>Indiana Jones And the Truth About the Holy Grail</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Holy Grail may not exist but it's a
proven moneymaker.
   Scholars say the makers of the blockbuster movie ``Indiana Jones
and the Last Crusade'' are just the latest to cash in on the search
for the impossible icon.
   A 12th century abbot was the first to claim he had found the cup
that Jesus used at the Last Supper, and his monastery became the
wealthiest in England, according to Eckehard Simon, professor of
Germanic medieval literature at Harvard University.
   The Grail has since inspired romantic poems in several languages,
a Wagner opera and even a Monty Python movie.
   But it hadn't been a subject for archaeologists until filmmakers
Steven Spielberg and George Lucas decided to dispatch their
swashbuckling searcher for antiquities played by Harrison Ford.
   In the movie, Dr. Indiana Jones sets out in search of his father
(Sean Connery), who has disappeared while hunting for the Holy
Grail. Together, they outsmart Nazi plunderers who are after the
Grail because they believe anyone who drinks from it will gain
immortality.
   The truth about the Holy Grail is tangled in centuries of legend,
stretching from the Druids to Adolf Hitler.
   ``Indiana Jones'' screenwriter Jeffrey Boam said the different
strands of Grail lore were so contradictory he chose among them and
made up the rest.
   The three knights guarding the cup are Boam's creation, for
example, as is the notion that the Grail could not be taken from its
resting place in an ancient temple in Jordan.
   There is, however, some evidence that the Nazis were interested
in the Grail.
   Hitler used it in speeches as a metaphor for Aryan racial purity.
Boam said Lucas discovered Hitler's interest in occult artifacts
while making ``Raiders of the Lost Ark.'' Boam's research turned up
reports that the Nazis had looted a monastery in France in hopes of
finding the Grail.
   Simon and other scholars said the Grail myth flourished in 12th
century England, though it has roots in earlier Celtic mythology.
   According to the legend, Joseph of Arimathea used the chalice
from which Jesus served the wine at the Last Supper to catch his
blood during the crucifixion.
   The apocryphal story has it that Joseph eventually brought the
Grail to the monastery of Glastonbury _ a tale the abbot of
Glastonbury, Henry de Blois, promoted.
   ``If you had a precious relic, people would come on
pilgrimages,'' Simon said. ``They also managed to fabricate the
story that King Arthur was buried there, and also that they had
Excalibur,'' Arthur's sword.
   ``It was a tremendous publicity stunt, and it made Glastonbury
the single wealthiest monastery in England until the Reformation,''
he added.
   Grail tales also were written in medieval French and German.
   One legend had the Grail coming to rest in the south of France,
and by the 15th century, a French king had a collection of grail
cups, according to popular book on the subject, ``Holy Blood, Holy
Grail.''
   A German version inspired Richard Wagner to write the opera
``Parsifal'' in 1882.
   Hollywood took up the trail in 1954, when Paul Newman played a
sculptor who made the cup for Jesus in ``The Silver Chalice.''
   There is, however, no evidence the Grail existed, Simon said.
   The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York does have a figured
silver cup that was once said to be the Grail. The Antioch Chalice,
discovered in Syria in about 1910, was exhibited at the 1938 World's
Fair, said curator Jane Hayward of the Cloisters, which once owned
it. But the chalice was made 500 years after Jesus' birth, and
scholars never believed the claims, she said.
   Still, the Grail persists as a symbol of purity, faith and
resurrection.
   ``The Holy Grail has come to take on a far greater meaning than
the object itself,'' said Boam. ``It stands in for perfection, or
any goal people might have.''

<HEAD>Justice Investigates Kansas Company Accused of Stealing Oil From
Indians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Kansas-based company faces a criminal
investigation based on allegations that it stole oil from
Indian-owned wells, according to a spokesman for a Senate committee.
   The Justice Department probe stems from information about Koch
Industries Inc. gathered by a special investigating committee of the
Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs, spokesman Sam Hirsch said.
   ``This has been referred to the U.S. attorney,'' George Pearson,
a spokesman for Koch, based in Wichita, Kan.
   Pearson said Koch officials and representatives of the U.S.
attorney in Oklahoma City will meet before a formal investigation
begins, although no date has been set for the meeting.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Nancy Jones, in Oklahoma City, said her
office can ``neither confirm nor deny the existence of an ongoing
investigation.''
   The special Senate committee focused on Koch, the country's
largest independent oil purchaser, at a May 10 hearing in which
witnesses said Koch employees purposely mismeasured oil from wells
on Indian lands.
   In a 57-page statement issued June 8, Koch said the committee
``unjustly defamed Koch and caused severe damage to its reputation
and business.''
   The 49-year-old company said the figures the committee used in
its allegations were inaccurate, and that comparisons with other
companies were based on noncomparable statistics.
   The committee used ``anecdotal evidence which was misleading at
best and false at worst'' at the hearing, the Koch statement said.
   But Hirsch said the committee stands by its findings.
   ``The committee's investigators caught Koch employees in the act
of stealing oil on six separate occasions,'' he said. ``Koch gaugers
and supervisors also admitted to committee investigators that it was
company policy to mismeasure oil.''
   Hirsch said documents the committee subpoenaed from Koch and
almost 30 other companies corroborated the committee's findings. He
said the committee will review Koch's June 8 statement before making
its final report, sometime this fall.
   The special committee has been investigating all areas of Indian
affairs and came upon the Koch case while probing federal agencies
assigned to protecting Indian lands.

<HEAD>Lobbyists Vying to Represent Zaire President in US</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zaire President Mobotu Sese Seko's poor human
rights record isn't deterring Washington lobbyists from scrambling
to represent the wealthy leader, who visits Washington this week.
   ``People see Mobutu as the gold at the end of the rainbow,'' said
Ed Van Kloberg, whose lobbying and public relations firm recently
signed a two-year contract to lobby for Zaire government interests
at $300,000.
   The effort to win Mobutu's approval provides a glimpse into the
often-murky world of Washington lobbyists, where high-priced public
relations consultants compete to put the best face on foreign
leaders and businesses.
   Mobutu has reputedly amassed a large personal fortune during the
24 years he has ruled Zaire.
   He is an appealing target for entrepreneurs claiming they can
open doors for him in Congress and get him favorable media coverage
despite Zaire's poor human rights record and allegations of
widespread corruption.
   ``People promise Mobutu they can change things here for him, open
doors, and then they can't deliver,'' said Van Kloberg, who
represents several Third World countries with unpopular reputations
in the United States.
   His company has been seeking to bolster congressional support in
advance of the Mobutu visit, especially in light of the shrinking
budget for U.S. aid to Africa.
   The competition to represent foreign leaders sometimes leaves
congressional staffers and State Department officials confused, such
as when they were told several months ago by two rival lobbying
firms that each was organizing Mobutu's visit.
   Their confusion was compounded when it transpired that the better
known and more prestigious of the two _ the partnership of Black,
Manafort, Stone and Kelly _ had not been picked. But officials at
that company say they are still negotiating to represent Mobutu.
   Lobbyists representing foreign governments must register with the
Justice Department, where the files show that many contracts to
represent Zaire lasted only a year.
   It's not unusual for governments to switch lobbyists, but the
turnover rate for Zaire is believed to be particularly high.
   One company, Weaver International Corporation, was paid $500,000
just to promote foreign investment in flora and fauna culture
projects in Zaire.
   Aside from the paid lobbyists, there is a network of unpaid
officials, many of them businessmen, who know Mobutu and take on
tasks for him.
   One example is Mamadi Diane, whose company has a U.S. government
contract to ship food aid to several African countries. Diane helped
set up a recent visit to Zaire by 17 black mayors of U.S. cities.
   The trip, paid for by Zaire's government, may have done more
damage than good. It incurred the wrath of many black mayors opposed
to Mobutu's repressive tactics and his ties with the white
government of South Africa.

<HEAD>`Taxpayer Bill of Rights' Takes Effect This Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Individuals and businesses will have more legal
protection in disputes with the Internal Revenue Service, under
provisions of the ``Taxpayer Bill of Rights'' taking effect this
week.
   Starting on Saturday, the IRS will have to provide more advance
notice before acting to seize property for back taxes, and more
wages and property will be exempt from seizure. Starting July 7,
taxpayers may appeal to block a seizure that was erroneously filed
by the IRS.
   The provisions that take effect this week are aimed at helping
taxpayers who owe delinquent taxes and are subject to IRS collection
procedures.
   Other parts of the new law already are in operation. Key
provisions require the IRS to provide taxpayers a written statement
of their rights, prohibit the agency from promoting employees on the
basis of how much money they collect, and require the IRS to drop
any penalty that resulted from a taxpayer relying on written advice
from the agency.
   The bill of rights was enacted last October after congressional
committees compiled evidence of abuses by some IRS officials and
denial of basic rights to taxpayers. Although most taxpayers will
never have a need for the new law, since they will never be audited
or receive a notice of delinquent taxes, those who do run afoul of
the IRS may find it tips the balance a bit more in their favor.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., chief author of the law, once called it
a measure ``basically geared for that small business, that
mom-and-pop drugstore down on the corner, that someday might get
behind a little behind with their taxes or might want to say that `I
want to go in to the IRS and admit a mistake that I just found'''
without being penalized.
   The accounting firm of Pannell Kerr Forster put it another way:
``The Taxpayer Bill of Rights is an attempt to balance the rights
and responsibilities in tax matters.''
   Here are the key provisions about to take effect:
   _The IRS will have to notify a taxpayer 30 days before filing a
notice that it intends to ``levy'' or seize wages, bank accounts or
other property. The old law required only a 10-day notice. If the
taxes are still unpaid and the taxpayer has not worked out an
installment payment plan when the 30 days are up, the notice may be
issued without further notification.
   _A bank must wait 21 days after receiving notice before turning
an account over to the IRS. After that period, the bank is free to
hand over the money plus interest earned during the delay. However,
the bank may not give the IRS more than the total of the levy.
   The agency noted that it has been automatically delaying seizures
in cases in which there is any doubt as to the actual owner of the
account. The IRS imposed this rule on itself after the widely
publicized seizure of a child's small bank account that was listed
with a parent's Social Security number.
   _Up to $1,550 worth of food, fuel, furniture and personal
household effects will be exempt from levy, an increase of $50.
Also, $1,050 worth of a worker's ``tools of the trade'' are exempt
(up from $1,000). The new law shields from seizure a bigger portion
of a worker's wages, equal to the total of his or her standard
deduction and personal exemptions divided by 52.
   _If a taxpayer believes a lien was filed erroneously _ for
example, because the IRS did not follow the law or the delinquency
was paid off before the lien was filed _ it may be appealed.
However, there is no appeal if the taxpayer simply disputes the
amount of alleged delinquency.
   _The IRS can be sued for actual damages if the agency knowingly
or negligently fails to remove a tax lien when required.

<HEAD>North Trial Judge Faces Decision on Juror Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in Oliver North's Iran-Contra case
faces a decision remarkably similar to one he made a decade ago in a
case where a juror withheld significant information from the court.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell has scheduled a hearing for
Wednesday focusing on North trial juror Tara Leigh King's failure to
disclose that four of her brothers and sisters had been involved
with the courts.
   In a 1978 city corruption case, Gesell ordered a new trial for a
top mayoral aide and parking lot magnate after it was disclosed that
a juror had a checking account at a bank founded by the magnate,
Dominic Antonelli. Antonelli and his co-defendant were acquitted in
the retrial.
   The juror also had failed to tell defense lawyers that her father
worked for Antonelli's firm and had been fired from the company. The
juror said she hadn't known of his employment at Antonelli's firm,
although she acknowledged knowing her father was employed by another
parking company in town.
   In the North case, King responded negatively on a pre-trial
questionnaire when asked whether she or any members of her immediate
family had ever been involved in a court proceeding or in an
investigation. One brother had pleaded guilty to armed robbery.
   Gesell ordered North's lawyers, who raised the allegations of
juror misconduct against King, to prepare a detailed account of when
they learned of the information.
   The prosecution says that under federal court rulings a defendant
may not learn of alleged juror misconduct during a trial, ``gamble
on a favorable verdict by remaining silent,'' and then complain in a
post-trial motion.
   North was convicted May 4 of aiding and abetting an obstruction
of Congress, destroying government documents and accepting a $13,800
home security system as an illegal gratuity from Richard Secord.
North had enlisted Secord to secretly run arms to the Contras.
   North's sentencing has been postponed until July 5 pending a
decision on the matter.
   In the 1978 case before Gesell, Antonelli and Joseph P. Yeldell,
an aide to then-Washington Mayor Walter E. Washington, had been
convicted of conspiring to arrange a government lease of a building
from a partnership controlled by Antonelli.
   Antonelli and Yeldell, now the director of the city's office of
emergency preparedness, were found innocent of bribery and
conspiracy in their second trial before a federal court jury in
Philadelphia. Gesell presided in that trial as well.
   Antonelli was represented by Edward Bennett Williams of the firm
Williams &amp; Connolly, the same law firm representing North.

<HEAD>Florida's Novel Gun Safety Measure Raises Question of Enforcement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACKIE HALLIFAX</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Threatening to lock up adults who don't
lock up guns sends a strong message, but police and prosecutors
question whether a first-of-its kind bill approved in Florida will
prevent accidental shootings.
   ``We do feel there will be some difficulty in enforcement since
it will take a child committing some dreadful act before law
enforcement becomes aware that he or she had access to a weapon,''
said Tom Berlinger, director of operations for the Florida Sheriff's
Association.
   Monroe County State Attorney Kurt Zuelch, president of the
Florida Prosecuting Attorneys Association, also expressed concern
that ``the prevention issue hasn't been totally dealt with.''
   Accidental shootings that killed three children since June 5
prompted the Legislature to pass the bill during a special session
Tuesday. Gov. Bob Martinez is expected to sign the measure into law
this week.
   Gun owners who fail to secure loaded weapons in homes or
businesses could face charges if children ages 15 and younger hurt
someone with the firearms. The maximum penalty under the bill would
be five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.
   Lesser penalties would apply if the child brandishes the gun in
public or threatens others with it.
   The bill exempts police officers and military personnel and does
not apply in cases where the guns were obtained illegally, such as a
burglary.
   The bill requires gun-shop owners to post a sign explaining the
law and to give customers a written warning. The measure also
directs the state Department of Education to develop a gun-safety
education program that lawmakers can consider by next spring.
   Gun lobbyists were divided in their appraisal of the legislation.
   ``What they've got now is a public relations bill,'' said William
Berger, a Sarasota resident who has urged passage of a stricter
version of the legislation since March 1987 when his 9-year-old
stepson was accidentally killed by a friend.
   Berger was disappointed that the bill filed by Rep. Harry
Jennings, a retired Army colonel, was ``watered down,'' but said
getting a weaker version passed was still ``a battle won in that I
know parents ... went out and bought a padlock.''
   Bernard Horn, state legislative director of Handgun Control Inc.
in Washington, called the bill a significant victory that would
quickly save lives.
   ``It makes people understand what's expected of them when they
keep a loaded gun in the house with children,'' Horn said.
   Gun-shop owners in Florida say locks and safety boxes have gone
from being overlooked accessories to one of the most sought-after
items since lawmakers passed the law.
   But Richard Gardiner, who directs state and local legislative
affairs for the National Rifle Association in Washington, said the
bill only repeats what is already covered in criminal negligence
laws throughout the country.
   ``We don't have any objection with it ... because it doesn't
change anything,'' he said.
   Gardiner said there's no need for the bill anywhere. He said the
NRA would look at laws that may be proposed in other states
individually.
   Handgun Control plans to promote the Florida bill as model
legislation around the country, according to Horn. The organization
is chaired by Sarah Brady, wife of President Reagan's Press
Secretary Jim Brady, who was shot in the 1981 assassination attempt
on Reagan.
   A call for similar gun-control action was made Friday by
Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Scott McCallum following a rash of shootings in
that state. Lawmakers from about a dozen states have expressed
interest in Florida's legislation, according to Horn.
   ``I'm sure that this is going to be introduced in quite a number
of legislatures,'' Horn said. ``And what's the NRA going to do? They
can't say, `Oh, it's not a good law for Michigan or Ohio or
Illinois' when they agreed to it in Florida.''
   Firearms are the fourth leading cause of accidental deaths in
children under age 16, according to the National Safety Council, a
private non-profit organization. Automobile accidents, drownings and
fires are the top three.

<HEAD>USDA, States Help Promote Organic Farming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates of organic farming are generous in
their praise, saying it is a way for crop producers to make money
and save the environment at the same time.
   Even the Agriculture Department, which had been rather stodgy
about producing wheat, corn, soybeans, vegetables and other crops
with reduced or eliminated doses of chemicals has adjusted.
   Numerous conferences and research efforts have marked USDA's new
journey into organic farming, but it was Congress in the 1985 farm
law that really gave the department its marching orders, along with
a $4 million appropriation later on.
   The department even used a new term _ Low Input Sustainable
Agriculture, or LISA _ to include what had been loosely referred to
as organic, sustainable or alternative methods of farming.
   Comparatively, USDA is doing much more today in programs to help
small farmers and to assist both large and small producers find
alternative methods of production. By using less commercial
fertilizer and pesticides, it is hoped that producers can reduce
costs and thereby improve profits.
   But a Washington-based, non-profit advocacy group, the Center for
Science in the Public Interest, says organic and low-chemical
farming ``is flourising at the state level'' while the federal
effort is moving slowly.
   A new study by the center found that half the states have
``significant activities to promote sustainable agriculture,''
including strong efforts in California, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota,
Texas and Wisconsin.
   ``Here in Washington, proponents have to scratch and claw just to
hang on to a tiny $4.45 million sustainable agriculture program that
the Bush administration and the chemical lobby want to kill,'' said
Dan Howell, author of the center's report.
   ``In contrast,'' he said, ``states are spending more money on a
greater variety of ambitious programs to increase the production and
marketing of foods grown with few or no synthetic pesticides and
fertilizers.''
   Other studies by advocates of low-input agriculture support
claims that crop yields often are comparable to those from
chemically treated land after a practice has been established and
crop rotation carried out.
   But Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau
Federation, said, ``If it were as simple as reducing purchased
inputs and reaping the rewards, it would have been in practice years
ago.''
   Farmers are willing to adopt proven methods that result from the
low-input concept, he recently told a Senate agriculture
subcommittee. But the technology must be based on more than a whim
and a promise.
   ``Farmers cannot afford to take big risks with a new and unproven
technology,'' Kleckner said. ``As we see it, LISA programs represent
a long-term goal for agriculture.''
   Kleckner said some aspects of LISA have shown good results, such
as ``integrated pest management'' to reduce the amount of pesticides
on crops by being more selective and careful about timing during the
season.
   In New York, he said, pest management reduced the amount of
pesticide used on apples by 38 percent and on onions by 31 percent.
Texas farmers were able to reduce pesticide use on carrots by 66
percent and on cabbage by 44 percent.
   At present, Kleckner said, low-input farming ``is still more a
philosophy and spirit of farming than an easily defined set of
principles.''

   The Agriculture Department has some summer
advice about dogs and cats.
   ``That old bromide about hot weather discomfort tells us that
horses sweat and men perspire, and ladies gently glow,'' says the
department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. ``If you're
a pet owner, however, you should know that dogs and cats do none of
the above.''
   Instead, they pant. And agency experts say that can lead to
deadly consequences if left unchecked.
   ``Each year, hundreds of pets die of heat, usually because their
owners just aren't aware of how quickly heat can kill,'' said
veterinarian Dale Schwindaman, who heads the agency's animal care
staff.
   ``If you leash your dog outside, make certain it can move easily
to a shady spot. Make plenty of water available to it as well,
especially if you'll be away from home for long periods.''
   Pets should never be left unattended in a vehicle, he said. And
cracking a window an inch or two will not adequately protect an
animal. Heat in a car can rise to 160 degrees in a very short time.
   As for car trips, Schwindaman said that for a highly nervous
animal even a brief ride can be a severe strain in hot weather.
   ``This is especially true if your pet is an indoor cat or dog who
would be frightened simply by the surroundings and noise of an
unfamiliar environment,'' he said. ``In this case, if the trip is
absolutely necessary, the pet owner should make every effort to
transport the animal in an air-conditioned vehicle.''

   An Agriculture Department report shows that
catfish production continues to rise unabated, with May production
up 42 percent from a year earlier to 28.9 million pounds.
   Through the first five months of 1989, production was 141.2
million pounds, a 15 percent increase from the same period of last
year, the report said.
   Despite the larger output, catfish farmers are getting more for
their product, averaging 76 cents per pound in May, up a penny from
a year ago.

   Are Oreos politically correct?
   More than 400 shareholders of Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade Inc. debated
that question and other issues more related to politics than profits
at the ice cream maker's annual meeting last weekend.
   Shareholder Ross Connelly of Hardwick complained that the board
of directors of such a socially conscious company shouldn't be ``all
white and all male.''
   Company co-founder Ben Cohen said efforts were being made to
rectify the problem.
   Shareholder Elizabeth Kmon of Massachusetts questioned the
company's use of Nabisco products such as Oreos in some of its ice
cream flavors. She said she boycotts Nabisco because the company is
owned by a cigarette maker, R.J. Reynolds.
   Ben &amp; Jerry's officials said they're looking for a substitute for
Oreos, but have not yet found another cookie that remains crunchy
while submerged in ice cream.

   Telling your chihuahua to chill out might be
easier if you fed it ``Frosty Paws,'' a new ice cream for pampered
pooches.
   The invention, which looks like baby formula and tastes terrible
to humans, took a licking Saturday at one Hollywood supermarket.
   ``Molly's eaten four so far,'' said a woman whose West Highland
white terrier slurped up the chilled treat.
   However, a 4-year-old sheltie turned up his nose at the desserts
lined up on a sidewalk.
   ``He's just not the type of dog who eats on the road,'' the owner
said.
   ``Frosty Paws'' was created by William Tyznik, an animal
nutritionist at Ohio State University.
   Tyznik said he began six years of work on the product after
reading a 1983 survey that showed 61 percent of dog owners feed
their pets ice cream.
   Tyznik said dairy products can ruin a dog's digestive system. His
formula contains dried whey and dried whey protein concentrate,
dried skimmed milk, soy lecithin, vitamins and minerals.
   Frosty Paws was intentionally made foul-tasting to humans so
children would not try it, Tyznik said. A package of four cups sells
for $1.29.

   Mayor Edward I. Koch isn't much of a betting man,
but maybe he ought to be.
   During a Saturday campaign swing in Queens, Koch told the 75
patrons of an Off-Track Betting parlor to put their money on his
initials in the sixth race at Belmont Park.
   Much to his delight, the E-K combination proved a winner.
   ``The mayor was very happy. ... He sees it as the kind of
coincidence that he hopes and expects to be repeated this fall,''
said Lee Jones, a mayoral spokesman. The Democratic primary will be
in the fall.
   The mayor, who limits his betting to buying an occasional Lotto
ticket, reaped no financial gain from the E-K combination, Jones
said.

   Zoning officials didn't object to the
golden pyramid or the shark-filled moat. But they had enough when
Jim Onan put a 45-foot statue of a pharoah on his front lawn.
   The town took him to court under a zoning ordinance that puts a
25-foot limit on structures in residential neighborhoods.
   The 52-year-old Onan, a construction contractor, decided on a way
of getting around the regulation: He's burying the 200-ton statue of
Ramses II in gravel up to its knees.
   Onan says he intends to spend $25,000 to bury all but 25 feet of
Ramses II.
   ``I love it because they're making a fool of themselves,'' Onan
said in a telephone interview from his pyramid home Friday.
   The choice of Ramses II is fitting: He ruled Egypt from 1290 to
1224 B.C., and was known for his ambitious building projects _ much
like Onan.
   Onan completed his 5-story-tall, gold-plated pyramid five years
ago near Wadsworth, a town just south of the Wisconsin border.
   Townspeople haven't exactly rallied to Onan's defense in the
statue case.
   ``I don't think there's anyone who had anything good to say about
it,'' said Village President Ed Tomkowiak.

<HEAD>Non-nursing Mothers Don't Need Anti-Swelling Medication, FDA Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health officials are concerned that
each year more than 700,000 non-nursing mothers are being put
needlessly at risk with prescriptions for drugs and hormones to
prevent painful breast swelling.
   The Food and Drug Administration plans to meet soon with several
pharmaceutical companies to ask them to stop marketing the
medications to prevent breast engorgement after childbirth.
   An FDA advisory council concluded earlier this month that mild
painkillers and breast-binding are as effective as these medications
in easing the discomfort and carry none of the health risks.
   ``Nature takes care of the problem very quickly,'' usually within
two or three days after childbirth, said Susan McKay, a Wyoming
psychologist who is on the advisory panel. Yet, doctors are treating
the condition with medications that have to be taken for two weeks,
she said.
   ``Why are we subjecting women to this if after a few days it will
resolve itself anyway?'' she said.
   Panel members also said evidence showed that only about 10
percent of women who don't breast-feed have significant pain in
their breasts from the accumulation of milk. But, they said, even
these women can be treated without drugs and hormones.
   Philip A. Corfman, executive secretary of the advisory council
and FDA's supervisory medical officer for fertility and maternal
health drugs, said voluntary compliance by the pharmaceutical
companies is the first and preferred step.
   The FDA isn't seeking to ban the drugs and hormones. The
medications have other FDA-approved uses for which medical
specialists agree they are valuable.
   But the agency may meet resistance from the companies. Although
some of the companies said they have not been contacted by the FDA
and would not comment on the impending request, their leaders defend
the safety and effectiveness of their products.
   Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. of East Hanover, N.J., which makes
bromocriptine, sold under the name Parlodel and the most widely used
of the medications, proposed to the FDA revised package inserts to
inform physicians of alternative therapies and brochures to educate
women.
   ``We feel it should be a free choice by an informed patient and
her physician,'' said David L. Winter, a spokesman for Sandoz.
   About 40 percent of women who give birth don't breast-feed, and
Winter said a company study found that 36 percent of these women
have pain in their breasts after delivery.
   Bromocriptine has been taken by more than 4 million women during
the nine years it has been on the market, and though it has been
found to cause minor side effects _ including nausea and dizziness _
no serious adverse effects have been proven, he said.
   Critics, however, note that there have been a small number of
reports of heart attacks, strokes and seizures associated with use
of the drug.
   Use of estrogen and androgen hormones and their combinations have
been shown to raise the risk of blood clots, Corfman said.
   But William Donaldson, a spokesman for Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals Inc., defended the safety of TACE, an estrogen
marketed by the company. The company has had four reports of
blood-clotting problems, but none has been reported since 1975, he
said.
   ``If there are patients who are suffering that cannot be relieved
in other ways, the drug works and it is safe and it is another
product for physicians to prescribe,'' he said.

<HEAD>Study Finds Population Pressure Leads to Political Turmoil</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Population pressures threaten to disrupt
political and social conditions in many nations, according to a new
study that finds Japan the world's most stable nation and Mauritania
the most unstable.
   The report from the private Population Crisis Committee, released
Sunday, put the United States in the ``moderate'' category, losing
ground to 16 countries rated as more stable because of this nation's
ethnic conflicts and high rate of youth unemployment.
   The analysis by Sharon L. Camp, Marshall Green and Patricia G.
Barnett noted that ``rapid population growth, especially when
overlaid with sharp ethnic divisions, places enormous strains on
political institutions.''
   ``Not surprisingly the two most deeply troubled areas of the
globe are Africa and the Middle East, with the world's highest
growth rates,'' commented Green, a retired ambassador.
   The analysis was compiled by rating a variety of factors and
totaling the results.
   Population growth rates, movement to urban areas, the age
structure of populations, growth of the labor force and presence or
absence of ethnic and language division in a country were the major
population factors considered.
   The study took into account changes in government over the last
30 years or so, political freedoms, civil liberties, ethnic or
religious conflicts and an estimate of the satisfaction or
frustration of youth in a country.
   Mauritania, situated astride the Sahara desert and the dry Sahel
steppe region in West Africa, led the list for instability with a 95
score out of a possible 100. It also ranked high in separate
population pressure rankings, scoring 71 out of 100.
   Rounding out the five most unstable nations were Ethiopia,
scoring 87; Zaire, 83; and Burundi and the Sudan, 81 each.
   All five have been through several governments and all but Zaire
scored the maximum in communal violence, with bitter conflicts
underway in several of these countries. All five also ranked high in
the study of population pressures.
   On the 100-point instability scale, Japan accumulated only 13
points and was also near the bottom of the population pressures
study.
   The United States, by comparison, accumulated 31 points in the
instability analysis.
   Both nations managed a top ranking of 1 point for government
changes, political and civil rights.
   In the category of ethnic and religious conflicts, however, while
Japan had one point the United States was given 10 of a possible 20.
   And, in the dissatisfied youth category, unemployment hurt the
U.S., which scored 18 out of 40 possible points, compared with 9
points for Japan.
   Countries falling between Japan and the United States were
Norway, 18; Switzerland, 20; Italy, Denmark and Australia, 21 each;
Sweden and Belgium, 22 each; West Germany, 23; Venezuela, 24; Costa
Rica, 25; Jamaica, 28; Netherlands, 29; and Greece, Canada and
Botswana, 30 each.
   Tied with the United States at a rating of 31 were Spain and
France.
   The committee, which advocates family planning, said, ``It is
clear from trends widely evident in the world that rapid growth of a
country's population, along with its maldistribution, will impose
great strains on existing political, social and economic structures
and on relations between nations.''
   Of 120 countries studied, 101 showed a relationship between
population pressures and political stability, the group concluded.
It said only a handful of governments with rapid population growth
have maintained stable governments with good records on civil and
political rights, notably Botswana, Jamaica, Costa Rica, Gambia and
Venezuela.
   China, where student attempts to promote democracy recently ended
in military violence, scored a 57 rating on the index, placing it in
the ``high'' category for instability.
   That score may be too low in light of recent events, the
committee said in an addendum issued with the report.

<TEXT>
   In their latest move to toilet train the people,
authorities plan to fine those who fail to flush after using public
lavatories.
   Beginning July 1, first-time offenders may be penalized as much
as $77. Repeat offenders caught neglecting to flush three or more
times may have to pay as much as $515.
   Public toilets are defined as those to which the public has
access, including those in hotels, department stores, cinemas and
restaurants. The Environment Ministry says many people simply are
not flushing after use.
   Government campaigns to improve public hygiene in this city-state
of 2.6 million people are not new. A Clean Public Toilets campaign
was first mounted in 1983. A team of health inspectors was deployed
last year, but offenders merely received warning letters.
   The deteriorating state of public toilets and anti-social
bathroom behavior receive much attention in this country, which uses
the slogan ``clean and green'' to describe itself.
   A survey of 3,550 public toilets turned up ``a problem of users
showing no consideration for the next person,'' said Richard Lim of
the Environment Ministry.
   The Straits Times newspaper last year targeted ``toilets of
shame,'' singling out by name, photograph and location
``particularly disgusting facilities.'' Both the newspaper and the
Environment Ministry installed telephone hotlines for complaints.
   Many apartment blocks have become high-rise slums with elevators
reeking of urine and corridors filled with trash.
   The elevator problem became so bad that the Housing Board
installed a sophisticated monitoring system in some buildings.
   Sensors activated by the high salt content in urine stop the
elevator, activate a video camera hidden in the ceiling and alert
the janitor. The trapped offender is supposed to be turned over to
police.
   Dozens of culprits, aged from 7 to 79 and including at least one
woman, have been flushed out so far. They face a fine of $1,030,
three years in jail and a flogging of from three to eight lashes.

<HEAD>Majority Leader Sees No Need To Reopen Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some questions about the Iran-Contra affair may
never be answered, although new details may come out in the upcoming
trials of John Poindexter and Gen. Richard Secord, says Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell.
   The Senate Intelligence Committee's report on why some White
House documents on the Iran-Contra affair were not turned over to
Congress does not warrant reopening the overall inquiry, Mitchell
said Sunday.
   ``There is no basis at this time, in my judgment, for a
resumption of the investigation or for the creation of a new
investigation,'' Mitchell said.
   ``Obviously, there are loose ends,'' he said in an interview on
NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
   ``Not every single question has been answered and every one may
not be answered,'' said the majority leader, who served on the
special Iran-Contra investigating committee. ``But there comes a
question of balance in terms of whether one should or should not
reopen the investigation.''
   Mitchell said more about Reagan's role in the funneling of
proceeds from arms sales to Iran to the Contras likely will surface
during the trials of Poindexter, who succeeded Robert McFarlane as
national security adviser, and Secord, a former Air Force general.
   The Maine Democrat had asked the Senate panel to examine why
congressional investigators never saw the six previously undisclosed
White House memos when copies surfaced during the trial of former
national security aide Oliver North.
   The intelligence panel reported Friday that the White House
sometimes handled documents in a chaotic and haphazard manner when
Congress sought them for its Iran-Contra hearings two years ago. But
the committee said there was no evidence of a calculated cover-up by
the Reagan administration.
   Among those documents was a Feb. 19, 1985, memo to former
President Reagan from then-National Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane.
   The memo recommended that Reagan write Honduran President Roberto
Suazo to reaffirm U.S. support for Contra rebels in Nicaragua and
pledge U.S. help in defending Honduras if Nicaraguan troops crossed
its border.
   Located in an informal ``heads of state'' file in a box of papers
at Reagan's presidential library in California, the document
suggested a ``quid pro quo'' arrangement with Honduras that has been
denied by President Bush. At the time, Congress had banned direct
U.S. aid to the Contras.

   House Armed Services Committee members are
looking for money in the Pentagon budget to keep a new helicopter
and a new fighter, and lawmakers say funds intended for the B-2
bomber and Star Wars are likely targets.
   The Armed Services Committee will be working this week on the
$295.6 billion Pentagon budget, and Rep. Albert G. Bustamante,
D-Texas, said some of the money ``has to come out of the system.''
   He predicted B-2 funds will be cut and that ``SDI (Strategic
Defense Initiative) will take a big hit _ $1.6 billion to $1.8
billion.''
   Several committee members are seeking restoration of money for
the V-22 Osprey helicopter and the F-14D Tomcat fighter jet, both
slated for burial in Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's proposed budget.
   Reps. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., and Marvin Leath, D-Texas, plan
to introduce an amendment Tuesday that would provide an additional
$1.2 billion for the National Guard and reserves. The current $69
billion procurement budget earmarks about 3 percent for reserve
forces, Montgomery said.
   Reps. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., and Thomas Foglietta, D-Pa., meanwhile,
have convinced members of the Armed Services research and
development subcommittee to save the Marine V-22 Osprey with $351
million that had been earmarked for the B-2 bomber.
   In closed session, the panel voted 11-7 to approve the amendment,
according to Weldon and Foglietta.
   The Osprey, the Marine Corps' revolutionary tilt-rotor aircraft
that takes off like a helicopter but can fly like a plane, has
widespread support in Congress, especially among former Marines and
members from Pennsylvania and Texas where the Osprey is built by
Boeing Helicopter Co. and Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.
   Opponents of the stealth bomber, considered the most expensive in
history at a cost of between $500 million and $650 million a copy,
sounded off against that program last week.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, appealed to Cheney to suspend production because the B-2
has yet to undergo flight testing.
   The estimated fiscal 1990 cost for the B-2 is $4.7 billion and
over a three-year peak spending period the pricetag is $24 billion.
   ``The Department of Defense has produced a B-2 program that won't
fly financially,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the
House Armed Services panel.
   The Pentagon has invested about $22.4 billion in the B-2 program,
which is expected to cost about $70 billion to complete. Cheney
indicated last week that initial flight tests of the bomber will be
conducted by the end of the summer.
   In addition to focusing on B-2 funds, members are looking at the
proposed $4.9 billion for Star Wars, formally known as the Strategic
Defense Initiative.
   Bennett and Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., joined with 31 Republicans and
Democrats earlier in this month in calling for $3.1 billion for Star
Wars in fiscal 1990 rather than the $4.9 billion proposed by the
administration.
   ``Our amendment will help restore that balance. It will mean more
tanks, more planes and more ships while providing for a robust SDI
program,'' Ridge said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development
has reportedly halted or is reviewing payments to nine mortgage
companies that finance federally backed housing in its coinsurance
program.
   The action is part of an attempt to head off another potential
scandal for the agency, which is the target of congressional
investigations involving allegations of influence-peddling in HUD
housing contracts, The Washington Post reported today.
   Coinsurance permits private lenders to earn lucrative fees by
making mortgage loans to federally backed housing programs. But HUD
assumes most of the losses if a project defaults. The program is
designed to encourage the preservation and rehabilitation of
moderately priced housing.
   HUD has approved a four-month moratorium on new participants for
the program, the Post said, after a recent review by the HUD
inspector general found mismanagement and alleged fraud in the
program. Almost $700 million worth of mortgages are in default, it
said.
   Three lenders were thrown out of the program in March and six
others were put on six-month probation, the Post said.

<TEXT>
   Lonnie A. Bassett, secretary-treasurer of the
Sheet Metal Workers' International Association, AFL-CIO, died in New
York City of a heart attack, the union said. He was 62.
   Bassett died Saturday on his return from Denmark, where he was
serving as a delegate to the International Metalworkers' Federation,
the union said Sunday.
   Born April 26, 1927, in Alabama, Bassett joined the
Washington-based sheet metal workers' international office in 1961.
In 1970 he became director of the union's organizing, where he
served until 1985. That same year he was appointed
secretary-treasurer.
   A statement by the Sheet Metal Workers' International Association
described Bassett as an ``outspoken advocate for the need to
establish programs upgrading members' skills to better compete for
jobs.''
   Bassett is survived by his wife, Marie; his children, Donald,
Johnnie, Marie Elaine Bassett Snow, Lonna Gwen Bassett; his
brothers, Charles, George, John; his sisters, Dorothy Hall and
Juanita Nicholson; and nine grandchildren.

   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen Monday,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange moved slightly higher.
   The dollar closed at 140.18 yen, down from Friday's close of
140.35 yen. It opened at 139.80 yen and ranged between 139.75 yen
and 140.50 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
205.74 points Friday, added 95.11 points, or 0.28 percent, to close
at 33,625.82.
   Currency traders said trading was generally inactive and
directionless during morning trading, lacking fresh market-affecting
news.
   ``Market players sitting on the sidelines are unable to determine
which direction they should move,'' said Masafumi Koyama of the Bank
of Tokyo.
   Koyama said some institutional investors were buying back dollars
following the loss of a conservative party candidate in a
by-election for a seat in the parliament's upper house Sunday.
   A socialist who campaigned by criticizing Japan's new 3 percent
consumption tax and attacking the governing Liberal Democratic party
over an influence-peddling scandal won the election in Niigata,
northwestern Japan, for the House of Councillors.
   Local news media said the result would be a blow to the
pro-business Liberal Democrats, whose popularity has been damaged by
the consumption tax and a number of scandals. Elections for half the
seats of the 252-member upper house are scheduled for next month.
   On the stock exchange, dealers said the share prices at first
rose over expectations of lowering interest rates in the United
States, but market participants then took a wait-and-see position,
observing the exchange rate fluctuations and reactions to Sunday's
election.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet submarine was on fire off Norway's
northern coast early Monday, spewing thick smoke but sailing east at
half-speed toward the the Soviet naval base at Murmansk, Norwegian
officials said.
   The Soviet news agency Tass initially reported that the vessel
was sending distress signals. But Norwegian officials said later
that crewmen on deck waved away Norwegian rescue helicopter and
appeared ``relatively relaxed.''
   It was not immediately known if the vessel was nuclear-powered or
carrying nuclear weapons.
   ``A Norwegian F-16 fighter ... reported a submarine of unknown
type that was billowing heavy smoke 110 kilometers (70 miles)
northwest of South Island in (the province of) Finnmark,'' Defense
Minister Johan Joergen Holst said on state radio. He said alerted to
the fire at 3:30 a.m. (1:30 a.m. EDT).
   Holst said the submarine was probably carrying nuclear weapons.
   Tass, in its initial report on the fire, did not say what type of
submarine was involved. It said a Soviet reconnaisance plane had
been dispatched.
   Gunnar H. Angletweit, a Norwegian Defense Ministry spokesman,
said later that the submarine was sailing east at half-speed toward
the Soviet Northern Fleet Base at Murmansk.
   A Norwegian rescue helicopter dispatched to the area spotted
several crewmen on deck, but they waved the Sea King helicopter
away, said Terje B. Lien, an official of the Rescue Coordination
Center at Bodoe, Norway.
   He said that the helicopter's crew had apparently mistaken for an
emergency flare a signal that the submarine did not want help. The
rescue center said it canceled orders to Norwegian merchant marine
vessels to sail to the area.
   Col. Gullow Gjeseth, Norwegian Supreme Defense Command spokesman,
said the Soviets appeared to have the situation under control with
rescue efforts from Murmansk.
   ``The crew who were on deck were reported to be relatively
relaxed,'' he told NRK, the state broadcasting company.
   Gjeseth said earlier that the Norwegians had dispatched coast
guard vessels, some equipped to test for radiation.
   ``We must reckon on there being nuclear weapons on board,'' said
the defense spokesman, adding that it is impossible to tell what
armaments are being carried from surveillance photographs.
   It was the second Soviet submarine reported in distress near
Norway since April 7, when a Soviet MIKE class nuclear submarine
caught fire and sank in the Norwegian Sea, killing 42 Soviet seamen.

<HEAD>General Accused Of Drug Trafficking Also Blamed for Ivory, Diamond
Smuggling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HAVANA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defense minister has told a military tribunal
that a highly decorated general accused of trafficking in cocaine
also smuggled ivory and diamonds and should receive a punishment
that sets an example.
   The 47-member tribunal was to hold a second closed-door session
today to consider the case against Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa, who is
alleged to have been involved with Colombia's Medellin drug cartel
for three years.
   The tribunal of top-ranking officers is to decide if the general
is to be stripped of his rank and ordered to stand trial on the
charges.
   With his voice at times rising in anger, Gen. Raul Castro told
the tribunal on Sunday that Ochoa's actions ``represent an outrage,
a stab in the back to the fatherland and a slap in the face.''
   He said Ochoa should receive ``punishment that sets an example''
because he was such a highly regarded officer.
   Gen. Castro is the brother of Cuban President Fidel Castro.
   Ochoa, 57, is one of only five officers who hold the medal of the
Hero of the Republic of Cuba. A veteran of the Cuban revolution, he
was decorated for his service as a field commander of Cuban troops
in Angola.
   Gen. Castro's allegation about ivory and diamond smuggling
represented a new dimension in the biggest scandal to rock Cuban
power circles in 30 years of Communist rule. Authorities say Ochoa
was the ringleader of officers who let cocaine smugglers use Cuban
military air bases and arranged escorts for drug-carrying boats.
   The defense minister's speech was broadcast on on state-run
television during the evening newscast, which devoded 40 minute to
the hearing. A newscaster said eight witnesses, all military
officers, also testified.
   Gen. Castro said fellow officers had disapproved as early as 1970
of Ochoa's joking manner and frequent bragging about business deals.
They suspected corruption, but it was not proven until later, he
said.
   ``Only he could explain, if he has been able to explain it to
himself, how this process occurred in which his highest aspiration
becomes transforming himself into a typical capitalist
businessman,'' Gen. Castro said.
   He also accused Ochoa of demoralizing officers in Angola by
saying, ``They have sent me to a lost war so that they can hang the
defeat on me.''
   The Cuban troops were sent to Angola to back a Marxist government
in its fight against a rebel insurgency. A cease-fire in the
conflict took effect over the weekend.
   Ochoa sat with his head bowed and a tense look on his face during
Gen. Castro's speech.
   After Ocho's arrest June 12, Cuba reported that 10 other military
officers and government officials were accused of accepting bribes
from drug traffickers.
   U.S. prosecutors say the names of some of the Cuban officers had
surfaced in a U.S. investigation of a smuggling ring that culminated
in two indictments and a 1988 trial.
   On Saturday, the Cuban military announced that it would shoot
down private planes that violate Cuban airspace and refuse orders to
land for inspection. The announcement said Cuba intended to stop
drug-smuggling planes from using its airspace.
   The official Granma newspaper has said U.S. allegations about
Cuba being a way station for cocaine traffickers prompted Castro to
order the investigation that led to the arrest of Ochoa and the
other officers.
   A Foreign Ministry official, asked about reports that U.S.
officials want to talk to Ochoa, did not rule out the possibility.
   ``These things are from top level to top level,'' the Ministry
official said. ``This sort of thing has been done before.''

<HEAD>Survivor of Auschwitz Slain Over Swastika</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Auschwitz survivor was beaten and stabbed to
death after confronting a man he had accused of scrawling a swastika
on his door, police said.
   Max Kowalski, 72, was found dead Saturday in the second-floor
apartment of Ruben Martinez Zucarino, 36, who was charged with
second-degree murder, said police spokesman Sgt. Maurice Howard.
   An arraignment was scheduled for today.
   A popular man known as ``the mayor of Brighton Beach,'' Kowalski
spent his days in a rented room at the Brooklyn boarding house
tinkering with old televisions and radios and talking with friends
about his native Poland.
   ``This isn't the way God wanted it,'' said Philip Solsky, a
72-year-old neighbor.
   ``He was a friend in a Jewish neighborhood who should never have
died with a swastika or violently.''
   Kowalski, a Jew whose family perished at Auschwitz, came to the
United States in 1949 and worked as a carpenter. He survived the
Nazi death camp and his wife also is a Holocaust survivor.
   ``She figures that he survived everything else, and then for this
to happen,'' said Kowalski's 38-year-old son, Lenny.
   ``The guy might have stabbed him, but the war still killed him,''
the son said. ``It was the insignia that did it. If it hadn't been
there, this never would have happened.''
   The younger Kowalski said he was visiting with his father
Saturday morning in the workshop when he noticed the swastika and a
skull and crossbones scrawled in blue felt-tip pen on the door.
   His father quietly washed the marks from the door, the younger
Kowalski said.
   The son complained to the landlady, Tuey Chin, who said that when
she asked Zucarino about the graffiti he was holding a marker of the
same blue color in his hands. But he told her he knew nothing about
the drawings.
   A short time later, the elder Kowalski went to Zucarino's
apartment, where he confronted him about the swastika and grabbed
him by the throat, police said.
   A fight ensued. Zucarino stabbed Kowalski repeatedly with a
scissors and a fork and smashed a religious statue over his head,
killing him, police said.
   Ms. Chin said Zucarino may have attacked Kowalski with a
5-inch-high metal Statue of Liberty. She said he showed her the
statue after the attack.
   ``I'm not sure if he hit Max over the head later with the Statue
of Liberty or a religious statue,'' she said. ``But there was a
Statue of Liberty all right. Brass, bronze, whatever.''

   Advocates for AIDS patients hailed a
proposal by the chief of federal AIDS research to allow for greater
distribution of experimental drugs.
   Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, recommended the development of ``parallel
track'' testing under which patients would have access to promising
drugs as soon as they are proved safe, even while tests for
effectiveness were under way.
   ``It's a great step forward,'' said Dr. Mathilde Krim, a founder
of the American Foundation for AIDS Research. ``It represents a new
consensus on how to handle drug development for AIDS and
life-threatening diseases in general.''
   Martin Delaney, co-director of Project Inform, a group of AIDS
activists, said he planned to ask a committee of the National
Academy of Science today to endorse Fauci's idea.
   In a speech Friday, Fauci called for the ``compassionate
distribution'' of trial drugs to ineligible applicants.
   ``It's clear to me that we cannot just rely on the traditional
approach of clinical trials,'' Fauci said during a talk at the HIV
Treatment Awareness Week conference. HIV stands for human
immunodeficiency virus, which causes acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   Clinical trials are designed to test the effectiveness of drugs
that have been proved non-toxic. Test subjects must meet strict
requirements that typically exclude many applicants.
   ``We've got to rethink the rigidity with which we exclude
people,'' he said.
   Fauci said drug companies, the federal Food and Drug
Administration, and AIDS patients must consider the possibility of
parallel track testing.
   ``It's not something that any one person or organization has the
ability to make happen because you're involving the public and
private factions,'' he said. ``The critical thing is this can't
happen by fiat. It's a concept.''
   Fauci, a staunch advocate of clinical trials as the only means to
discover definitive scientific answers, emphasized the continued
need for rigorous studies.
   Part of the need for parallel tracking stems from the limited
availability of drugs to treat AIDS, Fauci said. Similarly, the drug
trial process is slow and limited and leaves out many patients who
are eager to try experimental drugs.

<TEXT>
   The mother of Siamese twins who just celebrated
their fifth birthday says there is no tragedy in her two girls being
joined together.
   Marlene Cady wrote in this week's People magazine that when a
stranger walks up to Verena and Ruthie and laments the youngsters'
fate, ``I always tell those people that the only tragedy is in their
interpretation of the girls' situation, because obviously Ruthie and
Verena are happy kids.''
   The girls, born April 13, 1984, are joined from the collarbone to
the waist and share a heart, liver and parts of the intestines.
   Sharing a heart makes the girls tire easily and they are more
susceptible to infection than most children.
   Mrs. Cady, whose family lives near Providence, R.I., said that
when the girls had pneumonia at age 9 months, she and her husband,
Peter, found themselves talking about their lives as ``now or after
the girls die.''
   ``But when we celebrated their first birthday, we realized that
we could wait for things to change until we were 105 years old, but
then we would have spent the time waiting instead of living,'' Mrs.
Cady wrote.
   She said the children have distinct personalities _ Ruthie is
stubborn while Verena likes to make sure she's doing the right thing.
   The girls have mastered feats that doctors thought impossible.
When they perfected riding a special tricycle, ``they rode up and
down the street for three days, knocking on doors and ringing bells
to make sure everyone knew about their new treasure.''
   The twins' older sister, Maria, had been upset at all the
attention the twins got but then realized they are special, their
mother said.
   ``Sometimes I feel sorry for my sisters being attached because
they don't always want to do the same thing. But when they aren't
arguing, I think they're very lucky to be together,'' Maria said.
   Conjoined twins occur about once in 100,000 births. About half
die within 48 hours of birth.
   Mrs. Cady said that when she thinks ``about how long they might
live, it's in terms of a couple of years. We live for the present.''

<HEAD>NRC Spurned by Three Seabrook Officials on Shutdown</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal inspectors told three Seabrook
nuclear plant officials to shut down the reactor before the
directive was obeyed, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   But Noel Dudley, senior NRC inspector at the plant, denied that
agency officials had to grab anyone to get a response, as alleged by
a Seabrook critic.
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said Friday NRC Chairman Lando Zech
and other commission officials told him an NRC inspector grabbed a
plant operator before Thursday's unplanned shutdown.
   The Boston Sunday Globe reported details of the shutdown based on
interviews with Dudley, plant officials and others. The shutdown, on
the 10th day of low-power tests at the $6 billion plant, prompted
the NRC to suspend further tests pending a review.
   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon said he will ask an
NRC appeal board to stop the tests until safety issues for
full-power operation are reviewed.
   ``The NRC pointed to those same problems a year ago after a mock
evacuation exercise,'' Shannon said.
   Plant spokesmen said neither the plant nor the public was
endangered.
   But Markey said the results could have been much worse at higher
power.
   ``It's very frightening to think what would have happened if this
plant had been operating at 70 to 80 percent of full power and there
had been no NRC people in the control room,'' he said.
   Thursday's events, plant officials say, began when a
malfunctioning valve on the non-nuclear side of the operation
produced changes in readouts from a part called a pressurizer on the
nuclear side. The change was sufficient to warrant a shutdown,
spokesman Ron Sher said Sunday.
   One NRC inspector and then Dudley approached three plant
officials pointing out the problem, but got no immediate results,
the Globe said. Minutes later, an operator did shut down the plant.
   ``They were making a conscious decision to attempt to regain
pressure control'' even though plant procedures called for a
shutdown, Dudley said.
   An unidentified NRC inspector first approached Seabrook's startup
manager about the pressure reading, the Globe said.
   When the manager did not respond, the NRC inspector approached
the test director, who was closer to the scene in the control room,
and the director agreed the plant should be shut, the paper said.
   But according to the newspaper, the test director then talked to
the shift supervisor, a higher-ranking official, who said that
pressure problem was being corrected on its own and there was no
need to turn off the plant.
   Dudley stepped in at that point, approaching a still higher
Seabrook official, the assistant operators manager, said NRC
spokesman Steve Horwitz.
   The assistant manager consulted the operations manager, who
acknowledged the information and deferred to the decision of the
shift supervisor to continue to operate, Horwitz said.

<TEXT>
   Oregon's congressional delegation and governor
unanimously agreed on a plan that protects some of the nation's
oldest trees and a rare breed of owl.
   Logging officials and environmentalists have until Tuesday to
decide whether to back the plan, which also permits logging
old-growth forests.
   Representatives of the timber industry and environmental groups,
brought together by the politicians, met during the weekend for the
first time outside courtrooms in the five-year dispute that has
restricted logging of ancient coastal evergreens.
   If the proposal is accepted, it would for the first time allow
legislative protection of the Pacific Northwest's most significant
stands of old-growth forest, which range from 200 to 1,000 years old.
   Environmentalists have obtained injunctions on behalf of the rare
northern spotted owl. The injunctions have prevented logging in
federal lands that are usually open for loggers in Washington and
Oregon.
   There are fewer than 6,000 of the owls, which can survive only in
old-growth forest. Conservationists say continued logging is leading
to the bird's extinction.
   The chairman of the weekend meeting, Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.,
called on environmentalists and the industry to respond to the plan
by noon Tuesday. He set the deadline because on Wednesday the House
of Representatives plans to take up financing for the Forest Service
for fiscal year 1990.
   Environmentalists said they weren't sure they could meet the
deadline.
   ``There are a lot of things undefined,'' said Tom Giesen,
president of the Oregon Natural Resources Council and one of three
environmental panelists at the summit. ``We're discussing it and we
have a lot of people to talk to.''
   He added that Tuesday's deadline will be ``very, very difficult''
to meet.
   John Albrecht, Oregon chairman of the Sierra Club, said the
proposal would be accepted only ``with great difficulty.''
   But he said: ``I would be in favor of it because it's a
short-term solution. I don't see any threat in it.''
   Gov. Neil Goldschmidt and Oregon's two U.S. senators and five
congressmen backed the proposal, which calls for a short-term boost
in the timber supply if environmentalists agree to concessions on
lawsuits over the northern spotted owl.
   The proposal, unveiled during Saturday's meeting, would guarantee
for the industry 8 billion board feet of timber from national
forests in Oregon and 1 billion board feet from Bureau of Land
Management forests during the next year and three months.
   In return, environmentalists would get legislation preserving
``significant'' old growth stands and a commitment to adopt forest
planning processes that minimize fragmentation of remaining stands.
No specifics were available on the amount of old-growth forest left
intact.
   The agreement would be less than what federal officials had
allowed before environmentalist won the no-cut injunctions.
   Goldschmidt said he was surprised an agreement was reached among
the elected officials.
   ``I believe this does provide us with some hope for stability in
the timber area,'' said Rep. Bob Smith, R-Ore.
   ``For the first time in a long time we won't have judges and
lawyers managing Oregon's resources,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
   Timber industry representatives were pleased with the movement in
the issue.
   ``I think what the delegation has done here is unprecedented,''
said John Hampton, a timber company owner representing the industry
at the summit. ``I personally find the recommendation difficult to
accept.''
   But he said, ``Thinking of the 90,000 people who work in the
timber industry, I have to give it serious consideration.''
   Hatfield said the agreement still meant some jobs would be lost
under the proposal. The wood products industry, Oregon's largest
industry, has estimated that 20,000 jobs could be lost in Oregon by
1991 if court injunctions restricting timber supply remained in
force.

<TEXT>
   Potential jurors in the federal trial of
billionaire Leona Helmsley's tax evasion case must reveal their
income, what they think about rich people and whether they believe
the hotel queen is an ogre.
   Jury selection was to begin today in the trial of the 69-year-old
Mrs. Helmsley and two former aides.
   She and her husband, Harry, are accused of evading federal taxes
by billing personal luxuries, including a marble dance floor for
their mansion, as business expenses.
   Her 80-year-old husband has been found incompetent to stand trial
because of loss of memory.
   The Helmsleys head a $5 billion real estate and hotel empire,
mostly in the New York City area.
   In April 1988, the Helmsleys were indicted on charges they evaded
personal income taxes by disguising about $4 million in renovations
to their Greenwich, Conn., mansion as a business expense.
   Mrs. Helmsley is portrayed in advertisements as the ``Queen of
the Helmsley Hotels.'' The ad campaign calls Manhattan's Helmsley
Palace ``the only palace in the world where the queen stands guard.''
   Joseph Brodsky, lawyer for Helmsley aide Frank Turco, planned to
hand potential jurors a questionnaire asking their incomes and
attitude toward the wealthy.
   He said he wants to know if the potential jurors are ``biased
against rich people ... or whether they've seen Mrs. Helmsley's ads
in the newspapers and they think she's an ogre.''
   Turco and Joseph V. Licari are charged with helping create bogus
invoices to make it appear that the costly renovations on the $8
million, 28-room mansion were tax-deductible improvements on
business properties.
   Among the renovations listed in the 47-count indictment were a
marble dance floor installed above a swimming pool; a breakfast
room; an indoor-outdoor stereo system; more than $370,000 in
landscaping; and an assortment of furniture and paintings.
   The indictment said a $45,000 silver clock in the shape of the
Helmsley Building _ a gift for Harry Helmsley _ was billed to and
paid by the Park Lane Hotel. Four jade art objects worth half a
million dollars were paid for by four hotels as furniture purchases,
the indictment said.
   Last fall, the Helmsleys' lawyer, Gerald Feffer, said the false
invoices were a device used by Turco and Licari ``to enable them to
steal blindly from the Helmsleys. That's crucial to our defense.''
   The case was going to court after a lengthy pretrial period
during which defense lawyers filed many motions to overturn the
indictment or to remove one or both of the Helmsleys from the case.
   The U.S. Supreme Court in April rejected a motion to dismiss the
indictment. The motion said prosecutors engaged in misconduct
because of grand jury leaks to the news media.
   Earlier this month, a federal judge found Helmsley unable to
assist in his defense because of memory lapses and reasoning
difficulties.
   The ruling did not dismiss the charges against Helmsley but
indefinitely delayed his trial.
   The judge noted that doctors believed Helmsley's mental
deterioration, cause by several mild strokes, would continue and
that it was unlikely he would be tried.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe thunderstorms moved across Nebraska early today toward the
upper Mississippi Valley, while a tropical depression off the Gulf
Coast brought high tides and heavy rains to Texas and Louisiana.
   The Nebraska storms spawned tornadoes, which on Sunday night
destroyed or damaged several buildings and overturned cars in North
Platte.
   Tornadoes also were reported 20 miles south of North Platte and
15 miles west of Maywood. Three-quarter-inch hail fell at Taylor,
Neb., and winds blew down trees near Chambers, Neb., early today.
   The tropical depression brought tides 3 feet above normal along
the upper Texas and Louisiana coasts. Forecasters said rainfall
could reach more than 10 inches along the Texas coast, with lesser
amounts in Louisiana.
   Tropical-storm and flash-flood watches were in effect for the 470
miles from Baffin Bay, Texas, to Morgan City, La.
   Elsewhere, heavy rain fell in eastern South Dakota, with about an
inch in an hour at Huron.
   Thunderstorms weakened late Sunday across the eastern states, but
scattered showers continued in portions of the mid-Atlantic states
near the Chesapeake Bay. Earlier thunderstorms resulted in flooding
in Clearfield County in central Pennsylvania.
   In Iowa, showers dumped up to 3.4 inches of rain over the weekend.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
eastern half of Texas across the lower Mississippi Valley and the
Gulf Coast region into Florida, with a concentration of
thunderstorms across south-central and southeast Texas; showers and
thunderstorms, some locally severe, extending from the upper Great
Lakes across the upper Mississippi Valley to Nebraska and Kansas;
and widely scattered thunderstorms from Vermont and New York across
Pennsylvania and the middle Atlantic Coast states to the Carolinas.
   Predicted highs: in the 60s and 70s from the northern and central
high Plains across northern Minnesota to upper Michigan and along
the Pacific Coast; over 100 degrees in the desert Southwest and near
the Rio Grande River of Texas; and in the 80s and 90s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 36
degrees at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming to 87 degrees at
Phoenix.

<HEAD>U.S., Soviets Approach Accords on Nuclear Blasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators today opened a new
round of talks on monitoring underground nuclear tests with both
sides saying they are close to reaching agreements.
   They are drafting new monitoring provisions for two 1970s
superpower treaties limiting the power of military and other nuclear
explosions to 150 kilotons.
   One kiloton has the force of 1,000 tons of TNT, and the bomb
dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945, carried an explosive force of
20 kilotons.
   The aim of the talks is to gain U.S. Senate ratification of the
two accords. The original treaties never entered into force because
the Senate refused approval over concerns the limits could not be
enforced.
   Talks resumed after a six-month recess partly due to the Bush
administration's review of U.S. arms control and security policy.
   The new discussions began at the U.S. mission in Geneva with a
meeting of the two delegation chiefs, C. Paul Robinson of the United
States and Soviet Igor Palenykh.
   Robinson has said the new talks, due to last five to six weeks,
will aim to complete agreements.
   Palenykh said there is ``a good basis for reaching practical
results within a short time.''
   The officials said a verification plan for the 1976 Peaceful
Nuclear Explosions Treaty is virtually complete, but some work
remains on amendments to prevent cheating on the 1974 Threshold Test
Ban Treaty on nuclear weapons tests.
   Both sides are to be allowed various methods to measure nuclear
blasts, including on-site checks at each other's nuclear testing
grounds.
   In the future, the negotiations are intended to produce further
superpower agreements limiting and, ultimately, banning nuclear
tests.
   The Soviet Union has long urged Washington to join in a mutual
ban on testing. However, the United States says tests will be needed
as long as its military strategy includes reliance on nuclear
weapons.
   The nuclear testing talks are separate from U.S.-Soviet
negotiations on reducing long-range nuclear arsenals that resumed in
Geneva last week.

   Lesbian motorcyclists whose attire ranged
from nothing to black-lace stockings and leather corsets led up to
300,000 marchers marking the 20th anniversary of the gay-rights
movement.
   Demonstrations were held throughout the nation to commemorate the
June 27, 1969, riot at the Stonewall Inn in New York City, where gay
bar patrons fought back during a routine police raid.
   The rebellion sparked three days of rioting and gave birth to the
gay rights movement.
   More than half a million people marched Sunday in New York,
Minneapolis, West Hollywood, Birmingham, Ala., Lansing, Mich., and
Chicago.
   ``Ten or 15 years ago, I don't think anyone would have guessed
that we would have come so far,'' said activist Joanne Trapani, as
Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley became the city's first mayor while
in office to ride in the Gay and Lesbian Pride Parade.
   In San Francisco, a cheering crowd estimated by organizers at
300,000 people and by police at 140,000 turned out for the 19th
annual Lesbian-Gay Freedom Parade.
   The parade was led by ``Dykes on Bikes,'' a scantily-clad women's
motorcycle contingent.
   AIDS groups were well represented at the parade, and the crowd
expressed its appreciation as each contingent passed by.
   ``I get such a warm, loving feeling from everybody on the
sidelines,'' said AIDS patient Wes Luttrell, 43, who traveled 450
miles from Roseburg, Ore., to participate. ``It's so uplifting.''
   The parade wound through San Francisco's predominantly gay Castro
District to the Civic Center for a rally and entertainment.
   In New York City, 150,000 people marched in the annual Lesbian
and Gay Pride March.
   ``It's a generation of lesbians and gays coming together,'' said
City Councilwoman Ruth Messinger. ``We've made a lot of progress,
but it's never enough.''
   The festivities were stopped briefly for a moment of silence for
AIDS victims. As marchers stood quietly, skywriting planes spelled
out ``We remember'' over Manhattan.
   ``I have to be here for all those who aren't,'' said marcher Joe
Polito. ``This isn't an issue of being gay any more. This is an
issue of human rights.''
   An anti-gay group of about three dozen people heckled marchers
from behind a police barricade, waving signs and shouting,
``Perverts on parade!''
   On Saturday night, about 400 activists tried to force their way
into the Sixth Precinct, whose officers were involved in the riot.
There were no injuries and no arrests, said police spokesman Sgt.
Maurice Howard.
   In West Hollywood, more than 200,000 people gathered for the
annual Gay and Lesbian Pride Celebration.
   The parade began with the release of thousands of pink balloons
inscribed with the words ``I Love You'' as a tribute to AIDS
patients.
   ``We're here because it's the one time of the year that we can
really be ourselves,'' said Gino Pascalaiti, 30, of Santa Barbara.
``It means _ happiness.''
   About 90,000 people from across the Midwest attended Chicago's
parade, organizers said.
   ``I think the parade means a lot to the gay and lesbian community
and it means a lot to Chicago,'' Daley said. ``It shows a community
spirit.''
   An estimated 5,000 to 10,000 people turned out in Minneapolis for
a parade and rally.
   In Lansing, about 2,500 people rallied on the steps of the
Michigan Capitol.
   ``I've been a practicing lesbian for about 60 years, and I'm glad
to feel free to walk down the street today,'' said Porty Portwood of
Okemos.
   About 200 people attended a rally in Birmingham, Ala.
   In Louisville, Ky., on Saturday about 300 people took part in the
city's third-annual gay and lesbian March for Justice.
   At a rally following the parade, activists called for protection
against discrimination in housing, employment and public
accommodation, increased AIDS spending and the right to be open
about their relationships.

<HEAD>Army Sweeps Mining Area to Crush Revolt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KIETA, Papua New Guinea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government forces burned homes and
rounded up villagers in an operation aimed at crushing a
secessionist revolt that has closed a giant copper mine, news
reports said today.
   The rebels were reported overnight to have destroyed a power
plant at a farm run by Bougainville Copper Ltd., which owns the
economically crucial mine on northern Bougainville island.
   A state of emergency went into effect today, Australian
Associated Press said. It gives authorities broad powers to search,
seize and arrest, and it allows them to evacuate people from
emergency areas.
   Witnesses reported houses ablaze and said at least two dozen
people were taken away by police, the news agency said. Soldiers
blocked the access road to the mine and checked all vehicles, it
said.
   Many residents were likely to be forcibly evacuated from
rebel-held areas to isolate secessionist leader Francis Ona, a
35-year-old surveyor, and his Bougainville Republican Army, the
agency said.
   The unrest, which broke out seven months ago, closed the mine May
15. Rebel landowners say it is damaging the environment and they
demand $10 billion in compensation.
   The security forces commander, Col. Lima Dotaona, has called on
Ona to surrender. He said Sunday before launching the operation he
was confident his men would restore order, but he said he expected a
protracted operation.
   ``It's a dangerous operation, and you can expect casualties,'' he
said.
   In an address broadcast to the nation Friday, Prime Minister
Rabbie Namaliu said the government could not allow a ``criminal
minority'' to threaten the unity and economic stability of the
nation.
   The mine had been contributing 20 percent of Papua New Guinea's
total revenue through royalties and taxes.
   The rebels have spurned all attempts at conciliation, ambushing
mine workers and soldiers. Three soldiers have died and about 20
other members of the security forces and numerous civilians have
been wounded.
   Tensions boiled over because local landowners objected to profits
being made from the island's mine, which ranks among the world's 10
biggest open-cut copper mines. The rebels demand a referendum on
secession.
   Australia's biggest mining company, CRA Ltd., jointly operates
the mine, which is about 300 miles northeast of the mainland.
   Papua New Guinea, with a 3.5 million population, gained
independence from Australia in 1975.

   Swirling, murky water forced judges to
cancel the First International Submarine Races after giving the
overall performance award to Squid, the U.S. Naval Academy entry.
   The Navy's teardrop-shaped sub was awarded $5,000 in the
first-ever, human-powered submarine races, based on a combination of
speed, innovation and cost-effectiveness.
   ``We're having a used-sub sale tomorrow,'' said Navy Lt. Cmdr.
Pat Poole, champagne bottle in hand.
   Awards were presented after a second day of stormy weather forced
cancellation of a nine-sub race around a 1-kilometer loop course.
   The Subversion, the entry from California Polytechnic in San Luis
Obispo, won the speed award, beating the Navy's sub by eight seconds
in a 100-yard time trial Saturday.
   All the subs were ``wet'' designs that fill up with water and
require racers to wear scuba gear.
   Those propelling the subs said the biggest challenge was to
maintain a steady pace and not breathe too quickly, which can lead
to light-headedness or blackout.

<TEXT>
   The Navy has ordered an investigation into
the death of a second sailor in little more than a year at a
training pool.
   Michael J. Fedie, a 22-year-old flight officer candidate from
Altoona, Wis., died Friday after a drill at the Pensacola Naval Air
Station in which he jumped off a tower and swam a short distance
under water, the Navy said.
   ``He had completed an abandon-ship drill and was walking out of
the pool when he collapsed,'' said Chief Warrant Officer Robert
Tyler.
   A preliminary autopsy indicated Fedie died from acute cerebral
edema, said Kay Esty, a Navy spokeswoman. Edema is an abnormal
accumulation of fluid; its causes include a blow to the head, a
tumor and deprivation of oxygen.
   Final autopsy results will not be available for several weeks,
she said.
   Chief Warrant Officer Robert Tyler said an investigation has been
ordered.
   ``He was one of the best physical specimens you've ever seen,''
said Chris Jones, a high school friend. ``He called last Sunday to
say that the class had started out with 65 guys and over half quit.
But Mike never would have quit. Being a pilot is just something he
always wanted to do.''
   Fedie's father, Felix, said his son was an excellent swimmer.
   Fedie's death comes 16 months after Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki,
19, of Appleton, Wis., drowned at the naval station during a rescue
swimming drill.
   A officer was found guilty of negligent homicide at a
court-martial for holding Mirecki's head under water.
   Five officers were disciplined, the commander of the Naval
Aviation Schools Command was reprimanded and four other supervisors
were given warning letters.
   Mirecki's death prompted changes in procedures at the Navy Rescue
Swimmer School, including a ban on instructors touching students.

<TEXT>
   Authorities proclaimed today that all of China
backed the ouster of top Communist Party moderates, and suggested
the purge of party members who sympathized with the pro-democracy
movement could expand.
   The tightly controlled media stepped up a propaganda blitz
encouraging support for the ruling Communists' decision to relieve
party head Zhao Ziyang of all his party posts for ``supporting the
turmoils and splitting the party.''
   A senior military official today reiterated previous government
claims that there was ``no bloodshed'' on Tiananmen Square when
tanks and troops cleared it of pro-democracy demonstrators on June
3-4.
   ``The whole process was nonviolent. No one used guns,'' said Li
Zhiyun, one of the commanders of the assault, during a tour of the
square to foreign reporters.
   Li acknowledged some innocent people ``may have been wounded'' as
troops battled to reach the square, but said people had been warned
not to go out on the streets that night.Li said he had ``no
regrets'' about the street battles to reach the square.
   The government said nearly 300 people died in the street battles
in Beijing, about half of them soldiers. Chinese witnesses and
Western intelligence sources said the death toll may have been as
high as 3,000.
   The leadership shake-up, announced Saturday, replaced the
69-year-old Zhao with Shanghai party secretary Jiang Zemin, 62, a
proponent of economic reforms who supports the current hard line
that dissent must be dealt with harshly.
   Zhao is believed to have been stripped of power last month for
refusing to endorse plans by Premier Li Peng and senior leader Deng
Xiaoping to declare martial law in Beijing and have the army clear
central Tiananmen Square.
   The party's Central Committee on Saturday also announced the
dismissal from the Standing Committee of the ruling Politburo of Hu
Qili, another moderate said to have opposed the military crackdown,
and several Zhao supporters in top party positions.
   There were also suggestions the purge would be extended to lower
levels of the party and government.
   The party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, in a
report appearing in Chinese dailies today, said party members ``who
deviated from the correct political stand and violated party's
disciplines during the turmoils and the counterrevolutionary
rebellion should be strictly punished ... including expelling them
from the party.''
   It added that ``those party organizations which had made
resistance against the decisions made by the party's Central
Committee or had been controlled or manipulated by bad people during
the turmoils and counterrevolutionary rebellion should be firmly
overhauled and strictly dealt with.''
   ``Turmoils'' alludes to the seven weeks of student-led
pro-democracy demonstrations that were joined by hundreds of
thousands of people including journalists, workers, professionals,
party members and government workers.
   ``Counterrevolutionary rebellion'' is the government's term for
popular resistance to the introduction of troops in Beijing and for
the nationwide unrest that followed the military assault on the
capital.
   The official media, which in the first weeks following the
assault reported about 1,800 arrests nationwide and paraded
handcuffed detainees before television screens every night, has
recently stopped publicizing detentions.
   It was not clear whether the government was responding to the
international statements of protest and outrage over the harsh
suppression of dissent, which has included the execution of 27
people.
   Chinese sources said students, teachers and others who joined the
pro-democracy demonstrations were still being picked up by police,
although some were being released after questioning.
   National television and radio and the official press were filled
with statements from party officials, soldiers, intellectuals,
farmers and workers, all solidly backing the party's hard-line
stance toward those who failed to stand up against the ``party's
enemies.''
   The carefully orchestrated propaganda campaign showed a people
dramatically changed from a month ago, when both blue- and
white-collar workers showed strong support for the students and
their demands that the party allow greater freedom and end
corruption.

   An ``underground railroad'' to help dissidents
flee China has brought a key student leader and two prominent
intellectuals to safety, sources said today.
   Wu'er Kaixi, 21, the Beijing Normal University student who was at
the forefront of the crushed pro-democracy movement in China, fled
safely even though Communist authorities issued a bulletin for his
arrest, a local student activist said.
   The activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, refused to
divulge details of Wu'er's reported escape, saying he did not want
to jeopardize future efforts to bring dissidents from China.
   A diplomatic source said he believed Wu'er Kaixi had fled the
country. ``If I had $100 I'd put it down'' on the student's
succesful escape, he said, adding that it was not ``100 percent''
certain.
   Wu'er is on the wanted list of 21 students sought by Communist
Chinese authorities for leading pro-democracy protests, which the
government has labeled a ``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
   Wu'er, a member of China's Turkish minority, is from northwest
Xinjiang province. His compelling speeches and a television
appearance with Premier Li Peng during the movement made him famous
throughout China.
   In the television appearance, Wu'er interrupted the premier
several times, told him to ``stop beating around the bush'' and
respond to student demands for sweeping political change.
   Two other dissidents, intellectuals Yan Jiaqi and Wan Runnan,
were smuggled to the West through Hong Kong by the underground
railroad, the diplomatic source said. They are among seven
intellectuals on another wanted list issued by Chinese authorities
as part of the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement.
   Yan Jiaqi is reported to be in France after fleeing to Hong Kong
last week. Wan Runnan also came through Hong Kong and eventually
will travel to the United States, the diplomatic source said.
   Yan was a leader of the Beijing Independent Intellectuals
Association, which played an important role in the movement for
freedom and was banned by the Chinese government when martial law
was declared May 20.
   Wan, general manager of China's first private high-technology
company, the Stone Corp., had called for a meeting of the national
congress to discuss the demands put forth by students who were
demonstrating for a freer and less corrupt society.
   ``During the student movement, Stone and the students kept close
relations,'' the independent Ming Pao newspaper in Hong Kong
reported.
   The diplomatic source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
``a lot of dissidents (and) opposition people have gone out''
through the underground railroad operated by students and other
activists in this territory on the southeastern coast of China.
   He said he did not know how many people have fled China through
Hong Kong and refused to give details about how they were smuggled
out of the country.
   Since June 3-4, when the Chinese army moved into Beijing to crush
the protest movement, China has arrested at least 1,800 people and
27 people have been executed.
   Many student leaders and dissidents fled underground to avoid
detention.
   The Asia Television network in Hong Kong on Sunday broadcast what
it said was a statement made by Yan Jiaqi in which he leveled a
withering attack at China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping, Premier Li
Peng and President Yang Shangkun, who were behind the crackdown.
   ``China's political situation today is in the midst of a white
terror,'' according to a copy of the statement made available by the
network. He accused the three leaders of ``using the inhuman
policies of fascism to take all of those who support democracy, the
real Chinese people, and wipe out the whole lot.''

   It's an unwritten law of American business: You
can't sell computer software on the honor system and expect to be a
success.
   Unless you're Bob Wallace, president, owner and ex-chief
programmer of Seattle-based Quicksoft, publisher of PC-Write, the
acclaimed ``shareware'' word-processor for personal computers. Then
you break the unwritten law.
   ``I encourage people to copy the software and then encourage them
to pay for it after using it. It's like public television,'' the
40-year-old Wallace said last week.
   Users who pay and register get extra benefits: the printed
manual, telephone support, Quicksoft's newsletter and updates of the
program.
   ``But then there are intangible benefits: You're doing the right
thing, you're helping us out, keeping us in business,'' he said. And
that leads to newer and better versions of PC-Write.
   ``I don't worry about the people who don't register. I worry
about the people who do register,'' he said. ``I want to make sure
they're happy. ...
   ``If they're happy and we're making a reasonable profit, that's
good.''
   It's good enough for Quicksoft, with about 30 employees, to
expand its product base, too. On Tuesday, the company announced its
new file-search and ``hypertext'' information-linking utility
scheduled for late-summer shipping.
   Quicksoft also has published its first catalog of third-party
software it selects and supports for use with PC-Write.
   Wallace, whose catch-phrase is ``making a living, not a
killing,'' chose his profession at age 11. ``I read a Reader's
Digest article, `The Man Who Talked to Machines,''' he said. ``I was
one of the people that just knew, then, I would be a programmer.''
   He found computers to work on with an Explorer Scout troop
sponsored by Control Data Corp. in Bethesda, Md., then at the
University of Maryland, Brown University, and the University of
Washington.
   ``I got kind of discouraged because computers were so expensive.
I couldn't own one and I really wanted to own one, so I kind of got
distracted and went off. I was living on an island in Puget Sound
for a while,'' he said.
   The first personal computers appeared about the time he founded
the Northwest Computer Club in 1976. He went to work for The Retail
Computer Store in Seattle.
   In 1978, he was the 10th employee hired by Microsoft Corp., the
software company that created the IBM-standard personal computer
operating systems.
   ``Sometime in '82, I found myself thinking, `Gee, Microsoft is
getting huge and I'm kind of getting lost here,''' he said.
Microsoft had 300 employees then; it now has about 3,800 worldwide.
   He started writing a program for word processing.
   ``I thought I could do something people would really like and
really felt right, but I didn't know if I could explain that. I
couldn't really run an ad saying, `Buy my word processor: It feels
good.''
   He could, however, share his word processor using the electronic
bulletin boards of computer hobbyists. That eliminated distribution
and advertising expenses.
   The first version, 1.0, was introduced in August 1983, with 150
copies sent to the press and 150 to bulletin boards. A PC Magazine
reviewer suggested changes. Wallace made them. By February 1984,
Wallace had written version 1.3 and the reviewer liked it.
   ``That review pretty much started us out. It generated enough
interest and revenue so that I could hire our first employee, uh,
who I later married.''
   Megan Dana Wallace, an artist, draws Quicksoft's trademark
``office cat'' on the company's literature.
   PC-Write typically is rated as good as or better than other
full-featured word processors costing five times more than its $89
registration fee.
   It's anybody's guess how many copies of PC-Write are out there.
Wallace says the best estimates come from magazine surveys, which
typically estimate that 6 percent of their readers use PC-Write.
   ``I discount that down to maybe 4 percent, and that's somewhere
between half a million and 1 million users. And that's real
exciting,'' he said.
   ``Working from the other end, we know we have paid users of about
125,000, of which 45,000 are full, registered users and the other
80,000 are on group licenses _ corporations and universities,'' he
said.
   He expects revenues this year to be between $2 million and $3
million. Sales declined to $1.7 million last year from $2 million in
1987. He blames the slump on himself, for putting off the decision
to step down as chief programmer to take up exclusively the
presidency of Quicksoft.
   A final thought from Bob Wallace:
   ``Our business is based on people being honest and people are.
That's why we're successful.''

<HEAD>Federal Government Assigns Value to Alaska Wildlife</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 3 grafs new to CORRECT that department has not yet set values
in Exxon Valdez spill; picks up at 4th graf, But environmentalists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department is coming under fire
for assigning specific dollar values to birds, mammals and other
animals killed in toxic spills as a means of toting up the damage to
the environment.
   The department plans to use the same basic approach in setting
the damage estimate for the disastrous oil spill that occurred March
24 spill when the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in Alaska's Prince
William Sound, The Washington Post reported today.
   No dollar values have yet been set in that incident, but the Post
said that in past spills, the department has calculated that fur
seals were worth $15 each, sea gulls $7.88 apiece and Canada geese
$35.74 each. Striped bass were valued at $1.84 per pound.
   But environmentalists argue that the rules don't account for the
long-term damage to the environment, the newspaper said.
   ``If things continue as planned, the accounting of the
environmental damage caused by the Exxon Valdez tragedy would be a
small measure of what actually occurred,'' said Rep. Robert G.
Torricelli, D-N.J. ``A jury can better assess the enormity of that
damage than by attempting to use an adding machine and a pile of
reimbursement receipts.''
   The figures were developed from a computer model which is
supposed to reflect the market value of the wildlife, the Post
reported. Similar computer models are to be used to determine a
market value for the wildlife killed in three weekend oil spills in
the waters off the continental United States.
   The bill for the Valdez spill will eventually be sent to Exxon,
owner of the tanker that spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil.
   Thus far, the oil has washed up on 728 miles of beaches and the
dead wildlife count stands at 25,700 migratory birds, 800 sea
otters, 84 bald eagles, and 20 harbor seals, the Post said.

<HEAD>Thai Fishermen Arrested in Slaying of Vietnamese Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have arrested four Thai fishermen
who admit to massacring 130 Vietnamese refugees with pistols, knives
and hammers, a senior officer said today.
   A lone survivor of the attack, a young man, returned from a
refugee camp in Malaysia to identify the four, said Lt. Col. Prakob
Banjapong, deputy police superintendant in the southern coastal town
of Songkhla.
   Charges against the four include murder, robbery, attempted
murder and attempted rape in the April 16 attack. They face the
death penalty or life imprisonment if convicted.
   In a telephone interview, Prakob said police on Thursday arrested
two fishermen, aged 40 and 20, from one of the two boats involved in
the South China Sea slayings. Police found nails on the boat in the
area of the boat's name, indicating the fishermen had tried to cover
up the name, he said.
   Those two suspects led police to two other men, aged 29 and 22,
who were arrested Saturday, Prakob said. Nails also were found
driven into their boat.
   He said the four admit they killed the Vietnamese with pistols,
knives and hammers.
   Refugee relief officials said the pirates intercepted the
Vietnamese vessel off the Malaysian coast.
   They looted the boat, locked up the refugees below and set the
vessel on fire, the officials said.
   Some refugees managed to jump out, but were shot by the pirates.
The 22-year-old man who survived was rescued by another Vietnamese
boat, they said.
   Pirate attacks against Vietnamese boat people have become
increasingly violent.
   According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, pirates
attacked 38 boats since April 30. They killed 11 Vietnamese and left
372 others missing, raped 116 and abducted 70.
   Prakob said Thai police this year have arrested four other
suspected pirates who await trial for robbery and rape.
   The threat of pirates, prison-like refugee camps and days at sea
without food and water have not discouraged the exodus of
Vietnamese. More than 1.5 million have fled their homeland since
1975.
   Nations overwhelmed by an unrelenting flow that has increased by
up to 300 percent this year have become less hospitable. They say
the boat people now are fleeing economic hardship, not political
persecution, and are calling for forced repatriation.
   But, at an international conference in Geneva earlier this month,
Vietnam repeated that it will not accept those forced to return.
   The meeting ended inconclusively with a plan to screen new
arrivals and encourage voluntary returns. If that did not work,
alternatives would have to be examined, delegates said.

<HEAD>Leading Reformer Says He's Nominated For Presidency</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reformer Imre Pozsgay said the communist
party's Central Committee has decided to nominate him to be
Hungary's president, a government newspaper reported today.
   Pozgary, a Politburo member, was one of three well-known
reformers promoted on Saturday to a newly created four-man presidium
of the party.
   The Central Committee named economic reformer Redzoe Nyers party
chairman. It said he, Pozgary and Premier Miklos Nemeth will run the
party along with Karoly Grosz, the party's general secretary.
   The creation of the presidium seriously undercuts the power of
Grosz, a centrist who has come under heavy criticism by reformers.
   The presidium is to lead the party on a provisional basis until a
crucial party congress set for Oct. 7, when communists will choose
who will lead the party as Hungary prepares for its first free and
competitive elections next year.
   The choice of a leader at the congress is considered crucial to
the party's attempts to hold power when the elections are held.
   The reformers believe that only their more democratic policies
can give the party hope of emerging as the strongest force in next
year's elections.
   Pozsgay said the Central Committee nominated him for the new top
state post pending approval of Parliament, the daily Magyar Hirlap
reported.
   The newspaper printed a transcript of an hourlong television talk
show with the four presidium members on state television Sunday
night.
   ``I have been greatly honored at the session when they agreed
that when the office of president of the republic is created by
Parliament I'll be the nominee,'' Pozsgay said.
   Pozsgay previously had been named a likely candidate to replace
the current largely ceremonial post of ``president of the
presidential council'' held by Bruno F. Straub.
   Parliament is scheduled to go into session on Tuesday, but its
agenda was not made public. It was not known whether the issue would
be discussed.
   Knowledgeable sources said the new office will be created in
1990, when legislative elections are due to be held.
   Under constitutional changes being considered, the office of
state president would be vested with much greater powers than the
present figurehead role.

<HEAD>Dissident Leader Goes on Trial, Supporters Battle Police</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading dissident accused of making
an illegal trip to Communist North Korea went on trial today, and
supporters chanted anti-government slogans and battled with police.
   About 500 radical students brandishing metal pipes, clubs and
rocks hurled hundreds of firebombs at riot police as the Rev. Moon
Ik-hwan went on trial for making a trip to North Korea to discuss
unifying the nations.
   ``Release unification fighter Moon Ik-hwan!'' students yelled,
``Down with (President) Roh Tae-woo!''
   Several hundred police with shields defended themselves by
swinging captured metal pipes. Some students and police were
injured, but numbers were unavailable on arrests or injuries.
   Students from at least four colleges took part in the clash,
which occurred on a city street in front of Seoul's Sogang
University.
   About 1,500 police guarded the courthouse where Moon's trial
opened.
   Police arrested 13 radical students, chanting anti-government
slogans, who seized the rooftop of a nearby six-story building and
erected a large banner saying ``immediately release patriotic
unification fighter Moon.''
   Moon was brought to the courthouse in prison garb under heavy
security. His hands were tied with rope, but he smiled and waved at
supporters.
   The trial opening was delayed when about 200 Moon supporters
mounted a sit-in outside the courtroom demanding they be allowed to
use courtroom seats occupied by 50 police officers.
   No arrests were reported. The judge asked some officers to leave
so that more Moon supporters could be seated.
   Moon is charged with violation of the National Security Law for
his nine-day trip to the north in March. He talked to North Korean
leader Kim Il Sung about national unification, a popular issue with
student protesters in the capitalist south.
   South Korea's anti-communist government forbids unsanctioned
trips to North Korea, its bitter enemy, and maintains that dialogue
on unification must be carried out through government channels. If
convicted, Moon could face the death penalty, although that is not
considered likely.
   Also today, arrest warrants were issued for three radical
students the government says have encouraged people to participate
in the World Youth Festival, which is to be held in North Korea July
1-8. The government has banned participation.
   The students have been charged with violation of national
security laws, prosecutors said.
   Moon, 71, and his traveling companion Yoo Won-ho, a 59-year-old
businessman, were arrested April 13 when they returned to Seoul
after stops in Beijing and Tokyo. They have been in jail since then.
   Defense lawyers argued that the prosecution should drop charges
against Moon and Yoo on grounds the indictment is unconstitutional.
Repeating his earlier statements, Moon told the court that he
visited the north to seek reunification.
   The Korean peninsula was divided after World War II. In 1950, the
north invaded the south and started the three-year Korean War.

<TEXT>
   The state's decision to consider
reopening the investigation into the 1964 slayings of three civil
rights workers has raised hopes a cloud of collective guilt may be
lifted from this small community.
   What Philadelphia's 8,000 residents need now, says the editor of
a newspaper here, is a cathartic event such as a new trial to help
them deal with the emotional fallout from the town's complicity in
the attempted coverup of the June 21, 1964, slayings of James
Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner.
   ``The people here didn't step forward and speak out against the
murders 25 years ago. That's why we need to do it now,'' said
Stanley Dearman, editor and publisher of the Neshoba County Democrat.
   Last week, Attorney General Mike Moore said he was considering
reopening the investigation into the killings, which were dramatized
in the movie ``Mississippi Burning.'' Moore said he would examine
the files before making a final decision.
   Nine Mississippians, including a deputy sheriff, eventually went
to prison on federal charges for violating the victims' civil rights.
   However, the state never prosecuted the case, in which Chaney,
Goodman and Schwerner were arrested in Neshoba County on a traffic
charge and then turned over to a Ku Klux Klan lynch mob that shot
them and buried the bodies in an dam near Philadelphia.
   On Wednesday, during a memorial observance, Mississippi Secretary
of State Dick Molpus issued a public apology to the victims'
families.
   ``We deeply regret what happened here 25 years ago,'' he said.
``Every decent person in Philadelphia and Neshoba County and
Mississippi feels that way.''
   Wednesday's ceremony, also attended by Gov. Ray Mabus, marked the
first time state officials had honored the victims. Schwerner and
Goodman, white civil rights volunteers from New York, and Chaney _ a
black civil rights worker from nearby Meridian _ were killed while
working on a voter registration drive.
   Dearman, editor of the weekly paper since 1966, said the
observance and movie had helped weaken some of the barriers holding
back the emotions of residents, including his own feelings.
   ``There's a lot of denial in Philadelphia, people saying they
weren't involved or responsible for what happened,'' he said. ``I
used to feel that same way but I've come to believe in the concept
of collective guilt. And I've come to the conclusion that everybody
in a community has a responsiblity to stand up when they see
something wrong happen.''
   He added that an investigation and trial could provide the final
step in the community's acceptance of its responsibility.
   ``A trial undoubtedly would dredge up a lot of pain and
turmoil,'' he said. ``But while there have been many positive
changes here, I don't think we're ever going to be able to
completely put the past behind us until we've dealt with the
murders.''
   Molpus, a Philadelphia native, said he, too, would support
reopening the investigation if Moore decides to go ahead.
   ``The attorney general took an oath to uphold the law, as I
did,'' said Molpus, whose mother still lives in Philadelphia. ``But
I admit to having mixed emotions, it could tear up the community and
turn us back toward a dark and diverse time in our history.''
   Charles McClain, mayor of Philadelphia, said he feared reopening
the case would divide the community.
   However, Ben Chaney, whose brother was slain, says he thinks it
should be reopened.
   ``It would help bring attention to some of the things that never
were dealt with 25 years ago, such as the Klan beatings at the Mount
Zion Methodist Church near Philadelphia,'' he said.
   J.R. ``Bud'' Cole was severely beaten by hooded and robed
Klansmen following a meeting at the church, which was burned the
week before Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner were killed.
   There also was no investigation into the burning of the church,
which was later rebuilt and was part of last week's memorial
observance.
   ``That's the way things were back then,'' Cole said. ``A white
man could do anything to a Negro and never be held accountable.''
   But Dearman says much has changed in Philadelphia, which now has
an integrated police force and fire department.
   And a recent KKK rally in Philadelphia drew little support, he
said.
   ``Only about a hundred people showed up, and most of them were
there as observers,'' Dearman said. ``In fact, something happened
I've never seen before _ white people were actually shouting at the
Klan to go away and leave us alone.''

   Communist rebels attacked anti-Marxist
villagers at a church in a remote village and killed at least 39
people, including women and children, officials said today.
   Two of the dead _ a Protestant lay leader and his brother _ were
beheaded during the incident, which occurred Sunday at a United
Church of Christ chapel in Rano, on Mindanao island about 640 miles
southeast of Manila.
   At least eight people were wounded, officials said. The military
said the death toll could be higher because the rebels carted away
their casualties. A survivor claimed two rebels were killed.
   A church official in Manila said the 39 confirmed dead were
congregation members.
   Lt. Col. Jose Maneja, deputy commander of Davao del Sur province,
said about 100 New People's Army guerrillas entered the village
looking for the leader of a group of local anti-communist vigilantes.
   Maneja said details were unclear, but apparently someone
indicated that vigilante leader Ruben Ayap was inside the church and
shooting broke out. Ayap was killed along with his two brothers,
Abadi and Clemente.
   Abadi Ayap, head of the laymen's group at the church, and his
brother Clemente were beheaded, the military said.
   Regina Dominguez, 41, whose daughter was killed in the shooting,
said the rebels were angry because villagers had formed an
anti-communist group.
   ``They took revenge,'' Mrs. Dominguez said by telephone from
nearby Digos. ``They just fired.''
   Mrs. Dominguez said she was not in the village when the shooting
began but heard from survivors that villagers hacked to death at
least one guerrilla with long ``bolo'' knives.
   Lt. Col. Cresencio Maralit, spokesman for the Philippine
Constabulary in Manila, said the villagers had made the rebels angry
by refusing to pay ``revolutionary taxes.''
   Arnold Endar, 22, a vigilante who survived the attack, told
reporters he and about 70 others were crowded into the bamboo-walled
church when the rebels opened fire with M-16 rifles and two machine
guns.
   He said vigilante members ran from the church to get their
weapons and killed at least two guerrillas.
   ``I was hit when I ran out of the church to get my bolo,'' said
Endar, who was wounded in the leg. ``I saw many people dead, and I
pretended to be dead. As I ran from the church, I stepped on many
bodies.''
   Endar said he rode by horseback for two hours to alert a military
garrison. He said 20 members of his vigilants group and 12 children
were among the dead, including a one-year-old.
   In Manila, Samuel Briones, human rights coordinator for the
United Church of Christ, said the battle broke out after Sunday
school as the congregation was preparing for services.
   He said it was unusual for rebels to attack his denomination's
churches.
   The United Church of Christ has been widely criticized by the
military for alleged links with communist rebels because of the
denomination's outspoken stand on human rights.
   Sunday's incident occurred in an area of southeastern Mindanao
where the military has organized armed anti-communist vigilante
groups to counter rebels in remote areas.
   Various church organizations have accused the vigilantes of
widespread human rights abuses.
   The New People's Army has been waging a 20-year insurgency to
establish a communist state in the Philippines.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno promised political
reforms to win back public trust today after his beleaguered party
was badly beaten in an election seen as a barometer of voter
sentiment.
   On Sunday, Socialist Party candidate Kinuko Ofuchi won a
by-election in northern Japan for a seat in parliament's upper
house, defeating a candidate from the governing Liberal Democratic
Party.
   A Socialist previously held the seat, but Uno told reporters
today, ``I never expected that we would lose so badly'' in the
traditionally conservative district of Niigata.
   Uno acknowledged a new 3 percent sales tax, a huge stock scandal
and farm issues contributed to his Liberal Democratic Party's defeat.
   But he again refused to comment on the governing party's latest
scandal: allegations that he paid a geisha to be his mistress for
four months in 1985.
   ``I have respected political ethics for 30 years and I have not
done anything unethical,'' he told a news conference.
   But he added: ``I think it is regrettable that I caused trouble.''
   A weekly magazine had reported the geisha link, without naming
the woman.
   After the polls closed Sunday night, a 40-year-old woman appeared
in a national television interview, saying she was the former geisha
and that Uno had paid more than $21,430 to her and her geisha house.
   Mitsuko Nakanishi's allegations have sullied the reputation that
led to Uno's selection as prime minister just a month ago. His
predecessor, Noboru Takeshita, resigned to take responsibility for a
scandal in which the giant information and publishing conglomerate,
Recruit Co., is accused of trying to influence government policy
with excessive donations and sales of bargain-priced, unlisted stock
to public officials.
   Support for Uno's new Cabinet was at only 16.7 percent in a
telephone survey of 10,000 people conducted June 16-19, the Nihon
Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial newspaper, reported today.
   Although this was an improvement from the 13.1 percent rating for
Takeshita's Cabinet in March, 52.8 percent of those questioned in
the latest poll said they do not support Uno's government, Nikkei
said. The remaining 30.5 percent did not respond.
   Both polls and by-elections are being watched closely ahead of
next month's elections for parliament's upper house, where Uno's
party holds 143 of 251 seats.
   Ms. Ofuchi, Sunday's election winner, campaigned against the
sales tax that took effect April 1 along with income tax cuts,
criticized Uno's party fpr the scandal, and apparently won favor
with rural voters displeased with a greater opening of Japan's farm
market to imports.
   With 99.6 percent of the vote counted, Ms. Ofuchi had 559,603
votes to 482,245 votes for Hideo Kimi of Uno's party and 47,064 for
Kazuo Murata of the Japan Communist Party.
   ``We intend to listen attentively to the people's voices,'' Uno
said today.
   He said his party will work to restore public confidence by
promoting political reforms.
   ``I understand that following the Watergate scandal, the United
States made various political reforms, including election reform and
other tougher regulations to prevent recurrences of the same
wrongdoings,'' Uno said.

   The condition of Premier Andreas Papandreou
improved today as hospital treatment continued for heart and kidney
problems, doctors said today.
   Papandreou met briefly today with Cyprus President George
Vassiliou and planned talks with the leader of a leftist alliance on
forming a coalition government.
   Papandreou, 70, was admitted to General State Hospital on
Thursday with pneumonia he contracted eight months after undergoing
open heart surgery in London. Hospital officials said he
subsequently experienced heart and kidney complications.
   In a medical bulletin today, a team of doctors said Papandreou
``spent a peaceful night. His treatment continues and his condition
is improving.''
   On Sunday, the hospital said the premier was in serious but
stable condition after undergoing three hours of blood dialysis.
   Dr. Magdi Yacoub, who performed triple bypass heart surgery on
the premier September 30, flew in from London on Sunday with a team
of heart specialists for a two-hour visit, to examine Papandreou.
   A hospital announcement said British and Greek doctors agreed on
the necessary treatment and that Papandreou's heart was in steady
condition while his kidney problem was being dealt with.
   Papandreou is heading a caretaker government because no party
received a majority in elections on June 18 to the 300-seat
Parliament.
   The two-term premier, whose socialist Panhellenic Socialist
Movement was defeated in the elections, faces a Tuesday deadline to
form a new government. He received the mandate Friday from President
Christos Sartzetakis after conservatives, who finished first in the
balloting, were unable to forge a coalition.
   Papandreou planned to meet with leaders of a communist-dominated

   The communist-dominated alliance, the Coalition of the Left and
Progress, is next in line to attempt to form a government when
Papandreou's mandate expires.
   New elections will be held if that party can't form a coalition.

<TEXT>WASHINGTON: ruled today.    By a 5-4 vote, the justices said the
death penalty for such juvenile killers does not violate the Constitution's
ban on ``cruel and unusual punishment.''    In a pair of decisions, the
court upheld the death sentences of two young killers in Missouri and Kentucky.
They were 16 and 17, respectively, when they committed their crimes. 
  The rulings also are defeats for about 25 of the some 2,200 death row

   Three bombs exploded, traffic halted
and shops closed today during a nationwide strike called by
Sinhalese extremists in support of 40,000 striking bus drivers.
   Two bombs exploded in the Colombo suburb of Mount Lavinia and
another was detonated in the suburb of Narahenpitiya, said a senior
police official, who cannot be identified under briefing rules. The
blasts caused no casualties or damage and appeared intended to
frighten people into staying home, the officer said.
   The People's Liberation Front, an extremist Sinhalese group,
called the daylong strike and ordered people to stay inside their
homes as a show of support for bus drivers who have been striking
since June 12 for higher wages.
   ``We warn anti-national elements they will be shot or fall victim
to explosive devices if they fail to heed our warning,'' said
handwritten posters plastered throughout the capital and signed by
Keerthi Wijebahu, commander of the front.
   The government ordered the bus drivers to either report for work
on Monday or lose their jobs. But the ultimatium was ignored and
soldiers were driving the government-owned buses.
   A few private vehicles plied the roads, bearing white flags
indicating they were attending a funeral or on an urgent errand.
   Downtown Colombo, which is usually bustling by 9 a.m., was
virtually deserted except for a few police officers. Businesses,
banks and markets all closed their shutters.
   ``I cannot find a shop to even buy a cigarette,'' said one
policeman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Sinhalese extremists oppose an Indian-brokered peace accord
aimed at ending the 6-year-old conflict with the Tamils. It contends
the accord grants too many concessions to the Tamils, who make up 18
percent of the island's 18 million people.
   Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population and control the
government and military.
   Since the accord was signed in July 1987, Sinhalese extremists
have been blamed for killing more than 3,500 people. Most of the
victims have been government officials and security personnel.

<HEAD>Young American Pilot Arrives in Moscow</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old Californian flying a single-engine
plane around the world arrived in Moscow today after collecting
signatures of nearly 1,000 Soviet children to present to President
Bush.
   Tony Aliengena landed his blue-and-white Cessna 210 at
Sheremetevo airport after a two-hour flight from Leningrad, the
first Soviet stop on his attempt to become the youngest person to
pilot a plane around the globe.
   A contingent of Young Pioneers, a Communist youth group, welcomed
him with the traditional Russian offering of bread and salt.
   ``It wasn't a difficult flight,'' he said. ``It's just like
flying anywhere.''
   The youth, who has about 1,000 hours of flying time, is to spend
five days touring Moscow. Among stops will be Red Square, where West
German teen-ager Mathias Rust gained worldwide fame by landing a
single-engine Cessna in May 1987 after evading Soviet air defenses.
   The young pilot brought a friendship scroll signed by 250,000
American children that he hopes to present to President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   However, it is not certain the Soviet leader will have time to
meet the boy before he takes off Friday on a hopscotch journey
across the Soviet Union and then on to Alaska.
   ``I am not sure if I will get to meet him, but I sure want to,''
siad the youngster.
   Bush already has agreed to meet him at the end of his planned
47-day journey, to accept a friendship scroll signed by Soviet
youth. On Sunday night, the scroll was signed by 987 children in
downtown Leningrad, where the pilot touched down Friday and spent
the weekend.
   The American, from San Juan Capistrano, began his flight on June
5 from California. It should take him 19,000 miles around the world
in short hops averaging three hours each.
   In the Soviet Union, he is accompanied by a Soviet navigator
because air controllers on many domestic routes do not speak
English, as required on international routes.

<HEAD>Sausalito Celebrates Noisy Underwater Lovers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Revelers dressed as sea monsters and
playing kazoos held the second annual festival in honor of the
humming toadfish, the underwater lovers who torment residents each
summer with their rhapsodizing.
   ``We figured if we can't beat 'em, join 'em,'' said newly crowned
Toadfish King Phil Frank, a cartoonist whose coronation was
accompanied by kazoo music, the sound residents say is most like the
love sputters of the toadfish.
   Frank then led the dancing, leaping revelers along the dock
Sunday as they played ``Yes, We Have No Bananas'' and ``The Battle
Hymn of the Republic.''
   The festival started a year ago after sleepless residents
demanded to know the source of the noise that plagues the bayside
town north of San Francisco for three months each summer.
   The cry of the bulging-eyed, bubble-lipped creatures, a noise
some likened to the sound of B-52 bombers, usually starts after dusk
and lasts for hours, sometimes until 2 or 3 a.m.
   Residents at first advanced a number of theories, which Frank, a
17-year resident of the town, lampooned in his comic strip
``Farley,'' which appears in a San Francisco newspaper.
   Some held the CIA was pumping nerve gas into the San Francisco
Bay. Others claimed a Japanese ship loaded with electric massagers
sank in the bay's waters and lost its cargo, which buzzed on.
   A phone call to John McCosker, director of the Steinhart
Aquarium, led to the discovery that the noise was not manmade. It
seems that every summer sometime in June, the humming toadfish
migrate to Sausalito's Richardson Bay and emit the noise during
their two- to three-month mating season. The sound particularly
reverberates through the cement foundations of houseboats.
   With the mystery solved, some residents have come to welcome the
toadfish and the excuse they bring to drink beer, eat hot dogs and
jigs in the street.
   ``It's just a goof,'' said resident Joe Troise. ``The toadfish is
the perfect thing for Sausalito. It's eccentric, it's peculiar, it's
off the wall.''

<TEXT>
   In an apparent U.S. policy shift,
Assistant Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger said in an
interview broadcast today that Syria should withdraw from Lebanon.
   Also today, police said a bomb went off in a school in the
Syrian-policed mountain town of Dhour Shweir, wounding the
principal, a teacher and seven schoolchildren. They had no other
immediate details.
   ``The Syrians have to back off,'' Eagleburger said on
Christian-controlled Voice of Lebanon in an interview conducted by
the station's Washington correspondent.
   ``All of the outside parties ought to back off and let the
Lebanese make their own judgment about where their future lies.
There is too much foreign involvement on all sides.''
   His remarks in the taped interview reversed a statement he made
before the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee on March 16. He said at
that time that the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon would
aggravate the situation because their presence restrains the warring
parties.
   The Syrians have 40,000 troops deployed in mainly Moslem areas in
Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   Along with Druse militia allies, the Syrians have been engaged in
bloody fighting with army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000 mainly
Christian troops since March 8.
   Today's interview was broadcast during renewed Syrian shelling of
the Christian coastline north of Beirut. The Syrians are maintaining
a blockade of the enclave to block military supplies sent by Iraq,
Syria's main Arab foe.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
rules, said sporadic 130mm mortar fire hit around the ports of
Jounieh and Byblos.
   Aoun's artillery retaliated with 155mm howitzer fire on a seaside
boulevard of Moslem west Beirut where several Syrian batteries are
deployed.
   No casualties were reported today. By police count, 373 people
have been killed and 1,460 wounded in the 14 weeks of bloodshed.
   Eagleburger's interview was broadcast a day after Secretary of
State James A. Baker III urged Lebanese leaders to show restraint to
avert further bloodshed.
   Baker made his appeal in identical letters to acting Prime
Minister Salim Hoss and Aoun, who head the rival Moslem and
Christian cabinets in Lebanon's divided government.
   Aides to both leaders said Baker's letter restated U.S. support
for Arab League efforts to end Lebanon's 14-year civil war.
   In today's interview, Eagleburger also said the United States was
optimistic about efforts by the three-member Arab committee on
Lebanon.
   It is made up of King Hassan II of Morocco, King Fahd of Saudi
Arabia and Algerian president Chadli Bendjedid. The panel was set up
during an Arab summit in Morocco last month.
   ``We're obviously very hopeful that the Arab committee can, in
fact, bring sense to the situation and can convince the Syrians to
withdraw plus all those other foreign parties that have gotten
themselves involved in the tragedy of Lebanon,'' said Eagleburger.
   The Arab panel was given a six-month mandate to enforce a
cease-fire, lift land and sea blockades stemming from the battles,
and introduce political reforms to redistribute power between
Moslems and Christians.
   The Arab committee is scheduled to meet in the Algerian town of
Oran Tuesday to discuss its efforts.
   The respected An-Nahar newspaper quoted unidentified political
and official sources today as saying Syria was bent on overthrowing
Aoun by military, economic or political means.
   But the independent daily said the military option was out
because Syria has been notified that ``it was impermissible to
invade (Christian) east Beirut.'' It did not say who served the
notification.
   The paper said the Syrians resorted to blockades of the Christain
enclave hoping to incite Christians against Aoun.
   ``But that has not worked, and the Syrians have only the
political option left to get rid of Aoun,'' the newspaper said.
   Aoun mounted the initial attacks in March and declared he wanted
to drive Syria out of Lebanon.

<HEAD>Sales of Existing Homes Hit 16-Month Low in May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite falling mortgage rates, sales of
existing homes dropped 5.6 percent in May to their lowest level in
16 months, the National Association of Realtors reported today.
   The real estate trade group said existing single-family homes
were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.21 million units
last month. The previous low was 3.2 million units in January 1988.
   The drop in May followed sales of 3.4 million units in both March
and April, down 2 percent from February. The May resale rate was off
11.3 percent from the rate a year earlier.
   The weakness in sales this year has been blamed on rising home
mortgage rates, reflecting efforts by the Federal Reserve to fight
inflationary pressures by tightening the supply of credit.
   The Fed has been easing its grip on credit recently. Fixed-rate
mortgages have fallen from a high of 11.22 percent in March to 10.48
percent at the end of May, according the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp.
   ``The psychological impact of last month's rate drops didn't hit
the market until the end of May,'' said Realtors President Ira
Gribin. ``In a month when activity usually picks up, sales still
were slipping across the nation,'' he said.
   ``Buyers are not going to start flooding the markets the instant
mortgage rates start to go down. It take time for the tide to
change,'' Gribin said, predicting that June sales will be heavier as
more people take advantage of lower rates.
   The median price for existing homes in May was $93,100, up $200
from April and 3.9 percent above that for May 1988, the Realtors
said. The median is the point at which half of the homes sold for
more and half for less.
   The sales decline in May was led by 10.1 percent drop in the
Midwest, where sales fell to 800,000 units.
   The West, where sales had been strong, posted a resale pace
decline of 8.1 percent below April, to 570,000 units. Sales of
590,000 units in the Northeast were 3.3 percent below April.
   Sales in the South dropped to 1.23 million units, down 3.9
percent from April's rate.

   A poisonous liquid believed to
contain cyanide was sprayed in a college chapel where a West German
government minister was to meet today with leaders of the South
African Council of Churches, a college official said.
   A West German Embassy official said the toxic substance was
discovered before the arrival of Labor Minister Norbert Bluem, and
the meeting was held elsewhere at Johannesburg's St. Barnabas
College.
   Bluem, the highest-ranking West German to visit South Africa in
10 years, was to meet several officials including the Rev. Frank
Chikane. He is general secretary of the South African Council of
Churches and recently was hospitalized in the United States for
poisoning from a pesticide he said apparently was applied to his
luggage before he left South Africa.
   Chikane, a prominent black anti-apartheid activist, has had his
life threatened in the past, and a limpet mine was found in his
mother's mailbox last year.
   In Johannesburg, college principal Michael Corke said ``a toxic
and highly noxious liquid'' had been sprayed over the floor,
furniture and fittings of the chapel. ``A preliminary examination of
the substance made by the head of our science school suggests that
it is a cyanide-based insecticide or weed-killer.''
   Corke said they had kept samples for police forensic experts.
   Department of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Madeleine Gericke said,
``This is most regrettable if true.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Keeps Suspense Going Over Abortion Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Awaiting the Supreme Court's decision in a
Missouri abortion dispute is no lonely vigil. And the justices today
kept everyone waiting at least a few more days.
   On the next-to-the-last day of the term, the court handed down
several decisions, including two sanctioning the death penalty for
murderers who committed their crimes while age 16 or 17. But the
court said nothing about abortion.
   That means the court would have to hand down a decision in the
abortion case, Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, on
Thursday, the final day of the term, or schedule new arguments at
the outset of the next term, which begins the first Monday in
October.
   Never, it seems, have so many awaited a decision so anxiously, or
made such a public display of their anxiety.
   The potential stakes are enormous. The court is being asked to
use the Webster case to reverse or substantially limit its 1973
decision that women have a constitutional right to abortion.
   Such a ruling could allow states to outlaw abortion, or otherwise
curtail legal abortions, which number 1.5 million each year.
   With time running out on the court's 1988-89 term, partisan
lawyers gather in the hushed courtroom each day before the 10 a.m.
starting time to catch the first word. Interest groups make known
their availability to supply instant reactions. Scores of reporters
jam the courtroom press row and the court's public information
office a floor below. Satellite transmission trucks are parked
nearby.
   Each day, the word passes quickly. ``No Webster today.''
   Meanwhile, rumors abound and crash to earth.
   At least one such erroneous rumor got into print, after Arkansas
Attorney General Steve Clark went public with the ``scuttlebutt''
out of Washington that the decision would be announced June 19.
   ``We've never been through anything quite like this,'' says court
spokeswoman Toni House. ``Hectic,'' she offers as a one-word summary.
   The most senior reporter covering the court, Lyle Denniston of
The Baltimore Sun, says the anticipation is rivaled only by that
experienced before the 1976 decisions reinstating capital punishment
and the 1978 ruling in which the court first condoned the concept of
affirmative action.
   ``Here you have the court contemplating taking away a
constitutional right it created itself. The fact that is a real
prospect now has captured everyone's attention,'' he said.
   On the day the abortion ruling is announced, the National
Abortion Rights Action League will conduct an 11:30 a.m. news
conference to give its appraisal of the Webster decision.
   Planned Parenthood will host a similar affair at noon; the
Congress Pro-Life Leadership and National Right to Life Committee at
1:30; the American Life League at 2. The list goes on.
   A special edition of ``Washington Week in Review'' is planned for
public television.
   Many such organizations for weeks have sent representatives to
the court to harvest each day's decision crop _ a recent day's
single-file line stretched past 100.
   Messengers for the American Civil Liberties Union, the American
Bar Association, the National Organizaton for Women, the American
Life Lobby, congressional subcommittees and even one representing
columnist George Will share a peaceful co-existence.
   The abortion dispute officially has become the most closely
watched case of the 1980s. A record number _ 78 _ of
``friend-of-the-court'' briefs was filed by individuals and
organizations not part of the Missouri litigation.
   In a less formal, and likely less effective, form of lobbying,
hundreds of thousands of Americans wrote and telephoned the court to
express their views.
   In the weeks leading up to the April 26 argument session
conducted for the case, more than 20,000 letters addressed to the
justices arrived daily. The court's two switchboards were so flooded
with calls that a rarely used third board had to be activated.
   ``It's been a zoo,'' Ms. House said.

<HEAD>Legislator Calls For Brezhnev Award to be Revoked</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A legislator today suggested the nation withdraw
its highest military order from former Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev, who was given the honor 33 years after the end of World
War II, Tass news agency reported.
   Brezhnev, who rose to major general serving as a political
officer in the war, was given the jewel-encrusted Order of Victory
in 1978, the official agency said. He died in 1982.
   Supreme Soviet deputy Albert Likhachev said many people see the
decoration as one of Brezhnev's undeserved rewards. Tass noted,
however, that the legislature has no power to revoke the award.
   Such a move would further discredit Brezhnev, who now is
condemned widely for plunging the economy into a crisis and
stagnating the rest of Soviet society. His name has been stripped
off cities and ships, and his relatives have lost some benefits
given to family members of a Soviet leader.
   The Supreme Soviet, the nation's first full-time lawmaking body,
convened today to confirm Cabinet members and organize writing bills
and ratifying treaties, Tass said.
   These are new powers for the legislature, a division of the
larger Congress of People's Deputies that began work May 25. In
closed hearings last week, legislative committees rejected at least
four of more than 60 nominees to ministerial and other senior posts.
The fight now moves to the full 542-member body.
   One chamber, the Council of Nationalities, decided today that
committees in both houses should consider bills before publication
in the press, Tass reported.
   Several deputies objected to the large number of military and
defense industry representatives on a committee to oversee defense
and the dreaded KGB secret police. But they were told experts were
assigned deliberately to committees in their area of professional
expertise, Tass said.
   Izvestia, the government daily, reported today that the
committee's hearings will be behind closed doors despite calls for
more openness in those areas.
   The chamber approved the composition of its committees after
changes, Tass said without elaborating.
   The legislature also is to consider bills on raising pensions and
the rights of deputies, and to set priorities for tackling the
nation's economic and social problems, Tass said.
   The Soviet of Nationalities elected Ukrainian poet Boris Oleinik,
a reformer from Kiev, as one of its deputy chairmen, and the Soviet
of Unions elected Moldavian Alexander Mokanu to a similar job.
   Monday's separate sessions of the two chambers, originally to be
televised nationally, did not appear on the air or in the broadcast
schedule. A spokeswoman at the state Gostelradio said officials
decided there was no need to televise the session.

   The Supreme Court, declining to curtail
enormous awards in personal-injury lawsuits, ruled today that the
Constitution's ban on excessive fines places no limit on how much
money may be won in such cases.
   By a 7-2 vote, the justices refused to extend the prohibition
against excessive fines to civil as well as criminal cases.
   But the justices left open the possibility that the
Constitution's due-process requirements could put a lid on punitive
damage awards. That issue was not raised properly in the case
decided today.
   The court upheld a $6 million award a jury ordered a Houston
waste-collection company to pay a Vermont competitor.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote for the court that the
Constitution's Eighth Amendment, which bans cruel and unusual
punishment and excessive fines, always has been interpreted to
restrain governmental power in punishing criminals.
   ``Awards of punitive damages do not implicate these concerns,''
he said. ``We therefore hold, on the basis of the history and
purpose of the Eighth Amendment, that its excessive-fines clause
does not apply to awards of punitive damages in cases between
private parties.''
   But Blackmun hinted that the court might view the Constitution's
due-process protections more liberally.
   ``There is some authority in our opinions for the view that the
due process clause places outer limits on the size of a civil
damages award,'' he said.
   ``We have never addressed the precise question ... whether due
process acts as a check on undue jury discretion to award punitive
damages in the absence of any express statutory limit,'' Blackmun
continued. ``That inquiry must await another day.''
   Blackmun was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices William J. Brennan, Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshall,
Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Brennan and Marshall, in a separate concurring opinion,
practically invited a future challenge to large punitive damages
based on the due process issue.
   ``I join the court's opinion on the understanding that it leaves
the door open for a holding that the due process clause constrains
the imposition of punitive damages in civil cases,'' Brennan said in
an opinion for himself and Marshall.
   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and John Paul Stevens dissented.
They said punitive damages may violate the Constitution's ban on
excessive fines.
   Today's case produced intense interest in the business community
and among lawyers and consumer groups who have been battling for
years over the legitimacy of multimillion-dollar awards in a range
of lawsuits.
   Business leaders and others argue that skyrocketing damage
judgments are catastrophic for American competitiveness and
development of new products, particularly new forms of medical
treatment.
   Consumer activists and trial lawyers say punitive damages are a
powerful deterrent to corporate greed that poses a threat to public
safety.
   Some state legislatures, reacting to soaring insurance rates, in
recent years have imposed ceilings on how much money can be
recovered in personal-injury cases.
   In today's case, the court was not asked nor did it rule on the
constitutionality of such state ``tort reform'' laws.
   Today's ruling will influence juries and judges _ not legislators
_ as they weigh penalties in lawsuits.
   The case involved a $6 million punitive damage award against
Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., a waste-collection with
headquarters in Houston. The company was ordered to pay the money to
Kelco Disposal Inc. of Burlington, Vt.
   Browning-Ferris, with annual revenues exceeding $1.3 billion,
decided in 1973 to enter the waste disposal business in Vermont.
   The company appointed Joseph Kelley to be district manager for
its new regional office in Burlington.
   Kelley left Browning-Ferris in 1980 to form his own company,
Kelco Disposal Inc., which soon became a direct competitor.
   Kelco captured more than 40 percent of the market in the
Burlington region by 1982.
   There was testimony in the case that Browning-Ferris then
instructed its new Burlington manager to ``put Kelley out of
business. Do whatever it takes. Squish him like a bug.''
   Browning-Ferris then cut its prices almost in half, a maneuver
that prompted Kelley to file an antitrust suit charging the larger
company with trying to monopolize the waste-collection market in the
region. Browning-Ferris sold its Vermont business after Kelco
succeeded in winning more than half the market.
   After being repeatedly urged by Kelley's lawyer to ``send a
message to Houston'' and consider the wealth of the Texas company, a
Vermont jury awarded Kelco $51,146 in compensatory damages and $6
million in punitive damages.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the full amount,
concluding it was not ``constitutionally excessive.''
   Proponents of large punitive damage awards say they deter illegal
conduct, unlike smaller compensatory awards that may be viewed by
large corporations as a cost of doing business. They also argue that
wrongdoers often get off scot-free by going undetected or because
many cannot afford to sue.
   But those who favor limiting punitive damages say juries
capriciously penalize the wealthy in order to benefit those who have
suffered injuries, particularly if the victim is from nearby and the
wrongdoer is from another state or region.
   They also say the costs to society are great _ in the form of
skyrocketing liability insurance premiums, reduced health care and
abandoned experimentation in new products.
   Tort-reform proponents cite studies that show punitive damages
have gone through the roof in recent years. For example, one study
showed that the average punitive damage award in personal injury
cases in Cook County, Ill., was $14,000 for a five-year period
ending in 1969 and $1.9 million for a comparable period concluding
in 1984.
   The case is Browning-Ferris vs. Kelco Disposal, 88-556.

<HEAD>Soviet Nuclear Submarine Catches Fire Off Norway</HEAD>

   A pipe burst aboard a Soviet nuclear
submarine in the Norwegian Sea, causing a reactor malfunction and a
fire but no injuries, Soviet officials said today. The sub billowed
smoke today as it limped toward port.
   Norwegian officials criticized Soviet officials for not informing
them fully of the accident, the second involving a Soviet vessel off
Norway in less than a week and the third in three months.
   ``It is unsatisfactory for us as a neighboring state not to be
warned,'' Defense Minister Johan Joergen Holst told a news
conference.
   ``It is unacceptable,'' Foreign Minister Thorvald Stolenberg said.
   No radiation leaks were reported aboard the vessel, which was of
a class built in the 1960s to carry nuclear-tipped cruise missiles.
   In Moscow, Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov said the
accident happened on the sub's energy apparatus while the sub was
submerged. A pipeline of a reactor burst and its seal was broken,
the government newspaper Izvestia quoted him as saying.
   Yazov said the sub switched to backup diesel engines, surfaced
and took on water to cool the reactor. He said all crew members were
safe and the accident did not damage the environment.
   Yazov said another Soviet vessel would escort the ship east to
Severomorsk.
   Soviet media did not give the name of the Echo II class submarine
or say whether it was carrying nuclear weapons.
   A Norwegian Northern Defense Command spokesman said the
submarine, with both nuclear and conventional power, apparently
caught fire at about 5 a.m. in the Norwegian Sea off northern Norway.
   ``We received a telex from Soviet Murmansk rescue central ... at
about 9:45 a.m. that said the situtation was under control, the crew
was in good shape and that there was no danger of a radiation
leak,'' Maj. Arne Skjaerpe said by telephone.
   The submarine was first spotted by Norwegian aircraft 70
northwest of South Island, which is part of the northern province of
Finnmark.
   The vessel's crew fired a rocket and waved off a Norwegian Sea
King rescue helicopter to indicate it did not want civilian help,
said Terje B. Lien, an official at the Norway Rescue Coordination
Center at Bodoe. Officials said it was emitting smoke, possibly from
an auxiliary motor.
   The Echo II class dates from the early 1960s. It is
nuclear-powered and normally carries nuclear weapons.
   The authoritative British handbook ``Jane's Fighting Ships'' said
Echo II submarines are 380 feet long, have crews of 90 and eight
missile silos built for cruise missiles. The reference says the
vessels have two nuclear reactors and two steam turbines.
   ``It was a malfunction in the main power plant,'' the official
Soviet news agency Tass reported in Moscow.
   ``According to commander of the submarine, there was a breakdown
in the system that insures air and water tightness of the reactor.
The reactor has been shut down. There are no casualties,'' the
report said.
   The submarine was on the surface and moving toward home under its
own power. Ships and aircraft of the Soviet northern fleet have been
sent to the area, the report said.
   Norway's rescue coordination center said the submarine was first
spotted at 71 degrees 36 minutes north and 21 degrees 5 minutes east.
   On April 7, a Soviet Mike-class submarine caught fire and sank in
the Norwegian Sea, killing 42 Soviet sailors.
   On June 20, Soviet cruise ship Maxim Gorky was torn open by ice
and nearly sank near Norway's Spitzbergen Island. No casualties were
reported among the roughly 950 people aboard.

<HEAD>Court Says Police Can Stray From Warning Language</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today gave police permission
to stray from the precise wording of the famous Miranda warnings
given to criminal suspects.
   The decision, reached by a 5-4 vote, reinstated an Indiana man's
conviction and 35-year prison sentence for attempted murder.
   The warning, familiar to every fan of television police shows,
was created by the high court in a 1966 decision called Miranda vs.
Arizona. It was designed to bolster criminal suspects' Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination.
   Under the court ruling, police must warn suspects in custody of
their right to remain silent, that anything they say can be used
against them and that they have a right to a lawyer's help before
answering any questions.
   Suspects also must be told that a lawyer will be provided to them
if they cannot afford to hire one and that the warnings must be
given before any police interrogation begins.
   In the case decided today, Hammond, Ind., police questioned Gary
Eagan in 1982 about an attempted murder after reading him a warning
that included this paragraph:
   ``You have a right to the advice and presence of a lawyer even if
you cannot afford one. We have no way of giving you a lawyer but one
will be appointed for you, if you wish, if and when you go to
court.''
   Eagan subsequently confessed to the crime, and did so again 29
hours later after being read a Miranda warning that did not include
the ``if and when'' language.
   Like some other states, Indiana does not provide pennyless
criminal suspects with free lawyers until their first appearance in
court. The Miranda right to a lawyer's help is accommodated by
police not initiating any contact with a suspect who has asked for
legal help.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Eagan's case that
the ``if and when'' language of the warning Hammond police gave him
was confusing. The wording could lead someone to think he properly
may be questioned by police without a lawyer, the appeals court said.
   Other federal appeals courts have allowed warnings containing
such wording.
   Today, the justices said the 7th Circuit court was wrong.
   ``In our view, the court of appeals misapprehended the effect of
the inclusion of the `if and when you go to court' language in
Miranda warnings,'' Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote.
   ``This instruction accurately described the procedure for the
appointment of counsel in Indiana,'' he said.
   The court also ruled that the 1966 Miranda decision does not
require that lawyers be provided as soon as they are requested _
only that police halt their questioning.
   Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and
Anthony M. Kennedy joined Rehnquist in the majority.
   Justices Thurgood Marshall, William J. Brennan, John Paul Stevens
and Harry A. Blackmun dissented.
   In a 1981 decision, the court said ``talismanic incantations'' of
a defendant's rights are not required so long as the right to a
lawyer's help is not linked to ``a future point in time after the
police interrogation.''
   Both Indiana prosecutors and Eagan cited the 1981 ruling as
favorable to their side.
   Eagan telephoned Chicago police on May 16, 1982 and told them he
had found a dead, naked woman along the Lake Michigan shore in
Indiana.
   When he led police to her, the still-alive woman looked at Eagan
and exclaimed, ``Why did you stab me?''
   The woman later testified that Eagan and two other men had taken
her to the Indiana beach from Chicago and that she had sex with the
two other men. When she refused Eagan, she said, he stabbed her.
   Chicago police turned the case over to Hammond police.
   The case is Duckworth vs. Eagan, 88-317.

<TEXT>
   The Afghan government will free rebel
prisoners in exchange for Soviet soldiers captured by guerrillas
during the 10-year-old war, rebel sources said today.
   Soviet diplomats, however, said final approval of the prisoner
swap must come from the Soviet-backed government in Kabul.
   An exchange agreement was reached at a fourth round of talks
today between Moslem guerrilla representatives and the Soviet
Embassy in Islamabad, a guerrilla spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
   He said both sides will exchange lists of prisoners at talks to
be held within the next week.
   He said the Soviets endorsed the principle of exchanging
prisoners at one time, en masse, as previously demanded by the
insurgents.
   A Soviet Embassy statement, however, said Moscow will open talks
with Kabul on the proposed exchange.
   ``If the Russians agreed then Kabul will also,'' the guerrilla
spokesman said.
   The guerrillas claim 40,000 of their people are missing in action.
   They say they are holding between 50 and 75 Soviet soldiers
inside Afghanistan. Moscow says 311 of its troops have gone missing
since its sent troops to bolster the Kabul government's fight
against the anti-communist guerrillas nine years ago. The last Red
Army troops withdrew in February under a U.N.-brokered agreement.
   This latest round of prisoner negotiations comes while an
eight-member Soviet delegation is visiting Pakistan, including three
mothers and a father of Red Army soldiers missing in Afghanistan.
They insist their group is unofficial.
   Delegation spokesman Iona Andronov said that over the past two
days, ``We spoke with the proper people in Moscow and Kabul'' and
received assurances that ``we can arrange for this exchange.''
   The Soviet parents sought information about their children during
a meeting last week with guerrilla leaders in Pakistan's frontier
city, Peshawar.
   Andronov said the delegation promised to reciprocate with
information about missing Afghan guerrillas.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rejects Appeal in Yonkers Desegregation Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected arguments by
citizen groups in Yonkers, N.Y., that a federal judge illegally
ordered construction of 1,000 low-cost homes to help desegregate the
city.
   The justices, without comment, threw out an appeal by Save
Yonkers Federation Inc. and others. It contended that U.S. District
Judge Leonard B. Sand exceeded his authority in ordering the
desegregation plan.
   The Yonkers case attracted national attention a year ago when
four Yonkers councilmen refused to obey Sand's orders to adopt the
plan and were fined $3,500 each for contempt of court.
   Faced with massive layoffs of city workers, the city council
reversed itself on Sept. 10, 1988, by voting to comply with the
judge's order to build the low-cost homes.
   The Supreme Court last March agreed to decide whether Sand had
the power to fine the councilmen. A ruling in that case is expected
sometime in 1990.
   But the high court previously left intact Sand's 1985 ruling that
Yonkers officials intentionally and unlawfully promoted racial
segregation through their housing and school policies.
   The suit against the officials was begun by the federal
government in the waning days of President Jimmy Carter's
administration in 1980.
   In the case acted on today, the citizens groups said Sand's order
to build the homes in middle-class areas would leave untouched
racial segregation in the city's predominantly black Hispanic area.
   The case is Save Yonkers Federation vs. Sand, 88-1767.

<HEAD>Court Eases Use of Racketeering Law in Civil Suits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, broadly interpreting a key
federal anti-racketeering law, made it easier today to use the law
in civil lawsuits against businesses accused of fraud.
   The court said unanimously that the law applies to more than what
is traditionally described as organized crime.
   Also, Justice William J. Brennan said for the court that to prove
a pattern of racketeering activity under the law, a private
plaintiff or a prosecutor must show at least two criminal acts
``within a single scheme that were related and that amounted to, or
threatened the likelihood of, continued criminal activity.''
   Brennan rejected arguments that a plaintiff or prosecutor must
prove ``separate illegal schemes'' to demonstrate a pattern of
racketeering activity.
   Moreover, he continued, the law is designed to apply to more than
traditional organized crime.
   ``The occasion for Congress' action was the perceived need to
combat organized crime,'' Brennan said. ``But Congress for cogent
reasons chose to enact a more general statute, one which, although
it had organized crime as its focus, was not limited in application
to organized crime.''
   The court unanimously reinstated a lawsuit against Northwestern
Bell Telephone Co. by Minnesota consumers. The suit was based on
alleged violations of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, or RICO.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the suit, which
accused Northwestern Bell of bribing state public utility officials.
   The consumers say the phone company in 1980 began trying
illegally to win rate increases by offering gifts, employment and
other favors to members of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.
   The appeals court ruled that the phone company's customers failed
to prove ``a pattern of racketeering activity'' required to make a
case under RICO.
   The 8th Circuit court said a single fraudulent scheme is
insufficient, ruling that at least two schemes must be alleged.
   Other federal appeals courts have allowed civil RICO suits based
on numerous acts advancing only one fraudulent scheme.
   It is not unusual nowadays to find at least one RICO claim in
lawsuits involving virtually any business dispute. The stigma
attached to being linked in public court documents to alleged
racketeering can be powerful leverage for out-of-court settlements.
   Winners of RICO lawsuits may collect triple damages and lawyer
fees, both of which generally are not available under state
anti-fraud laws.
   Justice Department lawyers, in a friend-of-the-court brief
submitted last year, sided with the phone customers in urging the
justices to interpret the RICO law broadly and reinstate the lawsuit.
   Also backing the customers were 14 states _ Arizona, California,
Connecticut, Idaho, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, North
Carolina, Oregon, Texas, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and
Wyoming.
   Other interests urged the high court to bar the lawsuit. For
example, the AFL-CIO said in a friend-of-the-court brief that
``private civil RICO actions have become a tool of harassment ...
against legitimate businesses and labor organizations.''
   During an oral argument session before the justices last
November, a lawyer for Northwestern Bell said the 1970 law is aimed
at thwarting organized crime, and should not be used against
otherwise legitimate businesses accused of fraud.
   But the lawyer representing the company's customers said
businesses that engage in fraudulent acts ``forfeit the right to
call themselves legitimate.''
   The case is H.J. Inc. vs. Northwestern Bell, 87-1252.

   The Supreme Court today rejected appeals by
three convicted drug dealers who said Italian-Americans unlawfully
were barred from serving as jurors at their trial.
   The court, without comment, left intact the case of the three men
convicted in connection with the shipment of cocaine from Florida to
New Jersey.
   The three are Giacomo DiNorscio and Gerald Cohen, each sentenced
to 30 years in prison, and Anthony Truglia, sentenced to 10 years.
   At their 1986 trial in Newark, N.J., federal prosecutors used
what are known as peremptory _ or automatic _ challenges to exclude
five potential jurors with Italian surnames.
   The defendants said elimination of those potential jurors
violated a 1986 Supreme Court ruling that said prosecutors never may
disqualify potential jurors based on their race.
   The 1986 case involved exclusion of black potential jurors, and
the justices said prosecutors must explain their reasons for
peremptory challenges if there is evidence the exclusions are
racially motivated.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last December ruled against
the defendants in the New Jersey case.
   The appeals court said they failed to show that ``persons with
Italian surnames ... are themselves an identifiable ethnic group
that shares common backgrounds and ideas linked to a single culture
and group loyalties.''
   The appeals court said there was no evidence ``this group has
been systematically excluded from jury service in New Jersey.''
   The 3rd Circuit court also said the defendants failed to prove
any actual prejudice against them, particularly since two jurors who
did serve at the trial had Italian surnames.
   Claims by DiNorscio and Truglia that five years was tacked on to
their prison sentences improperly also were rejected by the appeals
court.
   The five years were added under a federal law that permits longer
sentences for defendants who commit crimes while free on bail
awaiting trial.
   The defendants said they were not alerted to the possibility of
the additional prison sentences when freed on bail.
   The appeals court also rejected Cohen's argument that he was
indicted by a grand jury that lacked adequate representation by
blacks, Hispanic-Americans and people with less than high school
educations.
   The cases are DiNorscio vs. U.S., 88-1664, and Cohen vs. U.S.,
88-6875.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Will Hear Appeal in Houston Labor Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to set
guidelines on when employers may withdraw recognition of a labor
union after hiring new workers to break a strike.
   The court said it will hear a Bush administration appeal of a
ruling favoring an employer in a case stemming from a 1979 strike
against a Texas laboratory supplies company.
   Curtin Matheson Scientific Inc. was struck in 1979 by workers at
its warehouse in Houston after a union contract expired and the
company locked out all 27 Teamsters union members employed there.
   Five of the 27 employees crossed the picket line when the strike
began June 13, 1979. The company 12 days later hired 29 new
employees to replace the remaining 22 strikers.
   When the union later offered to end the strike under terms
previously offered by management, the company withdrew the offer
along with its recognition of the union as the workers' bargaining
agent.
   The National Labor Relations Board in 1987 said the company
illegally withdrew its recognition of the union. The board said the
company acted without adequate reason to believe the union lacked
support from a majority of the workers then at the plant.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overruled the board last
November.
   ``The company was justified in doubting that the striker
replacements supported the union,'' the appeals court said.
   Bush administration lawyers said the labor board properly refused
to accept the company's presumption that the union had lost the
support of the majority of workers.
   Strikebreakers may choose to work for financial reasons or they
may disapprove of a strike while still supporting the union, Justice
Department lawyers told the court.
   The case is NLRB vs. Curtin Matheson, 88-1685.

<HEAD>Justice Minister Sees More Deportations of Palestinians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE OLSTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Justice Minister Dan Meridor today said Israel
should deport more Palestinian activists in its efforts to end the
18-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories.
   In the occupied West Bank, Arab reports today said the body of a
woman suspected of cooperating with Israeli security forces was
found in the city of Nablus. She had been beaten to death with clubs
and sharp objects.
   In Ramle, peace activist Abie Nathan today went on trial on
charges of violating an Israeli law that bans contacts with the
Palestine Liberation Organization. Nathan, 63, was indicted late
last year for meeting PLO chief Yasser Arafat and several of his
aides in Tunisia and France in September 1988.
   Meridor called for more deportations of Palestinians in an
interview on army radio, one day after the justice and defense
ministries formed a committee to devise tougher measures against
Palestinian protesters.
   ``I think deportation is serious but must be used, I would say
perhaps even more than what has been done until now,'' Meridor said.
``I think it's an effective punishment when we have appropriate
evidence.''
   Palestinians said the slain woman, Sabah El Khadi Kanaan, 30, was
accused of collaborating with Israel's secret police.
   At least 68 suspected collaborators have been killed by other
Palestinians since the uprising began in December 1987 in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. A total of 536 Palestinians and 23 Israelis
have died during the revolt.
   The new committee on putting down the uprising was formed Sunday
to examine proposals by Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin for speeding
deportations and the demolishion of houses of Palestinians suspected
of security offenses.
   Rabin also reportedly wants to lengthen the period for holding
Arab suspects without trial from six months t a year.
   The United States and human rights organizations repeatedly have
criticized all three methods of punishment because they are carried
out without due process of law or violate international conventions
on human rights.
   Israeli news reports said that Meridor had resisted some of the
steps proposed by Rabin. But Meridor told army radio that he
expected stronger measures, especially on deporations, could be
worked out ``in a few days.''
   Meridor said 50 deportations have been carried out since the
start of the uprising, and another five are being appealed before
Israeli courts. He said nearly 300 houses have been demolished or
sealed.

   States are free to impose the death penalty for
murderers who committed their crimes while age 16 and 17, the
Supreme Court ruled today. Separately, the court ruled that the
Constitution does not categorically prohibit the execution of
mentally retarded killers.
   But in splintered voting in a Texas case, the court said
sentencing juries and judges must be allowed to take into
consideration a murder defendant's mental retardation.
   Ruling in juvenile-killings cases, the justices voted 5-4 that
the death penalty for older juvenile killers does not violate the
Constitution's ban on ``cruel and unusual punishment.'' The ruling
could affect about 25 of the some 2,200 death row inmates across the
nation.
   An eagerly anticipated decision on abortions, Webster vs.
Reproductive Health Services, was not announced today.
   The court also meets on Thursday, which is the last day of the
term. If the Webster decision does not come down Thursday, the court
could order a re-hearing in the term beginning the first Monday in
October.
   In other action today, the court:
   _ Ruled the Constitution's ban on excessive fines places no limit
on how much money can be won in personal-injury lawsuits.
   By a 7-2 vote, the justices refused to extend the prohibition
against the excessive fines to civil as well as criminal cases.
   _ Gave police permission to stray from the precise wording of the
famous Miranda warnings given to criminal suspects.
   The decision, reached by a 5-4 vote, reinstated an Indiana man's
attempted-murder conviction and 35-year prison sentence.
   _ Made it easier to use the law in civil lawsuits against
businesses accused of fraud.
   Broadly interpreting a key federal anti-racketeering law, the
court unanimously ruled that the law applies to more than what is
traditionally described as organized crime.
   In the juvenile-killer decision, the court upheld the death
sentences of two young killers in Missouri and Kentucky. They were
16 and 17, respectively, when they committed their crimes.
   Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court that no national
consensus exists against the execution of murderers who committed
their crimes while minors.
   In the decision involving capital punishment for mentally
retarded killers, the court threw out a convicted Texas murderer's
death sentence, but rejected his lawyers' arguments that capital
punishment always is impermissible for retarded murderers.
   Scalia said in the juvenile-killer decision that of the 37 states
permitting capital punishment, 15 decline to impose it for anyone
who committed the crime when not yet 18.
   ``This does not establish the degree of national consensus this
court has previously thought sufficient to label a particular
punishment cruel and unusual,'' Scalia said.
   He was joined in that holding by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor and
Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun
and John Paul Stevens dissented.
   The justices, in effect, drew the allowable line for capital
punishment at age 16 last year when they voted, 5-3, to throw out
the death sentence of an Oklahoma killer who committed his crime
when 15.
   Today, that line held up.
   In the Missouri case, Heath Wilkins, now 20, was sentenced to die
by lethal injection for murdering liquor store clerk Nancy Allen
during a 1985 robbery in Avondale, Mo.
   Wilkins first stabbed Mrs. Allen, the 26-year-old mother of two,
in the back and chest. As she pleaded for mercy, he stabbed her four
times in the throat.
   The robbery netted for Wilkins and three other homeless
teen-agers $450 in cash and checks, cigarettes, rolling papers,
cheap wine and peppermint schnapps.
   In the Kentucky case, Kevin Stanford was sentenced to death in
the state's electric chair for the 1981 abduction and murder of
Baerbel Poore, 20, a gas station attendant in Louisville.
   Stanford, now 25, and two others robbed the station of $143.07 in
cash, 300 cartons of cigarettes and two gallons of gasoline.
   Police said Stanford and another teen-ager sexually abused and
terrorized Ms. Poore in the gas station's bathroom, then forced her
into her car and drove to a wooded area. Stanford allowed Ms. Poore
a last cigarette, then shot her twice in the head.
   The Clearinghouse on Georgia Prisons and Jails, a group opposed
to capital punishment, estimates that between 12 percent and 20
percent of the some 2,200 people on death rows across the nation
function at below-average intelligence.
   The justices split 5-4 in ruling that Johnny Paul Penry's rights
were violated because his sentencing jury was not given a sufficient
opportunity to take his mental capacity into account.
   Penry has the reasoning capacity of a 7-year-old.
   O'Connor, Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun and Stevens formed the
majority on that portion of the decision sparing, at least for now,
Penry's life.
   But a separate voting bloc _ O'Connor, Rehnquist, White, Scalia
and Kennedy _ prevailed in a separate 5-4 decision that stopped
short of outlawing capital punishment for all retarded killers.
   ``While a national consensus against execution of the mentally
retarded may someday emerge reflecting the evolving standards of
decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, there is
insufficient evidence of such a consensus today,'' O'Connor wrote.
   Jurors who sentenced Penry were told they could consider all
evidence presented by the defense, which included testimony about
Penry's retardation.
   But the judge refused to make special instructions aimed at
highlighting Penry's mental condition. For example, Penry's trial
lawyer had requested that the word ``deliberately'' be defined for
jurors.
   Today, the court said that when such a request is made, it must
be honored.
   Penry, 32, was sentenced to die by lethal injection for the 1979
murder of Pamela Moseley Carpenter, 22, in Livingston, Texas.
   Prosecutors said Penry raped the young woman and then killed her
so she could not identify him for authorities. She lived long enough
to give police a description of her assailant.
   Mrs. Carpenter, the sister of former National Football League
placekicker Mark Moseley, was stabbed repeatedly in the chest with a
scissors she had been using to make Halloween decorations.
   The cases are Stanford vs. Kentucky, 87-5765, Wilkins vs.
Missouri, 87-6026, and Penry vs. Texas, 87-6177.

   An effort to raise $100,000 to save the

   The hall said its two-week emergency campaign collected only

<HEAD>Court Sets Aside Ruling in New Orleans Civil Rights Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today set aside a ruling that
a key civil rights law does not protect aliens from discrimination
by businesses or other private citizens.
   The high court ordered a lower court to reconsider the case of a
New Orleans man from India who was denied a bank credit card because
he is not a U.S. citizen.
   The justices said the lower court should restudy the case in
light of the high court's June 15 ruling reaffirming that a
century-old civil rights law applies to alleged discrimination by
private citizens.
   The First National Bank of Commerce in New Orleans was accused of
illegal bias by Jeetendra Bhandari, a citizen of India who applied
for a Visa or Master Card credit card in 1983.
   Bank officials said they rejected Bhandari's application in part
because he is not a U.S. citizen.
   Bhandari, an accountant, sued the bank in federal court. He
charged it with violating a post-Civil War law _ now commonly
referred to as Section 1981 _ that prohibits racial discrimination.
   The entire 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, by a 7-6 vote,
ruled last October that Section 1981 does not ban private acts of
discrimination against aliens.
   Judge Thomas Gee, in his opinion for the court's majority, said,
``Racial and citizenship distinctions are things of a different
kind. The latter is not so readily and roundly condemned.''
   He added: ``When all is said and done, patriotism remains a civic
virtue; and one whose allegiance is bound to another nation may not
be suited for certain callings in ours. And while the alien guest is
not without his own special claims upon us, arising from our moral
tradition, they are of a different quality from those grounded in
our common humanity.''
   The appeals court noted that at the time of its ruling there was
a split on the Supreme Court on whether Section 1981 bans private
acts of discrimination _ as opposed to bias practiced by government
_ even against blacks or other racial minorities.
   The high court announced on April 25, 1988, it would consider
overturning its own 1976 decision allowing people to use Section
1981 to sue private citizens for race discrimination.
   But on June 15 the justices upheld the 1976 ruling _ while also
deciding that the 19th Century law does not permit suits charging
on-the-job racial harassment.
   Also, the court in May 1987 expanded the scope of Section 1981 to
include not only racial minorities but Jews, Arabs and other ethnic
groups as well.
   Bhandari, in the appeal acted on today, said the 5th Circuit
court dismissal of his suit conflicts with high court precedent.
   The appeals court ruling ``presents a direct conflict with
(Supreme Court) decisions holding that Section 1981 prohibits
discrimination against non-citizens based on alienage and that
Section 1981 prohibits discrimination in the making of private
contracts,'' lawyers for Bhandari said.
   The case is Bhandari vs. First National Bank of Commerce, 87-1293.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Kill Lawsuit Against Two Chicago Lawyers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to kill a 1984
lawsuit against two Chicago lawyers stemming from their defending
the city against charges of discrimination within its police
department.
   The court, without comment, turned away arguments that government
defense lawyers never may be sued for civil damages based on what
they do for their public client in a case.
   Nineteen Chicago police officers sued the city and various
officials in 1984, alleging discrimination in employment.
   James Montgomery, then the city's corporation counsel, and Donald
Hubert, one of Montgomery's top assistants, represented Chicago in
the case.
   They were named as defendants in a subsequent lawsuit. It alleges
that Montgomery and Hubert violated the federal Fair Credit
Reporting Act by hiring an investigative firm to obtain through
false pretenses credit reports on the police officers who had sued
the city.
   The suit against Montgomery and Hubert alleges that they intended
to use the information to embarrass and intimidate the officers.
   Montgomery and Hubert sought to have the lawsuit against them
dismissed. They said they are entitled to absolute immunity from
civil liability because the alleged misconduct occurred as part of
their representing Chicago in the job-discrimination suits.
   U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber refused to dismiss the
suit, and the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his ruling
last Oct. 21.
   The appeals court said that because the alleged misconduct was
investigatory in nature, and allegedly occurred outside federal
rules, it was ``removed from the judicial process and (is) not a
function that rests uniquely within the duties of an advocate.''
   Throughout most of its opinion, the appeals court seemed to
acknowledge that government defense lawyers are entitled to the same
absolute immunity from civil lawsuits afforded government
prosecutors.
   But in concluding, the appeals court said, ``We express no
opinion on whether, under similar circumstances, the unique
functions performed by prosecuting attorneys would entitle them to
greater immunity than afforded government defense counsel.''
   In the appeal acted on today, Chicago Corporation Counsel Judson
H. Miner represented Montgomery and Hubert. He said the appeals
court ruling ``is a dangerous narrowing of immunity (that) will
damage, rather than promote, the public concerns that gave rise to
the doctrine of absolute immunity for public attorneys.''
   Miner added, ``This is the first case to deny government defense
attorneys absolute immunity for conduct alleged to have been
undertaken in the course of representing their public client.''
   The case is Montgomery vs. Auriemma, 88-1439.

<HEAD>Orders Restudy of Dispute Over Philadelphia Transit Drug Testing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today ordered a lower court
to restudy a dispute over drug and alcohol testing for employees of
a mass transit agency in the Philadelphia area.
   The justices said the lower court should re-examine its ruling in
light of recent decisions that allowed the Conrail railroad to adopt
drug tests for its workers without first bargaining with its unions
and allowed mandatory drug testing of railroad employees involved in
accidents.
   In the case acted on today, a lower court ruling was challenged
by both the workers and their employer, the Southeastern
Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, known as SEPTA.
   SEPTA and its workers are unhappy with different aspects of a
ruling last December by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The appeals court said SEPTA did not violate the privacy rights
of employees in ``safety sensitive'' jobs by requiring them to
undergo random drug and alcohol tests.
   But the appeals court, based on narrower grounds, barred the
agency from testing any employees covered by the federal Railway
Labor Act.
   The federal law bars railroads from unilaterally adopting any
such major change in working conditions, the appeals court said. It
said the unions that challenged the tests are entitled to mediation
and conciliation procedures spelled out by the law.
   The Supreme Court ruled on June 19 that Conrail may use
previously approved physical fitness tests to screen for drug use.
It said the addition of drug screening is a minor change not
warranting collective bargaining.
   Conrail's tests are not random. They are to be administered
periodically to all workers during routine physical examinations. In
addition, employees returning to work after an absence would have to
undergo the tests.
   The high court last March 21 issued two key rulings on drug and
alcohol testing in the workplace. The justices upheld blood and
urine tests for railroad workers involved in accidents, and upheld
urine tests for U.S. Customs Service employees seeking
drug-enforcement jobs.
   In the case acted on today, SEPTA announced in 1987 its plan to
require random urine and breathalyzer tests for thousands of workers
with jobs affecting the safety of its more than a million daily bus,
train, streetcar and subway riders.
   The agency also adopted tests for employees returning to work
after absences. Those tests were declared unconstitutional by the
3rd Circuit court, and SEPTA and its unions subsequently reached a
settlement on the return-to-work tests.
   The cases are SEPTA VS. Transport Workers' Union, 88-1486, and
United Transportation Union vs. SEPTA, 88-1653.

   The Supreme Court refused today to allow
resident aliens sue in federal court to collect retroactive
unemployment benefits from the state of Colorado.
   The action comes 11 days after the justices ruled that Congress
has the power to strip state governments of their constitutional
immunity against private lawsuits.
   At issue in the Colorado case was whether such state immunity
should be overcome. Lower courts said no.
   A policy of the Colorado Department of Labor's division of
employment and training of refusing to pay unemployment benefits to
some previously employed aliens lawfully living in the state sparked
a 1984 lawsuit.
   The suit sought to have the policy declared a violation of the
Federal Unemployment Tax Act and to collect benefits it alleged were
wrongfully withheld.
   A federal trial judge ruled that the aliens would have to pursue
their claims through state administrative proceedings. The aliens
appealed, but the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the
suit Nov. 29.
   Noting that state court rulings and changes in immigration law
made clear that the aliens were eligible for unemployment benefits,
the appeals court rendered moot the need for future relief.
   Regarding the claims for back benefits, the 10th Circuit court
said the 11th Amendment prohibits such a raid on the state treasury
in federal court.
   The amendment says: ``The judicial power of the United States
should not be construed to extend to any suit ... (against a state)
by citizens of another state or by citizens or subjects of any
foreign state.''
   In decisions dating back to 1890, the Supreme Court has barred
anyone, in-state or out, from suing an unconsenting state _ or state
officials if the real target is a state's treasury. But in recent
years, the court has allowed some federal court lawsuits against
states.
   In the case today, lawyers for the aliens said the 10th Circuit
court's bar on federal suits to recover back unemployment benefits
was in conflict with rulings by other federal appeals courts.
   The case is Esparza vs. Valdez, 88-1432.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Illinois Doctor's Appeal in Lawyers-Fee Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
an Illinois doctor ordered to pay $254,000 in lawyers' fees to those
who successfully challenged a state abortion law.
   The court, consistent with a ruling by the justices last week in
an airline industry bias cae, let stand a lower court ruling
stemming from a 1979 lawsuit challenging an Illinois
abortion-regulating law that included criminal penalties for
physicians who violated it.
   A group of doctors sued various state officials, saying the law
violated physicians' rights and those of their patients.
   A federal judge barred enforcement of the law. Soon thereafter,
Dr. Eugene Diamond and two others asked to intervene in the case as
defenders of the law.
   Diamond said he was acting to defend his patients' interests and
his own professional interests.
   Diamond and another doctor, who has since died, appealed to the
Supreme Court in 1985 to overrule lower court decisions and
reinstate the law. State officials dropped out of the case,
declining to pursue it to the nation's high court.
   The justices in 1986 ruled that Diamond lacked legal standing to
appeal, thus leaving intact the victory won by the law's challengers.
   A federal judge and the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
subsequently ordered Diamond to help reimburse the winners' legal
fees. His share of the attorneys' fees, with interest, is $254,000.
   The 7th Circuit court ruled last May that Diamond can be forced
to help pay the fees even though he did not violate the
constitutional rights of those who challenged the law. Only public
officials and their agents may commit constitutional violations.
   The public officials in the case were sued under a key civil
rights law that authorizes reimbursement of attorneys' fees to
encourage legal representation for those whose rights are violated.
   Diamond and the others who intervened in the case in defense of
the law ``for all practical purposes'' became the ``alter ego'' of
the state officials, the appeals court said.
   ``We cannot ... ignore the fact that the intervenors' unilateral
decision ... to join with the state defendants in adamantly
defending the constitutionality of the abortion act rendered them
full-fledged parties to the lawsuit,'' the appeals court said.
   It added that the intervenors ``were thoroughly beaten'' in
numerous court proceedings by the law's challengers.
   The appeals court also rejected Diamond's arguments that forcing
him to help pay the other side's legal fees chills his free-speech
rights.
   A fee reimbursement system is not unlawful ``simply because it
forces those who choose voluntarily to interject themselves into
such lawsuits to think twice before engaging in battle,'' the
appeals court said.
   The case is Diamond vs. Charles, 88-664.

<HEAD>Court Sets Aside Ruling in Handicapped Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today told a lower court to
consider freeing New York officials from having to continue an
educational program for a blind, severely retarded man after he
turns 22.
   The justices set aside a ruling that required continued state
support, and told a federal appeals court to restudy its ruling in
light of their June 15 decision in a Pennsylvania case.
   That decision shields states from federal court lawsuits seeking
to enforce a federal law to help handicapped children.
   The New York case involves Clifford Burr of New York City who
turned 21 on Dec. 30. Burr attended, at public expense, a private
school for blind and retarded youngsters until he was 16.
   New York officials helped pay the cost under the federal
Education of the Handicapped Act, which requires an appropriate free
public education for handicapped individuals up to age 22.
   When the private school closed in 1984, Burr was referred to a
state-supported school, the New York Institute for the Education of
the Blind.
   That school refused to accept him, saying he needed training in
``life skills'' and was too retarded to have any academic potential.
   A state Department of Education hearing officer ruled 18 months
after the private school closed that Burr should be admitted. The
institute appealed to the state commissioner of education, who
upheld the decision three months later.
   Burr was allowed to attend the institute's program for those with
multiple handicaps.
   Kenneth and Betty Burr sued in an attempt to win compensation for
the two years their son was out of school while the case was
reviewed.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in December that
federal regulations requiring prompt consideration of such cases
were ``grossly violated.''
   ``It is true that a handicapped child does not have a right to
demand public education beyond the age of 21,'' the appeals court
said.
   ``Nevertheless, we believe that Clifford is entitled to a remedy
for a deprivation of the right that the (federal) statute clearly
provided him _ a free appropriate education between the ages of 3
and 21.''
   The case is Sobol vs. Burr, 88-1493.

<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. said today it will move its
6,000-employee retailing arm from the Sears Tower to the suburbs,
ending a bidding war that pitted the state of Illinois against the
Sunbelt.
   The Chicago Tribune said the nation's largest retailer was
offered $61 million in state incentives to stay in Illinois.
   Sears has been based in Chicago for more than a century.
   ``We believe this Chicagoland location will serve the best
interests of our company and its shareholders for decades to come,''
Chairman Edward Brennan said in a statement.
   Brennan said the move to Hoffman Estates, 20 miles outside
Chicago, will begin in 2{ to 3 years.
   Last fall, Sears announced a restructuring plan that included
selling the 110-story Sears Tower _ the world's tallest building _
and shifting Sears' Merchandise Group and its 6,000 employees to
less costly quarters.
   When the move is completed, only about 600 employees of Sears'
corporate staff will remain in the Sears Tower in space leased from
whoever buys the tower. Sears' huge catalog sales operation is
already based elsewhere.
   The Merchandise Group's move pitted Illinois against Sunbelt
states, especially North Carolina and Texas, which scrambled to
offer tax breaks and other incentives.
   The Chicago Tribune said Illinois offered an estimated $61
million, and local tax breaks will be worth about $178 million _ by
far the largest incentive package given to a business to move to or
stay in Illinois.
   ``The total proposal that was worked out is extremely competitive
with alternative sites,'' Brennan said. He said the Hoffman Estates
parcel was selected from about 50 sites in the Chicago area and
other states.
   Sears estimates that building a campus-style facility in Hoffman
Estates will cost $220 million.
   The Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times said the deal was cemented
Sunday after talks between Gov. James R. Thompson and Brennan.
   Brennan thanked Thompson and legislative leaders for ``agreeing
to support the pending legislation which has enabled us to make this
decision.''

<HEAD>Magazine Says Needless Delays Hurting Work on Dead Sea Scrolls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An article published today in an archaeological
review said an Israeli government timetable for scholarly work on
the Dead Sea Scrolls is a ``hoax and a fraud'' that will delay
publication of documents that may hold new insights on early Judaism
and Christianity.
   One member of the scroll publication team, Frank Moore Cross of
the Harvard Divinity School, conceded that publication of the
documets is proceeding slowly but said the ``fraud'' charge in the
magazine Biblical Archaeology Review is ``certainly incorrect.''
   The article by Hershel Shanks, editor of the review, said the
team of scholars assigned to the task, originally by the government
of Jordan and later by the government of Israel, ``has now become
more an obstacle to publication than a source of information.''
   Shanks called for opening the materials to research by ``any
scholar who so wishes.''
   The article included a copy of the timetable published by
Israel's Department of Antiquities, which calls for completion of
the work by the end of 1996.
   ``It is a hoax and a fraud,'' Shanks wrote. ``It is not a
timetable at all .. It doesn't specifiy what happens if the scholars
don't meet the timetable.''
   Cross, reached by telephone in Cambridge, said, ``The notion that
the timetable is a fraud, if that is the way it is put, is certainly
incorrect.''
   ``Timetables in scholarly work often are not kept precisely,'' he
said. ``They are sometimes beaten and they are sometimes delayed,
but the term fraud is wrong.''
   ``That the work has proceeded slowly is certainly true,'' Cross
said. ``And this is, if you wish, the norm rather than something
unusual in a find of this kind.''
   The first of the Dead Sea Scrolls, a set of ancient Hebrew texts,
were found in a cave in 1947. Some Biblical texts and a collection
of laws, stories and poetry were published soon after their
discovery. Even more of them, about 400 texts, have yet to be
released.
   ``The problem with these materials is not generally recognized,''
Cross said. ``These are not scrolls which were found intact, the
ones that have not been published, but are in literally hundreds of
thousands of pieces.''
   Shanks said some of the fragments ``are deteriorating so rapidly
that if the outside world cannot see them soon, it may never be able
to see them.''
   Cross, however, said that while the material is deteriorating it
is ``simply untrue'' that the documents will be lost if not speedily
published.
   ``The early photographs and the rephotographing that is going on
now are the way this material will be preserved,'' he said.
``Publication is not going to add anything to the original negatives
and the more recent ones.''
   The best place for them, he said, would be in a dry place deep
underground, like the caves in which they were preserved for
centuries.
   But, he added, ``We can't rebury them.''

   A moderate earthquake
hit Portugal's Azores islands today, causing panic and minor
injuries, officials said.
   The quake shook the islands of Pico and Graciosa in the
nine-island archipelago's central group, said Victor Hugo of the
Azores University vulcanology department. The islands are about 740
miles west of mainland Portugal in the Atlantic Ocean.
   The temblor's epicenter was to the north of Graciosa island, Hugo
said.
   The quake measured five to six on the Mercalli scale, which
gauges the intensity of a quake as felt in a specific location on a
scale of one for the weakest quake to 12 for the strongest.
   Island hospital officials were quoted by the Portuguese news
agency Lusa as saying there were minor injuries.
   An employee at Santa Cruz medical center, Graciosa, said a house
collapsed but the center had admitted no casualties.
   According to civil protection services, slight material damage
was registered but islanders panicked and rushed into streets.
   Vulcanology experts have been observing Furnas volcano that has
been murmuring since Saturday on the largest island of Sao Miguel,
Hugo said.
   The Azores lie close to the North Atlantic Ridge, a seismically
active line stretching north-south in the Atlantic Ocean where two
crustal plates are pulling apart.
   A major earthquake hit the Azores in January 1980, killing at
least 49 people and injuring more than 300 on the islands of Sao
Jorge and Terceira.

<TEXT>
   The Commodores, a black
American singing group, has canceled a July concert in Sun City
because of pressure from anti-apartheid groups, concert organizers
said today.
   The South African Musicians Alliance warned last week that it
planned protests against the group's visit to Sun City, the capital
of the nominally independent black homeland of Bophuthatswana.
   None of South Africa's race discrimination laws apply in
Bophuthatswana, but anti-apartheid advocates object to the homeland
system that designates certain areas of the country for specific
tribes.
   A Sun City entertainment official said the musical group has
since decided not to make the trip.
   ``This action restricts cultural freedom in the same way that
apartheid abuses people's freedom of speech and choice,'' said Hazel
Feldman, entertainment director of Sun International, which runs the
hotel and entertainment complex at Sun City.
   She said 80 percent of 30,000 tickets sold for the July 7 concert
were bought by blacks.
   ``The Commodores, who have won awards in the States for their
commitment to the people by the NAACP, were deeply sincere in their
belief that their trip would bring joy to their thousands of fans,
while focusing on their commitment to the abolition of apartheid,''
she said.
   Mrs. Feldman said the Commodores, whose hits include ``Night
Shift'' and ``Three Times a Lady,'' plan to explain their action at
a Los Angeles news conference on Wednesday.
   One member of the group, Milan Williams, was quoted by South
Africa's Weekly Mail on Friday as saying he would not join the tour.
At that time, the other three members of the group and a backing
band still planned to come.
   Sun City, South Africa's version of Las Vegas, is the most
glamorous of the entertainment complexes in the homelands. It pays
premium prices and has attracted such music acts as Frank Sinatra,
Rod Stewart, and recently, Laura Brannigan and Irene Cara.
   Mrs. Feldman accused the South African Musicians Alliance of
hypocrisy. ``We respect many of their views, but feel that it is
totally hypocritical that their members will happily play Mmabatho
Independence Stadium (in Bophuthatswana) and other `homeland'
venues, while singling out Sun City as the sole target of their
campaign.''

   Two activists went on trial Monday in
Czechoslovakia on incitement charges for which they face a five-year
jail sentence, a human rights group said.
   Frantisek Starek, an underground publisher, and his companian,
Iva Vojtkova, went on trial in the town of Usti nad Orlice, 90 miles
east of Prague, according to the Vienna-based International Helsinki
Federation.
   Starek, 36, chief editor of the underground magazine Vokno,
already has served two prison sentences for his indepdenent
activites.
   Starek was arrested in February after police confiscated the
entire archives of the magazine. ``An important source of
information on independent culture in Czechoslovakia in the last 20
years was lost,'' the human rights group said.
   Vokno also publishes books and an information bulletin on various
events of independent groups in Czechoslovakia.

   President Bush said today the battle against
crime in the streets is also a struggle to end violence against
women and to expand women's opportunities in the workplace.
   ``This war against women must stop,'' Bush declared to cheers at
a convention of the American Association of University Women.
   Making a pitch for his anti-crime package, the president said,
``All too often, violent crime also means crime against women.''
   ``I am angered and disgusted by the crimes against American women
and by the archaic and unacceptable attitudes that all too
frequently contribute to those crimes _ whether it involves spouse
abuse at home, or violence in the streets,'' said Bush. ``These are
evil acts that transcend racial and class lines. This war against
women must stop.''
   He said it was ``just unthinkable'' that his seven grandaughters
should not have the same opportunities in life as his four grandsons.
   ``No matter how equal the opportunities in our schools and
workplace, women will never have the same opportunities as men if a
climate of fear leaves them justificably concerned at walking to the
campus library at night, or reluctant to work late hours for fear of
getting out of some parking lot safely,'' the president said.
   ``Fundamentally, violence against women won't subside unless
public attitudes change. We must continue to educate police and
prosecutors, judges and juries, and we must engender a climate where
the message our children get, in teleivison and films, from schools
and parents, is that violence against women is wrong.''
   Bush received an honorary membership in the 140,000-member
organization. ``Technically that makes me the first AAUW member to
be president of the United States, but I know I won't be the last,''
he said to more cheers.
   The AAUW, founded in 1881, promotes equal opportunity and
advancement for women and girls at all levels of education.
   Bush was also meeting today with Japanese Foreign Minister
Hiroshi Mitsuzuka and Portuguese President Mario Soares.
   He was also holding a Rose Garden reception for former Democratic
state and local officials who have defected to the Republican Party.
   On Sunday, the president took visiting Australian Prime Minister
Bob Hawke out for a friendly game of golf at Andrews Air Force Base
in Maryland after entertaining him at Camp David.
   Bush insisted his golfing skills were ``just terrible.''
   ``I don't play golf,'' he said. ``I'm doing this just for good
will between Australia and the United States.''
   Bush will give Hawke a ceremonial greeting and host a state
dinner in his honor at the White House on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Home Sales Fail to Reflect Falling Mortgage Rates in May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prospective homebuyers failed to take advantage
of falling mortgage rates in May when sales of existing homes fell
5.6 percent to their lowest level in 16 months, a real estate trade
group reported Monday.
   The National Association of Realtors said sales of single-family
homes fell last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.21
million units, down from 3.4 million units in both March and April.
   The May resale rate was off 11.3 percent from a year ago, the
Realtors said, and was the lowest since 3.2 million units were sold
in January 1988.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said fixed-rate mortgage
interest dropped from 10.97 percent the first week of May to 10.48
percent at the end of the month.
   The Federal Reserve recently relaxed slightly the grip it has
held on the credit supply to restrain the economy and hold down
inflation.
   Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson on Monday suggested the
possiblity of a further interest rate decline when questioned about
inflation after addressing the United Shareholders Association.
   ``Well, that's a never-ending process, the fight against
inflation,'' Johnson said. ``So, I don't think we can ever be
totally confident. But, I think we are more optimistic about the
upcoming period and I think conditions look pretty good.''
   Nevertheless, Realtors President Ira Gribin said of the lag in
response to May's falling intest rates:
   ``Buyers are not going to start flooding the markets the instant
mortgage rates start to go down. It takes time for the tide to
change.''
   But Gribin suggested the pace of existing home sales will pick up
in June as people begin to take advantage of lower mortgage rates.
   The Realtors said the median price of existing homes in May was
$93,100, up $200 from April. The median is the point at which half
of the homes sold for more and half for less.
   The decline in sales was sharpest in the Midwest, where there had
been steady activity earlier this year. Sales were down 10.1 percent
below April to a rate of 800,000 units.
   The West, which also had been largely unaffected by mortgage
rates earlier this year, also posted a notable resale decline to
570,000 units, down 8.1 percent below the April rate.
   Sales of 590,000 units in the Northeast were 3.3 percent below
April. Sales in the South dropped to 1.23 million units, down 3.9
percent from April.

<HEAD>Officials Underestimating Spread of AIDS, GAO Concludes</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS grafs 9-11 pvs, Meanwhile, the ... Cytovene, with 5 grafs

<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A report today that federal officials are
underestimating the spread of AIDS raises questions about the
nation's ability to cope with the crisis, say congressmen who are
monitoring the epidemic.
   A General Accounting Office report says the number of AIDS cases
expected to be diagnosed over the next three years has been
undercounted by as much as one-third by the Centers for Disease
Control.
   ``The really frightening aspect of this report is it proves how
little we know about the AIDS epidemic,'' Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.,
said Sunday. He and Reps. John Dingell, D-Mich., and Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., requested the study.
   ``When these projections of AIDS cases go awry, it undermines
research, destroys the validity of our plans for taking care of AIDS
victims and conveys a false sense of confidence to our fellow
citizens that the AIDS epidemic is under control,'' Wyden said.
   The GAO, in a report being released today, estimated that 300,000
to 480,000 Americans will have been diagnosed with AIDS by the end
of 1991.
   This compares with CDC's estimated range of 185,000 to 320,000
cases through 1991.
   ``The CDC has done the best they could but they've been
underfunded,'' Waxman said on NBC's ``Today'' show. ``We need a new
survey in this country about American sexual patterns, which we
haven't had for 40 years.''
   ``The United States has the best AIDS reporting system in the
world,'' Dr. James Mason, assistant secretary of health and former
director of the CDC, said on the same show. ``That's why more than
60 percent of the cases reported in the world have been reported by
the United States. ...We can always do better, however.''
   Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration today announced
approval of a drug to treat an eye infection in AIDS patients that
can lead to blindness. It is the fourth drug to be approved for
treatment of AIDS or an AIDS-related condition.
   The drug, ganciclovir, has been widely available for several
months to AIDS patients with the eye infection, cytomegalovirus
retinitis, under a special FDA category called ``treatment IND''
that allows distribution of promising drugs to the gravely ill while
safety and effectiveness research continues.
   About 20 percent of AIDS patients develop the eye infection.
Syntex Corp. of Palo Alto, Calif., will market the drug under the
name Cytovene.
   The FDA also announced ``treatment IND'' status for an
experimental protein, r-erythropoietin, to treat severe anemia that
weakens nearly half of the 20,000 patients taking the anti-viral
drug AZT.
   FDA Commissioner Frank Young said the two actions reflect the
agency's commitment to getting promising new drugs to AIDS victims
quickly. He said that while there still is no cure for the disease,
these two drugs and others recently approved for commercial release
and treatment INDs can extend and improve the lives of AIDS
patients, making early diagnosis more important.
   The GAO evaluated 13 national forecasts of the cumulative number
of AIDS cases through the end of 1991 and found a range of
predictions from 85,000 to 750,000 cases. The report looked only at
the number of potential AIDS cases, not the number of people who
test positive for the AIDS-causing human immunodeficiency virus but
show no symptoms of AIDS.
   Projections of the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome
are important because they are used in deciding how much money is
spent on AIDS education, research projects and public health care
services for AIDS patients.
   Also, if faulty forecasting is underestimating the heterosexual
spread of AIDS, as the report concludes, the result ``may be luring
a significant number of Americans into a false sense of security,''
Wyden said.
   Sunday editions of The Washington Post said CDC officials
acknowledged serious underreporting of AIDS cases but said GAO
projections were too high.
   The report blamed the undercounting on a variety of factors,
including the absence of data on the size of risk groups, the
definition of what constitutes an AIDS case, reliance on incomplete
surveillance data, and the undercounting of heterosexuals at risk.
   The report said CDC must get more up-to-date and accurate
information about the risk groups if it hopes to improve its
projections.
   Earlir this month, a University of Chicago study also said CDC
may be significantly underestimating the number of Americans with
AIDS. The study attributed some of the undercounting to affluent
victims who are treated discreetly by physicians who do not report
cases of the disease.
   AIDS is spread by close contact with blood, blood products or
semen from infected people. Its chief victims are homosexual men and
intravenous drug users.
   As of May 31, 1989, AIDS had been diagnosed in 97,193 Americans,
of whom more than half, or 56,468, have died since June 1, 1981,
according to the CDC. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

   An armed forces colonel who
commanded the national firefighting corps was shot to death while
driving to work today in an attack the military blamed on leftist
rebels.
   Col. Robeto Armando Rivera Escobar, 45, died at the Military
Hospital shortly after the attack this morning, the armed forces
said in a statement.
   Rivera, former head of the National Security Police, was driving
to work alone in the southern part of the capital when three men in
a passing truck opened fire, the military said.
   Police said the attackers were armed with Soviet-made AK-47
assault rifles. They said two sticks of TNT were found on the street
near the scene of the shooting.
   The military blamed Rivera's shooting on urban commandos of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the leftist guerrillas
who have been at war with El Salvador's U.S.-backed government for
nine years.
   There was no immediate claim or denial of responsibility.
   Rivera was named head of the firefighting corps, a branch of the
armed forces, three weeks ago by the new rightist administration.

   The 420,000 gallons of oil spilled from a
tanker off Rhode Island had largely dispersed or evaporated by this
morning, officials said. Hundreds of people worked to clean up
spills in Delaware and Texas.
   Things were ``much, much better than yesterday,'' Stephen G.
Morin, a state environmental official, said after flying over the
stricken World Prodigy, which ran aground on a reef Friday at the
mouth of Narragansett Bay.
   In Delaware, officials also were optimistic, saying the much
heavier oil spilled in the Delaware River on Saturday was so
congealed in the cool water that shoreline damage was minimal.
Workers used rakes to remove football-size, tar-like gobs from the
river, where up to 800,000 gallons spilled.
   As a tropical storm approached Texas, crews there brought in
``supersucker'' vacuums to clean up a 250,000-gallon spill near
Houston.
   Morin, Rhode Island director of groundwater and wetlands, said he
and other officials flew more than 14 miles offshore and found only
one small patch of oil about four miles out that he said was
unlikely to reach shore.
   ``I haven't seen it anywhere on the beaches we've flown today,''
he said.
   Nevertheless, Gov. Edward D. DiPrete ordered beaches to remain
closed today, and a ban on shellfishing remained in effect.
   Since lobsters, flounders, cod and haddock _ important to the
region's fishing industry _ are now laying eggs, it is the worst
possible time for an oil spill, said Kenneth Sherman of the National
Marine Fisheries Service. Fish can swim away from the slick, but
larvae don't have that mobility, he said.
   DiPrete said the captain of the Greek-licensed World Prodigy,
Iakovis Georgudis, admitted he failed to wait for a pilot and
mistakenly changed course, sending the ship toward rocks.
   Hours after the accident, a tanker and an oil barge collided in
the Houston Ship Channel that connects the Texas city with Galveston
Bay, causing a spill. And early Saturday, heavy oil spilled in the
Delaware River after an Uruguayan tanker ran aground.
   Results of drug tests on Georgudis and a mate whose name was not
immediately available were expected by late today, although the
Coast Guard said drugs or alcohol were not believed to have been
factors in the accident.
   The crewmen's urine samples were mishandled, reportedly through
improper refrigeration, and new ones had to be taken 19 hours after
the accident, the Coast Guard said.
   A federal inquiry will be convened Tuesday, Coast Guard Adm.
Richard Rybacki said. State Attorney General James E. O'Neil said he
hopes to learn if Georgudis violated state law by approaching too
near the bay without a pilot.
   The Coast Guard reduced its estimate of the amount of oil spilled
to 420,000 gallons. Earlier estimates were as high as 1.6 million.
About 200 National Guardsmen, 120 prison inmates and 200 volunteers
fought the oil.
   The oil spread rapidly over nearly 30 square miles. At one point,
it threatened Block Island, a fashionable vacation spot, but this
morning officials said that worry had ebbed because the oil was
evaporating rapidly.
   ``You're reaching the point where you're running out of molecules
that can go anywhere,'' said a Coast Guard spokesman, Chief Warrant
Officer Rick Meidt.
   Most of Rhode Island's beaches reopened Sunday after overnight
winds pushed the oil offshore, but the governor today closed beaches
nearly to Connecticut.
   Elsewhere, contractors in the Delaware River hired 255 employees,
and Delaware agreed to provide 300 National Guardsmen to help remove
the heavy fuel oil floating in globs and occasionally washing ashore
in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
   Federal officials said this morning that shoreline damage was
minimal. Coast Guard Capt. Larry Murdock said there won't be much of
a problem unless the oil was somehow warmed to 95 degrees or higher
and liquified.
   The tanker, refloated Sunday, was carrying 18 million gallons of
heating oil. Officials said that they were unable to account for at
least 800,000 gallons but that the actual spill was probably less.
   Shoreline contamination was reported from Ridley, Pa., on the
outskirts of Philadelphia, to New Castle, Del., about 30 miles to
the south.
   Wildlife officials worked to protect Pea Patch Island, home to
several species of nesting shorebirds. Crews laid 1,700 feet of
oil-retaining booms along the island, one of the mid-Atlantic's
largest rookeries. One oil-covered duckling died, but the Coast
Guard said wildlife deaths would probably be limited because the oil
is so thick it won't easily smear onto animals' bodies.
   ``These are important nursing grounds and this is an important
time of year,'' said Thomas Malone, acting head of the University of
Maryland Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies.
   In Texas, crews aided by wind and waves from the approach of
Tropical Storm Allison used seven huge vacuum machines to try to
pick up the oil.
   By this morning, about a third of the oil had been sucked from
the Bayport Channel, where the oil was flowing, said Coast Guard
spokesman Bob Morehead.
   ``They're stepping up their cleanup efforts to try to get it out
before the storm comes in,'' Morehead said.
   The Coast Guard scheduled a hearing on Tuesday to investigate
Friday's collision of the tanker Rachel-B and a barge owned by
Coastal Towing Co. of Houston.

<HEAD>Court to Use Ohio Case to Rule on Outlawing Child Nudity Material</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, setting the stage for an
important child pornography ruling, said today it will decide
whether states may outlaw possession of ``lewd'' material depicting
child nudity.
   The court said it will use an Ohio case to explore how far states
may go to protect children without violating freedom of expression.
   The justices ruled in 1982 that states may outlaw material
depicting sexual performances by children. But that ruling stopped
short of banning mere possession of ``kiddie porn.''
   That ruling was aimed at such activities as photographing minors
in lewd poses or promoting or distributing the material.
   In the case acted on today, the court will hear arguments during
its 1989-90 term beginning in October, with a ruling not expected
until sometime in 1990.
   The case stems from the prosecution of Clyde J. Osborne, 61, of
Columbus, who was sentenced to six months in jail for possessing
four photos of a nude boy. Prosecutors said he got the photos from a
Florida mail-order business and had placed them in a photo album in
his home.
   Columbus police searched his home in July 1985 after being told
by a Florida postal inspector that two people arrested there said
Osborne had bought photos of nude boys.
   The Ohio Supreme Court last July upheld the state law against
possessing child pornography.
   The law makes exceptions for parents or guardians of a child or
for material that serves a ``bona fide artistic, religious,
governmental, judicial or other proper purpose.''
   The state court rejected arguments that the law is too vague or
that someone can be convicted under it without realizing he or she
is committing a crime.
   ``We have no difficulty finding that the jury would have believed
beyond a reasonable doubt that (Osborne) was aware of the nature of
the photographs,'' the state court said.
   An anticipated U.S. Supreme Court showdown over possession of
child pornography fizzled last Wednesday when the justices sent a
Massachusetts case back to that state's courts for further action.
   The case acted on today is Osborne vs. Ohio, 88-5986.

   The owner of a gas station and
convenience store caught a burglar breaking into his business over
the midsummer holiday, the 155th attempted break-in in 20 years.
   Owner William Hecktor has foiled 128 burglaries at the station,
according to the Dagens Nyheter newspaper.
   Break-ins are a rarity in a country that is regarded as having
little street crime.
   The station, near Eslov in southern Sweden, is in a remote area
20 miles from the closest police station. Police officer Soini
Haanpaa said Hecktor had learned to depend on himself because there
is little police can do to help.
   With the help of neighbors, a sophisticated alarm system and his
dog, he ``does a fantastic job'' of deterring crime, Haanpaa said.
   ``You would think that the word would get around that the station
is not such a good place for robberies,'' said Haanpaa.

   Moviegoers went batty over the Caped Crusader,
with ``Batman'' taking in a record $43.6 million and giving
Hollywood its biggest weekend ever.
   The film, starring Michael Keaton as Batman and Jack Nicholson as
the archvillian Joker, helped the nation's theaters over the weekend
gross a record $95 million-plus overall.
   ``Batman's'' debut on 2,193 screens surpassed the three-day
record $29.4 million set just a week earlier by ``Ghostbusters II,''
studio receipts showed today.
   ``This is tremendous. It is the biggest weekend ever in the
history of the business,'' said John Krier of Exhibitor Relations
Co., which tracks box-office performance.
   The previous overall box-office record for a three-day weekend
was $92 million, said Krier.
   ``Batman'' also broke every daily record.
   It took in $15.6 million on Friday to beat the $10.2 million by
``Ghostbusters II'' a week earlier, $14.8 million on Saturday to top
the record $11.2 million by ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade''
on May 27, and $13.2 million on Sunday to top the May 28 mark of
$10.2 million by ``Last Crusade.''
   In second place was Disney's ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' which
grossed $14.2 million and broke all opening weekend box office
tallies for that studio, said Krier. ``Three Men and a Baby'' was
Disney's previous leader with $13.1 million over the 1987-88 New
Year's weekend.
   ``Ghostbusters II'' was third with $14 million, ``Indiana Jones
and the Last Crusade'' was fourth with $7.8 million and ``Dead Poets
Society'' was fifth with $7.6 million.

   Residents of the southern Algerian town
of Sud-Aissa burned buildings in street riots to protest cuts in
water service, the Algerian Press Service reported.
   The most recent water cut, which lasted several days and extended
into the weekend, sent 1,500 demonstrators into the streets Saturday
to burn public and private buildings in the small town 125 miles
south of Algiers.
   Several vehicles, including two belonging to the police, were set
ablaze, the news agency reported Sunday. It did not indicate whether
there had been any injuries.
   In April, riots spread throughout Algeria because of
deteriorating economic conditions and price increases in the North
African country of 25 million. The demonstrations led to reforms in
Algeria's constitution and the government of President Chadli
Benjedid.

<HEAD>Anderson Reprimanded by Committee of Journalists in Gun Incident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A committee of journalists reprimanded
columnist Jack Anderson on Monday for his ``role in bringing a gun
into the Capitol'' for a television show on terrorism but did not
revoke his press credentials. He rejected the reprimand.
   Anderson has said he engineered the plan to smuggle the gun into
the Capitol last month to show a need for better security. He did
not carry in the gun himself.
   ``We believe that you abused your privilege as a credentialed
member of the daily press gallery, and needlessly jeopardized the
relationship reporters have with the Capitol police,'' Jeffrey
Birnbaum, of The Wall Street Journal, wrote in a letter to Anderson.
   He said the five-member committee, which provides credentials to
reporters who cover Congress, ``has voted unanimously to reprimand
you for your role in bringing a gun into the Capitol last month.''
   Anderson responded with his own letter, saying: ``With no
disrepect intended, I must reject the reprimand of the standing
committee.''
   He said he knew that several terrorist leaders were planning to
make the United States their target and that the political leaders
would be in danger.
   ``I'm appalled that the congressional leaders whose lives I
wanted to protect seem less concerned about the threat to their
security than the political embarrassment I apparently caused them.''
   During an interview May 24 with Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., in Dole's
private office, Anderson pulled from his pocket a gun that had been
concealed in his televison crew's equipment. The incident occurred
during taping for a segment of his TV program and Anderson claimed
it was to demonstrate security breaches in the building.
   But it is a felony to bring a firearm onto the Capitol grounds or
into any of the buildings, and Capitol police and the U.S. attorney
are investigating whether to press charges against Anderson, said
officer Dan Nichols.
   Anderson told the Standing Committee of Correspondents he would
not be at their meeting unless Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, and Dole, the minority leader, were there.
   They did not appear, though they had initiated the action by
asking Birnbaum in a June 6 letter to ``review this serious incident
and take sufficient action to deter any future repetition of this
act.''
   The committee, whose leaders are elected by journalists, was
established by Congress to decide who should work in the press
galleries and to allocate space in the galleries.
   Along with sending a letter of reprimand to Anderson, the
committee voted to revise its regulations so that any credentialed
member who disobeys security rules in the future would be subject to
suspension.
   ``When you used your position as a reporter to have a weapon
brought into the Capitol, and then produced it in the office of Sen.
Robert Dole on May 24, you violated the trust that our extension of
the credential to you implies,'' said Birnbaum's letter to Anderson.
``Therefore we admonish you in the strongest terms.''
   While Anderson is credentialed, he has not picked up his
identification tag and was using a visitor's pass at the time of the
incident. He said he entered the Capitol as an ordinary citizen and
``was afforded no special privileges or treatment because I am a
journalist.''
   Birnbaum said that he did not recommend suspending the
investigative reporter because he was not carrying the credential,
there was no precedent for such action and ``our own rules are
sufficiently unclear that so drastic a step might be misconstrued as
the rendering of a judgment by an official press body on the quality
of Mr. Anderson's journalism.''
   Other members of the committee are Charles Green of Knight-Ridder
Newspapers, Eliot Brenner of United Press International, Mary Deibel
of Scripps Howard News Service and Thomas Gorey of the Salt Lake
Tribune.

   The government will ban versions of
the Koran using Roman script, allowing only those in Jawi and Arabic
scripts, an official said Monday.
   Abdul Hamid Othman, director general of the Islamic Affairs
Division in the prime minister's department, said the ban would take
effect in about six months.
   Under the ban, anyone possessing the Koran in Roman script could
be imprisoned for up to three years or fined about $1,850, he said.
   The National Fatwa Committee, which rules on Islamic matters,
decided to impose the ban, because the Roman version did not give
proper pronunciations.
   The Jawi script looks like Arabic or Urdu script.
   Islam is Malaysia's official religion and about half of its 17
million people are Moslems. The others are mainly Buddhists, Hindus
and Christians.

   Re-enactments staged on the great
battlefields of the Civil War usually end the same way _ with boys
in blue routing the Confederate gray.
   But not so in Mississippi this summer.
   At Vicksburg, cannons will boom and muskets flash over the Fourth
of July weekend to commemorate a clear-cut Confederate victory over
Yankee troops when Gen. Ulysses S. Grant made his first major
attempt to silence the Mississippi River fortress 126 years ago.
   And at Brice's Cross Roads in Lee County, scene of a textbook
attack by Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest's cavalry,
historians recently replaced 99 markers to unknown Southern dead
with 102 stones bearing the names of Rebel soldiers known to have
been killed in the June 10, 1864, battle.
   The Vicksburg artillery demonstrations and engagements by several
hundred re-enactors will take place Saturday and Sunday on private
land in Vicksburg where the actual engagement being commemorated
occurred on May 22, 1863.
   Grant's all-out attack was beaten back by the Vicksburg garrison
during a one-day battle that resulted in 3,000 Union soldiers killed
or wounded. The Confederates suffered about 500 casualties.
   Realizing a direct attack would be too costly, Grant encircled
the city on land and water, starving the garrison into surrender 47
days later on July 4, 1863.
   ``Last year was the first year we had a re-enactment at Vicksburg
and, since it was the 125th anniversary of the siege, we felt it
only appropriate to do the last few days of it, including the
surrender,'' said Gordon Cotton, director of the Old Court House
Museum and organizer of the ``Vicksburg Civil War Re-enactment.''
   ``We did not realize when we planned last year's event that
re-living those days would be so emotionally straining on everyone
here,'' said Cotton.
   ``This year, the re-enactors wanted to do something different,
something very dramatic and we didn't want to go through another
defeat,'' he said. ``So this battle was the obvious choice.''
   Across the state in Lee County, history buff Charles Sullivan and
his associates found another way to remember a Confederate victory.
   ``Up to this point, all the battlefields I have marked were of
Confederate defeats,'' said Sullivan, a department head at
Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College's Perkinston campus and
Confederate graves registrar in Mississippi for the Sons of
Confederate Veterans. ``This time it was different.''
   At the Brice's Cross Roads battlefield, about six miles west of
Baldwyn, Forrest won a major tactical victory over Gen. S.D.
Sturgis' larger Union force. When the fighting ended, over 1,500
Union soldiers had been captured.
   ``For Forrest, it was a textbook battle that has been studied at
war colleges around the world,'' said Sullivan, who will participate
in the re-enactment at Vicksburg. ``Many believe this was his
greatest victory for, heavily outnumbered, he was able to destroy
the federal cavalry first and then the infantry.''
   Sullivan said the markers to the unknown dead were placed at the
battle site sometime after 1930, following passage of a federal law
allowing military stones for fallen Confederates.
   ``Thanks to the research of a friend named Roger Hansen, who has
a network of colleagues throughout the country who trade information
on Confederate dead, we were able to identify 102 men killed at the
crossroads on the Confederate side.''
   Sullivan said the new markers were arranged in alphabetical order
``because we know they were placed in a burial pit but we do not
know exactly where each body was situated.''

   South Korea's automakers will expand
production facilities to produce 2 million vehicles a year starting
in 1990, up from the current 1.6 million, news reports said Monday.
   Led by Hyundai Motor Co., the nation's largest automaker,
manufacturers will construct facilities to make another 350,000
units a year, according to the South Korean news agency Yonhap.
   Two other firms, Ssangyong and Asia, will manufacture vehicles
when the government lifts a ban on further production in July,
Yonhap said.
   Hyundai's current production capacity of 850,000 vehicles will
grow to 1 million by early next year, Yonhap said.
   Kia Motors Corp. will finish an assembly line with a 150,000-car
capacity next year, Yonhap said, increasing its annual capacity to
600,000 vehicles.
   Daewoo Motor Co. is to expand production of medium-sized cars and
expects to construct a factory to produce 50,000 cars, Yonhap said.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rob Lowe's lawyer asked a judge today to throw out
a lawsuit accusing the heartthrob actor of videotaping a teen-age
girl during a sex act.
   Edgar Neely told U.S. District Judge G. Ernest Tidwell that the
girl's mother, who brought the suit, has no legal standing to sue
under a Georgia law that allows parents to seek damages over the
seduction of an minor child.
   The judge did not indicate when he would rule.
   Lowe, 25, is accused of making the sexually explicit tape of Lena
Jan Parsons, then 16, and another woman in his hotel suite during
last summer's Democratic National Convention in Atlanta. The suit
was filed May 12 by Lena Arlene Wilson, the girl's mother, who is
seeking unspecified damages.
   Neely argued today that even if the allegations were true, the
seduction law is probably unconstitutional, Ms. Wilson is not the
girl's custodial parent as required by law and the woman suffered no
direct emotional harm.
   Ms. Wilson does not live with her daughter, Neely said.
   J. Hue Henry, Ms. Wilson's lawyer, argued that Lowe seduced Miss
Parsons and that Ms. Wilson has suffered direct harm.
   ``One could see how a parent could and would suffer extreme
emotional distress'' from seeing such a tape, he said. ``This is a
case of wanton, willful, intentional misconduct.''
   Lowe did not attend the hearing.
   Those who have seen the tape _ and they are legion _ don't seem
to question that they are seeing the face and hearing the voice of
the star of such films as ``St. Elmo's Fire,'' and ``About Last
Night.''
   Atlanta's TV stations have run excerpts, over and over and over,
with little shadowy boxes blocking out the participants' private
parts. The city's alternative weekly, Creative Loafing, reviewed the
tapes as cinema verite.
   Rock satirist Mojo Nixon, in a recent Atlanta concert, reworked
several of his songs to include verses about the scandal, led his
audience in chants of ``Oh, no! Rob Lowe!'' and asked _ apparently
seriously _ if anyone knew where he could see the tapes for himself.
   Doubtlessly, someone in the audience did. The tapes have been
passed around the city's club and party circuit _ not to mention the
journalism community _ so much that bragging about having seen them
is now out of fashion.
   In court papers, Lowe denied he ``committed any wrongful acts
giving rise to liability.''
   Lowe's attorneys also have filed papers accusing Ms. Wilson and
Henry of using ``extortionist tactics'' to force Lowe to pay as much
as $500,000 to avoid bad publicity. They also accused Ms. Parsons of
helping circulate the tape.
   ``I knew they would resort to desperate tactics at some point,''
Henry responded. ``I expected them to sling all kinds of mud because
their client is the one on film in compromising positions, and there
is no way they can avoid that fact.''
   Henry said Ms. Wilson rejected a $35,000 ``take-it-or-leave-it''
offer from Lowe's attorneys in February, but he denied making any
$500,000 settlement demands.
   The videotape that has circulated shows the man believed to be
Lowe in a room with Ms. Parsons and another woman. It shows the
teen-ager having sex with the woman, with ``Lowe'' heard and seen
giving directions like a movie directr, but it does not show
intercourse between the actor and Ms. Parsons. A different segment
of the tape, apparently taken at a different time, allegedly shows
Lowe having sex with others.
   Henry has charged in court papers that Lowe also had sex with
Miss Parsons while watched by an unidentified female.
   The Fulton County district attorney's office said Lowe is under
investigation on possible charges of sexual exploitation of a minor,
which carries up to 20 years in prison.

   Workers cleaning up a Delaware River oil
spill of up to 800,000 gallons used rakes and even their hands this
morning to pick up gobs of oil so big and heavy they jammed skimming
machinery.
   The oil came from a Uruguayan tanker that ran aground near here
early Saturday just south of the Pennsylvania line. The spill came
less than 24 hours after big spills in Texas and Rhode Island.
   The cause of the accident was under investigation.
   Officials said that the congealed oil is difficult to clean up
but has caused little damage to the Delaware, Pennsylvania and New
Jersey coast because the gobs tend to bounce along the shoreline
rather than spread out.
   The brownish blobs range in size from a football to 2 feet or
more and have the consistency of roofing tar, said Coast Guard
spokesman Rick Woods. They're so gooey they can be picked up by hand.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer Dave Oney said the oil will have little
effect on wildlife. ``It is so solidified, fish can swim around it
and a bird would have to fly right into it to get hurt,'' he said.
   Officials said they could not account for at least 800,000
gallons from the tanker, which was carrying 18 million gallons of
refined industrial heating oil. But they said it is doubtful the
full amount is in the water, and there is no sign much of it has
sunk to the bottom of the river.
   The cleanup ran into problems because skimmers called in were
unable to deal with blobs floating in the water. Instead, the blobs
were pushed toward shore with booms and then raked in.
   David Gartin of J &amp; J Spill Service of Norristown, Pa., manager
of the cleanup, said the job would probably take more than a week.
   Globs of oil have been spotted as far north as Ridley Park, Pa.,
on the outskirts of Philadelphia; and as far south as New Castle,
Del., about 30 miles downstream. Some oil has also washed onto the
New Jersey side of the Delaware River.
   The Presidente Rivera was refloated Sunday and taken to its
original destination, the Sun Co. refinery in nearby Marcus Hook,
Pa., where most of the remaining oil was loaded into storage tanks.
   Nelson said that the ship was owned by the Uruguayan government,
which is assuming full financial responsibility for the spill.
   Delaware wildlife officials worked to protect Pea Patch Island,
in the river south of New Castle, which is home to several species
of nesting shorebirds. Crews laid 1,700 feet of oil-retaining booms
along the island.
   Todd Nelson, a Coast Guard spokesman in Philadelphia, said that
because of the weather, water conditions and oil consistency, the
fuel is not breaking up.
   ``The water isn't particularly choppy and there isn't much heavy
wave action, so the oil moves back and forth with the tide,'' he
said.
   Nelson said cleanup contractors have hired more than 250
temporary employees and the state of Delaware has agreed to send 300
National Guardsmen.
   ``The system will be operating tomorrow at the maximum capacity
possible,'' he said Sunday. ``As we have never done this type of
operation before, it will take some time to gear up.''
   Coast Guard Lt. Jim Weakley and Gov. Michael Castle said they
were unable to confirm reports of a mechanical problem aboard the
ship.
   Drug and alcohol tests were performed on all personnel involved
in navigating the ship. The results were not immediately available.

<DATELINE>ALLENBY BRIDGE, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of white-robed
Israeli Moslems crossed this army checkpoint Monday for the annual
pilgrimage to Mecca, and Israeli officials urged them to help
mediate between the Jewish state and its Arab neighbors.
   ``There has been a lot of hatred, mistrust and enmity,'' Cabinet
member Ehud Olmert said at a ceremony marking the pilgrims' crossing
the bridge to Jordan for the trip to Saudi Arabia.
   ``You can serve as a bridge'' between Israel on the one side, and
Arab states and Palestinians on the other, said Olmert, the prime
minister's adviser on Arab affairs.
   But some of the 5,400 Israeli Arabs pilgrims said they identified
more with the Palestinians' 18-month uprising in the occupied lands
than with Israel.
   ``We are proud of the uprising. It has given us more respect
outside,'' said Hosni Nuseirat, 42, of the northern Israeli village
of Taibeh.
   ``We have deep ties to the Palestinians in the occupied
territories. It's religion that binds us together, and we are all
members of the same nation,'' Nuseirat said.
   There are 810,000 Israeli Arab citizens, from families who
remained in Israel when the Jewish state was founded in 1948.
   About 1.7 million Palestinians live in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, including those who fled Israel in 1948 and residents of
the occupied lands before they were captured in the 1967 Middle East
war.
   Nuseirat and about 1,400 other Israeli Arab pilgrims, most in
white robes and white prayer caps, sat in two dozen buses waiting
for a last security check before crossing the Allenby Bridge into
Jordan.
   Women wearing white scarves repacked their belongings after
searches by soldiers, reassembling bed rolls and plastic shopping
baskets filled with rice, sugar, olives, coffee and tea.
   About 5,400 Israeli Arabs, up about 400 from last year, are
leaving for Mecca via Jordan this week. They are scheduled to return
by July 21.
   Mecca is Islam's holiest site, and making the hajj, or
pilgrimage, is one of the chief religious duties of Moslems.
   Saudi Arabia and Jordan, both technically at war with Israel,
first permitted Israeli Arabs to join the hajj in 1977. Saudi Arabia
limits the number of pilgrims, and Israel only gives exit permits to
Moslems who are 30 years of age or older, citing security reasons.
   ``We are angry about this. In our religion, there is no such
thing as an age limit,'' said Yehiah Haj, 31, also of Taibeh.
   Haj made his first pilgrimage last year and said Israeli Arabs
attract much attention in Saudia Arabia. ``When we say where we are
from, people gather around. They want to know what's going on in
Israel,'' he said.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man considered the spiritual leader of Shiite
Moslems in Europe said Monday he wants to run for president of Iran
but is being refused a valid passport to return to his homeland.
   Ayatollah Mehdi Rouhani said he wrote a letter June 10 to
Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi to inform him of his bid for
the presidency. He said that on Friday, he was instructed to go the
Iranian Embassy to fill out the proper forms, but on Monday he was
told he could not get his passport validated.
   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani is the only official
candidate for the July 28 election. Wednesday is the last day to
file as a candidate.
   The Iranian Embassy was closed Monday and officials there could
be reached for comment.
   Rouhani, 53, has spent 25 years in Europe and is a resident of
France. He said he has been unable to get his Iranian passport
validated for four or five years.
   Rouhani, who holds a doctorate in philosophy from the Sorbonne,
said with his religious status and education he represents both the
intellectual and religious currents in Iran.
   ``There is no law to forbid me from running,'' he said, ``but
they found a pretext to stop me from returning to Iran.''
   Rouhani says he supports the 1979 Iranian revolution which
overthrew Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi but disagrees with the current
government. He said he decided to run for president following the
June 3 death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

   Most yearbooks give space to students who
excel in sports and other extracurricular activities. Logan High
School's 1988-89 edition also recognizes students who have given
birth.
   ``Babies raising babies is something we are all having to deal

   She said students decided to include a section on teen-age
parents as they searched for a theme involving student
responsibility.
   ``What could be more responsible? It might be a controversial
theme, and some may have negative thoughts about it, but it is such
a prevalent thing now, I don't expect any severe criticism,'' Mazon

   ``Suicide is always a big question somewhere, but it is
definitely the wrong one. You know this when you are blessed with
holding your child.
   ``Babies can be the most wonderful thing in the world, if you are
ready to give up most of your time and take the responsibility of
another life coming before your own.''

<HEAD>Season's First Tropical Storm Brings Heavy Rain to Texas Coast</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with storm strength, position, evacuation.
No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first tropical storm of the season developed
in the Gulf of Mexico this morning, bringing heavy rain and flooding
to the Texas coast.
   The National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., upgraded a
slow-moving tropical depression to a storm about 7 a.m. after its
sustained winds reached 39 mph.
   By late morning, Tropical Storm Allison had sustained near 50 mph
with gusts to 65 mph, the National Weather Service said. It was
moving north about 5 mph and was southwest of Freeport, about 55
miles south of Houston.
   A voluntary evacuation was issued for Quintana Beach, a small
island community of about 150 south of Houston. Sheriff's deputies
went door-to-door telling residents that rising waters could close
the bridge to the mainland.
   ``We're telling them if they want to get out, they'd better get
out now,'' Chief Deputy Charles Wagner said.
   Tides in Galveston were about three feet above normal.
   ``There probably will be some minor wind damage. The main thing
is the rain. It's a heavy rainmaker,'' National Weather Service
meteorologist Larry Vannozzi said.
   A tropical storm warning was issued from Freeport to Morgan City,
La. There were reports of flooding south of Galveston, Matagorda and
Brazoria.
   Rain drenched the coast, with as much as 6 inches reported from
midnight to midmorning. A flash flood watch was in effect for much
of the southeast Texas coast.
   In Louisiana, shrimp fishermen stayed home and tourists were
urged to avoid coastal areas. ``It's not really nasty here _ yet,''
Calcasieu Parish, La., Deputy Bradley Fontenot said. ``They say it's
going to be.''
   On Sunday, the Galveston County beach patrol banned swimming.
``It's got the gulf kicked up pretty nasty out there right now,''
patrol director Vic Maceo said.
   In Corpus Christi, some residents waited to take precautions.
   ``The surfing and wind surfing are real popular today _ they're
out there right now,'' police dispatcher Richard Diaz said Sunday.
   The tropical depression had its origins in Hurricane Cosme, which
moved from the Pacific Ocean across Mexico last week.

<HEAD>If All Aid Requests Honored, Deficit Could Triple: Yeutter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said
Monday that the federal deficit would double or triple if all
requests for farm aid were honored.
   Yeutter, speaking at a meeting of the American Seed Trade
Association, said about 75 percent of his mail comes from people
asking for more government assistance of some kind.
   ``Most of these letters are coming from members of Congress, of
course, reflecting concerns of their constitutents,'' he said.
   ``If the government were to honor all of those pleas for
additional funding, that ... $150 billion deficit that we have now
would probably double or treble, just based on agricultural requests
alone, aside from what the rest of the economy is asking for.''
   Yeutter said there are many views as to whether American farmers
have become addicted to federal subsidies.
   He said his home state of Nebraska last year had a net farm
income of ``something over $2 billion,'' of which more than $1
billion came from the government.
   ``That's pretty addictive,'' he said.

   French undersea explorer Jacques Cousteau has
floated a whale over Paris to promote his new Museum of the Sea, due
to open July 11 in Paris' Les Halles district.
   The 30-meter dappled blue plastic mammal came up for air on
Sunday, bobbing in clear blue skies high above the traffic swirling
around the Arc de Triomphe.
   Cousteau, 79, who was admitted to the Academie Francaise on
Thursday, said the lifesize balloon-beast would join other creatures
in the aquarium.
   ``There's not a single living animal there,'' said Cousteau, who
has seen plenty of the real thing. ``With audiovisual devices,
special effects, animated scenes and phantoms, we are going to show
people the natural behavior of these animals.''
   Cousteau will open the museum with his son, Jean-Michel.

   Bird took the court against National Basketball Association
competition Sunday night for the first time since bone spurs were
removed from both heels. Lingering soreness in the left foot kept
him from returning to the court during the playoffs.
   He may not be back to full form, but he scored a reassuring 33
points in 29 minutes in the second Larry Bird Pro All-Star
Scholarship Classic, a charity game.
   ``Well, it's been a while but overall I was pleased with this

   Former White House aide Oliver North read from
the Bible at the wedding of his brother, Timothy.
   ``I haven't granted an interview in two years and all I will say
is that I am glad to be here for my brother's wedding,'' North said
after Saturday's ceremony at Sacred Heart Church in west Utica.
   During the ceremony, North read from the book of Psalms in a
leather-bound Bible. ``The Lord is kind and merciful to those who
fear him,'' he said.
   Outside church, North joked with guests and obliged all who
wanted their picture taken with the former Marine lieutenant
colonel. That included a woman in shorts who ran over to him holding
up an Ollie North T-shirt and telling him he was her hero.
   North hugged her and said, ``God bless you ... thank you.''
   A federal jury in Washington last month convicted North of three
felonies and acquitted him of nine other charges in the scandal. He
faces up to 10 years in prison at sentencing July 5.

   As the music man behind the movie ``Batman,''
composer Danny Elfman's major challenge was to come up with a score
that wouldn't be drowned out by the film's multimillion-dollar sound
effects.
   ``It's hard to find something that will carry a scene, especially
when you know there's going to be a jet engine or machine gun fire.
Even the Batmobile had a jet engine,'' said Elfman, one of
Hollywood's hottest composers. He also leads the pop group Oingo
Boingo.
   Elfman has scored 10 films in the past four years, starting with
``Pee-wee's Big Adventure,'' in between writing songs for Oingo
Boingo and performing with the group.
   The ``Batman'' score took six weeks to complete, including two
songs contributed by rock star Prince. Elfman said last week that
the ``Batman'' score, at 75 minutes in length, was his most
challenging project.
   ``The scenes seemed to carry their own music,'' Elfman said. ``I
work visually. I don't know how to approach music on an intellectual
level.''

   The State Department on Monday urged the Cuban
government to take ``all necessary precautions'' in its plan to stem
drug trafficking by shooting down planes that refuse to land for
inspection.
   ``While we welcome any legitimate action to interdict narcotics
trafficking, we urge the Cuban government to take all necessary

   Cuban authorities announced the guidelines Saturday after
arresting a highly decorated general and nine other military

   The announcement said any aircraft that illegally penetrates
Cuban air space and refuses to obey an order to land for inspection
will be shot down.
   Earlier, U.S. officials said they had detected an increase in the
use of Cuban air space and territorial waters to smuggle drugs from
South America into the United States.

<HEAD>JVC Jazz Festival Opens Over Weekend</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jazz made its annual summer visit to New York
over the weekend, with the start of the JVC Jazz Festival.
   The dueling trumpets of Miles Davis and Wynton Marsalis launched
the hot music event at Avery Fisher Hall on Friday night. Marsalis,
a technically astute and rather mainstream musician whose background
is firmly based in classical music, opened the concert.
   Michael White joined him on clarinet during ``New Orleans
Function,'' a piece with marching band flare.
   Davis, one of the greatest trumpet players the jazz world has
ever known, stuck to his funky colorings of such contemporary pop
pieces as ``Human Nature,'' rather than breezing through his legacy
of music dating to the 1940s. He also did a lilting version of Cyndi
Lauper's ``Time After Time.''
   While Miles and Wynton blew the house down at Avery Fisher,
singer Joe Williams was saluted at Carnegie Hall.
   On Saturday afternoon, Marsalis introduced youngsters to jazz at
a concert titled ``Coolin' It With Snoopy.'' And, yes, the famed
``Peanuts'' doggy was there. Saturday night featured a salute to
Benny Goodman, starring Lionel Hampton and George Benson.
   A special concert of African and Caribbean music played at Avery
Fisher Hall on Sunday night.Featured were Haiti's Tabou Combo de
Petion-Ville and the Bhundu Boys from Zimbabwe.
   While the rhythms exploded at Avery Fisher, Ella
Fitzgeraldquietly stunned a Carnegie Hall audience.

<NOTE>Joe Williams, Basie Band Celebrate Singer's 70th Birthday</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nobody loves family reunions more than jazz
people. And what more joyous reunion could there be than that of
singer Joe Williams and the Count Basie Orchestra.
   Williams became a star when he joined the Basie band in the
mid-1950s. Williams' 1955 recording with the band of ``Every Day I
Have the Blues'' made him internationally known. Eventually, in
1961, he struck out on his own and has had continued success.
   His 70th birthday seemed like a natural occasion for a
``reunion'' with the Basie bunch, led these days by saxophonist
Frank Foster. It also made for a splendid opening night Friday of
the JVC Jazz Festival, which first came to town 18 years ago as the
Newport Jazz Festival. It has changed sponsors and names a few
times, but it's still a premiere jazz bash. JVC is the Japanese
Victor Co., an electronics firm.
   The Carnegie Hall concert showed why Joe Williams has endured.
His voice ranges from a whisper to a shout, as comfortable with
gospel and ballad standards as with the lowdown blues.
   The first half of the concert, Williams and his trio, led by
pianist Norman Simmons, explored the singer's range. Ballads
alternated with some shouters' favorites; ``Embraceable You,'' for
example, followed by ``All Right, OK, You Win.''
   Several duets with Marlena Shaw ended the all-Williams part of
the evening.
   After the intermission, the 16-piece Basie band, spurred on at
times by dervish-like drummer Duffy Jackson, drove up the tempo. The
orchestra performed a memorable ``Count Basie Remembrance Suite'' in
honor of its jaunty founder. Carmen Bradford, the band's vocalist,
sang a powerful and exciting ``Young and Foolish.''
   Then came the highlight the audience had been waiting for.
Williams came back on stage and shouted several blues songs, his
voice welling up to match the power of the Basie bunch.
   Happy birthday, Joe Williams, and many more.

<NOTE>Jazz Stars Salute the Late Benny Goodman</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   More than a half-century after he joined the
Benny Goodman band, 80-year-old Lionel Hampton displayed the verve
of youth as he joined guitarist George Benson and the Loren
Schoenberg big band for a tribute to the late bandleader.
   Several other Goodman alumni, including pianist Dick Hyman,
trumpeter Joe Newman, and saxophone player Toots Mondello were on
hand Saturday night at Carnegie Hall for the affectionate salute to
Goodman, who died in 1987.
   With the effervescent Hampton leading the way, and clarinetists
Ken Teplowski and Kenny Davern alternating on Goodman's parts, the
band swung through a repetoire of tunes Goodman helped make great,
including ``Don't Be That Way,'' ``Soft Winds,'' ``Stompin' at the
Savoy'' and ``Body and Soul.''
   Benson added an updated interpretation of guitarist Charlie
Christian's role in the band, and rising stars Terence Blanchard on
trumpet and Ralph Moore on tenor sax gave a new wave spin to the
standards.
   The evening closed with Hampton switching from vibes to drums for
a hard-charging version of ``Sing, Sing, Sing,'' which brought a
cheering audience to its feet.

   Ella was hot. She repeatedly dabbed her brow with
a white hanky and complained about exactly how hot she was. Then she
went on to cook for nearly two hours.
   The sold-out crowd at Carnegie Hall was on its feet before the
first note came out of Ella Fitzgerald's mouth Sunday night at the
JVC Jazz Festival.
   At 71, Miss Fitzgerald's voice is still as smooth and sweet as
caramel sauce. And she dished it out with tributes to George
Gershwin, Burt Bacharach, Billie Holiday and finally, to ``my loyal
fans,'' with Stevie Wonder's ``You Are the Sunshine of My Life.''
   Miss Fitzgerald was backed by her trio of Keter Betts on bass,
Bobby Durham on drums and Mike Wofford on piano. She was at her best
in her second set when joined by guitarist Joe Pass. She hit the
high note of the evening in a scat duet with Pass on ``One Note
Samba.''
   The song stylist spent much of her time on stage performing on a
stool _ doctor's orders, she said _ and her infrequent steps seemed
unsteady. She made up a few lyrics and once interrupted a Pass solo.
   But for this audience, the elegant Ella could do no wrong.

   A federal jury today convicted five men of
forming a Mafia faction that shot to death a mob-linked businessman
in a restaurant and plotted to kill John Gotti, reputed boss of a
rival crime family.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. called the defendants ``among
the most powerful organized crime figures in the state'' and said
the verdict was a ``tremendous blow to organized crime in New
Jersey.''
   The five could receive at least 50 years in prison at sentencing
Aug. 3.
   Louis A. ``Bobby'' Manna, a reputed consigliere, or No. 3 leader,
of the Genovese crime family, was convicted of conspiracy,
racketeering, planning to kill Gotti and arranging the murder of
businessman Irwin Schiff.
   Gotti, reputed boss of the Gambino family, was a target because
of a turf battle, authorities said. The FBI tipped Gotti to the
plot, which was not carried out.
   The 350-pound, free-spending Schiff was shot to death in 1987
over dessert at a restaurant on New York City's Upper East Side.
   His dinner companion, identified in news reports then only as a
``mysterious blonde'' who fled the scene, was revealed in court as
Judy Galip. She testified that a masked man fired two shots into
Schiff's head.
   Prosecutors said Schiff may have threatened to expose Genovese
activity or could no longer be trusted with a $25 million to $40
million mob money-laundering operation.
   Also convicted were Martin A. ``Motts'' Casella, Richard
``Bocci'' DeSciscio, union official Rocco J. Napoli and former
Hoboken police Lt. Frank ``Dipsy'' Daniello.
   Daniello was convicted in the conspiracy to kill Gotti. The
government said DeSciscio was the lookout at the Schiff slaying.
Casella, who owned a restaurant allegedly used as the organization's
headquarters, was allegedly Manna's chief lieutenant and Napoli a
member of the criminal enterprise.
   Key evidence in the 3{-month trial was a series of conversations
secretly tape-recorded at Casella's restaurant and a coffee shop in
Jersey City.
   The defense attacked the tapes as inaudible and said the
government misinterpreted the conversations and misattributed
voices. They provided jurors with alternate transcripts and said any
talk of killing Gotti was a joke.

<TEXT>
   An ``underground railroad'' run by activists in
this British colony has helped two student leaders and two dissident
intellectuals escape a bloody crackdown in China, sources said
Monday.
   Students Wu'er Kaixi and Li Lu and intellectuals Wan Runnan and
Yan Jiaqi have escaped certain imprisonment and possible death and
are now in the West, sources said.
   They said Wu'er escaped with his girlfriend, Liu Yan, and Yan
Jiaqi fled with his wife, Gao Ao, and that at least a dozen other
participants in the movement for freedom also have been smuggled to
safety.
   The four men made it out of China despite the crackdown on
dissent and a nationwide manhunt during which their pictures were
posted in airports and train stations, and border security was
tightened.
   Three sources _ a diplomat who specializes in China, a Hong Kong
activist and a student _ spoke to The Associated Press on condition
of anonymity and refused to divulge details of the escapes, saying
they did not want to jeopardize efforts to smuggle more dissidents
from China.
   The crackdown began on June 3-4, when thousands of soldiers
gunned down hundreds of unarmed citizens in Beijing. Since then,
China has arrested 1,800 people involved in the freedom movement and
executed 27. Student leaders and dissidents have gone underground to
avoid detention.
   Wu'er, a freshman at Beijing Normal University, and Li, a junior
at Nanjing University, are on the wanted list of 21 students sought
by Communist authorities for leading the movement. Five on the list
have been arrested.
   A member of China's Turkish minority, Wu'er was famed for his
compelling speeches for democracy and a nationally televised
shouting match with Premier Li Peng.
   On Monday night, a statement said to have been written by Wu'er
while fleeing police was obtained by the AP.
   ``A black sun has appeared in the sky of my motherland and
republic,'' said the statement, which appeared to be written in
Wu'er's hand.
   ``Under this black sun, on a day in June that should have
belonged to a season of fresh flowers, my people, my countrymen, my
classmates and my beloved comrades-in-arms fell,'' it said, in a
reference to the June 4 killing of unarmed citizens by the Chinese
army in Beijing.
   ``But our life is young, stubborn and uncrushable. What's more in
my motherland ... these fresh flowers will one day open proudly
under a red sky.''
   ``Black sun, I'm going to shoot you down!''
   The diplomatic source said the intellectual dissidents Wan and
Yan were smuggled to the West through Hong Kong last week.
   The two are on a wanted list of seven intellectuals issued by
Chinese authorities as part of the crackdown. So far, two if the
seven apparently have been arrested.
   Yan has gone to France and Wan Runnan has left for the United
States, the activist source said, declining to provide further
details.
   Last week, dissident intellectual Su Shaozhi arrived in Chicago
after escaping China via Holland. He was not aided by activists in
Hong Kong.
   While in Beijing, Wan, general manager of China's first private
high-technology company, the Stone Corp., had called for a meeting
of the national congress to discuss student demands for a freer and
less-corrupt society.
   He also was at the forefront of a movement to reform China's
constitution.
   Yan was a leader of the Beijing Independent Intellectuals
Association, which played an important role in the movement and was
banned by the Chinese government when martial law was declared May
20.
   The activist released a statement by Yan, after he left Hong
Kong, in which he blasted China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping,
Premier Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun, who have masterminded
the crackdown.
   ``China's political situation today is in the midst of a white
terror,'' the statement said. The three leaders were ``using the
inhuman policies of fascism to take all of those who support
democracy, the real Chinese people, and wipe out the whole lot,'' it
said.
   These policies ``have not only intensified the people's desire
for revenge and planted the seeds of democracy and freedom in the
hearts of more and more people, they also have hastened their
demise,'' he said
   The activist said more than a dozen people have been smuggled out
of China since the crackdown began. Most were from Beijing, but
several student leaders from Shanghai also have escaped.

<HEAD>Binder Twins Far From Normal Two Years After Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly two years after surgeons separated a pair
of West German Siamese twins connected at the head, the children
remain far from normal, doctors say.
   Patrick Binder remains in ``a vegetative state,'' said David
Nichols, a Johns Hopkins Children's Center pediatric
anesthesiologist who participated in the surgery and now directs the
hospital's pediatric intensive care unit.
   Patrick's brother, Benjamin, is improving, but is ``clearly not
normal and developmentally delayed,'' the doctor was quoted as
saying in Monday's editions of The (Baltimore) Sun.
   The 22-hour surgery to separate the then 7-month-old twins
finished Sept. 6, 1987. Hospital officials originally predicted a
six-week recovery period, but the twins remained at Hopkins for more
than seven months. When they returned to their home in Ulm, West
Germany, in April 1988, Patrick was hospitalized again.
   ``In a technological `star wars' sort of way, the operation was a
fantastic success,'' said Benjamin Carson, the pediatric
neurosurgeon who helped direct the surgical team. ``But as far as
having normal children, I don't think it was all that successful.''
   The parents, Theresia and Josef Binder, signed a contract with
the West German magazine Bunte, giving the magazine exclusive rights
to the story until the boys reach age 18. Because of that the
Binders have refused to talk to the press.
   But in an article in April in Freizeit Revue, a West German
magazine published by the same company that publishes Bunte, Mrs.
Binder was critical of Hopkins and the care her sons received later
in West Germany.
   The doctors in Baltimore told her her children would ``run and
laugh'' within a year after their discharge from Hopkins, she told
the magazine. ``I took it seriously,'' she said. ``But maybe they
just wanted to encourage me.''
   Nichols denied Hopkins doctors made that claim.
   ``The Binders were told that Patrick showed signs of severe
neurological damage and that his recovery potential was uncertain,''
he said. ``Also, there was a question of blindness and hearing
deficit. And they were told that Benjamin's development would be
delayed and his ultimate chances of recovery were uncertain.''

   An 11-year-old Californian flew his single-engine
plane into Moscow on Monday after collecting signatures of nearly
1,000 Soviet children to present to President Bush.
   ``It wasn't a difficult flight. It's just like flying anywhere,''
Tony Aliengena said as he made the second Soviet stop in his attempt
to become the youngest person to pilot a plane around the globe.
   He landed his blue and white Cessna 210 at Sheremetevo airport
after a two-hour flight from Leningrad, where he collected 987
signatures for Bush's scroll.
   In Moscow, the fourth-grader was welcomed by Young Pioneers,
members of a Communist youth group who offered the traditional
Russian bread and salt.
   After the youngster taxied to the terminal, he was surrounded by
the youths, journalists and about 10 curious Aeroflot pilots.
   The young pilot, who has logged about 1,000 hours of flying time,
will spend five days in Moscow. Among his stops will be Red Square,
where West German teen-ager Mathias Rust gained worldwide fame by
landing a single-engine Cessna in May 1987 after evading Soviet air
defenses. Rust was convicted of illegally entering the Soviet Union
and other crimes and released after spending nearly a year of a
four-year prison sentence.
   The young American brought a friendship scroll signed by 250,000
American children to present to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but
it is not certain the Soviet leader will have time to meet him
before he takes off Friday on a hopscotch journey across the Soviet

   When he pulled into the row of little orange balls,
bus driver Donald Desmond closed his eyes and let the gods be his
guide.
   The rear tires of his yellow and white Massachusetts Bay Transit
Authority bus came within 1{ inches of the markers on either side.
But the 16-year veteran of Boston's snarled traffic and snarling
commuters kept his coach in the clear Sunday to win the ``Bus
Driver's Rodeo'' and claim the title of top jockey among the city's
2,200 bus drivers.
   His next stop: the national championships in Atlanta in September
where drivers from 65 cities in the United States and Canada are
expected to compete.
   ``My tongue is down in my gut somewhere,'' he said after taking
the 40-foot bus through 11 obstacles in 5 minutes, 36 seconds. ``I
feel like I can barely breathe.''
   The finalists in the 13th annual Boston bus rodeo negotiated
hundreds of orange pylons, rubber balls and plastic barrels spread
across a parking lot the size of two football fields.
   Some of the obstacles mimic maneuvers the drivers have to make
every working day, like making tight right-hand turns and squeezing
between parked cars to pick up passengers. Other tests, such as
backing up to a pylon or running the gauntlet of rubber balls,
require special practice.
   ``Whenever I see a can or a paper cup in the road, I try to hit
it with my right wheel,'' said Gus Swanson Jr., a 33-year veteran of
the transit authority. ``That way I get a feel for where my right
wheel is all the time, and when I go through the balls, I just
adjust by 3 inches, so I miss them instead of hit them.''
   The winner of the Boston rodeo gets a $200 gift certificate and a
reserved parking space at work.
   ``You can feel it click when you get a good run like that,''
Desmond said. ``When I go into the balls, though, I just close my
eyes and say, `God help me.'''

   A man whose hypnotized frogs lie on their
backs and lift tiny barbells might be called a ratbag in Australia.
In California, such eccentricity is nurtured.
   True eccentrics, have a sense of humor, intense curiosity, a high
sense of integrity and a desire to make the world better or at least
happier, said David Weeks of the Royal Hospital in Edinburgh,
Scotland.
   Weeks, who is doing a second book on eccentrics, has been
studying offbeat people for five years, and in an earlier book,
``Eccentrics: The Scientific Investigation,'' focused on Europeans.
About half his estimated 1,000 American subjects are from California.
   Weeks doesn't believe Californians are by nature flaky. But
California seems to take pride in its oddballs, he said in an
interview published Sunday.
   ``It's very tolerant and proud and nurturing of eccentricity,''
he said. ``In some parts of the world, by contrast, eccentricity is
denigrated. In Sydney, for example, they call them ratbags. Not in
California.''
   Among Weeks' subjects was Bill Steed, who lives in Emeryville
across the Bay Bridge from San Francisco and has toured the fair
circuit with 40 hypnotized frogs and many laughs.
   ``Are we a little kooky?'' asks Steed. ``Look at it this way. We
work when we want to work, we make a fairly decent living, we make
people happy and we're happy ourselves.''
   Diana Stoneberg is another Californian who became one of Weeks'
subjects.
   A former writer for Chicago's ``Bozo the Clown'' television show,
Stoneberg said being eccentric is ``quite complimentary.''
   ``I'd rather go down as an eccentric than as a routine, normal
person,'' she said.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Promises Reform After By-election Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno promised political
reforms Monday following a by-election loss by his Liberal
Democratic Party, which has been shaken by scandal after nearly 35
years in power.
   Uno also acknowledged that reports of his having kept a mistress
had caused problems for his personal leadership of the party and
government.
   On Sunday, Socialist Party candidate Kinuko Ofuchi won a seat in
Parliament's upper house in the by-election in Niigata, northern
Japan. A Socialist had held the seat, but the district traditionally
has been conservative.
   ``I never expected that we would lose so badly,'' Uno said Monday.
   Press reports suggested voters were influenced by allegations
that Uno paid a geisha to be his mistress for four months in 1985.
At a news conference Monday, the prime minister said: ``I'm not in a
position to comment.''
   He said a new 3 percent sales tax, the Recruit influence-buying
scandal and and farm issues were major factors in the loss at
Niigata.
   Uno has refused comment on the reports of a mistress, calling it
a private matter.
   ``I have respected political ethics for 30 years and I have not
done anything unethical,'' he said Monday, but added: ``I think it
is regrettable that I caused trouble'' through personal matters.
   A weekly magazine published the initial report about the geisha,
without naming her.
   After the polls closed Sunday night, former geisha Mitsuko
Nakanishi, 40, said in a national television interview she was the
woman. She said Uno paid more than 3 million yen (about $21,430) to
her and her geisha house so she would be his mistress.
   The case has tarnished the ``clean'' reputation that led to Uno's
selection as prime minister a month ago.
   His predecessor, Noboru Takeshita, resigned to take
responsibility for the Recruit scandal, in which the information and
publishing conglomerate is accused of trying to influence policy
through bribes and bargain-priced stock shares.
   Prosecutors have charged four aides to senior politicians and 13
businessmen, bureaucrats and legislators in the case.
   Sunday's election was watched as an advance indicator of voting
next month for half the seats in the upper house.
   Mrs. Ofuchi, the winner, campaigned against the sales tax, which
took effect April 1 along with income tax cuts; criticized Uno's
party because of the Recruit scandal, and apparently won favor with
rural voters oposed to opening Japan to foreign farm products.
   On Monday, Uno said the Liberal Democrats ``intend to listen
attentively to the people's voices'' and will try to restore public
confidence by making political reforms ``to prevent recurrences of
the same wrongdoings.''
   His party now holds now holds 143 of the 251 seats in the upper
house.
   A telephone survey of 10,000 people conducted June 16-19
indicated only 16.7 percent supported Uno's government, the Nihon
Keizai, Japan's leading financial newspaper, reported Monday.
   That was better than the 13.1 percent support rating for
Takeshita in March, but the paper said 52.8 percent of those
questioned opposed to Uno's government. The remaining 30.5 percent
expressed no opinion, it said.

<TEXT>
   Baseball's lawyers today asked an appeals court
to suspend a judge's postponement of Pete Rose's hearing before the
commissioner of baseball, saying the ruling ``threatens the very
reputation'' of the game.
   Common Pleas Judge Norbert A. Nadel on Sunday delayed for at
least two weeks a hearing today at which Commissioner A. Bartlett
Giamatti was to consider allegations Rose bet on ballgames. Nadel
agreed with Rose that Giamatti had already made up his mind against
the Cincinnati Reds manager and could not judge Rose fairly.
   In a request today for the suspension of Nadel's temporary
restraining order, baseball called the ruling unprecedented.
   ``If every action of the commissioner to investigate and
determine matters affecting the integrity of the game were to be
subject to court intervention and delay, the commissioner's ability
to safeguard the integrity of the game would be destroyed,'' the
request said.
   ``The action of the court below threatens the very reputation of
major league baseball and deprives the commissioner of the power to
protect the integrity of the game.''
   A three-judge state appeals court panel will decide baseball's
request after receiving a response from Rose's lawyers, which is due
Wednesday morning.
   Rose could be banned from baseball for life if Giamatti accepts
evidence from a baseball investigator that Rose bet on his own team.
   Robert Pitcairn Jr., a lawyer for Rose, was said to be in a
meeting this morning and was unavailable for comment.
   Nadel on Sunday said the outcome of the baseball commissioner's
hearing was a ``foregone conclusion.''
   ``I think we got justice,'' said Rose's attorney, Reuven Katz.
   ``I'm just pleased that we get the next opportunity,'' Rose said
after his team lost 7-0 to Los Angeles. ``Obviously we're pleased
about this. That's it. Next things next.''
   Nadel's ruling set a collision course with federal court
decisions that have upheld the commissioner's broad authority to act
when the integrity of the game is at stake. Baseball team owners
Charles O. Finley and Ted Turner lost challenges of the authority of
then-Commissioner Bowie Kuhn in the 1970s.
   ``The judge has made a mistake, a big one,'' baseball lawyer
Louis Hoynes Jr. said Sunday. ``It's an erroneous ruling. It's a
problem, a serious mistake.''
   Giamatti said he'll fight Nadel's decision ``tooth and nail.''
   ``I regret the judge's decision. I have absolutely no prejudgment
or prejudice regarding Pete Rose,'' Giamatti said.
   Nadel, who is up for re-election in 16 months, agreed with Rose's
lawyers that the commissioner had already made up his mind that Rose
is guilty of betting on baseball games.
   The judge referred to a letter at the heart of Rose's case _ a
recommendation sent by Giamatti to a federal judge as part of the
sentencing of bookmaker Ronald Peters.
   The letter praised Peters for being ``candid, forthright and
truthful'' with special baseball investigator John M. Dowd, who
found evidence that Rose bet on Reds games and other baseball games
in 1985, 1986 and 1987.
   Peters has told federal authorities who also are investigating
Rose that he accepted perhaps more than $1 million in bets on behalf
of the manager for two years.
   Nadel held the letter up in court Sunday as he announced his
decision.
   ``It therefore appears to this court at this point that the
commissioner of baseball has prejudged Peter Edward Rose,'' Nadel
said. ``We further find that the hearing set tomorrow in New York
before the commissioner of baseball would be futile and illusory and
the outcome a foregone conclusion.''
   Nadel ruled that baseball can't take any action against Rose for
the 14 days the temporary restraining order is in effect. He also
ruled that Rose can't be fired during that time.
   The judge set arguments for a preliminary injunction for July 6.
If granted, an injunction could indefinitely block the commissioner
from deciding Rose's fate while the court takes over the case.
   Rose has sought just that _ getting a judge in his hometown
rather than Giamatti to determine the charges.
   Nadel's ruling didn't touch on the question of whether Rose bet
on baseball. Rose has denied doing so, but Dowd testified before
Nadel last week that the manager admitted he had bet on other
professional sports.
   The Reds' manager was in his office behind a closed door while
the decision was broadcast on television. Although he had little to
say afterward, several fans displayed banners of celebration at
Riverfront Stadium and Reds reliever Rob Dibble expressed full
support.
   ``Bart Giamatti knows nothing about baseball,'' Dibble said.
``That's what happens when you give somebody power like that to use
against Pete Rose.''

   Students hurled hundreds of firebombs
at riot police Monday to demand freedom for a dissident clergyman
who went on trial for making a trip to North Korea.
   Also on Monday, prosecutors said they issued arrest warrants for
three radical student leaders accused of encouraging participation
in a July youth festival in North Korea, defying a government ban.
   They face charges of violating the National Security Law. The
Rev. Moon Ik-hwan, a 71-year-old Presbyterian minister, went on
trial Monday, accused of violating the law.
   Thirteen students were arrested for seizing the rooftop of a
six-story building near the Seoul courtroom. ``Immediately release
patriotic unification fighter Moon,'' read a large banner unfurled
from the roof.
   Moon went to Pyongyang in March, met with communist leader Kim Il
Sung and discussed reunifying the nations.
   About 1,500 police surrounded Seoul's District Criminal Court,
where Moon appeared in handcuffs and tied with rope. About 200
supporters staged a sit-in to get into the courtroom, and the judge
ordered some of 50 plainclothes police to give up their seats.
   At the capital's Sogang University, 500 students yelling
``Release Moon Ik-hwan!'' fought riot police with metal pipes, clubs
and firebombs. Police fought back with rocks and captured clubs.
   In provincial Kwangju city, 1,000 Chosun University students
clashed with riot police who blocked them from marching to the
prosecutor's office, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported.
   Students threw several hundred firebombs and rocks before they
were dispersed with tear gas, Yonhap said.
   Moon's nine-day visit violated a South Korean law forbidding
trips to North Korea without approval. Seoul says dialogue on
unification must go through government channels. Moon could face the
death penalty, although observers say there is little chance he
would be executed.
   Moon acknowledged the prosecutor's charge he visited North Korea,
and said, ``It is our disgrace that we have not erased the 38th
parallel,'' which divides the two nations. ``My visit was motivated
by the will to solve a national tragedy.''
   Moon and traveling companion Yoo Won-ho, a 59-year-old
businessman, were arrested April 13 when they returned to Seoul.
   Government officials say Moon's visit aided North Korean attempts
to cause unrest in South Korea and discredit the Seoul government.
Many South Koreans were shocked at television pictures showing Moon
hugging North Korean leaders.
   Defense lawyers argue the prosecution should drop charges because
the indictment was issued by the Joint Public Investigation Team, a
group now disbanded and therefore unconstitutional.

   Italy's ambassador to the United
States says Peter Secchia, newly confirmed U.S. ambassador to Italy,
will make a fine diplomat, despite his reputation for making crude
remarks.
   ``I don't think he needs any lessons,'' said Rinaldo Petrignani,
who spent last weekend visiting Secchia at the family's Lake
Michigan cottage in Ferrysburg.
   Secchia, whose nomination was confirmed by the U.S. Senate last
week following a monthlong delay, has been dubbed the ``ambassador
of dirty words'' by the Italian media. Petrignani brushed aside such
attention.
   ``It is clear that the president of the United States, by
choosing Mr. Secchia, chose a person he thought would be just right
as ambassador,'' Petrignani said. ``We are looking forward to having
Secchia in Rome.''
   Secchia, who will be sworn in Wednesday and fly to Rome on
Thursday, said he and Petrignani discussed the political and
economic climate in Italy and what Secchia should expect in his new
job.
   Secchia, a Grand Rapids businessman, is the grandson of Italian
immigrants.

   The foreman of the grand jury that investigated
Mary Jo Kopechne's death at Chappaquiddick in 1969 said he was
approached by two ``key lawmen'' who said an inquiry wasn't needed,
according to a published report.
   Newsweek reported in its July 3 issue that Leslie Leland, a
pharmacist on Martha's Vineyard, said that the two men took him for
a ride and told him their version of the night's events involving
Sen. Edward Kennedy.
   ``The bottom line was that this was nothing more than an accident
and a minor vehicle violation _ and there was no need for the grand
jury to get involved,'' Leland said.
   ``There was a cover-up. All they were concerned about was
protecting Teddy's political career. It was, like, the hell with the
fact that this young woman lost her life.''
   Miss Kopechne was killed when the car Kennedy was driving across
a bridge on the Massachusetts island skidded into 8 feet of water.
He surfaced moments later; Miss Kopechne died in the car.
   The Massachusetts Democrat failed to report the accident for 10
hours. He received a suspended sentence for leaving the scene of an
accident.
   Leland's dissatisfaction with the grand jury proceedings has been
mentioned before, most recently in the 1988 book ``Senatorial
Privilege: The Chappaquiddick Coverup'' by Paul Damore. In it,
Leland makes no mention of the ride but says he had a variety of
meetings with officials and felt pressured not to ask certain
questions.
   In response to the Newsweek article, Kennedy's office issued a
statement in which the senator again expressed remorse for the
accident and said he takes full responsibility for the tragedy.
   ``I have told everything I know about the accident. I only wish
that it were in my power to do something more to ease the continuing
pain that I feel and that Mr. and Mrs. Kopechne feel for Mary Jo's
loss,'' the statement said.
   Press secretary Paul Donovan said there would be no further
comment.
   Newsweek did not identify the lawmen or say when the meeting with
Leland occurred.
   In the months that followed, Leland received three anonymous
death threats and for a time was under 24-hour police protection,
the magazine reported. He nearly lost his pharmacy license when
state officials did not send the usual renewal notice.
   Leland said that after he had convened the grand jury, a
prosecutor warned him to watch his step or the supervising judge
might cite him for contempt. The judge refused to let the grand jury
subpoena witnesses or to review the record of the coroner's inquest,
he said.
   The grand jury finally gave up and when its term ran out, the
members were sworn to secrecy for the rest of their lives, the
magazine said. Newsweek didn't explain why Leland decided to talk
about the case now.
   ``They tied us up,'' Leland said. ``They had us handcuffed. It
was devastating. There were two sets of rules: one for the wealthy
politician _ and the other for you and me.''

   The sidewalks are hot enough to grill shrimp
and one thing a tourist doesn't need in the nation's capital right
now is another line to stand in. But guess what they're doing in
front of the Supreme Court these days?
   Lining up for the abortion decision. Next to the weather, Webster
vs. Reproductive Health Services is the hottest thing in town.
   Word gets around fast: The decision might come down today, so
crowds were out in force hours before the court opened. The
justices, who know a show-stopper when they get one, teased the
appetite with a handful of important rulings, but they saved the big
one for Thursday, which is probably the last day of the term.
   One possibility that almost everyone discounted was that the
justices might schedule new arguments at the outset of the next
term, which begins the first Monday in October.
   Big events in Washington often tend to become chaotic, but not at
the Supreme Court, that temple of serenity.
   In one corner of the marble plaza in front of the court,
television cameras were set up under beach umbrellas, their
satellite trucks parked nearby. Microphones were ready for the
reporters inside who would rush out with the decision, interrupting
normal morning programming. The lines of tourists snaked down the
street.
   Experts were standing by. CNN had a Georgetown University law
professor, Tom Krattenmaker, at the ready to lend his analysis of
the abortion decision. When the court, instead, issued two decisions
about the death penalty, he wound up talking about that.
   Nearby, CBS also had a Georgetown law expert, Paul Rothstein.
   Demonstrators also were there, ready to spring into action with
their signs and chants.
   Inside the courtroom, packed to capacity with reporters, lawyers
and a few lucky tourists, the justice-authors of Monday's opinions
read from them.
   One floor below the court, at the press office, dozens of
reporters were crowded in a small room, waiting for the decisions to
be handed out. The court employees let the papers go to the waving
hands as soon as they received a telephone call from within the
court chamber that the decision had indeed been handed down.
   Tourists managed to get into that secluded part of the court
building, too, since the agony of news people in the throes of
reportage can make for an entertaining sight, too. But police kept
the sightseers at bay.
   The abortion ruling was not among Monday's output and word
flashed out, ``No Webster Today.''
   Demonstrators packed away their signs, TV crews took down their
cameras and tourists went whereever it is that tourists go. Showtime
was postponed until at least Thursday.
   By 10:25 a.m. the ``no Webster today'' call had been made and the
street theater in front of the court dissolved. A few tourists
stayed around to see the courtroom, now empty.
   It was 85 degrees and climbing on the plaza outside, but the
weather service said the humidity made it feel like 95.

<HEAD>College Chapel Sprayed with Poison; Official Blames Right-Wingers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suspected poison was sprayed
in a college chapel hours before a West German official met there
Monday with anti-apartheid leaders. A college official blamed
right-wingers for the incident.
   About 25 staff members at St. Barbabas College were treated for
nasal irritation and West German Labor Minister Norbert Bluem ``got
a good whiff'' of the foul-smelling substance, said Michael Corke,
headmaster at the school in the Johannesburg suburb of Bosmont.
   ``We suspect that right-wingers or other intolerant elements in
our society were responsible for this vandalism,'' said Corke.
``They are people who are anxious to disrupt the efforts of
responsible groups working for social justice.''
   Corke said there was an apparent connection between the spraying
of the weedkiller _ believed to contain cyanide _ and allegations by
the head of the South African Council of Churches of poisoning in an
earlier incident.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, the council's general secretary, recently
was hospitalized in the United States for the effects of poisoning,
which he said may have been applied to his luggage before he left
South Africa.
   The South African Press Association quoted a police spokesman,
Col. Frans Malherbe, as saying the incident was being investigated
as malicious damage to property, but if poison were found, it would
become an attempted murder investigation.
   Chikane returned to South Africa last week to preside over the
council's 21st national conference. The church leaders met Monday
morning with Bluem.
   Before Bluem's entourage arrived at the college, Corke said ``a
toxic and highly noxious liquid'' had been sprayed over the chapel.
Corke said an examination of the substance ``by the head of our
science school suggests that it is a cyanide-based insecticide or
weedkiller.''
   Corke said one element of the spray was ethnoic acid, which was
mostly vinegar, and another was possibly an insecticide.
   Corke said he believed the vandals had gained access to the
college chapel after 7:30 p.m. Sunday.
   At his meeting with the church leaders, Bluem criticized the
delay and ``suppression'' of court cases connected with the killings
of anti-apartheid activists, and assured his hosts that the Bonn
government would not make any new investments in South Africa.
   But he said he was opposed to mandatory international economic
sanctions, which church council leaders say would pressure the
government to end its apartheid laws.
   Under South Africa's system of racial segregation, its 5 million
whites control the economy and its 28 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs.

   Syria must withdraw its troops from
Lebanon, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger said Monday.
   ``The Syrians have to back off,'' Eagleburger said on
Christian-owned Voice of Lebanon radio.
   ``All of the outside parties ought to back off and let the
Lebanese make their own judgment about where their future lies.
There is too much foreign involvement on all sides,'' he said in an
interview recorded in Washington.
   His call for a Syrian withdrawal indicated an apparent U.S.
policy shift, but the State Department said it was not so.
   Eagleburger's comments appeared to reverse his March 16 statement
that Syrian troops restrain warring parties in Lebanon and that
their withdrawal would worsen the situation. He was speaking before
the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, eight days into the current
round of fighting.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
Monday: ``We have often called for the withdrawal of all foreign
forces in Lebanon.''
   ``The deputy secretary's remarks are entirely in keeping with
U.S. policy. We believe and have often said the Lebanese should be
free to pursue a political process free of threats and coercion,''
Boucher said.
   In Monday's broadcast, Eagleburger said Washington hopes
Lebanon's 14-year civil war can be resolved by an Arab League
committee comprising King Hassan II of Morocco, King Fahd of Saudi
Arabia and Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid. ``We're obviously
very hopeful that the Arab committee can, in fact, bring sense to
the situation, and can convince the Syrians to withdraw plus all
those other foreign parties that have gotten themselves involved in
the tragedy of Lebanon,'' Eagleburger said.
   An Arab League summit gave the special committee six months to
find a settlement in Lebanon.
   The three Arab leaders are to meet Tuesday in the Algerian town
of Oran.
   Their mission was decided by a summit of the 22-member
organization after Syria refused some members' calls for it to
withdraw from Lebanon, where it is the chief power broker. Lebanese
Christians backed by Iraq, Damascus' main Arab foe, charge Syrian
troops have violated a 1976 league peacekeeping mandate by siding
with Moslem militiamen in recent fighting.
   A month after the summit, the committee still has not been able
to enforce a cease-fire between Gen. Michel Aoun's mostly Christian
army of 20,000 and 40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon.
   The Syrians on Monday fired sporadic salvos of 130mm mortar
shells to maintain their blockade of Christian ports north of Beirut
and prevent Iraqi supplies reaching Aoun.
   Christian gunners retaliated with a barrage of 155mm howitzer
shells on the seaside boulevard of Moslem west Beirut, where several
Syrian batteries are deployed.
   No casualities were reported.
   By police count, 373 people have been killed and 1,460 wounded in
the 14 weeks of bloodshed.
   Also Monday, police said a bomb exploded at a school in the
Syrian-policed mountaintop town of Dhour Shweir, injuring the
principal, a teacher and seven children.
   Eagleburger's statement was broadcast a day after Secretary of
State James A. Baker III sent identical letters to Aoun and rival
Moslem leader Salim Hoss urging them to show restraint to avert
further bloodshed.
   The prestigious An-Nahar newspaper quoted unidentified political
and official sources as saying Syria is bent on overthrowing Aoun by
military, economic or political means.
   But the independent daily said the military option is out because
Syria has been notified that ``it was impermissible to invade
(Christian) east Beirut.'' It did not say who gave the order.
   Aoun has declared a ``war of liberation'' to free Lebanon of
Syrian domination.

   President Bush's spokesman accused the oil
industry Monday of moving too slowly on oil-spill cleanup technology
and said three weekend spills highlight ``the pervasiveness of the
problem.''
   But presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that Bush
would not take any direct steps to respond to the weekend spills in
Rhode Island, Delaware and Texas.
   ``The White House does not intend to assume an operational role
in oil spills,'' he said. ``We think the Coast Guard is fully able
and adequate to carry out these responsiblities.''
   Fitzwater also ruled out a moratorium on new oil drilling and
exploration.
   ``We have to go ahead with exploration and development of natural
resources. We have to have petroleum products for meeting our energy
needs,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said a ``commanding aspect'' of the latest spills was
to show `the pervasiveness of the problem.'' He said they
underscored the need for legislation to better define tanker owners'
liabilities.
   He cited legislation proposed by the administration on May 11 to
give tanker owners ``first level of responsibility'' for paying
cleanup costs.
   Under the administration bill, tanker owners would be
automatically liable for damages from $5 million to $78 million,
depending on the extent of the spill and the size of the ship.
   A federal fund would be set up to pay cleanup costs over the $78
million ceiling, to be financed by a fee of 1.3 cents on every
barrel of domestic as well as imported oil.
   Fitzwater said that the Coast Guard last year received reports of
7,500 oil spills, 200 of which required a federal takeover of
cleanup operations.
   ``We feel the industry could do more ... both individual
companies and the industry as a whole, particularly in the area of
research into better techniques for dealing with oil spills,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``Presumably we have had a lot of experience with oil spills. We
know that they are going to occur. We have in place systems to deal
with them. But we also know, from recent experience, that there are
problems that have to be corrected,'' he added.
   He said the ``most obvious'' shortcoming is the industry's
research and development into better ways to disperse oil spills.
   ``We also find that research has not produced dispersants the way
it should. That work is going forward. The sense of urgency I
believe is there in the Congress (and) in the administration. So
there's no need to delay development of energy resources, but there
is a need to move quickly and effectively on better techniques in
dealing with oil spills.''

<HEAD>Report Romania Pulling Down Fence With Hungary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania is pulling down a wire fence it
recently built on its border with Hungary, MTI state news agency
reported.
   There was no word from Romania on the fence, which was criticized
by the Soviet Union at a human rights conference last week in Paris.
   The barrier was erected along a 188-mile section of the Oroshaza
district in southeastern Hungary apparently to stop Romanians from
crossing into Hungary illegally.
   ``The `wire curtain' and the concrete pillars were almost
completely removed from Saturday to Monday,'' MTI said Monday.
   Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn, on a visit to Austria,
said Monday, ``I haven't heard it yet, but the news delights me.''
   Horn called for Romania to re-establish an autonomous region to
safeguard ethnic and cultural rights of the 1.7 million-member
Hungarian minority.
   ``The situation is gradually deteriorating, it is disastrous,''
he said at a lecture on Hungarian foreign policy. ``But we haven't
given up hope for changes.''
   MTI said the dismantling of the fence was announced by Col. Janos
Pal, commander of Hungarian frontier guards in Oroshaza.
   During the first five months of this year, 3,231 Romanians
crossed illegally into Hungary, Hungarian officials said.
   About 30,000 Romanians, most ethnic Hungarians, have fled to
Hungary in recent years seeking refuge from chronic hardships and
discrimination under President Nicolae Ceausescu.
   In a June 20 dispatch, MTI denied a Western report that Romania
was building a wall along the border, but said a wire fence 6{ feet
to 8\ feet high was being erected and has been completed along 90
percent of the border.
   A subsequent MTI report said Romanian authorities had piled sand
on roads leading to the border, apparently to block traffic, and
border guards had noticed a kind of steel ``car trap.''
   MTI said Romania started building the fence 1{ years ago, but the
pace of construction was speeded up in March.
   Romania came under bitter attack for flouting human rights of
dissidents and ethnic minorities, including Hungarian Magyars,
during the month-long Paris meeting.
   Even the Soviet Union criticized its ally.
   ``The Helsinki Final Act makes no mention of a barbed wall,''
said chief Soviet delegate Yuri Kashlev. ``If we were the Romanians,
we wouldn't have done it.''
   Relations between Hungary and Romania have deteriorated. As
communist officials in Budapest prepare to embrace mutliparty
democracy and free elections next year, Ceausescu's hard-line
government plans to raze thousands of villages, including hundreds
of ethnic Hungarian communities, to force assimilation.
   Recently, Romania has protested alleged anti-Romanian statements
made during the June 16 public funeral of Imre Nagy, the executed
leader of the 1956 uprising.

<HEAD>Eleven Americans Charged in China with Distributing Religious Literature</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of 11 Americans who went to China
despite a U.S. travel advisory have been charged by police in
Kunming with distributing religious literature and ordered to remain
in the city, a U.S. official said today.
   A U.S. diplomat was on his way from the American consulate in
Chengdu to look into the situation, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The 11 Americans went to China June 13, a week after the State
Department advised against traveling in the country, and had planned
to return home in early July.
   They were detained at the Yunnan University guest house and
charged with distributing religious material to the public, the
official said. Their passports were taken and they were forbidden to
leave the city.
   The official said the charge in Chinese law evidently was not a
serious offense. The names and hometowns of the 11 Americans were
not disclosed.
   In Beijing, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said two Americans _ a
teacher and a student at Nankai University in nearby Tianjin _ were
ordered to leave China by Friday.
   Teacher Mark Radicia and student Helen Qubain were being expelled
because ``evidently they were very involved in the student
movement,'' the spokesman said on condition of anonymity. The two,
whose ages and hometowns were not immediately known, had been
questioned several times by security forces, he said.

   Environmental experts said Monday most of
the estimated 420,000 gallons of oil spilled into the ocean no
longer threatened the shore, and federal officials began a criminal
investigation.
   Only a few small patches of oil could be seen in Rhode Island
Sound and along the state's shoreline, state and federal officials
said.
   ``The worst is over,'' said Debbie Payton, an oceanographer with
the Natonal Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. ``There's
not going to be any more shoreline impacts like there were at the
beginning. I'm confident of that.''
   She estimated no more than 5 percent of the highly toxic oil
spilled from the tanker World Prodigy remained floating on the
water. The tanker, loaded with nearly 8 million gallons, went
aground Friday on Brenton Reef at the mouth of Narragansett Bay. The
Coast Guard estimated 420,000 gallons spilled.
   There had been some reports of lobsters killed and several small
birds found dead, but officials said those did not appear to be
widespread.
   ``My feeling is that people in Rhode Island, scientists included,
are being maybe a bit upbeat,'' warned William Sargent, director of
the coastlines project at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in
Massachusetts.
   Agents from the FBI and three other state and federal agencies
met with Justice Department attorneys to begin their investigation
into the accident, said U.S. Attorney Lincoln Almond.
   ``The problem that we have is that some of the information the
Coast Guard has has been immunized and cannot be used by us,''
Almond said.
   The Coast Guard has been gathering material for a joint
investigation with the National Transportation Safety Board that
will open Tuesday in Providence, said Capt. Eric Williams of the
Coast Guard's marine safety office.
   Because some of that information must be provided by law to the
Coast Guard, it cannot be used in a criminal investigation, Almond
said. Among the statements in question was an admission by the
ship's Greek master that he mistakenly brought the 533-foot vessel
into the harbor without a pilot.
   Criminal charges could be filed for negligent operation of a
vessel or under the Clean Water or Refuse acts, Almond said. Each is
a misdemeanor with a maximum jail term of one year, but the Clean
Act violation could mean a fine of double the damages against the
ship's owner, Bollard Shipping of Athens, Greece, Almond said.
   State beaches from Jamestown almost to Connecticut remained
closed as a precaution, although eastern beaches were open. A
statewide shellfishing ban remained in effect.
   Conditions were ``much, much better than yesterday,'' said
Stephen G. Morin, state director of groundwater and wetlands, after
he and other officials flew over the area.
   ``I haven't seen it anywhere on the beaches we've flown today,''
he said.
   There was some problem with boaters, who ignored requests to stay
out of the area, dragging oil along in their wake, he said.
   Crews used booms and pads that can absorb up to 50 times their
weight in oil to soak up the remaining contamination, said Michael
Annarummo, deputy director of the state Department of Environmental
Management.
   He said officials had not decided how to dispose of the pads,
which must be handled as hazardous waste.
   Coast Guard Capt. Eric Williams said 72,500 barrels of oil were
left on the ship by mid-morning, of the 195,000 barrels it had been
carrying. He estimated the removal would take a day or two more and
said the ship would not be moved until it was empty.

   Here are thumbnail sketches of the two cases in which the Supreme
Court ruled Monday that states may impose the death penalty on
murderers who killed when they were 16 or 17.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Missouri: Heath Wilkins</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Heath Wilkins was 16 when he stabbed to death a convenience-store
clerk as she pleaded for her life. His attorneys described a
childhood of abuse, drugs and liquor. His first burglary was at age
7, and at 10 he bought rat poison, tried it on a dog, then put it
into Tylenol capsules for his mother and her boyfriend. She secretly
emptied the capsules, then made Wilkins swallow them.
   In July 1985, Wilkins plotted the robbery of Linda's Liquors and
Deli in Avondale. He told a girlfriend, another friend and Pat
``Bo'' Stevens about the plan; he and Stevens robbed the store while
the others waited nearby. Stevens grabbed Nancy Allen, 26, and
Wilkins stabbed her in the back and chest. As she pleaded for mercy,
he stabbed her in the throat. The robbery netted $450, cigarettes,
rolling papers, cheap wine and peppermint schnapps.
   Stevens pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced
to life in prison. The two other accomplices were convicted of
conspiracy to commit first-degree murder; one got probation and the
other was sentenced to 15 years.
   A state judge is to rule July 26 on Wilkins' request for a new
trial based on the argument he was not mentally competent at the
time of the crime.

<NOTE>Kentucky: Kevin Stanford</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Kevin Stanford plunged into crime at age 9. He was a drug addict
at 12, and was arrested for robbery, burglary, assault, attempted
rape and other crimes by 17. That's when he raped, robbed and
murdered a gas station attendant.
   Stanford came from Louisville's low-income West End, his
surroundings modest but hardly desperate. He apparently never knew
his father; his mother, a hospital therapist, worked long hours.
Until he was 6, he lived mostly with his near-invalid grandmother.
He quit school after ninth grade.
   On Jan. 7, 1981, Baerbel Poore, 20, was alone at a Cheker Oil
station next to Stanford's apartment, working nights to support an
infant daughter. Stanford and two other teens decided to rob the
station.
   Stanford and David Buchanan, 18, sexually abused and terrorized
Poore in the bathroom while 15-year-old Troy Johnson waited out in a
car. Stanford then forced Poore into her car and drove with her to a
woods, followed by the other two. Stanford gave her a last
cigarette, then shot her twice in the head. The take was 300 cartons
of cigarettes, $143.07, two gallons of gas and a gas can.
   Johnson's case remained in juvenile court and he testified
against Stanford and Buchanan, who were tried together in August
1982. Buchanan did not face the death penalty because he wasn't the
triggerman; he was sentenced to life.

   The Supreme Court ruled Monday that
skyrocketing punitive damage awards in personal-injury lawsuits
don't violate the Constitution's ban on excessive fines.
   But the 7-2 ruling left open the possibility that due-process
guarantees _ the Constitution's assurance of fair play for all _ may
be used to put a cap on the amount of money in such suits.
   Some justices practically invited a new appeal to resolve the
due-process issue.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, in a
concurring opinion, said the ruling ``leaves the door open for a
holding that the due process clause constrains the imposition of
punitive damages.''
   Some studies show punitive damages have soared in recent years.
One such study found that the average punitive damage award in
personal injury cases in Cook County, Ill., was $14,000 for a
five-year period ending in 1969 and $1.9 million for a comparable
period concluding in 1984.
   Industry spokesmen were disappointed with Monday's ruling, but
hopeful they could win in the future.
   ``We're happy to see at least four justices interested in the due
process challenge,'' said Quentin Riegel, a lawyer with the National
Association of Manufacturers. ``I expect a quick acceptance of a
case with that issue, perhaps later this week.''
   The court upheld a $6 million award a jury ordered a Houston
waste-collection company to pay a Vermont competitor for trying to
drive the New England company out of business.
   Writing for the court, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said the
Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibiting cruel and unusual
punishment and excessive fines doesn't apply to civil lawsuits
between private citizens or corporations.
   The ban is designed to protect people against excessive
punishment by the government, generally in criminal prosecutions, he
said.
   ``The fact that punitive damages are imposed through the aegis of
courts and serve to advance governmental interests is insufficient''
to apply the excessive fines clause to a private suit, Blackmun said.
   He relied in part on the U.S. Constitution and also on English
common law dating to the 13th century when, Blackmun said,
``awarding damages far in excess of actual compensation for
quantifiable injuries was well recognized.''
   Blackmun suggested the court might be willing to place a ceiling
on such awards if it could be shown that run-away juries violated
due-process standards.
   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and John Paul Stevens, in a
dissenting opinion, said punitive damages may violate the
Constitution's ban on excessive fines.
   Business leaders have clashed for years with lawyers and consumer
groups over the legitimacy of multimillion dollar awards in a wide
range of lawsuits.
   Those who oppose the big-money awards say they are catastrophic
for American competitiveness and development of new products,
particularly new forms of medical treatment.
   They say juries capriciously penalize the wealthy to benefit
those who have suffered injuries, particularly if the victim is from
nearby and the defendant is from another state or region.
   Consumer activists and trial lawyers say punitive damages are a
powerful deterrent to corporate greed that poses a threat to public
safety. They say smaller compensatory awards may be viewed by large
corporations as a cost of doing business.
   Some state legislatures, reacting to soaring insurance rates,
have imposed ceilings on how much money can be recovered in
personal-injury cases.
   Monday's case involved a $6 million punitive damage award against
Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., a waste-collection company based in
Houston with annual revenues exceeding $1.3 billion. The company was
ordered to pay the money to Kelco Disposal Inc. of Burlington, Vt.
   Joseph Kelley left Browning-Ferris to form Kelco in 1980 and soon
captured more than 40 percent of the market in the Burlington area.
   Browning-Ferris allegedly instructed its new Burlington manager
to ``put Kelley out of business. Do whatever it takes. Squish him
like a bug.''
   Browning-Ferris cut prices almost in half, but failed to drive
Kelley out. Browning-Ferris ultimately left the Vermont market.
   A Vermont jury awarded Kelco $51,146 in compensatory damages and
$6 million in punitive damages.

<HEAD>Aseptic Juice Boxes, Microwaving Among Group's Top Food Inventions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The half-pint juice box popular with children at
snacktime tops the list of the best food science inventions in the
last 50 years, says a food technology group.
   A panel on food safety and nutrition for the Chicago-based
Institute of Food Technologists ranked better ways of canning
vegetables second and the development of the microwave oven third.
The list was announced Sunday.
   The juice boxes are an example of ``aseptic'' packaging, in which
liquids are heated quickly to kill germs, then cooled and placed
into sterile, airtight containers. The juice or milk stays fresh
even if the boxes are not kept cold.
   Among the other top innovations in the technologists' list are
frozen concentrated citrus juices, freeze drying, frozen meals, food
fortification, and improved methods of sterilizing milk.
   The group developed the list in connection with its 50th
anniversary celebration this month.
   ``These innovations have helped to ensure healthier eating, while
also reducing food bills significantly,'' said Fergus M. Clydesdale,
chairman of the panel that compiled the list and head of the food
science department at the University of Massachusetts.
   Clydesdale said life expectanty has increased so much since the
last century partly because of the availability of more nutritious,
safer food.
   ``We don't get the kinds of infections from food we used to,'' he
said. ``That is because of the incredible sanitation that we didn't
have before.''
   While canning food has been done for centuries, it was included
on the list because of a relatively new process used to can
vegetables.
   ``In the past, food was placed in a can and heated,'' Clydesdale
said. ``Often the food would be overheated, not only killing
bacteria, but also knocking out nutrients.''

<HEAD>Bush Decries Violence Against Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday said ``archaic and
unacceptable'' attitudes toward women help breed violent crimes
against them and can rob them of full equality in American life.
   ``This war against women must stop,'' Bush declared in an address
to 2,000 people at a convention of the American Association of
University Women.
   He said women can be victims not only of husbands' abuse and
street violence, but also economic victims of ``a climate of fear''
that leaves them afraid to work late or walk to a library at night.
   He said it was ``unthinkable'' that his seven granddaughters
should not have the same opportunities in life as his four
grandsons. However, he added:
   ``No matter how equal the opportunities in our schools and
workplace, women will never have the same opportunities as men if a
climate of fear leaves them justifiably concerned at walking to the
campus library at night, or reluctant to work late hours for fear of
getting out of some parking lot safely.''
   He did not propose any specific new remedies to protect women,
but he said they would gain wider protection from the $1.2 billion
anti-crime package he sent Congress June 15.
   That initiative calls for building more federal prisons, hiring
more prosecutors and slapping tougher penalties on criminals who use
firearms.
   ``All too often, violent crime also means crime against women,''
said Bush. ``I am angered and disgusted by the crimes against
American women and by the archaic and unacceptable attitudes that
all too frequently contribute to those crimes.
   ``Whether it involves spouse abuse at home or violence in the
street, these are evil acts that transcend racial and class lines,''
said Bush.
   He cited no examples, but his words called to mind the recent
rape of a jogger by a teen gang in New York's Central Park as well
as the murder of several women by their estranged husbands _ one on
a furlough from an Indiana prison.
   Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said, ``The
president's passion for this comes from his experiences like his
discussions with (Drug Enforcement Administration) agents in New
York'' and his talks last Thursday with runaway kids at the Covenant
House shelter in New York.
   Bush told the women's group those youths had spoken to him about
drugs, prostitution ``and hopelessness.''
   ``It was tragic. And it brought home to me, loud and clear, how
much we have left to do in terms of offering hope, through
education, to the young people affected by this scourge of
narcotics,'' he said.
   ``Fundamentally, violence against women won't subside unless
public attitudes change. We must continue to educate police and
prosecutors, judges and juries, and we must engender a climate where
the message our children get, in television and films, from schools
and parents, is that violence against women is wrong.''
   Bush closed the speech quoting the 19th century Frenchman Alexis
de Tocqueville as saying the United States owed its singular
prosperity and growing strength ``to the superiority of their
women.''
   Asked if that referred to their intelligence or looks, Fitzwater
replied, ``We better not try and interpret de Tocqueville.''
   Bush received an honorary membership in the 140,000-member
organization.
   ``Technically that makes me the first AAUW member to be president
of the United States, but I know I won't be the last,'' he said.
   The AAUW, founded in 1881, promotes equal opportunity and
advancement for women and girls at all levels of education.

<HEAD>Growers Devoting 1.41 Million Acres to Four Major Crops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vegetable processors have contracted to a
sharply larger acreage this year to help make up for 1988
drought-shriveled production, an Agriculture Department report
showed Monday.
   Overall, growers will have 1.41 million acres devoted to four
major vegetable crops in 1989, a 14 percent increase from last year
and 15 percent more than in 1987.
   ``Planted acreage of snap beans is up 22 percent; sweet corn is
up 8 percent; green peas jumped 15 percent; while tomatoes increased
17 percent,'' the report said.
   Vegetables contracted for canning totaled 970,000 acres,
including tomatoes, a 13 percent increase. Freezers contracted
441,000 acres, up 17 percent.
   Reduced production last year because of drought helped boost
vegetable prices sharply, including further rises in the first
quarter of 1989, according to department economists. Consumer food
prices generally this year are expected to rise an average of 4
percent to 7 percent, compared with a rise in 1988 of 4.1 percent.
   The retail price of processed vegetables by themselves rose an
average of 4.8 percent in 1988, compared with a 2.8 percent increase
in 1987. This year, according to USDA economists, consumer prices of
processed vegetables are expected to be 8 percent to 10 percent
higher.

<HEAD>US Embassy Official Writes of Bolivians as ``Trolls''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The just-departed spokesman at the American
Embassy in Bolivia called Bolivians ``trolls ... short and dark and
strange'' in a fictional story, prompting a State Department review
of the piece Monday.
   Mark Jacobs, author of ``Stone Cowboy on the High Plains,''
published the story in the June editions of the The Atlantic
Monthly. The magazine described him as the information officer and
spokesman at the embassy in La Paz, Bolivia.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher was asked about the
story after the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a liberal think tank
that studies Latin American issues, drew attention to it in a
statement.
   Boucher said he was unaware of the article, but added: ``I can
assure you we'll go out and buy a copy of the Atlantic this
afternoon.''
   The hero of Jacobs' fictional story, Roger, is a character who
has spent time in a Bolivian jail and is eager to leave the country.
   Jacobs writes: ``(All Bolivians were trolls, Roger had decided a
long time ago. They were short and dark and strange, not like
people, really, but humanlike to a certain extent.)''
   At another point, Jacobs writes that only llamas, alpacas and
trolls could survive in the high altitudes of Bolivia. ``Real people
needed air with something in it their lungs could chew on,'' he
wrote.
   Later, he wrote: ``Something in the way the trolls said that word
was offensive, as if they were the human ones and Americans were
some low breed of dog.''
   Jacobs could not be reached for comment. Bruce Wharton, the press
attache in La Paz, said Jacobs left La Paz last Thursday on home
leave in Florida with relatives. Jacobs has been assigned to
Honduras, where he will assume his post at the embassy in August.
   Wharton said he knew that Jacobs enjoyed his tour in Bolivia and
had no intention of making disparaging remarks about the people. He
did not know whether Jacobs had submitted the story for any
pre-publication review by State Department officials.
   Larry Birns, head of the council, called the written
characterization of the Bolivians ``outrageous.'' He said Jacobs
should be recalled and reassigned to a country outside the
hemisphere for his ``racist and derogatory'' short story.
   Emily Eakin, assistant to the fiction editor at the Atlantic,
said the magazine had received at least two letters to the editor
criticizing the story for ``racial stereotypes.'' But others had
praised the piece, she said.

<HEAD>Bush Meets With Japanese Foreign Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush told the Japanese foreign
minister Monday that he will press China to ``keep reform moving
forward'' despite recent turmoil in the communist nation.
   Bush and Hiroshi Mitsuzuka also discussed trade friction at the
20-minute meeting in the Oval Office, but China was a chief topic,
presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement.
   ``The president said that we would continue trying to convince
the Chinese leadership that it is in their interest to keep reform
moving forward,'' Fitzwater said.
   Trade was discussed briefly, he said.
   The United States recently named Japan, India and Brazil as
unfair trading partners, for the first time utilizing a provision of
the omnibus trade bill.
   The provision requires the president to list trading partners
that are the biggest offenders of open-trade rules. Such a
designation begins an investigation that could lead to trade
sanctions against the offending nation.
   The action has drawn resentment from Japan.
   Bush indicated at Monday's meeting that ``trade would be a major
point of discussion in the upcoming economic summit in Paris,''
Fitzwater said.
   Mitsuzuka also invited Vice President Dan Quayle to visit Japan
in September.

<HEAD>Legislator Calls for Brezhnev Medal to be Withdrawn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A legislator Monday suggested withdrawing the
nation's highest military order from Leonid Brezhnev, the former
Soviet leader awarded the honor for his service in World War II,
Tass reported.
   Supreme Soviet deputy Albert Likhachev said many people see the
decoration as one of Brezhnev's undeserved rewards. Tass, however,
said the legislature was not empowered to revoke the award.
   Brezhnev rose to major general serving as a political officer in
the war and got the jewel-encrusted Order of Victory in 1978, 33
years after the war ended. He died in 1982.
   Stripping him of the honor would further discredit the man now
widely condemned for plunging the economy into crisis and stagnating
the rest of Soviet society. His name has been stripped off cities
and ships, and his relatives have lost some of the benefits given
family members of a Soviet leader.
   In recent years, Brezhnev has been satirized for all the medals
he received, many of which he awarded himself.
   Likhachev spoke when the Supreme Soviet, the nation's first
full-time lawmaking body, convened Monday to confirm Cabinet members
and organize writing bills and ratifying treaties, Tass said.
   These are new powers for the Supreme Soviet, a division of the
larger Congress of People's Deputies that began work May 25.
   In closed hearings, legislative committees rejected at least four
of more than 60 nominees for ministerial and other senior posts. The
fight now moves to the full 542-member body.
   Several deputies have objected to the large number of military
and defense industry representatives on a committee to oversee
defense and the dreaded KGB secret police. But they were told Monday
the experts deliberately were assigned to committees in their area
of professional expertise, Tass said.
   The government daily newspaper Izvestia reported the committee's
hearings will be held behind closed doors, despite calls for more
openness in those areas.
   The chamber approved the composition of its committees after
changes, Tass said without elaborating.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rob Lowe's lawyer told a judge Monday that the
mother of a teen-ager Lowe allegedly videotaped during a sexual
encounter has no grounds to sue because the girl is not living with
her mother.
   The attorney also argued that the mother has suffered no direct
harm from the tape, which has been copied and widely circulated, and
shown _ in edited form _ on television.
   The hearing before U.S. District Judge G. Ernest Tidwell was on a
motion by Lowe's attorneys to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Lena Arlene
Wilson, the Marietta woman who accused Lowe of seducing her
then-16-year-old daughter, Lena Jan Parsons, during the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta.
   The suit, which says Lowe inflicted emotional harm on the mother,
seeks unspecified damages.
   According to the lawsuit, Lowe made the sexually explicit tape in
his hotel room while visiting Atlanta for the political convention
last July. Henry said the ``totality of conduct by Mr. Lowe
constitutes seduction.''
   The videotape shows a man believed to be Lowe in a room with Miss
Parsons and another woman. It shows the teen-ager having sex with
the woman, with the man heard and seen giving directions, but it
does not show intercourse between the actor and Miss Parsons. A
different segment of the tape, apparently taken at a different time,
shows the man having sex with others.
   Tidwell heard 40 minutes of arguments Monday but did not indicate
when he would rule.
   Lowe, 25-year-old star of such films as ``St. Elmo's Fire'' and
``About Last Night,'' did not attend the hearing.
   Atlanta attorney Edgar Neely, representing Lowe, told the judge
that Georgia law, under which the suit was filed, says only a
custodial parent has the right to take legal action on a matter
concerning a child.
   Miss Parsons' parents have divorced in the past year and her
father was granted custody, Neely said.
   Mrs. Wilson has not suffered direct harm as a result of the
alleged encounter, Neely argued. ``Georgia has always been quite
definite ... there must be direct impact on the person who is
contending (harm),'' he said.
   Even if Lowe did make the tape involving Miss Parsons, it cannot
be shown that it directly had an impact on the mother, Neely said.
   ``The plaintiffs have gone to great lengths (to show) they're not
bringing this case on behalf of the young lady. They are bringing it
on behalf of the mother,'' he said.
   Mrs. Wilson's attorney, Hue Henry, said Miss Parsons was living
with her mother at the time the videotape was made. He said the tape
has caused direct harm by humiliating the family and straining the
parent-daughter relationship.
   ``This is a case of wanton, willful, intentional misconduct,''
Henry told the judge.

   The estimated 420,000 gallons of oil spilled from a tanker off
Newport on Friday had largely dispersed or evaporated by Monday
morning, officials said. The Greek tanker World Prodigy struck a
reef Friday at mouth of Narragansett Bay. The spill was initially
estimated at up to 1.6 million gallons. The light oil had spread
over an area of almost 30 square miles by late Sunday. An
undetermined number of oil-covered small lobsters and several birds
were found dead.

   Oil spilled Saturday when the Uruguayan tanker Presidente Rivera

it congealed into large globs in the cool water. An estimated
800,000 gallons of industrial heating oil was unaccounted for,
including an undetermined amount that became mixed with water and
remained in the vessel. Some oil fouled shores on both Delaware and
New Jersey sides of the river, plus some shores upstream in
Pennsylvania, but mostly the globs were too large to wash ashore.
Tanker was refloated Sunday and taken to a refinery dock to be
unloaded.

   A tug-driven barge ruptured when it collided Friday with a cargo

connects Galveston Bay and Houston. Spill of heavy crude oil
estimated at 250,000 gallons. Most of the oil that washed ashore
affected industrial property. Wind and waves concentrated most of
the oil in a small channel and a third or more of the 6,000 barrels
that leaked from the barge had been recovered by Monday.

<HEAD>City Pays $1.6 Million Extra After Insurer Sends Check Late</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LINCOLN PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taxpayers in this Detroit suburb will
pay an extra $1.6 million because the town's insurance company was
four days late mailing a check to survivors of a man killed in a
1982 police shooting.
   Circuit Judge Thomas Foley doubled the $1.6 million award to the
estate of Benjamin Davis, 36, for the shooting, which led to the
1985 manslaughter conviction of Officer Michael Killian.
   Police in nearby Southgate began chasing Davis after they saw him
apparently commit a traffic violation. Killian joined the chase as
it went through Lincoln Park, and shot Davis to death near Davis'
home in Detroit.
   Lincoln Park, a town of 45,000, and California-based Mission
National Insurance Co. agreed to a $1.6 million settlement in the
shooting.
   The insurer paid $500,000 on time in 1986 but was four days late
with the remaining $1.1 million, City Attorney Edward Zelenak said.
The company is now bankrupt.
   Mayor Robert Heyer said he had no explanation for the late
payment.
   ``I would have been willing to get on a plane and go get the
check if someone would have asked me to,'' said Heyer, who was
police chief at the time of the shooting. ``We thought everything
was taken care of.''
   After the state Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of
Foley's decision, Foley made the award final May 19. To pay the
award, taxpayers are being assessed about $50 each this year and
about $30 each next year.
   City officials would like to get the extra $1.6 million from the
insurers, but since the company is bankrupt they don't have high
hopes.
   ``The bottom line is, a deal is a deal,'' the mayor said. ``I
think the average citizen will realize this is one of the costs we
have to pay to provide law enforcement.''

<HEAD>Congressman Says No Evidence Of Wrongdoing in 2nd Death At Navy School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>APPLETON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The congressman who spurred an
investigation into the death of a recruit last year at a Navy
training school said Monday there's no sign that a second death
there stemmed from similar problems.
   After an extensive briefing by the chief of Navy training, Rep.
Toby Roth, R-Wis., said he saw no evidence of failed safety
procedures, instructor abuse or a lack of emergency services in the
death Friday at the Naval Training Center in Pensacola, Fla.
   A naval aviation officer candidate, Michael Fedie, 22, of
Altoona, died Friday in shallow water after a training exercise. A
preliminary autopsy showed abnormal brain swelling, and further
tests were under way.
   In March 1988, Airman Lee Mirecki, 19, of Appleton died during a
different type of exercise.
   ``It is really eerie that this should happen to another young
sailor from Wisconsin at the very same training facility,'' said
Roth.
   Roth had ordered a congressional investigation into the death of
Mirecki, a constituent, after the young man's family raised
questions about the Navy's explanation for the death.
   In the Mirecki case, the General Accounting Office, Congress'
investigative arm, found failures in safety procedures, abuse of
trainees by instructors and a lack of emergency services.
   The probe led to reforms at the school and disciplinary action
against a number of instructors and school administrators.
   A pathologist concluded that Mirecki had an abnormal fear of
being pulled under water and died of heart failure and drowning when
he was forced under water during training.
   Though Fedie is not from Roth's district, Roth has looked into
his death also. He said he had an extensive discussion Monday with
Adm. John Disher, who is chief of Navy training worldwide.
   ``It's clear as a bell the Navy is handling this (death) in an
entirely different way,'' Roth said in an interview in Washington.
   He said Disher ``appears to be on top of the situation, whereas
last year we had a lot of stonewalling.''
   Roth said Fedie was wearing a uniform and normal gear when he
jumped from the 12-foot tower at the training pool for an
abandon-ship exercise. Fedie's father has described him as an
excellent swimmer.
   After Fedie collapsed in shallow water as he was leaving the
pool, safety officers pulled him immediately from the water and
began first aid. An ambulance arrived within four minutes, Roth
said, and a doctor arrived shortly thereafter in a backup ambulance.
   A preliminary autopsy Saturday indicated Fedie died from acute
cerebral edema caused by an abnormal accumulation of fluid, said Kay
Esty, a spokeswoman for the Naval Education and Training Command.
   The Navy has temporarily suspended the abandon-ship exercise
Fedie had just completed when he collapsed and died, Roth said.

   Anton Dermota, a celebrated tenor who sang
the operas of Mozart and other composers on the world's best stages,
has died of heart failure, the Vienna State Opera reported. He was
79.
   Dermota, who died Thursday, was born in the Yugoslav republic of
Slovenia and moved to Vienna as a young man. He lived there until
his death.
   Dermota sang in some of the Vienna State Opera's most noted
productions.
   He sang Jacquino in the 1945 premiere of Beethoven's opera
``Fidelio'' while the opera house was still in ruins after heavy
Allied bombing in the last days of World War II.
   Dermota sang the title role in the same opera when the Vienna
State Opera was reopened in November 1955, just six months after
Austria gained postwar independence.
   In a register of names kept at the opera that spans the 1945-80
period, Dermota is mentioned as having sung 50 different opera roles
in works by Verdi, Mozart, Wagner, Richard Strauss and Gottfried von
Einem.
   Dermota's prominence in Vienna and at the Salzburg Festival made
him a much sought-after guest performer on operatic stages around
the world.

<HEAD>Hurt Ordered Employee to Shred Records and Had House Checked for
Bugs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Hurt ordered his housekeeper to shred
financial records when the actor learned his former lover was suing
him, the ex-employee testified Monday.
   Former housekeeper Dianna Schiebel's testimony came on the fifth
day of a trial to determine whether Hurt, 39, had a common-law
marriage with Sandra Jennings, the 32-year-old mother of Hurt's son.
   Schiebel said Hurt told her in May 1988, ``Sandy is suing me for
divorce. We have to be very careful from now on in everything we say
and do because Sandy will be looking for information that could hurt
me.''
   ``He told me I had to take the financial records and quietly
destroy them,'' Schiebel said.
   Hurt, sitting at the defense table, lowered his head and ran his
fingers through his thinning blond hair. Jennings sat with her back
turned toward Hurt and stared at Schiebel.
   Jennings' lawyer, A. Richard Golub, asked whether the documents
had been destroyed. Schiebel that they had been shredded.
   ``Did Mr. Hurt own a shredder?''
   ``Yes,'' Schiebel answered just as Frances Jacobs, one of Hurt's
attorneys, objected. The objection was sustained.
   Schiebel said Hurt also worried about electronic eavesdropping.
``He started looking for a company to sweep the house for bugs,''
she said. ``He felt the house was bugged.''
   Jennings, a former dancer with the New York City Ballet, is suing
Hurt for divorce, claiming they have a common-law marriage.
   Jennings wants up to half of everything he's earned for the past
6{ years. Golub says Hurt, who starred in ``Kiss of the Spider
Woman,'' ``Gorky Park,'' ``Body Heat,'' and ``Accidental Tourist,''
is worth about $10 million.
   Jennings bases her common-law marriage claim on four weeks she
spent with Hurt in Beaufort, S.C., where he was filming ``The Big
Chill.'' She says the marriage began Dec. 9, 1982, when the actor
learned he was divorced from actress Mary Beth Hurt. He and Jennings
left the state Jan. 10, 1983.
   South Carolina permits common-law marriages. New York, where the
two lived together nearly all of the time they were together, does
not.
   Schiebel said she met Hurt in May 1987, when he hired her
housekeeping business, Kitchen Witch. She said he often called
Jennings and their son, Alexander Devon Hurt, now 6, ``my family.''
   Earlier Monday, attorney Scott Graber testified that Hurt and
Jennings came to his Beaufort office around Dec. 27, 1982, and
signed a document he considered a premarital agreement.
   Graber said the couple also signed an acknowledgement of
paternity, which he witnessed. He said he did not charge them a fee.
   Hurt has testified he did not recall ever signing a premarital
agreement with Jennings.
   Judge Jacqueline Silberman, who is hearing the non-jury case, has
said she will concern herself mainly with what happened in South
Carolina.

   The state Supreme Court on Monday rejected
actor Paul Newman's bid to appeal a judge's refusal to dismiss a
lawsuit brought by a man claiming he was promised a percentage of
the actor's food company.
   The lawsuit, filed by Westport delicatessen owner Julius Gold,
resulted in an 18-day trial that ended in mistrial after it was
determined that the jury received information not introduced as
evidence.
   The judge then refused Newman's request to dismiss the lawsuit.
Newman went to the Appellate Court, which ruled Newman could not
appeal because there had been no jury verdict.
   The actor's lawyers then went to the Supreme Court, which Monday
affirmed the Appellate Court ruling.
   The action could set the stage for a second trial, although
lawyers in the case could not be reached immediately by telephone
for comment.
   Gold claims he was promised an 8 percent share of Newman's Own.
Newman, who donates all proceeds from the company to charity, denies
making such a promise.
   The company distributes salad dressing, spaghetti sauce, lemonade
and popcorn.

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Activist Seeks More Sanctions Against South Africa</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Albertina Sisulu, the South African
anti-apartheid activist invited to visit by President Bush, said
Monday she favors additional international sanctions against her
country's white government.
   Mrs. Sisulu said she views the invitation by Bush as a
breakthrough that might portend a more active U.S. role in bringing
about negotiations between South Africa's black majority and its
government. He invited her last month after meeting with three other
anti-apartheid leaders visiting the United States.
   Mrs. Sisulu, 71, whose family has come to symbolize the fight
against racial segregation in South Africa, meets with Bush and
State Department officials later this week. This is the first time
she has been allowed to leave South Africa.
   Because she was invited by Bush, Mrs. Sisulu told reporters, she
did not encounter difficulties getting a passport. But the document
only allows her to travel to the United States and is only valid for
31 days, she added.
   Mrs. Sisulu, a nurse, is one of three joint presidents of the
United Democratic Front, treasurer of the Women's League of the
outlawed African National Congress and a founder of the Federation
of South African Women. Her husband, Walter Sisulu, has been serving
a life sentence since 1964 for being one of the founders of the ANC,
along with its jailed leader, Nelson Mandela.
   Two of Mrs. Sisulu's five children have fled into exile to avoid
imprisonment, and she served various jail terms and has been under
house arrest and other government restrictions for 18 years.
   Mrs. Sisulu declined to say what she would tell Bush, but said
that ``we would like the outside world to help us with comprehensive
and mandatory sanctions'' in order to pressure the government.
   President Reagan imposed limited economic sanctions against South
Africa in 1986 after his veto was overriden by Congress. Efforts by
liberal Democrats in Congress to broaden the sanctions have so far
failed.
   Bush, while reluctant to support additional sanctions, has
endorsed a more active U.S. role in bringing about negotiations to
end the apartheid system of segregation and grant political rights
to blacks.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is scheduled to meet next
month in Washington with F.W. de Klerk, who is expected to assume
his country's presidency later this year and will be the first South
African government leader on an official visit here in 30 years.
   Mrs. Sisulu said that despite his promise to enact political
reform and end the domination of 28 million blacks by 5 million
whites, ``we see no change with de Klerk.'' His predecessor,
President P.W. Botha, made similar promises and failed to fulfill
them, she added.
   De Klerk should legalize the ANC and return its leaders from
exile so he can negotiate with them, she said.
   Mrs. Sisulu praised former U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins, the
first American black to hold that job, saying he had helped obtain
the release of South African children from jail. ``We are sorry to
lose him,'' she said. Perkins returned here recently to head the
Foreign Service.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Carlos Menem, who
has translated the radical slogans of his Peronist campaign into
conservative proposals in the face of economic chaos, said Monday he
would fight for his program.
   He appealed to the Peronist Party for support, but said, ``I am
ready for an internal battle'' if necessary.
   ``My political life has not been a bed of roses,'' Menem, who is
to take office July 8, said in an interview with Radio Mitre. ``I've
had to take roads full of rubble and thorns, but when there is
firmness, capacity and a bit of audacity, things turn out well.''
   The 58-year-old provincial governor was elected May 14 with the
support of organized labor and the working poor. The Peronists and
their allies also won control of the legislature.
   Argentines expected a government that would spur employment,
continue the government's role in the economy and improve public
services without raising their cost.
   As a candidate, Menem promised huge pay increases and ``work,
work and more work.'' He criticized increases in utility rates,
hinted at suspending payments on the $60 billion foreign debt and
opposed efforts to sell inefficient state-owned companies to private
investors.
   As president-elect, he included three conservative non-Peronists
in his eight-member Cabinet and picked an economic team that
proposes large increases in utility rates, partial sale of the state
telephone and oil companies and a new currency.
   An austerity program being devised to combat triple-digit
inflation, recession and a chronic budget deficit will be
``extremely hard,'' he said last weekend.
   Menem was asked on Friday how Argentines could afford higher
gasoline prices.
   ``Normally, workers don't have their own cars,'' he replied.
``Those who have cars and can't afford gas will have to put them
away and buy a bicycle. ... In China and other parts of the world,
they ride bikes. It's good for your health.''
   Argentines were jolted by the statement. They consider car
ownership an achievable goal, if no longer a right, along with home
ownership and annual vacations.
   The Peronist Party and its backbone, the 4 million-member General
Labor Confederation, have accepted Menem's decisions so far, but
some party and union leaders are upset.
   Saul Ubaldini, the labor coalition's secretary-general, organized
13 general strikes against President Raul Alfonsin. Ubaldini
rejected Menem's offer of foreign diplomatic post, which was seen as
an attempt to get the labor leader out of the way.
   Menem made the offer public and further undercut Ubaldini by
rejecting his demand that Argentina halt payments on the foreign
debt.
   Other clashes are possible on the minimum wage, maintenance of
collective bargaining agreements and the right to strike.
   Jorge Triaca, Menem's designated labor minister, recently asked
Ubaldini for a pledge not to call a general strike for two years.
Ubaldini refused.
   When Alfonsin's government agreed last week to raise the monthly
minimum wage by 130 percent to 20,000 australs (about $44), Menem's
transition team expressed concern about where the money would come
from.
   Alfonsin's six-year term ends Dec. 10 under the constitution, but
he said two weeks ago he would step down early because he could not
stabilize the economy.
   Inflation was 78.5 percent in May and is almost certain to be
higher for June. Monthly interest rates surpassed 200 percent last
week.
   Construction in Buenos Aires has virtually halted. Auto,
electronics and other assembly lines have partially shut down.
Hospitals and pharmacies are short on medical supplies and La
Serenisima, one of the largest dairies, has filed for bankruptcy.
   No payments have been made on the foreign debt since last year,
and Argentina is about $4 billion in arrears. The Central Bank has
only about $140 million in foreign reserves, Menem said, and new
loans from abroad are unlikely.
   The budget deficit and unemployment are growing. Real wages have
shrunk by at least 30 percent so far this year.
   Menem describes the Argentina he will inherit as ``poisoned,
calamitous and chaotic,'' and says he has fashioned a government of
national unity to improve it.
   ``Those who criticized me most severely in the past now
understand that they were wrong,'' he said Monday.
   ``I hope my supporters who are now raising their voices finally
understand that Menem is not working'' just for the 6 million who
voted for him, ``but has to govern the 30 million'' citizens of
Argentina, he declared.

<HEAD>Military Tribunal Meets For Second Day In Drug Scandal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HAVANA, CUBA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decorated general charged with betraying
the ideals of the Cuban revolution by trafficking in cocaine, ivory
and diamonds appeared for a second day Monday before a military
honor tribunal.
   The court of 47 top-ranking officers was expected to conclude
Monday with a recommendation for a court-martial, Foreign Ministry
officials said on condition of anonymity.
   They said the court-martial of Division Gen. Arnalfo Ochoa might
begin as soon as Tuesday.
   The official Cuban news agency, Prensa Latina, said Ochoa
admitted he was guilty of the charges Sunday during the tribunal's
first session. In a statement, Ochoa said he ``accepted
responsibility'' for his actions, the agency said.
   Defense Minister Gen. Raul Castro, brother of President Fidel
Castro, told the tribunal Sunday that Ochoa's punishment should
``set an example.''
   Some Foreign Ministry officials interpreted this to mean Ochoa
might face a firing squad. But others speculated Ochoa might be
spared because of his decorated combat service, his long friendship
with Gen. Castro and his rank, one of the highest in the
Revolutionary Armed Forces.
   Ochoa is accused of being the ringleader of military and Interior
Ministry officials who collaborated with the Medellin cartel, the
world's largest cocaine-smuggling operation, based in Colombia. He
is also accused of smuggling ivory and diamonds.
   Gen. Castro accused Ochoa of trying to build his own power base,
a clique beholdened by lavish gifts. His comments were interpreted
to mean that Ochoa may have become a threat to the established order
run by the Castro brothers since the Marxist revolution in 1959.
   Gen. Castro said that after Ochoa returned from Angola last year,
he began spreading lavish gifts around ``in a delirous exercise of
self-complacency.''
   He said Ochoa was trying to create ``an image and ties of
personal gratitude with an absolute lack of principle and ethics.''
   The government has mounted an intensive public relations campaign
against Ochoa, describing his alleged corruption in extraordinary
detail in Granma, the official newspaper of the Cuban Communist
Party.
   Granma published the entire text of Gen. Castro's remarks to the
tribunal on its front page on Monday.
   Havana residents have mobbed news vendors since the scandal broke
on Thursday, buying up every available copy of Granma minutes after
it hits the streets.
   In a break from its usual reticence to report on internal
affairs, Prensa Latina has distributed extensive reports on the drug
scandal.
   Cuban televison showed film from the closed tribunal on Sunday
night, and government radio has run scores of interviews with
soldiers and officers who professed outrage at Ochoa for betraying
the high moral stands of the revolution and the armed forces.
   Ochoa was decorated for his service as a field commander in
Angola in 1987 and 1988 and is one of only five officers ever
awarded the Hero of the Republic of Cuba.
   Gen. Castro on Sunday told the tribunal that Ochoa's actions were
``a stab in the back to the fatherland.''

   The World Bank said Monday it is deferring
consideration of $780 million in loans to China which have been
stalled since troops cleared demonstrators for democracy from
Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
   The timing of future decisions will be reviewed in consultation
with Chinese authorities, the bank said.
   On June 8, four days after the Army attacked the square, Bank
President Barber Conable, an American, withheld the first of the
loans from consideration by the bank's Board of Executive Directors.
   The $780 million represents the sum of several loans since then
that were to have been considered by the directors this month.
   The directors represent the 151 countries that own the bank, the
major source of aid money to Third World countries. The 22 directors
include one Chinese and one American.
   Bank officials explained that Conable's action was intended to
leave time to determine whether disturbances would prevent carrying
out the terms of existing loans to China.
   The bank is supposed to take only economic considerations into
account in making its loans, and it is continuing to disburse funds
for loans to China that have already been approved.
   One June 20 President Bush said he would ask the bank to postpone
new loans.
   The bank had been scheduled to lend a total of $2 billion to $2.5
billion to China in the year that ends on Friday. The $780 million
was part of that total.

<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas killed 1,748 soldiers
and wounded 3,438 in five months, the government said Monday in its
first detailed casualty report on the war since the Soviet
withdrawal.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said 1,577
civilians were killed and 3,442 wounded during the period, Jan. 20
to June 21. He blamed the rebels for the civilian casulties.
   Afghan soldiers began taking over the fight against insurgents in
January, and the last of an estimated 115,000 Red Army soldiers left
Feb. 15, ending nine years of involvement in Afghaistan's civil war.
   In Islamabad, Pakistan, a rebel spokesman said Afghan rebels and
Soviet Embassy officials agreed at talks Monday that rebels held
prisoner in Kabul will be released in exchange for captured Soviet
soldiers.
   But an official release from the embassy said final approval must
come from the ruling Marxists in Kabul.
   The spokesman said on condition of anonymity that both sides will
exchange lists of prisoners at another round of talks to be held
within the next week. But he said the principle of a mass exchange,
demanded by insurgents at previous negotiation sessions, was
endorsed.
   The guerrillas say 40,000 rebels are missing in action. No number
was given for Soviet prisoners.
   Local authorities in Peshawar, Pakistan, meanwhile said one
person was killed Monday and three people were seriously hurt when a
medium-range Scud missile, presumably fired from Kabul, hit
Pakistani territory less than a mile from the border.
   More than 3 million Afghan war refugees live in Pakistan, most of
them in camps near the border.
   When Soviet military forces were in the country, Afghan soldiers
joined them in military operations but rarely acted alone. Moslem
insurgents began fighting after a coup in April 1978 and the Soviets
entered the war in December 1979.
   Amani said he did not have guerrilla casualties since Jan. 20,
but he said at least 12,000 had been killed in the battle for
Jalalabad alone. Guerrillas began attacking the city March 6.
   On Monday, Amani said the government had effective control of
Jalalabad, which 75 miles east of Kabul and 45 miles from the
border. Most of the guerrillas are based in Pakistan and receive
support from the United States.
   According to Amani, the guerrillas fired more than 337,000
rockets and artillery shells in Afghanistan during the period
covered by the report, including 136,140 at Jalalabad.
   Afghanistan refuses to reveal the size of the army, but diplomats
estimate it has about 80,000 men.
   Amani also reported that photojournalist Tony O'Brien of Santa
Fe, N.M., accused of entering the country illegally and held by
Afghan police, was in good health and saw American news magazines on
Monday for the first time in 19 days.
   He said that Edward Desmond, New Delhi bureau chief of Time Inc.,
brought magazines and novels for the 42-year-old free-lance
journalist, who was on assignment for Time Inc.
   Amani said Afghan troops captured O'Brien on June 8, not June 14
as reported earlier, in Wardak Province next to Kabul. He said
O'Brien was found in rebel company.
   Police have yet to charge O'Brien, nor have they allowed Desmond
or others to meet him.
   Afghan authorities say they are awaiting the arrival of a U.S.
diplomat from New Delhi in the case. They said he could not come to
Kabul on Monday because of air transportation difficulties.

   The same pumps used to evacuate oil from the
Exxon Valdez in Alaska were clearing out the World Prodigy off Rhode
Island Monday as the Coast Guard found itself dealing with four
major oil spills.
   Officials said a response system that is under review as a result
of the March 24 Alaskan spill appears to be working well in handling
smaller oil spills in Rhode Island, Delaware and Texas.
   No equipment or personnel had to be moved from Alaska for the
latest spills, said David Pascoe, chief of the Coast Guard's
environmental response branch. Exxon is paying thousands of workers
to clean up oil in the 10-million-gallon Alaskan spill.
   In each of the latest spills, local Coast Guard officials were
overseeing the cleanup, said Pascoe.
   But a strike force used in Alaska and based in Alabama was at
work with its pumping equipment in Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay
where the World Prodigy ran aground Friday and spilled 420,000
gallons of processed heating oil, Pascoe said. The high-velocity
pumps purged the Exxon Valdez of its remaining 40 million gallons of
oil a few days after it ran aground in Prince William Sound.
   The World Prodigy retained about 6 million gallons, which was
being pumped into barges.
   Delaware National Guardsmen and private contractor employees were
scooping up blobs of oil from an estimated 800,000-gallon spill from
a Uraguayan tanker Saturday in the Delaware River. But Coast Guard
officials said shoreline damage downriver in Delaware, Pennsylvania
nd New Jersey was almost nonexistent because the oil was thick and
was not washing up on the shore.
   In Texas, the Coast Guard was investigating a collision Friday
between the tanker Rachel-B and a barge owned by Coastal Towing Co.
of Houston. Most of the area affected by that spill was industrial.
   Pascoe said it was too early for the Alaskan spill to have much
impact on the way the Coast Guard or other agencies respond to
spills. But he noted that Congress is considering several measures
to deal with spills in the wake of the Alaskan disaster, and the oil
industry last week announced its own plans for a coordinated
response.
   Coast Guard units throughout the country also are conducting a
six-month review of their contingency plans for oil spills. The
review is to be completed in the fall.
   Pascoe said the fact the reviews are under way may have
heightened the response of officials to the latest spills, but he
said there have been no policy or operational changes since the
Alaskan spill.

<TEXT>
   More than 40 years after being found in the
Qumran caves, many of the Dead Sea Scrolls remain a mystery, largely
because the few scholars with exclusive access have failed to make
their findings public.
   Other scholars are clamoring to have a look, and Israeli
authorities have laid down a deadline of 1996 to see all the
documents in print.
   ``It's true that scholars have been dragging their feet for the
past 40 years. It's an absolute scandal,'' said Magen Broshi,
curator of the Shrine of the Book where about eight of the 800
scrolls are on permanent display.
   The bimonthly Biblical Archaeology Review, published in
Washington, has carried two articles questioning the delays and
saying scholars were unfairly blocked from access to both the
original manuscripts and photographs.
   Editor Hershel Shanks wrote that the team of scholars originally
given exclusive rights to research by King Hussein of Jordan and
later by the government of Israel ``has now become more an obstacle
to publication than a source of information.''
   Shanks called for opening the materials to research by ``any
scholar who so wishes.''
   One angry scholar is Robert Eisenman, professor of religion at
California State University in Long Beach. He said he was denied
permission to conduct carbon-14 dating tests on the scrolls and was
barred from looking for a Bible passage in Isaiah that he needed to
support a theory.
   ``Manuscripts of crucial importance are jealously guarded by
small group of scholars,'' Eisenman said in a telephone interview.
``We have research to do ... and we are tried of waiting and want to
know what's in the scrolls in our lifetime.''
   John Strugnell, a professor at Havard University's Divinity
School and the new editor-in-chief of the scroll project that
involves about 20 scholars, said he tries to accommodate as many
outside requests as possible.
   ``My general inclination is to facilitate requests. But my
problem is to get the scrolls published, not satisfy the vanities of
particular scholars,'' said Strugnell, who is based in a chamber in
a church at the French-run Ecole Biblique in Jerusalem.
   Strugnell, who predicted the scroll project would be completed by
the end of the century, noted a series of Greek papyri found in
Egypt 100 years ago was still not fully published.
   He demonstrated the difficulty of the work by displaying a
photograph of a still-undeciphered manuscript in which tiny
fragments of Hebrew letters dotted the plate.
   ``Maybe the one big mistake was deciding in the beginning to
publish every detail,'' he said.
   Shanks said the 1996 target date set by Israel's Department of
Antiquities was a ``hoax and a fraud'' because it did not say what
would happen if scholars failed to meet deadlines.
   But Amir Drori, the antiquities chief and a former army general,
said he set up a program to require annual progress reports and got
the scholars to agree on publishing all their finds in seven years.
   He said fewer than half of the scrolls had been published.
   To speed the process, Drori said, scholars had been urged to
share the workload with students and other researchers, and a
special study program has been set up by Hebrew University for
leading Bible scholars next fall. A $350,000 grant from an offshoot
of the Wolfson foundation has also been obtained.
   ``For the first time, we have a plan, and if someone does not
complete his work on time we have the right to deliver the scrolls
to someone else,'' said Drori, the former commander of troops in
Lebanon during Israel's 1982-85 invasion.
   Drori defended the decision to close the doors to some scholars,
saying free access was unfair to those ``who have devoted their
life'' to the research.
   Drori was interviewed at his office in the Rockefeller Museum,
where the leather parchment manuscripts are kept in air-conditioned
aluminum boxes in the cellar.
   The review said some scroll fragments ``are deteriorating so
rapidly that if the outside world cannot see them soon, it may never
be able to see them.''
   Broshi, who oversees conservation, dismissed the allegation as
``absolute rubbish,'' adding that only about 1 percent of the
manuscript collection had deteriorated beyond repair. Other scholars
with access to the scrolls put the figure as high as 5 percent but
said the care is good.
   Discovered by Bedouin nomads in the caves overlooking the Dead
Sea in 1947, excavations uncoverd the documents from 11 caves in a
10-year span.
   The scrolls include some of the earliest copies of the books of
the Bible as well as poetry and legal texts. Scholars say they
provide an insight into the life of the ancient Essene sect of Jews
as well as the roots of Christianity.
   ``The Dead Sea scrolls provide a missing link between Christian
and Judaism. They help us understand how Jesus arrived at some of
the teachings he preached. Certainly there is a similarity between
his teachings and this sect,'' said Rudolph Cohen, deputy director
of the Rockefeller Museum.

   Opponents called Monday's Supreme Court
decisions upholding the death penalty for retarded killers and some
teen-age murderers appalling and tragic, but law enforcement
officials hailed the rulings as a victory in the fight against
violent crime.
   ``It is quite appalling that the Supreme Court would read the
Constitution ... as not banning the execution of children,'' said
Henry Schwarzschild of the American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``To let society hang children is medieval and barbaric.''
   However, Kentucky Attorney General Fred Cowan said he found the
decisions on juvenile killers gratifying.
   ``In an era of growing concern over the increase and seriousness
of violent crime, the court's decision ... reaffirms that state
legislators, the juvenile justice system and local juries _ not the
federal courts _ can and should decide upon the proper age to impose
the death penalty,'' Cowan said.
   ``Clearly, some 16- and 17-year-olds in our society are fully
mature and capable of plotting and carrying out the most heinous of
crimes,'' he said. ``The court has obviously responded to society's
demand to hold youths who are mature enough to commit horrible
crimes responsible for their actions.''
   The court said the Constitution's ban on ``cruel and unusual
punishment'' does not prohibit the death penalty for murderers as
young as 16, or for retarded adults with the reasoning capacity of
young children.
   The court upheld the death sentences of a Kentucky murderer who
was 17 when he killed and a Missouri killer who was 16, as well as a
Texas killer who has the mental capacity of a 7-year-old.
   ``It now falls to state legislatures to assure that no individual
with this disability is ever put to death in this country,'' said
James Ellis, president of the American Association on Mental
Retardation. ``The execution of any such person would represent a
tragic injustice.''
   Schwarzschild said ``the execution of people who are not fully
responsible for their acts is an atrocity.''
   American Bar Association President Robert Raven said his
organization was gravely concerned about the court's decision on
juvenile killers.
   ``To give up, with ultimate finality, upon a person even before
they emerge from childhood ... is squarely in opposition to the
fundamental premises of an enlightened juvenile justice system,''
Raven said.
   But Missouri Attorney General William Webster, whose office
successfully argued in favor of letting states impose the death
penalty on murderers who committed their crimes while 16 or 17, took
issue with such concerns.
   ``I think that's hogwash,'' Webster said. ``There's a lot of
people that say it's going to open the door. That's ludicrous.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush told five dozen ex-Democrats at
a party Monday for new Republican officials that ``the switch is
on'' to the GOP while the Democratic Party is moving ``to the left
and out of the mainstream.''
   The officials got handshakes from Bush, duly recorded by a White
House photographer, as part of a celebration that Lee Atwater, the
GOP chairman, called his ``proudest single moment'' in office.
   Bush looked at the state legislators, aldermen, judges, sheriffs
and other officeholders who had crossed political lines and
pronounced himself well pleased.
   ``The switch is on to the party in sync with the American
principles,'' said Bush. ``The switch is on to the Republican
Party.''
   On this sweltering afternoon, Bush was having none of the
bipartisanship, the ``extended hand,'' that he so often stresses in
dealings with the Democratic-controlled Congress.
   It was back to the hard-hitting, anti-liberalism he successfully
hammered Democratic presidential nominee Michael S. Dukakis with in
last year's campaign.
   ``People say the Republican Party is on the move. ... That's
true. We're moving in the right direction. But the Democratic Party
is on the move, too, to the left and out of the mainstream,'' Bush
said.
   He quoted ``the greatest former Democrat of them all,'' Ronald
Reagan, who has said that ``I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The
Democratic Party left me.''
   Rep. Bill Grant of Florida, the congressman who announced his
switch to the GOP at the White House in February, told the others:
``You didn't come here because it was an easy road. I know you went
through period of great self-doubt, ambivalence even before you
changed your party registration.''
   ``You're tough,'' he said. ``You're being accused of being a
traitor, turncoat, accused of betraying the voters by leaving the
Democratic Party,'' he added.
   Atwater said that ``this is a great day for our party. We've had
118 elected officials and party officials switch from the Democratic
Party to our party since my chairmanship began,'' while ``I know of
no single example of a Republican Party official or elected official
who has switched the other way.''
   All but a handful of the switchers were from the South, and most
made their move this spring.
   Charles Evers, outgoing longtime mayor of Fayette, Miss., and
brother of civil rights martyr Medgar Evers, said he switched
because ``I don't like to be with losers. The Democratic Party is a
loser'' and it ``took us for granted.''

<HEAD>Savimbi Says Cease-Fire Holding</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JAMBA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UNITA rebel leader Jonas Savimbi appeared
before thousands of cheering supporters Monday and said the
cease-fire is holding in the civil war and that more peace talks are
planned this week.
   Savimbi said at his bush headquarters in southeastern Angola that
he believes a national unity government can be established by the
end of the year, although he set no firm date.
   ``I am confident the negotiations will bear fruit,'' he said of
talks planned this week in Kinshasa, Zaire, between the
Western-backed UNITA guerrilla movement and the Marxist government
of Angola.
   ``The Angolan people want peace ... and the UNITA delegation is
prepared to be flexible,'' he said.
   Savimbi denied reports that he consented to go into foreign
exile. He said he will remain in his homeland as leader of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, known by its
Portuguese acronym, UNITA.
   ``A person goes into exile after he's been defeated,'' he said.
``I plan to stay right here.''
    Thousands of rebel soldiers and civilian supporters sang, danced
and waved red-and-green paper replicas of the guerrilla flag at a
parade to celebrate the cease-fire, declared Thursday at a 20-nation
African summit in Gbadolite, Zaire.
   ``The spirit of the cease-fire can be considered as holding,''
Savimbi said. He said isolated skirmishes could break out due to the
difficulty of contacting all combatants, but he said he thinks the
truce will last.
   The summit was the first meeting between Savimbi and President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos since the battle for power broke out in 1975
shortly after Angola gained independence from Portugal.
   The guerrilla movement controls areas in southeastern Angola
occupied by up to 3 million of the country's 9 million people.
   Savimbi and dos Santos sealed the accord with a handshake and
agreed to more talks.
   Since the handshake, Angola radio has referred to Savimbi as
``UNITA president,'' rather than its previous description of him as
a ``traitor'' and ``bandit leader.''
   Savimbi, meanwhile, said the rebel radio now refers to dos Santos
as ``president'' rather than ``caudillo,'' the Portuguese word for
``tyrant'' or ``dictator.''
   Savimbi praised dos Santos for his ``bravery'' in agreeing to the
talks with UNITA. ``I want President dos Santos to succeed,''
Savimbi said. ``I know he needs time.''
   Savimbi said he expected talks between the two sides in Zaire and
possibly another African summit to review the process in August or
September.
   The Angolan government said during the weekend that the
cease-fire was holding.
   UNITA's chief of intelligence, Gen. Wambu Chindondo, said the
rebels declared a halt to offensives in February and that the
guerrilla movement had no difficulty abiding by the cease-fire. He
said the combined Angolan-Cuban forces appeared to be preparing for
attacks but there were no major battles in recent weeks.
   The Angolan civil war has claimed tens of thousands of lives, and
involved several foreign governments including the United States,
the Soviet Union, South Africa and Cuba.
   In a dispatch from Luanda, the Portuguese news agency Lusa quoted
unidentified diplomatic and military sources as saying the United
States pressured Savimbi to attend the Gbadolite summit and accept
the Angolan peace plan.
   According to Lusa, the sources said Savimbi at first refused
because of ``internal discord'' within UNITA. Zaire President Mobutu
Sese Seko was ``obliged to contact Washington and Pretoria, in order
to ensure the success of the summit.''
   The cease-fire follows U.S.-brokered regional peace accords
Angola signed in New York in December with Cuba and South Africa.
   Under the accords, South Africa agreed to allow Angola's southern
neighbor, Namibia, independence under a U.N. plan and halt aid to
Savimbi's guerrillas. In exchange, Cuba agreed to a phased
withdrawal of its estimated 50,000 troops backing dos Santos'
government. UNITA was not party to the agreement.

<HEAD>Member of New Collective Leadership Pledges `Unambiguous Reform'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, HUNGARY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rezsoe Nyers said Monday he and the
other three members of the Communist Party's new collective
leadership will work together for ``unambiguous reform.''
   Nyers, the new party chairman, said the four leaders chosen over
the weekend have equal responsibility, but in matters of party
policy he is ``first among equals.''
   Creation of the four-man presidium by the Central Committee
appears to strengthen the reform wing and limit the power of Karoly
Grosz, the party general secretary, who also is a member.
   Grosz, who replaced longtime party chief Janos Kadar 13 months
ago, has resisted numerous demands from reformers that he resign.
   Also on the new leadership team are Imre Pozsgay, the party's
leading reformer, and reform-minded Premier Miklos Nemeth.
   Nyers, Pozsgay and Nemeth insisted at a news conference Monday
that each of the four had equal power.
   ``It is not a mathematical formula of three plus one,'' Nyers
said in a clear reference to the reformers and Grosz. ``It is not a
question of where we've been, but where we are going. The party
wishes to become a more unambiguous reform party.''
   He said the party had chosen to dissociate itself from
``extremes.''
   Pozsgay said: ``A real compromise was achieved. The important
matter is the unity of views, and not the differences.''
   He said peaceful transition to ``democratic socialism'' and a
multiparty system should not lead to a ``power vacuum.''
   ``A country should not run loose,'' Pozsgay declared. ``It is
important to govern.''
   Prominent members have expressed concern that a split might cause
the party to disintegrate. Pozsgay has said repeatedly that none of
the political groups springing up in Hungary is ready to assume
power.
   Nemeth said, ``It would be wrong to define unity by the former
criteria,'' under which the leadership presented a unifed platform.
``Everyone is a boss in some way'' in the new presidium, he said.
   As Nyers explained it, Grosz would be responsible for the entire
party apparatus and Nyers, the chairman, would handle the party's
domestic and foreign relations.
   Pozsgay has been proposed as the party candidate for president of
Hungary when the post is created. The new presidency would have far
greater powers than the current ceremonial office.
   In the new leadership ``everyone supports reform,'' Grosz told
the news conference, with debate centering on the type of reform and
the pace at which it should occur.

<HEAD>Sakharov Urges Cut in Soviet Army To Promote Disarmament</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet dissident Andrei D. Sakharov said
Monday that trimming the Soviet military and halving enlisted men's
service time would have ``a colossal effect for world disarmament.''
   Sakharov said the number of Soviet army officers should be
reduced at a slower rate ``with the view of setting up an
all-professional army.''
   He told reporters at the Nobel Institute that arms reduction
should be Moscow's major foreign policy priority.
   The institute is home of the committee that awarded him the 1975
Nobel Peace Prize. Sakharov, 68, arrived from London on Sunday for
his first visit here since winning the prize for his human rights
activities.
   Sakharov said the Soviets were being ``pragmatic'' in their
guarded response to the Beijing government's crushing of the Chinese
democracy movement and the death sentences for Chinese students.
   He pulled a paper from his pocket that he said was a telegram he
sent to world leaders. It said, ``Now is not the time for cautious,
pragmatic reactions.''
   Sakharov said that despite the Kremlin's removal of its last
troops in Afghanistan in February, ``the Soviet Union still has
considerable influence in Afghanistan and ought to reduce it.''
   He spent eight years in internal exile in Gorky for attacking the
mass Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan in late 1979.
   Sakharov, a renowed physicist who helped develop Soviet nuclear
capability, said he favors continued use of nuclear energy, but
recommended that power plants be built underground.
   Sakharov and his wife, Yelena Bonner, were invited by the
Oslo-based Norwegian Research Council for Science and the
Humanities; the Nobel Committee and Michelsen Institute for Science
and Intellectual Freedom in Bergen.
   Soviet authorities would not let him come to Oslo to accept the
1975 Nobel prize and Ms. Bonner received it on his behalf.
   ``She came home full of warm feelings for Norway. Now I'm
extremely happy to be in this house which has so often been in my
thoughts,'' Sahkarov said.
   He is to meet Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland and Foreign
Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg. He also will address scientists,
visit research institutes and attend a human rights seminar.
   The Sakharovs earlier visited the Netherlands and Britain and
will proceed to Switzerland from Norway.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a text of former Speaker Jim Wright's
statement on his decision to resign his House seat effective Friday
and not seek re-election.
   Since announcing that I would retire from the House of
Representatives at the end of this month, I have received thousands
of written and verbal requests from people in my district imploring
me to reconsider.
   Some have spoken of writing my name in on the special election
ballot, and some others even have begun circulating petitions to
place my name on the ballot.
   Naturally I have been moved by such gracious and spontaneous
expressions of support. I did not encourage these entreaties, but
out of profound respect and affection for the wonderful people who
have been coming to me, I did not peremptorily dismiss their ideas.
I heard them out.
   As deeply as I appreciate the devoted friendship which impels
these sincere petitions, I must conclude that I was right in
announcing my retirement from Congress.
   Independent polling data have made it very clear that I could be
re-elected. These demonstrations of strong bipartisan support are
truly gratifying, but I feel that I probably have done as much good
as I can do in Congress at the present time and should look to the
next phase of my life.
   It is best for the institution and best for the people whom I've
served that I step aside now and make room for others.
   Thirty-four and a half years is a very long time, and I have been
richly blessed.
   To seek and gain the splendid honor of a public endorsement one
more time would be vainglorious. To do so without intending to serve
for a prolonged period would be pointless.
   To postpone the moment when another may begin would be a
disservice.
   I do not foreclose the possibility that at some future time and
some other way I may again be of service to our nation, but not in
elective office.
   As for now Betty and I are ready to enjoy a period of private
life. I will not be inactive, but I hope to be selective and pursue
a slightly less hectic pace than at present. I have received perhaps
65 or 70 speaking invitations, for example, and have accepted five
or six. I am also considering some limited business and professional
relationships and some invitations to write. I will have an office
in Fort Worth.
   If I should live to be 100, I shall never cease to be grateful to
the people of my area and to my colleagues in Congress who have made
it possible for me to do whatever good I've been able to do for our
country and to have the joy of doing it.

<HEAD>Justice Minister Says Deportations Can Help Put Down Uprising</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: SUBS 2nd graf to ADD first reference to Meridor.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The justice minister Monday said Israel should
deport more Palestinians to help crush the revolt in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Dan Meridor's suggestion is among tougher measures to handle the
18-month uprising proposed by Israeli officials and criticized by
the United States and human rights organizations.
   ``I think deportation is serious but must be used, I would say
perhaps even more that what has been done until now,'' Meridor told
army radio.
   ``I think it's an effective punishment when we have appropriate
evidence,'' he said.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has recommended speeding up
deportation procedures as well as demolishing more homes of
Palestinians suspected of anti-Israeli activities and lengthening
the term security suspects can be detained without trial from six
months to one year.
   Washington and human rights organizations say all three methods
ignore international conventions on the treatment of people in
occupied lands and violate due process of law because suspects have
no chance to go to court.
   The justice and defense ministries Sunday set up a joint
committee to devise tougher measures to put down the uprising.
   Meridor told the radio about 50 Palestinians have been deported
since the start of the uprising and nearly 300 houses have been
demolished or sealed.
   Also Monday, the body of a woman suspected of cooperating with
Israeli authorities was found in the West Bank city of Nablus, Arab
reports said. She had been beaten to death, they said.
   Palestinians said Sabah Khadi Kanaan, 30, had been accused of
collaborating with Israel's secret police, but an army spokesman
said police believe the killing was criminal.
   Ms. Kanaan was the 68th suspected collaborator killed by
Palestinians since the uprising began in December 1987. The unrest
has killed 536 Palestinians and 23 Israelis.
   A suspected collaborator killed Sunday initially was identified
by Arab reporters as Nidal Salhab, 21, but police Monday said
Salhab's father reported his son was alive. The victim's head had
been crushed, and police said they still are trying to determine his
identity.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, said Israel must present
a united front on its peace plan.
   ``Though it may be difficult and painful, Israel must declare and
demonstrate to one and all, friendly and unfriendly, that she is not
divided and that her mission of peace is sincere and real,'' Inouye
said, speaking at a Hebrew University graduation ceremony.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has proposed holding elections in
the occupied lands to select Palestinian representatives to open
negotiations on an interim peace agreement with Israel.
   Hard-liners in his right-wing Likud bloc oppose the plan, saying
it could lead to formation of a Palestinian state.
   Inouye also said the United States should stand behind Israel.
   ``This is a time of testing for America and Israel, testing
whether we are prepared to take this important step in the pathways
of peace, and we must not fail,'' Inouye said.

<HEAD>All 16 Known Victims of Aging Syndrome Attend Annual Reunion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fransie Geringer enjoyed himself Monday, but
at age 16 he knows he may not make it to the next annual reunion of
victims of progeria, the fatal syndrome that turns children old
before their time.
   The shrunken, pinch-faced South African, one of the 16 known
victims of the condition, praised the reunions in a soft, shy voice
as he visited Sea World marine park.
   ``I get to my see my friends,'' said Geringer, who suffered a
series of heart attacks in recent months and had to drop out of
school. ``It may be the last time.''
   Progeria sufferers and their families from Argentina, Australia,
Canada, England, the Netherlands, South Africa and the United States
are enjoying themselves at Sea World, Walt Disney World and a nearby
ranch.
   The reunion for the youngsters, who range in age from 4 to 19,
began June 23 and runs through Friday.
   Progeria, with a reported incidence of up to 1 in 8 million
births, is characterized by what appears to be rapid aging,
dwarfism, baldness and distortion of joints and faces. Most
sufferers die before they turn 20. The cause is unknown.
   Geringer's journey from Brakpan, South Africa, to California's
Disneyland in 1981 and his meeting there with three other victims of
the genetic syndrome made the world aware of the syndrome.
   Two of the other three have died, but Mickey Hays, 17, faces his
plight with bravado, saying he's a ``tough little Texan'' who's like
anyone else.
   ``There's nothing wrong with me,'' said the Longview, Texas,
teen-ager. ``I do what I like _ fishing, working on a race car with
my friend. ... I left school in the eighth grade. Don't need it.''
   The gatherings have been sponsored since 1982 by the
Philadelphia-based Sunshine Foundation, which grants the wishes of
terminally ill children.
   The number of progeria sufferers has remained about 16 for
several years, said Bill Sample, the former Philadelphia police
officer who founded the organization.
   ``About the time we add one, we lose one,'' said Sample.
   ``This reunion is critically important _ to the kids, the parents
especially. But to the medical community, too,'' Sample said.
   The annual gatherings may eventually lead to treatment, even
prevention, if researchers succeed in isolating the genetic
breakdown that causes the problem, said Drs. Ted Brown and Frank
DeBusk, who have been studying progeria for the past eight years.
   ``It has not been possible for any one doctor to see more than
one or two of these children at one time anywhere in the world,''
said Brown. ``Doctor DeBusk and I have been fortunate in having
reunions such as this.''
   Brown, a geneticist at Cornell Medical School who began studying
progeria in 1974, said he believes it's caused by a cell defect that
prevents normal absorption and elimination of a substance called
hyaluronic acid from the body. He believes he can prove his theory
in about two years.
   DeBusk, who is with the University of Florida's pediatrics
department, estimated there have been about 100 cases of progeria in
the world since it was first reported in 1866. Some researchers say
it appears in one out of 8 million births, others say one in 4
million.
   Some cases are not reported, and some are not properly identified
before the victims die. Some victims' parents deny their children
have it, DeBusk said.
   ``I'm sure there have to be many others,'' he said.

   Here are excerpts from Monday's Supreme Court
decisions upholding the death penalty for convicted murderers as
young as 16 and for mentally retarded killers.
   From Justice Antonin Scalia's majority opinion in the
juvenile-killers cases:
   Petitioners are correct in asserting that this court has not
confined the prohibition embodied in the Eight Amendment (banning
cruel and unusual punishment) to ``barbarous'' methods that were
generally outlawed in the 18th century, but instead has interpreted
the amendment in a flexible and dynamic manner.
   In determining what standards have evolved, however, we have
looked not to our own conceptions of decency, but to those of modern
American society as a whole. ... We emphasize that it is American
conceptions of decency that are dispositive, rejecting the
contention of petitioners and their various amici (organizations
filing friend-of-the-court briefs) that the sentencing practices of
other countries are relevant.
   First among the objective indicia that reflect the public
attitude toward a given sanction are statutes passed by society's
elected representatives. Of the 37 states whose laws permit capital
punishment, 15 decline to impose it upon 16-year-old offenders and
12 decline to impose it on 17-year-old offenders.
   This does not establish the degree of national consensus this
court has previously thought sufficient to label a particular
punishment cruel and unusual.
   From Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's concurring opinion:
   It is sufficiently clear that no national consensus forbids the
imposition of capital punishment on 16- or 17-year-old capital
murderers.
   I am unable, however, to join the remainder of (Scalia's) opinion
(which in part) emphatically rejects the suggestion that, beyond an
assessment of the specific enactments of American legislatures,
there remains a constitutional obligation imposed upon this court to
judge whether the nexus between the punishment imposed and the
defendant's blameworthiness is proportional. In my view, this court
does have a constitutional obligation to conduct proportional
analysis.
   From Justice William J. Brennan's dissenting opinion:
   I believe that to take the life of a person as punishment for a
crime committed when below the age of 18 is cruel and unusual, and
hence is prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.
   Together, the rejection of the death penalty for juveniles by a
majority of the states, the rarity of the sentence for juveniles ...
the decisions of respected organizations in relevant fields that
this punishment is unacceptable, and its rejection generally
throughout the world provide to my mind a strong grounding for the
view that it is not constitutionally tolerable that certain states
persist in authorizing the execution of adolescent offenders.
   From O'Connor's controlling opinion in the death penalty for
retarded killers ruling:
   Mental retardation is a factor that may well lessen a defendant's
culpability for a capital offense. But we cannot conclude today that
the Eighth Amendment precludes the execution of any mentally
retarded person of (Johnny Paul) Penry's ability convicted of a
capital offense simply by virtue of their mental retardation alone.
   So long as sentencers can consider and give effect to mitigating
evidence of mental retardation in imposing sentence, an
individualized determination of whether death is the appropriate
punishment can be made in each particular case.
   While a national consensus against execution of the mentally
retarded may someday emerge reflecting the evolving standards of
decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, there is
insufficient evidence of such a consensus today.
   From Brennan's opinion, concurring in part and dissenting in part:
   I agree that the jury instructions given at sentencing in this
case deprived petitioner of his constitutional right to have a jury
consider all mitigating evidence that he presented before sentencing
him to die. I would also hold, however, that the Eighth Amendment
prohibits the execution of offenders who are mentally retarded and
who thus lack the full degree of responsibility for their crimes
that is a predicate for the constitutional imposition of the death
penalty.
   From Justice John Paul Stevens' opinion concurring in part and
dissenting in part:
   (Justice Scalia's opinion) adequately and fairly states the
competing arguments respecting capital punishment of mentally
retarded persons. In my judgment, however, that explication _
particularly the summary of the American Association on Mental
Retardation and other amici curiae (friends of the court) _ compels
the conclusion that such executions are unconstitutional.
   From Scalia's opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part:
   In holding that the jury had to be free to deem Penry's mental
retardation and sad childhood relevant for whatever purpose it
wished, the court has come full circle, not only permitting but
requiring what (the court) once condemned. ``freakishly'' and
``wantonly'' have been rebaptized ``reasoned moral response.''

<HEAD>Chicago Merc Should Do Better Policing Job, Says CFTC Staff</HEAD>

   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and other
futures markets should do a better job of cracking down on
high-pressure telephone sales tactics at member firms, the staff of
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Monday.
   The staff report praised the exchange for responding to earlier
suggestions for improvement, but said more needs to be done to
ensure that ``investigative procedures adequately address the issue
of detecting abusive oral sales representations.''
   One of the biggest complaints of securities and futures customers
after the October 1987 stock market crash was that they had been
talked into making unsuitably speculative investments without being
properly warned of the risks.
   The staff of the commission, which regulates futures markets,
praised the Merc for starting a program of interviewing customers to
make sure futures brokers don't use sale pitches designed to
override risk disclosure documents provided to customers. However,
it said the exchange should routinely conduct the interviews in a
more systematic and timely fashion.
   Specifically, the commission staff said the Merc did a poor job
of investigating a particular firm, which it did not identify, that
had attracted an unusual number of customer complaints.
   ``The (CFTC) Division (of Trading and Markets) believes that the
exchange's investigation was not concluded (in a) timely (manner)
and should have included certain additional procedures'' such as an
attempt to uncover high pressure sales tactics,'' the agency's
report said.
   It also said that the exchange's requirement that most actions by
staff investigators be authorized by an internal committee ``may
unnecessarily prolong an investigation.''
   Andrew A. Yemma, a spokesman for the exchange, said the Merc
disagreed with the commission's assessment of that particular
investigation.
   ``We believe our efforts were timely and thorough and we will
attempt to bridge this gap with the CFTC,'' he said.
   However, he said the exchange intends to adopt a commission
suggestion that it work more closely with the National Futures
Association and will adopt an invesigatory technique used by the
association. The association sometimes has its investigators pose as
customers as a way of uncovering sales abuses.
   In another recommendation, the commission said the Merc's member
firms should do a better job of supervising sales personnel who were
hired away from other firms that got into trouble with regulators.
   ``Members of the (Mercantile) and of other exchanges as well have
employed, and in some cases even, recruited ... (employees) of firms
subject to commission enforcement proceedings or disciplinary
actions for sales violations,'' the report said.
   Yemma said the Mercantile would adopt the recommended procedures
for monitoring such employees.
   In general, he said the Merc believes the commission report was
favorable. For instance, it praises the exchange for more than
doubling its audit staff from 16 in May 1985 to 35 in January 1988.
   Futures markets regulation has become a particular focus of
Congress since the disclosure in February that the FBI had conducted
a two-year undercover investigation of alleged abuses. Members of
Congress are questioning whether futures exchanges' self-regulation
system is working and whether the commission is providing effective
oversight of the system.
   The legislative scrutiny will likely come to a head this fall
because Congress must reauthorize the commission before Sept. 30 or
the agency will go out of business.

<HEAD>Storm Center Makes Landfall With Torrential Rain and 65 Mph Wind</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA TOLLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tropical Storm Allison, the first named storm of
the Atlantic hurricane season, swept ashore south of Houston on
Monday with wind gusts of 65 mph and torrential rain that inundated
roads in coastal towns.
   A tugboat was capsized, a barge was driven aground and roofs were
damaged.
   Landfall came near Freeport, about 60 miles south of Houston,
with the storm packing a sustained wind speed of 50 mph and weather
forecasters predicting as much as 15 inches of rain in the next 24
hours.
   The National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., said
tropical storm-force wind extended as far as 150 miles to the east
of the center of the storm. Little change in the storm's strength
was expected Monday.
   A tropical storm warning was in effect from Freeport to Morgan
City, La.
   Allison had been a slow-moving tropical depression but was
upgraded to a tropical storm Monday morning after its sustained wind
speed reached 39 mph.
   ``It has a poorly defined center,'' weather service meteorologist
Larry Vannozzi said. ``There probably will be some minor wind
damage. The main thing is the rain. It's a heavy rainmaker.''
   Forecasters warned that 10 to 15 inches of rain was possible over
eastern Texas and southwestern Louisiana as large bands of rain
moved onshore.
   The heavy rain prompted the weather service to issue a flash
flood watch for much of the southeastern Texas coast and a flash
flood warning for Brazoria and Galveston counties, south of Houston,
and parts of Harris County.
   Some areas of Brazoria County had received more than 10 inches of
rain in the previous couple of days, and that amount also was
expected for parts of Houston, weather service meteorologist Ernest
Chapa said.
   ``It should weaken after it goes ashore, but it'll take a
while,'' Chapa said.
   The storm was blamed for capsizing a tugboat in Galveston Bay and
sending a benzene-bearing barge aground in the Houston Ship Channel.
Three people escaped serious injury and the barge was not believed
to be damaged, Coast Guard spokesman Mark Kennedy said.
   ``It may be able to ride out the storm aground,'' Kennedy said.
``These are fairly soft and sandy bars and reefs so maybe it won't
be a problem.''
   Tides ranged from 3 to 5 feet above normal, Chapa said.
   In Galveston, the rain and high tides pushed Highland Bayou out
of its banks along a highway, submerging cars in more than 4 feet of
water.
   On Galveston Island, some residents with beach homes on the west
end reported a foot of water in their yards, weather service
specialist Debbie Cage said. A torn-off roof and a damaged garage
were possibly caused by a tornado, Ms. Cage said.
   In Brazoria County, residents in the small island community of
Quintana Beach were advised to evacuate because rising water
threatened to close the area's swing bridge.
   ``We're telling them if they want to get out, they'd better get
out now,'' Chief Deputy Charles Wagner said of the Brazoria County
Sheriff's Department.
   Brazoria County Emergency Management Coordinator Jack McCann also
advised residents of low-lying areas to seek higher ground.
   The weather service reported some roads were closed in the
Kemah-Seabrook area and near the Houston Ship Channel, which was
closed by tides 5 feet above mean sea level. Some roads in the Texas
City and Dickinson area, north of Galveston, also were closed by
high water, as were some Houston-area freeway feeder roads.
   Houston Lighting &amp; Power Co. reported 30,000 customers were
without electricity. The University of Houston at Clear Lake was
among several schools to cancel Monday night classes.
   The storm had its origins in Hurricane Cosme, which moved from
the Pacific Ocean across Mexico last week.

   A recess was reported Monday in talks
with Poland aimed at ending mistrust rooted in the German invasion
that began World War II, but the government would not say whether
progress had been made.
   Negotiations began six months ago on an exchange of West German
economic aid to communist Poland Polish recognition of its German
minority. Agreement would play a symbolic role in easing relations.
   A West German government spokesman, who demanded anonymity,
confirmed the latest round had ended, but said ``we cannot release
details at this time.'' He refused to say whether agreement was near
on a visit to Warsaw this year by Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   West German officials had hoped the latest talks would open the
way for a visit and presage reconciliation between the two countries.
   Negotiations ``are to be taken up again soon'' but he did not
know whether a date had been set, the spokesman said.
   Horst Teltschik, one of Kohl's main advisers, met in Bonn for
most of the day with Ernest Kucza, head of the foreign affairs
department of the Polish Communist Party Central Committee.
   Suedwestfunk radio said ``the talks were broken off'' and ``no
new date has yet been set'' for resumption.
   Lack of progress in relations with Poland has been a foreign
policy disappointment for Kohl, who has built on West Germany's
earlier agreements with other Soviet bloc countries.
   West Germany seeks recognition of language rights for Poland's
German minority and other improvements in conditions for the ethnic
Germans. Poland wants help for its crippled economy.
   Polish officials said before the Monday meeting they had agreed
to Bonn's conditions, but that disagreement remained on economic
aid. The West Germans said the amount of new credit to be given
Poland was the only point unresolved.

   The forced exodus of Turks from Bulgaria
demonstrates a systematic denial of basic human rights by the
Bulgarian government, the White House said Monday.
   ``We deplore Bulgaria's blatant violations of the human rights of
its citizens,'' presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a
statement.
   Fitzwater said about 60,000 Turks had ``either fled or been
forcibly expelled'' and had migrated to Turkey in the last month,
``many with nothing more than the clothes on their backs.''
   The United States has urged Bulgaria ``to cease these violations
and to allow for the orderly emigration of those ethnic Turks who
desire to leave,'' Fitzwater's statement said.
   Restraints on Bulgarians of Turkish descent, including forbidding
the use of the Turkish language, sparked riots throughout the
country last month in which 30 people were reported killed. The
Bulgarian government began deporting ethnic Turks on May 26.
   There are an estimated 1 million Bulgarians of Turkish descent.
They are Moslems, while the majority of Bulgarians are Christian.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Tropical Storm Allison rolled ashore Monday in Texas with high
wind, torrential rain and high tides as thunderstorms packing
damaging winds and tornadoes formed from Colorado to the East Coast.
   Allison's main threat was expected to be heavy rain, with up to
10 to 15 inches of rainfall considered possible in eastern Texas and
southwestern Louisiana before late Tuesday afternoon.
   In just 20 minutes, 1.10 inches of rain fell on northern Bossier
City, La., and in 6 hours 1.89 inches of rain fell at Galveston,
Texas, with 1.21 inches at Houston.
   A tornado touched down in Galveston, but no injuries or damage
were reported.
   In the Houston area, Allison flooded streets and cut off power to
30,000 Houston Lighting &amp; Power Co. customers. Tides 5 feet above
mean sea level closed the Houston Ship Channel from Galveston Bay to
Houston. Several schools, including the University of Houston at
Clear Lake, canceled Monday night classes.
   Much of the nation east of the Rockies was under a hot, humid,
unstable air mass, just the right ingredients for thunderstorms. By
early afternoon thunderstorms popped up over many locations from
Colorado to the East Coast.
   A line of strong thunderstorms reached from eastern Wisconsin to
northwestern Illinois and northeastern Missouri.
   In Wisconsin, scores of confirmed and unconfirmed tornado
touchdowns were reported in the south-central section of the state.
   Sheriff's offices reported damage to homes and many trees in
Richland and Sauk counties, including a mobile home destroyed south
of Richland Center, and damage to numerous barns, small buildings,
trees and power lines.
   A school addition under construction at Baraboo was toppled by
high wind, injuring a worker, officials said.
   Severe thunderstorms produced heavy damage at Avoca, about 40
miles west of Madison, and winds gusted to 60 mph just west of
Monroe.
   Thunderstorm winds downed trees and power lines in Eagle, and
1{-inch diameter hail was reported in northwestern Milwaukee County.
   Numerous thunderstorms developed rapidly across parts of
southeastern Kansas, most of the mid- and lower Mississippi Valley,
southern Florida, and New York state. A tornado touchdown was
reported near North Miami Beach, Fla.
   Severe thunderstorms also formed over parts of eastern Colorado.
Hail an inch in diameter fell in Waterton, and 1- to 2-inch hail
pelted other parts of central Jefferson County.
   Montana continued its run of cool weather with a record low for
the date of 41 degrees at Glasgow.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 56
degrees at Bellingham, Wash., to 102 at Phoenix and Gila Bend, Ariz.
Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 27 at Leadville, Colo.
   For Tuesday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from southeast Missouri to eastern Wisconsin, the central and
eastern Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley and the central and northern
Appalachians, as well as from the eastern halves of Oklahoma and
Texas to the lower Mississippi and Florida. Widely scattered showers
and thunderstorms were forecast from northern California to the
northern Rockies, and in the mountains of Colorado and northern New
Mexico.
   Highs in the 60s and 70s were predicted from the Pacific
Northwest to northwestern Montana, as well as northern Minnesota,
upper Michigan, and along the central and southern coasts of
California; between 100 and 110 degrees from the desert Southwest to
far southwestern Texas; and in the 80s and 90s in the rest of the
nation.

   A Soviet nuclear submarine caught fire Monday
off Norway, the second such accident since April, but the Soviets
said no radiation was released. Norway complained of a long delay in
reporting the accident.
   Fire began on the Echo II class sub, built in the 1960s, when a
reactor broke down 70 miles off the coast, Soviet and Norwegian
officials said.
   The reactor was shut down and there were no casualties, the
Soviet Defense Ministry said. The vessel was bound for the Soviet
naval base at Murmansk under auxiliary diesel power, accompanied by
other Soviet vessels, the ministry said.
   Adm. Vladimir N. Chernavin, the Soviet navy commander, said on
Soviet television Monday evening the submarine's nuclear weapons
were safe after the accident and no radioactivity was released. He
did not give sub's name.
   The authoritative British handbook ``Jane's Fighting Ships'' says
Echo II submarines are 380 feet long with crews of 90 and have eight
missile silos built for cruise missiles.
   Johan Joergen Holst, the Norwegian defense minister, said, ``We
were not informed by the Soviets but had to find out for ourselves''
about the fire.
   He would not say how Norway learned of the accident, citing
security considerations. Press reports said a radio distress signal
from the sub to its base probably was intercepted.
   Holst said Norway would test air and water in the area because
``the information we have is not detailed enough to know if there
was a radiation leak.''
   In Washington, the State Department said Soviet claims of no
radiation could not be confirmed until tests were completed.
   Norwegian intellegence learned of the accident at 5 a.m. and air
force F-16 fighters confirmed half an hour later that smoke was
billowing from it, he said.
   A cable from the Soviet Foreign Ministry at 10 a.m., responding
to an official Norwegian request for information, said the fire
started at 4:30 a.m., Holst said.
   The Norwegian rescue center received word shortly before 10 a.m.
that its helicopters and rescue vessels would not be needed. The
center cooperates with the Murmansk rescue center under a 1988
agreement covering emergencies at sea.
   In his television interview, Chernavin said the stricken
submarine would arrive in Murmansk on Thursday.
   Maj. Gullow Gjeseth, spokesman for Norway's Supreme Defense
Command, said it took Moscow more than a day to inform Norway,
through diplomatic channels, of the sinking April 7 of a Mike-class
nuclear submarine, in which 42 sailors died.
   After the fire Monday, Holst said: ``It is unsatisfactory for us
as a neighboring state not to be warned'' immediately about an
accident aboard anuclear submarine.
   ``When two such incidents happen so close together, we cannot
help but feel uneasy about these vessels close to our waters,'' he
said. ``If there are operational problems with nuclear-powered
submarines carrying nuclear weapons, then we are uneasy.''
   The Soviet cable to the Norwegian Embassy in Moscow said ``there
was a break due to fatigue in the first chamber of the reactor .. .
which has been shut down.'' It said the sub declined offers of help
because ``there are several Soviet vessels in the vicinity.''
   Izvestia, the Soviet government daily, quoted Defense Minister
Dmitri T. Yazov as saying a pipe on a reactor burst and the hermetic
seal was broken.
   Capt. Y. Kasatkin took his vessel to the surface and shut down
nuclear power, then other Soviet ships provided water to cool the
reactor, Yazov said.
   The submarine crew fired a flare and waved off a Norwegian rescue
helicopter to indicate the ship did not want help, said Terje B.
Lien, of the Norway Rescue Coordination Center.
   Maj. Gjeseth said about 100 nuclear submarines, including 30 of
the Echo II class, operate from the Soviet base on the Kola
Peninsula near Norway.
   It was the third recent accident involving a Soviet vessel. The
Soviet cruise ship Maxim Gorky was torn open by ice June 20 near
Norway's Spitzbergen Island. No casualties were reported among the
950 people aboard, who were evacuated.

<HEAD>Agrarian Reform Secretary Resigns Over Land Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's land reform secretary
has resigned, but President Corazon Aquino said Monday she would not
accept the resignation until scandals in his department are
investigated.
   Philip Juico said he submitted the resignation Saturday because
of allegations of criminal conspiracy in the purchase of an estate
in Camarines Sur province for distribution to peasants.
   The purchase was blocked in December when officials said the
government had agreed to pay $3 million for land worth only $142,000.
   Juico and 20 department officials went on leave last month after
newspapers disclosed the deal. At the time, Juico said he was taking
leave so an investigation Mrs. Aquino ordered would not be
influenced.
   After the Camarines Sur sale was disclosed, investigators said
that in at least two other cases, Juico's department agreed to pay
vastly inflated sums for land.
   The secretary has denied wrongdoing and said subordinates
deceived him. He He said Monday that his resignation was not an
admission of guilt.
   Mrs. Aquino told reporters she had received the resignation but
would wait for the investigating committee's recommendations ``and
then act accordingly.''
   J. Antonio Carpio, head of the National Bureau of Investigation,
said last week he had recommended criminal charges against 19
department officials. He refused to name them.

   The two leaders met in the Oval Office for 35 minutes.
   During the session, Bush ``expressed his appreciation for
Portugal's positive contribution to the North Atlantic Alliance,''
said Marlin Fitzwater, Bush's press secretary.
   ``The two leaders discussed the European Community, China and
Central America. Southern Africa was also discussed, particularly
the Angola peace process,'' Fitzwater said.
   During a picture-taking session at the beginning of the meeting,
Bush told the Portugese leader: ``We sure appreciate the wonderful
closeness of Portugal and the United States on these NATO East-west
issues.''
   Soares told Bush, through a translator, that he also planned to
visit California and to meet with Portugese-American leaders in Los
Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego.
   ``There are about half a million people of Portugese descent in
California,'' Soares said.
   ``That's a lot,'' Bush said.
   ``They're quite prominent too,'' Soares added.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alan C. Nelson, criticized earlier this year in
a Justice Department audit, was replaced Monday as head of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, the department said.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh announced in a brief statement
that he was appointing James L. Buck, deputy INS commissioner, as
acting head of the service to replace Nelson, who resigned.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel declined to say why
Nelson was being replaced before a permanent successor is found.
   But a Justice Department source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said officials were concerned about the overall
management at INS, which was criticized in the audit ordered earlier
this year by Thornburgh.
   Officials were particularly concerned about the agency's budget
because Nelson _ as a lame duck _ had no incentive to control
spending, the source said.
   Nelson, a holdover from the Reagan administration, has been
privately criticized by department officals, who have long signaled
that he would be replaced.
   His resignation has been pending since the start of the Bush
administration but was not accepted until this weekend, Runkel said.
   Gene McNary, the chief executive of St. Louis County, Mo., is
expected to be nominated by President Bush to fill the post.
   INS spokesman Greg Leo said senior officials of the agency were
not informed of Thornburgh's decision to replace Nelson with Buck
until 10:30 a.m. Monday, about the time the Justice Department
issued its public announcement.
   Leo said Nelson, who was in California, was first advised last
Wednesday that Bush would be accepting his resignation and was
formally informed of the action by telephone on Saturday.
   The audit said accounting, management and administration were in
disarray, citing a growing backlog of cases awaiting adjudication.
   It also noted that INS Western regional officials had chartered
jets to fly to conferences when commercial flights were available.
   More recently, Nelson raised the ire of Justice Department
officials by approving a trip to the National Sheriff's Association
convention in Honolulu of 19 officials of his agency.
   Nelson was forced to cancel the trips of all but three or four
after the department issued an order ``to curtail the number of
attendees traveling'' to conferences and meetings.
   This episode, the source said, raised concerns in the Justice
Department about Nelson's commitment to controlling spending.
   Nelson defended his agency against criticisms in the audit, which
he called ``grossly deficient.''
   The audit noted that the agency had spent $1,500 for an oil
portrait of Nelson. Justice Department officials were also privately
critical of a videotape tribute to Nelson that INS produced at
taxpayer expense.
   In his statement, Thornburgh noted that Nelson ``has led the
Immigration and Naturalization Service through difficult times.''
   During his tenure at INS, Nelson oversaw the amnesty program for
illegal aliens that was enacted by the 1986 Immigration Reform and
Control Act.
   Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., who chairs the House immigration
subcomittee, said in a statement that he ``wished Commissioner
Nelson well'' but added that ``I have long felt that a change in
leadership was needed'' at INS.
   ``But more than new leadership, what is needed is a complete
reorganization of the structure if the functions now collected under
the INS are to be performed effectively.''

<HEAD>Power Cuts Expanded in Uruguay; General Strike Called</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state power company said Monday
that electricity shutdowns in this capital city of 1.2 million
people will be doubled to six hours a day. It put most of the blame
on drought.
   Uruguay's biggest labor coalition meanwhile announced it will
stage on Tuesday its eighth general strike against the government of
President Julio Sanguinetti to press demands for wage and pension
increases.
   Jose Serrato, president of the state Electric Power and
Transmission Co. said electricity in Montevideo and several other
cities will be cut from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m., adding, ``Since records
have been kept, there has not been so severe a shortage of rain.''
   Much of the electricity in this Oklahoma-sized, South American
nation of 3 million comes from hydropower. The lack of rain has
idled 13 of the 14 turbines of the Salto Grande complex on the
Uruguay River, a major power source.
   For weeks, Uruguay bought electricity from neighboring Argentina.
But this week Argentina, which has been having its own troubles, is
scheduled to resume power cuts itself.
   A bit more than 8{ inches of rain have fallen this year, Serrato
said, less than half the normal amount.
   Drinking water is being rationed in the small city of Melo.
Throughout Uruguay, grazing land has dried out and water is being
trucked in for livestock.
   The general strike was called by the National Central of Workers,
which is demanding a pay increase of about 30 percent starting July
1.
   The current minimum wage, set in February, is about $70 a month.
   The increase would apply to many of the approximately 260,000
state employees, who make up about one-quarter of the total work
force. Private sector companies raised wages by about 25 percent for
the March-June period.
   Inflation for 1989 is projected at 80 percent.
   Union leaders also want an increase in retirement pensions and
oppose proposals to sell state companies which might result in
layoffs or higher prices for services.

   In another outbreak of ethnic rioting, Georgians
and Azerbaijanis clashed in Soviet Georgia and five people were
wounded, a news editor in the southern republic said Monday.
   The riots took place Sunday night in Marneuli and Bolnisi, said
Zurab Lomidze, an editor of Gruzinform, the official Georgian news
agency. Lomidze said he had no details about the clashes or what
caused them and there were no reports about the rioting in the other
Soviet media.
   In April, 20 people were killed in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi,
when troops were called in to quell a pro-democracy demonstration.
   In other ethnic clashes, Tass reported one more person died
Sunday from injuries sustained in the Central Asian republic of
Kazakhstan, raising the death toll there to five. Tass said 22
people remain hospitalized.
   The June 17-20 riots were in the oil production center of Novy
Uzen between Kazakhs and settlers from the Caucasus Mountains
region. Native Kazakhs complain the settlers dominate oil industry
jobs and receive preferential treatment in housing and other
benefits.
   More than 3,500 people have fled Novy Uzen because of the unrest,
Tass reported. A curfew remained in effect and the city was calm,
the news agency said.
   In the last two months, ethnic protests were also reported in the
Central Asian republics of Tadzhikistan and Uzbekistan. In the worst
rioting, about 100 people died in the Fergana Valley region of
Uzbekistan earlier this month.

   Troops launched an operation on
Monday to put down a 7-month-old secessionist uprising, burning
homes and seizing villagers, according to news reports.
   The revolt has closed an economically crucial mine of
Bougainville Copper Ltd. on northern Bougainville island. The
insurrectionists were reported overnight to have destroyed a power
plant at a farm owned by the company.
   Unrest shut down the mine May 15. Rebel landowners complain it
damages the environment and want $10 billion in compensation. The
pit had been contributing 20 percent of Papua New Guinea's total
revenue through royalties and taxes.
   Rebels spurned all attempts at conciliation, ambushing mine
workers and soldiers. Three soldiers were killed and about 20
security force members and many civilians were wounded.
   Under a state of emergency that went into effect Monday,
authorities were granted broad powers to search, seize and arrest,
and to evacuate people from emergency areas, Australian Associated
Press said.
   The agency quoted witnesses as reporting houses were set afire
and at least two dozen people were taken away by police on Monday,
with soldiers blocking the road to the mine and checking all
vehicles.
   It said many residents probably will be evacuated by force from
rebel-held areas to isolate secessionist leader Francis Ona, a
35-year-old surveyor, and his Bougainville Republican Army.
   Australia's largest mining company, CRA Ltd., jointly operates
the mine, which is about 300 miles northeast of the mainland.
   Security forces commander Col. Lima Dotaona asked Ona to
surrender. He expressed confidence on Sunday that his forces would
restore order, but said he expected a drawn-out operation.
   Prime Minister Rabbie Namaliu said Friday the government could
not let a ``criminal minority'' threaten national unity and economic
stability.
   Papua New Guinea, with 3.5 million people, became independent
from Australia in 1975. It lies in the tropics between Asia and
Australia.

   South Africa's emerging new leaders must be
pressured to quickly end apartheid because ``the time is running
out'' for a ``congenial, bloodless'' resolution, Australian Prime
Minister Bob Hawke said Monday.
   ``It is the time now for pressure to bring them not to their
knees, but to the (negotiating) table ... '' Hawke said in answer to
questions at the National Press Club.
   Hawke said apartheid will be resolved one way or another and
``the time is running out where the conflict can be resolved in a
congenial, bloodless way.''
   ``I trust ... that what will be done by the rest of the world is
to keep up pressure, but to give the new leadership emerging in
South Africa the opportunity of responding, getting them to
understand that only by getting to the negotiating table in the near
future are we going to have the opportunity of a resolution of the
conflict in a bloodless way,'' he continued.
   Leaders of South Africa's black resistance movement, the African
National Congress, and the black frontline countries bordering South
Africa want a multiracial society in the country, Hawke said. They
recognize that country's future prosperity depends on keeping the
whites, white capital and expertise, he said.
   But those black leaders ``are running out of time with their
younger generations,'' who question such an attitude when it brings
no positive response, he added.
   Hawke described as ``silly'' the view of those who said that U.S.
economic sanctions voted by Congress over former President Ronald
Reagan's veto failed to have the desired effect. He noted that both
the South African finance minister and central bank governor
admitted the sanctions had the impact of forcing a lowering of
standards and expectations.
   F. W. de Klerk, the new leader of South Africa's governing
National Party, is expected to succeed President P. W. Botha later
this year and a de Klerk visit to Washington is under diplomatic
discussion, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen said last
week.

   U.S. and Soviet negotiators resumed talks Monday on
monitoring nuclear tests, and both sides predicted agreement soon.
   They are drafting new monitoring provisions for two superpower
treaties of the 1970s, still not ratified by the U.S. Senate,
limiting military and other nuclear explosions to 150 kilotons.
   One kiloton has the force of 1,000 tons of TNT. The bomb dropped
on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945, originally reckoned at 20 kilotons,
had an explosive force of 12 or 13 kilotons.
   The goal is to get Senate ratification, which was withheld
because of concern that the limits could not be enforced.
   Talks resumed after a six-month recess caused, in part, by the
Bush administration review of arms control and security policy.
   Monday's meeting was held at the U.S. Mission in Geneva, between
delegation chiefs C. Paul Robinson of the United States and Igor
Palenykh of the Soviet Union.
   Robinson has said the purpose of the new negotiations, expected
to last five to six weeks, is to produce complete agreements.
Palenykh said there is ``a good basis for reaching practical results
within a short time.''
   They said a verification plan for the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear
Explosions Treaty is virtually complete but some work remains on how
to prevent cheating on the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty.
   Both sides are to be allowed various methods of measuring the
power of explosions, including on-site checks at each other's
testing grounds.
   Future negotiations are intended to produce more agreements to
limit nuclear tests and ultimately prohibit the.
   The Soviet Union has urged Washington to join in a test ban, but
the United States says tests will be necessary as long as its
military strategy includes reliance on nuclear weapons.
   Talks on nuclear testing are separate from U.S.-Soviet
negotiations on reducing long-range nuclear arsenals, which resumed
in Geneva last week.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in Washington
that a realistic verification plan is crucial to success of the new
talks on monitoring tests.
   ``The U.S. approach to these negotiations complements our efforts
to reach agreements that will strengthen our security and enhance
stability,'' Fitzwater said in a statement. ``A priority for these
step-by-step talks is to complete protocols to provide for effective
verification'' of the two treaties.
   He said the Senate ratified neither treaty because ``they were
not ratifiable in their original form.''
   ``Our approach to these negotiations is based on a realistic
approach to our security,'' Fitzwater said. ``As long as we must
rely on nuclear weapons, we must continue to test to ensure their
safety, security, reliability, effectiveness and survivability.''

<HEAD>Congressional Report: Federal Mining Agency Violated Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal agency violated its own policy when
it cleared the way for an Ohio coal company to strip mine coal in
the Wayne National Forest, congressional investigators have
concluded.
   ``It is improper for the Office of Surface Mining to have based
this decision on considerations other than its stated policy,'' said
a report by the House Interior Committee's mining subcommittee
delivered to the Interior Department, parent of the Office of
Surface Mining, on Friday and made available on Monday.
   Agency records showed the decision to let Belville Coal Co. of
Ironton, Ohio to mine was based on flimsy reasoning, a skimpy review
and no independent documentation, according to the report.
   Carl Close, the director of the Pittsburgh office of the Office
of Surface Mining, has said he consulted a staff attorney and
believed he was on firm legal ground when he made the now-contested
decision.
   Close in December reversed a 1986 decision and determined that
the company had a valid existing right to mine in the 190,000-acre
forest on the Ohio River _ in other words, mineral rights that
pre-dated creation of the forest that the federal government was
bound to recognize.
   ``It is inappropriate for a decision of this magnitude, involving
approximately 5,440 acres of National Forest land, to have been
based on a dearth of written independent agency analysis and
supporting agency documentation,'' the report said.
   ``No record exists which suggests that the Office of Surface
Mining conducted a thorough analysis'' before ruling that the
company had a legal right to strip mine for coal, said the report.
   The company has submitted an application for state mining permits
covering 180 acres. Spokesman Todd Ambs said the Ohio Department of
Natural Resources ``will probably act on it sometime before the end
of the summer.''
   Interior Department spokesman John Wright said Monday a deputy
assistant secretary was reviewing the Wayne Forest determination
``to see what prompted the decision, how it was based,'' and he
could not comment on the report.
   The congressional probe was conducted at the request of Rep. Nick
Rahall, D-W.Va., chairman of the subcommittee. He has asked Interior
Secretary Manual Lujan to freeze activity on all pending coal rights
claims until there's a federal standard in place.
   Wright said a reply probably would be ready next week.
   The Forest Service, part of the Agriculture Department, and the
congressional investigators contend the Office of Surface Mining
should have followed state standards since there's no federal
standard governing companies that buy previous owners' mineral
rights and apply to mine on land like national forests.
   An unsigned, undated Office of Surface Mining memorandum provided
to the investigators said turning down the coal company was
``probably the most defensible position legally.''

   Eastern Airlines and its pilots' union met
under court order Monday, negotiating for the first time since
Eastern sought permission last week to cancel the pilots' contract
and impose wage and other concessions.
   Representatives of Eastern and the Air Line Pilots Association
met with David I. Shapiro, the court-appointed examiner overseeing
the airline on behalf of the bankruptcy court.
   A pilots' union spokesman said ``nothing fruitful'' came from the
talks, which were ordered by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R.
Lifland. ``It was essentially feeling-out process, a discussion of
basic issues,'' said the spokesman, Dan Asbhy. Another session was
scheduled for Tuesday.
   In a related matter, a House subcommittee plans this week to
examine the impact of the nearly 4-month-old strike, and a Senate
panel has asked the General Accounting Office to assess the impact
Eastern's proposed reorganization would have on the airline industry.
   A group of six senators also is asking Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner to, at least temporarily, block Eastern from selling
more assets, a major part of the airline's reorganization plan.
   A consultant to the pilots' union said over the weekend that
Shapiro would oppose Eastern's bid to terminate the contract.
Shapiro did not return calls seeking comment Monday and Eastern said
it wasn't aware of Shapiro's position.
   Most of Eastern's pilots are, in effect, striking, although
technically they are honoring the pickets of the striking
machinists, as are Eastern's flight attendants.
   The meeting, at Shapiro's law office here, came five days after
Eastern requested about $50 million in wage and benefit concessions,
as well as changes in work policies that would allow Eastern to
increase pilots' hours.
   ``We've been trying to get the pilots to meet with us for some
time,'' said Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock. ``We at least see this
as having brought that about.''
   Ashlock declined to say whether Eastern had revised any of its
positions.
   Ashby said Eastern's statements that the pilots have refused to
meet were groundless and appeared to be part of an effort to
convince the bankruptcy court that the pilots were acting in bad
faith.
   The federal Railway Labor Act, which also covers airline
collective bargaining, requires both sides to continue negotiating
unless an impasse is declared and the talks referred to a federal
mediator.
   ``You'd never know it by what the company says but we've met with
them at every scheduled meeting,'' Ashby said.
   Eastern said it needed contract concessions from the pilots as
part of its plan to reorganize and emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protections as a smaller carrier.
   Lifland would have to approve the reorganization plan, which
includes major asset sales. The unions unsuccessfully have sought
the sale of Eastern.
   Lifland said three weeks ago that the court would no longer
consider the buyout offer of Chicago commodities trader Joseph
Ritchie, although he said Ritchie was free to pursue his offer with
Eastern.
   The airline has said it doesn't plan to sell, but the unions have
maintained that Ritchie's effort to buy Eastern continues.
   On Captol Hill, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and
Transportation has requested the GAO investigation, saying in a
letter that its review ``should examine whether the proposed
business plan of Eastern has any realistic prospect of revitalizing
the carrier.''
   In a separate letter to Skinner, six senators called on the
transportation secretary to ``seek a delay in additional sales that
could further erode the competitive base in the airline industry.''
   The senators specifically cited Eastern's reported plans to sell
its South American routes.
   The senators who wrote to Skinner were Democrats Frank R.
Lautenberg of New Jersey, Wendell H. Ford of Kentucky, Bob Graham of
Florida, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts and Republican Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for death-row convicts blasted a Supreme Court ruling
Monday that allows the execution of murderers who committed their
crimes as young as 16, while prosecutors applauded the decision.
   ``In my opinion, it's utterly barbaric to execute any 16- or
17-year-old,'' said Sapulpa, Okla., attorney Bob Ravitz.
   His client, Sean Sellers, was convicted in 1986 of killing his
parents and a convenience store clerk in Oklahoma City at age 16.
Ravitz argued that his client was under Satan's influence.
   Asked about the decision, Oklahoma Assistant Attorney General Bob
Nance said, ``I think we're pleased from the attorney general on
down.''
   In 5-4 votes, the Supreme Court said the Constitution's ban on
cruel and unusual punishment does not prohibit execution of older
juveniles or adults with only the reasoning capacity of children.
   In a second instance, however, the court ruled that convicted
murderers have a right to demand that sentencing juries and judges
consider mental retardation as a possible mitigating factor.
   The juvenile killers ruling affects about 25 of the 2,200 death
row inmates across the nation.
   There are at least 11 states with one or more inmates under a
death penalty for crimes committed before they were 18, according to
state officials. Texas topped the list with nine inmates, followed
by Alabama and Georgia with four each.
   The Supreme Court apparently drew the line for capital punishment
at age 16 last year when they voted 5-3 to throw out the death
sentence of an Oklahoma murderer who committed the crime when 15.
   The ruling will probably not affect Paula Cooper because she was
15 when she stabbed a retired Gary, Ind., Bible teacher to death,
said her attorney William L. Touchette. Miss Cooper's case has drawn
international attention and a call for clemency from Pope John Paul
II.
   In West Palm Beach, Fla., lawyer James Eisenberg reacted with
sadness to the court's ruling.
   Eisenberg was the trial attorney for Cleo Lecroy, who was
convicted in Florida in the 1981 shooting deaths of a couple camping
in rural Palm Beach County. Lecroy was 17 at the time of the crime.
   ``Even countries such as Russia have recognized that killing
their children is not something that people ought to do, and I'm
sorry that in this country we don't feel the same way, don't have
the respect for our kids' lives,'' Eisenberg said.
   Carolyn Snurkowski, who is in charge of death appeals for Florida
Attorney General Bob Butterworth, said the ruling seemed ``to affirm
the system that we currently employ.''
   In its decision, the high court upheld the death sentence of
Missouri inmate Heath Wilkins, who was 16 when he stabbed a Kansas
City area liquor store clerk to death in 1985.
   Michele Coleman of the Missouri Coalition Against the Death
Penalty called the ruling ``devastating.''
   ``It just gives our state rein to execute children. I can just
hear prosecutors using (the Supreme Court's) ruling in their closing
arguments,'' Ms. Coleman said.
   Missouri Attorney General William Webster called such arguments
``hogwash.''
   ``There's a lot of people that say it's going to open the door.
That's ludicrous,'' said Webster.
   Webster said that before a juvenile can face the death penalty,
he or she has to be certified as an adult, go through a battery of
mental exams and have their age considered as a mitigating
circumstance by the judge.
   But Wilkins' court-appointed attorney, public defender Nancy
McKerrow, said courts decide whether to try a youngster as an adult
according to the seriousness of the crime, not the youngster's
mental nature.
   ``Where are the safeguards?'' McKerrow said. ``They make no
determination of a child's maturity. They're looking at the
seriousness of the crime. Then age becomes irrelevant. The fact that
(Wilkins) was 16 years old made no difference.''

<HEAD>Robin Givens Says Danger Drew Her To Tyson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RADNOR, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Robin Givens says she still loves
ex-husband Mike Tyson, and the thrill of ``danger'' continues to
draw her to the heavyweight boxing champion.
   ``I loved the danger. ... He was exciting,'' said Givens, who
plays Darlene on the ABC show Head of the Class.
   ``And I think that what people don't realize with a certain type
of woman is that there are times when she wants the man she is with
to be ... a man,'' she said in an interview published in the July 1
issue of TV Guide magazine.
   But she said the qualities that attracted her to Tyson went out
of control after they married. There were times, she said, when he
threaten to kill her, on one occasion even placing a pillow over her
head, and there were times when he hit her.
   ``Michael told me that he was going to kill me and that the world
would be grateful because he's made them think that I'm bad,'' she
said.
   Tyson's attorney, Howard Weitzman, said that when he told Tyson
of the comments, the boxer shrugged and said, ``Come on, man.''
   A new biography of Tyson, ``Fire and Fear: The Inside Story of
Mike Tyson,'' describes him as wife-beater who reportedly said that
he never hit an opponent as hard as he hit Givens on one occasion.
   The two were married Feb. 7, 1988, and Givens filed for divorce
in October. The divorce was finalized last month.
   Givens denied that her mother, Ruth Roper, helped manipulate the
boxer's life during the short-lived marriage.
   ``People always say, `Well, why was your mother around?' I had to
beg this woman (to be around). I couldn't do it by myself,'' she
said.
   Also false, she said, is the rumor that she moved to California
shortly before filing divorce papers to take advantage of that
state's community-property laws.
   ``The funny thing is, not only didn't I get a fortune. I didn't
get anything,'' she said.
   Weitzman said, ``That is just false. She came away from the
marriage with seven-figures-plus.''
   He said she also kept numerous gifts Tyson had given her during
the marriage.
   Givens said, ``Somebody was going to have to bend, and neither of
us could. What people don't understand, what they have forgotten in
all this, is: I love Michael.''

<TEXT>
   Police arrested five people
involved in distributing $10 million in bogus U.S. money, capturing
one gang member naked in a bathroom with a pistol, according to a
policeman and a TV network Monday.
   Federal policeman Zildo Heleodoro said $210,000 in counterfeit
bills were recovered in the raid on Saturday in Sao Paulo, 275 miles
southwest of Rio.
   Heleodoro said police felt sure they would recover $9.8 million
more in Rio ``very shortly.''
   TV Globo, Brazil's largest commercial television network,
identified all five arrested as Brazilians. It said police acted on
a tip from U.S. Treasury agents.
   Police were impressed with the quality of the fake bills,
believed to have been made in Leticia, Colombia, on Brazil's
northwestern border, Globo said. It said the four men and one woman
were staying at a hotel near the city center. The network said
police gained admittance to their room by using the knock sequence
employed by callers interested in buying counterfeit bills.
   They arrested four gang members in the room, and then broke down
a locked bathroom door and arrested a naked man armed with a .38
caliber pistol, Globo reported.
   Police believe the gang did business with Brazilians who planned
to travel to the United States, the network reported.

<HEAD>Mayor Returns Home Despite Alleged Threat by City Airport Commissioner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Vincent C. Schoemehl Jr. and his family
returned home under increased police protection after fleeing their
house for 48 hours because of threats allegedly made by the city's
airport commissioner.
   The commissioner, Luther Boykins, faces two misdemeanor counts of
third-degree assault against Schoemehl.
   Boykins allegedly made the threats because of ordinances adopted
last week that sharply curtailed the duties of his ex-wife, city
License Collector Billie A. Boykins.
   The mayor kept up his schedule over the weekend despite the
problems, going to meetings, a high school reunion and a Jefferson
Day rally, aides said. The Schoemehl family returned home Sunday
night.
   ``He felt threatened,'' Deputy Police Chief Ray Lauer said. ``We
were concerned with the mayor's fears. I had no assurance from
(Luther) Boykins that this was over.''
   Schoemehl said police made the decision Friday to increase the
number of his bodyguards from one to four. He also decided to move
his family to a safe place, as he has done in the past during
protests and demonstrations in front of his house.
   Meanwhile, the transfer of most of Billie Boykins' duties to
other municipal agencies began.
   Luther Boykins, whom Schoemehl appointed airport commissioner,
coordinated the mayor's 1985 re-election campaign on the city's
predominantly black north side.
   Schoemehl said Luther Boykins' threat was expressed to aides
Peter Sortino and Nancy Rice ``in a very hostile, very vulgar, very
aggressive way'' after Schoemehl signed ordinances stripping Ms.
Boykins of most of her duties.
   The city aldermen drafted the ordinances on the basis of State
Auditor Margaret Kelly's report that Ms. Boykins had failed to
collect millions of dollars in revenues due the city.
   On Friday, the aldermen voted 16-13 to reduce Ms. Boykins' staff
from 54 employees to three.
   Supporters of Ms. Boykins, who is black, contended that the
ordinances were racially motivated.
   Luther Boykins, who was released from a police holdover cell
shortly before midnight on Friday, could not be reached for comment
on Monday. He said over the weekend he had ``no quarrel'' with
Schoemehl.
   Boykins has a July 6 court date scheduled to answer the
misdemeanor charges.
   Also Monday, the Missouri Court of Appeals refused to grant Ms.
Boykins an injunction that would bar the takeover of her office. Her
appeal followed a circuit judge's rejection of the same request.
   Ms. Boykins also faces a felony-drug charge in Bloomington, Ill.,
that stems from her arrest near there last fall.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, looking
beyond the current wave of arrests and executions, said Monday night
the leaders of China cannot block forever the country's ``rendezvous
with freedom.''
   Baker told 1000 guests at a black-tie dinner of the Asia Society
in New York, ``we will be there to help when the day follows the
night.''
   Baker's theme, in a 25-minute speech to the group, was that a
``new order'' of freedom is emerging in Asia and the Pacific. He
called repression in China and Burma ``rites of passage'' and spoke
philosophically of recent events in Beijing.
   ``We and some other nations have suspended business as usual,''
Baker said. ``But we and the rest of the world must not let our
revulsion at this repression blind us to pressure for reform.''
   He added: ``China has suffered a tragic setback, but the story is
not over.''
   The Asia Society is a private organization dedicated to improving
Americans' understanding of Asian affairs.
   Meanwhile Monday, Chinese authorities told 11 Americans not to
leave Kunming while charges of distributing religious tracts were
investigated. A U.S. official said ``we expect the matter to be
resolved soon.''
   The Americans went to China June 13 despite a warning by the
State Department after soldiers fired on students June 3-4 in
Beijing.
   The Americans being held were believed to be associated with an
evangelical Christian group, the Latter Rain Ministry of Litchfield,
Ill.
   The charges against them were not considered serious under
Chinese law. A U.S. diplomat was on his way from the American
consulate in Chengdu to investigate.
   In the past, Americans who distributed religious tracts have been
fined and asked to leave.
   According to Adam Shub, a State Department spokesman, the 11
Americans, who had planned to return home early next month, were
detained at the Yunnan University guest house and charged with
passing out religious material to the public. Their passports were
taken and they were forbidden to leave the city.
   Laura Templeton, secretary of Latter Rain Ministries Inc. in
Litchfield, said the group was ``99 percent sure'' the members were
in no serious trouble in Kunming.
   ``They weren't scheduled to leave for Hong Kong until next
Tuesday, and I am sure they will be leaving on schedule,'' she said.
   At the White House, President Bush said the United States
intended to ``continue trying to convince the Chinese leadership
that it is in their interest to keep reform moving forward,''
despite the recent bloodshed, said presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater said Bush made the observation during an Oval Office
meeting with Japan's new foreign minister, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka.
   ``The foreign minister said Japan was encouraged by the
president's experience in the region and hoped our two countries
would keep each other informed on our views,'' Fitzwater said in a
statement. Bush was head of the U.S. liaison office in China in
1974-75.
   Mitsuzuka, speaking before Baker at the society dinner, called
China's ``path toward isolation in the international community''
regrettable and appealed to China's new leaders to ``govern in a
spirit of reconcilation and restraint.''
   Earlier, Fitzwater was asked at a White House briefing if Bush
had sent any communication to the new Chinese Communist Party chief,
Jiang Zemin, who replaced the ousted Zhao Ziyang.
   ``I don't believe he has communicated with the new Communist
Party chief,'' Fitzwater said. ``I don't know whether he knows him
or not.''
   Australia' Prime Minister Bob Hawke insisted that he, Bush and
the leaders of Britain and France must walk ``a very difficult
dividing line'' in supporting continued economic reform in China
while denouncing the crackdown on political freedom.
   Hawke, who met with Bush at the presidential retreat in Camp
David, Md., told reporters at the National Press Club, ``We have to
express a position without equivocation of condemnation ... at the
same time make clear (we) want to do what can be done to assist the
processes of economic reform. The interst of the people of China,
and particularly those who are committed to political reform, would
be very adversely affected if by the action of the rest of the world
China was forced to turn completely in upon itself because the
process of economic reform would be diminished and subsequently the
opportunity to political reform.''
   Baker leaves July 3 on a trip to Asia. His speech Monday night
was his first summarizing Bush administration policy on the region.
   ``The post-war era is over,'' he said. ``In Asia, as in Europe, a
new order is taking shape.''
   Baker will stop in Tokyo to help plan multinational economic aid
for the Philippines. Then, in Brunei, he will attend the annual
meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. This is an
economic grouping of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore and Thailand.
   ``The purpose of my trip is to establish the framework for a new
Pacific partnership,'' he told the private group. ``To build that
new partnership we need continued American engagement in the
region's politics, commerce and security.''
   Above all, Baker stressed U.S. ties to Japan.
   He called for ``a more creative sharing of global
responsibilities,'' and praised the Japanese for shouldering more of
the cost of keeping U.S. troops in the country _ about 40 percent.
   And, Baker said, Japan soon will be the largest donor in the
world of overseas development assistance. Yet Mitsuzuka, stressed
the need for America ``to maintain a strong political, economic and
military presence and commitment to the region.''
   Turning to China, Baker concluded the country clearly had decided
to abandon its isolation from regional progress but the pace of
political change did not match the aspirations of the people.
   Defending U.S. policy against calls for sterner measures in
response to the violence, Baker said ``we have acted in a measured
way.''
   He said it would be a mistake to dismantle the relationship the
United States built up over two decades with the Communist
government in Beijing.
   However, Baker said, Americans and the U.S. government will stand
for democratic values. And, he said, ``China's rendezvous with
freedom, like its rendezvous with the advancing nations of the
Pacific. cannot be long delayed.''

<TEXT>
   ``Miami Vice'' star Don Johnson and his
ex-wife, actress Melanie Griffith, were remarried Monday at their
rustic ranch to the strains of a string quartet and the roar of news
helicopters.
   Johnson, 39, wore a white tuxedo and Ms. Griffith, 31, wore a
white lace wedding gown with a train. They were married under a
white, flower-entwined arbor in a non-denominational afternoon
ceremony attended by about 30 close friends and family, publicist
Elliot Mintz said.
   ``She looked beautiful,'' Mintz said. Ms. Griffith is expecting a
child in late September or early October.
   Johnson and Ms. Griffith have one young son each by previous
relationships. The children served as ring-bearers, Mintz said in a
telephone interview.
   He had no immediate word on the couple's honeymoon plans. The
ceremony took place eight miles northwest of Aspen at the couple's
Woody Creek Ranch. They also have homes in Los Angeles and Miami.
   Ms. Griffith was nominated for an Academy Award for her work in
last year's film ``Working Girl.''
   Johnson had hired eight deputies from the Pitkin County Sheriff's
Department as security for the ceremony, but could not stop news
helicopters from buzzing the red ranch home.
   ``If it was my house, I would have had a complaint, I'll tell you
that,'' said Clifford ``Skitch'' Rounsefell of the sheriff's
department, who supervised security.
   He said a few people _ apparently fans _ were discovered Sunday,
crawling up the irrigation ditch leading from an adjoining ranch
onto Johnson's land. They were caught and ordered away.
   Johnson and Ms. Griffith were married in 1976 and divorced less
than two years later. She also is divorced from actor Steven Bauer.

<HEAD>EEC Draft Statement Calls For Freeze On Loans To China</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-China, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   EEC leaders are ready to recommend that the
World Bank and other financial institutions suspend loans to China
following the military crushing of pro-democracy protests there,
Spain's foreign minister said Monday.
   Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez said the recommendation was
included in a statement drafted by EEC foreign ministers. The summit
was expected to approve the statement Tuesday.
   Spain is current president of the 12-member European Economic
Community, which was meeting in the Spanish capital.
   Ordonez said besides suspending loans to China, the document
called for:
   _Suspension of military aid and arms sales to China.
   _A freeze on visits to China by high-level EEC officials.
   _No new development aid projects in China and a freeze on
existing projects.
   _Discussion of human rights abuses in China in the proper world
forums.
   _Authorization for independent observers to attend the trials of
purported agitators in China and to visit prisons where they are
being held.
   _Indefinite extension of visas held by Chinese students in EEC
countries.
   _Limiting cultural exchanges.
   In response to the Chinese army's clearing out protesters in
Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on June 3-4, President Bush
suspended military aid and contacts with China on June 6. He later
said Washington would withold its support of international loans to
Beijing and banned visits to China by senior administration
officials.
   Fernandez Ordonez said the ministers also drew up a declaration
on the Middle East, the first by European heads of government since
a statement issued in Venice in 1980.
   He said the declaration included a statement that the Palestine
Liberation Organization should take part in any Mideast peace
conference. It supported Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
proposal for elections in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, provided the vote is a step toward definitive solution of the
Israeli-Palestine conflict.

   First Lady Barbara Bush sprang to the defense
Monday night of her springer spaniel Millie, branded ``ugly'' by a
Washington magazine.
   ``Millie has been slow about writing her book, but this is going
to bring her to action,'' Mrs. Bush told reporters outside the White
House after returning with President Bush from a parade at the
Marine Barracks.
   What got the firt lady's pique was an item in Washingtonian
magazine, in its annual best-and-worst rankings of capital doings,
that accorded Millie the dubious honor of ``best'' ugly dog.
   The magazine said the White House canine has not bitten the
president yet, ``but let's face it: This is a very homely springer
spaniel.''
   If Millie harbors literary ambitions, she will be the second
straight Bush dog to achieve authordom.
   Mrs. Bush was the ghostwriter of her previous pet's
autobiography, ``C. Fred's Story,'' to raise funds for charity.

   Mayor Kathy Whitmire announced Monday she is
seeking a record-tying fifth consecutive term and will ask voters to
compare her with her main challenger, who held the job in the
mid-1970s.
   ``I am very proud to be your mayor today and when the voters go
to the poll this November, I'm going to ask them to compare the
records and elect the better mayor for Houston,'' she said to a loud
applause from about 350 supporters at a downtown hotel.
   Mrs. Whitmire said if elected she would make battling the drug
problem in Houston a top priority.
   ``The drug epidemic that has swept this nation is the most
serious threat that our city faces today,'' the mayor said.
   Fred Hofheinz, who won two-year terms in 1973 and 1975, announced
his candidacy in March. Mrs. Whitmire's entry brings the number of
candidates in the Nov. 7 non-partisan field to at least five. Also
running are Rosie Walker, publisher of Houston Downtown Magazine;
Shelby Oringderff, a retired Houston schoolteacher, and Hispanic
leader James Galvan.
   For Mrs. Whitmire, 42, the race marks the second time she will
face a former mayor. In 1985, she trounced Louie Welch, whose
mayoral longevity mark she is trying to match. Two years ago, she
won her fourth term against token opposition.

   An explosion aboard a train in the suburbs of
Shanghai killed 20 people and seriously injured 11, an offical
reported Tuesday.
   The official Xinhua News Agency reported that an on-the-spot
investigation showed the explosion was caused by dynamite.
   The official of the Shanghai Foreign Affairs Office called it an
accident and said the blast happened at 11.13 p.m. Monday (10:13
a.m. EDT) in Songjiang county, 18{ miles southwest of the city.
   He said the No. 364 train was on its way to Shanghai from
Hangzhou, 112 miles to the southwest. It was scheduled to reach
Shanghai at 00:08 a.m. Tuesday.
   He said the blast occurred in the No. 7 seated compartment of the
train but could not give details.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, reported that
20 people died, 11 were badly hurt and an unknown number of
passengers were slightly injured.
   He was unable to give the capacity of the train or the
compartment.
   According to Japan's Kyodo News Service, the explosion occurred
in a toilet in the front of the compartment. The Japanese NHK
television station reported that the interior of the train was
severely damaged but not burned.
   Xinhua said the vice mayor of Shanghai, Ni Tianzeng, had arrived
at the scene to organize rescue work.
   Six people died in Shanghai when a train smashed through a
barricade set up by demonstators pressing for democratic reform this
month. Three youths who were accused of later setting fire to the
train were convicted and executed two weeks later.
   Last March, brake failure caused the collision of two trains in
Shanghai, killing 28 people. Among them were 27 members of a
Japanese high school tour group.

<HEAD>Peruvian Army Patrol Kills 42 Guerrillas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AYACUCHO, PERU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An army patrol battled leftist rebels at
their remote highland stronghold and killed 42 of them in some of
the worst fighting in the rebels' nine-year insurgency, a military
official said Monday.
   The military refused to provide information on army casualties.
   The troops and Shining Path rebels fought Sunday evening near the
village of Pampaccori, 40 miles northeast of Ayacucho, a military
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   The military spokesman said troops also captured a large number
of weapons and ``subversive propaganda.''
   He said it was one of the biggest losses of life suffered by the
Shining Path in their nine-year-old fight against the government.
   The Ayacucho region, 235 miles southeast of Lima, is the
birthplace of the Shining Path insurgency and remains its stronghold.
   The guerrilla organization began its fight against the government
in May 1980 after 10 years of grass roots organizing among Indian
peasants in this impoverished region.
   Since then the violence has spread throughout the country, and
more than 15,000 people have died in clashes between troops and
guerrillas, as well as in rebel attacks.
   There has been a recent surge in rebel activity, and analysts say
the stepped-up attacks are intended to sabotage municipal elections
in November.
   In violence Monday, two policemen were killed and four were
missing after 50 Shining Path guerrillas Monday ambushed a truck
carrying six policemen in a mining province in the highlands, police
said.
   The guerrillas hurled sticks of dynamite and opened fire with
machine guns during the ambush, which occurred close to a
copper-mining complex near Huancayo, 140 miles east of Lima, police
said.
   Last week Shining Path rebels ambushed an army convoy in the
Amazon jungle near Aguaytia, 270 miles northeast of Lima, and 20
rebels and 15 soldiers were killed in the fighting.

   Demonstrators shot while resisting the army's
drive to crush seven weeks of pro-democracy protests ``got what they
deserved,'' a senior military officer said Monday.
   In another development, an explosion aboard a train late Monday
killed 20 people and seriously injured 11 in the suburbs of
Shanghai, an offical of the Shanghai Foreign Affairs Office reported.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said an on-the-spot investigation
showed the explosion was caused by dynamite. The Shanghai official
on Tuesday called it an accident and said it happened at 11.13 p.m.
Monday in Songjiang county, 18{ miles southwest of Shanghai.
   He said the train was bound from Hangzhou to Shanghai and that
the explosion occurred in a seated compartment less than an hour
before it was scheduled to reach its destination, but that he had no
further details.
   He said an undetermined unknown number of passengers also were
slightly injured.
   Japan's Kyodo News Service said the explosion occurred in a
toilet.
   On the political scene on Monday, the official press said the
Communist Party was prepared to expel members who participated in
the student-led movement for a freer China, suggesting a full-scale
purge following Saturday's announcement that moderate party chief
Zhao Ziyang had been ousted from his party posts.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said two Americans _ a teacher and a
student at Nankai University in nearby Tianjin _ were ordered to
leave China by Friday.
   Teacher Mark Radicia and student Helen Qubain were being expelled
because ``evidently they were very involved in the student
movement,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The two,
whose ages and hometowns were not available, were questioned by
security forces, he said.
   A U.S. official said Monday in Washington that a group of 11
Americans who went to China against State Department travel advice
were charged by police in Kunming with distributing religious
literature and ordered to remain in the city.
   The Americans' names and hometowns were not disclosed. The
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a U.S. diplomat
was bound for Kunming from Chengdu to look into the situation. He
said the charge evidently was not a serious offense.
   Li Zhiyun, one of the commanders of the June 3-4 military assault
on Beijing, said he had ``no regrets'' about what Chinese and
foreign witnesses have said was a massacre of unarmed residents and
students.
   Li, speaking to foreign reporters invited to tour Tiananmen
Square, stressed the government line that no shots were fired at
students during the assault to remove thousands of student activists
from the square.
   ``The whole process was non-violent. No one used guns,'' he said.
   Li said troops shot into the air once, when ``thugs'' occupying a
building to the southeast of the square opened fire, wounding one
soldier.
   He acknowledged some innocent people ``may have been wounded''
when troops fought to reach the square, but said people were warned
not to go out that night.
   ``When our troops moved to the square we received persistent
resistance,'' Li said. ``Individuals even used guns to kill our
warriors. We were forced to defend ourselves. This group of people
got what they deserved.''
   The government puts the death toll from the assault at about 300
and says most were soldiers who were attacked by mobs. Chinese
witnesses and Western intelligence reports say up to 3,000 people
were shot to death or crushed by tanks as the military stormed the
city.
   During a tour of the square, he said black burn patches on the
pavement were caused by students who set fire to tents to stop the
troop advance. He called stories that troops had burned the bodies
of students were ``totally untrue.''
   The monument was decorated with banners reading ``carry on the
will of the revolutionary martyrs'' _ a reference to soldiers killed
during the attack _ and ``promote the glorious traditions of the
troops.''
   Bushes and grass around the monument had been replanted, and
newly planted flowers bloomed in boxes between the monument and the
mausoleum where Mao Tse-tung's body lies in state.
   Li said the troops ``returned the square to the people'' but
could not say when it would be reopened to the public. He said armed
``thugs'' were at large.
   About 1,800 people, including up to 500 in Beijing, have been
arrested nationwide since the crackdown in Beijing prompted
widespread disturbances.
   The party Central Committee on Saturday announced that Zhao, a
pioneer of China's past decade of economic reform, was stripped of
all party posts for ``supporting the turmoils and splitting the
party.''
   Shanghai's Wen Hui Bao daily newspaper said 14 members of the
``Wild Geese Suicide Squad,'' one of many groups of young workers
who joined street protests, were sentenced to up to 13 years for
slashing car tires, beating drivers and blocking traffic. The report
was seen in Beijing on Monday.

   A report today that federal officials are
underestimating the spread of AIDS raises questions about the
nation's ability to cope with the crisis, say congressmen who are
monitoring the epidemic.
   A General Accounting Office report says the number of AIDS cases
expected to be diagnosed over the next three years has been
undercounted by as much as one-third by the Centers for Disease
Control.
   ``The really frightening aspect of this report is it proves how
little we know about the AIDS epidemic,'' Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.,
said Sunday. He and Reps. John Dingell, D-Mich., and Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., requested the study.
   ``When these projections of AIDS cases go awry, it undermines
research, destroys the validity of our plans for taking care of AIDS
victims and conveys a false sense of confidence to our fellow
citizens that the AIDS epidemic is under control,'' Wyden said.

   Baseball great Pete Rose said commissioner A.
Bartlett Giamatti wasn't playing fair. And a judge agreed.
   Judge Norbert Nadel on Sunday delayed for two weeks today's
scheduled hearing by the commissioner into gambling allegations
against the Cincinnati Reds manager. The judge said the results of
the hearing, which could mean a lifetime ban from baseball for the
game's all-time hits leader, had become ``a foregone conclusion.''
   ``I think we got justice,'' said Rose's attorney, Reuven Katz.
   ``I'm just pleased that we get the next opportunity,'' Rose said
after his team lost 7-0 to Los Angeles. ``Obviously we're pleased
about this. That's it. Next things next.''
   Giamatti said he regretted the judge's decision. ``I have
absolutely no prejudgment or prejudice regarding Pete Rose,'' he
said.

   Threatening to lock up adults who don't
lock up guns sends a strong message, but police and prosecutors
question whether a first-of-its kind bill approved in Florida will
prevent accidental shootings.
   ``We do feel there will be some difficulty in enforcement since
it will take a child committing some dreadful act before law
enforcement becomes aware that he or she had access to a weapon,''
said Tom Berlinger, director of operations for the Florida Sheriff's
Association.
   Monroe County State Attorney Kurt Zuelch, president of the
Florida Prosecuting Attorneys Association, also expressed concern
that ``the prevention issue hasn't been totally dealt with.''
   Accidental shootings that killed three children since June 5
prompted the Legislature to pass the bill during a special session
Tuesday. Gov. Bob Martinez is expected to sign the measure into law
this week.

   Authorities proclaimed today that all of China
backed the ouster of top Communist Party moderates, and suggested
the purge of party members who sympathized with the pro-democracy
movement could expand.
   The tightly controlled media stepped up a propaganda blitz
encouraging support for the ruling Communists' decision to relieve
party head Zhao Ziyang of all his party posts for ``supporting the
turmoils and splitting the party.''
   The leadership shakeup, announced Saturday, replaced the
69-year-old Zhao with Shanghai party secretary Jiang Zemin, 62, a
proponent of economic reforms who supports the current hard line
that dissent must be dealt with harshly.
   Zhao is believed to have been stripped of power in mid-May for
refusing to endorse plans by Premier Li Peng and senior leader Deng
Xiaoping to declare martial law in Beijing and have the army clear
central Tiananmen Square of student pro-democracy protesters.

   Senators facing re-election in 1990 have cut
down on privately financed travel that sometimes takes them to
pricey resorts, according to a study of financial disclosures.
   The group, comprising almost a third of the Senate, took 179
privately financed trips in 1988 compared with 223 in 1987.
   Such travel _ usually paid for by corporate and trade
associations _ has been severely criticized this year by members of
Congress and private organizations.
   The Associated Press study of 33 senators was based on travel
statistics compiled on the full Senate by Congress Watch, an
organization founded by consumer advocate Ralph Nader that culled
the data from 1988 Senate financial disclosure reports filed last
month.

   Don't expect to read about Fairport Convention in
``The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll'' _ they're
not even mentioned.
   And don't look for Fairport Convention in ``The Billboard Book of
Top 40 Hits'' _ they never had a hit single.
   While reunions of The Rolling Stones and The Who make headlines,
Fairport Convention quietly tours the country by trailer, appearing
in small clubs.
   But since four (soon to be six) young English musicians formed
the band in 1967, Fairport Convention has produced some of the
finest folk-rock of the past two decades.
   ``If you're asking whether I thought the band would still be
traveling about in the late 1980s, the answer would be no,'' said
guitarist Simon Nicol, an original member who helped put Fairport
Convention back together in 1985.
   Their early records were heavily influenced by the Beatles and
the Byrds, with spirited harmonies and a tight rhythm section.
Besides Nicol, the group featured the brilliant guitar playing and
songwriting of Richard Thompson, and the songwriting and soulful
vocals of Sandy Denny.
   ``You had a band at the end of every street, and for most people
it was a phase they went through,'' Nicol recalled. ``The unlucky
ones got caught on the treadmill. We wanted to get off the
treadmill.''
   By their fourth album, 1969's ``Liege and Lief,'' Fairport
Convention was recording traditional English songs and making
greater use of the mandolin and fiddle, instruments that had been
rarely used in a rock 'n' roll format.
   They built a small, but devoted following with the originals
``Come All Ye'' and ``Meet on the Ledge,'' the traditional ``Matty
Groves'' and covers of Bob Dylan's ``I'll Keep It With Mine'' and
``Percy's Song.''
   ``I think that the Byrds had taken their roots and made it viable
encouraged us,'' Nicol said of the American folk-rock group.
   The group went through several personnel changes and by the early
'70s, Thompson and Denny had left to pursue solo careers. The band
struggled without them, eventually calling it quits in 1979.
   But in August 1980, Fairport Convention _ minus Denny, who died
in 1978 _ reunited for a concert in Cropredy, England. Encouraged by
the response, the band played again the following summer and now
headlines an annual two-day festival of folk-rock and traditional
music.
   They began recording again in 1985, with Nicol and two other
Fairport Convention veterans _ bassist Dave Pegg and drummer Dave
Mattacks _ forming the core of the group. Thompson was well
established as a solo star so guitarist Martin Allcock and fiddler
Ric Sanders were recruited.
   ``The three of us had gotten on terribly well,'' Nicol said.
``We'd known Martin for years, he was very enthusiastic and really
wanted to play with us. Ric was also a fan. We rehearsed three days
and found out it was going to work.''
   They have since released four albums: ``Gladys' Leap,''
``Expletive Delighted,'' ``In Real Time'' and, most recently, ``Red
and Gold.'' Fairport Convention has also toured extensively, using
mostly new material as well as ``Matty Groves'' and ``Meet on the
Ledge.''
   ``It's impossible to say what a typical Fairport audience is
because they all look different,'' Pegg said. ``We get 17- and
18-year-old kids who have discovered the music for the first time
and people in their 50s. A lot of our audience are more familiar
with the new stuff.''
   The title track from ``Red and Gold'' was written by Ralph
McTell, a friend of the band who learned that Cropredy had been the
site in 1644 of a bloody battle during the English civil war.
   The album also includes a cover of ``Open the Door Richard''; a
pair of instrumentals written by Sanders, ``The Rose Hip'' and ``The
Battle''; and a traditional ballad, ``The Beggar's Song.''
   ``It's just surprising when you come up with traditional songs
that people haven't heard before,'' Pegg said. ``The best ones have
been recorded, if not by us, then by other bands like Steeleye Span.
They got about 50 percent of the really good songs and we got the
rest.''

<HEAD>Robb Weller Is the Answer Man on ABC's `Home'</HEAD>

   Want to know what smoked rattlesnake tastes
like? How to lower your cholesterol level? How to patch wallpaper?
Robb Weller is your man.
   Weller is co-host of ABC's ``Home,'' a daytime forum for ideas,
suggestions and hints that can be applied to viewers' lives.
   ``I'm probably a lot healthier than I was because `Home' has
changed my eating habits,'' said Weller. ``The only problem with
being the host of a show like this is you turn into a pain in the
neck to your friends. Instead of talking in sentences, you talk in
household hints. You go to a friend's house and tell him how to make
a quick fix on torn wallpaper with toothpaste or fill a nail hole
with paint mixed with a little cornstarch.
   ``On the show, I might talk about the benefits of rock garlic.
I've eaten everything they bring on the show to make people healthy,
from raw nasturtiums to smoked rattlesnake. It tastes like smoked
chicken. In fact, everything tastes like smoked chicken except
smoked chicken, which tastes like fajita.''
   Weller is quick to add, however, that you shouldn't get the idea
that ``Home'' is all household hints.
   ``It's so versatile that it's difficult to talk about,'' he said.
``It's not like `Oprah' or `Donahue,' with one host and one topic
each day. There are seven aspects of `Home' each day. It can be
hints, cooking, medicine, emotional help, home decoration, or a wide
variety of things.''
   Weller, who is also co-anchor of the syndicated ``Entertainment
This Week,'' has been the host of ``Home'' since its debut last
year. The show has a rotating system of co-hosts who appear with
Weller.
   In addition, ``Home'' also has a staff of experts on such topics
as home decorating, arts and crafts, food, carpentry, leisure and
recreation, money-saving tips, car repair, home repair, picking
movies for children and human-interest stories.
   ``This is a research-driven show,'' said Weller. ``Viewers
contribute an enormous amount to the show. They make suggestions and
tell us who they want to see on the show. We have a program that's
not particularly high in the ratings but attracts a lot of women in
the 18-49 age category. We get 35,000 requests a week for our
newsletter, which costs $1.''
   Weller grew up in Tacoma, Wash., and attended the University of
Washington. He was a yell leader at athletic events and is credited
with creating ``The Wave,'' the crowd ripple that has become a
fixture at sporting events.
   He began his television career in Seattle and later worked in
Columbus, Ohio, for Qube, a cable company that had two-way
communications with its viewers.
   ``I was host of a live talk show in Columbus and whatever
happened, happened,'' he said. ``Once we had a chicken-flying
contest. One chicken flew right into the lighting board. Zap! So,
what do you do? We had no commercials, so I threw it to the band.
   ``We were doing `Fernwood 2Night' for real. It was a lot of fun.
I was 27 years old and it was my first big, steady gig in
television. I wouldn't move to Columbus unless I earned my age. We
fought and fought and I finally got $27,000 a year.''
   He and Leeza Gibbons were co-hosts of ``Two on the Town'' at WCBS
in New York when they were both summoned to Los Angeles by
``Entertainment Tonight.'' Weller was co-anchor of ``Entertainment
Tonight'' for two years, and he and Gibbons are co-anchors of the
weekend version.
   Weller and his wife, Barbara, a former entertainment editor for
the Chicago Sun-Times, have an 11-month-old daughter, Lindsay.
``We're homebodies,'' he said. ``We don't go to gala openings or
Hollywood parties. When we go to the movies, we go to a neighborhood
theater.
   ``My wife's biggest problem with me is getting me out of the yard
on weekends. I love to putter. I find great solace in that after a
week of 12-hour days. I have to be at work on `Home' at five in the
morning.''
   He and his wife are also involved in projects of their own, such
as a video workout for overweight women called ``Women at Large,''
and plans for a half-hour cable show expanding on the video.

   In her small laboratory, Maritza Vela
Garzon gently opens a 400-year-old book as if it were a jewel case.
   The red and black Gothic type reveals a breathtaking antiquity _
and a tragic carelessness: there are thumb-sized holes in the first
few pages.
   ``Someone put Scotch tape on these pages,'' she said. ``They
thought they were doing the right thing, keeping a tear from
worsening.''
   The glue from the tape eventually ate through the old paper.
   Mrs. Vela Garzon, the Colombian National Library's only staff
expert in book preservation and restoration, hopes to repair the
damage. It's a painstaking task.
   And a frustrating one.
   Among the library's 28,000 old and rare books are entire Jesuit
libraries seized in the late 1700s by the Spaniards. About 40
volumes date back to before the invention of moveable type in 1500.
The oldest, printed in 1480, is by St. Thomas of Aquinas. Many were
printed or illustrated by hand.
   They beg for attention.
   ``It's not a question of negligence,'' the library's director,
Ruben Sierra, explained in an interview. ``It's simply a lack of
money.''
   The same refrain can be heard across financially strapped Latin
America, where governments struggling with big foreign debts,
grinding poverty and other urgent economic and social problems have
little time or money for cultural preservation.
   Sierra said he's heard stories from state librarians of much
worse situations in other countries. One national library's shelves
are full of cats, he said, because it's the only affordable way they
can deal with the rats.
   Indeed, compared with most neighboring countries Colombia enjoys
a thriving economy and a low inflation rate, running at about 25
percent a year. But its $20 billion-debt is still burdensome, and a
program of relative public austerity has been in effect for years.
   ``They promised us some money, but it didn't come,'' Sierra said.
``There's always something else that takes precedence. Last year it
was emergency flood aid for the coast, this year who knows what it
will be.''
   Sierra said he expects to receive about 30 million pesos, the
equivalent of about $80,000 this year to run the 900,000-volume
library. It is less than half what the library asked for.
   Nonetheless, he is hopeful the government will come up with an
extra 200 million pesos (about $540,000) next year for creating a
respectable conservation and restoration center.
   Mrs. Vela Garzon works alone in her small lab, crowded with
equipment, much of it donated by the Organization of American
States. She has one small chest for fumigating the several hundred
old books infected with mold, a few dozen at a time.
   ``This is the first step. There is much left to do,'' she said.
   ``For right now, we can only take care of the most valuable, or
those that most urgently need attention.''
   The library was created in the 1770s, when Colombia was still a
colony of Spain. Authorities needed a place to shelter thousands of
leather-bound volumes confiscated from Jeusit colleges and missions
when the Roman Catholic clerical order was expelled from the Spanish
kingdom.
   All of the rare volumes have been catalogued; not so in the rest
of the library. Boxes holding some 40,000 books are piled high in
the cellar, awaiting revision. No one's sure when they arrived, or
exactly what they hold.
   According to Sierra, a predecessor solved a similar problem in
1972 by simply selling 15,000 books as scrap to a local paper
company.
   ``It was a barbarous act,'' he said. But he added that some of
the books were salvaged, including historically important records.

   For the past several years, South
Africa's hulking, pug-nosed armored cars called Casspirs have run
the roads and plowed the bush of Ovamboland in the search for
guerrillas of the South-West African People's Organization (SWAPO).
   To the South Africans, who invented it, the 11-ton vehicle, with
its heavy firepower and sturdy protection against landmines, it is
the ultimate weapon for counter-insurgency warfare.
   To the local people, the Casspir is the embodiment of evil. They
largely support SWAPO and they look upon the South Africans an an
army of occupation.
   Now, with the 23-year bush war supposedly at an end and Namibia
preparing for independence from South Africa under United Nations
supervision, a change of image may be in store for what one bumper
sticker seen here calls ``Casspir _ an unfriendly ghost.''
   U.N. police monitors assigned to watch the local security forces
and report abuses of authority during the election campaign are
preparing to acquire at least 10 Casspirs for their own use.
   In U.N. livery _ white paint with big black ``U.N.'' letters on
the side _ the armored cars will no longer instill the fear that
many people say they felt whenever the army or police roared past,
turrets bristling with machine guns.
   Although various versions of the Casspir have been employed by
regular and paramilitary forces in Ovamboland, it's fearsome
reputation stems mainly from the Koevoet, the counter-insurgency
police made up of local black officers led by white South Africans.
   Koevoet _ the names mean ``crowbar'' in Afrikaans _ is notorious
for tough and often brutal tactics in prying out the SWAPO
guerrillas infiltrating across the border from Angola.
   Local people tell of terrorist raids, beatings and crop
destructions in Koevoet's campaign to crush SWAPO, and a few Koevoet
members have been charged with murder.
   Some of Koevoet's Casspirs, actually a more powerful version
called the Wolf Turbo, have been earmarked for the U.N. police
monitors operating out of Oshakati, the nerve center for U.N.
operations in the region.
   Peter Fitzgerald, a silver-haired Irishman on leave from his post
as a Dublin police superintendent to serve as district commander of
the U.N. contingent, calls the Casspirs ``absolutely the most
intimidating articles I have ever seen in my life.''
   He said it was necessary, however, for the U.N. Transition
Assistance Group to have its own Casspirs in order to keep track of
the local police, who continue to use them on bush patrols of up to
seven days at a time. Unlike the police, the UNTAG vehicles will
have no weapons on board.
   Under U.N. Resolution 435, which spells out procedures for
Namibia's independence by early next year, Koevoet has already been
integrated into the South-West African Police. However, the unit
remains active and reports persist of Koevoet members continuing to
badger residents who express pro-SWAPO sympathies.
   U.N. officials at the operational level say proof of police abuse
is hard to obtain, and UNTAG recently moved to double to 1,000 the
number of monitors assigned as police watchdogs.
   The sight of numerous police Casspirs in recent days with their
50-caliber machine guns still mounted also indicates that the police
forces have not fully complied with a U.N. proviso for disarming the
vehicles.
   Fred Eckhard, a U.N. spokesman, said it was understood that the
police would carry only small arms. While not clearly defined, he
said, this was generally taken to mean nothing more than sidearms
and semi-automatic rifles. Mounted machine guns would violate that
understanding, he said.
   Many South Africans see the Casspir as the proudest achievement
of a home-grown arms industry springing out of a 1972 arms import
embargo, imposed by the United Nations in response to the South
African government's refusal to abandon apartheid.
   Military sources say that despite the embargo, South Africa now
manufactures 95 percent of its own weapons and has become the
world's 10th largest arms exporter, with customers in 32 countries.
   Casspirs have reportedly been put on display at international
arms shows.
   The name Casspir is an acronym derived from the vehicles'
designers, the Council for Scientific Research, and the South
African Police, for whom it was originally developed. Different
versions are tailored for a specific task, carrying infantry into
battle or urban riot control.
   Its most innovative feature is a heavily armored, V-shaped
underbody designed to deflect, rather than absorb, the blast of a
land mine.
   While SWAPO has periodically claimed to have damaged or destroyed
the vehicles in the bush war, South African military sources say
Casspirs that hit SWAPO-laid mines suffered only minor crew injuries
and damage that was easily repaired.

   Seniority isn't what it used to be.
   Once the coin of congressional status, it was devalued by reform.
There are new status symbols, including the personal political
action committee, a growing practice that is now the target o new
reform proposals.
   By setting up a committee, a member of the House or Senate can
collect campaign funds and dole them out as contributions to other
members or to candidates who, presumably, will not forget the favor.
   They are called ``leadership PACs,'' and there are about 50 of
them. They do seem to be a mark of success. Among them are the
political action committees of the three newly-installed leaders of
the Democratic majority and the two top men in the Republican
minority.
   Ross K. Baker, a Rutgers University political scientist, says in
a study published by the Twentieth Century Fund that the number of
leadership PACs funneling contributions from one member of Congress
to another is likely to grow.
   ``PACs seem to offer members a kind of prestige,'' he says. ``To
have a PAC is, for some, a mark of their sovereignty in a Congress
whose 535 members act increasingly like independent entrepreneurs.''
   A personal PAC also can be used to finance the political travels
of the member who sets it up, enabling a senator or representative
to appear at events around the country _ a vital opening phase of a
presidential campaign.
   Baker concentrates reform suggestions on the use of PACs by
members of Congress to extend their influence with other members. He
dates the rise in the use of campaign donations to influence
inside-the-House competition from the fall of the system under which
committee chairmen were chosen strictly by seniority. That change
made chairmanships subject to secret ballots in the majority party
caucus.
   Political action committees of all varieties are big business.
They also are a favorite target of reformers who see them as
vehicles for special interest money and influence. Their support
goes heavily to incumbents. They can give a candidate up to $5,000
an election; individuals are limited to $1,000.
   They are an unintended byproduct of the campaign reforms that
followed the Watergate scandal. President Bush has proposed
legislation that would ban contributions by political action
committees, effectively eliminating them because they have no other
purpose.
   Labor, business and interest group PACs _ 4,268 of them _ paid
out $148,085,016 in campaign contributions in 1988. While the
leadership PACs represent only a fraction of that, Baker said their
influence is significant, in part because of their sponsorship. So,
too, he said, is their impact on the inside politics of Congress, on
contests for committee chairmanships and on leadership elections.
   Baker cites the in-House campaign of Rep. William H. Gray III of
Pennsylvania, now the Democratic whip, for his previous rung on the
leadership ladder as chairman of the Democratic caucus.
   Gray wasn't shy about using campaign contributions to his
colleagues to gain support in that three-way contest. He set up his
own PAC, the Committee for Democratic Opportunity, and sent out a
request for contributions to be relayed to other House Democrats.
   Baker's study recounts Gray's request for checks for ``$500 or
$1,000 so that I can begin to build the active support within the
Democratic members of Congress to win this key leadership position.''
   The Gray committee made about $140,000 in campaign contributions
to 95 candidates during the 1988 election season, according to the
Federal Elections Commission. Speaker Thomas S. Foley's PAC, the
House Leadership Fund, contributed more than $134,500 to 74 other
Democrats. The Effective Government Committee, the PAC set up by
Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., now majority leader, spent
$222,000, most of it on his unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic
presidential nomination. His PAC gave $24,000 to eight other
candidates.
   While those party leaders have their own committees, Baker's
study suggests that their leadership tasks may be made more
difficult by the proliferation of leadership PACs.
   ``The greater the number of important players armed with their
own checkbooks, the harder the job of party leaders as they try to
manage the delicate and often frustrating task of building
parliamentary majorities,'' he says. ``The result is an increasing
fragmentation of power and decreasing importance of parties, the
basis of our form of democracy.
   ``PACs not only post a threat to the traditional structure of our
government, they also contribute to the growing perception of a
political system run by money _ a system that is, if not corrupt,
corruptible,'' Baker says.

<HEAD>Little Grassroots Outcry Over Canada's Austerity Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost every day a small group shows up on
Parliament Hill to protest Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's austerity
budget, but they have yet to set off nationwide outcries against
belt-tightening and higher taxes.
   Mulroney's government drew up the austerity budget as a means of
controlling Canada's budget deficit, and austerity may be the tone
he is setting at least for the start of his second term.
   Mulroney led his Progressive Conservative Party to a second
consecutive majority government last fall in an election whose
overwhelming issue was approval of the free trade agreement with the
United States.
   His victory cleared the way for the pact to take effect Jan. 1 as
scheduled.
   However, his critics charge that since the trade agreement was
the key issue in the campaign the election outcome did not give
Mulroney a mandate to tackle the budget deficit at the expense of
programs that the Canadian government traditionally has supported.
   Although the Canadian public has remained largely silent, a
Gallup poll published June 15 indicated that only 30 percent of
Canadians would vote now for Mulroney, compared to 45 percent for
the opposition Liberal Party led by John Turner. It was the
Progressive Conservatives' worst showing in that opinion poll since
November 1987.
   But the prime minister has little to worry about for now.
   He is at least three years away from having to call another
election and early in his term is an ideal time to put unpopular
programs into place.
   Several factors appear to be working in Mulroney's favor to
defuse any public indignation at what once would have been
unthinkable changes in government programs such as unemployment
insurance.
   Both major opposition parties are involved in internal races of
their own, because their longtime leaders have announced they are
stepping down.
   The Liberals won't pick a new leader until June 1990, although
Turner is staying on in the interim and spearheading his party's
criticism of the budget.
   The socialist New Democratic Party, which scored 21 percent in
the June Gallup poll, will pick a new leader to replace veteran Ed
Broadbent at the outset of winter.
   Mulroney and his supporters also started immediately after the
November election to lay the groundwork for the plans to bring the
deficit under control.
   ``The alternative is to keep this mountain of debt growing and
place it on the backs of your kids and grandchildren,'' Mulroney
told Canadians.
   What brought more public furor was a leak of the budget the night
before it was to be released April 27, a violation of traditional
Canadian secrecy about the document until it is officially reported
in Parliament.
   The debate about the leak lasted weeks and, as political
columnist Carol Goar wrote in the Toronto Star, it ``kept the
nation's mind off one of the most painful and pivotal budgets in
recent history.''
   In the meantime, analysts say they have found that as little as
one fifth of the savings in the budget intended for deficit control
come from spending restraints. The rest comes from increasing taxes.
   A survey by the private Global Economics consulting firm found
that tax increases amounted to nearly 7.2 billion Canadian dollars
($6 billion) of the 9 million dollars ($7.5 billion) that could be
considered deficit control measures.
   Lloyd Axworthy, one of the most prominent Liberal members in
Parliament, said much of the impact of the prime minister's budget
has been camouflaged.
   ``There's going to be a delayed reaction,'' he maintained in an
interview. ``I don't think they're out of the woods on the budget at
all; it's like a perpetual toothache.''
   Despite the raised taxes and cut expenses, a deficit for 1989-90
remains of 30.5 billion Canadian dollars ($25.3 billion). That has
prompted Mulroney's supporters in the business community to charge
that he has not moved strongly enough to bring the deficit under
control.
   The ratio of debt to gross domestic product is about 5 percent,
double that of the United States and second only to Italy among the
leading industrial nations.

<HEAD>Arrest of Women Focuses Attention on Illegal Abortions in Mexico</HEAD>

   Abortion is a secret act in Mexico. Federal
law makes it a crime, except in cases of rape or if the woman's life
is endangered. The Roman Catholic church calls all abortions a sin.
   Yet Mexican health officials estimate that one in 10 pregnancies
end that way every year. The estimate may be low.
   The last time an attempt was made to change the law, in 1979,
pro-abortion lawmakers were beaten in the streets. Their photographs
appeared on posters calling them ``assassins.'' Marchers denounced
them as ``communists.''
   But pro-abortion activists are ready to make another try, and
anti-abortion activists are girding for battle.
   ``There is pressure by a lot of leftist groups to legalize
abortion,'' said Jorge Serrano Limon, leader of the Pro-Life
organization. ``But we are ready to fight this dangerous movement.''
   The pro-choice side has been encouraged by news and other
accounts of the arrest, interrogation and alleged mistreatment of
eight women after they had abortions. They are also watching closely
the abortion debate in the United States.
   The arrests took place March 16, when Teresa Suarez and nine
other women were returning to Mexico City from an illegal abortion
clinic in the adjacent state of Mexico.
   Three police intelligence agents stopped their van at gunpoint.
   ``Bitches!'' Suarez said they shouted at them. ``Whores!
Assassins!''
   They were taken to an intelligence police jail where they were
later joined by a doctor, two nurses and a receptionist who were
arrested at the clinic.
   Suarez, 27, a schoolteacher's wife and mother of a 3-year-old
daughter, said she and the others were slapped and pistol-whipped.
She added that they could hear the screams of their elderly doctor
being tortured with electric shocks. Then, she said, they were
interrogated about their abortions.
   The women also were subjected to what Suarez called ``painful and
humiliating'' pelvic examinations in the presence of three men who
made sexually disparaging remarks.
   ``I felt like I was going to faint because of the abortion, the
emotional stress and the fact I had not eaten since the day
before,'' Suarez recalled in an interview with The Associated Press.
   After 14 hours, the women were released without being charged.
   Mexico City police spokesman Francisco Algorri confirmed that
uniformed intelligence agents arrested the women. In an interview,
Algorri handed over a copy of the arrest report, saying, ``That's
all the information I have.''
   The report did not say what happened after the arrests. Algorri
would not comment on Suarez's charges that the women were mistreated.
   Suarez said she went public with her account at the urging of
fellow members of the leftist Revolutionary Workers Party and
because ``my life is threatened anyway.''
   Pro-choice activists are hoping to rewrite the 1931 law that
outlaws abortion except in the cases of rape or endangerment of the
woman's life.
   ``I have been involved in the women's rights movement here in
Mexico for 15 years and I've only seen two cases where judges
approved the abortions,'' said Heather Dashner, a Revolutionary
Workers Party activist.
   The penalty for women who have illegal abortions is an automatic
suspended sentence, but doctors who perform them can lose their
medical licenses.
   Federal deputy Amalia Garcia of the Mexican Socialist Party plans
to propose clarifying guidelines for legal abortions when Congress
reconvenes in the fall.
   If there is enough public support, Garcia will propose legalizing
all voluntary abortions. The last such proposal, made in 1979,
created an uproar before dying in committee.
   ``I think Mexico has changed,'' Garcia said. ``There is more
tolerance. A more open way of thinking.''
   Still, she said, a fight to legalize abortion would be tough.
   Both the Catholic church and the vocal Pro-Life group, which
oppose all abortions, are powerful in Mexico.
   Pro-Life leader Serrano said he is ready for battle. During an
interview AP in his office, Serrano pointed to 7-foot-high stacks of
anti-abortion petitions the group will begin circulating this summer.
   By September, Pro-Life plans to present Congress with the
signatures of at least 5 million people opposing abortion, he said.
   Some pro-choice activists believe Pro-Life's vocal anti-abortion
campaign fostered the climate that led to the arrests of Suarez and
the others.
   Rosario Villalobos, who accompanied Suarez during her abortion
and who also was arrested, said that the week before Serrano had
called for a crackdown on abortion clinics.
   ``I don't think it was a coincidence,'' Villalobos said, but
Serrano denied any responsiblity for the arrests.
   ``The newspapers said we were starting another Inquisition,''
Serrano said. ``Although abortion is a crime, we condemn the
torture, the physical aggression against the women.''
   A crackdown on clinics won't stop women from ending pregnancies,
federal deputy Garcia said.
   Most women in Mexico, where an unskilled female worker makes
about $3.50 a day, cannot afford the $125 to $400 that clinics
charge. Instead, they perform their own abortions or seek help from
a midwife, nurse or friend.
   Mexican women fling themselves down stairs, use coat hangers,
drink risky herbal brews or douche with cleaning chemicals. They
sometimes bleed to death afterward, Garcia said.
   While the Health Department estimates the abortion rate at 10
percent of 2.4 million pregancies annually, a recently published
government study estimated 700,000 abortions are performed
nationwide annually. The estimate was drawn from a survey showing
70,000 women were treated for post-abortion complications at Social
Security hospitals in Mexico City in one year.
   The study, which did not survey private hospitals and clinics,
indicated that women with abortion-related complications are the
third most common Social Security hospital patient. It said six of
every 100 such patients die.
   Although birth control was legalized in 1972, unwanted pregnancy
is common. Many women don't use birth control because of ignorance
or because they are ashamed to ask for it. Some live in rural areas
where contraceptives are unavailable.
   Most women undergoing abortions have at least three children and
cannot afford another, Garcia said.
   Or they need to work, she said. Both public and private sector
employers give female job applicants pregnancy tests. Pregnant
applicants are turned away; pregnant workers are fired.
   ``Lots of Mexican women have abortions,'' Suarez said. ``The only
difference is that I talked about it.''

   More than 15,000 people work for Congress, enough
to populate a medium-sized town. That's almost 10 times the number
of aides and clerical workers on the payroll 50 years ago. Has the
Congressional paper chase gotten out of hand? That's the subject of
considerable debate among political scientists and others who keep
an eye on the Hill.

<TEXT>
   On New Year's Day, 1934, Alice Klopstad stepped
off the train at Washington's Union Station, a 22-year-old shorthand
whiz on her first trip away from her hometown of Spink, S.D.
   The next day, she went to work as a secretary in Room 452 of the
Senate Office Building, one of fewer than 600 employees on the
staffs of the 96 senators and their committees.
   How that 600 has grown.
   Today, about 4,000 people work for 100 senators; committees
employ 1,700 more. The story in the House is similar. In 1934 there
were 992 employees; in 1989, between members and committees, there
are 9,683.
   In all, more than 15,000 people work for Congress _ enough for a
medium-sized town.
   One is Alice Klopstad Andersen, still deep in the congressional
paper chase 55 years after she took her first dictation for South
Dakota Democrat William J. Bulow. Since 1973, she has been the
administrative assistant to Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead, R-Calif.
   ``Now, of course, it's so different,'' Mrs. Andersen says. ``You
think of a rural area and now it's a metropolis. It's that
different.''
   It sure is.
   People worry about it. Political scientists write books about it.
   Some say the staffs have grown too big, that all they do is help
their bosses get re-elected.
   Others disagree. Congress needs more staff, they say, because it
has more work to do now.
   As staffs have grown, so has their work space.
   The office Alice Andersen unlocks each morning shortly after 8
a.m. is Room 2346 of the Rayburn House Office Building, one of three
House office buildings _ and two annexes _ tourists encounter as
they drive up the long slope of Independence Avenue to the south of
the Capitol. On the northern, or Senate, side, are three Senate
office buildings.
   By mid-afternoon, Mrs. Andersen has papers spread all around her.
Snatching some from a chair so a visitor can sit, she recalls that
in 1934 she was one of four people on Bulow's Washington staff. He
kept an office in South Dakota, to be sure, but it was in his home
in Beresford.
   Her current employer, Moorhead, has a staff of nine in
Washington, plus two back home in Glendale and three more in
Pasadena.
   Such district staffs are typical. In 1959, roughly half the
members of Congress had full-time, year-round offices in their
states or districts. Now all do, usually more than one.
   Sens. George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Albert Gore, D-Tenn., have
eight home offices apiece. Sens. Donald Riegle and Carl Levin, both
Michigan Democrats, each has seven. Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., has
four district offices, staffed by 57 workers.
   Many congressional staff members, both in Washington and at home,
work on ``constituent services'' _ dealing with complaints about
their boss' stand on an issue, answering questions about
legislation, helping voters penetrate the bureaucracies of the
Social Security Administration or the Veterans Administration, for
example.
   Others assist their bosses in dealing with the welter of
legislation before them.
   One recent day, as the Senate debated the budget resolution, four
senators were on the floor. Two aides flanked Sen. Pete Domenici,
R-N.M., thrusting papers in front of him. Across the aisle, Sen.
James Sasser, D-Tenn., conferred with two aides. More than a dozen
others sat on a red plush bench in the rear of the chamber.
   Or consider the role of staffs in melding divergent House and
Senate versions of legislation into one bill both houses can accept.
For example:
   In Room 2175 of the Rayburn Building, where House and Senate
conferees are discussing the minimum wage bill, Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor Committee, leafs
through the conference agenda.
   ``It is my understanding,'' he says, ``that there has been
agreement at the staff level and we do have recommendations on items
2, 3, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 16. It is my understanding we can
just go through those or just move to adopt them if there is no
further discussion.''
   There is none.
   Items 4 to 7, on the other hand, deal with the sub-minimum
training wage, a key point of dispute between congressional
Democrats and the Bush administration.
   ``We have indicated they couldn't be part of a staff
recommendation and would be decided by the members,'' Kennedy says.
After brief discussion, the items are left in.
   At that point, Kennedy and Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., the only
senators present, must leave for a vote on the floor. Representing
the Senate side is left to John V. Harvey Jr., 33, chief labor
counsel of the committee, and a cluster of other staff members.
   That brief meeting on May 2 was the culmination of weeks of staff
work, beginning when the bill passed the Senate on April 12.
   Democratic and Republican Senate aides met separately to
formulate their positions. Then all the Senate aides got together.
There were similar meetings in the House. Then there were four
meetings of aides with the members of the conference committee,
going through the agenda item by item, making objections, agreeing
on changes.
   After each preliminary meeting, says one aide, the staffs carried
the changes to their bosses for approval. ``The member is always
involved in terms of final approval,'' he says.
   When the conference committee met, says the aide, who commented
on the condition he not be identified, ``It was really easy. We
didn't know until that moment that it was going to be easy.''
   Mrs. Andersen, reflecting on what staff members do, says,
``There's a volume of work. I wouldn't think we needed all those
people, but...'' She lets the thought trail off.
   Others are more blunt.
   ``Basically, they will get as many staff members as they possibly
can,'' says Mark Liedl, director of the Congressional Assessment
Project of the conservative Heritage Foundation. ``As their power
grows, they are able to get into more and more mischief, and I think
having the staff is just another resource that allows them to.''

   On the other hand, Christopher J. Deering, an associate professor
of political science at George Washington University who specializes
in the study of Congress, says the number of congressional staff
members is ``hardly outrageous when you compare it to the size of
the operation and the responsibilities that they have. It's really
quite an appropriate staff level, it seems to me.''
   Still, it is by far the largest staff of any legislative body in
the world. The Canadian Parliament, which is second, has an
administrative staff of 1,700 and an additional 1,500 employees who
work for members.
   The swelling of congressional staffs _ from just over six per
senator when Mrs. Andersen arrived in Washington to 40 or more today
_ was sharply criticized in a 1980 book by Michael J. Malbin, then a
research fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise
Institute.
   In ``Unelected Representatives,'' Malbin wrote that the
staggering growth in the number of aides ``has reinforced a
situation in which the deliberative aspect of representation gets
short shrift on all but the broad outlines. ... The process no
longer forces members to talk to each other to resolve the tough
issues.''
   Deering says members of Congress range ``all the way from a
member who is pretty much staff-driven to members who don't deal
with their staffs at all.''
   Rep. Norman D. Dicks, D-Wash., has seen the process from both
sides. Before his election to the House in 1976, he served for three
years as legislative assistant and later administrative assistant to
the late Sen. Warren Magnuson.
   In the House, Dicks finds, there is ``more direct member
involvement and interest'' than in the Senate because the 435
representatives are not spread as thinly among the committees as the
100 senators are.
   ``You hear some grousing in the cloakroom about how we have to go
to conferences and the senators sometimes don't show up and you've
got to deal with the staff of the Senate,'' he says. He adds,
however, that as a member of the House Appropriations Committee he
has been ``impressed with the level of knowledge that the Senate
subcommittee chairmen have and you didn't feel that they were being
led around by the staff.
   ``I think, frankly, that the American people get a good return on
the investment in congressional staff,'' Dicks says.
   So do the members of Congress, he adds.
   Staff members ``can make or break you. If they make mistakes and
get you in trouble, it can hurt you. On the other hand, if they do a
good job, it can do you an enormous amount of good. It's a big
advantage for the incumbent.''
   Indeed it is, say critics, and that's the rub.
   ``If they are helping Congress solve national problems, then it's
good,'' says the Heritage Foundation's Liedl. ``If they are focusing
more on doing activities that help their individual congressmen
expand and keep power, as in helping them get re-elected, then it's
disturbing.''
   Dicks is by no means alone as a member of Congress who graduated
from being an aide to a lawmaker from his state.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., worked for the late Sen.
Henry M. Jackson. Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, worked for
Sen. Edmund Muskie of Maine. Nancy Landon Kassebaum, R-Kan., worked
for Sen. James Pearson.
   Congressional aides also move on to other jobs in Washington. A
check of 58 biographical sketches of key government officials in the
Federal Staff Directory for 1988 showed that 10 of them had worked
on Capitol Hill. They included an assistant attorney general, two
assistant secretaries of state, the director of an independent
agency and members of three full-time commissions.
   Like the senators and representatives they work for, the staff
aides get lobbied.
   ``To be honest with you, most of our nuts-and-bolts work is done
with the staff members,'' says Jim Magill, legislative director of
the Veterans of Foreign Wars, who sometimes makes his point with
staff members over lunch. He buys.
   ``Probably the most visible of our work is appearing before the
various committees and subcommittees where we make our testimony,
but that usually is the final stage in a very long and drawn-out
process of working with the staff members and drafting legislation
and also working with the staff members to get the member that they
work for to offer amendments.''
   All in all, says Dicks, ``The professional staff up here does a
great job and they don't get paid very well.''
   Some might disagree about the pay.
   Records of the clerk of the House show that Mrs. Andersen was
paid $50,000 last year. Harvey, the Senate Labor Committee counsel,
made $52,500. At 24, Michael R. Bushman, press secretary to Rep.
Terry Bruce, D-Ill., made $29,000.
   For some aides, there is a fair amount of travel at the
taxpayers' expense.
   The Senate's statement of disbursements for the six months that
ended Sept. 30 showed, for example, that Daryl H. Owen, staff
director of the Senate Energy Committee, ran up $8,860 in expenses
on a trip to Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev; that Joanne N. Paulk,
director of interparliamentary services in the secretary of the
Senate's office, was paid $3,841 for a trip to London and Geneva,
and that her assistant, Yvonne L. Hopkins, got $3,611 for travel to
Vienna, Prague, Warsaw and Reykjavik.
   James A. Miller, in his book ``Running in Place,'' about his
experiences on the staff of former Senate Republican leader Howard
H. Baker Jr., said that in 1982, Baker's chief foreign relations
aide, Cran Montgomery, visited Panama, Argentina, Chile, Peru and
Mexico in January; Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Jordan and Israel in
April, and China and Hong Kong in May.
   Defenders of Capitol Hill staffs point to Congress' greater
responsibilities these days, both at home and abroad.
   ``Congress' role has increased dramatically because of the Great
Society programs ... our role in the world, what have you,'' says
Deering. ``I don't think there is any question the size of
government itself and government responsibilities expanded in the
1960s.''
   It was a simpler capital when Alice Klopstad arrived that New
Year's Day 1934.
   ``We were in Washington about six months of the year and home
about six months,'' she says. ``Now, everybody's here all the time.''

   From I.M. Pei's glass pyramid at the Louvre to
the woefully behind-schedule Bastille Opera, it is the best of times
and the worst of times for the observance of the French
Bicentennial. As the day of the big celebration on July 14
approaches, the French are less enthusiastic about their
bicentennial than Americans were about theirs. ``What is there to
celebrate?'' one Frenchman asks. ``It was a time of shame.''

   Restaurant Le Procope, where Voltaire, Danton and
Robespierre brooded over a beaker of vin rouge, has some interesting
items on its ``Menu du Bicentenaire,'' celebrating the 200th
anniversary of the French Revolution.
   For 289 francs, about $43, service compris (tip included), one
may choose:
   _Le Poussin en Bastille _ baby chicken baked in a latticed pastry
crust evoking the fortress prison that fell to the rebels on July
14, l789.
   _La Tete de Veau Docteur Guillotin aux deux sauces _ calf's head
memorializing Joseph Ignace Guillotin, the physician who advocated a
more humane, more democratic method of executing traitors to the
revolution than garroting or breaking them on the wheel. He
prescribed beheading, only to die on his own contraption.
   _La Charlotte Corday et Son Coulis Rouge _ a whipped-cream
dessert with a collar of raspberry jelly in memory of Charlotte
Corday, the convent novice from Calvados who went to the guillotine
for stabbing the murderous madman Jean Paul Marat to death in his
bathtub.
   Alors, since France abolished capital punishment eight years ago,
none of the four surviving guillotines is on display, although one
recently sold at a Paris auction for $40,000. But souvenirs recall
``the national razor that shaved close,'' as Charles Dickens called
the invention that dispatched Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, Mesdames
du Barry and Roland, the chemist Antoine Lavoisier, the astronomer
Jean Bailly, Georges Jacques Danton and Maximilien de Robespierre,
among 2,625 in Paris alone.
   The deadly machine that at the height of the Reign of Terror was
severing 60 heads a day is evoked on T-shirts, plates and ashtrays,
plastic key rings, rubber face masks of the doomed king and queen,
and wool shawls inspired by the sadistic harridans who knitted and
gossiped at the foot of the scaffold while heads rolled.
   As part of ``la fete de la Revolution,'' tenor Placido Domingo
will sing the title role of ``Andrea Chenier,'' the poet whose heart
melted as Mademoiselle Corday ascended the guillotine, then lost his
own head when the custodians of the Terror confused him with his
anarchist brother.
   Umberto Giordano's tragic opera is being staged in the gardens at
Versailles, where Louis XVI was busy at his hobby of shooting cats
off the roof that muggy July day when the mob stormed the Bastille.
They had hoped to release hundreds of political prisoners but found
only four lunatics, who were transferred to the asylum at Charenton,
two counterfeiters and a nobleman accused of incest.
   The rebels seized some arms and ammunition and decapitated
Bernard de Launey, the prison governor, parading his head about town
on a pitchfork.
   ``Rien,'' the king wrote in his diary: Nothing of importance
today.
   Next morning the mob began razing the eight-towered prison where
Voltaire once was a guest for hinting that the regent Philippe
d'Orleans committed incest with his daughter and where that young
whippersnapper the Marquis de Sade had time to pen some sexy memoirs
of pleasure and pain.
   Twice a day at rush hour, motorists still storm Place de La
Bastille, with its monument marking the start of the revolution,
creating l'embouteillage, the French word for gridlock, literally
``bottled up.''
   The excavated remains of one of the prison towers is on view in
the Bastille Metro stop. Among a vast collection of bicentennial
artifacts, including Marie Antoinette's prison cell dressing table
and the only statue of Louis XVI to survive the revolution, the
Carnavalet Museum is exhibiting a miniature Bastille carved from one
of the original blocks.
   Contractor Henri Palloy, entrusted with the demolition of the
prison, made a fortune selling these miniatures, but ended up with
his neck in the guillotine. No such consumer protection against
revolutionary schlock is available this time around.
   For President Francois Mitterrand, the bicentennial is the best
of times and the worst of times.
   His pet project, the Bastille Opera, is woefully behind schedule,
torn by political and artistic dissension and the subject of public
ridicule.
   ``C'est une blague'' _ it's a joke _ derided a taxi driver who on
screaming tires skirted the glass-sheathed edifice where on the
bicentennial eve President Bush and other world figures will
interrupt the cacophony of the hard hats to attend a concert with
Mitterrand inaugurating the unfinished auditorium.

   After the scandal attending the firing of Israeli conductor
Daniel Barenboim by couturier Pierre Berge of the house of Yves St.
Laurent, whom Mitterrand chose to run the opera, and the subsequent
resignation of composer Pierre Boulez as artistic director, Korean
Myung-Whun Chung was chosen to conduct an orchestra that still has
44 vacant chairs, including key soloists.
   A current joke in Paris asks, ``What is the difference between
the Bastille Opera and the Titanic?''
   ``The Titanic had an orchestra.''
   The best of times already seem at hand for I.M. Pei's glass
pyramid in the courtyard of the Louvre, another project dear to the
heart of the Socialist president, which at first was scoffed at by
art critics and deplored by the citizens. Now thousands wait on line
to descend escalators into the new museum entrance, admiring the way
the diamond-shaped panes reflect the splashing fountains and ever
changing clouds over the Seine against the somber stones of the
Renaissance-style palace.
   The French take their time appraising objets d'art.
Twelfth-century intellectuals deemed excessive the flying buttresses
that support Notre Dame cathedral. Bridge builder Gustave Eiffel's
towering salute to the centennial of the revolution was denounced as
``useless and monstrous'' and ``arrogant ironmongery'' by the likes
of Guy de Maupassant and Alexandre Dumas Fils.
   Laser-lighted and repainted a rich chocolate brown for its l00th
birthday, the 1,064-foot-high lacy iron tower astride four graceful
Gothic arches is still the glory of the Paris skyline and outdraws
all other local tourist attractions.
   The revolution exported to France by Benjamin Franklin, Thomas
Jefferson and the Marquis de Lafayette is being celebrated with many
refrains from the American bicentennial: fireworks, rock concerts,
street dances, a passage of tall ships from Rouen to Le Havre, a
parade of 5l bands featuring 760 trombones, and a full-sized replica
of the Statue of Liberty flame placed at the beginning of Avenue de
New York by the International Herald Tribune.
   On July l4, when all subways and buses are free, American soprano
Jessye Norman will star in ``Homage a La Marseillaise,'' a show
business extravaganza at Place de la Concorde, where the guillotine
stood.
   Norman will sing the national anthem, written three years after
the Bastille fell. The ``Marseillaise'' was composed by Rouget de
Lisle, a 32-year-old army officer who happened to be in Strasbourg
at the time, spent most of the Terror in prison and later wrote a
less-known anthem honoring the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy.
He got an angry letter from his mother when thugs and ex-convicts
from Marseilles marched on Paris singing his song to carry out the
September l792 massacre of 5,000 political prisoners, many of them
priests and children.
   A recent poll in Le Monde showed that most French know only a
little about the major events of their revolution. Numerous magazine
articles and TV commentators make the point that the citizens are
less enthusiastic about the bicentennial than the Americans were
about theirs in 1976.
   The revolution that began as a neighborhood disturbance in the
Faubourg St. Antoine by the sans-culottes, artisans and shopkeepers
who did not wear the fancy knee breeches of the aristocracy, led to
the Declaration of Rights of Man and the Citizen and the eventual
overthrow of the monarchy. But Napoleon with his whiff of grape shot
was waiting in the wings, not an egalitarian representative
government.
   Since the revolution, France has been governed by five republics,
interspersed with two emperors, three kings and a Fascist marshal.
The goal of Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite is still on the agenda of
most political parties.
   ``What is there to celebrate?'' asks Bernard Laplaud of
Villeneuve Les Avignon. ``It was a time of shame. The revolution
brought the Terror and then Napoleon, who made France a lot of
enemies.''
   Laplaud, a heating contractor, was installing a new furnace in
the penitentiary at Marseilles when France last executed a criminal,
a pimp convicted of murder. He recalls that the sentence was
``delayed for several hours because the ancient truck delivering the
guillotine from Paris broke down along the way.''
   Bicentennial celebrants nostalgic for the last time they saw
Paris will have difficulty finding comfort at any of the surviving
vespasiennes, the street urinals named for the Roman emperor who was
the first to provide public toilets. These endangered species are
rapidly being replaced by chiraquiennes, mod, cylindrical pay
toilets nicknamed for Jacques Chirac, the conservative mayor of
Paris who is a proponent of pay-as-you-go economics.

Alaska, is the place to go. One native son, at age 71, is still digging.

<DATELINE>FLAT, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You can count the year-round population of
this town on the fingers of one hand. They are Mark and Sherri
Kepler and their three children.
   In the summertime, the four months of thaw in interior Alaska,
the population swells to a grand total of maybe 30. These are gold
miners drawn back as irresistibly as the migrating swallows. They
come to work their old mining claims, to see anew the bedazzling
flashes of yellow among the gravel in their gold pans.
   The lure must be irresistible because even in summer Flat has
none of the amenities you might expect in any American village,
however small, with a certified U.S. post office. Not one store. Not
one cash register. Not one telephone.
   ``I am the federal presence here,'' says Mark Kepler. ``I am the
postmaster. Here is the post office.''
   He shows, proudly, a one-room building of about 10 feet by 15
feet that he explains was once a liquor store he restored according
to government specifications, complete with a Zip code and a flag.
   ``I fly the flag by the rules,'' he says. ``I raise it at dawn,
which here in Alaska happens in April, and I take it down at sunset,
in September.''
   Correction. Flat, Alaska, does have a store. It is padlocked, but
its goods are still on the shelves, unsold. The last sale was about
1942. One of the unsold items is a brand-new dog sled.
   It also has a bank, likewise padlocked. Inside is a roll-top
desk, its pigeonholes full, a green visor and sleeve garters in one
drawer, a locked vault with who knows what in it, and a set of brass
scales that weighed 1.7 million ounces of gold.
   Flat was one of this frontier state's boomingest gold boom towns,
now frozen in time but still breathing.
   Its gravel streets and byways are strewn with carcasses of cars
and trucks and mining debris dating from the 1930s. ``When those
people all left,'' says Kepler, ``I guess it was too much trouble to
take them out.''
   Kepler, a mechanic, drives a '38 pickup truck he made to run like
a jeweled watch from salvaged parts.
   It would indeed have been at least as much trouble to take all
that stuff out as it was to haul it in.
   Flat was named for nearby Flat Creek. It might as easily have
been named Otter for another nearby creek. (Or Poorman, for yet
another, although that would not, over all, have been accurate.) It
is out in the wilderness 275 miles northwest of Anchorage as the
crow flies.
   As the hungering miners found their way here when gold was
discovered by a prospector named John Beaton in 1908, the route was
much longer.
   It required riverboats up the Kuskokwim River, then up the
Iditarod River to a landing place, then eight miles overland to the
gold fields of Flat.
   A town of about 6,000 sprang up at the landing place, Iditarod,
and the gold rush became known as the Iditarod Stampede. Nothing
remains of Iditarod, only weathered skeletons of a few buildings.
One of them was Tootsie's, a house of ill fame.
   A bathtub from the collapsed rubble of Tootsie's now resides in
the home of Mark and Sherri Kepler at their home in Flat, which they
built and furnished themselves.
   ``Isn't it something, look at those clawed feet,'' says Mrs.
Kepler. ``If only it could talk.''
   John Miscovich remembers Tootsie's.
   In fact, Miscovich has a remarkable memory for every place and
every excitement in Flat since he was born here in 1918 in a cabin
on Otter Creek.
   He is the son of an ambitious immigrant who heard about the
Iditarod Stampede, got in on it, worked for wages, bought a claim
and sent for his wife in Yugoslavia. John is the result.
   He, at 71, and his wife, Mary, and any of their four grown
children who can make it, return to Flat every summer, with the
swallows, to take out of their now extensive land holdings whatever
gold a mom-and-pop operation, as he calls it, can yield.
   ``In the early days we took 6,000 ounces a year,'' he says. ``We
don't even try for that now, but it's still worthwhile.''
   You bet. Gold appears daily in his sluice, and two years ago he
unearthed a 28-ounce nugget. At the going price of gold, that alone
is worth about $8,000.
   ``Well,'' says Miscovich, ``because it's a nugget and not dust,
and it fits just right in the palm of your hand, it's probably worth
at auction 10 times the price of gold. Some Texan would pay that to
make it into a belt buckle.
   ``Oh, yes, we still have it,'' he says. ``You're never broke if
you have a little gold put aside.''
   But Miscovich didn't make it only on gold. Working for his father
as a boy he had to straddle, like a horse, a huge and heavy
cannon-like hose nozzle used to bust up gold-producing earth with a
high-pressure stream of water. It was hard work, and dangerous. He
figured there must be a better way. So he invented one, and patented
it.
   If you have seen a fireboat at work or a ladder truck with a
mounted nozzle you have seen Miscovich's invention, a water cannon
with even higher pressure but small and safe and easy to aim. ``I
designed it for miners,'' he says, ``but it was firefighters who
wanted it the most.''

   Miscovich left school in the 11th grade, never went to college.
Yet the knowledge of geology and mining he picked up on his own is
so recognized that he has served for years in the winter months as a
consultant to mining companies, inspecting potential digging sites
around the globe.
   He could have made a fine living at that alone. It isn't need or
greed, he says, that draws him and his wife here every summer from
their comfortable winter home in Orange, Calif.
   Their home here is typical of an Alaska mining camp. It is small,
tin-roofed, its plumbing uncertain, its dooryard cluttered with old
wagon wheels, moose antlers, remains of mining equipment.
   ``It doesn't have all the comforts,'' he says, ``but we actually
look forward to coming back every year.
   ``We like the isolation. We like getting out and working with our
hands. If the ballgame on TV, or the Sunday paper, or the movie
house aren't all that important to you you would understand.''
   The now-empty town also brings back vivid memories for Miscovich.
   He remembers the day Wiley Post crash-landed here in 1933. A
snapshot of Miscovich with the pioneer aviator hangs on his wall.
   He remembers catching fish as a boy, selling them to the miners
to relieve their diet of moose steaks, and of the excitement when a
bear would wander into town.
   He remembers the Fourth of July bashes at the recreation hall
that lasted three days. The hall remains, decorated with 48-star
flags and a fine upright piano. The piano needs tuning.
   And he remembers the great Black Bear gold robbery, Flat's only
recorded crime.
   ``It was set up by the mail carrier who delivered the gold by dog
sled, $120,000 worth, and by a prostitute known as Black Bear _ her
sister was called The Cub _ and by her procurer.
   ``They got caught, the gold was recovered, the mailman turned
state's evidence and went free. The other two were tried in
Fairbanks. The jury set them free, too ...
   ``Black Bear and the procurer later made a fortune in bootlegging
and went off to California to raise racehorses.''
   Miscovich saw the boom end and Flat's terminal illness set in.
Flat became inaccessible except by airplane, the old Iditarod road
rendered impassable by neglect. Small operators couldn't meet the
bottom line.
   For excitement in Flat today, the biggest attraction would be
Mark Kepler's workshop.
   It is truly a wondrous place. Machinery from another age still
functions _ lathe, drill press, saw, forge _ turned to life by a
single motor and a dozen flapping belts.
   ``This is where I spend most of my time,'' he says. ``It's my
playground.'' Anything busted, Kepler can fix.
   The very isolation of Flat, not to mention all that abandoned
machinery to play with, was what prompted the Keplers to buy one of
its forsaken houses seven years ago to use for summer outings.
   They lived in Aniak, a small village 75 miles southwest, the
closest place from here where people live. He worked there as a
commercial pilot and airplane mechanic. Kepler is 35. The two Kepler
boys are 12 and 9 and the girl is 2.
   ``When the postmaster job opened up three years ago we decided to
come out here and stay permanently. To us, this is paradise. I have
plenty to keep me busy.''
   What do you do in winter?
   ``Mostly cut wood.''
   Wood fuels the Kepler furnace and the kitchen stove. A diesel
generator provides electricity for the refrigerator, but kerosene
lamps serve for much of the lighting.
   Do the children like the life?
   ``They love it. The other day Sherri and I were discussing the
possibility of the post office closing down and us having to leave.
The boys said they would stay without us.''
   Mrs. Kepler teaches the children by correspondence, not unusual
in the Alaskan outback. She uses books and lesson plans provided by
the state. She talks to a correspondence teacher twice a week, by
radio. ``Both boys test well above their grade level,'' she says.
   Every three or four months Mark cranks up his airplane and the
Keplers go shopping in Anchorage. They have their supplies mailed
back, which gives Kepler a little business at the post office.
   His other postal business is mainly forwarding mail in winter to
the miners who keep Flat as their permanent mailing address. Unlike
Miscovich, who has a regular second home, most of the others go off
to various sunny places to spend their gold.
   The mail plane arrives three times a week, even if there's
nothing to deliver.
   Flat happens to be on the way between other more populated mail
drops and it isn't much trouble to make one more landing. Besides,
Alaskans have a tradition of seeing to one another out in the bush,
especially during the dark, harsh winter.
   ``Drop us a Christmas card,'' says Kepler. ``We're always glad to
hear from the outside.''
   Five people there. That's all. Their address is Flat, Alaska,
99584.

   They are disadvantaged children given an
advantage their parents didn't have, a chance at the best education
America has to offer. This spring the first group of minority
students to go through the Prep for Prep program collected college
diplomas. The next test is how they put their knowledge and skills
to work.

   The idea was planted 11 years ago by a public
school teacher in the South Bronx: Find gifted minority students,
give them some intensive instruction and place them in exclusive
private schools.
   This spring that idea bore fruit.
   Some of the finest universities in the country _ Princeton,
Northwestern, Pennsylvania, Oberlin _ gave degrees to 10 students
from New York, mostly from disadvantaged neighborhoods, who entered
the ``Prep for Prep'' program in 1978 as 11- and 12-year-olds.
   ``They go to private schools and colleges like Princeton, but
they never forget where they came from,'' says Frankie Cruz, 22, who
was in that first group of students. ``I never forgot the South
Bronx and I hope to use my newly acquired skills to give something
back to that community.''
   That's just how the founder, Gary Simons, pictured it.
   ``What we're really interested in is leadership development,''
says Simons, 43. ``It'll be another six or eight years before
they'll get out into positions in society.''
   There are about 550 Prep for Prep students who will be attending
the city's best private schools this fall. Another 150 from the
program's early days will be in college.
   More than 1,700 of the most talented minority students in the
city applied this year for only 150 spots.
   ``It's probably harder to get into Prep than to get into
Harvard,'' says Sherry Wang, dean of the preparatory program.
   Those who make it will go from graffiti-scarred, numbered schools
_ P.S. 121, P.S. 183 _ to independent schools with names such as
Fieldston, Dalton, Collegiate, Buckley.
   They often travel from poor to affluent circumstances for the
school day. And they are suddenly surrounded by white kids.
   ``I was leaving all my friends behind and I didn't know what
private school would be like,'' says Lourdes Sastre, a 16-year-old
Hispanic girl who just finished her junior year at Nightingale
School. ``Then later, some of my friends would say, `You're acting
white.'''
   ``I lost a lot of friends that way,'' says Cherell Carr, a
16-year-old from Brooklyn who is black and just finished her junior
year at Dalton on Manhattan's Upper East Side.
   ``That's when I found out who my real friends are,'' says Miss
Sastre.
   The core of the program is a 14-month stretch of intensive
instruction for public school fifth- and sixth-graders, to get them
ready for the exclusive independent schools. (That's preparation for
preparatory schools _ Prep for Prep.)
   ``You can't imagine how hard it really can be until you get into
it,'' says Luanda Williams, an 11-year-old who will move from the
sixth grade at P.S. 121 in the Bronx to Trinity School on
Manhattan's Upper West Side in the fall. ``The first summer is the
toughest. You don't know what's going on.''
   Her father, Franklin Williams, is a bus driver who grew up poor
in Jamaica. He and his wife, who would read nightly to their
daughter, knew Prep for Prep was the unmistakable knock of
opportunity.
   ``When I heard there was this opportunity to go to a better
school, I thought, `This could be a better chance in life,'''
Franklin Williams says. ``It's very hard, but there's a challenge in
everything. Nothing good is easy.''
   Children accepted into Prep for Prep find themselves immersed in
a rigorous summer program from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. five days a week.
They continue attending their public schools for the sixth grade,
but go to Prep for Prep classes every Wednesday evening and all day
Saturday.
   This is followed by another summer of special schooling, after
which they enter a private school. Prep for Prep continues to track
the students, offering counseling and tutoring.
   All of the students attending private schools get aid of some
kind, with more than three-quarters of them on full or nearly-full
scholarships. When it comes time to choose a college, they are given
assistance in applying for aid. All of the students receive some
college aid, many getting full scholarships.
   In 1987, a similar program called Prep 9 was begun for
ninth-grade students, who go off to boarding schools.
   Prep for Prep has a $1.9 million budget for its preparatory
program, counseling, tutoring and administrative costs. It's covered
by grants from foundations and corporations and gifts from
individuals. State and city money accounts for 2 percent of the
budget.
   About one-quarter of those accepted into Prep for Prep drop out
of the 14-month program. But 95 percent of those who are accepted
into private schools complete their secondary education there.
   This year's 46 high school seniors are headed for, among other
places, Duke, Vassar, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Stanford, Yale, Harvard and Carnegie Mellon University.
   Behind all of this is Simons, whose unassuming manner belies an
ardent desire to change the world. In a nutshell, he's trying to
produce leaders _ social, political, artistic, scientific _ from the
minority community.

   ``We're looking at a society that's becoming increasingly
pluralistic,'' Simons says. ``My sense is that the old standby, the
American Dream, is very corny but very powerful. It undergirds our
collective consciousness.
   ``But there is an enormous gap between the rhetoric of the
American Dream and the blemished reality.''
   Simons himself attended public school, albeit the rarefied halls
of the Bronx High School of Science. ``When I grew up, I never
realized there was another set of schools,'' he says.
   As a teacher of gifted students in the South Bronx, Simons
despaired of watching talented children languish in unchallenging,
sometimes chaotic public schools.
   ``Most of those kids get destroyed long before they get to the
starting gate,'' he says.
   Outside the classroom, ``The environment would mow them down.
Peer pressure. There is a density of kids who don't have a sense of
options, and that reinforces the limitations.''
   ``The public school system doesn't meet the needs of the young
people of the community,'' Ms. Wang says.
   ``Most of the children come from gifted programs or magnet
schools, but they're still in very large classes. They don't have
the skills to compete at the collegiate level.''
   Prep for Prep grew out of Simons' field work toward a doctorate
in gifted education. He never got that degree _ work on the program
swamped him, he says _ but he succeeded in proving that ``one person
can have an effect on people's lives.''
   Simons wants the Prep for Prep students to end up in positions
where they can ``legitimately and effectively affect decisions.''
   ``From their own lives, they may have a sense of how public
policy most impacts those least able to influence it,'' he says.
``We want to inculcate a sense of social responsibility.''
   ``They tell us, `It's not about social welfare, it's about social
change. You're capable people _ we need people in power who
represent everybody,''' said Charles Guerrero, a 16-year-old from
the Bronx who graduated from Fieldston this spring and will attend
Harvard in September.
   Says Frankie Cruz, who was one of Simons' students in the Bronx:
``For a selected few students, he made the American Dream possible.
You can say it's idealistic, but through hard work and the kind of
commitment he demands, he made it successful.''
   That commitment means 11- and 12-year-olds who find their summers
shot, all for an intangible goal years in the future.
   ``I didn't feel I was losing out on anything. I felt I was
gaining everything,'' says Angel Colon, a 12-year-old from Brooklyn
who will switch from P.S. 250 to Packer Collegiate in the fall.
   ``But the adjustment period was tough,'' he says. ``For example,
my best friend would always call me about his new comic books, his
new bike. He'd say he went to the pool Friday, he went to Great
Adventure Wednesday.''
   His mother, Damaris Dumey, recalled his saying, ``When I'm small,
why make me give up my summer?''
   ``I feel the program has secured his future, academically,'' she
says. ``If it wasn't for this program, he wouldn't be on his feet
today, because of the peer pressure.''
   Luanda Williams found ``the amount of work you get every night is
overwhelming. Sometimes I'm up to 11 o'clock. I think, if I make it
through this, I'll go to one of the best schools and everything will
work out.''
   Sometimes the social adjustment is just as big.
   ``One of the first things that happens is their speech patterns
change, they sound different,'' says Martha Boyd, a counselor who
holds sessions for the children that cover everything from etiquette
to drugs to getting along with rich white kids.
   ``This bothers some children _ `You're not sounding like you're
supposed to,''' she says. ``Their dress changes, their values
change, their behavior changes. We tell them change is all right,
it's natural. Don't be afraid of it.''
   Cherell Carr found she enjoys Dalton and the Upper East Side: ``I
like the fact that they learn from you as much as you learn from
them. They only know about themselves; they're learning about other
cultures now.''
   ``I have a lot of friends back home who are very bright, who
could make it in college but are not on the right track,'' says
Nicole Atchison, who came out of the Bronx, into Prep for Prep and
on to Cornell, from which she graduated this spring.
   ``They don't think they can make it, they weren't encouraged,
they don't think have enough money,'' she says. ``What Prep for Prep
does is start you out on the right track.''

   Perry Rivkind, Miami's immigration director who
sometimes seems to be a branch of the U.S. government unto himself,
angrily called a Haitian exile leader about the sign someone erected
outside the Krome alien detention center.
   It read: ``Reagan's Concentration Camp.''
   ``Does that bother you?'' asked the Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste, the
exile leader.
   He was assured in the strongest terms that the sign did bother
Rivkind, a fervent admirer of Ronald Reagan and traditional American
values, albeit he sometimes dresses in black leather and zips around
town on his motorcycle.
   The next day, the sign had been replaced.
   The new one: ``Rivkind's Concentration Camp.''
   Rivkind had to laugh when he called Jean-Juste after that one.
Jean-Juste was laughing, too. The priest, who has been the outspoken
leader of Miami's Haitians for a decade, may not like Rivkind's
policies, but he likes Rivkind.
   ``We are friends and enemies at the same time,'' Jean-Juste
explains. ``We tease each other and laugh together, but when we are
on business we are both devils.''
   For his part, Rivkind, who recently rebuked Jean-Juste publicly
for calling him ``Mr. Hitler,'' promises to invite his friend Gerry
to his going-away party when he retires later this year after 22
years of federal government service.
   ``The Perry and Gerry Show,'' the ongoing exchanges between two
of Miami's most public figures, is symptomatic of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service in Miami in the six years
since Rivkind returned to his hometown from Washington.
   Rivkind, the self-styled ``bad-boy bureaucrat'' is in charge of
the nation's most volatile immigration district. In dealing with
Haitians, Cubans, Nicaraguans and others flooding into this
immigrant city, he keeps his office door ajar and his phone lines
open and runs his district like a benevolent despot, quite unlike
the nation's 34 other immigration districts.
   ``I think Perry Rivkind has been a breath of fresh air,'' says
Ira Kurzban, a Miami attorney who recently filed the latest in 10
years' worth of lawsuits challenging U.S. treatment of Haitian
immigrants.
   ``The Miami INS district office has for a long time been a
hotbed,'' says Verne Jervis, chief INS spokesman in Washington.
``It's such an international city there are an awful lot of forces
at work there. It takes a real juggling act to try to carry out the
immigration law.''
   Under Rivkind, Jervis says, the ``INS in Miami probably has more
support there than ever before. His openness, the access to his
office are the highest they've ever been. A number of people here at
INS headquarters certainly view him as a little bit of a maverick,
but if you can do that and maintain a semblance of control and order
you can get away with it.''
   The 100,000 or more Haitians in the area detest U.S. interdiction
of Haitians at sea and what they see as unfair and even racist
treatment.
   While they don't necessarily buy Rivkind's explanation that he's
simply upholding the law and defending the nation's borders, many
Haitians admire his gestures of humanity, such as his 1984 order
sending immigration officers to Haiti to fetch a 9-year-old Haitian
boy who was deported while Rivkind was on vacation.
   Cubans, who with more than 800,000 in South Florida constitute
the largest Cuban community anywhere except the city of Havana, have
feted Rivkind and admire his anti-communism. The immigration
director says that if he were president, he'd have the Marines
landing on Fidel Castro's beaches tomorrow.
   Nicaraguans, more than 100,000 strong in South Florida, like
Rivkind's aversion to sending them back to what he considers a
hostile, sometimes brutal government. And many in Miami's other
Hispanic groups like Rivkind's ``caudillo''-style forceful
personality and decisiveness.
   Rivkind, the 59-year-old son of Russian immigrants loves his job,
the latest in a long series of federal positions. A high school
dropout, he became a master's laureate, Korean War veteran and
former Miami Beach hotelier, vice cop, and county police patrolman
before becoming a career federal bureaucrat. Most of his 22 federal
years have been in the Justice Department in various roles, but he
still recalls grimly a few months working in the Pentagon, which he
found stifling.

   ``The worst thing about government is inertia. Congress _ it
takes so long to get anything done. The State Department _ they
analyze everything to death,'' Rivkind says.
   Not so with Perry Abbott Rivkind.
   With a dozen Nicaraguans set for deportation three years ago,
Rivkind refused to send them back ``to a cowardly communist
government.''
   Thus, Miami became the first immigration district to stop
deporting Nicaraguans while the U.S.-supported Contra rebels were
fighting a guerrilla war.
   Rivkind today says he had been told the Justice Department
planned to change the policy. Of course, when Attorney General Edwin
Messe III acted, the policy already was a year old in Miami.
   Jervis said Rivkind may not always follow channels, but ``his
judgment has generally been pretty good.''
   Rivkind, who counts presidential son Jeb Bush among his close
friends, admits he's not a team player, and unlike many bureaucratic
colleagues doesn't spend a lot of time worrying about possible
negative reactions to his decisions.
   ``After so many years in government, so many agencies, so many
experiences _ I've been to 75 countries under the Nixon
administration training foreign narcotics agents _ you don't react
to events, you handle them. You make decisions with ease, without
overreacting, without worrying.''
   Some examples:
   _When two groups of young Cubans came ashore three years ago,
Rivkind immediately granted them asylum and brought them up to his
11th-floor office for a news conference to talk about the terrible
state of affairs under Castro.
   _When Everglades brush fires sent coarse smoke billowing across
downtown Miami in April, most Miamians closed their windows and
complained. Rivkind closed the INS building, then evacuated the
Krome detention center.
   For a while, he was telling television crews he was trying to
hire enough buses to ship all of the more than 700 aliens,
three-fourths of them Haitian, to Texas INS centers. That alarmed
Haitians in Miami and surprised INS officials in Texas. After a
night at Miami's baseball stadium, the aliens were back in Krome.
   _When Florida's lottery made a Nicaraguan a millionaire recently,
questions were raised about his immigration status. With the winner
apparently in hiding, Rivkind granted him asylum.
   Rivkind's decisions can seem hasty to some, given the national
and international implications.
   Some people wondered whether the Cubans had demonstrated a
well-founded fear of persecution, as required for political asylum,
but Rivkind said they certainly would be persecuted if they were
returned to their ``perverted, pathological'' government.
   Haitians who get here in dangerously overcrowded boats can be
returned, Rivkind says, because they don't face persecution at home.
In fact, he believes the Haitian government actively encourages
Haitians to go to the United States to get jobs for pay they can
send home to relatives.
   As for the Nicaraguan Lotto millionaire, Rivkind says he deserved
asylum because of the persecution threat. After all, Rivkind joked,
he's now a capitalist and the Sandinista government persecutes
capitalists.
   The Krome detention center, a converted Nike missile base on the
edge of the Everglades, is a symbol of INS abuse to exile activists
such as Jean-Juste. Rivkind visits frequently, eats lunch with the
detainees at least once a week, but says he is required by law to
hold undocumented aliens there pending exclusion proceedings.
   ``Rivkind so managed to distance himself from the arrogant agency
he works for that he was like the Reagan of immigration, the Teflon
INS man,'' says Robert Boyer, an attorney who presses Nicaraguan
immigration claims.
   Rivkind, who claims unconvincingly to be surprised and flattered
that a reporter wants to visit him, is ready with a thick pile of
newspaper clippings and even family scrapbooks featuring his late
father, Sam, a semi-pro basketball player and pioneering Miami Beach
hotelier. Perry's older brother, Lawrence, is a Dade Circuit Court
judge.
   Amid all the photos of Rivkind with Reagan, Bush, Nixon and
others, there hangs a framed photo of an idyllic scene, a placid
river lined with trees and mountains near Roanoke, Va.
   That's where he'll be a year from now, says the divorced father
of two. He'll be relaxing, enjoying retirement.
   But he'd like to do some college teaching and maybe hit the
lecture circuit talking about immigration law and ``my favorite
subject _ me,'' he says, laughing.

   The Confederacy's infamous Andersonville prison
camp in Georgia marks its 125th anniversary this year. So does the
Union's Elmira prison in New York. While Andersonville remains a
symbol of the inhumanities endured by prisoners in the Civil War,
Elmira and other Northern prisons escaped that notoriety. But there
is little evidence that one was any better than the other.

   Like some rusty bayonet or tattered battle
flag hidden away in the attic, the Elmira prison camp is an
all-but-forgotten relic of the Civil War.
   Considering the human suffering involved, maybe memories of the
prison, which opened 125 years ago this month, are best left
undisturbed.
   Except for a flagpole, a small monument and two stone markers
there's nothing in the quiet Elmira neighborhood where the prison
camp once stood to mark its presence. But buried beheath tidy rows
of white headstones and shade trees at the Woodlawn National
Cemetery are the remains of 2,973 Confederate soldiers who died at
Elmira, many from starvation.
   The Confederacy's Andersonville prison in Georgia is remembered
as the most infamous example of the inhumanity and deprivations of
the Civil War, even though records show that a soldier imprisoned in
Elmira stood little better chance of surviving than did one in
Andersonville.
   Questions linger over whether those 2,973 Rebels died mainly
because of the primitive state of medicine and sanitation during the
Civil War, or whether they were victims of the Lincoln
administration's retaliatory neglect of some prisoners of war.
   ``Can one say that, by design, this was a death camp?'' asks J.
Michael Horigan, an Elmira history teacher who spent much of the
last year researching records from Civil War prison camps in
Washington, D.C., and in the South. ``I think one can say it, but
you can't document it. The records on this camp are very incomplete.
But circumstantial evidence certainly makes it look that way.''
   Union officials ordered in May 1864 that a complex of barracks at
Elmira that had been used for three years to house Union soldiers be
converted to a prison camp for captive Southerners. A 12-foot high
fence was immediately thrown around a 30-acre portion of barracks.
   There were 35 wooden buildings in the complex, each about 100
feet long and 16 feet wide. Union officers in Elmira wrote the War
Department that the barracks could accommodate 3,000 men comfortably
and 1,000 more in a pinch.
   Orders came back from Washington that 10,000 men were to be
housed in the camp. Men not lucky enough to get places in barracks
would sleep in tents. Wooden barracks weren't constructed for all
the men until well after winter had set in.
   On July 6, 1864, a train pulled into Elmira with the first
399-man contingent of prisoners on board.
   It was a ragged group of prisoners. Most had been captured during
the grinding battles of the Wilderness in Virginia. Elmirans noted
that their ragtag uniforms hardly made the men look like members of
the same army. Some prisoners wore only shirts and underwear. Many
had no shoes.
   Things went wrong at the prison camp almost from the beginning.
   On July 15, a train loaded with 844 Confederates and 128 Union
guards bound for Elmira smashed head-on with a coal train near
Shohola, Pa. Many of the wooden cars were reduced to kindling in the
accident, which killed 49 prisoners and 17 guards.
   Five prisoners escaped during the chaos and it took three days
for some of the wounded to receive medical treatment.
   Meanwhile, inside the camp, a peril just as lethal though slower
in its effect was taking shape.
   A stagnant body of water, called Foster's Pond, was within the
fences of the prison. With so many men being sent to the camp _
there would be more than 4,400 by the end of July, 9,600 by the end
of August _ the water quickly became fouled. The pond became a
breeding ground of disease amid an extended heat wave that summer.
   Less than three weeks after Elmira opened, a local newspaper
reported that a ``deleterious miasma'' hung over the camp due to the
stagnant water. One Union surgeon called it a ``festering mass of
corruption.''
   Prison administrators asked the Union's commissioner general of
prisoners, Col. William Hoffman, for permission to dig canals
connecting the pond with the nearby Chemung River to allow fresher
water to pass through it.
   Approval for that project didn't come until October _ and
prisoners didn't complete the canals until Jan. 1, 1865.
   ``I think this falls into the realm of circumstantial evidence,''
Horigan says. ``This is what I call the politics of delay. The
sluice could have been done by August 1864.''
   In the meantime, men were dying in droves.
   ``The scurvy was among us, and as the cold weather advanced the
death rate increased rapidly,'' wrote prisoner L.B. Jones. ``Scurvy,
typhoid, pneumonia and finally smallpox broke out to an alarming
extent, carrying off great numbers of the poor fellows.''

   Emory Thomas, a history professor at the University of Georgia,
says doctors at Elmira weren't different from those practicing
elsewhere during a war in which twice as many men died from disease
than from battle-related wounds.
   ``The doctors really weren't convinced about the germ theory of
disease at this point,'' he says. ``At this time they were dealing
with very, very nuts-and-bolts things, like how to set a fracture
properly and whether chloroform would kill and if ether was better
than chloroform. These are important things, but we're not talking
about great leaps forward in medical practice.''
   The food at Elmira could have been another problem. Elmira
prisoners after the war said a day's rations generally included two,
1-inch-thick slices of bread, 2 ounces of meat and a pint of soup,
often only the thin broth in which the meat was cooked. Union
officers insisted after the war that rations at Elmira were more
generous.
   ``I was assured by a guard that the same rations were issued to
the prisoners as to the U.S. troops stationed there,'' Confederate
soldier Erastus Palmer recalled after the war. ``There seemed to me
to be some bad leak in it before it got to us.''
   In May 1864, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton had ordered that
prison rations to Confederates being held in Northern camps be
reduced to the same level as those Southern troops in the field were
receiving. This coincided with the Lincoln administration's general
hardening of its treatment of Southern prisoners starting that year
as news began to filter north of the deprivations being endured by
Union soldiers at Andersonville, the Libby prison in Richmond, Va.,
and other Confederate camps.
   Horigan calls Stanton a ``very vindictive man,'' who exercised
virtual dictatorial control over the Northern prison camp system.
   ``Abraham Lincoln had very little to do with any decision-making
as far as the prison-camp system was concerned,'' Horigan says.
``One of the characteristics of his presidency was that he relegated
power to his cabinet members. He gave them an enormous amount of
power and an enormous amount of leeway.''
   Many of Elmira's prisoners blamed Stanton, too.
   ``It is my honest opinion that Secretary Stanton did this in
retaliation,'' Virginia soldier Enos Lyons later wrote of conditions
at Elmira. ``Yes, men died in Elmira prison I know from hunger and
want; this in a land of plenty. I was young and strong and
determined I would not be carried out if I could help it, but many
poor prisoners lay right down and died of hunger.''
   According to figures compiled by an early-century historian of
the Elmira prison, Clay Holmes, 27 percent of the camp's captives
died. Pulitzer Prize-winning Civil War historian James McPherson
places Elmira's mortality rate at 24 percent.
   By way of comparison, 13,000 or 29 percent of the 45,000 Union
soldiers imprisoned at Andersonville died.
   For the Civil War as a whole, 15.5 percent of the Union soldiers
imprisoned in 28 Southern camps died while in captivity and 12
percent of the Confederates in 24 Northern camps died.
   Why, then, have Elmira and other Northern prisons with high death
rates _Camp Alton, Ill., Lookout Point, Md., Johnson's Island, Ohio,
and Rock Island, Ill. _ escaped Andersonville's notoriety?
   ``To the extent that Elmira and others lack infamy, I would guess
it has to do with who won the war,'' Thomas says.
   Andersonville's commandant, Henry Wirz, was the only soldier
executed after the Civil War as a war criminal, an act that caused
lingering resentment for decades among some Southerners who claimed
he was made a scapegoat for the mismanagement of prison camps on
both sides.
   And the only historic site operated by the National Park Service
at a former Civil War prison camp is at Andersonville. Events
including historic re-creations, memorial services and even an
archaeological dig will be held throughout this year to mark
Andersonville's 125th birthday.
   But Elmira's anniversary will pass quietly. The chances are good
that most of the people living in the well-maintained,
turn-of-the-century homes around the former site of the camp won't
give the historic significance of this year a second thought.
   ``A lot of people from around here _ a majority of people, I'd
say _ still don't know there was a prison camp in Elmira,'' Decker
says.
   ``The people in the South know Elmira,'' Horigan says. ``They
know their granddaddy was there or whatever. And quite a few compare
it to Andersonville. I don't think they're correct in doing so.
Nothing else was Andersonville.
   ``But why we only think of Andersonville when we think of Civil
War prison camps I don't know. These places were bad places, all of
them were. It was despicable, the way both the South and the Union
treated their prisoners. It was the darkest chapter of the war.''

   Connecticut Yankee Mason Adams, sitting on the
wooden deck of his California hillside home, isn't speculating on
the future of the NBC summer comedy series ``Knight and Daye.''
   ``I'm in suspended animation as far as doing any more `Knight and
Daye' shows,''' says Adams, who stars in the series with Jack Warden
and Hope Lange. ``We did six episodes. We'll have to see how it
plays. It could come back as a mid-season replacement. But that's
all speculation.''
   The show had a preview July 8 and is scheduled to begin its
regular summer run July 12.
   The comedy focuses on the once-famous radio act of Hank Knight
and Everett Daye. Adams is Daye, Warden is Knight and Lange is
Daye's wife, Gloria.
   Knight and Daye had split up 30 years earlier when Knight made a
play for Daye's then-girlfriend, Gloria.
   ``I was a news writer, basically a journalist,'' Adams says of
his character. ``I got a job at this radio station where Jack Warden
was a radio personality. When the station manager saw our names,
Knight and Daye, he put us together. I was reluctant, so what it
evolved into was that we were constantly in confrontation.
   ``When we get back together, someone says, `Hey, they're
fighting.' And someone else says, `That's what they do.' When I'm
asked about our breakup I say we had a profound disagreement.
Actually, he was making moves on my future wife.''
   Adams, who's lived mostly in Connecticut for the past 30 years,
bought the house in Bel Aire when he came West to play managing
editor Charlie Hume in ``Lou Grant.''
   ``We never sold it and it's worked out very well. I hate living
in hotels,'' he says. He and his wife, Margot, a writer, also keep a
home in New York City.
   It's the third television series for Adams. Besides ``Lou
Grant,'' which ran from 1977-82, Adams also starred in
``Morningstar, Eveningstar,'' which was on briefly in 1986.
   But an older generation knows Adams as Pepper Young in the
long-running radio soap opera ``Pepper Young's Family.'' He was the
third actor to play Pepper, taking over the role in 1945 and staying
until it left the air in 1959. He also had regular roles in such
radio series as ``Big Town'' and ``Gasoline Alley.''
   ``When I got out of college and went back home to New York City I
decided to earn my living as an actor instead of as a teacher,''
Adams says. ``Radio was a good way for an actor to make money
because you could also work in the theater. But around 1960 radio
passed away and many actors moved to Los Angeles.
   ``I didn't want to move here permanently so I went into
commercials. I established a beachhead, mostly doing voices. I
prefer not to be on camera. I still do commercials for a lot of
national and regional accounts.''
   Adams' mellow voice, with a hint of a rasp, is a familiar one
behind commercials. He's the one who says, ``With a name like
Smuckers, it has to be good.''
   Adams was living in Connecticut when the offer came from ``Lou
Grant,'' a spinoff of ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' starring Edward
Asner. Allan Burns, co-creator of the show, had seen Adams in ``The
Deadliest Season,'' in which he played the mean owner of a hockey
club.
   ``I'd just taken a role in `Another World,''' he says. ``It was
my first soap, but the level of actors in it is terrific. They were
all Broadway actors. Then I got the call about `Lou Grant.' I was in
a dilemma. I flew out and met with the producers. I wasn't legally
bound to `Another World,' but I felt ethically bound. They very
graciously gave me my release.''
   Adams says there has been talk of doing a ``Lou Grant'' movie,
but he doubts they could ever get all the people back together
again. ``I would certainly do it,'' he says. ``I think the idea of
writing it is also daunting. The feeling was that the show had a few
more years left when CBS yanked it off the air. So, there's no great
desire to go back.''
   Asner, who was involved in various liberal causes at the time,
has said CBS killed the show because his political positions were
controversial.
   Adams says he likes playing the heavies in films. In the TV movie
``Under Siege,'' he was the ``lean and mean'' presidential
assistant. In the theatrical movie ``F@X,'' he was the corrupt
government official.
   ``Playing the bad guys is fun,'' he says. ``In `F@X' I was bad
news. A smooth and plausible guy, a high honcho in the Justice
Department who was as bent as he could possibly be. I'd love to be
offered another good part like that.''

   John Amos has worked as an advertising
copywriter, a stand-up comic, a variety show writer-performer and
even as a regular on Mary Tyler Moore's popular television sitcom in
which he played Gordy the weatherman.
   But in his more than 20 years in and out of show business, the
broad, powerfully built actor never appeared in a Shakespearean
play. That changed recently with his portrayal of Sir Toby Belch in
``Twelfth Night,'' the opening production of the New York
Shakespeare Festival's annual summer sojourn in Central Park.
   And Amos has found himself in a high-powered company of movie and
theater names that includes Jeff Goldblum, Michelle Pfeiffer, Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Gregory Hines, Stephen Collins and Fisher
Stevens.
   The actor tried out for the role at the urging of James Earl
Jones, a veteran of the Shakespearean repertory and one of the best
Othellos of recent years.
   They were sitting in a trailer last year while working on the
Eddie Murphy movie ``Coming to America,'' when Jones told him, ``If
you don't try Shakespeare, it will just loom as a bigger and more
insurmountable obstacle to you. So you just might as well go ahead
and take your best shot. Treat it as you would another play.''
   ``I had auditioned him before for another play and didn't give
him the role,'' recalls Joseph Papp, head of the New York
Shakespeare Festival. ``But I thought, `Gee, he's an interesting
actor with an imposing figure and good clear speech.' I told him,
`You should look at Shakespeare's plays because there are many roles
you could play.'''
   After reading parts of ``Twelfth Night'' for Papp and director
Harold Guskin, Amos got the role of fun-loving, high-spirited Sir
Toby.
   ``My biggest concern was that I didn't develop an affected
accent,'' Amos recounts.
   Amos, born in Newark, N.J., didn't start out to be an actor. His
big dream was to play football, but nothing came of it.
   His acting career didn't get going until he moved to California.
   ``My entree into show business came because of my writing. During
the day, I was working for an advertising agency in Los Angeles. At
night, I was moonlighting on a local television variety show called
`Lohman and Barkley' as a writer-performer. We'd do 90 minutes of
contemporary comedy and satirical bits.''
   Out of that job came a position as a staff writer on ``The Leslie
Uggams Show,'' a short-lived variety show on CBS in 1969. On it,
Amos helped write what he calls a forerunner of today's situation
comedies about middle-class blacks. It was a 15-minute segment
called ``Sugar Hill,'' in which Miss Uggams played the wife, Lincoln
Kilpatrick her husband and Johnny Brown her brother.
   ```Sugar Hill' taught me a great deal about the structure of
situation comedy,'' he says now. ``So that later, when I got
involved in performing in a situation comedy, I felt I had a slight
edge on some of the other actors.''
   His job on ``The Leslie Uggams Show'' won Amos a role the
following year on a new comedy series starring Mary Tyler Moore. His
role of Gordy the weatherman was his first national recognition.
   Amos had studied acting at a small theater in Los Angeles but he
likes to think he honed his acting skills working as a stand-up
comic in clubs in New York's Greenwich Village in the late '60s.
   ``I wasn't very good,'' he says now. ``But it's the best training
any actor can get, particularly if you use your own material. Then
you can gauge whether or not your perception of what's funny is
funny to the general public.''
   Amos lived in California for about 15 years before coming back to
New York. He was able to support himself by occasional television
series like ``The Tim Conway Comedy Hour'' and ``Future Cop'' as
well as commercials. But he returned to the East Coast and New
Jersey seven years ago to do more theater.
   ``I had started to loose my hustle,'' he says. ``I'm not the kind
of guy who can just lie by the pool waiting for my agent to call.''
   Last year, Amos became artistic director and artist-in-residence
for a theater located in the Grant Avenue Community Center in
Plainfield, N.J., after its mayor, Richard Taylor, asked him to do a
few fund-raisers.
   He also staged the theater's first offering, ``Forever My
Darling,'' a play by Dan Owens. It takes place in the 1950s and
concerns four black women who want to become the first female rhythm
and blues singing group. Amos has even optioned the movie rights.
   Work on commercial projects like the upcoming Sylvester Stallone
movie ``Lock-Up'' gives Amos the financial freedom to spend more
with his fledgling theater.
   ``I think I'm pretty much living the ideal life _ staying here in
the East, so I can be close to my theater, doing, I hope, one
picture a year and as much stage work as possible,'' he says.
``That's the best of both worlds.''

   President Najib spends most of his time
these days trying to sweep away the image of a brutal, repressive
government. He's even been saying neither he nor his close
associates ever were Marxists.
   In his heavily guarded suite in the presidential palace, Najib is
trying to build a new image not only for his government but also for
himself, repudiating almost everything about the 1978 revolution
that installed a pro-Soviet regime in Afghanistan.
   He has been brushing off the Marxist tag for himself and his
associates on the ruling Politburo ever since Soviet troops withdrew
in February.
   He talks about subjects that once were taboo _ the ``big
mistakes'' made before he assumed power in May 1986, ``half-baked''
land and education reform policies launched by his predecessors in
the early years of power.
   ``During the past 11 years the revolution has traversed a
difficult, complicated and dangerous path with shortcomings, haste
and hurry,'' he said in a recent interview with The Associated
Press. ``We have learned big lessons of history. The passage of time
is a great teacher.''
   Since the last Soviet troops withdrew Feb. 15, Najib has adopted
a position that at times sounds as though he would be willing to
step down and leave his People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan
with only a slim guarantee of existence.
   Although the party is communist in structure with a standard
politburo, central committee and youth organization, it advocates a
free-market system and accepts the Islamic religion. Its meetings
begin with readings from the Koran, the Islamic holy book, and Najib
is a regular at Friday prayers and often invokes the name of God in
his speeches.
   Najib says he only seeks the ``16th seat'' at the negotiating
table with the seven Moslem guerrilla groups based in Pakistan and
the eight in Iran that are trying to topple his government.
   He says he's ready to negotiate with the Moslem guerrillas,
through intermediaries, if necessary _ anywhere, anytime and on any
terms.
   But the most extreme of the guerrilla leaders and their main
supporters, the United States and Pakistan, have taken the position
that Najib and key members of his government must go before they
talk peace. They contend the government trampled on ancient social
and religious traditions and created chaos by opening the way for
the Soviet Union's military intervention in December 1979.
   Some of the Moslem guerrillas say they now would favor a
negotiated settlement, but the guerrilla government-in-exile, formed
in Pakistan after the Soviet withdrawal, still insists Najib must go
even if it means more military action.
   Najib says he would resign but maintains that would not end the
conflict, which has already claimed more than 1.3 million lives,
destroyed thousands of villages and forced 5 million people _
one-third of the population _ into exile in Pakistan and Iran.
   ``The departure of a personality or force will not solve
Afghanistan's problems,'' the 43-year-old president said in the
interview. ``That can only be done by sitting down at the table and
talking.''
   His appeals at times exhibit an air of desperation, but most
diplomats in Kabul doubt his government is on the verge of military
or political collapse. On the contrary, they say, Najib's departure
could mean that any coalition government would not survive because
neither members of his party nor the guerrilla leaders have his
power and authority.
   The government has been strengthened by a continuing Soviet
airlift of arms and ammunition. The Soviets have promised to stand
by the Najib government even though the supply costs are enormous,
believed to be about $2 billion a year.
   Najib's soldiers also have been strong and predictions that they
would join the rebels and that the government would collapse after
the Soviet withdrawal have not proved true.
   ``Who is strong and who is weak?'' Najib said. ``Months have gone
by and we're still here. And a year from now, we'll still be here.''
   With the Soviet troops gone, Afghans are looking to this summer
as a season when the government and the guerrillas may finally talk
peace. They yearn for a political settlement that would end daily
hardships.
   Long lines form daily outside bakeries and gasoline stations.
Meat and vegetable prices have skyrocketed as high as 10 times last
year's. Inflation is running at 215 percent, and wages have been
frozen.
   Iran and China, which also backed the guerrillas, are moving
toward supporting a negotiated settlement. Egypt and Turkey have
questioned Washington's policy on Afghanistan. The guerrillas, they
say, lack the battlefield prowess to defeat the government troops
and are so divided among themselves they would be unable to form a
stable government.
   But the United States, which allocated an estimated $600 million
in weapons and other aid to the rebels, says the Kabul government
disqualified itself from talks about Afghanistan's future with the
terror and destruction that was carried out at its behest.
   Rebel leaders claim at least 75,000 people have been killed by
KHAD, the Soviet-style secret police, since the Marxists seized
power April 27, 1978.
   Najib, a physician, headed KHAD for six years before he was
picked in May 1986 to succeed Babrak Karmal, now believed to be
living in the Soviet Union.
   ``I see no reason to rehash the past,'' Najib replied when asked
about KHAD. ``George Bush once headed a similar organization'' _ the
Central Intelligence Agency _ ``and now he's president of the United
States.''
   But Najib's government has started to speak about terror against
its opponents.
   So far, most of the talk is confined to the first 20 months of
the revolutionary regime in 1978-79, when Najib was ambassador to
Iran. Power during that time was held by Nur Mohammad Taraki, who
was smothered with a pillow in a party feud in September 1979 and
whose successor, Hafizullah Amin, was assassinated shortly after the
Soviet troops arrived.
   Government officials say only about 1,000 political prisoners
remain in Pol-e-Charki prison on the outskirts of Kabul. They say
executions, except those ordered by the courts, have stopped.
Diplomats from both Eastern and Western nations say they see no
evidence that summary executions continue.
   The guerrillas, however, contend Afghanistan still holds 12,000
to 15,000 political prisoners, a figure accepted by the
International Committee for the Red Cross.
   ``There have been improvements in the situation. We're not saying
we never made mistakes,'' says Najmuddin Kawyani, a Politburo member
and secretary of the Central Committee.
   ``Prison is not a good thing for anyone,'' said the 42-year-old
Kawyani, who was jailed briefly with Najib for throwing stones at
Vice President Spiro Agnew's car when he visited Afghanistan in 1969
and then for 16 months during Amin's reign.
   However, Kawyani argues, the guerrillas were equally as guilty of
atrocities, killing civil servants and government soldiers who tried
to switch sides but were suspected of being informants.
   ``Why is the United States keeping mum on human rights violations
by the mujahedeen?'' he said.

   More and more Moslem rebels are saying
they would welcome a political solution to the 11-year-old civil war
in Afghanistan.
   ``We hope the battle for Jalalabad is the last battle in
Afghanistan,'' said Massoud, a writer for the Afghan Media Resource
Center, a pro-rebel news agency partially funded by the United
States.
   The rebels, called mujahedeen or Islamic ``holy warriors,'' have
fought government forces to a stalemate at Jalalabad, in eastern
Afghanistan, since Soviet troops ended more than nine years of
involvement in the country Feb. 15.
   Casualties are estimated in the thousands, making it one of the
bloodiest battles of the war.
   The most extreme of the Moslem fundamentalist guerrilla leaders,
however, want no part of a peace agreement that does not give power
to their self-proclaimed ``interim'' Afghan government, a
cabinet-in-exile composed of a seven-party mujahedeen alliance with
headquarters in this Pakistani frontier city.
   Pakistan backs the rebels with help from the United States and
shelters more than 3 million Afghan war refugees.
   Critics of the guerrilla regime, formed in February, charge that
it is not representative of the majority of Afghans.
   A large number of anti-government Afghans favor the return from
exile of their former monarch, King Zahir Shah, to head a
transitional administration that would guide the country to peace.
Zahir Shah was ousted in 1973 by the military, which then
established the republic that was overthrown by the Marxists in 1978.
   Rasul Sayyaf, prime minister of the mujahedeen government and
leader of the hardline Ittehad-i-Islami rebel party, rails at
proposals for a negotiated settlement.
   ``It should be clear that any attempt to solve the Afghan issue
against the wishes and decisions of the mujahedeen will not only be
futile but would also have negative repercussions on Afghanistan and
the region as a whole,'' he said in a statement issued from his
Peshawar office.
   ``If the world community wants to end bloodshed in Afghanistan
they should put pressure on the Russians to stop ... propping up a
regime which is totally unacceptable to the Afghan nation.''
   Some rebel leaders say they are stockpiling weapons and planning
attacks on Kabul, the Afghan capital, and other key cities.
   The guerrilla offensives that usually herald winter's end haven't
happened this year, except for the attempt to take Jalalabad.
   ``No one wants to fight,'' said Massoud, who uses only one name.
``Everyone wants a peaceful solution. Zahir Shah does have
popularity as opposed to rebel leaders who want a military
solution.''
   But one Afghan intellectual, who asked not to be identified, said
an alternative to Zahir Shah would be to have Afghan politicians who
belonged to earlier non-communist cabinets take over until
elections, monitored by the United Nations, can be held.

<HEAD>Chronology of Supreme Court Abortion Decisions</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: This item will be released with the Supreme Court's abortion
decision.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of the Supreme Court's
major abortion decisions:
   _Jan. 22, 1973. In Roe vs. Wade, the court for the first time
legalized abortion nationwide. The court, in an opinion by Justice
Harry A. Blackmun, based its 7-2 ruling on a woman's constitutional
right to privacy.
   The court said a woman's decision to have an abortion during the
first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor.
It said states may impose certain regulations during the second
trimester to protect the woman's health, and may take steps to
protect fetal life in the third trimester. State authority to
regulate abortions after the first trimester was not made absolute,
however.
   _Jan. 22, 1973. In Roe vs. Bolton, the court that same day struck
down by a 7-2 vote restrictions on facilities that could be used to
perform abortions. The decision gave rise to a new kind of medical
facility, the abortion clinic.
   _July 1, 1976. In Planned Parenthood vs. Danforth, the court, by
a 6-3 vote, said states cannot give husbands veto power over their
pregnant wives' decision to abort their pregnancies. By a 5-4 vote,
the court said that neither can parents of minor, unwed girls be
given an absolute veto over abortions.
   _June 20, 1977. In Maher vs. Roe, the court ruled 6-3 that states
have no legal obligation to pay for ``non-therapeutic'' abortions.
   _Jan. 9, 1979. In Colautti vs. Franklin, reached by a 6-3 vote,
the court reaffirmed its intention to give doctors broad discretion
in determining the timing of ``fetal viability'' _ when a fetus can
live outside the mother's womb. The justices said states may seek to
protect a fetus that has reached viability, but the determination is
up to doctors, not courts or legislatures.
   _July 2, 1979. In Bellotti vs. Baird, the court by an 8-1 vote
elaborated on its parental consent decision of 1976. It implied that
states may be able to require a pregnant, unmarried minor to obtain
parental consent to an abortion so long as the state law provides an
alternative procedure to parental approval, such as letting the
minor seek a state judge's approval instead.
   _June 30, 1980. In Harris vs. McRae, the so-called Hyde Amendment
was upheld by a 5-4 vote. The court said the federal government and
individual states are under no legal obligation to pay for even
medically necessary abortions sought by women receiving welfare.
   _March 23, 1981. In H.L. vs. Matheson, the court ruled by a 6-3
vote that states may require doctors consulted by some girls _ those
still dependent on their parents and too ``immature'' to decide such
matters for themselves _ to try to inform parents before performing
a requested abortion.
   _June 15, 1983. In three decisions called City of Akron vs. Akron
Center for Reproductive Health, Planned Parenthood of Kansas City
vs. Ashcroft and Simopolous vs. Virginia, the court, in a 6-3
ruling, said states and local communities may not require that all
abortions for women more than three months pregnant be performed in
a hospital.
   The court also struck down regulations that, among other things,
imposed a 24-hour waiting period between the signing of an abortion
consent form and the medical procedure and required doctors to tell
women seeking an abortion that a fetus is a ``human life.''
   _June 11, 1986. In Thornburgh vs. American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the court voted 5-4 to strike down
Pennsylvania abortion regulations somewhat similar to those it
invalidated in 1983. The court said states may not require doctors
to inform women seeking abortions about potential risks and about
available medical assistance benefits for prenatal care and
childbirth.
   In that decision, the court also struck down requirements that
doctors performing third-trimester abortions, which are rare, use
procedures least risky to a fetus capable of surviving outside the
womb, and that two doctors always be present for abortions performed
in the third trimester. Also invalidated was a regulation requiring
doctors to make a record, which could become available to the
public, of every abortion they perform.
   _Dec. 14, 1987. In Hartigan vs. Zbaraz, the court split 4-4. The
effect was to invalidate an Illinois law that could have made
abortions more difficult to obtain for some teen-agers.
   The decision was announced two months before Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy joined the court and replaced Justice Lewis F. Powell, who
had retired the previous June.

<TEXT>
   Missouri's abortion statute quickly
drew a legal attack after it passed in 1986 and a federal court
blocked its implementation even before it took effect.
   That was what supporters wanted. The law was passed with the
intention of making it a vehicle for challenging the U.S. Supreme
Court's Roe vs. Wade decision of 1973, which legalized abortions.
   The Missouri case drew national attention, and a flood of briefs
for and against abortion poured into the Supreme Court, which heard
arguments on the issue last April.
   The law, drafted with the help of the Missouri Catholic
Conference, was the Missouri Legislature's third effort to restrict
abortions since the 1973 decision. Parts of a 1974 law enacted to
get around Roe vs. Wade were overturned by the Supreme Court in
1976. Another law requiring that abortions during the fourth to
sixth months of pregnancy be conducted in hospitals was overturned
in 1983.
   The Legislature voted overwhelmingly to pass the latest law,
which restricted the availability of abortions and defined life as
beginning at conception.
   State Rep. Jim Barnes, a Democrat who was one of the law's
sponsors, said legislators intentionally passed a measure that would
be challenged, so that the abortion issue could be reviewed by the
current Supreme Court, seen as more conservative than the one that
decided Roe vs. Wade.
   Republican Gov. John Ashcroft, a strong abortion opponent, signed
the bill, which was to have taken effect Aug. 13, 1986. But
Reproductive Health Services of St. Louis, Planned Parenthood of
Greater Kansas City and others filed suit in July in U.S. District
Court in Kansas City seeking to overturn the law.
   On July 31, 1986, U.S. District Judge Scott Wright ordered the
state not to enforce the statute until the lawsuit could be heard. A
four-day trial was held the following December.
   The case became known as ``Webster vs. Reproductive Health
Services,'' after one of the plaintiffs and Missouri Attorney
General William Webster.
   Wright struck down major portions of the law in March 1987, and
the state appealed to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St.
Louis. The appeals court struck down most of the law last July,
saying it conflicted with Roe vs. Wade.
   In addition to declaring that human life begins at conception,
the law said no public funds, employees or facilities could be used
to perform or assist in an abortion or to counsel a woman to have an
abortion.
   The appeals court upheld a provision in the law banning the use
of taxpayer money for performing or assisting an abortion. But it
ruled use of a public facility or the services of a public employee
could not be banned if all such costs were reimbursed by a patient.
   The appeals court also threw out the definition of life beginning
at conception, saying it was unconstitutional for a state to adopt
one theory of when human life begins.
   Among the record 78 friend-of-the court briefs filed with the
Supreme Court was one signed by 127 Missouri lawmakers asking the
justices to uphold the state's law and allow each state to determine
what its abortion laws should be.
   According to that brief, Missouri passed its first abortion law
in 1825, and from 1835 until 1973 the state prohibited abortions
except when necessary to save the mother's life.
   The Missouri Department of Health says 17,382 abortions were
performed statewide last year, 17,574 in 1987, 19,039 in 1986 and
19,482 in 1985. It says all the abortions were performed in private
facilities.

<HEAD>Eds: This item will be released with the Supreme Court's abortion
decision.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Throughout the 1980s, about 1.5 million
abortions have been performed on American women each year, according
to a private survey.
   The number climbed steadily after the 1973 Supreme Court decision
legalizing abortion _ from about 750,000 to more than a million by
1976, the survey showed.
   Who are the women seeking and obtaining abortions? The following
statistics have been reported by The Alan Guttmacher Institute, a
New York-based organization that studies reproductive issues:
   _Women in their 20s obtain more than half of all reported
abortions, about 55 percent. About 24 percent are obtained by
teen-agers _ 14 percent by those aged 18 or 19.
   _About 42 percent are obtained by Protestants; about 31 percent
by Catholics. Less than 2 percent are obtained by Jewish women.
About 22 percent of those obtaining abortions belong to no religious
denomination.
   _Women with family incomes below $11,000 accounted for one-third
of all abortions. That group comprises about 29 percent of all women
of child-bearing age.
   _White women have 68.6 percent of all abortions. But non-white
women, who make up 16.7 percent of the childbearing-age population,
have 31.4 percent of all abortions.
   _About 63 percent of the women obtaining abortions are unmarried.
   _Unmarried women living with a man constitute 17.4 percent of the
abortion clients. They make up only 3.4 percent of all
childbearing-age women.
   _Women attending school, who number about one-fifth of the
childbearing-age population, obtain 31 percent of the abortions each
year.

   Computers, oil wells and children
scurrying with school bags have replaced assault rifles, rubble and
teen-age combat soldiers in Chad, a nation that has seen little but
strife and war since independence from France in 1960.
   With the guns silent since 1987 except for a few lingering
skirmishes, the central African nation has begun to tackle the
monumental problems of economic survival and development.
   Until very recently, international and bilateral aid programs
were here to distribute emergency food to relieve hunger and counter
other effects of guerrilla war and conflict with neighboring Libya,
as well as a disastrous drought in 1984. Now they are here to extend
aid for long-term economic recovery.
   The computers, incongruous in a country where 85 percent of the
estimated 5 million people are subsistence farmers and less than a
quarter of all children attend school, are playing an essential role.
   A senior official for the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID) said the computers gather the information that
allows the most effective allocation of resources.
   Computer programmers funded by the U.S. Bureau of Census and
USAID, for example, plan to help the government of President Hissene
Habre conduct the nation's first census next year.
   The United States gave $18.57 million in bilateral economic aid
to Chad this year, while all foreign assistance in 1987 amounted to
$200 million. Much of the aid helped the government pay operating
costs and salaries of civil servants, teachers and public officials.
   Gueralbaye Koumadoum, a 37-year-old secondary school teacher who
worked without pay in the worst years of the war and its aftermath,
began to receive his full monthly salary, the equivalent of $368, in
January.
   ``Things are much better now,'' he said. ``But many students
can't afford things like paper and pens, and owning a book is a real
luxury.''
   Just for shared textbooks parents must pay $8 a month for each
primary school child and $16 for every secondary school student.
   A landlocked country that has long been an East-West crossroads
in the heart of Africa, Chad is classified by the World Bank as one
of the world's 10 poorest nations. Its annual per capita income is
$125.
   When the bottom dropped out of the world cotton market four years
ago, Chad, the largest producer of cotton in west and central
Africa, lost nearly half its normal foreign currency revenue.
   One bright spot now is oil, with reports that two wells have
begun limited production. Neither the government nor representatives
of Esso, which operates a concession north of Lake Chad, would
confirm or deny the reports.
   A World Bank-financed micro-refinery is expected to produce most
of the petroleum the country needs by the early 1990s.
   Enough petroleum to meet almost 50 percent of Chad's needs is now
smuggled from neighboring Nigeria, the remainder imported through
legal channels.
   France, the single most important donor, this year provided Chad
with $83.3 million in budgetary support, technical assistance and
development and military aid.
   According to figures from private French sources, Chad has only
13,000 salaried employees. About 7,000 houses and offices are hooked
up to electric power lines and 10,000 have water meters.
   Ten percent of the government's current $83.5-million budget
comes from taxes levied on the sale of Gala beer, one of the
country's leading manufactured products.
   Despite the monetary poverty, the towns and villages of Chad do
not seem mired in the misery that characterizes many other African
cities.
   ``I know it's a contradiction,'' said Diego Berriot, a World
Health Organization representative, ``but although Chad is among the
poorest of the African countries, the life is not nearly as
miserable as elsewhere on the continent.''
   Government figures indicate this year's harvest of cereal grains,
including mainstays millet and sorghum, will reach 800,000 tons,
about enough to make Chad self-sufficient in food, President Habre
said in a June 7 speech marking his seventh year in power.
   The World Bank, which has provided $156 million in aid since
1984, says in its latest report that ``the overwhelming impression
is that Chadian entrepreneurs have a wealth of ideas and dynamic
entrepreneurial spirit'' but are severely hampered by a shortage of
capital and technology.
   Since 1982 when Habre defeated rival armed factions and declared
himself head of state, much of Chad's foreign aid has been in grants
or nearly interest-free loans.
   In 1979, civil war broke out among the 11 groups that made up the
shaky Government of National Union. This was complicated in late
1980 by the incursion of Libyan troops on the side of Goukouni
Oueddei, Habre's chief rival for power and one of the major
belligerants.
   The Libyans withdrew suddenly in November 1981, leaving Goukouni
seriously weakened. In June 1982, Habre's forces entered N'Djamena,
bringing the main war to an end.
   But sporadic fighting among rebellious army units continued in
the south until early 1985, and Goukouni's Libyan-backed forces in
north finally were defeated in July 1987 with the help of French
ground and air forces sent to Chad in 1983.

   Reports still crop up periodically, however, of skirmishes
between government troops and what are described as ``rebels.''
   On April 13 the government announced it had put down a rebellion
and that three prominent members of Habre's administration had fled.
   Information Minister Adoum Moussa Seif said in a recent interview
that the April 1-2 incident occurred when the government uncovered a
scheme to smuggle arms to Libyan-backed rebels based in western
Sudan.
   London-based Amnesty International issued a report June 22 saying
that at least 100 people arrested in the incident ``may face torture
and illegal execution.''
   Moussa Seif said ``a number of people were taken in for
questioning'' but added that he believed most had been released.
   Chadians still wonder how long it will be before their future can
be unlinked from the plans of Col. Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan
leader.
   Since Gadhafi came to power 20 years ago, Libya has been enmeshed
in Chad's internal affairs, supporting a rainbow of anti-government
factions and tendencies over the years.
   A U.S. State Department publication on aid to Chad says 7,000
Libyan troops remain in the Aouzou Strip, a 45,600-square-mile area
between the two countries occupied by Libya since 1973. The
publication adds that Chad's ``continued resistence to Libyan
aggression helps contain Libya's expansionist ambitions, curb its
aggression and terrorism and reduce Libyan prestige and influence in
sub-Saharan Africa.''
   Chad is strategically situated between Libya to the north and
Zaire to the south and between Nigeria in the west and Sudan in the
east.
   The United States, which has backed Habre ever since Libya sent
troops into Chad in 1980, furnishes military aid to Chad and Chadian
military personnel train in the United States.
   Meanwhile, Habre says, a committee of leading Chadians was
putting the finishing touches on a draft constitution that he hoped
would be put to a vote before the end of the year. The document, he
added, would ``provide a more solid basis for democratic rights in
Chad.''
   Despite economic problems, some Chadians are optimistic.
   Among them are Abdel Hamid, a 20-year-old shepherd, and his
grandmother, Fatima, who look forward to the paving of a road
running out of N'Djamena.
   The house from which they make their living selling goat cheese
is on the road 12 miles northwest of the capital.
   ``There's no point in moving to town to sell because then people
won't think our cheese is fresh,'' Hamid said. ``So when the road is
done, people can come to us all year round and not worry about the
rains.''
   Even in N'Djamena the streets turn to mud in the rainy season.
   Health is another area where international aid has come into play.
   Dr. Issaline Greindl, a Belgian specialist in tropical medicine,
is using computers in a Harvard University-sponsored project to
identify Chad's major health problems and allocate resources.
   ``In 1985 no one even knew how many health facilities there were
in the country,'' she said, ``but now we are receiving about 310
standardized reports a month which represents about 90 percent of
the facilities.''
   Chad's basic health problems are fevers, including malaria,
respiratory problems and diarrhea, either avoidable or treatable
with minimum infrastructure and medication.
   The average life expectancy still is in the mid-30s, but in
statistical health reports anyone who survives past the age of 5 is
considered an adult.

   ``True Believer'' (RCA-Columbia Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95.
Rated R)
   
   ``True Believer'' is fun to watch. Unfortunately, it is not
believable.
   James Woods plays, with his trademark intensity, Eddie Dodd, a
pioneering civil rights lawyer who lost his 1960s spirit on the way
to the '80s. He finds himself defending mostly drug dealers, and
defending himself for doing so.
   Along comes a young lawyer, Roger (Robert Downey Jr.), who
worships Dodd's earlier work, and an 8-year-old murder case in which
the defendant might actually be innocent. Dodd is reluctant to take
the case, and Roger sneers, ``It was close, huh? We almost defended
someone who wasn't a drug dealer.''
   But Dodd plunges into the case, and he also finds he's fighting
public corruption and various urban evils.
   The problem with the movie, directed by Joseph Ruben, is that
instead of taking a close look at Dodd's disillusionment, or at the
relationship between Dodd and Roger, ``True Believer'' takes the
easy way out and goes for the thrills.
   For starters, the old murder is recreated, Dodd is beaten up by a
phony white supremacist, and there's a crazy and dangerous chase
through a plumbing supply factory. On the good side, the ending is
clever.
   Downey is fine, as is Yuji Okumoto playing the convict and
Margaret Colin as a private detective.

   ``The Midnight Hour'' (Vidmark, VHS-Beta, $89.95)
   
   ``The Midnight Hour'' is a good little vampire, witches and
ghouls tale starring Shari Belafonte-Harper as a witch who brings
terror to a small town on Halloween.
   Although there are recognizable names in the movie, the acting
leaves much to be desired. Co-starring are: Levar Burton, Lee
Montgomery, Dick Van Patten, Kevin McCarthy, Jonelle Allen, Dedee
Pfeifer and Cindy Morgan.
   And for a horror flick, the chills are as lacking as the thespian
skills.
   Nonetheless, it is still an enjoyable romp as the the town's
cemetery residents climb out of their graves and munch, rip and
mutilate their way through the night, joining trick-or-treaters and
crashing a halloween party.
   The game then becomes how to get the baddies back in the grave
and the townsfolk back to normal. Along the way, there are a few
chuckles.
   And despite all its flaws, ``The Midnight Hour'' is an adequate
little horror flick for a rainy Saturday afternoon.

   ``The Telluride Sessions'' (MCA) _ Strength in Numbers
   
   Innovation and bluegrass are uneasy companions. But the all-star
band Strength in Numbers is proof that the banjo, dobro, bass,
fiddle and mandolin can break new ground.
   ``The Telluride Sessions'' combines bluegrass instrumentation
with New Age melodies and classical-music arrangements, and the
result is a pleasure to hear.
   These guys aren't just any pickers. Sam Bush on mandolin and Bela
Fleck on banjo are members of the New Grass Revival, one of the best
progressive bluegrass bands. Mark O'Connor (on fiddle, guitar and
mandolin), Jerry Douglas (dobro) and Edgar Meyer (bass) are also
terrific instrumentalists.
   But for their first record together, these inventive virtuosos
decided to emphasize ensemble playing rather than solos. Themes are
developed by unusual instrumental combinations _ two violins and a
bowed bass, for example, on the beautiful ``One Winter's Night.''
Counterpoint and dynamics, rarely important in bluegrass music, are
explored to great effect. The band has a lot of fun with
syncopation, too.
   ``The Telluride Sessions'' isn't without dazzling solos. O'Connor
(on guitar) and Fleck play with breathless speed on ``Slopes.''
O'Connor and Bush stage a mandolin duel on ``Macedonia.''
   But the star of record may be its most unheralded participant.
Meyer performs tricks on the bass that will leave listeners shaking
their head, and he had a hand in most of the strongest compositions,
including the good-humored ``Pink Flamingos'' and the pensive ``No
Apologies.''

<TEXT>
   Agnes Varda compares filmmaking to cutting open
an apple and seeing what's inside. She likes to find fresh ways to
examine everyday life.
   One of the most influential directors of the French New Wave, the
61-year-old Varda has depicted a young carpenter torn between two
women (``Happiness''), a drifter amidst the peasants and bums of
South France (``Vagabond'') and the friendship of two women over 15
years (``One Sings, the Other Doesn't'').
   Sometimes her films are broad in scope; ``Salut les Cubains''
(``Salute the Cubans'') is a 1963 documentary of the Cuban
Revolution, and ``The Black Panthers'' examines the radical 1960s
organization.
   In ``Cleo From 5 to 7,'' a pseudo-documentary of two hours in the
life of a glamorous pop singer who may have cancer, she focuses on
the tiniest details.
   Her new film, ``Kung Fu Master,'' is a different view altogether:
a love triangle involving a 15-year-old boy, a 40-year-old woman and
a brand new video game. The idea was suggested to Varda by her
friend Jane Birkin, who stars as 40-year-old Mary Jane.
   ``Do you know how love begins between people, between human
beings?'' Varda asked. ``Love is made up of a series of bad or good
reasons which come to a point.
   ``Maybe she's lonely at the time. She's had two husbands. Maybe
she likes the boy as a mother. Maybe nobody's looking at her and
that little boy looks at her. Maybe she wants to go back to her own
adolescence. There are many reasons at that moment of her life.''
   Birkin is married to the French director Jacques Demy, and their
son, Mathieu, portrays the young boy whose interest in Mary Jane is
balanced by his passion for the ``Kung Fu Master'' video game.
   ``It's the last days of a child,'' Varda said. ``The last months
of being not yet a man. The feeling that it's coming and it's not
yet there. There's a real frustration at that age. They want so much
to be men, and it's not yet here.''
   Varda was born in Ixelles, a suburb of Brussels, and went to
Paris after World War II to pursue classical studies at the Lycee
Victor-Duruy. Courses at the Ecole du Louvre stimulated her interest
in painting and sculpture and she also took night classes at the
Vaugirard School of Photography.
   In 1951, she was appointed official photographer of the Theatre
National Populaire, and remained in that position for the next
decade.
   During that time, she made her debut film. Though Varda had no
interest in film as a child, she remembered having a ``head full of
movie images'' and decided to write a scenario. She rented a house
on the coast and filmed ``La Pointe Courte,'' released in 1955.
   The film took its title from a fishing village to which a young
man and his Parisian wife return, hoping to save their marriage.
Varda contrasted the young couple's story with the local villagers'
struggle to survive, eventually linking the two seemingly disparate
ways of life.
   She deliberately used a real fishing village, wanting to give the
film the look of a documentary. ``I've always been using reality as
a texture to understand better. I like for stories to look true.''
   Although a failure at the box office, ``La Pointe Courte'' was a
major influence on other French directors, notably Alain Resnais,
who edited the movie and cited it as an influence on his 1959
classic, ``Hiroshima Mon Amour.''
   She made several documentary shorts, but inadequate funds
prevented Varda from making her next feature, ``Cleo From 5 to 7,''
until 1961.
   Backed by French businessman Georges de Beauregard, who had
supported Jean-Luc Godard's ``Breathless,'' the film studied Cleo's
evolvement from a shallow pop star to an authentic human being
capable of understanding pain in herself and others.
   ``Cleo'' was again praised by critics and was a commercial
success as well, building anticipation for ``Happiness,'' which won
the Silver Bear award at the 1965 Berlin Festival and used Mozart
for background music.
   ``I'm full of cliches like everybody,'' the filmmaker said. ``I
used Mozart's music because he gives me that feeling of happiness
and death. It's never intellectual, I just feel strongly about it.''
   Her biggest success since came in 1985 with ``Vagabond,'' which
earned raves for young Sandrine Bonnaire, who played the title role.
   ``Vagabond,'' like much of Varda's best work, managed to fund
humor and hope in even the grimmest aspects of life.
   ``I'll never be a bum, I hope, but I could be near them enough so
I can speak to them and let them express feelings of anger and put
them in the film,'' Varda said. ``It's not a documentary, but I
could approach them enough to not betray them, not make them
ridiculous or too much to take. Just show what they are.
   ``She (Bonnaire) is a survivor, not a victim. Life is varied; it
can't be totally sad.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Theme Parks May Become Museums of the Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By REBECCA MARTIN EVARTS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BARCELONA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Museums of the future will have to draw
more on Walt Disney than the Renaissance if they are to attract
visitors, ensure sources of funding and survive competition from
theme parks.
   ``Museums must change from self-centered to client-centered
environments,'' says George F. MacDonald, director of the Canadian
Museum of Civilization. ``They must market themselves not only as
educational but also as meaningful leisure-time activity.''
   MacDonald was one of half a dozen experts who spoke at a recent
symposium on museums sponsored by the Caixa de Pensions Foundation
and the Cultural Olympics, part of the 1992 Summer Olympics
organized by the city of Barcelona.
   People already spend more time on visits to theme parks than on
trips to museums _ an average of eight hours as compared to 50
minutes, according to statistics provided at the symposium.
   But interest in museums appears to be on the increase, said
Kenneth Hudson, director of the European Museum of the Year Award.
He added, however, that government and foundation funding, on which
so many museums depend, is shrinking as public budgets are tightened
and costs rise, forcing them to become more self-supporting.
   Museums of the future will have to borrow techniques from the
successful theme parks such as extensive sensory stimulation through
lights, graphics and color as well as live performances, constant
change and updating of attractions, film presentations on giant
screens and attractive boutiques selling related merchandise.
   But museums need not sacrifice their traditional role of
educating and providing well-researched and accurate information,
MacDonald said, when improving on attention to the needs and
interests of their visitors.
   Many museum curators would put up enormous resistance to such
changes, he acknowledged.
   ``They have comfortable niches there, and they don't like the
earth trembling under their feet,'' MacDonald said. ``But I think
the future is equally bleak if they don't respond because their
funding will shrink every year, and eventually they'll be running
empty museums with no operating budget.''
   Margaret J. King, a specialist in American popular culture at
Philadelphia's Thomas Jefferson University, said part of the change
will require museums to fuse popular culture with the elite culture
that has been their traditional domain.
   In order to attract visitors inside, the experts said, museums of
the future will have to offer greatly expanded leisure facilities
such as full-service restaurants, theaters, conference facilities
and reception rooms big enough to accommodate weddings or perfume
and other marketing launches.
   And they will have to be visually exciting and welcoming, rather
than monumental and intimidating.
   Visitors reared on television will be more readily drawn to
exhibits where information is displayed on TV screens than on
printed labels, and video-computer hookups will be used to allow
museumgoers to request additional information that is specifically
suited to their interests.
   Because visitors will be able to control the information, museums
will be able to present several interpretations of an exhibit or
object, permitting the viewer to come to his or her own conclusions.
   Science museums, maritime museums and museums of human
civilization have been among the first to make use of theme park
techniques.
   At Barcelona's Maritime Museum, housed in the 14th century Royal
Shipyards building on the Mediterranean waterfront, the 180 symposim
participants were able to see some of the principles of the modern
museum put into practice.
   For example, the recent remodeling is concentrating on
highlighting valuable but poorly lighted exhibits such as the
life-size replica of the Juan de Austria, Spain's flagship in the
1517 Battle of Lepanto, with halogen focus lamps or fluorescent
strip lighting that draws the visitor closer to the objects.
   The three-year-old City of Science and Industry in Paris' La
Villette neighborhood was billed by its president Roger Lesgards as
a ``cultural enterprise'' offering the visitor the opportunity to
simulate flying an Airbus jet, watch a living fetus as it develops
or climb inside the Ariane rocket.
   If this fails to hold one's interest, the visitor can stroll the
136 acres of park surrounding the museum, visit one of the four bars
or three shops, change money at the bank, play the
discovery-through-play Inventorium for children or do some research
with 190,000 reference works.
   But directors and curators of fine and decorative arts museums
have been slower to welcome the Disney-like atmosphere into their
marble halls.
   ``Art museums still contrive to make visitors feel that they are
studying for an examination or should be,'' said Hudson, who is no
friend of theme parks. He believes the museum of the future will
have to become a grassroots social center where the atmosphere
surrounding the objects may be more important than the objects
themselves.
   In MacDonald's view, the art museum of the future will have to
pay more attention to creating a context for the art and to
revealing the codes of meaning contained in the work of many
artists, especially contemporary ones.
   ``One of the most effective ways of doing that is to have
presentations that look through the eyes of the artist,'' he said.
   Ernest J. Hugh de Samper, senior director of government and media
relations for Colonial Williamsburg, said most museum people resent
the theme park as an interloper.
   ``For them, the real thing is the real thing,'' he said. ``But
like detente, it (the theme park) must be recognized. We must adapt
our activities to make the best of our assets while keeping up with
the competition.''

   In the late 1970s, Donna Summer ruled as Disco
Queen of the music world. But she turned in her tiara once
breakdancing out-hustled the hustle.
   Summer made headlines in 1980 by signing with the newly-formed
Geffen record label, whose founder, David Geffen, had successfully
promoted Jackson Browne, the Eagles and Joni Mitchell.
   It seemed like a perfect match. Summer was coming off a
phenomenal string of hit singles, including ``Bad Girls,'' ``On the
Radio'' and ``Hot Stuff.'' Geffen was a widely respected executive
(Browne still thanks him on each of his records) who also signed
Elton John, Neil Young and John Lennon.
   But something went wrong. Many of the big names soon became
unhappy and left. Summer's first record for Geffen, ``The
Wanderer,'' went gold, but her sales later fell off. By the
mid-'80s, she was seeking her release from the label.
   ``It wasn't working,'' she recalled in a recent interview. ``It
wasn't that we hated each other, it just wasn't working. They didn't
really have the facilities to promote someone like me. It was
frustrating.''
   Her major success of the decade came in 1983 with the album,
``She Works Hard for the Money.'' The title track was a Top 10
smash, an anthem for working women. ``Unconditional Love,'' a
collaboration with the reggae group Musical Youth, was also a major
hit.
   The record came out on Polygram.
   Summer had flops as well, ``Cats Without Claws,'' and ``All
Systems Go''; when she completed work on ``Another Place and Time,''
Geffen refused to release it.
   ``David said he didn't like the album. He said he wasn't going to
put it out and I could sue him if I wanted to,'' she said. ``I
thought, `Oh, great, then I'll go. This is the chance I've been
waiting for, I don't want to be here.'''
   She signed with Atlantic Records, and ``This Time I Know It's for
Real,'' the debut single, soon reached the Top 10. The album,
recorded in London, was produced and written by the team of Mike
Stock, Matt Aitken and Peter Waterman, who have also worked with
Rick Astley and Bananarama.
   ``The guys who produced me are very commercial minded, much more
than I am,'' she said. ``As an artist and a writer you tend to want
to do what you want to do. There's a time you need to be commercial,
that's the whole object: to sell records, enough to be on a label.
You need somebody to kind of monitor your sense of creativity.''
   Summer usually contributes her own material, but admitted to
getting sidetracked by more ``creative'' pursuits.
   ``I got very involved in seeing polo played. One of my best
friends, her husband is captain of Prince Charles' polo team.
   ``I had to go,'' she said with a laugh. ``I couldn't say no. You
don't get these chances all the time in life. Every week we went up
there for about two days. I had such a ball, and I don't get to take
a lot of vacations because of my kids.''
   Summer, who was born in 1948 in Boston, became the soloist in her
church choir by age 10.
   ``There was no question I would be a singer, I just always knew.
I had credit in my neighborhood, people would lend me money and tell
me to pay it back when I got famous.''
   She began cashing in with ``Love to Love You Baby,'' a No. 1 hit
in 1975 that helped open the disco era.
   For the next four years, she was everywhere. Eight singles in the
Top 10, three reaching No. 1, and three consecutive chart-topping
double albums: ``Live and More,'' ``Bad Girls'' and ``On the Radio,
Greatest Hits I and II.''
   But Summer was never comfortable with the ``Disco Queen'' label.
Musically, she began to change in 1979 with ``Hot Stuff,'' which had
a tough, rock 'n' roll beat.
   ``I grew up on rock 'n' roll,'' said Summer, who later covered a
Bruce Springsteen song, ``Protection.''
   ``I like the Moody Blues, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones as
well as Aretha Franklin, Dionne Warwick, the Supremes and
Temptations. I didn't know many white kids who didn't know the
Supremes; I don't know many black kids who don't know the Moody
Blues.''
   And who would have guessed that the voice behind so many dance
floor hits secretly longed for a house in the country?
   ``When I was a kid, I studied agriculture,'' said Summer, who
lives with her husband, Bruce Sudano, and three daughters on a
California farm. ``I wanted to do agriculture. I always had a sense
of wanting to live on a farm, just being free to walk and have no
people around. I wanted to have a space where I didn't have to be
anything for anybody.''
   Summer is anxious to attract a young audience, but concedes that
today's kids would rather dance to Madonna. So what happened to the
kids who danced to ``Bad Girls'' in 1979?
   ``They're having kids,'' Summer said, ``and I'm going to hope
their kids are buying records.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Bill Anderson Swears Off Songs Glorifying Drinking</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Veteran TV and country music entertainer
Bill Anderson, whose wife was almost killed in a traffic accident,
says he will never again perform songs about alcoholic beverages.
   Becky Anderson, 43, suffered brain damage and was given just a
50-50 chance to live after her car was struck head on by a truck
driven by a drunken driver in 1984.
   Bill recounts the incident, and several other personal setbacks,
in his new autobiography ``Whisperin' Bill.'' The book, published by
Longstreet Press, takes its title from Anderson's nickname.
   The 461-page book marks another career milestone for Anderson,
who has been a Grand Ole Opry singer, award-winning songwriter, soap
opera actor, network game show host, record producer and businessman.
   Anderson said his wife's accident, from which she has almost
fully recovered, has made him realize the danger of drinking and
driving. He's sworn off performing songs about drinking, tunes that
are a mainstay of country music.
   ``This has really opened up my eyes to the fact it is very
real,'' he said. ``I don't think before this happened that I was as
sensitive to it as I am now. Before, I thought it was just something
you sang about and you kind of lived your life as you wanted to.
   ``Now, I will not sing a drinking song.''
   The Andersons filed a $4 million civil lawsuit after the
accident. A Nashville jury awarded them $1.2 million, but a judge
reduced the award to $825,000. At the time, the $1.2 million was the
largest amount ever awarded in Nashville.
   ``The whole thing that happened to her was so senseless,'' the
51-year-old Anderson said in an interview. ``It didn't have to
happen, yet it did. I can't blame it on anything other than the fact
he (the other driver, celebrating his 18th birthday) was drunk.''
   The accident happened after Anderson had enjoyed one of the most
successful and diverse careers among Nashville entertainers.
   Anderson had been co-host of the ABC game show ``The Better
Sex,'' had appeared periodically for three years on the soap opera
``One Life to Live'' and also acted in television's ``Alias Smith
and Jones'' and ``The Men.''
   He appeared frequently on other TV game shows such as ``Hollywood
Squares'' and ``The Match Game.'' Anderson had recorded more than 40
country music albums and won more than 50 awards for song writing.
He had appeared regularly on the Grand Ole Opry since 1961.
   But the accident wasn't the only tragedy faced by the Andersons.
Daughter Terri, now 28, was diagnosed as having cancer, he lost
millions as an investor in a restaurant chain and his own health
declined because of a debilitating back problem that kept him on
pain medication for months.
   ``These things kept happening and you wake up every day and hope
the last straw is on the camel's back and nothing else will
happen,'' Anderson said.
   Finally, life is looking up again. The accident and recovery
strengthened his strained marriage. The restaurant chain is on the
rebound and doctors are optimistic that the cancer in Terri was
caught in time.
   Anderson, whose best known songs are ``Still'' and ``City
Lights,'' said writing the book was therapeutic.
   ``When everything came down as hard and fast as it did, I had so
much built up it just had to come out,'' he said.
   Anderson said the adversity ``made me realize how blessed I had
been all my life, that I really had lived a charmed life up until
then. It made me thankful and more grateful for that. You take
things like good health for granted.
   ``I think the biggest effect overall was in my priorities,'' he
said. ``Things that I thought were important were not and things I
didn't think were important were more important than I had ever
realized, such as my family.
   ``I had put career ahead of family at times, but I don't think
I'll do that any more.
   ``I learned about determination, especially from watching what
Becky did (during recovery). There never has been a human being more
determined.''
   In writing the book, he learned quickly that it's more work than
composing a song. ``You write a song and you write one page and
you're finished. With a book, you're just getting started.''
   Anderson said he got some good advice from fellow Grand Ole Opry
star Jan Howard, who also recently wrote an autobiography.
   ``She said when you mention frying the onions, you have got to
make them smell the onions.''

<BYLINE>At the Movies: ``Do the Right Thing'' ^By DOLORES BARCLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Arts Editor</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   When Island Pictures released ``She's Gotta Have It,'' about a
sexually independent young woman, Spike Lee was lionized as the
leader of a new wave of independent filmmaking. He had made the 1986
lusty black-and-white movie for an amazing $175,000.
   He spent millions more for ``Do the Right Thing,'' and with this
frank, realistic and brutal portrait of racism and its byproducts,
the brash young filmmaker has entered the mainstream.
   Race was not an issue in ``She's Gotta Have It.'' In his last
film, ``School Daze,'' Columbia Pictures' biggest grosser for 1988,
Lee was strident and polemical in his treatment of racial issues.
But in ``Do the Right Thing,'' he allows the movie itself to unravel
and define bigotry.
   The theme for the movie's title comes from a speech made by the
late black activist Malcolm X in December 1964: ``Racism is a human
problem and a crime that is absolutely so ghastly that a person who
is fighting racism is well within his rights to fight against it by
any means necessary until it is eliminated.''
   Malcolm X, and the late Nobelist Martin Luther King Jr., both
play an indirect role in the movie, which takes place in a
lower-middle-class neighborhood in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of
Brooklyn. It is a longing to include photographs of the late civil
rights leaders on a ``wall of fame'' in a pizza parlor run by an
Italian that sparks a tragic racial confrontation. The Italian owner
has only the pictures of white Italian-Americans on his wall, such
as Frank Sinatra and Sophia Loren.
   It is a sweltering summer in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Perspiration
runs freely, as do fire hydrants and tempers.
   Sal (Danny Aiello) and his two sons, Vito and Pino, open their
pizzeria to start a new day. Da Mayor (Ossie Davis), an ancient
resident who spends his time washing down the yesteryears with a
bottle of beer, sweeps up; Mookie (Lee) arrives in Dodgers shirt
(they were once the Brooklyn Dodgers, folks) ready to do his
delivery chores.
   On the street, Radio Raheem, a young man of few words and an
intense scowl, lumbers about with a ghetto blaster the size of a
minitruck forcing the world to listen to rap music. The stuttering
Smiley lopes about trying to sell pictures of King and Malcolm X.
Buggin Out, the local activist, grouses about how there are no
blacks on the ``wall of fame,'' and yet only blacks and Hispanics
frequent the pizza parlor.
   Lee's neighborhood mosaic slowly takes shape with sharp images of
human character. Tensions and conflicts abound: Mookie and the young
woman who gave birth to his son; Radio Raheem and the Hispanic kids;
Radio Raheem and Sal; Buggin Out and Sal; Sal and Pino; Vito and
Pino; Mookie and Pino.
   It is the final confrontation between the hothead and racist Pino
and Radio Raheem that culminates in the movie's violent end. Raheem
is murdered by police; people on the block respond by destroying
Sal's pizzeria.
   Lee does not set up a frenzied, random or mob-inspired reaction.
Indeed, it is Mookie, a character who easily talks to everyone and
who plays the role of peacekeeper, who casts the first stone. He is,
as Malcolm X advised, doing whatever is necessary to fight racism.
   As Sal, the Italian who has run a business in a black
neighborhood for 25 years, Aiello is splendid. Davis is endearing as
the downtrodden Da Mayor, and his wife, Ruby Dee, has a wonderful
character in Da Mayor's love interest, Mother Sister. John Torturro
does a believable stupid punk as the racist Pino, and Bill Nunn is
menacing as Raheem.
   The movie introduces Rosie Perez in the role of Tina, Mookie's
girlfriend. She also does some explosive dancing with the opening
titles. However, as an actress, her lines are muddled.
   Lee has created something of a repertory company with his films,
and one sees familiar faces in them all. His sister, Joie Lee, who
co-starred in ``She's Gotta Have It,'' returns as Mookie's gracious
sister, Jade, who is adored by Sal. Giancarlo Esposito, who has
co-starred in Lee's two major releases, plays Buggin Out.
   Esposito has found his niche with Lee: In ``She's Gotta Have
It,'' he was a nacissistic dandy; in ``School Daze,'' he was a
narcissistic fraternity brother; as Buggin Out, he's self-righteous.
   As for Lee, he has never really thought of himself as an actor.
Yet, he always puts in a star performance. His direction is tight,
and the mood he creates leaves one as hot as the characters on the
screen.
   Lee has a powerful movie, whose truths may repel those who
continue to deny that racism is indeed woven into the fabric of
American life.
   The 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks production is rated R.

<HEAD>America's Other Drug Problem: Overmedicated Senior Citizens</HEAD>

   They take too many drugs, and sometimes plead
for more. They get confused, shaky and sick, and feel like they're
going crazy. At least 200,000 end up in hospitals each year. Untold
thousands die.
   Dope-shooting junkies? Hard-core crack cocaine smokers?
   No _ just folks taking their medicine.
   ``Most older people are taking too many drugs, and are taking
doses that are dangerously high,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director
of the Washington-based Public Citizen Health Research Group,
founded by consumer advocate Ralph Nader.
   ``The greatest epidemic of drug abuse in American society is
among our older people,'' who suffer 9 million adverse reactions to
medicine a year, many unrecognized as drug-related, says ``Worst
Pills, Best Pills,'' Wolfe's 1988 book on overmedication of older
people.
   Side effects include depression, hallucinations, confusion,
memory loss, delirium, impaired thinking, shaking and twitching,
nausea, vomiting, appetite loss, stomach pain and bleeding,
constipation, diarrhea, difficulty urinating and controlling
urination, dizziness, and falls that result in hip fractures.
   People 60 and older represent 17 percent of the U.S. population
but account for nearly 40 percent of drug-related hospitalizations
and more than half the deaths from drug reactions, said Richard
Kusserow, inspector general of the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services.
   Experts say the elderly are prone to harmful reactions or
interactions between drugs because they take so many medicines,
largely because they have more maladies than younger people. And age
can slow the body's ability to process and excrete drugs, making it
more likely they will interact or accumulate to toxic levels.
   Yet the elderly, their relatives and doctors often blame
drug-related symptoms on old age, said Kathryn Watterson, author of
``The Safe Medicine Book.'' ``There isn't any reason people
shouldn't expect to feel very good when they get older. If they
don't, there's a reason: either a disease or the medicine they're
on.''
   Thousands of elderly Americans die each year from adverse
reactions to medications, although the exact toll is unknown, Wolfe
and Kusserow said. In a series of reports last year, the Arizona
Republic estimated drug reactions kill 73,000 U.S. senior citizens
annually, said reporter Chuck Cook, now editor of the Newhall
(Calif.) Signal. That calculation was based on American Hospital
Association and Food and Drug Administration statistics and other
research.
   ``That could very well be in the right ball park,'' said
Kusserow, who calls overmedication of the elderly ``America's other
drug problem.''
   In a report this year, Kusserow estimated that at least 200,000
elderly Americans are hospitalized each year by adverse drug
reactions. ``We suspect the number is considerably larger'' because
many hospitalizations are wrongly blamed on patients' diseases
rather than their medicines, he said.
   The Republic estimated 1.9 million such hospitalizations yearly.
   The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association lacks data on
drug-related deaths and hospitalization. If the Republic's estimates
are correct, such cases still represent much less than 1 percent of
prescriptions written annually for America's elderly, said spokesman
Jeff Trewhitt. The problem ``is not totally out of hand as is being
implied,'' he said.
   Wolfe, however, said U.S. senior citizens fill 613 million
prescriptions annually, an average of 15.5 per person, and many
``are taking ... as many as 10 different drugs at a time.''
   He contends at least two-thirds of those prescriptions fall into
one of three categories: the dose is excessive; a safer alternative
should have been used; or the prescription is unnecessary because
the diagnosis is wrong or the disease should be treated by non-drug
therapy, such as diet changes.
   Sleeping pills, tranquilizers and anti-anxiety drugs most
commonly cause harmful side effects among the elderly, said Dr. T.
Franklin Williams, director of the National Institute on Aging.
Drugs for cardiovascular and digestive ailments also are overused,
Wolfe said.
   Elderly patients often have several doctors. To avoid drug
misuse, older patients should ``get a brown paper bag, put
everything they're taking in it, and go review it with their primary
doctor,'' Williams said.
   In addition, pharmacists should do a better job monitoring
patients' drug use to prevent harmful interactions, Kusserow said.
   Doctors receive woefully inadequate training in pharmacology and
geriatrics, and depend heavily on self-interested drug company
advertisements and salespeople for information, he said.
   Many spend too little time with elderly patients, and ``may not
find out what drugs patients are on before giving new drugs,'' said
Dr. Edward Schneider, gerontology dean at the University of Southern
California.
   They also tend to ``use the prescription pad as the way to
terminate an appointment with a patient,'' Watterson said.
   Patients share the blame, though, with more than half of elderly
patients failing to follow dosage instructions, Kusserow said.
   In addition, ``older people can be very persistent,'' demanding
drugs and ``shopping around'' until they find a doctor who complies,
Williams said.
   ``I spend a lot of my time trying to talk elderly people out of
taking drugs, and they look at me like I'm crazy,'' said Dr. Michael
Freedman, New York University Medical Center's geriatrics director.
``All physicians probably prescribe more than they want to
prescribe. There are times when people sort of push you into giving
them a prescription.''

   Thousands of elderly Americans are hospitalized
and die every year because they take too many medicines and suffer
adverse reactions. Sam Benton, after two decades abusing
prescription drugs, kicked the habit on his own. AP Science Writer
Lee Siegel is his grandson.

<TEXT>
   Sam Benton doesn't look like a junkie, but
for 22 years the unassuming grandfather was hooked on a narcotic
painkiller and sleeping pills.
   ``I've been on so many different kinds of pills you'd have to get
a book to tell you how many. The more you take the worse off you
are. One pill leads to another pill. And I was drinking liquor on
top of that.''
   ``It's a wonder he's alive today,'' said Rose Benton, 81, married
for nearly 60 years to the retired clothing factory production
manager. ``You know what living in hell is? Watching somebody go
through this.''
   For Benton, 86, recovery started early last year when he felt
ill, sleepless, confused and like ``my mind wasn't acting properly.''
   He quit cigarettes, most medicines and, finally, the two hefty
shots of whiskey he enjoyed nightly. Last fall he spent two
agonizing months withdrawing from his 22-year habit of three to
seven daily Percodans, a painkiller containing a synthetic narcotic.
   ``He was a Percodan junkie,'' said Benton's son-in-law, Portland
lawyer Sol Siegel, but he quit Percodan ``at home without any help.''
   A doctor first prescribed Percodan in 1966, when Benton suffered
severe stress headaches. Over the years, he mixed Percodan with
Feldene and Indocin, arthritis drugs; Orinase, for diabetes;
antacids; decongestants; Motrin, a non-narcotic painkiller;
Coumadin, to prevent blood clots that caused leg pains; Elavil, an
antidepressant; and Xanax, Ativan, Librium and Serax to fight
sleeplessness, anxiety and nervousness.
   The situation worsened several years ago when a car rear-ended
Benton's, injuring his neck and prompting another doctor to
prescribe more Percodan.
   ``Doctors keep giving you the stuff. You just tell them, `My head
bothers me, my neck bothers me, I can't sleep.' They'll give you
pills.''
   If any doctor objected, Benton would say, ``Doc, if you take me
off it, you'll hurt me more than if you leave me on it.
   ``The minute it wears off you get a terrible urge. Everything
begins to disturb you. You crave it. I couldn't go to sleep without
it. I couldn't do anything without it.''
   Benton's daughter, Julie Siegel, said his latest doctor kept
urging him to quit Percodan, but was compassionate enough not to cut
off his supply.
   ``Gramp was desperately, profoundly dependent on his various
doctors to keep him in Percodan. He lived in fear of someone cutting
him off. It would be easy to condemn all the doctors involved, but I
can see their position too.''
   ``I don't want to blame my doctor. I was the one who coaxed
him,'' said Benton, who finally decided to quit most medications and
then Percodan because of sleeplessness, weakness, drug-induced hives
and mental confusion.
   As Benton tapered off Percodan, ``I was weak, sweaty, nauseous,
had an inner craving. My mind wouldn't relax. I was hot and cold all
the time.'' He also suffered severe insomnia.
   He now takes only coated aspirin for arthritis and, occasionally,
one-quarter of a sleeping pill. ``My mind is now alert,'' he said.
   He sleeps and feels better, and is starting to regain the
motivation he believes the drugs robbed him of.
   And he wants other senior citizens to know the dangers of
overmedication: ``It wrecks your body and your mind. It's going to
ruin your life.''

<HEAD>Consumer Group's Rules For Safer Drug Use By The Elderly</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-PRI--Old and Drugged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are 10 rules for safer drug use adapted
from ``Worst Pills, Best Pills: The Older Adult's Guide to Avoiding
Drug-Induced Death or Illness,'' by Dr. Sidney Wolfe and others at
the Public Citizen Health Research Group.
   (1) Have ``brown bag sessions'' with your primary doctor. When
you go to a doctor you haven't seen before or with whom you have
never had such a session, dump into a bag all prescription and
over-the-counter drugs you are using, have used in the last month or
are likely to use, and take them along.
   Discuss the reason each was prescribed, the dose and frequency,
how long you should take it, possible side effects, possible
interactions with foods or other drugs, and whether you can stop
taking any of them.
   (2) Contact your doctor if you have any of the following symptoms
after starting a drug: depression, hallucinations, confusion,
delirium, memory loss, impaired thinking, shaking or twitching,
dizziness upon standing, falls, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, bleeding, constipation, diarrhea, difficulty
urinating and loss of bladder control.
   (3) ``Assume that any new symptom you develop after starting a
new drug might be caused by the drug.'' Report it to your doctor.
   (4) Make sure you really need the drug for your condition and ask
whether the side effects may be worse than the disease.
   (5) ``If drug therapy is indicated, in most cases it is safer to
start with a dose that is lower than the usual adult dose.''
   (6) When adding a drug, see if it is possible to stop another
drug.
   (7) Review with your doctor at least every three to six months
the need to keep taking each drug.
   (8) Before leaving the doctor's office or pharmacy, make sure you
and a family member or friend understand the instructions for taking
the medication.
   (9) ``Discard all old drugs carefully.'' Throw them away when
your therapy is over so you aren't tempted to use or give away
outdated drugs.
   (10) ``Ask your primary doctor to coordinate your care and drugs.
If you see a specialist and he or she wants to start you on new
medicines in addition to the ones you are on, check with your
primary doctor first.''

   When next year's head count is done Census
Bureau officials expect to report there are more people aged 65 and
over than there were Americans at the time of the Civil War.
   The 1860 Census found 31.4 million Americans. The 1990 count is
expected to find 31.6 million people 65 and older, 13.2 million of
those being 75 and older. The 1830 Census counted 12.9 million
people.
   ``There is no historical precedent for the aging of our
population. We are in the midst of a new social phenomenon,'' wrote
Beth J. Soldo and Emily M. Agree in ``America's Elderly,'' a study
for the private Population Reference Bureau. ``We cannot foresee all
the repercussions, implications, or social changes stemming from the
presence of so many older persons and the aging of society.''
   People born in 1900 could expect to live 47 years. Life
expectancy passed 50 in 1908, topped 60 in the 1930s and hit 70 in
the '60s. Americans born today can expect to live about 75 years,
thanks largely to better medical care.
   The elderly comprise about 12.2 percent of the population. Well
over half are women, 70 percent say they're healthy and
three-fourths own their homes. They also spend a greater percentage
of what are often fixed incomes on food, housing and health care
than younger people.
   But take a closer look.
   By definition the elderly are 65 and up, but the mix is changing.
In 1960, 6.1 percent of the population was 65 to 74 and 3.1 percent
was 75 and older. By 1987, 7.2 percent were 65 to 74 and 5 percent
were 75 or older.
   A half-century ago, men and women comprised equal numbers of the
elderly, but women began living longer in the 1930s as pregnancy-and
childbirth-related deaths began declining. Women now live an average
78.3 years, compared with 71.5 years for men, and comprise 59.2
percent of those age 65 and over.
   As of 1988, 10.3 percent of all American males were 65 or older,
compared with 14.3 percent of all women.
   ``The problems of old age in America are largely the problems of
women. Six out of every 10 older Americans are women,'' said Dr.
Robert Butler, a former director of the National Institute on Aging.
   ``In general, older women have fewer financial assets and,
because they typically outlive their spouses, are more dependent on
adult children and formal health care services,'' Agree and Soldo
wrote.
   And that poses a problem, with the need for home care for many
elderly rising just as social change threatens to undermine the
traditional source of that care, says researcher Alice T. Day. In a
1985 Population Reference Bureau report, she estimated 6.6 million
elderly people needed long-term care but only 1.4 million were in
nursing homes. The rest were helped by families. But small families
mean fewer young people to care for the elderly and most of them
face other obligations, including jobs.
   While elderly women tend to be widows, 80 percent of men aged 65
to 74 are married, as are 66 percent of those aged 75 and over.
   As people age, health is of increasing concern. ``Four out of
every five noninstitutionalized older persons have at least one
chronic condition and many have more than one,'' said Soldo and
Agree. ``The most common of these diseases are arthritis,
hypertension, heart disease and hearing impairments.''
   The National Center for Health Statistics reported in 1984 that
23 percent of the elderly had trouble completing at least one common
task like shopping, preparing meals and housework.
   Nevertheless, a survey by the center found that 70 percent of
elderly considered themselves to be in good or excellent health.
Those with higher incomes were more likely to list themselves in
excellent health.
   Since most elderly people are retired, they have lower average
incomes. In 1986, median income for families headed by someone 65
and older was $19,932, about 62 percent of that for families headed
by someone 25 to 64. The Senate Special Committee on Aging in 1985
reported a median income of $20,354 for families with a 65- to
74-year-old head, $16,412 for those headed by 75- to 84-year-olds,
and $15,111 for 85 and over.
   With less cash, the elderly tend to spend a bigger percentage of
it on food, housing and health care than do younger people. Even so,
business now views the elderly as a market segment of growing
importance, and has begun targeting products and advertising.
   Another place where the elderly have attracted attention is the
voting booth. More than one in five voters in the 1986 congressional
elections was 65 and over. While 46 percent of all eligible voters
went to the polls, 65.1 percent of those 65 to 74 voted, the most of
any population segment.
   The Senate committee found that most older people are adequately
housed, although some have problems finding affordable homes. In
1985, three-fourths of elder households owned their home and 25
percent rented. Males were more likely to own than were females, and
those over age 75 were more likely to rent.
   The elderly tended to occupy older homes, 36 percent living in
house built before 1940, compared to 21 percent of younger people.
The 1983 Annual Housing Survey found 10 percent of the homes
occupied by the elderly with some serious flaw in such areas as
plumbing, electrical, structure and heating.

   When Bob Rheinhart needed to expand his
office recently, he didn't have to look far for expertise. The
architect and skilled craftspeople he needed all were on his payroll
_ and they all were retired.
   So are the office workers at Rheinhart's 11-year-old Retiree
Skills Inc., a temporary-help agency handling people over age 50.
Ads on buses, cabs and elsewhere say it offers employers
``Experience! Skills! Dependability!''
   ``I don't care how many age discrimination laws there are, age is
the main reason people over 50 aren't hired when they seek work,''
says Rheinhart, a 68-year-old retired stockbroker. ``We don't
guarantee we'll get anyone a job, but on the other hand we don't
charge them anything either.''
   Jack Shine and Roscoe Lacy, both 70, have been with Retiree
Skills almost from its start 11 years ago.
   ``I'd be lost without something productive to do, and with the
cost of living what it is the money don't hurt anything either,''
says Shine, who ran his own sporting goods store for years. Now he
paints houses, limits his work week to 24 hours and will continue
``as long as I can climb a ladder.''
   Lacy, who spent 30 years in the Navy, averages 24 hours a week,
filling in for school custodians who are sick or on vacation. ``I'll
do it as long as I can get around. When you're active it keeps you
young.''
   Retiree Skills offers workers in more than 200 job
classifications, including secretaries, engineers, accountants,
electricians, word processors, chemists, plumbers, carpenters,
mail-room personnel, equipment operators, masons, computer
programmers, auditors and laborers.
   ``There's even a professional clown,'' Rheinhart says.
   The National Council on Aging says it knows of no similar group.
Most temporary-help agencies specialize in categories like office
workers; most employment organizations for retirees are limited to
one type of professional.
   Workers remain on the payroll of Retiree Skills, saving the
temporary employer Social Security, sick pay, retirement, vacation
and insurance costs, which can total a third or more of the average
payroll. Employers are billed for actual time at a rate above what
workers are paid, which Rheinhart says is near the area's prevailing
wage for their skill. The minimum is $4 an hour.
   More than 300 companies have used Retiree Skills and Rheinhart
says he has found work for more than 2,500 people. About 800 now are
registered.
   ``Most came to us originally as a last resort. Can you believe
the morale boost for someone who's almost at the point of feeling
useless and then finding he's got talent that people are looking for
and are willing to pay for? And the flip side is that the people who
use them are getting genuine bargains. Aside from their skills,
their old-fashioned work ethic is so different from what's
fashionable today among younger people,'' Rheinhart says.
   ``I have a very positive reaction to Retiree Skills,'' says
Barbara Walker, office manager for Desert Analytics, a small testing
laboratory.
   Harold Koenig, a retired chemical engineer, did so well as a
temporary lab technician that he was hired as a regular, ``working
somewhat less than 40 hours a week because he wants Mondays off,''
Walker says.
   Another worker, a 58-year-old banker forced out in a corporate
realignment, was sent to a savings and loan and stayed eight years.
He had applied for work at 60 places, Rheinhart says, including the
one that finally kept him on.
   Retiree Skills keeps people on Social Security advised about how
much they may earn without penalties. Those 65 to 70 can make $8,800
this year and still receive all benefits. Under 65, it's $6,480.
Generally, $1 in benefits is lost for each $2 earned over the limit.
At 70, full benefits are available regardless of earnings.
   Rheinhart, who had started a life insurance company in Dayton,
Ohio, and a brokerage in Columbus, retired to Tucson to play golf.
``But you can play just so much golf without getting bored. Most of
the people I met were older and I was hearing two things from them _
they either didn't have enough to do, or, if they did have things to
do, they didn't have enough money to do them.
   ``About that time the National Council on Aging put on a TV
commercial that showed an empty rocking chair that was in motion,
with the suggestion it was time for the elderly to get off their
rocker.
   ``Those two things gave me the idea to start Retiree Skills.''
   He hopes eventually to franchise the Retiree Skill idea and has
trademarked its slogan: ``From Inactivity to Productivity.''

   Marjory Stoneman Douglas stands watch over the
Everglades with the temperament of the ancient sawgrass that
dominates the wetland.
   She can be smooth and genteel, hands folded in her lap and voice
hinting at the refinement of her New England upbringing more than
three generations ago.
   Yet, like the sawgrass, she cuts for the bone when rubbed the
wrong way.
   ``It's not a question of if we can save the Everglades. We
must,'' said Douglas, 99. ``There is no choice to consider. Without
the Everglades, much of Florida is lost, too.''
   Water is the gift of the Everglades, a soggy plain that ends a
300-mile water system running down the center of the Florida
peninsula. This slow-moving ``River of Grass'' _ part of the title
of Douglas' 1947 book _ starts a process that brings rain to the
populated coast during the six-month wet season.
   ``Whether you're a developer or an environmentalist, the message
is still the same,'' Douglas said. ``If the Everglades go, then
South Florida becomes a desert.''
   The greatest threat isn't pollution, but the draining of land to
accommodate the boom in one of the fastest growing states. ``I'd say
about 80 percent of the Everglades are unspoiled. But what I'm most
worried about is man's ignorance of the importance of the
Everglades. The people coming to Florida know nothing about the
Everglades. That is our greatest peril.''
   Age has clouded Douglas' sight. But her vision is reaching new
horizons.
   Recent attention to the Everglades has brought renewed attention
to her crusade. In January, she and five other women were named Ms.
magazine's women of the year; she was ABC News' person of the week
Jan. 13, and was on the NBC ``Today'' show in February. In May, she
became an honorary vice president of the national Sierra Club, the
highest award the organization gives.
   But she was conspicuously absent from a three-day conference in
January on the Everglades, which featured more than 200 experts and
officials. She prefers to surrender the high-profile events to the
Friends of the Everglades, a group she founded in the 1960s. She'd
rather greet visitors in the stucco cottage that she built in 1926
in Coconut Grove.
   From her easy chair surrounded by cassette tapes of books, she
receives word on the political battles being waged over the
Everglades. ``Why do people worry about me and my age so much?''
said Douglas, who disdains ambiguity. ``I get by. Let's concentrate
on the real problems.''
   ``She has been to the Everglades what Winston Churchill was to
Britain in World War II,'' said Mike Finley, the park's
superintendent. ``She has been the leader, the conscience, the
rallying point.''
   Throughout her life, Douglas has kept a distant relationship with
the Everglades. Even when her sight was good, she rarely traveled
into the grass and cypress interior. Besides, she says, there are
too many bugs.
   ``Every time it rains, we know the Everglades are there,'' said
Douglas, who dons a floppy wide-brimmed hat whenever outdoors.
``It's not necessary to be out there to feel its presence.''
   ``I suppose you could say the Everglades and I have the kind of
friendship that doesn't depend on constant physical contact,'' she
wrote in ``River of Grass,'' the product of five years' research.
   In 1915, Douglas left a domineering husband in New Jersey and
boarded a southbound train. Her destination was literally the end of
the line. Miami was then a ramshackle railway terminus of 5,000
residents where ice was scarce and dreams of riches in real estate
abounded.
   It was also home to her father, a lawyer who founded what would
become The Miami Herald newspaper with a printing press he collected
on a bad debt.
   Douglas landed a job as a columnist and reporter, but soon left
to sell free-lance magazine articles. In 1943, she began a novel to
help overcome an emotional breakdown following her father's death.
When a publisher asked for a book on the tiny Miami River, she felt
it too insignificant. She persuaded the publisher to consider a
treatise on the Everglades water system.
   Nearly 50 years later, the book is still in print.
   Among her other eight books are ``Florida: The Long Frontier'' in
1967 and ``Alligator Crossing,'' a children's book. She can no
longer use a typewriter, but is determined to dictate a biography of
English environmentalist W.H. Hudson, best known for his book
``Green Mansions.''
   Death, in Douglas' view, is the end. She believes in no afterlife
for herself or for south Florida if the Everglades perish. ``When
(the Everglades) are gone, then we are finished. There's not much to
consider beyond that.''

   A person born during the year 1900 could
expect to live to be 50 years old. Today, a person's life expectancy
at birth is 75 years, a full generation longer. Why are people
living longer? What do these extra years mean to the individual, to
the family, to society?
   How long a person lives depends on several factors: genetics,
medical advances, lifestyle, and environmental assaults.
   Science and medicine have given us antibiotics, vaccines and
better medical care so that illnesses once fatal no longer are.
People are more aware than ever of changes in lifestyle that affect
health: eating a well-balanced diet that limits fats and fiber,
exercising sensibly, wearing seat belts, quitting smoking, and
drinking little, if any, alcohol, have all contributed to longer,
healthier lives. Governmental regulations have eliminated many
concerns about the food we eat, the water we drink and the air we
breathe.
   Some 20 or 30 years ago, people believed that getting old meant
an inevitable decline of health and intellectual function. In fact,
many medical textbooks still use the word ``senile'' to describe
people who suffer confusion and memory loss and imply that this
condition is a natural consequence of age.
   Today, thanks to studies on normal human aging, we know that
people can live to be 100 and more with no evidence of heart disease
or memory impairment. Scientists also have concluded that
personality does not change with age. In fact, there are few, if
any, changes that occur to all people as they grow old.
   Despite these results, there are many people for whom aging is no
joy. I recently met a woman in her mid-70s who confided, ``No one
ever told me that growing old hurts so much.'' Many older people
become dependent on family members and society because of
debilitating conditions that severely restrict their independence.
Arthritis, osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease, to name a few, are
problems for which science and society have not yet found adequate
solutions. A person should be able to remain functional and vigorous
throughout life.
   As director of the National Institute on Aging at the National
Institutes of Health, I am all too frequently asked, ``Is this what
I have to look forward to as I grow old?'' Studies that help us to
understand and eliminate the afflictions that rob a person of
independence are a high priority among researchers around the world.
   Make no mistake, we have made progress. For example, we have the
expertise to treat certain forms of urinary incontinence, we have
identified the risk factors that make falls and subsequent fractures
likely, and we understand the benefits of early rehabilitation after
stroke.
   Because of these and other successes, many children today know
their grandparents, and even their great grandparents. In many
cases, grandparents are an integral part of the family and are
called upon to lend support to the family unit. This is all very
positive. However, new problems arise as many grown children are
called upon to care for a frail parent or relative. For many, the
caregiving role is fraught with doubts, guilt, tedium and fears, and
indeed is an area which requires innovative approaches to best serve
all concerned.
   To society, the implications of the growing number of older
people is still confusing. Many healthy older people do not choose
retirement. They wish to remain employed. Health-care systems do not
yet know how to respond to the growing number of people who require
long-term care. Health professionals and policymakers need to sort
out the ramifications of having so many older people in need of
assistance.
   From the day you are born you begin to age. No matter how old you
are, aging issues apply. I hope this information will serve to
eliminate some of the common fears many of us have about growing old.

<HEAD>Part-Time Gardening Expands After Retirement</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: George Bria retired from the AP in 1981 after 40
years that included coverage of World War II from Italy.

<TEXT>
   My garden looks tidier and yields richer harvests today than the
vegetable patch I was cultivating eight years ago when, at age 65, I
drew my first pension check. Leisure has worked wonders.
   New retirees planning to raise vegetables will enter an exciting
era. The kitchen garden, reflecting our widely traveled population,
has acquired a global look, with European and oriental favorites now
maturing next to the old corn patch. Midget vegetables and intensive
growing techniques have come along for people with small gardens.
Also, power tillers as light as 17 pounds, a boon for seniors.
   To meet demand, new seed houses have sprung up dealing primarily
in exotic fare. Old established catalogs have added international
sections. If you liked a crisp lettuce you savored in France, a red
radicchio chicory in Italy or a bok-choi cabbage in Asia, you can
find the seeds here. Meanwhile, domestic breeders multiplied their
own offerings. All told, up to 130 new cultivars, from beans to
zucchini, appeared in this year's catalogs.
   Why grow your own when the world's choicest produce adorns
supermarket shelves? Well, anyone who has nurtured a bean or tomato
from babyhood knows no store-bought veggie matches the taste of the
home garden's fresh young crops. Legions of us share that feeling. A
Gallup survey for the National Gardening Association shows 31
million U.S. households grew vegetables in 1988. Some garden
organically, avoiding pesticides.
   For my 70th birthday, my wife, children and grandchildren bought
me a new fence to replace the unsightly sagging wire and rotting
locust poles. With a post-hole digger and grunts of strength, my son
put in pressure-treated poles to resist the weather. Above the taut
new chicken wire we strung a battery-operated ``hot'' wire to keep
out woodchuck and raccoon.
   Along with the facelift, I set out to deepen the scattered
know-how I had accumulated in 30 years of gardening. Enrolling in a
college horticulture course, I met numerous other seniors with the
same intention, among them a 75-year-old whose children had given
him a greenhouse for his birthday. We got valuable tips and sobering
insights into the magnitude of the subject from professors
discussing soil, water, sun and plants in terms of complex chemical
equations.
   Seniors wanting a less formal approach will find wide coverage of
gardening in books, magazines and newspapers, the best advice often
coming from the local columnist, who knows the peculiarities of the
area. Television, radio and videocassettes cover the field. Computer
owners can buy software that will design gardens, plan crops
according to geographical location, give tips on fertilizers,
estimate costs and keep records.
   On my own, I dug into the often-hard-to-find history and legends
of the vegetables I was raising, putting together a modest little
bookshelf of intriguing lore. And, smoothly helped along by my word
processor, I streamlined and greatly expanded my day-to-day notes on
the progress of the season.
   As time went on, gardening became more and more a year-round
activity for me. Indoors, under lights, I'm always growing
something. In the winter, I raise lettuce, arugula, parsley, basil,
chives and some small tomatoes in a custom-made fluorescent stand in
the dining room. The same stand serves to start the seeds for most
of my outdoor summer crops, giving me a jump on the season.
   We live in the country, 50 miles north of Manhattan, with plenty
of room in my 65-by-25-foot garden for space-gobblers like corn and
asparagus. But in sharply dwindled space I could still produce
quantity and variety for just me and my wife. Nationwide, gardens
keep getting smaller; a Gallup survey shows the typical plot dropped
in 1988 to only 200 square feet. But along with the drop have come
miniature vegetables and techniques for utilizing space to the
utmost. Tomato plants no taller than a foot are producing small
fruit in four-inch pots.
   I've found that three or four broccoli plants, two zucchini
plants, a few tomato plants and a couple of eggplants fill our
two-person needs in these crops. I grow varieties with staggered
harvests and also succession crops of beans and lettuce, keeping the
garden busy deep into the frosts of autumn. Cold-loving Brussels
sprouts, still green in the snow, provide us with garden-fresh
vegetables for Christmas dinner.
   From the part-time gardening of my working years I've become a
full-time gardener with something of a farmer's priorities. When
friends grouse about a rainy forecast I'm thinking the rain is good
for my lettuce.

issues affecting the elderly.

<TEXT>
   Arizona will ``borrow'' more than $51 million this
year from state employee retirement funds and tax some pension
benefits as part of a plan to eliminate a $150 million shortage in a
$3.2 billion budget.
   Gov. Rose Mofford opposed using retirement funds but is expect to
sign the budget-balancing package. Unions and retirees also opposed
it.
   Arizona will reduce its pension contribution for one year, then
repay the funds in future years. Another $2.2 million would be
raised by taxing any pension benefits over $2,500 for local, state
and federal retirees.
   Local and state pensions are not now taxed and federal retirees
are taxed on anything over $2,500. The change was made in part to
comply with the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that all government
retirees be taxed equally.
   Lawmakers also halved a school tax for residents of retirement
communities that do not have organized school districts.

   Harris assigned experts to study the issue and advise him on
whether to eliminate the tax on federal pension benefits or start
taxing those of state and local employees. He hasn't said what

   Legislation before the General Assembly
could affect elderly people who drive a car, fill out a state tax
return or face the possibility of physical or financial exploitation.
   One measure, which cleared the Senate and is pending in the
House, would require annual road tests for drivers 87 and older;
those 81-86 would be tested every two years. The current requirement
for testing every four years for those over 69 would be kept for
those aged 75-80 but dropped for those 74 and under.
   A pending measure would allow 15-year prison terms for those who
coerce or deceive elderly people into giving up their money. Others
would allow hearsay evidence of abuse to be considered by a judge to
help determine if a person over 60 was abused, and would require a
judge to consider a victim's age and health when ruling on a motion
for a continuance in a trial of elder abuse.
   Also before the General Assembly is legislation to restore an
extra $1,000 state tax exemption for the elderly that was
effectively erased last year by federal tax law revisions.

   The 1989 Legislature revamped the state's
guardianship laws, provided more in-home services for the elderly
and disabled and set up a system to investigate elder abuse, neglect
and exploitation.
   Nineteen measures directly affecting the elderly take effect in
July, including legal recognition of living wills. The two-year
spending cycle that starts July 1 also puts $5.6 million into
in-home services.
   In revamping guardianships of the elderly, lawmakers required
courts to appoint an attorney to act essentially as an ombudsman for
the individual and to make proceedings accessible and understandable
to impaired people, and required reports from guardians.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Inc., as part of its battle against
Paramount Communications Inc.'s hostile $10.7 billion bid for the
media company, released a legal brief by the attorneys general of 13
states that opposes the transfer of Time's cable TV franchises to
Paramount.
   Time also said in a statement Sunday the U.S. Conference of
Mayors had written to Dennis C. Patrick, chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission, expressing concern over Paramount's
desire to transfer the franchise agreements.
   In their filing with the FCC on Friday, the attorneys general
said that if the franchises are transferred without prior approval
of the local and state authorities that granted them, ``federal,
state and local laws will be violated and the rights of state and
local franchise authorities to review effectively and preapprove the
transfer of cable franchises will be lost.''
   Paramount has proposed that it purchase shares in Time through a
trust that would hold the stock until permission to transfer the
cable franchises was obtained.
   The letter from the mayors' group, dated Wednesday, said that the
Paramount plan ``is an attempt to circumvent the requirement that
transfer of cable francises receive prior approval of state and
local franchising authorities and to avoid its legal obligations at
the state and municipal levels.''
   The issue of transferring the cable licenses held by Time's
American Television and Communications Corp. is one of several Time
has raised as it attempts to fight Paramount's bid and continue with
its own plans to buy Warner Communications Inc. through a $14
billion tender offer.
   In a statement Sunday, Paramount responded, ``As we have said
several times before, despite the efforts of Time to stir up
opposition with misinformation, we expect to get state and local
cable franchise approvals in an orderly and expeditious way.''

   Civil rights gains will be eroded further if a
federal judge approves General Motors Corp.'s proposed settlement of
a discrimination suit, says a spokesman for a group of disgruntled
black workers.
   The Concerned Black Salaried Employees of General Motors has
called on the black community, including co-workers, to boycott GM
products until a settlement it believes is more equitable is
reached, spokesman Napoleon Quick Jr. said Sunday.
   The group also hopes to fill a courtroom with angry workers
today, when U.S. District Judge John Feikens in Detroit is scheduled
to begin two days of hearings on GM's settlement proposal.
   The employee group spent the weekend rallying support for the
boycott it launched Wednesday, Quick said during a telephone
interview from his Detroit home. He said the group has draw up to
600 people at its meetings.
   ``We feel that if the settlement is forced down our throats by
Judge Feikens, then that will begin a new era of discrimination in
this country,'' said Quick, 52, a former GM salaried worker and
plaintiff in the suit.
   ``We feel our days in court have been just about snuffed out
because of the recent Supreme Court decisions'' involving racial
issues including reverse discrimination, he said.
   ``Passive resistance is the approach that we must now seriously
consider to make fair hiring practices a real part of good business
practice in general,'' Quick said.
   The suit, filed in 1983 by four black salaried GM employees, was
certified for class action in 1986 on behalf of 10,000 such workers
in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana.
   GM has offered to pay cash settlements to some workers and raise
the salaries of others. But the automaker does not admit to
discriminating against black workers in pay raises and promotions.
   If accepted, the settlement would amount to $20 million to $40
million over the next five years for the plaintiffs, their attorneys
said.
   GM also proposes to monitor the pay and promotion of black
workers for five years and to assess that information using computer
models for comparable white employees.
   ``We continue to believe that the proposed agreement is a win-win
settlement, and we will wait for the court's review'' this week, GM
spokeswoman Patricia Molloy said.
   But the settlement proposal falls short in several areas,
including payment for damages or lost wages, the Concerned Black
Salaried Employees said.
   The GM plan would make payments only to those workers whose wages
were most out of line, rather than compensate all black workers
whose salary fell below the norm, the group claims.
   It also said the company's proposal would be less binding and
enforceable than current policies under the U.S. Department of Labor.
   Not all of the suit's plaintiffs oppose the GM proposal. One of
the original four workers who filed the suit, the Rev. James E.
Kennedy of Flint, said he favors the proposed settlement.

   Today's trading totaled $6.6 billion, down from $10.3 billion

   Dealers said the dollar was weak in the morning, reflecting
trading at the 138-yen level in New York in the previous session.

   The election result left some political uncertainty that helped

   A dealer at the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition of

buying the dollar when it rises and selling when it declines.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected

It had gained 205.74 points Friday.
   An offical at Nomura Securities Co. said the slight gain resulted
from stability on the foreign exchange market and a firm stock

<HEAD>Machinists Union, Labor Lose an Unapologetic Leader</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf pvs, His union's ..., to include Winpisinger's
age, that retirement began Friday and name of successor. A version moving

<TEXT>
   William Winpisinger, the unapologetic,
outspoken, liberal leader of the Machinists union, walked away
quietly last week in the middle of his biggest fight.
   From retirement, however, the labor veteran _ once referred to as
the labor movement's last angry man _ will surely be heard from
again.
   His union's strike against Eastern Airlines was nearing the
four-month point as Winpisinger, 62, took leave Friday of the union
he had joined 38 years ago as a high school dropout and led as
president for the past 12. He was succeeded by George Kourpias, who
had been a union vice president.
   ``I had hoped very much to have that as a retirement present,''
Winpisinger said last week when asked whether he believed the
Machinists would win their war with Eastern and parent Texas Air
Corp. ``But the strike continues. And I'll be more than a casually
interested observer for the most of the way.''
   To Winpisinger, the strike against Eastern and the bigger battle
with Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo is the manifestation of the
``anti-union animus'' of the Reagan years.
   ``There wasn't a single employer in the country that didn't get
that message loudly and clearly and tried to emulate it,'' he said.
``And we've had a wave of union-busting and everything else
reminiscent of decades long ago.''
   But Winpisinger believes the tide is turning, that better days
for the labor movement lie ahead _ if its leaders act responsibly.
   ``When that power comes back, and I view it as inevitable, it has
to be used more responsibly than ever before, so as to diffuse the
notion that we are a special interest, that we bargain only for
ourselves, that organized workers are somehow greedy by
definition,'' he said.
   He believes a new breed of labor leaders is emerging. ``Most of
them are younger, tested, battle-hardened and had to live through
all this evolution and discomfort afflicted by the Reagan years,''
he said.
   ``We've profited from that. We learned what we had to do with our
backs against the wall.''
   His liberal view has prompted some to label him a socialist, and
Winpisinger's criticisms of the Reagan defense buildup often seemed
odd coming from the president of a union representing thousands of
workers in defense-related industries.
   He blames the defense buildup for the decline of basic
manufacturing and research and development in the United States, and
he labels Reagan a hypocrite for making rallying cries for U.S.
industry to become more competitive.
   ``Where the hell do you get all the brains to do that when he's
already siphoned all of them into the defense complex,'' said
Winpisinger.
   His harsh words are not for Republicans alone.
   The Democratic Party, he said, needs to stop trying to imitate
Republicans and return instead to its traditional base.
   ``We have a lot of people who are running around masquerading as
Democrats who are pale imitations of the enemy,'' said Winpisinger,
who nominated Jesse Jackson for president at the 1988 Democratic
National Convention.
   Who will emerge as the party's future leader? Winpisinger's not
sure.
   ``If the American people showed any propensity at all to elect
high school dropouts president of the United States I'd go out and _
given the money _ I'd try it myself,'' he said with a grin, rolling
a fat cigar between his fingers.
   Retirement will take him away from the platform the nearly
million-member Machinists union gave him, but Winpinsinger promises
speak out ``when I perceive the need and perceive that someone will
listen ... I don't intend to be invisible.''
   He will freely assess others but not himself, refusing to discuss
his contribution to the labor movement. Besides, Winpisinger says he
has more important things to worry about.
   ``I have to catch up on 38 years of accumulated tasks,'' he said.
``And find out whether or not me and my wife can live under the same
roof on a daily basis or what kind of adjustments I have to make to
make that possible.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. said today it will keep its
6,000-employee Merchandise Group in Illinois but move it to a
Chicago suburb. ``We believe this Chicagoland location will serve
the best interests of our company and its shareholders for decades
to come,'' Chairman Edward Brennan said in a statement released
before a morning news conference.
   ``We anticipate that the move to the new facility will begin in
2{ to 3 years,'' he said.
   The site is in Hoffman Estates, 20 miles northwest of Chicago.
   Last fall, the nation's largest retailer announced a
restructuring plan that included selling the 110-story Sears Tower _
the world's tallest building _ and shifting the Merchandise Group
and its 6,000 employees to less costly quarters.
   The announcement set off a bidding war between Illinois and
Sunbelt states, especially North Carolina and Texas.
   The Chicago Tribune said Illinois offered an incentive package
worth an estimated $61 million to lure the Merchandise Group to a
200-acre site in Hoffman Estates. The newspaper said local tax
breaks to Sears will be worth an estimated $178 million.
   ``The total proposal that was worked out is extremely competitive
with alternative sites,'' Brennan said.
   The Hoffman Estates site is part of an undeveloped 1,300 acres
north of the Northwest Tollway at Illinois 59.
   Sears said it had signed a contract to purchase 700 acres along
the tollway, including an outdoor music theater, Poplar Creek. Sears
said the theater will continue operating.
   The Hoffman Estates parcel was selected from about 50 sites in
the Chicago area and other states, Brennan said.
   Sears estimates that building a campus-style facility in Hoffman
Estates will cost about $220 million. The development will
eventually generate an estimated $11 million a year in property
taxes.
   Brennan said future commercial development of the site also is
planned.
   The Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times said the deal was cemented
Sunday after talks between Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson and
Brennan.
   When the Merchandise Group move is completed, about 600 employees
of Sears corporate staff will remain in the downtown Sears Tower,
the company said.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean Futures Slide On Wet Outlook</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices were sharply lower
in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade following
reports of heavy rains Sunday on the western edge of the Corn Belt.
   Wheat futures were trading higher on rumors of new Soviet
purchases of U.S. wheat and on assurances by the Agriculture
Department that grain trade with China would continue despite
international tensions.
   Rainfall amounts of up to 3 inches were reported in parts of
Nebraska with smaller amounts recorded in southwestern Minnesota.
   ``That's supposedly going to be coming right across here,
although we're not expecting anything of that amount,'' said Jerry
Gidel, research director with LIT America Inc., a commodities
brokerage firm in Chicago.
   The corn and soybean markets also were pressured by dry
conditions over the weekend in the eastern half of the Midwest,
where higher-than-normal spring rainfall left some fields too wet
for planting.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent to 2 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.99{ a bushel; corn was 4{ cents
to 8} cents lower with July at $2.57{ a bushel; oats were 2{ cents
to 5 cents lower with July at $1.50 a bushel; soybeans were 11{
cents to 20 cents lower with July at $7.19{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .02 cent lower to .18 cent higher with August at
69.85 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .43 cent higher
with August at 81.55 cents a pound; live hogs were .13 cent to .60
cent higher with July at 49.97 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .35 cent to .73 cent higher with July at 34.37 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled lower on Friday while pork futures were

<HEAD>High Court To Consider Killing Suit on Alleged Bribe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
killing a lawsuit growing out of the development of an aeromedical
center in Kaduna, Nigeria.
   The court said it will review a decision requiring W.S.
Kirkpatrick &amp; Co., a New Jersey corporation, to defend itself
against allegations that it won the contract by illegally bribing
Nigerian government officials.
   Those allegations are raised in a suit filed by Environmental
Tectonics Corp. of Pennsylvania.
   A Justice Department investigation of the 1981 contract between
Kirkpatrick and the Nigerian government led to Kirkpatrick's
pleading guilty to one count of violating the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act.
   Kirkpatrick was fined $75,000.
   Environmental Tectonics, which had submitted a lower bid for the
Nigerian contract, then sued Kirkpatrick. Its lawsuit alleged that
Environmental Tectonics would have been awarded the contract but for
Kirkpatrick's payment of bribes.
   A federal judge dismissed the suit, relying on the so-called
``act of state doctrine.'' It precludes U.S. courts from inquiring
into the validity of a foreign government's acts committed within
its own territory.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, however, reinstated the
suit last year. ``The traditional justification for invoking the
doctrine _ avoiding a judicial determination of the legal validity
of a state's act within its own borders _ is not present in this
case,'' the appeals court said.
   Kirkpatrick then sought the Supreme Court's help.
   The case is Kirkpatrick &amp; Co. vs. Environmental Tectonics Corp.,
87-2066.

<TEXT>
   Britain today rejected plans to create a
single European currency and a central bank but pledged to accept
some elements of a plan to form a united European market by late
1992.
   West Germany, however, urged the leaders of the 12-nation
European Economic Community to endorse the single currency and
central bank.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, also enthusiastic about a
sole currency and central bank, said he may renege on an agreement
to lift controls on the movement of the French franc if Britain
holds up the economic union plan.
   Under the plan being considered at an EEC summit in Madrid,
member states would gradually hand over economic policy-making power
to the EEC. Surrendering aspects of national sovereignty is a key
issue as the community heads toward dropping all trade barriers and
creating the single market in 1992.
   ``Decisions on these matters are simply not on the current
agenda,'' British officials quoted Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
as telling the closed-door summit meeting. ``We must stick to the
practical and go for what needs to be done now.''
   The leaders adjourned for lunch on the first day of the two-day
summit with aides seeking to draw up a compromise position.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl pressed the leaders to accept
the plan in its entirety, said his spokesman, Hans Klein.
   As part of endorsing the first stage of the plan, which would
begin in July 1990, Mrs. Thatcher pledged to link the pound to the
other major EEC currencies by joining the exchange rate mechanism of
the European Monetary System.
   But a British spokesman, who requested anonymity, said Mrs.
Thatcher said Britain would join the European Monetary system if
Britain's 8.3 percent inflation rate was ``reduced significantly,''
other EEC countries abolish exchange controls by July 1990 and the
community allows an open market in banking and financial services.
   Mrs. Thatcher argued that earlier membership of the currency
alignment by Britain could have shaken the entire system. Britain is
the only major oil producer in the EEC, and the pound is boosted by
oil price increases, which tend to depress the other currencies.
   Since Spain joined last week, only Britain, Greece and Portugal
are outside the system.
   Pedro Solbes, spokesman for Spanish Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez, said that despite the disagreement over monetary union,
``the atmosphere was positive in general.''
   ``But we shouldn't be led into fooling ourselves ... We're going
to have to work very hard ... There's only a slim possibility of an
agreement but it is worth making the effort,'' he added.
   Mrs. Thatcher remained isolated on the second major issue at the
meeting _ proposals for community-wide regulations guaranteeing
workers' rights, including representation on company boards.
   Earlier, Lord Plumb, president of the European Parliament, the
EEC's legislature, cautioned summit leaders in an opening address
that ``all these issues strike at the heart of national
decision-making.
   ``It is not surprising that in the past, the expressions of grand
aspiration have not always produced quick results,'' said Plumb, a
British conservative.
   Mrs. Thatcher, criticized within her Conservative Party for her
often-combative stance toward the EEC, has adopted a more
conciliatory tone in Madrid, stressing Britain's commitment to
Europe.
   Late Sunday, as the EEC leaders assembled for their semiannual
meeting, West Germany indicated that it will settle for a
declaration of ``political will'' as opposed to a firm commitment on
the two final stages of monetary union.
   ``I see possibilities that we will come to a common position,''
said Lutz Stavenhagen, a senior aide to Kohl. ``But we don't want to
go into the blue. We need the political will to come to an end.''
   Mrs. Thatcher's aides discounted reports that the prime minister
feels she is in a weaker position because of her party's defeat by
Britain's Labor Party in elections this month for the European
Parliament.
   The latest British opinion poll, by Harris, was published Sunday
and showed the Conservatives trailing Labor by 14 points.
   The other Common Market members are Belgium, Denmark, France,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

   Prices on London's Stock Exchange shrugged off
further weakness in the pound to close higher Monday, paced by gains
in dollar-earning stocks.
   But trading activity was subdued in advance of Tuesday's release
of British trade figures for May. Also overshadowing the market was
suspense over the outcome of the European Community summit meeting
debate in Madrid on progress toward monetary union.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 12.1 points, or 0.6 percent, at 2,179.6.
   Volume was 369.9 million shares, down from 490.3 million shares
on Friday.
   The market was boosted from the outset by a favorable response to
Wall Street's strong gains on Friday. A lack of selling pressure
maintained the positive trend, even after the New York market opened
lower during the London afternoon.
   There was widespread caution, however, as traders speculated that
an adverse reaction by the pound to the British trade figures or to
the EC summit could trigger a sharp correction in share prices.
   ``The performance of sterling is by far the overriding
situation,'' one dealer said.

<HEAD>One Solution To Housing Affordability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First-time home buyers are on a financial
treadmill: Unable to afford a 20 percent down payment, they rent
instead, paying out so much each month that little remains for
savings.
   So common is the situation that nearly everyone knows someone
caught in that bind. Statistics seem to document it. Homeownership
for households in the 25-29 age group fell to 36.2 percent in 1988
from 43.3 percent in 1980.
   The primary reason for this trend, which directly contradicts the
dearly held notion that opportunity keeps growing in America, is the
inability of renter households to raise cash for a down payment and
closing costs.
   That conclusion was reached this month in a study by the Joint
Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, which suggested
the distribution of economic opportunity in American society was
thereby becoming polarized.
   It wasn't the first time that conclusion was reached. In fact,
U.S. Senate hearings were held this month on a National Affordable
Housing Act, which seeks to break the stalemate in a manner fair to
both renters and homeowners.
   No one proposal is likely to get things moving again in the lower
tier of housing markets, although it is widely agreed that federal
tax incentives and mortgage subsidies and outright government grants
might spur some activity.
   But in an age in which privatization attracts considerable
attention, little of that attention is directed to a reasonable and
intelligent solution that is so private it remains within the family.
   Simply stated, the solution is the opportunity for those with
housing equity, such as parents, to pass on that equity to offspring.
   The justice of it is unassailable. The reason some current owners
have such a large supply of equity is inflation. It is one of the
most important reasons, if not the primary reason, why their
children cannot afford to buy.
   The tax system seems to approve. A portion of equity can be
transferred by the owner without tax complications. In fact, there
could be tax advantages should the owner borrow on a primary
residence to finance an offspring's home.
   The money could be in the form of a gift or gifts, or it could be
as a loan. In the latter case, the rationale seems impeccable: It
would help a loved one, it would be a well-secured loan, it would
mean a high yield to the lender.
   In fact, where in the vast universe of investments would a lender
_ call him or her an investor or saver, if you prefer _ find a
sounder use for long-term money? Mortgage money, remember, is lent
at 10 percent or more.
   The timing may be propitious too. Many parents are beginning to
think of the day when they can retire, and that happy dream is
almost instantly followed by the worrisome topic of retirement
income. Here it is, a monthly check.
   The Harvard report, from its Joint Center for Housing Studies,
notes that only 11.5 percent, or 1.28 million, of the estimated 11.1
million renter households in the 25-34 age group have sufficient
assets and income to buy a starter home.
   Of that 11.1 million, the bigger of the drawbacks is assets, not
income.
   Many thousands of renters therefore would seem to qualify for a
low-cost starter home if they had the down payment. Lacking it, they
rent, and hope that their ability to save is stronger than the
advance in housing prices.
   If it isn't, they fall behind, and all because of a down payment
that already resides within the family.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of corn and soybeans closed sharply
lower Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid rain forecasts.
Wheat futures finished mostly higher on signs of large Soviet
purchases of U.S. wheat.
   Most corn contracts plunged more than 9 cents a bushel following
a wetter-than-expected weekend in Iowa, Nebraska and southwestern
Minnesota.
   More moisture was expected in the Midwest as the cold front moved
east.
   ``Two-thirds of the Corn Belt is expected to get rain today and
tomorrow,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Talk circulated that the Soviet Union had bought at least 500,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat on the open market.
   Analysts said the buying indicated that the Soviets needed wheat
immediately, since they usually buy U.S. grain through a subsidy
program, which takes longer.
   At the close of trading, wheat was 3{ cents lower to 4{ cents
higher with the contract for delivery in July at $4.02 a bushel;
corn was 4{ cents to 9{ cents lower with July at $2.57{ a bushel;
oats were 3} cents to 5 cents lower with July at $1.48\ a bushel;
soybeans were 1 cent to 12{ cents lower with July at $7.30 a bushel.

<HEAD>Sears Will Move 6,000-Employee Merchandise Group to Chicago Suburb</HEAD>

   Sears, Roebuck and Co. will move its 6,000-worker
merchandising hub from downtown Chicago to suburban Hoffman Estates,
the giant retailer announced Monday in capping a bidding war between
Illinois and the Sunbelt for the facility.
   Illinois won the contest with the aid of a $61 million package of
incentives, which was backed by local tax incentives reportedly
totaling up to $178 million.
   ``We believe this Chicagoland location will serve the best
interests of our company and its shareholders for decades to come,''
Chairman Edward Brennan said at a morning news conference in the
downtown Sears Tower.
   Last fall, the nation's largest retailer announced a
restructuring plan that includes selling the 110-story Sears Tower _
the world's tallest building _ and shifting the Merchandise Group
hub to less costly quarters.
   The announcement set off a fierce competition between Illinois
and Sunbelt states, especially North Carolina and Texas.
   Illinois offered a $61 million package of incentives to keep the
Merchandise Group headquarters, said Gov. James R. Thompson, who
joined Brennan at the news conference.
   Jay R. Hedges, director of the state Department of Commerce and
Community Affairs, said Sears would continue paying taxes, but about
80 percent of the tax revenue would be used for development costs of
the Hoffman Estates project.
   Illinois will recoup its investment during the Merchandise
Group's fifth year in its new headquarters, Hedges and Thompson said.
   Hoffman Estates offered a 20-year plan of tax incentives. The
Chicago Tribute in Monday's editions quoted an unnamed source as
valuing the village's incentives at $178 million, although neither
state nor village officials would confirm the figure.
   Peter T. Burchard, village manager in the middle-class suburb of
45,000, said local taxing districts would get $67 million in revenue
over the life of the local plan.
   Sears estimates that building a campus-style facility on the 200
acres it plans to use in Hoffman Estates will cost about $220
million. The rest of the tract also will be commercially developed
and Sears hopes to draw other corporate offices to the site, Brennan
said.
   Brennan said Sears _ which began in Chicago in 1887 _ was
expected to begin moving the merchandising operation to the Hoffman
Estates site, about 30 miles northwest of Chicago, in 2{ to three
years.
   When the Merchandise Group move is completed, about 600 employees
of Sears corporate staff will remain in the downtown Sears Tower,
Brennan said.
   ``We understand the strong ties which Sears has to Chicago and
know that the people of that great city are pleased to have the
decision in their favor,'' said Carroll Gray, president of the
Charlotte Chamber of Commerce.
   ``We understood all along that Chicago was probably Sears' first
choice,'' Gray said.
   Brennan also said Chicago had been the company's first choice,
but he believed it was his responsibility to Sears shareholders to
look at other prospective sites.
   Thompson said the incentive package was the biggest the state has
ever put together to keep jobs in Illinois. Illinois offered $88
million to entice Diamond-Star Motors to Normal in 1985.

   Sears Chairman Edward Brennan has a reputation as
a numbers man, and his decision to keep the Sears Merchandise Group
in the Chicago area is backed by some persuasive figures.
   Local tax breaks that reportedly could total $178 million, for
starters.
   But it is possible that sentimental factors also came into play
as Brennan and his team weighed the pros and cons of 50 potential
sites before settling on Hoffman Estates, a suburb about 30 miles
northwest of Chicago.
   Less than a month ago, rumors had the 6,000 employees of the
retailing unit's headquarters packed up and ready to roll to
Charlotte, N.C.
   Dallas was also in the running.
   But the decision announced Monday suggests that Sears'
century-old Chicago roots may run deeper than the Sunbelt sun could
reach.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. grew up here.
   And Brennan grew up with it.
   His grandfather, father, mother and two uncles all worked for the
company at a rambling West Side complex that contained distribution
facilities and, until the completion of Sears Tower in 1974, the
company's headquarters.
   Brennan joined Sears as a clerk in Madison, Wis., in 1956, just
after graduating from college, and moved to the Chicago headquarters
as a buyer in 1959.
   His climb up the corporate ladder entailed a series of
out-of-state assignments from 1967 until 1980, when he was brought
back to Illinois as head of the Merchandise Group.
   In addition to the Merchandise Group, Sears owns the Dean Witter
Reynolds financial services group, Allstate Insurance and the
Coldwell Banker real estate concern.
   Brennan has no great love for Sears Tower, the world's tallest
building, which the company is selling as part of its cost-cutting
plan. Nevertheless, his office will remain on the 68th floor of the
110-story skyscraper, after the retail group moves out.
   The relocation of the retailing headquarters will recreate for
those workers the sort of working environment that Brennan found so
agreeable as a young Sears executive.
   ``When you are housed in a vertical structure, you have less
people interaction than when you are in a low-rise, campus-type
environment,'' he said in an interview late last year. ``You have a
more cohesive organization when there's more people interaction.''
   The sale of the tower may occur by the end of this year, said
analyst Monroe Greenstein of Bear Stearns &amp; Co., who said Sears
insiders had told him they were in no rush to sell the building.
   Greenstein said the decision to move the retailing group to the
suburbs satisfied three major criteria.
   First, he said, Sears will avoid major disruptions of its
retailing operations, a particularly sensitive point because the
company recently launched an ambitious effort to lure more consumers
to its stores by offering lower prices and more brand names.
   Second, in addition to the 200-acre building site, the deal
includes 700 acres along an expressway, including an outdoor music
theater called Poplar Creek. Sears said the theater will continue
operating and Greenstein said Sear's commercialization of the
remaining land will pay for the construction of the Merchandise
Group's new headquarters.
   Third, Sears got all those tax breaks.
   Illinois offered a $61 million package of incentives. Also, the
Chicago Tribune quoted unidentified sources Monday saying the
village's incentives were worth $178 million, although neither state
nor village officials would confirm the amount.
   Greenstein and others said Sears ruled out North Carolina because
it would not have been a convenient destination for foreign
visitors, especially Sears' suppliers from Japan and South Korea.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court in business-related cases:
   
   FRAUD
   
   The court made it easier to use a key anti-racketeering law in
civil lawsuits against businesses accused of fraud.
   The court unanimously ruled that the law applies to more than
what is traditionally described as organized crime.
   The case is H.J. Inc. vs. Northwestern Bell, 87-1252.
   
   STRIKERS
   
   The court agreed to set guidelines on when employers may withdraw
recognition of a labor union after hiring new workers to break a
strike.
   The court said it will hear a Bush administration appeal of a
ruling favoring an employer in a case stemming from a 1979 strike
against a Texas laboratory supplies company.
   The case is NLRB vs. Curtin Matheson, 88-1685.
   
   LAWYER FEES
   
   The court rejected an appeal by an Illinois doctor ordered to pay
$254,000 in lawyers' fees to those who successfully challenged a
state abortion law.
   The court, consistent with a ruling by the justices last week in
an airline industry bias case, let stand a lower court ruling
stemming from a 1979 lawsuit challenging an Illinois
abortion-regulating law that included criminal penalties for
physicians who violated it.
   The case is Diamond vs. Charles, 88-664.
   
   AMOS `N' ANDY
   
   The court let stand a ruling that CBS Inc. no longer enjoys
trademark protection for the ``Amos `N' Andy'' radio and television
shows.
   The justices, without comment, refused to review a federal
appeals court ruling that CBS abandoned the trademarks when, under
pressure from civil rights groups, it suspended commercial use of
the shows.
   The case is CBS Inc. vs. Silverman, 88-1804.
   
   PUNITIVE DAMAGES
   
   The court ruled the Constitution's ban on excessive fines places
no limit on how much money can be won in personal-injury lawsuits.
   By a 7-2 vote, the justices refused to extend the prohibition
against the excessive fines to civil as well as criminal cases.
   But the justices left open the possibility that the
Constitution's due-process requirements could put a lid on punitive
damage awards. That issue was not raised properly in the case
decided today.
   The case is Browning-Ferris vs. Kelco Disposal, 88-556.

   Stock prices took a spill today as traders cashed
in some of the gains that carried the market to new post-crash highs
on Friday.
   The market's climb last week to new peaks since the debacle in
the fall of 1987 was spurred by accumulating evidence of a slowing
economy.
   As interest rates fell in the credit markets, rumors circulated
that the Federal Reserve might soon lower its discount rate, the
charge it sets on loans to private financial institutions.
   The Fed took no such step immediately, however, and traders began
the new week in a more cautious mood.
   Brokers also noted that the market was running out of support
from ``window dressing'' by money managers at investing institutions
readying their portfolios for midyear reports to clients.

<HEAD>Rig Count Gains 15 to total 810</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and natural gas rigs
continued an upward climb this week, growing by 15 rigs to total
810, according to Baker Hughes Inc.
   The increase marked the fifth straight weekly gain for the
nationwide count, which increased by four rigs last week. A year
ago, the count totaled 894, Baker Hughes reported Monday.
   The company's rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing
oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Oklahoma saw the biggest gain
with 19 additional rigs, followed by Louisiana, six; New Mexico and
Pennsylvania, two each; and Michigan and Ohio, one each.
   Texas posted the biggest decline for the week with six fewer
rigs, followed by Wyoming, California and Kansas, two each; and
Colorado, one. North Dakota was unchanged from the previous week.

   The dollar ended higher Monday against most major
currencies following last week's selloff.
   Gold prices declined. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
troy ounce of gold at $374 as of 4 p.m. EDT, down $3 from late
Friday.
   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's rebound largely to
technical factors following last week's decline, which some analysts
described as a correction in an otherwise bullish market.
   ``The market was inclined to buy,'' said Robert Ryan, senior
trader at Irving Trust Co.
   Dealers said there were reports of dollar-selling by the Federal
Reserve, but that had little effect on the market.
   The British pound, meanwhile, came under continued selling
pressure despite intervention by the Bank of England.
   Traders said there were no new factors pressuring the pound
Monday. But sterling has been depressed recently by worries about
industrial unrest, Britain's trade deficit and inflation, which is
currently running at 8 percent.
   In London, it cost $1.5450 to buy one pound, cheaper for buyers
than $1.5675 late Friday. Later, in New York, sterling fetched
$1.5447, down from 1.5645.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.17 Japanese yen to a closing 140.18 yen. It was
quoted higher at 140.65 yen in London, and at 141.10 yen in New
York, up from 138.85 yen late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday,
included: 1.9590 West German marks, up from 1.9425; 1.6882 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6660; 1.1940 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1942;
6.6480 French francs, up from 6.6000; and 1,416.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,410.50.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Friday, included:
1.9552 West German marks, up from 1.9390; 1.6840 Swiss francs, up
from 1.6690; 6.6380 French francs, up from 6.5790; 2.2003 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.1850; 1,414.00 Italian lire, up from 1,412.50;
and 1.1940 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1910.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $375.10 a troy ounce, down from Friday's $378.50
bid.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $375.25 an ounce, down
from Friday's $377.75. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold was higher,
closing at $374.25 an ounce, up from $370.00.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 42 cents to close at a bid
$376.26 an ounce.
   Silver prices finished mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $5.306 a troy ounce, down from
$5.330 Friday. Silver rose in London to a late bid price of $5.33 an
ounce from $5.26.

   France, angered by Britain's rejection of a
single European currency and central bank, threatened Monday to
renege on an agreement that forms part of the drive for a united
European market by 1992.
   Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher refused at the opening
session of a two-day summit to embrace a plan for a tight monetary
union of the 12 nations of the European Economic Community.
   Her opposition prompted French President Francois Mitterrand to
threaten to renege on promises for more liberalized money markets.
   ``If there is no agreement ... as a totality, then countries who
are committed to lifting exchange controls could be led to revise
their position,'' a French spokesman quoted Mitterrand as saying in
the closed-door session.
   Spanish officials worked late Monday trying to win backing for a
four-point compromise proposal to submit to the leaders Tuesday, the
final day of the semi-annual summit.
   Its most controversial point seeks backing for moves to create a
common central bank.
   The leaders had gone into the summit at odds over key parts of
the plan, supported most enthusiastically by France, West Germany
and Spain and opposed by Britain.
   This split surfaced in their daylong closed-door talks.
   ``The rough work was in the hands of President Mitterrand, who
said it quite strongly, while the nuances were with'' West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl,'' said Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers.
   Kohl urged his colleagues to accept the far-reaching changes.
   Mrs. Thatcher said she supported closer monetary and economic
cooperation but objected to the two subsequent stages that would
lead to a single central bank and a common currency in the trading
bloc.
   ``Decisions on these matters are simply not on the current
agenda,'' a British official quoted Mrs. Thatcher as telling other
leaders during the closed-door session. ``We must stick to the
practical and go for what needs to be done now.''
   Britain was backed at times by The Netherlands, Portugal and
Luxembourg.
   The moves for monetary union have added a new dimension to the
EEC's plans to fashion a single market by the end of 1992. By that
date, the nations want to remove the many trade barriers that
prevent the free movement of people, goods, services and money.
   Officials said there was general agreement the 12 nations should
cooperate more in economic and monetary matters.
   ``We commit ourselves to the goal of the economic and monetary
union process,'' said the British official. ``What we have not
committed ourselves to is a process as defined in (the report).''
   As part of endorsing a first stage of the plan, which would begin
in July 1990, Mrs. Thatcher pledged to link the pound to the other
major European currencies by joining the exchange rate mechanism of
the European Monetary System.
   But Mrs. Thatcher said Britain would join the system only if
Britain's 8.3 percent inflation rate was ``reduced significantly,''
other EEC nations abolished controls on their currencies by July
1990 and Europe provides for an open market in banking and financial
services.
   Only the currencies of Britain, Greece and Portugal are not full
members.
   EEC members are: Britain, Belgium, France, Germany, Denmark,
Luxembourg, Spain, Greece, Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands and
Ireland.

<HEAD>Court Eases Use of Racketeering Law in Civil Suits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled Monday that federal
anti-racketeering law is not just aimed at mobsters, making it
easier to use the statute in lawsuits against businesses being sued
for fraud.
   The court unanimously reinstated a lawsuit against Northwestern
Bell Telephone Co. by Minnesota consumers. The civil suit accused
the utility of violating the federal Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO.
   Congress may have passed the RICO law because of ``the perceived
need to combat organized crime,'' Justice William J. Brennan said
for the court. ``But Congress for cogent reasons chose to enact a
more general statute, one which, although it had organized crime as
its focus, was not limited in application to organized crime.''
   In another case, the high court agreed to set guidelines on when
employers may withdraw recognition of a labor union after hiring new
workers to break a strike.
   The RICO case, which accused Northwestern Bell of bribing state
public utility officials, had been dismissed by the 8th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
   The appeals court ruled that the phone company's customers failed
to prove ``a pattern of racketeering activity'' required to make a
case under RICO.
   The consumers claim that the utility began in 1981 illegal
attempts to win rate increases by offering gifts, employment and
other favors to members of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.
   The 8th Circuit said a single fraudulent scheme is insufficient,
ruling that at least two schemes must be alleged.
   But Brennan rejected that argument, saying that to prove a
pattern of racketeering activity, a private plaintiff or a
prosecutor must show at least two criminal acts ``within a single
scheme that were related and that amounted to, or threatened the
likelihood of, continued criminal activity.''
   Other federal appeals courts have allowed civil RICO suits based
on numerous acts advancing only one fraudulent scheme.
   RICO claims are often found in lawsuits involving virtually any
business dispute. The stigma attached to being linked in public
court documents to alleged racketeering can be powerful leverage for
out-of-court settlements.
   Winners of RICO cases may collect triple damages and lawyer fees,
which generally are not available under state anti-fraud laws.
   Justice Department lawyers, in court papers submitted last year,
sided with the phone customers, urging a broad interpretation of the
RICO law.
   Also backing the customers were 14 states: Arizona, California,
Connecticut, Idaho, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, North
Carolina, Oregon, Texas, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and
Wyoming.
   But other interests urged the high court to bar the lawsuit. The
AFL-CIO, for example, said that ``private civil RICO actions have
become a tool of harassment ... against legitimate businesses and
labor organizations.''
   In the strike-breaker case, the court agreed to hear a Bush
administration appeal of a ruling stemming from a 1979 strike
against a Texas laboratory supplies company.
   Curtin Matheson Scientific Inc. was struck in 1979 by workers at
its Houston warehouse after a union contract expired and the company
locked out all 27 Teamsters union members employed there.
   Five of the 27 employees crossed the picket line when the strike
began June 13, 1979, and 12 days later, the company hired 29 new
employees to replace the remaining 22 strikers.
   When the union later offered to end the strike under terms
previously offered by management, the company withdrew the offer
along with its recognition of the union as the workers' bargaining
agent.
   The National Labor Relations Board in 1987 said the company
illegally withdrew its recognition of the union but the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals overruled the board last November.
   In other decisions announced Monday, the high court:
   _Ruled, 7-2, that skyrocketing punitive damages awards in
personal injury lawsuits do not violate the Constitution's ban on
excessive fines. The decision left open the possibility that such
hefty awards violate due-process rights.
   _Ordered a lower court to restudy a dispute over drug and alcohol
testing for transit workers employed by the Southeastern
Pennsylvania Transportation Authority.
   _Decided to review a decision requiring W.S. Kirkpatrick &amp; Co., a
New Jersey corporation, to defend itself against allegations that it
bribed Nigerian government officials to win a contract to develop an
aeromedical center.
   _Let stand a ruling that CBS Inc. no longer enjoys trademark
protection for the ``Amos `N' Andy'' radio and television shows.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Sag To 11-Month Low On International Discord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices sagged to an 11-month low Monday on New
York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange amid growing pessimism about
the International Coffee Organization's ability to keep its grip on
price controls.
   On other markets, orange juice futures soared; corn and soybean
futures dropped while wheat advanced; livestock and meat futures
rallied; oil futures rose; and precious metals slumped.
   Green, unroasted coffee settled 1.63 cents to 6.05 cents lower
with the contract for delivery in July at $1.11 a pound, the
market's lowest close since Aug. 2, 1988.
   The sell-off was sparked by news Friday that Colombia, the
world's second-largest coffee producer, would move to abolish all
export quotas unless members of the International Coffee
Organization approve a new price-support agreement at their meeting
next Monday in London.
   The ICO, composed of 74 major coffee-producing and consuming
nations, attempts to control coffee prices by limiting the amount of
coffee that each producer country may sell to the consumers.
   Discord among the members has led to fears that the current
6-year agreement will expire Sept. 30 without a pact to succeed it,
leaving coffee prices open to free-market forces for the first time
since 1963.
   ICO members will consider two proposals next week, one to extend
the current agreement with no change in quotas and the other to
extend the agreement with changes to increase the availability of
mild arabica coffees, the type most in demand.
   ``The two proposals are expected to be voted on but both are
expected to be rejected,'' said Sandra Kaul, a coffee-market analyst
in New York with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Traders fear that if Colombia introduces a motion to abandon all
quotas, other producer countries will approve it and coffee will
flood the market.
   Orange juice futures settled at or near the 5-cents-a-pound daily
limit on the New York Cotton Exchange despite a lack of fresh
supply-and-demand news. The market has been rising on supply
concerns linked to the slow pace of the Brazilian orange harvest.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice settled 3.85 cents to 5 cents
higher with July at $1.86 a pound.
   Corn and soybean futures fell steeply on the Chicago Board of
Trade amid rain forecasts for the Midwest, but wheat futures
finished mostly higher on signs of large Soviet purchases of U.S.
wheat.
   Talk circulated that the Soviet Union had bought at least 500,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat on the open market.
   Wheat settled 3{ cents lower to 4\ cents higher with July at
$4.01} a bushel; corn was 4\ cents to 9{ cents lower with July at
$2.57} a bushel; oats were 3} cents to 5 cents lower with July at
$1.48\ a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 12 cents lower with July
at $7.31 a bushel.
   Frozen pork-belly futures leaped on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange following Friday's monthly cold-storage report from the
Agriculture Department, which pegged belly supplies much lower than
expected.
   Frozen pork bellies settled .90 cent to 2 cents higher with July

hogs were .05 cent lower to .60 cent higher with July at 49.97 cents

   West Texas Intermediate crude settled 9 cents to 54 cents higher

higher with July at 49.65 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .15
cent to .77 cent higher with July at 63.69 cents a gallon.
   Gold futures retreated on New York's Commodity Exchange following
strong gains last week. Analysts said a stronger dollar kept the
market under pressure.
   Gold settled $3.40 to $4 lower with August at $378.30 an ounce;
silver was 2.3 cents to 2.4 cents lower with July at $5.31 a troy
ounce.

   Toy executive Stephen D. Hassenfeld,
chairman and chief executive of Hasbro Inc., was praised Monday as
unequaled among his peers, but his death left questions about the
company's future.
   Hassenfeld, 47, died of pneumonia and cardiac arrest Sunday night
at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, where he had been hospitalized
for four weeks, said Hasbro spokesman Wayne Charness.
   ``I believe that within the next year, you will see the company
sold. It's an attractive property in the industry,'' said Paul
Valentine, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   Valentine said he expected Hassenfeld's family, which owns 13.1
percent of the Pawtucket-based toymaker, eventually would re-examine
its position.
   ``With Stephen gone and the company now a larger, more
bureaucratic organization, the fun has probably gone out of this
business for the Hassenfeld family,'' he said.
   Valentine estimated the sale price at $32 per share, but higher
if the company performs better than expected this year.
   Hasbro common stock closed at $22.25, up 25, cents on the
American Exchange Monday. Its volume of nearly 1.2 million shares
made it the second most heavily traded issue on the exchange.
   But, said analyst Walter Kirchberger at PaineWebber Group Inc.,
``Stephen's absence doesn't mean the company is without a leader.
...That's not to say that Stephen won't be missed but there are
competent and qualified people'' to run the company.
   Charness did not know when Hasbro directors would meet to select
a successor. Hasbro President Alan Hassenfeld, 40, who is
Hassenfeld's brother, has run the company in combination with a team
of senior management.
   ``We continue as we have for the last month,'' Charness said.
   Hassenfeld built Hasbro into a toy giant, with more than $1.3
billion in sales from well-known products including G.I. Joe,
Transformers, My Little Pony and Mr. Potato Head. The company's
revenue was just $102 million 10 years ago.
   Hassenfeld bought companies such as the Milton Bradley Co. in
1984 and developed a diverse line of low-cost products, although the
company last year scrapped plans for an interactive video and
electronic game system called Nemo after reportedly spending
millions of dollars on research and development.
   Hasbro recently announced it would acquire assets of financially
troubled Coleco Industries of Avon, Conn., maker of Cabbage Patch
Kids and other toys.
   ``Stephen Hassenfield stands out virtually without a peer in the
toy industry over the past 10 years. He created what I refer to as
the modern American toy company. A broadly based, well diversified
toy company,'' Valentine said.
   Hassenfeld, who was born in Providence, joined Hasbro in 1964 and
was named executive vice president of marketing and elected to the
board of directors in 1968. He became president in 1974 and chairman
in 1980.
   In mid-1987, Hassenfeld was treated, also at Columbia
Presbyterian, for what he later said was endocarditis, a bacterial
infection of the heart valve and lining.
   His brother said Hassenfeld never fully recovered from the heart
infection, partly because he was allergic to antibiotics used to
treat the illness.
   Word of Hassenfeld's illness a month ago prompted heavy trading
in Hasbro stock.
   At the time, John T. O'Neill, Hasbro's chief financial officer,
dismissed rumors of a hostile takeover. The Hassenfeld family owns
13.1 percent of the company stock and Warner Communications owns
13.6 percent in a voting trust controlled by the Hassenfeld
brothers. Hasbro has the right of first refusal to purchase Warner's
stock.
   Nevertheless, Hasbro adopted a ``poison pill'' earlier this month
which would give existing shareholders the right to by additional
stock in the event of a hostile takeover.

   Stock prices turned downward Monday as traders
cashed in some of the gains that carried the market to new
post-crash highs last week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 49.70 points on
Friday, dropped back 20.49 to 2,511.38.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
630 up, 840 down and 498 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 143.60 million
shares, down from 198.72 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 171.38 million shares.
   The market's climb last week to new peaks since the debacle in
the fall of 1987 was spurred by accumulating evidence of a slowing
economy.
   As interest rates fell in the credit markets, rumors circulated
that the Federal Reserve might soon lower its discount rate, the
charge it sets on loans to private financial institutions.
   The Fed took no such step immediately, however, and traders began
the new week in a more cautious mood.
   Brokers also noted that the market was running out of support
from ``window dressing'' by money managers at investing institutions
readying their portfolios for midyear reports to clients.
   The dropoff in activity fit a recent pattern. Monday has been the
slowest session of each week so far in June.
   Time Inc. fell 1~ to 164 after trading early in the session as
high as 172\. Late Friday Paramount Communications, bidding to wrest
Time away from a planned merger with Warner Communications,
increased its offer for Time from $175 a share to $200 a share.
   Paramount gained 2] to 60] and Warner rose \ to 58~.
   Losers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, down 1| at
140~; Coca-Cola, down 1 at 58~; Procter &amp; Gamble, down 1[ at 113];
General Electric, down | at 54[, and USX, down 2\ at 34}.
   There was talk that financier Carl Icahn, often rumored to be
considering a bid for USX, might have cooled on that idea or decided
to pursue other ventures.
   Hasbro, among the American Stock Exchange volume leaders, gained
\ to 22\. The company was discussed as a possible takeover candidate
after the news of the death of Stephen Hassenfeld, its chairman and
chief executive.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $10.97 billion, or 0.34
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 0.66 to 182.20.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.76 to 373.30, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was down 1.40 at 326.60.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slipped 1.07 to 447.29. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 364.01, down .24.

   Energy futures finished higher Monday, led by a
surge in crude oil prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the August contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, broke through
the $20 level, settling 54 cents higher at $20.25 a barrel. The
contract had traded as low as $19.78 during the session.
   September crude rose 47 cents to close at $19.42 a barrel, while
contracts for later delivery posted more modest gains.
   Among refined products, the July contract for unleaded gasoline
advanced 0.77 cent to finish at 63.69 cents a gallon and heating oil
rose 0.16 cent to 49.65 cents a gallon. Other contract months also
finished higher.
   With little economic news to drive prices, analysts attributed
Monday's advances mainly to technical factors and to OPEC-related
news.
   Two separate publications reported that Kuwaiti oil output, while
still above the quota set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, is declining. Kuwait at a meeting earlier this month had
rejected its OPEC-imposed production ceiling and set its own quota,
saying it needed to exploit its massive oil reserves.
   ``The reports came through, the market reacted briefly but the
impact wasn't lasting,'' said Michael Hiley, energy analyst with
Drexel Burham Lambert Inc.
   Kuwait's oil minister Sheik Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah also was quoted
as denying that Kuwait increased its oil sales after the OPEC
meeting in Vienna, Austria, earlier this month. The minister said
that the emirate's sales blitz, which started before the conference,
was halted within days of the meeting's conclusion.

<HEAD>Executives Leaving as Part of Previously Announced Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five Northrop Corp. executives are retiring or
being reassigned as part of a streamlining program that includes the
previously announced elimination of 2,500 to 3,000 rank-and-file
jobs.
   The moves announced Monday come as the company faces
congressional efforts to cut spending on its premier program, the
B-2 stealth bomber, and as longtime chief executive Thomas V. Jones
transfers power to his successor.
   Retiring are two senior vice presidents: C.R. ``Bob'' Gates, 64,
who headed international marketing, and Joseph P. Gallagher, 52, in
charge of programs. Gallagher will leave active management but
continue as a consultant on fighter plane development, the company
said.
   Three vice-presidents' jobs under Gallagher are being cut, said
spokesman Tony Cantafio.
   The company has previously said that it would cut its workforce
by 2,500 to 3,000 by the end of the year. The main reason given for
the cuts is that the B-2 is moving from development to production,
and fewer workers are required.
   Jones, the chairman and chief executive who will pass CEO's
responsibilities at the end of the year to Kent Kresa, president and
chief operating officer, told stockholders earlier this year to
expect changes in management ranks.
   One industry analyst, John Simon of Seidler Amdec Securities Inc.
in Los Angeles, saw the changes as moves by Kresa to put his own
stamp on management.
   ``There's nothing unusual here,'' Simon said. ``These are the
kinds of things that happen when a new guy comes in.''
   Another analyst, Paul Nisbet of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
in New York, said elimination of foreign marketing hierarchy makes
sense since the company has less overseas business than in the past.
It is ending production of the F-5 fighter plane, sold to foreign
air forces, and electronics sales also are slower overseas than
previously.
   The three other executives leaving or being reassigned are: Jaime
Oaxaca, vice president of total quality management, retiring in
July; Robert D. Lovell, vice president of manufacturing, who will go
on special assignment to the B-2 division; and Lou Carrier, vice
president for program management, who will be transferred to the
aircraft division.

   Lawrence Chimerine is stepping down as chairman
and chief executive of WEFA Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of an
international economic forecasting and consulting firm, ``by mutual
consent,'' the parent company said Monday.
   WEFA Group, the parent company, said Chimerine's job had been
eliminated and the U.S. subsidiary would report to an executive
committee, as other subsidiaries do. It said Chimerine would
maintain a limited association with the firm as a senior economic
adviser and keep his office.
   WEFA Group, of Bala Cynwyd, Pa., was formed by the merger of
Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates Inc. and Chase
Econometrics Inc. in 1987 and is owned by WEF Associates of Basel,
Switzerland.
   ``There was a changing environment and Larry decided he wanted to
pursue other things,'' Gerard Vila, the WEFA Group chairman, said in
an interview.
   Vila said it no longer made sense to have a separate chairman for
the U.S. operation because the firm had become multinational. And he
said clients were demanding comprehensive business data and advice
``as opposed to narrowly defined macroeconomic forecasting.''
Forecasting is Chimerine's specialty.
   Chimerine said he was prevented from discussing the reasons for
his departure and called it ``a long story.'' He said his plans were
uncertain but would include outside speaking and consulting work.
   ``I'm delighted,'' he said. ``I've been thinking of doing other
things for a long time and this will give me an opportunity to do
it.''

   Honeywell Inc. said Monday it intends to cut 250
jobs at its semiconductor operation in Colorado Springs, Colo., and
Wang Laboratories Inc. said it plans to sell a personal computer
factory in Scotland that employs 239 people.
   Also, Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., said it
planned to phase out its BBN Communications AS unit in Denmark,
resulting in 200 employees eventually losing their jobs. The unit is
finishing work on an airline reservations network and has no new
jobs to sustain it.
   Honeywell said its cuts would be accomplished mainly by layoffs.
It said business shrank when Control Data Corp. closed its ETA
Systems supercomputer company and stopped buying chips for the
machines.
   Minneapolis-based Honeywell said it was going ahead with the sale
of the semiconductor operation to Atmel Corp., a privately held
company in San Jose, Calif. The cuts would reduce the operation's
staff about 24 percent.
   Wang, of Lowell, Mass., said it would consolidate the work being
done at its Stirling, Scotland, plant at a larger plant in Limerick,
Ireland. It said it hoped to sell the plant intact to some other
computer company but would also offer jobs in Limerick to some of
its Stirling employees.

   Dennis Suprenant said he asked the National Association of

   Trading volume during those two days jumped to 212,700 shares one
day and 253,200 the next, compared with an average of 41,800 shares
changing hands daily before then.
   The price also jumped $2 to $14 per share during those two days.
The stock is traded on the NASD's automated over-the-counter market.
   ``Typically, if we see that kind of price and volume movement, we
would ask the NASD to take a look,'' Suprenant said. ``We have a
method of inquiring who the market makers were, who was trading the

   Enno Hodding, an NASD spokesman, confirmed the investigation was

   Gtech makes computerized equipment used by state and federal
lottery systems worldwide.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A non-smokers organization is fired up over a
cigarette manufacturer's campaign to have Pittsburgh restaurants
post signs declaring smokers and non-smokers are welcome.
   Bill Godshall, spokesman for the Association for NonSmokers
Rights of Pennsylvania, filed a complaint with the Federal Trade
Commission against Philip Morris Cos. Inc. for failing to include
the U.S. Surgeon General's tobacco warning in ads promoting
``Accommodation: The New Sign of the Times.''
   The nation's largest cigarette manufacturer placed ads in
newspapers and billboards advising people to look for a
red-and-green emblem at restaurants showing that they have
designated areas for smokers and non-smokers.
   Godshall on Monday condemned the campaign ``as an attempt to
encourage people to smoke.''
   But Philip Morris spokesman Les Zuke said the campaign is ``a way
for the business owner to convey a special message to his
customers.''
   Zuke said FTC rules require cigarette manufacturers to print the
Surgeon General's warning that smoking can be dangerous to a
person's health on their products and in their ads. He said ads for
the Pittsburgh campaign promote an idea, not tobacco.
   ``We wouldn't bring a campaign to Pittsburgh without checking
first,'' he said. ``We're promoting rights for smokers and
non-smokers ... courtesy and tolerance.''
   More than 170 restaurants have agreed to display the emblem, he
said. In exchange, the restaurants are mentioned in advertisements
appearing in the Pittsburgh area over four months.
   ``We are not paying them anything at all,'' Zuke said.
   Half of the sign contains a smoking cigarette against a
background of green. The non-smoker half of the sign is red.
   Philip Morris said it chose Pittsburgh to launch the campaign
because of the number of letters it said it received from customers
confused by a smoking ordinance that took effect last year. More
customers wrote from Pittsburgh than from any other city that
restricts smoking in public places, Zuke said.

   Some of the equipment at Volkswagen of

China.
   A team of Chinese automotive engineers has been working at the
New Stanton plant to acquire old conveyor, body shop, painting and
other equipment, said Tom McDonald, a spokesman at VW's U.S.
headquarters in Troy, Mich.
   McDonald said Volkswagen is in ``contractural discussions'' with
First Automobile Works of China to buy the equipment, which he
described as obsolete.
   ``The assumption is that (negotiations) will be finished,''
McDonald said. ``They're here now to study the equipment and start
up some of the equipment ... and presumably they will be here for
the crating up of it and the shipping of it.''
   The 11-year-old plant, about 30 miles southeast of Pittsburgh,
closed last July after Volkswagen reported declining U.S. sales of
the Golf and Jetta models it made. It was the first plant built by a
foreign automaker in the United States to close.
   McDonald said Volkswagen has moved selected equipment from the
factory to its plants in Mexico, Brazil and West Germany. Both the
company and state officials have been looking for a buyer for the
plant.

   The head of the coal miners' union on
Monday accepted a new, unconditional offer from Gov. Gaston Caperton
for talks aimed at ending a union walkout and related wildcat
strikes by nearly 43,000 miners.
   But the chairman of coal company that is the object of the unrest
said he's tied up with jury duty this week.
   Also Monday, a federal judge in Virginia fined the union $240,000
for its strike tactics against Pittston, while a federal judge in
Clarksburg refused to order strikers back to work.
   Wildcat strikes in sympathy with United Mine Workers strike
against the Pittston Co. continued Monday in West Virginia,
Illinois, Pennsylvania, Alabama, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Virginia
and Tennessee. However, most UMW members began their two-week
vacations this week, and the coal fields have been relatively quiet
since the weekend.
   About 350 UMW members in Missouri ended their wildcat strike
Monday and called on Caperton to help end the union's dispute with
Pittston. They also asked him to bring a halt to violence that
erupted on picket lines in the past week.
   In addition, a federal judge in Charleston reset hearings on
whether to bar more wildcat strikes and find miners in contempt for
ignoring his back-to-work orders.
   Caperton invited Pittston Chairman Paul Douglas and UMW President
Richard Trumka last week to meet at the governor's mansion and hash
out a contract. Trumka accepted.
   But Caperton tacked on four conditions that led Douglas to reject
it: that both sides negotiate in good faith; that Pittston not use
any other coal companies to fill its orders; that the union end all
wildcat strikes; and that other companies suing the UMW because of
the strikes suspend their litigation.
   On Monday, Caperton dropped the conditions and reissued the offer.
   Trumka again accepted.
   Douglas declined to say if he would accept, adding he has been
called for jury duty in New York this week. However, Douglas said
from Pittston headquarters in Greenwich, Conn., ``Any communication
we get from the governor will get due consideration.''
   Pittston has said its last contract offer, made June 9, will be
its best. After the UMW rejected that offer, Pittston declared an
impasse and imposed its own contract at its operations.
   About 1,600 UMW miners in Virginia and West Virginia went on
strike against Pittston on April 5 after working for 14 months
without a contract. They were joined by 300 Kentucky miners earlier
this month.
   That strike spurred sympathy walkouts around the coal fields.
Since June 12, when the wildcat strikes began, 43,000 miners in 10
states have gone off the job.
   Figures released Monday by the U.S. Energy Information
Administration show that national coal production fell 1.2 million
tons, from 19.5 million to 18.3 million, in the week following the
start of the wildcat strikes.
   Caperton said his offer to be host of negotiations has improved
the atmosphere in the coal fields.
   ``It has evidenced itself in the form of a calmer, gentler
atmosphere in our coal fields, a sense that something versus nothing
is being done,'' he said.
   A teen-ager was grazed with a bullet on a West Virginia picket
line last week, and pickets at a Kentucky mine overturned a jeep
being ridden by a company official. Shots also have been fired at
mines in Alabama.
   In Charleston, U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp reset a hearing
for July 3 on five coal companies' request that the UMW and its
members be held in contempt for ignoring his back-to-work orders.
Knapp's office also said the judge has reset for July 11 a hearing
on 13 companies' request that he issue a preliminary injunction to
halt wildcat walkouts in West Virginia, Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky.
Both of those hearings originally were set for last Friday.
   In Abingdon, Va., U.S. District Judge Glen Williams ruled that
daily convoys on coal hauling roads are being orchestrated by the
union and violate his order prohibiting the UMW from blocking the
movement of coal trucks.
   Williams found the UMW and two officials in contempt of court and
issued fines totaling $240,000.
   In Clarksburg, U.S. District Judge William Kidd denied
Consolidation Coal Co.'s request that he order its union miners back
to work in Monongalia, Marion and Harrison counties. Kidd also
dissolved a temporary restraining order against picketing at the
mines.
   And in another court development in Kentucky, Pittston's Eastern
Coal Co. subsidiary subpoenaed an Associated Press correspondent's
film of a union rally as part of a civil suit it has filed against
the UMW.
   Jon Fleischaker, a Louisville attorney representing correspondent
Rob Wells and the AP, said he intends to fight the company's request.

Monday to protest General Motors Corp.'s proposed settlement of a
discrimination suit.
   U.S. District Judge John Feikens told the black workers he would
consider their objections to the settlement and make a decision in
the case soon, said Napoleon Quick Jr., a spokesman for the
Concerned Black Salaried Employees of General Motors.
   The group last week called for the black community to boycott GM
products until it wins a more favorable settlement in the suit,
first filed in 1983 by four salaried black GM workers.
   The suit was certified in 1986 as a class action on behalf of
10,000 such workers in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. If accepted, the
settlement would amount to $20 million to $40 million over the next
five years for the plaintiffs, their attorneys have said.
   ``The proposal is grossly inadequate and calls for setting up a
double-model standard to monitor black salaries versus white, which
represents a problem in itself,'' said Quick, 52, of Detroit, a
former GM personnel administrator.
   Quick said the automaker's proposal to monitor black workers' pay
and promotion for five years and to assess that information using
computer models for comparable white employees establishes a double
standard.
   GM also has offered to pay cash settlements to some workers and
raise the salaries of othes. But the automaker does not admit to
discriminating against blacks in pay and promotions.

<HEAD>Ford Idles Two Plants An Extra Week</HEAD>

   Ford Motor Co. said Monday that it will idle its
Chicago and Atlanta assembly plants for a third week after their
normal two-week summer shutdown this year.
   The week of July 17 will be added to both plants' normal two-week
shutdown for changeover from production of 1989- to 1990-model
automobiles, Ford spokesman Joel Pitcoff said.
   The extended shutdown resulted from a delay in obtaining parts
for 1990 models with new passive restraint systems and wasn't meant
to reduce inventories, Pitcoff said.
   The Chicago plant employs about 2,300 hourly employees and the
Atlanta plant employs about 2,150. Both produce the popular Ford
Taurus and Mercury Sable automobiles.
   Ford has about a 54-day supply of Taurus cars and a 59-day supply
of Sable cars on hand, compared with a normal 65-day inventory at
this time of year, Pitcoff said.
   Pitcoff was quoted by The New York Times in Tuesday's editions as
saying that the parts delay caused the company to delay the start of
1990 production by a week at each plant.
   Because of the delay, Ford asked its dealers to buy an extra
week's worth of 1989 models. But the dealers balked because the
company already had begun taking orders for the 1990 models. The
dealers' reluctance prompted the company to shut the plants for an
extra week.
