   PTL evangelist Jim Bakker was convicted
Thursday of using his television show to defraud followers of $3.7
million, money the jury foreman said corrupted a minister who
started out to do good.
   ``He was called by God. But eventually the money became too much
for him,'' said foreman Ricky Hill, who said during jury selection
that he was a Christian. ``We kept looking for something from the
defense and we never saw it.''
   Bakker faces a maximum sentence of 120 years in prison and $5
million in fines. The U.S. District Court jury convicted him of all
24 counts in the indictment, which charged he oversold lodging
guarantees, called ``lifetime partnerships,'' at his Heritage USA
religious retreat.
   The government said 152,903 partnerships were sold, producing
$158 million.
   ``The message is you can't lie to the people and use television
and the mails to get them to send you money,'' said prosecutor
Deborah Smith. ``It doesn't matter who you are or how well known
you are, you simply can't do it.''
   Defense lawyer George C. Davis said the verdict would be
appealed.
   Prosecutors said Bakker diverted $3.7 million in ministry funds
for personal use while knowing PTL was in financial trouble. He
used money from PTL for vacation homes in California and Florida, a
lakefront parsonage, a houseboat, Rolls-Royce and Mercedes cars and
more peculiar luxuries such as an air-conditioned doghouse.
   Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye, said she and her husband would return
to Orlando, Fla., where they moved the die-hard remnants of their
ministry.
   ``It's not over until it's over,'' added Mrs. Bakker during a
news conference after the verdict. Hundreds of Bakker faithful and
the lunchtime curious flocked around the courthouse, and Mrs.
Bakker serenaded them with a verse of ``On Christ, the solid rock,
I stand. All other ground is sinking sand.''
   Bakker was freed later Thursday on $250,000 bond imposed by U.S.
District Court Judge Robert Potter. The judge set sentencing for
Oct. 24.
   ``I'm going to keep my faith in God and I'm going to go see
Tammy now. I feel sad but encouraged in God,'' Bakker said, smiling
in a brief midafternoon statement to reporters. He said he was
``still innocent of the charges against me.''
   Potter said he granted bond reluctantly because Bakker faithful
had a ``Jim Jones mentality'' and might help him flee the country.
   ``They think he could walk on water,' Potter said.
   Davis declared the reference to the 1978 murder-suicide of 900
followers of Jim Jones' cult in Jonestown, Guyana, ``horrible,
absolutely uncalled for.''
   Bakker showed little emotion as the verdict was read. Tears
welled in the eyes of Mrs. Bakker, who also received large bonuses
from PTL but was not charged with any crimes.
   The jury foreman said he was unswayed by Bakker's testimony, in
which he defended his earnings as reasonable for someone who raised
millions of dollars for the work of the Lord.
   ``He was a man of God. He got corrupt and I feel sorry for the
man,'' Hill said. He said that in the day and a half of jury
deliberations, ``The most disagreement was when the fraud started.''
   Trial testimony showed PTL paid $265,000 to Jessica Hahn to
cover up the sexual encounter with Bakker that led to his
resignation fom PTL in 1987.
   ``I'm sorry I don't have a song to sing like Tammy but I know
this is God's amazing grace,'' Ms. Hahn said in a statement after
the conviction.
   ``I don't feel sad for what happened to Bakker,'' she said.
``I'd like to look him in the eye and tell him, `Get out the
rowboat, you can't walk on water.'
   ``This is going to go down in history as saying, `you can touch
even the mightiest of men who are armed with Bibles, white collars
and microphones,'' she said. ``Today's verdict is not attacking
God, but the people who are abusing God.''
   Reaction to the conviction varied among trial spectators.
   ``I think it's wonderful,'' said Beverly Sparrow. ``He deserves
everything he's going to get.''
   ``My faith was that he would be set free on all charges,'' said
Bill Fisher of Fort Mill, S.C. ``I still believe he will.''
   The trial started Aug. 28 and was interrupted Aug. 31 when
Bakker didn't come to court. His attorneys told the judge Bakker
was in a fetal position with his head under a couch.
   After a brief hearing about the emotional collapse, Potter
ordered Bakker sent to a prison psychiatric ward. He was declared
fit to resume the trial Sept. 6.
   A key to the government's case was the sale of about 153,000
partnerships between 1984 and 1987. The partnerships typically
promised three free nights' stay annually for life in exchange for
a $1,000 donation, and Bakker testified that there was room for
211,000 partners. Government evidence showed that Bakker had only
258 rooms available.
   Several partners testified they were never able to use the
lodging Bakker had promised. Bakker's former second-in-command,
Richard Dortch, indicated in his testimony that Bakker knew he was
making false promises.
   Dortch, 57, pleaded guilty in a plea bargain to two counts of
wire fraud and one count each of mail fraud and conspiracy. He was
given an eight-year prison term and fined $200,000.

   An artist said he felt like he was ``painting on
a global canvas'' when he winged copies of a Rembrandt angel around
the world via fax to mark the 320th anniversary of the master's
death.
   ``It's kind of a spiritual dimension of computer technology
combined with art,'' said Max Alexenberg, chairman of Pratt
Institute's fine arts department. ``These are Rembrandt images for
the TV generation.''
   Alexenberg on Wednesday dispatched the computer copy of the
350-year-old pen and ink drawing ``Angel Announcing the Birth of
Samson to Manoah'' from the AT&amp;T InfoQuest Center in New York _ the
city originally known as Nieuw Amsterdam _ to the Rembrandt House
in Amsterdam.
   The first of 24 sections of the enlarged image arrived instantly
at the Rembrandt House, where Alexenberg said he put a fax machine
on Rembrandt's etching press this summer.
   The Rembrandt House relayed the computer copy to The Israel
Museum in Jerusalem, chosen because Biblical pictures were
Rembrandt's major subject. From there, the drawing was sent to
schools and museums in Tokyo, Los Angeles and back to New York.
   Alexenberg said Rembrandt was something of a technology buff,
using the latest equipment and techniques then available.
   ``Rembrandt would have liked this,'' Alexenberg said.

   How much is $15 in 1977 dollars now
worth?
   State officials say $43.52. And they're trying to refund that
amount to the 10,333 people who had $15 tickets to two scheduled
Elvis Presley concerts that he never lived to perform.
   The fans can get refunds without giving up their cherished
ducats.
   ``I know there's a lot of sentimental value with these
tickets,'' said Susan P. Clayton, director of the state Division of
Unclaimed Property, which got about $450,000 in ticket proceeds and
interest two months ago.
   The concerts were to have been Aug. 27 and Aug. 28, 1977, at
Mid-South Coliseum. Presley died of heart disease Aug. 16.
   In a dispute involving Presley's estate, the coliseum and the
state, the state Court of Appeals ruled in December that the
ticketholders should get the refunds because Presley never
performed.
   To keep the tickets and get the refund, ticketholders must
appear with the tickets in person. If the tickets are mailed, the
division keeps them.
   ``We simply can't just let them get the refund and maybe pass
them along to someone else,'' Clayton said. ``We'll have to make a
definitive mark on the ticket.''

<HEAD>Photocopiers, Once Thought as Dangerous as Explosives, to Be Deregulated</HEAD>

   Soviets long considered photocopiers as dangerous
as guns or explosives, and police strictly regulated their use.
Now, authorities say modern word-processing technology makes their
job impossible and they want out.
   The Interior Ministry, responsible for police and law
enforcement, ``intends to relinquish control over the purchasing,
possession and functioning'' of duplicating and copying equipment,
the government daily Izvestia reported Wednesday night.
   ``With the help of computers, one can publish ... an entire
newspaper, and this in any number of copies,'' Izvestia quoted V.
Vashchenko, the Interior Ministry official in charge of policing
the use of copiers, as saying.
   ``It's impossible to control this process by any means. And
moreover, do we need to?''
   Vashchenko's remarks reflect the relaxed official attitude
toward access to technology that could reproduce literary or
political works hostile to state ideology, and toward freer
self-expression in general.
   Limiting citizens' abilities to broadcast their views has been a
Soviet obsession since the days of Lenin. As Izvestia noted, soon
after the Communists took power in 1917, even typewriters had to be
registered with authorities, and that requirement was only recently
lifted.
   In another sign of change under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
a proposed law on the press being considered by the legislature
outlaws state censorship and orders governmental bodies to answer
questions posed by reporters.
   Under current regulations, the purchasing, installation and use
of almost any duplicating equipment in the Soviet Union requires
the ministry's ``special permission,'' Izvestia said.
   Inside the ministry, about 1,000 inspectors police copiers and
duplicating equipment, the paper said. It wryly noted they work in
ministry division also responsible for ``questions of control over
storing firearms, poisons, explosives.''
   Those specialists, however, are not numerous enough to patrol
the 60,000 sites possessing copying equipment, so rank-and-file
policemen often have to keep unauthorized people from making
``Kseroks,'' as photocopies are called in Russian.
   Counters on the state-owned machines record how many copies are
made, and each use must be entered in a log. Nevertheless, Izvestia
said, police find and confiscate unauthorized copies of material
ranging from ``The ABCs of Sex'' to reading fortunes from coffee
grounds.
   Recently, commercial photocopy enterprises opened in Moscow as
part of joint economic ventures with Western firms, but what they
can duplicate for their Soviet customers is still limited by a
15-year-old government order.
   ``Under pretext of protecting copyrights, it sharply narrows the
circle of texts which are allowed to be duplicated,'' A.
Dvoyeglazov, acting director of the 6-month-old Reprocenter in
northern Moscow, was quoted by Izvestia as saying. ``But what
copyrights are, nobody in this country knows.''
   Dvoyeglazov spoke wistfully of the West, ``where anyone who
desires can drop in a coin and print anything.''
   Until that happens, copying something will remain a headache for
average Soviets, whether they are engineers who want to reproduce
an article from a technical journal, a student who needs to publish
his doctoral dissertion or a mother who wants to send a favorite
recipe to her daughter.
   Izvestia said the Interior Ministry was detailing how it
proposed to get out of the copier-monitoring business, but the
newspaper did not elaborate.
   Lack of access to photocopiers or other means of printing gave
rise to an entire school of Soviet literature _ ``samizdat,'' or
the self-published underground dissident writings of the 1970s and
early 1980s that gave Soviets information and views not then
reported in state-run media.
   On brittle, flimsy paper interlarded with carbons, activists
inscribed the works of Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Roy Medvedev, Andrei
Amalrik and other contemporaries in typewritten texts whose lines
were often so fuzzy and close together they made a reader's head
swim.
   Since Gorbachev became Soviet leader in 1985, many of those
works have been reprinted in official newspapers and magazines.

   The Bush administration said Wednesday it was
not asked and did not promise to aid in Tuesday's failed coup
against Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega but reserves the
right to use military force on its ``own timetable.''
   Amid sharp criticism from Congress that the United States should
have stepped in to help topple Noriega, officials said the
administration was in the dark Tuesday about what was happening in
Panama, with no details about the coup's chances of success. There
were suggestions, though, that a clear effort to restore democracy
might have brought U.S. help to the rebels.
   U.S. officials, asking not to be identified, said the rebels had
Noriega in custody for four to five hours but then let him go, an
account substantially confirmed by Noriega aides in Panama.
   ``It's crazy, I don't understand it,'' an official said when
asked why the insurgents decided to free Noriega.
   Bush was buffeted by words from Congress, where one senior
Republican said, ``We blew it,'' and a Democratic colleague spoke
scornfully of ``cold feet.''
   In the Senate, Jesse Helms, R-N.C., proposed an amendment to an
anti-drug bill to authorize Bush to use U.S. troops to forcefully
remove Noriega from power and bring him to trial in the United
States on the drug charges already pending against him. The move
was seen as symbolic, since Bush already has such powers.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, testifying before a
Senate committee, indicated the United States had kept its distance
Tuesday because the rebels had little possibility of removing
Noriega. Brushing aside criticism of the U.S. reaction, Baker said,
``It's easy to be an armchair general.''
   ``The United States retains the option to use American forces.
That option has never been ruled out,'' Baker told the Senate
Finance Committee. ``But if you're going to risk American lives,
it's the president's view that you do so on your own timetable. ...
You don't do so on the basis of someone else's plans and in
response to rapidly changing circumstances.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told reporters on Capitol Hill
that it was not clear at the time that Noriega was being held, but
the Bush administration now believes that was the case.
   ``Clearly they were not of the mind to turn him over to us,''
Cheney said.
   Cheney said, ``It was not a pro-democracy group that had taken
over the PDF. It was more of a power struggle within the PDF
itself.''
   Cheney said there was even some doubt whether the coup attempt
had been staged by Noriega.
   ``The individual who was reputed to be in charge of the coup was
a man who was a noted confidante of Mr. Noriega, and most people
looking at that set of facts, who the individual was who was
involved, would conclude that it was very possible that this was a
setup by Noriega,'' Cheney said in an interview with CBS News.
   In that same interview, Cheney also said the United States has
given refuge to the family of one of the individuals involved in
the coup attempt.
   Quoting an unidentified member of Congress who attended a
briefing by Cheney, The New York Times said in Thursday editions
that Cheney reported the U.S. military in Panama had given
sanctuary to several officers who took part in the uprising.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the United
States had been tipped off about a coup attempt during the weekend
by ``a third party'' and was in touch with ``relatively low-level''
members of the rebel force during the fighting.
   One administration official said the United States would have
been happy to step in with force if it had been requested.
   ``The (U.S.) people down there were under instructions to look
for an opportunity to be of help and it never showed up,'' said the
official, insisting on anonymity. ``As I understand, if they were
asked for assistance to support a pro-democracy movement they would
have done it.''
   Fitzwater said ``just about everything'' about the coup argued
against U.S. military involvement, especially lack of reliable
information.
   Asked if the United States might have helped the rebels if they
had agreed to turn over Noriega, Fitzwater said, ``I don't know. I
can just tell you the way it unfolded.''
   Fitzwater said the person who alerted the United States to the
planned coup ``told us with an idea of seeing how we would react to
it. And basically, our reaction was that we would protect property,
treaty rights and people, but that was it.''
   Baker and Fitzwater refused to confirm reports that the United
States had given refuge to coup leaders and their families in
Panama.
   Noriega blamed the uprising on the United States, saying, ``The
proof is that American troops closed access routes to the barracks,
just as they closed the Pan-American Highway.''
   Fitzwater said Wednesday, ``We did move forces in a position to
secure the causeway and the bridge of the Americas as a means of
protecting U.S. citizens who were on the base. Those are the major
access routes to our base.''
   The U.S. Southern Command's headquarters is about one-half mile
from the main Panamanian Defense Forces barracks where the violent
coup attempt occurred.
   The failed attempt was a major setback for the United States'
long campaign to oust Noriega from power.
   The administration said there were two ways of interpreting the
results. One was that Noriega had strengthened his hand by
overcoming the coup. Another reading was that it had demonstrated
opposition to Noriega's leadershipas well as divisions within
Panama's military forces.
   Embracing the second interpretation, Fitzwater said, ``That may
be a good omen for the long term.''
   Few in Congress were putting it that way.
   ``It's a major setback for our foreign policy,'' said Rep.
William Broomfield of Michigan, senior Republican on the House
Foreign Relations Committee. ``It raises questions whether people
down there can ever have confidence in the United States.''
   Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., likened the situation to the failed
attempt by exiled Cubans to invade at the Bay of Pigs in 1961, when
U.S. support evaporated at the crucial moment.
   ``We had full knowledge they were going to do this. I'm afraid
it's a matter of cold feet,'' Skelton said. ``It was a conscious
decision (by Bush) not to assist... I'm furious about it.'' He said
he had gotten his information about a White House decision from a
senior Pentagon official.
   There were some dissenting voices.
   ``The president was absolutely correct,'' said Rep. Joseph
McDade, R-Pa. ``We're not an invading force. We'd like to see
General Noriega out, but I support the president in what he did.''
   Andrew H. Card Jr., a senior adviser to Bush and deputy to White
House chief of staff John Sununu, told reporters the White House
position was that Panama's military forces should do everything
they could against Noriega before there was any outside
intervention.
   ``We were not invited to participate,'' Card said. ``We did not
offer to participate.''

<HEAD>Soviet Agency Asks To Station Crime-Fighting Officer In Netherlands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eager to present a changing face
as a crimefighting force, the KGB has asked to station an officer
at the Soviet Embassy in the Netherlands, a Dutch police official
says.
   The Soviet ``police attache'' would be the first such official
in any Soviet diplomatic mission in the Western world, said John de
Blaey, a senior Hague police administrator.
   De Blaey has just returned from a week-long trip to Moscow,
where he said the request was made to him by KGB chief Vladimir A.
Kryuchkov.
   Officially known as the State Security Committee, the KGB is
believed to be the world's most extensive secret police force and
espionage organization.
   Dutch officials have warned that Moscow is stepping up its
espionage efforts, especially in the area of high technology,
although expulsions of Soviet citizens from the Netherlands have
been extremely rare in recent years.
   The new KGB officer would be a crime-fighter concentrating on
exchanging information with Dutch police on issues like extortion,
fraud and drug smuggling, De Blaey told The Associated Press on
Wednesday.
   He would be ``a KGB figure in the new style and act in public as
a KGB officer,'' said De Blaey.
   Kruychkov and Moscow police chief P.S. Bogdanov said they could
use such a liaison officer abroad because their nation is not a
member of Interpol, the world's biggest international police
information network, De Blaey said.
   The Interior Ministry, which would have to approve the request,
could not immediately be reached for comment.
   ``Mr. Kryuchkov said that the KGB is developing into a kind of
FBI in addition to its traditional intelligence-gathering task,''
De Blaey said.

   There's a lot of strange stuff happening
out there _ tales of poltergeists, swamp monsters, maybe even
dinosaurs still crashing through African jungles _ and Mark
Chorvinsky has opened a ``strange hotline'' to hear all about it.
   ``The world is a pretty strange place,'' says Chorvinsky, 35, a
black-clad archivist of the bizarre and investigator of the weird
who lives on a quiet, tree-shaded street in this Washington suburb.
   ``Everybody knows of something strange that has happened to
them, but they never talk about it,'' he says. ``The only time it's
safe to talk, it seems, is around a campfire or during Halloween.''
   Now they can dial the ``strange hotline'' at 1-900-820-8361 to
share a scary encounter with the unknown, or hear a tape of
Chorvinsky describing some of his favorites. Among them are the
Lizard Man of South Carolina, the horrific winged Jersey Devil, the
Manila vampire and a haunted stretch of rural Maryland highway
where ``the dreaded Snarly Yow'' has been spotted by motorists.
   Chorvinsky, in fact, recently listened to ``one of the most
amazing stories I've ever heard'' from a taped message left by an
anonymous hotline caller.
   It was the tale of an Arizona woman who bought a giant cactus as
a house plant. A few days later, she was alarmed to see the cactus
moving its prickly arms. She fled the house with her children just
before the cactus exploded, releasing swarms of scorpions in her
living room.
   That's the sort of thing that sends agreeable tingles down
Chorvinsky's spine and fills the pages of Strange Magazine, a
twice-a-year compendium of weird happenings that Chorvinsky founded
and edits for an estimated 4,000 avid readers.
   He's also a professional magician who performed at the White
House last year, an author who is planning a biography of Merlin
the magician and a filmmaker whose movie short, ``Strange
Tangents,'' was screened at the American Film Institute, the
Library of Congress and film festivals at Cannes, Berlin and Los
Angeles.
   ``It's about a young sorceress who tries to save her dying
master with the help of her friend, a 3-foot-tall talking
salamander,'' Chorvinsky says.
   To help pay the bills, he operates a science fiction and magic
shop in a Rockville shopping mall where customers can satisfy their
appetites for strange schlock. The shelves are stuffed with dragons
and wizards, crystal balls, Ninja swords, Tarot cards, horror movie
classics and fantasy games titled ``Skulls and Scrapfaggot Green''
and _ for laughs _ ``Batwinged Bimbos from Hell.''
   Although his bushy hair, beard, mustache and suit _ all in black
_ give him a slightly fiendish look, Chorvinsky is nobody's wacko.
He's a good-natured skeptic who directs a global network of
tipsters and investigators who track down reports of strange
phenomena for scholarly discussion in his magazine.
   ``I neither believe nor disbelieve this stuff,'' he said in an
interview. ``We have many skeptics who read the magazine, including
myself. I am skeptical but open-minded. I doubt everything but I
accept the possibility of anything.''
   He's never seen a UFO landing in a corn field, but knows that
``the damnedest things fall from the sky,'' including frogs, fish,
sugar crystals, ice chunks and vast cobwebs spun by airborne
spiders.
   Mysterious sea serpents like the Loch Ness monster may be the
stuff of ancient folklore, he said, or they may have existed all
along as monstrous species of marine life that somehow eluded
discovery by scientists.
   But what about the strange booms and bangs in the night? The
bizarre mirages of entire cities in the sky? The spinning wheels of
light beneath the oceans? Toads encased in rock but still alive?
   ``The stories that really intrigue me are those that give me the
greatest feeling of disquieting strangeness,'' Chorvinsky said.
``The tales so strange they couldn't possibly be explained, the
kind that give you a chill down your spine or make your hair stand
on end. The sort of thing that makes you say, `Ooooh, that's
weird'!''

   It's the Senate's turn to decide whether to
resist or yield to the wrath of millions of retirees angry at being
forced to pay for expanded Medicare benefits for catastrophic
health care.
   If the tally itself was any indication, the House barely thought
twice Wednesday before voting to repeal the year-old catastrophic
health insurance program.
   ``The American people have spoken. The House of Representatives
has listened,'' Sen. William Roth, R-Del., observed from across the
Capitol.
   The House members hardly needed to debate. A deluge of cards and
letters had sealed the program's fate before the battle was joined
on the floor.
   The 360-66 knockout punch was a remarkable reversal for
legislation that was hailed upon passage just over a year ago as
landmark legislation _ the most significant expansion of Medicare
in the Great Society program's two decades of life.
   However, a feature that may have contributed to the uproar over
the program was the fact that it called for collection of money
from senior citizens to pay for the expanded benefits before they
took effect.
   The Senate is poised to grapple with the issue as part of a
giant budget-cutting reconciliation measure. Likewise, the House
vote was on an amendment to its version of the budget bill.
   Final resolution of the catastrophic health plan _ along with
other budget issues such as child care and capital gains taxes _
will hinge on a House-Senate conference committee and then a final
vote in both houses.
   Lawmakers talked Wednesday of ratios such as 2,000-to-1 and
3,000-to-1 among their constituents in favor of repealing the
catastrophic care plan.
   Much of the protest was from well-to-do seniors facing an income
tax surtax of up to $800 to help cover the cost of providing the
new benefits to poorer elderly people _ some 20 million of whom
were asked to pay only $48 this year.
   Congress has heard hardly at all from the poorer senior
citizens, but House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski warned
his colleagues during the floor debate that the situation was
destined to change.
   ``Five million senior citizens may be complaining about the
supplemental premium and you may quench their thirst for repeal
today,'' he said. ``But in the process, make no mistake about it:
You will be hurting many more millions of senior citizens whose
voices have not been heard.
   ``Mark my words, my friends, their voices will be heard in this
chamber in the very near future.''
   The House also voted 269-156 on Wednesday against a plan that
would restore a small part of the program.
   Although the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act grew more costly
as it rolled through Congress with overwhelming support last year,
the main impetus came from President Reagan, who appealed in his
last State of the Union speech for a plan to shield elderly and
disabled Medicare beneficiaries from the financial ruin of major
illness.
   As enacted, it would pay for unlimited hospitalization after a
once-a-year deductible of $560 in 1989. Previously, Medicare
charged a deductible for each hospital stay during a year and
provided full payment of hospital bills only up to 59 days a year.
   The plan also would cap, starting Jan. 1, the amount that
beneficiaries must pay for physician services and, beginning Jan.
1, 1991, would phase in a new prescription drug benefit.

   President Bush's decision not to authorize
military force for a coup attempt against Panamanian ruler Manuel
Antonio Noriega was made amid fears the uprising might be ``a
setup'' by his loyalists and frustrations that U.S. troops were not
asked to help, officials say.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said leaders of the
failed coup did not seek assistance from the United States and that
none was offered.
   ``We have traditionally stopped short of this kind of military
involvement and it was a decision to do that again in this case,''
he said Wednesday.
   However, amid sharp criticism from Congress about Bush's refusal
to act, one administration official said the United States would
have been happy to intervene if the coup leaders had requested it.
   ``The (U.S. military) people down there were under instructions
to look for an opportunity to be of help and it never showed up,''
said the official, insisting on anonymity. ``Not only that, it was
rejected.
   ``As I understand it, if they were asked for assistance to
support a pro-democracy movement, they would have done it,'' the
official said. ``You can't just march in on your own. That's what
has gotten America a bad name for 100 years in Latin America.''
   The official noted that U.S. forces took up positions on a key
highway and a bridge, posing an obstacle for reinforcements for
Noriega's loyalists. ``It wasn't that we were just sitting on our
(rump),'' the official said.
   While Bush has repeatedly urged the Panama Defense Forces (PDF)
to depose Noriega, Fitzwater said, ``We have never said or
expressed any opinion in terms of direct involvement with a coup or
anything like that.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney raised doubts about the
authenticity of the uprising, particularly in light of the fact
that the coup's leader, Maj. Moises Giraldi Vega, was a close
confidant of Noriega and had helped quash a 1988 rebellion.
   ``This might well have been a setup,'' Cheney told reporters
just before briefing lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
   He did not elaborate on that point although another
administration official said ``we didn't know what his (Giraldi's)
motivation was.'' The official, who declined to be identified, said
Giraldi's past allegiance ``caused people to say, `Can we be sure
this guy's legit?'''
   As the coup unfolded Tuesday, Cheney met at the White House with
Bush and other national security officials. A Pentagon official
said various military options were discussed with the president.
   Another official said, ``When it appeared Noriega might have
been dethroned ... there were several options considered, none of
which was going in and getting him.''
   Fitzwater said that ``just about everything'' about the coup
argued against U.S. military involvement, especially lack of
reliable information.
   He said the United States had been tipped off about the coup
attempt during the weekend by ``a third party.'' Cheney said that
in view of Giraldi's association with Noriega, it was ``not at all
clear this was even a valid report.''
   U.S. officials said they were astonished to learn that the
rebels had Noriega in custody for several hours Tuesday but then
released him. One official said American officials told the coup
leaders that the United States would be happy to take custody of
Noriega and have him stand trial on drug trafficking charges.
   However, the coup leaders said they wanted, instead, to make
Noriega retire.
   Cheney said, ``Clearly they were not of the mind to turn him
over to us,'' adding that the rebels' intent had not been to expel
or extradite Noriega, he said.
   ``It was not a pro-democracy group that had taken over the PDF.
It was more of a power struggle within the PDF itself,'' he said.

<HEAD>Is There Life After Death for Robin the Boy Wonder?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Holy resurrection, Batman! Robin may live after
all!
   The Boy Wonder of comics, killed off last year after Batman
readers voted for his demise in a telephone poll, is about to make
a return, a comic book dealer says.
   Gary Colabuono, owner of Moondog's Inc., a chain of comic book
stores in Chicago's northwest suburbs, says sources at DC Comics
Inc. have told him a new five-part Batman series will culminate
next month with the introduction of a new Robin.
   DC's order form sent to retailers for issue No. 442, due out in
early November, offers some hints, Colabuono said. It says Batman
and ``a mysterious youngster'' will meet the villain Two Face in an
issue that will mark ``the introduction of a major new character
into the Batman mythos.''
   Peggy May, marketing manager for New York-based DC, would
neither confirm nor deny reports of Robin's return. ``We really
don't have any comment at this time,'' she said in a telephone
interview Wednesday.
   Colabuono says sources at DC indicated that Robin owes his
revival to some corporate decisions at Time Warner Inc., which owns
DC Comics and Warner Bros. studio.
   The studio produced the blockbuster movie ``Batman,'' which is
expected to generate in excess of $1 billion in revenues when all
ancillary marketing and merchandising rights are counted. And
that's without Robin products, since the Boy Wonder wasn't in the
movie.
   Production is tentatively set to begin on a ``Batman'' sequel
next year that could feature Robin.
   ``Disney wouldn't kill off Goofy,'' Colabuono said. ``As a
businessman, I think it was a dumb thing to do to kill off Robin.''
   The original Robin _ who was known as Dick Grayson when he
wasn't wearing his mask _ grew up and became the superhero
Nightwing in DC's The New Titans comics.
   In the mid-1980s, he was replaced by another Robin, who in
street clothing was a streetwise punk known as Jason Todd. That
character was killed in an explosion triggered by arch-enemy The
Joker in an issue released last November.
   The latest issues of Titans and Batman deal with Batman's guilt
and depression over the death.
   The four issues of the series in which Robin died now fetch
anywhere from $10 to $50 a copy in mint condition, compared with a
cover price of 75 cents, Colabuono said.
   But the 38-year-old dealer, who's been a Batman buff since he
first started reading comics at age 7, says many fans shed no tears
for the punk Robin and look forward to a back-to-the-roots version
of the Boy Wonder.
   ``He doesn't have to be a sniveling little teen-ager like the
last one,'' Colabuono said. ``I think it's wonderful _ there's
always a place for Robin in the comic book world.''

   Space shuttle Atlantis will be
launched Oct. 12 with a nuclear-powered planetary spacecraft, NASA
said after replacing a bad computer in a rocket.
   The rocket is to boost Galileo toward Jupiter after the probe is
released in orbit by Atlantis' astronauts.
   After checking out the new computer, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration said Wednesday there was no need to delay
the launch. Oct. 12 has been the unofficial date for months.
   The countdown is scheduled to start at 8 a.m. Monday, a day
before a federal judge is to hear arguments on a lawsuit by
anti-nuclear activists trying to block the launch.
   The opponents say a launch accident could spread poisonous
plutonium over heavily-populated areas of Florida. NASA says the
chances of that happening are less than 1 in 2,500.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Ready to Give More Aid to Poland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, citing ``dramatic
changes in Poland,'' says it's ready to cut a deal with Congress
over the size of a U.S. aid package for the new Solidarity-led
government.
   ``The numbers are all negotiable,'' presidential press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday after announcing a White House plan
to give Poland an additional $200 million to help restructure its
ailing economy.
   The White House package _ in addition to $219 million in aid
previously announced by President Bush _ came a day after
Democratic congressional leaders proposed a three-year $3.7 billion
package of loans, grants and other incentives.
   ``We may have a debate over the amounts, but essentially, we all
want to achieve the same purpose. We're willing to negotiate with
Congress on the amounts and the nature of the package,'' Fitzwater
said.
   ``The dramatic changes in Poland over the past two months have
lent new urgency to our efforts.''
   The White House also announced that Bush had invited both
Poland's new prime minister, Solidarity member Tadesz Mazowiecki,
and communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski to come to Washington
at dates yet to be determined.
   Democrats had invited Solidarity leader Lech Walesa to address a
joint meeting of Congress on Nov. 15. Fitzwater said Bush would
also invite Walesa to the White House during the expected visit.
   Wednesday's White House announcement of the new aid proposal
follows agreement by the 12-nation European Community to back a
$650 million aid package for Poland and Hungary.
   Fitzwater said the U.S. grant would complement the European
package and serve as the U.S. installment toward a proposed $1
billion ``stabilization'' fund to help Poland move toward a
free-market economy.
   ``Since this money will be a grant, it will not add to the
long-term indebtedness of the already heavily burdened Polish
people,'' he said.

<HEAD>`The Aunts,' A New Play, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs planned.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Family troubles usually make for soap opera, not
good plays.
   A case in point is ``The Aunts,'' Gary Bonasorte's dreary
domestic drama that opened Wednesday at off-Broadway's 47th Street
Theater with three accomplished actresses _ Mia Dillon, Bethel
Leslie and Ann Wedgeworth _ in the leading roles.
   Miss Leslie and Miss Wedegeworth play the aunts; Miss Dillon is
their niece, and the three women make a game effort to commandeer
the stage. But Bonasorte doesn't give them much help. The play
revolves around Nan (Miss Wedgeworth) whose husband Don is offstage
dying of cancer. Her sister Meg and niece Pita arrive to lend
support. They should have stayed home for all the comfort they
provide.
   The plot is mostly dramatic revelation, much of it not very
surprising or even interesting. Nan wants to ease her husband's
pain by feeding him brownies laced with marijuana. Meg attempts to
supply Don with pills so he can kill himself when the suffering
becomes unbearable. And Pita just wants to get married.
   Much of the banter revolves around Pita. She is a 30-year-old
cashier, stuck in a dead-end relationship with her much older
boyfriend. She arrives wearing a maternity dress, a fact no one but
the audience seems to notice for the first scene or two.
   The play is set in a blue-collar Pittsburgh neighborhood during
the late 1970s but there's not much sense of place or time except
for a few references to the Steelers and Terry Bradshaw.
   The play ends with a catharsis of sorts, giving Miss Wedgeworth
an oportunity to emote with an capital E. Miss Leslie comes off
best, and in her portrait of a bitter, unhappy woman trapped in a
terrible marriage, there is glimmer of what Bonasorte's play might
have been.

   Archaeologists of camp humor might want to get themselves down
to Sheridan Square in Greenwich Village for a look at ``Big
Hotel,'' a revival by the Ridiculous Theatrical Company of Charles
Ludlam's first play. But those seeking a satisfying night at the
theater will have to dig elsewhere.
   The play, written in 1967, is a fractured takeoff of, among
other things, the movies ``Grand Hotel'' and ``Sunset Boulevard.''
Ludlam, who died two years ago, had a wicked sense of the
outrageous. In ``Big Hotel,'' he's outrageous without being funny,
so tedium sets in early.
   The story which chronicles the activities of various residents
of the hotel evaporates minutes after the curtain goes up. In the
late '60s when ``Big Hotel'' was first done, anarchy flourished on
stage. Twenty years later, it seems boring and almost quaint.
   Everett Quinton, who now runs the company, plays a mournful
Norma Desmond who doesn't lack for theatricality. No other member
of the large cast approaches Quinton's inspired lunacy, although
the colorful and extravagant costumes by Susan Young capture
Quinton's wonderful sense of the bizarre. But they are meager
pleasures in what seems like a long, messy evening.

   The fall theater season never really begins in New York until
the Young Playwrights Festival opens off-Broadway at Playwrights
Horizons. An evening of one-act plays by young writers 18 and
under, it is among the most satisfying annual theater events in New
York.
   As usual, this year's collection of four plays varies in
quality, but the best of the lot turns out to be ``Twice Shy,'' by
18-year-old Debra Neff. It's a surprisingly tough but funny look at
a young woman's first serious relationship with a man.
   Their affair ends unhappily but not unrealistically, and the
girl _ played with appealing indecision by Katherine Hiler _
survives to laugh again. So does the audience which cheers on her
resilience.

   Members of the Senate Finance Committee are
not about to let something like the federal budget deficit get in
the way of the task they enjoy most: cutting taxes.
   After the lawmakers agreed Wednesday on the spending cuts and
revenue increases needed to cut the deficit by $5.3 billion, they
saw there were still tax dollars to spend and set to work on the
annual exercise that cynics compare to hogs slopping at the trough.
They started passing out tax benefits to special interests.
   Lower-income parents got a new package of child-care credits.
   Banana farmers got a piece of the pie.
   So did first-time homebuyers, owners of tuxedo-rental shops,
well-off retirees, oil producers, timber growers, selected
hospitals, the self-employed, parents who want to adopt handicapped
children and tavern owners.
   Americans who fit into the category of upper-middle-income _
better than $50,000 a year _ were guaranteed to be winners when
Republicans on the panel called for a cut in capital gains taxes
and Democrats recommended liberalized Individual Retirement
Accounts instead.
   IRAs won in the Finance Committee on a 10-10 tie, but
Republicans and a few dissident Democrats are working with the Bush
administration to reverse that vote on the Senate floor this
weekend.
   ``It's going to be a very tough fight, a close fight,'' Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the committee, said Wednesday.
   The battle over capital gains and IRAs is the focus of attention
in the deficit-reduction bill, but dozens of other parts _ added at
the insistence of one or more Finance Committee members _ are
likely to get little attention.
   While those issues will command the attention of the Senate,
many other parts of the big deficit-reduction bill will not even be
mentioned in public debate. That doesn't please some members.
   ``This bill as it has progressed has become increasingly more
troubling,'' Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., groused as the panel wound
up action on the legislation just before 2:30 a.m. Wednesday. ``We
end up raising $37 billion (in taxes over five years) to meet a
$5.3 billion'' deficit-reduction goal for fiscal 1990, he said.
   Here are some of the scores of provisions that were tacked onto
the bill by the committee:
   _New assistance to rural hospitals, many of which are
financially stressed because federal Medicare reimbursements favor
urban facilities.
   _Expanding the oil-depletion allowance for owners of wells that
produce less than 15 barrels a day. Producers whose natural gas is
in ``tight sand'' formations would get an additional incentive
totaling $685 million over five years.
   _Permitting banana and pineapple growers to use a more
advantageous system of accounting, a $25 million benefit.
   _A liberalized package of tax-related aid to lower-income
families with children, including a new credit for health insurance
and supplements for families with children under age 4.
   _Raising from $8,880 to $14,520 the annual amount a person age
65 through 69 may earn without losing a portion of Social Security
benefits. This would help fewer than 10 percent of beneficiaries _
those whose earnings exceed $8,800 _ at a cost of $1 billion a year.
   _Reducing from five years to two years the minimum time period
over which rental tuxedos may be depreciated, saving owners $29
million over five years.
   _Permitting deduction of certain costs of adopting hard-to-place
children.
   _Extending through 1991 expiring tax benefits for employer-paid
legal and education assistance and for health-insurance costs for
the self-employed, and making permanent credits to benefit
first-time homebuyers, corporations that increase research
spending, and investors in low-income rental housing.
   _Restoring the income-averaging benefit for farmers; they could
use losses from bad years to offset income taxes in good years.
   _Allowing timber growers to avoid a 1986 requirement that they
``materially participate'' in managing a timber crop before using
losses from such activity to offset taxes on other income.
   _Granting amnesty from 1985 backward to taverns that have failed
to pay an annual occupational tax.

   Leading AIDS activists say they're bewildered
by a government decision to exclude a pioneer in community-based
AIDS research from new federal funding.
   Community Research Initiative in New York was notified by
telephone this week that it would not be among the groups sharing
in $9 million from the government's first program to finance
community-based AIDS drug testing, said Dr. Bernie Bihari,
executive director of CRI.
   Bihari said Wednesday that he was not told why his group was
excluded.
   The awards were to be announced this afternoon.
   Word that CRI would not receive an award was met by surprise and
bewilderment by some in the AIDS research community.
   ``It's offensive and humiliating, and it creates an impression
of bad will, which we did not need,'' said Mathilde Krim, a founder
of the American Foundation for AIDS Research, which has given CRI
money in the past.
   ``This group conceptualized a new research institution not only
for AIDS but that can be used for other diseases as well,'' she
said. ``I felt they deserved a little support in recognition of
their contribution.''
   CRI two years ago pioneered the grass-roots concept in drug
testing that has helped move at least some clinical trials from the
large academic medical centers into communities where local
physicians and their AIDS patients participate in testing new AIDS
drugs.
   It was considered the model for many of nearly three dozen
community-based AIDS research groups that have begun testing AIDS
drugs.
   Some of these groups, and others that have not begun testing,
will share in the federal funding. About $9 million will be
available.
   Lawrence Deyton, assistant director for community research at
the National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the
proposals were ranked by a peer review committee that included
community nurses and doctors, people with AIDS and AIDS activists.
   Jean McGuire of the AIDS Action Council, who sat on the review
committee, said she could not talk about individual proposals but
said, ``I feel the process was rigorous and equitable.''
   She said her ``biggest disappointment'' was that there wasn't
enough money for more groups.
   ``CRI isn't the only deserving project that didn't get money.
It's an issue of too few resources,'' she said.

   John Steinbeck's ``Of Mice and Men,'' a
story about hired farm hands read by sophomore English students at
Watson Chapel High School for years, has been ordered dropped by
the administration.
   A memo from Principal Charles Daniel ordered teachers not to
assign the book and requested them to collect any copies they may
have passed out to students.
   Daniel would not comment Wednesday about the decision. Teachers
said profanity was cited for dropping the book.
   Two years ago, the book was classified as non-required reading
material at the urging of a small group of parents.
   Superintendent Charles Knight said the latest order didn't ban
the book. ``The teachers are allowed to make reference to it and
the students have access to it in the library,'' he said.
   An editorial in the school newspaper expressed outrage at the
order and said teachers should be able to teach any book.

   A knife-wielding man demanding to be
flown to the White House was subdued after scuffling with a pilot
in a charter jet's cockpit, authorities said.
   The pilot and the suspect, a 41-year-old Detroit man whose name
was not released, suffered minor cuts in Wednesday morning's
incident.
   The man walked into Kalitta Flying Services at the Willow Run
Airport near Ypsilanti and said he wanted to charter a flight to
Washington, said State Police Lt. Garry Kregelka.
   ``When they asked him how he would pay for the flight, he said
`credit card' and pulled out a 6-inch butcher knife,'' Kregelka
said.
   ``He said he wanted us to take him to the nearest airport to the
White House,'' said Pete Sanberlin, Kalitta's operations director.
   Kregelka said the company's owner, Conrad Kalitta, walked in and
offered to do whatever the man wanted.
   The man took Kalitta to the runway at knifepoint and they got
into a Lear jet, Kregelka said.
   He said the suspect took the co-pilot's seat while holding his
knife at Kalitta's ribs. Kalitta started the jet but delayed the
takeoff by talking to the control tower. Meantime, a state trooper
pulled his car in front of the plane, Kregelka said.
   The suspect and Kalitta then scuffled. The trooper and a charter
service worker subdued the suspect, Kregelka said.
   The man faces two counts of assault, one of kidnapping and one
of larceny.

   Actor Matt Dillon says he spent time with drug
addicts and bought a hypodermic needle on the street to prepare for
his role as a junkie in the movie ``Drugstore Cowboy.''
   ``All that research was definitely helpful,'' Dillon said.
   Dillon, 25, said he went with a friend, a recovering drug
addict, to a lower Manhattan park to buy ``works,'' an illicit drug
kit that included the needle.
   In the movie, which opens Friday, Dillon plays a junkie who robs
pharmacies to feed his drug habit.
   Observing addicts to learn their mannerisms, outlook and
motivation was natural for an actor who considers himself a student
of society.
   ``I don't live in exile. I'm not an absolute recluse,'' he said.
``I live my life. I like to go out. You have to keep in touch with
life around you. You have to observe things.''

   National GOP Chairman Lee Atwater is still
invited to the Memphis Blues Foundation's annual awards program,
but he won't be a co-host because the group doesn't want the show
to be politicized.
   ``We just want to remain apolitical and keep our focus on
music,'' David Simmons, a vice president of the foundation, said
Wednesday.
   Atwater, who plays guitar, and bluesman B.B. King had been
scheduled to be hosts of the Nov. 5 show at Memphis' Cook
Convention Center, but King will be touring overseas with the rock
group U2, Simmons said.
   Filling in for them will be Willie Dixon, a producer, arranger
and writer who set up one of the first tours of American blues
musicians to Europe in the 1960s. Awards will be given in 22
categories for contemporary and traditional blues.
   Bruce Iglauer, head of Alligator Records, said Atwater has
spoken about the need for preserving American blues but having him
as a host for the awards program would be improper.
   ``He's done some good things for the music, but he's a
politician,'' Iglauer said.

   Francis Ford Coppola will revive ``The
Godfather'' for a third act next month as he begins filming in
Italy with returning stars Al Pacino and Diane Keaton and newcomers
including Eli Wallach.
   ``We hope to do something in the tradition of the others,''
Coppola told Daily Variety in Wednesday's editions. ``If all three
were put together, we would like to feel they're all part of one
`Godfather' project.''
   Paramount's ``The Godfather _ The Continuing Story'' starts
filming in Rome on Nov. 15 from a script written by Coppola and
Mario Puzo, who first chronicled the Corleone saga in the
best-selling novel ``The Godfather.''
   Pacino, nominated twice for Academy Awards in the previous two
films, will return as the powerful underworld don Michael Corleone
and Keaton will play his ex-wife. Talia Shire, Coppola's sister,
will reprise her role as sister Connie Corleone.
   New faces include Wallach as a friend of the late Don Corleone
and Andy Garcia, who will portray an illegitimate Corleone son.
   The original ``Godfather'' was released in 1972; the sequel two
years later garnered 16 Oscar nominations. Each won the coveted
best picture Oscar. The two movies have grossed more than $700
million.

   A judge has reset the count for heavyweight
champion Mike Tyson, giving him two extra days to fulfill a
community-service sentence for a speeding conviction.
   Judge Stephen Safranko agreed Wednesday to let Tyson appear at
three youth clinics on Monday, two days after the deadline he had
set in sentencing the fighter. Tyson was ordered to appear at the
clinics and pay a $300 fine after pleading guilty to two speeding
incidents.
   ``It was a matter of substance over form,'' Safranko said,
explaining the extension. ``The idea is to get it done and have
something positive come out of it.''
   Under the revised agreement between Safranko and defense
attorney John Hicks, Tyson will be featured at a boxing clinic at a
youth center Monday morning, and then give two drug-related talks
at a community center.
   Tyson, who is training for a Nov. 18 title defense against Razor
Ruddock in Edmonton, Alberta, will face resentencing if he does not
perform at the clinics on Monday, Safranko said.

   Thousands of East German refugees in
Communist-owned trains that were locked up to bar compatriots from
joining the exodus arrived in Hof early Thursday after a
delay-plagued journey through Czechoslovakia and their homeland.
   Thousands of East Germans chanting ``We want out!'' had flocked
to train stations and lined tracks in their homeland in hopes of
joining their compatriots aboard what could be the last freedom
trains to the West.
   West German journalists said they heard unconfirmed reports of
serious injuries when East German authorities stopped some East
Germans from getting aboard the trains.
   Western diplomats in Prague, the Czechoslovak capital, had
speculated that attempts by East German authorities to prevent the
throngs from boarding the trains had caused the delays.
   East Germans seeking to board the trains jammed Western
embassies, swam rivers and lined railroad tracks in at least four
East bloc nations Wednesday.
   On Tuesday, East Germany's hard-line leaders had for the second
time in less than a week agreed to allow safe passage to the West
for thousands of would-be emigres who had massed at the West German
Embassy in Prague.
   The first of eight trains that had left Prague late Wednesday
arrived in this border town at 5:50 a.m. It was believed to be
carrying at least 1,000 people.
   East Berlin on Tuesday said it would allow one more exodus of
disillusioned citizens, then suspended visa-free travel to
Czechoslovakia, the only country to which East Germans could go
without first obtaining government permission.
   The agreement covered an estimated 11,000 weary refugees who had
converged on West Germany's embassy in the Czechoslovak capital,
but there were reports thousands of others throughout the East bloc
were hoping to take part.
   A crowd of Czechoslovaks applauded as the first group left the
embassy area to board buses to the train station. Helmeted riot
police arrived and pushed the onlookers back.
   As the first of 15 trains left Prague, the ecstatic passengers
cheered, waved and hurled their now-worthless East German money
from the windows.
   Earlier in the day, thousands of people in Dresden, East
Germany, were forced by truncheon-wielding police to leave the
train station.
   East Germany closed its border with ally Czechoslovakia in a bid
to end the embarrassing exodus of its young, skilled citizens
before the Communist nation celebrates its 40th anniversary this
weekend.
   ``We knew it was our last chance,'' one East German refugee said
about fleeing to Prague. ``We were right, now the border is
closed.''
   The clampdown on travel also was likely to severely curb the
number of East Germans going to reform-minded Hungary, which
spurred the exodus last month by allowing thousands of East Germans
to pass through. The shortest route to Hungary from East Germany is
through Czechoslovakia.
   West German border guards noted that only 500 arrived via
Hungary on Tuesday, compared to 700 the day before and 1,000 the
day before that.
   East Germans were frantically trying other avenues to reach West
Germany, where they are granted automatic citizenship.
   In East Berlin, police Wednesday scuffled with about 50 East
Germans trying to enter the U.S. Embassy, witnesses said. Eighteen
others made it inside the compound Tuesday but agreed late
Wednesday to leave the compound with assurances their government
will look favorable on their emigration requests, diplomats said.
   Police beat people with truncheons to disperse a defiant crowd
of 5,000 that packed a Dresden train station and lined the tracks,
chanting ``We want out!'' witnesses told The Associated Press.
   The trains traveled through East German territory via Dresden to
Hof. The detour through East Germany was requested by East Berlin
authorities so the refugees could be formally expelled from their
country. Czechoslovakia had vowed not to let East Germans emigrate
to the West across its borders.
   According to reliable East German sources, four East Germans
still were seeking asylum in the West German mission in East Berlin.
   There were also unconfirmed reports that four East Germans had
sought asylum in Bonn's embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria.
   In Warsaw, Poland, the number of East Germans seeking asylum at
the Bonn Embassy swelled to 400. About 130 arrived Wednesday. Many
_ their clothing still wet _ told of swimming rivers and evading
border police to get to the embassy.
   East Germany's state railroad provided the trains to transport
the 10,000 East Germans who had crowded the Prague embassy and
streets just outside it. The trains had been scheduled to leave
Tuesday night but were repeatedly delayed.
   West German officials first said technical difficulties appeared
to be the reason. However, later they said it could have been due
to the East Germans lining the tracks in their own country hoping
to join the exodus.
   ``That would be a plausible reason _ that some people perhaps
would have wanted to jump on the trains going by,'' West German
government spokesman Hans Klein told the ZDF television network.
   Police in Hof said about 1,000 young East Germans were waiting
along the tracks near Plauen, an East German town near the
Czechoslovak border.
   Hungarian and West German media reported thousands more had
crowded other spots along the route the trains were expected to
take.
   On Sunday, about 7,000 East Germans arrived in West Germany
after East Germany allowed thousands crowded in embassies in Prague
and Warsaw to leave. Many of those who arrived said they had jumped
on board as the trains passed through their homeland.

   The basic mandate of the 13,000 American
troops based in Panama is to protect American civilians and the
strategic Panama Canal.
   So when several hundred American combat-fatigued military men
took up positions around the Panamanian capital Tuesday, it was
ostensibly for those reasons.
   The move came as a small group of Panamanian troops tried to
overthrow dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Noriega loyalists, including Provisional President Francisco
Rodriguez, claim the show of military might was proof of U.S.
involvement in the failed coup. The Bush administration denies any
involvement in the coup attempt.
   The American mission is outlined in the 1977 Panama Canal
Treaties, which call for the United States to turn the
American-built waterway over to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, and to
maintain the neutrality of the sea-to-sea canal.
   The 10 military installations along the 50-mile-long swathe also
are to be given to Panama.
   Under the treaties, U.S. forces are allowed to patrol only their
own bases and areas under joint U.S.-Panamanian jurisdiction.
   Panama charges the United States with thousands of violations of
that order, and the United States claims that Panamanians have
illegally trespassed hundreds of times in the last year on
American-run military bases. Several of the incidents resulted in
exchanges of gunfire, according to military officials.
   The treaties also bar U.S. military from interfering in internal
Panamanian affairs.
   According to military rules outlined in an orientation booklet,
American soldiers are prohibited from wearing their uniforms
outside the base areas unless they are on official business, en
route from one military installation to another or traveling from
home to a base.
   There were about 10,800 U.S. military personnel in Panama early
this year, but President Bush augmented that number by 2,000 after
an outbreak of violence in May sparked by controversy over the
Panamanian elections.
   The troops in Panama come under the U.S. Southern Command,
responsible for all U.S. military activities in Central and South
America. The command is headquartered on a hillside at Quarry
Heights, just outside Panama City in the former Panama Canal Zone.
   Southcom, as it is called, is home for Army, Air Force, Navy and
Marine troops.
   A Southcom bulletin issued last year notes the military's job of
protecting the canal and 40,000 American citizens, but adds:
   ``Southcom also promotes mutual security, plus democratic,
social and economic development among the nations of the region
through combined planning, training, humanitarian assistance,
intelligence exchanges and nation building.`
   The Southern Command traces its origin to the arrival of the
Marines in Panama in 1903, days after Panama, with the
encouragement of Washington, declared its independence from
Colombia. Army troops arrived in 1911, three years before the canal
opened.
   U.S. military strength hit a high of 67,000 during World War II.
   In recent years, Southcom has been the coordination point for
intelligence flights over Central America and an anti-drug drive in
Bolivia.

   President Bush, who stopped by to pay tribute
to an educational program initiated by the families of the
Challenger astronauts, is getting some praise himself for the help
he and Barbara Bush gave the program.
   ``Because this couple led the way, others followed,'' June
Scobee-Rodgers, widow of Challenger commander Dick Scobee, told a
Wednesday evening fund-raiser for the Challenger Center for Space
Science Education.
   ``They led not only in word but in deed,'' she said, telling the
black-tie audience that the Bushes opened their homes for
receptions and made introductions that ``literally opened the door
to launch the Challenger center.''
   Mrs. Rodgers said Bush gave his personal commitment ``not only
in time, but financially.''
   The Challenger Center, founded by families and friends of the
seven astronauts who died in the January 1986 shuttle explosion, is
meant to inspire teachers and students in math, science and
technology. It holds workshops, provides classroom materials and
operates learning centers in Houston and Greenbelt, Md. Other
centers are to open soon.
   The Bushes spent only a few minutes at the dinner, leaving after
the president made his brief remarks.
   Bush drew parallels between the Challenger Center's hands-on
science education programs and his goals for America's schools and
its space program.
   ``The mission of the Challenger Center is very close to our
hearts, and close to our vision of an America that gives its
children the best possible education for their challenging
future,'' Bush said.
   ``The mission of Challenger Center is to spark in our young
people an interest and a joy in science.''
   Bush said he hoped Congress would enact his proposed
``Educational Excellence Act,'' which calls for science
scholarships of up to $10,000 a year ``for over 500 of our best
high school seniors.''
   ``Like the 25,000 Americans who have contributed to the
Challenger Center, our science scholarship proposals represent an
investment ... not in technology, but in people,'' Bush said,
pledging ``our continuing support as you move forward with the
vision and the determination to carry out the Challenger mission.''
   The center also honored broadcast journalist Walter Cronkite and
astronaut Buzz Aldrin, the second man to set foot on the moon.

   ``Night Stalker'' Richard Ramirez sneered at
a jury's verdict that he die in the gas chamber for his 13 satanic
murders, muttering: ``Big deal. Death always went with the
territory. See you in Disneyland.''
   The black-clad killer, unrepentant to the end, made his comment
in an underground garage as he was taken back to jail moments after
a jury recommended the death penalty for his gruesome crimes.
   His Disneyland comment apparently referred to the plea for mercy
that had marked his attorney's closing argument.
   `Mr. Ramirez will die in prison,'' defense attorney Ray Clark
had argued, insisting that a life sentence was sufficient
punishment.
   ``Life imprisonment without possibility of parole means he will
never see Disneyland again,'' said the lawyer. ``He will never be
free again.''
   But the jury voted 19 times for death on each of the special
circumstances attached to his 13 murder convictions. Ramirez also
was convicted of 30 felonies including burglary and sex crimes.
Those felonies and the crime of multiple murders constituted
special circumstances warranting the death penalty.
   ``There's no punishment that could fit this crime,'' Judi
Arnold, whose parents Maxon and Lela Kneiding were butchered, said
tearfully after Wednesday's verdict.
   ``I have to live the rest of my life seeing my parents and what
Mr. Ramirez did to them.''
   Some jurors said their dreams were haunted by the grisly details
of the murders.
   ``I have nightmares all the time about the crimes,'' said juror
Cynthia Haden. ``I'll get over it. But I'll never be the same. I'll
never look at people the same way.''
   She and others said they were horrified when they learned that
victims' throats had been slashed and one woman's eyes had been
gouged out.
   The 29-year-old Ramirez, a drifter from El Paso, Texas, was
impassive as Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan read the word,
``death'' 19 times in announcing the jury recommendations.
   The slender, shaggy-haired Ramirez, wearing a black shirt and
black slacks but minus his usual dark glasses, rocked back and
forth in his chair and craned his neck to peer at spectators.
   Tynan will formally sentence Ramirez on Nov. 7. He has the
option of reducing the sentence to life without parole.
   ``He got what he deserved,'' said Deputy District Attorney P.
Philip Halpin who spent four years prosecuting Ramirez. He had
described the defendant as ``a miserable human being'' who killed
for self-gratification.
   Defense attorney Daniel Hernandez said he was saddened at the
verdict.
   ``I think all human beings are deserving of our sympathy and
should not have their lives taken in the streets, in the courts or
in the gas chamber,'' he said.
   At least two jurors felt sympathy for Ramirez, said the jury
foreman Felipe Rodriguez who disclosed there was an initial 10-2
split on the death penalty. But he said sympathy for the families
of victims was powerful enough to sway the holdouts.
   ``It was the heinousness, the brutality,'' which convinced them
to vote for death, said juror Alfredo Carrillo.
   The panelists, who spent a year serving on the trial, said they
were shaken by the unrelated slaying of a fellow juror during their
deliberations in the guilt phase of the trial but insisted it made
no difference in their decision.
   ``It was a loss, a definite loss,'' said Rodriguez. ``A lot of
us came to realize how life really is _ one day you're there and
one day you're not.''
   Juror Phyllis Singletary was found slain at her home Aug. 15.
Her live-in boyfriend committed suicide a day later and left a note
admitting he had killed her.
   Defense attorneys sought a mistrial, but Tynan appointed an
alternate juror and deliberations resumed. Defense lawyers said
Wednesday the slaying would become a key point of their appeal,
claiming jurors were too upset to reach a dispassionate verdict.
   On Sept. 20, the jury decided Ramirez was the ``Night Stalker''
killer who broke into homes through unlocked windows and doors in
the summer of 1985.
   Satanic symbols were left at some murder scenes and some victims
were forced to ``swear to Satan'' by the killer.
   At an early court hearing in the case, Ramirez held up his hand
inscribed with a pentagram, a symbol of devil worship, and said,
``Hail Satan.''
   After his conviction, he flashed a two-fingered ``devil sign''
to photographers and muttered a single word: ``Evil.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush's plan to spend an additional
$9 million to boost the political opposition in next year's
Nicaraguan elections is headed for the Senate after easily winning
House approval.
   The House voted 263-156 for the aid package late Wednesday in a
rare show of agreement on U.S. policy toward the Central American
country. The measure could come up in the Senate before the week is
out.
   ``We are not trying to buy an election, we are trying to even
things up,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., arguing for the measure
against assertions that it would again raise the specter of U.S.
paternalism in the region.
   ``This is ham-handed, and will backfire,'' countered Rep. David
Obey, D-Wis.
   Backers of the election aid package noted Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government and its incumbent president, Daniel Ortega,
will marshal civil servants, the police and military, and the
government-controlled media to help assure their continued power.
   By contrast the opposition coalition, known as UNO, operates out
of a shabby office with almost no equipment and doesn't even have a
fully working telephone, supporters argued.
   The package provides $9 million for a variety of
election-related activities deemed to be non-partisan, but which
Bush believes would help ``level the playing field'' for Violeta
Chamorro, the opposition presidential candidate.
   After years of congressional battling over U.S. policy toward
Nicaragua, the relatively easy approval of Bush's aid proposal
represented rare agreement among normally divided factions.
   That agreement was made possible after Secretary of State James
A. Baker III and other senior officials conveyed private assurances
to Congress that if the aid goes forward, the administration will
not use CIA contingency funds to secretly support the opposition.
   Of the total package, $8 million would flow through the National
Endowment for Democracy, a U.S. government-supported organization
that promotes free elections around the world.
   That money would go for voter registration, poll monitoring,
get-out-the-vote activities and political party building, and to
pay the 50 percent tax on foreign political contributions required
by Nicaraguan law.
   Another $1 million would be used to pay expenses of three
poll-watching groups. None of the money could be used for direct
campaign expenses, such as advertising.
   The money, which would come from unspent balances in other
accounts, comes on top of $3.5 million already made available in
the past year for the endowment to use in supporting the electoral
process in Nicaragua.
   Voting for president, the national assembly and local posts is
scheduled for Feb. 25.

   Although Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
has dodged another bullet, the arrests of three high-ranking
officers following a coup attempt shows the deep divisions in the
force that he depends on for survival.
   The general's victory bared weaknesses in his control of the
Defense Forces, the top authority in a country where civilian
governments have been a facade for military strongmen.
   On Wednesday, Col. Arnulfo Castrejon said Noriega had been taken
hostage by commanders of the headquarters guard shortly after he
walked into his office the day before.
   According to Castrejon, Noriega kept his captors calm and tried
to avoid bloodshed, ``confident the Defense Forces would solve the
problem.''
   Loyal units then moved from outlying bases, counterattacked and
forced the rebels to surrender.
   That was an impressive display of loyalty to a commander who was
out of position to command, and it first appeared that he had
quashed a coup launched by a few disgruntled junior officers.
   But when the list of those arrested was released Wednesday
night, it included 23 officers, a much wider group than previously
thought.
   Most surprising on the list were the names of Cols. Guillermo
Wong, Julio Ow Young and Armando Palacios Gondola. They were
members of the 20-man High Command that Noriega had packed with his
most trusted aides.
   Noriega now must restructure his top staff with the knowledge
that there are probably many other officers who are resentful,
envious, angry or ambitious even though they did not join the coup.
   ``He must know that he cannot trust anyone now,'' said Ricardo
Arias Calderon, leader of the Christian Demcratic Party and a
former vice presidential candidate.
   ``If I was in Gen. Noriega's shoes, I'd be a very nervous man
tonight,'' U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told reporters
Wednesday in Washington.
   Military infighting inspired the coup attempt, as the communique
released by rebels pointed out. They said their purpose was to
retire Noriega and other members of the general staff.
   But after emerging from his bullet-pocked headquarters, Noriega
could take pride in the loyalty of the bulk of his force even when
he was not in position to command them.
   He also saw that fully mobilized U.S. troops in combat gear
stood by as the coup was crushed, even though the Washinton has
been trying to oust Noriega for more than 1{ years.
   It was a clear sign to other potential plotters that the United
States would not lend even passive aid _ such as blocking all
access to Defense Forces Headquarters _ to a coup.
   For anyone unable to figure it out, U.S. Secretary of State
James A. Baker III made it perfectly clear.
   ``The United States retains the option to use American forces.
That option has never been ruled out,'' Baker told the Senate
Finance Committee. ``But if you're going to risk American lives,
it's the president's view that you do so on your own timetable. You
don't do so on the basis of someone else's plans and in response to
rapidly changing circumstances.''
   ``The gringos will act when it is to their own interest,'' said
a Panamanian oppositon source, ``not when it is in the interest of
the Panamanian opposition.''
   A third positive factor for the general was the passivity of the
civilian opposition, which Arias said had no contact with the
plotters.
   ``Their communique indicated they wanted Noriega out and
supported the provisional government that Noriega set up,'' Arias
said.
   A victory for the plotters would not likely have been a victory
for democracy.
   ``In this kind of confrontation if we went on the streets we
would be only providing the dead,'' Arias said.
   Noriega must have noted that another group of people beholden to
him stood aside until they saw which way the wind was blowing.
   The civilian government he appointed was silent during the early
hours of the attempt. On Wednesday, pro-government radio announcers
admitted some government employees had danced with joy as they
followed the first news bulletins.
   Perhaps the biggest plus for Noriega is simply that he survived.
He defeated a coup on March 16, 1988; he has outlasted U.S.
sanctions, election defeats, and now a much larger coup.
   ``He has more lives than a cat,'' an opposition source said.
``We just don't know how many he has used.''
   Who now will step forward and see?

<HEAD>Study: Minuscule Risk of AIDS from Blood Transfusions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The risk of AIDS infection from transfusions is
minuscule, but blood banks should work harder to recruit and retain
women donors because they're less likely to have the AIDS virus, a
Red Cross report concludes today.
   The research shows that blood from repeat female donors is nine
times safer than from first-time male donors.
   Currently, 42 percent of donors are women. The report said this
proportion should be increased, in part by encouraging members of
women's organizations to give blood and by telephone recruiting
campaigns aimed at women.
   ``Every effort should be made to recruit and retain female
donors,'' wrote Dr. Paul D. Cumming and colleagues from the
American Red Cross in Washington.
   However, an editorial published with the study in the New
England Journal of Medicine questioned this tactic.
   Dr. Jay E. Menitove of the Blood Bank of Southeastern Wisconsin
said trying to establish an exclusively female donor base is
impractical. ``Moreover,'' he wrote, ``in a society that advocates
color- and sex-blind principles, this approach is arguably
unacceptable.''
   While suggesting ways to make the nation's blood supply even
safer, the report found reassuring evidence that the chance of
getting an AIDS infection from a typical transfusion is remote. The
odds were just 1 in 28,000 two years ago, and the risk is dropping
by more than 30 percent a year, largely because fewer AIDS carriers
are donating.
   ``The blood supply is probably safer now than it has ever
been,'' the Red Cross team wrote.
   However, another report in the journal cautions that some people
at high risk of the disease still give blood despite appeals to
refrain, and blood banks should try harder to dissuade them from
donating.
   A third study showed that more than 95 percent of people who
receive AIDS-tainted transfusions become infected, and half of them
develop AIDS within seven years.
   Based on data from 17 million donations, the Red Cross
researchers estimated that 131 units of AIDS-contaminated blood
were transfused throughout the United States despite screening
efforts in 1987. This probably fell to 87 in 1988.
   Many of those who get tainted blood die of other causes before
their infections becomes apparent. Only 14 clear cases of
transfusion-associated AIDS have been reported to the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control since widespread blood screening began in 1985.
   In another study, Dr. Susan F. Leitman and others from the
National Institutes of Health reviewed blood donations to the NIH
and Red Cross in Washington between 1985 and 1988. From this group,
they studied 156 people who gave AIDS-tainted blood.
   Most of these people had injected drugs or engaged in homosexual
practices, putting them at high risk of AIDS. When questioned about
why they donated, 26 percent said they had changed their lifestyles
and did not believe their earlier habits had left them at risk.
   Another 26 percent knew their blood would be tested for AIDS and
wanted to find out whether they were infected. Fifteen percent said
they felt pressured to donate. Only 6 percent said they did not
read or understand brochures that should have alerted them not to
donate.
   Thirty-three of the donors had gotten the virus through
heterosexual contact. None of them knew they were at risk for the
infection.
   ``Clearly, both donor education policies and interview
strategies need to be strengthened,'' the NIH researchers concluded.
   In the third study, Dr. John W. Ward and others from the CDC
studied 694 blood recipients whose donors later turned out to be
infected. They found that while almost all the recipients got the
infection, the risk of going on to get AIDS appeared to be highest
if the donor developed AIDS shortly after making the donation.

<TEXT>
   Hu Blonk, a long-time crusader for open
government, urged editors to use their newspapers as a crowbar in a
``way to prevent encroachment on the people's right to know.''
   Blonk was honored Wednesday as the first recipient of the
Meritorious Service Award of the Associated Press Managing Editors.
   He had served on the APME's Freedom of Information Committee for
25 years, played a major role in the passage of the Freedom of
Information Act and fought attempts by trial lawyers to restrict
courtroom coverage.
   For those efforts he earlier was honored by fellow Washington
state editors with a chrome-plated crowbar ``to pry open the doors
behind which, no doubt, skullduggery is taking place.''
   Blonk, 80, who retired as managing editor of the Wenatchee
(Wash.) World in 1974, said it was his ``Dutch stubbornness'' that
led him to fight to keep government proceedings open to reporters.
   He has been involved in defending the public's right to know
since he was a senior at the University of Washington in Seattle in
1933, when he led students in defying a Board of Regent's
restriction by inviting a labor advocate to speak on campus. He was
among students suspended over the incident, but the resulting
outcry led to reinstatement and adoption by regents of a resolution
guaranteeing free speech on the campus.
   ``The public thinks we probe too much, but can you imagine this
country without someone watching the public officials?'' he once
asked.

<HEAD>Plan to Legislate Efficient Toilets Not Going Down Well With Plumbers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Wyche Fowler's plan to save water by
legislating more efficient toilets isn't going down well with
plumbers and toilet makers, who contend the public is more
concerned with toilet performance than water consumption.
   ``Conservation efforts will ultimately fail if proper regard is
not given to the reasonable public demand for sound performance
standards in water supply and waste disposal,'' said George Bliss,
assistant director of training for the United Association of
Plumbers and Pipefitters.
   Bliss testified Wednesday at a hearing before the Senate
Commerce consumer subcommittee on legislation introduced by Fowler,
D-Ga., and Rep. Chet Atkins, D-Mass., to set national water
efficiency standards for toilets and other plumbing fixtures.
   The legislation would require that all new toilets installed
beginning in 1992 use only 1.6 gallons of water per flush. State
and local building codes generally have required a 3.5 gallon
standard since the early 1970s.
   ``When the amount of water is cut in half, there is reason to
doubt whether the system will operate properly,'' Bliss said,
arguing Congress should not act until more research is done on such
issues as ``to what extent will bowl staining become a factor due
to low flush.''
   Fowler said concerns such as those raised by Bliss are nothing
more than ``red herrings.'' He said toilets that meet the 1.6
gallon per flush standard, as well as other efficient plumbing
fixtures, already exist and ``are proven to work.''
   Supporters of the legislation told the Senate panel that in the
past year, seven states with 40 percent of the nation's population
have adopted standards requiring that new toilets use only 1.6
gallons per flush.
   ``There is no evidence to support the claim that there would be
a problem transporting solid waste down drain lines with low flush
toilets,'' said Amy Vickers, a water resources consultant from
Boston who became known as the ``commode queen'' last year during
her efforts to have the 1.6 gallon per flush standard adopted in
Massachusetts.
   Fowler said the bill would help reduce the strain on the
nation's water supplies by putting ``a stop to the massive waste of
water in faucets, water closets, showerheads.'' He said replacing
all such fixtures in American homes with more efficient models
would save almost 7 billion gallons of water a day.
   Craig Selover, a vice president of the Delta Faucet Co., said
the Plumbing Manufacturers Institute opposes the legislation
because it would ``create a needless federal bureaucracy, wasting
taxpayers' money'' and do little to promote water conservation.
   ``The legislation would, quite probably, create a negative
attitude toward water conservation among consumers, thereby
hampering important and much needed efforts to conserve precious
potable water resources,'' he said.

<HEAD>Skinner Testifies on Airline Buyouts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner says
he has reservations about proposed laws that would set the terms
for leveraged takeovers of domestic airlines.
   Skinner, whose intervention forced a change in the takeover
terms for Northwest Airlines, told House and Senate panels that
laws governing leveraged buyouts in the airline industry could
create more opportunity for loopholes.
   ``I agree that the industry, the investment community, the
airlines all have the right to know what the department's policy
is,'' Skinner said Wednesday.
   ``But we've got to make sure in doing that that we don't create
a policy that now the lawyers and investment bankers and everybody
can get around,'' said Skinner, a lawyer with buyout experience.
   Under an agreement announced last week, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines
said it would reduce its equity interest in the Northwest takeover
from 57 percent to 25 percent, limit the powers of the KLM member
on the Northwest board and drop plans for a three-member advisory
committee the Dutch airline would have controlled.
   The agreement also requires regular reports on Northwest's
finances in light of the fourfold increase in debt _ to $3.1
million _ that would be incurred in the takeover.
   ``The pressure to pay down the principal and to meet interest
payments could threaten the carrier's ability to meet its other
obligations, including fleet replacement, aircraft repair and
maintenance, security, crew training and other safety related
expenses,'' Skinner said in testimony submitted to aviation
subcommittees of both chambers.
   Skinner said KLM had too large a role even though only 5 percent
of the stock would have been voting shares. The Federal Aviation
Act sets a 25 percent limit on foreign ownership, and says the
airline must be controlled by U.S. citizens.
   The takeover is being engineered by Wings Holdings Inc., led by
California investor Alfred Checchi.
   The $705 million leveraged buyout, announced in June, was the
first of that magnitude in the airline industry, Skinner said.
KLM's share was to have been $400 million.
   Other buyout deals are pending, giving rise to congressional
concern. Laws have been introduced to set financial requirements
for airlines being bought out and to regulate foreign investment.
   Skinner said he hadn't reviewed the proposed laws and couldn't
say whether he supported or opposed them.
   However, he made it clear that he supported deregulation, had no
disagreement with the use of foreign capital, which is cheaper, or
with ``recapitalizations'' that make sure shares reflect the true
values of assets.
   Skinner also was reluctant to involve the Transportation
Department in the consequences of takeovers on employees, although
he has agreed to investigate the issue at the urging of airline
unions.

   The Senate Finance Committee wants to forgive
$2 million a year in past-due taxes and penalties owed by fraternal
groups, taverns and other small businesses on a federal liquor levy
on the books since 1866.
   The panel approved the amnesty amendment early Wednesday,
including it in a sweeping budget bill sent to the Senate floor.
Both the amendment and the bill passed on voice votes.
   Protests over the tax grew after a Pennsylvania Elks lodge got a
$9,776 bill last year for 49 years of non-payment.
   The amendment sponsored by Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., would
prohibit the government from collecting unpaid balances and
penalties on the tax if they accrued before Jan. 1, 1985.
   Jack Killorin of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said the list of
retailers liable for the tax includes some country clubs, lodges,
limousine operators and even bait and tackle shops _ any
organization that sells beer, wine and distilled spirits directly
to the public. Killorin estimates 600,000 organizations must pay
the tax.

<NOTE>Appeals Court Refuses to Block Extradition of Alabama Juvenile</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old boy facing a possible death
sentence in Alabama for a firebombing that killed a toddler can't
use the District of Columbia's ban on capital punishment to avoid
extradition, according to an appeals court ruling.
   The District of Columbia Court of Appeals on Wednesday upheld a
Superior Court ruling that the extradition of the juvenile,
identified only as O.M., would not violate the district's
prohibition against the death penalty.
   ``We do not execute human beings in Washington, D.C.,'' Judge
Frank E. Schwelb wrote. ``But it is not up to the District of
Columbia to determine what constitutionally permissible penalty
Alabama may impose for a crime committed within its borders.''
   O.M. has been fighting extradition since his December arrest on
a warrant issued by Gadsden, Ala., authorities, charging him with
arson and murder in the death of 14-month-old Tamel Jackson, who
died when a firebomb was hurled into an apartment.

   A sailor who worked in food service aboard the
aircraft carrier USS Midway has been sentenced to 35 years for
trying to pass classified material to a Soviet agent.
   Airman Recruit James R. Wilmoth, 21, of Omaha, Neb., also was
convicted of possession and distribution of hashish, Navy spokesman
Lt. Greg Smith said Wednesday.
   Wilmoth did not have a security clearance, and the Navy is
giving no details of the classified material he obtained or how he
got it, Smith said.
   Smith also would not identify the Soviet agent. Wilmoth was
arrested in July after an eight-month investigation by the Naval
Investigative Service, Smith said.
   His court martial was in Yokosuka, Japan, and he was convicted
Sept. 24 on charges of attempted espionage, failure to report a
contact with a Soviet citizen, conspiracy to unlawfully transfer
classified material, and possession use and distribution of
hashish, Smith said.
   Wilmoth, who also received a dishonorable discharge, had been in
the Navy for 2{ years and had served aboard the Midway, which is
based in Japan, since May 1988, Smith said.

<NOTE>New Wire Transfer Regulations in the Works</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department is planning
regulations aimed at money-laundering by international wire
transfer, a Treasury official said.
   Another initiative soon will require banks to report domestic
currency deposits of more than $10,000 on computer tapes, the
official said Wednesday.
   The current reports of those large deposits are made on paper
forms. Banks ``file millions of those, year in and year out. It
creates an avalanche of paper'' that is extremely difficult to
handle by law enforcement agencies trying to track drug profits,
the official said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was
summarizing testimony earlier in the day by Salvatore R. Martoche,
assistant secretary of the treasury for enforcement, before the
Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on terrorism, narcotics and
international operations.
   Just as they report large domestic deposits, banks report
transfers of large sums of cash to and from foreign banks. But
there is no requirement to report international wire transfers,
used increasingly by drug traffickers to move profits to safe
havens.

<TEXT>
   After $15 million spent, 124 witnesses and
more than 1,000 pieces of evidence, both sides have rested in the
2{-year-old McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, the longest
criminal proceeding in U.S. history.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders, who often expressed fear
the 6-year-old case would end in a mistrial, scheduled closing
arguments to begin Oct. 12. He said the jury should get the case by
Nov. 1.
   ``Congratulations, judge,'' defense attorney Danny Davis said as
he left the courtroom.
   ``I'm going to wait to accept that until I get a verdict,'' the
judge replied, adding that he expects the rest of the case to take
up to three months.
   ``I've got three months to keep 12 jurors together and that
makes me nervous.''
   Pounders' skepticism is the result of the long and troubled case
that began in the fall of 1983 as the largest child molestation
prosecution ever.
   Seven teachers at the once prestigious and now-defunct preschool
in Manhattan Beach were arrested and charged with 207 separate
counts. Prosecutors alleged hundreds of children had been molested
during a five-year period.
   Former pupils testified that teachers molested them at the
school while playing games known as ``Naked Movie Star,''
``Tickle'' and ``The Alligator Game.''
   One 10-year-old boy testified that children had been taken from
the school and molested. Animals were mutilated during trips to a
farm and at a church, the boy said.
   Defense attorneys argued the children were brainwashed by
therapists from the Children's Institute International, a
child-abuse detection and treatment center, into believing they had
been molested.
   After an 18-month preliminary hearing, District Attorney Ira
Reiner dismissed all charges against five of the defendants. The
hearing cost the government $6 million.
   Only Raymond Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey,
62, remain accused. They are charged with 64 counts of molestation
and a shared count of conspiracy involving alleged molestations of
11 children at their family-owned school.
   In April, the trial itself itself became the longest criminal
trial in U.S. history, surpassing the two-year record of
California's Hillside Strangler case.
   And with the $15 million spent, it is the most expensive case
ever tried in Los Angeles.
   Fears of a possible mistrial plagued the case in recent months.
   Since the trial began in April 1987 the jury of 12 with a backup
panel of six alternates has dwindled due to illness and employment
problems.
   The last alternate was used recently to replace an ailing juror.
A panel of 12 is required for a verdict in a criminal case.
   ``This is almost as exciting as the day we started jury
selection,'' Deputy District Attorney Roger Gunson said after both
sides had rested.
   ``We could say then, `It's finally started. If there's a
beginning, there must be an end.' And now we're near the end.''

<HEAD>Pastor Sentenced to 10 Years Imprisonment for North Korea Trip</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Presbyterian minister, whose trip to
communist North Korea for reunification talks created a political
uproar in South Korea, was convicted today of aiding an enemy power
and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
   Rev. Moon Ik-hwan walked out of Seoul District Court in protest
before Judge Chung Sang-hak sentenced the dissident leader to 10
years in jail on various charges of aiding North Korea. Moon said
he refused to recognize the court's authority and returned to his
cell.
   ``Sentence me as you please after I leave the court, although I
am not concerned about the penalty,'' the 71-year-old clergyman
said before leaving the courtroom.
   About 100 dissidents sitting in the courtroom clapped when Moon
walked out. The dissidents clapped derisively when the judge
announced the sentence.
   Yoo Won-ho, a businessman who accompanied Moon on the trip to
Pyongyang in March, was also sentenced to 10 years in jail.
   Thr prosecution, which had demanded a life sentence, said the
punishment was too light and it would appeal to a higher court for
a tougher sentence. Defense lawyers said they would appeal to have
the term reduced.
   Judge Chung said Moon and Yoo, while acting out of idealistic
hopes of reuniting the peninsula, had aided the north's attempts to
undermine South Korea by sowing internal dissent. The north poses a
grave military threat to South Korea and there could be no excuse
for Moon's actions, Chung said.
   Chung also noted Moon had backed North Korea's call for
withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S. troops based in the South and this
was part of communist attempts to undermine South Korea. Moon and
other dissidents claim the United States keeps troops in the South
to block reunification of the peninsula.
   The judge said he had not imposed the full sentence because of
Moon's age and because of the defendant's desire for reunification.
Moon has served jail sentences in the past for anti-government
activity.
   Moon, a prominent anti-government leader, made a secret trip to
North Korea to meet top communist leader Kim Il Sung and call for
reunification of the divided Korean peninsula. Moon got to North
Korea by going first to Tokyo and then to Beijing.
   South Korean officials denounced Moon for supporting North Korea
and many South Koreans were shocked that the dissident leader had
associated himself with the totalitarian north. Television pictures
of Moon embracing Kim outraged South Koreans. Public support for
dissident groups plummeted.
   The government cracked down on dissident groups after Moon
appeared in North Korea and scores of top dissident leaders were
jailed. Moon was arrested in April when he returned to Seoul.
   The two Koreas are technically still at war since no peace
treaty was signed at the end of the three-year Korean War in 1953.
Many South Koreans fear the north is determined to reunite the
peninsula by conquest.
   South Korea's tough national security laws ban any contact with
the north without government permission. The Korean border is
sealed and the two sides have frequently clashed over the years.
   Many South Koreans want reunification, but fear the north would
attempt to impose its rule on the entire peninsula. The two sides
have held occasional talks on reunification but have never made
progress.
   The Korean peninsula was divided in 1945 by U.S. and Soviet
forces that ended the Japanese occupation.

   The head of CBS News denied allegations that the
network broadcast fake Afghanistan war footage in 1984, but
acknowledged the tape did misidentify one plane.
   ``After extensive conversations with persons in the United
States and abroad, as well as a searching discussion with
free-lance photographer Michael Hoover, CBS News is satisfied that
allegations it broadcast fake combat footage from Afghanistan in
the mid-1980s are simply not true,'' CBS News President David Burke
said in a memo to staff.
   The New York Post accused ``CBS Evening News'' of broadcasting
staged or re-created scenes shot by Hoover. The Post's editor said
Wednesday the newspaper stands by its story.
   Burke's memo, made available by CBS News, did concede ``the
unintentional use of a misidentified aircraft.'' Burke did not
return phone calls.
   Hoover, flown to New York by CBS for a meeting Tuesday with
Burke and Burke's top assistant, Joseph Peyronnin, said
``absolutely nothing'' was staged in any war footage he provided
CBS News. He said there was an inadvertent misidentification of a
Pakistani jet as a Soviet jet bomber flying over a border area
between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
   That footage was used in a 1987 CBS News documentary, ``The
Battle for Afghanistan,'' which was narrated by Dan Rather, anchor
and managing editor of the ``CBS Evening News.'' Rather did not
return calls Wednesday seeking comment.
   Asked if the plane was flying over Afghanistan at the time it
was filmed, Hoover replied that ``I couldn't swear to that.''
   But the videotape was shot from inside Afghanistan, he said, and
``the plane could have been on either side.''
   The Post had quoted David Isby, a defense consultant who also
writes for Janes' military aviation guidebooks, as identifying the
jet as a Chinese-made plane used by the Pakistani Air Force.
   Jerry Nachman, the Post's editor, said the newspaper was ``very,
very comfortable with what we've printed.'' He said he was ``a
little surprised'' at CBS' stand.
   ``I would have thought they would have done a low-level mea
culpa,'' he said. He explained that he had thought CBS might make
excuses, or say ``the reporter or cameraman was well-intentioned''
but may have unwittingly violated news guidelines.
   ``The Post's allegations are absolute rubbish,'' Hoover said.
``It comes down to my word against what their source's word is, and
this is a guy by the name of Etabari.''
   In the Post story, Etabari, an Afghani whom the newspaper said
had acted as Hoover's translator, was quoted as saying he had seen
Hoover staging several scenes, including the destruction of power
line pylons leading to the capital Kabul.
   Hoover said Etabari, whom a rebel group had assigned him as a
translator, had left him two days after both men entered
Afghanistan with a guerrilla group and wasn't present when the
pylons were destroyed.
   He said the CBS producers who originally had checked his Afghan
footage, Harry Radliffe and Al Ortiz, rechecked it before his
meeting Tuesday with Burke and Peyronnin.

<HEAD>Aquino Vows to Visit U.S., Canada Despite Threats</HEAD>

   President Corazon Aquino today vowed
to go ahead with a trip to the United States and Canada despite a
purported assassination plot and allegations followers of Ferdinand
Marcos plan to foment unrest.
   Mrs. Aquino issued the statement after officials said they had
uncovered an alleged plot to kill the president by agents
apparently linked to Marcos.
   The military chief of staff today said that other assassination
targets included Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, government and
military figures and foreigners.
   ``All we can say for now is that intelligence reports indicate
plans by rightist and leftist elements to take advantage of the
divisiveness that would result if the remains of Mr. Marcos were
allowed to be brought home at this time,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   ``I am going to Canada and the U.S. as planned,'' she added.
Mrs. Aquino is to make the trip next month.
   On Wednesday, the Cabinet endorsed Mrs. Aquino's decision to ban
the body of the former president after Ramos briefed members on the
alleged plot and other threats to the country.
   Marcos supporters have offered to be jailed during burial of
Marcos if Mrs. Aquino allows the body to return from Hawaii, where
he died Sept. 28.
   Marcos' son Ferdinand ``Bongbong'' said today that the family
will keep pressing for 10 years if necessary to return Marcos' body
to his homeland. Marcos ruled for 20 years before his ouster in a
1986 civilian-military uprising that propelled Mrs. Aquino to power.
   Sen. Neptali Gonzales, chairman of the pro-Aquino Struggle of
the Democratic Filipino Party, said the alleged plot against the
Aquino government was uncovered during 10 months of surveillance by
government agents. Gonzales attended a briefing Saturday by Ramos
on the security threat.
   ``Assassination was only a portion of that briefing because it
is one of the components to destabilize the country,'' Gonzales
said in a radio interview. ``I think that is the easiest way to
destabilize the government.''
   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa today said
intelligence agents had been monitoring the alleged plot for about
a year but did not specify whether the conspirators were Marcos
followers.
   De Villa said that other targets included Ramos, civilian and
military officials and foreigners but did not elaborate.
   Gonzales said Ramos gave details of the threat during a two-hour
briefing he attended Saturday at the presidential palace. He would
not elaborate.
   In Hawaii, Bongbong Marcos said the family would continue
pressing the government to bring his father's body home to his
native Ilocos Norte province.
   ``The old man had only one wish and that is be buried in Ilocos
Norte,'' the younger Marcos told radio station DZRH. ``And that we
will do. If we have to wait for 10 years, we will do that.''

<HEAD>N.J. State School Board Approves Jersey City Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS MARTELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JAMESBURG, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new superintendent fired top
administrators of Jersey City's public schools and promised ``to
unravel the quagmire'' after the nation's biggest state takeover of
an urban school district.
   Ellen J. Scambio on Wednesday became steward of the school
system just west of New York City after the state Board of
Education gave final approval to the takeover, ending a five-year
legal battle.
   Gov. Thomas H. Kean applauded the move, saying Jersey City
students were victims of ``educational child abuse.''
   ``Now the community can put politics and patronage aside, and
get on with the business of learning,'' Kean said.
   The state cited political intrusion in hiring practices, poor
test scores, failure to provide a safe and clean environment for
students, violations of bidding laws, failure to provide for
disabled children and unauthorized use of state funds as reasons
for the takeover.
   ``The district's problems were deep-rooted and endemic,'' board
Vice President Robert A. Woodruff said, reading a resolution. ``The
Jersey City board of education totally failed to meet its
obligations.''
   Moments after being confirmed to a three-year term, Ms. Scambio
fired seven top administrators, including school Superintendent
Franklin Williams, and repeated her vow to ``unravel the quagmire
that exists in Jersey City.''
   The state board's action also disbanded the Jersey City Board of
Education. State Education Commissioner Saul Cooperman is expected
to appoint a new board by December.
   Under New Jersey's takeover law, the state has five years to
make improvements. National education groups say they will monitor
the progress of the takeover closely.
   The move gives New Jersey extraordinary powers over the
district, the state's second largest with 28,000 students. Ms.
Scambio will be able to fire administrators _ a power she was quick
to exercise _ and set policy.
   Ms. Scambio said she would consider eliminating between 100 and
150 staff positions, upgrading buildings and improving community
relations to make the district a national model of urban education.
   The district has a staff of 3,322 and a budget of about $180
million. Enrollment is 44 percent black, 34 percent Hispanic and 13
percent white.
   ``The idea of takeover does not come easily to me,'' Cooperman
said. ``I've always believed the role of the state department is to
help others help themselves.''
   Jersey City officials bitterly fought the takeover, saying the
problems were caused by a prior administration and that the state
trumped up its case against the district.
   ``In a society that offers little enough to bolster the
self-confidence of urban children, the campaign to take over the
Jersey City schools has only further lowered the self-image of our
students,'' said Williams, who will be allowed to teach in the
district despite being stripped of the superintendent's job.
   Williams said test scores improved in recent years, and one of
the district's high schools was one of five in the state with a 100
percent passing rate on the high school proficiency test.
   He also charged that heavily Democratic Jersey City was being
targeted by the Republican Kean administration for political
reasons.
   Jean McDonald, a researcher for the National Governors'
Association, said Kentucky, South Carolina, Texas and New Mexico
have laws that allow state takeovers of failing school districts.
   Besides New Jersey, New Mexico and Kentucky have used the law to
take control of school districts.

<HEAD>Meat Processor Pleads Guilty to Fraud, Agrees to Pay $1 Million Fine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A meat processing company agreed to pay a
record $1 million fine after admitting it sold hams with an
excessive amount of water to stores around the country and bribed
federal inspectors.
   Sandy Mac Food Co. and three corporate officers on Wednesday
pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to conspiracy and fraud
charges that also involved mislabeling hams and falsifying federal
records.
   Indictments of six U.S. Department of Agriculture officials,
meanwhile, were unsealed.
   Officials of the Pennsauken-based company built a false back to
a USDA vault at the plant and replaced random samples of ham with
specially manufacture ones that complied with federal regulations,
said U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr.
   ``The Sandy Mac officers realized that there was a lot of money
to be made by pumping excess quanities of water into those hams,''
Alito said.
   The scheme was uncovered in 1987 and the hams were recalled.
Alito said the hams did not pose a health hazard.
   ``It was a fraud on consumers who were getting an awful lot of
water rather than what they thought they were purchasing,'' Alito
said.
   Under federal guidelines, hams can contain up to 10 percent
water, said Wilson Horne, deputy administrator for the USDA in
Washington.
   The $1 million penalty for the company is the largest criminal
fine for adulterating meat products in the agriculture department's
history, said Alito.
   The three company officers also face fines totaling $1 million.
As part of the plea agreement, the company was sold in September,
said Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Zoubek.
   The officers are Merton Zitin, 64, president of Sandy Mac; his
38-year-old son, Michael, and nephew Robert Zitin, 45, all of the
Philadelphia area. They were released on $50,000 bail each.
   The five inspectors and their former supervisor are accused of
accepting bribes between $10,000 to $30,000, Alito said. They were
released on bond and face arraignment Oct. 16.
   They are Willard Jones, 62, of Turnersville; James Siciliano,
46, of Somerdale; Angelo Macrina, 58, of Runnemede; Henry Hodoruk,
60, of Mount Laurel; Julian Drinkard, 62, of Pennsauken; and Carmen
Iezzi, 59, of Collingswood.

<HEAD>Nibbling, Not Gorging, Good for Cholesterol Level</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Noshers of the world don't have to feel so guilty:
A study published today suggests that nibbling may be healthier for
the heart than gorging.
   Researchers wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine that
snacking all day rather than eating three big meals may lower blood
cholesterol.
   The University of Toronto researchers said this means that
cholesterol levels ``may be lowered by increasing meal frequency
alone, with no alteration in the nature or amount of the food
eaten.''
   But they did not advocate putting people on the diet they
tested, which they described as ``an extreme model of nibbling.''
   In the study, seven men ate 2,500 calories a day. For one
two-week period, they got their food in three ordinary-size meals.
For another two weeks, they got the same amount of calories in 17
daily snacks eaten once an hour.
   The nibbling diet lowered their cholesterol levels by 9 percent
and their levels of hazardous low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
or LDL, by 14 percent.
   Nutritionists generally discourage people from eating this way
because snackers tend to take in more calories over the course of
the day and put on weight.
   But the researchers said their study, directed by Dr. David J.A.
Jenkins, backed up other research that suggested those who eat
frequently rather than gorging have healthier hearts.
   The Toronto researchers weren't sure why, but speculated that
nibbling might lower insulin levels or prompt the liver to make
less cholesterol.

<HEAD>Two More Huge Seizures Give Boost to War on Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARLINGEN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The war on drugs got a shot in the arm
as three raids in five days resulted in the seizure of nearly 35
tons of cocaine, the latest an 18,000-pound haul at a house near
the Mexican border.
   Narcotics agents this morning were searching for the owner of a
house that was ``literally stuffed'' with 9 tons of cocaine, the
second largest seizure of cocaine in U.S. history, authorities
said. On Wednesday, three men were arrested at the house, five
miles north of the border.
   Earlier in the day, the Coast Guard made what it called the
largest cocaine confiscation at sea and the third largest in U.S.
history when it boarded a Panamanian supply vessel and uncovered
11,500 pounds of cocaine worth an estimated $525 million.
   The two hauls came just five days after agents entered a
suburban Los Angeles warehouse and found 20 tons of cocaine _ the
world's largest seizure _ worth between $2 billion and $20 billion,
depending on the method of processing.
   ``We had a real lull after things in Colombia went crazy,''
Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Jim Simpson said in Washington, referring to
the Colombian government's crackdown on drug traffickers that began
Aug. 18.
   ``After a long lull, things are moving again.''
   Lt. Waylon Bullard, chief narcotics agent with the Texas
Department of Public Safety's Harlingen office, said the operation
uncovered in the house didn't appear to be connected with the Los
Angeles cocaine operation.
   The 9 tons seized _ worth an estimated $1 billion _ probably
won't affect the national supply of cocaine much, Bullard said, but
he added, ``We sure hurt somebody's pocketbook.''
   Following an informant's tip, state investigators had expected
to find 1,500 pounds of cocaine in the house surrounded by citrus
groves outside Harlingen. They found duffel bags of the drug
stacked so high that there were only two narrow aisles through the
three-bedroom house.
   The house ``was just literally stuffed'' with cocaine wrapped in
plastic and newspapers from Bogota, Colombia, DPS spokesman Mike
Cox said.
   Lt. Tony Garcia said the house was believed to be staging area
for repackaging cocaine after its arrival in the United States.
   One-kilo packages were being packed into 30-inch-tall cardboard
containers when agents arrived, Garcia said. Agents also found two
copies of a list of seven intended recipients of the cocaine, he
added.
   ``It looks like a real intelligence bonanza from other evidence
found at the scene,'' Cox said.
   The three arrested were as Hermenegildo Rivas Sosa, 51, of
Matamoros, Mexico; Alfonso Tristan Gonzalez, 36, of San Antonio;
and Guadencio Garcia, 38, of McAllen.
   The three, who hold resident alien status in the United States,
were to be arraigned today and the 17,950 pounds of cocaine was to
be transported to Austin, officials said.
   The house's owner and two others are being sought, Bullard said.
   Meanwhile, authorities raided five El Paso homes Wednesday in
connection with the Los Angeles seizure and found records of
cocaine shipments, canceled checks, photos and account records,
said agent Bob Sternaman of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration.
   At least two of the homes belonged to Hector Tapia Anchondo, 38,
who was arrested in Las Vegas last weekend. Six others have been
arrested in connection with the Los Angeles seizure.
   Federal investigators have identified a warehouse in El Paso and
three homes across the border in Ciudad Juarez as part of the
distribution network that brought the cocaine to Los Angeles.
   In New Orleans, the 185-foot Zedom Sea was due to arrive under
Coast Guard escort today and the nine people arrested were to be
turned over to the DEA, said Rear Adm. William F. Merlin, commander
of the Coast Guard's 8th District.
   ``It's by far the biggest single seizure on the high seas,''
Merlin said.
   Simpson said the Guard's seizures in the four days since the
current fiscal year began Sunday, including a 1,000-pound haul near
Puerto Rico on Monday, already exceed the total of 12,000 pounds
seized in all of the previous year.

   A female jogger who was raped and beaten almost
to death by a gang of youths in Central Park has offered to talk to
prosecutors about the attack, according to a medical report.
   Prosecutors had feared the 28-year-old investment banker would
be unable to help because of the injuries and impaired memory she
suffered from the April 19 assault.
   The woman, now in physical and psychiatric rehabilitation at
Gaylord Hospital in Wallingford, Conn., was smashed several times
in the head with a rock as the teen-agers took turns raping her,
authorities said. Six youths have been indicted.
   A Metropolitan Hospital psychiatric report dated June 2, said
the victim was ``able to appropriately discuss the idea of speaking
to the district attorney if it will help with the investigation.''
   ``She spontaneously offered that while it was not pleasant, the
investigation was necessary for the case,'' said the report signed
by Dr. Mary Ann Cohen and obtained Wednesday.
   But at another point, the report appeared to justify
prosecutors' fears. ```I don't know what happened,''' Cohen quoted
the victim as saying, ```and maybe I will never know, but I know I
was attacked and I will just have to accept it and deal with it.'''
   District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said no decision has been
made about whether to call the woman as a witness.
   The victim made her comments barely six weeks after the attack
and two days after she began to discuss the incident with family
and doctors.
   Hearings on motions to suppress the youths' statements to police
and on the validity of chemical tests of their bodily fluids will
be held Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh
had a responsibility to write that former Indian Prime Minister
Mararji Desai was a CIA informant, his lawyer said at the close of
a libel trial.
   Attorney Bernard J. Nussbaum said Hersh based his claim about
Desai on interviews with half a dozen ``high level'' government
sources.
   ``When you have that kind of information, doesn't the journalist
have a responsibility to publish it?'' Nussbaum said in his closing
argument Wednesday.
   But Desai's lawyer contended that Hersh ``used his pen as a
sword'' and libeled the former prime minister in his 1983 book,
``The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House.''
   Desai ``worked 72 years of his life to earn honor from his
countrymen, his family, his children and his grandchildren,''
Cyriac D. Kappil said.
   ``With the stroke of a pen, Mr. Hersh assassinated his
reputation, his honor,'' he said.
   The case was expected to go to the jury today after U.S.
District Judge Charles R. Norgle instructs the panel on libel law.
   To reach a finding that libel occurred, the jury must conclude
that Hersh knowingly printed false material with malice, or with
reckless disregard of whether or not it was false.
   Kappil asked the six-member jury to award his client, now 94 and
living in Bombay, $3.5 million. That was far less than the $150
million the lawsuit originally requested and the $50 million it
recently cited.
   Kappil said Hersh fabricated notes to back up the assertions
about Desai, which he knew all along were false, but used ``to put
some flavor, some curry into the book so it would sell.''
   Nussbaum countered by saying the brief accounts in the book that
pertained to Desai were based on interviews with ``high level''
sources, whose identities were not disclosed.
   ``The concept that Mr. Hersh would forge notes to sell books,
that he would knowingly make false statments ... is an obnoxious
concept,'' Nussbaum said. ``It is entirely out of keeping with his
career as a journalist.''
   Hersh, 52, wrote that Desai had been paid $20,000 a year by the
CIA for information about the Indian government and was a valuable
``asset'' to the U.S. government during the administrations of
Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon.
   Desai, who headed India's government from 1977 to 1979 and was a
bitter rival of the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, has denied
he served in such a role.
   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, in testimony Monday,
said he didn't believe Desai was a CIA informant. But he
acknowledged he couldn't be absolutely sure because he wasn't told
the names of informants.
   Hersh won the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting in 1970
for his coverage of the My Lai massacre in Vietnam.

   Convicted PTL aides David and James
Taggart will be sent to a minimum-security prison in Alabama that
once housed Watergate conspirators Charles Colson and former U.S.
Attorney General John Mitchell, the brothers' attorney says.
   The Taggarts, sentenced on tax evasion charges last month, will
be sent to the prison camp at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery,
Ala., attorney Ben Cotten said Wednesday.
   The three-acre prison camp has no fences and features cable
television, a fishing pond and handball courts.
   In 1987, the men's magazine M voted it the fifth best among
``Club Feds'' _ minimum-security federal prisons the magazine said
were the best places to serve time, if one must.
   Inmates usually have 10 days to report to federal prison once
assigned a location. Cotten said the Taggarts haven't been assigned
a date to report yet.
   The Taggarts were convicted in July of using more than $1.1
million in PTL money to pay personal bills and not reporting that
money as income.
   On Sept. 8, U.S. District Judge Robert Potter gave David
Taggart, former personal aide to Jim Bakker, the maximum sentence
of 18 years and five months.
   He gave James Taggart, PTL's former interior decorator, 17 years
and nine months. Potter also fined the two Charlotte men $500,000
each and ordered them to pay at least $525,000 in income taxes.
   Cotten said he plans to file a motion in the next week or two
seeking to reduce the Taggarts' sentences because of their
assistance in Jim Bakker's trial, which went to a jury this week.

   Graham Chapman, a founding member of the zany
British comedy group Monty Python, died of cancer at age 48 as his
former colleagues talked to him about the good old days, his
adopted son said today.
   Chapman was rushed to Maidstone General Hospital in southeast
England from his nearby home on Tuesday and died there Wednesday
night, said his manager, Don Epstein. Funeral arrangements have not
been announced.
   When Chapman died, fellow Monty Python comics Michael Palin and
John Cleese were at his bedside, said the adopted son, John
Tomiczek. Another member of the troupe, Terry Jones, visited him
earlier.
   Chapman, an admitted homosexual and reformed alcoholic who
smoked a pipe, told reporters in August that a dentist found a
cancerous growth on his tonsils during a routine examination.
   Later tests showed he was also suffering from cancer of the
spine, he said.
   He returned to his home last month and was quoted as telling The
Sun, Britain's largest circulation newspaper, that he had beaten
the disease.
   Tomiczek said: ``Graham had been ill for some time. He had been
given the all clear once, but it was a very virulent strain of the
cancer.''
   He said he sat with Chapman for five hours on Wednesday but left
for a moment to allow Cleese and Palin a few moments alone with
their friend.
   ``John Cleese was with him and so was Michael Palin when he
died. Michael was talking to him when he died,'' Tomiczek said. ``I
wasn't there at that time, I had just left.''
   Chapman was educated at Cambridge University and qualified as a
doctor before turning to comedy.
   In 1968, he teamed up with Cleese, Palin, Jones, Eric Idle and
Terry Gilliam to film the television series ``Monty Python's Flying
Circus.''
   The show made its debut on the British Broadcasting Corp. on
Oct. 5, 1969, in a slot previously filled by a Sunday religious
discussion. The last original show was broadcast in December 1974.
   The group's madcap and irreverent approach to comedy was a hit
both in Britain and abroad.
   Chapman often appeared as a stuffy army officer with a comical
upper-class accent. He sometimes appeared in full uniform to
announce that a sketch was being stopped because it was too silly.
   Later, he played the lead in Monty Python's first two films,
King Arthur in ``Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' and Brian in
``Life of Brian.''
   The group celebrated its 20th anniversary three weeks ago by
filming a television special to be released later this year.
   They had planned a huge anniversary party Wednesday night in
London, but it was canceled Wednesday morning when it became
apparent how ill Chapman was, said Nancy Lewis, a spokesman for
Monty Python in New York.
   Jones, now a film writer and director, told Independent Radio
News that Chapman went out in true Python style with his usual
``alternative'' sense of timing: ``Last night we were going to have
our anniversary party to celebrate 20 years of Python. It was 20
years today since the first program went out.
   ``I think it's the worst case of party pooping I have ever come
across. We will all miss him, we loved him very much.''
   Idle, noting the anniversary, said Chapman's ``timing, as usual
(was) impeccable.'' He recalled the televising of their anniversary
show with American actor-comedian Steve Martin.
   ``He (Chapman) arrived in a wheelchair and looked very ill and
very gaunt. Steve Martin who was on the set was very shocked at the
way he looked but Graham looked round, laughed and said `bit over
the top all this isn't it?' which broke the ice.
   ``That is the nice thing about comedy, that is the way comedy
deals with situations like this and Graham would be laughing now,''
Idle said.
   The Monty Python members had gone their separate ways since
their third film, ``Monty Python's Meaning of Life,'' was released
in 1983.
   Epstein said Chapman had been writing for television and movies
in the United States, and that a comedy film he produced and wrote
was about to go into pre-production.
   Chapman also starred as a cranky old knight in an English comedy
television show called ``Jake's Journey,'' which CBS added to its
fall 1988 schedule because of the writer's strike.

   Rex Harrison wasn't able to grit his teeth and
go on with the show after undergoing dental surgery, so a theater
audience had to make do with an understudy.
   Sir Rex, 81, made it through two acts of W. Somerset Maugham's
1921 play ``The Circle'' at the Morris Mechanic Theatre before the
curtain came down and the audience was told he was unable to
continue.
   Producer Elliott Martin said that medication Harrison had
received after the surgery had made it impossible for the actor to
function normally.
   Wednesday afternoon's show went on with Harrison's role of the
aging British Lord Porteous assumed by Louis Turenne, who had been
playing a butler.
   Turenne picked up Harrison's last line and finished the last act
while continuing to wear his butler's costume.
   Harrison also did not perform in Wednesday night's show and is
not expected to perform tonight, according to a theater spokeswoman.
   Harrison was expected to undergo tests today.
   The play is due on Broadway on Nov. 20 with Harrison, Glynis
Johns and Stewart Granger.

<TEXT>
   A B-1B bomber crew, unable
to get the aircraft's nose gear unstuck, guided the plane halfway
across the continent to a white-knuckle landing in the desert,
where it billowed dust as it ground to a halt.
   The $280 million bomber, which wasn't carrying its nuclear
weapons, sutained some damage but did not catch fire Wednesday as
it scraped its nose for more than 30 seconds along the 12-mile-long
dry lake bed in the Mojave Desert.
   The four-man crew escaped injury, said Tech. Sgt. Donn Clarius,
an Edwards spokesman.
   ``The SAC crew exhibited tremendous skill and first-class
airmanship in bringing to a successful conclusion what was, at
best, a difficult situation,'' said a statement from Strategic Air
Command headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base, Neb.
   The flight began nearly 12 hours earlier as a training mission
over Texas but quickly turned tense when the nose landing gear
jammed.
   After attempting to jar the nose wheel lose with a touch-and-go
landing on the main gear at Dyess Air Force Base near Abilene, the
crew refueled in the air and flew to 1,200 miles to California.
   The Air Force opted to land at Edwards, 60 miles north of Los
Angeles, because of the forgiving nature of the clay surface and
the wide open spaces on the desert base, which is used for space
shuttle landings and is often a haven for troubled aircraft.
   Ground crews were assessing damage to the bomber, Clarius said.
   Dale Punter, a resident of nearby Lancaster and an aerospace
buff, said radio traffic between the pilots and controllers
described the landing as ``perfect.''
   ``It was real nice. Structure looking good,'' Punter quoted the
pilot as saying just after the landing.
   Lt. Anu Sjaardema, an Edwards spokeswoman, said the bomber
wasn't carrying nuclear weapons.
   Aboard were Capt. Jeffrey K. Beene, 30, aircraft commander,
assigned to 337th Bombardment Squadron; Capt. Vernon B. Benton, 30,
co-pilot; Capt. Robert H. Hendricks, 31, offensive systems officer
and Lt. Col. Joseph G. Day, 38, an instructor and offensive systems
officer.
   The plane took off at 6:38 a.m. PDT from Dyess, one of four
bases in the country where the B-1 is stationed. The aircraft
started circling Dyess about three hours later as mechanics from
Dyess and the plane's manufacturer, Rockwell International, worked
with the crew to try get the nose gear down.
   The bomber left for California five hours later and landed at
6:15 p.m.
   The B-1B, with a maximum speed of 1,000 mph and range of more
than 7,000 miles, is 147 feet long and 137 feet wide when its
swing-wings are extended. It weighs 477,000 pounds fully fueled and
armed. It is the most sophisticated bomber on active duty. The B-2
stealth bomber is still in the test stage.
   Despite its critical role, the B-1 has been plagued with
problems, including fuel leaks and complaints about performance of
its electronic warfare components.
   There have been three B-1B crashes, and the crash of a B-1
prototype.
   The most recent crash was in November 1988 in South Dakota. An
Air Force report blamed the pilot and co-pilot, saying they lost
track of altitude when they strained to line up their landing
approach in heavy overcast. The crew ejected.
   The crashes left the Air Force with 97 B1-Bs, the first bomber
added to the Strategic Air Command in about 25 years. Production
has been completed, for $20.5 billion.
   In February, the General Accounting Office said problems persist
in performance and fuel leaks probably could not be corrected.
Fixes could cost $400 million per aircraft if the Air Force decided
to do them all, the GAO said.

<TEXT>
   For the thousands of East German
refugees, their dramatic train trip through their Communist
homeland en route to the West was a bitter and poignant reminder of
why they wanted out.
   ``Police, police, nothing but police,'' 19-year-old Antje Major
of Frankfurt an der Oder said after arriving in Bavaria today. ``It
was awful.''
   In Dresden, East Germany, thousands of would-be refugees fought
pitched battles with police, who stopped them from boarding the
refugee trains, which carried East Germans from the West German
Embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia.
   Elsewhere along the route, police and workers' groups pushed
back thousands of others hoping for passage to the West.
   East Germany officially described the latest exodus of 7,600 of
its citzens from the West German Embassy in Prague as an
``expulsion.'' Some of the refugees had spent 14 hours in locked,
unheated East German trains because of lengthy delays.
   ``Out of hell, finally!'' shouted a young man from a window as
one train carrying thousands of refugees pulled into the northern
Bavarian town of Hof shortly after dawn.
   ``It was like a coffin, simply dead,'' said a 48-year-old woman
who identified herself only by her first name, Christel.
   Since Hungary opened its borders to the West on Sept. 11, more
than 40,000 East Germans have fled to West Germany. Many East
Germans criticized their hard-line country for failing to adopt
political and economic reforms being tried in the Soviet Union,
Poland and Hungary.
   Today, eight trains carrying refugees arrived in Hof after
traveling through East Germany, a route dictated by that nation.
Police dispersing crowds before the trains came through partly
caused the delays. Refugees arriving in Hof said they stopped for
some time before going through Dresden.
   ``From bridges and high-rise apartment houses, we could see
people waving to us.'' Christel said. ``Everything else was
empty,'' she added.
   ``I have never experienced anything like that before. Only when
we got here, did we see people outside again.''
   Her daughter, 24-year-old Sybile, clutching her 4-year-old son
Marcus, said: ``I just took a deep breath when we crossed into West
Germany. I felt such relief.''
   Guido Albrecht, 26, of Potsdam, outside Berlin said:
``Everything was sealed off.''
   ``The police were everywhere,'' said Albrecht, who arrived with
his wife, Kerstin, 28. ``We just decided on Tuesday morning that we
would go to Czechoslovakia and the embassy in Prague. We drove. We
left the car in Prague and we made it just before they clamped down
on travel to Cezchoslovakia.''
   ``We spent the night outside the embassy in the cold. We were
really freezing, but there was no going back.''

   A man who claimed a brain injury rendered him
insane pleaded for the death penalty for raping 29 women and
molesting a girl but instead drew the longest sentence in Ohio
history _ up to 3,195 years behind bars.
   ``My honest to God wish is that I wish to be injected with
sodium pentothal and be given ... injections until I'm dead,''
Ronnie Shelton told Common Pleas Judge Richard McMonagle before
receiving at least 1,555 years in prison.
   ``You are a menace,'' McMonagle told Shelton on Wednesday in
imposing the maximum consecutive sentences on 220 counts that
included rape, robbery, kidnapping and assault. Only murder carries
a possible death sentence in Ohio.
   Shelton, 28, was convicted earlier Wednesday in the attacks,
which took place from 1983 to 1988. Dubbed the West Side rapist,
Shelton often stalked his victims before attacking them.
   Records show no other defendant has been charged with so many
counts or sentenced to as many years in prison, said Timothy
McGinty, an assistant prosecutor.
   Shelton had pleaded innocent by reason of insanity. Psychiatrist
Emanuel Taney had testified that Shelton had a brain injury caused
by a fall from a roof and should spend the rest of his life in a
mental institution.
   But the prosecutor said: ``There is nothing wrong with this guy.
He's just mean and evil. The jury saw it was an act.''
   Shelton could be considered for parole in 15 years, said defense
attorney Jay Milano. But he added, ``The nature of his acts are
such that with the amount of people involved, I question whether
he'll ever get out.''
   Milano said Shelton will appeal.

   Tibetans danced and sang in the streets
of this Himalayan town today after their spiritual leader, the
Dalai Lama, won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize.
   Shops closed and excited people rushed out, singing folk songs
in praise of the Dalai Lama, who has been living in exile in
Dharmsala since he fled from his homeland in 1959.
   The Tibetan government-in-exile announced a holiday for its
offices and called for a public prayer service Friday in the main
Buddhist temple, Theken Choaling.
   The Dalai Lama, who won the coveted prize for a non-violent
struggle to free his Himalayan nation from Chinese rule, is
currently in the United States.
   ``I feel it has been long overdue,'' said Sonan Topgyal, the
general secretary of the Tibetan Information and International
Relations in Dharamsala.
   ``It will be one step closer to (Tibetan) independence,'' he
said.
   The Dalai Lama, who was born Tenzin Gyatso on June 7, 1935, was
cited by the Nobel Committee for shunning violence and advocating
peaceful measures to liberate Tibet.
   China moved in its army and occupied Tibet in 1950. In March,
Chinese troops imposed martial law in Tibet following the most
recent round of pro-independence rioting. At least 38 people have
been reported killled.
   ``The Nobel Prize has given a new dimension to the Tibetan
struggle,'' said Lhasang Tsering, the president of the Tibetan
Youth Congress which has long advocated an armed independence
struggle. However, he said: ``Our call for an armed struggle will
not be affected. It will remain.''
   The Chinese insist Tibet has been an integral part of China
since the 13th century. The Beijing government has said it is ready
for talks if the Dalai Lama renounces Tibetan independence.
   The Dalai Lama has proposed a compromise, offering o keep Tibet
as an autonomous Chinese territory and to relinquish control of
foreign affairs to Beijing.

   China regards the Dalai Lama, winner of the 1989
Nobel Peace Prize, as a separatist whose followers have instigated
violence and discord in his native land of Tibet.
   Chinese government offices were closed tonight, and there was no
immediate reaction to the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader's winning
the coveted prize.
   China was certain, however, to be displeased, as the immediate
reaction of an embassy official in Oslo indicated.
   Wang Guisheng, an official at the Chinese Embassy in the
Norwegian capital, was quoted as saying: ``This has hurt the
Chinese people's feelings.'' He reiterated the claim that Tibet has
always been an integral part of China.
   In China, Premier Li Peng expressed the Chinese position toward
the Dalai Lama last year when he said the government would only
conduct talks with the Dalai Lama when he ``abandons his splittist
activities and maintains the unification of the motherland.''
   Beijing rejected the Dalai Lama's compromise proposal, made in a
June 1988 speech to the European Parliament, for the creation of a
self-governing Tibet in which China could station troops there and
have control over the region's foreign affairs.
   The Dalai Lama's proposals, the authoritative Beijing Review
said, ``attempt to tamper with history, distort reality and deny
Tibet's status as an inalienable part of China's territory under
Chinese sovereignty.''
   China rarely attacks the Dalai Lama directly for the
intermittent anti-Chinese, pro-independence violence that has hit
the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, over the past two years.
   But when riots break out, as they did in March when about 30
people were killed, the government invariably blames the ``Dalai
Lama clique'' of Buddhist monks and followers of the spiritual
leader based at his home-in-exile in Dharamsala in northern India.
   China imposed martial law in Lhasa on March 7 to quell the
disturbances and avoid a further violence on March 10, the 30th
anniversary of a failed uprising against the Chinese army that led
to the Dalai Lama's flight to India.
   Martial law remains in effect in the city, and Tibetan hostility
to Chinese rule shows no signs of abating. Chinese who have been in
Lhasa recently report random attacks on Chinese on the streets.
   China insists that Tibet has been an integral part of China
since the 13th century, but many Tibetans are deeply resentful of
the Chinese presence because of China's past suppression of Tibetan
religion and customs, particularly during the leftist 1966-76
Cultural Revolution.
   The Dalai Lama is still revered by the Tibetan people, who ask
foreign tourists for his picture and talk of the day when he will
return to be their leader again.
   China has invited the Dalai Lama to return, but only after he
gives up all claims to Tibetan independence. It is not clear
whether he would be allowed to return to live in Lhasa.
   China has also insisted that any negotiations with the Dalai
Lama not include foreigners or members of his
``government-in-exile.'' The Chinese stress that any talks would be
strictly a Chinese internal affair.
   The Dalai Lama's political activities abroad have invariably
angered the Chinese. China blamed the first major outbreak of
violence in Lhasa, in the fall of 1987, on the Dalai Lama's
impassioned plea for Tibetan rights in a Washington meeting with
members of Congress.

<HEAD>House Speaker Rescues Massachusetts Health Insurance Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL BEEGAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state House turned back an attempt to gut
Massachusetts' first-in-the-nation universal health insurance law
but voted to delay its key provision for a year.
   In an uncommon move, House Speaker George Keverian, a Democrat,
left the rostrum Wednesday and took to the floor to offer an
amendment to preserve the program, a centerpiece in Gov. Michael
Dukakis' 1988 presidential campaign.
   Keverian saved the bill's key provision _ a mandate that
businesses with six or more employees provide health insurance
worth $1,680 to each worker _ by delaying its effect until 1993.
   The bill goes next to the Senate.
   Rep. Peter Forman, a Republican, had won preliminary House
approval in July to repeal the key provision. He had argued the
plan would cost between $400 million and $1 billion in tax dollars
and could harm businesses with the added burden.
   Under the plan, the state would subsidize health insurance for
workers whose employers opt not to buy coverage for their
employees. It would also help provide insurance to the
self-employed and to businesses with fewer than six employees.
   Keverian argued against repeal and pleaded instead for a delay
in implementation to study the law's funding. The
Democratic-controlled House agreed 96-53.
   Dukakis spokeswoman Mindy Lubber credited Keverian's ``great
leadership'' with preserving the program to provide insurance to
the uninsured.
   The Keverian amendment would also keep in place a provision that
would take effect next year to provide insurance to jobless workers
collecting unemployment compensation. That plan would be financed
by a $16.80-a-year fee, which businesses with six or more workers
would pay for each employee.
   The plan has already provided health insurance to about 77,000
of the estimated 600,000 Massachusetts residents who did not have
insurance when the plan was passed last year.
   Of that total, 17,000 are people moving off welfare into jobs
that don't provide health insurance, as well as disabled adults and
some children with serious disabilities. The 60,000 others are
college students who were required this school year to have health
insurance either through their parents or through group plans
offered through colleges.

<HEAD>Group Claims it Killed Jewish Leader in Brussels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An underground group called the Soldiers
of Justice today claimed responsibility for the killing of a
Belgian Jewish leader in Brussels and charged he was a spy for
Israel.
   In a statement delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut, the
group said the slaying of Dr. Joseph Wybran on Tuesday was in
support of the 22-month-old Palestinian uprising in the
Israeli-occupied territories.
   ``We have executed the death sentence against the leader of
Belgium's Jewish community in Brussels and one of the main leaders
of Israel's Mossad secret service, Dr. Joseph Wybran, on Oct. 3,''
said the group, which appears to be a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
organization.
   Wybran, 49, was shot in the head as he got into his car outside
Brussels University Hospital, where he headed the immunology
department. A hospital spokesman said he died early Wednesday.
There was not witnesses to the attack, and authorities said the
undetermined number of gunmen escaped.
   Wybran was head of the Coordinating Committee of Jewish
Organizations in Belgium, which represents 30,000 Jews in this
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country of 9.9 million. He was
considered a moderate in the Israeli-Arab conflict.
   Soldiers of Justice has in the past claimed responsibility for
killing Saudi Arabian diplomats.
   The group also claimed responsibility for kidnapping Belgian
doctor Jan Cools, who was abducted May 21, 1988, after he left his
apartment in west Beirut. The 32-year-old physician with the
Norwegian Aid Committee had been working in Rashidiyeh refugee camp
in Tyre, southern Lebanon.
   Soldiers of Justice claimed in December that it was holding him
hostage and accused him of being an Israeli spy. He was released
June 15 following the intervention of the Belgian government.
   The group also claimed responsibility for an arson attack on a
Jewish club in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Dec. 11.

Bra Patch and a Cub Scout troop.
   A Department of Transportation official said Wednesday the
agency feared motorists would be offended by the words ``sex'' and
``bra'' on the green-and-white road signs that identify
Adopt-A-Highway volunteers.
   ``I sure don't consider it offensive,'' said Sally Russell,
owner of the Pennyrich Bra Patch in Fayetteville. ``Everybody wears
bras, and everybody wears underclothing. It's a legitimate business
and we're entitled to adopt a highway as much as anybody else.''
   James Sughrue, assistant transportation secretary, said the Cub
Scouts were rejected as too young. A fifth group, a chapter of the
Sons of Confederate Veterans, was rejected for fear of vandalism of
Civil War monuments in their area.
   Sughrue said the state had rejected only those five applications
since the trash-pickup program began in 1988.
   Under the program, weekend volunteers from more than 4,500 civic
groups, businesses and neighborhoods pick up litter from more than
10,000 miles of road. Each group ``adopts'' a stretch of highway
and is given a road sign identifying it as theirs.
   The Reidsville chapter of the KKK was turned down by
Transportation Secretary James Harrington, who said a KKK sign
probably would cause more littering along the group's adopted
highway.

   At least 18 young Sinhalese were
beheaded or shot to death and their bodies were dumped in a central
Sri Lankan university campus, a government official said today.
   Elsewhere, a leader of a Tamil-dominated province in Sri Lanka's
northeast said an army of 30,000 Tamils is training to replace
Indian peacekeeping troops scheduled to withdraw by Dec. 31.
   Four bodies were found on the lawn of the Peradeniya University
and 14 more were found nearby outside a lecture hall early today,
said residents of Kandy where the university is located. It was not
immediately known if the victims were students.
   The killings apparently were in retaliation for the
assassination Wednesday of the university's assistant registrar,
Edward Nagahawatta, according to residents and a government
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Two gunmen on a bicycle killed Nagahawatta, a volunteer soldier,
inside the campus, 55 miles northeast of Colombo. Authorities
blamed Sinhalese radicals of the People's Liberation Front, an
anti-government guerrilla group.
   Sri Lankan human rights groups say the military and
pro-government death squads routinely kill sympathizers of the
Sinhalese radicals. The government denies the charge.
   The government's defense adviser, Gen. Sepala Attygalle, said he
was aware that 18 bodies had been found in the univeristy, but he
did not have details.
   Meanwhile, Vartharajah Perumal, chief minister of the
Northeastern Provincial Council, said an army is being set up to
``protect the Tamil people and the democratic system now existing
in the northeast.'' The council is a form of local government.
   ``We are not increasing the militarization of the north and the
east. We are creating a legitimate armed force,'' he told reporters.
   Permual's Eelam People's Liberation Front, a former separatist
rebel group, fears its members will face armed attacks by the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the dominant guerrillas fighting
the Indian soldiers.
   The Tamil Tigers refused to join the political mainstream when
most other militias, including Perumal's group, agreed to abide by
an India-mediated peace accord in July 1987.
   The accord promised limited autonomy to the minority Tamils in
the northeast in exchange for the surrender of arms by the
guerrillas, which was to be supervised by the Indian peacekeeping
soldiers.
   The Tamil Tigers reneged on the accord and began attacking
Indian soliders.
   Other Tamil groups that gave up fighting say President
Ranasinghe Premadasa's government, dominated by the country's
Sinhalese majority, has not fully turned over the political powers
promised in the accord.
   India plans to have withdrawn its 40,000 peacekeeping troops in
the island's northeast by Dec. 31.
   The Indian troops' deployment also angered Sinhalese rebels in
the south, who launched a campaign of assassinations and terror to
overthrow the government, saying the Indian presence compromised
the country's independence.
   Sinhalese radicals also contend the government gave the Tamils,
most of whom live in the northeast, too many concessions in the
July 1987 accord.
   More than 5,000 people have been killed in two years of violence
inspired by the southern rebels. The Tamil insurgency that began in
1983 has claimed the lives of 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian
soldiers.
   Tamil demands for a separate state grew out of complaints of
discrimination in jobs and education by the Sinhalese, who make up
75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people. Tamils make up 18
percent of the population.

<HEAD>Bush Says He Was Kind of Flashy as a Baseball Player</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There lurks in the heart of the man in the
Oval Office the soul of a baseball player, a former college first
baseman who hit .255 or .260 at his best.
   ``I was kind of a flashy kind of guy,'' President Bush told USA
Today in an all-sports interview published today. ``I knew the
position well and liked it. I wasn't a really good baseball player
because of my hitting ...
   ``As a fielder, I really felt good about it. I could contribute
to the team. Cover the bunt pretty well. My arm was fair _ not
great by a long shot, but I could catch the ball. They could make
bad throws and I was pretty dependable.''
   Bush played for Yale in 1946, 1947 and 1948, when he was
captain. As he talked with USA Today's Hal Bodley, he rummaged
through a drawer in his desk.
   ``Here it is, my McQuinn Trapper,'' said the president of the
United States triumphantly after finding his first baseman's mitt.
   Bush, who as president has made a number of evening trips to see
the Orioles in Baltimore, 40 miles north of Washington, said if his
schedule permits, he will attend at least one World Series game. He
showed that he is keeping up by discussing Gary Carter and Keith
Hernandez of the New York Mets, who were cut from the team Tuesday.
   Asked what kind of manager he would be, the president replied:
   ``Probably fairly cautious. I'd play by the averages, probably
get people on, be cautious about too much stealing and bunt 'em
over.''
   ``I think just steady is what I'd say,'' Bush added. ``Maybe
that's why I liked Lou Gehrig so much. He was good, reliable,
always there and a good influence.''

   A community relations board has proposed a pop
concert and a ``unity summit'' to help keep racial peace when a
policeman goes on trial Oct. 23 in the slaying of a black
motorcyclist.
   The Dade County Community Relations Board also is training
crisis teams to be sent to areas where rock-throwing or other
violence erupts to try to calm people down.
   ``If anything happens, it won't be a pretty picture,'' board
coordinator Willie Sims said Wednesday during a training session.
``We just want to be ready.''
   Officer William Lozano is charged with manslaughter in the
shooting of Clement Anthony Lloyd. The slaying touched off three
days of race riots that left one dead, 11 people wounded by gunfire
and 13 structures burned down.
   Lozano, who is Hispanic, said he fired because the motorcycle
was heading straight for him. Residents of the black neighborhood
said the shooting was unwarranted.
   The board, 30 volunteers and 11 county staffers who have worked
for years to foster understanding among ethnic groups, proposed a
Nov. 10 concert at the Miami Arena to bring together 12,000 whites,
blacks and Hispanics.
   CRB director Ari Sosa, who made the proposals, also suggested a
``unity summit'' in late October or early November of black,
Hispanic, white and Jewish organizations.

<HEAD>USS Iowa Captain, 3 Subordinates Cited for Lax Procedures</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 9th graf, However, that with comment by

<TEXT>
   The Navy says the captain of the USS Iowa and
three subordinates are being cited for violating administrative
procedures, but that their ``dereliction of duty'' didn't
contribute to an explosion that killed 47 men.
   The citations resulted from admiral's mast hearings conducted
earlier this week on board the Iowa in the Mediterranean by Vice
Adm. Joseph S. Donnell III.
   ``It should be stressed that although deficiencies in the Iowa's
training documentation, weapons handling requirements and adherence
to safety procedures were found within the weapons department, the
investigation determined that these shortcomings did not cause or
contribute to the explosion,'' the Navy said in a statement.
   Each of the four was charged with ``a dereliction of duty under
the Uniform Code of Military Justice as a result of administrative
deficiencies found in the USS Iowa investigation,'' the Navy said.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today that the disciplinary
actions were correct.
   ``All the procedures were not adhered to,'' Cheney said on
ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' program. ``Those flaws did not
contribute to the explosion. But when you discover those types of
administrative foul-ups, you want to take action. That's what the
Navy did. I thought the action was appropriate.''
   The Navy said the lax procedures were found during an
investigation of the April 19 explosion.
   The Navy concluded earlier that the explosion in the
battleship's No. 2 gun turret was ``most likely'' triggered when
gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig inserted a detonator between two
powder bags.
   However, that report has been criticized by members of Congress
and by Hartwig's relatives.
   Kathy Kubicina of Cleveland, Hartwig's sister, said she was not
surprised by the Navy action.
   ``They got merely a slap on the wrists. If they would have
gotten something harsher, the Navy would have had to admit their
own guilt. I was prepared for this, which is absolutely nothing,''
she said.
   During the investigation, other alleged violations were found,
including experimentation with extra-strength gunpowder and
projectile loads, the Navy said. Those allegations prompted the
admiral's mast hearings.
   Capt. Fred P. Moosally, commander of the battleship, and his
operations officer, Cmdr. Robert Finney, were subject to
``administrative corrective measures,'' the Navy said.
   Stiffer penalties went to Cmdr. Robert J. Kissinger, the weapons
officer, and Master Chief Petty Officer Stephen Skelly, the fire
control gunner. They were given career-damaging punitive letters of
admonition and suspended fines, $2,000 for Kissinger and $1,000 for
Skelly.
   The Navy said the action against Moosally was less severe
because ``subordinates were held accountable for deficiencies in
their specifically assigned duties.''
   All four men may appeal.

<HEAD>Lawmakers to Debate Syrian Role; Moslem Warlords Talk Tough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ABDULLAH AL-SHEHRI</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIF, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanese lawmakers have been asked to
consider a plan to gradually withdraw Syrian forces from the
country, but Moslem warlords said the peace parley was destined to
fail.
   Any political settlement reached by members of Lebanon's divided
legislature would have to be acceptable to the militia leaders who
have battled for 14 years.
   The 30 Moslem and 33 Christian members of Parliament planned to
begin debating today Syria's role in the war, conference sources
said.
   Christian deputies were demanding that Syria withdraw its 40,000
troops from Lebanon as a condition for accepting reforms designed
to give more power to Moslems.
   Syria and many of its Lebanese Moslem allies advocate putting
the reforms into effect first, to be followed by a Syrian pullout.
   The reforms are intended to rectify the balance of power in
Lebanon, where Maronite Christians have held the presidency as well
as leading posts in the army and judiciary since independence in
1943.
   A three-man Arab League mediation committee has submitted a
compromise proposal for a phased Syrian withdrawal, first from the
immediate Beirut region, eventually pulling back to the Bekaa
Valley in eastern Lebanon.
   The timing was left flexible and conditional on the
reinstatement of a central government, although a two-year
timetable has frequently been mentioned.
   A total pullout of Syria's forces from the Bekaa Valley, and
Lebanon, would follow the conclusion of a security pact between
Damascus and Beirut at a later stage.
   Christian deputy Farid Sarhal said in a speech he distributed to
fellow legislators and the press that ``there can be no Syrian
solution to the Lebanese problem and (there can be) no solution
without Syria and without agreement with it.
   ``This is a political fact which we cannot escape or deny.''
   The conference sources said mediators including host Saudi
Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal have been working
intensively to try to get Christians to water down their demand for
a Syrian pullout to precede implementation of reforms.
   The mediators also lobbied Moslem deputies to try to persuade
them to drop their opposition to any such linkage, said the
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In Tehran, the leaders of four Lebanese Moslem factions issued a
statement Thursday blaming the Christian leader, Gen. Michel Aoun,
for the crisis in their country, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
   In a dispatch monitored in Cyprus, it paraphrased the statement
as saying any plan that ignores the interests of the Lebanese
nation is bound to fail.
   The statement said the Taif conference was doomed to failure and
called for the overthrow of Aoun, the agency said.
   It was issued by Nabih Berri, leader of the Shiite Amal
movement; Druse chieftain Walid Jumblatt; Sheik Subhi Tufaili, a
leader of the Shiite Hezbollah or Party of God; and Sheik Saeed
Shaaban, head of a Syrian-backed Sunni fundamentalist faction.
   Iranian leaders are calling for the bulk of political power in
Lebanon to be handed to the Moslems, who are generally believed to
make up about 55 percent of the country's 4 million people.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus, quoted Jumblatt as saying
``we believe that the Taif conference is no more than a break in
the fighting'' to give the Maronites a chance to rearm their forces.
   It also paraphrased Berri as saying no solution was possible in
Lebanon without the destruction of Maronite rule.
   It was not clear whether the tough statements from Iran's and
Syria's Moslem allies were meant as a warning of impending warfare,
or simply designed to shore up the Moslem militias' position during
the Taif talks.

<TEXT>
   Jurors said they acquitted a rape
defendant because the alleged victim's clothing _ a tank top, a
sheer, short skirt and no underwear _ suggested she had ``asked for
it.''
   The woman's lawyer called the decision ``scary.''
   ``I thought this was 1989,'' said Alexander Siegel. ``Every time
a female goes out alone does she have to look in the mirror and
think is the dress appropriate or does it risk violence to her body
and mind?''
   On the night the 22-year-old Coconut Creek woman said she was
raped, she wore a tank top and a short, white lace skirt without
underwear, according to testimony.
   ``She asked for it,'' said juror Roy Diamond. ``The way she was
dressed with that skirt you could see everything she had. She was
advertising for sex.''
   The woman was not in court Wednesday when the jury of three men
and three women found Steven L. Lord, 26, not guilty. The woman
said Lord abducted her Nov. 6 from a parking lot and forced her
into her car, pulling over twice to rape her at knifepoint.
   Siegel said the verdict was especially painful because the woman
had been jailed for six days for refusing to testify. That action
had angered victims' rights advocates.
   ``She said the jury was obviously several generations older than
her and if they would go out to nightclubs they would see that how
she was dressed was not provocatively but similar to many other
women,'' Siegel said.
   ``And if being in style is asking to be raped, she said that's a
sad statement on society.''
   Lord testified that the woman traded sex for money and cocaine,
and defense attorney Timothy Day argued her intentions were borne
out by the way she dressed.
   ``I have to question why she wore a semi-see-through skirt with
no underwear,'' he said.
   A juror, Dean Medeiros, said, ``We felt she was up to no good
the way she was dressed.''
   ``She was obviously dressed for a good time, but we felt she may
have bit off more than she could chew,'' said juror Mary Bradshaw.
   Jurors also described the woman as arrogant and not credible.
   Lord faces assault charges in three other cases and was ordered
returned to Georgia for trial.

<TEXT>
   Trainloads of elated East Germans
rolled into this border town today, and thousands of their
desperate countrymen battled police in Dresden while trying to
board the freedom trains to the West.
   Eight trains packed with 7,600 refugees arrived after an
overnight journey from Prague, Czechoslovakia, where they had
sought refuge in hopes of following other East Germans who were
allowed to emigrate during the weekend.
   ``Out of hell, finally!'' shouted one young man from a train
window as one of the trains pulled into this northern Bavarian town
shortly after dawn today. Some of the refugees had spent 14 hours
on board the trains.
   In Poland, meanwhile, another 600 East Germans who sought asylum
in the West German Embassy in Warsaw were told today they also will
be allowed to flee to West Germany, West German Foreign Ministry
spokesman Juergen Chrobog announced.
   When trains from Prague began arriving in Hof today, thousands
of refugees leaned out train windows cheering and clapping, while
others burst into tears of joy. Relief workers handed out food and
clean clothing.
   East Germany agreed to allow the exodus from the West German
embassies in Prague and Warsaw _ the second in five days _ on
Tuesday. It then tried to stop the refugee flood by closing its
border with Czechoslovakia, the only nation where East Germans
could freely travel.
   East Germany made the move to end the exodus of its young and
skilled citizens before the hard-line Communist country celebrates
its 40th anniversary this weekend.
   In a face-saving move, the trains traveled from Prague back into
East Germany before heading into West Germany so the government in
East Berlin could officially expel the refugees.
   Many East Germans tried desperately to reach Prague and join the
exodus, but 200 who made it there decided not to take the trains to
West Germany, instead accepting an offer from the East Berlin
government to return home with a guarantee of emigration within six
months.
   East Germany had made the offer last week in an effort to get
the refugees who had converged on the Prague and Warsaw embassies
to leave. It was not known why the 200 who accepted the offer
bypassed an immediate opportunity to leave on the trains, but
family considerations in East Germany may have played a role.
   Despite the closed border with Czechoslovakia, another 20 East
Germans arrived at the Prague embassy after the trains had departed
on Wednesday. They, too, were seeking asylum.
   West German Embassy officials initially estimated the number of
refugees in the embassy at 10,000-11,000 and said they would be
traveling on 15 trains to Hof. Only eight trains arrived with 7,600.
   In the East German city of Dresden, people fought running
battles with police, overturned cars and smashed windows of the
main ralroad station Wednesday night, witnesses said.
   ``We want out! we want out!'' the would-be refugees screamed as
police swinging truncheons charged to drive them back from the main
railroad station.
   ``An incredible amount of time passed before we could go through
Dresden. I think there must have been some disturbances,'' said
26-year-old refugee Guido Albrecht of Potsdam.
   Witnesses said police also used a water cannon to try to
disperse the crowd as the refugee trains passed through. They said
the police broke up the demonstration after midnight.
   British tourist Adrian Maitland said he saw police charge the
crowd several times from a hotel overlooking the railway station.
   ``It looks like a battleground,'' he told the British
Broadcasting Corp. by telephone. ``There are fire engines all
around. There are ambulances. I've seen youths being carried off
with blood streaming down their face.''
   Police had also clashed with 5,000 would-be refugees in Dresden
on Tuesday night.
   Thousands of East Germans had flocked to train stations and
lined tracks in their homeland in hopes of joining the refugees
aboard what could be the last ``freedom trains'' to the West.
   The trains' journey West was plagued by delays as police
dispersed the crowds before the trains came through. Passengers
arriving in Hof said they stopped for some time before going
through the Dresden.
   ``Saying goodbye like that was indescribable feeling,'' one
young refugee said in Hof of the trip through his homeland.
   As the first train rumbled into Hof at dawn, a deafening cheer
rang out from hundreds of well-wishers who had spent hours waiting
in freezing weather.
   Interior Ministry official Horst Waffenschmidt told reporters
the trains' doors had been locked in Prague to prevent anyone else
from boarding.
   On Sunday, 7,000 East Germans arrived in West Germany after East
Germany allowed those crowded in embassies in Prague and Warsaw to
leave. Many said they had jumped onto the trains as they passed
through East Germany.
   The clampdown on travel was also likely to severely curb the
number of East Germans going to reform-minded Hungary, which
spurred the exodus last month by allowing thousands of East Germans
to pass through to the West. The shortest route to Hungary from
East Germany is through Czechoslovakia.
   East Germans were frantically trying other avenues to reach West
Germany.
   In East Berlin, police Wednesday scuffled with 50 East Germans
trying to enter the U.S. Embassy, witnesses said. Eighteen others
made it inside the compound Tuesday but agreed late Wednesday to
leave with assurances their government will look favorable on their
emigration requests, diplomats said.

<HEAD>Daley Loses Aldermen Watchdog Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chicago's aldermen exempted themselves from a bid
by Mayor Richard M. Daley to ferret out corruption.
   The City Council voted 46-1 Wednesday in favor of a watered-down
version of Daley's suggested ordinance to create an inspector
general.
   The inspector general would investigate corruption among the
city's 38,000 employees _ except aldermen and their staffs.
   ``I think we are sending the wrong message to our constituents,
which is that it's OK to investigate wrongdoing, just don't
investigate us,'' said Alderman David Orr, who tried to include
aldermen in the ordinance.
   But Alderman Burt Natarus argued the system is already working,
since 15 aldermen have been convicted of criminal wrongdoing over
the past two decades.
   Daley, whose late father was mayor for more than 20 years, said
he got 95 percent of what he wanted in the legislation, even though
many aldermen usually loyal to Daley opted not to stand with him on
the issue.
   ``I pushed as hard as the Cubs did to get into the World
Series,'' Daley said.

<HEAD>President to Have Cyst Removed From Hand</HEAD>

   President Bush will undergo minor surgery
Friday at Walter Reed Army Medical Center to remove an apparently
non-cancerous cyst from the middle finger of his right hand, the
White House announced today.
   Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the president, who is
left-handed, would be given a local anesthetic for the procedure,
expected to take about an hour.
   Bush joked about the operation at a picture-taking session in
the Oval Office, telling reporters, ``I have to have this finger
operated on. We're making a federal case out of it.''
   The cyst, on the end of his middle finger just below the nail,
has bothered the president for about three years ``and it simply
has reached the point where it has gotten larger and noticeable in
daily activities,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``It's not really painful but it's a nuisance,'' the spokesman
said.
   Fitzwater said that, in medical termonology, Bush will have a
mycoid cyst removed from the ``distal interphalangeal joint space''
of the finger.
   He will undergo a local anesthetic called a digital nerve block
and ``will remain awake throughout the one-hour procedure,''
Fitzwater said.
   The surgery will be performed by the top hand specialists from
Walter Reed and Georgetown University Hospital, the spokesman said.
   ``The doctors' clinical observation indicates that the cyst is
benign. There will of course be a routine pathalogic examination of
the tissue,'' he said.
   Asked by photographers during a picture-taking session with
Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi to show his injured finger, Bush
said: ``Don't tempt me.'' But then he pointed his finger downward
to show the cyst.
   ``I will show you my scar afterwards,'' he said.
   Asked if it would keep him from attending a World Series game,
the president said, ``No, no, life goes on. I will continue through
this awesome burden, continue what I'm doing.''
   The last time Bush was in the hospital was May 10 when he
underwent a routine physical examination. At that time, the cyst
was drained and doctors said it had been present for many years and
did not present a medical problem.
   In 1986, the president had a basal cell skin cancer removed from
his face. The same year, he had a small, non-cancerous polyp
removed from his colon.
   Fitzwater said Bush would spend two or three hours at Walter
Reed, and then fly in the early afternoon to the presidential
retreat at Camp David, Md., for the weekend.
   He said that removing the cyst would require stitches in Bush's
finger.

   Israel's decision-making Inner Cabinet today
debated an Egyptian proposal for peace talks with Palestinians but
took no action.
   Members of the left-leaning Labor Party headed by Vice Premier
Shimon Peres proposed accepting Egypt's suggestions, Israel Army
radio reported. But ministers of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc reportedly objected. Shamir was expected to
resume the debate Friday.
   Meanwhile, Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
began a two-day general strike today in solidarity with Arabs
refusing to pay taxes as part of their nearly 22-month-old
rebellion against Israeli rule.
   Soldiers shot to death a 20-year-old protester during a clash
with Palestinian stone- and bottle-throwers, the army said. Four
youths were reported wounded in separate incidents in the occupied
lands.
   Arab reports said a 55-year-old Arab man was found stabbed to
death in Gaza City, and slogans spray-painted on walls nearby
accused him of collaborating with Israel.
   The fatalities raised to 584 the number of Palestinians who have
been killed by Israelis during the uprising, and to 127 the number
of Arabs killed by Palestinians as suspected collaborators with
Israel.
   The six-hour Cabinet session reportedly centered on a proposal
by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker to host talks between
Israel and Egypt over the composition of a Palestinian delegation
for peace negotiations.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak wants negotiations held in
Cairo.
   Baker's idea was raised by Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of
Likud, who returned Wednesday after holding a series of meetings
with U.S. and Egyptian leaders in New York and Washington.
   Arens reportedly recommended that the Cabinet support Baker's
idea, but the meeting broke up after he met stiff opposition from
Likud hard-liners, led by Industry Minister Ariel Sharon.
   Sharon was quoted as demanding that Arens show the ministers the
minutes of his meeting with Baker, and Labor ministers then
recommended they recess until Friday for Arens to bring the notes.
   The Labor ministers reportedly presented a proposal they drew up
Wednesday night to adopt Mubarak's call for Israeli-Palestinian
talks.
   The Egyptian ambassador to Israel, Mohammed Bassiouny, said
today that an Egyptian-Israeli summit would depend on Israel's
acceptance of participation by Palestinians deported from the West
Bank and Gaza by Israel or other former residents of the
territories.
   ``Without Palestinians from outside, it will never work,''
Bassiouny told The Associated Press.
   Egypt was offering to negotiate with Israel and the United
States on the principles of who should be included in the
Palestinian delegation, not on the specific delegates, which was
the responsibility of the PLO, Bassiouny said.
   Likud leaders opposed that.
   ``The Egyptian plan in its current version speaks of leading us
into talks with a PLO delegation so it must be rejected,''
Transport Minister Moshe Katsav of Likud said on Israel radio,
during a break in the meeting.
   Israel says the Palestine Liberation Organization is a terrorist
organization and refuses to negotiate with it.
   Yossi Ahimier, spokesman for Shamir, said the Likud ministers
united behind a Shamir proposal to refuse any contacts with the PLO.
   He added that Likud members ``accept it generally that the prime
minister will be in contact with the Americans and will hear their
proposals and we will judge later on what is good for us, what we
can adopt and what not.''
   Shamir and his allies have said that they would hold talks with
a Palestinian delegation approved by Israel, but the two sides
would only discuss procedures for holding elections in the disputed
lands.
   Elections in the territories are a key element of the Israeli
government peace initiative announced in April.
   The vote is meant to choose representatives to negotiate with
Israel on an interim five-year period of self-rule for 1.7 million
Palestinians who live in these lands. The final status of the
territories would be decided later.

   Soviet troops in Armenia have begun restoring rail
shipments of food, fuel and other basic goods that were cut off for
two months by striking Azerbaijani rail workers, a news agency said
today.
   The troops were sent to the Armenian capital, Yerevan, after the
Supreme Soviet legislature on Tuesday ordered the ministries of
defense and interior to restore rail traffic between the two
feuding Transcaucasian republics.
   The troops began arriving Wednesday night, Avel Pogosyan, an
editor at the Armenpress news agency in Yerevan, said in a
telephone interview. Trains were moving today.
   Striking rail workers in Azerbaijan, motivated by ethnic
demands, imposed a virtual economic blockade of Armenia by blocking
rail lines and sabotaging cargo, news reports said. Armenia depends
heavily on trains for its supplies.
   ``In August and September, 32,000 rail cars with food, fuel and
construction materials failed to reach Armenia from Azerbaijan due
to sabotage,'' Moscow radio said. In Azerbaijan, ``bridges were
burned and trains were attacked with fire'' to prevent them from
reaching Armenia.
   As a result of the blockade and sabotage, workers in Armenia
attempting to rebuild housing demolished by December's devastating
earthquake do not have fuel and supplies to continue, the newspaper
Socialist Industry said.
   ``Thousands of tons of fuel have not been delivered and as a
result, even emergency aid vehicles cannot be filled with fuel,''
the newspaper said. ``As winter approaches, restoration plans are
not being fulfilled and foreign specialists are leaving
construction sites.''
   The newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted Azerbaijani deputy
prosecutor R. Safarliev as saying the strike was in retaliation for
Armenian sabotage of Azerbaijan railroads in July and August.
   ``This actually provoked the strike by railroad workers ... and
the blockade itself,'' Safaraliev said. However, he added, ``I want
to emphasize that these measures cannot be justified.''
   The Supreme Soviet voted 364-6 to adopt an emergency resolution
giving the military and police authority to maintain railroad
security in the Transcaucasus. The measure was weaker than one
favored by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who wanted to ban all
strikes in the nation for the next 15 months.
   Radio Moscow said military and police would be assigned to
protect certain sections of the main rail lines between the two
republics, locked in a bitter dispute over the Armenian enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh inside Azerbaijan.
   Control over Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave of mostly Christian
Armenians situated inside Moslem-dominated Azerbaijan, is the focal
point of the dispute that has claimed 117 lives since violence
began 19 months ago.

<HEAD>Pope Calls for Immediate Legalization of Ukrainian Church</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two months before his first meeting with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Pope John Paul II today urged
Soviet authorities to grant immediate legal status to the
long-suppressed Ukrainian Catholic Church.
   John Paul said the church had been ``forced into the catacombs''
more than 40 years ago and that he hears ``with ever greater
urgency and frequency'' the cry of Ukrainian Catholics seeking the
right to pray in public.
   ``The readiness and good will of the authorities must be brought
to bear so that ... they may, after decades of neglect, solve the
problem of the recognition of the rights of the Ukrainian Catholic
Church.''
   ``The Holy See expresses the hope that ... competent authorities
will proceed without delay to the recognition of the rights of your
church,'' the pope said.
   John Paul said the terms of the human rights document approved
in January at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe
should also be applied to the Ukrainian church.
   He specifically called for free access to places of worship, the
right of the church to organize its own hierarchy and the
possibility of maintaining free contact with the faithful at home
and abroad.
   John Paul said continued suppression of the Ukrainian church
contradicts programs of political and economic reform under way in
the Soviet Union.
   ``The campaign of hostility and accusations against this church
and her pastors does not help reforms,'' he said. ``On the
contrary, it hinders them. Without the legalization of the
Ukrainian community, the process of democratization will never be
complete.''
   The Ukrainian Church was forcibly merged with the Russian
Orthodox Church under Soviet dicator Josef Stalin in 1946. The pope
noted that churches and monasteries were closed, and some bishops
and priests were killed, deported or arrested.
   But the Eastern rite church has flourished underground and today
counts 2 million to 4 million followers. Ukrainian Catholics have
rallied in recent weeks to demand legalization of the church.
   The pope is expected to raise the Ukrainian issue with Gorbachev
during his Nov. 29-Dec. 1 visit to Italy. It would be the first
meeting between a pope and a supreme Kremlin leader.
   In another sign of improved relations with the East bloc, the
pope today accepted the credentials of Poland's first ambassador to
the Holy See in more than 40 years.
   The Vatican in July restored full diplomatic relations with
Poland, a first for a Warsaw Pact country. Relations had been cut
by the Communists who took power in Poland in 1945.

   The Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual and
political leader of Tibet, won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize today for
his non-violent struggle to free his Himalayan nation from Chinese
rule.
   The Norwegian Nobel Committee praised the Dalai Lama's message
of universal reverence and respect for all living things. China
condemned the selection.
   Though he preached peace, his followers repeatedly joined bloody
clashes with Chinese authorities in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, in
the last two years.
   ``I very much appreciate that kind of recognition about my
beliefs,'' the exiled Tibetan monk said in Newport Beach, Calif.,
where he is visiting. ``In fact, I always believed in love,
compassion and a sense of universal respect. Every human being has
that potential.''
   The chairman of the Norweigan Nobel Committee, Egil Aarvik, said
the selection of the Buddhist monk could also be seen as a signal
of encouragement for the pro-democracy movement in China itself,
which was crushed in June.
   ``The committee wouldn't have anything against them interpreting
it like that,'' Aarvik said after reading the citation to reporters.
   ``If I was a Chinese student, I would be fully in support of the
decision,'' he said, referring to the students who led the
pro-democracy movement that was violently suppressed in Beijing in
June 3-4.
   The Chinese Embassy in Oslo denounced the Nobel committee
decision as interfering in China's internal affairs and called the
Dalai Lama a political figure intent on ``splitting the
fatherland.''
   Embassy official Wang Guisheng was quoted by the national NTB
news agency as saying, ``This has hurt the Chinese people's
feelings,'' and he reiterated the claim that Tibet was always an
integral part of China.
   Tibet was independent from 1911 until the new Communist
authorities in China regained control in 1950.
   The Dalai Lama, born Tenzin Gyatso in 1935, had been nominated
for the coveted Nobel Peace Prize for at least the last three
years, NTB reported.
   In March, Chinese troops imposed martial law in Tibet following
widespread rioting to protest the Chinese occupation. In 1987, 38
people were reported killed in fighting in Lhasa. More
demonstrations have been reported since.
   In Dharmsala, India, where the Dalai Lama now lives, Tibetans
danced and sang in the streets to celebrate. Shops closed and
excited people rushed out, singing folk songs in praise of their
leader.
   Kjeld Vibe, ambassador from Norway, went to congratulate the
Dalai Lama at the exclusive estate of ketchup scion Clifford Heinz
early today. The Dalai Lama has been staying at the Newport Beach
home while attending a conference in southern California.
   ``My case is nothing special. I am a simple Buddist Monk _ no
more, no less,'' he told Vibe.
   The religious leader, dressed in red and orange robes and
wearing sandals, said he hopes the Nobel Prize will focus attention
on compassion in every human being.
   ``This prize may open in more people's eyes to look at their own
quality,'' the soft-spoken Dalai Lama said.
   The religious leader said he would like to go to Oslo for
presentation of the Nobel Prize on Dec. 10.
   Last year, the Dalai Lama proposed a compromise for ending
China's occupation of Tibet, offering to keep it as an autonomous
Chinese territory and to relinquish control of foreign affairs to
Beijing.
   China's government said in August that its door is always open
to talks with the Dalai Lama but that he must renounce Tibetan
independence. China stressed it would talk to him only as an
individual, not as a representative of the Tibetan government in
exile, which China has never recognized.
   The Dalai Lama's persistent campaign to free Tibet has sometimes
embarrassed countries he visited that hoped to improve ties with
Beijing, including Norway.
   During a visit in September 1988, appointments with several
Norwegian officials were canceled without explanation. The Chinese
Embassy reportedly had protested the visit to the government.
   The committee said: ``The Dalai Lama in his struggle for the
liberation of Tibet consistently has opposed the use of violence.
He has instead advocated peaceful solutions based upon tolerance
and mutual respect in order to preserve the historical and cultural
heritage of his people.''
   Ninety people and organizations were nominated for this year's
prize, which carries a cash award of 3 million Swedish kronor, or
$469,000.
   The 14th Dalai Lama was chosen when he was 5 years old as the
reincarnation of Tibet's god-king, making him both the religious
and political leader of the isolated mountain kingdom until the
1950 Chinese takeover.
   A revolt occurred in 1956 and sporadic fighting continued for
years. The Dalai Lama and 100,000 of his supporters fled Tibet in
1959 and established a government-in-exile in Dharamsala, India, in
the foothills of the Himalayas.
   In recent years, he has offered to relinquish any political role
for himself in Tibet, saying he preferred to see a democratic
government while he led simple life of a Buddhist monk.
   ``Let the young, intelligent Tibetans carry the responsibility
for leading the government,'' he said last year during a visit to
Stockholm, Sweden.
   Lhasa remains under martial law and Tibet is closed to foreign
reporters.
   Tibetan hostility to Chinese rule shows no signs of abating.
Chinese who have been in Lhasa recently report random attacks on
Chinese on the street.
   Committee sources confirmed that two Czechoslovak dissidents,
playwright Vaclav Havel and Jiri Hajek, were among the candidates
for the Nobel Peace Prize. Other contenders included South African
black leader Nelson Mandela, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and former President Reagan for their disarmament efforts.
   The prize was established by dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel to
reward the person who has worked hardest for ``fraternity among
peoples,'' disarmament or promoting peace conferences.
   In 1986, the winner was author and Holocaust survivor Elie
Wiesel. The 1987 award went to Costa Rican President Oscar Arias
for his Central American peace plan. Last year's prize went to the
U.N. peacekeeping forces.

   President Bush assured Angolan rebel leader
Jonas Savimbi today that the United States supports his staying in
power despite calls for his exile by other African leaders.
   Bush, who has been seeking to settle a dispute between Savimbi
and Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko, met with the Angolan leader
for 30 minutes in the Oval Office.
   ``I consider my visit here a success,'' Savimbi told reporters.
He said Bush assured him of continued U.S. support and that the
administration ``does not accept the conceptions of exile,'' which
Mobutu advocates.
   U.S. officials said earlier that Bush would ask Savimbi, chief
of the Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA, to
settle his differences with Mobutu in an effort to salvage the
faltering accord reached through Zaire's mediation to end the
14-year civil war in Angola.
   ``First of all he will reassure him of our support. And he will
urge him to work with Mobutu and all the parties involved,'' said
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Bush delivered a similar message to Mobutu at a 30-minute Oval
Office meeting Wednesday convened at White House insistence. Mobutu
flew to Washington in the morning and returned immediately to New
York to address the U.N. General Assembly.
   ``The president reiterated the strong U.S. support for UNITA and
our appreciation of President Mobutu's efforts to try to help bring
about national reconciliation in Angola,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``The president urged President Mobutu to work out any
differences which he might have with UNITA so that the goal of
national reconciliation can be met,'' he added.
   The spokesman declined to discuss claims by conservative Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., that Mobutu had stopped shipping U.S.-supplied
arms to UNITA to pressure Savimbi into accepting the Angolan
government's peace terms. Angolan Foreign Minister Pedro van Dunem
made a similar claim at a meeting with reporters Wednesday, saying
Mobutu said he had stopped the shipments in keeping with his role
as a neutral mediator.
   UNITA is one of the largest recipients of covert U.S. military
aid, estimated at more than $40 million annually. The arms are
delivered mainly through Zaire, which was on good terms with
Savimbi until Mobutu began supporting the Angolan government's
views of the cease-fire accords reached in June at Gbadolite, Zaire.
   The United States is conducting intensive, behind-the-scenes
efforts to avert the collapse of the cease-fire agreement that has
already been violated numerous times by both sides. The two sides
have refused to negotiate face-to-face on restoring the cease-fire
and discussing permanent peace accords.
   Savimbi said Wednesday he would present Bush with a new
cease-fire agreement that would put the negotiations with the
Soviet-backed Angolan government back on track.
   Although Mobutu, Savimbi and van Dunem were all in town
Wednesday, they did not meet each other. Savimbi and van Dunem took
their case to members of Congress and the media, each accusing the
other of reneging on the Gbadolite accords.
   ``Savimbi is not willing really to commit himself to a process
of peace,'' van Dunem said.
   At issue is the question of what happened at a closed-door
meeting between Savimbi and Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos at
the Gbadolite summit.
   Mobutu supports dos Santos' version of events _ that Savimbi
promised he would go into temporary exile and integrate his forces
into the Angolan army.
   Savimbi denies it. ``Why should I do that? We haven't been
defeated,'' he told reporters Wednesday.
   The United States backs his position, which calls for a
cease-fire followed by free multiparty elections. Angola contends
free elections can only be held after UNITA is integrated into the
Angolan military and peace is consolidated.
   ``A multiparty system now is unthinkable,'' Savimbi said.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh today blamed
his difficulty finding a civil rights chief on the Senate Judiciary
Committee's rejection of his original choice, William Lucas.
   ``Once burned, twice shy,'' Thornburgh said. ``We saw someone I
felt was an appropriate candidate roughed up pretty badly in the
Judiciary Committee. Frankly, that has scared off some people who
might otherwise be interested.''
   Thornburgh said he is still looking for a candidate two months
after the Senate Judiciary Committee, on a pair of tie votes,
rejected Lucas' nomination to be assistant attorney general for
civil rights.
   ``We are anxious to get someone nominated and confirmed. It's
just on the basis of recent experience it's going to be a little
bit challenging,'' Thornburgh told reporters.
   The difficulty was signaled Wednesday when Thornburgh's
spokesman, David Runkel, said, ``we don't have a short list of
candidates. The last guy who was nominated for that position took a
few knocks. There are not a lot of people volunteering.''
   The delay raises the possibility that President Bush will not
submit a new name to the Senate before Congress adjourns later this
fall.
   ``It's not an easy position to fill and part of the reason was
the way Bill Lucas was treated,'' Runkel said.
   Lucas, a black Republican who was sheriff and later chief
executive of the Michigan county that includes Detroit, encountered
sharp criticism of his professional qualifications and his lack of
civil rights experience during Senate confirmation hearings.
   Opponents noted Lucas is a lawyer who has never tried a court
case. During questioning, Lucas appeared to have trouble discussing
some of the finer legal points of civil rights, confessing at one
point he was ``new to the law.''
   Several senators expressed dismay over Lucas' defense of a
series of Supreme Court decisions on employment discrimination that
civil rights attorneys contend will make it harder to win lawsuits.
   Thornburgh blamed Lucas' rejection on ``raw politics'' and
accused the panel of applying a ``litmus test'' that required Lucas
to criticize the Supreme Court cases.
   Lucas was quickly appointed to head the Justice Department's
Office of Liaison Services, where he deals with the same civil
rights groups that opposed his nomination to be assistant attorney
general.
   Since Lucas' rejection, about a half-dozen people have been
interviewed by the Justice Department, which recommends a candidate
to the White House, Runkel said. He offered no response when asked
if anyone had turned the job down.
   No names have been submitted to the FBI for a background check,
which is a part of the screening process before any nominee's name
is sent to the Senate, Runkel said.
   Washington civil rights lawyer William Taylor rejected Runkel's
argument that Lucas' experience before the Senate Judiciary
Committee discouraged other candidates.
   ``I couldn't accept the notion that Lucas' demise in the
committee makes it difficult to fill the job,'' said Taylor, who
spoke against the nomination. ``There are hundreds of lawyers with
civil rights experience in the country who would not have any
difficulty passing muster with the committee.''
   Acting Assistant Attorney General James Turner is heading the
civil rights division in the interim.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega said
today that he urged rebel troops to release him and abandon their
coup, telling them to surrender ``or we're all going to die right
here.''
   Loyalist troops killed 10 rebels and arrested dozens of top
officers and soldiers while crushing the attempt to topple Noriega,
who was help prisoner for several hours on Tuesday, the military
said.
   An overnight curfew kept the streets of Panama City quiet for
the second day in a row today.
   A ``war communique'' said all but one of those killed were
officers and that 25 people were wounded. The casualty list
released Wednesday night was the first issued by the government
since the attempted coup.
   The communique said security forces arrested three members of
the High Command and about 35 other officers and soldiers. The
arrests of men supposedly among Noriega's most trusted aides
suggested the revolt may have had wider support than originally
thought.
   There were indications the coup attempt also came closer to
toppling the Defense Forces chief and Panama's de facto leader than
first believed.
   A Defense Forces officer said the plotters succeeded in
capturing Noriega and holding him for four or five hours at Defense
Forces headquarters. A lawyer for Noriega initially had denied that
the general was taken captive.
   ``The surrender came when loyal officers took command of the
combat units and gave the rebels a last chance to release the
commander and members of his staff or face the consequences,'' said
Lt. Col. Arnulfo Castrejon, director of the Defense Forces Security
and Defense Committee.
   One Defense Forces source, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the rebels had wanted to take Noriega alive, which gave him
time to take shelter in a bunker inside the compound and call for
help by radio.
   Noriega said today on state television that he initially
resisted the rebels, but finally came out unarmed to talk with them.
   ``I told them that either they surrendered `or we're all going
to die right here,''' Noriega said. ``Their strategy was to take
control and turn over all power to the rebels (opposition).''
   ``I was unarmed during this time... I'm a man of peace. I fire
on my enemies, not against my brothers.''
   Castrejon said Noriega was held for four or five hours. It was
unclear if Noriega gained freedom before or after troops loyal to
him counterattacked the headquarters and forced the rebel surrender.
   Noriega ``had tried to calm his captors during the time he was
held, trying to avoid a bloodshed,'' Castrejon said.
   The rebels rejected a U.S. offer to take Noriega out of the
country, saying they wanted to retire him, Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney said today on ``CBS This Morning.''
   ``We were not given the opportunity to take him off their hands.
We would have been happy to do so had that been an option, but they
clearly were not of a mind to have that happen,'' Cheney said.
   In Washington, President Bush came under mounting criticism
about the passive role played by U.S. troops, who stood fully armed
a few hundred yards away and watched the rebellion fail.
   The United States has been trying to topple Noriega since he was
indicted on U.S. drug trafficking charges in February 1988, but the
Bush administration said it had no role in the coup attempt.
   ``I'm afraid it's a matter of cold feet. It was a conscious
decision not to assist,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo. ``I'm
furious about it.''
   ``It raises questions whether people down there can ever have
confidence in the United States,'' said Rep. William Broomfield,
R-Mich., the senior minority member of the House Foreign Relations
Committee.
   Members of the civilian opposition in Panama noted that the
group that staged the coup attempt did not back democratic reform.
   ``Their communique indicated they wanted Noriega out and
supported the provisional government that Noriega set up,'' said
Ricardo Arias Calderon, an opposition vice presidential candidate
in May 7 elections that Noriega annulled after international
observers said his candidates had lost by a landslide.
   Despite that, Noriega continued to blame the United States for
his troubles. Noriega says it is all part of a U.S. plot to hold
onto the Panama Canal, due to become Panama's at the end of the
century.
   ``The gringo piranhas want to do away with me,'' the general
said Wednesday during a brief tour of the street outside his
headquarters.
   The ``war communique'' only listed those arrested, wounded or
killed during the coup. It did not give any specific reason for the
arrests of Col. Guillermo Wong, the head of state security, and two
other members of the 20-member High Command, the Panamanian
equivalent of a general staff.
   Defense Forces spokesmen were not available for comment on the
arrests, according to people who answered phones at headquarters.
   Among those killed was Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega, leader of the
Urraca battalion that launched the uprising, the ``war communique''
said. No dead were listed as belonging to loyalist forces.
   Of the wounded, 18 were from forces loyal to Noriega, three from
the rebel forces and five civilians, the communique said.
   The communique also said five coup leaders had taken refuge at
Fort Clayton, a U.S. base a few miles from Panama City. U.S.
officials refused comment on that report.
   As reports of Noriega's narrow escape circulated, the general
appeared to be enjoying himself when he appeared at a window in his
headquarters to receive the cheers of several thousand supporters,
most of them government workers.
   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity in
Washington, said they were mystified by the rebels' apparent
decision to let Noriega go.
   ``It's crazy. I don't understand it,'' said one U.S. official.

   The Senate today approved a ban on burning or
otherwise defacing the American flag but added a
Republican-sponsored change that Democrats said could make the bill
vulnerable in any future court challenge.
   The ban, previously approved by the House, cleared the Senate,
91-9. It was returned to the defense and we never saw it,'' said jury foreman
Ricky Hill.
   ``His testimony did not weigh on me one bit,'' the foreman said
``I believe he began in earnest. He was called by God. But
eventually the money became too much for him.''
   ``He was a man of God,'' Hill added. ``He got corrupt and I feel
sorry for the man.''
   As they awaited the verdict in the courtroom, several Bakker
supporters held Bibles opened to Psalm 17, which reads: ``Thou hast
tried me, and shalt find nothing.''
   Prosecutors contend Bakker raised $158 million by selling
``lifetime partnerships'' at his Heritage USA retreat near Fort
Mill, S.C., but used the money for projects other than the lodging
he promised. Partners typically paid $1,000 for the promise of
three nights' lodging annually at the theme park.
   Bakker resigned from the ministry in 1987 in a sex and money
scandal.
   ``You can't lie to people to send you money _ it's that
simple,'' prosecutor Deborah Smith told the jury.
   ``You can't tell half-truths. If you do it, if you use the
Postal Service and the public airwaves you will find yourself in
federal court answering charges of mail and wire fraud. That's why
we're here today, because that's just what Mr. Bakker did.''
   Bakker's attorneys said he was a devout man of God.
   ``The government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
defendant had specific intent to commit fraud,'' said attorney
George Davis. ``He was conducting a ministry. He was doing what he
thought was vital to the survival of his ministry.''

   The Senate today approved a ban on burning or
otherwise defacing the American flag but added a
Republican-sponsored change that Democrats said could make the bill
vulnerable in any future court challenge.
   The ban, previously approved by the House, cleared the Senate,
91-9. It was returned to the House for consideration of changes
made by the Senate.
   Key votes came on two GOP-sponsored changes in wording that
Democrats said would skew careful phrasing that was designed to
beat back expected court challenges to the bill's constitutionality.
   Republican critics say the bill already is likely to fail such a
court test. They call for a constitutional amendment as urged by
President Bush after the Supreme Court in June overturned the
criminal conviction on Texas flag-burner Gregory Lee Johnson on the
ground his freedom of speech had been violated.
   The ruling resulted in a public reaction that fueled
congressional action.
   The skirmishing on the Senate floor, however, was between
Democrats seeking to push through their bill through and
Republicans hoping replace it with the proposed amendment. That
measure comes up later this month.
   In rapid succession, the Senate first refused, 69-31, to kill an
amendment offered by Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., that would make it
a crime to ``physically defile'' the flag. It then adopted by a
wide margin Wilson's measure, which Democratic sponsors said would
nudge the bill toward constitutional problems on free-speech
grounds.
   The Senate then voted, 53-47, to kill a proposal by Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., to exempt flag defacement that took place
in private. Sponsors also said that could make the measure
vulnerable.
   Those voting against the final bill were Dole and Sens. John H.
Chaffee, R-R.I.; Charles Grassley, R-Iowa; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah;
Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.; Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; Bob Kerrey,
D-Neb.; Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   The bill calls for up to a $1,000 fine and year in jail for
anyone who burns and American flag or defaces it in any one of
several other ways.
   Federal law already bans flag burning, but senators say the law
contains constitutional pitfalls similar to the ones in the Texas
statute.
   Conservative Republicans urge the amendment on grounds that it
would settle the issue once and for all _ it could not be
challenged in court.
   Many Democrats retort that amending the Constitution should be
only a last resort and that one act of burning is no cause to limit
the freedom of speech.
   ``Of all things, today in the United States of America we need
to encourage our people to be less afraid, speaking what they
believe, letting their hearts and minds give rise to what they
truly think ought to be done,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.
   Proponents of a constitutional amendment, however, scoff at the
notion that any statute can be drawn that would survive a court
challenge on freedom of speech grounds.
   ``The statutory approach in my opinion is a futile and
ineffective gesture which will not pass the constitutional test at
all,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   Some senators say they detect a distinct cooling of the issue in
the months since the Supreme Court ruling.
   ``There's no grass roots firestorm for jailing flag burners nor
for amending the Constitution,'' said Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio.
   But Metzenbaum said enough passion remains that lawmakers are
wary of opposing a ban.
   ``I think that some of us are afraid to stand up for our
principles ... afraid the people won't understand that,'' he said.
``I think we're afraid that our opponents in the next election will
be even less understanding.''
   He and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said they would oppose
both the bill and the constitutional amendment, saying either would
take away rights.
   ``Patriotism is not the issue,'' Kennedy said. ``Free speech
is.''
   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., was among lawmakers who planned to
vote for both the bill and the amendment.
   ``The flag represents the very heart of what it means to be an
American and it would be a tragedy for us to let its power be
undermined through legal desecration,'' Heflin said.

<HEAD>Researchers Reach Record Low Temperature</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have pushed down
temperatures to a record low of only two billionths of a degree
above absolute zero, the Low Temperature Laboratory at the Helsinki
University of Technology said Thursday.
   Absolute zero, minus 459.67 Fahrenheit, is unattainable
according to the laws of physics, scientists say.
   Two billionths of a degree corresponds to two nanokelvins (nK).
The previous record of 30 nK, which is in the Guinness Book of
World Records, was set by the same laboratory in 1984, said
professor Olli Lounasmaa, head of the research team.
   ``The new record was not an aim in itself but a side product of
the research we are engaged in. Our main aim is to study the state
of matter as close to absolute zero as possible,'' Lounasmaa said.
   The experiment was conducted in a nuclear demagnetization device
by Dr. Pertti Hakonen from the Helsinki University of Technology
and Dr. Shi Yin from Michigan State University.
   The record low temperature was reached in the atomic nuclei of a
one-gram silver specimen. The previous record was set by using a
copper specimen, Lounasmaa said.
   The new mark appears to be a record for the cooling of the
nuclei, or cores, of atoms in a solid, said Robert Richardson of
Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. That is different from chilling
an entire chunk of material, and the record for that mark is 10,000
times warmer, he said.
   Experiments at extremely low temperatures ``enable us to study
atoms more individually,'' Lounasmaa said. ``The experiment may
also have some future practical applications, but above all, it
will give us new knowledge about the state of matter.''
   Low temperature research already is being used in, for instance,
the study of signals in the human brain.

<TEXT>
   Architects are sorting through more than
1,200 design proposals submitted by people vying for the chance to
see their plan used in construction of a new museum near the
Acropolis.
   A member of the committee overseeing the international design
competition said Thursday that 1,270 plans from architects
throughout the world were received by the July 15 deadline.
   The competition was announced in May by Greek actress Melina
Mercouri, who was minister of culture at the time.
   After suffering centuries of fire, war and earthquakes, the
ancient white marble treasures on the Acropolis began succumbing
slowly to pollution. Many of the sculptures had been removed and
placed in a small building nearby.
   The decision to build a new museum was made after the existing
small building became too crowded.
   Some of the Acropolis' best treasures were removed from the
Parthenon temple in the early 19th century by British diplomat,
Lord Elgin, who shipped them to London.
   Ms. Mercouri, who has made a plea for the return of the Elgin
marbles, said in May that she hoped they would be featured in the
new museum.
   A committee of architects is expected to choose 25 designs from
among the entries by Jan.31, 1990. From these, the committe will
select 10 plans and then choose the winner in October.
   The cost of the 49,500-square-foot museum is estimated at $30
million, and $530,000 has been donated so far.
   The European Community is expected to make a contribution toward
the construction when the final architectural design is approved.

   The government Thursday refused to
grant an export permit for an Australian painting that sold at
auction to an American for $1.4 million, the highest price ever
paid for an Australian artwork.
   Arts Minister Clyde Holding ordered the painting, ``The Bath of
Diana'' by John Glover, to remain in Australia under the Protection
of Movable Cultural Heritage Act.
   The 1937 painting was sold to an American citizen at auction in
April. The buyer was not identified.
   The painting is based on the myth of Diana and Actaeon and
symbolizes Tasmanian Aborigines living in an idyllic state on the
eve of the destruction of their society by the arrival of Europeans.
   Holding said he accepted advice from the National Cultural
Heritage Committee, which said exporting the painting would greatly
diminish the cultural heritage of Australia.
   It is the first time the Cultural Heritage Act of 1986 has been
invoked.

<HEAD>Pressure Builds On Aquino To Allow Marcos Burial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pressure is building on President
Corazon Aquino to allow Ferdinand Marcos to be buried here, and
some analysts believe the president is in a no-win situation.
   Pressure to lift the ban on returning Marcos' body from Hawaii,
where he died Sept. 28, has come not only from avowed supporters of
the late president but also from some of Mrs. Aquino's supporters.
   Several said that if Mrs. Aquino holds fast, the standoff will
continue. If she relents, she will appear indecisive.
   ``I must say, in spite of the fact that I am a member of the
ruling coalition, as a Filipino the inclination should be in favor
of the right of Mr. Marcos to be buried in his homeland,'' said
Sen. Aquilino Pimentel, one of Mrs. Aquino's campaign managers in
the 1986 election.
   Mrs. Aquino banned the body because of fears of unrest by Marcos
supporters. On Wednesday, the Cabinet endorsed the decision after
hearing reports of alleged threats against the government.
   In the only public opinion poll since Marcos' death, 69 percent
of the 950 Manila residents surveyed supported allowing the former
president's body to be buried here.
   The survey was conducted between Sept. 30 and Oct. 4 by Vox
Populi, a research firm, under commission by Vice President
Salvador Laurel. Laurel supports the body's return.
   Seven of the government's 23 senators have called publicly for
the return of the body. Before Marcos died, 103 of the 199 members
of the House of Representatives signed a petition urging the ailing
Marcos be allowed to come home to die.
   This week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a motion to overturn
the Marcos ban.
   There are clear signs mainstream politicians sense the public's
sympathy for allowing a former president to be buried in the land
he once ruled.
   Sen. Leticia Ramos-Shahani, chairwoman of the Senate Foreign
Affairs Committee and sister of Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos,
urged Mrs. Aquino to begin talks with the Marcos family on
conditions for the body's return.
   Mrs. Ramos-Shahani, a Marcos cousin and Aquino supporter,
suggested Marcos' body be flown to his home province of Ilocos
Norte, 250 miles north of Manila, and buried quietly there.
   On Tuesday, the Manila City Council adopted a resolution asking
Mrs. Aquino to lift the ban in the interest of ``total
reconciliation and national unity.''
   The moderator of the popular television public affairs show
``Viewpoint'' asked his audience Tuesday night to telephone their
opinions on the issue.
   The moderator, Ricardo Puno, said 61 percent of the callers
supported allowing Marcos a burial in his homeland. He did not say
how many people called.
   ``President Aquino is losing touch with the public pulse,''
wrote columnist Alvin Carpio in the Philippine Daily Globe. ``She
may not realize it, but she is playing right into the hands of the
opposition, which cannot be blamed for exploiting a popular cause.''
   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa claims troops could
handle any serious threat to stability. But Mrs. Aquino has said
any disorder could discourage vital foreign investment.
   Financial analysts believe the uncertainty over the burial will
discourage investors until the issue is resolved.
   ``Unless this thing is plugged, we can see more cautiousness in
the market,'' said Vincent Yanwaria, a research analyst at Citicorp
Scrimgeour Vickers, a brokerage firm.
   Since his death, pro-Marcos demonstrations have been small and
peaceful. Critics claim Mrs. Aquino has either overreacted or is
motivated by vindictiveness.
   Mrs. Aquino's husband, Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr., was imprisoned
for seven years by Marcos until he was allowed to leave for the
United States. He was assassinated at Manila's airport on Aug. 21,
1983, as he stopped off a plane upon returning to challenge Marcos.

<HEAD>Newspaper Accuses Iran of Occupying Iraqi Embassy in Tehran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq on Thursday said Iranian Revolutionary
Guards have occupied the Iraqi ambassador's residence in Tehran and
built a school in the garden. It threatened to retaliate.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted Information Minister Latif
Nissayef Jassim as saying the vacant embassy was taken over Aug. 23.
   The Al Thawra newspaper of Iraq's ruling Baath party said if the
premises were not evacuated, Iraq would retaliate against the
residence of the Iranian ambassador in Baghdad. It did not
elaborate.
   The daily newspaper, which reflects government policy, reported
that the Revolutionary Guards also looted the residence and seized
a diplomatic car that was left there.
   Iraq and Iran went to war in September 1980. Turkey has
represented the two countries in each other's capitals.
   Jassim said Iraq had requested that Turkey intervene to evict
the Revolutionary Guards, but Al Thawra said there had not been a
response.
   The Turkish Embassy in Baghdad refused comment on the situation.
   Al Thawra said Iraq considered the incident ``irrational and
dangerous behavior which contradicts all diplomatic norms and
aggreements.''
   ``This act of aggression is clear evidence that the rulers in
Tehran have not given up their old policies of aggression,'' the
newspaper said.
   Iraq and Iran ceased hostilities on Aug. 20, 1988 with a
U.N.-sponsored cease-fire. Talks on a final peace settlement have
been stalemated.

   The Dalai Lama, winner of the 1989 Nobel
Peace Prize for his non-violent quest to free Tibet from Chinese
rule, combines the piety of a simple priest with the pragmatism of
a politician.
   Three decades after he fled his palace in the Tibetan capital,
Lhasa, the Buddhist spiritual leader has lived in exile in India
and travels the world to assert the cause of his people.
   When news of the Nobel award was released in Oslo, Norway, the
Dalai Lama was in California on one of the U.S. visits he makes at
least twice yearly to minister to Buddhist faithful and stoke
international awareness of the Tibetan struggle.
   Fearful that China's heavy-handed rule and the influx of Chinese
settlers to his ancient Himalayan homeland could soon obliterate
Tibet's language, culture and religion, he has offered a series of
concessions to Beijing.
   Fifteen months ago, he dropped his demands for full independence
for Tibet, publicly proposing for the first time that China
continue to wield responsibility for military and foreign policy in
exchange for greater Tibetan autonomy.
   So far, there have been no concessions by China. Beijing, before
becoming preoccupied with its own pro-democracy uprising, said it
was willing to discuss Tibet but would not give up its assertion
that it is an integral part of China.
   Tibetans, personified by the 54-year-old Dalai Lama, trace the
history of their homeland to the founding of a Tibetan kingdom in
127 B.C. More than a millennium later, a theocratic state emerged
through a series of Dalai Lamas.
   According to Tibetan beliefs, the first Dalai Lama, a title
meaning ``Ocean of Mercy,'' was born in 1391. After the earthly
death of each Dalai Lama, a new god-king is revealed through a
series of dreams and symbols.
   The current _ and 14th _ Dalai Lama was born June 7, 1935, one
of seven children of a poor farmer and named Tenzin Gyatso. When
Tenzin was 2, Buddhist holy men arrived in his village of Tagtser
carrying beads that had belonged to the 13th Dalai Lama. After the
little boy discerned the beads under a monk's cloak and correctly
answered a series of questions, he was declared the new Dalai Lama.
   He was taken away to study and on Nov. 17, 1950, assumed full
temporal and spiritual powers. Less than 10 months later, Chinese
troops marched into Lhasa. On March 10, 1959, Tibetans attempted to
revolt and were crushed.
   One week later, his palace surrounded by Chinese troops, the
Dalai Lama slipped out of Lhasa disguised as a Chinese soldier with
a rifle on his shoulder and fled through the snow-covered mountains
to neighboring India, where 100,000 Tibetans now live in exile.
   Today, attired in the sleeveless maroon-and-saffron robes of an
ordinary Buddhist monk, he exudes an aura of holiness and
unflinching belief in the goodness of mankind. He continued to
profess patient optimism that eventually China would negotiate on
the fate of Tibet, even when the Beijing government responded with
increasing harshness to Tibetan pro-independence demonstrations in
Lhasa.
   The crackdown on dissent in Beijing in early June, when China's
troops and tanks killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Chinese
during pro-democracy demonstrations in the capital, did not
diminish his optimism.
   The crackdown in Beijing, the Dalai Lama said July in New York,
was ``a temporary setback'' in Tibet's efforts to cast off 39 years
of Chinese occupation.
   ``Eventually things will improve,'' he said. ``The desire for
democracy and freedom are basic human desires in the human blood.''
   Though he preached peace, his followers repeatedly joined bloody
clashes with Chinese authorities in Lhasa in the last two years.
Martial law remains in the capital and travel by foreign reporters
to Tibet is forbidden.
   In addition to using armed police to put down political protest
in Lhasa, the Chinese employed less overt force by attempting to
cultivate some senior Buddhist clergy.
   The Panchen Lama, second only to the Dalai Lama in the Tibetan
religious hierarchy, remained behind in Tibet when the Dalai Lama
fled. Long viewed as little more than China's stooge, the Panchen
Lama redeemed himself in the eyes of Tibetan nationalists only a
few days before he died in January when he termed Chinese rule
``repressive.''
   In an interview with The Associated Press in March in Dharmsala,
the Indian seat of his government-in-exile, the Dalai Lama said:
``In the last 30 years they (the Chinese) have used every
repression. We lost everything in the last 30 years, but we still
remain. We are the same Tibetans the Chinese bullied 30 years ago.''
   In the English he speaks fluently, he said: ``I am quite sure:
Next five years, 10 years, more positive things will happen.''
   While young Tibetan exiles sometimes express impatience with the
government-in-exile's bureaucrats and what they see as the Dalai
Lama's political naivete, he maintains non-violence is the only
path to salvation.
   He speaks unfalteringly of his belief that there is good in all
mankind. He touches, blesses and bestows filmy white prayer scarves
on those who wait outsie his bungalow for audiences.
   Tibetan Buddhists worldwide make continual pilgrimages to his
mountaintop abode at McLeod Ganj, a ridge of dark gray stone in
Dharmsala, 300 miles north of New Delhi. Sometimes, depending on
the political winds, China grants visas to Tibetans to travel to
India to meet their leader.
   They are joined by other ``seekers,'' ranging from clean-cut and
earnest young Japanese to middle-aged Americans favoring the dress
and speech of the 1960s-style hippies _ pony-tailed backpackers who
fill Dharmsala's tea houses with murmurs of ``Man, this is heavy.''
   Dharmsala, a tortuous, 14-hour drive from New Delhi across the
plains of Punjab and up the hairpin curves into the Himalayas,
resembles a new Lhasa, complete with shaggy little Tibetan terriers
yapping in the muddy lanes between the stone houses whose
inhabitants are bundled up in coarse, hand-knitted sweaters most
months of the year.
   Outside the Buddhist temples, cylindrical brass prayer wheels
spin, turned by the breezes or the hands of the faithful in this
once mostly Hindu town.
   Inside the compound of the Dalai Lama's monastery, Tibetan monks
quiz each other on the tenets or their faith, preserving in exile
the lifestyle and religion of their homeland.

<TEXT>
   Louisiana voters get a second chance
Saturday to judge several proposals from Gov. Buddy Roemer's
sweeping tax revision package that was overwhelmingly defeated in
April.
   Voters also face amendments aimed at increasing the number of
black judges.
   In contrast to last spring's often-acid debate on the tax plan,
regarded by many as a referendum on Roemer's first year in office,
the campaign for 13 proposed constitutional changes has been low
key.
   Roemer's favorite proposition _ calling for a highway trust fund
_ is being boosted as an incentive for economic development, the
same theme voiced throughout the tax package campaign.
   Two other proposals _ a special fund to stop coastal erosion and
repeal of the $3 limit on auto license plate fees _ also are
leftovers from the fiscal package that failed April 29. Attempts to
repeal the license plate limit have been rejected by voters three
times in recent years.
   Unlike April's referendum, voters will be able to judge the
proposals separately. Voters have not approved a change in the
state's 1974 constitution since 1987.
   Secretary of State Fox McKeithen predicted Tuesday that about 35
percent of the eligible voters would participate. About 47 percent
turned out for the April vote.
   The Legislature drew up the proposed constitutional amendments
to revamp elections for state judges earlier this year following a
federal court ruling that black voting strength is illegally
diluted in district and appellate courts.
   One proposed amendment would add a Supreme Court justice and a
majority black district in the New Orleans area, while another
would create up to 35 black-majority districts for district and
appellate courts.
   Federal courts could draw up new plans if the amendments are
rejected by voters.
   Roemer, who was at the forefront of the fight for the tax
package, has remained largely on the sidelines, speaking mostly in
favor of the transportation trust fund.
   The proposed amendment would set aside the current 16-cent motor
fuel tax for public works projects, including road building.
   That would bar the Legislature from raiding funds earmarked for
highway construction, a common occurrence during the 1980s as state
revenue dropped following the collapse of oil prices. Federal
highway officials pulled $350 million of the state's highway
funding earlier this year because of poor road maintenance, but
restored the money after the Legislature approved the proposed
amendment.
   The amendment also would impose an additional 4-cent motor fuel
tax levy to fund a $1.4 billion transportation improvement program.
The program involves expansion of major highways to four lanes and
expansion of ports and the New Orleans International Airport.
   Roemer said the plan would create thousands of construction jobs
immediately, boost efforts to attract new industry to the state and
erase the state's pothole-marred roads.
   The coastal trust fund would receive at least $5 million
annually for anti-erosion projects in Louisiana's environmentally
sensitive marshlands. Erosion is blamed for the loss of 50 square
miles of marshes annually.
   A coastal trust fund was established by the Legislature earlier
this year. The proposed amendment would bar lawmakers from using
the funds for other purposes.
   ``Unless you live along the coast, you don't realize that we're
losing 50 square miles of our valuable marsh each year,'' said
state Sen. Ben Bagert, the legislative sponsor of the proposal.
``Twenty percent of this state will be gone in 50 years unless we
do something.''

   Mark Johnson was the only candidate from

   Johnson failed to get enough votes in Tuesday's primary to
appear on the November ballot, according to city attorney Mary Kahl.
   As Kahl interprets the city charter, a candidate in the primary
must win votes amounting to at least 5 percent of the total cast in
the previous general election in order to appear on the general
election ballot. But Tuesday's voter turnout was only 3 percent, so
Johnston failed to get the required support.
   Johnston said Thursday he is challenging his loss. He said

<HEAD>Reports: Government Will Free ANC Leader</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will free
jailed black leader Walter Sisulu but is irritated by Western
pressure to negotiate with his African National Congress guerrilla
movement, according to news reports Thursday.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha, as well as several pro-government
newspapers, criticized comments this week by U.S. State Department
official Herman Cohen, who said he expects the white-controlled
government to legalize outlawed groups and begin talks with them
within nine months.
   The state broadcasting company belittled a French plan to invite
South African officials and leaders of the African National
Congress to a conference in Paris.
   Sisulu, 77, the outlawed group's general secretary, was
sentenced in 1964 along with Nelson Mandela and other ANC leaders
to life in prison for plotting anti-government sabotage.
   The Citizen, a Johannesburg daily, quoted an unidentified
government source as saying the Cabinet had decided to free Sisulu
but said the source refused to give a date. The newspaper said
black activist Oscar Mpetha, 80-year-old leader of the United
Democratic Front, also was likely to be released.
   Mandela, considered by many blacks as their paramount leader, is
unlikely to be freed this year, The Citizen said.
   The Daily Mail newspaper in London quoted diplomatic sources
Wednesday as saying Sisulu and Mpetha would be freed before British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher goes to Malaysia for the annual
Commonwealth summit conference on Oct. 18. Mrs. Thatcher has been
criticized by other Commonwealth leaders for her refusal to impose
tough sanctions on South Africa.
   Despite the possibility of prisoner releases, the government has
given no sign of softening its attitude toward negotiations with
the African National Congress.
   President F.W. de Klerk, since his inauguration last month, has
reiterated that such talks cannot take place until the group
renounces the use of violence as a means to end apartheid, South
Africa's system of segregation that denies blacks a vote in
national affairs.
   Botha, in a statement Thursday, criticized remarks made in
Washington by Cohen, assistant secretary of state for African
affairs. Cohen told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he
expected South African officials to act by next June to legalize
organizations, repeal remaining segregation laws and open
negotiations with credible black leaders.
   ``South Africans should retain the right not only to create our
own constitutional future, but to do so without threats or time
limits imposed from outside,'' Botha said. ``I trust that Mr. Cohen
will also urge the perpetrators of violence to end their violent
campaign in a determined time frame.''
   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. criticized the
plan for the Paris conference, planned for November by French First
Lady Danielle Mitterand to discuss South Africa's political future.
It said such a conference would amount to no more than an attempt
to boost the African National Congress' image.
   Also Thursday, the Chamber of Mines marked its centennial by
issuing a report that depicted itself as a progressive force
working to eliminate discrimination in the mining industry.
   ``We have the opportunity in the mining industry to break down
(racial) barriers and build bridges,'' said the chamber's
president, Kenneth Maxwell.
   But the National Union of Mineworkers, which represents black
miners, said the centennial marks ``100 years of toil and poverty.''
   The chamber serves as mouthpiece, research institute and
bargaining agent for six giant corporations that control 90 percent
of South Africa's mining operations and generate more than 20
percent of the country's total wealth.

   Florida's Supreme Court today struck
down a law requiring girls to get parental consent before an
abortion, ruling it violates the right to privacy.
   The decision comes less than a week before the Legislature is to
convene in special session at Gov. Bob Martinez's request to
restrict access to abortion.
   ``We can conceive of few more personal or private decisions
concerning one's body that one can make in the course of a
lifetime,'' the court wrote.
   ``The challenged statute fails because it intrudes upon the
privacy of the pregnant minor from conception to birth.''
   The court said the state Constitution's guarantee of privacy
outweighed the 1988 law requiring consent of a parent, guardian or
judge for a girl under 18 to get an abortion.
   The decision comes in the case of 15-year-old Lake County girl
initially denied permission for an abortion by a judge. A state
appeals court later found the law unconstitutional, and the U.S.
Supreme Court refused to hear the case.
   Court records showed the teen-ager legally ended her pregnancy
while the appeal was pending. She was identified in court records
as a high school student was worried that news of an abortion would
``kill'' her ailing mother.
   The state high court said of the law: ``Such a substantial
invasion of a pregnant female's privacy by the state for the full
term of the pregnancy is not necessary for the preservation of
maternal health or the potentiality of life.''
   The Florida Constitution is one of the few in the country that
expressly and in strong terms guarantee a right to privacy, the
court said.
   Ken Connor, president of Florida Right to Life, called the
decision ``a big defeat for the unborn child.''
   Jerri A. Blair, the girl's attorney, hailed the ruling, calling
it ``a direct and very explicit endorsement of the right to
privacy. It provides extra insulation to right of choice in
Florida.''
   Four of the seven justices joined in the majority opinion, two
wrote concurring opinions, and Justice Parker McDonald wrote that
the decision goes against common law provisions that say minors do
not have the right to enter into contracts.
   In July, the U.S. Supreme Court gave states more latitude to
regulate abortions.
   The governor called a special session for Oct. 10-13 to consider
more stringent abortion laws, including mandatory testing of
fetuses at 20 weeks to determine if the fetus could live outside
the body and a ban on use of public funds, personnel or facilities
for abortions.

   A quarter century after they entertained John
F. Kennedy, the storied Scottish Black Watch band returned to the
White House on Thursday and performed for a delighted President
Bush.
   After listening to the skirl of the bagpipes and other music,
both haunting and martial, Bush inspected the troops of the massed
bands of the Black Watch and the Argyll &amp; Sutherland Highlanders,
garbed in kilts and wearing their trademark headwear, towering
black feather bonnets with a single crimson plume.
   He shook hands and offered his thanks to several of the company,
then received a gift bonnet himself.
   Bush withstood the temptation of putting it on, but with the
help of his wife, Barbara, recruited two 5-year-old girls from a
crowd of sightseers to model the bonnets.
   The first child, Michelle Beshudi, shied at donning the massive
bonnet, but Laurin Woloshin, a classmate at the Montesorri School
of McLean, Va., happily let Bush put it on her slightly askew. It
toppled, and the girl was dispatched back to her class on the
sidelines.
   Nineteen bagpipers and nine dummers as well as eight Highland
dancers were in the company of 90 that performed for Bush.
   The Black Watch recently embarked on a three-month tour of the
United States. It performed at the White House in November 1963, a
few weeks before Kennedy was assassinated.
   A few weeks later, the Kennedy family called the bagpipers of
the Black Watch back to play at the funeral of the 35th president.

<TEXT>
   A newsroom receptionist fired for her
anti-abortion activities, including picketing, says her rights have
been infringed, but the newspaper says her actions violated its
long-standing ethics policy.
   The Milwaukee Journal's dismissal of Diane Dew has prompted the
filing of a grievance by the newspaper employees union, an
investigation by a state agency and complaints by a religious
freedom organization.
   But Deputy Managing Editor Howard Fibich said the Journal stands
by its decision to fire Ms. Dew even though The New York Times and
Washington Post did not discipline employees in similar
circumstances.
   ``She was part of the news process,'' Fibich said. ``She did not
report the news but she handled the news. She took dictation from
reporters and that type of thing.''
   The newspaper's ethics code, established in 1973, prohibits
newsroom employees from participating in many outside political
activities and also from accepting gifts from outside sources, the
newspaper said.
   ``The reason that it (code) is there is to make sure that we are
able to maintain an image of objectivity,'' Fibich said. ``In my
judgment, our credibility is a precious asset and nothing must
compromise that.''
   Attorney Craig Parshall, who represents Ms. Dew, said his client
was fired as a part-time receptionist-secretary in July after she
refused to sign a statement promising to end her anti-abortion
activities.
   Parshall said Ms. Dew's activities were brought to the
newspaper's attention after a reporter saw her participating in an
anti-abortion protest.
   Ms. Dew said she feels compelled to protest abortion and that
the newspaper's restrictions violate her right to free speech and
religion.
   ``I can't just choose not to believe what I believe,'' she said.
``I'm responsible to speak out because I feel that abortion is
murder and murder is wrong.''
   Bob Dye, communications manager for Journal-Sentinel Inc., the
newspaper's parent company, said Ms. Dew was warned that her
actions violated the ethics code and was offered another job
outside the newsroom with no loss in pay, but turned it down.
   The Rutherford Institute, a Milwaukee-area group that
specializes in cases of religious liberty, filed a religious
discrimination complaint on Ms. Dew's behalf.
   The State Equal Rights Division is investigating to determine if
Ms. Dew was a victim of discrimination, said John Kimble, program
supervisor of investigation in the agency Milwaukee office. If the
division finds there is probable cause to rule discrimination
occurred, the case will go to a hearing, he said.
   The Milwaukee chapter of the Newspaper Guild, a labor union,
filed a grievance with the Journal challenging the dismissal.
   ``We argued that her activities were protected by our contract
and that the company violated the contract by trying to force upon
her a different set of working conditions,'' local president Mike
Kuchta said.
   Fibich said Ms. Dew's position on abortion played no role in her
dismissal. If she was a pro-choice activist the newspaper would
have taken the same action, he said.
   He cited an abortion rights march in Washington last spring in
which reporters from the New York Times and Washington Post
participated.
   ``I thought that was unacceptable,'' he said. ``If it had
happened here, the people involved would have been somehow
reprimanded.''
   Times editors disagreed with Supreme Court correspondent Linda
Greenhouse's decision to participate in the march, but they took no
punitive action, Assistant Managing Editor Warren Hoge said.
   Richard Harwood, ombudsman at the Post, said no disciplinary
action was taken against the few reporters who were involved in the
abortion rights march.
   ``People were reminded that this was inappropriate and that you
are not to take part in political activities if you work for The
Washington Post,'' he said.
   Harwood said the Post's ethics code does not mention newsroom
secretaries and he could not say for certain if they are bound by
the code.

<HEAD>Attorney General Drops ``Spycatcher'' Contempt Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorney general dropped contempt proceedings
Thursday against a bookstore owner who defied a government ban and
refused to stop selling ``Spycatcher,'' the memoirs of a former
British spy.
   At a two-minute private hearing at the High Court, action was
formally dropped against Peter Marsh, who owns Bilbo's Bookshop in
Bath. The attorney general will pay Marsh's $2,760 legal costs.
   The attorney general's office said the public interest no longer
required the case against Marsh to be pursued.
   Last year, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative
government lost a three-year court battle to ban the book by Peter
Wright, who worked for Britain's MI5 intelligence service from 1955
to 1976.
   The government banned the book because it said Wright had
violated an MI5 agreement to never reveal his activities in the
agency.
   Marsh said he felt he had taken a stand for freedom. He sold
copies of ``Spycatcher'' printed in the United States and Ireland,
risking an unlimited fine and a two-year jail term for contempt of
court.
   ``I am happy they have got egg on their faces,'' he said. ``They
have not dropped the action out of any spirit of clemency but
because the consequences if they had tried to proceed would have
been disastrous. Even if they had sent me to prison, they would
still have lost.''

<HEAD>Commission Reroutes Pipeline to Avoid Dr. Joyce Brothers' Land</HEAD>

   New York's Public Service Commission
rerouted a proposed natural gas pipeline around property owned by
Dr. Joyce Brothers.
   The $407 million, 399-mile pipeline, which would bring Canadian
gas to New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, was approved Wednesday
by the PSC. The project is now under review by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission.
   The previous pipeline route would have gone straight through
land owned by the psychologist and advice columnist in Dover, north
of New York City.
   Neighbors accused the panel of ``celebrity siting'' for avoiding
the her land.
   Calls to Brothers' office today went unanswered.
   Last month, the regulatory board voted on all of the pipeline
route except for segments that would run through property owned by
Brothers and by a firm whose owners include Robert Dyson, brother
of John Dyson, a former top state official and unsuccessful
candidate for the 1986 Democratic U.S. Senate nomination.
   PSC commissioners Harold Jerry and Henry Williams recommended
the pipeline route skirt Brothers' land and go through Dyson's
property.
   They said the new route was preferable because it follows a road.
   A pipeline opponent, Dr. Anne Marie Mueser, said Brothers had
told the PSC that the underground pipeline shouldn't go through her
land because of its archeological and environmental features.
   Mueser said Brothers had failed to provide any new information
to the PSC.

   East Germany's attempt to staunch the
hemorrhage of its fleeing citizenry is bound to create bitterness,
frustration and anger in those left behind in a country even less
able to compete with the allure of the West, American experts say.
   ``This is an economic disaster for them,'' says political
scientist Melvin Croan, assessing the impact of the
vote-with-their-feet exodus of tens of thousands of East Germans on
the leaders of that country, the economic star of the communist
world. ``It is a disaster when you have electricians and plumbers
and nurses leaving in a zero population growth society.''
   The departures heighten the delimma facing East Germany's
leaders: If they try to liberalize, their country becomes a pale
imitation of West Germany with no real reason to exist; if they
crack down, they fan the urge to flee.
   ``They say, `If we downgrade Marxism-Leninism, why don't we just
become a state of the Federal Republic?,''' says economist Phillip
Bryson of Brigham Young University, an expert on the East German
economy, ``So if they pursue a policy of democrization and
openness, where does it leave them?''
   On the other hand, a hard-line approach will not only increase
the temptation of East Germans to find a way out, but provoke
Mikhail Gorbachev, who wants better relations with West Germany.
   Gorbachev visits East Germany this weekend to help celebrate the
40th anniversary of the establishment of the German Democratic
Republic.
   ``How they use that visit will be an indicator,'' says Stephen
Burant, associate editor of Problems of Communism, a magazine
published by the U.S. Information Agency.
   ``If they allow street demonstrations in support of Gorbachev
and Glasnost, that may be a signal that there will be some
political changes in East Germany,'' he says. ``By contrast, if
they keep Gorbachev away from the people, that would be a signal
that the hardline would be maintained.''
   The experts agreed that life will be harder for those left
behind now that as many as 100,000 have left a country with an
aging population, a low birth rate and a labor shortage. According
to a secret West German study leaked to the press this summer, 1.5
million East Germans _ nearly one in 10 _ had applied for exit
visas before this fall's dramatic events.
   ``I would bet that hundreds of thousands of the best minds left
in East Germany now and for the foreseeable future are going to be
doing nothing but concentrating on schemes to escape,'' says Joshua
Muravchek, a writer on human rights issues at the American
Enterprise Institute, a Washington research house.
   ``The East Germans until now have been very aware of not having
the same things West Germans had both materially and spiritually,
and that's grated on them,'' he says. ``Now they see both the Poles
and Hungarians getting what they don't have'' _ political freedom.
   Peggy Knutson, a program associate for the German Marshall Fund
of the United States who spent two years teaching English in East
Germany, says the departures create bitterness among those left
behind.
   ``If you're a doctor, you've got to take over for the doctor who
just left. If you're a teacher, you suddenly face twice the load. I
don't know if those who are left are angry with those who leave,
but they are the ones who must deal with the consequences.''
   Adds Jeffrey Gedmin, a researcher at the American Enterprise
Institute: ``There must be a feeling of bitterness and
resentfulness toward those who have left and also toward a
government which seems paralyzed. That hints that the result
probably will be greater disturbances or rumblings for change.''
   Burant sees little likelihood of political upheaval ``if only
because the organized political opposition is still very small and
the regime has kept very close tabs on it. What they've done is to
deport the dissidents to West Germany.''
   But Croan, chairman of the Soviet and East European Studies
Program at the University of Wisconsin, says the departures ``have
emboldened those left behind to speak out and call for reforms.
   ``You had a mass protest this week in Leipzig. Amazing! This is
not Poland, this is East Germany. The East Germans had been scared,
but the feeling now is that the cops are not going to break their
skulls with the eyes and ears of the world on them and Gorbachev
about to visit.''

<HEAD>Budget Director Tells Congress HUD's Problems Are Not Unique</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scandals at the Department of Housing and
Urban Development ``are not unique'' and reflect a wide failure of
government agencies to fix management problems, Budget Director
Richard Darman told Congress Thursday.
   ``There are analogous problems in other agencies,'' said Darman,
director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget.
   Darman said his agency shares in the blame with executive branch
departments for not following up on systemic management problems or
weaknesses reported by the inspector generals within each
department or the General Accounting Office, Congress'
investigative arm.
   He declined to name departments or agencies with unreported
management problems on the scale of the scandals at HUD, where the
cost of mismanagement, influence peddling, fraud and other problems
has been estimated at $7 billion.
   ``I don't think we should be advertising the high-risk areas,''
he told reporters after making his comments to the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee. To do so, he said, would amount to
``an open invitation'' to abuse.
   Darman told the panel he has established new management systems
that establish responsibility for following up on problems found in
audits of agencies.
   ``I'm afraid that what used to happen is an awful lot of
(inspector generals' reports) would not be taken seriously enough
within their own departments, by the political leadership within
their own departments,'' Darman said.
   Elements of the problems at HUD were the subject of audit
reports and warnings by the department's inspector general going
back several years. ``No adequate action was taken,'' Darman said.
   ``The recently exposed HUD problems are not unique, not merely
peculiar to a particular agency under what some have described as
absentee management,'' Darman said. ``Nor are they peculiar, as
some have suggested, to the so-called `greed decade,' the '80s. ...
The history of such problems is at least as old as the American
government iteslf.''
   Darman's remarks to the committee followed a series of hearings
in which it has brought attention to management problems reported
by the independent audits.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, the chairman, said there were
``shocking'' management problems involving Department of Energy
contractors, NASA spending, the Labor Department, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and other
agencies.
   Darman also cited ``a Washington cultural problem'' is
discussing the federal government's management problems.
   ``I call it the `Hollywood East Syndrome.' There are too many
people in positions of political responsiblity who are infatuated
by the lure of glitter and lights _ or the often illusory chance to
`make policy,''' he said, at the expense of ``more pedestrian work
of nuts-and-bolts management.''

   Dick Gregory, the comedian who
became an activist and then an entrepreneur in the weight-loss
business, blames his generosity for the $1.5 million in losses
sustained by his diet center.
   Gregory said Wednesday that the beachfront Dick Gregory Diet &amp;
Health Resort near this Florida Panhandle city would close Thursday
and reopen in Cottonwood, Ala.
   ``I think the biggest problem with this operation was probably
me as far as finances were concerned,'' Gregory said.
   He said that by Friday he would pay $40,000 in debts, which he
blamed on his unwillingness to turn away severely obese people who
could not afford his $1,000-a-week weight-reduction program.
   Gregory denied that criticism by former clients and health
experts played any part in his decision to move to the former Sealy
Springs Spa in Alabama.
   Ex-clients complained the center failed to deliver on promises
of luxurious accommodations, professional services and special
rates. While some clients have succeeded in huge weight losses,
medical and nutritional experts have contended Gregory's program is
unsafe and ineffective.
   Gregory said the new site 80 miles to the northeast, near the
Alabama-Florida state line, offered a more easily controlled
environment. There's no nearby grocery, and ``they won't be able to
call me at home in the middle of the night and have me overrule the
director,'' he said.

   Pittsburgh Pirates' announcer Jim Rooker left
Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia on Thursday for a 315-mile walk
that resulted from a quip during a June 8 broadcast.
   A jazz band played and mascots from the Phillies and Pirates
clowned for television cameras as the 47-year-old former major
league pitcher set out on ``Rook's Unintentional Walk'' to
Pittsburgh.
   After a six-game losing streak, the Pirates had a 10-0 lead in
the first inning in Philadelphia when Rooker said, ``If we lose
this game, I'll walk home.'' The Phillies won 15-11, and when
Rooker traveled home with the ballclub, fans reminded him of his
pledge.
   Rooker worked out a way to have the walk, supported by a crew in
a motor home and corporate sponsors, benefit Bob Prince Charities,
founded by a late Pirates broadcaster to back Pittsburgh-based
causes.
   Rooker and a friend, Carl A. Dozzi, planned to walk 26 miles to
suburban West Chester on Thursday, and finish the trip in 12 days.
   Rooker knows the walk could have been worse.
   ``I could have said it in Los Angeles,'' he said.

   Armand Hammer, the 91-year-old chairman
of Occidental Petroleum Co., has sued to stop publication of a
biography in Europe, and threatened to do likewise in the United
States.
   ``Armand Hammer: The Untold Story'' was written by University of
Missouri journalism professor Steve Weinberg, who says he
interviewed nearly 700 people but got no cooperation from Hammer in
his research.
   Weinberg says the book published by Little Brown is already on
bookstore shelves, and that efforts to halt publication now may
actually stir interest in the biography.
   Letters from Hammer's lawyers, obtained by The Wall Street
Journal, termed the book ``beyond redemption by correction,'' and
said it was ``riddled'' with falsehoods.
   The industrialist, a frequent intermediary between the Soviet
Union and the West, generally has been portrayed in the media as an
influential adviser to presidents and a humanitarian.
   Weinberg says he uncovered new information questioning Hammer's
clout in Washington and detailing a questionable bankruptcy filing
by Hammer's father. Weinberg said his book should not ``destroy the
man's reputation. I think it is a very balanced account of his
life.''

to sub for Harrison, 81, in the play's third act.
   Harrison made it through two acts Wednesday before the curtain

Producer Elliott Martin blamed the medicine Harrison received after

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson says he will be host of a
weekly TV talk show, starting a year from now, to give the ``real
America'' a chance to be heard.
   Though its format is not yet decided, Jackson said today the
syndicated ``Voices of America With Jesse Jackson'' would be
designed to ``create access, precipitate ideas and be fair.''
   He said there is ``incestuous inbreeding among the talk shows
now'' and added, ``We must open up the window for communication.''
   Van Gordon Sauter, a former CBS News president and an executive
producer of the program, said it would probably include elements of
talk, magazine and interview formats.
   Composer and musical producer Quincy Jones will also serve as an
executive producer, it was announced.
   The program will be syndicated by Warner Brothers Domestic

   Striking Machinists expressed determination to
hold out for a richer offer from the Boeing Co. while the world's
No. 1 builder of passenger jets today worked to keep assembly lines
running.
   ``We are setting about the business at hand ... to start working
on those aircraft that are far enough down the line that our
supervisory people can complete them so those airplanes can be
delivered,'' company spokesman Paul Binder said.
   The Machinists union, Boeing's largest representing 57,800
workers around the country, struck early Wednesday after members
overwhelmingly rejected a three-year offer that included their
first wage increase in six years.
   The strike hits Boeing in its fifth consecutive year of record
jetliner orders. So far this year, Boeing has had orders for 736
commercial jets worth $38.5 billion, boosting its order backlog to
$80 billion.
   The orders have pressured the company to maintain delivery
schedules, and the heavy overtime required of workers has become a
major issue in the strike.
   ``When my kids found out about the strike, they said, `Oh boy,
we get to see Daddy,''' said Bob Junka, who was on a picket line at
a plant in Renton, south of Seattle.
   No talks were scheduled, Boeing spokesman Harold Carr said this
morning. The company's operations are continuing, he said, ``but
one obviously needs to recognize that we're operating without
43,000 people who are normally here.''
   Federal mediator Douglas Hammond said he was trying to get both
sides to resume talks soon because of the large number of workers
and the potential for economic havoc with a long strike. Boeing is
the state's largest private employer and the nation's leading
exporter.
   Boeing took out full-page advertisements in Seattle-area
newspapers to outline its contract offer, describing it as
``substantial, providing for continued growth in compensation and
benefits.''
   Members of other Boeing unions reported to work as usual
Wednesday, but some unionized workers for a subcontractor stayed
away from a plant in the Seattle area after unexpectedly finding
pickets at the gate.
   In Wichita, Kan., where 12,000 Machinists are on strike, Boeing
secured a judge's order to limit the number of pickets at plant
gates and prohibit pickets from speaking in an abusive or
intimidating manner to people trying to report for work.
   The order was granted after pickets stopped each vehicle headed
toward the plant and attempted to persuade the occupants to honor
strike lines. Traffic delays of three hours or more were reported.
No problems were reported this morning.
   Two motorists were detained for questioning by Sedgwick County
sheriff's deputies after allegedly bumping people with their cars.
No one was seriously injured.
   In the Washington, Tom Baker, Machinists district president,
went from plant to plant in the Puget Sound area and talked with
pickets.
   ``Everybody's spirits are high,'' the union leader said. ``I
just tell them to keep dug in.''
   ``That's what we like to see, (he's) right out here with us,''
striker Blake LaLonde said of Baker.
   LaLonde, 23, and his fellow pickets cheered with each honk of
support from passing motorists.
   Boeing offered a salary hike totaling 10 percent over three
years, plus bonus pay, but Machinists said they want more money and
were upset at having to work mandatory overtime. The proposal would
have cut mandatory overtime to 160 hours a quarter from 200 hours.
   ``Most people we talked to were basically insulted by the
contract,'' said picket Bryce Bushby, who spoke outside Boeing's
south Seattle headquarters. Boeing machinists haven't gotten a
raise in six years, but received yearly bonuses.
   Pickets marched in 45-degree weather outside the plant, waving
signs as motorists and truck drivers honked horns.
   In addition to those in the Seattle and Wichita areas, 1,700
Machinists in Portland, Ore., and smaller numbers in a half-dozen
other locations are on strike.
   Worldwide, Boeing employs 164,000 people, including 106,000 in
western Washington.
   Binder said he didn't know how many airplanes were far enough
along that they could be completed by supervisory personnel.
   Before Boeing can deliver any airplanes completed during the
strike, the Federal Aviation Administration will require the
company to demonstrate its compliance with an FAA-approved quality
control program, KIRO-TV reported.
   The FAA said it would increase on-site production surveillance
at Boeing plants during the strike.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe, long
treated as the chief propaganda enemy of the Polish state, will be
allowed to open a bureau in Poland, a government official said
Thursday.
   A delegation of the Munich-based radio station discussed the
possibility of opening a bureau Wednesday with Jacek Ambroziak,
director of the Office of the Council of Ministers and chief
assistant to Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   ``They did not apply officially, as far as I know. But I think
that if they apply for it, the answer will be positive,'' Ambroziak
said in a telephone interview.
   ``The Polish government preliminarily agreed on the application
for our accreditation. We anticipate that in a few weeks we will be
able to open our second bureau in Eastern Europe,'' A. Ross
Johnson, director of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, said in
the pro-Solidarity paper Gazeta Wyborcza.
   Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty opened their first East bloc
bureau in Budapest, Hungary, on Sept. 27.
   Radio Free Europe broadcasts in local languages to Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Romania. Radio Liberty
broadcasts in 12 languages to the Soviet Union. They have an
audience of about 55 million.
   Jamming of the broadcasts has ended in most Eastern European
countries in recent years under the influence of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Throughout most of the 1980s, the Polish government attacked
Radio Free Europe as biased propaganda designed to undermine the
state.
   But official attitudes reversed after Solidarity's landslide
election victory in June and the creation of the new non-communist
government.

<HEAD>Administration Wants Senate to Make Capital Gains Measure Permanent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Thursday signaled
its intention to push for a permanent capital-gains tax cut in the
Senate as early as this weekend.
   Richard G. Darman, director of the White House Office of
Management and Budget, said the administration-supported
capital-gains cut approved by the House last week is flawed because
its full impact would be in effect for only 27 months.
   Nevertheless, Darman said under questioning by the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, the House plan is ``better than
none at all because we could extend it.'' That is what the
administration hopes to do in the Senate, he added.
   Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, senior Republican on the
tax-writing Finance Committee, said he is trying to put together a
capital-gains cut that can get the support of Democrats and
Republicans.
   ``I believe there is a significant number of senators, both
Democrats and Republicans, who are interested in supporting some
type of capital-gains proposal,'' Packwood said in a statement.
   The Finance Committee earlier this week defeated on a 10-10 vote
a Packwood proposal that would have cut capital-gains taxes for
individuals and corporations.
   Thus, the deficit-reduction bill written by the committee
contains no capital-gains cut but a substitute favored by most
Democrats that would attempt to encourage increased saving by
liberalizing tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts.
   The Senate will begin debate on the bill as early as Friday.
   Under the law that governs consideration of such
deficit-reduction bills, some congressional aides say, it will
require 60 votes _ not just a majority of the senators voting _ to
add a capital-gains cut to the bill on the Senate floor.
Republicans are challenging that interpretation.
   Bush won the votes of all but one Republican and of one of every
four Democrats when the House approved a cpaital-gains reduction
last week. But that was not a straight yes-or-no vote on capital
gains, because the alternative was to vote for a tax increase on
high-income Americans to finance liberalized IRAs.
   Senate Democratic leaders are pushing the same IRA provision but
are steering clear of anything that could be interpreted as a tax
increase.
   The Packwood proposal that failed in the Finance Committee, and
which is likely to be the basis of any plan presented to the
Senate, would provide a lower tax on stocks, land and other
investments that are held for longer periods of time by individuals.
   For example, if an investment is sold after being owned only a
year and a day, 95 percent of the profit from the sale would be
taxed. But if the investment were held for six years, only 70
percent would be taxed.
   Present law fully taxes capital gains at the same rates applying
to wages and other income.
   Democratic leaders are fighting a capital-gains cut on grounds
that 80 percent of the tax saving would go to people with annual
incomes over $100,000. They say allowing more workers to have
tax-deductible IRAs would be more effective in encouraging saving.
   Present law authorizes fully deductible IRAs only for workers
who are not covered by a company pension, to covered single people
with incomes under $25,000 and covered couples under $40,000.
   The Democratic proposal would allow any worker, regardless of
income or company pension, to deduct half of an annual contribution
of up to $2,000. Half of a contribution would be taxed at the
current rate and the other half, along with interest earned by the
account, would escape tax until withdrawn for retirement, to buy a
first home or pay for a college education.

<TEXT>
   The man convicted of killing Prime Minister
Olof Palme knew what he was doing and does not need a psychiatric
examination, the prosecutor told an appeals court Thursday.
   Prosecutor Anders Helin asked the Svea Court of Appeals in his
summation to uphold the life sentence for Christer Pettersson and
to stiffen a second charge from endangerment to attempted murder in
the wounding of Palme's wife, Lisbeth.
   Pettersson, clearly irritated after Helin's arguments, pushed
his way out of the courtroom and said, ``Why do you think I'm
denying this? Do you think I'm afraid of jail?''
   The nearly three weeks of appeals hearings are nearing an end,
and the defense is to sum up its case Monday.
   Palme was shot in the back at close range Feb. 28, 1986, as he
walked home from a movie with his wife.
   Pettersson, who has a history of violent crime, was convicted by
a lower court in July.
   Helin said there was no need for a psychiatric examination since
Pettersson, 42, had undergone several such tests in recent years.
Those tests failed to prove he was not responsible for his
behavior, Helin said.
   If found to be insane, a convict could have his prison sentence
commuted to psychiatric care for an unspecified period.

   President Bush on Thursday praised the valor
of East Germans fleeing their homeland and said he looked forward
to a time when they ``will not have to climb fences ... to enjoy
the fruits of a free society.''
   ``We are riveted and I am moved by the tens of thousands of East
Germans sacrificing all that they own, leaving everything behind to
find their way to a West that offers the promise of freedom and
opportunity,'' Bush said at a Rose Garden ceremony where he signed
a German-American day proclamation.
   He made the comments shortly after trainloads of East German
refugees arrived Thursday in West Germany from Prague,
Czechoslovakia, where they had sought refuge in embassies before
following other East Germans who were allowed to emigrate during
the weekend.
   Many of the refugees had resisted Czech police to climb over the
fences of Western embassies.
   ``I read today of thousands of people, people who had waited for
10 years to buy a car, and just left them on the street, handing
the keys to whoever wanted them ... taking with them only the
possessions they could carry and climbed over an embassy fence to
wait for a freedom train,'' Bush said.
   ``As we celebrate German-American day, I want to praise the
actions of the Federal Republic in rising to the challenges
presented by these events ... I also look forward to the day that
Germans will not have to climb fences, freeze in embassy courtyards
or dodge bullets in order to enjoy the fruits of a free society.''
   A handful of legislators from the West German parliament were on
hand for the ceremony.
   Rita Sussmuth, the president of the parliament, or Bundestag,
said the day was ``a manifestation for free partners in a free
world.''
   She was asked later by reporters if she expected to see a
crackdown on reformers in her country.
   ``We do have some great fear that the reform movement is going
to be repressed,'' she said, adding that the upcoming visit of
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev could give impetus to more
reforms in her country.
   ``We hope that the visit of Gorbachev will be supportive of the
reforms in the German Democratic Republic and we hope that
Gorbachev is going to explain to the leadership in the German
Democratic Republic that reforms are unavoidable,'' she said.

   A 14-year-old with a rifle and handgun
took a high school choir class hostage today and wounded one
student before surrendering, police said.
   The condition of the wounded student was not immediately known.
The ordeal at Loara High School lasted about 45 minutes before the
unidentified teen-ager's arrest.
   No motive was given for the takeover.
   ``The hostage situation is over,'' said police spokeswoman
Barbara Ann Burke. ``A 14-year-old student carrying two guns went
into an auditorium where a choir was rehearsing. One student was
shot in the face.''
   She said other students were kept in classrooms during the
standoff.
   Authorities said there were 29 girls and 10 boys registered for
the class but the actual number of students in class today was not
known.
   ``He had a room full of 'em. He let the girls leave and held the
boys,'' said police Sgt. Frank Vandeweerd.
   Police Chief Joseph Molloy said of the arrested teen-ager, ``We
have had contact with him before in our department.'' He did not
elaborate.
   A student who answered a telephone at the school said all
administrators were busy and there was no information to be given
out.
   The school is 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Agriculture Department Urged to Spend More for Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 10-fold increase in the Agriculture
Department's $50 million competitive research grant program was
recommended Thursday in a report by the National Research Council.
   A $500 million boost in USDA research spending is needed to
``revitalize and reinvigorate one of the leading industries, the
agricultural, food and environmental system, in its broadest
sense,'' the report said.
   The United States also faces ``new and aggressive competition
from abroad'' in trade, which the report said has weakened the
strong role that agricultural exports play in the U.S. balance of
payments.
   Dietary risks from eating too much saturated fat, pesticide
residues in fruits and vegetables, contamination by food poisoning
organisms, and pollution of air and water were cited as other major
problems.
   ``Solving the problems of competitiveness, a high-quality food
supply, and natural resources and the environment will require much
more new knowledge than was required to solve previous problems,''
the report said.
   ``The necessary new knowledge is unlikely to be acquired and
expediently applied without substantial new funding,'' it said.
   The NRC report was specific, recommending that ``research
support for agriculture, food and the environment should be
increased by $500 million annually'' and that the entire increase
``should support competitive grants'' administered by the
department.
   ``Funds should come from new monies, not from the redirection or
reallocation of existing research and education programs,'' the
report said.
   Assistant Secretary Charles E. Hess, who oversees USDA science
and education programs, said he agreed with the report's basic call
for stepped up effort in agricultural research. However, Hess
declined to endorse a specific funding level.
   ``I would very much like to be able to endorse the funding
program proposed in the initiative,'' Hess told reporters. ``But,
as you realize, we operate within the constraints of the federal
budget.''
   Hess said the USDA, however, ``will be considering how and to
what extent'' the proposal can be addressed in preparing future
spending blueprints submitted for White House approval.
   The Office of Management and Budget is aware of the proposal,
but at this point ``we are only talking with OMB about our research
budget for fiscal year 1991,'' which will begin a year from now, he
said.
   Hess was asked if the department's 1991 budget would include
$500 million for research.
   ``Again, I can't make that prediction,'' Hess responded. ``As I
speak for my own preferences, I would, of course, be very pleased
to see that size of an investment'' because of the challenges
facing U.S. agriculture.
   Six program areas were identified for the expanded research
effort: plant systems; animal systems; nutrition, food quality and
health; natural resources and the environment; engineering,
products and processes; and markets, trade and policy.
   Further, the report said the grants should average at least
$100,000 annually and should be for at least three years and as
many as five.
   Currently, USDA competitive research grants average $50,000 and
are for two years.
   In contrast, the report said, the average grants by the National
Science Foundation are $71,300 annually, and those by the National
Institutes of Health are $154,900 a year. Both are for three years
or more.
   The report acknowledged the ``fiscal realities'' of federal
budget deficits and that some potential trade-offs might have to be
considered, including raising the $500 million by canceling some
other USDA research.
   Other possible trade-offs could be ``savings'' from reduced
spending for commodity price supports, or shifting money from other
parts of the federal budget.
   But the report stood fast against canceling or draining other
USDA research programs, contending that the department's research
budget, which is about $1.2 billion, has not increased for 25 years
because ``actual monetary increases have barely kept up with
inflation.''

   The swift response of forces loyal to Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega during Tuesday's attempted coup in Panama
caught the rebels and American military forces by surprise, U.S.
officials said today. They said the U.S. command's lack of
flexibility was a major factor in the failure of the overthrow.
   Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., told the
Senate he had just received information that the officer identified
as the leader of the coup, Maj. Moises Giroldi, had been executed
and that ``Noriega personally shot'' the rebel leader.
   Helms said he based his account on information collected by his
staff from unspecified sources.
   An administration source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the government ``believes Giroldi is dead'' but does not have
confirmation.
   Helms also alleged that while the rebels had Noriega in custody
they asked U.S. authorities to take custody of him and remove him
to the United States.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney denounced Helms' claim as
``hogwash.''
   According to U.S. officials who declined to be identified,
forces loyal to Noriega surprised the rebels and the U.S. military
by flying in a company of troops to an air strip near the military
headquarters, which the insurgents had seized Tuesday morning.
   Shortly after the pro-Noriega forces moved in on the
headquarters, a key battalion that had not declared itself threw
its support to the Panamanian leader, the U.S. officials said.
   According to the officials, the U.S. Southern Command could have
prevented the takeoff of the aircraft carrying the pro-Noriega
forces by filling the sky over the airbase with American aircraft.
   But the command did not have the discretionary authority to take
that action and did not get the required approval from Washington,
the officials said.
   During an appearance on Capitol Hill, Cheney was asked about
Helms' claim that U.S. officials turned down an offer to take
custody of Noriega.
   ``Any charge that we were somehow offered Noriega and didn't
take him is hogwash,'' the secretary replied.
   Cheney said in an interview with CBS earlier today that rebels
had refused in a ``face-to-face contact'' with a U.S. military
officer to turn over Noriega during the coup attempt.
   The administration has insisted the rebels were not interested
in turning Noriega over to the United States, but wanted him simply
to retire and remain in Panama.
   Cheney said that at one point during the uprising ``shortly
before the coup collapsed, contact between one of our military
officers and two junior officers that were involved in the coup''
occurred at Fort Clayton, a U.S. facility in Panama.
   Asked about the meeting, Cheney said, ``It was a face-to-face
contact. ... And that was where they made it clear to us that they
would not turn Noriega over to us.'' He did not name the
individuals involved.
   President Bush has come under sharp criticism from some
Republicans as well as Democrats in Congress for not intervening on
the side of the coup leaders. The critics claim he missed a
precious opportunity to oust Noriega, who faces drug charges in
this country.
   ``They wanted certainty,'' Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., said of the
administration. ``You do not get an engraved invitation to a coup.
They just lacked boldness.''
   But Cheney, a former House member, brushed aside congressional
criticism as ``Monday morning advice.''
   ``The same people who'd be criticizing us if we had intervened
are now criticizing us for not intervening,'' he said.
   Cheney's comments were part of a campaign by the administration
to defend Bush's actions on Tuesday. The defense secretary was on
two morning talk shows after granting an interview to CBS for
broadcast on Wednesday night and talking with reporters on Capitol
Hill on Wednesday.
   ``This is an issue where it's open to disagreement but I think
on the whole we found the support to be very strong and very broad,
actually,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today. ``To
have a handful of congressmen suggest it was the wrong course is a
pretty minor response.''
   At the same time, the administration was moving to underscore
its continued opposition to Noriega.
   Vice President Dan Quayle met today with Guillermo Ford, an
opposition vice presidential candidate in last May's Panamanian
election.
   Ford did not answer directly when asked if the United States
should have intervened in behalf of the insurgents. Instead he
called on the Panamanian military to try again.
   ``We were surprised by the coup attempt, but we feel that the
defense forces should put their act together and get rid of Mr.
Noriega,'' Ford said.
   Speaking on ``CBS This Morning,'' Cheney also said the United
States has given sanctuary to the family of one of the coup leaders.
   A communique issued in Panama by Noriega's government said five
coup leaders had taken refuge at a U.S. Army base near Panama City,
but the administration has not confirmed that account.
   Alluding to a charge made against Bush during the 1988
presidential campaign, Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., added: ``There's
a resurgence of the wimp factor.''
   A large cross-section of lawmakers, both Democrats and
Republicans, voiced bitter disappointment at the U.S. failure to
send in military force to support Tuesday's short-lived uprising
against Noriega by 200 to 300 dissident Panamanian Defense Forces
troops.
   Not all lawmakers were critical, however.
   ``I'm convinced we did the right thing,'' said Rep. Earl Hutto,
D-Fla., a member of the House Armed Services Committee. ``It would
have been foolish for us to take military action with loss of
lives'' in the face of ``an obvious lack of intelligence.''
   In public statements and briefings on Capitol Hill, Bush' men
portrayed their caution as the only responsible approach to a
situation fraught with confusion and conflicting information.
   ``The president made the right decision,'' said Cheney.
   Cheney said the initial report that the coup was to be led by
Giroldi, a close Noriega confidant, raised doubts. ``This might
well have been a setup,'' he said.

   Anti-abortion activist Randall Terry was fined
$1,000 today for a sit-in at a clinic during the Democratic
National Convention last year _ but chose two years in jail rather
than pay.
   Fulton County Judge John Bruner had told Terry, leader of the
group Operation Rescue, he would suspend a two-year jail term on
condition Terry pay a fine, stay out of the Atlanta area and not
violate Georgia law.
   But Terry, 30, told the judge, ``In good conscience, I cannot
pay the fine.'' He contends he committed no crime because he was
trying to save unborn children.
   ``That's entirely up to you, sir,'' replied the judge.
   Defense attorney Jay Sekulow said his client would go to the
county jail later in the day.
   Prosecutors had requested two years in prison and $2,000 in
fines for Terry, who was convicted Friday of criminal trespass and
unlawful assembly for the sit-in.
   During his week-long trial, Terry, who is not a lawyer,
represented himself and often tested the judge's patience by making
speeches against abortion. Half the courtroom was cleared at one
point after outbursts by supporters.
   Operation Rescue conducted a series of anti-abortion protests in
Atlanta during and after the Democrats' convention. Nire than 1,200
arrests were made, and protesters clogged jails by refusing to
identify themselves.
   Others previously convicted for their roles in the
demonstrations drew stiff sentences. Among them was a South
Carolina minister sentenced to four years and a Warner Robins woman
sentenced to three years.

<HEAD>Former Nursing Home Worker Accused of Tying Knot in Oxygen Tube</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOPSHAM, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former nursing home employee was charged
with attempted murder for allegedly tying a knot in the oxygen tube
of an 81-year-old woman, who died four days later, authorities said.
   A nine-count indictment returned against Olian Small, 36, of
Nobleboro, also alleges he endangered the lives of that woman and
four others at Amenity Manor by failing to give them medication and
then writing in medical records that he had done so, Assistant
Attorney General Joe Wannemacher said Thursday.
   Small was arrested Wednesday evening.
   Wannemacher said the death in April of Helen Ada Potter was not
attributed to the actions of Small. Ms. Potter was one of the five
women who allegedly were not given medication by Small, Wannemacher
said.
   ``By failing to give the medication, that doesn't prove that he
did that deliberately to try to kill these women,'' Wannemacher
said. ``On the other hand, tying a knot, you can kind of come to
that conclusion without straining too hard.''
   Amenity Manor administrator Mitch Rousseau did not immediately
return a phone call Thursday. The nursing home was not charged.
   Wannemacher said the indictment against Small contains one count
of attempted murder, two counts of aggravated assault and six
counts of endangering the welfare of patients.
   He said experts might argue over the seriousness of the
consequences of tying the oxygen tube, so there were several
charges made.
   ``You're not cutting off the air, but you're cutting off the
supplemental oxygen supply, which is not like suffocating
somebody,'' Wannemacher said.
   The woman went without oxygen for about 30 minutes, Wannemacher
said. He was unsure what caused her death.

   They shivered under blankets, their
faces streaked with tears. They waited in lines for food, for
telephones, for the chance to pick through second-hand clothing.
   They were tired and dirty. Men and women clung to small bags
that held their only belongings. Crying children clutched stuffed
toys.
   But for the thousands of East Germans who flooded into this
border town Thursday, the chaotic and crowded surroundings of a Hof
train station brought only joy, pure and unbridled.
   Their grueling, sometimes harrowing trip to freedom was a
memory. This was paradise.
   ``We left the car in Prague, but who cares?'' said Guido
Albrecht, 26, who fled with his wife, Kerstin, 28. ``The main thing
is that we're here,''
   Trains carrying 7,600 East Germans arrived here, bringing the
second wave of a historic refugee exodus. They had fled their
homeland into Czechoslovakia, seeking asylum at the West German
Embassy in the capital there.
   East Germany grudingly agreed to let them go, but first they had
to travel by trains back through their homeland, so they could be
officially expelled.
   Now, they would begin to fashion new lives in West Germany,
where they were granted automatic citizenship and welcomed.
   Regina Pfeiffer, 23, held the hand of her 4-year-old son,
Michael.
   ``We decided at the last moment to go to Prague. We left on
Tuesday morning and got through just before they imposed the travel
restriction,'' to Czechoslovakia, the former Erfurt resident said.
   ``I was so tired but I kept on thinking about my son.''
   East Germany agreed to this exodus Tuesday, then closed the
border with Czechoslovakia, the only nation East Germans could
travel to without government permission.
   Mrs. Pfeiffer's husband, Stefan, also 23, said ``We really
didn't have much time to think. There was speculation at home that
they may close the Ceczhoslovak border.''
   Pfeiffer, a construction worker, said he didn't know where the
family would end up in West Germany. ``Maybe we'll go to
Rhineland-Pfalz,'' he said jokingly. Rhineland-Palz is the German
name for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's home state of Rhineland
Palatinate.
   Most of the refugees are in their 20s and 30s. Most say they
were dissatisfied with East Germany's hard-line Communist system.
   Red Cross workers, shivering in the freezing dawn, spooned out
hot goulash and soup, and poured tea and coffee for the refugees,
the first hot meal for most of them since Wednesday noon in
Czechoslovakia.
   Among the refugees where at least 1,000 young children, looking
dazed and bewildered by the commotion in the Hof train station.
Many were crying, tightly hugging teddy bears and other stuffed
toys.
   Many of the refugees, hugging each other, some crying and others
smiling broadly, waited in long lines for telephones to call
relatives in West Germany and East Germany.
   Most of the East Germans in this northern Bavarian town were put
on other trains within an hour of their arrival Thursday for
transport to refugee centers in other parts of West Germany.
   Hundreds of them, dazed and exhausted, sipped beverages handed
them as they waited to leave for the centers.
   Most of them carried only hand baggage with their entire
belongings. Many were dressed in blue jeans and other light
clothing unsuited for the chilly weather.
   Some sorted through clothing stacked high on yellow railway
carts by the Red Cross workers, looking for something warm to wear.
Others told of how they fled their Communist homeland.
   The Albrechts, who came from Potsdam, said they crossed the
border just an hour before the East German government closed the
border with Czechoslovakia.
   ``It was hell on the train. It was crowded and even some of the
children had to stand in the corridors where it was bitterly
cold,'' he said.
   ``But now I think it was worth it.''

   The first American
rocket built and designed entirely with commercial funds fizzled
and burned on the launch pad today, the project's backers said.
   ``We lighted it up and for one reason or the other it didn't
lift off,'' said Jim Bennett, president of American Rocket Co. of
Camarillo. The launch team tried to disengage the rocket, but it
caught fire, he said.
   The 58-foot rocket used in the $2 million experimental launch
was to have flown on a 15-minute suborbital flight to test Star
Wars missile detectors and a heat shield-parachute that might help
astronauts escape a space station emergency.
   ``There was fire on the pad which is now close to burning itself
out,'' Bennett said. The Air Force said there was minimal damage to
the launch pad, which belongs to the Air Force, but ``the vehicle
is non-flyable.''
   The 33,400-pound rocket is powered by a hybrid engine that runs
on a combination of liquid oxygen and a rubberlike solid fuel.
   American Rocket said its booster was the first designed and
built only with commercial funds. Rockets in other commercial
launches this year were built under government programs but later
sold for commercial use, according to the company.
   Today's launch was scheduled so the rocket could release a cloud
of inert gas as the Pentagon's Delta Star satellite passed
overhead. The satellite contains sensors that someday may be part
of a Strategic Defense Initiative system in which satellites would
detect incoming warheads so they could be destroyed.
   Defense Department spokesman Maj. William O'Connell said earlier
that the Pentagon would not reveal whether the sensors detected the
booster.
   The rocket also was scheduled to deploy a test model of an
8{-foot-wide ParaShield _ a combined heat shield and parachute that
someday might be part of an escape system to allow space station
astronauts to return to Earth.
   David Akin, assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had his design class
build the 390-pound model.

   Eight months after the start of a murder
trial, jurors spent 14 hours in court before deciding on a death
sentence _ while one juror endured the start of labor contractions.
   ``I just took my time, looked at all the facts, and we sat and
talked,'' said Susan Kilby. ``I wasn't really rushing. I'm not a
worrywart.''
   Late Tuesday, Ms. Kilby and the 11 other jurors condemned Robert
J. Breton to death for killing his ex-wife and teen-age son.
   The verdict was returned about five minutes before the jurors
were scheduled to take an extended recess so Ms. Kilby could give
birth, and two others could get married and one could go on
vacation.
   Ten hours later, after a sleepless night, Ms. Kilby gave birth
to a healthy 8-pound boy, her second child.
   In a telephone interview from her hospital room Wednesday, she
described the stress of weighing a man's life while her body told
her a baby was coming.
   ``I was getting a lot of contractions,'' she said. ``But we had
to get that trial done. This case has been lingering around for
months. We had all the facts, everything in front of us.''
   ``We weren't going to make that decision unless it was
unanimous. Now we can all go on with our lives.''
   Lawyers said Ms. Kilby's condition must have put pressure on her
fellow jurors to reach a verdict, but jury foreman John Sherman
said the jury felt no pressure to finish that night.
   When Ms. Kilby was chosen in February as a juror, she told Judge
Maxwell Heiman she was expecting a child in October.
   The judge wasn't concerned _ murder trials don't often last
eight months.
   The jury convicted Breton in April, but the sentencing phase was
delayed six months while the state Supreme Court reviewed Heiman's
ruling early in the trial that the state's death penalty law was
unconstitutionally vague.
   By the time the Supreme Court ruled and the jury finally
reconvened to consider whether Breton should be sentenced to death
or to life in prison, Ms. Kilby was very pregnant. In addition, two
other jurors had planned fall weddings, and a fourth was preparing
for a long vacation.
   Heiman, in a move challenged unsuccessfully by Breton's lawyers,
decided to have the jury deliberate for one day, to be followed by
a two-month recess if no decision could be reached by 11 p.m.
Tuesday.
   As the hour neared, tension built in the courtroom. Heiman,
pacing in the courtroom, joked at one point: ``I hope she doesn't
have the baby tonight.'' The jury returned its verdict at about
10:55 p.m., ending a 14-hour day filled by closing arguments, the
judge's instructions to the jury and five hours of deliberations.
   Ms. Kilby, 32, a psychiatric technician at Waterbury Hospital
where the baby was born, said she drew on her professional
experience to get through the last day of the trial.
   ``I'm trained to deal with stress, with people and problems,''
she said. ``It was easy enough for me. I think (the other jurors)
were really more worried about me making it through.''
   Breton won't formally be sentenced until Oct. 27, but the jury's
decision leaves Heiman no choice but to sentence Breton to death.
The sentence will automatically be reviewed by the state Supreme
Court.
   Richard Kelly, a public defender who represented Breton, said
the pressure Ms. Kilby's pregnancy put on the jury would be cited
in the appeal.
   ``I suppose the concern is not just the pressures that might
have existed on that juror, but the pressures that her situation
placed on other jurors,'' said Alan McWhirter, another defense
attorney.
   ``I think a logical argument can be made that this jury was
rushed,'' said Diane Randall, a lobbyist for the Connecticut
Network Against the Death Penalty.

   The following are the 24 counts listed in
the Dec. 5, 1988, indictment against Jim Bakker and his former PTL
executive vice president, Richard Dortch.
   Dortch, 57, agreed Aug. 8 to plead guilty to two counts of wire
fraud and one count each of mail fraud and conspiracy. Dortch was
sentenced Aug. 24 to eight years in prison and fined $200,000.
   A news release from the U.S. attorney's office when the
indictment was returned said the case involved the sale of 152,903
partnerships that produced at least $158 million. Prosecutors said
Bakker diverted $3.7 million of the amount to his own use.
   Heritage Grand partnerships cost $1,000; the buyer got a promise
of annual free lodging for three nights at the Heritage Grand
Hotel, the only one ever built at Heritage USA.
   Tower Hotel partnerships also cost $1,000 and promised the same
lodging at the Tower Hotel, which never was finished.
   Silver 7000 partnerships cost $3,000 with the same guarantee of
lodging. Victory Warrior partnerships also cost $1,000 with the
same guarantee.
   Family Fun partnerships were $1,000 but later were reduced to
$900 and included use of some parts of the amusement park.
   The 1100 Club partnerships cost $1,100.
   Bunkhouse partnerships cost $500 and guaranteed annual lodging
in rustic bunkhouses. Only one 16-room bunkhouse ever was built.

   The afternoon Kansas City Star and the
morning Kansas City Times will merge to form a single morning paper
called The Kansas City Star.
   No date was set for publication of the merged newspaper, said
James H. Hale, publisher of the two papers.
   He and Editor Joe McGuff said today that no employees will be
laid off because of the merger.
   The two papers have been owned by Capital Cities-ABC Inc. since
1977 but compete in news coverage.
   The merger will mark the end of 109 years of afternoon
publishing by the Kansas City Star Co., which was started in 1880
as a two-penny, four-page paper by William Rockhill Nelson and
Samuel E. Morss.
   Nelson later bought Morss' interest and purchased the Times in
1901 and ran it as the morning edition of the Star.
   McGuff said the change was brought about by declining
circulation and shifting readership preferences.
   ``Readers are telling us they have less time for reading, for
watching television and for leisure activities than ever before,''
McGuff said. ``They want their information in one convenient,
well-organized, easy-to-read package.''
   The decision to drop afternoon publication follows a trend among
metropolitan newspapers around the country.
   The 1989 Editor &amp; Publisher Yearbook gives the daily Times
circulation at 280,000, the Star's at 185,000. The Sunday Star's
circulation is a little more than 400,000.

<HEAD>Pope Calls for Immediate Legalization of Ukrainian Church</HEAD>
<HEAD>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II set the stage for a
historic meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev by saying Thursday the
Soviet Union should legalize the long-banned Ukrainian Catholic
Church ``without delay.''
   His remarks indicated John Paul will raise the issue during the
Soviet president's visit to Italy on Nov. 29-Dec. 1, when they plan
the first meeting between supreme leaders of the Vatican and the
Kremlin.
   In remarks Thursday to Ukrainian bishops living in the West, the
pontiff said their church had been ``forced into the catacombs,''
referring to its suppression by dictator Josef Stalin more than 40
years ago.
   Without mentioning Gorbachev by name, John Paul said continued
``hostility and accusations'' against the Ukrainian church hinder
the reforms the president has put into motion.
   ``Without the legalization of the Ukrainian community, the
process of democratization will never be complete,'' the pope said.
   In 1946, the Eastern rite Ukrainian church was forcibly merged
with the Russian Orthodox church. The pope noted that churches and
monasteries were closed and some bishops and priests were killed,
deported or arrested.
   The Ukrainian church flourished underground, however, and today
has an estimated following of 2 million to 4 million. Ukrainian
Catholics have held several rallies in recent weeks demanding
legalization.
   ``With ever greater urgency and frequency the cry of these
Ukrainian Catholics reaches Rome,'' the pope said Thursday. ``
`Help us,' they ask, `so that we may be able to pray in public, no
longer in hiding but in the churches we built.' The bishop of Rome
(the pope) must heed these pleas.
   ``The readiness and good will of the authorities must be brought
to bear so that ... they may, after decades of neglect, solve the
problem of the recognition of the rights of the Ukrainian Catholic
Church.
   ``The Holy See expresses the hope that ... competent authorities
will proceed without delay to the recognition of the rights of your
church.''
   John Paul said the terms of the human rights document approved
in January at the Vienna conference on European security and
cooperation should be applied to the Ukrainian church.
   He called for free access to places of worship, the right of the
church to organize its own hierarchy and the possibility of
maintaining free contact with the faithful at home and abroad.
   The pope urged the officially approved Russian Orthodox Church
to ``overcome prejudices and to come to the aid of their Catholic
brethren who are in need.'' He addressed 18 Ukrainian bishops who
have been holding a two-week synod in Rome.
   Vatican-Soviet relations have improved steadily under Gorbachev,
as exemplified by the pope's recent success in naming new bishops
in Byelorussia, Lithuania and communist Czechoslovakia.
   Another sign of improved relations with Eastern Europe was the
Polish-born pope's acceptance Thursday of the credentials of Jerzy
Kuberski, Poland's first ambassador to the Holy See in more than 40
years.
   The Vatican restored full diplomatic relations with Poland in
July, a first for a Soviet-bloc country. Relations were broken when
the Communists came to power after World War II.
   In remarks to the new ambassador, John Paul did not refer to the
new non-Communist government of Poland, but said his homeland had
become ``once again the country of courage and events that have
prophetic force, especially for those parts of the world where man
still suffers.''

   A woman accused of helping engineer an
airborne prison escape by her husband and another man was sentenced
to one to three years in prison today for a gunbattle that follow
the breakout.
   Patricia A. Gonzales, 41, had pleaded no contest to a reduced
charge of being an accessory to a felony.
   Her husband, Fredrico Gonzales, will plead guilty to the charge
later this week, and charges of attempted murder will be dismissed
in exchange, said prosecutor Glenn Clark.
   The couple and another couple, Ralph and Rebecca Brown, were
arrested Aug. 18 after a bullet-punctuated chase here. Brown, who
was shot in the hand, was the only person injured.
   The shootout came eight hours after the two men escaped from a
prison in Ordway, Colo., by helicopter.
   Authorities said their wives hijacked the chopper at gunpoint
and forced the pilot to fly into the prison yard and pick up their
husbands. The four then landed and drove off in a van, police said.
   The two men face escape charges in Colorado, while the women are
charged in Colorado with kidnapping and aiding an escape.
   Mrs. Gonzales married her 21-year-old husband by proxy after
meeting him while working as a prison volunteer.

<HEAD>Historic Communist Congress to Decide Hungary's Political Fate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist reformers and orthodox
Marxists traded charges and threats Thursday as they prepared for
what could be the most turbulent and important party congress in 41
years of Communist power here.
   Recent commitments by reform-minded Communist leaders to
democracy, a market economy and international human rights have put
Hungary on the forefront of liberalism within the Soviet bloc.
   But they have resulted in growing polarization within the party,
and conservatives have said they will seek to oust reformist
leaders at the congress that opens Friday.
   A groundswell of sentiment against reform and a return to
Marxist orthodoxy would in turn doom plans for free elections,
agreed to by Communists leaders and the political opposition.
   The reformers want to cleanse the commmunist Hungarian Socialist
Workers Party of orthodox elements and do not discount a split if
that proves impossible.
   They also favor changing the party's name _ some suggest calling
it the Hungarian Socialist Party or the Socialist Democratic Union.
Conservatives vehemently oppose removing all reference to Workers.
   Both sides clearly drew the demarcation lines in statements
published Thursday.
   The Marxist Unity Platform, in a manifesto published in the
Communist Party daily Nepszabadsag, urged party members to break
with ``bourgeois and liberal distortions,'' and remain true to
Marxist-Leninist teachings.
   ``The right-wing leadership that has assumed power is dissolving
socialist unity,'' it warned.
   Stating the reformist view, Premier Miklos Nemeth told the
government daily Magyar Hirlap that the party ``has to be freed of
those people ... who do not agree'' with the need for radical
change.
   ``If we have to split in order to rejuvenate, that's something
we have to face,'' Nemeth said.
   Nemeth, one of the prime advocates of change, joined co-leaders
Imre Pozsgay and Rezsoe Nyers in endorsing a conference of
reformists last month. But not all top officials share their views.
   Karoly Grosz, the fourth member of the party presidium, sent a
message of support to a conference of orthodox Marxists opposed to
radical change. They met separately from the reformists to plan
strategy for the congress.
   Former Politburo member Janos Berecz, who was ousted from the
party's executive panel this summer, also opposes broad change.
   While reformists appeared to be in the majority within the
21-member Politburo ahead of the congress, many of the 113-member
Central Committee, the party's top policy formulating body,
remained publicly uncommitted.
   The process to institute bolder changes in place of relatively
modest attempts to tinker with the one-party system and the
state-run economy began about two years ago. It gained steam after
Janos Kadar was ousted in May 1988.
   Reformists associate Kadar's last decade in power with
stagnation, while some conservatives still hail the late leader's
32-year era.
   The pace of reform in recent months has at times moved Hungary
ahead of Poland, the only Soviet bloc country not dominated by
Communists.
   Warsaw has been cautious about not offending its more hard-line
Warsaw Pact partners, but Hungary has alienated three repressive
Warsaw Pact allies _ East Germany, Romania and Czechoslovakia _
with its liberal policies.
   Joining the critics from abroad are orthodox Hungarian Marxists,
angry about a Central Committee draft manifesto prepared for the
congress that would radically change the makeup of their party.
   The 20-page manifesto foresees a ``constitutional state based on
a multi-party system, in which the source of power is the will of
the people, manifested at free elections,'' and ``an efficient
market economy.''
   Voting on the draft is one of the key tasks of the 1,200
delegates, but they also face other key decisions.
   One reform proposal suggests fully democratic elections to
leading party positions. Balloting in the past has been limited to
congress delegates.

   A squirrel hunter delayed reporting the
discovery of a body because he feared the ensuing investigation
would spoil the next day's hunt, a prosecutor said.
   No charges have been filed against the hunter, but the case
remains under investigation, said Benton County Prosecutor David
Clinger. Clinger said charges that could be filed include
obstruction of government operations or hindering prosecution.
   Sheriff Andy Lee said Wednesday the hunter who found the
decomposed body of Dana Stidham of Centerton on Sept. 16, went
hunting the next morning before notifying the sheriff's office. Lee
declined to identify the hunter.
   ``He said if he called Sunday morning before he went hunting it
would mess up the woods, which I think is a very bad attitude,''
Lee said. ``I'm not at all pleased with the way he handled the
situation, and I'm not sure this is the end of it.''
   He said he didn't know how many squirrels the hunter had bagged
during the two days of hunting.
   Ms. Stidham, 18, who was apparently murdered, was last seen July
25 leaving a supermarket in Bella Vista. Her body was sent to the
state Medical Examiner's Office for identification and autopsy, but
the cause of death has not yet been determined, Lee said.

   Tibetans in this Himalayan town rushed
into the streets Thursday when they heard the news, singing and
dancing for the Dalai Lama, their spiritual leader and winner of
the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize.
   ``I cannot describe how happy I am that the world has finally
recognized his message of peace and compassion,'' said Kewstang
Tulku, a Buddhist monk, who arrived at the Dalai Lama's exile
headquarters in Dharmsala in 1979 after spending 17 years in
Chinese prisons. China has occupied Tibet since 1950.
   Shops closed for the surprise festival. About 500 men, women and
children still sang and danced danced in the main square after
sundown, five hours after the news arrived.
   ``This is the people's recognition,'' said the Dalai Lama's
youngest brother, Tenzin Choegyal. ``The award will have tremendous
effect on the Tibetan struggle. It will further highlight the
plight of the Tibetans.''
   Adhi, a 57-year-old woman who escaped from Tibet two years ago
after 21 years in prison, said with a smile: ``I am so very happy
that I cannot stop moving about. I feel a completely different
person today.''
   The Tibetan exile government declared a holiday and scheduled a
public prayer service Friday in Dharmsala's main Buddhist temple.
The Dalai Lama, born Tenzin Gyatso on June 7, 1935, was in
California when the award was announced.
   ``I feel it has been long overdue,'' said Sonan Topgyal, general
secretary of the Tibetan Information and International Relations
Office in Dharmsala. ``It will be one step closer to independence.''
   Last March, China imposed martial law in Tibet after
pro-independence riots in which up to 30 people were reported
killed.
   ``China today weeps and Tibetans rejoice,'' said Lhasang
Tsering, president of the Tibetan Youth Organization, which has
been critical of the exile government and advocates an armed
struggle for independence.
   ``The Nobel Prize has given a new dimension to the Tibetan
struggle,'' he said. ``Our call for an armed struggle will not be
affected. It will remain.''
   China insists that Tibet is an integral part of its territory
and has expressed willingness to negotiate on a status less than
independence. The Dalai Lama has proposed a compromise, proposing
that Tibet be an autonomous territory with defense and foreign
affairs handled by China.

   Denver has a deal for any movie producer with a
script that involves blowing up a big bridge: Come use the 15th
Street Viaduct.
   Councilwoman Debbie Ortega, noting the rickety old structure is
fated for demolition anyway, said it's probably the best way to get
the job done at low cost to the city.
   Officials casting for ways to attract the film industry to the
state think the idea is wonderful.
   ``We're talking to the economic development people about writing
a couple of ads for Variety and the trade papers,'' said Karol
Smith, director of the Colorado Motion Picture and Television
Advisory Commission. ``Just to say something like, `Does somebody
want to blow up this bridge?'''
   Ortega made the suggestion about two weeks ago at a reception
the commission held for Hollywood production companies coinciding
with the Aspen Film Festival.

   When 11-year-old Misti Mathews bought an
old dictionary at a garage sale, she found more than a wealth of
information inside.
   She found $370 in cash _ including two $100 bills _ stuffed into
the middle of the book, said her mother, Carla Spurgeon.
   Mrs. Spurgeon said her daughter was wide-eyed, and immediately
wanted to return the money to its owner.
   ``She was really concerned about whose it was,'' Mrs. Spurgeon
said. ``She never hesitated. She was never excited about keeping
the money for herself.''
   ``I just said we'd have to return it because it wasn't ours,''
Misti said.
   The family found that the dictionary belonged to Debra and Hank
Tabor of Pineville, the daughter and son-in-law of the woman who
held Saturday's garage sale.
   ``We were really surprised and grateful that the little girl
would be so honest,'' Mrs. Tabor said.
   ``You don't find too many people that would do something like
that anymore,'' she said. ``We have a new baby. I hope we do as
good with him.''
   She said her husband apparently placed the money in the
dictionary for safe keeping years ago, and forgot about it.
   Misti received a $40 reward for her good deed.
   ``And she almost had to be convinced to take that,'' Mrs.
Spurgeon said.
   ``I just told her she didn't have to,'' Misti added.

<HEAD>Health Care Panel Pushing Ahead Despite Threat To Catastrophic Care</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a national commission seeking
solutions to America's health care needs said Thursday the panel
won't be deterred by congressional moves to roll back Medicare
catastrophic illness coverage.
   Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said it was ``hogwash'' to
suggest the Pepper Commission's work will be an empty exercise
because of controversy over a catastrophic-care package that came
under fire from the elderly.
   ``It is precisely the opposite,'' Rockefeller said. ``We have
the chance _ the obligation _ to put catastrophic protection in a
larger context of comprehensive reform, and to make solid, bold
recommendations.''
   The House voted 360-66 on Wednesday to scrap the catastrophic
program, and there also is strong sentiment for repeal in the
Senate. Some advocates for the elderly have expressed concern that
Congress will be wary of tackling the long-term care problem after
getting swamped with complaints about the catastrophic care plan.
   Rockefeller's commission, known formally as the U.S. Bipartisan
Commission on Comprehensive Health Care, is charged with developing
solutions to two of the nation's most pressing health-care
problems: the need of 9 million Americans for long-term care at
home or in nursing homes and the lack of insurance coverage for
more than 31 million Americans.
   At a commission hearing Thursday, Rockefeller said the need for
long-term care protection is ``a problem obviously crying out for
solution'' and which will not go away because of the catastrophic
controversy.
   ``We will not be intimidated or for one moment put off about all
our responsibilities for long term care in all of its forms,'' he
said. ``We simply must forge ahead and mold a solution to long-term
care that has real prospects and that obviously can pass the
Congress.''
   Several groups appearing before the commission renewed calls for
a new social insurance program to protect Americans against the
staggering costs of long-term care, saying private insurance alone
cannot provide adequate and affordable coverage for all.
   Richard Gehring, chairman of the board of directors for the
Alzheimer's Association, said that despite the furor over the
catastrophic package, a nationwide long-term care program would be
welcomed if the costs were spread across society and the benefits
were available to all.
   ``Americans understand that long-term care needs could strike
their family,'' Gehring said. ``In poll after poll and by
overwhelming margins Americans say they would be willing to pay for
long-term care protection.''
   Paul Willging, executive vice president of the American Health
Care Association, which represents nearly 10,000 nursing homes,
called for a public-private long-term care program akin to the mix
of retirement benefits provided Social Security and private
pensions, and for increased Social Security taxes to finance the
new government expenses.
   ``More than anything else, providers want to help bring about a
system whereby patients do not have to become impoverished in order
to qualify for benefits; and where we don't have to turn them away
because of an inability to pay,'' Willging said.
   Carl J. Schramm, president of the Health Insurance Association
of America, which represents 350 commercial insurers, said it would
be ``irresponsible to place the financing burden primarily on the
federal government.'' Schramm said the private insurance market
could be stimulated by making changes in the federal tax code.
   The commission, made up of six senators, six representatives and
three White House appointees, is scheduled to report on its
proposals by March 1.

   TV evangelist Jim Bakker was convicted
today of fleecing followers of $3.7 million so that he could
surround himself with everything from Rolls-Royces to gold-plated
swan-shaped bathroom fixtures.
   A federal jury deliberated a day and a half before convicting
him on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy for overselling time
shares, or ``partnerships,'' at his PTL empire's resort hotels to
loyal followers of his ministry.
   The 49-year-old baby-faced preacher could receive up to 120
years in prison and $5 million in fines at sentencing Oct. 24.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter freed Bakker on $250,000 bail
but said he did so reluctantly because of Bakker supporters' ``Jim
Jones mentality'' _ a reference to the 1978 murder-suicide of 900
cult followers in Jonestown, Guyana.
   Defense attorney George C. Davis said he would appeal.
   Bakker showed little emotion as the verdict was read. Tears
welled in wife Tammy's eyes. As the couple left court, Mrs. Bakker,
who was not charged in the case, sang, ``On Christ, the solid rock
I stand. All other ground is sinking sand.''
   Then she said, ``It's not over until it's over.''
   Prosecutors said Bakker diverted donations and accepted fat
bonuses to live in style, buying fancy cars, Rolex watches,
diamonds, an air-conditioned doghouse and homes with gigantic
walk-in closets, motorized bedroom drapes and a $500 shower curtain.
   ``The message is you can't lie to the people and use television
and the mails to get them to send you money,'' said prosecutor
Deborah Smith. ``It doesn't matter who you are or how well known
you are, you simply can't do it.''
   Jury foreman Ricky Hill said the prosecution ``did an excellent
job. We kept looking for something from the defense and we never
saw it.''
   ``I believe he began in earnest. He was called by God. But
eventually the money became too much for him,'' Hill said. ``He was
a man of God. He got corrupt and I feel sorry for the man.''
   As they awaited the verdict in the courtroom, supporters held
Bibles opened to Psalm 17, which reads: ``Thou hast tried me, and
shalt find nothing.''
   Prosecutors contend Bakker raised $158 million by selling
partnerships at his Heritage USA theme park near Fort Mill, S.C.
Partners typically paid $1,000 for the promise of three nights'
lodging annually at the park.
   The government charged that PTL sold 153,000 partnerships from
1984 to 1987 but that it made only 258 rooms available, that one
large hotel and other promised facilities were never completed and
that many partners couldn't get rooms.
   The prosecution had portrayed Bakker as a con man who cynically
used the nation's airwaves to fleece his followers. The soft-spoken
Bakker depicted himself on the stand as a man of God who was in
over his head when it came to business.
   ``My faith was that he would be set free on all charges,'' said
Bill Fisher, a Bakker supporter in Fort Mill. ``I still believe he
will. I know Jim thinks the same way and God will see him through
it.''
   The Rev. Robert Dugan, a spokesman for the National Association
of Evangelicals, said the conviction may help dispel the
disenchantment many Americans had developed toward religious
broadcasting in general.
   ``If he had managed to get off the hook, it probably would have
left the public with some doubts,'' he said.
   The Rev. Dean M. Kelley, director for religious liberty of the
National Council of Churches, said of the scandal: ``It sort of
Elmer Gantry'd all of us'' _ a reference to the Sinclair Lewis
novel about a con man-preacher.
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell, who briefly took over PTL after Bakker's
downfall, said he was sorry for the Bakkers and others hurt in the
scandal but ``pleased that this dark chapter of religious history
has concluded.''
   ``I am confident that the work of God, which is far bigger than
any one man or church, will flourish in the days and years ahead in
an unprecedented way,'' he said.
   The verdict came after a tumultuous five-week trial that began
Aug. 28.
   Bakker was committed to a mental hospital for a psychiatric
evaluation Aug. 31 after lawyers said he was hallucinating and
cowering with his head under a couch. He was pronounced competent
to stand trial Sept. 6 after a government psychiatrist said he had
had a panic attack. The attack came one day after a PTL
executive-turned-government-witness collapsed on the stand.
   Before the collapse of their $180 million evangelical empire and
Bakker's resignation in 1987 in a sex and money scandal, Jim and
Tammy Bakker were among the most successful of the TV preachers.
They produced the ``PTL Club'' show and built the 2,300-acre theme
park.
   Bakker quit PTL when it was revealed that he had a hotel room
liaison with onetime church secretary Jessica Hahn in 1980 and that
she was paid more than $250,000 in hush money. He later was
defrocked, PTL went into bankruptcy and Heritage USA was closed
after its sale to a Canadian businessman fell through.
   The Bakkers now live in Orlando, Fla., and have been
broadcasting ``The Jim and Tammy Show'' from what had been an
abandoned shopping center.
   ``You can't tell half-truths,'' prosecutor Smith told the jury.
``If you do it, if you use the Postal Service and the public
airwaves you will find yourself in federal court answering charges
of mail and wire fraud. That's why we're here today, because that's
just what Mr. Bakker did.''
   ``The government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
defendant had specific intent to commit fraud,'' said Davis. ``He
was conducting a ministry. He was doing what he thought was vital
to the survival of his ministry.''
   Three former Bakker aides already convicted in the case
testified against him.
   His former second-in-command, Richard Dortch, testified that
Bakker purposedly misled his viewers into buying partnerships he
knew they would never be able to use and said he considered the
partnerships a ``gold mine.''
   Dortch pleaded guilty in a plea bargain and drew an eight-year
prison term and a $200,000 fine.
   Former aides David Taggart and his brother James, the ministry's
decorator, were convicted of evading taxes on $1.1 million in PTL
money used for personal expenditures. David got more than 18 years
in prison and James more than 17.

<HEAD>Bush Urges Angolan Rebel Leader To Negotiate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Thursday urged Angolan rebel
leader Jonas Savimbi to return to the negotiating table and work
out a cease-fire agreement with Angola's Soviet-backed government.
Savimbi promised to comply.
   At the 30-minute White House meeting, Bush pledged U.S. support
for Savimbi and his Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA), but he also admonished the guerrilla chief to end his feud
with Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko.
   Bush has been trying to restore peace between the two sides
whose dispute in recent weeks has threatened the truce agreement
reached last June through Mobutu's mediation. Bush met with Mobutu
Wednesday and delivered a similar admonition.
   ``The president urged Dr. Savimbi to work with President Mobutu
and others in the region to foster the peace process,'' said a
White House statement. ``He noted our long-standing support for a
cease-fire and face-to-face negotiations, and, ultimately, free and
fair elections,'' it said.
   The reference to face-to-face negotiations was directed at
Savimbi, who rejected U.S. urgings to attend a negotiating session
between the sides in Kinshasa, Zaire, last month, one U.S. official
said.
   ``President Bush used the occasion of today's visit to stress
the United States' continued support for UNITA,'' the statement
said. The organization has been getting $40 million or more in
covert U.S. assistance to help it fight the Angolan government.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., complained this week that Mobutu has
disrupted the arms shipments, which flow primarily through his
territory, in order to pressure Savimbi into negotiating with
Angola's government.
   Mobutu, while saying publicly that he has received everything
the United States promised, indicated to reporters Wednesday that
he and the United States are divided on the question of continued
U.S. supplies to UNITA.
   The administration, under heavy pressure from conservatives in
Congress, has vowed to continue aiding the rebels until the
government agrees to hold free elections that would give UNITA a
chance at the polls.
   Angola's government argues that priority must be given to
Savimbi's ouster and consolidation of a peace agreement with UNITA
before embarking on a change in the one-party system and eventual
elections.
   The feud between Savimbi and Mobutu revolves around conflicting
claims of what was agreed to by Angola and UNITA at the Gbadolite
summit, attended by 18 African leaders. Angolan President Eduardo
dos Santos, backed by Mobutu, contends Savimbi undertook to step
down from his post and to integrate his forces into Angola's
military.
   Savimbi has denied that interpretation, contending he would not
have agreed to such terms in light of UNITA's superiority on the
battle field.
   He said Bush too had assured him that he ``does not accept those
conceptions of exile, integration.''
   But, emerging from his talk with Bush, Savimbi also said he was
ready to resume negotiations with Angola under Zairean mediation.
``I think very soon ... we are going to come together,'' he said.
   Savimbi said he would also ``meet very soon'' with Mobutu ``and
all the problems will be sorted out.''

<HEAD>Plans Syndicated Talk Show for Warner's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson plans to be the host of a
weekly, one-hour television program scheduled to begin next fall
that will give a platform to ``those whose voices have been locked
out.''
   Plans for the syndicated program, ``Voices of America with Jesse
Jackson,'' were announced Thursday at a news conference by Jackson
and Dick Robertson, president of Warner Bros. Television
Distribution, which will market the show.
   Jackson said his goal on the show will be to ``create access,
precipitate ideas and be fair.''
   ``It's not so much the national conclusions that we seek as we
seek the national debate, to open up the great and critical issues
of our day,'' said the civil rights leader and former presidential
candidate.
   Jackson said he wanted to break the narrowness of current
television in which ``fewer and fewer people talk about more and
more and often know less and less.''
   He suggested that along with powerful political voices from
abroad, he also would offer access to such people as striking coal
miners, or to family farmers and the rural bankers who must
foreclose on them, or teachers who face a coming generation of
crack-addicted children.
   Neither a format nor a home base for the program has been worked
out, nor has Warner begun lining up stations, said Robertson.
   Van Gordon Sauter, former president of CBS News, and Quincy
Jones, the musician and recording executive, will be executive
producers of the program.
   Sauter said it is likely that the show will combine elements of
the talk, magazine and interview formats.
   ``I think given the uniqueness of the talent (Jackson), the
breadth of his curiosities, of his knowledge of people and his
contacts, it is not a broadcast that is going to easily fit into
what are the normal categories,'' said Sauter.
   Jackson declined to disclose what he would earn from the show.
``We're into private enterprise now, you know. We'll let you know
at the appropriate time,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Randall Terry, the former used car
salesman who founded the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, is
no stranger to jail, even listing his 35 arrests on a resume he
distributes to reporters.
   The 30-year-old activist has spent more than 90 days in jail for
his role in demonstrations in Binghamton, Atlanta and Los Angeles.
   That length of time soon could be extended. Terry, offered the
option of paying a fine for criminal trespass and unlawful assembly
in Atlanta during the Democratic National Convention in 1988, said
Thursday he'd rather spend two years in jail.
   ``I think he will use the experience to his advantage in terms
of a martyr image,'' said Margaret Johnston, administrator at the
Southern Tier Women's Services in Binghamton, a clinic that
performs abortions, where Terry was first arrested in 1986 for
chaining himself to a sink.
   Terry was born and raised outside Rochester, N.Y. He left home
at age 17 for a cross-country trip, dreaming of being a rock
musician. He returned a born-again Christian.
   He and his wife, Cindy, who met at Bible school, have one
biological child and three foster children. They settled in
Binghamton and Terry began selling cars, a job he gave up when
Operation Rescue became too time-consuming.
   The Terrys began their anti-abortion crusading by standing
outside Johnston's clinic in 1984, trying to talk women out of
entering. As supporters joined them, the clinic was used as a
testing ground for new demonstration techniques.
   Operation Rescue demonstrators stand or sit in front of abortion
clinics, refuse orders to leave and force police to drag them away.
   ``We cry that abortion is murder, it's child-killing, and yet we
carry a picket once or twice a year and write a few letters. That's
not an adequate response to murder,'' the lean, bushy-haired Terry
said in an interview. ``A logical response to murder is physical
intervention on behalf of the victim.''
   Terry spent most of a 22-day jail term in Binghamton in 1986
writing a book on his cause, like his hero, Martin Luther King.
He's working on another book, said spokeswoman Barbara Magera.
   ``I do think jail will be a real hardship for him,'' Johnston
said. ``I know that when he was in jail in Binghamton he really
hated it. I think he just hates that kind of discipline and
authority and you can't get around that in a jail.''

   More than 600 plants native to North America
have been donated to Spain to help celebrate the 500th anniversary
of the landing of Columbus in the New World, the Agriculture
Department said Thursday.
   Horticulturist Sylvester March of the National Arboretum said
the plants will join similar contributions from South and Central
America as part of the 1992 World's Fair in Seville. The plants
will be used in the landscaping and park areas around the
exposition's grounds on La Cartuja Island near Seville.
   March said the 600 specimens are representative of many parts of
North America and were shipped this year to give them time to reach
full development by the exposition's opening in 1992.
   The arboretum's selection ranged from the agave, a hardy
succulent, to the palmetto, he said. All of the plants are suited
to Seville's Mediterranean climate.

   The rise and fall of television evangelist Jim
Bakker had elements of a tragedy played out on a stage where
religion in America, particularly evangelicalism, was an unwitting
participant.
   ``It's a tide that lowers all boats,'' said the Rev. Dean M.
Kelley, director for religious liberty of the National Council of
Churches. ``It sort of Elmer Gantry'd all of us.''
   Bakker was convicted Thursday on 24 counts of fraud and
conspiracy. But before his resignation 2{ years ago, he had ridden
a wave of success, building a single television station the PTL
satellite network and a multimillion-dollar empire.
   His crowning achievement was to be the Heritage USA Christian
theme park, but instead it led to his downfall. He was convicted of
fleecing followers of $3.7 million by overselling time shares at
his ministry's resort hotels.
   Religion observers were divided Thursday over the impact of the
Bakker affair, which has drawn substantial media attention since
March 1987, when Bakker resigned as PTL president after confessing
to a sexual encounter with former church secretary Jessica Hahn.
   Church leaders at the Assemblies of God, which defrocked Bakker
in May 1987, declined to comment on the fallen evangelist's
conviction.
   ``The church did what it had to do in 1987 and we feel we have
put that behind us and we are going on with the business of the
church,'' said Juleen Turnage, spokeswoman for the 2.5
million-member denomination.
   The church last month established a 10-year Decade of Harvest
program to evangelize 5 million people, open 5,000 new churches and
train 20,000 new ministers.
   James M. Wall, editor of The Christian Century, a liberal
Protestant publication, said Bakker ``was using religion to sell
his product. I never have felt that it was religion on trial here.''
   While the element of religion may have heightened public
interest in the case, Wall said, ``It just means that the
institution of religion, like the institution of law, the
institution of medicine, has people in it that are going to take
advantage of their profession to cheat the public.''
   Others said the Bakker affair left more permanent scars.
   ``The significance is that, unfortunately, it has disenchanted
many Americans with religious broadcasting in general,'' said the
Rev. Robert Dugan, director of public affairs for the National
Association of Evangelicals.
   But Dugan said Bakker's conviction may provide an opportunity
for religious groups to put the episode behind them.
   ``If he had managed to get off the hook, it probably would have
left the public with some doubts,'' Dugan said.
   Though he compared Bakker to Gantry, the title character in
Sinclair Lewis' novel about a fallen evangelist, Kelley said he
never thought Bakker was a charlatan.
   ``I think that it has elements of tragedy about it in the sense
that he was, maybe still is, a very gifted personality,'' Kelley
said.
   The evangelist, could receive up to 120 years in prison and $5
million in fines at sentencing Oct. 24, may have just been
overwhelmed by the fiscal demands of his empire, according to
Kelley.
   ``I guess it was kind of like juggling cannonballs, and he may
have been distracted by some mundane temptations, and they came
through the floor and brought down the house, as it were.''

   About 30 human rights activists
seized the Costa Rican Embassy in the capital today to protest
policies of President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist government they
regard as repressive.
   It was not immediately known if they were armed. A spokeswoman
for the activists said they had no weapons, but embassy sources
said they were armed, and initial police reports said some were
heavily armed.
   Several embassy workers remained inside the building, but it was
not immediately clear if they were being held hostage.
   No violence was immediately reported.
   ``We are here to denounce human rights violations and so that
the Costa Rican government pressures Cirstiani to end the
repression against the people,'' a spokeswoman for the activists
said in an interview.
   The woman, who refused to give her name, said the group planned
to stay at the embassy until their demands were met. The group
calls itself The Federation of Committees of Mothers and Relatives
of Political Prisoners, Disappeared and Assassinated People of El
Salvador.
   AP reporters at the scene saw about 15 activists, including some
women, in the lobby of the embassy offices, on the third floor of
the Central American Building in the west side of the capital.
   None of them appeared to be armed. A Costa Rican diplomat, who
demanded anonymity, said there were about 15 more inside the
embassy and some of them were armed. He said he could not give
further details.
   The Federation of Committees is a leftist influenced
organization that has been active in the country for the past eight
years, protesting the kidnapping and killing of suspected leftists
by rightist death squads.
   More than 70,000 people have been killed since a leftist
guerrilla war began a decade ago, and human rights groups say a
large number of the victims have been civilians slain by the death
squads.
   Initial police and embassy reports said the embassy was taken
over by six heavily armed men.
   ``The embassy has been seized,'' another Costa Rican official at
the embassy told The Associated Press in an earlier telex
interview. ``They have forbidden us to talk. They are heavily
armed.''
   ``They are holding our diplomatic personnel here. The men are
armed and they say they belong to a group called CEMASAL. That's
all we can say, we are not allowed to talk,'' the person said
before the telex line was cut off.
   CEMASAL is not among leftist or rightist organizations operating
in El Salvador, and it had not been heard of before today.

<HEAD>A Sweetie But Not Easy to Like</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The title character of ``Sweetie,'' an
Australian tragicomedy which recently opened at the New York Film
Festival, is not, on the surface, easy to like.
   Played by Genevieve Lemon, making her film debut, Sweetie is a
frightened, possibly schizophrenic, young woman barely capable of
taking care of herself. Vulnerable, openly suffering, she receives
little support from her withdrawn sister, Kay (Karen Colston), and
her well-intentioned but insensitive parents (John Darling and
Dorothy Barry).
   But as Lemon explained at a news conference following a recent
screening of the movie, she saw the positive qualities of Sweetie,
her need for love and understanding, her desire to connect with a
family that doesn't seem to want her around.
   ``Karen (Colston) and I would have discussions,'' Lemon said,
``and we would come to the positions of defending our characters.
   ``We would defend them so strongly. She would say her character
had to live with such a difficult person. I would say people were
so cruel to Sweetie.''
   Lemon worried that the audience would be cruel as well, that
Sweetie's obesity and crudity would produce laughter in the wrong
places. It was her job, the actress said, to make sure that Sweetie
was viewed sympathetically.
   ``I'm pleased Sweetie isn't such a repugnant character,'' Lemon
said. ``I think it's important not just to get laughs, but to have
some dignity as well.''
   Colston, Barry and director Jane Campion also make their feature
film debuts in ``Sweetie,'' and, though not credited, trees are
supporting stars as well.
   They're referred to in dialogue: ``Trees scare me, they have
hidden powers,'' Kay says at the beginning. They are a symbol of
hope for Kay's boyfriend (Tom Lycos), and provide a haven for
Sweetie when the world threatens to overwhelm her.
   Lemon said one of the film's themes was how the characters were
unable, or unwilling, to open up to each other.
   ``Australians are reluctant to seek help of any kind.
Pyschoanalysts are not part of Australian culture. For Sweetie, it
so easily could have been another way. But the attitude was, `At
all costs, don't bring in outsiders.'''
   The film is dedicated to Campion's sister. Lemon quickly noted,
to much laughter, that the director's sister was not like
``Sweetie,'' but was actually a filmmaker.
   ``The character was inspired by a relative of Gerry's
(screenplay writer Lee). Jane knew him also and they developed his
character into Sweetie.
   ``Actually, during the filming, there was a family crisis and
Jane's sister really came through. That made the dedication even
more touching.''
   `Sweetie'' is scheduled for an early-1990 release by Avenue
Pictures.

   The House today approved a $22.7 billion
expansion of federal aid for child care after beating back an
effort by Republicans and Southern Democrats to strip out
requirements for health, safety and quality standards.
   On a 230-195 vote, Democratic leaders defeated an
administration-endorsed substitute by Rep. Charles Stenholm,
D-Texas, aimed at striking provisions to make states regulate child
care centers and provide annual training for their workers.
   The vote left the House carrying two separate child care

   Both packages provide two-thirds of the new child care aid

become a vehicle for a wide variety of unrelated proposals,
including a reduction in capital gains taxes and the repeal of a
year-old catastrophic health care program for the elderly.
   To defeat Stenholm's approach, Democratic leaders had to promise
they would abandon language prohibiting aid for ``any sectarian

   More than 600 East Germans chanting
``Deutschland!'' and shouting thanks left a Warsaw train station
Thursday for new lives in the West, rejecting East Germany on the
eve of the communist state's 40th anniversary.
   Poland contributed two extra cars to a six-car East German train
sent to carry the refugees to West Germany, where they
automatically will be accepted as citizens.
   The train pulled out of Gdansk Station in northern Warsaw at
7:22 p.m. On board was Johannes Bauch, the No. 2 diplomat at West
Germany's embassy in Warsaw, to guarantee their safe passage
through East Germany to Helmstadt on the West German side of the
border.
   It was the second train of refugees to leave Poland in less than
a week. A train carrying 809 left early Sunday.
   Thousands more were allowed to emigrate to West Germany after
packing the West German Embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia.
   According to West German diplomats, there were at least 633
refugees on the latest train to leave Warsaw.
   East Germany largely sealed off the border to Poland this week,
and many refugees swam the Oder or Neisse rivers or hiked overland
across the border to reach Warsaw. Others were allowed into Poland
by virtue of previously issued documents or close family ties here.
   ``I don't think it is going to be the last train. I wish for the
sake of all future refugees that there will be more trains,'' said
Andrzej Szczerba, 38, a naturalized East German citizen who has
lived and worked in East Germany since 1983. He left with his wife.
   ``I had everything in East Germany except for freedom,'' said
another man, a Polish citizen who had lived in East Germany 15
years and was fleeing to West Germany with his East German wife and
two teen-age sons.
   In the cars, waiting to leave, many of the East Germans munched
sandwiches or sipped beer. One burly German, spotting Polish TV
cameras, leaned out the window and shouted in heavily accented
Polish, ``Thank you, Polonia!''
   The sentiment was repeated by West German Ambassador Franz
Joachim Schoeller after the train pulled out.
   ``I think what the Poles have been doing for us is just
wonderful. And they have been helping from the very first moment,
since the movement started,'' he said.
   The Polish government _ the first East bloc government not led
by communists _ has promised West Germany that none of the refugees
will be sent back home against their will.
   But it also has tried not to strain relations with East Germany,
a Warsaw Pact ally that controls Poland's land access to Western
Europe and is celebrating its 40th anniversary this weekend. Poland
said the problem of the refugees should be solved between the two
German states.
   For many refugees, the train trip was a step into the unknown.
   A 27-year-old woman, who said she swam the Oder River into
Poland on Thursday morning, said she came empty-handed.
   ``I don't have any baggage, no underwear or socks. Not even
shoes. All I have are my papers,'' she said.
   ``I have a good head and a good pair of hands. In East Germany,
I had to work. And there, I will have to work too. ... I want to
get a job and find an apartment, a small one, right away. And I
just want to see everything.''

<HEAD>Brando Says Studio Sold Him Out on `Dry White Season'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marlon Brando says that the studio which made
his new movie ``A Dry White Season'' weakened the film's
anti-apartheid message in order to make more money.
   In an interview to be shown on ``Saturday Night With Connie
Chung'' this weekend, Brando says MGM-UA excised crucial scenes
from the movie.
   ``In my view they made decisions about cutting `A Dry White
Season' which I think diminished the value of the picture and they
did not take into consideration the benefits that might befall
people in Africa who are suffering as a result of the policies of
apartheid,'' says Brando, according to a transcript supplied by CBS
News.
   ``I think they made a money decision. If I know corporate
executives, especially in the movie business, I know they were
thinking of the money.''
   Mary Stevens Hardy, MGM-UA's director of corporate
communications, did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
   Brando has blasted MGM-UA in the past few days, telling the
trade newspaper Variety that he had asked the studio to replace the
cut scenes and they had refused.
   ``They're hoping I will go away like some evil wind,'' Brando
tells Miss Chung. ``But they're mistaken because I'm not gonna go
away. This is life and death. This is real life. We're talking
about human relations. We're talking about human rights. We're
addressing ourselves to racial issues ... and that's why I care,
because it's not for money.''

<TEXT>
   The number of cases of Lyme disease doubled in a
year's time, and precautions such as bug spray may not be practical
for people at risk for months on end, federal health officials said
Thursday.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported a record 4,572
cases of the tick-borne disease last year, chiefly in the
Northeast. That's nearly twice as high as in 1987, when 2,368 cases
were reported, and up more than ninefold from 1982's 492 cases.
   ``Certainly, it is on the increase,'' said Dr. Robert Craven, a
Colorado-based Lyme disease specialist with the CDC. ``Everyone who
lives in an area where Lyme disease is probable should be aware of
it and take the necessary precautions.''
   In 1987-88, 80 percent of the U.S. cases were reported in six
Northeastern states: New York, New Jersey, Connecticut,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. New York state alone
reported 56 percent of the 1988 cases, and two counties in the
suburbs around New York City _ Westchester and Suffolk _ reported
44 percent.
   The disease can cause rash, aches and even life-threatening
heart disturbances. Most cases occur in the warm weather months,
when the tick problem is worst.
   The increasing case count is probably due not only to spread of
the disease, but also to increased awareness and reporting, the
agency noted.
   Health professionals recommend protective clothing and insect
repellent to guard against ticks carrying the disease, but in some
high-risk areas that may not be realistic, the Atlanta-based CDC
said.
   ``In suburban areas where (Lyme disease) is endemic, infection
may be acquired principally around ... residences, and risk of
exposure may be continuous during the transmission season,'' the
agency noted.
   ``Under these circumstances, certain personal protection
measures (such as) the daily application of repellents may not be
practical.''
   The CDC also said Thursday that health officials in New York and
Connecticut have reported five cases of seizures in people who used
insect repellent products containing N,N-diethyle-m-toluamide, or
DEET.
   DEET, present in many best-selling bug sprays, has been marketed
in this country since 1956 and is used by 50 million to 100 million
people each year, the CDC said.
   ``Obviously, this needs to be looked at in perspective,'' Craven
said.
   Four of the five seizure patients _ all of whom recovered
quickly _ were under 8 years old; three of the cases were reported
by the same pediatric neurologist.
   The CDC recommended not applying insect repellent in large
quantities to exposed skin, especially in children.
   The developments have left researchers wondering how best to
attack the Lyme disease problem.
   ``That's the area we're actively looking at right now _ what
sort of modifications to the environment around the home can be
made,'' Craven said.
   It's recommended that suburbanites clear their yards of leaves
and debris, which can harbor tick-carrying rodents. Scientists also
are studying ways to wage chemical warfare against ticks, he said.

   A team of federal investigators began
work Thursday to determine the cause of an explosion touched off
when a fishing boat struck a submerged pipeline, killing three
people and leaving eight missing.
   Three people, including the pilot and captain, were injured.
   ``We want to document what has happened before the vessel is
moved,'' said Mike Benson, a spokesman for the six-member team from
the National Transportation Safety Board. ``The main task is to
secure perishable information and tap the memories of the survivors
while the incident is still fresh.''
   The 160-foot fishing vessel North Umberland blew up Tuesday less
than a mile off Sabine Pass while trawling in about 5 feet of
water. Authorities have speculated that its nets snagged the
16-inch natural gas pipeline and ruptured it, triggering the blast
and virtually incinerating everything on the boat.
   ``There's a good chance there is little if any of the logs on
board,'' Benson said. ``But we want to see any documentation.''
   Some navigation charts of the area list all submerged pipelines
while others are not as detailed. The boat was not in a restricted
area, Coast Guard Lt. Scott LaRochelle said.
   The federal investigators, along with owners of the ship and the
pipeline and officials from the U.S. Department of Transportation's
Office of Pipeline Safety, split up into small teams Thursday to
inspect the ship and the broken pipeline, and to interview the
survivors, two of whom were hospitalized in nearby Beaumont.
   The Coast Guard suspended the search for the missing crewmen
Wednesday, about 24 hours after the blast. Texas Department of
Parks and Wildlife rangers, however, continued to patrol sections
of remote beach Thursday in four-wheel-drive vehicles, looking for
bodies that could have washed ashore, said Bob Heitman, a
department game warden.
   Officials said everything on the ship that could burn was burned
and reduced to ashes in the intense blaze and suggested the missing
crewmen either were incinerated or blown off the boat.
   A Coast Guard team that specializes in hazardous materials
boarded the ship Wednesday to make certain toxic anhydrous ammonia
_ used as a refrigerant on the fishing boat _ did not linger in the
air or water.
   The Cameron, La.-based ``pogy boat'' caught pogy or menhaden,
inedible fish used for poultry feed and fertilizer, and was owned
by Zapata Heynie Corp. of Houston.
   The pipeline is owned by Natural Gas Pipeline of America Inc.,
based in Lombard, Ill.

   News coverage of the abortion debate too
often focuses on extreme positions and ignores the ``uncertain
middle,'' a panel told newspaper editors today.
   Mary Ann Glendon, a Harvard Law School professor and vice
president of the International Society of Family Law, compared the
abortion debate to a peanut butter and jelly sandwich between two
hard pieces of bread.
   ``I would favor a little more coverage of the peanut butter and
jelly people of the world,'' she told an audience at a panel
discussion of abortion coverage during The Associated Press
Managing Editors convention.
   She said she was referring to ``people with ambivalence on the
issue ... the uncertain middle.''
   She also said there is room for political compromise on the
issue, as seen in western Europe, where legislative bodies have
made abortion readily available in the early weeks of pregnancy,
with the procedure becoming more regulated as the pregnancy
progresses. Such laws are in line with a 1973 Supreme Court ruling
now under attack.
   ``If you turn the matter over to the legislatures the roof does
not cave in,'' she said.
   Cory Richards, vice president for public policy for the Alan
Guttmacher Institute and a board member of such organizations as
the National Abortion Rights Action League, said abortion is just
one family planning option _ he called it ``the last stop on the
train'' _ and that it is not enough to present the issue as being
one people can be only for or against.
   It is not fair to equate abortion with reproductive rights, said
Richards, who urged editors to explore related issues such as
teen-age pregnancy, sex education, contraceptives' safety and the
progress of family planning legislation in Congress.
   Editors have the power to either increase polarization or
encourage debate on the issue, said Mary Mahowald, a professor of
biomedical ethics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.
   She said she is annoyed when a pollster asks if a person is for
or against abortion without providing choices for different
circumstances, such as the stage of the pregnancy or the health or
well-being of the woman.
   ``Abortion is an issue filled with opportunity for bias,'' she
said.
   ``I see lots of coverage of extreme behavior'' by both sides,
``but what's inappropriate is to present those biases as if they
represent the whole picture.''

   Friends and relatives of people who have died
of AIDS will add 300 names this weekend to a huge quilt that
already memorializes more than 12,000 other victims, the project's
founder said Thursday.
   ``We're here to attempt to illustrate the enormity of the
worldwide AIDS crisis,'' said Cleve Jones, executive director of
the Names Project Foundation.
   ``And we want to do so by revealing the names and the faces and
the lives that are behind these statistics,'' Jones said at a news
conference to begin the third annual weekend of activities, which
will include a candlelight march Saturday from the Ellipse near the
Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial.
   As of Aug. 31, there were 105,990 Americans who had been
diagnosed with AIDS and more than half, or 61,655, have died since
June 1, 1981, according to the national Centers for Disease Control.
   In 1987, Jones originated the idea for the quilt, which will be
on display for the last time in the nation's capital.
   The quilt consists of 10,848 panels, each measuring 3 feet by 6
feet. It will be unfolded on the Ellipse on Friday when each person
whose name appears on it will be read aloud.
   The quilt, which has 13 miles of canvas edging and 49 miles of
walkway fabric, weighs 13 tons. Victims from 19 countries are
represented. Items such as credit cards, wedding rings, stuffed
animals, curtains, human hair and cremation ashes are woven into t

   The state that made salad a main course,
lifted avocados beyond guacamole and introduced kiwis to American
kitchens saluted those who had made major contributions to
California's gustatory scene.
   In a glittering awards program Wednesday night sponsored by the
American Institute of Wine and Food, 240 epicures paid $60 a plate
to dine on a staggering variety of delicacies and hear the top
citation, for education, go to master-of-ceremonies Narsai David.
   ``Food and wine has become an important part of our society,''
said David, food authority, wine expert, shopkeeper, three-star
restaurateur and commentator in the San Francisco Bay area for 25
years.
   ``Northern California has been in the forefront of new ideas and
developments in cuisine,'' he told the crowd at the Californian
Culinary Academy. ``What was called `California cuisine' has become
American cuisine _ freshly prepared superb ingredients, frequently
served with the very simplest of sauces.''
   There was room for non-culinary topics as well: waves of
applause greeted David's announcement that the San Francisco Giants
had thrashed the Chicago Cubs 11-3 in the first game of the
National League Championship Series.
   Other winners among the 10 Wine and Food Achievement, or
``Wafie'' awards included Jerry DiVeccchio of Sunset Magazine, for
literature and journalism; winemaker Zelma Long of Simi Winery;
chef Alice Waters of Chez Panisse; pioneer California oyster
farmers Michael Watchorn and John Finger; and Chuck Williams of
Williams-Sonoma, the kitchen accessory chain whose glossy catalog
is mailed to 77 million people.
   The guests got down to the more serious business of the evening
after digging into hors d'oeuvres that included smoked chicken with
honey mustard; grape leaves stuffed with salmon, fried artichokes,
goat cheese with sun-dried tomatoes, and sauteed Texas venison
marinated in cabernet.
   After those noshes, they sat down to San Francisco Delta
crayfish with caviar dressing, quail and lentils, and rack of lamp
with elephant garlic. The courses were accompanied by select
chardonnay, pinot noir and cabernet sauvignon. All the foods and
wines were donated.
   A hot topic was how much damage a severe storm Sept. 16-17 dealt
to what was expected to be a top-quality crop of America's best
white wine grapes.
   ``Instead of a bumper crop and record prices, the industry is
faced with a dramatic change in expectations'' in Napa, Sonoma and
Mendocino counties, said wine economist Jon Fredrikson.
   From Monterey south, however, growing areas of the better grapes
were not harmed, he said.
   A veteran Napa Valley red grape grower said some vineyards,
including those in the vaunted Carneros district of the south
valley, may have lost as much as 40 percent of their white grapes.

   About $150 million worth of gold recovered
from a 19th-century shipwreck came ashore and was loaded into
armored trucks Thursday, under the eyes of armed guards and happy
investors in the salvage project.
   Several hundred people watched while crewmen of the recovery
ship Arctic Discoverer unloaded crates bearing more than a ton of
gold coins and bars found in the wreckage of the SS Central America.
   The sidewheel steamer sank about 200 miles off South Carolina
during a hurricane on Sept. 12, 1857. It was carrying California
gold to New York when it went down, killing 425 of the 578 people
aboard.
   The Columbus America Discovery Group, which has more than 120
investors, located the wreck three years ago and found the main
gold storage area this summer.
   ``It is a magnificent national treasure, to be cherished, to be
shared,'' Bob Evans, a project director, said during a welcoming
ceremony where a sampling of the shiny gold coins and bars sat on a
table.
   The group expects to recover more gold from the wreck, at a
depth of 1{ miles, when the weather improves next summer.
   The booty will be shared among the investors if U.S. District
Court grants them ownership, said Richard Robol, attorney for the
group. The court already has given the group rights to ship
artifacts, including a 300-pound bell, recovered before June 30.
   Robol said 45 insurance firms have filed claims for the
treasure, contending they have ties to the 19th century insurance
companies that paid more than $1.2 million in claims after the ship
sank.
   Not all of the ship's gold has been recovered and its exact
value has yet to be determined. The ship was carrying more than
three tons of gold, which would be worth about $450 million at
today's prices.
   In addition, many passengers were carrying individual fortunes
they had made in California, so the ship's total treasure could be
worth up to $1 billion, shipwreck experts have said.
   Tom Thompson, the project's principal director, said 120
investors have rights to two-thirds of the booty with the rest
going to a small group of the project participants, including
himself, Evans and Barry Schatz, another project director. They
were reluctant to talk about how much money they hope to make from
the salvage operation, which has cost about $10 million.
   ``We hope to be rich,'' Thompson said simply.
   ``It was an interesting, fascinating gamble,'' said Bill Cook, a
Columbus, Ohio, businessmen who was one of the original investors.
``I'm not feeling smug. I feel lucky.''
   Investors paid from $5,000 to $50,000 for a share of the project.
   Thompson, an ocean engineer, said much of the gold remains
hidden at the bottom of the wreck, but salvagers were surprised
that so much of the treasure was easily visible at the site.
   ``The gold is on top of beams and falling off beams,'' he said.
   ``We're recovering coins from the Central America that look as
if they were minted yesterday,'' Evans said.

   Israeli leaders met for six hours Thursday but
failed to decide whether to accept an Egyptian offer to hold peace
talks with Palestinians in Cairo.
   The left-leaning Labor Party of Vice Premier Shimon Peres
proposed accepting such a meeting to discuss Israel's plan to start
the negotiating process with elections for the 1.7 million
Palestinians in the occupied territories.
   But Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and his right-wing Likud Bloc
opposed the participation of Palestinians from outside the occupied
lands, especially deported activists as suggested by Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
   The 12-man inner Cabinet, the decision-making body of the
coalition government, was scheduled to continue its discussion on
Friday.
   Shamir and his supporters said the presence of outside
Palestinians would implicitly recognize the Palestine Liberation
Organization's demand to allow millions of exiled refugees to
return to what is now Israel.
   But Mohammed Bassiouny, Egypt's ambassador to Israel, said in an
interview ``without Palestinians from the outside it will never
work.''
   In Cairo, Mubarak said he would agree to a summit with Shamir
when the ground was adequately prepared. Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel-Meguid said U.S. envoys would soon be dispatched to Egypt and
Israel.
   The most likely compromise for winning majority support was a
proposal by Secretary of State James Baker to Foreign Minister
Moshe Arens that called for three-way consultations on the
composition of a Palestinian delegation, according to ministers who
spoke after the meeting.
   Yossi Ahimier, a spokesman for Shamir, said Likud had accepted
the idea ``that the prime minister will be in contact with the
Americans and will hear their proposals and we will judge later
what is good for us.''
   The proposal by Likud's Arens appeared workable, Labor's Moshe
Shahal. ``We would like to see it in writing and then maybe it can
be accepted by the majority.''
   Speaking to reporters after the session, Shahal said if the
government rejects the proposal to talk to Palestinians, Labor
would pull out of the unity government and call for early Israeli
elections which are not scheduled until 1992.
   But Peres said the party wants to avoid a crisis that would
break up the coalition government. ``Please stop withall your
nonsense about us trying to make the government fall. That is not
our intention,'' Peres told reporters.
   Labor has embraced Mubarak's proposal for the meeting and a
10-point plan that calls for trading territories for peace. His
plan also calls for a freeze on Jewish settlements and
participation of east Jerusalem Arabs in the voting.

<HEAD>Central Park Jogger Offered to Help Prosecutors Investigate Her Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A jogger who was raped and beaten almost to
death by a gang of youths on a rampage in Central Park has offered
to talk to prosecutors about the April attack.
   Prosecutors had feared the victim, a 28-year-old investment
banker, would be unable to help them because of the injuries and
impaired memory she suffered in the assault.
   The woman, now in physical and psychiatric rehabilitation at
Gaylord Hospital in Wallingford, Conn., was smashed several times
in the head with a rock as the teen-agers took turns raping her.
Six youths have been indicted in the assault.
   A Metropolitan Hospital psychiatric report dated June 2 and
signed by Dr. Mary Ann Cohen, which prosecutors will likely offer
as evidence, said the victim was ``able to appropriately discuss
the idea of speaking to the district attorney if it will help with
the investigation.''
   But the report, a copy of which was obtained Wednesday, also
appeared to justify prosecutors' fears. ``I don't know what
happened,'' Cohen quotes the victim as saying, ``and maybe I will
never know, but I know I was attacked and I will just have to
accept it and deal with it.''
   A defense lawyer, who spoke on condition his name not be used,
said the only reason the prosecution would call the victim with her
impaired memory would be for ``the emotional effect'' on the jury.
   Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau says no decision
has been made about whether to call the jogger as a witness.
   In another development, a 15-year-old boy charged in the rampage
pleaded guilty to robbery Thursday and implicated six other
teen-agers in an attack the same night on a male jogger in Central
Park.
   The plea, the first in the case, was entered by Jermaine
Robinson, 15, as part of a deal with the prosecution to drop six
other counts.
   John Loughlin, 40, a banker, was knocked down and robbed of his
radio as he jogged around the reservoir in the park.

   Episcopal Bishop John T. Walker was remembered
Thursday as ``a man of peace'' and a fighter for the oppressed at a
funeral attended by President Bush, South African Archbishop
Desmond Tutu and several thousand other mourners.
   The service in the Washington National Cathedral followed
Walker's death last Saturday, the same day the cathedral he served
began a yearlong celebration of its completion after 83 years of
construction.
   Walker, who was 64, died after heart surgery.
   Hundreds of clergy filled the cathedral nave. Tutu joined Bishop
Edmond Lee Browning, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church,
and the Right Rev. Ronald H. Haines, bishop pro tem of Washington,
in celebrating the solemn high service.
   Bush and wife Barbara sat in the front pew opposite Walker's
widow, Maria, and the couple's three children.
   In a front pew on the side sat the Rev. Jesse Jackson, District
of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry and his family, and Delegate Walter
Fauntroy, the district's non-voting representative in Congress.
   ``The world has lost a man of peace,'' said Haines during the
service.
   In a homily, the Rev. Edgar Romig, a longtime friend, recalled
Walker as ``a fighter for the Lord,'' who toiled on behalf of the
poor and oppressed both here in the nation's capital and abroad.
   Bush did not speak at the service, but he and his wife took
communion. The Bushes are Episcopalians.
   Walker's body had been cremated. The ashes were placed on the
high altar in a black slate urn covered by a white linen cloth an
hour before the service. Nearby were his miter and pastoral staff.
   The congregation sang several of Walker's favorite hymns, and
the service ended with Aaron Copland's ``Fanfare for the Common
Man.''
   After the homily, the Howard University Choir sang a spiritual,
and the walls of the cathedral echoed the plea of student soprano,
Sonja Teal: ``O when I come to die, give me Jesus.''
   Romig, once a canon at the cathedral with Walker, recalled that
Walker had been the first black student at Virginia Th.
   _Worcester Polytechnic Institute of Massachusetts, Wake Forest
University of North Carolina, Illinois Wesleyan University and
Trinity University of Texas were named the best of the 562 regional
colleges and universities.
   _Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., and Harvey Mudd College in
Claremont, Calif., are the nation's top business and engineering
specialty schools, respectively.
   U.S. News said the colleges and universities were ranked on
their records in five key areas, including quality of the student
body and faculty, reputation for academic excellence and financial
resources.
   About 60 percent of the 3,879 college presidents, deans of
academic affairs and deans of admission polled at 1,294 schools
responded to the U.S. News survey on academic reputation. The
magazine used objective statistical measures to determine the
schools' performance.
   Following Yale as top national universities were Princeton
University, Harvard College and Radcliffe College, California
Institute of Technology, Duke University, Stamford University,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dartmouth College,
University of Chicago and Rice University.
   Top liberal-arts colleges, behind Swarthmore College, were
Amherst, Williams, Pomona, Bryn Mawr, Wellesley, Smith, Wesleyan,
Oberlin and Grinnell.
   For the first time, U.S. News asked college presidents and
administrators to identify the country's up-and-coming schools.

   A small painting by French
Impressionist Auguste Renoir has been stolen from a Brusels art
museum, police said Thursday.
   The 6-inch-by-7-inch ``Nude'' was cut from its frame, a
spokesman for the museum said. A guard discovered the theft around
6 p.m. Tuesday. He immediately alerted the museum director who
ordered all doors closed and called the police.
   Police searched the museum and the 200 tourists still in the
building but found nothing.
   The museum is short of personnel and each guard has to watch
three rooms at the same time.
   Museum officials had no precise estimate of the painting's
value, but said it was worth at least $100,000.

   The Dalai Lama, spiritual and temporal
leader of Tibet whose title means Ocean of Mercy, won the 1989
Nobel Peace Prize on Thursday for decades of non-violent struggle
to free his country from China.
   ``My case is nothing special. I am a simple Buddhist monk _ no
more, no less,'' he said, adding he hoped the award would focus
attention on compassion in every human being.
   One clear purpose of the Norwegian Nobel committee was to
deliver a message of support to the pro-democracy movement in
China. The Beijing government called the award an insult and
interference in its internal affairs.
   Analysts also said the committee's action might eventually help
break the deadlock between China, which has occupied the Himalayan
nation since 1950, and the Dalai Lama, who leads an exile
government based in India.
   The prize, worth $469,000 at the current exchange rate, will be
awarded in Oslo on Dec. 10.
   In its citation, the Nobel committee mentioned the Dalai Lama's
rejection of violence and his preachings of respect for all living
things. It praised his ``constructive and forward-looking proposals
for the solution of international conflicts.''
   Past prizes have been used to encourage human rights activists
and support peace efforts. Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa won
in 1983; the 1987 prize went to President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica
for his Central American peace plan; and U.N. peacekeeping forces
were given last year's award.
   The Dalai Lama, 54, was born Tenzin Gyatso. The son of a poor
farmer, he was named spiritual and temporal ruler as the 14th Dalai
Lama at age 15, just before the Chinese army marched into Tibet. He
fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule.
   In Los Angeles, where he was attending a conference, the Dalai
Lama said: ``I very much appreciate that kind of recognition about
my beliefs. In fact, I always believed in love, compassion and a
sense of universal respect. Every human being has that potential.''
   ``This prize may open more people's eyes to look at their own
quality,'' said the Buddhist leader, who wore sandals and
traditional red-and-orange robes.
   ``Tibetans today are facing the real possibility of elimination
as a people and a nation,'' he later told a news conference.
   The Dalai Lama said he had no idea what he might do with the
money and that he did not know the exact amount of the award.
   ``Do you know how much money?'' he asked a reporter. ``Some of
my friends told me with this prize there was some money.''
   In the Himalayan town of Dharmsala, India, the base of the exile
government, Tibetans danced and sang in the streets.
   Despite the Dalai Lama's teachings of non-violence, bloody
clashes with Chinese authorities have occurred in Lhasa, the
Tibetan capital, over the past two years.
   Up to 30 people were killed in March, and Lhasa has been under
martial law since then. Demonstrations were reported as recently as
last month.
   Wang Guisheng of the Chinese Embassy in Oslo, said: ``This has
hurt the people's feelings. The Dalai Lama is not only a religious
leader but also a political figure in exile, who carries out
political activity aimed at splitting the fatherland and
undermining national unity.''
   Egil Aarvik, chairman of the Norwegian committee that awards the
Nobel Peace Prize, said the Buddhist leader was nominated in
previous years, ``but events in the East, particularly in China in
the last year, have made the Dalai Lama's candidacy more timely now
than before.''
   He referred to the army crackdown on student pro-democracy
demonstrators June 3-4, and declared to reporters: ``If I were a
Chinese student, I would be fully in support of the decision.''
   After Chinese tanks drove the protesters from Tiananmen Square,
members of the Norwegian Parliament proposed student leader Chai
Ling for the Peace Prize. She was ineligible this year, however,
because nominations closed Feb. 1.
   In June 1988, the Dalai Lama abandoned his demand for the
independence of Tibet's 6 million people in favor of
demilitarization. Speaking to the European Parliament, he called
for a self-governing Tibet, with China in charge of defense and
foreign affairs.
   China, which considers Tibet an integral part of its territory,
rejected the plan as an ``attempt to distort history.''
   In addition to putting down political protest in Lhasa, the
Chinese have used less overt methods by trying to cultivate senior
Buddhist clergy.
   The Panchen Lama, second in the religious hierarchy, remained
behind in Tibet when the Dalai Lama fled. Tibetan nationalists
considered him little more than a Chinese stooge, but he redeemed
himself in their eyes by calling Chinese rule ``repressive'' a few
days before his death in January.
   China has said it will talk with the Dalai Lama if he does not
negotiate as leader of an exile government. The two sides have yet
to agree on the terms and participants.
   Harald Boeckman of the Institute of East Asian Affairs at Oslo
University, said the prize could strengthen the Tibetan leader's
bargaining position ``and speed up the process toward a
settlement'' by bringing about ``a creative and productive chaos.
   Next week, the Swedish Nobel committee will name the winners of
the medicine, economics, physics and chemistry prizes. No date has
been announced for the literature award.
   Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist who made a fortune from
his invention of dynamite, established the prizes in his will. He
died in 1896 and the first awards were made in 1901.

<HEAD>Election Commission Denies Matching Money for Robertson Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television evangelist Pat Robertson's 1988
presidential campaign committee was turned down Thursday in a bid
for an additional $675,000 in federal matching funds.
   The Federal Election Commission rejected an appeal by Americans
for Robertson, which had resubmitted a request for matching funds
that had previously been denied.
   The commission staff had denied the request after reviewing a
sample of the contributions to be matched and determining that they
were not eligible for matching funds.
   In resubmitting its request, the Robertson committee asked the
commission to identify the sample contributions that had been
rejected.
   The committee maintained that, by correcting the errors that had
made these contributions ineligible, it should be entitled to
recover the value of its original submission, about $689,000.
   The committee, however, accepted the recommendation of its staff
that the Robertson Committee was entitled only to the value of the
sample items, or $14,873.
   It also refused a request by the Robertson committee that it be
permitted to resubmit the request a second time.
   Robertson's original matching requests totaled $9.7 million.
   In yearend papers filed with the commission, the Robertson
campaign reported it was nearly half a million dollars in debt.
   Robertson unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for
president in his 1988 campaign.

   Former Panamanian vice presidential candidate
Guillermo Ford said at the White House Thursday that the Panamanian
Defense Forces should ``get their act together'' and overthrow Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Ford, who met with President Bush briefly and with Vice
President Dan Quayle, also appealed to world democracies to join in
trying to oust the dictator, but was not specific on what they
should do. He declined to fault the United States for failing to
intercede during this week's failed coup.
   As to what his group can do now, he said, ``It's pretty hard to
knock a tank over with a piece of rock. That's why were looking on
the world democracies to get help ... I am not going to allow
Noriega to wear a medal made with the blood of the Panamanian
people so we're going to find other means to get rid of Noriega.
   Ford was physically assaulted by Noriega forces after last May's
election, which observers said was actually won by opponents of
Noriega but which he invalidated.
   Ford said the political opposition in Panama was surprised by
the attempted coup mounted by insurgents in the defense forces.
   ``There is no relation whatsoever between the opposition and the
military,'' he said.
   Ford was asked about congressional complaints that the United
States should have intervened to back up the insurgents' effort to
topple Noriega. ``I think the Panamanian Defense Forces should take
upon themselves the solution,'' to oust their leader, he told
reporters outside the White House.
   ``I think it can be done, definitely,'' he said. ``I don't think
we should look upon the United States alone to do it.''
   Earlier, in a photo session with Quayle, he said, ``We feel that
the defense forces should get their act together and get rid of Mr.
Noriega.''
   Ford said he spoke briefly with Bush and that the president
repeated his position that the United States has no quarrel with
the Panamanian Defense Forces, even apparently those that stuck
with Noriega in the coup, but that the administration's goal is to
get rid of Noriega.
   The May 7 election in which Ford was a vice presidential
candidate was roundly condemned by foreign governments and
independent groups as being rigged to favor Noriega. But even
still, the voters overwhelmingly voted against Noriega's
candidates, the observer groups said.

   Former President Reagan said in an interview
released Thursday that he favors ``a closer look ... to see if some
compulsory retirement ages shouldn't be changed.''
   ``I think that physically people aren't as old as the numbers
indicate any more,'' said Reagan, 78, in an interview.
   Reagan discussed retirement with Peter Hackes, host of the
``Mature Focus'' radio program of the American Association of
Retired Persons. The interview is scheduled for broadcast Saturday
and Oct. 14 on the Mutual Broadcasting System.
   When asked what changes he thought needed to be made to
accomodate an aging U.S. population, Reagan said, ``Well, I wonder
if we shouldn't take a closer look at our various and many
collective age retirement limits ... ''
   He said that if people are aging differently ``that would be a
very major thing,'' raising the need ``to see if some compulsory
retirement ages shouldn't be changed.''
   Under legislation passed by Congress in 1986, most employes can
no longer be forced to retire because they have reached age 70. The
law exempted tenured university faculty members and state and local
police officers, fire fighters and prison guards for seven years.
   In addition, said David Certner, a legislative representative
for the AARP, the Federal Aviation Administration has a rule
barring airline pilots from flying after age 60.
   Some states also require judges to retire at age 70, and the
Supreme Court declined on Monday to review such a requirement in
the state of Pennsylvania.

<HEAD>Making Social Security Independent Would Be `Devastating,' Agency
Chief Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan on Thursday reiterated the Bush administration's strong
opposition to a move in Congress to make the Social Security
Administration an independent agency.
   ``This would be devastating for senior Americans'' because it
would disrupt services to the elderly, Sullivan told a National
Press Club luncheon audience.
   He also said it would mean the ``serious and legitimate concerns
regarding care and support of our senior citizens will lose Cabinet
level advocacy.''
   Social Security is now part of the Department of Health and
Human Services.
   Supporters of the proposals in Congress say that making Social
Security an independent federal agency would give Social Security
increased visibility and would protect its trust funds from being
tapped for other uses.
   Measures to make Social Security independent of HHS are in the
budget reconciliation bill passed by the House on Thursday and in
the Senate's reconciliation bill that will be acted on soon.
   ``If the system ain't broke don't fix it,'' Sullivan said, ``and
we maintain that the system (Social Security) is working better
than ever.''

   Here is the 230-195 roll call Thursday by
which the House defeated a Bush administration-endorsed substitute
for a $22.7 billion increase in federal child care subsidies over
the next five years.
   The substitute, authored by Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas,
would have provided only $17.2 billion in new aid and would have
eliminated propposed requirements that states regulate child care
providers.
   A ``yes'' vote is a vote to substitute Stenholm's version for
the bigger package, which is now part of a House-approved bill for
reducing the federal deficit in fiscal 1990 by nearly $11 billion.
   Voting yes were 36 Democrats and 159 Republicans.
   Voting no were 214 Democrats and 16 Republicans.
   X denotes those not voting.
   Present denotes those who voted they were ``present'' at the
time of the vote but did not vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on the issue.

   The State Department acted Thursday to block a
news conference called in New York by a visiting Palestine
Liberation Organization delegation to the United Nations.
   A U.S. official said the conference amounted to ``political
activity'' beyond the bounds of the visas the five PLO officials
were granted in order to enter the country from Tunisia to attend
the United Nationsl General Assembly.
   John Bolton, the assistant secretary of state for International
organizations, made the determination, and the State Department
notified the U.N. Secretariat of the finding, said the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The news conference had been scheduled by the Palestine
Solidarity Committee for Thursday evening at the United National
Church Center, across from the United Nations. The topics included
a proposal for negotiations by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir and the 22-months of disorder on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   Later, Jeanne Butterfield of the Palestine Solidarity Committee
said a news conference would be held. But she said she did not know
if any, or all, of the PLO officials would participate.
   The delegation from Tunisia, where the PLO maintains its
headquarters, included Farouk Khaddoumi, head of its political
department; Yasser Abd Rabbo, of the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine; Suleiman Najjab, of the Palestine
Communist party; Tayysir Kabba, of the Population Front for the
Liberation of Palestine; and Mohammed Milhem, a member of the PLO
executive committee.
   The United States last December opened talks with the PLO in
Tunisia after Chairman Yasser Arafat publicly renounced terrorism.
Official contacts and PLO activities in this country remain
restricted.

   East German media ignored reports of fights
between police and would-be emigrants in Dresden, and officials
concentrated Thursday on dressing East Berlin in banners extolling
40 years of ``socialist triumph.''
   Witnesses in Dresden said police used clubs and water cannons to
disperse thousands of people who hoped to board freedom trains
bound for West Germany with more than 7,000 East Germans who took
refuge at the West German Embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia.
   ``It was a horrible scene,'' said a Dresden woman, who asked not
to be identified for fear of reprisals. ``People were trying
desperately to get to the platforms and the tracks, but the police
forced them back.''
   It was the second violent clash outside Dresden's main railroad
station station in two days.
   Official media have turned their attention to celebrations
Friday and Saturday of the communist nation's 40th anniversary, but
East Germans are able to watch reports of the mass emigration on
West German television.
   Most coverage of the emigration is devoted to criticizing West
Germany. Neues Deutschland, the Communist Party daily, accused the
West German government of breaking international law by harboring
refugees in its Eastern European missions.
   A ranking party ideologue, Otto Reinhold, complained in a
newspaper commentary of a ``hateful and slanderous campaign against
East Germany.''
   Reinhold told Western reporters Thursday that East Germany
rejects a dialogue with opposition groups seeking democratic and
economic reforms.
   ``We have no intention to talk with any group whose foundations
are not rooted in socialism,'' he said.
   East Germany's aging leaders have rejected political and
economic reforms similar to those in Poland and Hungary and are
nervous about the liberal attitude of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, who arrives Friday for the anniversary ceremonies.
   Gorbachev is popular with many East Germans, who hope his
influence will bring change to their tightly controlled society.
   Rolf Henrich of the illegal opposition group New Forum said he
hoped Gorbachev would put pressure on East German leader Erich
Honecker to implement reforms.
   ``It would be a shame if he came only to praise those whose
policies he's trying to fight at home,'' Henrich said.
   He and other opposition leaders harbor little hope that the
Gorbachev visit will bring change in the near future.
   ``It looks like we're going to have to reach rock bottom before
we work our way up,'' Henrich said.

<HEAD>Investigators Say Weapons Plant Poses No Immediate Threat to Public</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Rocky Flats nuclear arms plant, which is
under investigation by the FBI for possible criminal violation of
environmental laws, poses no imminent threat to public health, the
Energy Department concluded in a study released Thursday.
   The report raised doubts, however, about the accuracy of
measured concentrations of plutonium in the air surrounding the
364-acre manufacturing complex near Denver. It said the air
samplers are out-of-date, prone to breakdowns and not properly
located.
   The 1{-inch-thick report, based on a six-week special
investigation by Energy Department experts, cited a series of
weaknesses in Rocky Flats programs aimed at identifying and
correcting serious environmental problems at the plant.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins ordered the special assessment
of conditions at Rocky Flats on June 6, the same day that dozens of
FBI agents and Environmental Protection Agency investigators raided
the plant looking for evidence of illegal dumping and incineration
of hazardous wastes. A special grand jury was impaneled in Denver
on Aug. 1 but has not yet issued any indictments.
   Henson Moore, the deputy energy secretary, told a Senate
committee Thursday the FBI has provided no information about its
investigation. He said it had promised to alert the department to
any health-threatening conditions it might find.
   At a separate congressional hearing, George B. Merrick, vice
president Rockwell International Corp., which earlier this month
agreed to withdraw as manager of Rocky Flats, said his company also
had been unable to get information on the FBI probe.
   The separate Energy Department investigation was concluded July
21.
   ``No situations which pose an imminent threat to public health
or the environment were observed,'' the report said.
   The highly technical documentation provided in the report
painted a picture of deep-rooted problems in management of Rocky
Flats, including poor communication and planning, a lack of quality
assurance and the absence of a comprehensive strategy for bringing
the plant into compliance with state and federal environmental laws.
   Among the investigators' findings:
   _The plant's method of monitoring emissions into the open air
from exhaust ducts are deficient. These flaws ``may adversely
affect determination of radioactive materials released into the
atmosphere,'' including plutonium, it said.
   _No soil samples were taken after the release June 3 of a fluid
containing the hazardous material Polychlorinated Biphenyl. PCBs
were banned by the government in the 1970s after laboratory tests
determined they caused cancer in animals, although the material is
still in widespread use in electric transformers.
   _Bags of asbestos-containing materials are not covered with soil
after being dumped in landfills. Asbestos is a fibrous material
suspected of causing lung disease.
   _There are no formal procedures in place to minimize the risk of
spills and overflows during transfers of materials from underground
storage tanks. There also is no written procedure for requiring
constant monitoring of such transfers.
   _Discharges from a cooling tower are allowed to form a pool of
standing water in a courtyard between buildings. Eventually this
water percolates into the ground, carrying with it any contaminants
that could enter the groundwater.

<HEAD>Bill Would Allow Futures Customers to Seek Triple Damages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures traders and brokers who cheat their
customers could be sued for up to three times the amount stolen
under legislation introduced in the Senate Thursday.
   The proposed Futures Trading Practices Act of 1989 also would
hold retail brokerages liable for customer losses caused by
wrongdoing of the floor broker it picked to handle the customer's
trade.
   ``Our futures markets work only if people have confidence in
them,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., one of the bill's sponsors.
   Leahy, chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and
Forestry Committee, said he will hold a hearing on the proposal
Oct. 17.
   ``In the past nine months, the futures industry has suffered
what some have called a nervous breakdown,'' he said, citing the
indictment of more than 40 traders and brokers on the nation's two
largest futures exchanges. ``These events add up to one inescapable
conclusion _ the system is not working.''
   The bill was co-sponsored by Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., the
committee's ranking Republican.
   ``The greatest thing that the commodity exchanges in our country
have to offer is expertise and integrity,'' said Lugar, who joined
Leahy at a news conference announcing the bill's introduction.
   Turning aside previous criticism that the bill's strict
record-keeping requirements will drive the futures market overseas,
Lugar said: ``My fear is if we do not pursue the state-of-the-art
to the ultimate, other nations will.''
   The bill also beefs up the funding and the enforcement powers of
the federal agency that oversees futures markets, the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.
   Under the bill, the CFTC budget would increase 60 percent over
the next five years, going from $41 million next year to $66
million in fiscal year 1994.
   A reauthorization bill passed by the House last month would only
cover the next two fiscal years, going to $44.5 million in 1991.
CFTC appropriations for 1989 were $34.7 million.
   The bill also expanded CFTC power to collect service fees for
monitoring the exchanges to ensure their trading practices are
honest.

<TEXT>
   Anti-abortion activist Randall Terry began
serving what could be a two-year jail sentence Thursday after
saying he would not pay two $500 fines for trespassing and unlawful
assembly.
   Judge John Bruner of Fulton County State Court suspended two
one-year sentences on condition that Terry, founder of the New
York-based Operation Rescue, pay the fine ``up front'' and stay out
of the Atlanta metropolitan area for two years.
   ``In good conscience, I cannot pay the fine,'' Terry told the
judge in a courtroom packed so full that some spectators sat on
others' laps.
   ``That's entirely up to you, sir,'' Bruner replied.
   Terry, who rode an elevator to the courthouse basement with a
deputy who carried his overnight bag, only nodded when asked if he
was going to jail.
   Atlanta lawyer Jay Sekulow, who said he would handle Terry's
appeal, said there were no immediate plans to post a $2,000 appeal
bond, which would free Terry until the matter is resolved.
   ``That isn't to say there won't be an appeal,'' Sekulow said.
   Terry, who is not a lawyer but acted as his own attorney, was
one of 139 people arrested July 19, 1988, outside the Atlanta
Surgi-Center, where abortions are done. The gathering was one of
the demonstrations that began during the Democratic National
Convention and continued into the fall, resulting in more than
1,200 arrests.
   Terry asked Bruner for leniency, saying he already had spent 12
days in jail after the arrests. The maximum penalty was a year in
jail and a fine of $1,000 on each of the two charges.
   Terry attempted several times to defend his activities as
intended to stop the killing of unborn children. Bruner stressed
that this issue was not before the court. ``I'm not going to be
preached to,'' he said sharply. ``I don't want another sermon.''
   Bruner said he would consider cutting the sentence from two
years to one based on a recent Georgia Court of Appeals ruling that
a person cannot be convicted of criminal trespassing and unlawful
assembly in the same incident.
   Before the sentencing, Tom Pocock, a jail administrator,
testified that the 139 arrested spent a total of 1,001 days in jail
at a cost to the county of more than $41,000.
   During cross-examination of Margie Pitts Hames, the clinic's
attorney, Terry tried to establish that she and others had objected
to a speedy resolution of the cases and, thus, were responsible for
the high costs.
   ``I'm not very impressed with any of this,'' Bruner said.
   Later Ms. Hames said she thought the sentence was fair.
   ``It serves no purpose to send him to jail,'' she said. ``If he
chooses not to pay the fine, then it is his choice to go to jail. I
assume his flock will raise the money to have him out of there in
24 hours.''
   David Andrews, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood in
New York, said, ``I am delighted to receive the news that justice
has been served in the case of Operation Rescue terrorist Randall
Terry.''
   Operation Rescue activists try to blockade entrances to clinics
where abortions are performed and persuade women, often through use
of graphic photographs, not to have abortions.
   The group says more than 34,000 of its activists have been
arrested since it was founded in November 1987.

   The man directing the federal effort to assist
victims of Hurricane Hugo defended his agency Thursday, saying that
while it has been stretched to the limit, much has been done and
the government will continue working until the storm is just a bad
memory.
   ``This has been an extremely horrendous disaster, far above what
we would expect to see in decades in the United States,'' said
Grant C. Peterson, associate director of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
   ``We are strained absolutely to the limit, but I think we're
where we should be,'' said Peterson, responding to criticism that
his agency has been slow and bureaucratic.
   After leaving a trail of disaster across Puerto Rico and the
Virgin Islands, Hugo hit the coast Sept. 21, damaging and
destroying homes, businesses, schools and municipal buildings in
both South and North Carolina.
   Peterson said his agency has 19 field offices open in South
Carolina, is taking calls on 20 toll-free hotlines, is using a
single-page form to accept requests for assistance and generally is
processing these requests and issuing checks within four or five
days.
   The agency could not begin its response until governors asked
for a presidential disaster declaration, said Peterson. But once
that was done FEMA called in the Defense Department for assistance
and immediately took action, he said.
   Asked to respond to critics of his agency, Peterson said that
their ``comments are unfortunate and have added nothing to the
recovery effort.''
   The leading congressional critic of FEMA's response, Sen. Ernest
F. Hollings, D-S.C., said he was unconvinced.
   He called the agency a ``totally inept outfit'' with ``the
unmitigated gall to come forward and say on Oct. 5, two weeks after
the disaster, that we're doing a grand job and we haven't even
opened up in 10 disaster counties.''
   Hollings also said he sent a letter to President Bush on
Thursday asking him to inform FEMA that the federal government
should assume 100 percent of the reimbursement of the cost of
relief in the wake of Hugo.
   His letter quoted the law as saying the federal share of
assistance shall not be less than 75 percent. He said that at every
corner of the cleanup effort ``there is a FEMA percentage wrangle
rather than assistance.''
   Noting that some members of Congress have called for a General
Accounting Office investigation of FEMA's disaster effort, Peterson
quipped that when the agency saw the storm coming ashore it knew
that Hugo would be accompanied by two things, a GAO investigation
and congressional hearings. ``We welcome both. ...'' he said.
   But, Peterson said, ``let us be forthright _ nobody can recreate
life in the Caribbean or the Carolinas exactly as it was before
Hugo.''
   ``Hugo packed a powerful and deadly punch. It is likely to be
the most devastating natural disaster in decades and perhaps this
century. Making things right will not happen overnight. It will
take time, patience and mutual support, and you have our dedicated
commitment ... that all that can be done will be done,'' Peterson
said.

<HEAD>London Store Offers Lunch To Customers After Credit Blooper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The elegant Harvey Nichols department store,
shopping place of royalty, tried to make amends Thursday for
mistakenly telling about 100 account customers their credit was no
good.
   The store, a next-door neighbor of Harrods in London's expensive
Knightsbridge district, said it offered free lunch and shopping
vouchers to the offended customers.
   Managing Director Richard Maney sent letters of apology, blaming
a computer error.
   ``It has been corrected and I can assure you that is has no
reflection on your credit standing at Harvey Nichols or anywhere
else,'' he said.
   Maney offered the customers lunch at the store's restaurant,
costing up to 30 pounds ($48), plus a 20-pound ($32) shopping
voucher for use in the store.

<HEAD>East German Refugees' Cars Going for Bargain Prices</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To some Poles who gathered at the West
German Embassy this week to see off East German refugees, it was
strictly business.
   Sniffing a bargain, more than a dozen Poles were on hand
Thursday to look over East German cars being abandoned by the
refugees _ and maybe buy one for peanuts.
   ``It is a real bargain,'' said one man at the embassy late in
the day as the last refugees were being boarded onto buses to
deliver them to the train to West Germany.
   ``You can buy a Trabant for 400 or 500 marks ($200 or $250), and
someone bought a Trabant that had a suitcase in the trunk with a
portable stereo inside. He paid only 450 DMS ($225),'' said the
man, who like other prospective buyers refused to give his name.
   The Trabant is an East German compact model car.
   East German refugees who traveled to Poland by car all had to
leave their vehicles at least temporarily because the only
transport to West Germany was by special train. Most refugees
turned over their car keys to embassy officials, and the West
German Auto Club was to arrange to transport the vehicles to West
Germany later.
   But some East Germans apparently preferred a bit of hard
currency now rather than the uncertain prospect of having their car
delivered sometime later. Besides, the tiny East German Trabants
would not be the car of choice in West Germany, where powerful
Mercedes and BMWs rule the highways and cow small-car drivers.
   On the Polish car market, a used Trabant usually costs around
$1,100.
   Bargains were also reported in other makes. A used Soviet-made
Lada Samara, which normally costs about $3,500, went for $500,
according to one Pole standing outside the embassy.
   The would-be buyers showed no trace of remorse for taking
advantage of the refugees. They said the shoe was on the other foot
when Poles fled their homeland following the imposition of martial
law in 1981.
   ``This is just the same thing as with Polish cars in Austria in
the past,'' said one. ``They also had to sell their cars for
nothing.''

   Scattered showers and thunderstorms from the remnants of
Hurricane Raymond doused parts of Arizona and New Mexico and moved
into the central Plains and upper Mississippi Valley on Thursday.
   Flash flood watches continued in effect for southern Arizona and
the northern and western mountains of New Mexico. Up to 1 1-3
inches of rain soaked the Tucson, Ariz., area.
   A line of showers and thunderstorms also stretched along and
ahead of a Pacific cold front crossing the central Plains and the
upper Mississippi Valley.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six-hour period ending at 1 p.m.
CDT included 0.71 of of an inch in Dubuque, Iowa, 0.70 in Madison,
Wis., 0.68 in Des Moines and 0.58 in Moline, Ill.
   Early morning showers and thundershowers produced 0.73 of an
inch of rain at La Crosse, Wis., and 0.56 inch at at Rochester,
Minn.
   Sunny skies prevailed across much of the rest of the nation.
Temperatures warmed into the 80s Thursday afternoon across much of
the area from Texas to Florida and southern Georgia, with lower 90s
in south-central Texas.
   Afternoon readings were only in the 40s across northern
Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, upper Michigan and northern Maine.
   The cold spot in the Lower 48 states Thursday morning was
Winnemucca, Nev., with a low of 21 degrees.

   Despite strong U.S. protests, the French
government plans to trade Brazil sensitive rocket technology that
could be used by U.S. enemies to make ballistic missiles,
government and industry officials said Thursday.
   France has promised to give Brazil the technology of a liquid
fuel motor called Viking, which powers the Ariane space launch
vehicle, the officials said. In return, the French company
Arianespace would be awarded a $60 million contract for the launch
of two Brazilian communications satellites, they added.
   The U.S. officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity,
said French President Francois Mitterrand personally made the
decision to give the technology to Brazil, promising that
safeguards would be placed to prevent use of the motor for lethal
purposes.
   But a statement issued by the government in Paris denied a final
decision had been made. ``The definitive contract will be submitted
to the government for approval and this contract has not yet been
given'' to the government, the statement said.
   ``This contract will have to follow certain purposes and
restrictions regarding technology transfers,'' it said.
   The United States, however, is doubtful such safeguards can be
implemented effectively.
   ``If someone like Libya wants to use this motor to harmful
purposes, who will stop them?'' asked one official.
   Libya has been seeking to buy from Brazil equipment and know-how
in an effort to develop a ballistic missile arsenal capable of
delivering chemical weapon warheads, according to U.S. experts.
   Brazil, one of an estimated 20 Third World countries which have
some form of ballistic missile capability, has been exporting some
missile technology while and attempting to develop a more accurate
and sophisticated arsenal of its own.
   Word of the planned French sale was first reported by Signal
magazine, published by the Armed Forces Communications and
Electronic Association.
   Representatives of McDonnell Douglas Corp., the St. Louis-based
firm competing for the Brazilian launch contract against
Arianespace, were informed of the French proosal by Brazilian
officials and conveyed the information to the Defense Department,
officials said.
   A spokesman for McDonnell Douglas, Bob O'Brien, said that if the
French ``transfer is made, obviously it wouldn't enhance our
chances'' to win the contract. He said Brazil had been expected to
announce its decision already but has not done so yet.
   The United States first protested the planned French sale last
July during the seven-nation economic summit in Paris, one official
said.
   For while it appeared the protest had stopped the French plan,
the official said. But the French government reconsidered when it
appeared France stood to lose the lucrative satellite launch
contract, he said.
   The United States has warned France the technology transfer
would violate the Missile Technology Control Regime, a 1987
agreement to stem the proliferation of such weapons, of which
France is a signatory, the official said.
   But France contends the Viking motor will be used for peacefull
purposes and would not violate the agreement.
   The United States is still reviewing whether it can stop the
deal, the official said.

   WASHINGTON AP) _ Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said Thursday
he'll ask seven states to store radioactive waste from a Colorado
nuclear weapons plant threatened with shutdown unless waste sites
are found by March.
   Watkins said he had not yet selected the states, but they
apparently would include Colorado and Idaho and possibly New
Mexico, Nevada and Washington, which are key links in the Energy
Department's troubled nuclear weapons complex.
   The two other nearest states with nuclear weapons sites are
Texas and California.
   In testimony before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee, Watkins said he must ask the states to accept the waste
_ totalling as much as 4,900 cubic yards over a two-year period
starting next March 1 _ because a planned permanent waste dump in
New Mexico cannot be opened until next July at the earliest.
   The New Mexico repository was supposed to have opened a year ago
but has been repeatedly delayed by a series of environmental,
technical and regulatory problems.
   Watkins said he expected the problem of finding a temporary
storage site for the Rocky Flats weapons plant waste to become ``a
very contentious issue'' as he begins outlining his seven-state
plan with governors and members of Congress next week.
   ``People are going to say, `Not in my state,''' Watkins said,
adding that ``perhaps there are seven states out there willing'' to
help ease the waste crunch.
   Eddie Binder, a spokesman for New Mexico Gov. Garrey Carruthers,
said the governor's position as stated two weeks ago had not
changed. At that time, Carruthers said, ``There's no way I'll
accept any other waste than what is already in this state for
temporary storage.''
   The waste generated at Rocky Flats, near Denver, is contaminated
with plutonium, which remains radioactive for 240,000 years. The
plant recovers plutonium from retired nuclear weapons and
reprocesses it to make triggers for new ones.
   Colorado Gov. Roy Romer has set a waste-accumulation limit at
Rocky Flats that Watkins said will be reached by March 1. Romer has
said that after that date, additional waste will have to be shipped
elsewhere or Rocky Flats will be closed down.
   Idaho had been storing part of the Rocky Flats waste, but Gov.
Cecil Andrus on Sept. 1 closed his state's borders to further
shipments in protest of the Energy Department's failure to open the
$800 million Waste Isolation Pilot Project, a planned permanent
repository in salt caverns near Carlsbad, N.M.
   Watkins said he had received a letter from Washington Gov. Booth
Gardner that said, in essence, ``Don't look my way'' in seeking a
temporary waste storage site. He added later, however, that he had
received ``some informal indications'' from some unspecified states
that they might consider dropping their opposition if a multi-state
agreement was reached to spread the waste burden.
   On a related subject, Watkins said his department was about to
release the results of an internal investigation at Rocky Flats
that concluded there were no accidental nuclear reactions at the
plant, situated about 18 miles northwest of Denver.
   The possibility of an inadvertent chain reaction had arisen
earlier this year following the discovery of man-made radioactive
elements produced only by splitting atoms. There are atom-splitting
reactors at the plant, but the presence of man-made radioactive
elements could have been explained by piling too much plutonium
close together.
   Watkins offered no details beyond saying the department's
investigation had found no evidence of a chain reaction at Rocky
Flats. His chief adviser on nuclear waste, Leo Duffy, told
reporters later that the probe did uncover management problems at
Rocky Flats and some safety practices that needed to be corrected.
He did not elaborate.
   Watkins also told the Senate committee he was creating an Office
of Nuclear Safety to provide independent oversight of safety at the
weapons plants. He said the office would have the authority to
impose fines for safety violations.

   Here is the 333-91 roll call Thursday by which
the House approved a bill to reduce the fiscal 1990 deficit by $11
billion.
   In addition to spending cuts and increased revenues aimed at
deficit reduction, the bill includes a cut in capital gains taxes
and a massive expansion of federal aid for child care. It also
repeals a year-old catastrophic health care program for the elderly.
   A ``yes'' vote is a vote in favor of the bill, which now goes to
a conference with the Senate.
   Voting yes were 187 Democrats and 146 Republicans.
   Voting no were 63 Democrats and 28 Republicans.
   X denotes those not voting.
   Present denotes those who voted they were ``present'' at the
time of the vote but did not vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on the issue.
   There are two vacancies in the 435-member House.

<TEXT>
   Deadlocked House and Senate negotiators
decided Thursday to give the Food and Drug Administration
conflicting advice over whether it should ban the food additive Red
Dye No. 3 as a cancer-causing substance.
   ``If I were in the FDA, I would be totally confused,'' said Sen.
Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., who had urged fellow conferees to instruct the
agency to follow existing law in deciding whether to ban the dye
that gives maraschino cherries their brilliant color.
   Senate conferees accepted Fowler's amendment, but their House
counterparts, led by Rep. Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., refused to budge
from the House position that the FDA should conduct further studies
of the food additive before deciding whether to ban it.
   Fowler demanded a recorded vote, but Whitten, the House
Appropriations Committee chairman who has been in Congress since
1941, insisted that appropriations conferences never resolve their
disputes by voting.
   In the end, the two sides agreed to include both the House and
Senate language in the conference managers' report, which does not
carry the force of law but usually is followed by the agency
involved.
   ``We will have another day,'' Fowler said after the conference
on the $42.1 billion spending bill for rural development,
agriculture and related agencies spending bill moved on to other
issues.
   The controversy over Red Dye No. 3 dates back to 1960 when
Congress first called for a ban on foods that cause cancer in
laboratory animals. The dye was put on a provisional list that
permitted it to remain on the market for two years pending further
study.
   Since 1962, Fowler said the FDA has granted some 40 extensions
of the provisional listing to ``try to give the industry every
opportunity to show this is not a carcinogenic agent. They have
failed to do so.''
   The FDA decided in 1984 to remove Red Dye No. 3 from the
provisional list after tests showed that it caused cancer in
animals. But that decision was overruled by then-Secretary of
Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler.

<HEAD>Sand Dunes Being Rebuilt; Damage Estimates Soar to At Least $4 Billion</HEAD>

   Army engineers on bulldozers began
rebuilding sand dunes Thursday along South Carolina's
hurricane-ravaged coast, preparing for abnormally high tides later
this month.
   About 550 soldiers and Marines hauled sand in 100 dump trucks to
build up eight miles of dunes between Myrtle Beach and Pawleys
Island, where the high tides arriving Oct. 14 pose the greatest
threat of erosion, said Corps of Engineers spokeswoman Carol Todd.
   The moon's closest approach to Earth in years will push tides at
least 2 feet above the normal 5-foot range, and northeasterly winds
could push them even higher. The dunes are the only shield for
seaside homes and businesses.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell said he hopes to have 65 miles of dunes
rebuilt along South Carolina's 187-mile coast before that time.
   Damage estimates from Hurricane Hugo, meanwhile, have soared to
at least $4 billion, and officials considered increasing the
gasoline tax to pay cleanup costs.
   In Pawleys Island, 20 miles south of Myrtle Beach, residents did
not wait for federal aid to begin rebuilding dunes. The island was
sliced in half by Hurricane Hugo and dozens of homes were damaged
or destroyed.
   ``We've had experience with the bureaucratic way,'' said Hassie
Forrester, one of 16 landowners who hired a contractor to bulldoze
new dunes in front of their homes. ``We're told one thing one day
and another the next. That's why we're going ahead.''
   At least 30 other residents have signed up for the contractor's
services, he said.
   Hugo hit the coast Sept. 21, leaving at least 18 dead in South
Carolina, and damaging and destroying homes, businesses, schools
and municipal buildings. In all, 29 people were killed on the U.S.
mainland and at least 33 in the Caribbean.
   Damage, initially estimated in South Carolina at $3 billion, is
now estimated at between $4 billion and $5 billion, Campbell said
Thursday.
   It will cost an estimated $214.7 million to clean up the debris
and wreckage left behind by the storm. The state expects to pay 25
percent, with the federal government covering the rest.
   The state Highways and Public Transportation Commission said it
would consider raising the gasoline tax one penny per gallon to pay
for the cleanup. Campbell said he didn't like that idea, and would
first shift money from other programs.
   ``It may well be down the road we need revenue. I don't know,''
he said.
   Ten miles outside Charleston, the Corps worked to repair the
toppled Ben Sawyer Bridge, the only link between the mainland and
Isle of Palms and Sullivans Island.
   On Wednesday, the swing bridge was pulled out of the
Intracoastal Waterway, where one end had been at a 45-degree angle
since the storm.
   A broken cable prevented barges from positioning the bridge back
on the road, and workers predicted the span would not open to
traffic until Friday.
   The American Red Cross, meanwhile, announced that only seven
evacuation shelters housing 454 people are still open around the
state. Since the storm approached, 453 shelters had housed 87,230
people.
   About two-thirds of South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co.'s 150,000
customers in the Charleston area have power, and almost all
customers in other areas of the state are on line, officials said.
   Charleston Mayor Joseph J. Riley Jr. said power was restored to
enough of the city to eliminate a curfew from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.

   A woman accused of helping engineer her
husband's helicopter escape from a Colorado prison was sentenced
Thursday to one to three years in prison for her role in a chase
and shootout that followed.
   ``I only want to say that I'm truly sorry,'' Patricia A.
Gonzales said before her sentencing. ``My intentions were not to
hurt anyone. I just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong
time.''
   Mrs. Gonzales, 41, pleaded no contest last month to a reduced
charge of being an accessory to a felony in a plea bargain with
Nebraska authorities.
   Phelps County District Judge Stephen R. Illingworth said he was
not imposing the maximum five-year sentence because Mrs. Gonzales
was not involved in any shooting or driving the vehicle used in the
chase.
   Mrs. Gonzales, her husband, Frederico Gonzales, and another
couple were arrested Aug. 18 after a bullet-punctuated chase in
this south-central Nebraska town.
   The shootout occurred about eight hours after Gonzales and Ralph
P. Brown, fled from the Arkansas Valley Correctional Facility in
Ordway, Colo. in a helicopter.
   Colorado authorities also have issued arrest warrants for the
two couples, charging the men with escape and their wives with
kidnapping and aiding an escape.
   Phelps County Attorney Glenn Clark said Mrs. Gonzales probably
will be extradited to Colorado in the next two months.
   In Nebraska, Brown and Gonzales were originally charged with
attempted murder, use of a firearm to commit a felony and being
felons in possession of a firearm. The women were originally
charged with attempted murder and using a firearm to commit a
felony.
   Gonzales waived his preliminary hearing in Phelps County Court
on Wednesday after reaching a plea agreement in which he will plead
guilty to a reduced charge of being an accessory to a felony, Clark
said. The state agreed to dismiss the rest of the charges.
   Brown and his wife, Rebecca Brown, were being held at a jail
here and are in the process of appealing various rulings.

<TEXT>
   White House aide Richard C. Breeden, the
president's choice to head the Securities and Exchange Commission,
spent Thursday taking congratulatory calls on his Senate
confirmation and planning when he would take office.
   Breeden's nomination was approved by the Senate on a voice vote
late Wednesday night, hours after he was unanimously recommended by
the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.
   Technically, Breeden is replacing departing SEC member Charles
C. Cox but he is expected to be named by President Bush, after he
is sworn in, to head the agency that oversees securities markets,
regulates the sale of stocks, bonds and stock options and enforces
securities laws.
   David Ruder, the previous chairman, returned to teaching law at
Northwestern University on Sept. 30.
   In the interim, Bush has appointed SEC member Edward H.
Fleischman as acting chairman.
   Breeden, 39, has served Bush in a variety of capacities, most
recently as an architect of the legislation that helped bail out
the nation's ailing savings and loan industry.
   Breeden sailed through confirmation hearings before the Banking
Committee last month, explaining that while he held a free market
philosophy, he also believed in strict enforcement of securities
laws.
   He told the committee that illegal activities such as price
fixing or insider trading are ``an attack on the market itself.''
   In lengthier answers to written questions from Senate staffers,
Breeden, a 1975 graduate of Harvard Law School, said vigorous
prosecution of securities law violators is ``one of the most
effective means to increase individual investor confidence and
participation'' in the stock market.
   From 1982-85, Breeden was deputy counsel to then-Vice President
Bush.
   He was a banking specialist with a New York law firm before
that, and between government assignments worked in the Washington
office of a Houston law firm.

   The Soviet Union will be unable by 1991 to mount a
surprise attack if Mikhail S. Gorbachev makes his promised cuts in
conventional military forces, the International Institute for
Strategic Studies said Thursday.
   ``The situation is already in the process of significant
change,'' the institute said in The Military Balance 1989-90, its
annual survey of military forces. ``The unilateral reductions will,
once complete, virtually eliminate the surprise-attack threat which
has so long concerned NATO planners.''
   After the cutbacks, it would take the Soviets one to two weeks
to marshal the forces for an attack, institute director Francois
Heisbourg told a news conference Wednesday.
   ``In shorthand, that translates as no surprise attack,'' he
said. Soviet withdrawals from Eastern Europe now under way include
units needed in lightning attacks, Heisbourg added.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, carried a lengthy
dispatch on the institute's report.
   In a speech to the United Nations on Dec. 7, Gorbachev promised
to reduce the Soviet armed forces by 500,000 troops and to
eliminate 10,000 tanks, 8,500 artillery pieces and 800 combat
aircraft by 1991.
   The institute said it discovered, because the Kremlin answered
its questions for the first time, that the Soviet Union had 6,700
more main battle tanks than previously estimated, bringing the
total to about 60,000. It said the additional tanks probably were
in storage.
   The Soviet-led Warsaw Pact's huge tank force is a key element in
what the 16-nation NATO alliance calls its overwhelming numerical
superiority in conventional forces. The institute's new survey
showed NATO with 34,400 tanks and the Warsaw with 78,200.
   Of these, NATO has 21,900 tanks deployed and the Warsaw Pact
58,500, the survey said.
   Troop levels, excluding reserves, were shown as about equal in
the area, with NATO having 2.24 million active service personnel
compared with 2.3 for the Warsaw Pact.
   The survey said the long-range strategic nuclear arsenals of the
United States and Soviet Union remained ``in rough parity.''
   Institute officials said their estimates of conventional forces
did not include Soviet cutbacks since Gorbachev announced the
planned reductions.
   Heisbourg gave no figures for withdrawals so far but said the
Soviets have begun pulling out crack units and that Moscow had said
frontline divisions deployed in East Germany would be withdrawn.
   ``Some of these divisions are divisions which any NATO planner
would like to see removed,'' Heisbourg said., but he cautioned that
the Soviets would be capable of ``major sustained offensive
operations'' even after the promised cutbacks.
   He said the Warsaw Pact had been weakened by political upheaval
and disagreement, with Poland and Hungary implementing sweeping
reforms and East Germany sticking to communism. Both reformers and
hard-liners have maintained military ties with Moscow but relations
are strained, Heisbourg said.
   ``It would be a very hardy analyst who would consider Hungary
and East Germany still to be allies in any meaningful sense,'' he
told the news conference.
   The institute is an international non-governmental center for
research on security and arms control. It is financed by private
foundations, membership fees and sales of its publications.

   Louisiana officials will try to persuade a
panel of federal judges Friday to revive state laws that could
sentence doctors who perform abortions to prison for 10 years.
   But state Attorney General William Guste said police won't be
hauling physicians off to jail any time soon, no matter what the
three judges rule after Friday's hearing.
   ``Either way the decision goes Friday, it will be appealed _
everybody knows that,'' Guste said in an interview earlier this
week.
   Guste and New Orleans District Attorney Harry Connick will ask
the panel of U.S. District Court judges to lift a 1976 injunction
prohibiting enforcement of three Louisiana anti-abortion laws,
including one making abortion a crime.
   Fighting the effort will be the American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``Louisiana is a major battle ground,'' said Shirley Peddler,
director of Louisiana's ACLU chapter. ``It is the first state to
try to criminalize abortion, even without grounds to do so.''
   Guste said the intent of the case is to get the question before
the U.S. Supreme Court and settle once and for all whether the
justices will overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision establishing
a woman's right to an abortion.
   Connick, who has declined comment on the matter this week,
started the effort to revive the Louisiana laws in July, shortly
after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling upheld restrictions on abortions
in Missouri.
   Both Connick and Guste, who joined the case later, said the
ruling in the Missouri case was a signal that the Supreme Court may
be willing to overturn Roe vs. Wade.
   ``Why not find out where we stand instead of waiting for another
shoe to fall?'' he said in a July 11 interview.
   Women's rights groups have attacked Connick and Guste, saying
their efforts to lift the injunction could turn back the clock on
women's rights.
   Michelle Gross of the National Organization for Women's New
Orleans chapter said Connick was guilty of political grandstanding.
   ``Mr. Connick doesn't care anything about women. He doesn't care
anything about fetuses. He cares about Harry Connick,'' she said.
   The 1976 injunction prohibited enforcement of three laws deemed
unconstitutional in light of Roe vs. Wade.
   One law prohibited performing an abortion and called for
violators to spend one to 10 years in prison. The second prohibited
advertising abortion services and provided for a maximum one-year
prison term and a $500 fine. The third prohibited distribution of
any drug or device designed for use in performing abortions; the
penalty for violation is six months in prison and a $500 fine.
   The Missouri abortion law upheld in July banned abortions in
public hospitals and stopped public employees from counseling women
about abortions. It also required doctors planning to perform
abortions to first test any fetus over 20 weeks old to determine if
it could live outside the womb _ despite the Roe vs. Wade standard
that said a woman is entitled to an abortion until the fetus has
reached 24 weeks.
   Guste said the ruling in the Missouri case changes the basis for
judicial review of abortion laws. If the state can show ``a
rational basis'' for such laws, the laws can be upheld, he said.
   In Louisiana, he said, that ``rational basis'' exists in civil
and criminal statutes giving fetuses all the rights of any
Louisiana citizen from the time of conception.
   The Supreme Court already has agreed to study abortion disputes
from Minnesota, Ohio and Illinois.
   Minnesota and Ohio laws require doctors to notify parents of
unmarried minors who seek an abortion. An Illinois law would
require abortion clinics, where the overwhelming majority of
abortions are performed, to provide services and equipment now
found only in hospitals.

   Health Secretary Louis Sullivan said Thursday
the country needs ``a new ethic of personal responsibility'' to do
what government cannot do in the battle against AIDS, drug abuse
and other problems.
   ``Only when individuals themselves realize that they are
responsible for their own behavior _ only when they work to
strengthen qualities of character like motivation, self-control and
self-discipline _ will we be able to put a halt to AIDS as well as
other self-destructive behaviors like drug abuse, teen pregnancy
and homicide,'' Sullivan said.
   He said Americans ``deperately need to cultivate ... a new ethic
of personal responsibility _ a new culture of character,'' he said
at a National Press Club luncheon.
   Such a change cannot come from a federal law or regulation, he
said, but must be fostered by public as well as private
institutions, including neighborhood organizations, fraternal
lodges, schools and churches.
   ``These social institutions will play the paramount role in
shaping personal values in a free nation,'' he said.

<HEAD>Senate OKs Break For New Ethanol-Based Fuel Additive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new ethanol-based fuel additive that
President Bush brought to public attention this summer got a boost
from a Senate committee that approved a tax break estimated to cost
the government up to $550 million.
   The Senate Finance Committee voted 12-8 early Wednesday morning
to insert into its huge budget reconciliation bill the tax break
for a blend of gasoline and ethyl tertiary butyl ether, or ETBE.
   The tax break could make it more economical for oil companies to
make the ether additive from ethanol rather than methanol, a
product of natural gas, according to the Renewable Fuels
Association, a group that promotes ethanol use.
   That would benefit the Farm Belt, as ETBE manufacturing could
require as much as 50 million bushels of corn a year, the group
estimates.
   Bush touted the additive during a trip to Nebraska in June,
where he drove a ETBE-powered car, following the announcement of
his clean-air legislation. Bush has proposed requiring the sale of
a million clean-fuel cars in the nation's nine most polluted cities.
   ETBE improves engine performance while reducing harmful
emissions, experts say.
   The reconciliation bill still must be approved by the full
Senate and a House-Senate conference committee. The House has not
approved a similar tax break.
   Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., had trouble getting the measure
through the Senate committee because of concerns about whom would
get the tax savings and the estimates of lost revenue, according to
Daschle's staff.
   Aides to the Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on
Taxation said the government could lose as much as $550 million
over five years and that most of the savings would go to one
company, Illinois-based Archer Daniels Midland.
   Albert Buckberg, an economist with the joint committee, declined
to say Thursday whether Archer Daniels would be the main
beneficiary of the tax break but noted that it is the nation's
biggest ethanol manufacturer.
   Renewable Fuels lobbyist Bob Dinneen said Thursday, ``It's not a
tax break that's going to benefit any one company,'' adding that
the committtees' ``revenue estimates are absurd.''
   ETBE will be manufactured only by oil companies because a key
ingredient, isobutylene, is a byproduct of refining petroleum, he
said.
   He said the tax break would cost no more than $100 million over
five years.
   Archer Daniels' chief spokesman, Richard Burket, was out of the
office and no other company officials were available for comment
Thursday.
   The Internal Revenue Service had been asked to rule
administratively that ETBE was entitled to the same tax break as
ethanol-blended gasoline, 60 cents per gallon of additive.
   IRS attorneys could not agree whether the agency could take that
action, according to a Treasury Department official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.

   Riot police fired tear gas and water
cannon Thursday at more than 1,000 anti-government demonstrators
commemorating the anniversary of President Augusto Pinochet's
defeat in a referendum on extending his rule.
   The downtown clashes sent afternoon shoppers and office workers
scurrying for cover. Police reported at 5 p.m. they arrested 99
people, but clashes kept up and reporters saw additional arrests.
No injuries were reported immediately.
   Columns of marchers, carrying banners and posters of opposition
political groups, converged at Plaza Italia, near the city center,
but police kept most of them from proceeding downtown on the
central boulevard, the Alameda.
   Some protesters succeeded in entering the city center and fought
running skirmishes with helmeted riot police, who fired tear gas
grenades and used water cannon mounted on armored trucks to break
up the groups.
   On Oct. 5, 1988, voters rejected a proposal that Pinochet, who
seized power in a 1973 coup, remain president until 1997. The
result obliged the right-wing military president to call elections,
now scheduled for Dec. 14.
   Police estimated more than 1,000 people took part in Thursday's
protests.
   Skirmishes persisted for hours.
   Police said 15 bombs exploded Wednesday night, causing a brief
electrical blackout along a 1,370-mile stretch of the narrow
country, including Santiago, the capital city where more than 4
million of Chile's 12 million people reside.
   Targets included eight high-voltage power towers, five bank
branches and two campaign offices of the pro-government
presidential candidiate, former Finance Minister Hernan Buchi.
   No one claimed responsibility. Leftist extremist groups
frequently have toppled electrical towers as part of a campaign to
undermine the Pinochet government.

   The Dalai Lama says everyone has
what it takes to win a Nobel Peace Prize.
   ``In my case, I make more effort or more attempt to develop
these good qualities, so I got this prize. But everyone has the
capability,'' said the exiled spiritual and political leader of
Tibet, who was awarded the 1989 prize Thursday.
   The soft-spoken winner, who described himself as ``a simple
Buddhist monk,'' stressed the qualities of peace and compassion at
a crowded news conference called to acknowledge the award.
   ``This prize may open more peoples' eyes to look at their own
quality,'' he said.
   The Dalai Lama, 57, was awake when word came around 3 a.m. PDT
that he won the prize for his non-violent struggle to free his
Himalayan nation from Chinese rule.
   The Norwegian Nobel Committee praised his message of universal
reverence and respect for all living things. China condemned the
selection.
   In a written statement, the spiritual leader said he hoped the
prize would provide courage to the 6 million people of Tibet.
   ``Tibetans today are facing the real possibility of elimination
as a people and a nation,'' he said.
   The prize, worth $469,000 at the current exchange rate, will be
awarded in Oslo on Dec. 10. The Dalai Lama appeared unconcerned
about the cash.
   ``Do you know how much money?'' he asked a reporter. ``Some of
my friends told me with this prize there was some money.'' The
Dalai Lama said whatever the amount, he had no idea what he would
do with it.
   Kjeld Vibe, ambassador from Norway, went early Thursday to
congratulate the Dalai Lama at the exclusive gated estate of
ketchup scion Clifford Heinz.
   The monk, who has been living in exile in India, has been
staying at the Heinz home during a Southern California visit to
take part in the East-West Foundation's Harmonia Mundi conference.
   Vibe talked to reporters at the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel
before his visit to the Heinz compound.
   ``The committee wants to emphasize the fact that the Dalai Lama,
in his struggle for liberty of his Tibetan people, consistently has
opposed the use of violence,'' Vibe said. ``He has, instead,
advocated peaceful solutions based upon tolerance and mutual
respect in order to restore the historic and natural heritage of
his people.
   ``The Dalai Lama has evolved his philosophy of peace from a
great reverence for all things living and upon the concept of
universal respect embracing all mankind as well as nature.''

said to have died in a Soviet prison camp.
   Contrary to previous Soviet practice, the report on the evening
news program Vremya did not dismiss rumors that Wallenberg may be
alive and even noted that the Kremlin version of his fate had
varied over the years.
   Wallenberg arrived in Budapest, Hungary, in July 1944 on a
U.S.-sponsored mission to save Jews and disappeared after the Red
Army swept into the Hungarian capital in January 1945. The case has
been an irritant in Swedish-Soviet relations.
   ``Moscow replied in a rather contradictory way to official
inquiries about him from Stockholm _ first, that he was alive and
well and in good hands; then that he was not on Soviet territory at
all, and finally, that Raoul Wallenberg died in 1947 in a jail cell
at the Lubyanka (KGB prison) of a myocardial infarction,'' Vremya
acknowledged.
   In September 1988, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady
Gerasimov told a news briefing the Soviets arrested Wallenberg in
Budapest in 1945 for reasons now unknown, that he died in a Soviet
prison in July 1947 and was cremated without an autopsy.
   In its report, Vremya said Wallenberg's sister had heard reports
in the West that he might still be alive and was flying to Moscow.
   ``Nina Lagergren asks all Soviet people that if anyone knows
anything about Raoul Wallenberg, to call and report it,'' Vremya
said. It gave a Moscow telephone number that it said belonged to
the Raoul Wallenberg Society.
   ``I hope to get true information about his fate from the Soviet
people,'' Wallenberg's sister said in an interview taped at the
Stockholm airport. ``He saved thousands of people and, regardless
of what happened 45 years ago, I'm convinced he's alive.''
   Despite Soviet insistence that he died in prison, reports
persist that Wallenberg has been seen in Soviet jails. Swedish
author Kenne Fant, in a recently published book on Wallenberg, said
he spoke to a ``very trustworthy source'' who heard of a prisoner
in the Soviet Union who must be Wallenberg.
   Fant said the prisoner was seen in 1986 in a labor camp at
Blagoveshchenka, an area closed to foreigners 200 miles southeast
of Novosibirsk, Siberia.
   Fant also cited sources in the United States who said Wallenberg
was treated for a heart ailment in hospitals in Moscow and
Leningrad in 1982 and 1983.
   Andrei D. Sakharov, the Soviet human rights advocate, reported
in an article earlier this year that he had searched the area
around Moscow for evidence of Wallenberg but found nothing.

   Premier Michel Rocard's government won a battle
with prison guards, who gave up a weeklong strike, but tens of
thousands of civil servants marched in the capital Thursday in
another labor dispute.
   In eastern France, police went to a Peugeot auto plant in case
they were ordered to expel militants, and the government appointed
a labor expert to mediate the strike.
   Unions representing nurses, police officers, firefighters and
public transport workers have either threatened walkouts or staged
short work stoppages this week.
   Rocard, a Socialist, told the National Assembly on Wednesday
that the disputes were ``worrisome, very worrisome in some
respects, (but) far from being catastrophic.''
   The Justice Ministry said most of the 15,000 prison guards who
struck Sept. 27 had heeded a union leader's call to return to work.
   Jacques Vialottes, head of one of the four unions representing
the guards, declared the walkout a failure since the government had
refused steadfastly to negotiate higher overtime pay.
   The government had sent in riot police to assure no prisoners
escaped and to break up crowds of strikers blocking gates at
several prisons.
   ``I no longer want to send my boys into a danger zone,''
Vialottes said. ``We will find another solution.''
   About 30,000 civil servants from the Finance Ministry marched
through central Paris to Rocard's office to press their demands for
higher pay and better working conditions.
   Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy said he will meet with union
leaders Friday to address their demands.
   The strike began in June when tax collectors walked out. Their
union says uncollected taxes have cost the government at least $5.5
billion in sales taxes alone.
   Striking Peugeot metalworkers welcomed the appointment of labor
expert Francis Blanchard, who will try to resolve the impasse
between the workers and company President Jacques Calvet.
   Calvet has refused to negotiate with strikers at factories in
Mulhouse and Sochaux as long as they disrupt production.
   Peugeot called on police Thursday to uphold a court order that
several hundred strikers in Mulhouse vacate a forge they had
occupied for about a week.
   Calvet says Peugeot cannot afford a pay raise of more than 3.8
percent this year if the company is to modernize its plants and
compete with Japanese automakers.
   But this argument lost some credibility among workers after
French newspapers reported that in 1988 Calvet received a raise of
46 percent over two years for a salary of about $335,000.

<HEAD>Karpov Adjourns With `Winning' Position Against Yusupov; Timman,
Speelman Draw</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anatoly Karpov adjourned with a winning advantage
against fellow Soviet Artur Yusupov in the third round of the World
Chess Championship Candidates' semifinal Thursday after Yusupov
blundered in a dominating position, experts said.
   In the second semifinal, Jan Timman of the Netherlands and
British Grandmaster Jon Speelman drew a wild 47-move game in the
third round of the World Chess Championship Candidates' semifinal
to leave Timman leading by two points to one.
   Karpov and Yusupov were tied 1-1 after two games, but chess
analysts said they expected Yusupov to resign before play resumes
in the adjourned position on Friday. A victory would move Karpov
into a 2-1 lead in the eight-game contest.
   Tension rose during the sixth and final hour of play at the
Sadler's Wells ballet theater as Yusupov, playing white, seemed to
be closing in on a brilliant giant-killing victory over Karpov, who
held the world title for 10 years from 1975 until 1985.
   But with both players short of time, Yusupov's nerve appeared to
snap and on the 59th move he dramatically threw away a bishop.
   When play adjourned two moves later, Mihai Suba, a Romanian
grandmaster who defected to Britain last year said Karpov had ``100
percent winning chances.''
   The winner of the Candidates's cycle will challenge world
champion Garri Kasparov for his title in a 24-game match beginning
October 1990. The winners of the semifinals will face off in the
Candidates' final in London next March.
   A win scores one point and a draw a half.
   Playing white, Yusupov gave up a rook for a bishop and two pawns
on the 16th move to open up the defenses around Karpov's king.
   But from moves 20 to 30 Karpov unraveled his position and gained
a big advantage when he entrenched a knight in the center.
   At move 34, Kasparov telephoned the championship press room from
France to check on developments and pronounced Karpov's position as
winning.
   But Karpov allowed Yusupov to exchange queens and relieve the
pressure. And in the fifth hour of play, Yusupov won a third pawn
and began to throw two passed pawns up the board.
   As the pawns continued their relentless advance, grandmasters
huddled around video monitors and predicted a Yusupov victory.
   With his back to the wall, Karpov produced a tricky 52nd move
defense, activating the rook that eventually seized white's bishop.
   ``After he screwed up, Karpov defended very well,'' said British
Grandamster Nigel Short, the third-ranked player in the world.
   The Timman-Speelman encounter was a hard-fought battle riddled
with tactical tricks.
   Experts said Speelman, playing black had gained an advantage in
the early middlegame, but missed his way in the complications and
led Timman gain a dangerous initiative.
   The Dutch grandmaster sacrificed a knight to rip open Speelman's
king's defenses, but the Englishman beat back the attack to hold a
draw.
   The fourth round will be played Saturday.

<HEAD>College Presidents, Deans Pick Yale, Swarthmore As Best Schools</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yale University and Swarthmore College were
named the nation's best colleges in a survey of college presidents
and deans released Thursday.
   U.S. News and World Report, in its annual survey, said Yale
ranked at the top of 204 national universities and Swarthmore was
the best of the 141 national liberal-arts colleges, both for the
second year in a row.
   Several colleges and universities topped a number of categories
in the magazine's special report on ``America's Best Colleges,''
scheduled to go on sale Monday. For example:
   _St. Mary's College of Maryland, Transylvania University of
Kentucky, Ohio Wesleyan University and Southwestern University of
Texas were named the best of the 384 regional liberal-arts colleges.
   _Worcester Polytechnic Institute of Massachusetts, Wake Forest
University of North Carolina, Illinois Wesleyan University and
Trinity University of Texas were named the best of the 562 regional
colleges and universities.
   _Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., and Harvey Mudd College in
Claremont, Calif., were called the nation's top business and
engineering specialty schools, respectively.
   U.S. News said the colleges and universities were ranked on
their records in five areas, including quality of the student body
and faculty, reputation for academic excellence and financial
resources.
   About 60 percent of the 3,879 college presidents, deans of
academic affairs and deans of admission polled at 1,294 schools
responded to the U.S. News survey on academic reputation.
   Following Yale as top national universities were Princeton
University, Harvard University, California Institute of Technology,
Duke University, Stamford University, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Dartmouth College, University of Chicago and Rice
University.
   Top liberal-arts colleges, behind Swarthmore, were Amherst,
Williams, Pomona, Bryn Mawr, Wellesley, Smith, Wesleyan, Oberlin
and Grinnell.
   For the first time, U.S. News asked college presidents and
administrators to identify the country's up-and-coming schools.
Arizona State University topped the national universities category,
Centre College of Kentucky led the national liberal-arts colleges
and, under regional colleges and universities, Towson State
University in Maryland, College of Charleston, S.C., Buena Vista
College in Iowa and San Diego State University were at the top.

   A 15-year-old boy with a shotgun and a
handgun took a high school drama class hostage Thursday, wounding a
youth who dared him to shoot but surrendering later without further
violence, police said.
   The wounded youth was in fair condition after the 40-minute
confrontation at Loara High School with the teenage gunman police
identified as Cory Robb.
   ``We have had contact with him before in our department,''
Police Chief Joseph Molloy said.
   Robb, armed with a 12-gauge shotgun and an automatic, entered
the class of 35 students, shot the victim, Tony Lopez, 15, within
the first few minutes, then ordered the teacher out of the room,
Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said.
   Ten minutes later, he let the girls and the wounded boy to
leave, but 10 or 12 boys remained. A police negotiator began
talking to the boy and he later put down his weapons and walked out
of the classroom, officers said.
   Robb had only been a student at Loara for a few weeks and
``there was nothing to indicate he was after one particular
student,'' Hedgpeth said.
   Student Mindy DeLuca said she was in the class when Robb entered
wearing a trench coat and holding a gun.
   He told the teacher, identified only as Mr. Tuttle, to leave the
auditorium and lock the door behind him, Miss DeLuca said, and the
teacher said: ``Come on class, we're going.''
   The boy again told the teacher to leave alone and lock the door.
   Miss DeLuca said the boy then told the class to ```go sit with
friends, do whatever you want to.' He was relaxed after that.''
   ``I thought it was a joke because it was in drama,'' she said.
   The armed boy was calm at the outset but one boy began
antagonizing him, said drama student Jimmy Hurley, 15.
   ``He was telling him to `shoot me' _ and he did,'' Hurley said.
   The wounded boy and the alleged assailant had had no contact and
may not have even known each other, Hedgpeth said.
   Some students said Robb had been threatening some kind of
violent action in notes and telephone calls to friends. Hedgpeth
said he had heard such student reports but did not know if they
were true.
   The principal closed the school to reporters and there was no
general sign of the shooting's effect on students. Some parents,
however, arrived to take their children home.
   Ninth-grade student Chuck Hartman, 14, said he has been a
classmate of Robb's since the fourth or fifth grade and knew him as
a troubled boy who hates his stepfather and loved fire and guns.
   Hartman said he was in an adjacent room when the incident began
and his teacher told the class to ``get down and stay away from the
windows.''
   Another student, Phil Harvey, 14, heard the shot.
   ``The teacher came in and said to get down, someone's been
shot,'' Harvey said.
   The wounded student, also a 15-year-old boy, was in fair
condition with a wound to the left side of the face that did not
appear to be serious, said Fran Tardiff, spokeswoman at University
of California Irvine Medical Center.
   The Anaheim Union School District sent psychologists to counsel
troubled students, said Lee Kellogg, assistant district
superintendent.
   ``We're encouraging students to remain in class,'' Kellogg said.
   The school is 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles.

   Sexual assault counselors and
women's groups reacted with anger and disbelief Thursday to a
jury's acquittal of a rape suspect on the grounds that the woman
wore a lace miniskirt without underwear.
   ``It's a fairly horrendous verdict,'' said Ellen Vargyas at the
National Women's Law Center in Washington, D.C. ``No one,
regardless of how they are dressed, should be allowed to be raped
under a knife.''
   The three male and three female Broward Circuit Court jurors
publicly justified their verdict Wednesday to acquit a 26-year-old
drifter, who then was ordered returned to Georgia to face several
rape and assault charges.
   ``We felt she asked for it for the way she was dressed,'' said
jury foreman Roy Diamond. ``The way she was dressed with that
skirt, you could see everything she had. She was advertising for
sex.''
   ``She was obviously dressed for a good time, but we felt she may
have bit off more than she could chew,'' said juror Mary Bradshaw.
   The detective who handled the initial phase of the case called
the acquittal ``very disappointing.''
   ``I honestly believe as a police officer that he raped her, that
he forcibly had sex with her,'' said Detective Tom White of the
Indian River County Sheriff's Department.
   The 22-year-old woman testified that Steven Lord abducted her at
knife-point from a Fort Lauderdale restaurant parking lot in
November 1988 and raped her repeatedly during a trip north on
Interstate 95. She said she escaped five hours later in Indian
River County, about 120 miles north.
   Defense attorney Tim Day told jurors the woman agreed to have
sex with Lord in exchange for $100 and cocaine, but later changed
her mind.
   Jurors said they also were swayed by the woman's calm demeanor
in court, compared to the emotional testimony of a 24-year-old
Georgia woman who claims Lord raped her at knife-point last year.
   ``When the Georgia woman testified, my heart sank,'' said juror
Dean Medeiros. ``But when the other one testified, she didn't
appear to be shaken up. Basically, we didn't believe her story.''
   ``I thought this was 1989,'' said Alexander Siegel, attorney for
the woman, who was jailed six days in June after failing to answer
subpoenas for court appearances. ``I guess this means every pervert
and nut out there has a license to rape any person who dresses in a
manner they think is provocative.''
   ``The whole idea that a woman is asking for it is horrendous,''
said Dorothea Gallagher of the National Organization for Women's
Broward County chapter.
   Several activists noted that rape suspects often use the
argument of a victim's attire or mannerisms for their defense. In
1984, four men in New Bedford, Mass., were convicted of a barroom
gang rape after a widely publicized trial that included allegations
the woman enticed the men. The incident was the basis for the movie
``The Accused.''
   ``This verdict tells women that if they dress in a certain way
or go alone into a bar they are somehow open for assault,'' said
Joanne Richter, director of the Broward County Sexual Assualt
Treatment Division in Fort Lauderdale.
   ``With this type of attitude they should close the beaches in
Fort Lauderdale,'' said Christine Edmunds, spokewoman for the
Washington-based National Organization for Victim Assistance.
   Sally Goldfarb, staff attorney at the NOW Legal Defense and
Education Fund in New York, believes the jurors' sentiments are not
unusual, although few make such public post-trial comments.
   ``In most rape trials it's the victim, not the suspect, that's
on trial,'' said Ms. Goldfarb. ``There's a perception that `nice
women' don't get raped, nice women don't go certain places and nice
women don't wear certain clothes. ... These attitudes are still
very much alive among both men and women.''

   Former Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr.
urged an aide to arrange financing for a New York City project
after receiving a written appeal from another Reagan administration
official, documents released Thursday show.
   Pierce's handwritten instruction to former executive assistant
Deborah Gore Dean to ``check into this and try to get it through''
suggests a more active role than Pierce has acknowledged in
securing federal housing subsidies for individuals who made
requests to him personally.
   In response to Freedom of Information Act requests, HUD on
Thursday released more than 20,000 pages of documents from the
files of Dean, whose position made her a key official at HUD and
who has refused to testify before Congress on constitutional
grounds.
   In the files were letters showing Dean received requests for
help on projects from members of Congress, including Democrats, and
other officials. The files also show then-Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger and White House aides were among the politically
connected who contacted Pierce and Dean regarding HUD projects and
another occassion in which former HUD Secretary Carla Hills
convinced Pierce to overrule subordinates in favor of her clients.
   In testimony before a congressional panel last spring, Pierce
said he received many requests for aid from friends and political
allies, and that he always referred them to appropriate staff
members with the instruction that they were to receive ``careful
consideration.''
   Pierce, who last month refused to testify again before Congress
citing his constitutional right against self-incrimination, said in
his May appearance that his instructions were not a recommendation
or order to approve funds.
   ``Over time, people ask me to help them get all kinds of
benefits and things like that and my answer to them has always been
the same thing,'' Pierce said. ``It's been basically that we'll
give your request very careful consideration and if your request
suits all of our requirements, you'll have a chance of getting what
you're seeking.''
   The New York project was mentioned in a 1985 handwritten note to
Pierce from the Department of Commerce's assistant secretary for
productivity, technology and innovation, urging HUD to back a
proposed housing project in the Morningside Heights area of
Manhattan near Columbia University.
   At the bottom, in Pierce's handwritting, was written: ``To
Debbie _ Check into this and try to get it through.'' It bears
Pierce's initials, ``SRP Jr.''
   The note to Pierce was addressed simply ``Sam,'' and signed
``Bruce,'' on stationery of the assistant secretary of commerce.
   D. Bruce Merrifield, who held that Commerce position at the
time, could not be reached in calls to his home, or the American
Electronics Association, where he is a consultant. The Commerce
official's note said he was familiar with the project through his
church, which had supported the project.
   The $5.6 million, 99-unit senior-citizen housing project was
granted $1.2 million in rental subsidies, according to Francine
Kellman, spokeswoman for the HUD regional office in New York.
   Pierce's attorney, Paul L. Perito, said he had not seen the
letter to Pierce and was not familiar with the project. But he said
there was ``nothing incriminatory in that situation.''
   ``Any Cabinet secretary occupies a political position and there
may be a range of reasons why in his judgment he thought it was a
worthy project,'' Perito said. ``And in any project in which he has
shown an interest he has never asked anyone to deviate from
responsible, professional government standards.''
   At the time the Commerce official recommended the project to
Pierce, developers were proposing to mix elderly housing with
student housing for Columbia University. Kellman said the student
housing proposal was dropped and the project was developed by the
Ecumenical Community Development Organization.
   Stuart Weisberg, staff director of the House subcommittee
probing the HUD scandals, said the letter was one of several the
panel has that ``suggest some people got more than careful
consideration'' from HUD under Pierce.
   On another occasion, documents showed that after a private
research company wrote Pierce to complain that several of its bids
for HUD work had been rejected, the secretary wrote to Dean:
``Let's try to help this fellow. I think he and his company have
been unfairly treated.''
   It could not be immediately determined whether that firm later
got HUD work.
   Weinberger's name surfaced on two notes by aides discussing a
project he had recommended to Pierce. One of the aides said the
project had not been awarded funds but ``will be a good candidate
for the secretary's discretionary fund.'' It could not be
immediately determined whether the project was ultimately given HUD
money.
   Mrs. Hills, now the Bush administration's trade representative,
appealed to Pierce after a California client trying to sell a
HUD-backed development was told it would have to pay $1.3 million
into reserve accounts before the deal could be approved. Pierce, on
Dean's recommendation, agreed to reduce the amount to $855,000, the
records show.
   The five boxes of files shed additional light on Ms. Dean's
power at HUD and her frequent contacts with prominent Republicans,
developers with HUD dealings, Pierce's former law partners and
others:
   _She once rewrote a draft of a speech the White House had
prepared for a visit by President Reagan to an elementary school.
``Please excuse our crassness,'' she said in a note to the White
House accompanying her revised version.
   _In a handwritten note to Pierce, Ms. Dean said the department's
Office of General Counsel ``can find no document that says you have
ever delegated authority over Mod Rehab to anyone.''
   The Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program was found by the
department's inspector general to have been to be riddled with
political influence; Pierce has said he delegated the power to
award the lucrative subsidies to a three-member committee that
included Dean.
   _While members of Congress have expressed outrage at the power
she held, Dean's files show she was frequently lobbied by members
and their staffs. Mayors, other local officials and prominent
Republicans also frequently wrote her to support HUD proposals or
applicants for jobs at the department.

<HEAD>Farmer Finds Engine Part in Field</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A farmer in northwest Iowa found what
appears to be part of an engine of the DC-10 that crashed in Sioux
City, officials said Thursday, and more parts may be discovered as
farmers harvest their crops.
   Officials of General Electric Co., which made the CF6-6 engine,
and the National Transportation Safety Board hope that missing
parts of the engine will provide clues to why United Airlines
Flight 232 crashed July 19. The crash killed 112 people, but 184
survived.
   Several parts of the plane were found in farmers' fields on the
day of the crash, and GE has offered cash rewards for other parts.
The parts fell from the plane as it turned about 50 miles northeast
of Sioux City before making an emergency landing at the Sioux
Gateway Airport.
   So far, essential clues to the crash have eluded investigators,
but that may be changing, said Buena Vista County Sheriff Chuck
Eddy.
   ``The harvest is in full swing right now, and they're getting
crops out, and they're able to see where they haven't been able to
see before,'' Eddy said.
   The farmer found what appears to be part of a turbine fan blade
while combining his field and took it to the sheriff's office
Thursday morning. It was turned over to a GE official, Eddy said.
   Husman said he found the part on Friday, but continued to
harvest his crop until rain idled him on Thursday.
   The piece appears to be part of one of 38 blades to a main
engine disk, Eddy said. The disk, which weighs 290 pounds without
the blades and is 31 inches in diameter, could be a major clue to
the crash, investigators say.
   Eddy said seven or eight pieces have been turned in this week,
and several other farmers have called to report finding more parts,
mostly scraps of aluminum or stainless steel, he said.

Say</HEAD>

170 freight trains still idled in Azerbaijan. EDITS to trim. No pickup.</HEAD>

   Soldiers guarded rail shipments of food, fuel and
other vital supplies shipped through Azerbaijan to Armenia that
have been blocked for two months in a violent ethnic feud between
the two republics, official media said Thursday.
   The official Tass news agency said troops also escorted 43
trucks _ 13 carrying food _ to destinations in Nagorno-Karabakh,
the predominantly Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan that is the main
point of contention.
   Although many shipments got through, ``The situation remains
tense in Azerbaijan and the blockade of Armenia continues,'' Tass
said Thursday night, citing reports from the Interior Ministry,
which is in charge of law enforcement.
   ``In August and September, 32,000 rail cars ... failed to reach
Armenia from Azerbaijan due to sabotage,'' Moscow radio said. In
Azerbaijan, ``bridges were burned and trains were attacked with
fire'' to prevent them from reaching Armenia.
   It said troops were sent after the Supreme Soviet legislature
adopted an emergency resolution Tuesday ordering the ministries of
defense and interior to restore rail traffic between the southern
republics in the Caucasus Mountains.
   On Thursday night Tass said 21 freight trains totaling 603 cars
_ 101 carrying fuel _ went to Armenia through the Caucasus. But it
said 171 freight cars were still idled in Azerbaijan, including 89
originally destined for Armenia.
   Most supplies for Armenia must pass through Azerbaijan.
   The blockades were said to be an outgrowth of the dispute over
which republic should control Nagorno-Karabakh, a Christian
Armenian enclave which has been part of Moslem-dominated Azerbaijan
since 1923. The dispute has claimed 117 lives since violence
erupted 19 months ago.
   Avel Pogosyan, an editor at Armenpress news agency in Yerevan,
Armenia's capital, said in a telephone interview that troops began
arriving Wednesday night. He gave no information as to how many.
   Striking rail workers in Azerbaijan, motivated by their
government's demands that it retain control over Nagorno-Karabakh,
created a virtual economic blockade of Armenia by blocking rail
lines and sabotaging cargoes, news reports said.
   In Azerbaijan's capital of Baku, an editor at the official
Azerinform news agency said no sign was seen of troops in the
Caspian Sea port city and trains there were not being guarded. He
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim P. Perfilyev said he had no
information on deployment of troops in the republics.
   Because of the blockade and sabotage, workers in Armenia do not
have fuel and supplies to continue attempts to rebuild housing
demolished by the Dec. 7 earthquake that killed 25,000 people,
Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya said.
   ``Thousands of tons of fuel have not been delivered and as a
result, even emergency aid vehicles cannot be filled with fuel,''
the newspaper said. ``As winter approaches, restoration plans are
not being fulfilled and foreign specialists are leaving
construction sites.''
   The newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted Azerbaijani Deputy
Prosecutor R. Safarliev as saying the strike was in retaliation for
purported Armenian sabotage of Azerbaijan railroads in July and
August.
   ``This actually provoked the strike by railroad workers ... .and
the blockade itself,'' Safarliev said. But he added, ``I want to
emphasize that these measures cannot be justified.''

   British and Irish officials spent nearly eight
hours Thursday in a second round of talks on Northern Ireland
security issues but reported no conclusions beyond a joint
condemnation of terrorism.
   Talks will continue soon, they said, without elaborating.
   The session at the Northern Ireland Office in London ended with
a joint statement that made no reference to intelligence leaks from
within the British province's security forces _ a major point of
concern.
   Leaked details of suspected members of the Irish Republican Army
are claimed to have been used by Protestant extremists to select
assassination targets in the province's continuing sectarian and
political fighting.
   An investigation is under way.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting British rule in
Northern Ireland. It wants to unite the predominantly Protestant
province with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland under
socialist rule.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke, the British Cabinet
member responsible for the province, and Irish Foreign Minister
Gerry Collins led the two sides in Thursday's talks.

<TEXT>
   Senate leaders Thursday night began exploring
the possibility of stripping from a massive deficit-reduction bill
every extraneous provison, a move that could doom for the time
being President Bush's proposed capital-gain tax cut.
   Unless that is done, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell,
D-Maine, told colleagues, it is virtually certain that arbitrary
across-the-board cuts in most federal programs will be triggered on
Oct. 16.
   ``For us to allow a sequester (automatic cuts) to take place, I
believe, destroys confidence in government and destroys confidence
in those who are responsible for governing,'' said Sen. James
Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
   The suggestion that all non-deficit provisions be removed from
the deficit-cutting bill, known as the reconciliation bill, was
embraced immediately by Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, senior
Republican on the Finance Committee.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said he would
discuss the proposal with Bush Friday morning. ``There may be an
opportunity here,'' he said.
   The bill is made up of revenue increases, user fees and
generally small cuts in a variety of spending programs, such as
Medicare, that are not subject to annual appropriations.
   In writing the bill, committees _ especially the tax-writing
Finance Committee _ have tacked on scores of popular ideas. These
range from a major improvement in child-care benefits to allowing
Social Security beneficiaries to earn more in retirement.
   The Finance Committee earlier this week added dozens of
miscellaneous tax breaks for a host of special interests.
   The biggest issue of all on the bill is whether to encourage
increased saving by cutting capital-gains taxes, as Bush proposes,
or by expanding tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts, as
recommended by Democratic leaders.
   ``We've got a crisis in this country,'' Mitchell said in a
speech on the floor outlining his proposal. ``What we must do is
restore a sense of responsibility ... in dealing with the deficit.''
   Senate leaders of both parties began meeting immediately to see
if the proposal is workable. Should Mitchell's idea prove
successful, the Senate might avoid meeting over the weekend and
might be able to salvage the recess scheduled next week.
   Otherwise, the Senate is expected to begin work on the bill
Friday night, work at least on Saturday and probably give up most
of the recess.

<TEXT>
   U.S. officials, describing the aborted Panama
coup as the administration's first ``crisis operation,'' said
Thursday the effort to overthrow Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was
doomed by misjudgments by the rebels as well as by American forces'
lack of flexibility.
   ``Every administration has a shakedown in one way or another and
we've learned some things about our operation that we need to
improve,'' said a senior administration official who insisted on
anonymity. ``And we'll improve them.''
   ``This is our first bloodletting, if you will,'' he said, the
first ``kind of a crisis operation.''
   Another U.S. official, evaluating the events of the past two
days, said the American forces in Panama were prepared for any
contingency _ ``from the maximum all the way to the minimum.'' But
this official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said
constraints were placed on Gen. Maxwell Thurman of the Southern
Command, who assumed his duties in Panama just two days before the
insurrection.
   Evaluations also were beginning on Capitol Hill where Sen. David
Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said
his panel and the Senate Armed Services Committee were conducting
an investigation of the administration's handling of the coup.
   ``We're going to get to the bottom of this,'' said Boren, who
was among the earliest to criticize Bush for inaction.
   The Senate adopted, 99 to 1, a resolution proposed by Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., that expressed support for Bush's efforts to
democratize Panama through a ``full range of economic, diplomatic
and military options.'' Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., was the lone
dissenter.
   While the official post-mortems were under way, Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney said it was ``hogwash'' to suggest that the
United States had refused an offer from the rebels to take custody
of Noriega.
   But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., did just that, telling the Senate,
``They (the rebels) told the U.S. officers that they were holding
Noriega captive, and requested U.S. assistance to take custody of
Noriega and remove him to the United States.''
   Cheney said that rebels refused in a ``face-to-face contact''
with a U.S. military officer to turn over Noriega during the coup
attempt.
   Helms also said that coup leader, Maj. Moises Giroldi, had been
executed in Panama, adding, ``I have received reports from Panama
that Noriega personally shot the major.''
   U.S. officials agreed that Giroldi probably was killed but added
they were not certain.
   A State Department source, speaking on condition that he not be
identified, said U.S. officials are working on the belief that
reports of Giroldi's death are ``solid information.''
   ``He and at least two others have been shot. The story is they
were trying to escape,'' the source said, adding that the
administration officials do not give much credence to allegations
of an attempt to escape.
   One official, speaking anonymously, said if the rebels had
delivered Noriega to a U.S. military facility, he would have been
flown to Florida before nightfall Tuesday to face federal drug
charges dating to February 1988.
   Cheney and other administration officials continued their
defense of Bush's handling of the coup attempt, and the decision
not to become involved militarily. White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said, ``To have a handful of congressmen suggest it was
the wrong course is a pretty minor response.''
   At the same time, the administration emphasized its continued
opposition to Noriega by arranging for former opposition vice
presidential candidate Guillermo Ford to meet with Bush, Vice
President Dan Quayle and Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   In an appearance at the Capitol, Ford said Guillermo Endara,
whose election as Panama's president was nullified by Noriega, had
taken refuge in a party headquarters building which was surrounded
by Noriega security forces.
   ``Mr. Endara feels he's been detained by the defense forces,''
said Ford. ``He is a very brave man. We are going to fight the
dictatorship, no matter what.''
   He said democracies must help Panama, adding, ``It's very hard
to overthrow a dictatorship with rocks in your hand.''
   Helms was not alone in criticizing the administration.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., called the administration's story
a ``weak-kneed explanation for failure'' and said the United States
had ``botched'' the handling of the coup. ``It's an incredible
stain on us,'' he said.
   Speaking only on condition they not be identified by name, U.S.
officials placed primary responsibility for the failure of the coup
on the rebels.
   ``It was their failure, not ours,'' one said.
   Bush's personal involvement in Tuesday morning's events was not
clear but the officials said his heavy schedule prevented him from
devoting full time to the subject.
   Two hours after the first shots were fired, Bush went to the
White House south lawn for the arrival ceremony of Mexican
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and much of the late morning
was devoted to Salinas.
   The rebels were described by one U.S. official as ``extremely
naive'' in their assumptions and judgments. Cited specifically were
the decision to release Noriega after holding him for several hours
and the assumptions that a key battalion would not come to
Noriega's aid and that the Panamanian people would join the
rebellion.
   Washington's reluctance to give U.S. commanders the flexibility
to deal with rapidly changing developments also was cited as an
important factor in the failure of the coup.
   The U.S. Southern Command, having been alerted about 30 hours in
advance that a move against Noriega was afoot, began blocking key
access routes to the military headquarters before dawn on Tuesday.
   Shortly after sunrise, an estimated 200 rebels seized control of
the Defense Force headquarters and took Noriega into custody.
   Most of the access routes pass through U.S. military
installations, and U.S. commanders acted within their authority in
blockading them, the officials said.
   But the pro-Noriega forces surprised the rebels by using a
Boeing 727 and some smaller aircraft to fly about 100 troops to an
airstrip near the headquarters. Shortly thereafter, Battalion 2000,
to the surprise of the rebels, threw its support to Noriega after
refusing to take sides in the early going.
   The U.S. officials said that although the U.S. military command
in Panama had troops on key routes, they lacked the discretionary
authority to counter surprise moves by forces loyal to Noriega.
   As officials described it, the worst misjudgment of the rebels
was to set Noriega free after the headquarters was surrounded.
   If Noriega had been flown out, ``the loyalist forces wouldn't
have anybody to be loyal to'' and the post-Noriega era would have
begun in Panama, one official said.
   Defending the Bush administration against charges that it acted
timidly in not coming to the aid of the rebels, Cheney said in an
interview with CBS that the coup leaders had no intention of
forcing Noriega from the country. ``This was not a situation where
we had a pro-democracy movement trying to topple a dictator and
restore democracy to Panama,'' he said.

   Twenty relatives of political
prisoners and ``disappeared'' people stormed the Costa Rican
Embassy and seized 19 hostages Thursday to protest against
Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist government.
   ``We are here to denounce human rights violations and so that
the Costa Rican government pressures Cristiani to end the
repression against the people,'' a spokeswoman for the mostly women
activists said in an interview.
   Reports conflicted on whether the activists were armed.
   Special National Police units surrounded the six-story Central
American Building, but no violence was reported. The embassy is on
the third floor.
   Costa Rican Ambassador Jesus Manuel Fernandez told The
Associated Press by telephone from the embassy that he asked
military authorities at the scene to lift the cordon around the
building. He said his request was being considered. Monsignor
Arturo Rivera Damas, the Roman Catholic archbishop of San Salvador,
entered the embassy shortly after nightfall, presumably trying to
resolve the standoff.
   Consul General Humberto Murillo and First Secretary Rene Aldama
also were held. Most other hostages were people visiting the
embassy on business. Fifteen journalists and five people from the
Green Cross, a local first aid group, also were inside but not
considered hostages.
   Red Cross personnel took sandwiches to those inside.
   Fernandez, who has a heart condition, said he was ``fine ... I
have been brought my medicine, and the Red Cross doctor examined
me.'' He said there were 20 demonstrators, most of them women.
   Fernandez said earlier some demonstrators were armed, but he did
not identify the weapons.
   Reporters said they saw a handgun tucked into the waistband of
at least one young man who stormed the mission. They also said
demonstrators carried newspaper-wrapped packets that appeared to
have a fuse.
   Government spokesman Mauricio Sandoval told reporters the
takeover was ``an act of provocation'' but was being dealt with
``calmly, so no one gets hurt.''
   The activists' spokeswoman, who refused to give her name, said
they had no weapons.
   The spokeswoman said the activists belonged to The Federation of
Committees of Mothers and Relatives of Political Prisoners,
Disappeared and Assassinated People of El Salvador. She said they
planned to stay at the embassy until its demands were met.
   The Federation of Committees for the past eight years has
protested the kidnapping and killing of suspected leftists by
rightist death squads.
   ``It is very sad that there are people who believe that violence
can be the good instrument to get what they want,'' said President
Oscar Arias of Costa Rica when informed of the embassy takeover.
   Arias, winner of the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for devising a
Central American peace plan, spoke at a news conference in San
Jose, Calif., where he was visiting. He said he would return home
if the situation grew worse.
   In San Jose, Costa Rica, Foreign Ministry spokesman Dino
Starcewic said, ``Shortly after midday, a woman employee at the
embassy called us to say that a group of attackers had seized the
embassy and taken people hostage, and that they are heavily armed,
with rifles and even hand grenades.''
   The activists went past security guards pretending they wanted
to apply for visas to go to Costa Rica, Starcewic said in a
telephone interview.
   More than 70,000 people have been killed since a leftist
guerrilla war began a decade ago, and human rights groups say a
large number of the victims have been civilians slain by the death
squads.

government weather agency said.
   There were no immediate reports of damage.
   Angela was moving west-northwest toward Ilocos Norte province,
about 250 miles north of Manila, at 12 miles per hour, said the
Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services
Administration.
   The forecast service said storm warnings were hoisted over the
provinces in northern and central Luzon, including the provinces of
Pampanga and Zambales, sites of the U.S.-run Clark Air Base and
Subic Bay Naval Base.
   Angela, the 15th typhoon to hit the Philippines this year, was
expected to move out into the China Sea late Friday.
   An average of 20 typhoons or tropical storms strike the
Philippines every year.

   A federal judge upheld Hialeah's ban on animal
sacrifice Thursday, saying the Constitution protects only the
Santeria religion's beliefs, not its practices.
   U.S. District Judge Eugene P. Spellman upheld ordinances passed
in 1987 after a Santeria priest, Ernesto Pichardo, announced he
would open a church that would include in its ritual the sacrifice
of chickens, goats and other animals. Representatives of the
Afro-Cuban religion said there would be an appeal.
   Spellman said the city's witnesses during the August federal
court trial established that the regulation of animal sacrifice had
valid purposes such as safeguarding public health and animal
welfare.
   The ordinance is not targeted at Santeria followers but is meant
``to prohibit all animal sacrifice, whether it be practiced by an
individual or a religion or a cult,'' the judge wrote.
   Officials in Hialeah, a largely Hispanic Miami suburb, said they
were delighted with the ruling.
   ``We spent substantial time in drafting ordinances that we felt
addressed the issues to minimize the effect on religious practice
of the church,'' said Deputy City Attorney Richard Gross. ``We hope
the church is able to continue to practice its beliefs.''
   Pichardo said his church would make a formal announcement of its
legal plans on Friday.
   ``The ruling is biased,'' Pichardo told the Associated Press,
``and it becomes broad now where it directly affects the Jewish
faith, the Muslim faith, all Afro-Caribbean religions, and all
Asian religions in the United States.
   ``It literally makes them all outlaws,'' he said.
   Pichardo's attorney, Maurice Rosen, who represented Santeria
followers, said the group would appeal all the way to the U.S.
Supreme Court if necessary.
   Robyn Blumner, head of the American Civil Liberties Union in
Florida, said Santeria beliefs and practices cannot be separated.
   ``We have today seen that a community can bar certain religions
because they find their orthodoxies distasteful,'' she said.
   She also noted that the U.S. Supreme Court is considering a case
this term on the right of American Indians to take peyote, a piece
of cactus that is chewed for the drug mescaline, as part of their
religion, and said that decision could affect the Santeria case.
   In his ruling, the judge referred to Santeria's 400-year
history, tracing its roots from Africa to Cuba and into the United
States, saying the religion now has an estimated 50,000 to 60,000
followers in South Florida.
   Spellman wrote that the U.S. melting pot has absorbed cultures
from around the world and noted the First Amendment protected the
beliefs of immigrants who follow widely varying religions.
   But freedom of religion is not absolute ``when we are dealing,
as here, with the manner in which the religion is conducted, rather
than the beliefs of those seeking to exercise it,'' Spellman wrote.
   Reasonable regulation of those practices _ as Hialeah did by
banning sacrifices _ is not discriminatory, the judge said.
   Santeria is considered a lower-class religion by many Cubans and
was largely underground until Pichardo announced the founding of
the church and touched off the legal controversy.
   Animal sacrifices, performed only by Santeria priests, are used
to invoke the spirits for a blessing, good luck and in faith
healing.

   A geologist's chance discovery of the Earth's
oldest known rocks will help researchers open a window on the solar
system in its infancy, scientists say.
   The rocks are only about 600 million years younger than the
Earth itself, which scientists believe was formed about 4.6 billion
years ago.
   ``It's quite remarkable,'' said Jim Cole, a geologist with the
U.S. Geological Survey. ``We've known for a long time that rocks
are 3.2, 3.4 billion years old ... but these are quite a bit
older.''
   ``It's just rare to be able to lay your hands on a piece of
stone that has survived intact for almost 4 billion years.''
   Samuel Bowring, a geologist at Washington University, stumbled
on the granitic rocks in 1986 during a summer of ordinary geologic
investigation in a remote area of Canada.
   ``I picked up the rock and said ... `Boy, this is a good-looking
rock. Let's collect it,''' said Bowring, who has been conducting
research in Canada's Northwest Territories since 1979.
   To date the rocks, Bowring extracted tiny crystals of the
mineral zircon from them and analyzed it with a sensitive high
mass-resolution ion microprobe at the Australian National
University in Canberra.
   That instrument put the age of the rocks at 3.962 billion years,
``give or take 3 million years,'' Bowring said.
   The results of his research, in collaboration with two
Australian scientists, Ian Williams and William Compston, are to be
published in the November issue of Geology, a publication of the
Geological Society of America.
   Geologists say that studying the chemistry of the rocks will
give them insight into the early history of Earth and its fellow
planets.
   ``With this new discovery, we are a giant step further in our
search for knowledge of what happened in the Earth's first 800
million years,'' Bowring said.
   Few rocks of this age are left, since the Earth's surface has
been churned and recycled by meteorites, volcanoes, erosion and the
slow but constant movement of the continents, scientists said.
   Scientists reckon the first dinosaurs began to roam the land
about 200 million years ago, and the first human ancestors who used
tools didn't show up until about 2 million years ago.

   A man told police he strangled his wife and was
being booked at city jail Thursday when he learned the victim was
not only alive but had already been jailed herself on unrelated
charges, authorities said.
   A man called police early Thursday and said in a frantic voice
that he had killed his 22-year-old wife and fled, leaving her body
on a bed in their apartment with their two small children, police
Sgt. Don Jensen said.
   The 23-year-old Milwaukee man then waited at a telephone booth
for officers to arrest him.
   While he was being booking, investigators learned of a woman
arrested late Wednesday who said she had been choked into
unconsciousness by her husband, Jensen said.
   The woman was arrested on two warrants charging her with passing
worthless checks when she left Northwest General Hospital, where
she had gone Wednesday evening for treatment, police Capt. Richard
Abram said.
   Not until officers investigating the reported homicide were able
to trace the woman to jail were they able to tell her husband that
he had not committed a murder after all, Jensen said. He said the
husband was expected to be charged with a misdemeanor count of
domestic violence battery.
   The couple's names were not immediately released.
   Investigators reported the woman said her husband choked her
during a confrontation in which she accused him of stealing $300 of
her money and spending it on cocaine, Abram said.
   A neighbor told officers she saw the woman leave the apartment
with her children and her brother Wednesday evening. Jensen said
the children remained in the brother's custody.

   The 36 tons of cocaine seized over the last
week is a clear indication that Colombia's war on drugs is creating
chaos for cocaine kingpins, federal officials said Thursday.
   ``We're seizing a lot more cocaine because a lot more cocaine's
moving out, because it's not safe to leave it in Colombia any
more,'' Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said at a news
conference in front of a boat on which more than six tons of
cocaine was found.
   Drug cartels used to keep large stockpiles of cocaine in
Colombia and move it gradually to the United States, he said, but
they're now moving it in huge lots.
   ``That's because of the pressure from the government in
Colombia,'' he said. Colombia has cracked down heavily on drug
traffickers since a leading presidential candidate was assassinated
Aug. 18.
   Skinner spoke in front of the Zedom Sea, a rusty, dented
185-foot offshore supply boat turned freighter. The Coast Guard
seized the boat Monday in the Gulf of Mexico, then handed over the
cargo and the crew of nine Colombians _ eight men and a woman _
Thursday to the Drug Enforcement Administration.
   The nine were arraigned later on charges of importing cocaine
and possession with intent to distribute cocaine. U.S. Magistrate
Alma Chasez ordered each held without bond and appointed a public
defender to represent them.
   If convicted of the charges, they could be sentenced to life
imprisonment.
   ``We will throw the book at them,'' said U.S. Attorney John
Volz. ``We will try to get as much prison time as we can.''
   Also Thursday, DEA spokesman Billy Fernandes said cocaine found
aboard the Zedom Sea, originally estimated at 11,500 pounds,
actually totaled 12,208 pounds and had a street value of nearly
$554.9 million.
   The cocaine on the Zedom Sea was one of four major finds in less
than a week.
   Texas state troopers found nine tons of the drug Wednesday in
Harlingen, stacked in a house believed to be a center for
repackaging cocaine after its arrival in the United States. Three
Mexicans were arraigned Thursday on charges of engaging in
organized criminal activity and aggravated cocaine possession.
   About 20 tons was found late last week in a Los Angeles
warehouse in what was described as the largest haul ever. And the
Coast Guard seized about 1{ tons near Puerto Rico over the weekend.
   ``It is not business as usual in the drug business today ...,''
said Skinner. ``The efforts in Colombia ... are creating what I'd
call chaos. And we're taking advantage of that, and we're seizing
cocaine that otherwise would have been transmitted in smaller
groups and probably would not have been detected.''
   In addition, he said, the various U.S. government agencies that
fight the drug trade are far more cooperative than they used to be.
   ``The turf fighting that I used to see many years ago, I don't
see now,'' he said.
   With the Gulf of Mexico and Puerto Rican seizures, the Coast
Guard's total take in the first four days of fiscal year 1990 is
more than that of all that the Coast Guard seized the previous
fiscal year, officials said. Federal fiscal years begin Oct. 1.
   And there may well be more on the Zedom Sea, said Ruben Monzon,
special agent in charge of the DEA's New Orleans office.
   The cocaine was found in two of 10 boxcar-size freight
containers stacked on the deck, but the Coast Guard was able to
search only the containers on top. DEA agents planned to search the
others, he said.
   The Zedom Sea was heading west from the Yucatan Peninsula when
the crew of the cutter Cushing boarded it.
   It's likely that the ship was on a route known as the
``Trampoline,'' from Colombia to Mexico, and from there to
California or west Texas, said Monzon.
   The route is being used more these days because stepped-up
patrols in Florida and along the Mexican border have increased the
danger of smuggling along more direct routes, he said.

   A Seoul criminal court sentenced the
Rev. Moon Ik-hwan to 10 years in prison Thursday for making an
illegal trip to communist North Korea after the dissident leader
walked out of the courtroom in protest.
   ``Sentence me as you please after I leave the court, although I
am not concerned about the penalty,'' the 71-year-old Moon said
before leaving.
   About 100 relatives and dissidents in the courtroom applauded
when the Presbyterian minister walked out. They also clapped
derisively when the presiding judge, Chung Sang-hak, announced the
sentence.
   Yoo Won-ho, a businessman who accompanied Moon on the trip to
North Korea in March, was also sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment
after walking out with Moon in protest.
   Defense lawyer Han Sung-hon said he would appeal. The
prosecution, which sought a life sentence, also said it would
appeal for a tougher penalty.
   Moon said later through his lawyers that he could not recognize
the court's authority. He gave no reason, but he sent a written
statement to the court Wednesday accusing it of having been
subservient to the administration.
   The court held that while acting out of idealistic hopes of
uniting the peninsula, Moon and Yoo aided North Korea's attempts to
undermine South Korea by encouraging dissident movements.
   Chung also noted that Moon had backed the North's call for
withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troops based in the South under a mutual
defense treaty.
   Public polls indicate most South Koreans support the U.S.
military presence as a deterrent to a North Korean military threat.
Moon and other dissidents say Washington keeps troops in South
Korea to block unification of the peninsula.
   The judge said he did not impose a longer sentence because of
Moon's age and because of the defendants' desire for reunification.
Moon has served jail sentences in the past for anti-government
activity.
   Moon secretly traveled to North Korea by way of Tokyo and
Beijing to meet communist leader Kim Il Sung and call for
unification of the divided Korean peninsula.
   South Korea's national security laws ban its citizens from
making unauthorized trips to North Korea.
   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since the peninsula was
divided in 1945. They are still technically at war since no peace
treaty was signed at the end of the Korean War in 1953.

<HEAD>NMFS Say Canneries Three More Asian Nations May Be Selling Illegal
Salmon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canneries in the Philippines, China and
Malaysia may be selling salmon illegally caught in the North
Pacific to European fish traders, federal law enforcement officials
said in memos obtained Thursday.
   The National Marine Fisheries Service said earlier that a Thai
cannery was offering thousands of tons of illegal salmon to French
brokers at prices 30 percent below similar U.S. products. Federal
agents also believe Korean canneries may be involved in such sales.
   According to one memo, traders in the United Kingdom imported
241 metric tons of canned salmon last year from the Philippines and
61 metric tons from China. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds or 10
percent larger than a U.S. ton.
   The memos were made available to The Associated Press by
congressional sources who insisted on not being identified.
   Under international law, salmon may not be taken on the high
seas except by fishing fleets of the country where they spawn.
   ``It is likely that the Philippine and Chinese product was
canned from imported Pacific salmon illegally harvested by the
Taiwanese,'' the memo said.
   A separate memo indicated that a Malaysian firm was offering
French brokers canned pink salmon at $38 per carton, or about $20
below what U.S. products sell for in Europe. A carton contains 48
half-pound cans.
   ``This is the cheapest salmon offered this season,'' the memo
said, adding that U.S. traders believe this was the first time a
Malaysian firm has offered canned salmon on the world market.
   The salmon processed by the Malaysian cannery was reportedly
imported from Singapore, the memo said.
   ``Several hundred tons of illegally harvested frozen pink salmon
earmarked for Thailand was said to be in cold-storage in Singapore
in mid-1988,'' the memo said. ``When the contract for this
particular shipment fell through, the salmon was purchased by
Malaysian processors.''
   U.S. fishermen have claimed that drift net vessels from Taiwan,
South Korea and Japan have been illegally catching salmon in the
North Pacific under the guise of fishing for squid. The fish are
then allegedly ``laundered'' through middlemen in Hong Kong and
Singapore to avoid detection by Taiwanese, Korean and Japanese
enforcement officials.
   The middlemen in turn sell the salmon to canneries in the Far
East which process the fish and offer them for sale on world
markets in direct competition with U.S. products.
   Up until now, it was thought that Thai canneries were the
leading processors of illgally caught salmon.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said Thursday he would introduce
legislation that would require that the United States seek to
establish an international ``certificate of origin'' program for
salmon being sold in world markets.
   ``Drastic action is needed to stem proliferation of illegal
canning,'' Murkowski said. ``If the trend is allowed to continue,
it would place the legitimate canned salmon industries of the U.S.,
Canada and the Soviet Union at extreme risk.''

   A few hundred homeless marchers wrapped
themselves in blankets on a stadium parking lot Thursday night as
their leaders complained that the demonstrators arriving in the
capital did not have an adequate place to sleep or use the bathroom.
   ``The conditions there are awful. These people are cold and
hungry and mad. How could this have happened?'' activist John
Steinbruck said.
   Activists blamed the National Union of the Homeless, which
organized the gathering, for failing to provide adequate facilities.
   Steinbruck said he took a truckload of blankets to the parking
lot at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium Thursday night. ``They have no
place to sleep. My truck was mobbed,'' he said.
   Victoria Luna, a spokeswoman for the National Union of the
Homeless, said: ``I think we're all doing the best job we can.
There were problems, I admit. Yesterday there was no water and no
blankets, and it was very cold.''
   Recent nighttime low temperatures in the nation's capital have
been about 50 degrees.
   A heated tent and eight outhouses are on the site, Luna said.
People who visited the site said 200 to 400 people were there.
   ``That's not to say that conditions there are adequate, but that
points out exactly what we are here protesting,'' she said. ``A lot
of us wish we were able to make people more comfortable.''
   ``They are very, very disorganized,'' said Community for
Creative Non-Violence spokeswoman Carol Fennely. Fennely said her
group, which runs the city's largest private homeless shelter, has
given the Union group about $4,000 to help pay for the convention.
   ``We haven't seen what they did with the money,'' she said.
   The homeless are gathered for what the group calls the nation's
first homeless convention.
   Luna said the group was preparing for an early morning march to
the Department of Housing and Urban Development on Friday.
   The homeless marchers went to the stadium parking lot after they
were turned away from a lot across the river in Virginia owned by
the Navy.

   Developer Donald Trump stunned the airline world
Thursday by offering a record $7 billion for the parent company of
American Airlines, capping weeks of takeover speculation about the
nation's biggest carrier.
   Stock in AMR Corp. shot higher after the company disclosed a
letter from the flashy tycoon to Chairman Robert L. Crandall,
offering $120 cash for each of AMR's 58.9 million outstanding
common shares.
   It would be the biggest airline buyout ever if completed. Trump
said his offer expires Oct. 20.
   AMR finished up $16.87{ at $99.87{ a share in heavy trading on
the the New York Stock Exchange. Other airline stocks also jumped
in related speculation.
   AMR also said its board would consider the proposal ``in due
course,'' but indicated probable rejection.
   In the letter, released by Trump's office in New York, Trump
said he had made a ``substantial investment'' in AMR and was
prepared to commit at least $1 billion of equity to the transaction.
   The letter did not disclose Trump's stake, but Trump officials
said he hasn't notified the Securities and Exchange Commission, as
required if his holdings exceeded 5 percent of AMR's outstanding
shares.
   Susan Heilbron, executive vice president of the Trump
Organization, said further financing details would be discussed
with AMR officials when they meet with Trump, although no meeting
has been set.
   Earlier this year Trump acquired Eastern Airlines' profitable
Northeast shuttle for $365 million, adding it to an empire built
mainly on huge real estate holdings that include hotels and
Atlantic City, N.J. casinos.
   Trump said his experience with the shuttle has given him
``substantial insight'' into airline competition.
   He praised AMR management and said he intended for it to
continue running AMR and ``work with me to build on the company's
reputation as the premier airline in the industry.''
   AMR has enjoyed strong financial results in recent years and has
an industry-leading 21.8 percent domestic market share. It's also
engaged in a major expansion that includes buying $23 billion worth
of planes. Analysts said any attempted buyout could prove difficult.
   The recent wave of airline takeovers, including the $3.65
billion buyout of Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc. and pending
$6.75 billion employee-management takeover of United Airlines
parent UAL Corp., has brought renewed government scrutiny of the
business.
   On Wednesday, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner reiterated
his opposition to buyouts dependent mainly on borrowed money, on
grounds that high debt can detract from important investments in
safety and a modernized fleet.
   Analysts also were skeptical of Trump's intentions, especially
considering his past record.
   Trump in recent years has acquired stakes or said he planned to
in Pan Am Corp., Golden Nugget, Allegis Corp., and Federated
Department Stores Inc., but other than a takeover of Resorts
International Inc. in 1988 he generally has not done so.
   In each case, he accumulated shares in the company _ sometimes
indicating he might be interested in mounting a buyout _ and later
sold all or some shares at a profit after the price rose on
takeover speculation or when another bidder emerged.
   Kevin Burke, who follows the airline industry for First Union
Corp., a bank holding company in Charlotte, N.C., said the $120
offer was at the high end of analysts' estimates of AMR's worth.
   The company also has enjoyed steady earnings growth. In the six
months ended June 30, AMR's profit rose to $278.9 million, or $4.43
a share, from $209.8 million, or $3.49 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose to $5.17 billion from $4.13 billion.

   Boeing Co. supervisors worked Thursday on
production of jetliners close to delivery as a strike by 57,000
Machinists union members continued with no new talks in sight.
   Boeing chairman Frank Shrontz apologized in a telegram to
Defense Secretary Richard Cheney for any delays the strike might
cause in delivery. Boeing manufactures structural components for
the B-2 bomber and other military planes.
   If the strike continues, ``delivery delays of our products will
be inevitable, but we will keep you apprised of our progress,''
Shrontz told Cheney. ``We hope the strike will be short-lived.''
   Also Thursday, industry analysts said the strike's outcome could
set a trend for contracts at other aerospace companies.
   No new negotiations were scheduled in the Boeing strike that
began Wednesday when a three-year labor contract expired without
agreement over a new pact.
   Strikers include 43,300 in the Seattle area, 12,000 in Wichita,
Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and smaller numbers at a half-dozen
other locations.
   Boeing spokesman Harold Carr said company officials met
Wednesday to discuss the strike ``but I'm not going to characterize
them as to what was discussed, nor would I want to go into any
detail as to what might happen next.'' He said he was not aware of
any further meetings Thursday.
   Union officials have said they'd be willing to resume talks at
any time, but haven't heard from Boeing.
   ``The company is mute,'' said spokesman Jack Daniels. ``They're
doing their aristocratic aloof act.''
   Carr said Boeing's operations were continuing without the
Machinists _ who represent the bulk of the company's production
workers _ ``but one obviously needs to recognize that we're
operating without 43,000 people who are normally here.''
   Supervisory personnel were trying to finish aircraft close to
delivery, including a Malaysian Airlines 747-400 jumbo jet due to
be delivered Friday.
   The Machinists want a larger share of Boeing's financial
prosperity and fewer hours of mandatory overtime at the company,
which is pressing hard to increase aircraft production because of
record aircraft orders.
   Boeing's offer included an immediate raise of 4 percent with 3
percent raises in both 1990 and 1991, annual bonuses of 8 percent
of a worker's gross earnings this year and 3 percent the next plus
reduced mandatory overtime.
   The last Machinist walkout at Boeing, in 1977, lasted 45 days.
   Elsewhere in the country, talks have been extended in a
Machinist contract that expired Sunday with Lockheed Corp. in
Marietta, Ga., and the union's contract with McDonnell Douglas,
Boeing's only U.S. competitor for jetliners, is up Oct. 22.
   Industry analysts said that what happens at Boeing could
influence those talks, although Jim Carroll, a spokesman for
Machinists at Marietta, said they could live with an offer similar
to Boeing's.
   ``Everyone else is going to see what Boeing is going to settle
for,'' said William Whitlow, an analyst with Dain Bosworth Inc. in
Seattle. ``That's not to say they will match it.''
   Members of other Boeing unions, which have no-strike clauses in
their contracts, have been reporting to work as usual. Worldwide,
Boeing employs 164,000 people, including 106,000 in Western
Washington.

   Carbon monoxide fumes seeped from a
cracked basement furnace at a high school Thursday, sending more
than 200 students and teachers to hospitals, authorities said.
   A handful of students briefly lost consciousness, but were
revived later when authorities evacuated at least 475 people from
Buckeye SouthWest High School in this east Ohio town, said
Assistant Fire Chief Gary McHugh. There were no reports of serious
injuries.
   ``If they'd been in there for at least two more hours, it could
have been worse,'' McHugh said. ``A few of them could have died.''
   The fumes began escaping about 6 a.m. when custodians activated
the school's gas heating system for the first time this fall, he
said.
   One of the building's four basement furnaces, located in the
rear of the building, apparently had a cracked wall and began
leaking carbon monoxide fumes, McHugh said. It was not known how
the wall had cracked, he said.
   The fumes seeped up through ventilating systems into all three
flooors of the high school, McHugh said.
   The fire department was called to the school about 10:30 a.m.
after students began complaining of nausea, headaches and shortness
of breath, he said.
   Seventy-eight people were taken to Ohio Valley Medical Center in
Wheeling, W.Va., where six were admitted in fair condition, said
hospital spokeswoman Catherine Blair. One person was in the
intensive care unit Thursday evening.
   Eighty-eight people were taken to East Ohio Regional Hospital in
Martins Ferry, where 22 were admitted, Ms. Blair said. Their
conditions were unknown.
   Later Thursday afternoon, the West Virginia hospital screened an
additional 93 people for possible carbon monoxide poisoning, she
said. Six of those were admitted, while five were undergoing
further evaluation, she said.
   ``Most of the people we're seeing have low to moderate levels of
carbon monoxide in their blood,'' said Dr. Bruce Walmsley,
coordinator of emergency services at the Ohio Valley Medical Center
and the East Ohio Regional Hospital.
   ``They're complaining of headaches, light-headedness and nausea,
chest pains, shortness of breath and a feeling that they're about
to pass out,'' he said.
   He said blood tests showed reading levels in the mid-teens.
Levels of 5 and lower are normal and levels of 50 are usually fatal.
   Dr. Walt Jones of the Martins Ferry hospital said students
brought there were being treated with oxygen and fluids.
   Walmsley said one student who had complained of severe headaches
and dizziness would be treated in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, a
sealed tank in which a patient is exposed to pure oxygen at three
times the normal atmospheric pressure.
   ``Everybody in the building was sick, but I couldn't smell
anything,'' The (Wheeling) Intelligencer quoted one unidentified
student as saying.
   Classes were dismissed at 10:10 a.m. Students were told they
were having a fire drill at the time, said teacher Larry Levi.

   Soldiers firing tear gas broke into
the building where opposition leader Guillermo Endara was holding a
hunger strike Thursday, but another opposition leader said Endara
left before the raid.
   Endara, in the 16th day of a hunger strike, was not caught,
Willie Cochez said. ``He is now in a safe place.''
   Cochez would not say how Endara was able to leave his office
before the soldiers arrived.
   A residents living nearby said two truckloads of soldiers
surrounded the block, stopped traffic and then entered the
building. The resident, who declined to be identified by name, said
soldiers had taken Endara out.
   Newsmen were kept about 200 yards away from the scene.
   ``Keep moving the other way,'' two policemen told AP newsmen at
the scene.
   Associated Press photographer John Hopper was hit on the head
and his equipment was confiscated. The wound required stitches.
   Endara, who was in the 16th day of the hunger strike to promote
a boycott of payments to the government, was on the main floor in a
wide corner room with plate glass inside walls.
   Several hours earlier, eight gunmen had fired in the air outside
the office where Endara was staying, dispersing scores of
supporters gathered outside. Still earlier in the day, uniformed
troops and civilians had surrounded the building.
   Some of the gunmen entered Endara's office and took his
secretary with them, but the secretary was later released.
   The former opposition presidential candidate told reporters
earlier Thursday he would continue his hunger strike as part of a
campaign to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Noriega survived a coup attempt Tuesday, and in a televised
speech Thursday he said he had evidence the United States planned
to install Endara as president after the coup.
   ``This hunger-striking buffoon sneaks out to eat (Tuesday) so he
can be well fed when he takes over the presidency. But he's
screwed,'' Noriega said.
   Noriega said he was going to present his hand-picked provisional
president, Francisco Rodriguez, with a package of ``war laws''
dealing with security because Panama is living ``in a moment of
emergency.''
   Noting that U.S. troops stood by and watched as the rebellion
failed, Noriega said the United States ``left its agents in the
lurch.'' He said the bungled coup was another Bay of Pigs for the
United States, referring to the CIA-supported invasion of Cuba that
failed in 1961.
   ``They mistakenly believed that everyone has a price and that
everyone is a traitor,'' he said the speech from the provincial
town of Santiago.
   The civilian opposition and the United States have denied any
role in the coup attempt.
   The United States recognizes Endara as the legitimate president
because of his victory in May 7 elections that were annulled by
Noriega.
   Endara was drinking only water, taking prescribed medicine and
eating only the wafer of Mass, but he appeared healthy when
reporters interviewed him at his office.
   Accusations of bungling the coup attempt were flying in
Washington, where congressional leaders accused the Bush
administration of botching the coup attempt.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said the coup leader, Maj. Moises
Giroldi Vega, had been executed.
   ``I have received reports from Panama that Noriega personally
shot the major,'' said Helms.
   Noriega didn't mention any executions in his speech, but the
Panamanian Defense Forces said nine of the 10 rebels who died in
the aborted coup were officers. The Wednesday night communique said
no loyalist troops died.
   ``Here we have a new Bay of Pigs,'' Noriega said. ``They (the
United States) left its agents in the lurch and nothing was
accomplished because dignity is superior to brute force.''
   Noriega said he had come under heavy fire in Defense Forces
headquarters during the coup attempt Tuesday and described talking
to the coup leaders. He did not give details of the situation
inside the barracks.
   Lt. Col. Arnulfo Castrejon said Thursday that Noriega had been
taken hostage. Other sources said Noriega had taken refuge in a
bunker and managed to call for help.
   Noriega described the rebel officers as ``confused'' and said
they were led by members of the general staff ``who were totally
suborned, confused but traitors.''
   ``I told them they would have to kill me before I handed over
the national liberation movement of the Panamanian people,'' he
said.
   Noriega maintains he is the victim of a U.S. plot to renege on
the 1977 treaties that turn the Panama Canal over to Panama at the
end of the century. Noriega said he had advance knowledge of a coup
plot.
   More than 35 officers and soldiers, including three members of
Noriega's general staff, were arrested, the Panamanian Defense
Forces said. They said five rebels have taken refuge at a U.S.
military base.
   Southern Command and the U.S. Embassy have refused to comment
about the five who reportedly sought asylum, or about anything
else, since Tuesday.

   A military communique announced
sweeping arrests that reach into Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's
general staff following a coup attempt that failed even after the
general was apparently taken prisoner.
   Wednesday night's ``war communique'' also said 10 rebels, all
but one of them officers, were killed in the fighting and 25 people
were wounded. The casualty list was the first issued by the
government after Tuesday's battle.
   A nighttime curfew silenced the streets of Panama City early
today.
   The communique said security forces arrested three members of
the High Command and about 35 other officers and soldiers. The
arrests of men supposedly among Noriega's most trusted aides
suggested the revolt may have had wider support than originally
thought.

   Thousands of East German refugees
arrived in this border town from Prague today after a trip through
their homeland in trains that were tightly locked to bar
compatriots who tried to board en route.
   Some said they feared there were serious disturbances during the
night in the East German city of Dresden because their train had
stopped for some time before passing through the city.
   Thousands of East Germans chanting ``We want out!'' had flocked
to train stations and lined tracks in their homeland in hopes of
joining the refugees aboard what could be the last ``freedom
trains'' to the West.
   East Germany's state railroad had provided the trains _ for a
second time in less than a week _ to transport thousands of East
Germans who had crowded the Prague embassy and streets just outside
it.

   The risk of AIDS infection from transfusions is
minuscule, but blood banks should work harder to recruit and retain
women donors because they're less likely to have the AIDS virus, a
Red Cross report concludes today.
   The research shows that blood from repeat female donors is nine
times safer than from first-time male donors.
   Currently, 42 percent of donors are women. The report said this
proportion should be increased, in part by encouraging members of
women's organizations to give blood and by telephone recruiting
campaigns aimed at women.
   ``Every effort should be made to recruit and retain female
donors,'' wrote Dr. Paul D. Cumming and colleagues from the
American Red Cross in Washington.

   ``Night Stalker'' Richard Ramirez sneered at
a jury's verdict that he die in the gas chamber for his 13 satanic
murders, muttering: ``Big deal. Death always went with the
territory. See you in Disneyland.''
   The black-clad killer, unrepentant to the end, made his comment
in an underground garage Wednesday as he was taken back to jail
moments after a jury recommended the death penalty for his gruesome
crimes.
   His Disneyland comment apparently referred to the plea for mercy
that had marked his attorney's closing argument.
   `Mr. Ramirez will die in prison,'' defense attorney Ray Clark
had argued, insisting that a life sentence was sufficient
punishment.
   But the jury voted 19 times for death on each of the special
circumstances attached to his 13 murder convictions. Ramirez also
was convicted of 30 felonies including burglary and sex crimes.
Those felonies and the crime of multiple murders constituted
special circumstances warranting the death penalty.

Now, authorities say modern word-processing technology makes their

   The Interior Ministry, responsible for police and law
enforcement, ``intends to relinquish control over the purchasing,

the government daily Izvestia reported Wednesday night.
   ``With the help of computers, one can publish ... an entire

   There's a lot of strange stuff happening
out there _ tales of poltergeists, swamp monsters, maybe even

Chorvinsky has opened a ``strange hotline'' to hear all about it.
   ``The world is a pretty strange place,'' says Chorvinsky, 35, a
black-clad archivist of the bizarre and investigator of the weird

   ``Everybody knows of something strange that has happened to
them, but they never talk about it,'' he says. ``The only time it's
safe to talk, it seems, is around a campfire or during Halloween.''
   Now they can dial the ``strange hotline'' at 1-900-820-8361 to
share a scary encounter with the unknown, or hear a tape of
Chorvinsky describing some of his favorites. Among them are the
Lizard Man of South Carolina, the horrific winged Jersey Devil, the
Manila vampire and a haunted stretch of rural Maryland highway
where ``the dreaded Snarly Yow'' has been spotted by motorists.

<HEAD>A New Slant on Capital Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Savers and investors at all stages of life are
likely to find both opportunities and new uncertainties lurking in
the capital-gains tax changes that Congress is debating.
   No one yet knows for sure the specifics of the final proposal
that might be sent to President Bush, who has been a vocal advocate
of a tax break for capital gains as a stimulus to investment.
   But the odds appear increasingly to favor a restoration, in some
form, of the special treatment for long-term gains that was
eliminated with the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
   A version passed by the House late last month would temporarily
allow people who realize profits on investments held for more than
a year to exclude 30 percent of the gain from federal income tax.
   The break would apply to assets _ for example, stocks, mutual
fund shares, or a house, but not ``collectibles'' like antiques or
old baseball cards _ sold any time after Sept. 13 of this year
through the end of 1991.
   With the arrival of 1992, long-term gains would no longer
qualify for a special rate, although a new formula would go into
effect then to adjust the tax obligation for future inflation.
   The Senate now is taking its turn on the proposal, and if all
goes according to the standard routine a House-Senate conference
committee would work out any differences before sending a bill to
the president.
   Until a new measure gets down to specifics, experts on matters
of personal finance say, there isn't much concrete action
individuals can take to capitalize on this latest shift in the
political winds.
   For example, to go ahead acting on the assumption that the final
legislation will keep the House's Sept. 14 starting date would be
``a little dicey,'' observes Hugh Johnson, an investment analyst at
First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y.
   Still, advisers say, it's by no means too soon to start planning
how you might want to capitalize on a period of lowered
capital-gains tax rates.
   Under the House plan, the effective maximum tax rate on
long-term capital gains would fall from 28 percent to 19.6 percent.
   For someone who sold a long-held asset such as a house for a
gain of $200,000, Uncle Sam's cut of the profit would thus be
reduced from $52,000 to $39,200, in the absence of any other
special breaks for home sales.
   So anyone looking to trade down to a smaller house might benefit
materially from timing the sale of the old property to fit into the
``window'' period of lower capital gains rates.
   A similar strategy might appeal to people looking for an
opportune moment to cash in appreciated assets to pay for some
discretionary item, whether it be a boat or elective surgery.
   Most observers agree it would be a mistake to expect a
capital-gains tax cut, especially one scheduled for only a limited
run, to serve as a powerful positive force for the prices of
financial assets.
   In fact, many analysts say the change approved by the House
would probably exert some downward pressure on assets like stocks,
especially in the last few months of the ``window'' period in 1991.
   However, many of the profits cashed in at that time would most
likely be reinvested quickly. The effect either way would be
mitigated by the dominance in modern markets of pension funds and
other institutions that are not subject to income tax.
   Concludes Johnson at First Albany, ``I don't think most
long-term investment strategies are going to be significantly
changed.''

<DATELINE>RAMAT HASHARON, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Israeli government is issuing
gas masks to civilians in an experiment that grew out of concern
that chemical weapons could be used by the enemy in a future war.
   The government maintains that a precedent for the use of
chemical weapons in the Middle East was set by Iraq in its war
against Iran in the Persian Gulf.
   The distribution of gas masks is part of a year-long
civil-defense experiment involving about 7,000 Israelis in Ramat
Hasharon near Tel Aviv and in the settlement of Shelomi on the
border with Lebanon.
   Israeli analysts say that in the Middle East it may be difficult
to eliminate chemical weapons as proposed by President Bush and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   One reason is that Arab states view such weapons as their only
counter to what they believe is an extensive Israeli nuclear
capability.
   Israel is considering a proposal to equip the entire nation of
4.5 million with gas masks and other protective equipment. But
first the army is conducting a test to make sure Israeli civilians
will take the chemical threat seriously.
   Qvadia Yemini, who lives in Ramat Hasharon, has four gas masks
in a closet _ one each for himself, his wife and two sons.
   ``We guard them in case, God forbid, there would be a war and we
would have to put them to use,'' said the 50-year-old assistant
city treasurer in this affluent suburb of about 40,000.
   ``It is very important that we were given the masks. Of course,
it brings some anxiety.''
   The army is collecting data on people's attitudes toward the
chemical threat and compliance with instructions on the care and
use of protective equipment, army spokesmen said.
   ``We know that if there is another war, there will be the threat
of chemical weapons,'' said Gad Penini, deputy mayor of Ramat
Hasharon and a reserve air force captain.
   Mayor Yehuda Lankri of Shelomi said that in his town of about
3,000 ``everybody took it very seriously.''
   The military conducted a smiliar, more limited test two years
ago in another town on the border with Lebanon but some residents
used the masks for costumes at parties or as protection while
spraying agricultural chemicals.
   Penini said he is certain Ramat Hasharon is taking the test
seriously with some residents storing the masks under their beds.
   ``I know it, because we have checked. Even people who were not
in the sample group came and asked us for the masks.''
   In addition to gas masks in adult and children's sizes, the army
also has distributed plastic tents for infants' cribs. They are
equipped with air filters, antidote injectors and decontamination
powder.
   According to a study by the independent Jaffee Center for
Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University, Syria has large
stockpiles of mustard and nerve gas as well as Soviet-made SCUD
missiles that put Tel Aviv and Jerusalem well within striking range.
   ``It's no real secret that Syria has threatened to use chemical
weapons,'' said Joseph Alpher, deputy head of the Jaffee Center.
   Syria, one of Israel's fiercest enemies, has no nuclear weapons
but believes Israel does and regards chemical weapons as ``a poor
man's atomic bomb,'' Alpher said.
   The Israeli government never has confirmed it but it is widely
believed abroad that Israel possesses both nuclear and chemical
weapons, as well as long-range missiles.
   Iraq, which has fought in all of the wars against Israel, used
chemical weapons not only in its war with Iran but also against
Kurdish rebels in Iraq.
   ``With Iraq, one would have to assume chemical weapons are a
standard part of their arsenal and doctrine,'' Alpher said.
   Experts also say Egypt, Libya and Iran are believed to have
chemical weapons.

<HEAD>Vietnam Vet Returns to Asia To Help Save Grasslands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Located southwest of Da Nang, it once was
fertile land. The Vietnam war made it a miserable, battered killing
field nicknamed the Arizona Territory. Dennis Sheehy, a Marine
grunt then, knew it well.
   He was badly wounded near there in 1967. Later, recuperating in
a Navy hospital, he made a decision _ as he notes in a PBS special
_ to return someday to Asia, and ``instead of search and destroy,
maybe build and reconstruct ...''
   He did just that, not in Vietnam, but in China, in Inner
Mongolia, where he worked on a government program to help save the
windswept grasslands. For three consecutive years, he lived there
during each year's six-month growing season, joined each June by
his wife, Marcie, and their three kids.
   His story, and theirs, will be told Monday on PBS, in ``The
Cowboy in Mongolia,'' a one-hour documentary made in 1987 by Andy
Duncan and Dave King, faculty members at Oregon State University in
Corvallis.
   Now 42, Sheehy, an Oregon native, is an assistant professor at
Texas A &amp; M University. He has undergraduate degrees in Asian
studies and Mandarin Chinese, and master's and doctoral degrees in
rangeland management.
   An odd combination. But it's just as odd that his interest in
the Orient was kindled by his first trip to Asia, one seen from a
grunt's perspective, in fields filled with booby traps, shell
craters and enemy bunkers.
   ``It's hard to explain,'' concedes Sheehy, a shy, soft-spoken
man. He thinks his interest probably began with tales of the Orient
he heard from his father, a Navy veteran _ ``he's an
anchor-clanker'' _ of World War II.
   ``Being there in Vietnam, even though it wasn't the best of
times, did kind of expand this desire of mine to learn more about
Asia,'' he says.
   But it took a while, starting with his first classes in 1968.
The ultimate goal was to see China. At one point, though, he'd
almost given up hope of getting there.
   Then, in 1985, Chinese officials to whom he'd sent a resume
hired him to work at a grasslands protection project on a
15,000-acre pilot area in Inner Mongolia. He and his family lived
in a commune called Yihenoer Sumu.
   Working on projects sponsored by China's government and various
organizations, including the United Nations and the World Bank,
Sheehy so far has made six trips to China. He plans to return there
in December.
   He was in Beijing in early June when pro-democracy
demonstrations led by students were crushed in the bloody,
internationally-televised show of force by government troops around
Tiananmen Square.
   ``All day Sunday I heard ambulance sirens, shooting, and a pall
of black smoking was hanging over the city,'' recalls Sheehy, who
stayed put at his hotel, located a short walk from the square.
   The sounds of violence gave him an eerie
I've-been-through-this-before feeling.
   ``Yeah, it did,'' he says. ``It's funny in a way, because I got
wounded in Vietnam on June 2, and this happened on June 3.'' He
chuckled. ``I remember commenting to the people with me that I
wasn't going to go abroad anymore during early June.''
   Like many who served in Vietnam, Sheehy would like to go back
there someday, walk peacefully where he once fought, visit what
once was the dusty, occasionally rocketed Marine base at An Hoa
southwest of Da Nang.
   ``Even though I hated Vietnam when I was there, hated being
scared to death all the time, there's a certain fascination about
the place,'' he says. ``Yeah, I'd go back there.''
   His links with the Marines he knew best in the violent past and
the Mongolian friends he's made in the peaceful present are quietly
noted near the end of Monday's PBS show with one sentence that
appears on screen.
   ``This film,'' it says, ``is dedicated to the men of Foxtrot
Company, 2nd Battalion, Fifth Marines (1967) and the herding
families of Yihenoer Sumu.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   NOT NECESSARILY NEWS _ Ah, the smell of the greasepaint, the
roar of the news. The tradition of TV journalists playing
themselves in entertainment shows continues. Next Tuesday, Geraldo
Rivera, the talk show star who once toiled for ABC News, will
return to ABC, but in ``thirtysomething.'' On Oct. 16, Connie Chung
of CBS News will materialize on CBS' ``Murphy Brown.'' Last season,
an episode of that series featured Linda Ellerbee, formerly of NBC
News and ABC News.
   It is not known when or if Dan Rather will try a sitcom, but
there is an anchor precedent. Walter Cronkite, when anchoring the
``CBS Evening News'' in the 1970s, did a guest turn on ``The Mary
Tyler Moore Show.''

<HEAD>Interplanetary Spacecraft To `Visit' Earth</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>

   In 1990 and again in 1992, the most
sophisticated space probe ever built will visit a planet with vast
oceans, a churning, molten interior and a rocky surface scarred by
earthquakes and active volcanoes.
   That planet is Earth.
   The Galileo spacecraft, scheduled for launch aboard the space
shuttle Atlantis on Thursday, is ultimately bound for Jupiter. But
its long, looping trajectory will sling it twice around its home
planet before dispatching it to Jupiter.
   That makes Galileo the first spacecraft to approach Earth from
interplanetary space.
   ``It's showing people what the Earth would look like to an
extraterrestrial,'' said Torrence Johnson, project scientist on the
Galileo mission. ``We've never conducted a mission to planet Earth
like this before. We're going to go in and see what this place
looks like.''
   In addition to making observations concerning the greenhouse
effect and the Antarctic ozone hole, Galileo will film what
scientists are calling the Earth movie, proposed by astronomer and
writer Carl Sagan of Cornell University.
   In the movie, the Earth will appear as a thin, distant crescent,
then gradually fill the frame and expand until surface objects 10
feet across are visible.
   As the spacecraft pulls away from Earth's sunlit side, it will
take a backward-looking shot showing five days of the Earth's
rotation, with the moon silently sweeping past as the Earth recedes.
   ``A continuous zoom movie like that would be, it seems to me,
spectacular in reminding us of our position in space, of the tiny
planet that we're on,'' Sagan said.
   Galileo will also, at Sagan's suggestion, use its
state-of-the-art instruments to map the atmosphere for methane,
carbon dioxide and other gases responsible for global warming. And
on its first pass, it will peer directly down into the ozone hole
over Antarctica.
   ``Galileo has such capable and novel instruments, it seemed to
me important to do something about understanding the dangers to the
global environment,'' Sagan said.
   Galileo is returning to Earth only to pick up a boost in speed
from Earth's gravity as it begins its six-year journey. After its
launch, Galileo will get a gravity kick by passing around Venus,
pick up more speed with the two passes by Earth and then begin its
primary mission to orbit Jupiter, explore its moons and dispatch a
probe into Jupiter's atmosphere.
   ``We wouldn't do anything on the Earth encounters if we thought
it would jeopardize the primary mission,'' said Fraser P. Fanale of
the University of Hawaii, who is in charge of Galileo's Earth
science objectives.
   Scientists say the $1.4 billion probe's investigation of Jupiter
and its moons will be the most scientifically rich that
interplanetary exploration has witnessed. The 1979 Voyager views of
Jupiter and its satellites were fascinating, but Galileo's images
will be 1,000 times clearer, they say.
   In 1995, a smaller probe is to be fired by Galileo into
Jupiter's cloud layers and make the first direct sampling of the
Jovian atmosphere. The probe will transmit data until it is crushed
and vaporized by extreme heat and pressure.
   Galileo will orbit the planet gathering information on
temperatures, magnetic fields, radiation, cloud characteristics,
gravity fields and the dynamics of a weather system that produces
such phenomena as the mysterious Great Red Spot, a centuries-old
storm larger than Earth.
   The spacecraft was initially scheduled for launch in 1982 on a
direct course to Jupiter, but it has been delayed repeatedly as
Congress and the White House wrangled over NASA financing and as
the space shuttle program fell far behind schedule.
   On Sept. 28, activists filed a suit seeking to prevent the
launch of the spacecraft because it is powered by plutonium. They
said a shuttle accident could spread toxic plutonium in populated
areas, but NASA said its evaluations indicated the risk of
contamination was very low.
   Galileo will do more than observe the Earth as it makes its way
to Jupiter. It will be the first spacecraft with modern instruments
to observe the dark side of the moon. ``There are a lot of things
we don't know about the far side of the moon,'' said Johnson.
``It's been very difficult and frustrating to try to put together a
picture of the whole moon from the data we have.''
   Galileo will also search for ice in the shaded craters near the
moon's north pole and study the soil for clues to the evolution of
the moon's crust and its interior.
   The spacecraft will be active as it passes by Venus, searching
for cloud patterns and possibly lightning. And it will visit at
least one and maybe two asteroids in the asteroid belt between Mars
and Jupiter.
   Its observations of the Earth and moon may help resolve a debate
about the ``space snowballs'' hypothesis of Louis A. Frank of the
University of Iowa.
   The theory holds that the Earth's lakes and oceans come from
precipitation caused by the melting of small comets bombarding the
Earth's atmosphere at the rate of 10 million a year.
   If that's true, Galileo should be able to spot hydrogen clouds
around the Earth and the moon, the result of the comets' water
molecules disintegrating. It should also detect water vapor rising
from the moon as comets collide with its surface.
   Galileo will make the most accurate measurements yet of the
Earth's mass, and it will study the sparkling ultraviolet
``airglow'' caused by the interaction of solar radiation with the
atmosphere.
   It may also show whether the Earth is shadowed by a ring of
interplanetary dust around the sun, as some scientists have
proposed.
   All of these observations have another purpose, too. ``We may
learn things about using the spacecraft that would be valuable at
Jupiter,'' said Johnson.
   Finally, the Earth observations have what Johnson calls ``the
surprise component.'' The two Voyager flights to the outer planets
consistently revealed features of the planets that hadn't even been
imagined. Could a fresh look at Earth do the same?
   ``I would not want to bet against finding some things people
hadn't thought about,'' Johnson said. ``Who knows?''

   When the Galileo space probe lifts off
from Cape Canaveral on Oct. 12, the longest part of its journey
will be over.
   The trip to Jupiter will take 6 years. Getting Galileo to the
launch pad took 12.
   Here is a chronology of Galileo's troubled history:
   1977 _ Carter administration backs Galileo; Congress threatens
to kill it but gives approval after intense lobbying by scientists.
A launch on the yet-to-be flown space shuttle is scheduled for a
critical planetary alignment in January 1982, to arrive at Jupiter
in 1985.
   1979 _ Developmental delays in the space shuttle make 1982
launch impossible. Launch is rescheduled for April 1984.
   1981 _ Cost overruns and delays force cancellation of Inertial
Upper Stage booster rocket that was to have propelled Galileo out
of Earth orbit toward Jupiter. Galileo's launch is delayed another
year for development of new Centaur booster.
   1982 _ Congress restores money for Centaur after it was canceled
by President Reagan's budget director, David Stockman. Launch is
delayed until May 1986.
   1986 _ Space shuttle Challenger explodes seconds after liftoff.
Centaur's liquid fuel system is considered too dangerous a cargo in
the event of another shuttle explosion; Centaur is canceled.
Galileo launch delayed until October 1989.
   1989 _ Galileo sent for the second time to Cape Canaveral.
Launch scheduled for Oct. 12, 1989, with arrival at Jupiter in
1995, 10 years after original planned arrival.

   Antarctica, the last place on Earth where nature
reigns over man, is facing a showdown between those who want to tap
its fabled wealth and those who want it to remain forever untouched
under ice.
   The majestic continent at the bottom of the world, larger than
United States and Mexico combined, is still peopled by scant
thousands who have to import everything but ice cubes.
   Although 16 nations fly flags in Antarctica, and seven claim
slices of it, no one holds title. No one needs a passport. It is a
vast global common, ruled only by the harsh, unforgiving elements.
   But statesmen, scientists and environmentalists must decide soon
whether Antarctica will open up to oilmen and airmen, miners,
commercial fishermen, hotelkeepers and, possibly, colonists.
   In Paris, bginning Monday, 39 nations will review the 1959
Antarctic Treaty that expires in 1991. They also will examine the
remains of the Antarctic Minerals Convention, signed in May 1988.
   The convention would have allowed controlled mining and oil
exploration, replacing a voluntary moratorium. But Australia, one
of seven claimant nations with a veto, decided not to ratify it.
   The United States, the Soviet Union and Japan, among others, are
pressing for a minerals accord. France, echoing Australia's
concerns, wants Antarctica to be an unspoiled world park.
   Delegates were guarded over an eventual compromise. The 1988
convention took six years to negotiate.
   Proponents say a world short of resources has no choice.
Antarctica hoards unknown quantities of gold, platinum and other
strategic metals, along with oil in amounts estimated to be in the
billions of barrels.
   Detractors insist that even controlled exploitation inevitably
pollutes a reserve crucial to man's survival. Upsetting its
delicate balance, they say, will have consequences no one can
predict.
   Undeniably, the world is already muscling in. Penguin livers are
tainted with pesticides and plastics. Century-old garbage litters
pristine panoramas. Antarctica has had its first oil spill.
   ``Trash thrown into the North Sea will eventually settle in
Antarctica,'' the French oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau once
told The Associated Press. ``The world is a closed system.''
   In a more recent interview, he railed against plans to exploit
the last untamed place on earth.
   ``That would be almost criminal, at least stupid,'' he said.
``It would be a catastrophe.''
   Scientists worry that tourists, whose numbers now approach
10,000 a year, endanger fragile ecosystems. Huge ice floes menace
ships' hulls, adding a threat of oil pollution.
   Yet it is the ancient lure of the mysterious continent, largely
unexplored for all of history's daring expeditions, that make it
such a disputed prize.
   Antarctica is 98 percent under ice, but it is no more a white
continent than Africa is a dark one.
   Old ice grows blue, then rich turquoise. As the sun shifts its
angle over floating ice and the glacier beyond, Antarctica is aglow
in pinks and oranges beyond the range of film or canvas.
   Penguin colonies, like rush-hour crowds dressed in black tie,
amuse scientists who try to take them seriously. Seals frolic and
birds move from place to place in turbulent clouds.
   For all the beauty, arguments focus on survival of the planet.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France, making the case for a
world wilderness area, told scientists from 40 countries at a June
meeting: ``It's not just the forests, the prairies or rivers that
are in danger. It's the entire Earth.''
   Specialists regard Antarctica as the world's weather factory.
   For 10 years, scientists there have measured the Earth's
thinning ozone layer, letting through radiation that risks
catastrophic changes in world climate and ocean levels.
   A New Zealand team recently reported the ozone hole over
Antarctica was much more serious than previously believed.
   Cousteau warns that jostling the precarious balance invites
calamity. For example, just scraping the surface of the Earth
spreads dust that alters reflectivity, raising temperatures and
melting ice.
   Human activity disturbs the breeding of unique species of birds
and marine mammals, scientists say. Fishing threatens a delicate
food chain that depends upon plentiful supplies of krill, a tiny
shrimp.
   In Antarctica, with treacherous sea lanes and lashing winds,
accidents are common. Once damage is done, experience shows, it is
very difficult to correct.

<HEAD>Anti-Nuclear Activists Vow To Disrupt Shuttle Launch Because of Plutonium</HEAD>

   NASA starts the countdown Monday,
but Thursday's launch of the space shuttle Atlantis depends on
whether a federal judge permits its five astronauts to dispatch the
nuclear-powered Galileo probe to Jupiter.
   Anti-nuclear activists have sued to halt the flight, arguing
that a launch accident could spread radioactive plutonium over
densely populated parts of Florida. The space agency maintains the
danger is almost non-existent.
   Both sides will argue their cases in U.S. District Court in
Washington, D.C., at 10 a.m. Tuesday. Judge Oliver Gasch then will
decide whether to grant a temporary restraining order to stop the
launch, or to let the countdown proceed. This is the first time
anyone has gone to court to stop a NASA launch.
   The plutonium argument overshadows the fact that the mission
involves the most expensive, most sophisticated unmanned space
probe ever built, a vehicle one mission official calls ``the
Rolls-Royce of spacecraft.''
   After a six-year outward journey, Galileo, priced at $1.4
billion, is to shoot a probe into Jupiter's atmosphere and then
orbit the planet for two years.
   Mission planners say its investigation of Jupiter and its moons
will be the most scientifically rich that interplanetary
exploration has witnessed. The 1979 Voyager views of Jupiter and
its satellites were fascinating, but Galileo's images will be 1,000
times clearer, they say.
   The countdown is to start at 8 a.m. Monday. If Gasch does not
rule quickly, the count will pause at the 11-hour mark, for several
days if necessary, awaiting a decision. Several critical steps,
including fueling the shuttle, occur after that point.
   If Gasch gives the green light, and no other problems arise,
Atlantis is scheduled to blast off at 1:29 p.m. Thursday.
   The activists vow that if they lose in court, they will
physically try to stop the liftoff.
   ``We are going to attempt to enter the launch area and sit on
the launch pad,'' said Bruce Gagnon, coordinator for the Florida
Coalition of Peace and Justice, one of three groups that filed the
suit.
   Extra security measures have been in force several days,
including closing to the public several roads approaching Kennedy
Space Center. These roads are normally closed only on launch days.
   NASA officials are concerned that Thursday's brief, 10-minute
launch window would vanish if protesters penetrate the launch zone
with a boat or plane in the count's final minutes.
   At issue are Galileo's two generators and their fuel: 48 pounds
of radioactive plutonium-238 dioxide.
   The activists say that if the space shuttle crashed or exploded,
as the Challenger did in 1986, the poisonous plutonium would be
released into the air.
   NASA has said the ``highest probability of launch-area release
of plutonium due to a shuttle accident is less than 1 in 2,500 and
such a release would have no appreciable adverse effects on the
population.''
   The agency quotes health physicists who say this type of
plutonium is relatively harmless unless a particle is inhaled or
lodges in an open wound, where it could cause cancer. Generally the
particles do not travel far in air and can be stopped by a piece of
paper or unbroken human skin.
   In tests, empty graphite plutonium containers have been blown
up, shot at and burned to determine how they survive all types of
accidents. They have withstood pressures far greater than those
generated by the Challenger explosion, say NASA and the Energy
Department, which took part in the testing.
   The space agency notes that similar generators have flown on 22
space vehicles, including five manned Apollo moon missions, and
that in three instances the well-protected devices survived severe
accidents: two unmanned rockets that blew up in the 1960s and the
explosion aboard Apollo 13 in 1970, which forced abandonment of a
moon landing.
   Plutonium 238's normal decay gives off intense heat, which
Galileo will convert to electricity. No other power source is
practical for space missions too far from the sun to use solar
energy.
   The five astronauts who will fly the mission say they are not
concerned about flying with plutonium.
   ``I have no absolutely no qualms about the devices,'' said
commander Donald Williams.
   Pilot Mike McCulley was more blunt: ``I don't see how it can
hurt anyone unless it hits him on the head, and that's pretty
remote. I think it is a complete non-issue except as a
philosophical issue to some people.''
   ``My family is going to be down there watching the launch, as
well as other people that I love, and so I'm not concerned about
it; I feel it's safe,'' said mission specialist Ellen Baker.
   The other crew members, mission specialists Shannon Lucid and
Franklin Chang-Diaz, expressed similar feelings.
   Six hours after liftoff, the astronauts are to release Galileo
from the cargo bay. An hour later, an attached motor will start the
6,700-pound craft on a six-year trip that will cover 2.4 billion
miles on the path to Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar
system.
   Along the way, Galileo will obtain fly-by data about the moon,
Venus and at least one asteroid, Gaspra. It will make two return
swings to within 600 miles of Earth.
   In December 1995 a 737-pound probe released from the spacecraft
is to plunge into Jupiter's cloud layers at 115,000 mph and make
the first direct sampling of the Jovian atmosphere. Slowed quickly
by the thickening atmosphere, the probe will pop a parachute and
transmit data to the Galileo mother ship for about an hour as it
descends about 360 miles before it is crushed and vaporized by
extreme heat and pressure.
   Galileo will fire into orbit about the planet, and its 10
scientific instruments will gather information on temperatures,
magnetic fields, radiation, cloud characteristics and gravity
fields.
   Of particular interest will be the dynamics of a weather system
that produce the ever-changing bands, whirls and plumes seen from
Earth and from the two Voyager spacecraft.
   The weather includes storms up to 25,000 miles across that have
raged for centuries. Among them is the mysterious Great Red Spot,
which the Voyagers determined is a tremendous atmospheric storm
similar to Earth's hurricanes.
   The Voyagers also found that Jupiter, 318 times more massive
than Earth, is a whirling ball of mostly liquid hydrogen, topped by
an atmosphere that is mostly hydrogen and helium. They discovered a
narrow ring of debris around the planet and found three new moons,
raising the toal to 16.
   The four largest moons bear the same relationship to their
planet as planets in our solar system do to the sun _ the nearest
being solid rock, like Mercury, and the farthest being a slush ball
with a rock in the center, like gaseous Neptune.
   Thus, Galileo will examine data and transmit pictures of a
miniature solar system as it orbits Jupiter, said Edward C. Stone,
professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology, who
is one of the mission scientists.
   ``Galileo will give us more than just snapshots in passing, as
the Voyagers did,'' Stone said. ``Being there and observing over a
period of nearly two years will allow us to sort out the dynamics
of Jupiter and its moons.''

<HEAD>Bush, Congress Will Have To Make Peace To Deal With Budget Deficit</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once a final deal is cut on taxes, the
Republican administration and the Democrats who run Congress will
have to find a way to make peace if they're going to deal with the
budget crisis.
   That will be at least as difficult as the House-Senate
negotiations this week on the misnamed reconciliation bill that is
supposed to bring the current budget into line with congressional
goals. The tax measure is part of the budget reconciliation bill, a
catchall of contentious issues on which final terms are to be
worked out this week, in conferences working under the pressure of
an Oct. 15 deadline.
   Mutual promises of bipartisan harmony have frayed in the
struggle over Bush's campaign-promised drive for a cut in capital
gains taxes. A two-year cut from the current maximum of 33 percent
to 19.6 percent is on the conference table by House vote, a roll
call on which 64 Democrats deserted their new floor leaders.
   It got there after a dispute that bruised both sides. Richard G.
Darman, the budget director, accused the Democrats of kamikaze
politics aimed at forcing a tax increase on Bush. Rep. Richard A.
Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, said Bush apparently
agreed with Leona Helmsley that only little people should pay
taxes. After the House victory, Bush said he was displeased with
Gephardt for making the issue ``really kind of personal.''
   The Democratic leadership first had considered tackling the Bush
capital gains measure head-on, in an up-or-down test, but their own
vote counts showed them taking a lopsided beating. So they
countered with a retirement account tax break for the upper-middle
class, plus a tax increase on the wealthiest taxpayers, and lost
anyhow.
   The $2,000 tax deduction for individual retirement accounts was
revived in the Senate Finance Committee and the final package could
include versions of both that tax break and the capital gains
reduction. The Senate panel also tossed in an assortment of special
interest tax breaks, and that is likely to complicate the
congressional negotiations.
   The reconciliation bill is an annual exercise that is supposed
to reduce the budget deficit, which keeps going up anyhow, even as
deficit estimates and targets keep going down because of the law
that is supposed to compel real reductions even if that takes
automatic spending cuts. ``We have to stop this deficit ...,'' said
Sen. Herbert H. Kohl, D-Wis, ``we have to stop fooling ourselves
with Gramm-Rudman claims of progress which just hide deficits that
have never declined.''
   That problem is going to remain after the bill is passed,
whatever the settlement on taxes. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley
thinks it may get worse because of the tax fight.
   Foley said that if the capital gains cut becomes law, ``I am
worried that it will sap the ability of the two parties to work
together on meaningful deficit reduction.''
   There are pressures on both sides to do more campaigning and
less compromising. The Democrats' new leadership has been
criticized for lack of a game plan with a clear set of goals as
alternatives to the Bush program. Activist House Republicans,
frustrated at what seems permanent minority status, see
confrontation as a way to start winning more seats.
   But Foley also thinks it essential that there be a ``grand
compromise'' between the parties in order to deliver a real
solution to the deficit. Speaking in Minneapolis before the capital
gains vote, the speaker said the parties must be able to cooperate
so that each can ``provide the protection to the other party to
make the hard choices necessary for meaningful deficit reduction.''
   To do it, he said, Democrats would have to protect Republicans
willing to vote for cuts in costly entitlement programs in order to
control spending. The biggest of the entitlements is Social
Security. On the other side of the ledger, Foley said, Republicans
would have to be willing to give Democrats political cover if they
were to support higher taxes to reduce deficits.
   That would not only be a grand compromise, it would be a
political miracle.

<HEAD>Crop Insurance Snarl Challenges New Farm Bill Framers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If anyone has a sure-fire way to take the risk
out of farming without boosting costs to taxpayers, let Congress
and the Agriculture Department know right away.
   Every year, as sure as Mother Nature changes season, floods,
droughts, insects and diseases chew away at crops that farm
families and the rest of the country depend on.
   And each year, as sure as politicians like to get re-elected,
Congress comes up with plans to bail out farmers.
   Economist Joe Glauber is head of an Agriculture Department team
studying ways to change the current federal crop insurance program,
which provides catastrophic risk coverage for farmers.
   But Glauber, who works for the department's Economic Research
Service, says there is a perception among many farmers that ``if
there is a widespread natural disaster, Congress will legislate''
one-time assistance to help the affected producers.
   Experience since 1980 has proved the perception correct.
   A General Accounting Office study released last month showed
that the government spent $17.6 billion from 1980 to 1988 on aid to
farmers who lost crops because of drought or other natural causes.
   The GAO report, which was requested by a House agriculture
subcommittee, said only about 25 percent of farmers buy federal
crop insurance because they expect Congress to come to their rescue
whenever there is a major crisis.
   As a result of last year's drought, for example, about $4
billion in direct payments went to farmers under the Disaster
Assistance Act of 1988. An additional $900 million will go to
farmers under a 1989 version.
   The GAO said that in the 1980-88 period, USDA spent $6.9 billion
on direct assistance to farmers suffering crop losses, $6.4 billion
on emergency loan programs and $4.3 billion on subsidies for crop
insurance.
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., chairman of the subcommittee, said
65 percent to 70 percent participation would be necessary to make
the USDA crop insurance program successful.
   Government crop insurance (there is a Federal Crop Insurance
Corp. in USDA to handle it) goes back decades. Congress overhauled
the program in 1980 and for a while there was a widely accepted
belief that crop insurance should replace disaster assistance.
   But record losses to the program and low participation by
farmers have shown otherwise. So, as Congress gets deeply involved
in writing an omnibus 1990 farm bill, crop insurance is one of the
major challenges.
   One of the major changes in 1980 was an extensive expansion of
federal coverage. Before the 1980 act, the program operated only in
selected counties and for selected crops. Farmers paid the full
cost of premiums, and increases in enrollment were slow because of
restrictions on selling the insurance in high-risk areas.
   But the 1980 law permitted the USDA agency to insure any farm
commodity grown in the United States if yield histories for the
area were available. The program was handled as much as possible by
private companies.
   To encourage greater participation, the law allowed a 30 percent
subsidy of premiums for policies that guarantee farmers 50 percent
or 65 percent of their normal yields, and a somewhat smaller
subsidy if 75 percent guarantees are selected.
   In the USDA study, economist Glauber's team looked at four
alternatives to the current system, including compulsory crop
insurance for farmers enrolled in federal commodity programs that
provide price supports and other benefits. Another plan would make
compulsory crop insurance free to farmers.
   The third alternative would replace crop insurance with a
permanent disaster payment program, and the fourth would provide a
``catastrophic risk management'' program tied to commodity programs
and based on target revenues.
   A report in this month's Farmline magazine looks at the Glauber
study, including pros and cons of each.
   High participation by farmers in the commodity support programs
would ``ensure high participation in crop insurance'' under the
compulsory package, Glauber found. It also would negate the need
for disaster assistance for crop producers.
   ``There is, however, a chance that compulsory crop insurance
might have little effect toward meeting the government's goal of
eliminating ad hoc congressionally legislated disaster
assistance,'' the report added.
   Even so, the study found that total costs to the government
under the compulsory option would likely be less than the combined
cost of the current program and ad hoc assistance provided by
Congress.
   Free crop insurance could boost farmer participation in annual
commodity programs, meaning government costs would increase for
price support operations
   A permanent disaster assistance program to replace crop
insurance would be the most expensive of all, possibly exceeding
the $4 billion paid to farmers in 1988, Glauber found.
   Looking at the target revenue option, the chief attraction would
be income stability for farmers, he said. The program would replace
both the crop insurance and the direct subsidy, or deficiency
payment, used in the annual commodity programs.
   Depending on the specifics, federal costs of a target revenue
program could soar by more than 30 percent from current levels,
Glauber said.

   Mediator Douglas Hammond said Wednesday that opposing parties

   Hammond said he hoped to resume talks quickly because of the
large number of affected workers and the potential impact of a long

   Business executives' expectations for higher
sales and profits in the coming months have dropped to the lowest
levels in four years, according to a national survey.
   ``After two years of consistently strong expectations, business
executives are getting skittish,'' Joseph W. Duncan, corporate
economist and chief statistician for Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., said
Wednesday in a statement announcing the results.
   The nationwide quarterly survey of 1,500 executives in
manufacturing, retailing and wholesaling concerned their outlook
for the last three months of 1989.
   A welcome sign was that while optimism about sales and profits
faded, expectations for higher prices and inventories also dropped.
   ``Thus, two of the major factors that have fueled recent
recessions _ inflation and excess inventories _ appear to be well
under control,'' Duncan said.
   Retailers' expectations for gains in sales and profits in the
fourth quarter dropped sharply to the lowest levels since the
fourth quarter of 1983.
   ``Retailers were surprisingly optimistic in the fourth quarter
last year, and this year's expectations are more in line with
recent retail-sales statistics,'' Duncan said.
   For the executives as a whole, the sales optimism index of the
outlook for the fourth quarter fell to 60, down seven points from
this year's third quarter and 10 points from the fourth quarter of
1988. It was the lowest since a reading of 55 in the second quarter
of 1983.
   The profits optimism index fell to 54, down seven points from
this year's third quarter and down 13 points from the fourth
quarter of 1988. The index has not been lower since the second
quarter of 1983. It was at the same level at the end of 1985.
   Among the other measures, expectations for price and inventory
increases were at the lowest since 1987 and expectations for
employment increases were at the lowest since the end of 1986.
   The indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of
respondents expecting decreases from the percentage expecting
increases.

<HEAD>IBM Chief: Lower-Than-Expected Earnings Signal No Management Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA HULPE, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machine Corp.
Chairman John Akers says IBM's lower-than-expected 1989 earnings do
not point to a management problem within the computer giant.
   ``It's not totally unusual that technology companies such as IBM
have those types of problems,'' Akers said Wednesday of the recent
announcement to delay introduction of IBM's high-powered disk drive
for data storage.
   Last week, IBM said its earnings for the third quarter and 1989
would fall below market analysts' expectations. The announcement
sent IBM stock tumbling.
   Akers told reporters this reflected no management problem. In
addition to the disk-drive delay, he mentioned the rise of the
dollar, which reduced the dollar value of foreign profits, and
increased use of leasing, which spreads out the revenue received
from equipment placements.
   Akers said he expected IBM's growth in Europe to outpace that of
its competitors. ``(IBM's) business in Europe is growing in
European currencies at 15 percent or better,'' he said.
   Yet he said IBM has no plans to expand its 109,000-strong
European workforce. He said the highest growth market was Asia,
where IBM continues to expand its workforce.
   Worldwide, the company employs about 387,112 people.
   In the last five years IBM has cut its workforce, without
layoffs, by about 25,000 in the United States, where the market has
been growing at half the pace of Europe, Akers said.
   He said IBM ``will continue to carefully observe our
manufacturing operations and overhead structure within the U.S.,
but I don't see any significant downsizing or restructuring for IBM
there.''
   Akers said he backed the European Community goal of remaining
competitive in semiconductor technology and production, an issue
that has frequently spawned tensions between the EC, Japan and the
United States.
   IBM is negotiating to participate in European programs to
develop semiconductor technology, including the $4 billion,
eight-year Joint European Submicron Silicon (JESSI) research
program.
   ``Being one of the largest semiconductor manufacturers in
Europe, we think we could provide a valuable contribution to JESSI,
and that is why we are here negotiating to become part of that
initiative,'' Akers said.
   JESSI aims to design new generations of computer memory and the
processes and equipment to make them.

<TEXT>
   A new generation of digital audio tape recorders,
including one small enough to slip into a purse and others capable
of near-flawless direct digital recordings from compact discs,
debuted at the Japan Audio Fair.
   The models are the first to be introduced since record and
electronic industry groups agreed in July on a new worldwide DAT
standard that opens the way for widespread marketing of the
high-quality recording equipment.
   Aiwa said Wednesday its new HD-X1 DAT recorder is the smallest
on the market at 3.7 inches by 5.7 inches. With an extra adapter,
the 1.3-pound machine also can record video _ up to 3,600 still
images on a two-hour tape.
   The model will go on sale in Japan on Oct. 21 for $555, Aiwa
spokesman Kohji Morino said. The cheapest previous DAT machines in
Japan cost about $720.
   But like Japanese DAT recorders manufactured before the July
agreement, the HD-X1 can't make direct digital recordings from CDs,
and instead must convert their signals to analog form, resulting in
a slight degradation of sound quality.
   Aiwa expects to redesign the HD-X1 after official approval is
given to the new international DAT standard, and won't export it
until then, Morino said.
   Both DATs and compact discs use digital technology to reproduce
music with low noise and distortion and high dynamic range.
   But sales have been disappointing during DAT equipment's 2{
years on the market in Japan because of high prices and initial
opposition from record industry groups, which feared that DAT's
ability to make high-quality tape recordings would encourage
pirating.
   Under the July agreement, new DAT equipment will be able to make
near-perfect direct digital recordings from digital sources such as
CDs, but will add a ``flag'' signal to the tape to prevent any
second-generation copies from being made.
   JVC, Pioneer, Sony, Technics and other makers displayed new DAT
models meeting the new standard, but said marketing would be
delayed until government agencies in Japan and overseas give their
approval.
   ``Companies in the lead hope to market their new models by
January or February,'' said Naomichi Kohri of JVC. ``And I think
we're one of the companies out in front.''
   Kohri said JVC hopes to sell the cheapest of its three new DAT
models for less than $720, ``but we're not sure whether we'll be
able to manage it yet.''
   DATs ``haven't caught on because their cost is still rather
high,'' a Denon official said. ``But we're optimistic that the
market will start improving soon, after the new recorders come
out.''
   Like new models from other firms, Sony's new recorder shows that
DATs have become a technically mature product. Inside the Sony
model, there no longer is a maze of wires since much of the complex
circuitry has been incorporated into new integrated circuits.
   But with sales of DATs finally expected to rise, Sony officials
displayed what they said will become the ultimate sound recording
device _ a compact disc recorder.
   ``Technically, it's ready, but we're facing the same copyright
problems as DATs,'' said Gen Ichimura, a Sony technician. ``We'll
have to wait until they are solved.''
   The machine, called a rewritable compact disc magnetic optical
recorder, uses the same digital circuitry as CD players. But in
addition to playing regular CDs, it can record on disks made of a
special alloy by magnetizing minute spots on the surface that then

will cost about the same as current CD players, while the special
disks will be cheaper than regular CDs, Ichimura said.

<UNK>Coopers and Lybrand, Deloitte to Merge British Operations</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The accounting firms Coopers and Lybrand and
Deloitte Haskins and Sells say they will merge their British
practices, creating Britain's largest accounting firm.
   The decision Wednesday by British partners of Deloitte Haskins
and Sells represents a blow to efforts to create a worldwide
combination of Deloitte Haskins and Sells and Touche Ross
International, to be known as Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu.
   The Deloitte partners in Britain announced Tuesday they had
decided not to take part in that merger and to link with Coopers
and Lybrand instead, creating a firm with about 10,500 employees
and fee income of about $670 million a year.
   Similar deals might be made at other Coopers and Deloitte firms
around the world, partners of the two firms said at a London news
conference. They declined to be more specific.
   The merger would be beneficial to both companies because of
``strategic compatibility'' and ``similar chemistries,'' said John
Bullock, senior partner at Deloitte's London office.
   A name for the newly created firm hasn't been chosen, Bullock
said.
   The Touche Ross firm in Britain, which has 4,000 employees, will
be the only British arm of Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu.
   Officials of Deloitte and Touche in the United States who are
trying to put together the firms' global merger declined comment on
the defection of the British arm of Deloitte.
   Two other major accounting firms, Arthur Andersen and Price
Waterhouse, last month ended merger talks which would have created
the largest accounting firm in the United States and in the world.

<HEAD>Seger: A `Soft Landing' Is Here</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha R. Seger
says that the central bank has achieved a hoped-for ``soft
landing'' in the nation's economy and that inflation does not
appear to be a major threat.
   ``Inflation should continue to be reasonably well-contained
through 1990 _ barring any dramatic developments in food and energy
markets or sharp moves in the dollar,'' she said in remarks
prepared for delivery Wednesday in New York. ``There are many
reasons to be pleased with our economic performance over the past
year,'' she said in her prepared text.
   She spoke at the 29th annual Business Outlook Conference,
sponsored by the Conference Board, a private business research
group.
   ``The recent data suggest that we have succeeded in achieving
such a `soft landing,''' she said in her prepared remarks, pointing
to the 2 percent economic growth estimated for the first half of
1989 and the modest-growth predictions for the remainder.
   A ``soft landing'' is a term often used by economists in
describing a condition when economic growth slows just enough to
keep inflation in check but not enough to topple the country into a
recession.
   ``Despite some softness in the goods-producing industries, labor
demand overall has remained firm,'' Seger said. ``The unemployment
rates has held steady at about 5.25 percent since late 1988 ... the
lowest since the 1970s.
   ``The underlying rate of inflation, which seemed to be ticking
up earlier this year, has edged back down ... Consumer spending
seems to have recovered some momentum and housing activity appears
to have bottomed out.''
   Seger said the Fed's decision to tighten its credit policy, by
driving up interest rates, in late 1988 and early this year played
a key role in defusing inflation concerns. She said the Fed's
strategy will continued to be centered on stable prices.
   But Seger hinted that she and other Fed members were concerned
about what effect the dollar's rise and fall in foreign exchange
will have on future interest rates and the economy in general.
   A higher dollar could hurt the growth of exports, and appears to
have already had some effect, she said. ``The limited information
on foreign orders ... points to some slowing in the months ahead.''
   ``In setting policy, we must be realistic about the effects of
such developments,'' Seger said.
   The dollar had risen sharply against major foreign currencies
over the summer due to firmness in U.S. interest rates. It has
fallen off recently following a concerted effort by the Fed and
other major central banks to drive it down.

<HEAD>Pfizer Begins Marketing Its New Angina and Blood Pressure Capsules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pfizer Inc. says it has begun marketing
Procardia XL Extended Release Tablets, a drug available by
prescription for once-a-day treatment of angina and hypertension.
   Analysts say Wednesday the drug should be even more successful
than the original Procardia because it sharply reduces side effects
of the three-times-a-day capsules such as dizziness, flushing, an
accelerated heart rate and nausea.
   ``We anticipate that Procardia XL will become the most
significant cardiovascular drug in the United States market,'' said
Richard Stover, a New York-based analyst for Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc.
   Pfizer's announcement of the drug's availability comes nearly a
month after the Food and Drug Administration approved Procardia XL
for the treatment of both conditions.
   In the interim, Pfizer said that the new drug was shipped to
pharmacies and is now available should physicians decide to
prescribe it for their patients.
   Pfizer said about 2.5 million people in the U.S. suffer from
angina and 60 million from hypertension.
   Procardia XL is a formulation of Pfizer's calcium channel
blocker Procardia (nifedipine) which has been marketed in the
United States for the treatment of angina since 1982.
   But it offers some differences compared with Procardia capsules,
which Pfizer says are one of the most widely prescribed medications
in the country.
   In addition to its approved use in treatment of hypertension as
well as angina, Procardia XL makes use of a novel drug delivery
system that releases the medicine into the body at a steady rate
over a full 24-hour period.
   Dr. John Jefferis, a senior vice president-medical at Pfizer
Pharmaceuticals, said Procardia XL is also economical with an
equivalent daily dosage priced lower than that charged for other
capsules.
   Pfizer said, for instance, that the average daily cost to a
patient for Procardia capsules was estimated at $1.47 a day in
mid-September compared with $1.21 for the same number of milligrams
of Procardia XL.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mutual funds that invested in international or
growth companies had among the highest returns in the third
quarter, while fixed-income funds were the worst performers,
according to the latest tally of mutual fund performance.
   The survey by Lipper Analytical Services, distributed for
release today, said mutual funds of all types showed gains on
average during the three months ended Sept. 30.
   However, fixed-income funds did the poorest with overall returns
of 0.56 percentage point. Lipper said they were dragged down by
funds that invested in high-yield bonds, which declined an average
1.27 percent in the third quarter.
   ``These funds were the only class of fixed income funds to
decline in the quarter,'' noted A. Michael Lipper, president of the
research concern that bears his name. ``Bond funds also suffered as
interest rates rose.''
   Among the 25 best performers, seven were international funds and
six were growth. The 10 biggest international funds had returns of
14.7 percent collectively, while the top 10 growth funds had
returns of 10.39 percent, Lipper said.
   Merrill Pacific A and Merrill Pacific B, international funds,
led all funds with returns of 30.64 percent and 30.40 percent
respectively.
   First Investors Bond Appreciation and Alliance Bond: High Yield
finished last with losses of 7.99 percent and 7.89 percent
respectively.
   By comparison, the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue-chip
stocks had a rate of return of 11.54 percent and the S&amp;P 500 index
had a rate of return of 10.70 percent during the third quarter,
assuming dividend reinvestment, Lipper said.
   Lipper's tallies assume that all dividends and capital gains
distributions are reinvested.
   Lipper has been publishing its fund performance analysis for 16

<TEXT>
   Plans announced by billionaire Kirk Kerkorian
to build a 5,000-room resort here would allow Las Vegas to claim
the eight largest hotels in the world by 1992, according to
industry statistics.
   Of course, Las Vegas' domination of the list dpends on other
cities not building big hotels between now and 1992.
   The Las Vegas Hilton currently claims the title with 3,174 rooms
but will be surpassed next March when an expansion is completed at
the Flamingo Hilton, giving that Strip resort 3,530 rooms. The
Flamingo will hold the title only a few months, until the Excalibur
opens next summer with 4,032 rooms.
   Steve Wynn's Mirage Hotel opens next month with 3,054 rooms.
   Circus Circus, the parent corporation for Excalibur, currently
has 2,800 rooms in Las Vegas, as does Bally's Hotel on the Strip.
   The Riviera Hotel currently has 2,200 rooms but a planned
expansion will give the resort 3,800 rooms by June of 1992.
   Kerkorian built the International Hotel, now the Las Vegas
Hilton, and the MGM Grand, now Bally's. He also owned the Flamingo
at one time.
   The Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu currently has 2,525
rooms, making it the largest hotel, in number of rooms, outside of
Las Vegas, according to figures in the Hotel and Motel Index. The
number of rooms at the Hawaiian property is not expected to change
in the near future because the hotel recently completed an
expansion, according to Las Vegas Hilton spokesman Bruce Banke.
   Outside the United States, the New Otani Hotel in Tokyo leads in
number of rooms with 2,056.

   Home Box Office Inc. said it plans to launch its
Comedy Channel on Nov. 15 on cable systems with about 6 million
subscribers.
   The Comedy Channel is one of two comedy networks that are
expected to begin airing over the next few months competing for
viewers, advertisers and increasingly tight cable channel space.
   MTV Networks, a division of Viacom International Inc., has
announced that it plans to launch a comedy channel called ``Ha! The
TV Comedy Network'' in April.
   In Wednesday's announcement, HBO said it has received
commitments that will ultimately put the Comedy Channel in 10
million homes, including segments of the Chicago, Los Angeles and
New York metropolitan areas.
   But spokesman Alan Levy said that systems serving about 6
million of those homes will be carrying the Comedy Channel as it
debuts in six weeks.
   The 6 million estimate is about half as many subscribers as was
claimed at the launch of the Consumer News and Business Channel
earlier this year, the most recent new cable network startup. CNBC
is a joint venture of National Broadcasting Co., the New York-based
operator of the NBC television network, and Cablevision Systems
Corp. of Woodbury, N.Y.
   Among the cable operators who have signed up for the Comedy
Channel are Cablevision Industries Inc. of Liberty, N.Y., and
TeleCable Corp., Norfolk, Va.
   Barry Kluger, a spokesman for MTV Networks, said ``Ha!'' has
informal commitments for about 2 million cable subscribers. He said
the channel has signed 14 charter advertisers, however, including
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. and Alberto-Culver Co.
   The two channels intend to follow different programming formats.
   The Comedy Channel from HBO intends to feature on-air hosts for
shows that will include a variety of programming including
promotional excerpts from comedy films, classic TV shows and
standup performances.
   MTV Network's ``Ha!'' plans longer-form comedy programming
including situation comedies, movies and game shows.

   The New York Mercantile Exchange has named a
former commodities enforcement official as its new president.
   R. Patrick Thompson, who was the executive vice president of the
exchange, succeeds Rosemary T. McFadden, who resigned in July.
Thompson had served as chief of staff since McFadden's resignation.
   Nymex Chairman Z. Lou Guttman said Wednesday the Nymex board
selected Thompson for his ``extensive operational and regulatory
management skills and expertise.''
   Thompson, whose appointment is effective immediately, formerly
was an attorney with the New York regional office of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission's enforcement division.
   The CFTC is an independent federal agency charged with
regulating the nation's commodities markets in New York, Chicago
and other cities.
   Thompson also has served as an executive for the exchange's
compliance division and as general counsel.
   Nymex, the world's largest energy futures exchange, is one of
several commodities exchanges that has come under scrutiny in the
last year for alleged trading practices violations.
   More than 40 traders and brokers at the Chicago Board of Trade
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest
commodities exchanges, were indicted in August after a 2{-year
undercover investigation in which FBI agents posing as traders
t reducing trading violations.
   One rule would make suspension mandatory for anyone engaging in
``fraud or deceit in connection with the customer order'' and would
raise the fine for major offenses to $250,000 from $100,000.

   Richard C. Breeden, President Bush's nominee
to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, was unanimously
recommended Wednesday by the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban
Affairs Committee.
   Breeden, 39, whose nomination was approved by the panel
Wednesday, has served in a variety of capacities under Bush, most
recently as point man on the legislation that helped bail out the
nation's ailing savings and loan industry.
   Bush nominated Breeden, assistant for the president for issue
analysis, in August to succeed David S. Ruder who returned to
teaching law at Northwestern University Sept. 30.
   In the meantime the president has named SEC member Edward H.
Fleischman to be acting chairman pending Breeden's confirmation by
the full Senate, expected as early as the end of the week.
   The SEC is a five-member board that oversees securities markets,
regulates the sale of stocks, bonds and stock options and enforces
securities laws.
   A 1975 graduate of Harvard Law School, Breeden was deputy
counsel to then-Vice President Bush from 1982 to 1985 and directed
a task force on dergulation headed by Bush and wrote the panel's
report on deregulation of financial services.

<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. policy makers must guard against creating
a society of ``haves'' and ``have nots'' as they consider how to
nurture development of sophisticated voice, data and video services
in the 21st century, a House panel was told.
   The government also must make sure that average taxpayers don't
end up footing the bill for futuristic telcommunications services
they don't really need, said Janice Obuchowski, assistant secretary
of commerce for communications and information.
   ``We have to sort of guard against technological elitism,''
Obuchowski said Wednesday, citing the potential of a future in
which only a few major institutions and large corporations have
access to supercomputers and advanced communications networks.
   Historically, ``the government has had to assure there is no
haves-or-have-nots situation,'' she told the House Energy and
Commerce telecommunications and finance subcommittee.
   In communications, that has meant giving all citizens universal
access to telephones. The government now must decide, she said,
whether the concept of universal service should extend to services
in which fiber-optic transmission systems will be capable of
carrying mountains of voice, data and video signals directly to
homes and businesses.
   At the same time, the government, as it decides whether to be a
leader, coordinator or adviser in this telecommunications
revolution, must see that the consumer, as Obuchowski said has
happened in Japan, does not pay ``a premium for something they
don't need'' just to benefit overseas competitiveness.
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., saying that development of such
services is ``critical to the future of the United States,''
pressed Obuchowski on what the Bush administration planned to do to
make sure the United States does not get left behind by Japan and
Western Europe, which are spending billions in the rush to build
21st century ``telecommunications highways.''
   She said the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications
and Information Administration, which she heads, was preparing a
report that would lay out the administration's position on how it
should aid the U.S. telecommunications industry, either as
financial backer, ``coach or leader.''
   The administration last month proposed a five-year, $1.9 billion
program to promote advanced computing technology, including the
creation of a very high-speed National Research and Education
Network to link the nation's supercomputers.
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., and Rep. Doug Walgren, D-Pa., also
have proposed a similar program, which would commit $1.75 billion
over five years.
   But Markey and Rep. Don Ritter, R-Pa., said they feared an
advanced computing network would be useful only to the ``elite'' at
major universities and research centers and a few large businesses,
without providing ``on-ramps and off-ramps'' for the average
citizen or small college or business.

   Average prices for 1990 models of Volkswagen

   ``By doing away with rebates, we are running counter to the

   The price reductions come amid sagging sales for both of the
West German-made automobiles. Through Sept. 30 this year,
Volkswagen sales were running 23.2 percent behind last year's pace
and Audi sales were off 13.2 percent.
   For the month of September, Audi posted a 25.8 percent increase

<HEAD>Boeing Strike Another Bold Move for Machinists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Machinists union, after sparking a
paralyzing walkout at Eastern Airlines earlier this year, has made
another bold move by striking against Boeing Co.
   The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers, 57,000-strong at Boeing and a major force in the airline
industry, remains fiercely loyal to traditional trade unionism
during an era of union compromises, wage concessions and
employee-management buyouts.
   In addition to the Boeing walkout, Machinists union members
Wednesday entered the eighth month of their strike against Eastern
and were holding out against joining pilots and management at UAL
Corp. in a proposed $6.75 billion buyout of that company, the
parent of United Airlines.
   ``They are probably the most militant of the unions,'' said
Louis Marckesano, an airline analyst at the Philadelphia brokerage
Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. ``They are a tough union.''
   They can afford to be. Members of the 850,000-worker union have
skills that often give them an edge in the job market and make them
difficult to replace.
   At Seattle-based Boeing, the world's biggest commercial aircraft
manufacturer, the union represents the bulk of the company's
production workers. They perform tasks ranging from riveting,
wiring and plumbing in aircraft to quality inspections and
machine-tool maintenance.
   ``They have a much better labor market than everyone else,''
said Peter Cappelli, an associate professor of management at the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
   For the last decade or so, the Machinists have been the union
most strongly opposed to wage concessions and changes in the
traditional adversary relationship between labor and management,
Cappelli said.
   That's why they have refused so far to participate in the
planned buyout of UAL, which proposes worker wage concessions in
return for a majority ownership stake. But the Machinists are
expected to ask UAL soon to negotiate a new labor contract, and the
union could use the issue of its participation as a bargaining chip
in the talks.
   Industry analysts believe the pilot-management takeover could
succeed without the Machinists, who have had a rocky relationship
in recent years with the pilots at United.
   In contrast, at Eastern the pilots walked out in sympathy with
the Machinists, temporarily shutting down the Miami-based carrier
and driving it into bankruptcy court in early March. But that
strike has left thousands of Machinists, pilots and flight
attendants without jobs as Eastern hired and trained replacement
workers.
   Eastern and Boeing are worlds apart. The aerospace giant is
prosperous, with an order backlog of nearly 1,600 commercial jets
worth about $70 billion. The Machinists at Boeing are much younger
on the average than their counterparts at Eastern, and the union
leadership at Boeing didn't have a clear idea beforehand of whether
they would vote to strike, according to a union operative who asked
not to be identified.
   Machinists leaders and spokesmen at their national headquarters
in Washington were unavailable for comment Wednesday.
   Despite the bitter setback at Eastern, the strike strengthened
the resolve of Machinists around the nation and made them more
willing to fight for their demands, union activists say.
   William F. Genoese, director of the Teamsters union's Airline
Division, suggested that airlines waiting for their new jets also
might apply pressure to Boeing by threatening to turn to other
manufacturers.
   ``Boeing is a different type of situation and I think it's going
to be very effective,'' said Genoese, who is based in New York. ``I
think (the Machinists) are in a pretty good situation to get what
they want.''
   Unlike the Teamsters, the Machinists union is marked by the
autonomy of its local chapters. Charles Bryan, the leader of the
Machinists at Eastern, exercised a strong leadership role and was a
thorn in the side of former Eastern Chairman Frank Borman and
current boss Frank Lorenzo.
   Still, Machinists have long looked to their national leadership
for inspiration and tactical direction.
   William Winpisinger, the unapologetic, outspoken Machinists
leader, often labeled a socialist by critics, recently retired
after 12 years as the union's president. His successor, former
union vice president George Kourpias, is expected to maintain the
traditions.
   While ``Winpy'' has been the ideological standard-bearer of the
union, its tactical chief in airline matters is John Peterpaul, a
vice president who once worked as an airline mechanic and has a
commercial pilot's license.

<HEAD>Books Closed on '89 Model Year, Sales Better Than Expected</HEAD>

   Automakers have closed the books on the 1989
model year, pleased as sales came in a little higher than expected
but perhaps worried about what lies ahead.
   Domestic and overseas automakers reported they sold nearly 15.3
million cars and light trucks in the United States during the 1989
model year, which began Oct. 1, 1988, and ended Saturday. It
appears that when heavy truck sales are reported in a few weeks,
1989 will become the fifth-best model year in automotive history.
   Auto company executives and analysts had predicted that 1989
model-year sales would be about 15 million, stemming from a
softening economy and slackening demand for cars.
   ``Clearly, the dire predictions expressed by many analysts
during the spring and early summer did not materialize,'' said
Robert Rewey, vice president for sales for Ford's North American
automotive operations.
   The 1989 sales figure, 1.9 percent lower than 1988 sales, was
helped by an 8.7 percent rise in domestic car and truck sales
during the Sept. 21-30 period over the same time last year.
   General Motors Corp. said Wednesday its late September light
truck sales soared 45.3 percent over last year's levels. Ford Motor
Co.'s truck sales during the period were down 9 percent from last
year while Chrysler Corp.'s were up 6 percent.
   For all of September, GM reported light truck sales ran 42.3
percent ahead of last year's pace. Truck sales at Ford fell 4.4
percent and Chrysler's were up 0.8 percent for the month.
   ``Industry truck sales may increase for the eighth consecutive
model year with GM truck sales approaching 1.8 million and setting
an industry record,'' said James Fitzpatrick, vice president of the
GM marketing and product planning staff.
   GM led the model-year truck charge with sales 6.1 percent ahead
of last year. Chrysler's truck sales were up 1.6 percent while
Ford's were down 1.8 percent for the 1989 model year.
   On the car side among the Big Three, only Ford reported a gain
during the 1989 model year, with sales rising 3.2 percent over the
1988 figure. GM's car sales were off 1.8 percent and Chrysler's
were down 7.5 percent.
   For late September, GM car sales were up 13.7 percent and were
up 10.6 percent for the entire month. At Chrysler, late-September
sales were down 12.6 percent and down 2.5 percent for the month.
Ford's late-September sales were up 6.0 percent and for the month,
Ford car sales were up 2.1 percent.
   Despite the seemingly healthy numbers, some analysts recently
have expressed concern that sales during the third quarter of 1989
were fueled by consumers who had planned to buy in the current
quarter but acted early out of fear of 1990 price increases and the
possibility of fading incentives.
   ``What scares me a little bit is I think the faucet will shut
off,'' general manager Alan Helfman of River Oaks Chrysler-Plymouth
in Houston said Wednesday. But, he said, ``As soon as they hit some
rebates on those '90s, that faucet is going to open up again.''
   Each of the Big Three already has offered incentives on a
limited number of 1990 vehicles. But they aren't being offered to
consumers at the same level as were rebates and low-interest
financing deals just three or four months ago.
   However, some widespread dealer incentives are in effect,
especially at GM, the nation's largest carmaker.

   Here are sales results for the eight major
automakers with U.S. operations for the third period of September
1989.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were nine selling days in the period this year and nine
selling days in the same period last year.
   For the month, there were 25 selling days this year and 25
selling days last year, and for the year so far, 230 selling days
this year and 231 selling days last year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic and appear in
this table.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign.

<TEXT>
   Greyhound Lines will reduce some fares by as much
as 35 percent and will lower prices on its Money Saver fares good
for travel to any of the bus line's 10,000 destinations, a company
official said Wednesday.
   The fare reductions go into effect Friday and follow discounts
the company announced two months ago, said Ralph Borland,
Greyhound's vice president of marketing.
   ``We're cutting walk-up fares 5 to 20 percent on trips less than
300 miles to mirror customers' fall travel plans,'' Borland said.
``People purchasing 14-day advance purchase tickets can save up to
35 percent.''
   Greyhound will reduce its Money Saver fare, the lowest priced
one-way fare, from to $59 from $68 for Monday through Thursday
travel, Borland said. The Money Saver fare is good for one-way
travel to any of Greyhound's 10,000 destinations and carries a
30-day advance purchase requirement. The Money Saver fare remains
$68 for Friday through Sunday travel.
   The Money Saver fare will be increased to $75 during the
Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday season. The Money Saver fares
carry a $25 refund penalty.
   Borland said that unlike the airlines, Greyhound does not limit
the number of reduced fares sold and does not require round-trip
purchases for discount fares.
   Greyhound Lines, which includes Trailways, is the nation's
largest intercity bus company.

   California did not deliberately underpay
thousands of secretaries, nurses, clerks and other women workers, a
federal judge ruled in dismissing the country's largest
``comparable worth'' lawsuit.
   Wednesday's ruling dealt what could be a fatal blow to the
lawsuit filed on behalf of 60,000 or more past and present women
employees by the California State Employees' Association, which
claimed the state deliberately discriminated against women in
setting salaries.
   The union was ``shocked and disappointed'' by the ruling,
President Margaret Dean said in a statement.
   ``CSEA regrets the decision but in no way regrets filing the
case. We know that we brought to light a deliberate policy to pay
women less than men.''
   The union said it did not know if it would appeal U.S. District
Judge Marilyn Hall Patel's decision, which upheld the state's
argument that women in female-dominated jobs didn't suffer
discrimination because their pay scales reflected levels in the
private sector.
   ``We're obviously excited about the decision,'' said Christopher
Waddell, chief counsel for the state Department of Personnel
Administration. ``We perceive of this as being the core of the
case.''
   Patel, a former lawyer for the National Organization of Women,
left open the possibility that the union could try to prove illegal
discrimination through the effect of state salary and job
classifications on women's pay levels. A recent U.S. Supreme Court
ruling, however, has made that kind of suit much more difficult to
prove without proof of deliberate discrimination.
   The union ``failed to carry (its) burden of proof'' of showing
that California intentionally discriminated against female
employees, Patel ruled.
   The state produced credible evidence that its job classification
system, which dates from the 1930s, reflected market rates and a
state survey of job duties and responsibilities, Patel said.
   A state can rely on market rates in setting salaries even if it
knowingly pays less to women as a result, according to a 1985
ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The ruling was
written by Anthony Kennedy, who has since become a U.S. Supreme
Court justice.
   His ruling, which is binding on federal courts in California and
eight other Western states, has crippled lawsuits based on
``comparable worth,'' the doctrine that jobs with equal skill,
effort and responsibility should be paid equally.
   But relying on the marketplace enables employers to
institutionalize discrimination against women and minorities, said
Nancy Davis of Equal Rights Advocates, a San Francisco feminist law
firm involved in the lawsuit.
   ``It has been our position that the market itself is
discriminatory. If you accept the marketplace defense you're caught
in a vicious cycle you'll never break out of,'' she said.
   The union filed the suit in 1984, claiming workers in
predominantly female state jobs were deliberately underpaid for
decades because they were women. It sought hundreds of millions of
dollars in back pay.
   The union has resisted calling its suit a ``comparable worth''
case, saying it was a conventional claim of sex discrimination. But
it has been generally described as a comparable worth suit because
it is based on pay disparities between different types of jobs,
rather than unequal pay between men and women at the same job.
   As an example, the suit said stenographers, 99 percent of them
women, were being paid $1,107 to $1,283 a month, while
groundskeepers, 96 percent of them men, were making $1,342 to
$1,523. Licensed vocational nurses, 88 percent female, started at
$1,376 a month while automotive equipment operators, 99 percent
male, started at $1,645, according to the suit.
   Patel said that while women in female-dominated jobs had lower
salaries than workers in male-dominated jobs, pay for those women
employees matched pay for similar private jobs. Male state
employees, on the other hand, generally were paid less than their
counterparts in the private sector, Patel said.

   The U.S. dollar gained against the Japanese yen
today despite expectations of higher West German interest rates,
and share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose too.
   The dollar closed at 141.05 yen, up 0.45 yen from Wednesday's
close of 140.60 yen.
   Many investors stayed on the sidelines to see whether West
Germany's central bank, due to meet later in the day, would raise
interest rates, said a dealer with a major commercial bank,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   While dealers expect the German bank to raise interest rates,
many believe the dollar will remain strong anyway.
   Higher interest rates in a country tend to make its currency
more attractive to foreign investors, at the expense of other
currencies.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which gained 16.43 points Wednesday, added another 140.19
points, or 0.40 percent, closing at 35,522.99.
   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 900 million
shares.

   The United Mine Workers of America is joining
the AFL-CIO, four decades after John L. Lewis set the union on a
course of independence because of a bitter feud with other labor
leaders.
   The UMW's executive board Wednesday requested affiliation with
the 14 million member AFL-CIO, whose governing body is expected to
unanimously welcome its newest member in time for the federation's
convention next month.
   ``This decision is a further indication of the strong spirit of
solidarity that is manifest throughout the entire labor movement,''
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said in a statement.
   UMW President Richard Trumka said the union's board ``decided
that it is once again time for the UMWA to apply for membership in
the national labor federation, formalizing our ever-closer working
relations with the AFL-CIO and its member unions.''
   Good relations between Trumka and Kirkland and cooperation
between the UMW and the AFL-CIO in recent years have fueled
constant speculation about the affiliation.
   Kirkland, in 1983, became the first AFL-CIO president to address
a UMW convention and in 1985 Trumka became the first UMW chief to
speak at an AFL-CIO convention.
   The AFL-CIO and its unions have been highly supportive of the
UMW in its bitter, ongoing strike against the Pittston Coal Group.
The UMW, in turn, has been working to help other unions in recent
strikes, particularly those against Eastern Airlines and regional
telephone companies.
   Affiliation also has been seen as a logical course for the UMW
because of a precipitous decline in membership, which peaked at
nearly 600,000 in the 1940s but has fallen below 100,000.
   Lewis pulled the union from the American Federation of Labor in
1936 to help found the rival Congress of Industrial Organizations.
   He rose to CIO president, but resigned after Franklin D.
Roosevelt was elected to a third term in 1940. Lewis, a Republican,
a year later carried out his promise to pull the UMW from the group
if Roosevelt was re-elected.
   The UMW rejoined the AFL in 1946 but left the next year. Lewis
told the AFL of the decision in a terse note to Federation
President William Green.
   ``We disaffiliate,'' the note said.
   Lewis was heir-apparent to Green, but was irate that the AFL
negotiated a compromise with federal officials who wanted union
leaders to sign affidavits saying they weren't members of communist
organizations or didn't sympathize with communists.
   Among those who helped negotiate the compromise was George
Meany, who succeeded Green.
   The AFL and CIO merged in 1955. Lewis retired in 1960.
   Meany was AFL-CIO president until he retired and was succeeded
by Kirkland a decade ago.

   President Bush's choice to head natural
resource policies at the Agriculture Department says he's ``learned
a lot'' during a confirmation process that included harsh criticism
from members of the Senate Agriculture Committee.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the committee, charged
Wednesday that James Cason catered to special interest groups
during his seven-year tenure in a variety of high-ranking Interior
Department posts.
   ``Time and again, he's chosen the timber interests over the
public, the oil interests over the public and the mining interests
over the public,'' Leahy said in the second day of the confirmation
hearing.
   ``When given a choice, Mr. Cason picked the special interests
over the public trust.''
   Cason, 35, said he had ``learned a lot and been exposed to new
opinions'' during the confirmation process.
   He told Leahy if he becomes assistant secretary of agriculture
for natural resources and the environment he would ``appreciate
your continued advice on what the right thing is. Sometimes it is
difficult to know what is the right thing.''
   The committee will vote on the nomination after a closed debate
on whether to recommend that the full Senate approve him.
   Leahy made no secret of his problems with Cason's record, saying
at one point: ``We don't need another James Watt.''
   Testifying against Cason was Max Peterson, who from 1979 to 1987
ran the National Forest Service, an agency under the assistant
secretary's job that Cason seeks.
   Peterson said the decisions Cason made at the Interior
Department were ``uniformly bad when measured against any
reasonable standard of what is good for the public.''
   However, Patty McDonald, executive director of the Public Lands
Council, said Cason ``understands the multiple use mission'' of the
assistant agriculture secretary's job.
   McDonald's group represents 27,000 cattle and sheep producers
whose livestock graze on public lands.
   Cason's management abilities were questioned by Sen. Thomas
Daschle, D-S.D., who said a General Accounting Office report showed
that a system under Cason's jurisdiction for finding violators of
mining laws has been defective for four years.
   Cason blamed the computer system and said the problems were
being worked out.
   ``It says something about management'' when after four years
``it didn't get better,'' Daschle said.

<HEAD>Schwartz Disavows `Mommy Track,' Says Managers Must be More Flexible</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consultant Felice Schwartz denied she
advocates a dead-end ``Mommy Track'' for working mothers. She said
her studies show the need for managers to be flexible in finding
ways for career women to rise to the top.
   Ms. Schwartz told an audience of newspaper editors Wednesday
that managers, especially in the media, need to study changing
patterns in the work force, where she says women will account for
60 percent of the increase in the labor force by the year 2000.
   ``I believe women have had a harder time in the media than any
other field,'' she said in a luncheon address to the Associated
Press Managing Editors convention. She also told the editors that
media women reacted with more hostility than women in any other
field when they questioned her about a Harvard Business Review
article this year outlining her views on ``Management Women and the
New Facts of Life.''
   Feminist groups accused Ms. Schwartz of encouraging management
to put women down and push them out if they want to take time to
raise a family. While the article never used the term Mommy Track,
it did say the cost of employing women was greater than the cost of
employing men because some women leave to have children.
   The point of the article was that corporate leaders have to be
more flexible in accommodating the needs of women because the end
of the Baby Boom means employers will have to rely more on women to
fill top ranks, Ms. Schwartz said.
   She said it is a lesson that media management is slow in
learning, with women accounting for two-thirds of the graduates of
journalism schools, 57 percent of the entry level media jobs but
just one of three management positions and only 13 percent of
newspaper publishers.
   Given the large number of women in the lower levels of media
employment, ``it's discouraging when the pyramid narrows, women
continue to be squeezed out,'' she said.
   The best young women graduating from journalism schools will be
looking to see if there are women at the top of their prospective
employers, she said. If there aren't, she told the editors,
``you'll never be able to recruit the best and the brightest. Your
newspaper no longer will be able to stand up to the competition.''
   Ms. Schwartz said that while some media groups have made great
strides, the industry must follow the numerous corporations that
provide flexible working conditions for women, such as job-sharing
and part-time scheduling in the legal and accounting professions.
   ``How can a woman hope to get past the entry level if she faces
a daily deadline not only of getting out a story but also picking
up her children from school?'' Ms. Schwartz asked.
   She said it is important for women and management to openly
discuss their needs and for management to remove obstacles to
promotion for dedicated women who also want a family life.
   Making such subjects taboo will shortchange women and business,
she said.
   ``There no longer will be abundant male talent to meet your
management needs, but women are ready,'' she told the editors.

<HEAD>Pickens Won't Take Part In Koito Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens says he won't take
part in a special shareholders meeting of a Japanese autoparts
maker, saying he thinks management is plotting to manipulate the
outcome.
   Pickens said he will instead look for other ways to establish
his rights as the company's largest shareholder.
   ``We will not take part in a special sham shareholders
meeting,'' Pickens said. Pickens has invested more than $1 billion
to acquire a 26 percent stake in the company.
   After upping his stock from 20 percent, Pickens indicated last
month he might call for a special meeting. But Pickens said
Wednesday, ``Koito Chairman Takao Matsuura and Toyota are already
conspiring to orchestrate the meeting to a predetermined
conclusion.''
   Toyota Motor Co. is the major customer for the headlights Koito
manufactures, and several Koito board members are current or former
Toyota executives. Koito disputes Pickens' contention, however,
that Toyota controls three board seats.
   ``The recent actions of Koito, Toyota and other shareholders
reinforce our assessment of Japan's rigged corporate system, a
system that is closed to outsiders,'' Pickens said.
   Sidney L. Tassin, a partner in Boone Co., Pickens' Dallas-based
investment arm, said, ``They've already got everybody lined up over
there to defend against a shareholder meeting. It's clear that that
will not be an effective event. We're going to try some other
angles.''
   Since becoming Koito's largest shareholder earlier this year,
Pickens has been rebuffed in attempts to gain seats on the
20-member board. He has said the actions indicate that Japan is
closed to foreign investors.
   Pickens also has asked the board to increase its dividends
through distributing about $8 million the company received from
Japanese investor Kitaro Watanabe, who was ordered to return
profits from speculating in the company's stock. Pickens bought
most of his Koito holdings from Watanabe or affiliates.
   Because he has held at least 10 percent of Koito stock for at
least six months, Pickens can call for a stockholders meeting at
any time, and Tassin said that option still could be exercised.
   As a major shareholder, Pickens also has rights of access to
some information, including accounting and financial records.
``There are other types of business transactions that we can get in
a position to influence or approve,'' Tassin said.
   Pickens said he has written other Koito shareholders, asking
their opinion of and support for increasing the dividend, but has
received no replies. He said he will send a second letter before
determining further actions.
   Koito has said it will deal cautiously with Pickens because of
his ties to Watanabe, who twice has attempted to get the company to
repurchase his shares at a premium before he sold them to Pickens.

<TEXT>
   K-H Corp., formerly Fruehauf Corp., has
agreed to an amended purchase offer from Tononto-based Varity Corp.
totaling about $560 million in cash and securities, a spokesman
said.
   The offer is subject to approval by shareholders of both
companies at meetings to be held on Nov. 29, said K-H spokesman
David Hladik on Wednesday.
   The two companies have been in negotiations since August, when
K-H said it had failed to meet terms of an agreement to sell the
Kelsey Hayes Co. aluminum wheel and braking system business to
Varity for $650 million in cash, notes and stock.
   K-H is the last remaining business of the dismantled Fruehauf
Corp., which changed its name to K-H Corp. after selling its
truck-trailer and maritime operations to California-based Terex
Corp. in July. The truck-trailer operation continues as Fruehauf
Trailer Corp., a Terex subsidiary.
   Varity, formerly known as Massey-Ferguson, said in August it was
re-evaluating its offer for K-H because the $233 million K-H
received from Terex was $25 million to $30 million short of
projections.
   The K-H board agreed to Varity's new proposal Tuesday night,
Hladik said.
   Among other changes, Varity cut the cash it is offering to $41.3
million from $66 million, cut the number of Varity shares offered
to 37.8 million from 55.5 million and increased the amount of
Kelsey-Hayes notes it would guarantee to $436.8 million from $430
million, Hladik said.

<HEAD>OPEC Keeps Oil Taps Wide in September</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC nations kept their oil production
at a high level in September, pumping well above the output ceiling
just set by cartel officials, according to estimates released on
Thursday.
   The International Energy Agency said in its Monthly Oil Market
Report that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
lifted about 22.3 million barrels of crude a day in September, the
same as in August.
   ``Most of the higher output in August and September was from the
(Persian) Gulf countries, although production in Iran and Iraq fell
slightly in September,'' said the report by the Paris-based agency.
   Ian Graham, an analyst at County NatWest in London, predicted
the cartel's production would pick up a bit more in October, likely
to about 22.5 million barrels a day.
   Some countries, he said, will widen their taps to meet the
higher output quotas set last week by OPEC ministers meeting in
Geneva.
   During their talks, the officials decided to boost their overall
production ceiling from 19.5 million barrels a day to 20.5 million
barrels in the last three months of the year.
   The increase of 1 million barrels in the ceiling was divided
proportionately among all 13 member countries, giving each a little
more than under the current accord.
   Led by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, the cartel has been
producing well above its supply cap in recent months.
   Despite the flood of oil, prices have remained steady in recent
months, reflecting strong consumer demand for the commodity.
   However, prices remain under OPEC's target of $18 a barrel. The
average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEC was
$16.82 a barrel in the last week of September.
   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark American brand, has
topped the $20-a-barrel mark in recent days. Middle Eastern brands
run about $3 a barrel less.
   The energy agency estimated total consumption of oil, excluding
centrally planned economies, at 52.1 million barrels a day in 1989,
rising to 53.8 million barrels in the first quarter of next year.
Demand for OPEC oil was estimated at 22.2 million barrels in the
January-March period of 1990.
   Graham said Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates might trim their
output some in coming months to reflect ``a little more
discipline'' after the Geneva meeting.
   The two Gulf countries have been overproducing to draw attention
to their demands for higher shares of OPEC's total production.
   The ministers were scheduled to meet in late November in Vienna,
Austria, to map their strategy for the first half of 1990. They
were also expected to take up the sensitive issue of reallocating
output shares.
   The energy agency's report estimated the United Arab Emirates'
supplied 2.2 million barrels a day in September, double its quota
of about a million barrels. Kuwait's production was put at 1.7
million barrels a day, compared with its cap of a million barrels.
   Nigeria produced about 1.8 million barrels a day last month, up
from its quota of 1.4 million barrels a day, according to the
report.
   Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 1 crude exporter, pumped an
estimated 5 million barrels a day, above its target of 4.8 million
barrels.
   Iran and Iraq each lifted about 2.8 million barrels a day, the
same as their quotas.
   Other production estimates for September were: Qatar, 400,000
barrels a day; Libya, 1.1 million barrels; Algeria, 700,000
barrels; Gabon, 200,000 barrels; Venezuela, 1.7 million barrels;
Ecuador, 300,000 barrels; and Indonesia, 1.2 million barrels.
   The energy agency is an arm of the Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development, made up of two-dozen industrialized
nations.

   Two former researchers at a Johnson &amp;
Johnson subsidiary say the company concealed vital information
about a painkiller linked to at least nine deaths before it was
pulled from the market.
   In a lawsuit filed in Superior Court, the former McNeil
Pharmaceutical employees allege Johnson &amp; Johnson conspired to get
drugs on the market ``even if they were medically inadequate'' and
maximize sales ``regardless of consequences.''
   The two, Dr. Edward Lemanowicz, McNeil former assistant director
of regulatory affairs, and Dr. James Dale, a former assistant
director of medical research, also contend they were forced out of
McNeil for criticizing the drug, Zomax.
   A prescription painkiller developed in the 1970s, Zomax was
pulled from the market in 1983 after more than 2,000 reports of
violent reactions and at least nine deaths.
   Johnson &amp; Johnson, based in New Brunswick, issued a statement
Wednesday disputing the lawsuit's allegations. The company said the
drug was taken off the market voluntarily because reports of
allergic reactions had increased.
   ``There is no basis for their charge that Johnson &amp; Johnson and
McNeil Pharmaceutical falsified or delayed reporting any data about
Zomax or any other drug,'' the statement said.
   The researchers allege that testing on the drug before it was
put on the market was insufficient and that McNeil mishandled
reports of adverse reactions among patients that began coming in
after it was put on the market.
   The researchers are seeking compensation for lost wages and
possible punitive damages. They weren't actually fired after
raising objections but were sent into ``a kind of corporate
Siberia,'' said their attorney, Allan Kanner.

<HEAD>Budget Cuts Service on Passenger Rail System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government plans to halve Canada's passenger
train service next year and said it is willing to hear offers from
the private sector to take over any route, especially those
attractive to tourists.
   The long awaited announcement Wednesday in Ottawa was part of
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's program intended to trim the budget
deficit. Opposition leaders pledged to fight it, saying it would
destroy the government-run service known as Via Rail.
   ``They have turned the national dream into a national
nightmare,'' John Turner, leader of the opposition Liberal Party,
said. ``The last spike has become the last straw.''
   Transport Minister Benoit Bouchard said the cuts to be made Jan.
15 will allow the government to reduce its annual Via Rail
subsidies, now at $640 million, to $350 million by 1993.
   Via Rail President Ron Lawless said of a total of about 7,300
employees, 2,761 will lose their jobs, mainly in 1990.
   The cuts will leave Via Rail operating three weekly trains
linking central Canada with the East and West coasts; a major chunk
of its existing service along the populous corridor between Quebec
City, Quebec, and Windsor, Ontario; a couple of regional routes,
and eight remote services.
   Mulroney attempted to ease the political impact by announcing a
government commission would study all forms of passenger
transportation in Canada preparing for the next century, but it was
not clear whether rail service would be restored if the commission
recommends it.
   Bouchard said the commission will investigate the best ways to
move Canadians between the country's major cities and what such a
system could cost.
   He also said privatization that would improve service would be
welcome. ``Every route is up for sale,'' he said at a news
conference.
   The rail system played an important role in the East-West
development of Canada, the world's second-largest country, so the
proposal to reduce service can touch emotional chords.
   Among the services cut would be the Canadian, the domed Western
scenic train that is featured on many posters and postcards.
   Ed Broadbent, leader of the socialist New Democratic Party and
another key opposition figure, said the cuts were a disgrace and
would affect the country's poorest regions the most.
   Broadbent said public opinion could be mobilized to change the
plan. ``I think the government could be persuaded to come to its
senses again,'' he said.

<HEAD>EDS: new throughout to UPDATE with rates; no pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell in Europe Thursday afternoon
after central banks raised interest rates.
   The West German Bundesbank set a one percentage point increase
in both its discount and Lombard rates to 6 and 8 percent,
respectively.
   The announcement was soon echoed in London, where the Bank of
England said it would raise the base lending rate to 15 percent,
from 14 percent. Commercial banks quickly started to fall into line.
   Britain's base rate increase is the first since May 24, when the
key interest rate was boosted to 14 percent from 13 percent. The
base lending rate now is double the 7.5 percent low reached in May
1988 when the British government tightened monetary policy in an
effort to combat domestic inflation.
   The Treasury said Thursday the European interest rate hikes
reflect ``a general concern to take no risks on inflation.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.45 yen to a closing 141.05 yen. In
London, it was quoted at 140.95 Thursday afternoon compared with
141.60 at midmorning.
   The dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $1.6165 to
buy one pound Thursday afternoon, more than 1 cent more expensive
for buyers than $1.6040 at midmorning and $1.6055 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates, compared with late Wednesday include:
1.8668 West German marks, down from 1.8770; 1.6170 Swiss francs,
down from 1.6275; 6.3425 French francs, down from 6.3700; 2.1200
Dutch guilders, up from 2.1185; 1,367.25 Italian lire, down from
1,373.50, and 1.1733 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1742.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $366.60 a troy ounce, up
from late Wednesday's $366.25. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a higher recommended price of $366.90.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $367, up from $366 late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 61 cents to close at a bid
$367.11.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.26 a troy
ounce, up from Wednesday's $5.24.

   Stock prices pulled back a bit today as a round
of increases in European interest rates blunted the rally that has
carried the market to record highs this week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 5.89 to 2,765.20
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 8 to 7 in the early tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 434 up, 500 down and
529 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.13 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Before the market opened, word flashed across financial news
circuits of a 1 percentage point increase in key West German
interest rates.
   Rate increases were quickly posted in England, France and
several other European countries.
   The dollar declined on the news, reflecting the expectation that
higher rates in Europe would attract money away from U.S.
investments.
   However, analysts said those developments did not catch Wall
Street totally by surprise. In addition, analysts said stock
traders' spirits were energized by an offer from investor Donald
Trump to acquire AMR Corp. for $120 a share.
   AMR shares were delayed in opening, as were those of UAL and
Delta Air Lines. Pan Am led the active list, up \ at 3~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .15 at 197.83. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .44 at 394.80.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 16.53 to
2,771.09, stretching its gain since the start of the week to 78.27
points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 on the
NYSE, with 812 up, 652 down and 507 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 194.59 million shares, up from 182.55
million in the previous session.

   The Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank, today announced it
has raised its key lending rates by 1 percent and other European
central banks quickly followed with similar rate hikes.
   The move appeared to be aimed at curbing inflation and
supporting European currencies, which have weakened against the
dollar despite concerted central bank intervention in recent days.
   The widely expected announcement by the Bundesbank sent the
dollar sliding. In Frankfurt, the U.S. currency dropped one pfennig
to 1.8653 marks from 1.8760 in early morning trading. In London the
dollar, which had risen against the pound on Wednesday, fell to
$1.6165 from $1.6055.
   Currency analysts said before the announcement that a
half-percentage point increase already was factored into the market
and would not affect the dollar but that a bigger increase would
dampen the U.S. currency.
   The Bundesbank set the new discount rate at 6 percent, with the
Lombard rate at 8 percent. It was the fourth interest-rate rise
this year for the West German central bank.
   Meanwhile, central banks in Britain, Austria and the Netherlands
raised their rates by 1 percent to 15 percent, 6.5 percent and 7
percent respectively.
   The Bank of France increased its key rate by 3@4 percent to 9.5
percent, and the five to 10-day repurchase rate by the same amount
to 10.25 percent. And the Swiss National Bank boosted its discount
rate by a half percentage point to 6 percent.
   The discount rate is the cheapest, or bottom rate at which a
bank can borrow funds, using treasury bills as collateral. Nearly
half of bank financing comes from discount rate funds in West
Germany.
   The Lombard rate is the rate at which European central banks
loan short-term funds using securities as collateral. It's the
ceiling of the money market rates. Banks normally borrow Lombard
funds only in emergency.
   Bundesbank officials, in a statement released to the news media,
said the rate increases, the fourth since the beginning of the
year, ``were intended to combat continued inflationary danger,''
resulting from the country's strong economy.
   Some commercial banks in Europe followed the central banks
announcement with rate increases of their own.

<HEAD>Book Urging Assertive Japan Criticized Abroad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>

   When a leading Japanese businessman and an
outspoken politician collaborated on a book urging Japan to stand
up to its huge ally, the United States, their message was not
intended for export.
   But an unauthorized English translation of ``The Japan That Can
Say No'' has forced both the authors and publisher to deal with
heated criticism from Washington.
   ``To a certain extent we expected a fuss abroad,'' said Hiroshi
Endo, who supervised the Kobunsha publishing company's handling of
the work. ``But we think some of the reaction in the U.S. is too
emotional, and created by congressmen who want to use anti-Japan
themes to get votes.''
   Endo said vocal opposition on Capitol Hill has been led by
Representative Mel Levine, D-Cal, and that Levine commissioned a
74-page translation that circulated in Congress in August.
   Written by Akio Morita, co-founder of the Sony Corp., and
Shintaro Ishihara, a former novelist, Cabinet minister and
candidate for prime minister, the 160-page original examines
Japan's relations with the United States and the two nations'
frequent trade frictions.
   While Morita argues that the United States must regain the
competitiveness its industries once enjoyed and scolds American
managers' short-sightedness, Ishihara laments a wimpish Japan
constantly capitulating to U.S. pressure.
   A chapter by Ishihara, the more aggressive of the two authors,
delves into what he sees as latent bigotry behind Washington's
dealings with Tokyo.
   ``I believe at the base of the friction between the United
States and Japan is racial prejudice,'' Ishihara wrote. The white
race, and particularly American whites, he wrote, have become
overly proud of their civilization.
   He went on to say that, realizing their culture is declining,
the American whites' fear of losing leadership to the ``yellow race
Japanese'' has clouded their perspective of Japan.
   Ishihara was a dark-horse candidate to replace former Prime
Minister Sousuke Uno, who stepped down Aug. 9 to accept
responsibility for the governing Liberal Democratic Party's losses
in a parliamentary election the month before. Backed by some of the
party's right wing, Ishihara finished third in the three-man race.
   Though the book caused some howls in Washington, it made few
waves among the intended audience, the Japanese.
   ``Most of what Mr. Ishihara and Mr. Morita are stressing in
their book is not new and has been expressed privately by
(Japanese) journalists and businessmen who deal with America,''
wrote Taro Kimura, a former anchorman for the Japan Broadcasting
Corp. television network.
   Kimura, in a column published recently by the daily Tokyo
Shimbun, said the bluntness of the opinions might have shocked some
Americans, who are used to dealing with more reticent Japanese.
Kimura argued that his countrymen should learn from the American
ability to speak out and debate issues head-on.
   ``It is conceivable that the controversy surrounding this book
may have been exaggerated by Japan. Treating the comments of these
two men as a seed of danger in U.S.-Japan relations is an overly
Japanese way of thinking,'' he concluded.
   ```The Japan That Can Say No' is under heavy criticism in the
United States,'' said a recent article in the conservative weekly
Shukan Bunshun magazine. ``But what is it about this book, written
with the intention of improving the deteriorating U.S.-Japan
relationship, that is so anti-American and arrogant?''
   Kobunsha's Endo believes the book may have touched a sore nerve
by, among other things, suggesting Japan could drastically alter
the superpowers' military balance by selling its technology to the
Soviets.
   In 1986, Toshiba Machine Co. was accused of selling restricted
high-tech equipment to the Soviet Union, prompting tough criticism
from Congress, which claimed the equipment helped the Soviets build
harder-to-detect submarines by enabling them to make quieter
propeller blades.
   Washington later punished Toshiba Machines' giant parent
company, the Toshiba Corp., by prohibiting it from exporting goods
to the United States for three years beginning in 1988. The U.S.
action was widely denounced in Japan.
   ``The chapter on racial prejudice may have also (been sensitive)
because Americans are more conscious of racial issues than Japanese
are,'' Endo said. ``But we hope readers will be reasonable when
they make their decisions about what they agree or disagree with,
instead of simply claiming it's all wrong.''
   Though Endo and Ishihara have complained that mistakes in the
English translation added fuel to the fire, an official version may
not be in the works.
   ``We hope to publish a translation, but the authors have not
decided whether that is what they want. It's still under
negotiation,'' Endo said.
   Coauthor Ishihara was quoted as telling the Shukan Bunshun: ``I
wrote the book with Japanese readers in mind and, though of course
I'm not saying that the same things can't be said to Americans, I
don't recognize the significance of hurrying (a translation) out in
America.''
   For Endo, however, this cloud has a silver lining.
   ``Sales are very good thanks to the controversy in Washington,''
he said, adding that roughly 70,000 copies have been sold.
   Endo said sales were brisk soon after the book was released in
late January, and a slump that followed has been more than made up
for since August, when reports of the Congressional response
appeared in Japan's press.

<HEAD>Those Checks Mount Up When It Comes Time to Sort and Balance</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's no Fort Knox, but on an average
night about $500 million passes through Iowa's capital.
   The money is in checks, those millions of pieces of paper that
glue the American economy together.
   Mixed in with the Social Security benefit checks and payments on
telephone and electric bills are transactions ranging from a 40
cent prize to a ``first round sweepstakes'' winner to a $1 rebate
for the purchase of a women's shaver.
   There also is a check for $87,249.95 to an excavating company
paid by a city's treasury, $157,494.75 sent from one financial
services company to another and a $26 million government-related
deposit with a bank.
   ``An economy is not going to work unless there are transactions,
and cash is not practical,'' says David Lawrence, a banking
professor at Drake University.
   In some of those transactions, the amount is not worth the paper
it is written on.
   Linda Conley, who has been shifting bundles of checks at the
Federal Reserve regional check processing center at Des Moines for
16 years, occasionally comes across one made out to no dollars and
no cents.
   It's the type of transaction that keeps certain investment or
bank accounts active, even if no money changes hands.
   There are 1.2 million checks processed before every sunrise at
the Des Moines center, each averaging about $450, and an additional
12,500 in checks returned for problems ranging from missing
signatures to insufficient funds.
   Each must be credited to the recipient's account and deducted
from the payee's.
   ``We're like a factory here. Our product is taking bundles of
checks, reading those checks, bundling them and delivering them
somewhere,'' says Edward Ketchmark, an assistant vice president of
the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago who manages the Des Moines
operation.
   What seems like a flood of paper passing through Des Moines is a
trickle in a roaring river nationwide.
   Last year, the Federal Reserve System processed more than 18.3
billion checks totaling more than $12.4 trillion, including
personal and corporate checks, postal money orders and government
checks.
   For the Fed, it's an industry.
   Among other things, it requires a fleet of Fed airplanes to
ferry the paper, hardware capable of sorting 300,000 checks an
hour, and business hours that get frenetic after most offices have
closed.
   The arcane paper shuffling that makes the checking system work
could be replaced if the economy adopted an electronic system that
made cash and checks obsolete. ``But until then, there's no real
alternative,'' Lawrence says.
   It takes squads of clerks at each financial institution and an
army of federal employees to make the system work.
   Sarah Fatino of Des Moines has a job that would intimidate
anyone who can't balance a checkbook.
   The 17-year veteran tracks discrepancies between what banks say
their checks total and what Fed computers say they have processed.
   In one case, Fed computers say a bank in northwest Iowa was
$5.16 too low when it added bundles of checks totaling
$1,690,462.20.
   By matching computer records with the piles of checks, she found
a $20 travelers check tallied by the bank as $14.84.
   Nearby Ms. Fatino is Kurt Chapman of Des Moines, operating a
Burroughs 9195 sorter processing out-of-state checks. The machine
counter looks like a digital watch gone wild.
   Each of those checks is bound for one of the other 47 Fed
processing centers around the country.
   The sorter scans the numbers along the bottom left side of each
check.
   In Iowa, for example, checks drawn on banks in 93 of the state's
99 counties begin with the numbers 0739 or 0730. The 07 stands for
the 7th Federal Reserve District, based in Chicago. The 3 is for
the Des Moines center. The 0 stands for Des Moines banks and the 9
stands for banks outside Des Moines but within the district.
   Numbers on checks from credit unions and savings and loans in
the processing center's district begin with a 27 to distinguish
them. The numbers that follow the first four digits identify the
bank, savings and loan or credit union where the check is drawn.
   Chapman whips rubber bands from around his fist, wraps bundles
of checks and puts them in bins. The checks must be sorted by 1:30
a.m. to make the Fed's Interdistrict Transportation System flight
out of Des Moines.
   ``You have to make sure you put the bundle in the right spot,''
says Chapman, 22, who has been doing the job for 2{ years. ``If it
goes to the wrong bank you (the check processing center) have to
pay interest on it. It could be a million dollar check.''
   Sometimes he consults a computer that tells him how many items
have been processed, the percentage rejected by the sorter and how
many checks have been handled before the first paper jam.
   Maybe the check has been folded, ripped or smeared by grease or
peanut butter.
   In the slow period, 10:45 p.m. to 11:45 p.m., 33,315 items have
run through the machine with fewer than 1 percent rejected. The
first jam occurred after 16,657 checks had passed through.
   The process is accelerating under a federal law aimed at
reducing the wait before an individual can use funds deposited by
check.
   As of Sept. 1, 1990, financial institutions generally will have
up to two business days after a local check has been deposited to
make the money available to a customer and up to five days for
checks from out-of-town.
   The Expedited Funds Availability Act of 1987 still is in the
transition phase, but already it has changed the way Americans
endorse checks, and affected the operations of payroll departments,
printing companies and makers of banking equipment.
   Individuals now have just 1{ inches on the rear of a check for
their endorsement.
   The bank accepting the check for deposit, which is at risk if
the check is not honored by the issuing bank, has a space
immediately below the endorsement reserved for its endorsement,
which must be in black or purple ink.
   The remaining three inches is set aside for any other financial
institution that handles the check, including those that refuse to
honor the check. Those endorsements must not be printed in purple
ink.
   With every institution handling a check leaving its stamp on the
document, such attention to detail is an attempt to give processors
a helping hand, especially when they have to backtrack a check that
has bounced.
   ``Looking at the back of a check is like a very difficult
puzzle. It's been handled by so many financial institutions the
trail gets pretty cold,'' says Ketchmark. ``Sometime you need some
really sharp people to determine the bank of first deposit.''

<HEAD>Latest Japanese Transplant Smallest Yet, Faces Riskiest Future</HEAD>

   When Subaru-Isuzu Automotive Inc.
celebrates the opening of its assembly plant in Lafayette later
this month, workers will carry a portable Japanese shrine weighing
as much as a ton.
   Some industry analysts say the joint-venture company may bear a
greater burden, the challenge of competing as the smallest Japanese
auto ``transplant'' in the United States.
   ``I think it's going to be a very tough road to profitability,''
said Charles J. Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York. ``There is
a potential to be profitable, but it certainly won't be easy.''
   Subaru-Isuzu, which will showcase the plant to the public during
a week of grand opening celebrations beginning Oct. 15, started
production of its first Subaru Legacy cars and Isuzu pickup trucks
in early September.
   The company has said that when it reaches full production with
two shifts, sometime after next June, it should be able to produce
120,000 vehicles annually. A phase-two expansion of the plant
originally was projected to boost production to 240,000 vehicles,
but has since been scaled back to 200,000.
   The start of production follows an occasionally tempestuous
three years since the announcement that the joint venture by two of
Japan's smallest automakers would build its $550 million plant at
the intersection of Interstate 65 and Ind. 38 southeast of
Lafayette.
   The announcement was welcomed by a city still smarting from
losing to Normal, Ill., in the competition for the
Chrysler-Mitsubishi plant a year earlier. It bestowed pride on a
state commerce department that had succeeded, after repeated
failure, in landing a Japanese auto plant.
   That pride soured, however, when the state's top commerce
official, Lt. Gov. John Mutz, ran for governor last year. His
opponent, Democratic Secretary of State Evan Bayh, lambasted Mutz
in campaign ads, saying the state had paid too dearly when it
provided Subaru-Isuzu with $86 million in incentives. Bayh won.
   He is among the dignitaries scheduled to attend the grand
opening, a symbol, perhaps, of the harmony that Subaru-Isuzu
executives and production ``associates'' extol when asked why they
work there.
   Subaru's parent company, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., owns 51
percent of the joint venture and Isuzu Motors Ltd. owns 49 percent.
General Motors Corp. owns 42 percent of Isuzu. About 60 Japanese
managers and administrators will be employed at the joint venture.
   Rick McKinnon, who came as vice president of manufacturing after
23 years with GM, said he was lured by the Japanese team philosophy
in which workers share tasks in groups and provide greater input
into decision-making.
   ``They look for team players and team involvement, and in my
personal involvement here with the management team I feel much more
of a team player here than I did at General Motors,'' McKinnon said.
   Mark Skidmore, 35, of Lafayette, a team leader in paint
maintenance, went to Japan for three months of training. He said
his team practices self-management: They tackle a maintenance call
at first, then some team members leave for other tasks as the
problem at hand is reduced.
   Skidmore, who previously worked at the Aluminum Company of
America plant a couple of miles down the highway, is sold on the
Japanese work ethic.
   ``They care about what they sell. American companies have lost
that caring,'' he said.
   He and McKinnon are among about 600 employees at the joint
venture. Christine Miller, chief spokeswoman for the plant, said it
expects to employ about 1,200 by yearend and 1,700 when it reaches
full capacity in its first phase, sometime after a second
production shift is added in June.
   The number of employees could reach 3,200 under the second
phase, but Miller and McKinnon did not disclose a timetable for the
expansion.
   The production will be split between Subarus and Isuzus, with
the Legacy and Isuzu pickup the first to be produced. Early next
year the Isuzu line will produce a sport utility vehicle similar to
the current Trooper model.
   The second phase originally was forecast to raise production to
240,000 vehicles annually, but Miller said that total has been
reduced to 200,000 so the plant would not violate an air-pollution
permit.
   ``I don't believe that's the real reason,'' said Kathleen
Heaney, an auto analyst with Nikko Securities Co. International
Inc. in New York. ``I bet it's a slow market.
   ``Subaru is already trying to sell the Legacy (as an import) and
is not doing that well. They're bringing in a brand new model and
they're not competing,'' Heaney said. ``I think ... the Isuzu part
will do better than the Subaru.''
   Thomas Gibson, president of Subaru of America, recent told the
trade publication Automotive News that sales of the Legacy have
been disappointing, ``not as well as I'd like.''
   Oppenheimer's analyst Brady noted the joint venture was
increasing the supply of vehicles when demand was weak. Subaru has
heavily discounted prices to reduce inventories.
   ``The Legacy is offering me the same kind of vehicle as the
Toyota Camry, the Mazda 626, or the Honda Accord,'' Brady said. ``I
don't know if the Legacy, being a new nameplate, commands the same
kind of respect those other vehicles do.''
   Asked to speculate on whether this Japanese transplant might be
the first to fail, Brady said: ``I think it's the leader in term of
betting right now.''
   The joint venture's president, Tamon Yamamoto, has said the
company cannot survive unless it boosts production, but some
analysts disagree.
   Ron Glantz of Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco, for
example, said the venture can survive by producing a smaller volume
of vehicles.
   Another uncertainty is unionization. William E. Osos, who
directs activities of the United Auto Workers in Kentucky and
Indiana, said he hopes the strength unions enjoy in Indiana will
help when the UAW attempts to organize the plant.
   Workers rejected the UAW in a recent election at the Nissan
Motor Co. assembly plant at Smyrna, Tenn., but the union
successfully organized employees at the Chrysler-Mitsubishi venture
in Illinois, Diamond-Star Motors Co.
   Figures supplied by the local Chamber of Commerce show the
eight-county area around Lafayette with 47 percent unionization in
manufacturing companies. That compared with 81 percent in
Indianapolis, 88 percent in Fort Wayne, 84 percent in South Bend
and 94 percent in Gary.
   ``Subaru-Isuzu's policy,'' Miller said, ``is because we embrace
and endorse the team concept, we do not feel a third party is
needed.''
   Workers interviewed at the plant expressed similar feelings.
   ``I really don't think we have to fight for what we need here,''
said Ramiro Mendoza, 31, of Frankfort, a team leader in the
bumper-painting section. ``I think they're fair.''

   It is perhaps no small irony that a
highly sought Japanese auto plant was built on a road known as the
Bataan Memorial Highway, memorializing a bitter U.S. defeat to the
Japanese on a Philippine peninsula and the resulting ``death
march'' in which thousands died.
   Or is it?
   The Bataan highway signs are down because of road improvements,
but there are no plans to change the name of Ind. 38, the address
of Subaru-Isuzu Automotive Inc., which is bringing as many as 3,200
jobs to the Lafayette area, Mayor James Riehle said.
   ``It's a reminder, at least in my style of thinking, of the
horrors of war,'' Riehle said.
   Don't forget it was the United States that helped rebuild
Japanese industry after the destruction wrought by World War II, he
said.
   ``You can say their success has been our success, too.''
   The success or failure of the joint venture won't be known for
years, but already Lafayette has succeeded in recruiting what will
be its largest employer after Purdue University, in spurring other
development and in laying the groundwork for future expansion of
the city.
   ``Projects that had been planned for some time in the future are
being looked at and perhaps expedited,'' said Riehle, who has been
mayor 17 years.
   Those projects include a 33 percent upgrade in the capacity of
the wastewater treatment plant and extension of a 24-inch water
main southeast of the city into an area that basically doubles the
infrastructure for business.
   ``It gave the county a whole new system of expansion,'' said
Susan Quick, a local property broker. ``Retailers are starting to
look at this area much more closely.''
   Ms. Quick is co-developer of Park East, a 247-acre retail,
office and warehousing development planned along Ind. 26 east of
Lafayette and a couple of miles north of the Japanese auto plant.
The project predates the plant, but Ms. Quick cannot ignore her new
neighbor.
   ``The car plant was just great for us.''
   Ms. Quick said she and others in the community believed at first
there was no need for a huge auto plant that might upset the
balance of an already thriving community with an unemployment rate
of 3 percent.
   Mark S. Davis, president of the Greater Lafayette Progress Inc.
and the leader of local development efforts, said the joint venture
offered the local economy diversification and high-paying jobs with
good benefits.
   ``These are the best manufacturing jobs we could go after,''
Davis said. ``It gets into fairness or equity. Not everybody wants
to be a software engineer.''
   The Lafayette area has lost many other jobs recently, including
about 600 at General Foods and 250 each at Pillsbury and North
American Phillips operations, Davis said.
   ``Economic development is not a game. It is a deadly serious
business, with human, family impacts. The deaths are not the issue;
births are the issue. If you're creating jobs, your community will
continue to prosper,'' Davis said.
   Nonetheless, the plant also has stirred some fear and prejudice.
   The Rev. Carl Malmgren, pastor of the First Baptist Church, said
the arrival of the plant fueled unfounded rumors that Japanese were
buying a local country club to indulge their passion for golf.
   They were uglier aspects, too. Some people who got jobs at the
new plant were isolated by former co-workers, Malmgren said.
   ``I think the big thing is fear that gets played on _ fear of
the unknown, fear of things we have no control over,'' Malgren
said. ``I don't really believe the arrival of the Japanese is the
issue. The issue is change that can no longer be handled.
   ``The Japanese became a lightning rod.''

   The French government, defying strong U.S.
objections, intends to sell Brazil rocket engine technology that
could be converted to ballistic missile use and wind up in the
hands of enemy states, U.S. officials said today.
   The Bush administration is studying whether it can do anything
to reverse the French decision, which was made personally by
President Francois Mitterrand last month, said the officials, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The deal calls for France to transfer to Brazil the technology
of a liquid fuel motor called Viking, which is also used in the
French Ariane rockets, the officials said.
   France has promised to place restrictions on the sale so that
the motor is only used for peaceful space programs, but the United
States contends such safeguards cannot be implemented.
   U.S. officials noted that Brazil and Libya are cooperating in an
attempt to develop ballistic missile boosters and said the French
technology could be passed to Libya for that project.
   ``If someone like Libya wants to use this motor to harmful
purposes, who will stop them?'' said one official.
   The United States first protested the planned French sale last
July during the seven-nation economic summit in Paris, the official
said.
   For a while it appeared the protest had stopped the French plan,
the officials said.
   But the French government reconsidered its decision when it
appeared France stood to lose a lucrative contract for the launch
of two Brazilian communication satellites on the Ariane launch
vehicle, the officials said.
   St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp., which is competing with
the French company Arianespace for the $60 million contract, was
informed by Brazil of France's intention to transfer the Viking
technology to the Brazilians, the officials said.
   China also bid for the launch contract but could not meet the
deadlines and withdrew, the officials said.
   Word of the dispute between France and the United States was
first reported by Signal magazine, published by the Armed Forces
Communications and Electronic Association.

   Stock prices were mixed today as a round of
increases in European interest rates blunted the rally that has

<HEAD>Crop Futures Retreat On Harvest Pressure, Export Disappointment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were slightly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting harvest pressure and disappointment over the size of
recent foreign sales of U.S. grain.
   The rapidly advancing corn and soybean harvest was a major
factor in the early decline, said William Biedermann, research
director for Allendale Inc., a futures brokerage in Crystal Lake,
Ill.
   ``Harvest conditions have been unbelievably great,'' he said.
   With early harvest results showing better-than-expected yields,
many traders expect the Agriculture Department to increase its corn
and soybean production estimates in next Thursday's crop report.
   One private research firm, Sparks Commodities Inc. of Memphis,
Tenn., issued its new crop estimates Wednesday, pegging the 1989
U.S. soybean crop at 1.92 billion bushels and the corn crop at 7.39
billion bushels.
   Those estimates compare with last month's USDA projections of
1.89 billion bushels of soybeans and 7.32 billion bushels of corn.
   Recent sales of wheat to Egypt and corn to the Soviet Union were
smaller than expected, prompting further selling of grain futures.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent to 1{ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in December at $4.08{ a bushel; corn
was { cent to 1\ cents lower with December at $2.38{ a bushel; oats
were { cent to } cents lower with December at $1.45{ a bushel;
soybeans were { cent to 2{ cents lower with November at $5.75 a
bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mixed
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .30 cent higher with October at
71.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .30 cent higher
with October at 83.45 cents a pound; hogs were .12 cent lower to
.63 cent higher with October at 45.40 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .13 cent lower to .08 cent higher with February at
48.15 cents a pound.
   Live cattle advanced on Wednesday but other livestock and meat
futures declined.

   Harrah's will become Nevada's first
hotel-casino to help compulsive gamblers break the habit that
enriches gaming halls but destroys lives.
   The hotel-casino Wednesday said it will donate $250 a month for
the next year to operate a hotline for addicted gamblers.
   William Sherman, the resort's attorney, said signs soon will be
posted telling customers and employees where to call for help.
   The hotline will be operated by the Nevada Council on Compulsive
Gambling and could go into operation as early as Friday.
   Signs listing a telephone number to help addicted gamblers have
been posted in Atlantic City's 12 casinos since 1987, including
Harrah's Marina. But Edwards said casinos in Nevada have ignored
the problem of compulsive gamblers.
   In Nevada, the Harrah's corporation owns Harrah's Reno, Harrah's

   Sony is buying Columbia Pictures. Dai-Ichi
Kangyo bank is acquiring CIT Group. Beacham Group has merged with
SmithKline Beckman. Other foreign companies have targeted American
businesses ranging from airlines to tiremakers.
   Are overseas investors buying the U.S. out from under us? Is it
time to panic?
   That depends on whom you ask.
   ``We should be delighted,'' said economist Ward McCarthy. ``It
will reinvigorate our economy.''
   In the global market, money flows from one country to another
and that means new capital for firms and industries that need it in
the United States, said McCarthy, of Stone &amp; McCarthy Research
Associates Inc.
   The government also appears unconcerned.
   ``It shows confidence in the U.S. economy and the long-term
outlook for the nation,'' said the Commerce Department's chief
economist, Tony Villamil.
   Furthermore, foreigners haven't taken that big a bite of the
United States, Villamil said.
   ``U.S. firms owned 10 percent or more by a foreign firm or
individual accounts for only 1.3 percent of the total value of U.S.
tangible assets and real estate assets,'' he said.
   But some congressmen say there should be more regulation of
takeovers by foreigners. Their concern has been heightened by the
current takeover battle in Britain over BAT Industries PLC because
BAT's Batus Inc. subsidiary owns major insurance, retailing,
tobbaco and paper companies in this country.
   A group of lawmakers sent a letter to Secretary of State James
A. Baker III warning that BAT's suitors, led by financier Sir James
Goldsmith, could ``break up Batus without concern for the effect on
the workers, citizens or environment of the communities in which
Batus operates.''
   Even without the BAT situation, many Americans are concerned
because of a spate of highly visible foreign acquisitions that at
least give the appearance that the United States is in danger of
losing control of its economic destiny.
   Last year, for example:
   _Grand Metropolitan PLC of Britain bought Pillsbury Co. for
$5.68 billion.
   _Canada's Campeau Corp. purchased Federated Department Stores
Inc. for $6.6 billion.
   _Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. was bought by Bridgestone Corp. of
Japan fo $2.65 billion, 1988.
   _Sony purchased CBS Records for $2 billion.
   In recent weeks, stockholders approved the $16 billion merger of
SmithKline with Britain's Beacham, Sony agreed to pay $3.4 billion
for Columbia Pictures and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. decided
to sell its CIT Group unit to Dai-Ichi Kangyo for $1.28 billion.
   These sound like big numbers, but according to Villamil, direct
foreign investment in the United States amounts to about $330
billion _ roughly equal to American investment overseas.
   He warned that Americans cannot discriminate against foreign
investors and still expect other countries to open their markets to
U.S. dollars.
   During the first three quarters of this year, foreigners
acquired 177 U.S. companies totaling $41.25 billion, compared with
165 firms worth $56.55 billion in the same period of 1988,
according to Securities Data Co., a Newark, N.J.-based research
firm. The figures were based on transactions worth at least $10
million.
   Foreign interest in U.S. companies burgeoned in the mid-1980s
after the dollar began to decline and American targets became
relative bargains for businessmen seeking to expand in this country.
   In early 1985, for example, it took as much as 262 Japanese yen
to buy a single U.S. dollar. Today, a Japanese investor needs to
put up only about 140 yen for each $1 in American assets or stock.
   Economist McCarthy says nationalism is behind many of the
objections to foreign takeovers: ``There's a feeling, why do we
need someone else to do it?'' According to Robert B. Reich, a
professor of political economics and management at Harvard
University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, foreigners are
only catching up to the American takeover strategists.
   ``We were the ones who started the takeover craziness in the
1970s,'' said Reich. ``It's hypocritical of us to be turning around
and saying it's unfair.'' The Bush administration, like the Reagan
administration before it, has no desire to stop foreign buyouts of
U.S. firms, but Congress has given the government some power to
intervene in certain transactions.
   Last year's Trade Act includes a provision giving the president
authority to block takeovers by foreigners if there is credible
evidence the acquirers might take steps that could harm national
security.
   Citing national security concerns, the Transportation Department
has intervened in two airline deals recently _ the $3.65 billion
takeover of NWA Inc., Northwest Airline's parent, and the proposed
$6.75 billion buyout of United Airline's owner, UAL Corp. _ because
foreign airlines were acquiring substantial stakes in the U.S.
carriers.
   In the Northwest buyout, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines had planned to
acquire a 57 percent stake, but U.S. officials ordered that the
buyout be restructured and that KLM's holdings be reduced to 25
percent.
   Officials are still studying the United deal, in which British
Airways would hold a 15 percent stake.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner has said the
government's actions were not meant to discourage foreign
investment here.
   The issue, he said, was more military than economic. During
testimony on Capitol Hill, he noted that under the Federal Aviation
Act, ``Congress wished to safeguard national security by ensuring
that U.S. air carriers would provide aircraft to the armed forces
in times of war or national emergency.''
   The fight over BAT has officials and labor unions upset because
they believe BAT's U.S. companies _ and their thousands of workers
_ are pawns in a foreign game, and there is little anyone in the
United States can do.
   Their fears are not unfounded: Goldsmith, who wants to break up
BAT, has already lined up a buyer for Farmers Insurance Group Inc.,
which BAT won just last year in a takeover fight of its own. BAT
itself plans to sell its Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's
store chains as part of its defense strategy.
   Besides expressing their outrage to the State Department,
several lawmakers sought the help of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, but the agency said it did not have the authority to
intervene in the battle.
   Dan Goelzer, SEC general counsel, explained in an interview that
``We wouldn't have regular jurisdiction because the offer wasn't
being extended to shareholders in the U.S.''
   Goldsmith's opponents here are hinging their hopes on the fact
that he cannot acquire Farmers without winning approval from each
of the nine states where the insurance company operates.
   But Reich, the Harvard professor, said Americans should not be
worried about foreigners taking over U.S. firms. ``They'd be in the
exact same quandary if (the company) were owned by an American.''
   ``There's no clear difference in the behavior of foreign
companies or American companies,'' he said. ``The mere fact they
fly under a foreign flag doesn't mean the takeover game is played
any meaner.''

   New York developer Donald Trump today made an
unsolicited $7 billion proposal to acquire AMR Corp., the parent of
American Airlines, AMR announced.
   A buyout at the price proposed by Trump, if actually completed,
would be the biggest airline purchase ever.
   American spokesman Al Becker said the company had received a
``unilateral unsolicited letter'' proposing a $120 a share buyout
by Trump, who bought Eastern Airlines' Northeast shuttle service in
March for $365 million.
   After an initial trading delay, AMR stock opened at $107 a share
on the New York Stock Exchange, up sharply from its Wednesday close
of $82.75. The shares had settled back to $104 by early afternoon
in New York.
   News of Trump's move pushed the Dow Jones average of 20
transportation issues up 37.87 points to 1,504.98.
   ``Given the cast of characters, the lack of information right
now, I feel like (Trump's) got a tough row to hoe,'' said Kevin
Burke, who follows the airline industry for First Union Corp., a
bank holding company in Charlotte, N.C.
   Burke said the $120 offer was at the high end of analysts'
estimates of AMR's worth. It also came as a surprise, ``especially
since it was his opening salvo, so to speak. You would think he
would have a few ducks in reserve,'' he said.
   Trump was not immediately available to discuss his offer, and
AMR officials refused to go beyond their early morning statement.
   With 58.9 million outstanding common shares of AMR stock, a $120
a share offer would be worth more than $7 billion.
   The biggest airline buyout ever was an investor group's $3.65
billion purchase of NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines, earlier
this year. A group led by United Airlines pilots and senior
management has offered to buy that carrier's parent, UAL Corp., for
$6.75 billion but the proposal remains pending.
   AMR has been the focus of heated takeover speculation recently
and last week asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to
investigate financial wire reports about takeover rumors.
   Trump's letter stated that his offer was ``subject to the
execution of a mutually satisfactory definitive acquisition
agreement,'' and that Trump believes that ``the financing necessary
for the proposed transaction will be obtained within a reasonable
period of time.''
   AMR's board of directors will consider Trump's offer ``in due
course,'' Becker said from AMR headquarters in Fort Worth.
   Becker stated there has been no change in AMR's policy ``that
AMR and its shareholders will be best served by AMR remaining an
independent company and continuing the strong partnership among
American Airlines, its employees, the communities it serves, and
the public _ a partnership that has given AMR the great success it
enjoys today.''
   AMR also stated that it continues to believe that excess levels
of debt in the airline industry are not in the public interest.
   In August, AMR stock jumped 12 percent as reports circulated
that the company had retained two investment firms to help defend
against any takeover.
   News reports said AMR had retained Salomon Brothers Inc. and
Goldman Sachs and &amp; Co. to advise the Fort Worth-based company, but
AMR would neither confirm nor deny the report.
   AMR, estimated by some analysts to be worth $114 per share in a
takeover, had adopted a shareholders right plan designed to make a
buyout more expensive.
   Within the past year, American has replaced United as the
nation's biggest carrier and has embarked on a multibillion-dollar
expansion program that includes scores of new jets plus a new
maintenance facility and plans for a $1 billion terminal at its
base at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
   AMR posted a profit of $177.9 million, or $2.83 a share, in the
three months ended June 30 on revenue of $2.72 billion. That
compared with a profit of $141.4 million, or $2.36 a share, on
revenue of $2.16 billion in the year earlier period.

<HEAD>Americans Sought for $100 Million Soviet Venture Capital Fund</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIPTON, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet-American working group is seeking
$100 million from U.S. investors for a venture capital fund to
develop high-technology companies in the Soviet Union.
   The American money is being sought by the Soviet Union's
Technology, Innovations, Production Co., which was recently set up
to bypass the cumbersome Soviet bureaucracy and develop new
technologies.
   An agreement to seek money for the fund was signed Wednesday at
a meeting sponsored by the Geonomics Institute, an independent
conference center, institute spokesman George Bellerose said.
   Signers included Nikolai Volkov, the head of the new Soviet
company, and Alexander Belov, an America watcher at the Institute
for the Study of the U.S.A. and Canada. Also signing were Michel
Claudon, head of the Geonomics Institute, and Graham Taylor, a San
Francisco lawyer who is chairman of the working group.
   ``This is the most progressive and effective way to somehow
promote our economic activities,'' Belov said in a telephone
interview Wednesday.
   About a half dozen prominent American venture capitalists
attended the three-day Vermont conference but were not willing to
have their names released because they have not yet decided whether
to commit money to the fund, Bellerose said.
   A small group of Americans, including some venture capitalists,
plan to travel to Moscow in November to review potential investment
projects with the Soviets. A Soviet delegation will visit
Middlebury next spring to continue the work.
   Individual investors would be required to put up a minimum of
$500,000.
   The Soviet government has backed the proposal and is considering
establishing free-trade zones and technology parks in the USSR to
house the joint Soviet-Western companies the international group
hopes will sprout, said Alexander Belov, a Soviet theoretician who
helped develop the plan.
   Plans call for the first new technology park to be built outside
Moscow within two years, he said.
   The plan follows changes in Soviet policy in the last two years
opening the country to Western investment.
   The agreement rose out of three weeks of discussions earlier
this year between a small group of Western and Soviet economists,
government officials and businessmen at the Geonomics Institute,
which is based on the campus of Middlebury College.
   Taylor, who has dealt with the Soviets as a partner in a law
firm involved with international companies, said the Soviets ``blew
my socks off'' by agreeing to the joint venture capital plan so
quickly.
   Accustomed to long delays even in getting letters answered, he
said he was surprised when the Soviets agreed to allow joint
Soviet-Western venture companies set up outside the Soviet Union.
   ``Exporting is the major target'' of the joint venture plan,
said Michael P. Claudon, president of the Geonomics Institute.
   Few joint ventures with Western businesses have succeeded
because of a failing economy and bloated Soviet bureaucracy. The
new approach includes not only joint manufacturing ventures, but
training of Soviet executives by their Western counterparts and
other economic changes.
   The goal is to have one company operating by the end of
December, according to a letter of intent signed by two Americans
and a Soviet delegate to the conference.

   Stock prices turned in a mixed showing today as
a round of increases in European interest rates blunted the rally
that has carried the market to record highs this week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 78 points over
the last three sessions, rose another 4.74 to 2,775.83 by 2 p.m. on
Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading

   The dollar initially declined on the news, reflecting the

   AMR shares jumped 20 to 103| as the most active Big Board issue.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission on
Thursday censured Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. for what it said
were violations of securities laws in several transactions.
   The SEC said Prudential-Bache failed to maintain possession or
control of $218 million worth of securities that were pledged as
collateral in so-called custody repurchase agreements between the
firm and large institutional clients. The total involved 90
security positions and the alleged violations occurred during five
days in late February and early March 1988. Prudential-Bache
settled the charges without admitting or denying guilt.
   Prudential-Bache said in a statement that the alleged violations
did not affect client accounts or the firm's more than $1.3 billion
in capital.
   Prudential-Bache officials said the violations were caused by a
computer programming deficiency that failed to account for the
purchase of the large blocks of securities on the same day.
   Unlike repurchase agreements where securities are physically
delivered in exchange for money, brokerages hold onto the
securities in hold-in-custody pacts. The arrangement typically is
used for overnight or short-term placements of blocks of securities.
   In this case, Prudential-Bache failed to account for the
securities in its records even though it already had paid for them,
officials with the brokerage said.
   Prudential-Bache noted that in the violations ``the difference
in question amounted to approximately one-half of 1 percent of $13
billion in (repurchase) agreements during the five days in
question.''
   Among the charges, the SEC said Prudential-Bache sold and
delivered to a trusteee of a mortgage obligation about 38 security
positions that had been pledged as collateral without substituting
other securities.
   The firm also was charged with several record-keeping violations.
   Prudential-Bache agreed to set up guidelines to comply with SEC
rules and to hire an outside public accountant to evaluate the
firm's policies regarding the hold-in-custody transactions.
   No fine or other penalty was assessed.

<UNK>Dollar Resists European Bank Rate Hikes, Gold Declines</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buying orders pushed the U.S. dollar higher
against most major currencies in hectic European trading late
Thursday after interest rate hikes earlier had forced it down.
   Gold prices fell.
   European central banks, led by the West German Bundesbank,
raised interest rates to combat inflationary pressures, making
their currencies more attractive to investors.
   But the dollar managed to resist and closed higher against all
of them except the British pound.
   The dollar ended the European day at 1.8845 West German marks,
up sharply from its lowest level during the day of 1.8630 marks and
dealers said the quick turnaround reflected the underlying strength
of the American currency.
   It even managed to stave off intervention by the U.S. Federal
Reserve, which sold dollars to try to force the exchange rate
lower, dealers said. The dollar dropped below 1.8800 marks at that
point but not for long.
   One British pound cost $1.6100 in London late Thursday, more
expensive for buyers than Wednesday's late $1.6055 after the Bank
of England raised interest rates by 1 percentage point to 15
percent.
   Other dollar rates in Europe late Thursday compared with
Wednesday's rates, included:
   1.8845 West German marks, up from 1.8770
   1.6365 Swiss francs, up from 1.6275
   6.3900 French francs, up from 6.3700
   2.1200 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1185
   1,380.25 Italian lire, up from 1,373.50
   1.1746 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1742
   Earlier in Tokyo the dollar closed higher at 141.05 Japanese

<HEAD>London Shares Slide as Interest Rates Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices dropped sharply on London's Stock
Exchange Thursday after the Bank of England signaled a 1
percentage-point increase in the commercial banks' base lending
rates to 15 percent.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 30.5
points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 2281.5.
   The British government's decision to raise rates followed the
West German Bundesbank's 1 percentage-point increase in its key
rates.
   Dealers said the further rate rise exacerbated fears that
British corporate profitability could be harmed by Britain's
already high interest rates.
   The Financial Times 30-share index ended 23 points lower at
1,867.2.
   The Financial Times 500-share index ended at 1,273.16, down
19.12 points.
   Volume came to 491.4 million shares, compared with 472.1 million
shares Wednesday.

   Stock prices drifted in a narrow range today as
a round of increases in European interest rates blunted the rally
that has carried the market to record highs this week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 78 points over
the last three sessions, rose another 2.28 to 2,773.37 by 3 p.m. on
Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 662 up, 776 down and
503 unchanged.
   Before the market opened, word flashed across financial news
circuits of a 1 percentage point increase in key West German
interest rates.
   Rate increases were quickly posted in England, France and
several other European countries.
   The dollar initially declined on the news, reflecting the
expectation that higher rates in Europe would attract money away
from U.S. investments, but later recovered.
   Analysts said the increases in Europe did not catch Wall Street
totally by surprise. In addition, analysts said stock traders'
spirits were energized by an offer from investor Donald Trump to
acquire AMR Corp. for $120 a share.
   AMR shares jumped 20\ to 103\ as the most active Big Board
issue. Delta Air Lines, one of the few remaining major carriers
that has not attracted a takeover bid, gained 4\ to 79.
   Microsoft climbed 4{ to 80 in the over-the-counter market on top
of a 6{-point gain Wednesday, when the company said it expects to
report a 34 percent revenue increase for its fiscal first quarter,
ended Sept. 30.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.06 to 198.04. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off .01 at 394.35.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 152.18 million shares with an
hour to go.

<HEAD>Corn Futures Rise On Talk Of New Soviet Buying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn futures prices rose moderately in active
trading Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid rumors of new
Soviet purchases of U.S. corn.
   Soybean futures retreated and wheat futures finished mixed, with
no fresh export sales seen for either of those commodities.
   ``We're in the demand cycle of the markets right now, so where
you're seeing markets being strong it's because there's good
business going on and where you're seeing markets being sloppy or
weak it's because of a lack of regular business,'' said Gerald
Zusel, manager of Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s floor operations at the
Board of Trade.
   The Agriculture Department has confirmed sales of 2.2 million
metric tons of corn to the Soviet Union this week but additional
sales are rumored to have pushed that figure as high as 5 million
metric tons.
   Foreign demand for U.S. grains increases in the fall as newly
harvested supplies come to market.
   At the close, wheat futures were 2} cents lower to 1{ cents
higher with December at $4.10} a bushel; corn was unchanged to 4
cents higher with December at $2.43 a bushel; oats were unchanged
to 1{ cents higher with December at $1.47\ a bushel; soybeans were
3 cents to 5{ cents lower with November at $5.73{ a bushel.

   OPEC and the European Community ended
an era of confrontational tactics Thursday and took the first step
toward closer cooperation between the oil-producing nations and
their European consumers.
   Subroto, secretary-general of the 13-nation Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, met with officials of the trading
bloc in the first such high-level contacts between the two groups.
   The two sides agreed to set up a working group to discuss
possible areas of cooperation, particularly on environmental issues.
   Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the community's top energy official,
said that beginning from ``a very practical basis, we can
progressively go up into the deepest political cooperation.''
   ``The more we can see a clear picture of these things, the
better,'' he told reporters. ``We are in favor of sharing efforts
in that direction.''
   Subroto, the former Indonesian oil minister, said there is a
need for cooperation by the major players in the oil industry.
   ``We feel that the best way is to start from the lower level
among technical groups,'' he said. These contacts, he said, could
then be elevated to higher level, political discussions within a
short period of time.
   He said his visit reflected the end of the 1980s, an era marked
by confrontational attitudes between oil producers and consumers.
   ``We are now entering a new period,'' he said. The 1990s ``opens
the possibilities for cooperation, a period that can prevent the
price shocks (of the past) ... from happening.''
   Cardosa e Cunha said, however, no agreements were reached on
ways to maintain price stability.
   Imports of OPEC crude oil and oil products account for about 53
percent of the domestic oil consumption of the 12-nation community,
also known as the Common Market.
   Later, Subroto told the Royal Institute of International
Relations that the chances were slight of another price shock like
those in 1973 and 1979-80, even if OPEC were to play a more
dominant role in the oil market in the future.
   ``The fear that now exists, mostly among people that are not
very sympathetic to OPEC, is that once a sellers' market will
return, another price shock will happen,'' he said.
   But, he said, ``that is unlikely to happen.''
   Another oil shock, he said, would ``have a devastating effect on
the economies not only of the industrialized countries ... but also
on those of the major producers whose economies to a large extent
respond to stimuli from the industrialized economies.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 469 money market mutual
funds slipped $429.3 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline to $348.94 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday followed a revised $329.0 million increase in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The revision for the previous week meant the funds' assets hit a
record high $349.37 billion in the week ended Sept. 27.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 233 general purpose funds rose $26.5 million to $113.56
billion, assets of 96 broker-dealer funds increased $190.2 million
to $152.26 billion, and assets of 140 institutional funds fell
$646.0 million to $83.11 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.28 percent from 8.26 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield held steady at 8.26 percent, unchanged
from the previous week.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
38 days, up from 37 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
6.42 percent as of Wednesday from 6.44 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, rose to 5.11 percent from 5.10 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.31
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 8.26 percent
the previous week. Yields were 8.35 percent on 1-year CDs, up from
8.31 percent; 8.26 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.24 percent;
and 8.25 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.23 percent.

<HEAD>BMW Freezing or Lowering '90 Prices; Dumping Rebates</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices for 1990 model BMW cars will be
frozen or reduced and the West German automaker's U.S. arm is
ending rebates, a company executive said Thursday.
   The announcement came a day after Volkswagen of America, the
U.S. marketing arm of West Germany's Volkswagen AG, said it was
cutting prices on Volkswagens by an average of 7.5 percent and on
Audis by 8.2 percent and was getting rid of incentives.
   BMW said instead of offering rebates it will give certificates
to owners of BMW 5- and 7-series automobiles, except for the
top-of-the-line 750iL, that are good toward a new BMW.
   Owners of 5-series cars will receive $1,000 certificates and
owners of 7-series automobiles will get certificates worth $2,500.
   BMW officials insisted that the certificates were not rebates or
incentives. They said use of incentives damaged the resale value of
the car.
   No certificates would be issued to owners of 3-series or 750iL
cars. The 1990 prices for them are staying the same as in 1989.
   The certificates apparently were being used in part to soothe
5-and 7-series customers who will see the 1990 prices for their
model cars drop between 4.9 and 9.3 percent from 1989 levels.
   BMW's retail prices for 1990 will range from $24,650 for the
325i two-door to $70,000 for the 750iL.
   Ron Tonkin, president of the National Automobile Dealers
Association, has been campaigning for an end to rebates, saying
they give business owners less freedom in setting their own prices
as they make deals with customers.
   Ford Motor Co. announced a new incentive program for 1990
vehicles, with cash rebates ranging from $500 to $1,250 on a wide
range of cars and trucks or low-interest financing ranging from 6.9
percent to 10.9 percent depending on the term of the loan.
   Also on Thursday:
   _Mercedes-Benz of North America announced that prices for its
1990 cars would increase an average of 2.2 percent, and range from
$31,600 to $83,500.
   _Hyundai Motor America said its 1990 cars would cost an average
of 3.1 percent more than in 1989, ranging from $5,899 to $13,739.
   _Toyota said prices for its Celica line of cars would rise an
average of 0.9 percent in the 1990 model year over 1989 prices, and
range from $12,268 to $16,268.

<HEAD>Dollar Resists Interest-Rate Hikes By European Central Banks</HEAD>

   The dollar took a surprising leap in hectic
trading Thursday, defying efforts by European central banks to
drive the currency lower by raising interest rates.
   The West German central bank led the rate hike, boosting its key
lending rates by 1 percentage point, bringing the discount rate to
6 percent and the Lombard rate to 8 percent. It was quickly matched
by Britain, Austria and the Netherlands. France and Switzerland
announced smaller increases.
   But the dollar, after falling briefly, staged a surprising
reversal against all major currencies except the British pound,
surpassing levels before the interest-rate announcement.
   ``The feeling was that the dollar would take a brief hit, then
buying would come in,'' said William Sterling, manager of
international economics for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. ``But so many
people were waiting to buy on the dip that the dip never got below
1.86 (marks). That's a testimony to the strong demand for dollars
by international investors and corporations.''
   In Europe, the dollar closed at 1.8845 West German marks, up
from 1.8770. In New York, the dollar traded at 1.8848 West German
marks, higher than 1.8815 on Wednesday.
   The dollar closed at 141.05 Japanese yen in Tokyo, up from
140.60 yen. In London, the currency traded at 142.30 yen compared
with 141.05 on Wednesday. In New York, the dollar rose to 142.55,
up from 141.475.
   But in London, one British pound cost $1.6100, more for buyers
than Wednesday's late $1.6055 after the Bank of England raised
interest rates by 1 percentage point to 15 percent. In New York
trading the pound changed hands at $1.6115, more expensive than
$1.6020 late Wednesday.
   Analysts said the interest-rate hikes were intended as the
second phase of a two-part effort by industrialized countries to
push the dollar lower and stem inflationary pressures, making their
currencies more attractive to investors.
   The first step began last week with central banks selling
dollars in a coordinated effort following a meeting of the Group of
Seven industrialized nations. But the currency repeatedly defied
central bank intervention.
   Earlier in the week analysts concluded that currency markets had
prepared for a half-point rise and that a steeper hike would zap
the dollar's strength.
   All seven nations, including the United States, Britain, Japan,
France, West Germany, Italy and Canada, have ample reason to want
the dollar lower.
   ``The worry is that the strong dollar will hurt U.S. economic
growth in 1990 and hurt the industrial and export sectors,'' said
Allen Sinai, an economist with Boston Co. and Economic Advisers
Inc. ``In Japan and West German even bigger doses of interest rates
will be required because of the inflationary effects of weaker
currencies.''
   The dollar's strength despite the interest-rate hike calls into
question the Group of Seven's ability to mount a coordinated
effort, economists said.
   ``The perception is that each major group is conducting interest
rate policy with an eye on its own domestic conditions and that the
credibility of G-7 coordination is still lacking,'' said Sterling.
   Analysts said that while intervention is expected to continue,
to weaken the dollar will require: adverse news about the trade
deficit, more interest rate hikes or fiscal restraint overseas, or
lower short-term interest rates.
   New data on employment is due out on Friday, but barring any
strong suggestions that the U.S. economy is slowing, the Federal
Reserve is not likely to lower interest rates.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6360 Swiss francs, up from 1.6290;
1.17625 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17475; 6.3865 French francs, up
from 6.3825; and 1,380.00 Italian lire, up from 1,376.75.
   Dollar rates in Europe late Thursday compared with Wednesday's
rates, included: 1.6365 Swiss francs, up from 1.6275; 6.3900 French
francs, up from 6.3700; 2.1200 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1185;
1,380.25 Italian lire, up from 1,373.50; 1.1746 Canadian dollars,
up from 1.1742.
   Gold, meanwhile, declined because of the dollar's surge.
   In London, gold closed at a bid price of $365.00 a troy ounce,
down from $366.25 late Wednesday. The Zurich late bid price was
$364.75, down from $366.00. It closed at at $367.05 bid in Hong
Kong, up from $366.25.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $363.40 an ounce, down $3.60 from Wednesday.
Republic National bank of New York said gold was bid late in the
day at $363.10 an ounce, down from $366 on Wednesday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $5.27 a troy
ounce, up from Wednesday's $5.24.
   On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled
at $5.166 an ounce, down from $5.248 on Wednesday.

   Oil futures prices fell Thursday, as gasoline
and heating oil futures extended their steep decline.
   The November contract for home heating oil traded on the New
York Mercantile Exchange tumbled 1.08 cents a gallon to close at
57.91 cents. Subsequent months also lost ground, with the December
contract falling 1.13 cents a gallon to 58.33 cents.
   Gasoline futures contracts traded on the exchange also fell. The
November contract for unleaded gasoline was down 0.44 cent a gallon
at 54.97 cents. Subsequent months also retreated.
   Gasoline futures started to drop Wednesday after the American
Petroleum Institute said nationwide inventories had risen by 4.5
million barrels last week.
   The API report released late Tuesday showed total U.S. gasoline
stocks at 223.7 million barrels for the week ending last Friday.
   The trend continued in Thursday's trading, analysts said.
   ``The products have really taken a nosedive,'' said Bill Hamlen,
a vice president of energy futures trading at Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. ``The bottom line is there's quite a lot of gasoline
around.''
   Crude oil futures also declined. The November contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, slipped 19
cents to close at $19.96 per 42-gallon barrel on the mercantile
exchange.

<HEAD>M2 Rises; M3 Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the broadest measures of the nation's
money supply rose in the week ended Sept. 25 and another fell, the
Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,158.9 billion from $3,157.9 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$4,010.0 billion from $4,017.4 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $782.4 billion from $780.5 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 3.8 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.3 percent, which is below the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,133.0 billion, a 7.0
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,007.3 billion, up 4.7 percent, while M1
rose 1.2 percent to an average of $778.1 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and

<HEAD>Precious Metals Futures Slump As Dollar Surges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Precious metals futures prices slumped Thursday in a
disappointed reaction to the dollar's late surge in value against
other major currencies following a rise in European interest rates.
   On other commodity markets, energy futures retreated, coffee
futures fell again, grains and soybeans were mixed and livestock
and meat were mixed.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled $3.60
lower across the board with the contract for delivery in October at
$363.40 a troy ounce; silver was 8.2 cents to 9.3 cents lower with
December at $5.243 a troy ounce.
   The slide marked the biggest daily move in gold prices since
Sept. 25, but the market did not fall out of its recent trading
range.
   The metals closely followed foreign currencies, which rallied in
relation to the dollar early in the day only to end lower as the
dollar advanced.
   The early rally was kicked off by West Germany's decision to
raise its key interest rate a full percentage point, forcing other
European countries to follow suit.
   The Federal Reserve did not move to raise U.S. interest rates
but the dollar strengthened anyway, challenging the Fed to take the
opposite course and loosen up credit.
   ``The only way to keep the dollar from rallying further would be
to lower rates here in the states,'' said Peter Cardillo, commodity
trading adviser with Josephthal &amp; Co., a New York-based futures
brokerage.
   Heating-oil futures fell sharply and most other energy futures
also declined on the New York Mercantile Exchange, partly in
reaction to a pair of reports indicating ample supplies of crude
oil and refined products.
   The Department of Energy's weekly inventory report showed
larger-than-expected increases in U.S. stocks of crude oil and
gasoline, and a monthly report from the International Energy Agency
showed OPEC nations producing crude oil at levels well above the
20.5 million-barrel ceiling set by cartel officials just last month.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 19 cents lower to 1
cent higher with November at $19.96 a barrel; heating oil was .45
cent to 1.13 cent lower with November at 57.91 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .44 cent to .57 cent lower with November at
54.97 cents a gallon.
   Coffee futures dropped to new 14-year lows on New York's Coffee,
Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange but losses were limited by signs that
International Coffee Organization negotiators were making some
progress toward a new price-support agreement to succeed the export
quotas suspended in July.
   Late in the day, after the close, the ICO's governing council
passed a resolution to negotiate a new pact but details were not
available.
   Coffee futures settled .14 cent to 1.25 cents lower with
December at 72.89 cents a pound.
   Corn futures prices rose moderately in active trading on the
Chicago Board of Trade amid rumors of new Soviet purchases of U.S.
corn.
   Soybean futures retreated and wheat futures finished mixed, with
no fresh export sales seen for either of those commodities.
   Wheat futures settled 2{ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with
December at $4.10} a bushel; corn was unchanged to 4\ cents higher
with December at $2.43\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1{ cents
higher with December at $1.47\ a bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents to
5{ cents lower with November at $5.74 a bushel.
   Hog futures rose sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on
expectations for higher cash prices. The rally lifted pork-belly
futures and near-month live cattle futures but feeder cattle
retreated slightly.
   Live cattle settled .25 cent lower to .25 cent higher with
October at 71.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .32
cent lower with October at 83.12 cents a pound; hogs were .07 cent
to .80 cent higher with October at 45.57 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .23 cent to .48 cent higher with February at 48.47
cents a pound.

<HEAD>Is the Sales Boom Over?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Automakers and analysts are wondering if the 1989
model year was the last of the recent car and truck sales
explosions of recent years.
   About 78 million new vehicles _ one for every 3.1 people in the
United States _ have been put on the road in the last five model
years. But if sales reach the 14 million-15 million range predicted
for the 1990 model year come true, that sales boom could end.
   ``I'd say there is a lot of uncertainty out there,'' said
analyst Mike Kobayashi of PaineWebber in New York City. ``At this
point, we're looking at 14 million (for 1990), but we may be
changing that soon.''
   He declined to say whether his firm's revision would be up or
down.
   Automakers on Wednesday reported selling around 15.1 million
cars and light trucks during the 1989 model year ended last
Saturday. When heavy truck sales figures are added later this year,
it probably will push total sales to around 15.4 million, the
fifth-best model year on record.
   That would be slightly better than many automakers and observers
had predicted. Some of them are concerned that a surge in September
sales may have been fueled largely by consumers wanting to beat
1990 model year price increases.
   Analysts, economists and auto company executives were waiting to
see this year's fourth-quarter sales rate before making firmer
predictions for the next year.
   Ford Motor Co. is withholding any prediction for 1990 sales
until fourth-quarter results are clearer, company Chairman Donald
Petersen said in an interview Thursday.
   ``The quarter could be a relatively slow quarter,'' he said.
``The basic economy is showing some growth, you might call it
modest growth.''
   Petersen said one reasons for the marketplace uncertainty is
buyer incentives. Ford announced a new set of cash rebates and
low-interest loan rates on a variety of 1989 and 1990 cars and
trucks.
   General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. also have announced
incentives on some of their 1990 cars and trucks.
   ``You still have the fact of the excess capacity. That injects
an element of instability into the equation and a strong element of
unknown,'' Petersen said. ``The ingredients are there for some
instability as far as the market is concerned.''
   Auto assembly plants that operate at full capacity are the most
profitable, so automakers like to keep production as high as
possible. But some dealers and the National Automobile Dealers
Association have said they expected dealer orders to drop by as
much as 30 percent in 1990 from 1989.
   That could spell trouble for the automakers, not only because
orders from dealers may be down but also because factories may not
be working at their optimum capacity.
   ``It's really hard to figure out what the Big Three are trying
to do,'' Kobayashi said. ``They haven't geared up their production
for the fourth quarter to match the sales they've been having in
the third quarter.
   ``So that's sort of an admission that we should wait to see how
the 1990 model year kicks off,'' he said.
   Officially, model years begin with the fourth quarter of a
calendar year and end with the third quarter of the next year.
   Tom Webb, a senior economist with the NADA, on Thursday
predicted a 10 percent drop in fourth-quarter car sales this year
compared with last year.
   That would put 1989 calendar year sales at 14.7 million
vehicles, he said, far below the 15.8 million sold during the 1988
calendar year, the industry's second-best.
   ``We're not predicting any recession, we're projecting a slower
(economic) growth than this year,'' Webb said.

   Stock prices hovered in a narrow range Thursday
as a round of increases in European interest rates blunted the
rally that has carried the market to record highs this week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.47 to 2,773.56,
hitting a new high for the third straight session.
   Since the start of the week the average has climbed 80.74 points.
   Advancing issues and declines were evenly balanced in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 741 up, 743
down and 494 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 177.89 million
shares, down from 194.59 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 213.91 million shares.
   Before the market opened, word flashed across financial news
circuits of a 1 percentage point increase in key West German
interest rates.
   Rate increases were quickly posted in England, France and
several other European countries.
   The dollar initially declined on the news, reflecting the
expectation that higher rates in Europe would attract money away
from U.S. investments. But later rebounded in foreign-exchange
dealings.
   Analysts said the increases in Europe did not catch Wall Street
totally by surprise. In addition, analysts said stock traders'
spirits were energized by an offer from investor Donald Trump to
acquire AMR Corp. for $120 a share.
   AMR shares jumped 16~ to 99~ as the most active Big Board issue.
Delta Air Lines, one of the few remaining major carriers that has
not attracted a takeover bid, gained 3{ to 78\.
   The demand for those stocks helped send the Dow Jones average of
20 transportation issues up 31.65 to 1,498.75.
   Paramount Communications, another prime focus of takeover rumors
and speculation, rose 3} to 62.
   Gainers among the blue-chip industrials included Philip Morris,
up 3} at 175; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up \ at 45; Chevron,
up 1~ at 64}, and Eli Lilly, up ] at 65.
   National Education dropped | to 12. The company said it expected
to post a loss for the third quarter, and looks for fourth-quarter
revenues down significantly from the like period last year.
   Microsoft climbed 3} to 79\ in the over-the-counter market on
top of a 6{-point gain Wednesday, when the company said it expects
to report a 34 percent revenue increase for its fiscal first
quarter, ended Sept. 30.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $2.42 billion, or 0.07
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .07 to 198.05.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index slipped .06 to 406.98, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up .03 at 356.97.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
1.34 to 480.66. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 394.43, up .07.

<HEAD>Goldsmith Reaffirms Bid for BAT, Changes Strategies</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 3 grafs to CORRECT style of Farmers Group and to
ADD that ownership of Farmers also would pass through voting trust.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir James Goldsmith reaffirmed his hostile
bid for BAT Industries PLC Thursday, saying he will make a new
offer if regulators in nine states approve the sale of BAT's
Farmers Group insurance subsidiary as part of the deal.
   Trading in BAT shares was halted on the American Stock Exchange
because of huge demand by speculators assuming that Goldsmith's $22
billion bid, the second biggest takeover offer ever, would be
sweetened.
   Goldsmith suggested the deal will be changed so that Farmers
would be sold directly to the French insurer Axa-Midi Assurances,
rather than passing briefly through the ownership of Goldsmith's
Hoylake Investments Ltd. and a voting trust.
   Officials also suggested that changes will be made in how
Axa-Midi finances its $4.5 billion purchase of Los Angeles-based
Farmers, the 15th biggest U.S. insurer. BAT contends the current
offer relies too heavily on borrowed money and repayments from
Farmers' operating income.
   The financing and ownership issues are big ones for regulators
who must decide if the deal is in the best interests of Farmers
policyholders.
   Goldsmith's statement also dispelled suspicions that he would
give up following BAT's announcement last week that it would
restructure by selling its paper and retailing businesses to
concentrate on tobacco and financial services.
   ``It appears as if Goldsmith is once again threatening to make a
real offer,'' BAT said in a statement. ``If and when one is made we
will respond in the appropriate manner and in due course.''
   In another important change of strategy, Goldsmith said he would
drop his lawsuits contending that state insurance regulators have
no right to review the deal. Federal courts in seven of the nine
states already had ruled against him down on those suits.
   Axa-Midi has only one small U.S. business, a Delaware insurer.
Critics say Axa is too inexperienced in the American market. They
also contend that nearly all the $4.5 billion purchase price for
Farmers would be borrowed or repaid from Farmers' profits, causing
a heavy burden.
   Axa-Midi Chairman Claude Bebear said in a statement that
Axa-Midi would file amended applications with the nine insurance
commissioners to demonstrate its strength and experience. A person
with knowledge of the deal, who asked not to be identified, said
the amended applications would include revised financing, but would
not describe it in detail.
   BAT called Goldsmith's decision to drop his federal lawsuits ``a
clear admission of defeat and one which will enable the focus to
shift to the true issues _ whether Hoylake or its highly leveraged
partner, Axa-Midi, are suitable owners for Farmers.''

<HEAD>Steelworkers Vote To Buy LTV Bar Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union employees of LTV Steel Co.'s bar steel
division voted Thursday to buy the division for $20 million, a deal
that will create the second-largest employee-owned steel company in
the United States.
   The vote by United Steelworkers of America members authorizes
each union employee to pay an average of $4,000 to purchase stock
in the new company, Republic Engineered Steels Corp. The payments
go toward a down payment to the division's parent company, LTV
Corp. of Dallas, said company spokesman John Willoughby.
   Under the buyout plan, 3,900 union members will pay $16 million
while 1,050 salaried management employees will contribute $4
million. Union members will hold 76 percent of the stock in the new
company while management will hold 24 percent.
   The vote was 2,252 to 1,184.
   ``This is a historic day and (an) extraordinary opportunity for
our members,'' said Joe Coyle, USW director of District 27 in
Canton and chairman of the union negotiating team.
   It will be the 16th employee stock ownership plan in which USW
members have a majority or complete ownership of a company, Coyle
said.
   The company will be directed by a 13-member board of directors
with four representatives from the union, four from management and
five indepdendent directors selected by the union and management.
   ``Certainly the ESOP enhances our ability to implement a
modernization plan,'' Willoughby said. ``This is the ultimate
employee-participation plan.''
   He said Republic Engineered Steels Corp. will include two LTV
plants in Canton, two in Massillon, Ohio, and plants in Chicago,
Gary, Ind., Beaver Falls, Pa., and Willimantic, Conn.
   The division had sales of $800 million in 1988 and will maintain
its headquarters in Massillon, Willoughby said.
   The $20 million employee buyout is second largest in the U.S.
steel industry to the 1982 buyout of West Virginia's Weirton Steel
Corp., in which 8,300 employees paid $194 million to buy the
company.
   LTV Corp. filed for reorganization in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
1986. Selling the bar division will leave LTV with flat-rolled and
tubular products plants, Willoughby said.
   Presidents of the four largest USW locals had opposed the
buyout, partly because some employees will eventually lose their
jobs in the seven-year plan, while five union local presidents
favored it.
   Willoughby said management of the company would remain the same.

<TEXT>
   As if Boeing Co. didn't have enough trouble with
a strike by machinists, state and federal officials on Thursday
announced citations or fines for alleged safety and health
violations by the aerospace company.
   The state Department of Labor and Industries said it penalized
Boeing $128,780 for 36 alleged violations. It is the largest
penalty ever proposed against a Washington employer under the
Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act.
   Also Thursday, the federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration announced citations for 40 violations that carry
penalties totaling $41,530.
   The citations were primarily focused on Boeing Advanced Systems
operations at the Developmental Center in Seattle, where parts for
the B-2 bomber are made, and follow nearly five months of joint
investigation by state and federal agencies.
   ``Our inspection at The Boeing Co. found substantial problems
that need to be corrected, and our penalty structure allows us to
make employers aware of the importance we place on the safety and
health of workers,'' Labor and Industries Director Joe Dear said.
   Boeing spokesman John Kvasnosky said the company was ``in the
process of reviewing the citations and can't say at this time if
there will be an appeal or any further action.''
   ``Since the inspections occurred, we have made the corrections
needed to meet some of those concerns and no further action is
contemplated. We have given the inspectors a timetable for taking
corrective actions on the remaining concerns,'' said Kvasnosky.
   Of the state's 36 alleged violations, 19 were related to safety
and 17 to hygiene. Many involved lack of hazardous chemical
information and training programs and employee exposure to
hazardous chemicals.
   The federal citations included 22 for alleged safety violations
such as unsafe machinery operation, improper communication between
equipment operators, improper record keeping of injuries and
illnesses, unsafe physical working conditions and improper uses of
equipment.

   International Coffee Organization producers and
consumers late Thursday reaffirmed their commitment to renewed
action to support depressed prices.
   They also agreed on the need for what officials described as
``intensive consultations'' to establish a new accord to achieve
this goal.
   No timetable was set for these consultations, which will
initially take place outside the coffee organization, said the
chief U.S. negotiator, James Murphy.
   He said there was a ``new cooperative spirit'' between producing
and consuming nations and that he thought the two sides would
succeed in achieving a new pact to regulate the market.
   Coffee prices have collapsed to a 14-year low since regulation
ended July 4.

   A private rocket went
up in flames during a launch attempt Thursday, ruining the first
American booster designed and built solely with commercial funds,
officials said.
   ``Once the flames came out of the rocket, we kept waiting for it
to lift off and didn't see it leave the pad,'' said Bob Angelotti,
a spokesman for American Rocket Co.
   ``People were saying, `It didn't take off! It didn't take
off,''' he said. ``Then flame and black smoke began to come out of
the bottom of the rocket cylinder.''
   The 58-foot-tall rocket was to have taken a 15-minute suborbital
flight to test Star Wars missile detectors on a satellite orbiting
overhead, and to test a heat shield-parachute that might be used on
a re-entry vehicle to help astronauts escape a space station
emergency.
   The company said the rocket fell off the launch stand a few
minutes after it fizzled and burned.
   The 58-foot-tall rocket was to have taken a 15-minute suborbital
flight to test Star Wars missile detectors on a satellite orbiting
overhead.
   Thursday's failed launch was another blow to the Camarillo-based
company. Its founder, George Koopman, died in an automobile
accident July 19 while driving to a rocket test at Edwards Air
Force Base. Koopman said earlier he wanted American Rocket ``to be
the Federal Express of the space business.''
   American Rocket said its booster, dubbed the ``Koopman
Express,'' was the first in the United States designed and built
only with commercial funds, without any government subsidy or
surplus parts. Rockets used in other commercial launches this year
were built under government programs although later sold for
commercial use, according to the company.
   ``This is the rocket business, and this is why you do test
flights,'' said Jim Bennett, president of American Rocket. ``It's
not at all uncommon for your first prototype to have a problem like
this. We'll be investigating and learning from it and go on.''
   He said it probably will be next year before his company
attempts another launch. The company estimated this one cost $2
million.
   The launch had been scheduled during a two-minute window
beginning at 10:28 a.m. PDT, but ``we lighted it up, and for one
reason or the other it didn't lift off,'' Bennett said.
   ``So we ordered the release clamps re-engaged and went into our
scrub procedure, but the vehicle caught on fire. ... The Air Force
says there was minimal pad damage. ... But the vehicle is
non-flyable.''
   The launch first had been planned Sept. 28, but was scrubbed by
clouds and fear that lightning might hit the 33,400-pound rocket,
which is powered by a hybrid engine that runs on a combination of
liquid oxygen and a solid fuel of polybutadiene rubber.
   Thursday's launch was scheduled so the rocket could release a
cloud of inert gas as the Pentagon's Delta Star satellite passed
overhead.
   The satellite, launched from in March, contains sensors that
some day may be part of a Strategic Defense Initiative system _
nicknamed Star Wars _ in which satellites would detect incoming
enemy nuclear warheads so they could be destroyed.
   Defense Department spokesman Maj. William O'Connell said earlier
that the Pentagon would not reveal whether the sensors detected the
American Rocket booster.
   The rocket also was scheduled to deploy an engineering test
model of an 8{-foot-wide ParaShield. It is a combined heat shield
and parachute that some day might be used in a new type of re-entry
vehicle, such as an escape system to allow space station astronauts
to return to Earth. The 390-pound model was built by students at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

   Amoco Corp. is exploring the possibility of
building a petrochemical plant with Saudi Arabia.
   The Chicago-based oil company has signed a letter of intent to
study the idea of building a plant that annually would produce up
to 400,000 metric tons of a chemical used in making polyester. It
would anticipate demand into the late 1990s, said James Fligg of
Amoco.
   The plant would be a joint venture with Saudi Chemical
Investments Ltd. and private Saudi investors.
