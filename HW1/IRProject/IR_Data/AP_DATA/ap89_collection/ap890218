   A state legislative election today between a
former Ku Klux Klan leader and a Republican backed by former
President Reagan and President Bush has focused international
attention on a New Orleans suburb.
   Poll commissioners reported a good turnout early today, and a
registrar predicted a record number of voters would cast their
ballots in the race between former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David
Duke and his opponent, John Treen.
   For nearly a month Duke, 38, and Treen, 63, have campaigned to
represent the legislative district in Metairie, a nearly all-white
suburb with about 21,000 voters.
   The most recent polls, conducted last week, indicated the men
were neck and neck. An unusually large number of voters would not
reveal their candidate of choice, pollster Joe Walker said.
   ``I've never seen anything like this in my life. I'm 70 years
old,'' said Jefferson Parish Registrar Sam Altobello. ``We should
have a hell of a turnout.''
   Voter registration ended more than three weeks ago, but Altobello
said even people outside the district have called to ask if they can
register.
   ``They all want to vote for one man,'' Altobello said. ``One lady
called yesterday and said, `If I can't vote for him, I'm going to
pray for him.' I know who's going to win, but I'm not going to say.''
   Altobello said a record 80 percent of voters could end up at the
polls. The 1988 presidential race drew 77 percent. Polls open at 6
a.m. and close at 8 p.m.
   Of the 21,457 people eligible to vote, 52 are black, 76 are
registered as ``other'' and the rest _ more than 99 percent _ are
white, he said.
   Duke led a field of seven candidates with 33 percent of the vote
in the Jan. 21 primary. Treen had 19 percent.
   Both men are running as Republicans, which drew the Republican
National Committee into the campaign because it feared a Duke
victory would harm the GOP's image.
   In an unprecedented move for a local race, President Bush and
former President Reagan endorsed Treen earlier this week while
neither mentioned Duke.
   The race also attracted international attention, with reporters
from British, Dutch, French, West German and other foreign
newspapers covering the election.
   Duke's candidacy ``seems to confirm everyone's perception about
the South. We're going to look into it to see if that's true,'' said
John Cassidy, chief American correspondent for the Sunday Times of
London.
   Under Louisiana's open primary system, the top two vote-getters
in a primary, regardless of party, face each other in the runoff.
The seat opened when Metairie's representative was elected to a
judgeship.
   Duke, who ran as a Democrat in the 1988 presidential primary,
switched his registration a few days before qualifying for the House
race. Treen is a longtime Republican, whose brother, Dave, served
from 1980 to 1984 as Louisiana governor.
   Duke left the Klan in 1980, when another KKK leader accused him
of selling secret membership rolls. He then started the National
Association for the Advancement of White People, which Duke says
works for civil rights for everyone.
   On Friday, Duke spent the final hours before the election
defending himself against accusations that he is still an associate
of right-wing extremists.
   ``He's spreading Nazi venom across the United States,'' Treen
said.
   ``Not only am I not a Nazi, but I condemn any sort of
totalitarianism,'' Duke said. ``I repudiate anybody or any group
that advocates racial hatred or violence against anyone.''
   Former American Nazi leader Ralph P. Forbes was hired to manage
Duke's Populist Party presidential campaign in 1988 and was paid at
least $22,000 for his work, according to campaign finance reports
quoted in Friday's editions of The Times-Picayune newspaper.
   ``The Ralph Forbes factor in this election is only the tip of the
iceberg,'' said Treen.

   Britain recommended today that all airlines using
its airports examine passenger's electrical and electronic
equipment, following the announcement that a bomb hidden in a
radio-cassette player destroyed Pan Am Flight 103.
   British Airways, the country's largest airline, immediately
started checking radios, portable computers, cassette players and
other equipment being checked in, said an airline spokesman, who by
custom is not identified by name.
   The Department of Transport said it sent a directive outlining
the suggestion to all airlines operating in Britain on Friday, a day
after investigators said they believe the cassette-player bomb was
in hold baggage.
   Passengers at British Airways counters today were asked to take
all electrical and electronic equipment out of their suitcases for a
separate security check, the airline spokesman said.
   Afterward, passengers were asked to carry them aboard the plane
as hand baggage, he said.
   A Department of Transport spokesman said the directive did not
recommend how the items should be carried on the plane once they
were cleared.
   He said the directive was aimed mainly at battery-operated
transistor radios, lap-top computers and cassette recorders, where
explosives could be hidden, rather than smaller items such as hair
dryers. But the final decision on what should be checked would be
left to the airline, he said.
   At this week's meeting in Montreal of the International Civil
Aviation Organization's governing council, British Transport
Secretary Paul Channon outlined an eight-point program to increase
airline security, including checks on electrical equipment, the
spokesman said.
   The aviation organization unanimously adopted a resolution
calling for a worldwide tightening of security, including possible
restrictions on carrying electrical and electronic devices on planes.
   The Montreal meeting was requested by Channon and U.S.
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner to consider international
responses to the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. All 259
people aboard the New York-bound Boeing 747 were killed along with
11 people in the Scottish town of Lockerbie, where much of the
wreckage fell.
   While the council was meeting, the detective heading the
international investigation into the Pan Am crash, Detective Chief
Superintendent John Orr, told a news conference Thursday that the
bomb had been planted in a radio-cassette player checked as baggage.
   Anti-terrorist experts have said the explosive most likely used
was Semtex, an odorless, highly malleable substance made in
Czechoslovakia.
   Orr said there was insufficient evidence to pinpoint the identity
of the person or group responsible for planting the bomb.

   A woman who won a piano once owned by the
Beatles' John Lennon is offering to sell the ebony Steinway for
$500,000.
   Sandy Dejoras said she decided to sell the piano, which she won
in a 1985 record promotion contest, after her husband died last
summer.
   She said she's received a number of offers since she advertised
in the current issue of Rolling Stone magazine.
   ``I understand the prospective bidders have included many famous
people, but so far no one has been able to get the money together,''
Ms. Dejoras said.
   Lennon was gunned down outside his New York City apartment in
1980.

   Trade negotiators from the United States and
Europe expressed optimism today that they would be able to reach a
compromise agreement to cool a seven-week trade war that has erupted
over the issue of U.S. beef which contains growth hormones.
   The Bush administration is anxious to defuse the conflict before
it aggravates other political strains between America and the
12-nation European Community. European officials have expressed a
desire as well to settle the dispute, which has resulted in a total
ban on shipments of U.S. beef to Europe.
   Frans Andriessen, the top trade negotiator for the European
Community, told reporters today that he hoped a compromise solution
could be reached.
   ``It is always fluid as long as it is not frozen,'' Andriessen
said in explaining both sides' negotiating positions before the
talks resumed today.
   The discussions had begun with a working dinner last night hosted
by Ambassador Roy Denman, the European Community's representative to
the United States.
   New U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills and Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who had served as America's top trade
negotiator during the Reagan administration, were leading the U.S.
negotiating team.
   Also taking part in the discussions today was Ray MacSharry,
formerly Ireland's finance minister and now the European Community's
commissioner in charge of agriculture.
   American beef has been banned in Europe since Jan. 1 because of a
prohibition which took effect then against hormone-treated meat.
   The Reagan administration retaliated immediately with trade
sanctions imposed on $100 million worth of European food products,
ranging from canned tomatoes to instant coffee and boneless beef.
   The 100 percent U.S. tariffs, totaling $100 million, roughly
equaled the estimated sales of American meat products that were lost
under the European ban.
   Officials are seeking to defuse the dispute before new
counter-retaliation measures are taken by the Europeans, who have
threatened to approve on Monday 100 percent duties against $100
million of American exports of walnuts and dried fruit.
   Bush, referring to the dispute in his first address to Congress,
said last week that the major industrial countries needed ``to rise
above fighting about beef hormones to building a better future, to
move from protectionism to progress.''
   The U.S. position has been that the hormones, which are fed to
cattle to increase their bulk, do not pose any health threats. But
apparently the new administration is willing to reach an accord with
the Europeans so that the dispute does not escalate into a bigger
battle with one of America's biggest trading partners.
   The United States is pushing for establishment of a scientific
panel under international trade rules in the hopes of showing that
hormone-treated American meat is safe.
   In return, U.S. officials may go along with a certification
program that would allow hormone-free American beef to be sold in
Europe. Such a proposal has been advanced by Texas Agriculture
Commissioner Jim Hightower.
   The Texas plan would involve isolating untreated cattle from
birth through slaughter, giving them tests for artificial hormones
and establishing enforcement procedures. Texas officials say that
similar programs meeting European standards have been proposed by
Brazil and New Zealand.

   More than 100 blacks detained
without charge remained on a hunger strike today, attorneys said,
and a human rights group claimed that police have detained more
people.
   In Johannesburg today, 300 blacks chanted, sang songs and danced
as they waved placards and handed out leaflets demanding the release
of all detainees.
   About 300 detainees, many held since a state of emergency was
declared 1986, began a hunger strike three weeks ago demanding they
be freed or tried.
   More than 20 were hospitalized, prompting Law and Order Minister
Adriaan Vlok to meet with lawyers, clergymen and relatives of
detainees during the week, for the first time getting information
other than that supplied by his policemen on why certain people are
considered a danger to the community.
   Vlok said he would free a ``substantial'' number of detainees in
the next two weeks. He said most of those on hunger strike _ at
least 275 _ suspended their protest Thursday and Friday.
   But attorneys for more than 123 detainees held in Westville
Prison in Durban and about 30 in East London's Fort Glamorgan prison
said their clients still are fasting. Those fasts began during the
past week, and the attorneys were not in the groups that met Vlok.
Police also confirmed that some detainees at Fort Glamorgan were on
a hunger strike.
   A spokesman for Vlok, Brig. Leon Mellett, was quoted today by The
Citizen, a pro-government newspaper, as saying: ``As far as I am
concerned, the matter of the hunger strike and the detainees
involved is now something of the past and I'm not prepared to say
anymore.''
   However, a Johannesburg group called the Human Rights Commission
said today, ``The hunger strike continues at prisons around the
country. This highlights the fact that the detention crisis is not
over _ even this week more people have been detained under the state
of emergency.'' It gave no figure for new detainees.
   Vlok has said people are released and detained every day.
Monitoring groups say more than 30,000 people, almost all black,
have been held at some time during the two years and eight months of
the emergency.
   Vlok told Parliament on Friday that on Jan. 9 there were 884
detainees who had been held at least 30 days. He is required by law
to make periodic reports to Parliament, but he never gives
up-to-date figures. Last week he said there were less than 1,000
detainees.
   In the past week, at least 30 people have been freed from
detention, some of them hunger strikers. Officials did not say how
many new detentions occurred.
   In downtown Johannesburg today, about 300 blacks chanted, sang
songs and danced as they waved placards and handed out leaflets
calling for the release of all detainees.

   Author Salman Rushdie, facing calls for his death
and a multimillion-dollar bounty for the killer, today apologized to
Moslems for the distress caused by the publication of his novel
``The Satanic Verses.''
   However, the official Iranian news agency said the author had
failed to repent or order that his book be withdrawn. A Moslem
leader in Britain welcomed the apology but said the campaign against
the book would continue.
   In a statement issued by his agent, Rushdie said: ``I profoundly
regret the distress that publication has occasioned to sincere
followers of Islam.''
   ``Living as we do in a world of many faiths this experience has
served to remind us that we must all be conscious of the
sensibilities of others.''
   The brief statement was also issued to Iran's Islamic Republic
News Agency, and a story was sent to Iran, a spokesman for the
agency said.
   Rushdie apologized after his book was banned in six countries and
removed from the shelves of major bookstores in the United States.
   The author's statement came a day after Iran's president, Ali
Khamenei, said the Indian-born Briton could save his life with an
apology.
   Iran's news agency noted the apology but said Rushdie's statement
``made no indication of his repentence or that his slanderous book
would be withdrawn.''
   IRNA, monitored in London, said Rushdie, who was raised in a
Moslem family, has been ``under growing pressure to make a public
repentence that his statement is seen falling well short of.''
   Two prominent Moslems condemned the Iranian campaign against the
author, which began Tuesday when Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini said ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam and demanded
zealous Moslems kill Rushdie. Two Iranian religious leaders later
offered a $5.2 million bounty for Rushdie.
   The Times of London today reported that a power struggle may have
prompted Khomeini's execution order, which sent Rushdie, 41, and his
American wife into hiding under the guard of Scotland Yard
detectives.
   The British Foreign Office said on Friday that ``considerable
confusion persists'' within the Iranian government and that Britain
``intended to proceed with that fact in mind.'' It did not elaborate.
   Moslems condemned ``The Satanic Verses'' when it was published
late last year to critical acclaim in the West.
   Another round of protests began Sunday with demonstrations in
Pakistan, where six people died. The protests spread and another
person was killed and 75 people injured in a series of
demonstrations in India.
   After Khomeini also ordered the death of publishers of the novel,
book companies in France, West Germany, Greece and Turkey decided
not to publish it. Others in Finland, Norway and Italy were unswayed.
   Major U.S. booksellers such as B. Dalton and Barnes &amp; Nobel
removed the novel from their shelves, and Canada halted imports. The
book has been officially banned in Iran, India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Egypt and South Africa.
   The governments of West Germany, Spain, Britain and the United
States condemned the Iranian compaign. The United States called it
``appalling.''
   The Times of London quoted ``a closely involved source'' as
saying Khomeini's son Ahmad and three hard-line ministers may have
persuaded the 88-year-old spiritual leader to make the death call to
undermine a political rival seeking improved relations with Britain.
   The report said supporters of Iran's parliament speaker, Hashemi
Rafsanjani, believe Khomeini's son and the government ministers
hoped the death call would deal a blow to British relations and
Rafsanjani.
   Some diplomats in the Middle East have speculated the Rushdie
issue was promoted by factions in Iran opposed to recent moves by
more pragmatic figures, including Rafsanjani, to improve relations
with the West.
   But Akhoond Zadeh Basti, Iran's charge d'affaires in London, told
Independent Television News in Britian on Friday that Khomeini's
call was ``based purely on religious grounds.''
   In Egypt, 1988 Nobel Prize laureate Naguib Mahfouz today said
Khomeini's call ``can undoubtedly be considered terrorism.'' The
76-year-old novelist said in an interview that the ``decision is
against humanity because it is against thought and against human
rights. It is also against Islam because it harms the reputation of
Islam and Moslems in the civilized world.''
   The head of the Shiite Moslem community in Europe on Friday urged
book companies not to publish the novel, but he denounced Khomeini's
death call.
   ``The Moslem world is shaken, shocked by this work, which throws
doubt on the authenticity of our holy book, which treats the wives
of the prophet as prostitutes,'' Ayatollah Mehdi Rhouani said from
his Paris home in an interview with The Associated Press. But he
said Khomeini's decree was ``contrary to Islamic law, contrary to
international law, contrary to morals.''
   Rushdie's publishers showed the apology to Britain's Foreign
Office shortly before it was made public.
   A Foreign Office spokesman, who by custom was not identified,
said: ``The statement is, of course, a matter for Mr. Rushdie and
not for the government. But if it serves to calm passions, then that
can only be a good thing.''
   Members of Britain's Moslem community welcomed Rushdie's
statement. But leaders of the Islamic community in Bradford, where
some copies of the book were burned in public, said their campaign
against it would continue.
   ``I think the apology will calm down the situation but it will
not change the situation overall until the book is withdrawn from
circulation,'' said Liaqat Hussain, general secretary of the
Bradford Council of Mosques.
   Viking, the book's publishers in Britain and the United States,
said earlier this week that it and the author ``very much regret the
distress the book has caused.'' But Viking did not apologize for
publishing the book.
   Before today's statement, Rushdie had said the novel was
fictional and not blasphemous.
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes their religion by,
among other things, portraying the prophet Mohammed's wives as
prostitutes and suggesting that he wrote the Koran, the holy book of
Islam, rather than receiving it from God.

<TEXT>
   Arab assailants today ambushed two Jewish
seminary students near the old Walled City in Arab east Jerusalem
and stabbed one of them to death in what authorities described as a
terrorist attack.
   Shlomi Cohen, 21, was stabbed in the heart with a pocket knife in
the afternoon while he and a friend walked outside the Old City wall
near Zion Gate on Mount Zion in Arab East Jerusalem, said police
spokesman Uzi Sandori.
   Cohen struggled briefly with his assailant after the stabbing,
ran a few yards, collapsed and died, Sandori said.
   When reporters arrived at the scene, Cohen was lying on the
ground, his body covered by a blood-stained white sheet.
   ``This seems to be a terrorist attack,'' said Jerusalem police
commander Yosef Yehudai.
   Israel Army radio said the assailant and several accomplices fled
into the narrow alleys of the Old City after the 2 p.m. attack, and
large numbers of police searched the area, the report said.
   Dozens of Arabs were rounded up for questioning, Sandori said.
   Cohen was the second Jew killed in Jerusalem since the
Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
started December 1987. In June 1988, a Jewish seminary student was
shot and killed by an Arab prostitute, and police said at the time
she had nationalist motives.
   Cohen and his friend, 21-year-old Gavriel Hanukka, were walking
on Mount Zion when they noticed five men who appeared to be Arabs
walking behind them, said Sandori.
   ``Two of the Arabs ran ahead and waited for Cohen and Hanukka in
a little alley way. There, they attacked Cohen, and Hanukka ran to
get help,'' said another police official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Cohen and Hanukka studied at a Jewish seminary in Maalei Adumim,
a West Bank settlement east of Jerusalem, police said. Cohen was a
Jerusalem resident, police said.
   The last stabbing attack in Jerusalem occurred in May 1988, when
an Arab assailant shouting ``Allahu Akhbar'' (God is great) plunged
a kitchen knife into the back of a 16-year-old Jewish seminary
student. The victim, Chanoch Albeck, suffered a punctured lung but
recovered from the attack.
   Cohen's death brings to 16 the number of Israelis killed during
the uprising against Israeli occupation of the territories they
seized from Arab neighbors in the 1967 Middle East War. More than
380 Palestinians have died.
   The slaying is expected to fuel tension between Arabs and Jews in
this disputed city. Since the start of the uprising, few Jews have
dared enter the Old City and other areas of Israeli-annexed Arab
east Jerusalem.
   The slaying comes about two weeks before Jerusalem's municipal
election, which Arab residents have vowed to boycott in solidarity
with the uprising.

   Fishermen rescued Fumio Niwa from rough waters
tonight, maritime officials said, almost 12 hours after the
adventurer abandoned his attempt to become the first person to cross
the Pacific alone in a balloon.
   The 38-year-old balloonist was in good condition after suffering
a severe bout of seasickness, said his spokesman Toshiaki Oguri.
   Niwa was picked up in generally the same area where he came down
this morning, 400 miles off the coast of Minami Torishima, an island
1,550 miles southeast of Tokyo, said Oguri and the Maritime Defense
Force.
   After his helium-filled balloon landed in the water at 11:16
a.m., Niwa immediately separated his gondola from the balloon's
tentacles and bobbed around in the Pacific Ocean awaiting rescue.
   Oguri said he communicated with Niwa by radio on the 59-ton No. 1
Yasuei-Maru. He said he did not know the destination of the fishing
boat, which also is lugging the gondola, which is six foot in
diameter.
   This afternoon, Niwa suffered severe sickness from the rough sea,
but recovered by the time he was rescued, said Kenji Fukawa, another
spokesman.
   Niwa at one point opened a window at the top of his globe-shaped
capsule to get fresh air to combat the seasickness. He also shone a
beam out into the open sea with a flashlight after dark to help
rescuers locate him, Fukawa said.
   The fishing boat was guided to the site by one of two P-3C patrol
planes deployed by the Self Defense Force. The other one flew over
Niwa's gondola to monitor his position.
   Attempts to rescue Niwa in a seaplane failed. The defense force
this afternoon sent a US-1 seaplane to the scene, but it returned to
base with engine problems. A second US-1 proved useless because it
arrived after dark.
   The fishing boat initially was delayed by strong winds of 30 mph
which later diminished.
   The balloonist took off Wednesday from his hometown of Yokohama,
near Tokyo, originally planning to reach San Diego _ Yokohama's
sister city _ in about four days by hitching a ride on the
high-altitude jet stream winds that generally blow west to east.
   But since his departure, the winds have blown north toward
Alaska, forcing Niwa to stay at a low altitude. Later, he tried and
failed to reach the jet stream, said Hiroaki Tanaka, another project
spokesman.
   Niwa, an experienced balloonist, quit his job with a computer
firm three months ago to prepare for the journey.
   In 1981, four balloonists successfully crossed the Pacific Ocean
by balloon for the first time. No one has traveled the distance
alone.

   Two British tourists have been
charged with accidentally starting a fire at a ski resort last
month, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   The Vecernje Novosti daily said mechanic Ian Charles Pond and
nurse Dawn Grace were ordered to stand trial Feb. 22 on charges of
violating public safety.
   The Jan. 24 blaze at the Kopaonik ski resort gutted the top
floors of the Ras hotel and caused an estimated $635,000 damage. The
newspaper said the two had left an iron on in their hotel suite
while they were out skiing.
   Pond and Ms. Grace chose to stay at the ski resort and continue
their vacation until the trial, Vecernje Novosti said.

   A gang of pirates shot to death a
Filipino fisherman after he refused to hand his boat over to them,
police said Saturday.
   The incident occurred off the coast of Sandakan, 1,030 miles east
of Kuala Lumpur on Friday. Police spokesman Abdul Rauf Abdul Rahim
was quoted by the national Bernama news agency as saying the pirates
ordered a group of five fishermen to stop their boat and opened fire
when they refused.
   Nulhussin Abdul, 30, was killed, but the other four were not hurt
and escaped, police said. They said there were five pirates.

   A total of 1,740 drug addicts were
arrested across Iran in a 24-hour sweep that ended Saturday,
state-run Tehran radio reported.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, said some of those arrested were
freed after signing declarations ``confessing their regrets.'' It
said the addicts were picked up in Khuzestan, Hamedan, Mazandaran,
Lorestan and western Azarbayejan provinces.
   New drug laws that took effect Jan. 21 impose the death penalty
for anyone possessing small quantities of narcotics. The laws give
addicts a six-month time limit to kick the habit, or face conviction.
   State-run media say there are about 1 million drug addicts in
Iran, which has a population of 50 million, but unofficial estimates
put the figure at 2 million. News reports last week said 175 drug
traffickers have been executed since the new law took effect.

<TEXT>
   Authorities admitted Saturday that some
prisoners have been tortured to death, but they said the number is
lower than that alleged by Amnesty International.
   In a report published last month, the London-based human rights
group accused Turkish authorities of routinely torturing political
detainees since martial law was imposed in 1980 following a military
takeover.
   Amnesty International said it gave the government a list of 239
men and women alleged to have died from torture and ill-treatment
while in custody.
   A Foreign Ministry statement Saturday said an investigation into
146 of these cases had been completed and showed that torture was
suspected in the deaths of 32 detainees or prisoners in the past
eight years.
   It said that trials in 14 of these cases had resulted in
convictions of 57 people on charges of torture and ill-treatment of
prisoners. Four cases ended in acquittals, and trials in the other
cases are under way, the statement said.
   The ministry said 10 of the people cited as dead by the Amnesty
International were still alive and others had died of natural
causes, suicide, effects of hunger strikes, or in shootouts with
security forces.
   The ministry said all allegations concerning human rights
violations in Turkey were examined ``meticulously.''
   ``But, since most of these allegations are based on insufficient
or incorrect information, it often takes a long time to reach
healthy and satisfactory conclusions,'' it said.

   Afghan guerrilla groups based in this
country today nominated a moderate as president and a hardliner as
prime minister for an interim government they hope will soon take
power in their homeland.
   Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi was nominated as president and Ahmad Shah
as prime minister, according to a statement in English by council
spokesman Rab Rasool Sayyaf. In earlier impromptu remarks to
reporters, he had said the two men had been approved for the
positions. However, his written statement said their formal approval
by the council was in fact expected Sunday.
   Mohammadi, who leads the moderate guerrilla faction known as
Harakat-i-Inqilab-i-Islami, was earlier named president of the
council itself.
   His group was one of the largest guerrilla factions at the start
of the civil war, but it has since dwindled for lack of
organization. It has never received the amount of external support
from the United States, Pakistan and other countries that the
powerful, hard-line groups do.
   Shah, a U.S.-educated engineer, is a top political officer in the
hard-line Ittehad-i-Islami guerrilla group. His group is the weakest
of four fundamentalist, Pakistani-based guerrilla factions.
   He was designated in early 1988 as prime minister of a guerrilla
government that never became functional.
   The nearly 400 council delegates cheered ``Allah-o-Akbar'' (God
is Great) when the nominations were announced, indicating Sunday's
vote will be a formality.
   The Consultative Council, or shura, started its meetings in
Islamabad on Feb. 10 to form what its leaders say will be the future
government of Afghanistan.
   The Moslem guerrilla forces and many Western diplomats say the
Marxist government of President Najib, based in Kabul, will soon
fall now that Soviet troops have withdrawn from Afghanistan. Najib
says his troops can hold on without the Soviet soldiers.
   The council spokesman said Mohammadi will serve, by virtue of
being president, as head of the presidium. That ruling body will
consist of a leader of each of the seven factions in the
Pakistani-based guerrilla alliance.
   The president will be appointed for eight months, the spokesman
said at a news briefing today.
   The prime minister and president will jointly present a list of
proposed Cabinet ministers to the council Sunday, the final day of
the council session, Sayyaf said.
   He added that an elected council will be formed within six
months, but he gave no details of those elections. He said the new
council will in turn name a president and ratify the interim Cabinet.
   The council had been bogged down over differences on
power-sharing between the seven groups in the Pakistani-based
resistance. Iranian-based guerrilla groups are boycotting the
session, demanding 100 seats in the council.
   The guerrillas fought a nine-year war against the Soviets and
Afghan troops.

<TEXT>
   When screenwriter Barry Morrow first met
Kim, his original model for the central character in ``Rain Man,''
Kim already knew Morrow's past and present phone numbers and the
number of freeway exits to his house.
   They met in Texas where Kim and his father, Fran, were attending
a 1984 meeting of the American Association of Retarded Citizens.
Kim, 37, is an extremely rare prodigious savant, capable of
recalling virtually anything his senses have ever told him.
   But while Kim has a seemingly unlimited ability to absorb and
recall facts and figures, he has limited reasoning power and his IQ
is a below-average 88. He always has lived with Fran in the Salt
Lake City area, accompanying him on frequent business trips since a
1981 divorce from Kim's mother.
   ``I am Rain Man,'' Kim said in an interview. ``This is an
important time for me. I have many talents now.''
   Morrow, who calls Kim ``an island of genius,'' believes the movie
has changed Kim.
   ``When I first met him, after he talked to me he dashed across
the room and made low moaning sounds,'' Morrow said. ``Now, he would
walk into a room and offer you his hand.''
   Kim's father, who asked for privacy reasons that his and Kim's
last name not be used, agrees that his son is changing. After a
special screening of ``Rain Man'' for the Utah Legislature, Kim
stood up and stressed the importance of understanding the needs of
the handicapped.
   ``I had no idea he could talk to those guys that way,'' Fran
said. ``He is really learning to put his thoughts together.''
   After meeting father and son, Morrow decided he would pair a
savant like Kim _ trusting and sometimes childlike _ with a greedy,
self-centered and impatient brother.
   ``Then I put them in a car and had them drive across the country
together,'' said Morrow, nominated for an Oscar for his screenplay.
It chronicles the relationship between Raymond Babbit, an autistic
savant played by Dustin Hoffman, and his brother, Charlie, played by
Tom Cruise.
   ``I don't want to take away from the other people that helped
Dustin create the character,'' Morrow said by telephone from
Claremont, Calif., ``but Kim was the first inspiration for the
story.''
   Coincidentally, Fran and Kim were rolling down the freeway when
they heard the news last week that ``Rain Man'' had been nominated
for eight Academy Awards, including best picture and best actor.
   Kim has seen the movie three times, the first seated at the
premier between Morrow and Fran. Kim stared at his hands and the
floor during most of the movie. When Morrow asked him why, Kim told
him he had seen it with his ``heart.''
   While there are behavioral similarities between Kim and Hoffman's
film character, Kim is far more outgoing. Two years ago he spent an
afternoon with Hoffman on a movie set, the actor mimicking his
movements and his walk.
   When it was over, Kim recalls, Hoffman said, ``I may be the star,
but you are the heavens.''
   Daniel Christensen, medical director of the Western Institute of
Neuropsychiatry at the University of Utah, has made a thorough study
of Kim.
   ``He has a photographic memory, but no way to minimize stimuli,''
Christensen said. ``He's the closest I've seen to a human
computer,'' unable to filter or forget information, or assign it
relative importance.
   He can answer untold thousands of questions covering history,
sports, maps, literature, mathematics and other subjects.
   ``You'd expect someone with these mental skills to have something
extra in his brain, but there's actually something missing,''
Christensen said. Brain scans show an absence of the bundle of nerve
fibers _ the corpus callosum _ that connects the two halves of the
brain.
   ``Kim is probably one in 10 million,'' he said.
   Morrow offers another insight. ``Kim has been called a savant
with some autistic characteristics, but the real answer is that,
like all of us, Kim defies human labels.''
   The screenwriter said Hoffman has received a flood of mail from
people touched by the movie, people who know other Rain Men. Morrow
takes little credit for the response.
   ``That was an accident,'' he said. ``The bigger story, bigger
than the movie, is that people are coming out of their prisons and
growing. The awards will go away, but the people like Kim will not.''

<HEAD>Bush Administration Slowly Begins To Change Zero Tolerance Drug Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the wake of a steady stream of complaints
and cries of discrimination from irate yacht owners and commercial
fishermen, the Bush administration is slowly modifying Ronald
Reagan's ``zero tolerance'' anti-drug policy.
   The controversial program, which emerged last spring in the midst
of the nation's anti-drug furor, called on the Coast Guard to seize
vessels if any amount of drugs were found on board, down to a single
seed of marijuana.
   The concept behind zero tolerance was to attack the user side of
the drug problem and force boat owners to help in the anti-drug
effort.
   But recreational boat owners and commercial fishermen said they
were being discriminated against, complaining that they could lose a
multi-million dollar vessel because a guest or crew member was found
with a small amount of drugs, and that the drug violator would face
only a minor criminal penalty.
   Last fall, Congress inserted into the sweeping anti-drug bill
orders requiring the executive branch to alter the policy on several
fronts, a move that was strongly opposed by the Coast Guard,
then-Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley and others in the Reagan
administration.
   The Bush administration, which already missed Congress' deadline
to install the new rules, last week issued interim guidelines that
prevents the Coast Guard from seizing commercial fishing vessels at
sea for small amounts of drugs. Under the new policy, the Coast
Guard can issue a summons and have a forfeiture procedure when the
fishing trip ends.
   The new guidelines also require forfeiture procedures to be
decided within 20 days.
   But an ``innocent owner'' provision of the law, which sparked the
most controversy on Capitol Hill and intense opposition from the
Reagan administration, is still being developed by the Customs
Service attorneys, and it may not turn out to be what Congress had
in mind when it wrote the law.
   One of the key concepts behind the zero tolerance policy was not
only to ``educate'' boat owners not to use drugs on board their
vessels, but to force them to take a series of steps _ such as
written anti-drug policies _ to help make sure no one else on board
was using drugs.
   ``We want to make people aware that no more can they afford to go
out there and say to 12 friends very nonchalantly, `Hey, let's just
get on the boat and go.' They have other responsibilities,'' Janet
Labuda said in an interview last year when she was head of the
Customs Service program overseeing the zero tolerance policy.
``We're asking people not to turn a blind eye and to be a little bit
more aggressive in trying to find things out.''
   Under that policy, Labuda and others said, an owner could forfeit
the vessel even if he or she did not possess drugs or were unaware
of drugs on board.
   Congressional critics led by Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., and
House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Chairman Walter B. Jones,
D-N.C., pushed to eliminate that requirement.
   ``In our view, that is shifting the law enforcement onus onto
private citizens, turning the employer into pseudo-police,'' said
Lee Crockett, an aide on the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries
subcommittee on Coast Guard and navigation.
   The Reagan administration and zero tolerance defenders on Capitol
Hill argued that such an ``innocent owner'' provision would lead to
a ``look-the-other-way defense.''
   Congress approved language that would prohibit vessel forfeitures
if owners could prove they had no knowledge of drug use on board and
that there was not ``willful blindness'' toward drug use.
   ``While law-abiding citizens should not condone drug abuses,
enforcement of the drug laws is a governmental law enforcement
responsibility, which should not be shifted to private, law-abiding
citizens through this civil forfeiture procedure,'' said Rep. Bob
Davis of Michigan, ranking Republican on the House Merchant Marine
and Fisheries Committee.
   But Customs Service officials who are drafting the proposed
regulations said the administration may interpret the congressional
changes to zero tolerance differently than Jones, Studds and Davis.
   One Customs Service attorney said the new government regulations
will propose a standard of ``reasonable expectations,'' and that
would include expectations that boat owners take some anti-drug
measures.
   ``Obviously this is going to be subject to interpretation in
court cases,'' the attorney said.
   The regulations are not expected to be announced for at least
several more weeks, and then will be subject to a 30-day public
comment period.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today declared a state
of emergency in Afghanistan, three days after the Soviets completed
their troop withdrawal and left the Afghan army to fight the Moslem
guerrillas.
   The emergency, which becomes effective at midnight, was announced
on state-run radio and television by President Najib.
   The Foreign Ministry said it was declared after unauthorized
letters and pamphlets began circulating in Kabul warning people to
close their businesses and stay off the streets. The ministry said
the material was leading people to believe that guerrillas
surrounding the city would soon launch a rocket attack.
   The emergency allows the government to suspend or limit the
constitutional rights providing for protection against the search
and confiscation of property, confidentiality of correspondence and
telephone conversations, peaceful assembly, freedom of expression
and freedom from cumpulsory labor.
   Najib said without elaborating that he acted after receiving
reports from security forces of activities of ``certain elements
trying to create disturbances.'' The military increased the number
of tanks and armored personnel carriers in Kabul and stationed
troops on the roofs of buildings.
   At a news briefing before Najib's announcement, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman, Mohammad Nabi Amani, said the declaration was
prompted by clandestine activities that were terrorizing the people
of Kabul.
   He said the activities included the circulation of letters and
unsigned phamplets that began appearing shortly before the
completion of the Soviet troop withdrawal on Wednesday. He said the
material warned residents to stay off the streets, close their
businesses and stay away from the airport.
   ``These created an air in which people were being terrified of a
rocket attack on Kabul,'' Amani said.
   He also said the refusal of the United States and Pakistan to
halt the supply of arms to the gurrrillas made the state of
emergency necessary.
   Today was the first time an emergency has been declared in
Afghanistan since 1978, when the government did so after the Marxist
government seized power in a military coup. The emergency was lifted
the following year.
   Some Western officials believe the guerrillas, now surrounding
Kabul and other major cities, will soon topple Najib's government.
But Najib says his troops can hold on without the Soviet soldiers.
   In Pakistan today, Afghan guerrilla groups nominated a president
and prime minister for an interim government they hope will soon
take power in their homeland. The guerrillas' Consultative Council
nominated Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi as president and Ahmad Shah as
prime minister. A council spokesman first said the men had been
named to the positions, but he later said they were only nominated
and that they would be approved in a vote on Sunday.
   Mohammadi, a moderate who had led one of the resistance factions,
had earlier been named president of the council itself. Shah, a
U.S.-educated engineer, is a Moslem fundamentalist.
   On Friday, a top Kremlin diplomat said Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev has appealed personally to President Bush to help bring
peace to Afghanistan now that the Red Army has withdrawn.
   Both the diplomat and a Soviet general acknowleged at a news
conference that the Soviets are worried about continued bloodshed in
Afghanistan.

<DATELINE>ANGELES CITY, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 5,000 people, including
barmaids and soldiers, marched to a rally outside a U.S. air base
Saturday to try to drown out a concert sponsored by opponents of
U.S. military bases in the Philippines.
   Authorities reported no violence. But they said the U.S.-run
Clark Air Base closed its main gate while the two groups held rival
events within a few hundred yards of each other at a park nearby.
   The anti-base concert featured dance and vocal performances with
no speeches. City authorities earlier withdrew a permit they gave
the group, but they later reissued it under pressure from members of
the Senate.
   Many senators have criticized the presence of the bases on
Philippine territory and pressed President Corazon Aquino to demand
they be removed.
   Groups for and against the bases have faced off here before.
   Last month, several thousand residents of Angeles City, about 50
miles north of Manila, prevented hundreds of base opponents from
entering the city during a march from Manila. The protesters were
demanding closure of Clark, Subic Bay Naval Base and four other
smaller U.S. facilities in the country.
   Saturday's march through the city and the rally near the base
were organized by the city's Chamber of Commerce. Participants
included local officials led by Mayor Antonio Abad Santos and at
least a dozen government soldiers who marched in civilian clothes.
   Abad Santos said Clark should not be closed because most of the
city's 200,000 residents depend on it for their livelihood.
   ``Even our pickpockets will run out of business if the base is
closed,'' he said.
   Last year, the U.S. and Philippine governments concluded an
agreement allowing the United States to keep the bases until 1991 in
exchange for $962 million in military and economic aid during the
next two years.
   Mrs. Aquino has given no indication of her position on
maintaining the bases beyond 1991.

<HEAD>Dispute Over Classified Secrets Nearly Scuttled North Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial, scheduled to
start Tuesday, nearly fell apart because of an order the judge in
the case issued a month ago concerning classified material.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell spelled out in that Jan. 19
order the problems he saw arising in connection with classified
secrets that North and his attorneys wanted to reveal in the
courtroom.
   ``North and his counsel have ... been ... unwilling to advise the
government, except occasionally in the most generalized terms, why
they believe that a particular document or portion of a document is
relevant, material and required in defending the case,'' said Gesell.
   North, a former National Security Council aide, is facing 12
felony charges ranging from lying to Congress to shredding
Iran-Contra documents.
   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, the government
and the defense are required to spell out what state secrets they
expect to disclose. Intelligence agencies then decide whether to
declassify the information for use in the courtroom.
   Gesell's problem was this: How can a judge determine ahead of the
trial whether sensitive classified material should be introduced in
North's defense without knowing how or whether it ties into the case?
   The judge described his dilemma as ``legal gridlock'' and the
solution he worked out caused concern in the intelligence community.
   Questions of whether the material was admissible would be
resolved during trial rather than before the trial, Gesell ruled.
   In addition, the judge outlined eight broad categories of
classified material which North would be permitted to introduce
without prior order of the court. They included information tending
to show that North's intent and purpose was not to violate the law.
   The National Security Agency and others in the intelligence
community worked through the Justice Department in an attempt to
build in more safeguards.
   Gesell felt sufficient controls were in place and was concerned
that too many restrictions would jeopardize North's right to a fair
trial. He used the phrase ``cuckoo clock trial'' to characterize a
possible scenario in which there would be frequent courtroom
interruptions due to protests from the government over the use of
classified material.
   Matters got worse Feb. 8 when the Justice Department, acting on
behalf of intelligence agencies, sought a court order barring North
from introducing classified material without a court order and as
long as the government had an objection pending.
   Intelligence experts seated in court winced when Gesell declared
with regard to classified material: ``I have authority once the
trial starts to say this evidence comes in.'' The judge subsequently
refused to adopt the Justice Department's proposal.
   The Justice Department was opposed by independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh, who asked for more moderate safeguards which Gesell
adopted.
   It was an awkward moment in the case. Walsh was ready to go to
trial and the Justice Department was now engaged in a courtroom duel
with the the independent counsel.
   The department asked for a delay on Feb. 9, the day a jury was
chosen. Chief Justice William Rehnquist issued a stay a week ago.
   It took the prosecutors in Walsh's office and the Justice
Department four days to resolve their dispute. Under a proposed
agreement, the government outlined nine specific categories of
classified information that should not be revealed at trial before
Walsh had an opportunity contest its relevance.
   The areas included information identifying undercover CIA
officers and U.S. covert activities other than paramilitary support
to the Contras.
   Gesell accepted that part of the proposal, saying he had already
approved such safeguards earlier but was willing to restate them.
But the judge rejected procedures outlined by a Justice Department
deputy in which the attorney general would step in at any time
during trial and file affidavits in effect barring disclosure of
classified material deemed damaging to national security.
   Gesell said he didn't want Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
coming in with ``bits and pieces'' of affidavits and ordered him to
stay out of the courtroom unless he was taking the more drastic step
of filing a broader affidavit that would kill one or more of the 12
criminal charges against North.
   Walsh responded that he would notify the attorney general in
advance of planned disclosures in the nine categories, a preliminary
step which could lead to piecemeal affidavits being filed by
Thornburgh.
   On Friday, Gesell cautioned Walsh not to ``unreasonably interfere
with the orderly processes of the Court,'' a reference to the power
of the government to interrupt the trial and challenge sensitive
classified material that North might want to introduce in his
defense. What the judge is saying, in effect, is that too-frequent
visits to the court by the Justice Department will jeopardize
North's rights.
   North strongly objected to Walsh's plan, saying that it ``defies
the Court's Order, interjects the Attorney General diretly into the
trial process, and guarantees the unfair `cuckoo-clock' proceeding
that the Court has insisted it wants to avoid.''

   ``I've always worked for someone else. I'd like to become my own
boss,'' says the mother of two.
   She's getting her chance under a pilot Self-Employment Initiative
program in which Mississippi, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota and New
Jersey are participating.
   Moore, of Canton, says she worked for seven years in a bank's
collection department and a year for a private collection agency.
   She wanted to open her own collection agency, but is supported by
the Welfare Department's Aid to Families with Dependent Children
program and until now couldn't can't afford to start her own
business.
   The Self-Employment Initiative will give Moore a chance to make
her dream come true. And other women in the two pilot projects in
Canton and Meridian hope to turn skills learned at home into
profitable commercial enterprises such as house cleaning, child care
and catering.
   Each participant will be allowed to borrow up to $5,000.
   ``The real key to the project is not the loan but the training,''
said John Jones, director of the pilot project in Meridian.
   Meridian Junior College is providing business training, and the
Canton project has contracted with Bill Cooley of Systems
Consultants in Jackson to provide six months of morning workshops
covering everything from marketing to legal, tax and insurance needs
of small businesses.
   Cooley said he helps each participant draw up a detailed business
plan before they present their loan application to the program's
advisory board, which includes local business owners as well as
welfare and social service representatives.
   Under a special waiver, participants will be allowed to retain
their welfare benefits for one year before they must begin paying
back their loan and living off their businesses, explained Glenda
Crump, project director in Canton.
   Aurelia Jones-Smith, project coordinator for the Governor's
Office of Federal-State Programs, said her office chose to use some
of its federal dollars for the Self-Employment Initiative instead of
other welfare programs because Gov. Ray Mabus wanted to ``provide
another option.''
   But his state welfare commissioner, Thomas Brittain, has
reservations.
   ``My first concern is that it's an awful lot of money for such a
few (welfare) clients,'' Brittain said. ``Second, private ventures
even under the best of circumstances often fail. And third, there
are probably things we could do to get these same people other
jobs.''
   Jones-Smith says of skeptics: ``Are they suggesting that AFDC
recipients should work only for others and not for themselves? That
implies the only option that should be available to these people is
to work for somebody else, and I don't agree with that.''
   The Governor's Office of Federal-State Programs has funneled
about $70,000 each into Mississippi's two pilot projects, with 10
participants in Canton and 22 in Meridian.
   The $70,000 is almost all federal funding and covers the
projects' operations for 18 months. Canton started its program in
January and Meridian began in December. Both programs also are
seeking private donations to bolster their revolving loan funds.
Crump said the Levi Strauss Foundation has given the Canton project
a $49,000 grant.
   Crump said about 40 Madison County welfare recipients applied for
the Canton project; 10 participants were selected.
   ``We looked at their debt level, because if they're overextended
we know that once they start their business a lot of their money
will probably have to go back into some of those debts that they
acquired,'' she said. ``We looked at their (business) idea to see
how viable it is for this area, and we also looked at their desire
and commitment to becoming self-employed.''
   Progam workers say they expect the new business owners to be able
to repay their loans, but know most probably will never become
wealthy.
   ``We're starting off with a projected gross income between
$12,000 to $15,000 annually,'' Crump said ``It's not a lot, but it
would be enough to let them leave welfare and be self-sufficient.''

<HEAD>Only Agreement Among Experts Is There Are No Easy Answers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts on global warming, uncertain whether
the greenhouse effect will produce more long, hot summers, are
giving Congress conflicting advice on whether immediate action is
needed.
   The disagreement, to be aired before a House panel Tuesday, is
unlikely to suggest a solution to legislators wondering what to do
about gases that trap heat like the glass roof of a garden
greenhouse.
   The searing heat wave and severe drought that afflicted many
areas last summer often was blamed on the theory that the earth is
slowly warming because of such a phenomenon.
   Experts agree there is a greenhouse effect, but also realize
they're gazing into ``a very dirty crystal ball,'' according to a
witness scheduled to testify Tuesday before the House Energy and
Commerce energy and power subcommittee.
   ``The tough problem is how long we clean the glass before we act
on what we think we see inside,'' according to Stephen H. Schneider,
of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
   Schneider has written that immediate environmental action must be
taken as an insurance policy against ``the uncomfortable risks of
future grim surprises.''
   But Patrick J. Michaels, a University of Virginia professor of
environmental sciences, will caution the subcommittee against acting
hastily on a ``clouded vision,'' because lawmakers may take action
they'll regret. Michaels has warned against ``public hysteria'' and
``the politics of fear.''
   ``Suppose you pass a `carbon use fee' for gasoline,'' he said in
an interview. ``That can have serious economic effects. You better
make sure you have the bases covered.'' His reference was to a
policy calculated to reduce the release into the atmosphere of
carbon gases, a major contributor to the greenhouse effect.
   The greenhouse effect occurs when gases in the earth's atmosphere
trap radiant heat near the planet's surface _ the more gases, the
more heat.
   The gases are more transparent to incoming solar energy than they
are to outgoing infrared energy. Mars, a planet with a thin,
predominantly carbon dioxide atmosphere, has a mean temperature that
is below that of deep freezers. Venus, with a thick, largely carbon
dioxide atmosphere, is hotter than an oven.
   The earth's atmosphere, on the other hand, has been just right to
support life.
   Greenhouse gases have built up due to burning of fossil fuels _
coal, oil and natural gas _ and destruction of tropical rain forests.
   The difficulty is in guessing how much greenhouse gases will
increase in the future, and what effect they will have on climate,
the experts say.
   The answer, Michaels said in the interview, is ``just very
unclear right now.''
   Michaels said there is evidence the earth is warming less than
would be expected, and some indication that much of the warming
occurred at night _ a development that could trigger beneficial
effects like a longer growing season.
   ``If we base rational environmental policy on the greenhouse
effect, and it turns out over the next few years it's not going to
warm up as much as some people feared ... the basis of that policy
will have lost its credibility,'' he said. ``You can wind up setting
back the progress on these important environmental matters another
decade or two.''
   Michaels fears no one will heed such a cautionary view the first
really hot day of summer, when people start ``screaming you have to
do something now.''
   The Virginia professor said he supports taking actions that could
alleviate greenhouse buildup, if they're done for other
environmental reasons. An example, he said, would be stopping the
destruction of tropical rain forests.
   Schneider adopts a more forceful ``tie-in'' strategy, that would
be designed partly to reduce greenhouse gases, while simultaneously
providing other benefits unrelated to climate.
   This strategy envisions more efficient use of energy, including
strict opposition to weakening automobile gasoline mileage
standards, he said.
   Other ideas: development of non-fossil fuel energy supplies,
including solar and a new generation of nuclear plants; and helping
developing countries deploy alternative technologies that can
provide economic development with less pollution.

<HEAD>Parents of Wall Street Whiz Kid Sued for Money He Spent on Them</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Wall Street whiz kid who bilked $15 million
from investors spent almost $200,000 on his parents _ making loans
to them and paying for trips to Europe and the Super Bowl, according
to a lawsuit filed against the parents.
   The lawsuit was filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
by Irving H. Picard, court-appointed receiver for David Peter Bloom
and Greater Sutton Investors Group Inc., of which Bloom was sole
shareholder. The receiver said he is trying to locate and repay the
100 people Bloom defrauded.
   The Blooms did not immediately return a telephone call seeking
comment, but their attorney, Karl Lowenthal, said, ``This money was
never given to them. This is a strange thing. ... It might be purely
imaginary.''
   He added, ``Their kid's in jail. They're distraught. They're
bankrupt from defending him.''
   Bloom is serving an eight-year prison sentence in Allenwood,
Penn. He pleaded guilty to one count each of mail fraud and
securities fraud and was sentenced in December.
   He also was ordered to make full restitution of the $15 million
prosecutors said he conned mostly out of friends of his parents and
used for expensive artworks, luxury cars and posh homes.
   About $3.1 million has been repaid to investors, Picard said, and
further payments are expected.
   The lawsuit alleges that Bloom lent his mother, Lois, at least
$156,000 and his father, Daniel, $10,250, and paid for $25,000 in
trips to Europe, the Caribbean and the Super Bowl and meals for one
or both of them.
   ``The funds ... came entirely from monies entrusted to Bloom for
investment purposes and diverted to his personal use,'' the lawsuit
alleged.

<HEAD>Broadway Producer Adela Holzer Arrested on Larceny Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Broadway producer turned convicted con artist
was held without bail on charges that she stole at least $280,000
from investors by claiming to be the wife of David Rockefeller.
   Adela Holzer, 54, who was a major backer of such hits as ``Hair''
and ``Lenny'' and later served two years in prison for an investment
scam, was arrested Thursday on grand larceny charges and ordered
held without bail at an arraignment Friday.
   ``I believe she was preparing to flee,'' Assistant District
Attorney Christopher Prather said in arguing for the no-bail
provision. ``And I believe she has access to an immense amount of
stolen wealth.''
   Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said Mrs. Holzer
broke free from detectives and tried to run after they grabbed her
outside her apartment building.
   She was arraigned on two counts of second-degree grand larceny
before Criminal Court Judge Bruce Allen. Her lawyer, Robert
Koppelman, said his client would plead innocent.
   Mrs. Holzer is accused of swindling two men, investment counselor
Brian Griffiths and furniture dealer Jack Vallega, out of $280,000.
But Morgenthau said at least 26 investors gave her money and he
suspects she took them for millions of dollars.
   Morgenthau said Mrs. Holzer got the money by falsely telling
investors she was secretly married to Rockefeller, former chairman
of Chase Manhattan Bank, and that he would invest the money and get
a high rate of return in a short period. She accepted a minimum of
$10,000 for investment, promising returns of 48 percent to 82
percent within 90 days, Morgenthau said.
   To support the marriage claim, the district attorney said, Mrs.
Holzer had two certificates, one dating from 1983 and the other from
1987, which purported to show that she and Rockefeller were wed in
Madrid, Spain.
   She also kept a silver-framed photograph of Rockefeller by her
bed, Morgenthau said.
   In fact, the district attorney said, Rockefeller does not know
Mrs. Holzer and has never had any business dealings with her.
Rockefeller, 73, and his wife, Peggy, have been married since 1940.
   Ten years ago, Mrs. Holzer was convicted of swindling investors
in a bogus Toyota dealership in Indonesia and three land scams in
Spain. She served two years of a two-to-six-year sentence.
   If convicted of the latest charges, Mrs. Holzer could face up to
15 years in prison.
   During the 1960s and '70s, she was a major investor in ``Hair,''
``Lenny,'' and ``The Ritz'' and was a producer of several other
Broadway shows. Since she has been out of prison, she reportedly has
been working on three upcoming theatrical projects, including a
planned musical about the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy.

<HEAD>Despite Summit, Means of Contra Disbanding Unresolved</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five Central American presidents
have signed a death warrant for the Contra movement but still must
find a way to carry it out.
   At a summit here last week, the leaders of Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Honduras committed themselves to
finding a way to disband the U.S.-backed rebel force that has been
fighting Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government for seven years.
   ``It wasn't that the presidents killed the Contras. They merely
affixed a seal to a plain truth _ that the Contras lost the war,''
said a high-ranking diplomat from a nation that will provide troops
for a United Nations monitoring force.
   At the same time, President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua pledged to
move his nation toward democracy.
   Although President Bush was skeptical, others said Ortega has no
alternative as he tries to reconstruct Nicaragua's shattered economy.
   The Central American presidents promised to produce within 90
days a detailed program for the ``demobilization and voluntary
repatriation or relocation'' of the Contras.
   The rebel force consists of about 11,000 fighters and 8,000 to
10,000 family members. The Contras received strong support from the
Reagan administration, but they've been withdrawing from Nicaragua
to border camps in Honduras since Congress cut off military aid in
February 1988.
   Many say they are determined to keep fighting even though it is
extremely unlikely the United States will renew military aid.
   A blueprint for disbanding the Contra force was drafted earlier
this month in meetings at the United Nations in New York. Under the
proposal, Spain, Canada and West Germany would station troops along
the Honduran-Nicaraguan border.
   ``We're talking about small contingents, mostly soldiers, but
unarmed,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``One thing these countries don't need is more armies.''
   Foreign ministry officials from the Central American nations will
work with U.N. officials on a final plan, to be approved by the
presidents of their nations.
   The plan might allow some Contras to return to Nicaragua or
settle in Honduras. Others might be relocated to third countries,
including the United States.
   ``Dissolution of the Contras is irreversible,'' the diplomat said.
   He said Honduras ``was fed up to the eyebrows'' with having an
alien armed force on its soil. Moreover, the Contras lost their
patron when Reagan left office, the diplomat said.
   Contra leaders did not agree on the rebels' future in light of
the Central American accord.
   ``If we can't win (militarily), we have to make use of new fields
of action,'' said one leader, Adolfo Calero.
   He said Washington has a moral obligation to the Contra movement
and that it should provide relocation money and visas for rebels who
want to settle in the United States. It would cost between $150
million and $250 million to dismantle the forces, Calero said.
   ``The U.S., whether it likes it or not, is deeply involved in
what's happening,'' he said. ``It has to monitor Sandinista
compliance and support the Central American presidents.''
   Wilfredo Montalvan, like Calero a member of the Contra
directorate, said the rebels will not lay down their arms until the
Sandinistas start carrying out democratic reforms. He did not say
how the Contras could be effective without U.S. aid.
   Enrique Bermudez also said the Contras may continue their fight.
   He was unimpressed with Ortega's pledge to free political
prisoners, hold early elections and allow opposition parties access
to the media.
   ``What Ortega committed himself to was very little,'' said
Bermudez, considered the most hawkish Contra.
   He said Nicaraguan authorities terrorize civilians and that
neighborhood committees keep a Big Brother-like watch over residents.
   President Bush also was leery.
   ``Claims like this have been made at one time only to see those
claims repudiated,'' he said. ``Let's be sure that we not leave the
resistance standing alone, leave them twisting down there without
fulfillment of the methods of democracy on the part of the
Sandinistas.''
   Because the Central American nations reached agreement on the
Contra question, the United States likely will have less flexibility
in how it responds to political changes in Nicaragua.
   The diplomat whose country will participate in the U.N. task
force said Ortega's pledge to bring democracy to his nation was not
so much a concession as a recognition of Nicaragua's state of
affairs.
   ``Nicaragua is in such disastrous economic shape that it has to
reform in order to reconstruct. It has no alternative if it wants
outside support,'' the diplomat said.

   The adventure of a Japanese balloonist who tried to
make the first solo flight across the Pacific ended Saturday night
when fishermen pulled him from a gondola that had been tossed around
in rough seas nearly 12 hours.
   The 38-year-old balloonist, Fumio Niwa, was in good condition
after suffering a severe bout of seasickness, said his spokesman,
Toshiaki Oguri.
   Niwa was picked up close to where he came down Saturday morning,
400 miles off the coast of Minami Torishima, an island 1,550 miles
southeast of Tokyo. He brought the helium-filled balloon down
intentionally.
   After landing in the water, Niwa immediately separated his
gondola from the balloon and bobbed around in the Pacific Ocean
awaiting rescue.
   Oguri said he communicated with Niwa, who spoke by radio on the
59-ton No. 1 Yasuei-Maru. Oguri said he did not know the destination
of the fishing boat. It was towing the gondola, which is six feet in
diameter.
   The balloonist took off Wednesday from his hometown of Yokohama,
near Tokyo, originally planning to reach San Diego _ Yokohama's
sister city _ in about four days by hitching a ride on the
high-altitude jet stream winds that generally blow eastward.
   But the winds were blowing north toward Alaska, forcing Niwa to
stay at a lower altitude, his spokesmen have said.
   Saturday afternoon, Niwa suffered severe sickness from the rough
seas, but he recovered by the time he was rescued, said Kenji
Fukawa, another spokesman for the balloonist.
   Niwa at one point opened a window at the top of his globe-shaped
capsule to get fresh air to combat the seasickness. He also shone a
beam of light into the open sea with a flashlight after dark to help
rescuers spot him, Fukawa said.
   The fishing boat was guided to the site by one of two government
P-3C patrol planes. The other one flew over Niwa's gondola to
monitor his position.
   Attempts to rescue him in a seaplane failed. The government sent
a US-1 seaplane, but it returned with engine problems. A second US-1
proved useless because it arrived after dark.
   The fishing boat initially was delayed by 30-mph winds, which
later diminished.
   Niwa, an experienced balloonist, quit his job with a computer
firm three months ago to prepare for the journey.
   In 1981, four balloonists successfully crossed the Pacific Ocean
by balloon for the first time. No one has traveled the distance
alone.

<HEAD>Mrs. Mandela Agrees to Remove Bodyguards From Her Home</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Winnie Mandela agreed today to
remove from her home the bodyguards who have been accused of
abducting and beating a black teen-age activist who was later found
dead, a minister said.
   The agreement came soon after the exiled leadership of the
African National Congress said Mrs. Mandela had made mistakes and
had refused to heed earlier requests to disband the youth group,
known as the Mandela United soccer team.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, who announced the agreement after meeting
with Mrs. Mandela for five hours, told a news conference that she
had asked him to find another place for the youths to stay.
   Chikane, general-secretary of the South African Council of
Churches, said Mrs. Mandela told him she was following instructions
from her husband, Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned leader of the
African National Congress.
   The outlawed ANC is the main guerrilla group fighting to end the
apartheid system of legalized racial discrimination in South Africa.
   The statement from the ANC's exile headquarters in Lusaka,
Zambia, called on anti-arpartheid groups to help her solve the
problem. It was less critical than the condemnation of Mrs. Mandela
that was made Thursday by some of the most prominent leaders of
anti-apartheid organizations inside South Africa.
   Chikane refused to say why Mrs. Mandela had not carried out her
husband's wishes immediately after she visited him in prison on
Wednesday.
   He said he would find another place for the black youths to stay
and make other arrangements for Mrs. Mandela's security. He did not
elaborate.
   She formed the Mandela United soccer club in 1986, saying she
wanted to provide something to do for youths congregating on the
streets near her house.
   But they became a group of bodyguards who lived at the house in
Soweto and were often accused of antagonizing members of the
community.
   Black leaders in Soweto have said they, Mandela and ANC officials
in exile have all called on her to disband the team but she had
refused.
   The controversy came to a head last month when three men told a
community meeting of 150 top anti-apartheid activists the bodyguard
members had abducted them to the Mandela home and beaten them.
   The men said that 14-year-old activist Stompie Seipei was also
taken and beaten but was hurt more seriously and was removed from
them after two days. His body was found dumped in a Soweto field on
Jan. 6 with its throat cut. Police this week identified it in a
morgue and opened a murder investigation.

<TEXT>
   Britain's Prince Charles arrived in South
Florida today for two weekend polo matches, a couple of benefits
with high society and some quiet time on a horse ranch.
   But at least one local official plans to give the Prince of Wales
the royal snub.
   ``The whole thing seems a little snooty to me,'' said Vero Beach
Mayor Ken Macht.
   After taking part in charity polo matches today and Sunday, the
prince flies on to the Caribbean island of St. Lucia and to
Venezuela, where he will visit a rain forest.
   Charles began his eighth U.S. visit in New York with a private
dinner party Friday night. Charles is traveling alone. His wife,
Princess Diana, made a highly publicized, four-day visit to New York
earlier this month.
   He spent a quiet, 24-hour visit to Washington that included a
get-acquainted dinner with President Bush at his mountain retreat.
   Bush, greeting Charles on his arrival by helicopter Friday night
at the Camp David, Md., presidential retreat, told reporters they
would discuss ``a wide array of issues'' over an informal dinner of
grilled swordfish and rice pilaf at Aspen Lodge.
   Charles ducked a question whether he would take the occasion to
lobby for one of his favorite causes _ protecting the environment _
as British officials had predicted he would. ``You never know,'' he
said.
   The only other invited guests to the two-hour dinner were Bush's
wife, Barbara; British ambassador Sir Antony Acland and his wife;
Henry Catto, the U.S. ambassador-designate to London; and Brent
Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser.
   It was the first time that Bush and the eldest son of Queen
Elizabeth II had held an extended conversation, although the former
vice president had met Charles during two previous royal visits in
1981 and 1985.
   It was Charles' second visit to Camp David, the presidential
retreat in the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland north of Washington.
He and his sister, Princess Anne, were there in 1970 as guests of
President Nixon's daughters Tricia and Julie, who served grilled
steaks and banana splits.
   Earlier Friday, the prince met over lunch at the British Embassy
with 16 American leaders in business, education, science and social
welfare programs, had afternoon tea with Vice President and Mrs. Dan
Quayle and greeted about 250 former and current American scholarship
students at British universities.
   Charles drew laughter and applause from his audience of Marshall
Scholars, whose studies abroad were financed by the British
government, when he asked about the 234 former scholars whose
whereabouts are unknown.
   ``Have they vanished off the face of the Earth or did they drop
out and are now rearing goats in Georgia? Or practicing sustainable
development in Idaho?'' he asked.
   ``Perhaps they were picked up by visiting UFOs, and their very
special skills are even now being exploited by alien intelligence in
some far-flung corners of the universe,'' Charles suggested.
   ``In that case, it merely confirms the advantages of the British
educational system,'' he said.
   Among the guests at the embassy lunch were Sen. Albert Gore Jr.,
D-Tenn.; Michael J. Boskin, nominated to head the president's
Council of Economic Advisers; Donald Graham, publisher of The
Washington Post; Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., deputy publisher of The
New York Times; Dr. Robert Watson, an expert on the ozone layer with
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Discovery space
shuttle astronaut Rhea Seddon; Bryant Gumbel, anchorman for NBC-TV's
``Today'' show; and several public and private officials concerned
with the environment, job training and housing.

   Rightist guerrillas killed eight people
and injured 50 when they attacked a passenger train traveling to
Maputo from Mozambique's border with South Africa, official media
reported Saturday.
   The attack occurred Friday at Movene, 34 miles northwest of
Maputo, the capital, AIM state news agency reported.
   It said rescue teams worked into the night ferrying wounded to
Maputo Central Hospital.
   A hospital spokesman said that of 51 people admitted to the
hospital, one died and 11 were treated and sent home. The other
deaths occurred at the scene of the attack.
   AIM said Movene has been the site of several train attacks, the
last on Feb. 5 when 11 people were killed.
   All the attacks are blamed on guerrillas of the Mozambique
National Resistance, who have been fighting since 1977 to topple the
Marxist government. They were first supported by Rhodesia, then
South Africa, which last year said it has stopped backing the

   A man who escaped from an Ohio prison in
1940 and spent nearly a half-century as a fugitive because Ohio
would not spend money for his extradition has died in Boise, Idaho,
at the age of 72.
   Charles S. Biehl died in a Veterans Administration hospital on
Jan. 24.
   Biehl escaped from the Mansfield Reformatory while serving a one-
to 20-year sentence for cashing a forged $23.30 check in Richland
County.
   He moved to California, where he was arrested periodically in the
early 1940s by authorities who were forced to release him when Ohio
officials would not pay extradition costs.
   He found a job in California and registered for the military
draft after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Biehl was drafted
into the Army and was serving in the Aleutian Islands off Alaska
when the Army learned he was a fugitive from Ohio. He was given an
honorable discharge and released.
   Biehl then went to San Francisco, married and worked in
restaurants, then moved to Boise when he retired.
   In 1953, the sheriff of San Mateo County, Calif., wrote to
then-Ohio Gov. Frank J. Lausche urging a pardon for Biehl, saying
law officers were wasting time and money because Ohio kept him on
the interstate fugitive list.
   Robert Biehl of Cuyahoga Falls, the fugitive's brother, said the
state did not try to get his brother back because of the non-violent
nature of his offense and the cost of extradition.
   Biehl ``never tried to hide either his identity or his
whereabouts,'' said his brother. ``He kept himself always available
to be returned to Ohio to complete his sentence and deal with the
escape charge if Ohio would come and get him.''

   A white principal accused of making
racist comments about blacks to white students has resigned from his
job and will be reassigned, school officials say.
   Charles Walker is accused of telling white cheerleaders that
associating with blacks would degrade them.
   ``Charlie stepped down this afternoon at Northeast,'' Jerry
Epperson, director of high schools for the East Baton Rouge Parish
school system, said Friday. ``His reason was, basically, he didn't
want to do anything to hurt Northeast High School.''
   Local NAACP chapter President G. Washington Eames said Thursday
he had received a letter written by several black teachers at
Northeast that read:
   ``When a principal summons white cheerleaders to his office and
tells them that their association and friendship with black boys and
girls will cause them to be degraded is the best example of racism
we have ever experienced from a person who calls himself a
professional.''
   Walker has been ``teaching that one race is better than or less
than the other,'' Eames quoted the letter as saying. It said he
``not only frustrated, demoralized and insulted every black child at
this school, but also ... created social degradation and human
humiliation among the black members of this faculty.''
   Walker has an unlisted home phone number and could not be reached
for comment.
   ``Rather than getting involved in some type of turmoil, Charlie
thought it best to step down,'' Epperson said.
   Walker will take one week of annual leave, beginning Monday, and
then will be reassigned to a central office position, Epperson said.
   An interim principal _ who will be from outside Northeast High
and will not be allowed to apply for the permanent position _ will
be named over the weekend, Epperson said.

<HEAD>New Secretary of State Is A Cautious Diplomat</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: inserts grafs 3-6, ``Baker briefed xxx with Baker briefing Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James A. Baker III is new to diplomacy, but he
learned fast on his first overseas trip as secretary of state not to
challenge friends or foes,
   Baker hopped nimbly through the 15 countries that are joined with
the United States in the NATO alliance without touching a sensitive
nerve.
   Baker briefed President Bush on the trip by phone on Saturday and
will meet with him personally Sunday for a more detailed report,
according to White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Bush is spending the weekend at the presidential retreat at Camp
David, Md.
   ``The president reviewed at length with the secretary a variety
of issues that had been discussed with the allies, including the
generally shared view that East-West relations are now clearly
proceeding on the basis of the West's agenda,'' Fitzwater said in a
statement.
   ``The president expressed his conviction that NATO unity is
strong and his confidence that the allies will move together in
addressing the major questions of international stability,''
Fitzwater said.
   Baker operated most effectively behind the scenes as White House
chief of staff and Treasury Secretary in the Reagan administration
and then as President Bush's 1988 election campaign chairman.
   Critics of the Bush campaign's tactics, especially its rough
attack on liberals and prisoner-release policies, rarely took aim at
Baker.
   Baker took the same subdued style with him to Canada and to
Western Europe. Just for a moment, on the flight home on Friday, he
showed a touch of emotion concerning his decision to sell his stock
in a New York bank.
   He owned the shares because of a merger involving a Texas bank
founded by his grandfather.
   ``My grandfather would be turning over in his grave,'' he said.
   And yet, characteristically, when ethical questions were raised
at the White House _ the bank holds $4.5 billion in Third World debt
that could be affected by State Department decisions _ Baker put out
the fire quickly.
   He ordered trustees to sell all of his publicly traded stock as
well as that held by his wife, Susan, and their daughter, Mary
Bonner Baker, to avoid any appearance of an ethical conflict.
   On policy issues and on terrorism Baker was as reserved in his
soft East Texas drawl as any of his Eastern predecessors.
   He artfully avoided a showdown with touchy West German leaders on
nuclear weapons and on the help German firms gave Libya in building
a chemical weapons plant.
   Baker did not try to talk Chancellor Helmut Kohl out of his
proposal, backed also by Denmark, to postpone the upgrading of
NATO's battlefield Lance missiles.
   Instead, they agreed to try to work out a compromise at the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization summit meeting being planned for late
May in Brussels.
   Baker let it be known he was aware of the political problems
confronting Kohl, a conservative who faces elections in 1990 in a
country with growing disarmament tendencies.
   Nor was there any public criticism from Baker of the help West
German firms gave Libya as it tried to develop chemical weapons.
   The Germans, who first denied the charges as exaggerations by the
American media, have tightened export controls and promised to
prosecute violators. Baker let it rest at that.
   In The Hague, Baker was confronted with an appeal from Dutch
Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek that he take the advice of
French, Greek and Spanish foreign ministers who toured the Middle
East as a European Community ``troika'' and plunge into Arab-Israeli
diplomacy.
   Baker politely declined, saying the time was not right and that
premature U.S. intervention could destroy whatever moves toward
peace talks may be developing.
   He told the West Europeans he did not have ``any time line'' to
take action,
   And yet, Baker tactfully agreed to have American diplomats take
soundings among the Israelis, Arabs and the Palestine Liberation
Organization. He promised to report back to the West European
foreign ministers when they attend the opening of arms control
negotiations between NATO and the Warsaw Pact in Vienna next month.
   Even on terrorism, where George P. Shultz, his predecessor as
secretary of state, struck a high profile by vehemently denouncing
the latest outrages, Baker was careful and subdued.
   He called it ``regrettable'' that a British author had been
threatened with death by Islamic fundamentalists for publishing a
book they considered blasphemous.
   Reporters traveling with Baker were told by a self-styled senior
U.S. official that ``it does not do a lot of good if you are
interested in suppressing terrorism to fan the fires.''
   Throughout his eight-day trip Baker projected a cool, confident
reserve.
   And yet, Baker reads what is written about him. Reports from
Washington that Brent Scowcroft, the assistant to Bush for national
security affairs, was crowding him on foreign policy were dismissed
as ``ludicrous.''
   The procedure for holding White House discussions on issues that
span the State Department, the Pentagon and other agencies has been
changed to permit Scowcroft to preside.
   But reporters were told Baker was not concerned, that he has
known Bush and Scowcroft too long to worry about being eclipsed.
   They were also admonished not to overplay the disagreement with
the West Germans as a ``schism.'' And he questioned reports that he
had not informed Senate committees of his bank holdings.
   Obviously, Baker cares a lot about what the media say about him.
   He has abandoned Shultz's policy of putting all his remarks on
the record. Baker held two news conferences aboard his plane, but
most of the time reporters were given so-called ``background
briefings'' in which they were prevented from identifying the
speaker.
   Baker also has expanded his public relations contingent. While
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger in the 1970s took a single
spokesman along and Shultz added an assistant, Baker is the first to
have a staff of three looking after the press.
   He reduced his security detail, at the same time, and found seats
on his Air Force jet for 17 reporters _ a new high.

<HEAD>A Year After Scandal Broke, TV Ministry Fighting For Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN SAYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year after being disgraced by charges
of sexual misconduct, evangelist Jimmy Swaggart portrays his plight
as a life-and-death struggle against ``pornographers'' who are
trying to topple his TV ministry.
   ``This is the crisis point in this ministry. Satan has come at us
with his mightiest blow. He has not succeeded. He will not
succeed,'' Swaggart said last weekend on his hourlong television
program.
   Swaggart said that without an influx of donations, his television
ministry will leave the air Feb. 26 _ a year and five days after he
tearfully confessed from the pulpit to an unspecified sin.
   It's been a long year for Swaggart's ministry, which had seemed
to be on top of the evangelical world after the fall of PTL's Jim
Bakker.
   Shortly after Swaggart's confession to his congregation, New
Orleans prostitute Debra Murphree said he had paid her to pose nude
for him, a claim she repeated for a Penthouse magazine article.
   Swaggart originally agreed not to preach for three months, in
accordance with a recommendation from the Assemblies of God state
council, but resigned from the Pentecostal denomination after
national leaders demanded that he stay away from the pulpit at least
a year. At the same time Swaggart resigned, the Assemblies dismissed
him.
   Although the ministry refused to reveal specifics of its ensuing
financial plight as donations dropped, Swaggart held a telethon to
raise money to stay afloat; laid off employees from his ministry,
one of Baton Rouge's major employers; called off construction plans;
and put the ministry's jet up for sale.
   Once the highest-rated television preacher with viewership
estimated at more than 2 million, Swaggart was dropped from three
major cable television networks. His Family Worship Center, which
seats 5,000 and was filled to the rafters for his confession, now
displays signs informing worshipers that its large balcony is closed.
   The Assemblies of God said it would revoke credentials of
ministers who remained part of Swaggart's organization, and at least
two churches were formed in the Baton Rouge area by ministers who
left Swaggart. Many faculty left Swaggart's Bible college,
enrollment dropped, and some graduates last spring wondered aloud if
their diplomas could be changed to eliminate reference to the
evangelist.
   Nevertheless, around Thanksgiving, Swaggart told his congregation
that the ministry had turned the corner. His television program
began broadcasts to China in January.
   Throughout, Swaggart remained mum about Murphree's claim. But he
broke his silence last month when a New Orleans stripper, Catherine
Mary Kampen, made similar allegations, and, like Murphree, sold her
story to Penthouse.
   ``There is not one shred of truth to these allegations. I have
never met or seen this woman,'' he said. The ministry promised a
libel lawsuit and said it had evidence Kampen made up the
allegations, though she and Penthouse said they stood by the story.
   ``This is a crime. It is a filth that must be eradicated from the
land,'' Swaggart said during a Jan. 30 news conference in which he
declared war on ``pornographers.''
   Two days later, Swaggart warned his congregation that another
plot to subvert his ministry might be in the works, ``as
preposterous as this one. ... If you have enough money, you can get
anyone to say anything.'' Then came the threat a week ago to halt
the TV ministry unless enough donations come in.
   On Wednesday night, Swaggart said his followers were responding
to his plea for money, ``but I don't want to shout too much because
there are newsmen here and they might think we're rich.'' Swaggart
said he had met several times with ``one of the world's foremost
lawyers.''
   For now, Swaggart says his followers must decide.
   ``You are making a choice today, a choice between the
pornographers that are working more diligently than you will ever
know ... or it's us. It's either the devil or darkness or it's God
and light.''

   Libya's defense minister arrived Saturday
and immediately announced a proposal to form what he called an Arab
Sahel state unifying his country with Oman, North Yemen, South Yemen
and Djibouti.
   Abu-Bakr Younis' proposal came as unity fever seemed to strike
the Arab world.
   On Friday, Libya, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Morocco set up
a North African ``Union of the Great Arab Maghreb,'' a political and
economic union whose details still are unclear. And on Thursday,
Egypt, Jordan, Iraq and North Yemen formed the Arab Cooperation
Council, an economic organization.
   Younis, whose visit was not announced previously, said he would
discuss strengthening bilateral relations with Sudanese officials.
Last year, Younis ended a visit to Sudan in a huff after Khartoum
rejected a proposed merger of the two countries.
   Younis said he had visited North and South Yemen, Djibouti,
Ethiopia and Somalia.
   He told reporters he was presenting ``a number of unity
projects'' to Arab and African states during his current tour.
   On his Arab Sahel state, he did not explain the relationship of
Oman, North Yemen and South Yemen from the Arabian peninsula,
Djibouti from the Horn of Africa and Libya from North Africa with
the Sahel region of central Africa.
   Younis said the two Yemens responded favorably to his suggestion
of uniting their countries but differences remained that had to be
resolved.
   Younis said Sudan was welcome to join the North African Maghreb
union. Arab officials have said Sudan has expressed interest in
joining the Arab Cooperation Council.
   Younis was holding talks Saturday with Sudan's Prime Minister
Sadek el-Mahdi and Defense Minister Abdul-Magid Khalil.
   He said he would spend two days in the Sudanese capital.

   A fruit seller's prediction that Lisbon
will be hit by a major earthquake Sunday created so much anxiety
that officials issued a statement assuring residents there was no
need to worry.
   Vivina da Conceicao, who makes her living selling fruit and
claims to be a clairvoyant, made banner headlines in local
newspapers with her ominous prediction.
   ``We've been inundated with about 100 calls a day this week,''
said Luisa Senos, at Lisbon's National Institute for Meteorology and
Geophysics.
   ``I've been explaining to these poor people that there's
absolutely no cause for alarm, there's no scientific basis'' for the
prediction, she said.
   The Civil Protection Service, responsible for salvage work in
disasters, issued a statement saying it is impossible ``to predict
earth tremors, especially down to the last detail like day and exact
time.''
   Police Saturday said traffic was heavy on highways leading out of
the city, but as one police officer said, ``It's not an exodus by
any means, and it's normal for people to leave the city on a sunny
weekend.''
   An earthquake flattened most of Lisbon in 1755.

   Afghan guerrilla leaders nominated a
moderate as president and a fundamentalist as prime minister
Saturday in what was viewed as a compromise on who will lead
Afghanistan if its Soviet-backed government falls.
   Rebel leaders told a special Consultative Council of about 400
delegates they had picked Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi as acting
president and Ahmad Shah as acting prime minister of an interim
government.
   The appointments were to be formally approved Sunday by the
council, but guerrilla officials said the vote was a formality.
``The delegates have already made their feelings clear,'' said
guerrilla spokesman Mohammed Saeed.
   Smiling delegates clustered around Mohammadi to shake his hand
and congratulate the resistance leader.
   But officials of moderate guerrilla groups said they were not
happy, claiming hard-line fundamentalist groups had dominated the
council. They said some of their own delegates might vote ``no''
Sunday or walk out in protest.
   Guerrilla leaders and some Western diplomats predict
Afghanistan's communist government will soon collapse in the wake of
Wednesday's withdrawal of the last Soviet forces. A state of
emergency was declared in Afghanistan on Saturday.
   However, the seven guerrilla parties based in Pakistan remain
deeply divided over sharing power. Many observers said the council
was probably the guerrillas' last good opportunity to form a united
front and avoid a power struggle if they take control in Kabul.
   Elections would be held in Afghanistan within six months to form
an elected council, or shura, to appoint a permanent head of state
and ratify a government, officials said.
   Guerrilla leaders said they would present their proposed interim
ministers on Sunday and ask the council to approve them. The
council, which convened Feb. 10, was expected to conclude after the
vote.
   Party leaders said Saturday their Supreme Council, rather than
the interim government, would remain the ultimate source of
authority for the guerrilla alliance. Mohammadi, leader of one of
the seven parties, was named head of the Supreme Council for eight
months.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, one of the guerrilla party leaders,
stepped down as acting head of the alliance to allow Mohammadi to be
Supreme Council head in addition to interim president, officials
said.
   Four of the seven guerrilla parties are made up of hard-line
Islamic fundamentalists who want to establish a strict
fundamentalist state in Afghanistan. The three moderate groups want
a more liberal state along the lines of the pre-communist
governments.
   The hard-line parties had pushed for appointment of Ahmad Shah as
president, but they failed because of internal divisions. He was
prime minister of an interim government formed last year.
   Ahmad Shah is a senior political official in Ittehad-i-Islami
guerrilla group.
   Mohammadi heads one of the three moderate guerrilla parties,
Harakat-i-Inquilab-i-Islami. He is widely respected as a political
and religious leader, but his party has been weakened by chronic
splits and poor organization.
   The choice of Mohammadi for acting president was seen as a
compromise after the hard-line groups insisted on Ahmad Shah.
   Mojaddidi, the former Supreme Ccouncil head, told a press
conference Saturday that moderates agreed to Ahmad Shah to preserve
the guerrilla alliance.
   The council apparently failed to resolve a dispute over seating
Afghan Shiite guerrilla groups based in Iran. A deal offering them
100 council seats was rejected by the other party leaders. The seven
main guerrilla groups are Sunni Moslem.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of warring Cambodian factions
and their neighbors meet Sunday for a round of peace talks, but
there was little sign of compromise on a key issue: how to share
power after Vietnam's troops withdraw.
   ``There is still a divergence of views, particularly on some of
the more sensitive internal issues,'' Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas told reporters Saturday.
   He was referring to how four factions that have fought for years
can reconcile to rebuild their war-torn country.
   Alatas is chairman of the three-day meeting involving Vietnam,
the administration it set up in Phnom Penh early in 1979 and three
guerrilla resistance groups.
   Also taking part are Laos and the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, comprising the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia,
Indonesia and Brunei.
   Alatas held three days of preparatory talks with Cambodian
leaders.
   ``The possibility of reaching further common ground is quite real
... Although we did not agree on all the issues, at least this was
the first time we ranged over all the major elements of a possible
solution,'' he told reporters. These included a Vietnamese pullout,
halting military aid to the resistance, and a peacekeeping or other
force to maintain stability during the transition.
   The next step could be a formal international conference, said
Alatas.
   On arriving Saturday in Jakarta, Vietnamese Foreign Minister
Nguyen Co Thach said 50 percent of the problem has been solved.
   And Prime Minister Hun Sen of the Phnom Penh government added,
``I believe we have come to the final stage of the problem.''
   Khieu Samphan, nominal leader of the largest guerrilla group, the
communist Khmer Rouge, said in a statement he would spare no efforts
to find a solution, but he restated a peace plan already rejected by
his foes.
   The rest of the sometimes shaky guerrilla alliance includes
anti-communists under deposed Prime Minister Son Sann and Prince
Norodom Sihanouk.
   Sihanouk heads the coalition but has refused to come to Jakarta
because his personal peace plan has been rejected. His son will
represent his faction.
   The Khmer Rouge is considered by far the most potent of the rebel
forces. Its government was ousted by invading Vietnamese troops
after it caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands in trying to
create an agrarian communist society.
   Foreign ministers of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam issued a joint
statement in Phnom Penh on Friday saying the withdrawal of
Vietnamese troops from Cambodia no longer is a major issue. The
outstanding problem, they said, is to prevent the Khmer Rouge
returning to power.

<HEAD>Researchers, Foresters Meet To Discuss Maple Pest</HEAD>

   While New England's maple sugar producers
prepare for the coming season, 150 scientists are meeting to discuss
a little-known pest threatening the spring tradition and $25 million
industry.
   The three-day conference this week in Burlington will focus on
the pear thrips, a tiny insect that last year defoliated 469,000
acres of forest in Vermont, 1.2 million acres in Pennsylvania and
additional acreage in the other New England states and New York. The
damage in Vermont compares with 21,000 acres the year before.
   Bruce Parker, an entomologist at the University of Vermont, said
research is continuing on the sliver-shaped insects, which begin
their damage in April by climbing into maple buds and feeding on the
tender young leaves.
   ``We're going to have problems this year but the extent of the
problems we don't know yet,'' he said.
   Maple producers are beginning to bore tap holes and set up the
tubing that collects the maple sap as they get ready for the
sugaring season, which begins in early March. For them, the
overriding question is what effect the pear thrips will have on
their source of income.
   ``Nobody knows, and all you can do is guess, but I'm optimistic
to think it's not going to be the end of sugaring,'' said Everett
Willard, maple marketing specialist for the Vermont Department of
Agriculture.
   However, 54 percent of the state's maple sugarers are planning to
reduce their taps, partly because of last year's infestation, said
Sandy Wilmot, the pear thrips coordinator for the Vermont Department
of Forests, Parks and Recreation.
   Pear thrips damaged more than one-sixth of Vermont's maple
forests last year. Significant damage was also spotted in
Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut, with lesser
damage in New Hampshire and Maine.
   Scientists believe the thrips population exploded last year
because cool spring weather allowed the maple buds to grow more
slowly and gave the thrips more time to feed.
   Many trees grew a second set of leaves, salvaging the region's
lucrative fall foliage season that draws thousands of tourists.
   But damage by the thrips, combined with last year's spring and
summer drought, caused widespread concern about the overall health
of the maple forest and how much stress a tree can take.
   It also forced scientists to produce the first research about an
insect that has only been considered a forest pest in this country
since 1979. Before then it affected mostly fruit orchards.
   ``I think people are generally pleased with the fact that we
mobilized very quickly, and it's such a cooperative effort to find
out the answers,'' said Wilmot, whose department has worked with the
University of Vermont, state agriculture workers and the federal
government.
   ``We've made good progress,'' agreed Parker, whose office is
analyzing 2,000 samples taken from 210 sugarbushes or maple groves
across Vermont. He and six researchers are trying to determine where
pear thrips are and how many of them exist.
   Parker and the state have already come out against widespread
aerial spraying of the toxic pesticide carbaryl, saying it is
unclear whether the benefits would outweigh environmental risks.
   This week's conference will attract scientists and foresters from
the United States, Canada and England.
   And scientists in other states are keeping an eye on Vermont's
research and plan more studies of their own.
   ``We've always tried to keep abreast of new developments in
forest pests and this one, which has seemed to move east in recent
years, is of particular concern,'' said Dick Dearborn, an
entomologist with the Maine Forest Service who plans to attend the
conference.

1,000 demonstrators in a protest against proposed spraying of sewage
sludge on land near the Nisqually River.
   The protesters jammed the rain-drenched Capitol steps Friday in
the best-attended protest of this legislative session.
   Chanting ``No to sludge, yes to life,'' the protesters blasted
plans of the Pierce County Utilities Department, based in Tacoma,
and the metropolitan Seattle goverment utility agency, called Metro,
to spray what they say is unsafe sludge along the Nisqually. Sludge
is what's left over after most of the liquids are removed from
sewage.
   ``We must insist on an alternate method of disposal of this
sludge,'' Ms. Evans said. ``We can't take the chance of
contaminating one of our greatest resources, the Nisqually.'' The
Nisqually flows into Puget Sound south of Tacoma, running through an
area that is still largely undeveloped.
   Pierce County Utilities has proposed sludge spraying to fertilize
a state-owned forest along the river, while Metro has purchased
2,200 acres of forest as a potential site for spraying Seattle
sludge.
   Ms. Evans said she moved to Washington two years ago from Beverly
Hills, Calif., because she wanted clean air and clean water. She
said she hopes her celebrity status will bring attention to the
issue.
   ``I became aware of something I never even knew existed,'' Ms.
Evans said. ``Sludge.''

   Country-pop singer Michael Martin Murphey
says performers of various styles of music should unite to help save
troubled symphony orchestras across the country.
   ``Symphonies are dying in our country,'' Murphey said. ``And I
think the pop artists, the country artists, the people who make a
pretty good living with music, ought to collaborate with symphonies
to try to keep those symphonies going.''
   ``The symphonies suffer from a `stuffed shirt' image and they
need to try to get rid of that,'' he said. ``It would be just a
tragedy if we lost that classical heritage.''
   Murphey will perform with the Nashville Symphony Orchestra next
Saturday. The orchestra will play classical musical and then back
Murphey in some of his country-flavored songs.
   His hit records have included ``Wildfire,'' ``Geronimo's
Cadillac,'' ``Ghost Town,'' ``Medicine Man'' and ``Cherokee
Fiddle.'' He performs with about 10 symphonies a year.
   The Nashville Symphony recently began playing again after
disbanding a year ago because of finances.

   United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber is
fasting to call attention to black detainees held in South African
prisons without charge.
   Bieber, who started fasting Friday, said he would begin eating
again after two days.
   Another UAW official will begin fasting after Bieber ends his
fast, and the two-day fasts will continue until the detainees are
released or until the union holds its convention in June, the union
said.
   In South Africa, large-scale hunger strikes among blacks detained
without charge began three weeks ago. On Friday, the white minority
government said most had stopped their protest after assurances that
a ``substantial'' number of detainees would be freed. But lawyers
for at least 100 detainees said Saturday that their imprisoned
clients' fasts were continuing.

   Former Gov. John Connally has returned to the
Texas banking scene after a 3{-year absence, during which the former
millionaire developer fought through bankruptcy and became a media
pitchman for a Houston thrift.
   Connally has joined First City Bancorp. of Texas as a paid
consultant, and will mine prospects and serve as a high-profile
booster, a spokesman for the Houston-based company said Friday.
   ``He will be advising us on the development of Houston and Dallas
as a major regional financial center in the United States,'' said
spokesman Jim Day. He declined to reveal any details of Connally's
contract, and Connally's office said he was out of state and
unavailable for comment.
   First City's predecessor sued Connally several years ago to
collect on a bad debt, but the dispute has since been settled, Day
said.
   Since leaving the law firm of Vinson &amp; Elkins, where he was a
partner for many years, Connally has quietly run a small consulting
firm and last year made a cameo appearance in print and television
ads for University Savings Association.
   Connally was governor of Texas from 1963 to 1969, and was wounded
in the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963 in Dallas. He was
a presidential candidate in 1968, 1976 and 1980.
   Connally filed for personal and business bankruptcy in August
1987, listing more than $170 million in debts. His financial
problems prompted First City National Bank, then part of old First
City Bancorp., to sue him for $3 million in connection with an
unpaid loan.

<HEAD>Second Sea Lion Dies in Transfer Program</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A second captured California sea lion has died and
officials said Saturday they will no longer use drugs to anesthesize
the 600-pound animals before moving them to the southwestern
Washington coast.
   So far, four sea lions have been captured as part of an effort to
keep them from eating steelhead trout migrating from Puget Sound to
Lake Washington through a ship canal. Two of the four have died, the
latest one Friday night.
   Both died as they were coming out of an anesthetic, said Hal
Alabaster, spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   The second animal to survive the capture and drugging was to be
trucked to the Washington coast for release along the Long Beach
Peninsula. The first sea lion was released there Thursday.
   The second sea lion to die had seemed to be recovering when it
collapsed late Friday night, Alabaster said. ``It appeared to be the
most robust and the strongest of them all,'' he said.
   An autopsy was planned.
   After the first sea lion died, officials said the effects of the
anesthetic may have been aggravated by a severe lung infection and a
bullet wound found on it. The drug used was Telazol, a muscle
relaxant.
   Alabaster said wildlife officials involved in the program plan to
continue capturing the animals, which are protected by federal law,
in a buoy-mounted cage and will try to find a way of fitting them
with radio transmitters and moving them without using drugs.
   ``We've lost two animals. We need to re-evaluate it,'' he said.
``The program wasn't designed to kill animals.''
   He said there is not a lot of experience in working with drugged
sea lions, but that drugs were used because a ``600-pound wild
animal is a dangerous thing to try to handle without being under
sedation.''
   The practice of using drugs had been criticized by environmental
activists, who said it was not necessary to put the animals under to
remove them.
   The sea lions are being moved because they are eating the run of
steelhead trout that goes through the Ballard Locks to enter Lake
Washington on their way to spawning grounds.

<HEAD>87-Year-Old Takes 200th Consecutive Weekend Cruise</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Every weekend for the past 200
weekends, 87-year-old William Robertson has boarded a cruise ship
for a three-night excursion to the Bahamas and back.
   ``There's no better way to spend the weekend,'' says the retired
restaurateur.
   ``I love the ocean, the ship and talking to people,'' Robertson
adds. ``I'm going to do it every weekend 'til I die.''
   He's not trying to set any records. He simply loves being aboard
the Starship Oceanic, mingling with the passengers and crew and
getting special recognition at the ship captain's cocktail party
every Saturday night.
   Captain Dimitrios Chilas, one of Premier Cruise Lines' ship
masters, presented Robertson with an honorary captain's uniform on
his 86th birthday and Robertson wears it to the traditional party,
where he is introduced to the passengers as a special member of the
staff.
   ``He's a very special person and we're always glad to have him
aboard,'' Chilas said.
   Robertson, who lives in Melbourne, is tan and fit, boasting that
he gave up smoking and drinking in 1950 ``and never missed either.''
He weighed 230 pounds at that time and is now a svelte 160.
   ``I was in the restaurant business for 40 years before I retired
to Florida,'' Robertson says proudly. ``I had two wives and I had a
good time. I'm still enjoying life.''
   He's known aboard the Starship Oceanic as ``Cap'n Snuffy,'' for
the name of his restaurant in Scotch Plains, N.J., Snuffy's Famous
Steakhouse.
   In a telephone interview before he sailed Friday, Robertson said
he became interested in ships when he worked his way halfway around
the world aboard a freighter at the age of 19 shortly after World
War I. He eventually arrived in Scotch Plains with $2 in his pocket
in 1932, he said.
   Laurel Thompson, publicity manager for Premier in Port Canaveral,
said Robertson began his weekend odyssey on March 22, 1985, on the
Starship Royale, which has since been sold. He usually takes a small
cabin costing from $395 to $550, depending on the location, Ms.
Thompson said.
   ``He doesn't spend a lot of time in his cabin because he's
strolling around talking to passengers and crew, up on the bridge
with the captain or just relaxing on deck,'' she said.
   ``His special thing is sitting at the captain's table for dinner,
especially during the Saturday night parties when he wears his
uniform and is introduced to the passengers. He's the only one that
gets a special reserved seat right up front during the musical
revue.''
   The company's Janine Warell said Robertson has logged more than
108,000 nautical miles on the three-night excursions.
   On Saturdays, Robertson gets off with other passengers in Nassau,
and he takes a boat to the Bahamian island Salt Cay on Sundays
before the ship heads back to Port Canaveral, arriving there early
Monday.
   Robertson, who has his own apartment in a large house owned by
his daughter and her husband, ``is completely independent and on his
own all the time. I hardly ever see him except at dinner,'' says his
daughter, Jean Goldstein.
   During the week, Robertson says: ``I bounce around here and
there. I take a ride over to the ocean, sit around over there. I see
friends. But many of my close friends are in Palm Beach, where I
used to own a house right near Rose Kennedy,'' mother of the
Massachusetts Kennedy clan.
   Perhaps in the only concession to his age, Robertson has recently
changed his booking arrangements with Premier Cruise Lines.
   ``I used to book my cruises six months at a time,'' he says.
``But now, I'm only booking `em one month at a time. You never know
...
   ``But I don't plan to do anything different on my weekends. I
like it. It's something to do.''

<TEXT>
   Salman Rushdie, author of ``The Satanic Verses,'' had faced
censorship before his latest novel caused an uproar in the Islamic
world and led to threats against his life.
   He had two run-ins with censors in Pakistan, according to an
essay Rushdie contributed to an anthology on censorship with the
ironic title ``They Shoot Writers, Don't They?'' published by Faber
and Faber Ltd., of London, in 1984.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' has drawn calls from the Iran's Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini for the author's execution. Several countries have
banned the novel and a number of U.S. book stores, including the B.
Dalton and Waldenbooks chains, have pulled it from their shelves.
   Moslems contend the novel blasphemes the prophet Mohammed.
   Rushdie's essay, titled ``Casualties of Censorship,'' was written
for the magazine ``Index on Censorship'' in 1983.
   ``My first direct contact with censorship took place in 1968,
when I was twenty-one, fresh out of Cambridge and full of the
radical fervour of that famous year,'' Rushdie wrote.
   Commissioned by a magazine to write his impressions of returning
home to Pakistan, Rushdie said he remembered little about the piece
except ``images of dying horses with flies settling on their
eyeballs.''
   Several weeks later he learned from the magazine editor that
official government censors had banned the article.
   Quizzing an uncle who served on the censorship panel, Rushie
quoted him as saying: ``Publication would not be in your best
interests.''
   ``I never found out why,'' the author said.
   On another occasion, Rushdie persuaded Karachi TV to let him
produce Edward Albee's ``The Zoo Story.''
   ``I then had to go through a series of astonishing censorship
conferences,'' he wrote.
   He was ordered to remove references in the play to pork, which
Moslems aren't allowed to eat, sex and homosexuality, he wrote.
   Rushdie stood his ground on pork, even though he was told the
word could not be spoken on Pakistani television.
   ``Pork, in Albee's view, made hamburgers so disgusting that even
dogs refused them,'' Rushdie wrote. ``This was superb anti-pork
propaganda.''
   But the television executives were unswayed and made even more
demands, Rushdie wrote.
   ``I also had to cut the line about God being a coloured queen who
wears a kimono and plucks his eyebrows,'' he wrote.
   ``The point I'm making is not that censorship is a source of
amusement, which it usually isn't, but that _ in Pakistan, at any
rate _ it is everywhere, inescapable, permitting no appeal,'' he
wrote.
   ``What are the effects of total censorship? Obviously, the
absence of information and the presence of lies,'' he wrote.
   ``But the worst, most insidious effect of censorship is that, in
the end, it can deaden the imagination of the people,'' he wrote.
``It becomes easy to think that what has been suppressed was
valueless anyway, or so dangerous that it needed to be suppressed.''

<HEAD>Iraqi, Iranians to Meet at Border</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military officers from Iraq and Iran will
meet Wednesday at their countries' common border to help stabilize
the cease-fire in the war, U.N. peacekeepers announced Saturday.
   U.N. officials last week told The Associated Press each country
will be represented by 10 officers. They will work with their
governments and the U.N. observers to resolve problems in carrying
out the cease-fire agreement.
   The U.N. cease-fire monitoring group said in its statement that
the meeting will be held on the cease-fire line near the Iraqi town
of Khanaqin and the Iranian city of Qasr-e-Shirin.
   The U.N. announcement said the session will be led by the chief
of the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group, Yugoslav Maj. Gen.
Slavko Jovic.
   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq told a news conference
Saturday that the military group will work on purely technical
matters.
   Aziz also said Iraq was informed by the International Committee
of the Red Cross that Iran will allow 260 Iraqi prisoners of war to
go home soon. He said the number was too small considering Iraq's
release last month of 255 Iranian POWs.
   An exchange of 1,158 sick and disabled POWS sponsored by the Red
Cross collapsed last November amid mutual recriminations over the
number repatriated. Only 155 Iraqi and 56 Iranian prisoners were
released at that time.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 Iraqi prisoners and 19,284
Iranian prisoners. But U.N. and other estimates put the total at
100,000.
   At least 1 million people were killed or wounded in the war,
which began with an Iraqi invasion in September 1980 after several
border skirmishes. However, some estimates of the dead alone surpass
1 million, and the economic cost totals hundreds of billions of
dollars.
   A Red Cross official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the relief group is preparing to repatriate the Iraqi POWs this
week, although no date for their release has been fixed. He said the
Swiss-based Red Cross has chartered a plane to fly the Iraqi POWs
from Tehran to Baghdad.

   A 38-foot bridge closed because officials
feared it could collapse will have its rusting steel girders
replaced by wood as part of Vermont's new bridge modernization
program.
   The Meadow Brook Bridge, which has a wooden deck and rails, was
closed last summer by selectmen who worried that its rusting steel
support girders would no longer stand up to truck traffic.
   Wooden bridges save money in the short and the long run because
they are cheaper to build, don't have to be painted and are immune
to salt, said Dennis Borchardt of the George D. Aiken Resource
Conservation and Development Area, a non-profit organization
dedicated to helping find better uses for local resources.
   The project should be completed in June.

   A U.S.-Japanese commission should be
established to anticipate and solve disputes before they boil over,
says a prominent U.S. specialist on East Asian affairs.
   Robert Scalapino told a news briefing Friday he hopes President
Bush will propose to the Japanese such a joint commission to take up
problems in advance instead of allowing them ``to reach political
white heat level.''
   The two countries ``stand at a crossroads in our relations'' and
must move toward resolution of conflicts through negotiations and
compromise, said Scalapino, who heads the East Asian institute at
the University of California in Berkeley.
   Bush leaves Wednesday for Japan, China and South Korea. There may
be too little time for such matters during the planned one-day stop
in Tokyo for Emperor Hirohito's funeral but they need to be taken up
soon, Scalapino said.
   ``I think it is quite clear that if we are asking Japan to play a
larger and more responsible role in the world, we also have to share
some of the decision-making process with Japan,'' said Scalapino.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita in a recent visit to Washington
called for closer U.S.-Japanese consultation on regional and global
issues.
   In the complex U.S.-Japanese relationship, prospects are ``that
acrimony will not end, that this will continue to be a troubled
marriage,'' Scalapino said.
   U.S.-Japanese relations are smoother in security matters than
trade, but the United States has not made clear what is ultimately
expected of Japan, Scalapino said.
   Scalpino took issue with the view that it is inevitable for an
economic power such as Japan to become a military power.
   ``Apart from the fact that the Japanese people do not want a high
posture military position, and the rest of Asia does not want this,
it is also clear that the Asia of the 1980s and 1990s is not the
Asia of the 1930s,'' he said.
   ``There's no power vacuum on the continent of Asia. There's no
Japanese empire to defend, there are no Western colonial enclaves to
liberate.''
   ``A great fluidity in major power relations'' exists, Scalapino
said, because each of the major players ``with the possible
exception of Japan, has serious domestic problems, and they want a
lower cost, lower risk foreign policy.''
   Hugh T. Patrick of Columbia University forecast that Japan's
trade surpluses with the United States and the world would persist.
   ``At the same time, Japan has a lot of problems _ the runup in
stock prices and land prices poses the specter of a crash in those
markets,'' said Patrick, who heads the Japanese Economy center at
Columbia's graduate business school.
   A key issue in any Bush-Takeshita talk, he said, would be
cooperation in the current round of global trade negotiations while
simultaneously enabling Japan ``from the Japanese perspective to
protect its agriculture and from the American perspective to open
its agriculture.''

   A sign stolen a half-century ago by
students from Princeton University's Class of '37 was returned to
its rightful owner during a ceremony Saturday.
   ``It's been kept within the class,'' said Nelson Zager, keeper of
The Nassau Inn. ``They knew where the sign was, they knew who took
the sign but said nothing.''
   The hand-painted, 2-by-15 foot wooden sign, which graced the
original hotel for decades, was removed as a prank by several class
members in 1937, Zager said.
   After graduation, responsibility for the sign fell to whichever
classmate had a spare wall or decent storage space. For example,
during the war the black-and-gold sign was stored in a coal bin in
Brooklyn, N.Y.
   ``It feels great,'' Zager said about the sign's return. ``We're
going to be putting the sign over the front door of our inn where it
used to be.''
   The Inn, located across the street from the university, was an
integral part of the lives of those who took the sign, Zager said.
   ``They learned how to drink beer in our tap room. ... They wanted
to preserve their memories,'' he said.
   The sign _ well attached this time _ should be in place in front
of the 200-year-old inn by the end of the week, Zager said. ``It'll
be secured to the building well enough this time so it won't be a
tradition to take our signs,'' he said.

   There'll probably be a line of people

   The Fort Worth resident hauled in a 13-pound, 9-ounce largemouth
bass on Thursday at Lake Fork in northeast Texas.
   Casados then went back out with a fishing buddy, Hunter Chism of
Pampa, to show him how he had done it. Chism pulled in a 13-pounder
of his own.
   Both catches came in about 5 feet of water, but at different

   They're dancing away the hours _ and
hours, and hours, and hours _ at Penn State University this weekend
as students trade schoolbooks for sore feet in an effort to raise
money to fight cancer.
   ``We throw the event and hope we can raise one more dollar than
last year,'' said James Marino, a spokesman for Penn State's
Interfraternity Dance Marathon.
   The 48-hour affair attracted 270 couples who began dancing at 7
p.m. Friday to support the Milton S. Hershey Medical Center's Four
Diamonds Fund. Children with cancer were invited to dance alongside
the students.
   Billed as the largest student-run philanthropy in the nation, the
dance marathon raised $324,199 in pledges and donations last year
and has raised $1.8 million in 12 years for the fund.
   ``Everybody pulls together and somehow it comes off every year,''
said Marino, a sophomore from Hauppauge, N.Y. ``It's relatively
crazy. You run into last-minute things that happen every year.''
   Money collected from the dance marathon pays 64 percent of the
fund's budget, said Catherine Hales, associate director of
development at the medical center. The money goes to childhood
cancer research and treatment.
   Kathy Wonders, a 21-year-old senior from Apollo, was
participating in her second marathon.
   ``You get a very emotional high. That's why I'm coming back this
year _ to see all the good you're doing for the kids,'' she said.

   Iran's official news agency said Saturday
that Salman Rushdie's apology to Moslems for his novel ``The Satanic
Verses'' was insufficient because he didn't repent and order the
book withdrawn.
   A later report from the Islamic Republic News Agency indicated
the apology was accepted, but a dispatch later asked editors to note
that it was ``in fact the personal observation of the copy writer
and that it does not allow for any specific interpretation
whatsoever.''
   The government-run agency's initial reaction to Rushdie's
statement said it fell short of the apology demanded by President
Ali Khamenei to void a death sentence imposed on Rushdie by
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Later, IRNA said that Rushdie's apology, ``though far too short
of a repentance, is generally seen as sufficient enough to warrant
his pardon by the masses in Iran and elsewhere in the world.''
   The disclaimer came two hours later.
   IRNA also reported that the Persian daily Ettela'at wrote that
``to pay one man to kill another man is murder at a premium and not
a religiously-inspired act.''
   Khomeini, Iran's leader, on Tuesday issued a ``fatwa,'' or
religious ruling, saying that Rushdie should be killed because of
his novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' which some say insults Islam.
   The reported newspaper commentary amounted to an unusual
challenge to actions by Iran's religious leaders, who took
Khomeini's ruling as a cue to offer a total of $5.2 million to
whomever kills Rushdie.
   Rushdie's book has been banned in six countries, including Iran,
and removed from the shelves of major bookstores in the United
States. It has prompted protests in Iran, India, and other countries.
   Rushdie and his wife have been in hiding, reportedly protected by
armed guards, since Khomeini ordered his death.
   Iran's president said Friday that Rushdie, an Indian-born Briton
from a Moslem family, might be able to save his life by admitting he
blundered.
   IRNA quoted the newspaper as saying the price put on Rushdie's
life was ``typical of the dealings of the underworld _ and not of
the saints or religious men.''
   The newspaper said that the government-run 15th-of-Khordad
Foundation and other sponsors jumping in to up the bounty ``had
increased the bounty to a staggering figure completely overshadowing
its religious implications,'' IRNA said.
   The newspaper was quoted as saying any person trying to kill the
writer will be prompted by greed _ not religious principles.
   At a Cabinet meeting earlier Saturday, the ministers had urged
religious leaders to keep alert to any plots against Islam from the
West similar to Rushdie's book, IRNA reported.
   The London-based Islamic Society for the Promotion of Religious
Tolerance said in a statement: ``We very much welcome Mr. Rushdie's
apology and hope that it will now pave the way out of this
unfortunate crisis.''

<TEXT>
   A former Pizza Hut employee confessed
to burglaries at 58 of the chain's restaurants in three states in
the last year, authorities said.
   Larry Chamness, 22, of Granite City, was arrested last week on
suspicion of burglary in a break-in at a car wash. During
questioning, he confessed to a string of Pizza Hut burglaries in
southern Illinois, Missouri and Kentucky, police said.
   Chamness apparently chose Pizza Huts as his targets because he
``knew the system,'' said Detective Sgt. Richard Schardan of Granite
City police.
   Chamness was held Saturday in the Madison County Jail at
Edwardsville on $100,000 bond, in part for robberies at a chain
restaurant in Illinois. He was charged Friday in two burglaries at a
Pizza Hut in Missouri where he once worked.
   Police said Chamness told them he burglarized 58 Pizza Huts from
March 1988 to this month. He indicated he might have committed the
burglaries to get money to buy drugs, police said.
   In all, about $15,000 to $20,000 was taken from cash registers,
vending machines and safes in the restaurants, Schardan said.

   The Norwegian government has temporarily
banned seal pup hunting, a practice that has caused an international
uproar.
   The ban, imposed Friday, will last until the end of the year.
Last week, the government said it will create a commission to review
Norway's rules and regulations for seal hunting.
   A film charging that seal hunters violated the rules in 1987 and
1988 recently was shown on Swedish and British television. It showed
hunters clubbing seal pups and skinning them alive, and provoked a
wave of criticism.

   A black bystander who was beaten when he intervened
to help a white man during last month's civil unrest has died of his
injuries, and police say they have made no arrests.
   Hilliet Williams, 28, died Thursday. He had been in the
neurosurgical intensive care unit at Jackson Memorial Hospital since
the beating Jan. 17, the second night of rioting in Miami's
predominantly black neighborhoods following the shooting death of a
black motorcyclist by a Hispanic officer.
   Williams, who lived in the troubled Liberty City neighborhood,
had seen a white man being attacked by two black men and intervened,
giving the white man a chance to escape, said Metro-Dade police
spokesman Nick Pimentel.
   The two attackers then turned on Williams, beating him and
stealing his van, Pimentel said.
   ``He was trying to make them stop, so they beat Williams because
they could not beat the white man,'' he said.
   Williams gave some information to police before he died, but not
enough to track down the two men, Pimentel said, adding, ``we are
trying to find the white male because we have no other lead at this
time.''
   Rioting was sparked when a Hispanic police officer shot and
killed motorcyclist Clement Anthony Lloyd, who had been reported
speeding in the Overtown section of Miami. Lloyd's passenger, Allan
Blanchard, died the next day from injuries suffered in the resulting
crash.
   Officer William Lozano heard a radio report of a reckless
motorcyclist headed in his direction, stepped off a curb and shot
Lloyd. Lozano, who has been charged with two counts of manslaughter
in the men's deaths, contends he acted in self-defense.
   During the disturbances, angry mobs burned buildings, looted
stores and threw rocks and bottles at police. One looter was killed,
11 people were treated for gunshot wounds, and more than 370 people
were arrested.

<HEAD>Authorities Proposed Partially Democratic Elections</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Communist leaders proposed a new electoral
system Saturday that would reserve some Parliament seats for
independent candidates and eventually lead to fully democratic
elections, opposition spokesmen said.
   In the past, only party-approved candidates were able to run for
Parliament.
   Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said opposition leaders
were willing to discuss with authorities the partially democratic
electoral system, which also would reserve a portion of seats for
candidates backed by the Communist Party.
   But they indicated it appeared acceptable only if other political
reforms were made, such as allowing access to the mass media,
ensuring independent courts and guaranteeing the right to form
associations.
   ``We would like the elections to be as open as possible, so that
for example Solidarity candidates could compete with government
candidates, but it seems that the government wants to avoid such
competition,'' Onyszkiewicz said at a news conference.
   ``The authorities expect our approval of an electoral procedure
proposed for the nearest elections that will not be 100 percent
democratic. And we did accept this principle,'' he said.
   He said the proposal was made at the latest talks between
authorities and opposition representatives on political and social
reforms in Poland.
   Jacek Kuron, a senior Solidarity adviser, said the opposition
also was told at the talks the proposed election procedure would be
a one-time proposition and that subsequent elections would be
totally democratic.
   But he cautioned, ``A declaration as such has no significance.
What is significant is (increasing) the broad democratic process''
through other political reforms, he said.
   Under the government proposal, each election district would have
two to five seats, and the opposition and authorities would decide
in advance which seats could be contested among independent
candidates and which would be reserved for officially backed
candidates.
   ``In comparison to what we have had, this is a great step forward
... It opens the road to political freedom,'' said Bronislaw
Geremek, chairman of the Solidarity side of the working group on
political reform.
   The breakdown between the two camps was not discussed Saturday,
Onyszkiewicz said. Party sources have said privately they envision a
system where 60 percent of the seats would be reserved for the party
and its allies, and 40 percent to independent candidates linked to
the Roman Catholic Church or Solidarity.
   Anyone who collected 5,000 signatures could run for Parliament,
but both sides would observe a ``gentleman's agreement'' not to run
in each other's districts, a high-ranking party source said.
   ``This is a very important, radical change in comparison with all
other election systems after the war. We treat this as a step to
additional changes in the future,'' said Janusz Reykowski, a
Politburo member who led the official side in Saturday's talks.
   The government proposal was the latest development in a two-week
series of talks between authorities and the opposition.
   So far, officials have agreed in principle to legalize the banned
Solidarity union under terms acceptable to it, to register the
banned farmers' group Rural Solidarity, to allow independent
organizations their own press and to ease censorship.
   Such concessions on the part of communist authorities would have
seemed impossible only one year ago.
   But in the all-or-nothing format laid down by Interior Minister
Czeslaw Kiszczak at the beginning of the talks Feb. 6, none of the
agreements will be valid unless the talks as a whole succeed.
   That means that Solidarity and authorities still must agree on an
economic program and on the political reforms.
   The unprecedented series of talks first were proposed by the
government during a wave of strikes in August that underscored
growing social tensions caused by 60-70 percent inflation and market
shortages.
   It is the first time since communism took hold in Eastern Europe
that party officials have held wide-ranging, formal negotiations
with independent elements of society over how the political and
economic system should be restructured.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
plans to meet PLO chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens during his visit to Cairo this week, Israel
radio and television reported Saturday.
   Shevardnadze, who unveiled a Soviet plan for peace in the Middle
East on Saturday, invited Arens to a Wednesday meeting and will
later meet Arafat, the television reported.
   A spokesman for Israel's Foreign Ministry refused comment on the
reports.
   But a government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the meeting with Arens and said the foreign minister will
leave Israel for Cairo on Monday.
   He could not confirm the meeting with Arafat.
   The head of Israel's consular delegation in Moscow, Arieh Levin,
was contacted by the Soviet Foreign Ministry as Shevardnadze began
planning his visit to the Middle East, the televison reported.
   Israeli officials quickly accepted the invitation.
   The planned meeting will be the second between Arens and
Shevardnadze. The two met in Paris last month during a conference on
chemical weapons.
   Shevardnadze's 10-day Middle East tour began Friday in Damascus
and includes stops in Iran, Iraq and Jordan in addition to Egypt and
Syria.
   The Soviet Union severed diplomatic relations with Israel in the
wake of the 1967 Middle East conflict.
   The two nations began to improve relations two years ago and
exchanged low-level consular delegations in July 1987.
   In Damascus on Saturday, Shevardnadze announced details of a
Middle East peace plan, saying his country will push the U.N.
Security Council to convene an international Middle East peace
conference.
   He said such a meeting should involve all the parties concerned,
including the PLO.
   He outlined a three-stage plan that he said should be carried out
within nine months.
   First, the foreign ministers of the Security Council should hold
a special session to discuss the issue. Second, the five permanent
members of the council _ the United States, the Soviet Union, China,
France and Britain _ should ``assume the function of a preparatory
body for the conference.''
   Third, the United Nations as a whole be used to help the parties
involved work out their differences.
   Israel has rejected the idea of an international conference, but
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has said that a U.S.-Soviet conference
or one sponsored by the United Nations could serve to bring Israel
and the Arab nations together.
   Israel has made the restoration of Soviet-Israeli relations a
condition for a Soviet role in peace talks.
   ``The Soviets understand that if they want to be a serious part
of the conflict they need contacts in Israel,'' the official said.
   Tuesday, the Director General of the Prime Minister's office,
Yosef Ben Aharon, urged Shevardnadze to visit Israel during his tour
of the Middle East.
   ``If the Soviet Union really wants to have a fresh look at the
Middle East... there is nothing like a first-hand look and direct
talks with our leaders,'' Ben Aharon told the Jerusalem Post daily
newspaper.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril has
reshuffled his Cabinet for the first time since he seized power in a
coup last year, an independent report said Saturday.
   The government named Col. Acedius Saint-Louis as the new defense
and interior minister and Augustin Romain Ceme as new justice
minister, according to radio Haiti-Inter.
   Saint-Louis was information minister under Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy,
who was ousted in the September coup. Saint-Louis had been denounced
as repressive by the presidential guardsmen who toppled the Namphy
dictatorship, and he was removed from his office at army
headquarters after the coup.
   Gilbert Austin, former minister of justice, was named president
of the Supreme Court of Appeals, the radio report said.
   The well-known opposition leader Daniel Narcisse was named
assistant commissioner of the newly-created Commission for Haitians
Abroad.
   But the most unpopular of Avril's ministers, including
Information Minister Anthony Virginie Saint-Pierre, remained in
office.
   Since the leak of an Information Ministry memorandum in January,
Saint-Pierre has been widely criticized.
   In his memorandum, Saint-Pierre said a peasant uprising, fomented
by popular organizations, was imminent and ``might have to be put
down with bloodshed.'' He recommended preventive measures.
   An opposition leader said Avril's shakeup should have gone
further.
   ``These are not the reforms we were asking for. We will keep on
asking until we get them,'' Serge Gilles, leader of the National
Progressive Revolutionary Party said.
   Last week, he demanded the ouster of what he views as
anti-democratic elements in the Cabinet, which has remained intact
since Avril was swept into power by a military coup on Sept. 17,
1988.
   Popular support for his government, which pledged to restore
democracy, has plummeted in the past month during a wave of
anti-government demonstrations and two general strikes.

<HEAD>With AM-Satanic Verses, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The decision by large bookstore chains to stop displaying or
selling ``The Satanic Verses'' triggered a buyers' frenzy and
shortages at independent stores, dealers said Saturday.
   ``We got in 25 copies yesterday; they were all reserved,'' said
John Evans, owner of Lemuria Bookstores in Jackson, Miss. ``I wish I
had been smart enough to order 150 _ I blew it.''
   ``I think the right honorable Khomeini is making a best seller
out of it,'' said Sam Weller, owner of the Zion Book Stores in Salt
Lake City, where neither the stores nor the public library could
keep the popular $19.95 novel on their shelves.
   ``Nobody bought it until they started hollering about it,''
agreed Howard Canada, owner of Howard's Bookstore in Bloomington,
Ind.
   The independents said their sales heated up after the Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini offered a bounty Tuesday for the killing of ``The
Satanic Verses'' author Salman Rushdie and his publishers.
   On Friday, the B. Dalton and Barnes &amp; Noble chains, which have
more than 1,250 stores, said they would pull the book from their
shelves, but a spokesman refused to say whether it would not be sold
at all or simply not displayed. Waldenbooks, the nation's largest
bookseller, directed its stores Thursday to remove the book from
shelves, but to sell it upon request.
   Rushdie apologized on Saturday, saying he regretted if the book
distressed ``sincere followers of Islam,'' but it was not clear
whether Iran would accept his remarks.
   Rebecca Morehouse, manager of a Waldenbooks store in San
Francisco, said the company's president told stores Saturday that
they may display the book if they don't feel threatened.
   She wanted to sell the book, but ``I'm just not going to wave it
like a red flag in front of a bull.'' Her store was out of stock and
awaiting a second printing.
   The small stores also couldn't get enough.
   ``Some of my customers called and wanted to buy it; they didn't
want to read it _ they just wanted to make a political statement,''
said Dave Unowsky, owner of the sold-out Hungry Mind bookstore in
St. Paul, Minn., and a board member of the American Booksellers
Association.
   ``We've gotten hundreds of the requests in the past hundreds of
days,'' said an employee, who identified himself only as Pat, at New
York City's Coliseum bookstore. He said the store had sold 155
copies since the end of December, with the ``big sales'' starting
two weeks ago.
   ``When the book was first published, we got 50 or 60 copies and
sold them immediately; yesterday, by 1 o'clock, we had over 50 phone
requests,'' said Fred Bass, owner of the Strand bookstore in New
York City.
   ``There's been tremendous demand since Wednesday and there's no
way I can get more. I've already had a call from somebody who
offered me $40 for a copy,'' said Bass.
   ``I think you'll start seeing first editions on the market very
quickly. $50 to $75,'' said Evans. ``I'm talking about 30 days, 60
days.''
   Even if the apology is accepted, ``I think it will still be
popular,'' Bass said.
   Readers who want to judge ``The Satanic Verses'' for themselves
also have been snapping up the Koran, said Bass. The Strand, which
normally sells about 10 copies of the Koran a week, has sold about
200 in the last 10 days.
   Meanwhile, authors Norman Mailer, Gay Talese, E.L. Doctorow,
Susan Sontag and Robert Stone planned a public reading Wednesday in
New York City of selections from ``The Satanic Verses'' and other
Rushdie writings.
   Unlike the big chains, small bookstores expressed little fear of
retribution for selling ``The Satanic Verses.''
   ``I did instruct the staff to take it out of the window on
Thursday ... for fear of a brick being thrown,'' said Philip Lyman,
manager of the Gotham bookstore in New York City, which has sold out.
   ``We've had no threats, but Viking had called us and told us not
to display it in our window,'' said the Coliseum employee.
   ``We've had some complaints, with people threatening to boycott
the store,'' but no threats of violence, said Matt Miller, manager
of the Tattered Cover in Denver.
   ``There is a question of safety, obviously, especially on the
East Coast,'' said Kevin Morrisey, an employee at the St. Paul
bookstore. ``But we haven't had any threats. If there are any
fundamentalist Muslims in this area, I'm not aware of them.''
   ``Nah,'' said Evans when asked if he feared Moslem retribution.
``In Mississippi?''

   More than a foot of snow fell Saturday over parts of the
Northwest and the middle Atlantic Coast, canceling airline flights,
closing one highway with an avalanche and shutting down weekend
sporting events.
   Elsewhere, rivers flooded by five days of rain slowly receded in
Kentucky and Tennessee, where hundreds of people were evacuated from
their homes.
   At least 15 traffic deaths were blamed on stormy weather
beginning Friday.
   By midday, up to 14 inches of snow had fallen on northern North
Carolina in Warren and Stokes counties, and at historic
Williamsburg, Va., the National Weather Service said. Norfolk, Va.,
had 11.2 inches, second highest on record there for February. In the
Northwest, Spokane, Wash., had 13 inches.
   Sleet and freezing rain coated other parts of Virginia and the
Carolinas with ice, and scattered power outages were reported in
upstate South Carolina, the weather service said. About 23,000
people lost power in North Carolina, Duke Power Co. officials said.
   Despite about a foot of snow, Patrick Henry Airport at Newport
News, Va., remained technically open although all airlines operating
at the airport canceled their flights, said executive director Peter
Daikos.
   ``I would suspect we had 200 people stranded,'' Daikos said.
   Elsewhere in Virginia, Saturday classes at Norfolk State
University were canceled, said school spokesman Gerald Tyler, and a
number of college basketball games were postponed.
   ``The roads in the southern half of the state are pretty bad,''
said state police Sgt. N.W. Hampton in Richmond. ``It's still
snowing and they're covered with snow.''
   The snow and icy roads in North Carolina arrived just two days
after the state basked in 80-degree weather. Schools across the
state closed early Friday.
   ``Wrecks are coming in from every which direction, and my rescue
crews tell me that roads are really slick out there,'' said Bobby
Norville, an emergency communications dispatcher in Pitt County.
   Most North Carolina ski resorts had to close in the past two
weeks, but the return of cold air Friday meant snow-making machinery
could run full blast.
   Duke Power sent 200 extra workers to help local repair crews
working to reconnect power lines torn down by ice or falling tree
limbs, said spokeswoman Anne Sheffield. She had no estimate of when
power would be restored.
   Steady snow fell Saturday on the eastern two-thirds of Washington
state as the most severe snowstorm to hit the state this winter
slowed traffic to a crawl.
   U.S. 2 near Stevens Pass, Wash., was closed for about two hours
during the night after an avalanche dumped about 4 feet of snow over
the highway. Hours earlier, at least 35 cars were involved in a
pile-up in blinding snow on Interstate 90 about five miles east of
North Bend.
   Up to 9 inches of snow fell at higher elevations of eastern
Tennessee, attracting thousands to the mountain resort town of
Gatlinburg.
   ``The town is booked pretty well solid since it's a three-day
holiday weekend,'' said Jim Ahrends, a salesman for the Ober
Gatlinburg Ski Resort.
   ``We were kind of looking forward to having snow. We woke up this
morning and there it was,'' said Tami Saade, 28, of Atlanta, who
spent part of Saturday afternoon sipping brandied coffee with a
friend by a fire in the resort lounge.
   In western Tennessee, Tennessee Emergency Management Agency
workers were in Obion County assessing the damage caused by flooding
there earlier in the week. After five days of rain, Saturday was dry.
   Nearly 400 people were forced from their homes when the Obion
River spilled over its banks in the heart of the Tennessee wheat
belt.
   The first estimates by federal officials pegged Kentucky's flood
damage at $22 million, but the Army's top engineer, Robert W. Page,
assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, said Saturday that
was ``only the tip of the iceberg.''
   Five shelters remained open around Kentucky, housing 142 people,
said spokesman Don Armstrong of the state Division of Disaster and
Emergency Services, and 184 state-maintained roads in 54 counties
remained blocked by high water.
   The Kentucky River at Frankfort had dropped 4 feet since cresting
Friday at 44.2 feet _ 13.2 feet above flood stage.
   Streams in southern Ohio also receded after flash flooding.
   A rain-slickened highway in Texas was blamed for an accident in
which a bus rolled over and killed four people and injured 20. And
three traffic deaths in Washington state and four in North Carolina
were blamed on the snow. Four members of one family died Friday in
Texas when their van plunged into a swollen stream. Snow sent a
school bus sliding down an embankment Friday in North Carolina but
no injuries were reported..

<HEAD>Hungary's Writers Protest Havel Trial; Romanian Refugees Freed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The official Hungarian Writers' Union
has protested the jailing of Czech playwright and activist Vaclav
Havel, Hungary's official news agency said Saturday.
   MTI said the Writers' Union expressed its ``anxiety'' in a letter
to Czech Ambassador Vlastimil Ehrenberger.
   Havel goes on trial in Prague on Tuesday on charges of incitement
and obstructing the duty of a public official. He could face up to
2{ years in jail if convicted.
   Havel was arrested Jan. 16 after he and eight other dissidents,
to be tried in another Prague court on Tuesday, laid flowers in
memory of Jan Palach, a student who burned himself to death to
protest the Soviet-led invasion that ended the so-called Prague
Spring reforms of 1968.
   It was believed to be the first time an official Writers' Union
has written an allied government of the Warsaw Pact protesting
treatment of a dissident.
   The United States and Britain on Friday called for Havel's
release and the release of the eight other activists.
   Also Saturday, a dozen ethnic Hungarians from Romania who took
refuge in the Hungarian Embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria, in September
arrived in Hungary after Bulgaria agreed to let them emigrate, MTI
said.
   The 12 defected while on a tourist trip to Bulgaria last year and
sought refuge at the Hungarian Embassy on Sept. 14, where they
remained until Friday.
   In a report from Sofia, MTI said Bulgarian authorities accepted a
proposal by the Geneva-based International Red Cross ``for
humanitarian considerations.''
   The involvement of three Soviet bloc countries in a political
refugee case was unprecedented and came at a time when
Hungarian-Romanian relations have been severely strained over
Romania's alleged discrimination against 1.7 million ethnic
Hungarians.
   In another development, families of Hungary's leaders executed
after the 1956 anti-communist revolt have decided to rebury the
leaders in marked graves on June 16, the anniversary of their
execution in 1958, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   Last month, the Hungarian government agreed to allow the
exhumation from unmarked graves and the reburial of the country's
leader during the uprising, Imre Nagy, and his associates.
   The government daily Magyar Hirlap Saturday quoted Janos Veszi,
Nagy's son-in-law, as saying the reburial date has formally been
submitted to the Ministry of Justice.
   The ruling Communist party at a Central Committee meeting last
week partially reassessed the 1956 revolt after Imre Pozsgay, a
leading reformer in the leadership, said it was a popular uprising
rather than a counter-revolution as it had been officially termed
for 32 years.
   The communist leadership reached a compromise formulation on the
events, saying they featured both popular and counterrevolutionary
elements.

<HEAD>Report Says Companies Delivered Equipment For Pakistan Nuke Production</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German companies have delivered
equipment to Pakistan for years that can be used to make nuclear
weapons, a magazine reported Saturday.
   Der Spiegel said West German companies delivered machinery and
technology to Pakistan that was ``adapted'' to the nation's nuclear
energy and weapons development program.
   The Hamburg-based magazine, in a telex to other news media
Saturday, said the equipment ranged from tooling equipment to
technology capable of processing tritium gas, used to enhance
nuclear weapons.
   Der Spiegel said many of the exports were made with government
approval though the magazine said U.S. officials contended the
machinery could be used to make parts for nuclear warheads.
   Der Spiegel said customs officials only learned later that the
machinery was used in nuclear research and development.
   The magazine said the Nuclear Reasearch Center in Karlsruhe, of
which the government owns a controlling interest, also delivered
equipment to Pakistan and trained Pakistani researchers.
   In its telex, Der Spiegel did not name the companies allegedly
involved in the exports.
   The magazine said U.S. officials asked West German officials for
years to help prevent Pakistan from developing nuclear weapons.
Pakistan has said its nuclear research has only been for energy
purposes.
   West German companies have also been linked to development of a
suspected poison gas factory in Libya.
   The government has said it plans to implement tough new export
rules to prevent the export of equipment and materials that could be
used to make chemical or nuclear weapons.

<HEAD>Ice And Heavy Snow Over virginia And Carolinas, Washington</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy snow fell Saturday over the central Atlantic Coast and the
Northwest, while light snow fell over the northern Plains.
   A low-pressure system off the coast of North Carolina circulated
moisture from the Atlantic back over Virginia and the Carolinas,
producing ice and heavy snow.
   Winter storm warnings were posted for upstate South Carolina,
western and northern North Carolina, and south-central and eastern
Virginia.
   By midday, Norfolk, Va., had 11.2 inches of snow, the second
highest total on record there for February. Up to 14 inches of snow
had fallen at Williamsburg, Va., and in northern North Carolina's
Warren and Stokes counties.
   Sleet and freezing rain coated other parts of Virginia and the
Carolinas, and ice accumulating on branches and power lines caused
scattered power outages in the Carolinas.
   In the Northwest, steady snow fell Saturday on the eastern
two-thirds of Washington state as the most severe snowstorm to hit
the state this winter slowed traffic to a crawl, especially in
mountain passes. Spokane, Wash., had 13 inches of new snow.
   A winter storm warning was posted throughout the night for the
central mountains and northern panhandle of Idaho, where up to 8
inches of snow was possible.
   Light snow fell was over parts of Minnesota, South Dakota,
Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin.
   Rain fell over the northern and central Pacific Coast region, and
over the central Gulf Coast states.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 6
degrees below zero at Glasgow and Havre, Mont., to 84 at Fort Myers,
Fla. Saturday morning's low for the Lower 48 states was 33 degrees
below zero at Hibbing, Minn.
   For Sunday, snow was forecast from the western Rockies to the
middle Mississippi Valley. Scattered snow showers were forecast over
the Northeast. Rain was forecast over the northern Pacific Coast,
with scattered showers across the central Pacific Coast. Widely
scattered showers were forecast over south-central Texas and the
Southeast.
   Highs remaining below freezing were predicted from eastern
Washington state through Nebraska and the Dakotas to New England,
with highs only in the teens from northern Montana to northern
Minnesota, and over northern Maine; above 50 from the coast of
California through the southern Plains to the southern Atlantic
Coast; in the 70s in the desert Southwest; and in the 70s and lower
80s across the Florida Peninsula.

   A man facing execution won his fourth
stay in a week Saturday, just seven hours before he was scheduled to
die for the 1983 sex-slaying of an Orlando woman, court and state
officials said.
   Anthony Bertolotti's execution, which had been set for 7:01 p.m.
Saturday, was immediately rescheduled after Paul Roney, chief judge
of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, extended a
stay a three-judge panel had issued Friday afternoon.
   The state reset the execution for 7:01 a.m. Tuesday, one minute
after the 60-hour extension expires, according to Jon Peck, a
spokesman for Gov. Bob Martinez.
   Bertolotti was originally set to die last Wednesday morning, but
he won a 24-hour stay from a federal judge in Orlando and then an
additional 24-hour stay from the 11th Circuit. After each stay, the
state rescheduled the execution.
   The latest death warrant, Bertolotti's second, is effective until
Wednesday morning. Bertolotti survived his first death warrant when
the state Supreme Court stayed his exectution in late 1987.
   Florida has executed 20 men since the state resumed capital
punishment in 1979.
   On Jan. 24, Florida executed Ted Bundy for the 1978 slaying of a
12-year-old Lake City girl. In the days before his death, Bundy
confessed to about two dozen slayings of young women in the western
United States.
   Saturday's extension was granted so the full appeals court could
be polled at the request of the Florida Office of the Capital
Collateral Representative, the state agency which represents most
indigent death-row inmates. The state agency's motion asked that the
full court reconsider Friday's decision by the three-judge panel to
deny Bertolotti's appeal.
   Bertolotti, 36, was sentenced in 1984 to die in the electric
chair at Florida State Prison near Starke for the stabbing death of
Carol Ward, 46.
   Bob Macmaster, a spokesman for the state Department of
Corrections, said Bertolotti met with three attorneys Saturday
morning.
   The governor had been in Atlanta en route to Europe for a trade
mission, but after the stay was issued he put his trip off until
Tuesday and returned to Tallahassee, Peck said. Martinez could give
the execution order by telephone from Atlanta or Europe, but thought
it more appropriate that he be in Tallahassee, Peck said.
   According to trial evidence, which included two recorded
confessions, Bertolotti was walking through an Orlando neighborhood
on Sept. 27, 1983, when he saw Ms. Ward carrying groceries into her
home.
   Bertolotti said he persuaded her to let him into the house by
asking to use the telephone. He grabbed a knife, robbed her of $30,
raped her and stabbed her 14 times in the chest and stomach.
   Bertolotti wrote several letters to prosecutors after his
conviction saying ``I have no regrets or sorrows for the murder of
Carol Ward.''
   Appeal attorneys contended Bertolotti's trial lawyers were
negligent because they did not have an expert determine his sanity
before trial.
   The slaying occurred less than a year after Bertolotti's release
from prison, where he served three years of a seven-year term for
aggravated assault.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze said Saturday his country will press the U.N. Security
Council to convene an international conference to try to resolve the
Middle East conflict.
   Shevardnadze, who began a 10-day Middle East tour Friday,
unveiled the Soviet proposals at a dinner following a six-hour
meeting with President Hafez Assad.
   ``It is our profound conviction that favorable prerequisites are
now in place for movement toward convening an international
conference to be attended by all parties concerned, including the
PLO and five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council,''
Shevardnadze said in his lengthy toast.
   In response, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Al-Sharaa said his
country welcomed a Middle East peace conference under U.N. auspices
and accused Israel of blocking it.
   ``It is one of the most bizarre wonders that the more the Arabs
advance toward the peace choice, Israel progresses toward the choice
of war and aggression,'' Al-Sharaa said.
   He said the PLO should participate and ``it is only natural that
such a conference will result in Israel's withdrawal from all the
occupied territories'' and an independent state for the Palestinians.
   Israel television and radio said Saturday Shevardnadze would hold
separate meetings with Foreign Minister Moshe Arens and PLO leader
Yasser Arafat during a visit to Egypt this week.
   Israel refuses to speak to the Palestine Liberation Organization,
which it calls a terrorist group.
   Arafat was quoted as saying by a Rome newspaper a week ago that
the PLO has had indirect contacts with the Israelis. On Saturday, he
said the contacts dealt with achieving a truce in southern Lebanon,
where Israeli troops have clashed with Palestinian guerrillas.
   ``I'm saying they (the Israelis) are asking for a truce,'' Arafat
said during taping of the CBS television news show ``60 Minutes.''
He said the intermediaries included Palestinians in Israeli-occupied
territories, Europeans and U.N. personnel. His remarks were
contained in a transcript released by the network.
   Shevardnadze's plan _ which he said should be carried out in the
next six to nine months _ includes an initial meeting of the foreign
ministers of the U.N. Security Council.
   He said the council's five permanent members then should contact
the parties involved and ``assume the function of a preparatory body
for the conference.'' Permanent members are Britain, China, France,
the Soviet Union and the United States.
   While the rest of the world moves toward disarmament,
Shevardnadze said, the Middle East is marked by an escalating arms
race, including ``such weapons of mass destruction as nuclear arms
and chemical weapons.''
   He said it was ``indisputable that an equitable settlement cannot
be attained without unity among the Arab countries,'' adding he
would be happy to host a meeting of representatives from Syria,
Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon and the PLO.
   ``It is also important to strengthen the link of
Syrian-Palestinian interaction,'' he said.
   Syria is the Soviet Union's most important ally in the region,
and Arab media reported earlier that Shevardnadze's visit may lead
to a reconciliation between Assad and Arafat.
   The London-based Lebanese daily Al-Hayat said Arafat might visit
Damascus after Soviet mediation. But it said Arafat set several
conditions, including the release of up to 2,000 Palestinian
detainees in Syria.
   Arafat and Assad have been at odds since 1983, when the Syrian
leader began backing Palestinian groups trying to oust Arafat. And
Syria has been at odds with other Arab nations since it backed Iran
in the 8-year-old gulf war against Iraq.
   Shevardnadze's visit came two days after the Soviet withdrawal
from Afghanistan, where their battle against Moslem rebels was
unpopular among Arabs.
   The peace proposal is the first major Soviet attempt in years to
help settle the Arab-Israeli dispute.
   Shevardnadze also plans visits to Jordan, Cairo, Iraq, and Iran
before returning to Moscow on Feb. 27.

   Fire gutted the state penitentiary's main
dining hall, and officials served prisoners in their cells Saturday,
authorities said.
   One correctional officer and one inmate were treated for smoke
inhalation, but no one was seriously injured in Friday night's fire,
said prison Warden Tom Powers.
   The fire also damaged some fencing and ``we do have some security
concerns,'' Powers said. ``We'll take whatever temporary security
precautions we need.''
   He said officials assume the cause of the fire was electrical.
   No prisoners were in the building when the blaze broke out,
Powers said. The three-story building housed a chapel, recreation
room and the prison's main kitchen and dining area, but had no
cells, the warden said.
   Powers said 185 of the 450 inmates were moved from their cells in
another building to avoid smoke, and 30 to 35 inmates were not able
to immediately return to their cells Saturday. There were no reports
of discipline problems.
   ``The inmates here have been very mature,'' he said.
   National Guard units helped set up a tent kitchen, which will
serve as the meal preparation area until a permanent structure can
be built, Powers said.
   Damage estimates were not immediately available, but prison
officials said earlier plans to raze and replace the 79-year-old
building had estimated the project's cost at $6.07 million.

<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with De Mita speech; adds byline</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Premier Ciriaco De Mita asked his party for a vote of
confidence in his leadership on Saturday as Christian Democrats
prepared to to replace him as party chief.
   Arnaldo Forlani was expected to be chosen to replace De Mita as
party secretary, considered by many the most powerful political
position in Italy. The choice could possibly endanger De Mita's
10-month-old government.
   De Mita, a leader of his party's left wing, called on party
leaders to avoid making the Christian Democrats a ``party of
conservatism'' and make it instead a broad-based, popular party.
   ``It is not at all a personal issue but a political question
because the weakening, or worse, the collapse of the role of
governing assumed by the Christian Democrats could create a much
worse problem than the failure of a Cabinet,'' De Mita said in a
three-hour speech opening the party's 18th congress this weekend.
   De Mita also called Saturday for support for his government's
programs to reduce the public deficit, improve the environment and
enact reform in Italy's political system.
   The Christian Democrats are the country's largest political party
and have been the main force in Italy's postwar politics. The party,
which dominates the five-member governing coalition, has enormous
influence in the shape and success of government programs.
   De Mita insisted on remaining party leader when he assumed the
premiership last April, arguing it provided the government with
much-needed stability. But other leaders have charged that too much
power is concentrated in the premier's hands.
   Forlani, 64, the only candidate for party secretary, served as
Italy's premier in 1980-81 and as Christian Democrat secretary from
1969-73.
   For several weeks, De Mita had backed other candidates in party
wrangling over his successor. However, Forlani had overwhelming
support from the centrist faction of the party, which controls about
a third of the 1,312 delegates, and from Giulio Andreotti, who
foreign minister and De Mita rival who controls about 20 percent of
the delegates.
   Several newspapers said Saturday that the Forlani nomination
could spell the end of De Mita's government.
   ``Already the De Mita phase is coming to its conclusion and the
government will have rather the physiognomy of a government waiting
to be definitely retired,'' the Rome-based La Repubblica said in a
front-page editorial.
   Many of Italy's 47 postwar governments have been brought down by
division among Christian Democrats, even when premiers were from the
party.
   The Christian Democrats currently rule in a coalition with the
Socialists, Liberals, Republicans and Social Democrats.
   Forlani was expected to address the congress Sunday. Although he
is the only candidate for party secretary, he does not automatically
win the post. If he does not get enough votes, delegates can
consider other candidates.

   A predominantly Polish Catholic Church
was closed indefinitely Saturday hours after the city's bishop
summoned police to evict dissident parishioners who had occupied the
church for a week.
   A spokesman said Bishop Edward M. Egan had no other choice but to
suspend services at St. Michael the Archangel Church. On Friday
afternoon, about 100 dissidents shouted down Roman Catholic diocesan
officials who came to the church to convey Egan's offer to meet with
them if they would leave peacefully.
   ``They were beginning to get unruly,'' said Monsignor Nicholas V.
Grieco. ``It became impossible to have services conducted there in a
way that would be reverential.''
   About 200 dissident parishioners, occupying the church in shifts,
staged a weeklong sit-in to protest the transfer announced in
December of a popular priest brought from Poland three years ago.
Regular church functions have continued during the protest.
   They had vowed to maintain their vigil until church officials
agreed to return the Polish priest, the Rev. Roman Palaszewski, to
the parish and remove the church's current pastor, the Rev. John
Bambol.
   But the standoff ended abruptly early Saturday morning when
police arrived and ordered the roughly 80 dissidents present to
leave. Two people were arrested on trespassing charges; the rest
left voluntarily.
   ``How can they tell me I was trespassing in my own church?'' said
Henry Chmiel, 35, one of those arrested.
   ``The new bishop stinks,'' Chmiel said. ``How can you call the
police on the parishioners?'' Children in the church cried, and
several men shouted ``Nazi Germany!'' as the protest was ending.
   The dissidents, many of them recent Polish immigrants, accuse
Bambol of engineering Palaszewski's removal because he was too
active in the Polish community. Some say they are upset by Bambol's
effort to open the church, located in a largely Hispanic section of
Bridgeport, to ethnic groups other than Poles.
   ``I've never seen anything like it in all my life,'' Frank
Dabrowski, a parishioner for 26 years, said as he left the church
Saturday morning. ``They don't even do that in Communist countries.''
   During the afternoon, about 80 dissidents huddled in the cold in
front of the locked church while six police officers stood guard.
   The dissident leaders issued two statements. In the first, a
letter to Pope John Paul II, they appealed for his intervention and
denounced Egan, accusing him of ``destroying the parish.''
   ``We feel very depressed and humiliated,'' the letter said. ``Now
we are left without our church and our priest. Please advise us,
where do we go now?''
   The protest leaders said they did not know what form their
struggle would take now. Many said they would not attend any church
services tomorrow, saying they felt betrayed by the church.
   ``How can I go to church,'' asked Chmiel. ``That's not a church
now. I'd rather stay here and pray in the house.''
   Grieco said the decision to summon police was made by the church
corporation, a board that includes the bishop and Bambol.
   Two days of negotiations between dissident leaders and church
hierarchy failed to resolve the crisis.
   Palaszewski himself pleaded with parishioners to leave the church
after Mayor Thomas Bucci arrived with 40 police officers. He was
shouted down by a chorus of ``Nos.''
   Palaszewki came to the church after an earlier, angry
confrontation between the dissidents and church officials. The
shouting incident resulted when the Rev. Laurence R. Bronkiewicz,
the Diocese of Bridgeport's vicar for clergy, asked the dissidents
to leave St. Michael.
   Some of the dissidents began crying, others shouted insults,
while cries of ``Liars!'' and ``Speak to our people!'' rang through
the church.
   Church leaders, apparently surprised by the hostile reaction,
hurried to a back room and closed the door. One parishioner followed
them and angrily beat on the door. Later, church leaders and
dissidents resumed their talks, but no settlement was reached.
   Palaszewski's five-year contract was terminated in December after
three years without explanation by joint agreement between
Franciscan officals in Baltimore and Poland.

   Moderate Afghan groups are pushing for
the restoration of Afghanistan's last king as the only way to avoid
a bloody struggle between rival guerrilla groups.
   But powerful fundamentalist parties among Moslem guerrillas
fighting the Afghan government say they will never allow the return
of the monarchy.
   King Zahir Shah, who was deposed in 1973, is the only Afghan
leader who enjoys broad support that cuts across party, tribal and
ethnic lines, according to some Afghan exiles and analysts.
   The 74-year-old king, who lives in exile in Rome, is the one
figure who may be able to unite a majority of Afghans in the deeply
divided nation, they say.
   ``People think the king is the only person who can command the
support of the entire nation and form the broadest possible
government,'' said Akbar Nakiyar, an official of the moderate Afghan
National Liberation Front.
   Calls for the king's return have gained urgency since the Soviets
ended their nine-year intervention in Afghanistan last week by
pulling out the last of their troops.
   Guerrilla commanders say the weak Afghan communist government
cannot survive long, and they are preparing to take over.
   Zahir Shah has strong support among many Afghans who remember his
liberal rule as benign and progressive, analysts said. The king is
also deeply respected as a modest man, they said.
   A 1988 study by the Afghan Information Center indicated up to 70
percent of Afghans would support the return of Zahir Shah.
   Crowds of up to 50,000 Afghan refugees have taken part in
demonstrations in Pakistan in recent months to support the return of
the monarch, guerrilla officials say. Hard-line guerrillas with
clubs broke up one such demonstration in early February in Peshawar.
   Zahir Shah, who has lived for years in seclusion at a villa in
Rome, said recently that he was willing to return to help rebuild
Afghanistan.
   ``Now that the Afghan nation is about to achieve the aims of its
heroic struggle, I wish to reiterate yet again that I am prepared to
render, without any claim or precondition, any service to my country
which would reflect the will of the majority of my compatriots,'' he
said.
   Najib, the president of the Soviet-supported government in Kabul,
said Friday he had sent emissaries to Rome to sound out the king. A
spokesman for the king, General Abdul Wali, denied that Saturday,
saying: ``We have not received anyone from Kabul ... and we don't
expect to receive anyone soon.''
   Support for the king has increased as the seven main guerrilla
parties, long bitter rivals, have feuded over power and territory,
analysts say. Critics charge some guerrilla leaders are intent on
grabbing power rather than safeguarding the interests of the Afghan
people.
   ``Afghans want a leader who will represent the nation's interests
and not be selfishly fighting for power,'' said Naim Majrooh, head
of the Afghan Information Center. ``There is no other focal point
that everybody can agree on.''
   Afghanistan could be plunged into new conflict if the rival
guerrilla groups oust the communist government and then compete for
power.
   ``There would be a civil war if the political parties impose a
government on the Afghan people. The Russians found that out,'' said
Homayoun Assef, a cousin of Zahir Shah.
   The king would have to mount a drive for support if he wants to
return to Afghanistan, analysts said. Whether he is willing to do so
is not clear, they said.
   Of the seven main parties that make up the guerrilla alliance,
four are considered hard-line groups and they strongly oppose the
king. The three moderate factions say his return is a possibility
that must be considered.
   Hardliners say royalty is no longer a viable means of government.
   ``The king is a part of Afghan history. You can't go back. Zahir
Shah is part of the past,'' said Abdul Hadi Arghandehwal, of the
Hezbi-i-Islmai faction.
   Fundamentalists charge the king was under communist control
because he supported modern, secular reforms in the poor and
backward central Asian nation.
   Hard-line parties trace their roots to fundamentalist groups that
opposed the king and then his nephew, Mohammad Daoud, who seized
power in a 1973 palace coup. Daoud, who declared a republic, was
toppled and killed when communists seized power in a 1978 coup.
   Some members of the moderate guerrilla parties openly support the
return of Zahir Shah. Others say the monarchy should not be restored
but that Zahir Shah should come back as the acting head of state.
   Other guerrilla officials say support for Zahir Shah is based on
nostalgia for the peaceful days before the civil war began in 1978.
The country has changed enormously since then and the traditional
society on which royalist rule was based has disappeared forever,
they said.

   The couple had been in Canada for a week where Sakharov received
a humanitarian award Friday night from the St. Boniface Hospital
Research Foundation. Sakharov received the $20,000 award in
Winnipeg, Canada.
   The Boston visit was to give Sakharov and his wife a chance to
see their grandchildren in suburban Newton before returning to
Moscow, said Efrem Yankelevich, who is married to Bonner's daughter,
Tatiana.
   ``As far as I know he does not intend to make any public
appearances. He will be here I don't know how long but probably just
for a few days and then he goes back to Moscow,'' Yankelevich said.
   Two of Bonner's children live in Boston suburbs.
   Sakharov, who won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his human rights
activities, left the Soviet Union earlier this month, visiting Italy
before going to Canada.
   He visited the United States for four weeks last fall, his first
visit to the West. He came as a Soviet delegate to the International
Foundation for the Survival and Development of Humanity, an
organization formed last year by Soviet and American scientists to
foster cooperation on arms control, hunger, pollution and other
issues.
   Bonner did not accompany her husband last fall but has made
previous visits alone to the United States.
   Sakharov, who helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb, previously
was barred from traveling abroad because of his past scientific work.

   AFL-CIO leaders hold their annual meeting this
week united in hoping for improved relations with the White House
but divided over what labor must do to improve its standing in the
workplace.
   The weeklong gathering in Bal Harbour, Fla., will feature the
first meeting between the federation's Executive Council and new
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole. Union officials are looking to begin
on a better note with the Bush administration after turbulent
relations in the Reagan era.
   ``Mine will be a message of cooperation,'' Mrs. Dole said last
week. She said she would encourage improved labor-management
relations and promise to listen to the concerns of unions.
   That would be an improvement over the first meeting between the
35-member Executive Council and Reagan's first labor secretary,
Raymond Donovan.
   The labor leaders and Donovan clashed over Reagan's economic
plans after their first meeting. Six months later Reagan fired
striking air traffic controllers, effectively killing their union
and permanently damaging the administration's standing with labor.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland has been cautious in assessing
the prospects for warmed up relations between the federation and the
White House.
   ``I hope so, more I can't say,'' he said recently.
   Mrs. Dole will not be the only visitor from the nation's capital.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, plans to be on
hand and new Democratic National Committee Chairman Ronald Brown has
been invited to speak to the AFL-CIO's poltical committee.
   The planned unveiling of a key report, ``The Evolution of Work,''
however, has been delayed because of internal disagreements over
organizing tactics. Release of the report was to have been a
highlight of the meeting.
   Instead, Secretary-Treasurer Thomas Donahue will offer the
council a closed-door, verbal update on the status of the report,
now scheduled for release at the AFL-CIO's May convention in
Washington.
   Kirkland recently offered a brief sketch of the topics to be
covered in the report, including developing of new benefit programs,
such as cut-rate credit cards and legal services, designed to lure
into unions workers who now are covered by collective bargaining but
are not dues-paying members of unions.
   ``Some of the things we are trying may not work, but that tells
us something too,'' Kirkland said. ``Then we try something else.''
   Recent Labor Department figures show that while union membership
climbed slightly in 1988 the percentage of the workforce that is
unionized has dropped to about 16 percent _ meaning that labor is
not bringing in new members to match the rapid growth of the
workforce.
   To counter that, Kirkland said labor must do a better job of
organizing workers in service industries, the fastest-growing
segment of the economy.
   The first day of the meeting, Monday, will focus on domestic
policy, including the release by the Executive Council of its
positions on a number of major bills to be considered by the
Congress this year.
   That agenda includes an increased minimum wage, child care and
parental leave legislation as well as tighter restrictions on drug
testing and new protections for workers in nuclear facilities.
   Labor leaders also are lobbying heavily for restrictions on
leveraged buyouts, which they blame for massive layoffs because of
the debt assumed by most buyers in such transactions.
   Owen Bieber, president of the United Auto Workers, when asked
recently about labor's position on the buyouts, compared it to New
Deal restrictions on business.
   ``Franklin Roosevelt didn't put strict controls on business
activities during the Great Depression because he hated business,''
Bieber said. ``He did it because the business leaders of that time
completely defaulted on their responsibilities.''
   ``He said they had been indicted in the court of public
opinion,'' he said. ``Well, so have the Wall Street bloodsuckers of
the 1980s. And they should be driven from the temple.''
   While making its case in the national political debate, there
will be little to settle at this meeting concerning internal AFL-CIO
politics.
   Kirkland said last month that he will seek another two-year term
at the May convention, quashing rumors he might announce his
retirement, a move that would have set off jockeying among potential
challengers to Donahue, Kirkland's heir-apparent, and those with an
eye on Donahue's current post.
   ``I do not intend to quit,'' Kirkland said at a late January
meeting with reporters. ``The decision on my future in this
organization is in the best possible hands: God and the delegates.''

   A British oil tanker collided
with a fishing boat on the North Sea early Saturday, and five Danish
fishermen were missing and presumed dead, a Dutch Coast Guard
spokesman said.
   Four Dutch rescue boats and a Dutch Navy helicopter found nothing
but wreckage, a small oil spill and an empty life raft of the
Danish-registered trawler Hanne Gasberg, according to spokesman,
Cees van Dijk.
   ``Chances of there being any survivors are virtually nil,'' Van
Dijk told The Associated Press.
   He added the search was called off six hours after the accident,
which occurred in high winds and pre-dawn darkness 23 miles off this
North Sea port.
   The 13,000-ton tanker British Beach simply ``overran'' the small
fishing trawler, Van Dijk said, adding that an investigation into
the cause of accident was to begin Sunday.
   The British-flagged tanker was en route from the port of Klaipeda
in Soviet Lithuania to Antwerp with a cargo of oil.
   The Danish ship was based in the port of Esbjerg, but left the
Dutch port of Scheveningen early Saturday on a fishing run, Van Dijk
said.

<HEAD>Government Boosts Estimates of Radioactive Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has increased by one-third its
estimate of how much radiation an uranium processing plant has
released into the environment over the last 38 years.
   The U.S. Department of Energy said that 88,000 more pounds of
uranium and 16,100 more pounds of thorium, an uranium substitute,
had been released than previously estimated since the 1951 opening
of the Feed Materials Production Center in nearby Fernald.
   A firm estimate of emissions from the plant is needed from its
owner, the Energy Department, before the start of a health study by
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. The government now estimates
297,000 pounds of uranium and 17,590 pounds of thorium were released.
   The Fernald plant has been the subject of intense scrutiny by
Congress and the press because of contamination problems and
allegations that its radioactive and chemical discharges may have
harmed people who live and work nearby. The plant processes uranium
for the U.S. nuclear weapons program.
   Environmentalists said they doubt the department ever will know
how much pollution escaped from Fernald, 18 miles northeast of
Cincinnati.
   ``This makes 175 metric tons, but that's just one more step along
a long, long road,'' said Arjun Makhijani, an environmental
consultant for Fernald-area residents in a lawsuit against the plant.
   The Energy Department quietly made the new estimates public in a
news release last week, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported Saturday. A
preliminary plant emission estimate was presented in a congressional
hearing last October.
   ``It raises a real concern,'' said Len Weiss, staff director of
the U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, which is led by
U.S. Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio. ``Every time they look at things, the
numbers go up again.''
   Steven Wyatt of the Energy Department's Oak Ridge, Tenn., office,
called the new data a significant increase. ``I can only say that
we're doing our best to fine tune this data,'' he said. ``We still
don't have final numbers.''
   Robert Walker, spokesman for Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio,
which operates the Fernald plant for the department, acknowledged
the significance of the revised estimate.
   ``There's no question it's a chunk,'' Walker said. ``But, `Oh, my
God,' isn't an appropriate reaction from our point of view. We're
trying to uncover every possible emission from this plant over the
37 years it's been here, and this is one more that's been tracked
down.''
   In a related Fernald development, a workers compensation finding
that blamed work-related radiation for the fatal liver cancer of an
engineer at the plant has been appealed by Westinghouse.
   Westinghouse, which took over the management of the plant from
NLO Inc. in 1986, asked Hamilton County Common Pleas Court last week
to overturn the state agency's decision. The ruling is the only one
to officially link a death with radioactive contamination at the
plant.

<TEXT>
   Four top officers from two of Mexico's biggest
brokerage firms were indicted Saturday on charges of illegal trading
and criminal fraud stemming from an inquiry into the 1987 stock
market crash.
   Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe said earlier in the week that the
violations included insider trading in stocks and foreign
currencies, the sale of nonexistent Treasury certificates, and
trading in securities without clients' consent.
   Indicted were Eduardo Legorreta Chauvet, board chairman and of
Operadora de Bolsa, one of the Mexico's two leading trading firms;
and Jaime Ceballos Cervantes, the company's director of investment
promotions. Also indicted were Juan Carlos Fernandez Cueto and Jose
Francisco Rodriguez Dupont of Mexicana de Valores e Inversiones, the
other major brokerage firm.
   The four men face jail terms of from two to 10 years for
violating the national securites law and from three to 12 years for
violating the federal penal code, officials said.
   The indictments were announced during a Saturday news conference
in Mexico's Eastern Penitentiary, where the men are being held.
   The investigation followed complaints filed by at least 200
investors against all but one of Mexico's 24 registered brokerage
firms after stockholders incurred losses estimated at $7 million or
more in the October 1987 crash.
   Treasury Department officials said they began receiving
complaints of fraud after the stock market index plunged 74 percent
in 28 trading days.
   Officials have not said how much money was involved. But Gustavo
Diaz, president of a group of investors who say they were defrauded,
has estimated the brokerage firms netted $43.5 million in profits
from alleged illegal trading.
   The stock market investigation is part of an overall crackdown on
labor and white-collar corruption in Mexico by President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, a Harvard-educated economist who took office
last Dec. 1.
   In January, Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, de facto leader of the
powerful Oil Workers Union, was arrested on weapons charges in a
massive crackdown on labor leaders.
   Hernandez Galicia, known as ``La Quina,'' and 45 others were
indicted on charges of illegal possession of firearms, extortion,
embezzlement and corruption.

   Britain's Prince Charles stroked a
panther Saturday before mounting up under sunny skies for a benefit
polo match before 4,000 fashionable spectators.
   The Prince of Wales arrived at Patrick Air Force Base during the
morning, a day after he met with President Bush, and was whisked to
the new Windsor Polo and Beach Club. He was not accompanied by his
wife Diana or their two children on his fifth trip to south Florida
since 1980.
   The polo match, a benefit for the Friends of Conservation, a
group that raises funds for African wildlife, was the first Prince
of Wales Cup match.
   ``This is so surprising for Vero Beach to have something of such
importance happen here,'' said Patsy Helseth of Vero Beach as she
sampled wine under a tent on the polo grounds. ``It's really a
feather in our cap.''
   After he arrived, Charles mounted a dais for a wildlife display
conducted by television naturalist Jim Fowler that featured a
Florida panther, a cheetah, a Harris hawk and a Florida screech owl.
   Fowler persuaded the prince to pet the panther.
   Before the sold-out match started, the prince cut a ribbon to
officially open the unfinished club.
   More than 150 bodyguards, anti-terrorism experts and law officers
were assigned to keep watch over the 40-year-old heir to the British
throne throughout his 47 hours in the Sunshine State.
   Charles arrived with Constantine, former king of Greece, and
author George Plimpton threw out the first ball. The prince's team
won the match, 10-7. Charles scored one goal in the fifth chukker, a
period of play.
   The prince and host Geoffrey Kent were to mount up Sunday for
another sold-out match at the nearby Palm Beach Polo and Country
Club in Wellington. A $250-a-plate charity brunch also was planned
at the club.
   ``People are coming to see him from all over the country. We've
had to turn people away,'' said Jane Dudley, benefit co-chairwoman.

   Assailants on Saturday hurled a bomb
at the back of a bus carrying U.S. soldiers, wounding three of them
and two Honduran passersby, the U.S. Embassy and a nurse said.
   Anne M. Sigmund, director of public information for the embassy,
told The Associated Press by telephone, ``Two soldiers received
immediate medical attention and left the hospital, but the third one
is staying for observation.''
   The blast, which occurred about noon (1 p.m. EST) in Comayagua,
about 60 miles northwest of the capital, was the third attack
against U.S. soldiers in Honduras in the past year and a half.
   Sigmund said the soldiers were taken to the military hospital at
Enrique Soto Cano Air Base outside Comayagua. She did not describe
the extent of their injuries.
   There are about 1,200 U.S. soldiers stationed at the base.
   She said that the soldiers were injured when assailants hurled an
explosive device at the back of a rented bus in which 28 American
soldiers were returning to their base after a training visit to
Comayagua.
   Sigmund said it not not been determined what type of explosive
was thrown at the bus.
   ``There was an explosion, whose causes still are not known.
However, the act is being investigated by U.S. personnel and the
Honduran police,'' she added.
   The embassy spokeswoman said that no one had claimed immediate
reponsibility. ``For the moment, we are not giving out any more
information, which we will offer when the investigation is
concluded.''
   A nurse at Santa Teresa Hospital in Comayagua told The Associated
Press by telephone that two Honduran passersby also were being
treated for injuries in the attack.
   The nurse, who did not give her name, said that both men were
treated at the hospital. ``They suffered light injuries and are
staying for observation,'' she said.
   Johnny Banegas, announcer for a radio station in Comayagua, said,
``I saw that a device exploded in the back of the bus, affecting two
nearby buildings, one a hotel and the other a school.''
   ``The back part of the vehicle was practically destroyed,'' he
said.
   Carlos Jimenez, another witness, told reporters, ``A little after
the explosion, various American (military) police arrived on the
scene with dogs trained in the detection of explosives.''
   He added, ``It all happened so fast. The soldiers, most of them,
got out of the bus. I saw one of them being carried by his
companions because he apparently had leg injuries.''
   This was the third terrorist attack against U.S. soldiers, who
have been conducting maneuvers in Honduras since 1982. Leftist
groups have protested the maneuvers.
   On Aug. 7, 1987, a bomb injured six American soldiers and six
Honduran civilians in a Comayagua restaurant.
   On Feb. 1, seven vehicles carrying more than 30 American soldiers
was attacked by unidentified gunmen in northern Yoro province, but
no one was injured.

   Six U.S. warplanes on a low-level
training flight changed course without warning and flew dangerously
close to six passenger jets, a magazine reported Saturday.
   Der Spiegel also reported that U.S. intelligence agents are
eavesdropping on European phone calls.
   The Hamburg-based newsmagazine said the F-16 fighter planes based
at the U.S. Air Force headquarters at Ramstein flew into heavy fog
Tuesday and pulled into a steep climb, narrowly missing six
airliners in a holding pattern waiting to land at Frankfurt Airport.
   ``As if they were alone in the air, they switched their radio
signals to `Code 77' (emergency) and went into a steep climb,'' Der
Spiegel said.
   Der Spiegel said the fighters came within yards of the airliners.
   Spokesmen for the U.S. Air Force in Ramstein could not be reached
for comment Saturday night.
   The magazine quoted a civilian air traffic controller as saying:
``They haven't learned anything from Remscheid.''
   A U.S. Air Force warplane in December crashed into a residential
area of the central city of Remscheid, killing the pilot and five
people on the ground.
   U.S. officials are under growing pressure to reduce military
training flights after a series of plane crashes that killed more
than 100 people last year.
   The magazine also reported that the National Security Agency had
set up a facility in Frankfurt designed not only to pick up military
signals from the Warsaw Pact, but also to eavesdrop at will on
thousands of private phone calls in West Germany and Europe.
   The magazine said the agency also had listening posts at three
other locations in West Germany.
   Spiegel said that West German intelligence agencies often receive
information from the U.S. listening posts to help them kept track of
extremist activities in the country.

   U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, who won
re-election to his second six-year term just three months ago,
announced Saturday his candidacy for the Republican nomination for
governor in 1990.
   In remarks prepared for an address to the California Republican
Party's annual convention, Wilson ended more than a month of
speculation about his plans.
   He was widely viewed as his party's front-runner for governor. In
a statewide poll taken shortly after Republican Gov. George
Deukmejian announced last month that he will retire after his
current term, Wilson easily topped six prospective candidates.
   Wilson, 55, who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1978 and
briefly launched a second try in 1981, said he welcomed the
challenge of a 1990 bid.
   He said he has ``been far more than content in the Senate ... so
this was not an easy decision, not one to be made lightly.''
   A moderate on environmental and social issues and conservative on
fiscal issues, Wilson in his convention address outlined in broad
terms a platform of job and trade development, environmental
protection and new efforts to ease highway congestion.
   A few hours before Wilson's announcement, Los Angeles Police
Chief Daryl Gates, the only GOP candidate to form an exploratory
committee to seek the nomination for governor, rejected a public
plea from state party chairman Bob Naylor to withdraw and support
Wilson.
   The leading contenders for the Democratic nomination for governor
are Attorney General John Van de Kamp and former San Francisco Mayor
Dianne Feinstein.

   British Airways began inspecting passengers'
electronic and electrical equipment Saturday following the
announcement that explosives hidden in a radio-cassette player blew
up Pan Am Flight 103.
   In another development, the Department of Transport said it was
testing a U.S.-made scanner that can detect plastic explosives,
which were believed used to blow up the Pan Am jet. The department
denied a report Sunday in the weekly Mail that the instrument
already was in use at London's Heathrow airport.
   ``As it uses neutrons, we have to make sure it is absolutely
safe,'' a spokesman said of the computer scanner. The newspaper
report said two similar computers were successfully tested at Los
Angeles and San Francisco airports.
   British Airways, Britain's biggest airline was acting on a
Department of Transport recommendation that all airlines using
British airports examine radios, computers and other electronic or
electrical equipment for possible explosives.
   A department spokesman said the suggestion was sent to airlines
Friday and is aimed mainly at battery-operated transistor radios,
lap-top computers and cassette recorders in which explosives can be
easily hidden, rather than smaller items such as hair dryers.
   An airline spokesman said British Airways started asking
passengers to take all electrical and electronic equipment out of
their suitcases for a separate security check, and, when the items
were cleared, to carry them aboard as hand baggage.
   No major delays were reported because of the increased security.
   At London's Heathrow Airport, New York-bound British Airways
passenger Graham Atkinson from Surrey, south of London, was asked to
unpack his suitcase to take out a small transistor radio.
   ``I think it is an excellent move,'' he said. ``I go along with
any steps being taken to stop the terrorists. Obviously after
Lockerbie, you can't be too careful.''
   All 259 people on board Pan Am Flight 103 were killed and 11
people on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland, died Dec. 21 when a
bomb blew up the New York-bound jet.
   Sheila Dawson from Wimbledon, also bound for New York, said: ``I
was asked if I had anything electrical in my luggage when I checked
in. In fact I had packed my Walkman in my hand baggage so I was able
to show them straight away.
   ``It's frightening to think that a bomb could be hidden in
something as small as that. I agree with the new regulation and I
think it should be strictly enforced.''
   At a Thursday news conference in Lockerbie, detective John Orr
said investigators believe a radio-cassette player contained the
explosives that blew up Flight 103.
   Orr, who is leading the international investigation of the crash,
said it appeared likely the explosives were checked in with baggage
in Frankfurt before the plane went to London's Heathrow Airport for
the final leg of its trip to New York. But there was not enough
evidence to determine the identity of the bomber, he said.
   One group regularly linked to the bombing was Ahmed Jibril's
extremist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command, a Syrian-sponsored faction outside the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat said Saturday he would ``punish'' Jibril
if he were responsible, but that no evidence has been found. Arafat
said he did not think Palestinians were behind the bombing because
``no Palestinan can think to do this awful crime.''
   Arafat spoke in an interview with CBS television's ``60
Minutes.'' A transcript of his remarks was released in advance by
the network.
   At a Montreal meeting last week of the International Civil
Aviation Organization's governing council, Transport Secretary Paul
Channon outlined a program to increase airline security, including
checks on electrical and electronic equipment.
   The organization agreed to consider a worldwide tightening of
aviation security rules, including possible restrictions on carrying
electrical and electronic devices on planes.
   Britain decided to go ahead with the recommendation without
waiting for the international organization to take action, said the
transport spokesman who, in line with British custom, is not
identified by name.

   A father pulled four of his children

three others, who died in the blaze, authorities said.
   Killed were Amy Hames, 10; Kara Hames, 7; and Larry Hames III, 5,
said Richard Seay, deputy Spartanburg County coroner. The bodies
were found in a front bedroom.
   Amy's twin, Angela, was one of the four who survived.
   The cause of the 2:30 a.m. fire in the duplex apartment has not
been determined, but apparently it began in the living room,
authorities said.
   Darby Riggins, a neighbor who reported the fire to authorities,
said the parents and children screamed for someone to save those
inside.
   ``The mother and father were outside the house screaming and
hollering,'' Riggins said. ``There were four children ... and they
kept repeating the other children's names.''
   Larry Hames, 31, was in serious condition and his 33-year-old
wife, Monica, was in fair condition Saturday at Spartanburg Regional
Medical Center, officials said.
   Family members said Hames suffered second- and third-degree burns
on his face, arms and chest from trying to re-enter the burning
house.
   The four Hames children who were rescued by their father were
treated at the hospital and released. The children were all asleep
in the front bedroom when their father awakened them and broke a
window for the escape, said the children's grandmother, Margaree
Hames.

   A U.S. investigator whose report on the arms
control delegation in Geneva included charges that John Tower kept
his secretaries as mistresses was told by the State Department to
postpone a meeting with a House subcommittee, the panel's chairman
said Saturday.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the subcommittee, said in
an interview that hours later State Department officials promised
full cooperation with the panel, but added he still was concerned
about the incident.
   Dingell said Berne Indahl, a State Department security officer
who was sent to Geneva in 1986 by the Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency to help investigate allegations of security breaches, also
apparently was questioned by FBI agents.
   Indahl had been scheduled to meet Saturday with the staff of the
House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and
investigations.
   But Dingell told CBS News that when Indahl arrived on a flight
from Africa, where he is currently posted, ``he was met by security
officials of the State Department who whisked him off to a motel or
hotel, advised him that he can speak to no one until Tuesday.''
   ``State brought him back for us,'' Dingell told The Associated
Press. ``Then when he got back it turned out they didn't want him
talking to us.''
   Dingell said he later spoke with State Department officials who
said they knew nothing about the incident or why Indal was told to
delay his meeting with the committee. The officials promised full
cooperation with the committee, and Indahl later spoke with
subcommittee staff members, Dingell said.
   Nonetheless, the congressman told CBS, ``Interference with a
congressional investigation is a criminal act... In the meantime,
the inquiry of the committee is now expanded by this rather curious
set of events.''
   The subcommittee has been conducting an inquiry into security at
nuclear weapons facilities run by the Department of Energy, he said.
The inquiry is not related to investigations dealing with the Senate
confirmation hearing for Tower, the defense secretary-designate.
   In the course of its probe, the subcommittee obtained documents
from an Office of Personnel Management report of an investigation
into the activities of the Geneva delegation while Tower served as a
U.S. negotiator.
   Tower, a former Texas senator, served in Geneva from January 1985
to April 1986. Allegations against Tower included claims that he
used his secretaries as mistresses.
   Dingell said information received by his subcommittee had raised
``some very serious questions'' and included ``quite colorful''
stories about the personal behavior of some delegation members, he
said. The congressman said he could not say if Tower was involved.
   The information, which Dingell said had been shared with the FBI
and the Senate Armed Services Committee, also ``involves inability
to keep track of records, papers, safes, a lack of an adequate
logging file with regard to classified documents...''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
said an investigation of Tower's actions in Geneva found no security
breaches.
   Dingell's subcommittee sought a meeting with Indahl to discuss
the investigation he conducted in Geneva and statements attributed
to him in the personnel office report.
   Congressional sources, who requested anonymity, said a letter was
sent to Secretary of State James A. Baker III requesting a meeting
with Indahl. The security officer, who was in Abidjan, Ivory Coast,
returned to the United States on Saturday.
   Indahl, contacted later at a Washington D.C.-area hotel, declined
to comment.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said he had no
information on the incident. An FBI spokesman said the agency would
have no comment on an active investigation.
   The allegations against Tower were said to have been made to
Indahl by John Grassle, a Geneva security official, but Grassle was
quoted by Knight-Ridder News Service as saying he did not make such
allegations.
   A man who answered the phone at Grassle's home said his father
had gone on vacation for a few weeks.
   Assistant FBI Director Milt Ahlerich said Friday that the agency
is ``in the latter stages of winding up'' the check into allegations
about Tower's personal and business affairs.
   Tower has been dogged by allegations of drinking and womanizing.
Many senators have said they are also concerned about whether Tower
could avoid conflicts of interest after receiving more than $1
million as a consultant for major defense contractors since he left
the Senate four years ago.
   A vote by the Senate Armed Services Committee on the nominee has
been delayed while the FBI conducts its inquiry. Sen. John Warner of
Virginia, the ranking Republican on the panel, said Friday that the
committee had forwarded additional material to the White House and
that he and Nunn would be available this weekend to review the FBI
report.
   The Senate committee is expected to meet early next week to
consider the embattled nomination.

   A rampage by more than 200 youths who stole
belongings from people at a ``Midnight Madness'' fair ended early
Saturday after five hours of fighting that injured about 60 people,
authorities said.
   Of the 60 people hurt, four were sheriff's deputies, authorities
said. Forty people required hospital treatment for injuries ranging
from cuts and bruises to broken bones. One beaten man had to be
revived by officers and another man required 30 stitches to close a
deep cut to his back, police said.
   The youths, who in seven or eight loosely organized groups,
started ``sucker punching'' and stealing belongings from people at
the Florida State Fair just after 10:30 p.m. Friday, said Sgt.
Kenneth Akins of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office.
   Authorities weren't able to bring the situation under control
until about 4 a.m., Akins said.
   ``This is probably the worst event that I have ever worked in the
sheriff's office in 12 years,'' said Akins, commander of the
sheriff's special crowd-control unit.
   Deputies arrested about 12 people, most of them juveniles, the
officer said.
   About 30,000 people attended the fair's special discount event
called ``Midnight Madness.'' Organizers had only expected 10,000 to
12,000.
   There were no reports of violence Saturday night at the fair,
which was scheduled to close at midnight. The fair, billed as having
the Southeast's largest midway, began Feb. 8 and ends Sunday night.

   Army units and Christian militiamen were
ordered to stay in their barracks Saturday as mediators sought to
preserve a cease-fire in the struggle for control of Lebanon's
Christian heartland.
   A police spokesman put the casualty toll from four days of
clashes at 76 killed and 200 wounded.
   The spokesman, speaking under ground rules of anonymity, said
about 2,500 army commandos and 2,000 Lebanese Forces militiamen
involved in fighting that rocked east Beirut and the hills above the
capital were confined to their barracks.
   Only riot police in red berets and traffic police were on view as
civil defense squads and municipality workers cleared broken glass,
burned-out cars, fallen pine trees and broken power cables from the
streets.
   Civilian mediators shuttled between army commander Gen. Michel
Aoun and Samir Geagea, leader of the 6,000-strong Lebanese Forces,
the Christians' main militia, trying to strengthen the cease-fire.
   The six-member committee of parliamentarians commuted between
Aoun's hilltop command in suburban Yarze and Geagea's walled
headquarters in the seaside Karantina district.
   Reporters touring the area did not find army or militia
checkpoints on the main streets of Beirut's Christian sector or in
the hillside suburbs, including the Aukar district that houses the
U.S. Embassy.
   Lebanese staff from the embassy blocked the only road to the
sprawling compound, telling reporters neither Ambassador John
McCarthy nor any of his American staff were there.
   The embassy shut down when it was caught in the crossfire during
Wednesday's fighting. Defense Department officials in Washington
said at least 13 diplomatic workers were evacuated Friday to Cyprus,
leaving 25 others behind.
   The committee was reporting later to Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir,
spiritual head of the dominant Maronite Catholic community who
mediated Wednesday's cease-fire. Both Aoun and Geagea are Maronites.
   Geagea, 38, on Friday announced he was ordering his militiamen
back to their barracks at the request of Sfeir and a group of 31
senior Christian politicians who met with the patriarch to defuse
the confrontation.
   Aoun, 53, whose 20,000 predominantly Christian troops control 75
percent of the Christian enclave, had earlier threatened to unleash
an ``apocalypse'' to wipe out the Lebanese forces.
   The capital has been divided into Moslem and Christian sectors
since civil war broke out in 1975. The crossings between the two
zones were re-opened Saturday after three days of closure.

<TEXT>
   Newspaper magnate Robert Maxwell has pledged $10.6
million to anyone who can ``civilize'' Iranian ruler Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, one of his newspapers announced Sunday.
   The People, a London weekly tabloid, said the money would be paid
to anyone who can persuade the Moslem leader to repent ``his wicked
ways'' by persuading him to publicly recite the sixth and ninth of
the Ten Commandments: ``Thou shalt not kill'' and ``Thou shall not
bear false witness.''
   Maxwell's offer doubles the price put on the head of British
writer Salman Rushdie by Iranian religious leaders.
   They did so after Khomeini said Tuesday that Rushdie's novel
``The Satanic Verses'' was an insult to ``Islamic sanctity'' and
zealous Moislems should execute him and those closely connected with
the book's publication.
   Rushdie has since disappeared from view and has been reported in
hiding with an armed police guard.

   A Flying Tigers cargo plane slammed
into the hilly jungle outside the capital Sunday and burst into
flames, killing all four people on board, authorities said. The dead
were identified as U.S. citizens.
   The Boeing 747 operated by the Los Angeles-based air freight
company was to land at Subang International Airport outside Kuala
Lumpur when it disappeared from radar, Civil Aviation Department
officials said.
   Four crew members were the only people on board and all four
killed, said Nordin Saad, air traffic control director for the Civil
Aviation Department.
   The plane, which took off from Singapore, crashed at 6:36 a.m.
(5:36 p.m. EST), he said.
   He said the bodies were recovered but the identities were being
withheld pending notification of relatives.
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Meg Gillroy said in a statement that all
four crew members were U.S. citizens.
   Other Civil Aviation officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the flight data recorder had been recovered, but no
cause of the crash was readily apparent.
   The jumbo jet crashed about nine miles from the airport in the
dense, hilly jungle. Aviation officials said the aircraft left
Singapore with a load of freight, including mail and clothing.
   The crash site is slightly more than four miles away from the
nearest residential area.
   Chooi Joon Hoong, 48, told reporters that he was out at his fruit
orchard at the foot of the hills when he heard a loud explosion and
then smoke from the hills.

<TEXT>
   Christie's auction house held its first-ever sale
of Spanish paintings on Friday, and a lighthearted ``picture within
a picture'' fetched the highest individual price of $233,000.
   The 170 paintings from the 19th and 20th centuries reaped a total
of $2.1 million, with prices ``well beyond expectations,'' said a
Christie's statement.
   The most expensive work, Raimundo de Madrazo y Garreta's ``En El
Estudio'' (In the Studio), ``reverses the role of portraiture,''
Christie's said.
   It depicts one of the artist's favorite models dressed in a
sweeping, salmon-colored gown, standing in front of her own
unfinished portrait and drawing a caricature of the artist on the
canvas.
   The painting's price of $233,000 was $56,000 more than its
highest estimate, Christie's said. The auction house did not provide
the year of the painting. The artist lived from 1841 to 1920.
   The highest price paid for a religious painting was $214,000 for
a sumptuous depiction of a candlelight ceremony honoring a saint,
titled ``Celebrating Santa Maria Della Rosa.''
   The artist, Jose Benlliure y Gil, lived from 1855 to 1914.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Friday began talks
with opposition to seek solutions to the political problems plaguing
the country.
   Carlos Huembes, president of the opposition Nicarguan Workers
Central and the Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinate, met Thursday with
Vice President Sergio Ramirez.
   The Sandinista government did not offer an official version of
the Friday meeting with opposition leaders. Though no agreement was
reached, the possibility of new talks remains open, Huembes said.
   President Daniel Ortega, during a summit of Central American
presidents this week, promised to ``develop a process of
democratization and national reconciliation'' in the country.
   At the end of the summit held Monday and Tuesday in El Salvador,
Ortega also promised to hold presidential, legislative and municipal
elections by February and to allow the opposition to help organize
them.
   The balloting had been scheduled for November 1990.
   A summit agreement signed by Ortega and the presidents of El
Salvador Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica also calls for
disbanding the Nicaraguan rebels known as the Contras, most of whom
are encamped in nearby Honduras.
   Rebel leaders have said they have felt abandoned by the United
States, which had supported their seven-year fight to oust the
leftist government.
   Despite vows to fight on, the Contras ran out of ammunition and
moved into border camps after Congress suspended military aid a year
ago. On March 23, they signed a preliminary cease-fire accord with
the Sandinistas.
   Huembes told journalists on Friday that the vice president told
him and other opposition leaders that ``all of us Nicaraguans must
resolve the problem, without abandoning our own principles.''
   Huembes said he told Ramirez that true political pluralism must
be created and called for an end to what he described as ``the
blackmail, coersion and buying and selling'' among political parties
that make up the National Assembly.
   He said he told the vice president that if the current political
situation continues ``thousands upon thousands of Nicaraguans will
reclaim their rights.''
   Huembes was accompanied during the meeting by Roger Guevara, the
coordinate secretary general.

<TEXT>
   A jury convicted a 26-year-old man of
sexual assault Friday in the third trial stemming from the rape of a
woman who said she was abducted and repeatedly attacked by a group
of men at an illegal cockfight.
   The jury deliberated about 3{ hours before returning the verdict
against Roberto Perez shortly before 9 p.m.
   Perez is one of 10 men and a 14-year-old boy who were indicted
last April on charges ranging from kidnapping to aggravated
kidnapping to sexual assault.
   The case was moved to Hidalgo County after the defense complained
of excessive publicity in Duvall County, where the incidents
occurred.
   District Judge Ricardo Garcia gave the jury the option of
returning Saturday to assess punishment, but the jurors chose to
remain Friday night.
   Attorneys for both sides made closing arguments Friday afternoon.
   Perez testified Friday that the woman consented to sex with him
and several others on the March night of the alleged attack.
   The woman testified last week that Perez sexually assaulted her
at a ranch north of San Diego, Texas, where men were gathered for an
illegal cockfight, and then at two other locations.
   She has told authorities she was abducted while walking home and
taken to the ranch. She said she was raped and sodomized repeatedly
there and at two other locations by as many as 20 men.
   Orlando Garza, 24, the first man to be tried in the case, was
convicted on Sept. 27 of sexual assault and was sentenced to 20
years in prison by a jury in San Diego.
   Felipe Chew, 27, was convicted in San Diego on Jan. 27 of
aggravated kidnapping and was sentenced to 30 years in prison.

<TEXT>
   In the week after the shooting stopped in
their war with Iran, Iraqis went on a $318-million shopping spree in
state-run stores. They bought up television sets, refrigerators and
other luxury items the government released from warehouses.
   Six months later, the state-run stores are closed to
non-government employees and their shelves are empty. One recently
had only a few light sockets in its electrical department.
   Iraqis are beginning to realize that the $60 billion to $70
billion their country borrowed during the 8-year Persian Gulf war is
going to affect their wallets for a long time.
   No one has come forward to help finance reconstruction, although
neighboring Kuwait has said it might offer some aid.
   Creditors who are owed an estimated $3 billion are pressing hard
for repayment. New laws designed to attract private money from
Iraqis and from around the Arab world have attracted little interest.
   ``The economic situation's very bad. Salaries are low and prices
go up and up,'' said Mukhtar, 34, who recently started a chicken
farm to try to supplement his family's government incomes.
   ``I think things will stay bad because they have to pay for the
war. It may be five to seven years before it gets better.''
   Diplomats conjecture that Iraq is spreading the estimated $10
billion to $12 billion a year it earns from oil exports too thinly
by trying to pay for reconstruction, buy expensive armaments,
develop heavy industry, meet consumer demands and pay off its debts.
   Iraqi officials maintain the problems are short-term and that the
economy will eventually refloat on the 100 billion barrels of oil
lying under their feet.
   ``I'm optimistic that the price of oil will hold and Iraq will
remain an important oil-producing country for at least the next
century,'' said deputy Foreign Minister Nizar Hamdoon.
   ``Our resources are quite sufficient to pay the debts back. It's
just a question of time.''
   Hamdoon confirmed reports that Iraq will not have to pay back aid
from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, estimated by diplomats at about $30
billion.
   ``Our Arab brothers are very considerate of the fact that Iraq
was defending not just its own interests, but the interests of those
countries,'' he said.
   Diplomats said private suppliers in the Persian Gulf, however,
were balking at writing off an estimated $6 billion to $8 billion in
goods supplied on credit, but the Kuwaiti government might step in
to pay that bill.
   Hamdoon called the $60-billion debt figure ``exaggerated.'' But
the government will not release any exact figure.
   Diplomats say uncertainty over the size of the debt, an
overvalued dinar currency and a lack of trust in the government's
commitment to the private sector are all factors keeping investors
away.
   ``Arab investors really want the Iraqis to open their books, to
say what their debts are,'' said one diplomat.
   Potential investors dislike the discrepancy between the official
and free market currency exchange rates and worry about the
availability of foreign exchange, diplomats said.
   The Iraqi dinar sells for about 50 cents on open markets in
neighboring countries, but Baghdad fixes its worth at $3.
   Investors have to exchange at least 50 percent of their foreign
currency at that official rate.
   In addition, foreign exchange can be hard to find, especially
with an estimated 2 million Egyptian workers in the country who can
legally send home about $2 billion a year.
   Harsh attacks in the press on steep price increases caused by
businessmen passing on the cost of the official exchange rate have
not encouraged investors.
   The price of an automobile tire, for example, went from 14 dinars
($42) to 100 dinars ($300) when private importers took over and
thefts shot up. Prices like 625 dinars ($1,875 at the official
exchange rate) for a small color television unleashes consumer
charges of extortion. Government salaries have been fixed at about
150 dinars ($450) a month since the beginning of the war.
   Iraqi consumers are also railing against shoddy local
merchandise, complaining about everything from heaters that don't
heat to perfume that has no scent.
   President Saddam Hussein's privatization program aimed at
increasing efficiency and luring back billions of dollars held
abroad has met with limited success, with an estimated 30 to 40
percent of the state-run companies put on the block actually sold.
   Small factories have been snapped up, but items like luxury
hotels at $50 million each remain largely unsold. State television
nightly runs 10 minutes of ads for government enterprises on sale.
   The state retains control of 80 percent of the economy and plans
to keep control of heavy industry and the oil sector, with the
exception of gasoline stations.
   In the meantime, Iraqis remain starved for goods.
   Arab tradition dictates that when a friend admires something you
own, you offer it to him, but the offer is customarily refused.
   An Iraqi visiting from Los Angeles said he offered his Ray-Ban
sunglasses, a crocodile leather belt and an Olympus camera to
friends in Iraq.
   They took them.

<HEAD>Wall Street Slimed Again By Insider Trading and Program Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two serpents that poisoned the stock market in
the reckless days before the crash seem to have slithered back into
Wall Street's concrete canyons, giving some strategists a disturbing
dose of deja vu.
   Signs of insider trading on takeover stocks have been noticed by
several ticker-tape scrutinizers.
   Also, in the past week, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., one of the Street's
biggest investment firms, abandoned a suspension of computerized
program trading, blamed by many investors for wild price swings in
stocks and mentioned by some studies as a catalyst in the Oct. 19,
1987 crash.
   Insider trading and program trading were prominent in the
5-year-long bull market that collapsed on Black Monday. A crackdown
on securities fraud and post-crash limits on program trading by big
brokerages pushed those two activities into relative obscurity for a
while.
   Although market officials responsible for policing trades haven't
disclosed a resurgence of insider trading, irksome signs of the
activity _ particularly in takeover-target stock prices _ have been
getting more frequent.
   ``My impression is the stocks are very definitely running up
prior to bids,'' said Charles M. LaLoggia, author of Special
Situation Report, a widely read newsletter that focuses on takeover
stocks.
   ``It's just the sort of environment we saw in 1986 and 1987 all
over again,'' LaLoggia said. ``Apparently, it's insider trading. For
some reason, I'd say over last three or four months, there's
definitely been an upsurge.''
   One of the most conspicuous moves lately was in Coleman Co., the
recreational equipment maker. That usually sleepy stock jumped in
value days before management disclosed plans last Tuesday for a
debt-financed takeover.
   In another questionable predisclosure move, the value of Union
Carbide Corp. stock shot up a week before the chemical giant
announced it had settled the Bhopal gas-leak disaster case with the
Indian government. In addition, there have been recurring rumors of
a possible takeover bid for Carbide.
   New York Stock Exchange surveillance officials declined to return
telephone calls for comment on possibly suspicious trades. Jay Bono,
head of the American Stock Exchange's surveillance unit, said his
staff had not detected any significant resurgence in pre-takeover
announcement stock moves.
   ``Things are hopping, but there's definitely no greater incidence
of evidence of insider trading,'' he said.
   Some of the activity could be attributed to the Wall Street rumor
mill, which is running overtime as usual. Rumors on possible
takeover attempts abound, and traders can't afford to ignore the
reports, regardless how factual, for fear of missing another RJR
Nabisco.
   To be sure, many investment professionals believe the stock
market's situation today differs sharply from the careless precrash
days. For one thing, prices still remain depressed relative to that
time. For another, they say, higher corporate profits and dividends
have justified the market's resurgence.
   ``My feeling is, investors aren't getting into the 1987-type
trap,'' said Rao Chalasani, a market strategist at Prescott Ball &amp;
Turben Inc., a Cleveland-based investment firm. Nonetheless,
Chalasani said, Morgan Stanley's resumption of program trading
raised troubling questions.
   The strategy involves the simultaneous sale of massive amounts of
stock in New York and purchase of stock-index futures in Chicago to
profit from price differences, and can jolt prices regardless of
underlying values.
   ``I do have some concern about the orderliness of the market and
how orderly it will be,'' Chalasani said. ``Anything that's affected
the market in the past could do so again in the future.''
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. reported record profits
for 1988 but the performance was tainted by heavy costs for rebates
and generous credit deals to customers.
   _Foreign crackdowns on fraudulent market activities accelerated.
French authorities indicted five people on insider trading charges,
Mexican prosecutors arrested four top securities brokers, and
Japanese police seized a former Labor Ministry aide implicated in a
sensational stock scandal.
   _Government statistics suggested the nation's trade-balance
improvement has stalled although the economy continues to show
considerable strength. The December trade deficit shrank only
slightly, January industrial output climbed and factory utilization
remained the highest in nearly a decade.

<HEAD>Inflation Indicators Point In Opposite Directions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The weathervanes of inflation have been pointing
in opposite directions lately, complicating the lives of some
prominent forecasters.
   One of those forecasters, President Bush, said in the Valentine's
Day edition of the Wall Street Journal that now was not the time to
tighten credit to fight inflation.
   The unnamed recipient of Bush's Valentine message, Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, has been doing exactly that _
tightening credit to fight inflation.
   Both men have sought to play down their disagreement, but it
stands out as a classic confrontation between a president who favors
strong economic growth and a Fed chairman who worries too-rapid
growth will heat up inflation.
   The consensus outlook for inflation is not bad, a 4.7 percent
rise in consumer prices in 1989, according to a survey of 51
economists by Blue Chip Economic Indicators of Sedona, Ariz. That's
not much above last year's 4.4 percent increase.
   The confusion exists because there are plenty of good statistics
to back up the argument that inflation is a growing problem _ as
well as the argument that it's not a growing problem.
   Here is a look at some of the widely watched inflation
weathervanes and what they are showing:
   CONSUMER PRICES: The consumer price index finished 1988 with a
pair of 0.3 percent monthly increases, indicating that inflation
remained moderate. But some economists fear this Wednesday's report
on January prices will show a steeper rise.
   WHOLESALE PRICES: One reason for the worry about Wednesday's
report is that wholesale prices shot up at a 12.7 percent annual
rate in January. It may have been partly a quirk, but wholesale
prices have been rising faster than consumer prices, a worrisome
sign.
   FACTORY USE: When factories are running flat out, inflation tends
to rise because companies have to bid for scarce raw materials and
labor. January's operating rate was 84.2 percent, a rate not
exceeded in a decade.
   WAGES: Some big labor contracts are up for renewal this year,
including ones covering 550,000 phone workers and the four major
steel companies. Unionized workers have been getting below-average
raises in pay and benefits in the last few years. If they hold out
for catch-up increases, inflation could climb.
   CONSUMER SPENDING: Since spending by consumers accounts for
two-thirds of the national consumption, the latest 0.6 percent rise
in retail sales in January could point toward overheating, some
economists believe.
   COMMODITY PRICES: Higher prices for raw materials produce what's
known as cost-push inflation. The spot price index of the Commodity
Research Bureau _ covering everything from zinc to rubber _ is just
5 percent below its all-time peak of November 1980 and up a sharp 10
percent from one year ago. On the positive side, crude oil futures
are about flat with a year ago.
   THE DOLLAR: The dollar's strength, while harmful to U.S.
exporters, has helped restrain inflation by holding down the dollar
price of imported products. However, if the dollar turns down
because of bad trade figures, import price inflation would rise.
   GOLD: Investors buy gold as a hedge against inflation because it
holds its value better in inflationary times than paper assets like
stocks and bonds. The price of gold has dropped about 15 percent
over the past year _ one sign that many investors are not overly
concerned about the inflationary threat.
   MONETARY RESTRAINT: Under Greenspan, the Federal Reserve remains
vigilant against inflation. By soaking up bank reserves it has
helped drive up short-term interest rates: the yield on the
three-month Treasury bill has jumped to nearly 9 percent from under
6 percent. High borrowing costs should cool off the economy.
   All in all, the weathervanes don't give a good idea of which way
the wind is blowing. That means George Bush and Alan Greenspan will
have plenty to disagree about in months ahead.

<HEAD>Crackdown On Wild Stock Exchange Part of Broad Government Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sensational arrests of four top
stockbrokers appears to reflect an expanded war on corruption by
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who sees market malfeasance as
a threat to Mexico's modernization.
   The arrests sent ``a very clear political and economic signal
that this administration is stronger than the last,'' said Abel
Beltran del Rio, director of Ciemex-Wefa, a consulting firm that
specializes in Mexican economics.
   To expedite his plans, Salinas needs to make the once-wild stock
market ``a clean, healthy conduit for local and foreign investors to
finance Mexican investment and generate jobs,'' del Rio said in an
interview from the firm's offices in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   The arrests on illegal trading charges stem from the 1987 crash,
which exposed the Mexican stock market as one of the world's most
freewheeling and fraudulent bourses. Hundreds of investors
complained their money was squandered by unscrupulous traders in
nearly all the country's 25 brokerages.
   The crackdown on white collar crime deflected criticism that
Salinas' government is anti-labor, charges incited by another
anti-corruption campaign begun in January against the powerful
Mexican Oil Workers Union.
   Among the stockbrokers seized last week was Eduardo Legorreta,
board chairman and co-founder of Operadora de Bolsa and one of
Mexico's wealthiest businessmen, nabbed by federal agents at a
Mexico City restaurant.
   Legorreta, known as one of the nation's most aggressive brokers,
was charged with trading in expired Treasury bills, investing
without clients' knowledge and falsifying clients' trading records.
   Gustavo Diaz, president of an investors' association, estimated
corrupt brokers netted $43.3 million in profits from illegal
trading, while Cesar Fentanes Mendez, an attorney, said stockholders
lost more than $21 million through fraud. The government itself has
not revealed a figure.
   Up to 148 more stockbrokers face administrative sanctions _
including lifetime trading bans _ for other irregularities,
according to stock exchange president Alfredo Harp Helu.
   The Salinas-led shakedown against both the stockbrokers and oil
unionists broke new ground for Mexican presidents, who had largely
ignored questionable activities by these groups before.
   Alfonso Martinez Dominguez, a former president of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, welcomed the Salinas effort,
saying, ``In our country there are no distinctions toward any
class.''
   Samuel del Villar, a political scientist with the Colegio de
Mexico and adviser to former President Miguel de la Madrid, said
Salinas moved against the oil workers and brokers because both
threatened his economic program.
   ``Corruption is worst where the economic activity is most
strategic _ and in Mexico that means petroleum and the stock
market,'' del Villar said. ``The brokerage firms, like the oil
workers union, weren't filling a productive role in the economy.''
   Both the Mexican stock exchange and securities commission last
week said they planned to tighten supervision, including an
automated reporting system that would leave a paper trail of
questionable trades.
   Despite the campaign for a clean market, critics still argue the
government has failed to explain its own role in the October 1987
crash and the boom that preceded it.
   In the nine months before the crash, Mexico's exchange was the
fastest gainer among world markets. Its 52-stock index rose by more
than 690 percent.
   Inexperienced investors weary of a protracted economic crisis,
their savings devastated by inflation and currency devaluations,
flocked in droves to eager brokers.
   The boom was fed by a 1987 government order forcing brokerage
houses to open accounts for anyone willing to invest, regardless of
financial considerations. Houses hired many rookies to meet demand,
swelling their work force to about 13,000.
   In one display of volatility just before the crash, the market
surged 7 percent in just 90 minutes after the announcement that
Salinas would be the governing party's presidential candidate in the
1988 election.
   The October 1987 crash hit investors, brokers and the business
community especially hard.
   The market index dropped 74 percent in 28 trading days, the
steepest decline anywhere. Losses reached an estimated $17 billion,
said Oscar Espinoza Villareal, president of the National Securities
Commission.
   The ``crack,'' as it's known here, prompted the securities
commission in December 1987 to suspend 105 brokers trading without
federal licenses; fine 87 firms that violated trading rules, and
raise capital requirements for all. The number of brokerage
employees is now down to about 10,000.
   An announcement by Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe that no more
brokers faced sanctions soothed nerves and sent brokers back to
concentrating on business. In fact, the market index registered no
significant changes in trading last week.
   What remains unclear is whether the long-term effect the
anticorruption campaign will help further Salinas' economic reforms.
   To make up for a reduced governmental role in the economy and
promote growth, Salinas' 1989 budget projects a 7 percent increase
in private investment.
   ``One very basic thing that Mexico needs as never before is a
very dynamic and secure stock market,'' del Rio said. ``As long as
there are doubts about the market, it will be difficult to get
investment as quickly and in the amounts Salinas wants.''

<HEAD>Radioactive Pipe Said To Pose Little Threat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN SAYRE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Louisiana has adopted temporary rules to
safely handle radium-contaminated pipe from oilfields, although the
state's environmental chief says the tubing appears to pose almost
no public threat.
   The radium, which is leached from uranium and thorium found in
deep geological formations, is brought to the surface with oilfield
brine and tends to concentrate in the scaly residue that forms
inside pipe.
   Paul Templet, secretary of the Department of Environmental
Quality, said possible health problems are limited mostly to yard
workers who cut up and process them for other uses, such as
parking-lot barriers and cattle pens.
   ``The problem is that the dust can fall out of the pipes and then
you can get a hot spot in the yard,'' Templet said. ``It's really
not a problem if you get it on your skin, but if you get it in your
lungs, then you have a problem.''
   Earlier this month the department enacted temporary rules
concerning how the pipe is handled. The rules require companies with
contaminated pipe to inform the agency and prohibit the transfer of
land for unrestricted use where topsoil radium is above a certain
level.
   The agency said its major concerns were the safety of workers who
cut or clean the pipe and the contamination of soil in pipeyards,
which might cause problems with radon gas if buildings were erected
on the sites.
   Templet said the potential problem with contaminated pipes is
``peanuts'' for oil field workers and the threat to the general
public appears to be sharply limited since radium radiation is
non-penetrating.
   The environmental department imposed the new rules under
``emergency'' procedures that allow the the regulations to take
effect before the end of a 120-day period required by state law.
   Oil industry officials blamed news of the regulations as one
contributor to a rise in crude oil prices last Wednesday. They said
the reports incited rumors that oil and gas from Louisiana was
contaminated and unsellable.
   ``The emergency rules merely deal with pipe that may have
(radium-contaminated) scale in them,'' Templet said.
   Templet said the temporary rules will allow the department to
stop pipeyards from unloading pipe before the new regulations take
effect.
   ``If we went with normal procedures, they (pipe yards) could stop
moving it out. They can't now and we'll go through normal
(rule-making) procedures,'' to make the regulations permanent, he
said.
   The state has no statistics on how many yards are handling the
pipes and the new rules should help authorities find exact numbers,
Templet said.
   Knowledge of the problem, he said, has been limited mostly to
industry people familiar with radiation control. A national study
group has been working for several years to draw up recommendations
to handle the pipe, he said.
   The department began studying the issue about six months ago
after receiving reports from metal scrap yards that routinely
monitor incoming pipe for radiation, Templet said.
   In the future, contaminated pipe probably will be stored like
other low-radiation hazards because the process of cleaning out the
scale is prohibitively expensive, Templet said.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Shows Improvement; Wall Street Extends Gains</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For Saturday PMs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A surge in exports of manufactured goods led the nation's 1988
trade deficit to its first improvement of the Reagan years.
   The narrowing of the trade gap to $137.34 billion, reported by
the government Friday, was well received by the stock market. Wall
Street rang up its third straight gain, lifting the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials 13.39 points to 2,324.82.
   Although the 1988 trade performance matched or even exceeded
market expectations, the dollar showed little reaction Friday and
finished slightly lower against most major currencies.
   Bond prices finished little changed.
   The Commerce Department reported that exports shot up a dramatic
26.8 percent last year to an all-time high of $322.22 billion. That
increase supplied much of the economy's momentum in 1988 as
factories hired more workers and expanded production facilities to
meet the export demand.
   However, imports rose to a record as well, climbing 8.3 percent
to $459.56 billion. The trade deficit is the difference between
imports and exports.
   The deficit declined almost 20 percent from an all-time high of
$170.32 billion in 1987. It marked the first improvement since 1980,
the last year of the Carter administration. In that year, the total
U.S. deficit was a much smaller $31.4 billion.
   Through the 1980s, the nation's trade deficit steadily
deteriorated, posting record imbalances year after year, caused in
part by the huge federal budget deficits, which increased demand in
the economy.
   The Bush administration, which has made reducing the budget
deficit its No. 1 priority, said the new trade figures showed the
imperative need for Congress to enact the president's revised budget.
   That document projects a big drop in the deficit while calling
for a reduction in the capital gains tax as a way of spurring
investment in new plants and equipment.

<HEAD>Coleman Clan Trying to Buy Company Founded by Grandfather</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's been nearly a century since a
typewriter salesman with poor eyesight founded the Coleman Co. Now
his descendants are fighting to ensure the family name not only
stays on the products but runs the boardroom.
   Led by W.C. Coleman's grandson, who is the company's chief
executive and a part-time rock'n'roll musician, members of the
Coleman clan have made a $64 per share debt-financed takeover offer
for the world-famous maker of camping gear.
   Analysts say the $332 million deal could be a defensive move to
fend off other takeover bids for the corporation that had record
sales of $657.9 million and record earnings of $24.5 million in 1988.
   The Coleman saga began in 1899 when W.C., working on a wintry
night in Brockton, Ala., saw a bright steady light coming from a
drugstore window. Startled, he trudged across a muddy street and
discovered the store had a lamp that burned gasoline under pressure
and used a mantle instead of a wick.
   Unlike the flickering wick-fed kerosene lamps and dim carbon
filament electric bulbs, the lamp threw light that enabled the
typewriter salesman to see well at night for the first time in his
adult life. He could even read the apothecary jar labels on the
store's shelves.
   Coleman investigated to see where the lamp came from and got
territorial sales rights and later production rights for it.
   Leasing lamps and maintaining them, Coleman developed a company
that he moved to Wichita in his native Kansas from Kingfisher, Okla.
in 1901.
   ``He figured out his real product was light, not lamps, so he
sold lighting service,'' said Craig Miner, a Wichita State
University history instructor who is working on a book about the
company.
   By 1914, the company developed the Coleman lantern and has since
sold more than 40 million. It was called ``the sunshine of the
night'' and was credited with lengthening farmers' days.
   Products ranging from lanters to fuel-heated irons and coffee
pots brought the company success. But W.C. Coleman wasn't a business
management genius and couldn't keep the company out of trouble
during the Great Depression.
   W.C.'s son, Robert Sheldon, who went by his middle name, stepped
in and reorganized the company's finances. By 1932 it was in good
health again. Though lanterns and campstoves remained big sellers,
Sheldon Coleman diversified into oil space heaters and gas floor
furnaces. Coleman became a major exporter.
   The Coleman G.I. Stove, which went from concept to production in
60 days, was called one of the most important pieces of non-combat
equipment in World War II. It would operate on whatever fuel was
available and in weather ranging from 125 degrees Farenheit to 60
below.
   Coleman lighting was so well known to Americans that a Battle of
the Bulge password was based on that familiarity. Sentries would
call out the challenge ``Coleman'' and wait for the answer ``lamp''
from approaching soldiers.
   But by 1960 Coleman was weakening again. Its total markets had
declined 70 percent and another diversification push started, this
time into outdoor recreation products.
   One million lanterns still are sold annually, but dozens of other
items ranging from tents to sleeping bags, coolers to ski vests,
have made Coleman the top manufacturer of outdoor recreation
products worldwide.
   It makes knives, airguns, boats, canoes, water skis, pop-up
travel trailers, emergency electric generators, lawn mowers and home
and recreational vehicle heating and air conditioning equipment.
   ``New products are the lifeblood of our company,'' said Don
Berchtold, Coleman Co. executive vice president.
   Robert Sheldon Coleman's son, Sheldon C. Coleman, spent some of
his early adult years in business in California and was ``a
temporary disappointment to the family,'' historian Miner said.
   Even when he later joined the company's management, he was most
often seen in blue jeans, a casual shirt and jogging shoes mingling
with the similarly clad employees in the outing products division he
successfully headed.
   ``Sheldon C. clearly wasn't exactly the three-piece suit,
button-down collar type of executive. And that was a change for the
traditionally conservative company,'' Miner said.
   As his alter-ego, Dewey, he plays guitar and sings in a
rock'n'roll band called Dewey and the Big Dogs. He also owns a small
recording studio and nightclub called Big Dog Studio Sound Stage.
   ``It reminds me of Malcom Forbes who rides motorcycles and hot
air balloons,'' said Miner. ``Those just aren't the kinds of things
you expect the CEO of a major company to do.''
   Sheldon C. Coleman, 36, assumed the company presidency in 1987,
became chief executive officer in 1988 and was elected chairman
following his father's death at 86 on Sept. 21.
   Although some analysts have speculated the takeover proposal is
Sheldon C.'s way of putting the company on the market, a company
insider who asked not to be identified said the Coleman clan is
committed to retaining control.
   ``He'd tell you that in a second, but the lawyers would probably
kill him,'' the anonymous Coleman executive said.
