   A man who spoke Russian entered a
store in the bazaar, opened a black briefcase and produced an
automatic weapon.
   After several minutes of negotiation, the shopkeeper paid him
200,000 afghanis, or $500, for the gun. When a reporter approached
him in the street seconds later and addressed him in English, the
man got into a green jeep without license plates and drove away.
   Who was this man?
   Merchants said he and dozens like him identify themselves as
Soviet soldiers. Since the Soviet withdrawal was completed Feb. 15,
they say, those ``soldiers'' have sold them at least 20 automatic
weapons.
   Where the men are stationed, or what they are doing here, the
shopkeepers can only guess.
   Diplomats from countries with close ties to the Soviet Union say
the only Red Army soldier in Afghanistan is the embassy military
attache. They say all the others left in February.
   The Afghan government's position on the issue has not been
clear. On Oct. 14, the official news agency Bakhtar reported the
presence of Soviet military advisers in Kabul.
   It added that they ``only handle deliveries of arms and provide
information on the specifications of arms and ammunition to the
Afghan side, and do not take part in military operations at all.''
   A day later, government spokesman Mohammed Nabi Amani said the
Bakhtar report was ``an error,'' that there were no Soviet soldiers
in Afghanistan.
   Another government official quoted an Afghan military officer as
saying Soviet soldiers operated a missile base on the outskirts of
Kabul. He said the Soviets were unwilling to train Afghan soldiers
to use the Scud rockets they provide, which require advanced
tracking methods and use of computers.
   More than 1,000 Scuds have been fired and the government has
credited them with important victories over Moslem guerrillas,
according to diplomats in Kabul and neighboring Pakistan.
   A U.S. intelligence report has alleged that Soviets in Afghan
uniforms operate the Scud base.
   Many diplomats discount the report and say Soviet soldiers no
longer are engaged in combat in Afghanistan. Some add, however,
that Soviet officers direct the civil war and the operations of
KHAD, the Afghan intelligence and secret police agency, at the
Defense and Interior ministries.
   A communist bloc journalist who visited the Defense Ministry
frequently said he discovered Soviet advisers in several
departments.
   ``Any country that is supplying billions of dollars a year to
another country is not going to sit by and let that country direct
its war effort,'' one diplomat said.
   Such influence by the Soviets over Afghanistan's security,
politics and economy has created problems between the two
governments.
   Afghan officials say privately that Soviet officials tend to
treat them like colonial subjects, and a recent incident
illustrates the point.
   Journalists were taken to a battlefield to see captured weapons.
A Soviet bodyguard armed with grenades, an assault rifle and seven
clips of ammunition accompanied a Soviet television crew.
   During the helicopter flight to Lalandar, 12 miles south of
Kabul, the bodyguard, dressed in blue jeans and a combat jacket,
ordered an Afghan officer to give up his seat and barked commands
to the pilot.
   When a Swiss journalist snapped his photograph, the guard
grabbed the camera and exposed the film.
   The journalist appealed to officials from the Foreign Ministry,
who said they could do nothing. The ministry later protested to the
Soviet Embassy.
   And the question still remains: Who was the man in the bazaar?

   The operator of a crane that collapsed and
killed five people said he was considering entering an alcohol
treatment program to ``dry out'' after his work on the high-rise
was over, his brother said Thursday.
   The crane operator, Lonnie Boggess, was among those killed in
Tuesday's accident. He had twice tried to commit suicide during the
last nine months and had been hospitalized for psychiatric
observation twice since March, according to court documents
obtained by McClatchy Newspapers.
   Boggess, 45, died with three other construction workers and a
school bus driver when the 240-ton crane he was operating plunged
16 floors in the bustling Financial District.
   Boggess' brother, John, said the machine operator had a drinking
problem and suffered from stress related to his high-risk job.
   ``He told me he was considering admitting himself to an alcohol
program to dry out after this job was over,'' said John Boggess.
   The San Francisco coroner's office said Thursday that an autopsy
would attempt to determine Boggess' blood-alcohol level at the time
of death. It will be made public in two to three weeks, the
coroner's office said.
   Family members were also ``concerned about, perhaps, a heart
problem or stroke,'' John Boggess said from his home in Exeter, a
small city in the San Joaquin Valley. But he conceded he had no
specific information that his sibling, a heavy smoker, had a heart
condition.
   ``We mostly were concerned about high cholesterol,'' said
Boggess, a sales executive. He attributed his brother's problems to
``a bitter divorce and the stress of a high-risk job.''
   Authorities were checking into reports that Boggess was seen
slumped over the controls as the crane began its plunge.
   ``We're waiting for the coroner's report to find out whether
there may have been a heart attack or something like that, because
we have heard _ they are unconfirmed reports _ that someone saw him
slumped over,'' said District Attorney Arlo Smith.
   ``We're trying to find that individual, if there is somebody,
who reported seeing that.''
   Boggess' sister, 34-year-old Genoa Hefke, said she spoke
Wednesday afternoon with a worker who was on the ground and in
radio contact with Boggess before the accident.
   She said the worker told her that the radio suddenly went silent
and that Boggess may have had a heart attack.
   ``All of a sudden he stopped answering, and then it started
rocking back and forth,'' she said.
   The state Occupational Safety and Health Administration,
meanwhile, said it is investigating reports of illegal drug use
among workers at the construction job site, The New York Times
reported in its Friday editions.
   Hamilton H. Fairburn, the agency's deputy director, said OSHA
would conduct toxicological tests on the bodies of Boggess and
three other workers who died, the Times reported.
   Boggess was in the crane's cab 200 feet above the ground when
the accident occurred. The crane was being raised from the 16th
floor to the 20th floor of a high-rise under construction for the
Federal Home Loan Bank.
   The reports of Boggess' alcoholism and suicide attempts appeared
in Thursday's editions of The Sacramento Bee and The Morning News
Tribune of Tacoma, Wash., where Boggess lived.
   Boggess' employer, the Erection Co. of Kirkland, Wash., refused
to comment.
   Officials at Swinerton &amp; Walberg Co., the general contractor for
the high-rise project, ``had no knowledge of his personal life,''
said company spokesman Larry Duggan.
   The contractor said the accident apparently was triggered when
the head of the crane accidentally rotated 180 degrees while the
crane's height was being increased, an operation that requires the
machine to be perfectly balanced. However, it said in a statement
that the rotation occurred ``for unknown reasons.''
   State officials say they are focusing on mechanical or human
error, giving ``low priority to such factors as wind or structural
failure,'' said Hamilton Fairburn, deputy chief of the state
Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

<HEAD>Western Companies said Negotiating to Market Soviet Fighter Jets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungry for foreign currency and Western consumer
technology, the Soviet Union is seeking to sell its MiG-29
warplanes in the West, a respected journal of military affairs
reports.
   Jane's Defense Weekly says in its issue published Wednesday that
Western companies are negotiating to buy MiG-29 ``Fulcrum''
fighters, first operational in 1985, for research and experimental
purposes.
   The Soviet Aviation Ministry recently hosted a joint venture
group of six American, British, West German and Danish businessmen
who could act as a sales outlet for up to 150 MiG-29s at $20
million apiece, Jane's said.
   Quoting an unnamed businessman who participated, Jane's said a
Soviet Aviation Ministry agency told the visitors that the ``whole
range of MiGs,'' was available to Western customers, as well as the
Sukhoi Su-25 ``Frogfoot.''
   The MiG is named after the initials of its original designers,
Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich. ``Fulcrum'' and ``Frogfoot''
are NATO codenames.
   MiGs have long been a symbol of superpower rivalry. They
featured in the Korean and Vietnam wars, in the Soviet-supplied air
forces of Arab countries against the U.S.-supplied Israelis, and
now in the Ethiopian civil war.
   Starting with the MiG-15 and leading up to today's MiG-31, each
new generation and its Western rivals symbolized a fresh escalation
of the East-West arms race.
   Jane's said the U.S. Defense Department declined to comment. The
British Defense Ministry said it knew nothing of the reported
proposals.
   Jane's said the businessmen's visit was prompted by the apparent
grounding of MiG-23 ``Flogger'' aircraft said to be used by the
U.S. Air Force in aggressor training roles at Nellis Air Force Base
in Nevada.
   It said the U.S.-operated MiGs were reportedly obtained from
Egypt in an arms deal involving U.S.-made F-16s, and were grounded
because of their poor condition.
   Jane's quoted one of the businessmen as saying the joint venture
group has already mediated to provide these MiG-23s with spare
engines.
   A businessman was quoted as saying the Soviets were keen to sell
modern warplanes to the West because they are ``almost desperate to
bring in foreign currency and modern consumer technology such as
telefax machines, microwave cookers, desktop and hand-held
computers ...
   ``They used to request very large deposits, but now they're
acting like normal businessmen.''

<TEXT>
   In a sign of further liberalization, East
Germany says it will allow dissident songwriter and singer Wolf
Biermann to perform in the country for the first time since his
1976 expulsion.
   The official news agency ADN said Wednsday that Biermann, who
lives in West Germany, would give performances in Leipzig and East
Berlin on Friday and Saturday.
   Culture Minister Dietmar Keller told ADN Biermann's visit had
been approved ``at the wish of many East German artists.''
   Biermann was stripped of his East German citizenship and banned
from returning home after making critical remarks about the
country's Communist government during a tour of West Germany.
   He was allowed to make a three-day trip to East Germany in 1982
to visit a dying friend.
   As recently as Nov. 4, East German authorities had prevented
Biermann from attending a huge demonstration in East Berlin,
turning him back from the border.
   Biermann became a symbolic figure for East Germany's dissident
artists, many of whom emigrated to West Germany following his
expulsion.

   A southern China company will barter $94 million
worth of clothes, electrical goods and daily necessities for six
medium-range Soviet passenger jets, an official newspaper said
today.
   The China Daily said the Land Economic Group, a collectively
owned company based in the special economic zone of Hainan Island,
would soon sign the agreement with the Soviet Aviation Import and
Export Corp.
   It quoted the Chinese company's president as saying the three
Tupolev-154 and three Yak-42 planes would be sold to local airlines
in Jiangsu, Fujian and Sichuan provinces.
   The report said there was real potential for such deals since
both countries are short of hard currency. China would be able to
supply consumer goods _ piling up due to a domestic economic
slowdown _ to a Soviet Union plagued by chronic shortages of such
products.

   The head of the people's front of the Soviet
Republic of Lithuania says he expects President Bush to ask Mikhail
Gorbachev in Malta for guarantees not to use force against peaceful
independence movements in the Baltic republic.
   ``We have the right to be an independent state,'' Vytautas
Landsbergis, chairman of the people's front, or Sajudis, told The
Associated Press on Wednesday.
   He said he asked U.S. policymakers to seek a commitment that the
Soviet Army or KGB security police will not crack down on
secessionist movements in Lithuania or the neighboring republics of
Latvia or Estonia.
   ``My information is that they will'' seek such a commitment,
said Landsbergis, who met Wednesday with Raymond Seitz, assistant
secretary of state for European Affairs.
   Landsbergis, in an interview with AP editors and reporters,
declined to disclose details of his discussions with Seitz. U.S.
officials have not specified what Bush will tell Gorbachev when he
meets with him in this weekend's shipboard summit off the coast of
Malta.
   Landsbergis, a 57-year-old musicologist, praised the United
States for refusing to recognize the Soviet Union's forced
annexation of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia at the end of World War
II.
   The Soviet parliament this week passed legislation to give the
Baltic republics a large degree of economic autonomy from Moscow, a
significant step toward independence.
   ``The recent legislation should mean we will be able to be less
attached to the colonial (centrally planned Soviet) system, and
should have more room to maneuver,'' he said.
   Last March, in the most democratic elections in Soviet history,
Sajudis candidates won 36 of 42 seats allocated to Lithuania in the
national Congress of People's Deputies.
   Landsbergis predicted that Sajudis would win a majority in
elections scheduled for February for the Lithuanian parliament,
which he said would then negotiate for independence from the Soviet
Union.
   ``But Moscow might not hear our declaration,'' he said.
   Therefore, Landsbergis said he asked U.S. officials to seek
guarantees of non-intervention and to raise the issue at the United
Nations or another international forum.
   ``We have received support from the United States for decades in
that it has refused to recognize the legality of Soviet annexation.
And that has had great importance to us,'' he said. ``Now that the
Baltic issue has become a matter of international importance, we
would like U.S. policy to become even more active.
   ``We would like the Baltic occupation to be raised at the Malta
summit as an international issue that has not been resolved,'' he
said. ``Soviet efforts to portray the Baltic issue as an internal
affair have failed.''
   Sajudis' immediate goals, he said, are to ``have a pluralistic,
multi-party system, and in conjunction with that, to eliminate the
monopoly by the Communist Party and the privileges that go with
it.''
   ``The object is to re-establish sovereignty not only as an
expression of our own legitimate right, but because we feel that it
is useful for Eastern Europe in general and also very useful for
the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   ``We already have that which we would call spiritual
independence. Our people have lost their fear and openly speak
their minds,'' Landsbergis said.
   Asked whether a sovereign Lithuania would join the Kremlin-led
Warsaw Pact military alliance, Landsbergis said, ``It is possible
that it will be a condition for gaining our independence.''
   Soviet and Lithuanian negotiators will sit down at a bargaining
table in the foreseeable future to hammer out details of Lithuanian
independence, he predicted, ``and it may well be that Moscow will
make entry into the Warsaw Pact one of the conditions.''

<HEAD>Six New Sites Chosen for Rail-Based MX</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon, as President Bush departs for
the Malta summit with Mikhail Gorbachev, says it will move ahead
with plans making the giant MX nuclear missile a rail-mounted
weapon.
   The 50 intercontinental ballistic missiles _ which are to be
stored at military sites scattered around the country and moved on
trains during times of crisis _ are designed to launch a
devastating retaliation in the face of any Soviet attack.
   The Air Force announced Wednesday that the 50 missiles in
underground silos in Wyoming will be moved to ``garrisons,'' or
shelters, at military installations in Wyoming, Louisiana, Texas,
Washington, North Dakota, Arkansas and Michigan.
   The dispersal will allow the weapons to survive a surprise
strike, the Air Force argued, as well as provide ``the potential
for prompt retaliation vital to the successful deterrence of war.''
   The new system is expected to be completed by 1994, the Air
Force said.
   The Soviets have two land-based mobile ICBMs, the SS-25 and
SS-24.
   The 50 MX missiles _ dubbed the ``Peacekeeper'' by former
President Reagan _ will be placed on 25 trains, each with two MX
missiles aboard. The trains will be kept on seven Air Force bases
and moved onto civilian railroad tracks in time of crisis.
   The announcement came Wednesday as Bush prepared to depart for
his Malta meeting with Gorbachev. Secretary of State James A. Baker
III said the meeting will permit the leaders ``to be in much better
shape and much better prepared'' to reach an agreement on slashing
such long-range weaponry at their second summit set for next year.
   U.S. and Soviet leaders have expressed hopes of signing an
agreement at that later meeting to cut strategic weapons by as much
as 50 percent.
   But Wednesday's announcement also represents the Bush
administration's commitment to push ahead with plans to modernize
the nation's strategic nuclear missile force, even amid projections
of Pentagon belt-tightening, heightened prospects for arms-control
agreements and sweeping changes in the Soviet Union and its Warsaw
Pact allies.
   The new basing system is the latest step in the controversial
missile's 18-year history.
   The MX _ which stands for missile experimental _ was first
proposed in 1971. In its early development, it was seen as a mobile
missile designed to prevent the Soviets from knowing where to aim
to destroy it.
   Subsequently, the Air Force studied more than 30 ``basing
modes,'' including trucking it around the country, submerging it in
lakes, or keeping it airborne on special planes.
   In 1979, President Carter proposed shuttling the weapon on
``racetracks'' in southern Utah and eastern Nevada, but Reagan
rejected that plan in 1981.
   Congress, in a four-year battle with the administration, slashed
Reagan's request for 100 of the missiles to 50, and they were
placed in hardened underground silos. In 1986, Reagan proposed
shifting to the rail-based system advocated by the Air Force.
   Earlier this year, Bush opted to move forward with two mobile
intercontinental ballistic missile systems by putting the
10-warhead MX on trains while also building the smaller,
truck-based Midgetman.
   Bush's decision has run into considerable opposition in Congress
_ both among those who contend the two-prong program is too
expensive and among those who favor one weapon or the other.
   Bush signed a military spending bill last week that establishes
a $1.1 billion fund for both the MX and the Midgetman, with the
exact spending split left to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   The cost of taking the nation's 50 MX missiles out of their
underground silos at Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming and building
the new ``garrisons,'' or shelters, is expected to be at least $5.6
billion, said a Pentagon source who requested anonymity.
   ``Hopefully, it will be completed by 1994, but that clearly
depends on the budget,'' the source said.
   The Pentagon said the missile trains will be housed at Warren
and these other Air Force bases: Barksdale in Louisiana, Dyess in
Texas, Fairchild in Washington, Grand Forks in North Dakota, Little
Rock in Arkansas and Wurtsmith in Michigan.
   Warren AFB will be the center of the MX operation and the
training site for the garrison crews.

<HEAD>Rail Car Shortage May Affect Agriculture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the biggest agricultural problems of
the next decade will be a shortage of railroad cars for
transporting grain, a railroad spokesman says.
   Jim Howarth, CSX assistant vice president, said Wednesday that
his company has about 13,000 covered hopper cars, but that
nationwide the fleet is shrinking.
   CSX, one of the nation's largest freight railway companies,
operates between the East Coast and Chicago and as far south as New
Orleans.
   Howarth said railroad companies don't get enough profit from
hauling grain, and that big freight companies will abandon more and
more lines for lack of business in many rural areas.
   ``You can't get away from the fact that the railroad system was
overbuilt for today's transportation,'' Howarth said, adding that
his company supports the growth of shortline rail companies to
carry products short distances or to larger freight train systems.
   Wallace Burnett of the Transportation Department said some
business might return to railroads as the cost and congestion of
trucking increases.
   Howarth and Burnett spoke at Outlook '90, a three-day conference
sponsored by the Agriculture Department to examine farm policies
and factors that affect them.
   Howarth said that when CSX decides to discontinue a line, it
looks for a shortline operator to take over.
   ``We want to see as many lines as possible continue operating,''
he said. ``Shortline owners are sometimes public entities, but 90
percent tend to be private owners who feel they can make a go of a
piece of railroad that a big company can't.''
   CSX, Howarth said, recommends that grain companies buy their own
railroad cars to ensure transportation is available.
   During another segment of the conference Wednesday, a housing
consultant described the plight of elderly farm workers who often
find themselves with no money and no home when they retire.
   Joseph Belden, deputy executive director of the Housing
Assistance Council, said a study he conducted showed no federal
housing projects exist specifically for farm workers.
   Although they often qualify for subsidized housing under other
programs, the biggest problem is that farm workers tend to stop
working about age 45 rather than 62 as required to qualify for
retirement housing under many federal programs.
   ``Because of the working conditions, this group is going to be
older at a younger age,'' Belden said, describing the back-breaking
toil and harsh lifestyle of migrant farmworkers.
   He said there was anecdotal evidence to show that many farm
workers don't get Social Security benefits, either because their
employers never withheld payments from their wages or because they
were stolen by dishonest employers.
   Another problem facing rural planners is poverty among children.
   Carolyn Rogers, a USDA demographer, said studies show that since
the late 1970s there has been an increase in poverty among both
urban and rural occupants.
   Rogers said that in 1987 about 24 percent of the children in
rural areas were below the poverty line. Another 9 percent were
considered ``near poor,'' which means they are either right at the
poverty line or in families that make just 149 percent of the
poverty threshold.
   The poverty threshold of a three-person family with one child
under 18 was $9,142 in 1987 and for a four-person family with two
children under 18 it was $11,519.
   Rogers said much attention had been paid to the breakdown of
families in central cities, but statistics show that the number of
rural children living with just one parent also has increased _
from 14 percent in 1960 to 25 percent in 1988. About 29 percent of
urban children live with one parent.
   Rural development policies need to include education and
employment that lead to greater earnings for parents and improved
financial conditions for their children, Rogers said.
   ``The type of childhood experienced in the rural community will
undoubtedly affect the decisions of the next generation about
remaining in the community,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Providing security for the superpower
summit is a huge task for this tiny country, which will dedicate
its entire military and most of its police to protecting the
American and Soviet presidents.
   The shipboard location of this weekend's summit between
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in Marsaxlokk
Harbor has added to security problems and stretched Maltese
resources, one official said.
   But Prime Minister Edward Fenech Adami and others say no special
security problems are posed by Libya, which is about 220 miles
north of Marsaxlokk Harbor, or by the ability of Libyans to travel
freely here.
   Maltese officials say they are confident their 1,200-member
armed forces and 1,800-member police force can protect the leaders
during their three-day stay.
   ``I think our police forces and armed forces are equipped enough
and trained enough to provide the necessary security,'' Fenech
Adami said in an interview Wednesday.
   ``Being a small country does not mean that security problems are
larger,'' he said. ``In fact, on the contrary, being a small
country, both as to the size of the country itself and the size of
the population, can render security less of a problem.''
   Fenech Adami, who met with Libyan Col. Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday
in Tripoli, said Gadhafi is in favor of the summit and objects only
to it being held on warships in the Mediterranean.
   ``I see no special security threat,'' said armed forces
commander Brig. John Spiteri. ``We've always had good relations
with the Libyans. ... They have never given us any trouble and
there is no reason to suppose they will this time.
   ``We haven't identified a serious threat from anybody,'' said
Spiteri, who commands the security operation. ``But, of course,
that can make security concerns more difficult.''
   Spiteri said that if there were a specific threat against either
Bush or Gorbachev during the summit meetings Saturday and Sunday,
authorities could look for it and plan accordingly.
   One senior government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said holding the summit aboard the guided missile
cruiser USS Belknap and the Soviet missile cruiser Slava had added
to security concerns.
   ``If the summit was only on land, you have just one restricted
area to close off,'' the official said. ``But since the leaders
will be moving on the island and staying on the ships, we will have
to close off areas both on the land and the water.''
   He said the government will close the port to commercial traffic
_ other than small fishing vessels _ for the three days the leaders
are in Malta, and close the air space above the harbor to private
aircraft. For security reasons, the government has stopped work on
a construction project inside the harbor that employed 800 workers,
who still will be paid.
   Spiteri said one Maltese boat will patrol outside the entrance
to the harbor and another around the two warships anchored in the
center, keeping all pleasure craft and fishing boats at least 200
or 300 meters away from the cruisers.
   Soldiers will patrol the shoreline and seal off an area near the
St. Luciano Tower, a 16th century watch tower built by the Knights
of Malta on a jagged cliff that juts out into the harbor at the
point closest to the warships.
   Police plan to set up roadblocks and checkpoints near the harbor
and close off some roads to the public.
   The security force will include Malta's entire military force
and most of its police, including an anti-terrorist squad of about
100 members.
   A source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the three-day
security operation is expected to cost the government the
equivalent of $150,000 in overtime costs, plus at least $400,000
from the closing of the harbor and Malta Freeport and from stopping
construction on the terminal.
   ``We assume the Soviet and U.S. governments obviously will cover
the commercial costs and expenses,'' said the source. ``We do not
expect that the two superpowers will expect a small country like
Malta to bear the costs of a superpower summit.''

<HEAD>Some Farmers Getting Around Subsidy Limits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department's watchdog agency
says some large farming operations are successfully using highly
complex methods to get around federal limits on crop subsidies.
   Despite recent reforms ordered by Congress, these farming
operations have been able to dodge a $50,000 limit on federal crop
subsidies and probably will continue collecting the fat subsidies
again this year.
   The department's Office of Inspector General said 1987
legislation failed to effectively limit the use of ``multiple legal
entities'' to avoid the payment curbs. Other loopholes were also
cited.
   A new audit report released to The Associated Press on Wednesday
included an example of how the curbs are circumvented:
   One operation reviewed by auditors in Tunica, Miss., created 51
irrevocable trusts in 1989 so as not to have payments reduced by
further restrictions taking effect this year.
   The remodeled operation involved three joint ventures controlled
by two intermingled families, which had included 43 ``persons'' in
1988.
   Auditors said the 43 ``persons'' consisted of six individuals
and 37 corporations. Owners of the 37 corporations consisted of 11
individuals and one corporation.
   ``Seven of the individual owners were the immediate members of
the two families (a father and two daughters, and a father, two
sons and a daughter) that controlled the operation,'' the report
said.
   If the complex arrangement had remained as it was in 1988, it
would have collected no more than $700,000 in payments in 1989. But
with reorganization, the operation is expected to collect as much
as $1,431,576 in subsidies this year.
   ``One of the family members of this organization told us that
the main purpose of the reorganization was to maintain the maximum
program benefits,'' the report said. ``He said it became a
challenge to see if he could get a trust established for all of the
operation's full-time employees. He called it a profit-sharing
plan.''
   Although the reorganization was allowed by current regulations,
auditors said the trusts are believed to be ``flow-through
entities'' to avoid new regulations last year limiting a person's
membership in more than three entities.
   ``We conclude this because about $1.3 billion per year will be
routed back to the seven immediate family members through
management fees, equipment and land leases, and loans,'' the report
said.
   The heart of the crop subsidies are federal ``deficiency''
payments used to make up part of the difference between a higher
target level and a lower market price are supposed to be limited to
$50,000 per person. As an example, last month's average corn price
at the farm was $2.20 per bushel. The target price for 1989 corn is
$2.84.
   ``However, our review determined that producers have found new,
innovative ways to reorganize farming operations so that 1989
payments will not be limited significantly by the legislative
changes,'' the report said.
   The audit report followed one sent to Congress describing the
USDA inspector general's activities for the six-month period that
ended Sept. 30.
   In that review, the excessive crop subsidies were noted among a
number of abuses checked by USDA investigators and auditors. The
audit report released Wednesday dealt specifically with operations
of crop programs handled by the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   The auditors checked five state offices of the agency and 14
county offices. In the counties, 822 of 7,424 farm operating plans
were selected for preliminary review. Finally, 52 farms were chosen
for in-depth analysis. No individual names were released.
   States and counties selected for in-depth review included:
   Arkansas: Jefferson, Crittenden and Phillips counties;
California: Butte and Kern; Louisiana: Morehouse, Natchitoches and
Tensas; Mississippi: De Soto, Noxubee and Tunica; and Texas:
Jackson, Jefferson and Lubbock.
   The review of 52 farming operations identified 12 that
reorganized so that all entities _ which can be individuals,
corporation, association, trust or other legal entities _ could
continue receiving payments as ``persons'' under the program.

   The Chicago lawyer who investigated the ethics
case of former House Speaker Jim Wright is rejecting a report that
he unfairly lobbied Ethics Committee members by taking them to
expensive Washington restaurants.
   A new book on Wright's tenure as speaker, ``The Ambition and the
Power,'' contends that Richard J. Phelan ``routinely took committee
members out to dinner at some of the most expensive restaurants in
Washington'' as part of a calculated campaign to win his case.
   The book by Washington free-lance writer John Barry, published
this month by Viking, contends Phelan ran up a $150,000 expense
account while seeking to curry favor with what amounted to Wright's
jury.
   ``That is absolutely nonsense,'' said Phelan, who is running for
president of the Cook County Board, the top elective post in the
county that includes Chicago.
   He said he did take several committee members out to lunch and
dinner, but when he did, ``it was cheapsville'' _ the House dining
room or a low-priced Chinese restaurant.
   The $150,000 figure represented food, lodging and other expenses
for a staff of 10 people over a seven-month period, he said.
   ``The idea that some lawyer from Chicago could come out and
schmooze 12 hard-nosed congressmen into bulldozing the speaker of
the House ... defies any kind of logic at all,'' Phelan said.
   Barry, during the two years he spent working on the book, was
granted unusually broad access to otherwise private meetings of the
House leadership and meetings with staff and other lawmakers. He
also obtained access to some transcripts from closed-door meetings
of the ethics panel.
   In June, Wright became the first speaker in history to resign
under fire in mid-term after the ethics panel formally charged him
with 69 violations of House rules.
   How much Phelan's lobbying of the ethics committee affected the
outcome of the case will remain in dispute. Detailed expense
records for Phelan's investigation are not available to the public.
The records are kept by a House Administration subcommittee chaired
by Rep. Joseph Gaydos, D-Pa., who also is a member of the ethics
committee.
   Despite its sympathy with Wright's plight before the ethics
committee, the book concludes that the former speaker's downfall
was largely the result of his own arrogance.
   House Republicans had long complained about his heavy-handed way
of running the chamber, and they believed he overreached to take
control of Central America policy from President Reagan. By the
time his ethics problems cropped up Wright had become a lonely
figure, estranged even from his own power base among Democrats.
   The book contrasts what it calls Phelan's conscious strategy of
playing to the political side of the committee with what it
portrays as a weak and inept defense of Wright by his lawyer,
William C. Oldaker. Oldaker appeared not to recognize that
committee members were worried about justifying their decision on
Wright to the public and the news media, Barry writes.
   Oldaker once angrily quoted Phelan as having told him, ``This
case will be decided by the editorial pages of the nation's
newspapers,'' according to the book.
   Wright, while contending that he never broke House rules, also
seemed to believe that the rules shouldn't apply to him, Barry
concludes.
   A former close aide, Craig Raupe, once said, ``I don't
understand how Jim Wright can be so politically in tune and then be
almost totally blind to appearances,'' Barry writes.
   The book also contains glimpses inside the sometimes profane and
rough world of leadership meetings. At one, members were discussing
whether to assign a member who is Jewish to the Foreign Affairs
Committee.
   Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.,
objected.
   ``You can't put him there. There are already four kikes on that
committee,'' he is quoted as saying. A Rostenkowski spokesman
denied the statement was ever made, but Barry said he was certain
of the remark.

<HEAD>Abortion Rights Advocates Face Challenge in Parental Notification
Cases</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the battle for public opinion on abortion,
a daunting challenge confronts those who say young girls should be
able to obtain abortions without first telling their parents.
   The problem for abortion rights advocates is that most Americans
view the issue _ now under Supreme Court study _ primarily as one
of parental rights.
   Many who support the Supreme Court's 1973 decision that women
have a constitutional right to abortion also favor parental
involvement when minors seek abortions, public opinion polls
indicate.
   The Supreme Court, after hearing arguments Wednesday in cases
from Minnesota and Ohio, must decide whether states may outlaw
abortions for most unmarried girls under 18 unless their parents
are notified or a judge's approval is given.
   About half the states have such laws, although most of them have
been blocked by court challenges.
   Those who oppose notification laws may be in danger of being
perceived as enemies of parents and families.
   That perception has not escaped anti-abortion forces stung by
the momentum their movement lost after July's Supreme Court
decision giving states more power to regulate abortions.
   ``It defies common sense to suggest that children should be
allowed to undergo ... surgery without the foreknowledge of their
parents,'' Ann-Louise Lohr, an attorney with Americans United for
Life, said after Wednesday's high court session.
   ``The common-sense solution (is) that parents be informed of
their minor daughter's medical situation,'' she said.
   Cleveland lawyer Linda Sogg, however, earlier told the justices
that not all young girls have loving and supportive parents. Some
young girls must be protected from abusive mothers and fathers, she
said.
   Of the approximately 180,000 girls under 18 who obtain abortions
each year, about half are accompanied by one or both parents when
they go for the operation.
   Ms. Sogg argued that state parental notification laws likely do
not affect such girls, but others who may be better off not telling
their parents need to be protected from intrusive state regulation.
   Whatever the court says about parental notification laws, in
decisions expected by July, will not necessarily endanger the 1973
Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion.
   The consensus among lawyers on both sides of the abortion issue
is that the justices will not use the Minnesota and Ohio cases as
vehicles to reassess the 1973 ruling.
   But James Bopp, general counsel of the National Right to Life
Committee, disagrees. ``Roe vs. Wade is on the table,'' he said.
``The court has to decide whether there is a right to abortion''
before saying whether a particular parental notification law
violates any right.
   If the parental notification cases are to carry any impact for
adult women, the words of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor will be
decisive.
   O'Connor, who as the court's sole woman never has said
explicitly whether she believes an abortion right exists,
controlled the outcome of last July's ruling.
   She has never voted to invalidate a state regulation on
abortion, but seemed greatly troubled by Minnesota's requirement
that both biological parents be notified.
   The question is whether O'Connor could vote to strike down the
Minnesota law without stating, or at least implying, that it
violates some constitutional right enjoyed by young girls.
   Four justices support the 1973 conclusion that abortion is
constitutionally protected. Four justices appear ready to abandon
that decision.
   If O'Connor, a critic of the rationale used in Roe vs. Wade,
decides to articulate some alternative approach, she will have
charted a new course for the future of abortion law.

<HEAD>Government Needs More Muscle in Substandard Medicare Care: Panel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a House committee say the
government needs more disciplinary muscle against doctors and
hospitals that provide substandard care for Medicare patients.
   The recommendation was in a report Wednesday by the House
Government Operations Committee that also criticized the Department
of Health and Human Services for a four-year delay in writing
regulations to implement a law that gives the agency more power to
punish health-care providers.
   The law, enacted in 1985, allows HHS to deny payment to
hospitals and physicians in cases where substandard care is
provided.
   The department is working on the regulations, said Dennis
Siebert, a spokesman for the Health Care Financing Administration.
That agency handles Medicare, the government health care program
for 33 million elderly, blind and disabled Americans.
   ``They're fairly controversial and complex regulations,'' he
said. ``We've spent a lot of time consulting with medical care
industry.''
   Physicians may be terminated from participating in Medicare or
fined up to the amount of the care provided, but only in cases
where there has been a clear pattern of incompetence by physicians
who were ``unwilling or unable'' to improve their treatment.
   The report said the standard that must be met is too stringent
because it allows physicians to escape punishment by agreeing to
take an educational course to indicate their willingness to
improve. It also said the monetary penalty is too low.
   HHS Inspector General Richard Kusserow has recommended that
Congress strengthen the standard and raise the fine to $10,000 per
case.
   The report, based on a three-year investigation by the panel's
Human Resources and Intergovernmental Relations Subcommittee,
estimated that more than 800,000 errors are made each year by
doctors and hospitals caring for Medicare patients.
   The most common error was not having adequate discharge plans
for post-hospital care, the report said. That was the case for
about 3 percent of the Medicare admissions selected randomly and
reviewed by peer review organizations in 1989, the report said.
   Extrapolating that to the 11 million annual Medicare admissions
amounts to 330,000 failures.
   ``The large number of beneficiaries who may be at risk of
inadequate hospital-discharge planning is of special concern to the
committee due to fears that the PPS system (Medicare's system for
paying hospitals) ... is resulting in patients being discharged
faster and less stable,'' the report said.
   Eight Republicans on the 39-member committee cautioned in an
accompanying document that the error estimate was derived by
extrapolating from reviews, called generic screens, that are
designed to detect potential problems.
   An error can result from merely failing to sign a form in the
proper place, they said.
   ``If an exhaustive look were taken at all generic screen
failures, we are convinced the number of quality problems would be
far below the committee report's projections,'' they said.
   Under the PPS system, or prospective payment system created in
1983 as a Medicare cost-saving measure, hospitals are paid a flat
fee for each treatment they provide. The fee assumes a certain
length of hospital stay and medical services.

<HEAD>Pentagon Estimates $1.7 Billion Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon estimates it will be forced to
slash about $1.7 billion from its planned 1990 spending because of
the effect of the Gramm-Rudman budget reduction law.
   Pentagon spokesman Jim Turner said Wednesday it wasn't
immediately clear what the exact impact of the cuts would be, or
how they would affect manpower decisions.
   Turner called the figure a ``preliminary estimate'' pending
formal notification from the Office of Management and Budget.
   ``We're still trying to figure out how it's all going to fall,''
Turner said.
   Had the terms of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law been
fully enforced over a year, defense programs would have been pared
by $8 billion, or half the $16 billion spending reductions the law
would have automatically imposed on most federal programs.
   President Bush said repeatedly in recent weeks that he preferred
retaining the across-the-board cuts for a full year to accepting
congressional efforts to reduce the deficit, which he said
contained phony savings.
   Pentagon officials had warned of severe cutbacks in military
personnel and weapons acquisition if the Gramm-Rudman cuts had been
left in place the entire year.
   The development comes as Bush signed, with reservations, a bill
authorizing $305 billion for defense programs for the current
fiscal year, including a cut in his request for the Strategic
Defense Initiative.
   The measure cuts $1.1 billion from Bush's $4.9 billion request
for spending on the SDI program, or Star Wars, in the fiscal year
that began Oct. 1.
   Bush said in a statement that the measure would provide
sufficient funds to ``provide a national defense sufficient to meet
foreseeable threats to the national security'' in the coming year.
   The legislation represents the first cut in the SDI program in
six years.
   The bill also trimmed his request for other major strategic
programs such as the MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles and the B-2
stealth bomber.
   The legislation reduces the ceiling on the number of U.S. troops
overseas by about 15,000. Those troops were associated with
intermediate-range nuclear weapons, banned by a U.S.-Soviet treaty
signed in December 1988.

   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp is moving aggressively
to clean up scandal-plagued programs but it's too soon to say
whether his efforts will be successful, the agency's chief watchdog
says in a report to Congress.
   Despite Kemp's efforts, staffing problems caused by budget
constraints threaten to undermine even the best attempts to rid the
Department of Housing and Urban Development of mismanagement and
political influence, Inspector General Paul A. Adams said in the
report issued Wednesday.
   ``The department and OIG (Office of the Inspector General) face
critical staffing shortages resulting'' from across-the-board
budget cuts made under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law,
Adams said in his semiannual report to Congress.
   ``Adequate staffing, continuity of leadership and management
accountability are essential if the reform measures are to work,''
he said.
   Adams said that while it was premature to grade the substance of
Kemp's efforts, the secretary ``has already taken aggressive
corrective actions and proposed widespread reform measures,
including the elimination of programs not benefiting the needy.''
   Adams said the media and congressional attention HUD has
received since April, when his report on a rehabilitation program
riddled with wasteful spending and political favoritism was issued,
have complemented Kemp's reform efforts.
   ``The positive aspect of the current situation is that it
creates an environment in which needed reform can take place,''
Adams said. ``While it is too soon to predict the reform actions'
success, I will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of those
measures.''
   Kemp, in a separate report to Congress, said his management team
had resolved 97 percent of the nearly 1,700 internal audit
recommendations awaiting management action when he took over HUD
early this year.
   ``HUD's management team is aggressively cleaning up problems
which, over many years and during several administrations, have
made well-intentioned programs susceptible to fraud, political
influence and the waste of taxpayers' hard-earned dollars,'' Kemp
said.
   Adams' report recounted the problems found in virtually all of
HUD's major housing and loan programs _ fraud, waste and
mismanagement with a pricetag estimated at more than $6 billion.
   The government, Adams said, could save millions if Congress
would amend federal housing laws to allow refinancing of HUD-backed
mortgages at today's more favorable interest rates. He renewed his
call for Congress to grant inspectors general subpoena powers to
force witnesses to cooperate with investigations.
   He warned that HUD's Government National Mortgage Association _
often referred to as ``Ginnie Mae'' _ saw its default portfolio
grow from $3.1 billion to $12.5 billion last year, in large part
because of bad real estate markets in ``oil patch'' states.
   Adams said the agency needs to increase its reserves to offset
losses and take steps to reduce future defaults.
   Kemp acknowledged in his report that no steps had been taken to
improve GNMA management, but said an analysis was underway.
   Since April, Adams said HUD has recovered more than $25 million
owed the government, implemented reforms that saved $21 million and
committed itself to recovering another $50 million.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Donald Riegle, voicing frustration with
the controversy over the nation's biggest savings and loan failure,
says news reports downplay evidence that he and four other senators
did nothing improper.
   ``Very sensationalized stories have run, putting such a sinister
colorization on this thing,'' Riegle, D-Mich., said Wednesday. ``I
resent it. I think it's unfair.''
   He said little attention was given to sworn testimony by federal
regulators that the senators did not influence the regulators'
actions toward Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association. Such testimony
``basically blows away the story,'' he said.
   Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has said
little publicly about his role in the battle between federal
regulators and Lincoln, which the government seized in April.
Regulators estimate the thrift's failure will cost the taxpayers $2
billion, making it the costliest S&amp;L collapse in the nation's
history.
   The Senate Ethics Committee has hired an independent counsel to
examine allegations that five senators improperly intervened with
regulators on Lincoln's behalf. The senators are Riegle; Alan
Cranston, D-Calif; John McCain, R-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; and
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.
   All the senators except Riegle attended an April 2, 1987,
meeting with Edwin J. Gray, then chairman of the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board. Gray says the senators improperly pressured him to drop
a regulation that would have curtailed risky savings and loan
investments.
   Riegle joined the other senators at an April 9, 1987, meeting
with California regulators who were investigating Lincoln.
   All five received large campaign donations from former Lincoln
owner Charles H. Keating Jr. Riegle returned the $78,250 he
received from Keating and associates.
   In an interview, Riegle voiced frustration over allegations that
Keating bought the senators' influence. He said Gray and other
regulators who testified before the House Banking Committee
repeatedly said the senators did not influence them.
   ``They were absolutely clear-cut on that issue and they said it
over and over again,'' he said.
   Some of the senators have described their involvement as a
normal constituent service. Riegle, however, said he did not
consider his attendance at the April 9 meeting a constituent
service _ even though he had visited Keating properties in Arizona
the previous year and Keating had purchased and renovated the
Pontchartrain Hotel in Detroit.
   ``I went as a member of the banking committee,'' he said. ``The
responsibility for handling their situation was in the hands of
others who had them as a direct constituent.''
   He said he was confident the ethics committee would find that
``all my actions were entirely proper'' and that case would do him
no long-term political damage.

<HEAD>Icahn Seeks Permission to Acquire 25 Percent of USX Corp.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investor Carl C. Icahn is making another play
for USX Corp., the giant oil, gas and steel concern.
   Icahn, who announced plans to acquire sizable stakes in
Pittsburgh-based USX twice before, disclosed Wednesday that he is
requesting federal approval to acquire at least 25 percent of the
corporation.
   Icahn, known for his past corporate takeover attempts, owns
Trans World Airlines Inc.
   USX finished down 12{ cents at $33.62{ in New York Stock
Exchange trading Wednesday. Icahn's disclosure came after the
markets closed.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Icahn
revealed that he was seeking permission from the Federal Trade
Commission to increase his stake in USX. FTC antitrust clearance
for such an acquisition is required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act.
   USX spokesman William Kessler said the company was aware of
Icahn's filing but had no comment. Icahn, Kessler said, made
similar requests in late 1987 and late 1988 but never boosted his
stake to the amount requested with the allotted year.
   ``This is the third time he's filed,'' Kessler said. ``This is a
renewable thing.''
   According to the SEC filing, made public just after 5 p.m.
Wednesday, Icahn owned nearly 34 million, or 13.26 percent, of
USX's outstanding shares of common stock.
   The SEC document noted that in November 1988, Icahn made a
Hart-Scott-Rodino filing indicating his intention to acquire more
than 15 percent of USX's voting securities ``and, depending upon
market conditions, more than 25 percent'' of its voting securities.
   But because his group did not acquire in excess of 15 percent
within a year, a new filing is required to permit acquisition above
15 percent, said the filing.
   In the latest SEC filing, Icahn said he was doing so under
Hart-Scott-Rodino ``indicating that the registrants have a good
faith intention'' to acquire more than 15 percent and up to 25
percent of USX's voting securities.
   The filing said the acquisition was dependent on market
conditions and redemption or invalidation of a ``poison pill'
shareholder rights plan adopted by USX on Oct. 10 in an attempt to
ward off a hostile takeover.
   The USX plan would take effect once a person or group acquired
at least 15 percent of the company's common stock.
   Under the plan, shareholders would be issued one stock right for
each common share they already hold. The USX board could give
shareholders the option of exchanging the rights for common stock,
at the ratio of one share of common stock for each right, thus
increasing the number of shares a raider would have to acquire.
   USX has said the plan was designed to prevent someone from
gaining control of the company without offering a fair price to all
stockholders.
   In October, Icahn said his group was considering making
proposals for ``business combinations'' with USX.

   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, fresh
from Moscow, says Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev isn't
looking for miracles from Malta, but deserves help from the West
such as observer status at world trade talks.
   President Bush and Mulroney had a private dinner at the White
House Wednesday night in the last of Bush's pre-summit
consultations with leaders of the Western alliance before he leaves
today for Malta and this weekend's shipboard talks with Gorbachev.
   Mulroney, who returned Sunday from his own talks with Gorbachev,
spent nearly three hours at the White House before flying back to
Ottawa. Bush thanked him profusely for coming.
   ``I can't tell you how much I appreciate your advice and your
observations,'' Bush said.
   Then, in what the president acknowledged was ``a little
unorthodox'' fashion, Bush left his guest on the driveway to hold
forth for Canadian and American reporters.
   Mulroney defended Bush against charges that he has been too
timid in responding to the fast-moving tide of democratic and
economic changes sweeping the East Bloc nations.
   ``The administration has a responsibility to act with
prudence,'' he said. ``President Bush is president of the United
States and leader of the Western alliance, and it is important that
he act not in haste, but that he act effectively.
   ``I believe that his intensive preparations and his very
constructive attitude, I believe that this is going to bring about
good results.''
   Mulroney said he recommended that the Soviet Union be granted
observer status at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks
_ the discussions where the world's major industrialized nations
lay the ground rules for international trade _ and that Gorbachev
get a personal briefing after each economic summit of the seven
major nations of the West.
   That briefing, he said, should be conducted by the chairman and
host of the G-7 summit, which happens to be Bush for the 1990
meeting to be held next spring or summer in Texas.
   ``What did President Bush think of it? I think he kind of liked
it,'' said Mulroney.
   ``My belief is that President Gorbachev looks upon the Malta
summit not with a view to any achieving any miracles, but with a
view to building a sustained and solid relationship with President
Bush that will give rise to major accomplishments down the road,''
Mulroney said.
   Gorbachev, Mulroney said, is ``in for the long haul himself. I
think he's got an ambitious, progressive agenda for the future.
   ``Some of his suggestions are worthy of thoughtful and generous
response, and on the basis of that, there are some gestures that
can be taken,'' he said.
   There also ``might be a series of steps to bring (the Soviets)
more closely into the INF and World Bank ambit,'' the Canadian
leader suggested.
   The meeting was the fourth one-on-one session this year between
the two North American leaders.
   Also attending the private dinner were: Secretary of State James
A. Baker III; White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu; Brent
Scowcroft, the national security adviser; Robert M. Gates, deputy
national security adviser; and Edward N. Ney, the U.S. ambassador
to Canada.
   Mulroney was accompanied by Canadian Secretary of State for
External Affairs Joseph Clark; Stanley H. Hartt, the prime
minister's chief of staff; and Derek Burney, the Canadian
ambassador to Washington.
   Bush conferred with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at
Camp David, Md., last Friday, and has spoken with other NATO and
Western alliance leaders by telephone in advance of the
Mediterranean summit. He has promised not to spring any surprises
on the allies.
   Asked if Bush had assured him of no surprises such as former
President Reagan's discussing abandoning nuclear arms with
Gorbachev at Reykavik, Iceland, in 1987, Mulroney said, ``Oh, you
can be certain of that.''

<HEAD>Thornburgh Ordered Prison Officials to Withdraw Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh ordered
federal prison officials to withdraw a day-old plan to restrict
press interviews of inmates just hours after reporters sharply
questioned him about it.
   The attorney general faced angry questions Wednesday about his
plans for new Justice Department guidelines being drafted to stem
the flow of unauthorized information.
   During the tense session, Thornburgh defended the Bureau of
Prison's proposal to limit each inmate to one press interview a
month as part of ``what is necessary to properly manage prison
facilities.''
   But late in the day, Thornburgh abruptly and unexpectedly issued
a brief statement saying he had ordered the Bureau of Prisons to
withdraw the proposed regulations, which had been put out for
public comment.
   The plan would have limited the number of press interviews at
each prison facility to one a day.
   Thornburgh had also faced hostile questioning about a provision
of the plan that would have empowered wardens to bar future
interviews by reporters who failed to seek comment from officials
about allegations made by inmates of mistreatment or other
conditions.
   Ed Koren, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union
prison project called the provision a form of censorship designed
``to cut off any kind of criticism and to protect the Bureau of
Prisons from any embarrassments.''
   Thornburgh told reporters the regulations were designed to
ensure an ``accurate flow of information.''
   ``I think there is a problem that they are trying to address of
reconciling their management responsibility with the flow of
information in and out of prisons.''
   But the attorney general said he had not personally reviewed the
proposed regulations before they were published in Tuesday's
Federal Register.
   In his statement released late in the day, Thornburgh said
``this proposal was submitted prematurely and without my personal
review. It will be subject to further review before resubmission.''
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said Thornburgh was
told of the proposed regulations Tuesday night. He decided
Wednesday afternoon to order them rescinded. He met Wednesday
morning with reporters.
   James Jones, chief spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons said
there were only a few changes from current policy in the proposed
regulations. He said the bureau has long required reporters to seek
its response to allegations about prison conditions made by inmates.
   Thornburgh said leaks of information about criminal
investigations prompted him to order a full review this fall of
press guidelines in the department and all its component agencies.
   ``I expect it to result in two things: one, that we will have
some success in reducing the number of leaks of pending criminal
investigations and, secondly... that we speak with one voice on
policy matters.
   ``It was `let's leak like a sieve' when I got here,'' Thornburgh
said.
   The attorney general repeated his warning that he would
prosecute department officials who leak details of an ongoing
criminal investigation.
   ``Those persons are criminals themselves because they violate
the privacy statutes and the theft of government property statutes
that the Congress has enacted.''
   Thornburgh has ordered investigations of numerous leaks,
including a probe to identify the source who disclosed an
investigation of alleged financial irregularities in the office of
Rep. William Gray III, D-Pa.
   The leak unleashed a storm of accusations from House Democrats
that the disclosure was politically orchestrated by Thornburgh's
aides while Gray was seeking election as House majority whip.
   The department eventually issued a statement saying Gray was
cooperating with the investigation and wasn't a target.
   Asked Wednesday if he were satisfied the Gray leak had not come
from his staff, Thornburgh said: ``I haven't had an opportunity to
review the results of the investigation.''
   The review of department press guidelines that Thornburgh said
he ordered earlier this fall has already resulted in new press
guidelines at the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   Gene McNary, the new INS commissioner, ordered all field offices
to get clearance from Washington before responding to a wide
variety of press questions.
   In September, Runkel had rebuked Drug Enforcement Agency
officials for confirming reports that DEA agents had arranged the
sale of crack in a park near the White House at the request of
President Bush's speechwriters.
   The president, displaying a plastic envelope containing the
crack, told of the undercover sale in his televised speech to
unveil his anti-drug strategy.

   The Postal Service, already testing a
self-adhesive stamp, is about to try marketing a plastic stamp and
a hologram.
   The self-adhesive 25-cent stamps, showing an eagle and selling
for slightly more than face value, are being tested in 15 cities.
Early sales have been reported good.
   The plastic stamp, also self-adhesive, was unveiled this week at
World Stamp Expo here and will be test-marketed in Seattle. It was
designed to be sold in bank automatic cash machines, and is made of
plastic to make it easier for the machines to dispense.
   A 25-cent stamp, the plastic model features a stylized American
flag, with a dozen stamps sold together on a backing sheet the size
of a dollar bill. Testing will begin early next year.
   The hologram, a specialized design in which the image changes
color when viewed from different angles, goes on sale Sunday.
   It is on a stamped envelopes and features a picture of the
planned space station. The stamped envelope will cost 30 cents,
including the 25 cents postage.

<NOTE>Machinists Leaders Vow Continued Strike</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Machinist union leaders are vowing to continue
their strike against Eastern Airlines.
   Machinists President George Kourpias said Wednesday that the
union would try to pressure Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent
company, and the bankruptcy court overseeing the cash-strapped
carrier into a settlement.
   The union also plans to push Eastern to make overdue payments to
its pension plan, which is owed as much as $1 billion, and take
legal action against Eastern and Texas Air if the payments are not
made.
   Eastern is strapped for cash and court actions involving the
underfunded pension plan could affect Eastern's attempt to emerge
soon from bankruptcy.
   Kourpias said the union would lobby Congress to win enough
support to override President Bush's veto of legislation creating a
congressional panel to recommend a solution.
   Eastern pilots and flight attendants cited the veto last week in
deciding to end sympathy strikes in support of the machinists, who
walked off the job March 4 after refusing to grant more than $150
million in work-rule and other concessions.
   The union represents more than 3,000 Eastern employees who
worked as mechanics and baggage handlers.

<NOTE>Bentsen Says Panel Will Ponder Savings, Investment Incentives</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen says his Senate Finance
Committee will consider a wide array of proposals next year to
encourage saving and investment, including a cut in capital gains
taxes.
   Expanded Individual Retirement Accounts also will be considered
as Congress looks for ways to increase productivity and the
nation's ability to compete with foreign producers, the Texas
Democrat said Wednesday in remarks prepared for a meeting of the
Tax Foundation in New York.
   With Bentsen and Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell,
D-Maine, leading the way, Congress this year defeated President
Bush's call for a reduction in taxes on capital gains, profits from
the sale of investments.
   Democratic leaders viewed the proposed reduction as a windfall
for the rich, the beginning of the undoing of the landmark 1986 tax
overhaul and a deficit-increaser that would do little for the
economy.
   They responded with a plan to liberalize tax-deductible IRAs,
but withdrew that proposal when the capital gains cut failed.

<TEXT>
   An large outdoor painting of Jesse Jackson as
a white man _ entitled ``How Do You Like Me Now?'' _ drew an
immediate response Wednesday from a half dozen passers by.
   They didn't like it at all.
   So they knocked it down with a sledge hammer.
   ``They really were offended very deeply,'' Philip Brookman,
director of programming for the Washington Project for the Arts,
told The Washington Post.
   ``I understand the way people can really misread it _ I think
that's part of why it's such an interesting work.''
   On Wednesday evening, most of the 14-foot-square work, painted
on tin, was in pieces, while just the figure's blond hair, forehead
and part of the eyes and ears still hung near a subway stop.
   The painting was the work of David Hammons, whom Brookman
described as ``an extremely important and well-known artist in the
black community.''

<HEAD>Membership in All-Male Club Shouldn't Disqualify Dunne: Thornburgh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh says the man
whom President Bush is expected to name civil rights chief
shouldn't be disqualified simply because he's a member of an
all-male golf club.
   Thornburgh refused to discuss former New York state Sen. John R.
Dunne's expected nomination to be assistant attorney general for
civil rights, saying ``that is a matter for the White House.''
   But the attorney general dismissed suggestions Wednesday that
Dunne's membership in an all-male golf club would pose a problem.
   ``Mr. Dunne has indicated that if he is nominated by the
president he will resign. So I think he feels it's inappropriate
for the head of the civil rights division to belong to such a
club.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday that Dunne
was the top candidate for the job.
   Sources at the White House, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said they expected Bush to nominate Dunne, a personal friend of the
attorney general for 17 years.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee refused to approve Bush's first
nominee, William C. Lucas, after critics said he lacked
professional experience for the job.
   Thornburgh said membership in all-male clubs doesn't disqualify
candidates because ``we don't believe in litmus tests.''
   ``My objection is to a litmus test which says hat somebody
because of any characteristic or any part of their background ought
to be excluded,'' the attorney general told reporters.
   ``They ought to look at the whole record.''

<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 8th graf: ``In Rome,'' with report of Gorbachev's aims
at summit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's weekend summit with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev should leave the superpowers
``better prepared to make substantial progress'' on a treaty to
slash long-range nuclear weapons, Secretary of State James A. Baker
III said Wednesday.
   However, he emphasized anew that no such agreement would be
reached during the two-day meeting.
   In a pre-summit news conference at the White House, Baker also
said the democratic reforms that are bringing down Eastern Europe's
hard-line communist regimes are ``the only path to long-term
legitimacy and stability in the region,'' and he warned against any
crackdown by authorities.
   While saying Moscow has not stood in the way of the stunning
changes, Baker declared, ``We firmly believe that any attempts to
forcibly intervene and prevent continued reform will be extremely
destabilizing and dangerous.''
   He made a clear distinction between ``forcibly suppressing
peaceful dissent'' and intervention by authorities to restore
order, such as in possible ethnic violence in the Soviet Union.
   ``I see those as two distinctly different things,'' Baker said.
   The secretary spoke on the eve of the president's departure for
the Mediterranean island of Malta. Bush and Gorbachev will hold
talks Saturday and Sunday on U.S. and Soviet warships anchored in
Malta's Marsaxlokk Bay.
   In Rome, unidentified Soviet officials quoted in Thursday
editions of The Washington Post told reporters Gorbachev also would
focus on arms questions, with the aim of winning a commitment from
Bush for rapid progress on nuclear and conventional arms
agreements, including the establishment of a 1990 deadline for a
treaty on strategic missiles clear statement
   Bush spent Wednesday preparing for his first meeting as
president with Gorbachev, discussing the talks in a telephone
conversation with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the two
leaders also talked about Kohl's new proposal Tuesday for a
confederation with East Germany as a step toward eventual
reunification.
   On that point, Baker said, ``If there's unification, it should
occur in the context of Germany's continued alignment with NATO and
an increasingly integrated European Community.''
   He ruled out any ``trade'' with Moscow in which the two Germanys
would be reunited as a neutral government.
   Mindful of some reservations among U.S. allies in Europe, Baker
said he preferred a gradual, step-by-step process of bringing the
two Germanys together.
   Bush also planned to discuss the summit at a dinner with
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
   At his news conference, Baker said Bush would complain to
Gorbachev about what U.S. officials say is a continuing flow of
Soviet-made weapons to the Moscow-backed government of Afghanistan,
as well as to leftist rebels in El Salvador through Nicaragua.
   ``This pattern is a Cold War relic,'' Baker said.
   Noting that Soviet officials have promised to prevent Nicaragua
from shipping Soviet arms to El Salvador, Baker said, ``Either the
Nicaraguans are lying to the Soviet Union or the Soviet Union is
lying to us.
   ``We prefer to believe it's the former.''
   Baker said the Malta meeting would not be an arms-control
summit, emphasizing that no agreement would be reached either on
long-range nuclear weapons or reductions in troops and conventional
arms in Europe.
   However, he said, ``this meeting should permit us to be in much
better shape and much better prepared to make substantial progress,
particularly on arms control'' at the full-blown summit scheduled
next year in the United States.
   U.S. and Soviet leaders have expressed hopes of signing an
agreement at that later meeting to cut strategic weapons, the
deadliest arms in the superpowers' arsenals, by as much as 50
percent.
   This weekend, Baker said, ``they will exchange new ideas but
they're not going to negotiate and they're certainly not going to
negotiate on anything that would involve our allies.''
   The secretary also said the two leaders would discuss steps the
United States might take to improve economic relations with the
Soviet Union, such as waiving trade restrictions linked with Soviet
emigration and possible Soviet participation in an international
trading organization, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT).
   On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell prodded
Bush to waive the trade barriers, known as the Jackson-Vanik
amendment.
   ``While I welcome the administration's offer to provide
technical advice to the Soviet Union, I believe a more meaningful
response is necessary,'' Mitchell told a news conference.
   At the White House, Baker hailed warmer ties between Washington
and Moscow and said, ``We want reforms in Soviet domestic, foreign
and defense policy to succeed, and ... we believe that the
reformers are for real.''
   In an acknowledgement that the changes in Eastern Europe will be
accompanied by hardships for its citizens, Baker said, ``We are
quite realistic about the staggering tasks which face the
reformers.''
   However, he said, the important question for the United States
is not whether Gorbachev's reforms succeed or fail.
   ``The real question is this: Do you engage the Soviet Union in a
search for mutual advantage in this time of uncertainty? And our
answer to that question is a resounding `yes.'''

   In his spacious apartment, Werner Rhode
reflected on the price of fleeing West: more than two years'
separation from his wife and two sons, starting over in his 40s,
and an enduring sense of isolation.
   ``But I'd do exactly the same again. I don't regret not
waiting,'' said Rhode. ``We won three years.''
   The pediatrician left East Germany illegally in 1986, never
expecting the Communist government would permit freedom of travel
in his lifetime.
   ``Now I feel a tremendous pride that I did what I did. It was
like moving a mountain with a shovel,'' Rhode said.
   Rhode was among the East Germans who managed to escape before
last summer, when neighboring Hungrary opened its borders and
released a flood of East Germans to the West.
   On Nov. 9, East Germany's Communist leaders gave up, scrapped
travel restrictions and opened the Berlin Wall.
   Among the new Westerners, many are young and hopeful, but some
are disillusioned. Others, like Rhode, 44, simply are determined to
adapt, buoyed daily by the memory of their desperation to leave
East Germany.
   ``I don't think that anybody who has never lived there could
ever understand,'' Rhode said. ``I did not want my children to wind
up in their 40s in the situation we were in. It was like being a
marionette, constantly manipulated.''
   Despite the changes, including an amnesty for illegal emigrants
declared in October, Rhode has no intention of going back and has
not visited. He believes his children, now 14 and 16, have better
opportunities in the West.
   For two 23-year-old East Berlin secretaries who ducked out of a
vacationing group in Hungary and reached West Berlin via Austria in
October, life in the West consists of sharing a room in a refugee
center with three other women.
   They have never used computers and have little prospect of
finding work or housing. In January, they are due to start a
retraining course.
   ``It's disappointing,'' said one, Kirsten Senger, who left with
her best friend, Katrin Mueller. ``But if you want to succeed here,
it's possible to fight your way through. On the other side,
whatever you did, somebody always closed a door.''
   ``If we'd known what was going to happen, I suppose we'd have
waited,'' Miss Mueller. ``But we'd have been the first through the
wall on Nov. 9.''
   Miss Mueller went home to visit East Berlin soon after the wall
opened, and Miss Senger also plans a visit soon.
   ``It was good to see my mother, because leaving her without
telling her I was going was the saddest thing I've ever known,''
said Miss Mueller.
   Even with the hardships of adapting to their new lives, neither
wants to give up.
   ``There was no hope'' in the East, and authorities made promises
they did not keep, said Miss Mueller.
   After repeated applications, Rhode, who worked at a hospital in
Frankfurt an der Oder along the border with Poland, got a five-day
exit visa in 1986 to visit relatives in West Berlin, 50 miles away.
   His wife, Sabine, a neurologist, and their sons were not allowed
to accompany him.
   The couple agreed that Rhode would not return. Knowing their
telephone would be tapped and mail opened, Mrs. Rhode feigned
amazement when her husband pretended to break the news in a
telephone call.
   Secret police raided her apartment. She was fined 20,000 East
German marks _ more than 10 times Rhode's annual salary. Officials
decided on the sum as representing half the state-assessed value of
their property.
   Repeatedly, Mrs. Rhode was refused permission to leave.
   ``They were granting some applications, but highly skilled
people had no chance,'' said Rhode. ``There were times when I
thought it was hopeless. I promised her if things got too bad, I'd
go back even if it meant a year in jail.''
   Suddenly, on Dec. 28, 1988, Mrs. Rhode was told she could go
that day. ``I just picked up the children, two suitcases and
went,'' she said.
   In East Germany, the Rhodes had a relatively good living
standard _ an apartment at a nominal rent, a car and more money
than there were goods to buy.
   Their skills were in desperately short supply, while West
Germany has a surplus of doctors. Some 1,200 doctors are out of
work in West Berlin alone, with numbers being swelled by emigres
from the east.
   Rhode, a senior consultant in East Germany, got a job as an
assistant consultant at West Berlin's Neukoelln Hospital. It pays
5,500 West German marks, nearly $3,000 a month after taxes.
   He lived in a small apartment in the nurses' quarters, saving
for the arrival of his family. They now live in their own
apartment, which rents for $973 a month.
   Mrs. Rhode considers herself lucky to have found a job _ she
works assessing accident victims' disabilities for an insurance
group _ and both speak with distaste of what they see as a
mercenary attitude of many of their West German colleagues.
   Mrs. Rhode said some had suggested she should feel guilty about
leaving patients behind in East Germany.
   ``They have no place to talk to me about feeling guilty,'' she
said. ``Here we see them cheating patients by giving them
unnecessary treatment.''
   Her husband cited instances when, he said, doctors ``see a
patient four or five times when one or two appointments would do.'

<HEAD>Interferon First Treatment for Hepatitis C</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Injections of the natural disease-fighting protein
interferon give doctors their first effective weapon against
hepatitis C, a virus that infects at least 150,000 Americans
annually, according to a report today.
   ``In my opinion, this is a major clinical advance,'' said Dr.
Gary L. Davis of the University of Florida.
   The work appears to represent another milestone in a year of
advances against this elusive virus. Until recently, doctors were
sure of only two hepatitis viruses, type A and type B. Since many
people got hepatitis without exposure to these viruses, their
disease was simply labeled non-A, non-B.
   In April, researchers from Chiron Corp. in Emeryville, Calif.,
reported the discovery of a new hepatitis virus, which they called
hepatitis C. They said it is the principal culprit in non-A, non-B
hepatitis. They also described a new test that will reveal whether
blood is tainted with the virus.
   Hepatitis C is the most common serious infection that is passed
through blood. Perhaps 5 percent of all Americans who get routine
transfusions become infected, although estimates vary widely.
However, this hazard should largely disappear soon when the new
screening test for the virus becomes available, perhaps next year.
   Most cases of hepatitis C are mild. About half those infected
become long-term carriers, and 10 percent suffer cirrhosis of the
liver.
   The latest research, involving 207 people, shows that therapy
with alpha interferon, a human protein produced through genetic
engineering, can temporarily shut down the virus' attack. The
treatment stopped the destruction of liver cells in about half of
those with chronic disease. However, in more than half of those who
are helped, the disease returned when treatment ended.
   Researchers hope that giving interferon for longer period or in
higher doses will hold the virus in check or wipe it out.
   ``This is a very common disease,'' said Davis. ``There has been
nothing available for these people in the past. While this controls
the disease rather than cures it, it is the first therapeutic
intervention that has been offered these people.''
   ``It looks promising that anti-viral treatment will be useful in
this disease,'' added Dr. Jay H. Hoofnagle of the National
Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
   Davis and Hoofnagle were co-authors of separate studies that
reached similar conclusions about interferon's effectiveness. Both
were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   Hepatitis B is spread mainly through blood and sexual contact
and is a major underlying cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Blood banks also test donations for hepatitis A, which usually
spreads through contaminated food and water. While it can cause
serious illness, people do not get lingering infections with
hepatitis A.
   ``Hepatitis C virus is a vastly more common problem than HIV
(the AIDS virus) and considerably more common than hepatitis B, for
which we have been testing for 20 years. It's the most common
serious virus infection'' passed through transfusions, said Dr.
Lewellys F. Barker, head of blood services at the American Red
Cross in Washington.
   In another report in the journal, Chiron scientists teamed with
researchers from the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the
National Institutes of Health to strengthen the case that hepatitis
C is the major, and possibly the only, cause of non-A, non-B
hepatitis.
   They tested 15 people who got non-A, non-B hepatitis through
transfusions and found that all were infected with hepatitis C.
Donors were also infected with this virus.
   Just how many Americans get hepatitis C each year is unclear.
Davis estimates that about 150,000 of the 3 million Americans who
get transfusions annually become infected. However, the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control uses a far lower estimate.
   In an editorial in the journal, the CDC's Dr. Miriam J. Alter
estimated that a total of 150,000 Americans get hepatitis C each
year from all causes. Among these are 7,500 to 15,000 who catch it
through transfusions.
   The CDC estimates that 40 percent get the infection through drug
abuse. Other sources include on-the-job exposure to blood, sexual
intercourse and household contact with infected people. However, in
about 40 percent of cases there is no clear explanation of how the
infection occurs.

   Nicolae Ceausescu's ringing rejection
of reform is leaving him increasingly isolated as Warsaw Pact
allies move toward democracy.
   The supreme leader of Romania renounced the reforms gripping the
six other Warsaw Pact nations at his Communist Party's 14th
congress last week.
   Instead, he proclaimed a strengthened role for the party, which
already runs the most tightly controlled country in the Soviet bloc.
   ``The party cannot give up its responsibility,'' he declared.
``It cannot surender its historical mission to another force.''
   Exppressing contempt for the political liberalization reshaping
Eastern Europe, Ceausescu _ whose 24 years in power make him the
most senior Soviet bloc leader _ suggested that reform-minded
Communist leaders elsewhere had betrayed their people.
   The displays of orchestrated support from congress delegates did
not gloss over the rapidly widening political gap between
Ceausescu's Romania and the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary, East
Germany, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia.
   He has often been at odds with the Kremlin, rejecting the Soviet
lead in the 1970s at a time whent the rest of the Warsaw Pact was
in lock-step with Moscow.
   Now, he is resolute in rejecting reform.
   And in a new challenge, Ceausescu suggested in his congress
speech that the Soviet Union give up control of territory gained
through a pre-World War II pact with Nazi Germany that resulted in
Romania ceding Bessarabia, now Soviet Moldavia, to its powerful
neighbor.
   Distate for Romania was evident in the fact that several
countries, including Italy and Warsaw Pact ally Hungary, boycotted
the congress _ a move which would have been an unheard of affront
just five years ago.
   The growing isolation of Ceausescu's Romania also was reflected
in the near-complete absence of the Western camp from the congress.
   Chiefs of Western diplomatic missions had attended past
Communist Party congresses as a show of courtesy. But the 14th
congress was boycotted by the 12-member European Economic
Community, all 16 NATO nations save Turkey, most Latin American
democracies, and almost all of Europe's neutral counries.
   The issue was Romania's poor human rights record, which was
``ignored back in the 1970s, when Ceausescu was tweaking the
Russian bear's tail,'' said a diplomat, who invoked the customary
rules of anonymity.
   The Romanian leader's independent foreign policy decisions, such
as refusing to join other Warsaw Pact nations in invading
Czechoslovakia in 1968, or defying a Soviet bloc boycott of the
1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics, was met the with applause from
the United States and its allies.
   The cheers have turned to jeers, however.
   ``They're being very consistent, it's the rest of the world
that's changing,'' Canadian Ambassador Sol Gray said of Romania in
the brightening rights picture in the rest of the Soviet bloc.
   Romania is under growing attack for a rights record marred by
severe travel restrictions, no freedom of expression and strict
limitation on the practice of religion.
   Fear of opposing Ceausescu even appears to extend into the
highest party echelons, with senior officials seemingly restricted
to carrying out the leader's decrees.
   Explaining the American decision to stay away from the congress,
the U.S. Embassy said it would be ``inconsistent with the depth of
United States concern over the human rights situation in Romania,
for which the Romanian Communist Party bears responsibility.''
   Romanian officials deny that Ceausescu's refusal to embrace
change is leading to international isolation and point to what they
say are vibrant ties with the developing world.
   Ceausescu seems to turn to increasingly to developing countries,
particularly those with a Communist system similarly opposed to
reform.
   Reporting on a meeting between Ceausescu and Chinese chief
delegate Qiao Shi, the Romanian Communist Party daily Scinteia said
both sides expressed pleasure over the ``upward movement '' and
``constant gowth'' of ties.
   Similar language was used to describe Ceausescu's meetings with
the head of the North Korean and Cuban delegations.

   A river of raw sewage swept away a city worker
when a barrier used to plug a sewer pipe burst, and officials said
the man's body was found more than half a mile away.
   The body of the Public Works Department employee was found in a
giant filtering device in a pumping station. Police withheld the
name of the victim pending notification of his family.
   The incident occurred about 3 p.m. beneath the basement of the
Kennedy Center, where city employees were repairing a 10-foot city
sewer line, said Fire Department Battalion Chief Joseph L. O'Neill.
   The worker was standing on a scaffold inside the line when the
accident occurred, he said.
   To stop the flow of sewage while workers fix such pipes, large
balloons are inflated upstream from the work site, O'Neill said.
The balloon that workers were using burst, releasing a river of raw
sewage that had been backed up for as long as four hours, he said.
   The cause of the accident was not known.

   The rice was bugged, and we're not talking
wiretaps.
   The sesame seeds had a problem, too. So did the apricots, the
bean curd and the macaroni. In all, City Council President Andrew
Stein said Wednesday, 15 of 17 imported foods his staff bought in
the city and had tested at a private laboratory contained bugs or
bug parts.
   At a City Hall news conference, Stein accused the federal Food
and Drug Administration of failing to enforce its food
contamination standards. He also said the standards themselves are
too low.
   Most of the foods he had tested _ including 2 ounces of Haitian
milled corn with 26 insect fragments in it _ were within allowable
federal standards. But six were so badly tainted they violated the
limits, Stein said.
   Among them, he said, were a 5-pound bag of Indian rice
containing one live bug _ a red flour beetle _ and 11 whole dead
ones, including sawtoothed grain beetles and a rice weevil. There
was a dead moth in the Chinese sesame seeds, a rat or mouse hair in
the Chinese bean curd preserves and 481 insect fragments in the
Greek macaroni.
   ``Had they been properly inspected, they would have been barred
from sale in this country,'' Stein said. He blamed federal budget
cuts under the Reagan administration that reduced the number of FDA
inspectors while food imports tripled.
   The FDA replied that it spends most of its time looking for food
that contains microbiological contamination that could make people
sick. Bugs, while unappetizing, generally do not pose a direct
health threat, said Herman Janiger, an FDA consumer affairs officer
in Brooklyn.
   ``We do screen for filth in food, but it's possible that some
can get by us,'' Janiger said.

   Actor-comedian Chevy Chase, who is reprising his
role as the dedicated family man in ``National Lampoon's Christmas
Vacation,'' says he thinks about going out with the guys as a break
from an all-female household.
   Chase said living with his wife, Jane, and three daughters has
changed his life, but he also feels ``out of control of my life
now.''
   ``I think I need to be taken away, dropped in some territory
with just a lot of loud guys,'' he said in an interview scheduled
for broadcast today and Friday on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``Like just get Danny Aykroyd and Marty (Martin Short) and (Tom)
Hanks and a bunch of us and just put us all together and leave us
alone with a 'fridge full of beer or something.''
   Chase, who has played the goofy family patriarch Clark Griswold
in two previous ``Vacation'' movies, said being a real-life father
means having responsibilities to his children.
   ``So, there are many things that I don't do that I used to do,''
he said. ``For instance, I sleep in a nightgown now.'

   Wrinkles can finally be seen on his boyish face, but for decades
his youthful looks were the butt of jokes. He once compared the

It would be nice to be allowed to age gracefully,'' he said.

   Leftist rebels invaded parts of
the capital's most affluent neighborhoods before dawn Wednesday,
trapping many foreigners, and dug in after fierce combat with
government forces.
   How many people had been killed in the latest guerrilla
offensive was not clear. Eleven bodies of combatants were seen
lying in the streets.
   Guerrillas briefly held a U.S. Embassy officer's home, officials
in Washington said. They were also said to have seized the home of
a French diplomat.
   U.S. Embassy personnel were told not to report to work
Wednesday, and the embassy was closed for the day, White House
spokesman Roman Popadiuk said in Washington.
   Administration officials said no Americans were injured, and the
rebels said in a statement that their fighters had been told not to
attack Americans.
   A Salvadoran Foreign Ministry official said rebels took over the
Japanese Embassy, which is four blocks from the home of U.S.
Ambassador William Walker, but Japan denied the report.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said guerrillas ``briefly
overran'' a an unidentified U.S. Embassy officer's home. The State
Department said the home apparently was seized at random.
   ``The family was safely evacuated by Salvadoran government
forces, and the family was not actually in the hands of the
guerrillas at any time,'' said David Denny, a department spokesman.
   Heavy and sustained fire was reported blocks from Ambassador
Walker's home. Embassy spokesman Jeff Brown said Walker was ``fine
... working in his office at the embassy.''
   Denny said, ``Several families are unable to leave their homes
because of fighting in their locations,'' which included the
neighborhoods of San Benito, Escalon, the capital's wealthiest.
   Late Wednesday, the rebel leadership proposed a six-hour truce
Thursday morning to evacuate foreigners from the neighborhoods.
There was no immediate public response from the government.
   In a broadcast by their clandestine Radio Venceremos, the rebels
also said their fighters had captured the homes of three
``oligarchs'' but freed the occupants to show they are a
``responsible force'' fighting for ``democracy.''
   Embassy spokesman Barry Jacobs said a charter flight might
depart Thursday with embassy dependents who want to leave El
Salvador, and embassy personnel who planned to go home for
Christmas would leave early.
   He said some dependents and other Americans had moved into the
heavily fortified embassy in downtown San Salvador to get away from
the fighting a few miles away.
   The U.S. Embassy said there are about 8,000 to 10,000 U.S.
citizens in El Salvador at any one time.
   A Salvadoran Foreign Ministry source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said guerrillas took over the Japanese Embassy and
allowed relief workers to evacuate embassy personnel inside.
   In Tokyo, a Foreign Ministry official said Japanese staff at the
government's liason office in El Salvador reported street fighting
in the neighborhood.
   ``But there was no such thing as was reported'' in the press,
the official quoted the report as saying. The official said no
injuries were reported among people at the liaison office, which is
in the former Japanese Embassy in San Salvador. Consular and
embassy business for El Salvador currently is handled by the
Japanese Embassy in Costa Rica, he said.
   Another diplomatic source said guerrillas had seized the
residence of a French diplomat, but allowed those inside to be
evacuated. He gave no details.
   A home about a half-mile from Walker's house was burned after
having been taken over by rebels. Whether rebels burned the house
or it caught fire as a result of fighting was not clear.
   The guerrillas attacked working-class districts of San Salvador
earlier this month in their biggest offensive of a 10-year-old
civil war that has killed more than 71,000 people, most of them
civilians.
   On Wednesday, Radio Venceremos said: ``We're already sitting in
the oligarchy's best mansions.''
   A statement from the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front said U.S. personnel and buildings were not targets.
   Americans in the area should ``stay sheltered in their
residences,'' and ``if they come in contact with our forces, they
should identify themselves,'' it said. ``Our units have
instructions not to attack North American personnel.''
   Fighting began well before dawn in San Benito and Escalon, the
capital's wealthiest residential areas. Most people stayed inside
the comfortable homes, which are surrounded by trees and 15-foot
walls, as the chatter of assault rifles sounded in the winding
streets.
   It appeared about a dozen homes were taken over by the scores of
insurgents, who apparently came down from the San Salvador volcano
northwest of the city.
   ``By taking this part, we bring the war to the rich,'' said the
leader of a rebel squad behind a barricade of cars with their tires
shot out, arranged to block a tree-lined street. He said the
guerrillas were beginning the second phase of the offensive
launched Nov. 11.
   In Washington, CIA Director William Webster said the rebels were
continuing to ``make a symbolic and important statement about their
ability to keep causing trouble'' through urban attacks, but posed
no threat to the government.
   Soldiers and rbels fought for hours around the official and
private residences of President Alfredo Cristiani, both in Escalon.
   Reporters saw a light tank destroyed in Escalon by
rocket-propelled grenades. The bodies of six soldiers lay around
the charred vehicle.
   The bodies of at least five guerrillas were seen in Escalon and
in the La Sultana and Guadalupe neighborhoods of southwestern San
Salvador, which also were attacked.
   Helicopters and spotter planes strafed and rocketed suspected
rebel positions in Sultana and Guadalupe, but not in Escalon or San
Benito.
   Last week, insurgents briefly took over the blocks surrounding a
luxury hotel in Escalon. They said Escalon was chosen as an
objective because the government would not use warplanes in rich
neighborhoods, as it had in the working-class districts of
Mejicanos and Soyapango.
   Residents of the poor districts in northern and eastern San
Salvador reported many civilians killed or wounded by air attacks.
   The insurgent radio also reported a mortar attack Wednesday on
the headquarters of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in western San
Salvador. The armed forces press committee denied that the
compound, which also houses the Defense Ministry, came under fire.

   Ousted Communist Party chief Milos
Jakes says he planned to bring democratic reforms to his country in
December, and was simply overtaken by popular unrest that spread
with breathtaking speed.
   The former hard-line leader said the massive daily
demonstrations, and ultimately his downfall, were spurred by an
erroneous report that police had killed a student demonstrator.
   Jakes, 67, said he opposed the police brutality that sparked the
mass revolt against his rule. Riot police on Nov. 17 clubbed
hundreds of peaceful demonstrators in downtown Prague.
   ``There's always some impulse or other'' to popular revolt,
Jakes said. ``Here the impulse was the events of Nov. 17. It was a
tragedy.''
   ``We didn't want such an intervention'' by the police, he said,
claiming he opposed it along with the Interior Minister, Frantisek
Kincl. He refused to say who was responsible.
   ``Then, the news about the so-called death of a participant
electrified the students and set them in motion. This news proved
to be a lie, but the landslide was already moving,'' Jakes said
matter-of-factly.
   On Nov. 18, rumors swept Prague that a mathematics student
identified as Martin Smid had died when police beat peaceful
students on a city street.
   Dissident Petr Uhl was arrested a day later for putting out the
report, based on the statement of a woman who visited fellow
dissident Vaclav Benda and claimed her fiance, Martin Smid, had
died in the violence.
   The government frantically tried to shoot down the rumors, even
showing two men named Martin Smid on television.
   Uhl publicly apologized for the false report at a mass rally on
Sunday, hours after Communist authorities released him from jail
under pressure from the opposition.
   By then, the anti-government rallies were attracting hundreds of
thousands of people and events had spun out of the government's
control.
   Change had been coming anyway, said Jakes, who spoke with three
Western reporters Wednesday during a break in Parliament, which
amended the constitution to eliminate the Communists' 40-year
monopoly on power.
   ``We were going to create space for democracy. But events moved
quicker than we planned, so now we have to take these measures
under more complicated conditions.''
   Jakes, smiling and composed, defended his record as party boss
with the air of a man unable to drink in the momentous changes of
the past 11 days.
   The Communist Party, he said, had planned to introduce
democratic reforms of its own at a December meeting of its
policy-making Central Committee. But then the mass rallies forced
immediate leadership changes and concessions.
   His claim echoes similar recent claims by many East German
Communists that they had always favored change, but were blocked at
the top.
   In both countries, citizens who remember four decades of broken
Communist promises are skeptical of such statements.
   Jakes, a Communist steeped in party work for more than four
decades, seemed unable to believe that the party could lose power
if it goes ahead with the free elections a Politburo member said
Wednesday were likely within a year.
   The mass demonstrations of recent days ``have concerned only a
small part of the country,'' he said, contradicting a report in
Tuesday's Communist Party daily Rude Pravo that said ``every
layer'' of society was involved in Monday's general strike called
by the opposition.
   Jakes said he favored removing the Communists' leading role from
the constitution, a key opposition demand.
   Enshrining the leading role in the constitution ``damaged our
interests,'' Jakes said. ``Life has shown that it was not important
whether the leading role was written down somewhere or not. What is
important is how we win trust in life.''
   Jakes' admission was surprising in the light of his close links
to the crackdown on reform after the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion that
snuffed out Alexander Dubcek's glorious ``Prague Spring.''
   For 21 years, Jakes, President Gustav Husak and other party
leaders resisted the reform they were installed by Moscow to
suppress but which took hold of the Soviet Union after Mikhail S.
Gorbachev came to power in 1985.
   Jakes denied any responsibility for creating the current crisis
in Czechoslovakia, and also said Soviet officials played no role in
the stunning events of the past week.
   While sanguine about what he called the damaged prestige of the
party, Jakes signaled the Communists are not going to cave in to
all the opposition demands.
   The Civic Forum opposition movement has demanded Husak's
resignation by Dec. 10. But Jakes said Civic Forum, as an unelected
body, cannot usurp this right from Parliament, which under the
constitution appoints the president.
   He also opposed Civic Forum demands to disband the party's
paramilitary force.
   Jakes, dumped from the ruling Politburo on Friday after the mass
demonstrations gathered steam, was asked how he felt about the
chants heard against him heard at the pro-democracy rallies.
   He sighed and said: ``I have always worked honestly my whole
life, and I worked not for myself, but for society. You can't feel
happy _ but this is what happens in politics.''

   The Playboy of the Western world
arrived in the the East bloc today, unveiling American women to a
nation more concerned with shedding Communism.
   A Hungarian version of the men's magazine hit the stands today.
Playboy debuted the edition Wednesday at a news conference that was
the best attended since President Bush visited Hungary in July.
   The star attraction was December's Playmate of the Month,
American Pia Reyes, who told reporters she hoped she is
``recognized with clothes on.''
   Hungary apparently was chosen for the first East Bloc edition
because of its liberal cultural and political climate. This year,
the Communist Party disbanded and reform-minded leaders have
promised free elections by June.
   In the maiden Hungarian edition, Playboy founder Hugh Hefner
wrote, ``The Hungarian people can now enjoy the same democratic
freedom which Playboy has always championed.''
   Playboy, however, isn't likely to shock Hungarians the way it
did Americans in the 1950s. The past year has seen a rash of
soft-core pornography appearing at Budapest kiosks.
   There are no pornography statutes on the books in Hungary, but
customs officials did routinely confiscate such magazines until
1983.
   The Hungarian edition of Playboy will have an initial printing
of 95,000 copies and will sell for 197 forints, or about $3, a
steep price in a country where the average monthly salary is about
6,000 forints, or $100.
   The Hungarian Playboy, a joint venture between Playboy
Enterprises Inc. of Chicago and Hungarian entrepreneurs, will carry
locally generated material as well as photo spreads and features
from the American editions.
   Hungarian editor Dezsoe Futasz said there were no plans yet to
feature a Hungarian Playmate of the Month because of the higher
standards of photography available from the U.S. edition.
   The Hungarian Playboy marks the 13th national edition and the
11th language in which the magazine is published, said Playboy
spokesman William Stocken.
   During the news conference, a reporter from the Soviet news
agency Tass asked about a possible Soviet edition, to which Stocken
replied that ``we are open to a business venture with the
U.S.S.R..''
   Miss December had a chance to clear up an error in the text
accompanying her Hungarian debut: She likes leather and lingerie,
not _ as the Hungarian text has it _ leather lingerie.

   Ah, the fast-paced modern age.
   Traffic in central London in the 1980s moves only 3 mph faster
than in 1912 when most of it was horse-drawn, according to the
Department of Transport.
   The department reported Wednesday that average speeds in 1986
were 10 mph, almost identical to those in 1936. Average speeds were
7 mph in 1912.
   The highest average speeds were recorded just after World War
II, when traffic moved at around 11.5 mph in 1947.
   Traffic congestion has had one positive effect, the report said.
   London's traffic tripled since 1912, whereas nationally it
multiplied eight times.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews Nov. 17-25 with 1,117 adults in the
continental United States.
   Phone numbers were selected randomly and interviews were
conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday, a random
phenomenon.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that 19 of
20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the result if
every adult American were asked the same questions. The error
margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. Overall, do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of
George Bush? Favorable: 70 percent. Unfavorable: 17 percent. Don't
know or no answer: 14 percent.
   2. Overall, do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev? Favorable: 68 percent.
Unfavorable: 16 percent. Don't know or no answer: 16 percent.

handling relations with the Soviet Union? Approve: 74. Disapprove:
14. DK-NA: 13.
   4. Are your feelings toward the Soviet Union generally
favorable, generally unfavorable or neutral? Favorable: 24.
Unfavorable: 18. Neutral: 54. DK-NA: 4.
   5. Who do you think is doing more to reduce East-West tensions
right now _ George Bush or Mikhail Gorbachev? Bush: 29. Gorbachev:
41. DK-NA: 30.
   6a. Do you believe Mikhail Gorbachev wants to bring about
meaningful reform in the Soviet Union, or not? Yes: 77. No: 12.
DK-NA: 12.
   b. (if yes) Do you think he will succeed, or not? Yes: 60. No:
15. DK-NA: 25.
   7. Do you think George Bush is doing enough to encourage reform
in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, or is he being too
cautious? Enough: 46. Cautious: 40. DK-NA: 14.
   8. To encourage reform, do you think the United States should
have free trade with the Soviet Union, on the same terms the U.S.
gives its main trading partners? Yes: 57. No: 28. DK-NA: 15.
   9. To encourage reform, do you think the United States should
provide foreign aid to the Soviet Union? Yes: 21. No: 71. DK-NA: 8.

   Americans give Mikhail Gorbachev more credit
than President Bush for lessening East-West tensions, and nearly
eight in 10 believe the Soviet leader seeks true reform in his
country, according to a poll.
   The Media General-Associated Press survey found suspicions of
the Soviet Union's intentions fading rapidly, with a majority of
Americans now convinced that the Soviets do not seek world
domination.
   Bush and Gorbachev, who are meeting in a shipboard summit off
Malta this weekend, won exceedingly high popularity marks, with
roughly seven in 10 respondents rating each favorably.
   Their summit comes at a time of momentous change in the
communist world. While Gorbachev pushes reforms in the Soviet
Union, his Eastern European allies in recent weeks have moved
dramatically away from political domination by their Communist
parties.
   Forty percent of the 1,117 adults surveyed Nov. 17-25 in the
continental United States rated Bush as ``too cautious'' in
encouraging reform in the Eastern Bloc; 46 percent said he was
doing enough. The rest were unsure.
   Moreover, 41 percent said Gorbachev has done more than Bush to
ease tensions, compared with 29 percent who said Bush has done
more. The others weren't sure.
   To encourage Soviet reforms, respondents by 2-1 favored
establishing normal trade relations _ a step the Bush
administration is exploring. A less likely move, foreign aid, was
opposed by seven in 10.
   Goodwill toward Gorbachev aside, the poll found lingering doubt
about Soviet reliability. Fifty-three percent said the Soviets
cannot be trusted to live up to it arms control agreements, down
from 61 percent in a poll last year but still a majority.
   Reflecting that cautious view, 52 percent opposed making
significant cuts in U.S. military spending because of lessened
tensions. The Bush administration is contemplating large cuts in
its military budget.
   Similarly, respondents split on whether the United States should
remove all its troops from Western Europe if the Soviets removed
theirs from Eastern Europe. Forty-seven percent favored such a deal
and 42 percent were opposed, a division within the poll's 3-point
error margin. The rest were unsure.
   Respondents overwhelmingly opposed immediate cuts in U.S. troops
in Europe as a response to the reforms. But among those who were
opposed, a majority favored reductions later if reforms continue.
   While the respondents favored continued defense efforts, just 35
percent said they believed the Soviets seek to dominate the world _
down from 50 percent who held that view in a CBS News-New York
Times poll last spring.
   Fifty-seven percent in the new survey rejected the notion that
the Soviets seek world domination, with the rest unsure.
   Despite the split opinion on Bush's encouragement of communist
changes, 74 percent approved of his overall handling of U.S.-Soviet
relations. Seventy percent had a favorable opinion of Bush in
general.
   Sixty-eight percent had a favorable view of Gorbachev, virtually
the same rating as Bush's and well up from 54 percent in a Media
General-AP poll in April 1988, before a summit between Gorbachev
and then-President Reagan.
   Gorbachev was more popular than Bush _ 85 percent to 65 percent
_ among respondents with postgraduate educations. Gorbachev also
outscored Reagan among this group in 1988.
   High regard for Gorbachev translated into a generally optimistic
view of his chances for success. Among the 77 percent who believe
he wants meaningful reform in the Soviet Union, 60 percent expected
him to succeed, 15 percent said he is likely to fail and a quarter
were unsure of the outcome.

<HEAD>Dollar Down In Tokyo, Stocks At Another New High</HEAD>

   The dollar declined moderately against the Japanese
yen Thursday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose
to a new high.
   The dollar closed at 142.90 yen, down 0.63 yen from Wednesday's
close of 143.53 yen. After opening at 143.13 yen, the currency
moved in a range of 142.75-143.18 yen in mixed trading.
   On the stock market the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which rose 36.16 points to a record high closing Wednesday,
added another 247.33 points, or 0.67 percent, to close trading at
37,268.79.
   A currency dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said that after its low
opening, the dollar remained stable because of end-of-month demand
for the American currency.
   But another dealer said that end-of-month purchases have already
been completed, and predicted that the dollar would fall during the
day to around 142.75 yen.
   Participants said there was little prospect that any Japanese or
U.S. economic data on the horizon would knock the dollar out of the
general range of 141.50 to 144.50 yen.
   The Nikkei index continued to gain on small-lot buying in a
broad front due to the yen's appreciation against the dollar and
investor expectations for higher prices, securities dealers said.

<TEXT>
   Nobel laureate Mother Teresa, recovering
from a heart attack she suffered in September, has been re-admitted
to a nursing home with high blood pressure, her doctor said today.
   The 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun was taken to the Woodlands
Nursing Home Wednesday night after she complained of giddiness,
said Sister Dorothy, a member of Mother Teresa's Missionaries of
Charity.
   Mother Teresa took ill Wednesday afternoon hours after she met
visitors for the first time since she left the Woodlands Nursing
Home Oct. 14, said the hospital's cardiologist, Dr. Ashim Bardhan.
   Sister Dorothy said a special prayer was said for Mother Teresa
today at the Missionaries of Charity headquarters.
   Mother Teresa won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for the work of her
worldwide charity, which cares for the destitute and dying on six
continents.
   She was hospitalized Sept. 5 with a high fever and acute
vomiting. She suffered a heart attack three days later. Her
condition worsened until a temporary pacemaker stabilized her heart.
   Doctors attributed the illness to her hectic schedule.
   The Yugoslav-born nun founded the charity in October 1959 in an
abandoned hostel donated by the city. The order, which was formally
recognized by the Vatican in 1965, expanded and now has 3,000 nuns
working in 87 countries.

   ``You can shear a lamb every year, but you can only skin it
once.'' _ Billie Sol Estes.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By MIKE COCHRAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the eve of his release from prison
in 1983, Texas flim-flam artist Billie Sol Estes said his wheeling
and dealing days were over.
   The problem wasn't that he was crooked, Estes confided to a
reporter, but compulsive.
   ``I'm just one drink away from being a drunk and just one deal
away from being back in prison,'' sighed the former west Texas
millionaire whose friendship with President Johnson eroded after an
historic fertilizer tank scandal in the 1960s.
   Now, at age 64, the state's most colorfully persistent con man
is back in trouble, indicted with five others and a defunct
corporation on charges of stealing trade secrets.
   He posted $10,000 bail Tuesday in Brady and was released along
with three co-defendants.
   Estes dropped out of sight, and attempts Wednesday to contact
him through friends and family were unsuccessful. In 1987, he moved
to Brady from his longtime home in Abilene.
   McCulloch County District Attorney Ron Sutton said Estes and his
associates face a Dec. 7 arraignment on felony charges of engaging
in criminal activity _ a scheme to form a company with plans that
had been stolen from another firm.
   ``The indictment sets out that he kind of came th the idea,''
Sutton said.
   ``I've always been able to make money,'' Estes bragged in an
interview in the current issue of Texas Monthly magazine. ``If I
put my mind to it, I could make a million in the next 30 days.''
   Estes went on to say:
   ``Me, I've never cared about money. I love puttials together and
watching them run. For some people, money is death. You might as
well give th a loaded .45 pistol and point it right at thei''
   This is the Billie Sol who, after promis 1983 that his fast buck
deals were a thing of past, outlined a grand scheme to corner the
wirket by growing grapes in the west Texas desert`We could, truly,
move the wine business from Fr to West Texas, and I've got some
people who woike for me to go out there and do that,'' he sa Now,
he says, if he had money he would put itJapanese stock market.
   This is the Billie who once told a reporter:
   ``You can shear mb every year, but you can only skin it once.''
   A running Texas joke is that it takes a gooindler to make
millions peddling cow manure, bureat one like Estes to amass a
fortune selling antom cow manure.
   And that's what got Estesble in 1963.
   He was convicted of federal ma fraud and conspiracy in a
multimillion-dollar involving phony financial statements and
non-exnt fertilizer tanks.
   The paper empire was propped up with federal agricultural loans,
a cus arrangement that critics later maintained coulbe traced to
Billie Sol's ties with fellow Texaon Johnson.
   Estes was a Johnson confidant anancial contributor as far back
as Johnson's U.ays.
   The extent of the relationship is debathe late president's
associates insist it was nster bonding that Estes implied.
   Estes wasom prison the first time in 1971 after serving years of
a 15-year term. After being convicted o and conspiracy to conceal
assets from the Intenue Service, his parole was revoked in 1979
ande was sentenced to 10 more years.
   He was red from the federal prison at Big Spring in 1983 While
admittedly a dedicated swindler, the fliEstes is only slightly less
interesting and decdly more noble. He is a tireless worker for
thepoor and has used his own money and fund-raising abilities to
feed and educate the needy _ black, white or Hispanic.
   He was an advocate of school integration in Texas lore it was
fashionable.
   Estes told Texas Mo that when he dies he wants only one thing on
his tombstone: ``He did all that he could to help the poor.''
   In the interview, Estes denied any wrongdoing in the Brady
affair but said: ``I suppose I'll be under investigation about one
thing or another for the rest of my life.''
   And what if he goes back to prison a third time?
   ``If I do, I guess that's part of my diny.''
   Moments later, he added: ``Bring on the indictments. Let's
fight.''
   Tuesday they brought on the indictments.

<HEAD>Singh May Be Persuaded to Be Prime Minister, Colleagues Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAJU GOPALAKRISHNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of a centrist coalition seeking
to form India's first minority government said today they believe
their reluctant leader will yet become prime minister.
   Vishwanath Pratap Singh, head of the five-party National Front
coalition, has maintained he is not interested in replacing Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi. But his colleagues say he has no choice in
the matter.
   ``He has to bow to the wishes of the people and the party,''
said Mohan Guruswamy, an associate of Singh. ``He has no
alternative.''
   Guruswamy said another contender for the post, Chandra Shekhar,
was persuaded Wednesday night to withdraw. Guruswamy claimed no one
in the coalition would contest Singh's nomination.
   Singh, who as late as Tuesday said he would not accept office in
the new government, could not be reached for comment.
   Gandhi resigned Wednesday after his Congress Party failed to win
a majority in last week's parliamentary polls, but he was asked by
President Ramaswamy Venkataraman to continue until a new government
is formed.
   Results of 521 of the 525 seat at stake in the elections had
been announced by today, and the Congress emerged as the single
largest party with 191. Its small-party allies got another 17 seats.
   The National Front has 143 but has been promised support by the
right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, which has 88 seats, and by a
coalition of left-wing groups, which won 51 constituencies.
   That would give the National Front and its tacit allies a total
of 282 seats _ enough to carry a vote if there are no defections.
   The rest of the Parliament seats went to small parties and
independents who have not specified whether they would support a
National Front government.
   ``Singh is not sure he will be able to handle a hung house,''
said a senior leader of the National Front, speaking on condition
of anonymity. ``That's why he was so hesitant to become the prime
minister.''
   ``Singh was told he has no business to be in politics if he does
not seek office,'' said another source in the National Front,
referring to meetings held by the coalition on Wednesday night.
   The National Front's Parliament members are to meet Friday to
elect their leader, who would likely be asked by the president to
become prime minister. If the National Front leader cannot win a
vote of confidence in Parliament _ which takes a simple majority of
263 _ he will have to resign as prime minister.
   Under the Indian Constitution, the president decides who will be
asked to form a government. In past elections, one party always
emerged with a comfortable majority. In the absence of such a
majority, the president is free to choose the party he considers
the most capable of forming a government.
   The Congress Party has said it will not stake a claim to form
the government. Gandhi said he will lead the new opposition.
   Singh, a former defense and finance minister, is the best-known
leader in the National Front. But the 58-year-old politician has
said he just wants to be president of the Janata Dal, or People's
Party, the largest component of the coalition.

<UNK>Greenpeace Stops Soviet Trawler Fishing In Antarctica</UNK>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greenpeace activists in
inflatable boats battled raging seas and freezing temperatures in
Antarctica today to stop a Soviet factory trawler from fishing, the
environmental group said.
   It said three inflatables were launched from the Greenpeace ship
Gondwana stationed off South Georgia in the South Atlantic, where
the group claims the Soviets are overfishing.
   The group, in a statement, said the seven activists steered the
inflatables on board the Soviet factory trawler Mikjail Verbitzkiy
after a wild ride.
   It said the Soviet ship was attempting to put out nets when
Gondwana approached and lowered the inflatable boats. The
inflatables reportedly stayed with the ship for three hours despite
10-foot swells.
   The statement said Greenpeace radioed the Soviet captain, in
both English and Russian, explaining the reasons for the
non-violent protest.
   At one point, the inflatables actually landed on the stern ramp,
blocking the trawling operation.
   ``For the last 20 years the Antarctic ecosystem has been
plundered by indiscriminate fishing, especially by the Soviet Union
in the South Georgia area, and now these stocks are commercially
extinct,'' said Greenpeace Antarctic Program Coodinator Maj de
Poorter.
   She said the whole ecological balance was at risk, as the fish
are food for penguins, seabords, seals and whales.
   Greenpeace, as part of its campaign to have Antarctica declared
a world park, is demanding a moratorium on all fishing south of the
Antarctic convergence until stocks have recovered.
   ``The great whales that once populated this area are gone, now
the fish are going,'' De Poorter said. ``Greenpeace will not simply
stand by and watch.''

<TEXT>
   Three weeks before the finale of the Rolling
Stones' ``Steel Wheels'' concert tour, Mick Jagger and Keith
Richards are proud of the band's new-found discipline, and its
trainload of money.
   ``I've never seen the boys so serious,'' Richards said
Wednesday. ``Everyone is really conserving their energy for the
shows instead of like 10 to 15 years ago when we would have, like,
been up three or four days in a row. Things change.''
   Since opening the 60-show North American tour Aug. 31 in
Philadelphia, the 25-year-old rock band consistently has drawn
sellout crowds despite admittedly bad acoustics in stadiums such as
the Metrodome in Minneapolis. The Stones play there tonight for the
second time.
   By the time the tour grinds to a halt Dec. 20 in Atlantic City,
N.J., more than 3 million concertgoers will have oiled the ``Steel
Wheels'' machine with about $80 million.
   And that doesn't count souvenir sales, corporate sponsorship
from Budweiser and MTV, a line of Stones clothing, album proceeds,
and the multimillion-dollar payoff at the end of the tour from a
live pay-per-view television concert with Eric Clapton, Guns 'N
Roses stars Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin and others.
   ``I'm very proud of the way it's financially run because I have
a lot to do with it,'' the 46-year-old Jagger said in an interview
before Wednesday's show. ``But I'm also very proud of the fact that
we do spend a tremendous amount of money on production.''
   The overhead includes a 300-member entourage, stadium rentals
Jagger describes as sometimes ``unreasonable,'' and two huge stage
sets loaded with pyrotechnics _ the larger of which will not fit
into many stadiums.
   Asked about the accuracy of published estimates that each of the
five band members will net $18 million, Jagger said many of the
estimates have been inflated ``twice or three times.''
   ``America is besot with money. It's always been besot by
money,'' the singer said. ``People like juggling figures around. I
certainly don't know what the end numbers will be and if I did I
certainly wouldn't tell you.''
   Richards, 45, said he's not bothered by America's obsession with
the tour's bottom line.
   ``The Stones have incredible timing. They've always had
timing,'' Richards said. ``Of course everyone has done very well
out of it. But then, why shouldn't they? They are the best.''
   The guitar player said ``Steel Wheels'' is the most demanding
Stones tour he can remember. The 2{-hour show is the band's longest
ever and four shows a week leave little room to play, Richards said.
   In addition, a more complicated sound system is requiring the

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index closed at a
new high for the seventh consecutive trading day today, while the
U.S. dollar declined moderately against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 247.33
points, or 0.67 percent, closing at 37,268.79.
   The index had gained 36.16 points Wednesday, climbing above
37,000 points for the first time.
   It rose today on small-lot buying on a broad front due to the
yen's appreciation against the dollar and investor expectations of
still higher stock prices, securities dealers said.
   A dealer at Nikko Securities Co. said trading company and
electronics shares were bought actively.
   ``The bullish mood is expected to continue for some time,'' said
the dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 1 billion shares,
down from 1.61 billion shares Wednesday.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 142.90 yen,
down 0.63 yen from Wednesday's close of 143.53 yen. After opening
at 143.13 yen, it ranged between 142.75 yen and 143.18 yen.
   A currency dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said that after its low
opening, the dollar remained stable because of month-end demand for
the American currency.
   But another dealer said end-of-month purchases already had been
completed and the dollar was likely to move lower.
   Dealers said there was little prospect that any Japanese or U.S.
economic data to be reported in the near future would knock the
dollar out of the general range of 141.50 to 144.50 yen.

<TEXT>
   Serbia's conservative leaders have
called for a complete severing of political and commercial ties
with liberal-minded Slovenia in a volatile dispute that threatens
to break up Communist Yugoslavia.
   Western diplomats called the move Wednesday a possible first
step in the disintegration of the state _ a loose federation of six
republics and two provinces peopled by several different
nationalities and religious groups.
   The nationalist dispute carries heavy ideological overtones:
Serbia to the east is controlled by hard-line Communists, while
Slovenia to the north is led by liberals who back moves toward
democracy and less state control of the economy.
   Tensions between the two republics have been heightened by
sinking living standards as the federal government copes with
economic troubles that have in the past year bred soaring inflation
and, in turn, serious labor unrest.
   The Serbian Socialist Alliance, a Communist-led mass movement
that serves as a mouthpiece for the republic's populist leader
Slobodan Milosevic, issued the call Wednesday for all enterprises
and organizations in Serbia ``to sever all contacts with Slovenia.''
   The move followed emergency measures taken by Slovenian
authorities to block a mass rally planned for Friday by Serbian
nationalists in Ljubljana, Slovenia's capital, who apparently hope
to topple the Slovenian leadership.
   The rally was to protest purported harassment of the Serbian
minority in southern Kosovo province by members of the ethnic
Albanian majority.
   The protesters claim the Slovenian leadership supports the
ethnic Albanians. Kosovo is a nominally autonomous province, but
Serbia exercises some control over it.
   Friday's rally was called off soon after the Socialist Alliance
announced the break. But many of the at least 40,000 protesters who
were to have traveled to Ljubljana from Serbia for the gathering
had already left by Wednesday and could defy the rally ban. Their
plans were not immediately clear.
   Wednesday was a holiday marking the 46th anniversary of
Communist rule in Yugoslavia.
   The row brings to a head a long series of disputes between
Slovenia, which is setting up a multi-party democracy, and the
Serbian leadership, which advocates continued Communist rule and a
strongly centralized federal system.
   Serbia, the nation's largest republic, has repeatedly attempted
to impose an informal economic boycott against Slovenia, which is
the country's most developed region.
   Slovenia contributes almost a quarter of the gross national
product and a third of the exports of Yugoslavia, whose 24 million
people include nine million Serbs and two million Slovenes.
   The Socialist Alliance's proclamation said Serbs will no longer
allow themselves ``to be humiliated'' by a Slovenia in which ``all
freedoms and human rights have been suspended.''
   The statement described the Slovenian demonstration ban as ``a
crime against justice and truth,'' adding that the Serbian people
``would not accept such an act.''
   A news report on Ljubljana television described Serbia's move as
``senseless,'' saying the Serbian leadership ``has sunk to the
lowest possible moral and political level.''
   The country's constitution in theory allows for its republics to
break away from the federation.
   Slovenia recently adopted amendments to its charter explicitly
giving the region the right to secede if the majority of its
residents so desire.
   Slovenian politicians and the republic's vocal media have
suggested Serbian leaders want to provoke a showdown to impose
their own ideological orthodoxy on all of Yugoslavia and prevent
the establishment of a multiparty system.
   ``The (Serbian move) is the result of Milosevic's dictatorial
policies,'' said a commentary on Ljubljana television.
   The dispute comes in advance of a January congress of the ruling
Communist Party that is expected to lead to constitutional changes
that could grant country's member republics even wider political
autonomy.
   The other four republics have introduced varying degrees of
democracy over the past year while remaining on the sidelines of
the conflict between Serbia and Slovenia.

<HEAD>Church Worker Says Salvadorans Threatened to Slit Her Throat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American church worker says Salvadoran
authorities threatened to slit her throat after she was arrested at
an Episcopal refugee sanctuary in San Salvador last week.
   ``I was blindfolded, handcuffed, hit in the head, threatened,''
Josephine Beecher, 37, of Lopez Island, Wash., said Wednesday.
   ``They said, `Let's set the electric shock up; let's turn on the
electricity.' They ran some object _ we were blindfolded, so I
don't know what it was _ across our throats and said, `This is
what's going to happen to you.'''
   Ms. Beecher was among 19 lay workers arrested Nov. 20 when the
Salvadoran national guard raided St. John the Evangelist Church,
which was sheltering 400 refugees.
   She and five other foreigners were released within a day. But 14
to 16 Salvadorans remain in custody, according to the Rev. Ricardo
Potter, the church's partnership officer for Latin America and the
Caribbean.
   Ms. Beecher said at a news conference that she had been helping
to feed and shelter refugees brought to the church by the Red Cross
when the national guard arrived at 5:45 a.m., searched the area and
removed the lay workers.
   She was taken first to the national guard headquarters, then to
the offices of the treasury police, where the abuse occurred, she
said.
   Ms. Beecher said she was accused of being a terrorist.
   ``There's no way that I or anybody else in the churches are
doing that kind of work,'' Ms. Beecher said.
   After first refusing to sign a release form which stated she had
not been physically or psychologically mistreated, Ms. Beecher said
she was advised by a U.S. consular official named David Ramos to
agree to the clause. She did so and was released.
   She said consular officials later told her ``what I had received
was normal treatment for a prisoner of war and that they didn't see
any problem with that.''
   Episcopal Presiding Bishop Edmond L. Browning said he has
requested a meeting with President Bush, and will send four bishops
to El Salvador on behalf of the remaining church workers, including
the Rev. Jose Serrano, rector of St. John the Evangelist.
   A statement signed Wednesday by nine religious leaders,
including Browning, said Washington has not done enough to change
the Salvadoran government.
   ``The focus at this moment must be on the immediate cessation of
hostilities directed at the churches, including the release of all
those now being held in detention,'' the statement said.
   St. John the Evangelist was one of at least seven churches or
church schools in El Salvador raided by security forces on Nov. 19
and 20. U.S. Ambassador William Walker blamed the raids on ``overly
aggressive security forces'' and suggested President Alfredo
Cristiani was having ``management control problems'' with extremist
elements of his government.
   Two weeks ago, six Jesuit priests, including the rector and vice
rector of the country's Central American University, were slain.
Fellow Jesuits blamed the killings on government soldiers, and the
government promised to investigate.

<HEAD>Cities Ask Feds to Cough Up Anti-Drug Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National League of Cities says it wants the
federal government to stop talking about giving money to help
battle drugs and start passing it out.
   The organization representing 1,400 municipalities wrapped up
its five-day convention Wednesday by also asking the federal
government for more help in dealing with AIDS, adopting a policy
supporting a ban on automatic assault-type weapons and calling for
U.S. sanctions against South Africa.
   Fort Worth, Texas, Mayor Bob Bolen was elected president of the
organization for 1990.
   ``Congress continues to enact anti-drug legislation without
providing significant resources to our cities, the level of
government that deals most directly with our young people,'' said a
resolution passed by league delegates.
   The resolution asked for $3 billion for local anti-drug efforts.
   The chief components of the increased federal funding should be
treatment and education programs for young people, the resolution
said.
   In a policy statement, the league said anti-drug efforts should
include programs aimed at reducing abuse of ``legal drugs,'' such
as alcohol and cigarettes.
   In other business, the league called on cities to adopt
anti-discrimination measures regarding people with acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, but said local officials can give little
concrete help to AIDS victims unless the government provides more
financial support.
   ``Unless the federal government plays a major financial role in
the national public health emergency of AIDS, the state and local
governments' hands are tied,'' the organization said.
   The league also urged a ban on the manufacture, sale and
importation of all automatic and semi-automatic assault-type
weapons, except for the military and police.
   The league further called for a 30-day waiting period for the
purchase or transfer of all guns.
   Previous league policy supported only a ban on the sale or
criminal use of armor-piercing handgun bullets. A motion to amend
league policy to support registration of all guns failed.
   On South Africa, the organization approved a resolution
criticizing the U.S. policy of ``constructive engagement'' toward
apartheid. The resolution backed federal sanctions against South
Africa's government and urged cities to withdraw funds and cease
investment in that nation.

<HEAD>Central Park Rape Victim Returns to Work</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The jogger who was raped, beaten and left for
dead in Central Park seven months ago has gone back to work as an
investment banker, and a relative said she's ``as sharp as she ever
was.''
   The 29-year-old woman, who has undergone physical and emotional
rehabilitation since the April 19 attack, returned full time Monday
to her job at Salomon Brothers Inc., a court source said, speaking
on condition of anonymity. She was assigned to advising large
corporations on investments.
   ``I'm sure they're not going to overload her,'' the source said
Wednesday. ``The doctors were very concerned about the effect of
stress on her.''
   A spokesman for Salomon, Bob Baker, told The New York Times that
the woman returned to work this week ``on a limited basis.''
   Her name has not been published because of the crime's nature.
   The woman's aunt told WABC-TV: ``She has no animosity. She has
the determination that `I'm going to make it,' and she's thankful.''
   The aunt, in silhouette on the Wednesday broadcast, said the
jogger has no memory of the attack, ``and hopefully it will never
come back.''
   ``She's as sharp as she ever was, I think ... and in
conversation, in her grasp of what's going on in the world, she is
very cognizant of world events,'' the aunt said.
   As the woman returned to work, six youths who allegedly
assaulted her appeared in court for a pretrial hearing on whether
statements they gave to police after their arrests should be
permitted as evidence at their trials. Defense lawyers say the
statements were illegally acquired.
   The woman was discovered early on April 20 in a wooded area off
Central Park's 102nd Street transverse. Authorities said she had
been attacked hours earlier, while jogging at night, by a gang of
``wilding'' youths.
   The gang beat and raped her and left her. When found, the woman
had lost most of her blood and was suffering from hypothermia.
   Doctors, initially guarded in their prognoses, have called her
recovery remarkable.
   Before the attack, according to friends and colleagues, the
woman often began working at 7:30 a.m. and spent up to 12 hours in
the office.
   A native of a Pittsburgh suburb, she was released earlier this
month from a Connecticut rehabilitation hospital. She has moved
from her Upper East Side apartment to lower Manhattan, the source
said.
   The source also said the woman has resumed jogging, accompanied
by relatives and friends. She has told prosecutors she is eager to
testify at the trial of the six youths accused of attacking her.

<HEAD>Game Officials Seek Shorter Bear Hunting Season</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hunters are killing too many bears in
Maine, say game officials who want to cut the three-month season by
four weeks.
   The black bear head count likely will reach a record 2,700 by
the end of the season Thursday, said Craig R. McLaughlin of the
Maine Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Department. The harvest has
been creeping upward since 1985, when 1,533 were shot, to 2,651
last year.
   Maine currently has an estimated 17,000 to 20,000 bears,
department biologist Ken Elowe said. The optimum level is 21,000,
McLaughlin said.
   ``Our (bear) population is by no means in trouble,'' said
McLaughlin, who noted the state still has the largest bear
population east of the Mississippi River.
   But if the population is to get back to the target, the seasonal
harvest must be cut to no more than 2,100, he said.
   William Vail, the state fish and wildlife commissioner, said
``the increasing harvest trend is likely setting the stage for
further and more dramatic declines in the population.''
   Vail wants to eliminate four weeks of bear hunting in 1990 and
1991.
   Bears roam every section of the state except the more heavily
populated southern coastal region, McLaughlin said.
   When food is scarce, usually in the summer when they are eating
the most, bears occasionally wander into towns and dumps looking
for food.
   They have been known to peer inside screen doors in the northern
Maine hunting outpost of Greenville, and as many as three have been
spotted within the city limits of the state capital, Augusta,
within a single summer, said Paul Fournier, spokesman for the game
department.
   But black bears are intelligent and secretive and no easy prey
for hunters, McLaughlin said. The bears normally weigh 250 pounds
fully grown and occasionally weigh more than 500 pounds, yet they
are surprisingly quick, he said.
   Officials say bear hunters also may be attracted by what they
see as a macho experience.
   ``They know they can come to Maine and have a quality hunt,''
said Fournier.
   Officials do not know exactly how many bear hunters there are in
Maine, since the state does not issue special bear permits.
   ``But the word we get from the field is that they're getting in
each other's way a little more,'' McLaughlin said.
   The state has scheduled three public hearings in December to get
reaction from hunters, guides and others to the proposal to shorten
the hunting season.

<HEAD>Passengers Praise Pilot for Easy Landing With Crippled Jet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Passengers who cowered in the rear of an Eastern
Airlines jet as it hobbled in on two of its three sets of tires
felt death was certain but said the landing was smoother than
others they experienced.
   Some were so relieved, they raced off the crippled Boeing 727
for connecting flights at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport.
   `I figure it can't possibly happen to another plane tonight, so
I'm going on,'' said Jahnn Gibson, 40, of Saratoga, N.Y., who was
making her first flight Wednesday.
   Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock said none of the 43 passengers and
seven crew members were injured.
   The right main landing gear jammed while retracting after
takeoff from Albany, N.Y. Eastern officials said it appeared a
damaged tire tread jammed the extending mechanism when it separated
from the tire during the takeoff.
   After talking with ground technicians, the pilot, Capt. William
Bundrant, circled the Atlanta airport, moving from side to side and
up and down in an attempt to shake the landing gear loose.
   ``I was terrified,'' said Erika Celella, 33, of Ballston Spa,
N.Y. ``They told us all to get to the back of the plane, then they
screamed `Take any seat!' and I knew we were all dead.''
   With less than one-third of the plane's capacity of 149, the
passengers could fit in the tail of the plane, where they crouched,
heads down and arms over their heads.
   Mrs. Gibson said children cried, their parents prayed and many
``kept muttering `Oh, my God, oh, my God,'' as the jet approached
the runway.
   But to everyone's astonishment, the landing was ``smoother than
a regular landing,'' said Ellen Kemp, 30, of Albany, N.Y., who was
traveling with her three children, ages 9, 2, and 8 months.
   ``I couldn't believe how easy he set it down. It was better than
most normal landings I've been through,'' said Susan Winfree, who
was traveling with her 3-month-old daughter, Casey. ``It made a
little more noise, but that's all.''
   The right wing touched the ground as it rolled to a stop,
causing only minor damage, said Arlene Salac, a Federal Aviation
Administration spokeswoman.
   Bundrant, 51, an Atlanta-based pilot with 23 years' experience
at Eastern, brought the plane to a screeching, grinding halt amid a
shower of fire-suppressing foam from fire trucks.
   Ms. Celella said flight attendants ``were screaming `Get out!
Get out!' and we could smell chemicals that we thought was fuel,
but was really the foam. We thought it was going to blow up.''
   Terrified passengers scrambled down a rear staircase.
   ``I didn't know I could move that fast,'' said Olive Tracey, 66,
who was on her way home to Dade City, Fla., after spending
Thanksgiving with her children. ``I think I was outrunning some of
those younger people getting away from that plane.''
   An Eastern spokeswoman said that the continued strike by its
machinists had no bearing on the incident.
   The landing problem was ``certainly was not because a plane had
not been worked on by licensed, skilled mechanics,'' said Gloria
Prance, an executive assistant at Eastern.

   A man who killed a state trooper as a

   Dalton Prejean was to have died today in the electric chair for

of Donald Cleveland. Cleveland was the only Louisiana state trooper
ever murdered while on duty.
   Prejean was 17 when he shot Cleveland in the face after being
stopped for driving with a broken tail light. Prejean had been
freed six months earlier from a juvenile detention center where he
served time for killing a taxi driver when he was 14.
   He would have been the first person executed after the U.S.
Supreme Court's ruling in June that authorized executions of people
who commit capital crimes while they were 16 or 17.
   Prejean, 9 days from his 30th birthday, has been on Louisiana's
Death Row longer than any other inmate.
   Just eight hours before his scheduled execution, the Supreme
Court said it needed more time to decide whether to hear Prejean's
formal appeal to set aside his death penalty. No date has been set
for the court's action on the appeal.
   On Tuesday, Gov. Buddy Roemer rejected the State Pardon Board's
3-2 recommendation that Prejean's sentence be commuted to life
imprisonment. Soon afterward, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
denied a ninth stay of execution.
   Death penalty opponents made Prejean's case a national cause
celebre, saying he should be spared because he was nearly retarded
with an IQ of 76 and because he was so young when he killed the
trooper.
   The 5th Circuit said he is not retarded under standards of the
American Association on Mental Retardation, which sets the
threshhold at an IQ of 70.
   Prejean would have been the 19th person executed in Louisiana
since the Supreme Court upheld the death penalty in 1976.
Nationwide, 119 people have been put to death.

<HEAD>Suspended Navajo Chairman Arraigned on Criminal Counts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Suspended Navajo Chairman Peter
MacDonald has pleaded innocent to 107 criminal counts, but his son,
also facing tribal charges, failed to appear for his arraignment.
   Judge Robert Yazzie of the tribe's Window Rock District Court
rejected the prosecution's motion for a $400,000 bond and released
the elder MacDonald on his own recognizance Wednesday. A
prosecution request that MacDonald be required to surrender his
passport also was denied.
   Yazzie did not set a trial date, but tentatively scheduled a
pretrial hearing for Jan. 29.
   Meanwhile, special prosecutor Mark Donatelli said he would apply
today for an arrest warrant to have MacDonald's son, Peter
MacDonald Jr., brought to the reservation.
   The elder MacDonald, the leader of the nation's biggest Indian
tribe, was charged Oct. 11 by special prosecutors hired by the
tribe with 107 offenses, including conspiracy, bribery, fraud,
extortion and election-law violations.
   The 60-year-old MacDonald, who was suspended by the Tribal
Council in February, also is the target of a federal grand jury
investigation in Phoenix and a defendant in a multimillion-dollar
lawsuit filed by the 225,000-member tribe in a state court.
   The lawsuit and most of the criminal charges focus on the
tribe's 1987 purchase of an Arizona ranch for $7.2 million more
than the sellers had paid for it minutes earlier.
   Suspended vice chairman, Johnnie R. Thompson, and MacDonald's
son also were charged. Thompson pleaded innocent Nov. 17 to 15
election-law violations.
   Donald Benally, an attorney for the younger MacDonald, filed a
motion on Wednesday asking that the charges be dismissed. Benally
challenged the tribal court's jurisdiction, noting that his client
has lived recently in Phoenix and San Jose, Calif.
   In seeking a $400,000 bond for the elder MacDonald, special
prosecutors said he was a flight risk and posed a danger to the
community.
   ``MacDonald may take this opportunity to flee the country and
get at money in foreign countries,'' Donatelli said. ``The time for
him to leave the country is quickly disappearing.''
   MacDonald scoffed at the prosecution's contention.
   ``I'm a good citizen of the Navajo nation,'' he said. ``I have
no plans to take a flight anywhere.''
   Allegations emerged in testimony before the U.S. Senate Select
Committee on Indian Affairs in January that MacDonald personally
profited from the tribe's purchase of the Big Boquillas Ranch from
Byron T. Brown and K. Tom Tracey, two longtime friends of
MacDonald's.
   The tribe paid $33.4 million for the ranch within minutes after
Brown and Tracey had purchased it for $26.2 million.
   Brown told the Senate panel that MacDonald received $50,000 plus
vacation trips and lease of a BMW automobile.
   In August, the tribe filed a $24 million lawsuit in state court
against MacDonald and others over the ranch purchase.
   The 88-member Tribal Council placed MacDonald on administrative
leave in February, following the Senate hearings.

<HEAD>Indiana Bat Derails $6 Million Lake Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FISHHOOK, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $6 million lake project was derailed
after state officials discovered the site harbored roosts for the
endangered Indiana bat.
   The state called a halt to the recreation project after the
discovery of 39 Indiana bat roosts at the 800-acre lake site,
officials said Wednesday.
   Previously only three trees in the United States were known to
serve as roosts for the winged mammals in the summer, when they
give birth.
   ``This project would have a devastating impact on this species
of bat,'' said Jim Garner, manager of the Illinois Department of
Conservation's endangered and threatened species conservation
program.
   Garner said Wednesday that 12 roosting sites, or trees, would
have been lost if the lake was built.
   The Indiana bat, very similar to the common ``little brown
bat,'' feeds strictly on insects, Garner said.
   Male Indiana bats summer in a variety of eastern U.S. locales,
he said.
   But the females roost and give birth in only a few spots.
   Indiana bats return each year to the same nest as long as it
remains undisturbed, he said, and anywhere from a dozen to a
hundred bats will roost in a single tree.
   ``They have a tendency to roost in trees which have bark that
flakes away,'' Garner said. ``They climb underneath the bark and
have their babies. It's one of their most unique characteristics.''
   Seven caves _ in Indiana, Missouri and Kentucky _ provide winter
shelter for 90 percent of the estimated 350,000 surviving Indiana
bats, officials have determined.
   Each cave is federally protected against private or public
development.
   Concerns about the Indiana bat also were cited during federal
consideration of sites proposed in Illinois, Michigan and Tennessee
for the multibillion-dollar superconducting super collider project,
eventually awarded to Texas.
   Garner and his staff pinpointed the roosts near the proposed
lake project in western Illinois by stringing nets across Fishhook
Creek to catch the bats as they flew upstream. Each bat was fitted
with a miniature radio transmitter that led scientists back to
their roosts.
   The lake project would have expanded Siloam Springs State Park
by 2,400 acres and created an 800-acre lake.
   State Rep. Jeffery Mays, who proposed the project, said the
3,300-acre park does not have a suitable site for a large lake, and
its 56-acre lake is silting in and hasn't been stocked in 20 years.
   ``It's a beautiful park, but it needs a decent-sized lake to
really get things going,'' Mays said. ``I envisioned a lodge and
camping facilities ... But that's history now.''
   It was not the first time a project has been stalled for
conservation reasons.
   In 1973, the snail darter stalled Tennessee's massive Tellico
Dam project for six years after the discovery of the tiny fish in
the Little Tennessee River.

<TEXT>
   Kitty Dukakis, accompanied by her husband, made
her first public speech since she was hospitalized earlier this
month after swallowing rubbing alcohol.
   The audience of 150 at a fund-raising dinner Wednesday night
gave her a standing ovation when she approached the podium and when
she finished her speech.
   Asked afterward how she was feeling, Mrs. Dukakis said, ``Fine,
thanks,'' and told a well-wisher, ``I'm doing all right.''
   Mrs. Dukakis, 52, a recovering alcoholic, has kept a low profile
since she was rushed to Brigham and Women's Hospital on Nov. 6
after ingesting the toxic rubbing alcohol.
   Gov. Michael Dukakis later said his wife had ``a slip,'' or a
relapse back into drinking. Her doctor has said she also suffers
from depression. And during her husband's 1988 presidential bid,
Mrs. Dukakis disclosed that she had been treated for a longtime
addiction to diet pills.
   On Wednesday night Mrs. Dukakis spoke at a dinner sponsored by
the New England Holocaust Memorial Committee, of which she is
honorary chairwoman.
   She said the message of the Holocaust memorial planned for
downtown Boston is: ``Each of us matters. Each of us is responsible
for the other. And each of us has the capacity to fight injustice
and make a difference in others' lives.''

   Two gunmen burst into a bar
frequented by Roman Catholics and opened fire, killing two people
and wounding one, police said.
   The attack shortly before midnight occurred in Moortown, a city
30 miles west of Belfast and a stronghold of supporters for the
predominately Catholic Irish Republican Army.
   Killed were bar owner Liam Ryan, 39, and customer Michael
Devlin, 33. An unidentified man was shot five times in the legs and
was in a stable condition at a Belfast hospital.
   Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, and the mainly
Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party party said the raid
appeared to be a reprisal by Protestant paramilitaries for an IRA
shooting in the nearby village of Coagh.
   The police statement on Wednesday's raid said: ``A number of
people were in the bar at the time. A knock was heard at the front
door. Just before the door opened, or it was about to be opened,
there were a number of shots.''
   The IRA is fighting British rule in Northern Ireland. It wants
to unite the predominantly Protestant province with the 95 percent
Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist rule. Protestant
paramilitaries are opposed to union with the Republic of Ireland.

<TEXT>
   The discovery of what officials believed to
be a bomb inside a suitcase headed for a Colombian jetliner turned
out to be a video game bought as a Christmas gift.
   Only after the suitcase was blown up by a police bomb squad did
experts determine that the suspected explosive device was a video
game. And the owner is angry.
   Carlos Arias said the game was a Christmas gift for his nephews
in Bogota. He said his niece was taking the suitcase that also
contained Christmas cards, other gifts and money, on a Christmas
trip to Colombia.
   ``I asked why they had to blow it up,'' Arias said. ``They
didn't have to. The name, address and phone for my niece were on
the suitcase. They could have just called and asked someone what
was inside. We would have opened it up.''
   But Lt. Daniel Lang, the bomb squad's commanding officer, said
there was ``nothing to snicker about'' in the handling of the
incident.
   ``You never know what you're going to find,'' Lang said. ``So on
every call, we always assume it's a dangerous device.''
   Early Wednesday, the U.S. Customs Service at Los Angeles
International Airport detected what appeared to be sticks of
dynamite, wiring and a clock inside a large, heavy suitcase
destined for an Avianca Airlines jetliner headed for Colombia.
   Experts then examined the detonated contents of the bomb squad
canister and found the device to be a Nintendo game.
   Concern about possible bombings of Colombian airliners has risen
because drug traffickers are waging a campaign of bombings and
assassinations in the South American country in retaliation for
heightened enforcement efforts to curtail their trade.
   All 107 people aboard an Avianca jet were killed earlier this
week when it exploded near the Colombian capital Bogota. Initial
reports, later dismissed by investigators, placed blame for the
crash on terrorists.
   A spokeswoman for Avianca, Colombia's national airline, said
there were tightened security measures in place since Monday's
crash.
   ``There is no confirmation on what caused the downing of that
jet,'' spokeswoman Cecelia Battista said from New York. ``Security
has always been tight but it is even tighter now.''
   The suitcase carrying the suspicious-looking device was set to
be loaded on a Bogota-bound jetliner.
   Customs officials will reimburse the owners of the exploded
suitcase, police said.

<TEXT>
   The father of one of Randy Kraft's 16
mutilation-murder victims yelled ``Burn in hell'' after a judge
sentenced the serial killer to die in the gas chamber.
   The judge also vented outrage Wednesday at Kraft, 44, who
prosecutors said picked up young male hitchhikers between 1972 and
1983, gave them drugs and alcohol, sexually tortured or mutilated
them and then strangled them.
   ``He demonstrated an unbelievable, aggressive, violent tendency
toward humanity. I just can't imagine this violence to satisfy his
sexual desires,'' said Orange County Superior Court Judge Donald A.
McCartin.
   ``If anyone ever deserved the death penalty, he's got it
coming,'' McCartin said.
   Kraft played with his pen cap, yawned, laughed and chatted with
his lawyer during the sentencing hearing. After being sentenced,
Kraft briefly addressed the court.
   ``I have not murdered anyone and I believe a reasonable review
of the record will show that,'' said Kraft, a computer consultant
from Long Beach.
   But Juror Connie Goldfarb said the evidence in the case ``was
more horrible than any horror movie, because it was real. Yet at
times, it was so unimaginable that it was hard to believe it was
real.''
   Darwin Hall could not contain his rage at the man convicted of
murdering his 22-year-old son, Mark Howard Hall.
   ``Burn in hell, Kraft!'' the elder Hall screamed as his son's
killer was led from the court.
   Victims' relatives who endured six years of trial procedures
after Kraft's arrest cried and hugged each other outside the
courtroom.
   They wondered how Kraft, who prosecutors said tortured one
victim with a cigarette lighter before castrating and strangling
him, could appear so indifferent in court and maintain his
innocence.
   ``I saw the evidence. I guess we all know the evidence,'' said
Judy Nelson, whose 18-year-old son Geoffrey was one of Kraft's
victims. ``I don't know how he could sit there and say it other
than (because) he wants to make appeals.
   ``It just show you how pathologically a liar, a Doctor Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde, he is.''
   The judge made a similar observation.
   ``I sat here for a year, and I didn't see any remorse, feelings
or regret,'' McCartin said. ``It seemed he was in another world
during this trial.''
   McCartin assessed the death penalty for 11 murders and
consecutive life prison terms for the other five murders, saying
that would ensure Kraft's imprisonment in case all the death
sentences were somehow overturned. A death sentence is
automatically appealed to the state Supreme Court.
   Kraft also was sentenced to 10 years in prison for three counts
of sodomy, four counts of mayhem and three counts of great bodily
injury.
   A jury convicted Kraft on May 12 after a 10{-month trial and
recommended the death penalty in August.
   California Highway Patrol officers arrested Kraft in 1983 when
they pulled him over for erratic driving and discovered a strangled
Marine from El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in his car.

   About 70 Czech and Slovak exiles living
in Austria began a sit-in strike at the Czechoslovak Consulate
today because they were repeatedly denied visas to visit their
homeland, a protester said.
   The protesters signed a petition that was handed to consulate
personnel and relayed to Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock.
   A protester said the consulate's visa department turned down the
applicants ``in an unfriendly manner,'' but that an official
promised to discuss the matter with Czechoslovak officials.
   In a letter circulated to the news media, the 70 exiles called
on Czechoslovak Ambassador Milan Rusnak to intercede with
Czechoslovak authorities on their behalf.
   ``We demand that by virtue of your office you intervene
emphatically with your government to ensure the right of free
travel for all Czechs and Slovaks living abroad,'' the latter said.
   The letter also called for the abolition of the compulsory
exchange of money for people traveling to Czechoslovakia because
``we are not slaves of the (Czechoslovak) regime.''
   ``We will stay here in the consulate until our demands are
fulfilled,'' the protesters, who asked not to be identified, told
The Associated Press.

<UNK>Dollar Higher In Quiet Trading, Gold Falls</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against most major currencies in
early European trading today, with some analysts predicting it
would move higher and others saying it was only pausing momentarily
before resuming its downward trend.
   Gold prices fell sharply but were recovering from their
overnight lows on a wave of fresh buying.
   Foreign exchange dealers attributed the dollar's firmer tone to
tighter U.S. interest rates and a lull in the West German mark's
upward climb.
   ``What's happening is that the mark was being overbought and
this has slowed slightly,'' one Milan trader said. ``At this point,
it's the mark that's moving everything, not the dollar.''
   Many Frankfurt dealers said the dollar will continue to move
lower against the mark in coming days, but some traders said the
market may now try to test the dollar's upside.
   ``I personally believe the short-term outlook is bullish,'' said
one trader at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt. ``I think the next move is
up. People have been buying overnight.''
   News that Deutsche Bank chief Alfred Herrhausen was killed in a
bomb attack early today was spreading through the markets but
didn't have any impact on the mark or other currencies, dealers
said.
   ``Certainly it raises concerns about internal security and
public order, but the world is focused on issues of wider
implication in Germany,'' one trader said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.63 yen to a closing 142.90 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 142.65 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.7890 West German mark, up from 1.7825
   _1.5960 Swiss francs, up from 1.5895
   _6.1025 French francs, up from 6.0810
   _2.01855 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0100
   _1,318.50 Italian lire, up from 1,315.50
   _1.1645 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1658
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5680 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.5655 late
Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $406.20 a troy ounce,
down from $412.50 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a higher recommended price of
$406.80.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $406.75, down from $411.70 bid late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $5.59 to close at a bid $405.76.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.57 a troy ounce, down
from Wednesday's $5.65.

   Police Department telephones were used to place
$58,000 in calls to sex, dating, sports and horoscope specialty
lines in the first nine months of this year, officials said.
   But they said steps have been taken to block such calls in the
future, and an internal investigation has begun to find out who
made the calls.
   ``We take this problem very seriously and we intend to seek full
reimbursement from the officers and civilian police employees
responsible,'' said Inspector Richard Mayronne.
   ``If we don't get the money, we will be forced to take action,''
said Michael Amarosa, police director of communications.
   The calls were discovered after an audit.
   Amarosa, who ordered the audit, said $2,000 has been collected
for unauthorized calls.
   Mayronne said officers or civilians assigned to phones from
which calls were placed will have to pay for the bills.
   A complete breakdown of the number of calls and where they were
placed was not available.
   About 4,300 police phones are electronically blocked from making
such calls; the calls were made on 2,700 that are unrestricted. A
three-month telephone company strike that ended last week has
hampered efforts to trace the calls.
   It was reported last month that two city school districts have
amassed more than $90,000 in calls to pay-per-call exchanges.

<TEXT>
   A flamboyant Saudi prince has rolled
out the red carpet at his luxurious bayfront mansion and put aside
$2.5 million to help save the nation's stray cats.
   Prince Mohammed al-Fassi, who travels with a entourage of more
than 170 people, is providing a home for dozens of stray cats
himself, putting them up in seven rooms until their own private
quarters can be built on his five-acre compound.
   ``We are going to send Asians through the United States to hunt
the cats,'' said the prince's personal adviser, Victor Talaat.
   The cats at al-Fassi's $3.2 million bayfront mansion have more
than royal accommodations to purr about. They have a private
veterinarian and a staff to keep them well-fed and groomed.
   The prince said he decided to help the forgotten felines when he
learned that humane groups kill the animals if owners are not found.
   Talaat picked up 25 cats from the Dade County Animal Services
and the Humane Society on Tuesday and said the prince expects to
take up to 60 cats from the agencies.
   Al-Fassi made headlines in the early 1980s for a spate of
controversies linked to his enormous wealth and jet-set lifestyle.
   In 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected al-Fassi's appeal of a
more than $77 million divorce settlement.
   Al-Fassi is negotiating to buy Indian Creek Village, which
includes 28 mansions and a country club he hopes to convert into a
mosque.
   ``We don't want trouble with neighbors, you know,'' said Talaat.
``We want the whole island. We'll make them an offer they can't
refuse.''

<TEXT>
   A Philadelphia school district program that
gave preference to minority contractors has been struck down by a
federal judge who said it failed to meet a new, more rigid test
established by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   U.S. District Judge Charles R. Weiner on Wednesday said that
``generalized assertions'' of discrimination were not enough to
justify the program, which mandates that a minimum percentage of
each contract be given to firms controlled by minorities and women.
   The Supreme Court in January struck down a similar set-aside
program in Richmond, Va. Since then, lower courts around the
country have overturned other such programs.
   Weiner ruled in a case brought by a white-owned construction
firm, Main Line Paving Co. of Devon, after it lost out on a
contract for demolition and asbestos removal at an elementary
school.
   School officials Wednesday had no comment.
   The set-aside program was established in 1984.
   The district based its plan, which requires that each contract
include at least 15 percent minority and 10 percent female
participation, on a general finding of discrimination in awarding
of contracts. A City Council investigation showed that only 0.5
percent of district contracts went to minority firms in 1982 and
1983.
   But Weiner wrote that such evidence was not sufficient.
   ``It is clear that a majority of the (Supreme) Court believes
that state and local laws and policies employing racial and ethnic
classifications must be supported by specific evidence of
discrimination against those aided by the law or policy,'' he said.

   A leading U.S. scientist says there is
statistical evidence of a possible link between cancer and exposure
to electromagnetic fields that radiate from the cables and wires
that electrify the nation.
   The unpublished findings by Dr. Genevieve Matanoski, an
epidemiology professor at Johns Hopkins University, run against the
grain of traditional scientific theory about the possibility of
health dangers from power distribution lines.
   Her conclusions fit an emerging pattern of evidence, however,
that the possibility of health risks can no longer be ruled out and
should be studied more closely.
   ``This is consistent with my judgment ... that we'll end up
seeing electric and magnetic fields are cancer promoters of some
kind,'' said Indira Nair, a physicist at Carnegie Mellon University
and co-author of a recent comprehensive background paper on the
issue for the federal Office of Technology Assessment.
   Ms. Matanoski said in a telephone interview Wednesday that her
findings were preliminary and required further testing, but that
the results changed her view of the still unproven theory about a
cancer link to power lines.
   ``I thought before that the theory was wrong,'' she said. ``I'm
not so sure any more. I'm swayed to think it's more likely than
before.''
   A major conclusion from her study of 50,000 New York state
telephone workers is that there may be an increased risk of
leukemia among active workers. Incidence rates for almost all types
of cancer are highest among linemen, whose exposure to
electromagnetic fields is the highest in the telephone worker
group, the study found.
   Ms. Matanoski also found exceptionally high rates of breast
cancer among male technicians who work on central office telephone
switching equipment. Her study found two cases of breast cancer
among 9,500 central office technicians; ordinarily the incidence
rate for males would be about one in 1 million, she said.
   Ms. Matanoski said she expected to publish her findings early
next year.
   Any electrically charged conductor generates two kinds of
invisible fields, electric and magnetic. Taken together, they are
called electromagnetic fields. Some scientific findings have
suggested these fields can interfere with the functioning of DNA
and RNA, the controllers of cell reproduction, and that they may
stimulate activity in biochemicals linked to the growth of cancer.
   In the century since the United States began using electric
power, scientists generally have dismissed suggestions of any
danger to human health.
   Ms. Matanoski stressed in the interview that she was not yet
convinced of any health danger, but said she no longer was willing
to rule it out. She said further research with a larger number of
workers was needed before she could be sure.
   ``I have too few cases (of cancer) to feel strongly about'' a
possible link, she said.
   Her study found three cases of leukemia among 4,500 linemen, an
incidence rate seven times higher than among other telephone
workers. The overall rate of cancers of all types among linemen was
nearly twice as high as among other telephone workers.
   Ms. Nair said the Matanoski results were particularly important
because of her high standing in the epidemiology community and
because she had earlier declared herself a skeptic. Ms. Nair said
she had not yet seen the results of the study.
   The electric power industry already has shown signs of concern
about the Matanoski findings.
   Earlier this month, officials of the Electric Power Research
Institute, an industry group, sent letters and briefing papers to
utility executives noting that Ms. Matanoski's results ``may
attract national attention because they suggest an increased risk
of cancer.''
   The briefing paper called the findings ``unexpected,'' noting
that an earlier Matanoski study sponsored by the electric industry
found no statistically significant link between cancer and
electromagnetic field exposure in retired telephone workers.
   Ms. Matanoski said she had been suspicious of her findings in
the study of older workers because of the possibility that her
sample may have excluded younger telephone workers who contracted
cancer but died before reaching retirement age.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will meet with
other leaders of Warsaw Pact countries in Moscow in early December
to discuss his talks with President Bush, Tass reported today.
   It will be the highest-level meeting of the seven countries of
the East bloc alliance since hard-line Communists fell from power
in East Germany, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia.
   Tass did not report the date of the meeting.
   Bush and Gorbachev will meet Saturday and Sunday aboard U.S. and
Soviet warships off Malta.
   Their topics are expected to include reductions in NATO and
Warsaw Pact troops and tanks across Europe, and cuts in U.S. and
Soviet arsenals of long-range bombers, missiles and nuclear
submarines.
   Bush will travel to Brussels, Belgium, following the summit to
brief leaders of the 15 other countries that make up the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   The last Warsaw Pact meeting, held in July in Bucharest,
Romania, papered over growing tensions in the Soviet-led alliance,
including differences over democratic reforms.

   The reported crash of a CIA plane carrying
supplies to anti-communist rebels in Angola is underscoring
U.S.-Soviet differences on the eve of this weekend's superpower
summit in the Mediterranean.
   Government officials said Wednesday the L-100 plane went down
Monday night in southeastern Angola after a flight from a military
base in Zaire.
   The crash occurred just two days after the Bush administration
lodged a protest with the Soviet Embassy over an abortive attempt
to deliver Soviet weapons to leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   That shipment was foiled when the Cessna aircraft carrying the
weaponry from Nicaragua crashed in eastern El Salvador.
   The administration reacted indignantly to the perceived Soviet
involvement in support of the Salvadoran insurgency, but there was
little U.S. comment Wednesday night after the disclosure of the
crash in Angola.
   The State Department acknowledged that there was a crash in a
remote area of Angola and that among the passengers on board there
were four Americans.
   Other government officials, insisting on anonymity, said all the
Americans on board were killed and that some of the accompanying
Angolan rebels survived.
   The sources were unable to identify the dead Americans but a
Defense Department official on Tuesday reportedly notified the
family of James Spessard, 31, of Hagerstown, Md., that he had died
in a plane crash ``near Zaire.''
   A family member told the Hagerstown Morning Herald that the
Pentagon official had offered very little information about the
crash.
   Spessard is survived by his wife, Deborah, and two small boys.
   The resupply mission from Zaire to Angola cannot be discussed
publicly by the administration because the United States provides
assistance on a confidential basis.
   One source said the leak of the information originated with
members of Congress opposed to U.S. military involvement in Angola.
   The disclosure highlighted the continuing differences between
Moscow and Washington on some Third World conflicts as President
Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev prepare for their
summit meeting in the Mediterranean.
   Meanwhile, the French newspaper Le Monde reported Wednesday that
the Soviet Union has told Nicaragua and Cuba to stop supplying arms
to the Salvadoran rebels. The Soviet ambassador to Nicaragua gave
the instructions at a secret meeting Tuesday in Managua, Nicaragua,
the newspaper said.
   The newspaper said the Soviets hoped to gain points with
Washington in the summit by ordering the halt in support to the
leftist rebels.
   Angola, whose government is run by Marxists, is one of several
regional conflicts in which the superpowers have been arming
opposite sides.
   The United States has been providing covert aid to the UNITA
rebels in Angola since 1986 while the Angolan government has been
backed by Soviet weaponry and Cuban troops since the country gained
independence in 1975.
   Hope for a settlement in Angola rose last December when Cuba
agreed to withdraw its 50,000 troops from Angola over a 27-month
period as part of a broader agreement.
   The Angolan government and the rebel movement agreed to a
cease-fire this past June but it broke down in August.
   The Bush administration has been attempting to promote national
reconciliation in Angola through free elections, but thus far there
has been little basis for serious negotiations.
   The country has been ravaged by long years of warfare. Randall
Robinson, a critic of U.S. military involvement, said Wednesday the
United States has turned Angola into a ``graveyard.''
   It is not known exactly how much money the United States
provides the Angolan rebels because the figures are secret, but
congressional sources estimate the amount at about $40 million
annually.
   Bush administration officials have said the Angolan government
has shown little interest in engaging in serious peace negotiations.
   The United States has been using Zaire as a staging area for
resupplying the Angolan rebels but Zairean President Mobutu Sese
Seko suspended his government's cooperation with that effort in
June when he became a peace mediator.
   Mobutu, during a visit to Washington in early October, agreed to
the resumption of the resupply flights under U.S. pressure. The
Monday flight is said to have been the first since June.

<TEXT>
   A bomb today killed the
powerful chairman of West Germany's largest bank as he drove to
work, and officials said the leftist Red Army Faction terrorist
group claimed responsibility.
   Deutsche Bank chief Alfred Herrhausen, 59, died in the explosion
at about 8:30 a.m. in the affluent Frankfurt suburb of Bad Homburg,
where he lived.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, his eyes filled with tears and his voice
breaking, condemned the slaying as ``a cowardly and brutal murder''
and described the influential European financier as a friend and a
patriot.
   Herrhausen, probably the best-known figure in West Germany's
business world, often advised Kohl and frequently accompanied the
chancellor on his foreign trips.
   The chief federal prosecutor's office said the Red Army Faction,
which has carried out numerous terrorist attacks in West Germany,
claimed responsibility in a letter found at the scene of the
attack. It was the first known Red Army attack in more than three
years.
   Police officials said the blast lifted Herrhausen's armored BMW
into the air, consuming it in a ball of fire.
   The Deutsche Bank and the chief federal prosecutor's office said
Herrhausen's driver was alive but suffered serious injuries.
   Prosecutor's spokesman Hans-Juergen Foerster said authorities
erroneously reported earlier that the driver, Jakob Nix, had died,
blaming the error on an incorrect report from police on the scene.
   The blast was heard as far away as three miles and shattered
windows in the vicinity.
   Foerster said it appeared a remote-controlled detonating device
set off explosives placed in the car's path.
   Other officials speculated that a man on a bicycle may have
carried out the attack.
   Police also said they were searching for a man in a blue jogging
suit and cap who fled on foot after the attack. Helicopters were
being used in the search.
   Witnesses told police a Fiat with Frankfurt license plates was
apparently used in the escape. Later reports said police also were
looking for an Audi.
   An Interior Ministry spokesman, Siegbert Seitz, said Herrhausen
was considered a top target of leftist terrorists because of the
investment policies of his bank.
   Herrausen led the Deutsche Bank on an aggressive expansion
course aimed at making the institution one of the top 10 or 15
banks in the world.
   He urged greater investment in the Soviet Union and other parts
of Eastern Europe. Most recently, he had been speaking out in favor
of more West German investment in neighboring East Germany.
   Police sealed off the wooded, rural road where the car was
destroyed. More than three hours after the blast, the banker's body
remained in the back seat of the shattered and burned car.
   Herrhausen was the second chairman of a major West German bank
to be slain in the last 12 years by the Red Army Faction. Dresdner
Bank's Chairman Juergen Ponto was killed by the group in 1977.
   Herrhausen joined Deutsche Bank in 1969, became a board member
two years later. He was named bank chairman in 1988.
   The Deutsche Bank chief was probably West Germany's most
influential business figure, sitting on numerous boards of
directors, including for the giant Daimler-Benz conglomerate.
   The killing stunned business and government leaders throughout
Europe.
   In Bonn, Free Democratic member of Parliament Wolfgang Weng
interrupted a budget debate to denounce ``the horrible news'' of
Herrhausen's death.
   Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble broke into tears as he told
Parliament about Herrhausen's death.
   In Frankfurt, the frantic-paced stock exchange came to a
minute-long halt.
   Herrhausen is survived by a wife and two daughters.
   The last known Red Army attack occurred in October 1986, when
diplomat Gerold von Braunmuehl was shot and killed on a street in
Bonn.

   Alyssa Smith is ``on the road to a very good
outcome'' after undergoing the nation's first liver transplant from
a living donor, a hospital spokeswoman said today.
   Doctors planned to meet today to determine if the 21-month-old
child's condition should be upgraded from critical but stable, said
Mary Fetsch of the University of Chicago Hospitals.
   ``The first blood tests today show Alyssa's liver function is
improving,'' Fetsch said. ``She's still on an average recovery
course but certainly on the road to a very good outcome.''
   Alyssa, who underwent surgery Monday, should be able to go home
within a month, doctors said Wednesday.
   Her mother, Teresa, 29, who donated a segment of her liver to
her daughter, is progressing well enough to be released next week,
hospital officials said.
   Mrs. Smith may be able to visit Alyssa today for the first time
since the operation, Fetsch said.
   Alyssa suffered from an often fatal disorder called biliary
atresia, the leading cause for liver transplants involving
children. She had been waiting more than when her parents asked to participate
in the hospital's
new living-donor program.

<TEXT>
   President Elias Hrawi said today he was
determined to gain control of the presidential palace from
rebellious Christian Gen. Michel Aoun but that he would spare no
effort to avoid bloodshed.
   ``I don't want bloodshed, either in east Beirut or in west
Beirut,'' Hrawi told reporters at a Lebanese army barracks in
Syrian-policed eastern Lebanon.
   But, he added: ``I'll use all possible means to reunite the
country.''
   Hrawi has fired Aoun as army commander and ordered him to
relinquish the presidential palace. The general refused, and he
accused Hrawi of being a lackey of the Syrians, whom he has been
trying to force out of Lebanon.
   Military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
hundreds of Syrian army trucks hauled ammunition to forward
positions facing Aoun's troops in south Beirut and the eastern and
northeastern mountains.
   ``The Syrian troops are in combat formations. Their command is
supplying them with enough ammunition for quite a long time,'' one
military source said.
   France sent an amphibious troop ship, the Orage, to Lebanese
waters in preparation for a possible evacuation if French nationals
were endangered. It sailed from the southern port of Toulon early
today.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt said Lebanese army units serving
under the new commander, Adm. Emile Lahoud, would take part in any
effort to dislodge Aoun from his headquarters at the
shell-shattered presidential palace in Baabda, east of Beirut.
   ``Aoun will not quit easily. The nationalist army would take
part in the battle to evict him,'' said Jumblatt, who is minister
of public works in Hrawi's unified government.
   About 22,000 mainly Moslem troops serve under Lahoud, while Aoun
has a predominantly Christian force of 20,000 soldiers.
   Hrawi, a Maronite Catholic like Aoun, accused the rebellious
general of ``partitioning Lebanon.''
   A Moslem government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Wednesday: ``The next 48 hours will be decisive to
determine whether Aoun's problem will be dealt with politically or
militarily.''
   Parliamentary deputy Butros Harb, a Maronite Catholic, was
dispatched by Hrawi to the Vatican and Paris early in the week ``to
discuss ways of solving Aoun's problem,'' the official said.
   Thirty-three right-wing French parliamentarians were on their
way back to Paris today, a day after they flew into Lebanon's
Christian enclave to declare support for Aoun.
   In heavy rain Wednesday, protesters carried umbrellas and took
cover under pine trees to maintain a human shield around the
presidential palace. A large crowd was still there today.
   ``The army usually defends the people. Now the people are
defending the army and its general,'' the Aoun spokesman said.
   But the Moslem Voice of the Nation radio, in a commentary, said
Aoun was using the Christian youths as ``human sandbags to hide
behind.''
   Shiite Moslem militia chieftain Nabih Berri, in a statement,
called on ``our brethren in the Christian enclave to support the
survival of Lebanon, not the survival of a person (Aoun).''
   Berri, who doubles as minister of electrical and hydraulic
resources, said Hrawi's government was one of ``national unity. A
government of peace. We prefer to solve this problem peacefully,
but we cannot wait for ever.''
   Parliament elected Hrawi president on Saturday to replace his
assassinated predecessor, Rene Mouawad. Both pledged to implement
the provisions of a Lebanon peace agreement hammered out by
Lebanon's parliament in Saudi Arabia.
   Aoun, who fought the Syrians for six months earlier this year,
rejected the accord because it did not include a fixed timetable
for a Syrian troop withdrawal.
   The Syrians have 40,000 troops controlling 70 percent of
Lebanese territory under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.

<TEXT>
   Authorities have cleared the way for criminal
charges to be filed against ousted leader Erich Honecker and other
disgraced officials of the past Communist Party leadership, East
German officials announced today.
   A security cordon also was erected around the lavish compound
where Honecker and other party figures suspected of wrongdoing live
to prevent them from taking state property, the official ADN news
agency reported.
   Hartmut Boecker, head of the local governing council for the
Neubrandenburg area where the party officials live, said he ordered
the area sealed off and stripped the former leaders of their
immunity from criminal charges.
   Boecker said the declaration clears the way for criminal
proceedings against Honecker, former Premier Willi Stoph and others.
   There was no immediate indication of what charges might be filed
or when.
   The actions coincide with other efforts by party chief Egon
Krenz to distance his new, reform-minded leadership from the
reported abuses of power committed by Honecker and his colleagues.
   On Wednesday, East German newspapers disclosed that Stoph had
taken valuables from his opulent estate after Communist Party
officials began investigating allegations of wrongdoing by former
party figures. The reports said Stoph had turned a park into a
private estate that included several homes and an indoor swimming
pool.
   Krenz and Communist Premier Hans Modrow signed a petition
circulated by activists who are calling for East Germany to remain
socialist.
   Keeping a socialist framework could help the Communists maintain
the power they have wielded without contest for 40 years.
   Krenz, 52, who has been in office only six weeks, faces a strong
challenge from reform activists he will meet with Wednesday, as
well as from the Communist Party hierarchy that will attend a
special congress on Dec. 15-17.
   His ability to remain party leader will depend largely on his
success in appeasing the opposition forces at Wednesday's talks.
   The talks are the latest political development in East Germany,
where the exodus of thousands of people and massive anti-government
demonstrations led to the ouster of Honecker on Oct. 18 and the
opening of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9.
   The party has agreed that Krenz and Modrow will debate the
course of reform with delegates from allied political parties and
from opposition groups.
   Both sides agreed to let church officials moderate the
discussions at a Lutheran Church facility in East Berlin, the
official ADN news agency reported Wednesday.
   A main issue will be a proposal to strike the Communists'
guaranteed monopoly on power from the state constitution, church
sources said.
   Spokeswoman Angelika Barbe of the East German Social Democrats
said her recently formed party planned to call for measures to free
political prisoners and remove barriers remaining for the return of
those who fled the past regime.
   Nearly 300,000 East Germans have moved to West Germany this
year, discouraged about prospects for speedy or thorough reform at
home.
   Opposition groups have pushed for the reform talks to cover
economic issues. A main concern is stopping further damage to the
weak East German mark caused by black-market sales spurred by
travel to the West.
   The petition signed by Krenz and Modrow was initiated by writer
Stefan Heym and other East German intellectuals concerned about the
country's future. They want a national referendum on whether the
country should remain socialist.
   The Communist leadership, as well as many members of the
pro-reform groups, oppose West German efforts to work toward
reunification of the two Germanys.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday laid out a
10-point plan for building a confederation between the two states,
aiming at reunification.
   The Bonn government launched a diplomatic offensive to promote
the idea. Kohl telephoned President Bush and Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher flew to Britain and France to inform the
allies of the plan.
   Krenz has sought to use East German public sentiment against
reunification as a rallying call to win popular support for his
beleaguered Communist Party.
   ``We have the historic duty to preserve this country with its
anti-fascist ideals and traditions as a socialist alternative
within German development,'' he told backers of the appeal, who
want a nationwide ``vote of confidence'' in socialism.
   Echoing the words of the petition, Krenz promised that East
Germany will preserve ``peace and social justice, individual
freedom, freedom of travel for all and the preservation of the
environment.''
   The Communists, bowing to pressure from growing opposition
forces, have promised free elections. No date has been set.

   Many residents of the affluent
Escalon neighborhood, including about 20 U.S. citizens, took
advantage of a brief guerrilla truce and fled the battle zone today.
   The leftist rebels launched a second assault on the capital
Wednesday and turned their weapons on wealthy districts, where they
seized homes, forcing scores of Americans to take refuge in the
U.S. Embassy.
   Rebels were dug into the neighborhoods late Wednesday, vowing to
paralyze the heart of the country's wealth and power.
   But the rebels had declared a six-hour truce beginning at 6 a.m.
(7 a.m. EST) for evacuation of those who wished to leave, and
Escalon was mostly quiet this morning, with only scattered gunfire.
   It appeared most of the rebels retreated shortly before dawn up
the lower slopes of the San Salvador Volcano, which looms over the
district. However, some evacuating residents said rebel snipers
remained in the their homes.
   The bodies of at least nine soldiers lay on the streets.
Reporters saw only one dead guerrilla, a woman still clutching her
U.S.-made M-16. The total number of casualties was not known.
   Several Americans said they planned to leave the country this
evening on the first of several charter flights arranged by the
U.S. Embassy. Diplomatic sources said about 250 U.S. citizens would
fly out this evening.
   ``I'm not coming back,'' said Kate Lewis, who carried her
8-month-old baby Cassandra from their home down Mirador Street to
where an embassy official was waiting for them. Her husband,
William, was barefoot.
   Both are teachers at the American School. About 30 guerrillas
took over their home before dawn Wednesday. They were accompanied
by two other teachers, Sam and Sheri McKibben.
   Small groups of residents carrying belongings gathered on almost
every street corner in the 20-square-block area.
   The embassy official awaiting the Lewises, said 12 U.S.
households had family members who spent Wednesday night in Escalon
in rebel-controlled areas.
   The official, who declined to give his name, said all the
Americans left the neighborhood this morning. Other U.S. citizens
managed to leave Wednesday.
   Some Salvadoran residents said they were staying to protect
their homes.
   The winding, hilly streets were blocked at intervals by
barricades of cars, most of them with their tires shot out. A
burned-out light tank destroyed by a rebel rocket sat on the street
up from the Lewis' house.
   Many Americans had earlier taken refuge in the embassy or the
headquarters of the U.S. Agency for International Development
headquarters in areas well away from the fighting.
   About 100 Americans, almost all women and children, spent the
night at the U.S. Embassy and were to leave today in a chartered
jet, embassy spokesman Barry Jacobs said.
   Jacobs said the Salvadoran national airline TACA planned extra
flights for the next few days to carry others. He refused to call
it an evacuation, saying that embassy dependents were given extra
leave for Christmas vacation. ``No one is being made to go,'' he
added.
   There are between 8,000 and 10,000 U.S. citizens in El Salvador
at any one time about 400 to 500 of them are employees of the
embassy and the Agency for International Development and their
dependents, Jacobs said.
   Guerrillas seized a U.S. Embassy employee's home Wednesday, but
the family was allowed to leave the area unhurt, the State
Department said in Washington.
   The home of an embassy employee also was reported burned during
the fighting, but it was not clear if it was the same house or if
the fire was set deliberately. Embassy officials refused to give
any other details.
   The embassy, miles away near downtown San Salvador, told its
employees not to try to get to work.
   Japan's diplomatic liaison office, about four blocks from U.S.
Ambassador William Walker's residence, was taken by the rebels, but
the few people inside were allowed to leave escorted by rescue
workers, a Salvadoran Foreign Ministry source said. In Tokyo, a
Foreign Ministry official denied the office had been taken but said
staffers reported fighting in the neighborhood.
   A Western diplomat said the guerrillas had also seized the
residence of a mid-level French diplomat, allowing those inside to
be evacuated.
   Jeff Brown, another U.S. Embassy spokesman, said perhaps 100 to
200 rebels had taken positions Wednesday in Escalon and Benito,
heavily armed and moving in small groups. The rebels issued a
statement in Washington on Wednesday saying their fighters were
under orders not to attack U.S. citizens.
   Guerrillas seized the homes of three wealthy Salvadorans, but
freed the people inside ``to demonstrate'' they were a
``responsible force'' fighting for ``democracy,'' the rebel
broadcast said.
   The broadcast by the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front rebels called Wednesday's attack part of a ``constant
strategic siege on the capital city, the nerve center of the
nation.''
   Dagoberto Gutierrez, a rebel commander, said Wednesday's attack
was the second wave of an offensive first launched on the capital
Nov. 11, during which an estimated 1,000 people were killed.
   The first phase turned slums and poor neighborhoods into
battlefields for 12 days, sending tens of thousands fleeing.

<HEAD>Attorney General Did Not Want Exxon Third Mate Indicted, D.A. Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The district attorney's office
considered bringing charges against the third mate of the Exxon
Valdez in addition to the captain, but Alaska's attorney general
vetoed the idea, a prosecutor says.
   Anchorage Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole said he favored
indicting Gregory Cousins, who was in control of the tanker when it
struck a reef March 24 and began spilling nearly 11 million gallons
of oil into Prince William Sound.
   Cole testified Wednesday at a pretrial hearing for fired skipper
Joseph Hazelwood that he was told ``the attorney general said no''
to a Cousins indictment.
   ``The reasons we were told were that they felt Mr. Cousins could
help them out in their civil case, and they didn't want to make Mr.
Cousins an enemy in their civil case,'' Cole said.
   His testimony came on the third day of the hearing for
Hazelwood, who has been charged in the spill. Cole, who will be the
prosecutor at Hazelwood's trial Jan. 22, was among a string of
witnesses the state has presented to show why the captain should be
tried.
   Hazelwood, 43, a veteran mariner from Huntington, N.Y., was not
on the bridge at the time of the grounding. He left the tanker
under the supervision of Cousins.
   Hazelwood faces felony charges of criminal mischief plus
misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment, operating a vessel
while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil.
   Hazelwood's lawyers say charges should be dismissed because he
reported the tanker accident and thereby qualified for immunity
under state law.
   Virtually every piece of evidence against Hazelwood can be
traced to his prompt report and may not be used against him, the
defense argued.
   The state contends that discovery of the spill was inevitable
and that independent sources provided information for Hazelwood's
prosecution.

   Eight people aboard a twin-engine
commuter plane that vanished off Rhode Island have been given up
for dead.
   The Coast Guard called off the search by air and sea Wednesday
night for the New England Airlines plane that disappeared Tuesday
during a 17-mile flight from Block Island to the mainland.
   Searchers had found the bodies of a passenger's two dogs that
had been on board, as well as a cabin panel, life jackets, seat
cushions, a headset and other debris believed to be from the plane,
but saw no other sign of the aircraft itself or those aboard.
   ``The results of the search indicated there were probably no
survivors from the crash,'' Petty Officer David Jersey said.
   In Westerly, National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Ted
Lopatkiewicz said today that without wreckage the cause of the
crash is unlikely to be determined.
   ``I think all we're going to be able to do today is go through
the aircraft records and the pilot records, and unless something
comes up out of the ordinary, there won't be much,'' he said.
   The NTSB had no authority to order a search for the wreckage,
and any attempts to find it would be up to the airline's insurance
company, Lopatkiewicz said.
   The Coast Guard began its search shortly after the British
Norman Islander plane, built in 1969, was reported missing.
   Coast Guard officials had expressed hope early Wednesday of
finding survivors, but veteran islanders said the seas of 5 to 6
feet and water temperature of about 45 degrees made survival
unlikely.
   The debris was found mainly in an area where the water averages
100 feet deep.
   Thomas Grady, New England Airlines' attorney, said the Federal
Aviation Administration would also investigate.
   The plane ``had the most thorough inspection it gets in the
preceding 30 days,'' he said.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said today it will
begin dismantling its fortifications along the border with Austria,
and lawmakers recommended abolishing some of the toughest laws used
to crack down on dissent.
   Government spokesman Marcel Jansen said the Interior Ministry
was asked today to start immediate removal of ``technical
equipment'' along parts of the Czechoslovak-Austrian border. Such
equipment includes concrete pylons linked with barbed wire and some
electronic wire to detect trespassers.
   The moves came one day after Parliament took the historic step
of removing the guaranteed leading role of the Communist Party from
the constitution.
   Jansen refused to specify when and exactly where work on the
border would start, saying it was likely to begin near the Slovak
capital of Bratislava, a one-hour drive east of Vienna.
   In May, Hungary started dismantling fortifications along its
border with neutral Austria, its only point of contact with a
Western country.
   Czechoslovakia also has a long border with West Germany, but
Jansen made no mention of action along that border.
   The order to dismantle part of Czechoslovakia's portion of the
Iron Curtain reflected the new foreign policy that Communist
Premier Ladislav Adamec has promised to follow.
   Adamec is due to name a new coalition government by Sunday that
would include non-Communists and possibly members of the Civic
Forum opposition group, which headed up 11 days of anti-government
protests and a hugely successful general strike Monday.
   He continued consultations today after announcing that he could
accept opposition suggestions on whom to include.
   Civic Forum spokesman Jiri Dienstbier said Wednesday night that
the opposition wanted a civilian Communist in charge of the Defense
Ministry and a non-Communist overseeing police forces at the
Interior Ministry.
   Dienstbier reiterated past statements that Civic Forum has no
Cabinet aspirations, but he did not specifically exclude
participation in the government by some of the experts who have
worked with the opposition.
   Seeking to paint himself as a figure of national consensus in
the current crisis, Adamec in a television speech Wednesday made a
number of points aimed at winning him the sympathy of
Czechoslovakia's 15.5 million citizens.
   His call for a reassessment of the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion
that crushed the 1968 ``Prague Spring'' reforms was accompanied by
a pledge to negotiate the withdrawal of the 80,000 Soviet troops
stationed in Czechoslovakia.
   Those troops were seen as the legitimizing force of the
Czechoslovak leaders installed by Moscow after the invasion.
   Those leaders _ ousted party chief Milos Jakes and other top
Communists _ now have lost power.
   The state news agency CTK today said unidentified parliamentary
deputies suggested abolition of toughened laws on public order,
which were passed in March and used to impose stiff fines or jail
terms on hundreds of people arrested during a series of
anti-government demonstrations in January.
   The deputies said this amendment, and a series of other new
legal measures, should be submitted for consideration in Parliament
Dec. 12-13.
   The deputies also proposed shortening the period of pre-trial
custody to a two-month maximum. Political prisoners have sometimes
waited more than a year to go to court.
   The deputies also proposed removing the criminal offense of
``abusing a religious function'' from the statute books.
   This law, which imposed maximum imprisonment of three years, was
frequently used against priests deemed to have overstepped the
strict state controls on churches in Czechoslovakia.
   Priests must have a state licence to practice in Czechoslovakia,
and many have had to go underground after being barred from office
by the authorities.
   The deputies also want an unspecified change in the criminal
code article on emigration, CTK said. It seemed likely they would
seek to drop criminal charges against those who left the country
illegally.
   The deputies also recommended that the independence of courts be
anchored in a new draft constitution to be published and passed
soon.
   They also seek a new law meting out punishment to those who
damage the environment.
   Thirty percent of Czechoslovakia's forests have been destroyed
by acid rain and other pollution, and both air and water are
heavily polluted in Prague and several other cities.
   Tighter control of pollution by large state enterprises has been
a key demand of opposition groups for several years.
   Also today, six political prisoners were reported released, and
former Charter 77 spokesman Stanislav Devaty, who went underground
several weeks ago, and another rights activist were amnestied by
President Gustav Husak.
   There were no other details immediately available.

   The 1989 hurricane season, marked by the costliest
storm in U.S. history, officially ended today with yet another
tropical storm forming in the Caribbean.
   At 8 a.m. EST, Tropical Storm Karen, with 50 mph winds, was
about 125 miles south-southwest of Havana and was not expected to
strengthen, said the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral
Gables. It was drifttng toward Cuba at about 5 mph.
   Depressions become named storms when their sustained winds reach
39 mph; hurricanes have winds of at least 74 mph. Karen is the 11th
named storm of the season, which began June 1.
   The six-month season was far less deadly than 1988's, in which
550 people died in storms.
   This year's storms killed 84 people, including 56 in the United
States, said meteorologist Mark Zimmer. Hurricane Hugo was blamed
for 49 deaths, including 21 in this country. It slammed into South
Carolina on Sept. 21.
   ``I've seen greater damage in smaller areas,'' said Bob Sheets,
director of the hurricane center. ``But I've never seen it on such
a large scale where you go mile after mile with such massive
damage.''
   Overall damage from Hugo totaled about $10 billion. In the
United States, it caused a record storm damage of about $7 billion.
Most of the U.S. damage was around Charleston.
   The U.S. Virgin Islands are racing to recover from Hugo in time
for the tourist season.
   ``We are still in a sense reeling from the effects of Hugo but
that didn't dampen our spirit,'' said Alexander A. Ferrelly,
governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands. He said Wednesday that St.
Thomas and St. John are ready for winter tourists and St. Croix
would be ready by early 1990.
   It was the most expensive disaster for the American Red Cross
since the organization began 110 years ago. Latest figures show the
agency has spent about $38 million in the Caribbean and the
Carolinas, said Michael Caudill, a spokesman in Washington.
   The hurricane season, which began June 1, had four tropical
storms, counting Karen, and seven hurricanes. The storms also were
stronger than usual, said Sheets.
   Last year, there were seven tropical storms and five hurricanes.
The Atlantic season usually has 10 named storms. Normally, only
five or six whip up the 74-mph sustained winds to become a
hurricane.
   Hugo, the fifth major Atlantic hurricane in the last decade to
reach U.S. shores, may have marked the end of a 30-year period of
fewer, weaker hurricanes, Sheets said.
   ``There have been fewer of the stronger hurricanes making
landfall since the 1960s,'' Sheets said. ``Now maybe we're starting
to return to more normal activity like we had in the '50s and
'60s.''
   During the 1950s, eight major hurricanes hit the United States,
while seven struck the following decade.
   After Hugo, the most damaging tropical system this year was
Tropical Storm Allison. It dumped large amounts of rain and caused
11 deaths and $500 million damage in Texas and Louisiana.

   Nadia Comaneci, the world renowned
gymnast who made Olympic history when she was 14 years old, has
dropped from sight after fleeing across the Romanian border into
Hungary.
   Ms. Comaneci's former coach, Bela Karolyi, said today she was
``probably'' in the U.S. Embassy in Switzerland obtaining travel
papers, but an embassy spokesman denied it.
   Karolyi became a U.S. citizen last spring and is currently in
West Germany with an American women's gymnastics team.
   Ms. Comaneci told Hungarian border officials she had been banned
by Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu from traveling abroad and was
fleeing her native land ``for the sake of freedom,'' official media
reported.
   Ms. Comaneci crossed into Hungary by car before dawn Tuesday at
the border town of Kiszombor, with six other Romanians who were not
identified, the MTI news agency said.
   Her defection was a surprise, particularly because the
28-year-old athlete-turned-trainer reportedly had close ties with
the Ceausescu family and at one time was said to have been
romantically involved with the Romanian president's son, Nicu.
   Ms. Comaneci dropped from sight Wednesday, when she and her
companions left the hotel in the nearby town of Szeged where they
had been lodged by police, according to Hungarian press reports.
   Ms. Comaneci had been given a three-day temporary residence
permit.
   A spokesman at the Hungarian Olympic Committee told The
Associated Press today the gymnast had not contacted them and they
knew nothing of her whereabouts.
   Because of her achievements, Ms. Comaneci was named a ``Hero of
Socialist Labor'' by Ceausescu, the hard-line leader who declared
at last week's Romanian Communist Party Congress that he would not
yield to the forces of reform sweeping the rest of the East Bloc.
   At age 14, Ms. Comaneci dazzled the sports world at the 1976
Montreal Olympic Games with the first-ever scores of perfect 10s in
Olympic gymnastics. She won three gold medals, in the uneven bars,
balance beam and overall competitions.
   The achievements of the 4-foot-11 teen-ager brought her elite
status in her homeland and tremendous popularity in the United
States.
   During a competitive career that lasted until 1984, Ms. Comaneci
won a total of 21 gold medals in Olympic and other international
contests.
   She reportedly had been living in an eight-room villa and had a
Western car, both extremely rare for private citizens in a country
that has endured chronic shortages of consumer goods for most of
this decade.
   In the past two years, tens of thousands of Romanians have
sought refuge in Hungary because of worsening economic conditions
and political intransigence at home.
   ``Just like me, she was chased out of the country by the
Romanian authorities,'' said Karolyi, who defected to the United
States in 1981.

   A police officer whose slaying of a black suspect
set off three days of rioting took the stand at his manslaughter
trial today and said he fired because the man was bearing down on
him with his motorcycle.
   ``I turned my body to face the motorcycle. He just came straight
at me with a tremendous noise,'' said Officer William Lozano. ``He
was just aiming at me. I was just able to turn my body, draw my gun
and shoot.''
   The five-year veteran of the Miami Police Department said he
thought he was going to die and was briefly in shock.
   After recovering, he said, he found no vital signs when he
checked on the motorcyclist. He saw that the cyclist's passenger
was injured and radioed a dispatcher to say he had fired his weapon
and a fatality was involved.
   The prosecution charges Lozano acted with gross negligence when
he shot and killed the motorcyclist, Clement Lloyd, 23, on Jan. 16,
sparking three days of rioting in the community's black
neighborhoods. The passenger, Alan Blanchard, died the next day.
Lozano is charged with manslaughter in their deaths.
   Lozano, 31, testified that he was ``hyper'' and that the
dispatcher did not understand his first transmission. He said he
took a deep breath and repeated it.
   Within moments, an angry crowd gathered and Lozano said he and
others ``were getting hit right and left'' with rocks and bottles.
   Lozano's account came after a half-hour of questioning about his
personal history and his police service, giving the jury an
impression of a well-trained officer with a list of commendations.
   Under cross examination, Assistant State Attorney John Hogan
asked Lozano to read aloud from a police review document that
listed Lozano as average in most categories, including
decision-making and reliability.
   Hogan also had Lozano recount an incident in which a jai-alai
player accused Lozano of physical abuse during a strike.
   Lozano was just beginning to review the events leading up to the
shooting when the trial was recessed for 45 minutes after an
alternate juror complained of abdominal pain and nausea.
   Addressing his answers with a slight Spanish accent directly to
the jury, the Colombian-born Lozano wore a dark blue suit, dress
shirt and red tie for his appearance. The testimony was broadcast
live on Miami television and radio.
   Prosecution witnesses contended that the motorcyclist was in the
opposite lane from Lozano when the officer coolly took aim at the
driver, tracked him with his gun and fired the fatal shot as the
bike was about to pass him.
   The defense, however, insists that the motorcyclist, attempting
to outrun a pursuing squad car, had crossed into the traffic lane
where Lozano was standing and the officer shot in self-defense to
avoid being run over.
   One defense witness, 18-year-old Dedrick Belle, balked at giving
depositions and had fled investigators attempting to talk to him,
according to court testimony.
   Belle, who lives in the Overtown neighborhood where the shooting
and subsequent rioting occurred, told the court Wednesday he feared
for his life if he was made to testify for the defense.
   ``It will result in violence ... because I'm black and he shot a
black guy,'' Belle told Dade Circuit Judge Joseph Farina.
   Over the objections of media attorneys, the judge banned any
filming of Belle during his brief testimony.
   His testimony was aimed at compromising star prosecution witness
Eddie Johnson, who was talking with Lozano just before the
shooting. Johnson wound up with the cartridge casing from the fatal
bullet after the shooting, but denied on the stand that he had
waved it about or shown it to neighbors before turning it over to
police.
   Belle, however, said Johnson showed the shell to everyone, and
even let him hold it.
   Other defense witnesses Wednesday included a former University
of Miami professor, Geoffrey Alpert, who prepared a study of Miami
police weapon discharges between Jan. 1, 1980, and Dec. 31, 1986.
   Alpert, who now teaches at the University of South Carolina,
said 13 percent of the 150 shootings he examined were instances in
which an officer was firing while being attacked by a vehicle.
   The prosecution has contended that Lozano disregarded police
policy when he failed to step out of the roadway, and then fired at
a moving vehicle.
   When the case opened Oct. 23, the defense attempted
unsuccessfully to move the trial, arguing that Miami juries would
be too worried about renewed racial violence to find Lozano
innocent.
   Twice before in this decade, innocent verdicts favoring
policemen accused of killing blacks have led to rioting, and the
Miami and Metro-Dade police forces have been on alert because of
Lozano's trial.

   Motorists bombed a toll booth that is under
construction and claim that other parts of an unpopular turnpike
system that opens next year also are boobytrapped, newspapers
reported Thursday.
   No one was injured in the Wednesday night blast, which damaged
the foundation of an unfinished toll booth, newspapers said.
   Many commuters oppose having to pay a toll to drive into Oslo.
Many bomb threats have been made against toll booths, which have
yet to open, but police have no suspects, according to the reports.
   An anonymous caller told the newspaper Dagbladet that a group of
18 motorists was responsible for the bomb.
   ``We will stop the toll system. We will continue attacks, but do
not wish to hurt anyone. Explosives were buried before concrete was
poured, so it is too late for police to search,'' he said.

<HEAD>Don't Close Leaning Tower, Pisa Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PISA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Local officials Thursday disputed the
government's plan to close Pisa's famed leaning tower for
restoration work, saying it is in no immediate danger.
   ``The closure is unjustified because the situation of the tower
has not worsened recently and because conservation work can be
initiated without banning tourists,'' said Giuseppe Toniolo, who
heads Opera Primaziale, the private institution managing and
restoring the tower.
   An estimated 800,000 visitors a year climb the 294 marble steps
of the 162-foot monument, bringing in revenue of about $71.4
million.
   The government commission for public works suggested Tuesday the
leaning tower be closed immediately. A final decision by the
government is expected soon, although the city can appeal it to
Parliament.
   Government experts are worried because its tilt has been
increasing by an average 0.047 inches a year since measurements
began in 1918.
   The tower was completed in 1360, and experts believe it began
leaning immediately because it was built on sinking soil.
   The government has allotted $7.1 million for the conservation of
the tower, but experts have been stumped on how to save it.
   Gero Geri, a professor of topography in Pisa, has said it will
take at least 100 years before the tower reached the point of
toppling.

   The federal government will give South
Carolina $8.4 million to fight the threat of forest fires fueled by
thousands of trees downed by Hurricane Hugo, state and federal
officials said Thursday.
   The money will be used to cut 11,400 miles of firebreaks, lease
fire detection and fighting equipment, fund a public awareness
program and coordinate efforts to salvage downed timber worth an
estimated $1 billion, said Paul Hall of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
   ``We at FEMA believe the Hugo forest blow-down is a serious
emergency with the potential for great danger in the event of
serious, uncontrolled wildfires,'' Hall said.
   Officials say 36 percent of the 12.2 million acres of forested
land in South Carolina was damaged by the Sept. 21 storm. They say
they are weighing plans to ban burning in some unincorporated areas
of the state to lessen the fire danger.

   John E. Sears, 21, was charged Wednesday with breaking and
entering after spending the night wedged in the chimney just inches
away from a hot boiler. He was held in lieu of $5,000 bail and for
violating probation on a previous charge.
   Sears, who told police two accomplices ran away when he got
stuck, was discovered after employees arriving for work heard
someone screaming, said office manager Kathleen A. DiMeo.
   ``They heard someone screaming `Help!', but they couldn't figure
where it was coming from,'' DiMeo said.
   Police located Sears in the 20-foot stack, lowered a rope and
pulled him out.
   Sears was covered with soot but nothing else after apparently
shedding his clothes during the night in the stack, police said.
   ``He's lucky he didn't burn to death,'' said Herbert King, a
library maintenance worker.

<HEAD>2 Killed, 450 Injured in Violence During General Strike</HEAD>

   Violence broke out amid a nationwide
general strike, and two people were killed and 450 injured, police
said Thursday.
   A supporter of the National Socialist Party, was killed in a gun
battle inside the Dhaka University campus with student activists of
the Awami League during the general strike, a police official said.
   The National Socialist Party and the Awami League both oppose
President Hussain Muhammad Ershad and his government, but like most
opposition groups, they periodically fight each other. Both groups
supported the strike, which was called for Wednesday and Thursday.
   One person was killed and at least nine others injured when two
bombs exploded at an opposition rally in Dhaka on Thursday, the
officer said.
   The strike was called by the Awami League and the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party, another major opposition group, to dramatize
their demands for Ershad's resignation.
   In Dhaka, shops, banks and schools remained closed and traffic
was sparse Thursday. News reports said the strike was successful in
at least 20 other major towns.
   Police and news reports said at least 450 people were injured
and 300 anti-government demonstrators arrested nationwide in
clashes with police.
   It was the latest in a series of strikes called by opposition
parties to try to force free elections under a caretaker
government. Ershad says he is willing to hold new elections without
relinquishing power, a proposal the opposition has rejected.
   Ershad's two main political opponents _ Sheik Hasina of the
Awami League and Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party _
said the success of the strike was a verdict against the government.
   Mrs. Zia told Ershad to resign by Dec. 31 or face more street
protests.
   Ershad, 59, a former army general, seized power in a bloodless
coup in 1982. He resigned from the army in 1985 and a year later
was elected to a five--year presidential term in elections that
many believed to be rigged.

   A hummingbird that stayed too long in
Alaska is about to get a free flight to California with the help of
an amateur ornithologist who took the bird under her wing.
   Hummingbirds usually leave the Alaska Panhandle by late summer,
but a male Anna's hummingbird appeared in October outside the home
of a woman who had put her hummingbird feeder away for the winter.
The woman put the feeder back outside and contacted Bev Woods, a
volunteer with a Juneau wildlife group.
   Woods provided a trap to catch the bird, and is feeding it at
her home until transportation can be arranged.
   Woods said Wednesday that the species of hummingbird has been
spotted in Juneau only in recent years. ``The Anna's hummingbird
pretty much breeds along northern California and into Oregon,'' she
said.
   Woods has received about 20 offers from people planning to fly
to northern California or southern Oregon in the next few weeks and
willing to take the bird along. A hummingbird expert in San
Francisco has offered to acclimate it to the weather there before
releasing it, she said.
   It will be the second hummingbird to receive a free trip south
from Alaska this fall. About a month ago a Costa's hummingbird
found in Anchorage was flown to Seattle and released.

   In the land of the power lunch, some
professionals tired of the same old faces and deal-oriented dining
prefer just to share a nice midday meal with someone new.
   Capitalizing on that need, entrepreneur Stephen Bagish arranges
blind lunch dates at $15 a pop.
   Bagish, 29, quit his job as a video distributor three months ago
to create the Lunch With Someone New service, which he says is
designed for the purely platonic joining of kindred souls.
   ``My service pairs people for a friendly lunch _ not for love or
sex,'' he said.
   Bradley Rose, an attorney who signed up, said the lack of dating
pressure made the noontime encounter more enjoyable.
   ``For $15, you expect to maybe make a new friend at lunch, to
have a good time. That's exactly what it was,'' Rose said.
   Bagish said he came up with the idea after dining with the same
colleague day after day.
   ``He's a nice guy,'' Bagish said. ``But every day? No way.''

   A woman who may have the world's largest
bell collection says it's easy to become hooked on the hobby.
   ``Touch one or two and first thing you know, you're a
bell-a-holic,'' said Iva Mae Long, whose children and grandchildren
also have caught the bug.
   Mrs. Long's home in western Pennsylvania is brimming with about
20,000 bells. A 2,200-pound one is displayed in the front yard.
   Mrs. Long caught the bug from her father, James Oliver Elliott,
who died in 1983 at age 93. He started the hobby in the early
1950s, though the idea for the collection had been planted in his
mind before the Great Depression.
   ``He rode with his father on a milk wagon, and they used to ring
a bell at each stop to signal customers to come out with their
containers to be filled,'' she said.
   Mrs. Long began her own collection in 1959, later inherited her
father's bells, and can't resist adding still more.
   ``After all, a bell is the only thing in the house that thanks
you for dusting it _ it rings,'' she said.

   Grand Forks officials were ``pleased as
the dickens'' about winning a bid for rail-based MX nuclear
missiles that would bring jobs and prestige.
   ``That's a lot of insurance policies, cars and turtlenecks,''
said Bob Gustafson, president of the Grand Forks Chamber of
Commerce, after learning Wednesday that the Grand Forks Air Force
Base was among six new sites chosen to get the missiles, all of
which are currently kept at a base in Wyoming.
   But in Minot, 200 miles to the west, there was disappointment.
   Both cities lobbied hard for the missiles, through
letter-writing campaigns and visits to Washington.
   The 50 MX missiles are to be removed from underground silos in
Wyoming and placed on 25 trains, each with two MX missiles aboard.
The trains will be in Wyoming and on bases in Grand Forks and five
other areas around the country. The missiles will be moved onto
civilian railroad tracks in time of crisis.
   The loss of the rail-based system was hard on Minot because it
came just about a year after the transfer of 18 fighter jets to a
National Guard base in Massachusetts.
   ``You win some and you lose some,'' said Bruce Christianson,
chairman of the Minot Chamber of Commerce's military affairs
committee.
   The Grand Forks base and the Minot Air Force Base maintain
nuclear missiles and strategic bombers. The Minot base opened in
1959, and the Grand Forks base in 1960. The Minot base has about
14,000 military personnel and their families, the Grand Forks base
13,000.
   Both bases contribute more than $200 million to the economies of
their communities.
   ``We're disappointed, of course,'' said Minot Mayor George
Christensen. ``We don't know what they have down the line, but we'd
accept anything else.''
   Brig. Gen. Patrick Caruana, commander of the Grand Forks base,
said construction of the MX system could begin in 1992 and the
system could become operational two years later.
   North Dakota houses about 300 Minuteman missiles _ each capable
of carrying three warheads _ in underground silos near Minot and
Grand Forks. The MX missiles can carry up to 10 warheads.
   Caruana said the Grand Forks garrison will cost $80 million to
$100 million, and employ as many as 450 people.
   But Grand Forks Mayor Mike Polovitz, along with the state's
congressional delegation, cautioned that the project might not be
built at all because of changes taking place in the Soviet Union
and its Eastern European allies.
   ``I still have some questions whether it will be funded because
of what is happening in Europe now,'' Polovitz said. ``I'm pleased
that we as acommunity got together and worked for this. I'm also
pleased with what's happening in Eastern Europe, so we're kind of
caught in between.
   ``If they go ahead with the rail garrison and fund it, I'm
pleased as the dickens to have it here in Grand Forks.''
   Peace activists, meanwhile, were unhappy with the entire idea of
the MX missiles.
   ``An MX missile by its very nature is a first-strike weapon,''
said Al Hermodson of the Crookston Peace Workers in Crookston,
Minn., near Grand Forks. ``I see this either as a continuation of
first-strike capability or as a welfare program for weapons
manufacturers. I think it's a little of both.''

<HEAD>The Son of Stavropol Peasants Finds Place for Religion in His Reforms</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The man struggling to renew Lenin's revolution
more than 70 years after it declared religion the ``opiate of the
people'' was himself baptized in his peasant village into the
ancient rites of Russian Orthodoxy.
   And if 58 years later Mikhail S. Gorbachev does not believe in
God, his early years apparently engendered a healthy respect for
those who do, including his mother.
   The Gorbachev years have seen a dramatic shift in official
tolerance of religion in a country whose people ostensibly have
been turned into spiritual materialists by decades of Communist
dogma. Gorbachev has told religious leaders that they, too, have a
place in the Communist-led healing of the nation's psyche.
   But as government pressure eases, the future of a nascent
religious revival is beginning to depend more on the willingness of
church leaders to throw off their own strictures and traditional
subservience.
   Since Gorbachev became Soviet leader in March 1985:
   _ The number of baptisms and reopenings of churches in the
Christian heartland have increased dramatically. Important
religious centers like the Pechorsky Monastery of Kiev have been
given back. Jews also enjoy greater religious freedom and a revival
of Islam in Central Asia is increasing the number of seminary
students and mosques.
   _ Scores of religious dissidents of all faiths have been freed
from jails and prison camp.
   _ The patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church has met with the
Soviet leader for the first time in more than 40 years. Clergy
celebrated the 400th anniversary of the Moscow Patriarchate on Oct.
13 with the first service in more than 70 years in the Kremlin's
Uspensky Cathedral, where Russian czars once were crowned.
   _ Gorbachev has met with a top representative of the Vatican,
and will meet with Pope John Paul II on Friday. Members of the
banned Ukrainian Catholic Church in the western Ukraine believe the
Vatican meeting will lead to legalization of their church after 43
years underground.
   Asked in July whether he had been baptized after his birth in
1931 in the southern Russian village of Privolnoye, Gorbachev
replied: ``Yes, I was. I think it's quite normal, isn't it?''
Reporters who have visited the area say his mother, Maria, still
regularly attends Russian Orthodox services.
   Interviewed by Finnish TV in conjunction with Gorbachev's visit
to Helsinki in October, Archbishop Anatoly of Stavropol said the
official attitude toward religion in that region, which includes
Privolnoye, eased when Gorbachev was the local Communist Party
leader.
   ``Practically speaking, beginning in 1975 in Stavropol churches
and groups of believers have been able to exercise all their
rights,'' he said. ``We've had perestroika since 1975.'' Gorbachev
was regional party chief from 1970 to 1978.
   When he met with Patriarch Pimen of the Russian Orthodox Church
prior to the celebration of the church's millenium in 1988,
Gorbachev made clear that religious believers have both a stake and
a place in his reform program.
   The millenium, he said, should be ``marked by the consolidation
of our country's believers, all working people, for the sake of our
common great cause of perestroika, of the renewal of socialism, the
complete unfolding of its humanistic ethical potential.''
   Soviet officials have been reporting for more than two years
that a new law on religion is being prepared, and they say it is
likely to be presented to the Soviet legislature soon.
   They promise the law will ease strict Stalin-era prohibitions on
group religious instruction and charitable work by churches, and
make it easier for them to receive official recognition.
   The law has not yet been changed, but some Russian Orthodox
churches have begun to act. According to the weekly Moscow News,
Moscow parishes are contributing heavily to support children's
homes in the capital.
   Veniamin Yefremov, an inspector for the government Council of
Religious Affairs that has been charged with overseeing believers,
encouraged more charitable work.
   ``Apparently some people are waiting for some instructions from
above. There is only one instruction in such work _ the dictates of
the heart,'' he said.
   Muscovites say baptism has become increasingly popular, even
fashionable, in some circles. But it does not mean that the
baptized know much about the faith they have embraced, or even want
to know.
   Two scholars, writing in the Communist theoretical journal
Kommunist in 1987, said people had begun flocking to churches to
find some beauty in the religious chanting and church icons that
was missing in their increasingly cheerless lives in the Soviet
system.
   Religious critics wonder whether Russian Orthodox Church
officials, used to taking what the government is willing to give,
can take advantage of the freer atmosphere.
   During recent harsh years, the Russian Orthodox Church
concentrated much activity on disarmament issues, which at the time
coincided with Soviet government propaganda efforts.
   Ukrainian Catholics are demanding the return from the Russian
Orthodox Church of buildings and property taken over when their
religion was forced underground in 1946.
   ``If we could count on sincerity and Christian love from the
Russian church there wouldn't be a problem,'' said Father Yaroslav
Chukhny, who led Lvov's Cathedral of the Transfiguration from the
Russian Orthodox Church to the Ukrainian Catholic Church on Oct. 29.
   ``The essence of religion is not building churches or holding
beautiful services, but the morals of man,'' he said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Photos of the U.S. Stealth fighter, said to show
the top-secret warplane in unprecedented detail, have been
published in a weekly defense magazine.
   Jane's Defense Weekly said the pictures show that the view of
the plane given by the U.S. Air Force a year ago ``was carefully
selected to conceal the F-117's true shape, and made the aircraft
appear much shorter and wider than it is.''
   The article accompanying the two pictures was written by Bill
Sweetman, a leading civilian authority on the Stealth program to
build bombers and fighters that can elude radar detection.
   One picture appeared to show the delta-winged Lockheed F-117A
flying horizontally, while the other showed it in a vertical
position. In each picture its landing gear was down and it was
accompanied by a T-38 chase plane.
   Sweetman wrote the aircraft is coated in radar-absorbent
material and ``faceted'' to discourage the scattering of radar
energy toward the transmitter location.
   The fighter is a different aircraft from the Stealth bomber
recently unveiled for TV cameras.
   Sweetman wrote that the fighter's overall length is 66.6 feet,
wingspan is 41.6 feet and maximum takeoff weight is about 45,100
pounds.
   The report said two squadrons of F-117s are operational with the
4450th Tactical Group at Tonopah, Nev.
   It said the last of 59 F-117s, including five test aircraft,
were likely to be delivered next year. It said one test aircraft
and two production planes have been lost in accidents since the jet
made its first flight in October 1981.

   Mother Teresa, who suffered a heart

Friday, her doctor said.
   The 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun was taken to Woodlands
Nursing Home Wednesday night, said Sister Dorothy, a member of
Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity.
   Mother Teresa fell ill Wednesday hours after she met visitors
for the first time since she left the nursing home Oct. 14, said
Dr. Ashim Bardhan. He added that she was resting Thursday and that
her condition was normal.
   Sister Dorothy said a special prayer for Mother Teresa was
conducted Thursday at the Missionaries of Charity, the headquarters
of her worldwide charity that cares for the destitute and the dying
on six continents.
   Mother Teresa, who won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize, was
hospitalized Sept. 5 and suffered a heart attack three days later.
   Her condition worsened until a temporary pacemaker stabilized
her heart.
   The Yugoslav-born nun founded the charity in October 1959 in an
abandoned hostel donated by the city. The order, which was formally
recognized by the Vatican in 1965, expanded and has 3,000 nuns
working in 87 countries.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Legislature Takes Up Tax Increases</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A state legislative committee approved and sent to
the House for debate today $1.1 billion in tax increases to close
the budget deficit that signaled the end of the Massachusetts
Miracle.
   The package of higher taxes on capital gains, sales and gasoline
was approved on a voice vote Wednesday by the House Ways and Means
Committee. It immediately drew fire from both legislators and the
public.
   ``This bill imposes the most regressive kind of a tax, hitting
hardest those in Massachusetts who can least afford it,'' said
Edward E. Mulligan, head of Massachusetts Electric Co.
   The House was scheduled to begin debate on the package today,
and House leaders said they hoped to send it to the Senate by the
end of the week.
   The proposal is the Legislature's latest move to deal with the
deficit, which a Ways and Means Committee staffer said had swelled
to $825 million. Only a year ago, the economic boom dubbed the
Massachusetts Miracle nearly carried Gov. Michael Dukakis to the
White House.
   As the committee sent the proposal to the House, the Senate held
hearings on a $350 million House-approved package of spending cuts.
Legislative leaders envision enacting the cuts in conjuction with
the tax package, which has been embraced by the governor.
   Under the tax package, the sales tax would rise from five cents
to seven cents on the dollar; the gas tax would go from 11 cents to
21 cents per gallon, and capital gains would be increased from 5
percent to 7.5 percent.
   The package would raise nearly $1.1 billion in additional
revenue by the next fiscal year. Still more revenue would be raised
by shifting $30 million more in cigarette taxes into the general
fund and by collecting $24 million in unclaimed returnable-bottle
deposits.
   The package was developed by the House leadership, and Speaker
George Keverian backed it up by telling several committee chairmen
they should resign if they they could not support it. One committee
chairman quit on Tuesday.
   Democratic Rep. John McDonough spoke up for new taxes before the
Ways and Means vote, saying it was time the Legislature and the
administration corrected spending errors that were based on overly
ambitious revenue estimates.
   ``At what point do we face up to the fact that we were all wrong
about the deficit?'' he asked.
   Rep. Steven Pierce, the Republican minority leader, said the
Democratic leadership's deficit estimates are designed to promote
taxes. He estimated the deficit is less than $500 million and
accused the Democratic leadership of ``twisting arms and getting
that tax bill through here as quickly as possible.''
   John Gould, head of Associated Industries of Massachusetts, said
the increase in the capital gains tax would stifle economic growth.
   ``We are going to ... hurt our image and make ourselves less
attractive to investors from outside the state,'' he said.

   The former head librarian at the
University of Texas Medical Branch has been charged with stealing
five rare medical books from the school.
   Emil Frey, 62, surrendered to Galveston County sheriff's
officials Wednesday and was later released on $23,000 bond.
   An indictment handed up Monday accuses Frey of stealing five of
80 books missing from the UTMB Moody Medical Library's
12,000-volume Truman G. Blocker Rare Book Collection _ one of the
nation's largest collections of rare medical texts. The indictment
says the books were valued between $750 and $20,000.
   University police found several books in a private storage shed
rented by Frey, said a statement issued Wednesday by the Galveston
County district attorney's office.
   ``Police officials contend the books were sent to a bookseller
in New York City for sale by Frey for his personal benefit,'' the
statement said.
   Frey's attorney, David Walker, declined to comment on the case,
saying he hadn't had a chance to go over the indictment in detail.
   Frey became director of the Moody Medical Library in 1973. He
resigned from his $83,000-a-year position May 17 amid an
investigation into the disappearance of the books.
   Officials at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston
have said the missing books were duplicates of others in the
collection.

   Using phony dollar bills in a soft
drink machine may have seemed like a joke to three high school
students, but the state calls it forgery.
   The suspects, two 17-year-olds and one 16-year-old, are
scheduled to appear on forgery charges before a Sevier County
juvenile court judge Jan. 10.
   Less than $10 had been put into the machine at
Gatlinburg-Pittman High School when it was discovered last week,
said police chief Harry Montgomery.
   It appeared the students initially got faculty members to copy
the bills for them by telling the teachers they wanted to use the
copies in a Monopoly game, Montgomery said.
   The students could also be charged with counterfeiting, but
Agent Jess McGaha of the U.S. Secret Service office in Nashville
said the service is not pressing charges, although using a copy
machine to duplicate money is considered counterfeiting.
   ``There were no hardened criminals involved here,'' he said.

   The team returned from Hanoi on Wednesday after three days of
talks, said James Williams of the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok.
   He quoted the U.S. team leader, Lt. Col. Joe Harvey, as saying
the talks ``ranged from researching and investigating specific
crash sites to the exchange of wartime information.'' They agreed
to meet again in January.
   Harvey commands the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center, which
is trying to determine what happened to 2,323 Americans who did not
return from the war.
   The talks were the first since October, when special U.S.
presidential envoy John W. Vessey met Vietnamese Foreign Minister
Nguyen Co Thach. Vessey said Vietnam agreed to work on lists of
top-priority ``discrepancy cases'' involving about 80 Americans.
Such cases include people the United States believes were taken
prisoner but not freed after U.S. involvement in the war ended in
1973.

   The Raleigh Times published its last
edition today, bidding farewell with the headline, ``That's All,
Folks.''
   The afternoon paper, which traces itself through various names
back to 1879, folded so that The News and Observer, the morning
paper owned by its parent company, could be expanded, The News and
Observer Publishing Co. said.
   As a result of the closing, The News and Observer will have
later deadlines, allowing publication of more up-to-date news and
sports stories, the publishing company said.
   Raleigh is the fourth major North Carolina city to lose an
afternoon daily. Afternoon dailies, all sister papers of morning
publications, have closed in Charlotte, Greensboro and
Winston-Salem in the 1980s.
   The circulation of The Times soared then plummeted during the 34
years of ownership by The News and Observer Publishing Co. The
Times had 15,000 subscribers when it was bought in 1955 from the
Park family of Raleigh. Circulation peaked at 35,000 in 1984 but
dropped after news staffs of the two papers were combined in 1987.
Circulation has since fallen to 18,000.
   Frank Daniels Jr., president of the publishing company, had
announced the closing Oct. 2.
   The Raleigh Times traces itself back to 1879 with the founding
of The Raleigh Evening Visitor, which went through various name
changes until 1901.

   A Soviet official on Thursday denied an accusation
by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III that Moscow has
broken its promise to see that no Soviet-made arms reach Salvadoran
rebels.
   Baker said Wednesday that President Bush would complain about
the matter when he meets with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
during their summit off Malta.
   Baker said the Soviets have promised to prevent Marxist
Nicaragua from shipping Soviet arms to rebels fighting the
U.S.-backed government in El Salvador, but that the pratice
continues.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, who was
in Rome for Gorbachev's three-day visit to Italy, reiterated the
Kremlin's insistance that it does not supply arms for Central
American conflicts.
   Responding to questions about the White House complaints,
Gerasimov said: ``We don't supply Salvadoran rebels.''
   ``You must believe us,'' Gerasimov said, adding the Soviets
understand that their allies in the region, Cuba and Nicaragua,
also ``are not sending arms'' to El Salvador.
   Gerasimov said Bush and Gorbachev could discuss the dispute,
which he described as involving a ``discrepancy in information.''

   A Marine captain drilled the honor
guard in crisp salutes while sailors scrubbed and painted the USS
Belknap Thursday for President Bush's shipboard summit with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The almost 600-member crew aboard the guided missile cruiser
worked around visiting reporters and a tour of Soviet sailors and
officers to spruce up the Belknap and prepare its rooms for the
heads of state.
   ``Of course the real importance of this visit is not the ship
itself, but the president of the Soviet Union and the president of
the United States meeting on this ship,'' said Capt. John Sigler,
the commander of the Belknap.
   ``We feel very honored to be a part of this hopefully very
historic moment,'' he added.
   When Bush, a former Navy aviator, first steps off a helicopter
onto the deck of the Belknap, he'll be able to see a hand-lettered
``Beat Army'' poster pasted to a bulkhead.
   Bush will sleep in the quarters of Vice Adm. J.D. Williams, the
6th Fleet commander, meet privately with Gorbachev in the admiral's
small dining room and be host for a state dinner prepared by White
House chefs in the crowded confines of the officer's mess.
   The Belknap is anchored a few hundred yards behind the Soviet
missile cruiser Slava, where Gorbachev will be host on Saturday for
talks with Bush in richly paneled wardrooms appointed with plush
furniture and oriental rugs.
   By comparison, the site of Saturday's state dinner in the
Belknap wardroom is spartan. The walls are white and wainscotted
with artificial paneling. A Soviet and American flag are displayed
below one porthole. Two tables, one seating 20 and the other 10,
are crowded into the room along with a large milk cooler that can
be hidden with a navy blue curtain.
   Sigler, who was to visit the Slava later Thursday, said he had
heard the Soviet warship had more creature comforts.
   ``I heard they have a sauna for example,'' he said.
   ``I think we are comfortable,'' he added. ``I don't feel at a
disadvantage, I just think there is perhaps a different emphasis
here than there.''
   There are other, more obvious differences between the two ships.
   The Slava is 17 years younger than the 25-year-old Belknap,
slightly longer and its decks are bristling with arms. There are 16
surface-to-surface missile tubes on the Soviet cruiser, compared to
just four on the American ship.
   ``It's a beautiful ship,'' Sigler said of the Slava. ``Of course
it is much newer than my ship and the Soviets tend to have most of
their weapons topside, where we have most of ours below decks. The
result is that she looks heavily armed. I think our capabilities
are very similar in a lot of ways. But she certainly looks
imposing.''
   Bush's quarters aboard the Belknap are small and cramped. The
blue-carpeted cabin has just about 20 square feet of floor space, a
double bed, a gold recliner and a Toshiba color television with
Fisher VHS and Sony Beta videotape players.
   From his porthole on the starboard side, the president will have
a view of the St. Luciano Watchtower, a 16th Century castle built
by the Knights of Malta on a jagged cliff that juts into Marsaxlokk
Bay at the point closest to the American and Soviet warships.
   The president also will use the admiral's office, which is
dominated by a large wooden desk on which sits a Christmas card
addressed to Bush from Emily Shewchuk, the 7-year-old daughter of
one of the Belknap's officers. Gorbachev will be given a holding
room in the chief of staff's office.
   Bush's cabin and office are one flight up a steep metal ladder
from the main deck and just steps away from the admiral's mess
where the two leaders will meet with just two interpreters and two
people to take notes.
   Bush and Gorbachev will deliver their joint statement at the end
of the summit Sunday on the Belknap's forecastle, standing beneath
the launchers for the cruiser's surface-to-air missiles.
   Earlier Sunday, Bush will attend a non-denominational Protestant
church service at the same site.
   ``I am very nervous, very nervous,'' said Lt. David Schwabauer,
a Presbyterian minister who is the ship's chaplain. ``The thought
of preaching to the president of the United States is terrifying.''

<HEAD>List of Chinese Military Strategists Includes Lin Biao</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A list published Thursday of Chinese ``military
strategists'' includes Lin Biao, the disgraced defense minister who
died in a mysterious plane crash after allegedly plotting a coup
against Mao Tse-tung.
   The list, published in the official Communist Party newspaper
People's Daily, also includes Mao, China's revolutionary founder;
the late premier Chou En-lai; current senior leader Deng Xiaoping;
President Yang Shangkun; and retired President Li Xiannian.
   According to official Chinese accounts, Lin died in September
1971 in a plane crash in Mongolia as he was trying to flee to the
Soviet Union after an unsuccessful plot to assassinate Mao.
   The Chinese version says the plane ran out of gas, but other
reports say Lin had been shot before the plane went down, leading
to speculation of a gun battle aboard the plane.
   A manuscript smuggled out of China was published under a
pseudonym in the United States in 1983 alleging that Lin and his
wife were lured to a villa outside Beijing and killed.
   The People's Daily listed the names, adding ``And there was Lin
Biao'' without elaborating.
   Chinese historians credit Lin with being an outstanding military
commander.
   Lin, who was one of only 10 military officers with the rank of
marshal, was included in a book on the People's Liberation Army
published in China in 1987. While the book said he was head of the
``Lin Biao Counterrevolutionary Clique,'' it also noted his
positive role in Chinese history.
   He also appeared in the movie ``Grand Ceremony Establishing the
Country,'' released this year to mark the 40th anniversary of the
founding of Communist China.

   A fire that damaged the home of a
legislator who had tried to keep a state university from putting on
a play about AIDS and homosexuality was declared accidental today.
   Fireplace embers dumped in the back yard Wednesday night by one
of Jean Dixon's children ignited leaves and scrap wood and spread
to the state representative's home, Chief Fire Marshal Dale Bittle
said.
   Arson investigators had been called in to determine whether the
fire was set, like a blaze on Nov. 15 that destroyed the home of a
student who had led a campaign in support of the play, Larry
Kramer's ``The Normal Heart.''
   Fire Chief Phil Johnston estimated damage Dixon's home at $5,000
to $10,000, mostly involving the attic and exterior. There were no
injuries.
   Dixon and her husband were away at the time, but five Dixon
children ranging from 7 to 20 years old were at home with an adult
friend, the fire chief said. A neighbor discovered the fire about
12:40 a.m. and alerted those inside, who included three sleeping
children.
   Dixon, a Republican, was among the most vocal opponents of a
presentation of ``The Normal Heart'' at Southwest Missouri State
University on Nov. 15-20. She objected to use of a public facility
for a play that presents homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle.
   Kramer and his supporters accused her of censorship and said the
play, which quickly sold out amid the controversy, helped educate
students about AIDS.
   The night the play opened, someone apparently set a fire at the
home of Brad Evans, 22, after forcing open a back door,
investigators said. Evans was leading a candlelight ceremony in
support of the play when the fire occurred.

<TEXT>
   Reduced levels of an important protein
molecule may play a role in the collapse of the immune system in
patients infected with the AIDS virus, according to a study at the
National Institutes of Health.
   Dr. Ronald G. Crystal, a researcher at the National Heart, Lung
and Blood Institute, one of the NIH agencies, said a deficit of
glutathione was found in a group patients infected with the AIDS
virus and he suggests that this ``may be one clue about why the
immune dysfunction occurs'' in victims of the disease.
   In a study to be published Friday in the British medical journal
Lancet, Crystal and seven other researchers report that they
measured the levels of glutathione in the blood and lung fluids of
14 patients infected with the AIDS virus and compared the results
with studies of 19 patients not infected with AIDS.
   Crystal said that patients who were ``seropositive,'' or
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes
AIDS, had glutathione levels reduced by one-third to one-half of
what is normal.
   ``What we found is that the glutachione level in seropositive
people was low, suggesting a systemic deficiency of glutathione,''
said the researcher.
   The patients in the study infected with HIV had normal levels of
lymphocytes, a disease-fighting white blood cell attacked by the
AIDS virus, and their disease had not progressed to full-blown AIDS.
   Crystal said glutathione is a common protein molecule whose
precise function in the body is not known, but earlier research has
proven that it is important in the body's shield against infection.
   ``It seems to play an important role in allowing the immune
system to function normally,'' said Crystal. ``Nobody knows why or
how, but ... the immune system does better when glutathione is
around. There's a lot of evidence of that.''
   A deficiency of glutathione, he said, may be a clue in a medical
mystery that has puzzled AIDS researchers for years.
   Crystal said that early in the course of an AIDS virus
infection, there ``clearly is immune dysfunction,'' but, yet, there
typically are very, very few cells that are actually infected with
HIV. How the disease could compromise the immune system with so few
``soldiers'' attacking the body's cells has been one of the
unanswered questions about AIDS, he said.
   ``There has got to be ways that the (HIV) infection amplifies
itself in terms of its effect on the body,'' said Crystal. ``This
(the glutathione deficiency) may be one clue about why the immune
dysfunction occurs.''
   The scientist emphasized that finding the exact role that
reduced glutathione plays in the course of an AIDS virus infection
will require a great deal more research before there could be any
clinical application.
   ``We are evaluating the very important question of whether this
glutathione deficiency is relevant ... or does it have nothing to
do with (immune dysfunction)? That is a possibility,'' said Crystal.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, leaving it unable to
resist other infections. HIV, which causes AIDS, is spread most
often through sexual relations, through contact with blood or blood
products, such as by sharing needles, or from mother to child
during the birth process.
   As of Sept. 30, AIDS had been diagnosed in 109,167 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 64,849, have died since June 1, 1981,
according to the Centers for Disease Control. No one is known to
have recovered from AIDS.

<HEAD>Passions Flare in Caucasus Over Legislative Resolution</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Armenians rallied Thursday in
Yerevan and demanded that their lawmakers defy Moscow by declaring
the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region part of a ``unified Armenian
republic,'' local journalists said.
   Unconfirmed reports from the Caucasus region in the southern
part of the Soviet Union said as many as three people were killed
in violence stemming from the sovereignty quarrel over the
predominantly Armenian district inside the neighboring republic of
Azerbaijan, adding to a 22-month toll of about 100 deaths.
   In Moscow, the Soviet legislature on Tuesday overwhelmingly
approved a resolution disbanding a special commission that had
imposed direct Kremlin rule on the hilly region of 160,000 people,
which was made part of Azerbaijan in 1923 despite its overwhelming
Armenian majority.
   The resolution passed by the Soviet legislature says the area is
part of Azerbaijan, as provided in the 1977 Soviet Constitution,
and will now be controlled by local government bodies under the
supervision of an all-union commission.
   Instead of calming the situation, the Supreme Soviet's
resolution exacerbated it, a government spokesman said.
   ``One has to regret that passions are flying high and the people
do not understand the very meaning, the very sense, of what this
decision contains,'' Foreign Ministry Yuri A. Gremitskikh said in
Moscow.
   In Yerevan, Armenia's capital, the republic's Supreme Soviet
legislature and lawmakers from Nagorno-Karabakh met in a special
session to debate the Moscow legislature's resolution, said Armen
Dulyan, a spokesman for the republic's official Armenpress news
agency.
   Levon Ter-Petrosyan, a member of the Soviet Congress of People's
Deputies, presented a draft resolution that would declare
Nagorno-Karabakh part of a ``unified Armenian republic,'' Dulyan
said.
   Nagorno-Karabakh's Armenian population, supported by Armenia,
has demanded that it be annexed to Armenia because of what it calls
years of willful neglect by Azerbaijani authorities.
   ``The unified Armenian republic will take all necessary measures
to defend Nagorno-Karabakh and its citizens from all outside
encroachments, as part of the republic's territory,'' Dulyan quoted
the resolution introduced by Ter-Petrosyan as saying.
   Speaking by telephone from Yerevan, Dulyan said a ``massive
crowd'' of tens of thousands of Armenians rallied outside Yerevan's
House of Political Education, where the lawmakers were meeting, to
demand the resolution be adopted.
   After hours of heated debate, the lawmakers voted to establish a
commission to work through the night to draft a response to the
Moscow-based Supreme Soviet's resolution, the Armenpress journalist
said.
   In Azerbaijan, businesses are reported to be on strike and
freight trains bound for Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia to be idled
as Azerbaijanis express displeasure with the resolution.
   Savili A. Perets, deputy director of Azerbaijan's official news
agency Azerinform, said some Azerbaijanis believe the observer
commission encroaches on their republic's sovereignty and that the
resolution's provision barring changes in Nagorno-Karabakh's
demographics means Azerbaijani women cannot give birth in the
region.
   Speaking by telephone from Azerbaijan's capital of Baku, Perets
said he had received unofficial reports of three people killed
Tuesday in attacks related to the dispute. He could not provide
details of the incidents.
   In Yerevan, Dulyan said Armenpress had received news of only one
death, that of a police major shot and killed on the
Armenia-Azerbaijan border near the Armenian town of Goris. Two
Armenian civilians also were seriously wounded by the unidentified
gunman, who fled, he said.
   Activists from both sides said a general strike was under way in
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Officials of the special administrative commission have
acknowledged that despite the presence of Interior Ministry
soldiers, a virtual civil war has raged.

   Masked Palestinians Thursday axed a fellow Arab
to death as an alleged collaborator, then discovered they killed
the wrong man and declared him a ``martyr'' of their uprising, Arab
reporters said.
   Shops and businesses in Arab east Jerusalem closed to protest
the deaths of two brothers who were shot and killed by soldiers
Wednesday night for throwing stones at Israeli cars.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, 12 Palestinians were shot and
wounded by Israeli soldiers in stone-throwing clashes, hospital
officials said.
   The suspected collaborator was killed in Beit Iba, a village of
about 2,000 people near Nablus in the occupied West Bank.
   Witnesses said seven Palestinians wearing mourning dress and
checkered Arab scarves over their faces later marched through the
village and announced on loudspeakers they had killed the wrong man.
   Arab reporters said the attackers also warned that they were
still seeking the collaborator. The slain man was identified as
Mamoun Ali Al-Masri, 18.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   It confirmed the death Thursday of a suspected collaborator who
was injured three days earlier in a firebomb attack. Hospital
officials identified him as Ribhi Ibrahim Bader, 33, of the West
Bank village of Beit Liqya.
   The deaths raised to at least 153 the number of Palestinians
killed by fellow Arabs in the uprising against Israeli rule of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. Most were suspected of collaboration or
of drug dealing or prostitution.
   Israeli soldiers and civilians have killed 617 Palestinians
since the start of the revolt, and 42 Israelis have died in the
violence.
   The deaths of the brothers Wednesday night set off a strike in
Arab east Jerusalem that merchants said would last for at least two
days.
   Samir Hamouri, 20, and Nidal Hamouri, 19, were buried Thursday
at a family service in a Jerusalem cemetery.
   Another Hamouri brother, Khaled, said Samir had been hit three
times in the chest and that Nidal was struck ``by even more
bullets.''
   The army said the brothers were among a group of masked youths
who climbed a hill on the outskirts of Jerusalem and threw rocks at
passing Israeli cars.
   A patrol ``ordered them to stop and fired in the air,'' the army
spokesman's office said. ``When they didn't stop they shot in their
direction.''
   Several youths escaped, the army said.
   More than a dozen Palestinians have been fatally shot by Israeli
soldiers since mid-September, when the army changed orders to allow
troops to fire on masked Arabs who flee, even if they are not armed.
   An Israeli court in Lod on Thursday sentenced a Palestinian man
to 17 years in jail for commanding a squad that threw three
firebombs. He was identified as Hani Aouni Jaber, 30, of Beit
Hanina near Jerusalem.
   One of the bombs was tossed at a car and a woman inside was
seriously burned.

<HEAD>Environmental Concerns Will Figure Heavily in New Farm Bill, EPA

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Environmental Protection Agency official
said Thursday that environmental concerns will play a key role in
the 1990 farm bill.
   F. Henry Habicht, the EPA's deputy administrator, told an
agriculture conference that his agency has been working with
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter to work out proposals for the
legislation, which will set farm policy for several years.
   He commended agricultural officials for a ``visionary view'' in
response to public concerns about pesticides and food safety.
   ``Farmers were the first environmentalists,'' said Habicht. He
said encouraging farmers to use wise environmental methods is not
``an attitude issue, but an information issue.''
   Agriculture Deputy Secretary Jack Parnell, who appeared with
Habicht, took a hard line toward food safety questions raised by
environmental organizations.
   ``Do not be afraid of your critics ... or their noise,'' he told
the participants at the closing program of Outlook '90, a three-day
conference sponsored by the Agriculture Department.
   He said that technology has made American agriculture the most
successful in the world, partly through use of chemicals.
   He cautioned against ``those who would like to tear down and
destroy by quoting half truths from pseudo-scientists.''
   He said breakthroughs in science have enabled researchers to
detect chemical residues in food in much smaller quantities than
ever before.
   He questioned whether ingestion of a one part per trillion of a
particular residue over a 70-year lifetime should be legislated
against.
   ``Don't allow policy to move ahead of science or common sense,''
he said.
   He said he does support speedy removal from the market of
chemicals that have been determined hazardous to health and hailed
President Bush's legislative proposals for streamlining laws that
do just that.
   ``When the United States sits down to supper, it should expect a
wholesome supper with the safest food in the world,'' Parnell said.
   Dr. Frank Young, outgoing commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration, also questioned the need to be concerned about
minute quantities of chemical residues in food.
   ``In the 1960's and 70's, we began to identify compounds that
might cause cancer,'' he said. ``But we could only identify one
part per 1,000 or one part per 10,000.
   Today, scientists can detect one part per trillion or one part
per million trillion, he said.
   That ability has allowed residue to be detected that could not
be found before but is not necessarily harmful to health, he said.
   ``We must be very careful that the nation's health or economy
does not fall prey to self-appointed priests of demagoguery,'' said
Young.
   Habicht acknowledged the farmer's central role in the American
economy and said his agency has no interest in retarding
agricultural productivity.
   But he said that, ``for the past 20 years, we've been
identifying problems and scrambling to clean up.''
   He said the policies of the future must be preventive.

   Denver's new airport could someday have a home
where the buffalo roam. The deer and the antelope already play
there.
   Landscape architects for the Denver International Airport
opening by 1993 would like to introduce Great Plains buffalo to
grazing areas along the 12-mile Airport Boulevard corridor to give
travelers the flavor of the Wild West.
   Prairie grasses and other plants would be planted to nurture the
herds of deer and antelope traipsing through the creek beds and
farmland on the 50-square-mile site.
   ``It would have a tremendous impact on the incoming passenger,''
Dick Marshall of DHM Inc. landscapers. Marshall's company is part
of a joint venture being paid $1 million to plan flora and fauna
for the $3 billion-plus airport.
   The buffalo would be fenced in, much like the herd that grazes
along Interstate 70 west of Denver, to keep them away from the busy
route.
   The fences would be at the bottom of road embankments to ensure
good wildlife viewing and allow the animals to come as close to
travelers as possible.
   Marshall's team also wants to plant and populated the corridor
with everything from foothills pine trees to bald eagles, and
landscape the terminal itself with greenery to promote the image of
an oasis on the Plains.

   John Casey won the 1989 National Book Award for
fiction for ``Spartina,'' while correspondent Thomas L. Friedman of
The New York Times won the non-fiction medal for ``From Beirut to
Jerusalem.''
   Among other honors bestowed Wednesday evening, the second annual
National Book Award for Distinguished Contribution to American
Letters was presented to Librarian of Congress Emeritus Daniel J.
Boorstin. The $10,000 prize is given for lifelong contributions to
American letters that have an extraordinary and permanent impact on
American literature.
   ``Spartina,'' published by Knopf, is a study of the ties that
bind Dick Pierce _ a fisherman, father and lover _ to his wife, his
mistress, his sons, his community and his boat.
   ``Thank goodness these five judges were in the mood, because
that's what it is, they were in the mood for my book,'' the
Worcester, Mass.-born Casey said at a news conference. ``It's like
a date when you read a book. Some of them go well, some of them
don't go well, so I just lucked out.''
   Casey, born in 1939, said he is already working on two other
books that will complete a trilogy. He is a professor at the
University of Virginia, where he teaches English literature and
creative writing.
   ``From Beirut to Jerusalem,'' published by Farrar, Straus and
Giroux, is Friedman's account of the Middle East conflict as seen
from the two cities.
   Friedman, born in Minneapolis in 1953, said he became interested
in the Middle East at 15 when a trip with his parents to Jerusalem
changed his life.
   ``I discovered I was quite at home in Jerusalem. ... I was
definitely more Middle East than Minnesota,'' Friedman said.
   Friedman, now the Times' chief diplomatic correspondent, was
asked if he would ever return to Beirut.
   ``I certainly won't be going back until Terry Anderson is
freed,'' he said. Anderson, an Associated Press correspondent, was
kidnapped in Beirut in 1985.
   Friedman twice has won the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting from
the Middle East for the Times.
   The non-profit National Book Foundation sponsors the awards.
   The other finalists for fiction included Katherine Dunn, whose
``Geek Love'' tells of four genetically altered siblings bred by
their parents to perform in a freak show.
   E.L. Doctorow, who won the fiction award in 1986 for ``World's
Fair,'' was a finalist this year for ``Billy Bathgate,'' about a
15-year-old boy's apprenticeship to notorious mobster Dutch Schultz.
   Oscar Hijuelos was a finalist for his ``The Mambo Kings Play
Songs of Love,'' a portrait of two brothers from Havana who find
some fame in New York's nightclubs.
   Finalist Amy Tan was cited for her first novel, ``The Joy Luck
Club,'' in which four Chinese friends in San Francisco meet weekly
to play mah-jongg and talk about themselves, their ancestors and
their American-born daughters.
   For non-fiction, the other finalists were Taylor Branch, for
``Parting the Waters,'' the first volume of his history of the U.S.
civil rights movement in the 1950s and '60s; McGeorge Bundy, for
``Danger and Survival: Choices About the Bomb in the First Fifty
Years,'' a political history of the nuclear bomb; William Pfaff,
for `Barbarian Sentiments: How the American Century Ends,'' an
analysis of American foreign policy since World War II; and
Marilynne Robinson, for ``Mother Country,'' an investigation of
environmental policies in Great Britain.
   The National Book Awards were established in 1950 to recognize
American literary works of exceptional merit.
   Each winner receives a $10,000 prize and a commemorative medal;
finalists get $1,000 each.
   Publishers this year submitted a record 325 books. Entries must
have been written by U.S. citizens and published in the United
States between Nov. 1, 1988, and Nov. 1, 1989.

<HEAD>Opening of East Bloc May Shed New Light on Holocaust</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liberalization in the Communist bloc is
providing an unexpected opportunity for historians to examine
long-hidden documents on Nazi Germany's extermination of European
Jewry.
   Tens of thousands of documents from East Germany and others
expected from the Soviet Union may answer such central questions as
how many Jews really died, which could be more than the accepted 6
million, researchers said Thursday.
   Despite four decades of scholarship on the Holocaust, the
unavailability of Eastern accounts has left gaping holes in
knowledge about the World War II slaughter, said Shmuel Krakowsky,
head archivist at Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial.
   The largest mystery has been the fate of Soviet Jews: how many
were killed, how they died and where they died.
   ``We have never been able to compile final figures of how many
died. It could be that far fewer succeeded in escaping executions
than we imagined,'' Krakowsky said.
   Himself a survivor of the Lodz Ghetto in wartime Poland,
Krakowsky is in charge of reviewing 50,000 pages of East German
documents, about a third of which were brought to Jerusalem this
week by archivists from Berlin.
   The documents have arrived in advance of a cooperation agreement
that Israeli and East German researchers are scheduled to sign
Monday. Krakowsky said he scanned some of the information while on
a visit to East Germany in 1988.
   In September, Krakowsky and Yad Vashem's director Yitzhak Arad
spent three weeks studying thousands of pages of newly available
Holocaust documents in Moscow, Leningrad, Minsk, Odessa and Kiev.
   The material in the Soviet and German archives suggested new
directions in investigating how the Nazis operated in the Soviet
Union, Krakowsky said.
   ``We were astounded to read of documented persecutions, names
and places we hadn't been aware of,'' he said. ``It adds a lot to
our information about the Holocaust. Until now knowledge of the
fate of Soviet Jewry in the war has been scant.''
   Mordechai Altshuler, an expert on the Soviet Union at
Jerusalem's Hebrew University, said the documents may establish a
firmer figure on deaths than the current range of 1.25 million to
1.8 million.
   Altshuler said this could affect the overall estimte of 6
million dead. ``More material on the subject could change the
picture one way or the other,'' he said.
   Krakowsky said it was premature to make a new estimate, but
added he believed the death toll could be larger than believed.
   ``We saw names of death sites we hadn't seen before and lists of
names,'' he said.
   Another question raised is what kind of extermination methods
the Nazis used in the Soviet Union and what role local
collaborators were given, Krakowsky said.
   Until now it was believed that Russian Jewry perished mostly at
the hands of German firing squads known as Einsatzgruppen who mowed
them down at the edge of huge dirt pits in the initial stages of
the war.
   ``It seems the process (in the Soviet Union) may have been
lengthier, with a wider use of gathering Jews first in ghettos and
hiring local police to do some of the killing,'' Krakowsky said.
   He noted that some Soviet documents indicate there were more
sites for rounding up Jews in towns and cities than previously
thought.
   Karkowsky cited the town of Homel in Byelorussia where
historians believed the Germans had organized one Jewish ghetto.
New documents showed there were four ghettoes, suggesting more Jews
may have been killed there than believed, he said.
   East German documents also may shed light on Nazi theoretician
Alfred Rosenberg, who was in charge of destroying synagogues, and
on the shadowy alliance between Hitler and Jerusalem's late Moslem
Mufti, Haj Amin El Husseini, Krakowsky said.
   Czechoslovakia also has begun contributing to knowledge of the
Holocaust by agreeing to send an exhibition of wartime Judaic
relics from Prague to the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.
   The items scheduled for display next April are ``part of an
enormous collection that the Nazis had amassed for a memorial to an
extinguished people,'' according to museum director Meir Meir.

<TEXT>
   The Energy Department today said it is suspending
some plutonium operations at Rocky Flats while a new contractor
takes over at the weapons plant, which is under FBI investigation
for alleged safety violations.
   Catherine Kaliniak, an Energy Department spokeswoman in
Washington, said a ``major curtailment'' of plutonium operations at
the plant will be completed sometime next week. The plant makes
plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons.
   Kaliniak would not disclose how many plutonium operations will
continue, saying that was classified information.
   Last year the plant was shut down temporarily after a safety
violation. The move came amid a rash of safety and management
problems, interruptions and shutdowns at the 16 major facilities in
12 states involved in making nuclear weapons.
   Kaliniak said the Rocky Flats suspension had nothing to do with
safety concerns, and David P. Simonson, manager of the Energy
Department office at Rocky Flats, said the move is part of the
process by which EG&amp;G Inc. is taking over from Rockwell
International Corp. as operator of the plant 16 miles northwest of
Denver.
   ``The department is using this transition period to work with
EG&amp;G to establish a formal, structured program for the resumption
of nuclear facility operations,'' Simonson said. ``The program now
under development with EG&amp;G will ensure that future operations are
governed by the highest standards of performance.''
   Rep. David Skaggs, D-Colo., had announced Wednesday that he
asked Energy Secretary James Watkins in a Nov. 16 letter to halt
production at Rocky Flats. Hours later, Simonson said the plant was
already in the midst of a production curtailment that was scheduled
in August, began Nov. 13 and would continue through mid-January.
   Skaggs, whose district includes the plant, said later Wednesday
that the curtailment ``falls far short of what I have called for.''
   Skaggs said an Energy Department report last month indicated
only luck has prevented a serious accident at Rocky Flats. He said
the report concluded the fail-safe system at the plant is flawed
and does not follow accepted nuclear industry standards and that
the plant does not have adequate control over its plutonium stock.
   Simonson maintained that Watkins has ordered ``essentially all
the recommendations mentioned by Congressman Skaggs in his Nov. 16
letter.''
   FBI agents earlier this year raided Rocky Flats for evidence of
safety and environmental violations.
   Gov. Roy Romer said Watkins would visit Rocky Flats on Friday
and make more information available on the plant's safety. Ms.
Kaliniak said she could not confirm that Watkins was even
considering such a visit.
   On a related issue, Romer and Skaggs say they have concluded
there were no illegal midnight burnings of toxic waste inside a
top-secret building at the plant.
   The allegation, denied for months by Rockwell and the Energy
Department, surfaced in an affidavit the FBI filed to support
search warrants for a June 6 raid on the plant.

   Government officials will receive the Dalai
Lama after he accepts the Nobel Peace Prize, despite angry demands
from China that Tibet's exiled religious leader be ignored, news
reports said Thursday.
   The Buddhist monk has led a nearly 40-year non-violent struggle
to free Tibet from Chinese occupation.
   He will meet privately with Prime Minister Jan P. Syse and
Foreign Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik on Dec. 11, one day after the
ceremony, according to the national news agency NTB.
   Last year, the government snubbed the Dalai Lama during a visit
because of diplomatic pressure from China.
   China condemned the Norwegian Nobel Committee's Oct. 4
announcement that the Peace Prize had gone to the Dalai Lama, and
accused Norway of interfering in China's internal affairs.
   Beijing later threatened economic sanctions against Norway if
the Dalai Lama was received officially, Norwegian reports said.
   ``It's a well established tradition that any Peace Prize winner
who wants to meet government officials may do so,'' said Janis
Bjoern Kanavin of Norway's foreign ministry.
   The Peace Prize winner ruled the isolated mountain kingdom until
Chinese troops moved in in 1950. He fled into exile in India with
about 100,000 followers in 1959.

<HEAD>Governor Wants Dolphins Released</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez has accused one of
the world's leading aquariums of illegally taking two bottlenose
dolphins from Tampa Bay, but aquarium officials say it's all a
misunderstanding.
   The governor directed officials Wednesday to find out if the
state can force release of the animals and to draft rules
restricting the capture and transportation of dolphins from Florida
waters.
   The National Aquarium in Baltimore did not have the correct
state permit when it moved two male dolphins captured Sunday in
Tampa Bay to a holding facility at Marathon in the Florida Keys,
said officials with the state Department of Natural Resources.
   ``It was a breach of state law and worse yet, it flies in the
face of our efforts to protect these special mammals,'' Martinez
wrote in his letter to DNR executive director Tom Gardner. Gardner
said he has asked his attorneys to investigate the situation.
   Officials of the National Aquarium said the only problem was a
technical flaw in their permit.
   ``We've been so meticulous and careful about every single aspect
of the collection process,'' said aquarium spokeswoman Vicki
Aversa. ``It's just a shame that this kind of situation has to
happen.''
   State and federal officials said Jay Sweeney, a marine mammal
veterinarian, had a federal permit to capture up to three dolphins
anywhere along the Gulf Coast.
   But a state permit is needed to move the dolphins, and the
permit Sweeney obtained specified that he could transport dolphins
only from Charlotte Harbor in Lee County on Florida's southwest
coast.
   Sweeney moved the animals from Tampa Bay on Tuesday without
amending the permit, said Charles Futch, DNR's assistant director
of marine resources. Ms. Aversa said the capture site was moved to
Tampa Bay because of criticism raised over the plan to take
dolphins from the Charlotte Harbor Aquatic Preserve.
   Ms. Aversa added that Sweeney had been given verbal permission
by the DNR to move the mammals from Tampa Bay. There was no comment
from Sweeney; neither acquarium nor state officials knew where he
was Thursday.
   Ms. Aversa said the dolphins will stay at Marathon for most of
the winter unless the state forces the aquarium to release them.

   The Bush administration sharply criticized a
U.N. agency Thursday for strengthening its cooperation with the
Palestine Liberation Organization and denying a U.S. official the
agency's chairmanship.
   The State Department spokeswoman said that, in light of the
agency's actions, the United States was considering cutting off all
financial support for the Food and Agriculture Organization.
   At a meeting of the FAO's general conference in Rome, 96
countries voted for a resolution authorizing the agency to assist
agricultural development on the West Bank and in Gaza ``in close
cooperation'' with the PLO.
   The resolution accused Israel, which controls the territories,
of hampering economic development and denying land and water to
Palestinian residents.
   ``The outcome of the conference was unacceptable to us for a
number of reasons,'' State Department spokeswoman Margaret D.
Tutwiler said.
   She called the resolution ``extremely objectionable'' and
accused the FAO of lagging behind in reforming its procedures and
expanding its budget at the expense of the United States and a
handful of other countries that bear most of the costs.
   Ms. Tutwiler also said Dan Amstutz of the United States had been
denied his right under a rotation system to serve as chairman of
the FAO council.
   Referring to these actions, the spokeswoman said ``this brings
into serious question our funding of FAO. This is being seriously
discussed here today, but I am not prepared at this briefing to
make an announcement of what action or actions the United States
will be taking.''
   On another Mideast issue, Ms. Tutwiler said Egyptian Foreign
Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid had informed Secretary of State James
A. Baker III that he could not approve a U.S. proposal for setting
up negotiations between Israel and Palestinians.
   Egypt has been dealing with Baker in behalf of the PLO.
   Evidently, Meguid requested some unspecified changes in the U.S.
approach.
   But Ms. Tutwiler said any ``clarifications'' would be considered
only after Egypt gave its ``yes'' to the U.S. plan.
   The Israeli Cabinet earlier gave its approval, but also stated a
number of reservations. Its main concern is that the PLO not play a
role in the negotiations.
   The PLO, however, is recognized by all Arab countries as the
only legitimate representative of the Palestinians.

   A renegade CIA agent who defected to the
Soviet Union after allegedly passing secrets has been expelled from
Hungary, a newspaper reported today.
   It was not known where the defector, Edward Lee Howard, went
after his expulsion, the Los Angeles Times said.
   Howard, who eluded U.S. counterintelligence agents in New Mexico
in 1985, revealed to the Soviets the names of people and technical
equipment being used by the CIA.
   A U.S. official told the Times that federal authorities had been
trying to persuade Hungary to expel Howard for months. The
newspaper said the United States is stepping up its efforts to
apprehend Howard.
   ``Our argument was, `Here's this guy who cast his lot with the
Soviet Union but tried to avoid the hardships of Gulag socialism,'
'' the unidentified official was quoted as saying.
   Hungary revoked his asylum at least a month ago despite protests
by the KGB, the Soviet intelligence agency, according to a U.S.
government source quoted by the newspaper.
   Asked about the report, Hungarian Interior Ministry spokesman
Lt. Col. Janos Horvach said in a telephone interview, ``It's news
to me.''
   The U.S. Embassy said it had no immediate information on the
circumstances surrounding Howard's expulsion, and Soviet Embassy
spokesman Sergei Semyonov said, ``I regret but we know nothing
about such a man.''
   CIA Director William H. Webster made a veiled reference to
Howard's expulsion in a speech Wednesday at the National Press Club
in Washington.
   He was asked about cooperation between intelligence services of
East Bloc countries and the Soviets in light of the recent
political developments in Eastern Europe.
   Webster cited the case of ``a prominent defector from the United
States (who) was permanently expelled from a bloc country which had
provided him comfort and sanctuary in the past. And that would have
been contrary to the wishes of the KGB.''
   David Wise, author of a book documenting Howard's defection,
said Howard spent significant time in Hungary after defecting to
Moscow.
   ``It was a lot more Western _ the closest he could get to the
West,'' Wise said.
   Howard's wife, Mary, who lives in St. Paul, Minn., with the
couple's daughter, had spent up to three months with him in
Hungary, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
   This steel and coal town in
Moravia has always been a Communist Party stronghold, but even new
party leader Karel Urbanek's roots in the region aren't enough to
stem the quest for reform.
   The winds of change are strong even in this major industrial
center, although ``we are always days behind Prague,'' said Dusan
Kubat, a journalist and staunch supporter of the Civic Forum reform
movement.
   Civic Forum was a major force in the pro-democracy
demonstrations that led to the downfall of former party chief Milos
Jakes. He was replaced by Urbanek, who is from Bojkovice, a village
in southern Moravia.
   ``The situation is more complicated here,'' said Kubat, 30.
``People are more conservative. But I think most workers are
already with us.''
   Workers crowding a beer hall appeared to support his assessment.
   ``I am happy that the young ones started the fight,'' said
steelworker Josef Koukl. `` I am already 40 but I would like to
join them. Everybody who has a sense of justice should join them.''
   Stanislav Novak, a 40-year-old father of two, put down his glass
of plum brandy and nodded: ``I would like my children to live in a
better world.''
   The Civic Forum's call for a two-hour general strike Monday was
heeded by most plants here, with at least 20,000 workers taking to
the streets after sirens signaled the start.
   At the Zarubek coal mine, however, the management ``did not let
us gather and waited until the last moment before it allowed a
group of miners to come up to take part in the strike,'' said a
technician met at the gate, who refused to give his name.
   A rumor spread among miners before the strike that participants
would lose their Christmas bonus of up to $900.
   Miners draw up to three times the national worker's pay. Once
they work above ground, however, their wage is slashed
substantially unless they are diagnosed to be suffering from
silicosis. Complaints from their ranks that silicosis victims are
increasingly being refused full pay were cited as a factor
prompting the large miner participation in the strike.
   The local Communist Party organized a rally Wednesday on
Ostrava's People's Militia Square, at which traditional
overall-clad workers were noticeably absent.
   One speaker was worker Jaroslav Cahlik, who called on the Prague
government ``to immediately stop the talks'' with the opposition.
   The mostly middle-aged crowd of about 5,000, including a group
of army officers, broke into chants of ``Long live the Communist
Party. We are still here,'' while a group of about 100 younger
onlookers rose their arms in the ``victory'' sign of the opposition.
   ``They may still be here, but without power,'' said one
bystander.
   Alexandra Hnikova, a 29-year-old textile worker, joined in the
pro-party chants.
   ``I will be with the party no matter what happens,'' she said.
   ``Of course there have been mistakes, but that will change
now,'' she added after a brown-coated man whispered something into
her ear.
   Ostrava has a mining engineering college where students are on
an indefinite strike to press for the resignation of their rector,
an orthodox Communist. The strike is being led by a teacher of
Marxism-Leninism.
   Most of the mines in the region are no longer profitable but the
party has opposed shutting them down for fear of stirring
discontent. Their future is likely to figure in upcoming
discussions about economic reforms.
   ``I am afraid that the economic situation will become worse,''
said mechanic Ladislav Mlynar outside Ostrava's Hotel Atom as smoke
billowed from a nearby blast furnace.
   ``The changes are so fast,'' said passerby Ondreas Imrich. ``I
still fear that everything will end in a dead-end street again or
that it will be suppressed.''

<HEAD>Consumer Spending Falls to Lowest Level in Nearly Three Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer spending fell to its lowest level in
nearly three years in October, the government said Thursday, and
analysts said continued sluggishness in personal consumption is
likely to be a ``major drag'' on the economy in the fourth quarter.
   On the other hand, personal income rose a healthy 0.9 percent,
which analysts said indicates consumers still have spending power,
but are just waiting for bargains.
   ``It's not going to be a great Christmas in terms of shopping
and (retail) earnings,'' said Sandra Shaber, an economist with the
Futures Group, a Washington consulting firm. ``People will just
wait until things go on sale.''
   The Commerce Department said that spending, reflecting
plummeting auto sales in October, dropped 0.2 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.53 trillion after edging up
only 0.3 percent in September.
   It was the first decline in personal spending since a 0.1
percent drop in September 1988 and the steepest since a 1.4 percent
fall in January 1987.
   Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity and the spending report provided fresh evidence
that the economy is continuing to slow.
   ``Consumer spending is starting the fourth quarter on an
extremely weak note,'' said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey
G. Lanston &amp; Co. in New York. ``And since it represents two-thirds
of the gross national product, I think it will be a major drag on
the economy in the fourth quarter.''
   Income, on the other hand, totaled $4.51 trillion, reflecting
the largest advance since a 1 percent gain last March. It had risen
0.3 percent in September.
   The San Francisco Bay-area earthquake knocked $21 billion out of
the income figure at an annual rate, but that was partially offset
by other one-time ``special factors,'' including a $7.2 billion
increase in farm subsidies and $6.8 billion in bonuses to auto
industry employees.
   ``Excluding the impact of the special factors, personal income
increased about $33 billion, or 0.7 percent,'' the Commerce
Department said.
   Jones and Mrs. Shaber, while expecting a weak fourth-quarter
economy, said the report by itself does not indicate an imminent
recession.
   ``First, income numbers have been too strong to be consistent
with a recession,'' Mrs. Shaber said. ``And, on the other hand,
people are still spending ... they're just being very, very
cautious ... waiting for things to go on sale.''
   Jones agreed, saying that consumers still have buying power but
are ``more cautious, and they want to bargain.''
   Americans' incomes after taxes rose 0.9 percent, up from
September's 0.2 percent gain, Commerce said.
   Their savings rate, savings as a percent of disposable income,
rose to 5.7 percent, the highest since a 5.8 percent rate last June
and compared to September's 4.7 percent.
   The key component of the income category _ wages and salaries _
rose $33 billion, compared to a $17 billion gain in September.
   Payrolls at manufacturing companies rose by $6.8 billion, but
would have been flat except for the $6.8 billion in auto bonuses.
The manufacturing sector has been one of the hardest hit by Federal
Reserve efforts to fight inflation.
   On the spending side, the $6.1 billion decrease in personal
consumption, which includes everything except interest payments on
debt, compared to a $9.9 billion gain in September when incentives
drove auto sales up.
   Purchases of durable goods, big-ticket items expected to last
more than three years, dropped $28.2 billion, while non-durable
goods purchases rose $2.5 billion. Spending on services rose $20.2
billion.

<HEAD>Police Confirm Arrest of Ex-Detective in Slayings of White Activists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   A former narcotics detective
has been arrested in the assassinations of two prominent white
activists, one in South Africa and one in Namibia, police said
Thursday.
   Police headquarters refused to release the name of the
31-year-old suspect, saying it confirmed his arrest only after
newspapers reported it. An official statement said further arrests
in the slayings were possible.
   An evening news report on government-run TV said it was believed
police ``are looking at the possible existence of a private
assassination squad with strong right-wing links.''
   The suspect, a white former police sergeant, was arrested this
month in the killings of David Webster, a university lecturer and
human rights activist in Johannesburg, and Anton Lubowski, a lawyer
who was the only senior white official of Namibia's main
independence movement, the South-West Africa People's Organization.
   Both men were shot to death outside their homes; Webster on May
1 in Johannesburg and Lubowski on Sept. 12 in Windhoek, Namibia.
   The suspect had not been charged and was being held for
questioning under the provisions of security legislation that
allows for indefinite detention without access to visitors or
lawyers.
   The Star, a liberal Johannesburg daily, said the suspect's
father had filed an application demanding his son's release from a
Johannesburg police station cell, but later withdrew the request.
   Police said the suspect was discharged from the police force in
1984 after being sentenced to prison on charges of murder and
theft. He was convicted of killing a suspect in one of his
investigations as a narcotics officer for the West Rand, a region
west of Johannesburg.
   ``The person has been in detention for some time,'' police said.
``The police did not wish to announce his detention because this
would have jeopardized an investigation which still has to be
launched.''
   The national police force has come under widespread criticism
for its failure to solve the Webster murder and dozens of other
killings of anti-apartheid activists over the past 10 years.
   The arrest coincides with a government investigation into
allegations by former policemen that police death squads, acting on
orders from superiors, killed numerous government opponents.
   An Irish national, Donald Acheson, 51, was arrested in Namibia
the day after Lubowski was killed. He had been held as an illegal
immigrant, but on Nov. 6 was told he would be charged in the
slaying.
   Newspapers have reported that Acheson was taken to Johannesburg
for interrogation by authorities who fought the court application
for the ex-narcotics officer's release. Those authorities also are
investigating Webster's assassination.
   Also on Thursday:
   _ Scores of protesting black bakery workers in Pretoria
reportedly were injured and 200 arrested by riot police using tear
gas and clubs. Police said five officers were hurt by bread crates
hurled from rooftops.
   Hundreds of workers gathered at the Boerstra bakery in Pretoria
to protest working conditions. Neil Coleman, a spokesman for the
Congress of South African Trade Unions, said riot police attacked
the workers without provocation. Police said the protesters ignored
repeated warnings to disperse.
   _ Police in the impoverished township of Alexandra near
Johannesburg used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse 500
blacks protesting living conditions in their township. Four people
reportedly were arrested.
   _ Six anti-apartheid activists met with African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela and later said they did not believe
he would be freed from prison this year. Billy Nair, former Natal
province leader of the outlawed ANC military wing, did not comment
on the more prominent expectation that Mandela would be freed early
next year. President F.W. de Klerk said, ``The matter is receiving
attention. ... We will make an announcement when we are ready.''
   _ De Klerk prepared to travel to the Ivory Coast for a meeting
Friday with President Felix Houphouet-Boigny to discuss mutual
relations and the Angolan civil war. The two countries have no
formal diplomatic relations, but extensive trade ties.
Houphouet-Boigny condemns apartheid, South Africa's legal system of
racial separation, but criticizes as counterproductive sanctions to
force South Africa to give equal rights to its black majority.

<DATELINE>VALLETTA, Malta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Long experienced in dealing with
invaders, the Maltese are blocking off roads and mobilizing the
military _ and even the boy scouts _ to get ready for this
weekend's superpower summit. They're also churning out T-shirts.
   Prime Minister Edward Fenech Adami declared his island nation
set for the arrivals Friday of President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev for their talks aboard warships anchored in a
Maltese harbor.
   ``The arrangements have gone beautifully,'' Fenech Adami told a
news conference Thursday.
   Malta's entire 1,200-man military and most of its 1,000 police
officers have been assigned to security tasks for the meeting,
manning roadblocks and checkpoints and making round-the-clock
patrols on land and at sea.
   Even a shortage of tiny, wavable Soviet flags hasn't been enough
to hamper the preparations, said Eddie Stafrace, who reports
selling 160 American and Maltese flags a day from his little toy
store behind the Palace of the Grand Masters in Valletta.
   ``They never sent the Russian ones,'' Stafrace said of his
Italian suppliers. ``When Soviet sailors come ashore, they normally
don't have money and want to exchange. I traded for some pennants
with Gorbachev's face on them. But I've sold all them already.''
   The Maltese government has come up with enough large Soviet and
American flags to decorate the public buildings in Valletta, a
capital of steep narrow streets lined with ocher stone buildings.
   The stark, almost treeless setting could be mistaken for North
Africa, if it weren't for the Christmas decorations strung across
the main shopping streets in this heavily Roman Catholic country.
And the signs in the distinctive Maltese language, influenced by
Arabic, Italian, French and English. St. John Street, for instance,
becomes Triq San Gwann.
   At a shop around the corner from Triq San Gwann and just up from
the deep harbor, Joseph Civelli also had no Soviet flags, but was
making up for it with colorful T-shirts showing Bush and Gorbachev
floating along in separate fishing boats, shaking hands over the
water in front of a Maltese cross.
   ``The whole world is looking at Malta, I think. It's great,''
said Civelli. ``Tell your president to bring peace to the whole
world. We've suffered a lot from wars.''
   Malta's wars began thousands of years ago, with Greeks,
Etruscans, Carthaginians, Romans, Arabs and Normans among the
conquerors.
   In the 16th century, the knights of the Order of St. John _
later known as the Knights of Malta _ built the impressive
fortresses that still dominate Valletta's rocky skyline, and fought
off the Ottoman Turks.
   Napoleon eventually kicked out the Knights of Malta, then Lord
Nelson kicked out the French. Malta was still under British rule
through World War II, during which it survived ferocious bombing to
remain a key Allied outpost in the Mediterranean, just 58 miles
south of Sicily.
   Among the buildings badly damaged by German and Italian bombing
was the 16th century hospital of the Knights of Malta, now rebuilt
into a conference center. Its 530-foot-long Main Ward has been
lined with tables and telephones for the 2,000 journalists
accredited to cover the Gorbachev-Bush encounter from shore.
   Joining them are promoters of Maltese business opportunities
eager to take advantage of the sudden attention _ and a few dozen
khaki-clad scouts given the week off from school to run errands at
the center.
   The Soviet missile cruiser Slava and the USS Belknap, a guided
missile cruiser, are anchored in Marsaxlokk Bay, a harbor at the
southern tip of Malta, about a 30-minute drive from Valletta.
   Two small Maltese patrol boats sailed around the two warships
Thursday, making sure no pleasure boats wandered nearby.
   Troops were stationed at Marsaxlokk to ensure security on land,
and extra helicopter patrols of the area began Thursday, said Brig.
John Spiteri, commander of Malta's armed forces.
   Spiteri, in charge of security for the summit, said Maltese
officers began a thorough search of the airport Thursday in
cooperation with American and Soviet experts. Patrols also watch
the airport perimeter around the clock, he said.
   Some roads are already blocked to traffic, and more will be shut
through the weekend, forcing the Anglican Cathedral in Valletta to
cancel church services this Sunday.
   Still, hundreds of curious tourists and local people have
already made the trek to look out from a once-sleepy fishing
village at the ships bristling with armaments in the harbor.
   With many more rubberneckers expected Saturday and Sunday, the
Maltese government has lined up several local bands and scheduled
fireworks at Marsaxlokk to keep people occupied while they wait for
history to be made offshore.

<HEAD>Former Law Student Ruled Out as Suspect in Serial Murders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man once identified as a ``viable suspect'' in
the Green River serial killings is no longer a suspect, the
commander of a task force investigating the slayings said today.
   King County Police Capt. Robert Evans told KING-TV that records
removed from William Jay Stevens II's home and other information
gathered by detectives eliminated Stevens as a suspect.
   Stevens, 39, is in jail awaiting trial on federal firearms
charges involving guns found in a search of his and his parents'
homes in Spokane by the Green River Task Force and Spokane police.
   Stevens, who was arrested in January, was investigated in
connection with the deaths and disappearances of 49 women, most of
them prostitutes, who vanished from 1982 to 1984, mostly in the
Seattle area. The case, named for the river where the first five
victims were found, is the worst known, unsolved serial murder case
in the nation.
   An affidavit filed by the task force to obtain the search
warrant identified Stevens as a ``viable suspect'' in the Green
River slayings.
   Stevens was never charged with any of the killings and has said
he is innocent.
   The search of Stevens' and his parents' homes uncovered guns,
boxes of pornographic tapes, police paraphernalia and uniforms, and
credit card records that helped investigators trace Stevens'
travels.
   They also found a car equipped much like a police cruiser. Green
River investigators have speculated that the Green River killer
posed as a police officer to trap his victims.
   Stevens was indicted in October on charges of being a felon in
possession of a firearm. Stevens, a former law student at Gonzaga
University in Spokane, had escaped from a work-release center in
1981 while serving time for a 1979 burglary at a police equipment
supply company.

<HEAD>States Reap $1.4 Billion Windfall as U.S. Forgives Penalties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California and New York are the biggest
winners, but all states will reap dividends from a decision by
Congress forgiving $1.4 billion in hotly-contested federal
penalties under a huge family aid program.
   The penalties were owed by all 50 states because of alleged
overpayments to beneficiaries under Aid to Families With Dependent
Children, the federal-state welfare program for children who lack
parental financial support.
   About 3.7 million families receive AFDC, the nation's largest
cash assistance program.
   The biggest penalty to be wiped out belonged to California _
$308.7 million, according to Federal Funds Information For States,
a research group. New York owed $285.9 million, Michigan $134.0
million and Ohio $104.6 million.
   No state had avoided the penalties, although South Dakota owed a
just $13,000 and Nevada owed $18,000.
   Forgiving the debts and reforming the way states are penalized
for overpayments ``is extremely significant,'' said Alicia Pelrine
of the National Governors' Association. ``This is something we've
been pushing for for years. It's a tough, technical, gut-it-out
issue,'' she said.
   ``We were delightfully surprised,'' said Jerry Friedman, deputy
secretary for income maintenance at the Department of Public
Welfare of Pennsylvania, which owed $92.3 million.
   ``Obviously if we were forced to pay up, it would have made our
system hemorrhage. It would have been disastrous,'' Friedman said.
He said the state had been preparing to challenge the debt in court.
   The $1.4 billion is an estimate that includes only state
overpayments made from the 1981 through the 1987 fiscal years. When
figures for the 1988 and 1989 fiscal years are totaled, the amount
of forgiveness could run as high as $2.2 billion, according to the
Office of Management and Budget.
   The AFDC amnesty provision was contained in a $14.7 billion
budget bill passed by both houses of Congress last week in the rush
to adjourn before Thanksgiving.
   OMB had backed a cheaper AFDC plan that did not include a full
waiver of states' obligations, according to OMB spokeswoman Delores
Spitznagel. Still, she said, the budget measure is expected to be
signed by the president.
   The revenue losses caused by the amnesty plan are more than
offset in the measure by dozens of deficit-reduction provisions,
including the extension into February of spending cuts imposed in
October under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
   The issue of AFDC overpayments has long caused rancor between
states and the federal government.
   Since federal money is involved, the government monitors the
program and assesses penalties when states accidentally make
overpayments to beneficiaries or grant aid to people who do not
qualify.
   Under program regulations in effect since 1983, any state with
an error rate of 3 percent or above is subject to penalties and
interest.
   But states have long held that the 3 percent ``tolerance level''
is arbitrary and ignores the realities of administering the program.
   States cite compliance figures showing that 41 states could not
manage error rates of less than 3 percent in any year during the
period.
   The new program enacted by Congress eliminates the 3 percent
error rate, replacing it with a 4 percent figure or the national
average, whichever is higher. Penalties would be assessed on a
sliding scale reflecting the degree to which a state's errors
exceed the national rate.
   David Siegel, a spokesman for the Family Support Administration,
the division of the Department of Health and Human Services that
oversees AFDC,_ said Congress apparently decided to give the
program a fresh start.
   ``This gives all levels of government the opportunity to start
with a clean slate and have a quality-control system that is
operational and functional,'' Siegel said.
   The new system begins in October 1991.

<TEXT>
   The Japanese again reached into the upper echelons
of the world art market Thursday, outbidding a Parisian dealer to
buy a Picasso masterpiece for $48.9 million _ a record for a work
by the artist.
   ``Pierrette's Wedding,'' a long-disappeared masterpiece from
Picasso's famed blue period, was bought by Nippon Autopolis Co. in
an auction linking bidders in Paris and Tokyo by live satellite TV.
   Action at the Drouot-Montaigne auction house was a tense duel
between an unidentified Japanese bidder in Toyko and Herve
Odermatt, a well-known Paris art dealer.
   When the bidding topped Odermatt's offer of $45.9 million, he
paused for several seconds. The standing-room-only room packed with
celebrities fell silent.
   Odermatt finally shook his gray head, indicating he would go no
higher. Auctioneer Jean-Claude Binoche banged the gavel, and the
painting belonged to the Japanese company.
   ``Of course I'm very disappointed, especially since I was so
close to getting it,'' Odermatt said in an interview. ``During the
few seconds I hesitated _ and I knew everyone was waiting _ I kept
thinking about the condition of the painting. That's what finally
made me decide to let it go.''
   Odermatt said pre-sale estimates that the painting would go for
$50 million to $70 million were not justified.
   ``I spent half an hour last night examining the work, and it was
worn and awfully varnished,'' he said. ``If it had been in perfect
condition, the sky was the limit.''
   The poignant group portrait painted in 1905 will have a new home
in a specially built museum located in an auto-racing theme resort
in the mountains of southern Japan.
   ``We felt we absolutely must have the real thing, a real
masterpiece like this for our museum,'' said Takeshi Inaba, senior
managing director of Nippon Autopolis. ``We're very happy to have
bought the painting.''
   The previous Picasso record was held by ``Yo Picasso,'' which
sold for $47.85 million at Sotheby's in May.
   The record for any work of art _ $53.9 million dollars _ was set
in 1987 for Vincent Van Gogh's ``Irises.''
   Thursday's sale also included a series of 26 paintings by
American pop artist Andy Warhol titled ``Ladies and Gentlemen.''
They were sold in Tokyo for prices ranging from between one-half to
two-thirds their pre-sale estimates.
   ``It was a big mistake to auction the Warhols in Tokyo and
Paris,'' said French collector Alain Lesieutre. ``They would have
brought top dollar in the United States.''
   Lesieutre called the price paid for the Picasso ridiculously low.
   ``It's a gift, a giveaway. It's a masterpiece and should have
brought much more, but the French are afraid of big money,'' he
said.
   On hand for the sale was Picasso's daughter, Paloma, who blamed
the lack of excitement and relatively low price on the presence of
TV cameras. ``The atmosphere was cold,'' she said.
   ``Pierrette's Wedding'' is considered one of Picasso's most
important paintings because of its unusually large size, its
hauntingly beautiful blues and pinks, and its harlequin theme.
   The painting shows six figures, probably circus performers,
sitting around a table celebrating with an unsmiling newlywed
couple. The bride, her head draped with a Spanish-style mantilla,
has eyes only for her lover, whom she has abandoned to marry an
older, richer man pictured in a top hat.
   ``It's a transitional painting that announces all the colors and
forms that will dominate Picasso's works for years to come,'' said
Isabelle de Wavrin, art critic for Beaux Arts Magazine.
   The painting was put up for sale by Swedish industrialist
Frederik Roos, who acquired it in 1988. The painting was granted a
visa to leave France only after Roos donated another Picasso from
the blue period, ``La Celestine,'' to the Louvre.
   Although art historians are familiar with the dozens of sketches
Picasso drew in preparation for ``Pierrette's Wedding,'' the final
work disappeared years ago, changing hands many times before
surfacing in 1988 in a Picasso retrospective.

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev proposed
Thursday that a summit of European nations, the United States and
Canada be held next year to speed up the integration of Europe and
eliminate East-West divisions.
   Gorbachev said the meeting he called ``Helsinki 2'' should be
moved up from 1992 as originally called for under the 1975 Helsinki
Accords on human rights and security in Europe.
   He made the proposal in a speech from the Michelangelo-designed
Campidoglio, Rome's city hall, where the treaty was signed in 1957
establishing the European Common Market.
   Gorbachev said the sweeping changes in Eastern Europe are
irrevocable. He insisted they do not signal ``the collapse of
socialism,'' but rather the further development of a concept with
noble goals and ``enormous humanistic and democratic potential.''
   On the eve of his historic meeting with Pope John Paul II,
Gorbachev said that Soviets have changed their attitude toward
religion and now believe religious values can help in the
restructuring of Soviet society.
   Gorbachev's 20-minute speech, delivered while standing in front
of a 12-foot-high statue of Julius Caesar, was interrupted three
times by applause from several hundred dignitaries. At the end,
they stood and clapped politely.
   Expanding on his desire to build ``a common European home,''
Gorbachev said recent events, presumably the dramatic rush toward
reform in Eastern Europe, ``underscore the desirability of an
all-European summit, a Helsinki 2 meeting. We could consider
advancing its date from 1992 to, say, as early as 1990.''
   The Soviet Union had been pressing for an international human
rights conference to be held in Moscow next year as part of the
process leading toward the next 35-nation Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe.
   The conference last met in Helsinki in 1975, when the United
States, the Soviet Union, Canada and all European countries except
Albania signed the Helsinki Accords concerning military security,
economic cooperation and human rights.
   ``In the final analysis,'' Gorbachev said, ``we envision Europe
as a commonwealth of sovereign democratic states with a high level
of equitable interdependence and easily accessible borders open to
the exchange of products, technologies and ideas and wide-ranging
contacts among people.''
   Although he did not repeat it in his speech Thursday, the Soviet
Union has said it is prepared to negotiate dissolution of the
Warsaw Pact and NATO. The United States has rejected the suggestion
pending further progress in nuclear and conventional arms control
talks.
   Gorbachev, who was baptized in the Russian Orthodox Church but
rose through the ranks of the officially atheist Communist Party,
said the Soviets ``have abandoned the claim to have a monopoly on
the truth. We no longer think that we are the best and that we are
always right, that those who disagree with us are our enemies.''
   And he said Soviets have changed their attitude toward religion,
``which, admittedly, we used to treat in a simplistic manner.''
   Religion has been rejected to some extent in all major social
upheavals, not just the Communist revolution, he said. ``But now we
not only proceed from the assumption that no one should interfere
in matters of the individual's conscience; we also say that the
moral values which religion generated and embodied for centuries
can help in the work of renewal in our country, too. In fact, this
is already happening.''
   Gorbachev goes to the Vatican on Friday for the first meeting
between the pope and a Soviet Communist Party chief. On Saturday,
he begins a two-day summit with President Bush on ships in the
Mediterranean.
   Gorbachev rejected suggestions that removal of barriers between
East and West can only be accomplished if the Soviet Union abandons
its ideological and social values.
   ``Frankly, we are often told that we should purely and simply
renounce socialism,'' he said. ``Then, it is said, the world will
become a nice and easy place to live in. ... This is not the
approach that the world needs as it is taking a great turn to a new
era.''
   ``Today, the focus is on the socialist world,'' he said.
``Having embarked upon the road of radical reform, the socialist
countries, one after another, are crossing the line beyond which
there is no return to the past.''
   ``Nevertheless,'' he said, ``it is wrong to insist, as many in
the West do, that this is the collapse of socialism, the end of the
socialist system. On the contrary, it means that the socialist
process in the world, having accumulated extensive, although
admittedly dramatic experience, will pursue its further development
in a multiplicity of forms.''
   Referring to his meetings with Bush, Gorbachev said he is
convinced the talks will ``enable us to take a new constructive
step in the movement from mutual understanding to mutual action in
Soviet-U.S. relations.''
   Earlier in the day, at the conclusion of two days of high-level
talks, Italy and the Soviet Union issued a statement saying that
``curtain of mistrust between the East and the West is crumbling.''
   In an accompanying accord signed by the foreign ministers of
both countries, Italy offered to help the Soviets convert military
plants to civilian use.

   The State Department said Thursday it would
allow journalists from Poland and Hungary to apply for passes
enabling them to move around the building unescorted.
   ``This step is being decided in light of the momentous steps
toward freedom which have already taken place in both Hungary and
Poland,'' said Margaret Tutwiler, the department's spokeswoman.
   Polish and Hungarian journalists who attend the daily press
briefing or visit the press office on a regular basis can apply for
building passes that give them the same privileges as colleagues
from the United States and other Western countries, Tutwiler said.
   In May 1987, the State Department attempted to strengthen
security at the building by barring unescorted visits by
journalists from the Soviet Union, East Germany, Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia, Romania, Poland and Hungary.
   Those reporters were required to have escorts when they attended
the press briefing or conducted interviews with diplomats. The
restrictions apply to all but Polish and Hungarian reporters.

   Suburban postal carriers had such good
results paying their customers for wrongly delivered mail that the
program, intended as only a 60-day trial, will continue
indefinitely, officials say.
   Since late September, every properly addressed letter delivered
to the wrong address in suburban Worthington has cost carriers 25
cents out of their own pockets, but most carriers say they don't
mind. They say their reputations are at stake.
   ``It's just a small way of telling our patrons that we are
concerned about our jobs, and we try to do a decent job,'' said Tom
Harris, a letter carrier for six years. ``We want them to know the
whole postal system is not lousy.''
   The 60-day trial program, modeled on one in Highpoint, N.C., was
supposed to end last Saturday.
   Union and postal officials say the program has been successful
considering the 125,000 pieces of mail the branch handles a day.
   ``People are taking a lot of pride in what they do, and it's
worked well for them,'' said Douglas Gulley, president of the
Letter Carriers local that represents Worthington branch employees.
   Harris said he had only one errant delivery during the two
months of the program.
   ``I must have misread it,'' he said.
   During the first 60 days of the program, participating postal
workers paid customers a total of $11 for 44 pieces of wrongly
delivered mail, station manager Robert Summers said. Most of the
mistakes occurred in the past three weeks as substitutes filled in
for vacations and illness of regular carriers, he said.
   The number of customer complaints has dropped from an average of
10 calls per week to one call a week since the program began,
Summers said.
   Of the branch's 45 mail carriers, 25 participated in the
program. Carriers at the station Wednesday who did not participate
declined to be interviewed.
   Gulley said many carriers have high-volume business routes with
mail bundled by other employees and don't want to be responsible
for someone else's mistakes.
   Carrier Cindy Williams offered another reason for program
holdouts. ``It's the holidays, and I think a lot of people are
afraid to join. A lot of them are on new routes, and they don't
want to be broke for Christmas.''
   Ms. Williams, a letter carrier for three years, said her
customers praised the program, and most assured her they would
never turn her in.
   But Ms. Williams said she paid 25 cents to a business customer
during the program.
   ``I don't know if I was the one that delivered that day, but I
was the one they put down,'' she said.
   The program began after a local magazine chided the branch for
its poor service, Summers said. He said carriers read about a
similar program in Highpoint, N.C., and decided to try and salvage
their reputations.
   The Highpoint program started last Dec. 23 with about 28 city
and rural carriers of 79 total routes participating. So far,
they've paid customers 78 quarters, said postmaster Enola Mixon.
   About 15 carriers have not paid out any quarters.
   ``We got, I don't know how many nice compliments, the customers
thought it was just great,'' Mrs. Mixon said.
   From Dec. 23 to Jan. 24, they delivered more than a million
pieces of mail and gave out 37 quarters, mostly on routes handled
by substitutes. If substitutes didn't participate in the program,
the quarter was paid by management and the union president at the
time.
   Officials will meet in the next couple of weeks to assess the
Highpoint program and see if any changes need to be made.
   U.S. Postal Service officials and the National Association of
Letter Carriers, which represents mail carriers, said they were not
aware of similar programs elsewhere in the nation.

   East German authorities Thursday stripped
former leader Erich Honecker of immunity from criminal charges and
began an investigation of alleged abuses of power by Honecker other
disgraced Communist Party officials.
   Authorities also sealed off a country estate where Honecker and
other ousted leaders have lived, apparently to prevent removal of
evidence.
   The moves were the strongest indications to date that the former
leadership will be made to account for alleged abuses.
   ``Everyone is equal before the law,'' Communist Party chief Egon
Krenz said on national television. He said the accusations against
Honecker and others are ``serious and unworthy of a Politburo
member.''
   The official ADN news agency reported later that more than
10,000 East Germans marched in the city of Erfurt to protest
special privileges for top party and government figures.
   ADN announced a criminal investigation into alleged abuse of
power by Honecker, former Premier Willi Stoph, and former Politburo
member Guenther Kleiber, who are all in seclusion. Their
whereabouts is not known.
   The news agency said Honecker, who was dropped from power Oct.
18, was under investigation on suspicion of having misused his
office for personal gain. It gave no details of the alleged abuses.
   Krenz, a former protege of Honecker's, has been pressing for
exposure and punishment of past errors and excesses as a means of
repairing his party's tarnished image.
   Krenz faces widespread opposition from many pro-democracy
activists, as well as within the troubled party hierarchy that
meets in a crucial session Dec. 15-17.
   The party that has dominated government and society for 40 years
also is wrestling with challenges and demands for broader
power-sharing by the fledgling political opposition.
   The Communist Party last week announced an internal
investigation of reported wrongdoing by Honecker, his top
lieutenant Guenter Mittag and other party figures recently removed
from positions of authority.
   Mittag was thrown out of the party Nov. 23 in the first punitive
action against any of the ousted officials.
   The aging party figures who were part of the hard-line regime
headed by Honecker for 18 years are accused by pro-democracy forces
of having lined their pockets at public expense while the national
economy slipped continuously behind that of West Germany.
   Regional government chief Hartmut Boecker said the immunity
Honecker was earlier entitled to was suspended ``to facilitate a
criminal investigation and inquiry,'' ADN reported.
   Local authorities also have imposed a security cordon around the
residential estate to ``prevent the removal of material from the
buildings,'' Boecker was quoted by ADN as saying.
   The move appeared to be aimed at both preserving evidence that
might be used against the former leaders in a criminal trial and
preventing the residents from absconding with valuables from the
state compound.
   East German newspapers reported Wednesday that Stoph had
abandoned his opulent home in a former nature preserve after
hauling out artwork and furniture. He left behind expensive
electronics, imported wine and other evidence of the lavish
lifestyle previously enjoyed by the party elite.
   ADN gave no indication of what charges might be filed against
any of the officials.
   Honecker, 77, has not been seen in public since his ouster six
weeks ago, and is reported to be seriously ill.
   Krenz initially was seen as the former leadership's hand-picked
successor, and therefore widely mistrusted. But under public
pressure for social and economic reforms, the new party leadership
has agreed to talks on the nation's future, beginning next week.
   Party leaders have also promised to give up their constitutional
mandate for a ``leading role,'' and have agreed to work toward free
elections.
   Also Thursday, the government's chief spokesman declared
national unity in the effort to resist moves toward reunification
of the two German states.
   Wolfgang Meyer told reporters at a press conference that the
appeal issued by leading intellectuals and signed by Krenz, Premier
Hans Modrow and other top officials has won ``the support of the
majority of the population,'' including the various pro-reform
movements pushing the Communists to share power.
   The appeal was announced after West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl laid out a 10-point plan to work for eventual reunification of
Germany _ a concept broadly resisted by East Germans who want to
remain a separate and sovereign state.
   A signature drive has been launched for support of the appeal,
which declares East Germany a socialist state independent of West
Germany.

   President Bush, preparing to leave for his
weekend summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said
today he hoped their talks would mark an important milestone toward
molding a ``Europe that is indeed whole and free.''
   Gorbachev, meanwhile, called for a 35-nation summit meeting next
year to speed up the integration of Europe and to eliminate
East-West divisions.
   In a speech from Rome's city hall, where a treaty was signed in
1957 establishing the European Common Market, Gorbachev said a
multinational meeting scheduled for 1992 under the Helsinki Accords
on human rights and security in Europe should be moved up.
   Earlier, Gorbachev joined his Italian hosts in issuing a
statement citing the ``changes toward democracy'' in countries such
as Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia. The
statement reiterated the Kremlin's willingness to let those Eastern
bloc nations set their own courses.
   Bush said he thought he and his summit partner had similar goals.
   ``Ours is a powerful and historic opportunity,'' he declared in
a speech to members of his staff gathered in the windswept Rose
Garden outside the White House.
   As Bush and Gorbachev prepared to travel to the Mediterranean,
the nearly 600-member crew of the guided missile carrier USS
Belknap worked feverishly around visiting reporters and a tour of
Soviet sailors and officers to spruce up the ship and prepare its
rooms for the heads of state.
   Bush, who planned an early evening departure aboard Air Force
One, stressed his support for Gorbachev's program of reform, even
as he hailed the changes sweeping Eastern Europe.
   ``America understands the magnitude of Mr. Gorbachev's
challenges and let there be no misunderstanding, we support
perestroika,'' he said.
   Bush added that he thought the people of all of Europe
understand that ``East and West are not in some kind of
competition, rather we're both working to make the world a more
peaceful one.''
   He added, ``Mr. Gorbachev and I see eye to eye on what our
upcoming meeting is all about.''
   The Soviet-Italian statement declared that the ``curtain of
mistrust between the East and West is crumbling.''
   It was issued in conjunction with the signing of accords by
foreign ministers Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union and
Gianni De Michelis of Italy, pledging cooperation in converting
military plants to civilian use, combating drug trafficking,
protecting business investments and saving the environment.
   The statement said both countries hoped talks in Vienna on
reducing conventional weapons would lead to an agreement by the end
of next year.
   Bush said he and Gorbachev can ``move beyond containment ...
toward a Europe that is indeed whole and free,'' and one that has a
level of ``security, prosperity and peace as yet unknown in our
lifetime.''
   In recent weeks, Cold War barriers to freedom have fallen across
Eastern Europe _ including the beginning of the dismantling of the
Berlin Wall _ with Gorbachev's encouragement.
   Bush's sendoff ceremony was attended by nearly 300
administration officials who filled the Rose Garden under blue
skies and brisk winds.
   As he left after the six-minute speech, Bush told reporters:
``I'm ready for the meeting. I'm ready and confident.''
   Earlier, at a Cabinet meeting called to preview the session,
Bush said he was confident ``Gorbachev is looking at the meeting
very much the same way we are.''
   He also said he received a full report Wednesday night from
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on his own meetings in
Moscow last week with Gorbachev.
   Mulroney told reporters Gorbachev isn't looking for ``miracles''
from Malta but deserves help from the West such as observer status
at world trade talks.
   Bush, in an interview Wednesday with newspaper correspondents
that was released today by the White House, was asked what changes
he foresaw for the rival NATO and Warsaw Pact military alliances.
   ``It's too early to predict how all this will play out, but
clearly it's moving in the right direction and, clearly, it's
moving in a way that should result in a permanent reduction of the
tensions that have been the hallmark of the Cold War days,'' the
president said.
   He said the unfolding changes in the once hard-line communist
states in Eastern Europe have given ``more of an urgency'' to the
meeting since he first proposed it in July. But he insisted,
``There's been no change, in my view, as to what this meeting is to
be about.''
   Asked if the United States had sent Gorbachev the message that
it wants no surprises at Malta, Bush said: ``We've sent the message
that we don't think there are going to be any. But if he comes with
something, fine. I mean, this is an open thing. He can say anything
he wants. But I think he wants to see a successful meeting.''
   He said he believes the Soviets are not ``looking for
confrontation. ... I think that it is unlikely there will be
something so dramatic that it puts us in an embarrassing position.''
   Harnessing nuclear and conventional weapons also is on Bush's
agenda. And while Secretary of State James A. Baker III says the
sessions aboard U.S. and Soviet warships Saturday and Sunday will
not amount to ``an arms control summit,'' two sets of negotiations
could get a shot in the arm.
   The eventual result might be completion of treaties to reduce
NATO and Warsaw Pact troops, tanks and artillery across Europe and
to slash U.S. and Soviet arsenals of long-range bombers, missiles
and nuclear submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent by the time
Gorbachev visits Washington next summer for a more formal summit.
   Negotiations are proceeding briskly in both arenas in Vienna and
Geneva, and the easing of tensions across the European landscape
serves as a catalyst for even speedier resolution of the pacts.
   Still, Baker stressed at a White House news conference Wednesday
that the president would conduct no negotiations behind the backs
of U.S. allies.
   Immediately after the summit Bush will fly to Brussels to brief
leaders of the 15 other North Atlantic Treaty Organization
governments.
   Gorbachev will use the summit to provide Bush with a ``very
frank'' assessment of his domestic woes and try to commit the
United States to rapid progress on nuclear and conventional
disarmament, The Washington Post reported today, quoting
unidentified Soviet officials.
   The officials, the newspaper said, don't expect Gorbachev to
make any ``grand unilateral gestures,'' but hinted that he might
announce the withdrawal of some warships from the Mediterranean and
call for the region to be declared a nuclear-free zone.

   The personal pilot of Colombia's alleged
cocaine godfather was extradited to the United States Thursday to
face prosecution in a massive cocaine importation case, the U.S.
Marshals Service said.
   He is the ninth person to be extradited from Colombia since
August when the Colombian government began a new drive against drug
trafficking, said K. Michael Moore, director of the service.
   Moore identified Jorge Mario de la Cuesta as a kingpin of the
Medellin cartel, but he is not one of those on the U.S. Justice
Department's list of the 12 most wanted drug suspects in Colombia.
   According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, as many as 300
Colombians already are under indictment in various U.S. cities on
drug-related charges, although many of the indictments are sealed.
   Jorge Mario de la Cuesta, indicted with four other Medellin
leaders last February, was brought to Jacksonville, Fla., by a team
of the marshals special operations group after being turned over by
Colombian authorities, Moore said. He faces arraignment in U.S.
District Court there.
   At the time of his arrest last month, de la Cuesta was
identified as the pilot of Pablo Escobar, leader of the Medellin
cocaine cartel.
   De la Cuesta and the others were charged in Jacksonville last
Feb. 24 with taking part in a conspiracy that resulted in more than
16 tons of cocaine being smuggled into the United States.
   The indictment accuses de la Cuesta of piloting or being aboard
aircraft that carried more than 9,500 pounds of cocaine from
Colombia to the Bahamas, the marshals service said. From there,
according to the indictment, the cocaine was smuggled into the
United States by plane and boat.
   Others named in the indictment were Carols Lehder, tried,
convicted and now serving a sentence of life-without-parole and 135
years; Pablo Escobar-Gaviria; Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez-Gacha; Jorge
Ochoa-Vasquez and Fabio Ochoa-Vasquez. All except Lehder are
defendants in the case.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh praised Colombian president
Virgilio Barco and his government for their work in the fight
against ``narco-terrorists.''

   Opposition politicians said Thursday
they had cleared the way for one of their leaders to become India's
next prime minister.
   The National Front's Parliament members were scheduled to meet
Friday to officially elect Vishwanath Pratap Singh head of the
five-party National Front coalition.
   He then likely would be asked by the president to serve as prime
minister.
   Guruswamy said another contender for the job, Chandra Shekhar,
had been persuaded to withdraw his candidacy, and that no one in
the alliance would contest Singh's nomination.
   Singh, 58, could not be reached for comment Thursday, but he has
insisted he does not want to replace Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
Singh's colleagues said he had no choice, however.
   ``He has to bow to the wishes of the people and the party. He
has no alternative,'' said Mohan Guruswamy, an associate.
   Gandhi resigned Wednesday after his Congress Party failed to win
a majority in last week's parliamentary elections, but President
Ramaswamy Venkataraman asked him to continue until a new government
is formed.
   With results for all but two of the 525 Parliament seats
announced by Thursday night, the Congress Party had won the most
seats at 192. Its small-party allies together won another 17.
   The National Front has 143 seats and has been promised support
by the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, which has 90 seats, and
by several left-wing groups, which won 51.
   That would give the centrist National Front 284 seats, more than
the 263 needed for a majority.
   The rest of the seats went to small parties and independents who
have not taken sides.
   Singh, a former defense and finance minister, is the best-known
leader in the National Front. But the mild-mannered politician has
said he just wants to be president of the People's Party, the
largest component of the National Front.
   ``Singh is not sure he will be able to handle a hung house,'' a
senior leader of the National Front said speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``That's why he was so hesitant to become the prime
minister.''
   Another source in the National Front said: ``Singh was told he
has no business to be in politics if he does not seek office.''
   In past elections, one party _ almost always the Congress Party
_ has won a comfortable majority. In the absence of a majority, the
president chooses which party will form a government.
   The Congress Party said on Wednesday that it would not seek the
job.
   The National Front has been dogged by highly publicized internal
feuds since it was formed in August 1988. After elections were
called in October, the front's leaders set aside their differences
and united to oust Gandhi.
   But those differences started to surface this week and a leading
newspaper said Thursday they threaten the Front's chances for
success.
   ``The onus of bringing about a realignment of centrist forces,
once the government formed by the opposition has had the time to
display its ineffectiveness, is squarely with Mr. Gandhi,'' the
independent Times of India said.

<HEAD>Paper: PTL Prosecutors Considering Perjury Indictments Against Witnesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury meeting next week
will consider new indictments in the PTL ministry investigation,
apparently against witnesses who may have committed perjury, a
newspaper reported Thursday.
   Richard Dortch, PTL founder Jim Bakker's former right-hand man
at the television ministry, is expected to appear before the grand
jury, The Charlotte Observer reported, quoting sources familiar
with the PTL investigation.
   The government's latest targets apparently are witnesses who may
have perjured themselves before a special grand jury that indicted
Bakker, Dortch and two other PTL associates.
   The names of the witnesses were not disclosed. Bakker himself
was not a witness before the grand jury.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller, who prosecuted Bakker and
Dortch, would not talk about the grand jury.
   Bakker was sentenced in October to 45 years in prison and fined
$500,000 after being convicted of 24 counts of fraud and
conspiracy. Dortch pleaded guilty to reduced charges and was
sentenced to eight years in prison and fined $200,000.
   Dortch's plea agreement allowed him to remain free until he had
finished cooperating with the goverment. He testified against
Bakker at the former PTL leader's trial.
   Dortch had been scheduled to begin serving his sentence Oct. 13.
But on Oct. 5, his attorneys filed a motion asking that Dortch not
be required to report to prison until at least Jan. 15, ``so that
he might continue to comply with his agreement to cooperate with
the United States.''
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter, who sentenced Bakker and
Dortch, granted the request.

<HEAD>Whooping Cranes Make Remarkable Comeback Following Losses in 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKPORT, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The endangered whooping crane population,
which suffered devastating losses in 1988, made a remarkable
comeback this year, a wildlife refuge manager says.
   A total of 144 birds have been sighted at the Aransas National
Wildlife Refuge near Rockport, where they spend the winter before
returning to their nesting grounds in Canada's Buffalo National
Park, said Brent Giezentanner, refuge manager.
   ``We're really happy. As a matter of fact, we're ecstatic so
far,'' he said Wednesday.
   Only 138 whooping cranes out of an expected 150 made it to the
refuge last year. Biologists estimated that as many as a dozen
birds may have died after leaving their Canadian habitat.
   One bird was shot by a Houston lawyer, who paid a $15,000 fine,
Giezentanner said.
   A good sign this year is that of the 21 whooping crane chicks
sighted and tagged in Canada, all but one made it to the Texas
refuge.
   The increase in the world's only remaining naturally reproducing
flock of whooping cranes is the result of favorable nesting
conditions in Canada and the fact that many of the birds are
reaching breeding age, Giezentanner said.

<HEAD>Cheating Probe Leads To Dismissal of Military Police Academy Students</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cheating investigation at the military
Security Police Academy at Lackland Air Force Base has led to the
dismissal of 14 students and charges against one of them and an
instructor, authorities said.
   ``This was the first time there was a suspected compromise (of
tests) of this magnitude,'' said base spokeswoman Delores Schroeder.
   One-third of a law enforcement class at the school, which trains
police for all military branches, was dismissed as a result of the
investigation, the San Antonio Light reported Thursday.
   The investigation started in September when officials looked
into allegations that a Marine instructor had sexual relations with
a female Navy student, who in turn allegedly received test answers
from the instructor.
   The female student allegedly gave the answers to four Navy
colleagues at the academy, authorities said.
   Those four Navy students were dismissed from the academy,
although not from the military. The woman student also was
dismissed from the school, and she and the Marine instructor face
courts-martial, the Light reported. Ms. Schroeder said Thursday
that she didn't know the exact charges that are being brought.
   While investigating that case, Air Force officials uncovered
information about a separate and larger cheating ring.
   ``The two (investigations) are unrelated, other than one
investigation led to another,'' Air Force Lt. Col. Johnny Whitaker
said.
   The instructor probe led investigators to information that nine
other students at the security school had been using workbooks
prepared by upper-classmen as they prepared for their exams.
   Ms. Schroeder said that the practice was not technically
cheating, but is considered unethical, and the students were
dismissed from the school. They, too, will be retrained for other
positions in the military, she said.
   The names of those involved were not immediately released.
   This is the largest cheating case uncovered at the police
academy, although authorities have investigated smaller, isolated
cases of cheating in the past, they said.

<HEAD>Housing Authority Instituting Midnight Basketball for Gang Kids</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city's public housing agency wants to defuse
late-night tension in some tough neighborhoods by luring gang
members into a midnight basketball league.
   ``This is for kids who have been written off,'' said Gil Walker,
a Chicago Housing Authority authority staff member and commissioner
of the new league.
   From 10 p.m. until 2 a.m. beginning in January, 150 young men
from 18 to 25 years old will be shooting at baskets.
   The idea is to keep the young men, especially the gang leaders,
off the streets during a dangerous time and give them extra support
and leadership in an effort to steer them straight, Walker said
Wednesday.
   ``This is going to be modeled after the NBA _ uniforms, playoffs
and championships,'' said Walker. ``But also, just like in the NBA,
if somebody has a drug problem, we're going to provide counseling.
Family problems, money problems, education, job training _ we're
going to help.''
   The program also was modeled on one in Glenarden, Md., just
outside Washington, D.C.
   Walker, a former semiprofessional basketball player, said he's
not alarmed by the prospect of rival gang members crowding into a
gym to watch or play.
   ``One thing I've found is that sports transcends gang feuding,''
he said. ``I've seen them lay their pistols down, play basketball,
then pick up their pistols and leave.''
   The authority has come up with $50,000, half from the federal
government, for start-up money and will seek corporate sponsors.
   ``We want to take them away to a resort for three days of
orientation to tell them exactly what we're about,'' Walker said.
   ``And it's not about winning and losing basketball games, but
about building self-esteem and personal pride,'' he said.
   Virginia Peoples, manager of the Rockwell Gardens housing
project, said she expects the program to be popular.
   The image of gang members standing around on the street corner
uninterested in anything but trouble, isn't accurate, Ms. Peoples
said.
   ``Some of the kids in gangs have come to us looking for
employment,'' she said. ``The stereotype isn't totally true.''

<HEAD>NBC News Anchor John Palmer Leaving After 26 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former ``Today'' show news anchorman John Palmer
said Thursday he's leaving NBC News in January to work on a new
syndicated daily half-hour series, ``Only Yesterday,'' that he will
anchor.
   ``I've been with NBC News for 26 years, and it's a little scary
to leave the mother ship,'' he said in an interview. ``But it
presented the kind of challenge that I think we need to do to kind
of shake up our lives a little bit.''
   ``I'm sorry he chose not to stay here,'' NBC News president
Michael Gartner said in a statement. ``I wish him the best. He is a
professional newsman and an extremely nice human being.''
   There has been speculation that Palmer would leave NBC since
September when, as part of a shakeup at ``Today,'' he was replaced
by Deborah Norville as the show's news anchor. He was shifted to
her former anchor job at the earlier ``NBC News at Sunrise.''
   Norville now is scheduled to become ``Today'' co-host in January
when Jane Pauley leaves the show after 13 years. No decision has
been made yet on who will suceed Norville as ``Today'' news anchor.
   Palmer, 54, had been been negotiating to work both as an
anchorman at station WTVJ-TV in Miami, an NBC-owned station, and as
a Miami-based Latin American correspondent for NBC News.
   But about 10 days ago, he said, he got a call from former ABC
News executive Av Westin, creator of the New York-based
newsmagazine series he will now anchor. Westin now is senior vice
president of reality-based programming for King World Productions.
   Palmer quoted Westin as saying, ``This is a wrist-grabbing call.
... Don't sign anything, I want to talk to you.''
   Their talks led to his decision to leave NBC for ``Only
Yesterday,'' which he said still is under development. The series
will look at both recent news developments and moments in
contemporary history and try to put them into perspective, he said.
   King World, which will produce and sell the series, syndicates
the successful ``Wheel of Fortune'' and ``Jeopardy'' game shows and
the Oprah Winfrey talk show.
   No decision has been made on Palmer's successor at ``NBC News at
Sunrise,'' an NBC spokeswoman said.

<HEAD>Law Experts Mixed on Usefulness of Sedition Tactic After Mistrial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal jury's rejection of
seditious conspiracy charges against three radicals may signal that
the little-used prosecution tactic will remain that way, a
constitutional scholar said.
   Others cautioned that the loss may be a setback, but won't stop
future sedition prosecutions.
   The nearly yearlong trial of Raymond Levasseur, his wife,
Patricia, and Richard Williams ended in a mistrial Wednesday after
the jury deadlocked on whether the three's alleged bombing exploits
constituted racketeering. Prosecutors said they may decide Friday
whether to retry the unresolved charges.
   On Monday, the jury issued a partial verdict clearing the three
on the sedition charges that they plotted to overthrow the
government.
   Arthur Kinoy, a constitutional law expert at Rutgers University,
interpreted that as a serious blow to the prosecution tactic of
filing seditious conspiracy charges.
   ``I think there were defense lawyers definitely watching who
will use (the Springfield case) as a very strong indication that
the seditious conspiracy technique has got to be totally
abandoned,'' Kinoy said. ``I think the jury was reacting in a very
fundamental and positive way to the basic constitutional
protections of the people of this country in the exercise of their
First Amendment rights.''
   William M. Kunstler, a defense lawyer who has been active in
supporting radical causes, called the jury's decision ``a big
setback'' for prosecutors, adding that it was ``a deserved one
because what they've been doing for a long time is prosecuting
revolutionary people in a far different way than anybody else, than
murderers, thieves and so on.''
   Prosecutors had claimed that the defendants belonged to a band
of terrorists who conspired to commit bombings and bank robberies
along the East Coast from 1976 to 1984 in a plot to overthrow the
government.
   The seditious conspiracy charges trace their roots to the
prosecution of Confederate spies in the Civil War era. The Sedition
Act of 1918 was used against war protesters in World War I and to
prosecute Puerto Rican nationalists in 1950. In April 1988, nine
white supremacists were acquitted of seditious conspiracy in
Arkansas.
   Prosecutors wouldn't comment on how they interpreted the
Springfield verdict.
   Elizabeth Fink, a member of the defense team, said, ``I think
they're going to give it up for a while. I think we dealt them a
stunning and complete defeat.''
   Still, Fink and retired Boston University Professor Howard Zinn,
an expert on revolutionary history, said they don't expect the
government to abandon seditious conspiracy.
   ``I'm not saying they'll use it tomorrow. But they're there as
handy weapons for them to use whenever they want to repress,'' Zinn
said.
   Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney Wayne Budd was deciding Thursday
whether to try again on the unresolved racketeering charges. A
statement may be made Friday, spokeswoman Susan Spurlock said. A
hearing is scheduled Jan. 5 in Boston to formally decide the
disposition of the case.
   Jurors had also cleared Mrs. Levasseur of a charge of
racketeering. They deadlocked on two counts of racketeering against
the two men and counts of racketeering conspiracy against all
three. Each count carries a maximum penalty of 20 years and $20,000
in fines.
   While admitting nothing, the defense had said that prosecution
was pointless since Levasseur and Williams were already serving
lengthy sentences for convictions on some of the bombings. Mrs.
Levasseur was free on bail after serving 3{ years of a 5-year
sentence for harboring a fugitive, her husband.
   The indictments were issued in May 1986 and the three defendants
were all that remained of an original group of eight. Jury
selection began in March 1988 and the actual trial began in
January. Estimates of the cost ranged from $2 million to $10
million.

<TEXT>
   The Red Army Faction has gained notoriety as
one of Europe's deadliest leftist terrorist groups in two decades
of bloody attacks on West German and American targets.
   Prosecutors said the group claimed responsibility for the bomb
attack Thursday morning that killed Alfred Herrhausen, chairman of
Deutsche Bank _ West Germany's largest _ and one of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's closest economic advisers.
   The Red Army Faction, which had been relatively inactive the
past three years, began operating in the late 1960s. It was known
then as the Baader-Meinhof gang, named after its founders Andreas
Baader and Ulrike Meinhof.
   It gained a reputation as a brutal, well-organized group that
struck at the heart of West Germany's industrial and economic power
by targeting leading managers for assassinations.
   American military targets have also come under Red Army Faction
attacks in the group's ``anti-imperialist struggle.''
   Most of the original Red Army Faction leaders have been killed
by police or have died in prison. Authorities say the group is now
believed to consist of a core of 20 to 30 members.
   The group's first action came in April 1968 with arson attacks
on two Frankfurt department stores.
   The group changed its name to the Red Army Faction in 1971 and a
series of assassinations and bomb attacks followed.
   On May 11, 1972, five bombs exploded at the U.S. Army's 5th
Corps headquarters in Frankfurt, killing an American officer and
injuring 13 other people.
   On May 25, 1972, three U.S. soldiers were killed and five
injured when a powerful bomb left in a parked car ripped through a
parking lot at the U.S. Army's European headquarters in Heidelberg.
The Red Army Faction claimed responsibility.
   In April 1975, Red Army Faction terrorists occupied the West
German Embassy in Stockholm in an attempt to free imprisoned fellow
terrorists. Two diplomats and two terrorists died in an explosion
during the siege.
   The year 1977 is remembered as a particularly bloody period,
when Red Army Faction attacks shook the foundations of West
Germany's society.
   That year, the group assassinated chief state prosecutor
Siegfried Buback; kidnapped and killed the head of the employer's
association, Hanns-Martin Schleyer; and killed Juergen Ponto, head
of the Dresdner Bank, one of the county's three big banks.
   A Lufthansa jet was also hijacked to Somalia in an attempt to
force authorities to free jailed Red Army Faction leaders. A West
German commando team stormed the jetliner to end the siege.
   A few hours later, Red Army Faction leaders Baader, Jan-Carle
Raspe and Gudrun Ensslin committed suicide in Stuttgart's
top-security prison of Stammheim, where they were serving life
sentences. Meinhof had committed suicide in prison a year earlier.
   Even with the deaths of the group's most notorious leaders, the
attacks did not cease.
   In August 1981, 20 people were injured in a car-bomb attack on
the U.S. Air Force headquarters in Ramstein. Two weeks later, U.S.
Gen. Frederik Kroesen, commander of U.S. Army Europe, narrowly
escaped assassination in Heidelberg when his car was attacked by
rockets.
   On Feb. 1, 1985, Munich industrialist Ernst Zimmermann was shot
and killed at his home by two terrorists.
   On Aug. 8, 1985, a car bomb killed two U.S. Air Force personnel
at the Rhein-Main Air Base outside Frankfurt and injured 20 others.
A U.S. soldier had been killed a day earlier in Wiesbaden, and the
Red Army Faction claimed responsibility for both attacks.
   In July 1986, Red Army Faction terrorists killed industrialist
Karl Heinz Beckurts near Munich, and in October that year, diplomat
Gerold von Braunmuehl was shot and killed on a street in Bonn.
   Authorities say about 60 people, including terrorists, have been
killed since the Red Army Faction began its terrorist campaign.

<TEXT>
   Round, black
markers dotted the huge stone faces of four U.S. presidents
Thursday as a project got under way to develop a long-term
maintenance plan for Mount Rushmore.
   Six National Park Service employees and workers from an
engineering firm carefully positioned 60 to 75 of the plastic
markers on the 60-foot granite faces so a photographer in a
helicopter could take close-up pictures Friday of the hundreds of
cracks that may threaten the structural integrity of the Shrine of
Democracy.
   ``The ultimate purpose is so we can actually map those cracks
and make models of the mountain and then analyze those models to
determine what potential movement and instability is there,'' said
Dan Wenk, Mount Rushmore superintendent.
   The black markers, 15 inches across or a little bigger than a
record album, will become reference marks in the photographs. The
markers should be removed Friday afternoon, Wenk said.
   Bob Crisman of the National Park Service, who was suspended by a
cable in front of the faces, stuck the markers on with an adhesive.
A ground crew of surveyors was in radio contact from the Mount
Rushmore Visitors Center telling him where to place the markers.
   Each fall, workers seal cracks in the faces with a mixture of
granite dust, white lead and linseed oil to keep out water that
would freeze and to lessen the damage when cool weather makes the
rock contract.
   It was decided two years ago that a comprehensive examination of
the popular tourist attraction and a maintenance plan was needed,
Wenk said.
   Monthly measurements since 1980 of a prominent crack on the
forehead of George Washington's likeness indicated the potential
instability of the fissure, he said. A scientist projected that the
crack would widen one-quarter of an inch every 200 years, Wenk said.
   ``There has been no discernable damage to the memorial to date,
and this will allow us to make certain we can preserve it,'' he
said.
   Wenk said the project actually started in September when aerial
photographs were taken.
   ``Something that's carved in stone has the impression of lasting
forever,'' he said. ``It's been 62 years since the carving first
began. It's a blink of an eye in geologic time.
   ``What we know for sure right now is that the mountain is still
in the same shape it was when it was completed.''
   A structural analysis of the portraits of Presidents Washington,
Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt drilled
and blasted into a mountainside in the Black Hills should be done
by next fall, Wenk said.
   They are largest carved figures anywhere. Washington's face is
as high as a five-story building, bigger than any sphinx in Egypt,
and the monument can be seen for 60 miles.
   Wenk said the estimated $350,000 cost of the project will be
paid by the private Mount Rushmore National Memorial Society. The
non-profit group has served as a benefactor to the monument since
1930.
   Work on Mount Rushmore began in 1927 by sculptor Gutzon Borglum
and was finished in 1941 by his son, Lincoln. The Black Hills
memorial attracts about 2 million visitors a year.
   The monument was the scene of a climactic final battle in
``North By Northwest,'' Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1959 thriller
starring Cary Grant.
   A golden anniversary celebration is being planned for 1991.
Mount Rushmore never has been officially dedicated, and Wenk said
it is hoped President Bush will agree to do the honors for the 50th
anniversary.

   A fire that damaged the home of a state
legislator and leading opponent of a university play about AIDS and
homosexuality was accidental, investigators said Thursday.
   Fireplace embers dumped in the back yard Wednesday night by one
of Rep. Jean Dixon's children ignited leaves and scrap wood and
spread to the home, causing an estimated $5,000 to $10,000 damage,
Chief Fire Marshal Dale Bittle said.
   Mrs. Dixon, a Republican, was among the most vocal opponents of
the play, ``The Normal Heart,'' which was presented Nov. 15-20 at
Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. She objected to
the use of a public facility for a play that presents homosexuality
as an acceptable lifestyle.
   On Nov. 15, a fire destroyed the home of a student who led a
campaign in support of the play. Investigators blamed arson, but no
arrests have been made.
   Supporters of the play, which sold out quickly amid the
controversy, had accused Mrs. Dixon of censorship and said the
production helped educate students about AIDS.

<TEXT>
   A hazing incident has led to the banishment
of a Stetson University fraternity that got into trouble over rape
allegations against several members last year.
   The Baptist-affiliated school announced Wednesday that it had
withdrawn recognition of Pi Kappa Alpha as a result of an
investigation that found members had degraded pledges, conducted a
public stunt and inflicted mental abuse.
   A Nov. 9 incident involving frat members, known as ``Pikes,'' in
the Ocala National Forest reflected poorly on the campus'
fraternith and sorority system, the university said in a statement.
It did not give details of the hazing.
   As a result of Stetson's action, Pi Kappa Alpha's national
office suspended the fraternity's charter, and the organization's
executive director said he will try to have the chapter kicked out.
   A fraternity member, the Stetson chapter, the national
organization and the university have been sued by a woman who told
investigators she was raped during a night of heavy drinking and
dancing at the Pike house in April 1988.
   The state attorney's office investigated the rape complaint
against two fraternity brothers. It found that they did have sexual
contact with the woman but said rape could not be proved.
   The woman's attorney, Sheldon Stevens, said additional
fraternity members would be added to the lawsuit before it goes to
trial.
   Four Pikes were suspended for one semester as a result of that
incident, and the fraternity was prohibited from participating in
social activities or sporting events.
   Steve Cox, Pi Kappa Alpha's national executive director, said
the Stetson chapter had been one category below a fully accredited
chapter since last spring.
   University officials will not elaborate on the school's actions
or make public the results of the investigation, said college
spokeswoman Jacqueline D. Kersh.
   The university defines hazing as ``any action taken or situation
created by the members of a fraternity intentionally, whether on or
off fraternity premises, to produce any physical or psychological
harm to the individual.''

   The government said Thursday it
will tear down the fences on its border with Austria and lift
virtually all restrictions on travel to the West.
   The Communist Party held its first talks with the opposition,
and members of Parliament proposed the repeal of tough laws used to
imprison and fine dissenters.
   The party also said it would announce a new program to include
``an objective revision'' of its attitude toward the ``Prague
Spring'' reform movement of 1968 and the Soviet-led invasion that
crushed it.
   Spokesman Josef Hora said the new policies might allow for
readmission to the party of half a million people expelled after
the invasion. They include Alexander Dubcek, who was Communist
Party chief and led the reforms.
   Hora said two Politburo members met for the first time with the
opposition Civic Forum group and students, who led 11 days of mass
protest that toppled the old party leadership.
   He said the meeting occurred because ``we are just one of the
political parties in this country, and we have to find our place.''
Civic Forum previously had met only with Premier Ladislav Adamec
and other government officials.
   State radio began broadcasting twice-daily programs about Civic
Forum activities, and also featured music by singers who had been
banned for years.
   Government spokesman Marcel Jansen said the Interior Ministry
would begin the ``removal of technical equipment'' on the frontier
with neutral Austria, which bristles with barbed wire, watchtowers
and trip wires.
   He did not say whether similar action would be taken on the
long, fortified border with West Germany.
   Hungary started tearing down its border barriers with Austria in
May, and tens of thousands of East Germans fled across the frontier
to the West before the East German government abolished travel
restrictions.
   The Interior Ministry said that starting Monday, citizens will
be allowed to use their passports for unrestricted travel to the
West and all East bloc countries except the Soviet Union and
Poland, the state news agency CTK reported.
   The only remaining formality will be completion of a simple
``statistical card,'' to be filled out as people leave the country,
CTK said.
   The government had announced Nov. 14 that its citizens would be
able to go to the West and Yugoslavia, a popular vacation spot,
beginning Jan. 1 without waiting 30 days for an exit visa.
   CTK said six political prisoners were released and that
President Gustav Husak granted amnesty to Stanislav Devaty, a
former spokesman for the Charter 77 human rights group who went
underground weeks ago, and another activist.
   State radio said Marxism-Leninism was being abolished as a
compulsory subject at universities, meeting a demand from students,
and faculty members would be hired on the basis of professional
qualifications rather than Communist Party membership.
   Economist Valtr Komarek, a reform-minded Communist some
opposition leaders see as a possible premier, cautioned against too
much compromise in negotiations for reform with Adamec.
   He spoke one day after Parliament removed provisions from the
constitution that guarantee the Communists a monopoly on power.
   Whatever the change in its constitutional status, the party has
1.7 million members and controls the official media, police, armed
forces and appointments in every operation from factories to
village schools.
   ``The structure of power remains intact,'' Komarek said. ``It is
only the facade which has collapsed, and the structure of power has
receded into the background.''
   ``Too many compromises are made, too much is spoken, too little
is done. Relapses are still possible.''
   The order to remove the fences reflected the new foreign policy
Adamec said he seeks to implement.
   He has said he will choose a new government by Sunday that
includes non-Communists. Members of Civic Forum could be among them.
   Adamec said Thursday he would accept opposition suggestions on
who should serve in the new government.
   Civic Forum spokesman Jiri Dienstbier said Wednesday night the
opposition wanted a civilian Communist to run the Defense Ministry
and a non-Communist to oversee police forces at the Interior
Ministry.
   In a television address Wednesday night, Adamec appeared to
promote himself as a figure of consensus to Czechoslovakia's 15.5
million citizens.
   He called for a reassessment of the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion,
and pledged to negotiate withdrawal of the 80,000 Soviet soldiers
stationed in Czechoslovakia ever since.
   The Soviet forces were seen as legitimizing party chief Milos
Jakes and other Czechoslovak leaders installed by Moscow after the
August invasion, but those men now have been ousted.
   Adamec said a Soviet withdrawal could occur only in ``an
all-European framework.''
   CTK said members of Parliament had suggested repeal of the
``public order'' laws used to impose stiff fines or jail terms on
anti-government protesters.
   The agency said the deputies, whom it did not identify, planned
to submit that proposal and other legal measures to shorten
pre-trial custody to a maximum of two months and remove the offense
of ``abusing a religious function,' which has been used against
priests.
   Priests must be licensed in Czechoslovakia, and many have had to
go underground after being barred from office by authorities.
   Deputies also want the independence of courts spelled out in a
new consitution and seek laws to punish those who damage the
environment, CTK reported.
   Nearly one-third of the nation's forests have been destroyed by
acid rain and other pollution, and both air and water are badly
polluted in Prague and several other cities.

   A chartered jet carrying 130 Vietnamese who
volunteered to return to the Communist homeland they fled flew for
Hanoi on Thursday amid signs that many more boat people may soon be
repatriated against their will.
   The sixth and largest batch of Vietnamese to voluntarily return
home included nine babies who were born in Hong Kong. The total
number to return home since the first flight in March is 637.
   The voluntary repatriation program, which is sponsored by the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has only attracted a
small fraction of the nearly 57,000 Vietnamese languishing in Hong
Kong, where they are seeking asylum after fleeing their homeland by
boat.
   About 44,000 of the Vietnamese arrived after June 1988, when
Hong Kong adopted a policy that treats all arriving boat people as
illegal immigrants subject to repatriation unless they can prove
they fled political or religious persecution.
   Boat people denied refugee status may soon be sent back to
Vietnam forcibly. British Foreign Minister Francis Maude said the
program of mandatory repatriation will start before the next
sailing season begins in February or March.

<HEAD>Friend Of Former House Speaker Wright Files For Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A businessman whose financial
relationship with former U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright was
investigated by a congressional ethics committee has filed for
protection under federal bankruptcy law.
   Fort Worth developer George Mallick listed debts of $12.2
million and assets of $533,626 in the petition filed Wednesday in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   Mallick and his wife, Marlene, filed under Chapter 7 provisions
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which allow a debtor's unprotected
assets to be liquidated to pay creditors.
   Mallick's $500,000 home and $30,000 worth of personal
possessions are exempt from seizure, said Mallick's attorney, Henry
Simon Jr.
   With those exemptions, the 177 creditors listed in the
bankruptcy filing are likely to receive ``virtually nothing,''
Mallick told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
   Mallick, 55, said the Texas oil and real estate busts took his
fortune, just like those of the Hunt brothers and former Gov. John
Connally. ``My economic fate was set, as was everybody else's, when
oil prices went to $10 in 1986. We all got caught,'' he said.
   Mallick estimated his net worth peaked at $7 million in 1982.
Although he has focused on real estate, he also once had oil
holdings worth about $1.5 million.
   More than 80 percent of Mallick's debt is in three large loans
for real estate developments, including $6.2 million owed to NCNB
Texas for financing on a $10 million office tower in Fort Worth.
   Mallick is one of Wright's closest friends. The longtime
congressman from Fort Worth resigned in June after a House ethics
committee said he committed 69 ethics violations, most involving
business and book deals.
   Among other issues, the committee questioned Wright's business
dealings with Mallick in a partnership called Mallightco.
   The committee said there was ``reason to believe'' that Wright
had improperly accepted nearly $145,000 in gifts from Mallick and
failed to report them.
   Most of the money came from an $18,000 annual salary to the
speaker's wife, Betty, over four years. It also included use of a
car, a condominium and an apartment.
   At the time, Mallick denied the partnership was a device to
funnel money to Wright and said Mrs. Wright had earned her pay.
   This week, Mallick said his Chapter 7 filing does not involve
Wright, Mrs. Wright or Mallightco, which is now controlled by one
of Mallick's daughters.

<HEAD>Congress Members Want No Role For Khmer Rouge In Cambodia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bipartisan group of 203 members of the House
and Senate on Thursday expressed concern to Secretary of State
James A. Baker III over reports of U.S. support for a Khmer Rouge
role in a transitional government in Cambodia.
   In a letter signed by 177 House members and 26 senators, timed
to coincide with President Bush's depature for the Malta summit
with Soviet President Gorbachev, the lawmakers said they would
``welcome some clarification'' about U.S. policy toward Cambodia.
The civil war there is one of several regional conflicts to be
addressed at the summit.
   The Khmer Rouge, blamed for the deaths of more than a million
Cambodians during its rule of the country in the 1970s, is the
strongest of the factions engaged in a civil war against the Phnom
Penh government.
   The United States is supporting other, non-communist rebel
groups as Cambodia's future leaders. But Baker reportedly has
explored giving the Khmer Rouge a minimal role in a transitional
government to break a diplomatic deadlock there.
   ``We are concerned that any U.S. effort directly or indirectly
to promote a power-sharing role for the Khmer Rouge _ no matter how
minimal _ would represent an implicit legitimization of a movement
the world finds abhorrent and would constitute a profound shift in
our policy,'' stated the letter, circulated by Rep. Chet Atkins,
D-Mass.
   The letter was signed by members of the House and Senate
leadership and numerous committee chairmen, and included House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and Senate Majority Whip
Alan Cranston, D-Calif.

<HEAD>Hepatitis B Four Times as Common Among Blacks</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For release 6 p.m. EST</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first nationwide scientific survey for
hepatitis B infection shows the infectious liver disease is four
times as common among blacks as whites, the national Centers for
Disease Control reported Thursday.
   In a survey of more than 14,000 people over five years, 4.8
percent showed signs in blood tests of having been infected with
hepatitis B virus some time during their lives. Among blacks, 13.7
percent tested positive, compared with 3.2 percent among whites.
   Previous studies, including checks of blood samples given by
blood donors, have pointed to an increased hepatitis B rate among
blacks. But this study is the first among a statistically
representative sample of people in the United States, said Dr.
Miriam Alter, a CDC hepatitis specialist.
   The survey was conducted in the years 1976-1980 by the CDC's
National Center for Health Statistics, but the results were
reported Thursday for the first time. The CDC gave no explanation
for the delay.
   Blacks' increased likelihood of getting hepatitis B sometime
during their lives was especially evident in test results for
people 65-74. In that age group, 39.6 percent of blacks had had
hepatitis B infections, compared with 6.9 percent of whites.
   Hepatitis B is transmitted in ways somewhat similar to AIDS _
through sexual intercourse or direct contact with blood. Infections
can cause inflammation of the liver, jaundice and flu-like
symptoms. The disease can be prevented by a vaccine developed in
1982.
   Researchers believe as many as half the people infected with
hepatitis B never suffer severe symptoms and never know they are
infected.
   The CDC did not speculate on reasons for the increased
prevalence of hepatitis B among blacks, but the Atlanta-based
agency did say that the traditional targets for hepatitis B
vaccinations _ health workers who handle blood, dialysis patients
and some institutionalized people _ may be the wrong targets.
   Given the high prevalence of hepatitis B infections among blacks
and a trend toward infection during adolescence, ``immunization of
the traditionally targeted risk groups will not markedly affect the
spread of infection in the United States,'' the CDC said.
   ``Immunization programs need to include adolescents and young
adults,'' the agency said.
   The CDC noted that survey findings showing higher rates of
active infection for people in the 12-24 age group, compared with
children under 11.
   Twenty thousand hepatitis B cases have been reported in the
United States this year; many cases go unreported.

<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Slovenian premier challenges

<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The premier of Slovenia on Thursday
challenged the need for a Yugoslav state to exist at all following
a decision by Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic, to sever ties
with his northern state.
   ``The latest events give rise to the question of the sense of
our further joint existence,'' Dusan Sinigoj said in a statement
carried by the official Tanjug news agency.
   ``Without ... democracy, human rights and (Yugoslavia's)
inclusion in the integrative processes in Europe, we cannot develop
into a democratic and efficient community of nationalities.''
   Communist Yugoslavia is a loose federation of six republics and
two autonomous provinces, with many nationalities and differing
ethnic populations. The regions have grown increasingly restive
since the death in 1980 of Josip Tito, founder of the modern
Yugoslav state in 1945.
   Tito's charisma was credited as a major force in binding
Yugoslavia together and submerging the regional tensions that
surfaced after his death.
   Liberal and prosperous Slovenia, where multiparty democracy is
being established, and the Serbian leadership, which advocates
continued Communist rule and a strongly centralized federal system,
have a history of disputes.
   Yugoslav politicians and news media were deeply divided over
Serbia's decision, announced Wednesday, to break off all government
and business contacts with Slovenia.
   Some Western diplomats described Serbia's move as a possible
first step toward disintegration of the fractious Yugoslav
federation.
   Serbia acted after Slovenia banned a mass protest rally by Serb
nationalists in Ljubljana, the Slovene capital.
   The demonstration, orchestrated by the Serbian government, was
scheduled for Friday in an apparent attempt by Serbia's
conservative Communist politicians to topple Slovenia's reformist
leadership.
   Sinigoj said that ``threats of destructive marches, the fanning
of nationalist passions and demands for replacement of legally
elected (officials) cannot achieve'' the democratization of
Yugoslavia.
   ``The instigators of such actions must be stopped.''
   Serbia's break in relations appears to be the culmination of a
long campaign against Slovenia and of its repeated informal
attempts to achieve an economic boycott on that republic.
   Slovenian politicians believe Serbian leaders want to impose
their ideological orthodoxy on all of Yugoslavia.
   Serbs from southern Kosovo province, who were to have
spearheaded the rally, denounced the ban as ``fascist-like.''
Serbian officials elsewhere called it ``a brutal ... anti-Serbian
and anti-Yugoslav act of Slovenia's ruling clique.''
   But a radio report in Croatia, another northern region that has
supported Slovenia's reforms, said ``Slovenia has demonstrated how
a state based on the rule of law should function, and therefore it
is extremely cynical to accuse it of fascism.''
   Croatia's influential Vjesnik newspaper wrote that Serbia's
``diabolic plan ... has been thwarted by the decisiveness and
firmness of the Slovene leadership, with the support of the vast
majority of Yugoslavia's citizens.''
   Police checked vehicles Thursday to stop Serbians from reaching
Ljubljana.
   The Slovene capital was virtually deserted. Most residents went
to nearby Alpine resorts for a two-day holiday marking the 46th
anniversary of the establishment of Yugoslavia as a Communist state.

<HEAD>Louisiana Legislator Announces Senate Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State Sen. Ben Bagert, a veteran
legislator who switched to the Republican Party in February,
announced Thursday he will challenge incumbent Democrat J. Bennett
Johnston for the U.S. Senate next year.
   Bagert, of New Orleans, is the second Republican candidate to
join the race against Johnston, who is seeking his fourth term in
1990. Secretary of State Fox McKeithen, who switched this year to
the GOP, announced his bid last month.
   Bagert said, in making his announcement, that Johnston had not
put Louisiana's interests first.
   ``Senators we send to Congress seem to get so wrapped up with
the strange world of Washington, they lose touch with the people
who sent them,'' Bagert said. ``And nowhere in this country is a
senator more a stranger to his home state than J. Bennett Johnston
is to Louisiana.''
   Bagert described himself as a conservative reformer and
supporter of lower taxes, cutting government spending and tough
drug laws and environmental legislation.
   Bagert also criticized Johnston, chairman of the Senate Energy
Committee, for working for a bill to build pipelines to transport
coal slurry _ coal mixed with water to make it easy to move by
pipeline _ instead of lines for Louisiana natural gas.
   Tony Garrett, a spokesman for Johnston, responded that the coal
slurry pipelines were designed to export coal and Louisiana ports
could benefit.
   He added that Johnston was not available to comment directly
because he was on a tour of the state, proving that he was not out
of touch with the people.

<HEAD>Rate Rises One-Fourth Cent Friday for Quake Relief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beginning Friday, California shoppers
have to dig one-quarter of one percent deeper into their
pocketbooks to help pay for earthquake relief.
   The quarter-cent-per-dollar sales tax increase was approved in
the Legislature's November special session and lasts until Dec. 31,
1990.
   The extra revenue is expected to total $800 million over the
next 13 months. The extra tax was timed to take advantage of the
two year-end holiday retail sales surges.
   Most of the money it raises will help pay for rebuilding roads,
bridges and public buildings damaged in the earthquake that struck
the San Francisco area Oct. 17.
   For most counties in the state, the new sales and use tax rate
will be 6.25 percent.
   However, voters in 13 counties, including Los Angeles,
Sacramento and San Francisco, had previously approved half-cent
sales tax increases, so their new rate is 6.75 percent. Five
counties, including San Diego, have had two such local increases,
so their rate is 7.25 percent.
   The Legislature agreed to the tax increase in a special session
called by Gov. George Deukmejian, rejecting arguments from some
legislators that state surplus funds, instead of a tax increase,
should go to quake relief and arguments from the other side that
the quarter-cent hike was not enough.

   Gloria Carter Spann, the last surviving sibling

pancreatic cancer, the same disease that killed their father,
sister and brother and contributed to the death of their mother.
   Mrs. Spann, 62, is a patient at Emory University Hospital in
Atlanta, according to a statement from her doctor, released
Thursday by the Carter Presidential Center.
   The statement from Dr. Martin York said the cancer has spread to
Mrs. Spann's liver, but ``she is in excellent spirits and feels
quite well.''
   ``Options for treatment have been discussed with her, and she is
weighing the options,'' the statement said.
   Carter's brother, Billy, died of pancreatic cancer in September
1988 at age 51. His evangelist sister, Ruth Carter Stapleton,
succumbed to the disease at the age of 54 in September 1983.
Carter's father, James Earl Carter Sr., also died of the disease in
1953.
   Pancreatic cancer also was a contributing factor in the death of
Carter's mother, ``Miss Lillian'' Carter, who died in October 1983
at age 85.

Rockies.
   Snow showers were scattered over northern Maine, Vermont, the
northwestern two-thirds of New York state, the northwestern third
of Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, northern Lower Michigan, eastern
Upper Michigan, and northeastern Minnesota,
   The small upstate New York community of Barnes Corners, about 10
miles south of Watertown, had 10 inches of new snow. The town is in
a ``snow belt'' downwind of Lake Ontario, whose moisture
contributes to ``lake effect snow.'' Watertown got 6 inches of snow
between 7 a.m. and noon, the National Weather Service reported.
   In western New York state, Springville had 5 inches of new snow.
   Elsewhere, snow was scattered over northwestern New Mexico. And
near San Angelo, Texas, less than an inch of snow fell overnight
across the Concho Valley, leaving patches of ice on roads and
highways in the morning.
   Rain was scattered from northwestern Texas across central Texas
and the central half of the Texas Gulf Coast.
   South of Florida, tropical storm Karen dumped heavy rain on
Cuba, with 14 inches in 24 hours at Punte del Este on the Isle of

<TEXT>
   Sen. Donald Riegle has hired a lawyer who
briefly worked for Oliver North in the Iran-contra affair to
represent Riegle in the probe of his role in the nation's biggest
savings and loan failure.
   Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and four other
senators met with federal regulators on behalf of the failed
California thrift in 1987 _ two years before it was seized by the
government. Lincoln's owner, Charles H. Keating Jr., and his
associates made large campaign contributions to all five. Riegle
received $78,250 but returned it in 1988.
   Riegle has retained Washington lawyer Thomas Green to represent
him before the Senate ethics committee, which announced this month
it had hired an outside counsel to determine whether a full-scale
probe of the senators' conduct was justified.
   Green, 48, is a former assistant U.S. attorney general for the
District of Columbia.
   He represented North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel and
former White House aide, in the early stages of the Iran-contra
case. Other Green clients for a short time were Albert Hakim and
retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, key figures in the
arms-for-hostages scandal.
   Green dropped North's case after an incident involving
classified documents given North by his secretary, Fawn Hall, who
had smuggled them out of the White House.
   Green later refused to testify to a grand jury about the
incident on grounds of attorney-client privilege and Fifth
Amendment protections.
   Riegle repeatedly has denied any wrongdoing in the Lincoln
Savings &amp; Loan affair. In an interview Wednesday, he voiced
confidence that the ethics probe would find that his conduct had
been ``entirely proper.''

<TEXT>
   New President Elias Hrawi vowed Thursday
to recover the presidential palace and other government
institutions from a defiant Christian Gen. Michel Aoun, but said he
would try to avoid bloodshed.
   He spoke at a news conference as hundreds of Syrian army trucks
carried supplies to frontline positions in south Beirut and in
mountains east and northeast of the capital.
   ``The Syrian troops are in combat formations. Their command is
supplying them with ammunition enough to last for quite a long
time,'' according to a military source in Moslem west Beirut.
   Preparations for a final showdown to oust Aoun from the
presidential palace in suburban Baabda have been afoot all week.
   Syrian troops and armor began rolling in Monday, strengthening
forces along the front lines after Aoun rejected Hrawi's election
Nov. 24 and subsequent presidential decrees dismissing the general
as army commander and disbanding his interim military Cabinet.
   Israel radio reported Aoun has requested military support from
the commander of Israel's surrogate militia in south Lebanon, Gen.
Antoine Lahd, but that Israel rejected the appeal.
   Lahd commands the Israeli-backed, 2,500-man South Lebanon Army
militia, which patrols a buffer zone Israel maintains in Lebanon,
ostensibly to protect its northern border against guerrilla attacks.
   Aoun aides had no immediate comment on the report.
   ``I will resort to all possible means to regain the state
institutions from those who control them,'' Hrawi, a Maronite
Catholic, said at the news conference in Ablah, an army barracks in
the Syrian-policed Bekaa valley.
   Hrawi moved to an officer's residence at the Ablah barracks
Wednesday pending settlement of the dispute over the presidential
palace.
   Hrawi accused Aoun, also a Maronite, of ``partitioning
Lebanon,'' adding that he ``has hope in our armed forces to reunite
the nation.''
   ``I don't want bloodshed, either in (Christian) east Beirut or
in west Beirut. ... I'll use all possible means to reunite the
country,'' he said.
   He urged all 42,000 Lebanese army soldiers to be ``at the
disposal of your new commander, Adm. Emile Lahoud,'' who was
appointed Tuesday to replace Aoun as army commander. About 20,000
soldiers remain loyal to Aoun, and the others, mainly Moslem units,
have accepted Lahoud as commander.
   Addressing Aoun and his supporters, Hrawi said: ``You have
killed the president of the republic and attacked the residences
and property of parliamentary deputies. These attacks will not go
unpunished.''
   Hrawi's predecessor, President Rene Mouawad was killed by a bomb
in west Beirut on Nov. 22, 17 days after his election.
   Syria and its allies blamed Aoun for the killing, but he denied
the charge.
   The homes of at least six Christian parliamentarians were
destroyed by bombs in the Christian enclave after Parliament
approved a peace plan to end 14 years of civil war at a special
session in the Saudi Arabian resort Taif in October.
   Aoun rejected the accord because it did include a timetable for
a Syrian troop withdrawal.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said the United States has contacted the Lebanese government, key
European allies, Arab friends, the Soviet Union and Syria to
express support for Hrawi and ``our wish that the process of
reconciliation continue through peaceful means.''
   She also said Thursday that U.S. officials believe Aoun should
``step aside in favor of Lebanon's constitutionally sanctioned
government.''
   Syria has 40,000 troops controlling 70 percent of Lebanese
territory. They moved in under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping
mandate, but later became the Moslems' main backers.
   Aoun fought the Syrians for six months this year. An Arab League
cease-fire halted hostilities in September.
   Hrawi said Lebanon's interest would ``best be preserved by
implementing the Taif accord,'' which mainly redistributes power
equally between Christians and Moslems.
   France, the Christians' main protector, on Thursday ordered the
amphibious troop ship, Orace, to sail from Toulon toward Lebanon to
be ready to evacuate French nationals should the security situation
deteriorate. There are 6,000 French nationals in Lebanon, many of
them Lebanese with dual nationality.
   Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, said France has
``contradicting'' policies toward Lebanon.
   ``On the one hand, France declares support for the legitimate
Lebanese authorities, and on the other it does not miss a chance to
show its muscles in the face of the legitimate authorities,'' he
said.
   France had supported Hrawi's election and backed the Arab
League-brokered Taif accord, but 33 right-wing French
parliamentarins visited Lebanon on Wednesday and declared support
for Aoun.
   In Israel, Cabinet Minister Roni Milo said Israel was carefully
following developments in Lebanon after Syrian troop buildups
against Aoun the past few days.
   A Moslem government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said: ``The next 48 hours will be decisive. They will
determine whether Aoun will be dealt with politically or
militarily.''

   James B. Hedlund has been named president of
the Association of Independent Television Stations, replacing
Preston Padden, who has resigned, the association said Thursday.
   Padden, who announced earlier he was becoming senior vice
president, affiliates, for the Fox Broadcasting Co., will remain
with the association until the beginning of the year, INTV Chairman
John A. Serrao said.
   Hedlund, who joined the lobbying organization in 1983, most

will resume his new duties immediately.
   The Milwaukee native formerly was vice president for government
relations at the National Cable Television Association, the cable

   Hedlund also has held positions at the White House Office of
Management and Budget, the Department of Housing and Urban
Development and the House Budget Committee.
   Hedlund faces a full plate of issues as INTV president,
including the organization's campaign to stem the movement of
sports to cable TV and efforts to work out an agreement with cable
representatives on what over-the-air stations must be carried by
cable systems and where the stations are positioned on the TV dial.
   Padden was unsuccessful in reaching a ``must carry'' agreement
with NCTA this year.
   INTV represents more than 180 TV stations nationwide that are
not affiliated with the ABC, CBS or NBC television networks.

<TEXT>
   The terrorist Red Army Faction,
dormant for three years, killed West Germany's most powerful banker
Thursday by blowing apart his armored Mercedes with a
light-sensitive bomb on a bicycle.
   Alfred Herrhausen was chairman of Deutsche Bank, West Germany's
largest, and one of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief economic
advisers.
   Police said the the bicycle-bomb apparently was placed on a
street of this spa town outside Frankfurt, where the 59-year-old
banker lived, and detonated by a sophisticated light-beam device as
he drove by on his way to work.
   They said it was the first time terrorists used such a detonator
in West German.
   Federal criminal police offered a reward of up to $2.2 million,
one of the largest here ever.
   Police with helicopters were searching for two men seen leaving
the area. A stolen white Lancia believed to have been used in the
getaway was found abandoned in a Frankfurt suburb.
   ``For a long time, the Deutsche Bank and Herrhausen in
particular have been targeted by the Red Army Faction,'' said
Hans-Juergen Foerster, spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor's
office. He said the ultraleftists accuse Deutsche Bank of financing
a worldwide ``military-industrial'' complex.
   The explosion, heard three miles away, turned Herrhausen's
armored limousine into a heap of twisted metal and blew out windows
in buildings.
   His driver, Jakob Nix, was seriously injured, but police said
his condition was not critical. Security agents following in
another car were unhurt.
   A letter found at the scene claimed responsibility on behalf of
the Red Army Faction, West Germany's deadliest terrorist group, of
which little had been heard since 1986.
   Foerster said the letter ``was not typical'' of Red Army Faction
claims because it did not explain motives. After previous attacks,
the terrorist group left lengthy statements giving detailed reasons
for the actions.
   He said the letter was signed ``Commando Wolfgang Beer,'' for a
suspect in an investigation of the Red Army Faction, and carried
Faction symbols: a star-shaped symbol and a drawing of a
Kalashnikov assault rifle.
   Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who is in charge of police
and security issues, said protection for prominent figures was
stepped up after a Red Army Faction hunger strike that ended last
April.
   During the fast, one imprisoned terrorist called for increasing
activities ``with all means.''
   Schaeuble told ZDF TV that since then, Red Army Faction
followers are believed operating with more autonomy than before,
when they were guided by a tight-knit structure.
   Chancellor Kohl, his eyes filled with tears and his voice
breaking, condemned the ``cowardly and brutal murder'' of his
personal friend.
   Parliament interrupted debate for five minutes in honor of
Herrhausen.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said, ``We deplore this terrorist act ... and stand ready to assist
in any way that we can.''
   Herrhausen, the best-known figure in West German business, often
advised Kohl and frequently accompanied him on trips abroad. The
tall, striking financier had led Deutsche Bank on an aggressive
expansion aimed at putting it among the world's top 10 or 15 banks.
   He urged more investment in the Soviet Union and other parts of
Eastern Europe. Most recently, he recommended West German
investment in East Germany.
   Deutsche Bank owns large interests in many leading West German
companies, including Daimler-Benz, the largest conglomerate.
Herrhausen arranged the biggest industrial restructuring in West
German history, the merger of Daimler-Benz with aerospace giant
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm.
   The bank under Herrhausen had been preparing for a leading role
as the Common Market moves toward a barrier-free internal market of
1992.
   The bank's efforts to gain a stake in investment banking
culminated this week in the $640 million takeover bid for the
British investment bank Morgan Grenfell Group PLC.
   The banker sat on many company boards, and last year became the
sole chairman of Deutsche Bank, which he joined in 1969.
   The Red Army Faction was born in the 1960s and has a long
history of attacks on West German business and political figures,
as well as U.S. military targets.
   Its last known operations were the murders in 1986 of Karl Heinz
Beckurts of the giant Siemens industrial concern and diplomat
Gerold von Braunmuehl. The Red Army faction was believed connected
with an unsuccessful attempt on the life of Finance Ministry
official Hans Tietmeyer in September 1988.
   Heinrich Boge, head of the federal criminal investigation's
office, said: ``There were never any signs that they had given up,
so we were constantly warning against people writing them off too
quickly.''
   The Red Army faction is believed to have 20 to 30 hard-core
members, aided by dozens of sympathizers. Most of its original
leaders have been killed by police, committed suicide in prison or
are serving long prison sentences.
   Herrhausen's wife and two daughters survive.

<HEAD>EPA Proposes Tighter Controls on Municipal Incinerators</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency proposed
tigher pollution controls Thursday on hundreds of municipal waste
incinerators, including a requirement that at least one-fourth of
all reusable garbage be recycled.
   Although the EPA said the tigher standards would curtail
incinerator emissions by 90 percent within five years, the proposal
was attacked immediately by environmentalists, who said the agency
should require greater recycling.
   The proposal is the first attempt by the federal government to
impose a nationwide standard on toxic chemical releases from
garbage incineration plants, although many communities already have
curbs, some as stringent as those proposed by the EPA.
   There are more than 450 garbage incinerators nationwide with 150
more expected to be built over the next five years as
municipalities increasingly turn to burning garbage as landfill
space becomes scarce.
   ``This proposal will assure that municipal waste incinerators
employ the best demonstrated technology to protect public health
and the environment by reducing air emissions and toxic ash,'' said
William Rosenberg, the assistant EPA administrator for air and
radiation.
   Rosenberg said a final regulation is expected to be issued
within a year.
   Federal regulations currently place restrictions only on dust
emissions from the burning of garbage, although many states and
localities have toxic pollution controls as well.
   The additional pollution control equipment was estimated to
amount to an added cost of about $20 a year for every household
served by a garbage incineration plant, EPA officials said.
   Many environmentalists have accused the EPA of putting too much
emphasis on incineration in dealing with the mounting garbage
problem and not giving enough attention to recycling. They argue
that even with the tighter controls some unhealthy levels of toxic
air emissions will persist and the disposal of toxic ash will
continue to pose a threat to groundwater and soil when it is buried.
   Arguing that as much as 80 percent of the garbage can be
recycled, consumer activist Ralph Nader called the EPA's 25 percent
target a ``token recycling effort'' designed to ``provide a cloak
of environmental legitimacy for incineration programs.'' Nader said
all burning of municipal garbage should be banned.
   ``The 25 percent goal will not even begin to solve the garbage
crisis,'' added Larry Shapiro of the New York Public Interest
Research Group, another environmental organization that has
campaigned against gargage burning.
   Allen Hershkowitz, an expert on solid waste issues for the
Natural Resources Defense Council, called the EPA proposal ``a
positive first step'' but said its recycling requirement is ``far
too modest.''
   Rosenberg said that while the EPA proposed the 25 percent
recycling target, the agency has not ruled out the possiblity that
the percentage will be increased when a final regulation is issued.
   The EPA proposal calls for air emission standards for both
existing incinerators and for ones still on the drawing board.
   It would require incinerator operators to install scrubbers and
other technology that would reduce emissions of toxic metals such
as lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic and chromium by as much as 99
percent; organic chemicals such as dioxins and furans by 99
percent; and acid gases such as sulfur dioxide and hydrogen
chlordie by 90 to 95 percent.
   The agency also would require tighter operating standards to
ensure optimum combustion to reduce pollution and prohibit the
burning of lead-acid batteries, which are the source of an
estimated 60 percent of the lead emissions and residues coming from
incinerators.

<HEAD>Harvard Pollution Study is Target of NIH Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Institutes of Health is
investigating procedures used in a study that helps set national
air pollution standards amid allegations thata Harvard professor
ignored errors in the research, the university said Thursday.
   The NIH inquiry concerns the ``Six Cities'' study, which has
been conducted at Harvard since 1974 to monitor the effects of air
pollution, said Harvard spokesman Peter Costa.
   Armando Garsd, a former statistician at Harvard, told The Wall
Street Journal that he was dismissed from a research post in 1986
after he disclosed errors in the study to John Spengler, one of the
professors working on the project.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency uses the information to
set national air emission standards.
   ``They are checking some of the procedures and the data
collection,'' Costa said.
   The action is the latest in a series of incidents that have
raised questions about research integrity at Harvard and other
academic institutions. Last year, a Harvard Medical School
professor was forced to resign because of charges of plagiarism.
   Spengler was out of town Thursday and could not be reached for
comment. But Costa, reading from a statement, said: ``We have
absolutely no reason to believe that there is any evidence of
scientific misconduct. We have every reason to believe that
malevolence has led to the repetition of frivolous allegations.''
   Costa said the NIH inquiry apparently grew from the original
allegations by Garsd, which he attributed to ``ill feeling'' from
the ex-employee.
   Suzanne Hadley, acting director of the NIH's Office of
Scientific Integrity in Washington, said she could neither confirm
nor deny the existence of an inquiry.
   Speaking in general terms, however, she said an inquiry is a
fact-finding process, in which officials determine if a formal
investigation should be conducted into allegations of scientific
misconduct.
   Garsd, who has sued Harvard in a state court for alleged
wrongful dismissal, now works for the Food and Drug Administration
in Washington. He declined to comment on the case Thursday.
   But Garsd told The Harvard Crimson in November 1988 that he sent
several memos to Spengler, one of the professors working on the
project, but received no response.
   And in a previous interview with The Wall Street Journal, Garsd
said he found errors, including mistakes already published in
journals and other scientific literature, that misstated the levels
of certain air pollutants in the cities being studied by up to 20
percent.
   Garsd told the newspaper he had not contacted the NIH and had
been unaware of the inquiry.
   Spengler has said that any errors discovered by Garsd were
corrected and didn't appear in print, the Journal reported.

<TEXT>
   Mutinous soldiers seized air force
headquarters and two broadcast stations early Friday in an attempt
to overthrow President Corazon Aquino, and a plane bombed the
presidential palace compound.
   Mrs. Aquino vowed to smash the ``shameless and naked attempt,''
one of the most serious since a civilian-military uprising swept
her to power in February 1986 and forced the late President
Ferdinand E. Marcos into exile.
   A T-28 aircraft dropped two bombs in the compound of Malacanang
Palace at about 6:30 a.m. (5:30 p.m. EST Thursday) and presidential
guards responded with small arms fire.
   ``They're bombing us!'' a palace staff member cried over the
telephone. ``We're going down!''
   Lourdes Sytangco, the deputy presidential spokeswoman, said Mrs.
Aquino was safe. Ms. Sytangco said she could not give a damage
report because no one could leave the building.
   Radio station DZRH, reporting from the palace, said three people
were killed.
   The government appealed to all mayors to mobilize local police
forces, and Mrs. Aquino asked Filipinos earlier Friday to ``support
our democracy in this hour of challenge.''
   ``An attempt to seize power by force is again being made at this
moment,'' she said in a nationally televised address. ``Our forces
have the situation under control. We shall smash this shameless and
naked attempt once more.''
   ``This nation must never be allowed to fall unto the hand of
tyrants,'' she said. ``God is with us and we shall prevail. Those
who wish to be kings are here once more, despite repeated
rejections by the people.''
   Cardinal Jaime Sin, Roman Catholic archbishop of Manila, urged
his countrymen ``to support the duly constituted authority'' and
the soldiers to end their rebellion ``in the name of God.''
   Gen. Renato de Villa, military chief of staff, acknowleged that
rebels had seized Villamor Air Base, headquarters of the Philippine
air force; the government broadcast center; a private television
station; and the Ninoy Aquino International Airport.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said U.S.
officials had only sketchy information and ``we're watching it
closely. ... We're very concerned about it and we continue to
support the democratically elected government of Mrs. Aquino.''
   There was no indication who was leading the mutiny, and rebel
soldiers would not say. They were believed loyal to renegade Lt.
Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, who led an August 1987 coup
attempt in which at least 53 people were killed.
   Soon after dawn, pro-government troops opened fire with
recoilless rifles on rebels near the government broadcast center
and rebels returned the fire, blocking the road with trucks. No
casualty reports were available.
   Scattered shooting was reported at Villamor, near the airport.
Soldiers sealed off several of Manila's main avenues.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said the rebellion began shortly
after midnight when about 200 Marines tried to enter Villamor.
About two hours later, air force troops who had been guarding the
gate left their posts and mutinous Marines took over security at
the base perimeter.
   Rebels fired heavy weapons at the headquarters of the 205th
Helicopter Wing, setting fire to the building.
   One Marine captain, who refused to give his name, said about
2,000 troops were involved in the sixth attempt to overthrow Mrs.
Aquino since she took office.
   Truckloads of mutineers, wearing white arm bands and carrying
red flags, entered the government radio and television station and
the adjacent private station ABS-CBN. Pro-government troops
surrounded the compound, but later withdrew, and the mutineers
allowed civilian staff to leave.
   The significance of the red and white colors was not clear.
   After sunrise Friday, rebel troops deployed along the major
expressway leading to southeastern Luzon.
   Honasan escaped from prison last year and remains at large. He
gave clandestine interviews about a week ago warning Mrs. Aquino of
impending trouble.
   Reinforcements took up positions during the night around Mrs.
Aquino's residence and her office at nearby Malacanang Palace.
Tanks and trucks blocked the main street that runs by the palace.
   De Villa told reporters late Thursday mutineers apparently
planned a full-scale coup attempt Friday, ``and for this reason I
have placed all units in the affected areas in full alert status.''
   He said the plot was discovered after 13 members of the army's
elite Scout Rangers late Wednesday sabotaged two communications
transmitters 30 miles south of Manila.
   Col. Jesus Ranjo, chief of staff of the National Capital Region
Defense Command, said all 13 were in custody at Fort Bonifacio,
headquarters of the Philippine army. Ranjo said three other
officers were being sought.
   According to De Villa, the plot included plans to seize Mactan
International Airport in Cebu, 350 miles south of Manila, and may
have involved units in central Luzon and northern Mindanao.
   Rumors of a new coup attempt swept Manila last month after a
dispute over plans to reorganize the Philippine Constabulary.
   Congress is considering a proposal to abolish the Constabulary,
a branch of the armed forces, and replace it with a
civilian-controlled national police.
   Constabulary generals would be barred from joining the new
force. Constabulary troops have staged protests in Manila and Cebu
against the reorganization plan.
   Public discontent with the Aquino government has been growing
because of rising prices, a critical shortage of electricity in
Manila, allegations of corruption and the deterioration of the
city's transport system.
   Honasan's coup attempt in August 1987 was the bloodiest and most
dangerous of the half-dozen revolts against Mrs. Aquino. The
colonel played a key role in the military mutiny that started the
uprising against Marcos, who died in exile in Hawaii on Sept. 28.
   He became disenchanted with Mrs. Aquino, however, accusing her
of failing to crush Communist rebels and rid the government of
corruption.
   He was arrested in December 1987, but escaped from a prison ship
in Manila Bay the next April.

   A police officer who shot a black motorcyclist
testified in his own defense Thursday, telling jurors he fired only
because he thought he was about to die.
   ``He just came straight at me and he just revved the
motorcycle,'' officer William Lozano, 31, testified. ``He was just
aiming at me. I was just only able to turn my body, draw my gun and
shoot.''
   The testimony was broadcast live on television and radio in
Miami, where three days of racial violence broke out following the
Jan. 16 shooting. Cable News Network carried Lozano's testimony
live nationally.
   Twice before in this decade, innocent verdicts favoring
policemen accused of killing blacks have led to rioting, and the
Miami and Metro-Dade police forces are on alert for renewed
violence.
   Prosecution witnesses testified that the Hispanic officer, who
faces two counts of manslaughter in the deaths of the motorcyclist
and a passenger, coolly took aim and fired as the bike was about to
speed past him while being pursued by a police car.
   The defense was expected to put on one more technical witness
Friday, after which rebuttal witnesses were scheduled. Court
officials have not said when they expect the case to go to the jury.
   Lozano told the court he did not see the motorcycle until the
last second because his attention was on the lights of the
approaching squad car. He said he spotted the bike only after it
crossed into the traffic lane where he stood.
   Lozano's attorney Roy Black asked how close the motorcycle came.
   ``(So) close that I thought I might die, that I was going to be
run over and I was going to die,'' the Colombian-born officer said
with a light Spanish accent. ``I feared for my life.''
   Lozano, who has served with the department for five years,
described how the situation quickly degenerated as an angry crowd
gathered around the two victims. The bullet struck the driver
Clement Lloyd, 23, in the head, killing him instantly. Lloyd's
passenger Allan Blanchard, 24, died the next day of head injuries
suffered in the subsequent crash.
   ``I was a target for every person there,'' Lozano testified,
saying he was ``getting hit right and left'' by rocks and bottles
at one point.
   On cross-examination, prosecutors picked away at Lozano's
testimony that he did not see the oncoming motorcycle until just
before he drew and fired.
   Assistant State Attorney John Hogan pointed to testimony from
two officers who interviewed Lozano just after the incident. They
said he told them he entered the street because he ``became aware''
a police car was chasing a motorcycle.
   ``I don't recall,'' Lozano answered repeatedly when asked if he
had given different versions of the shooting to his supervisor and
a homicide detective. He flatly denied some of their accounts,
which stated he had even acted out the shooting.
   Hogan ridiculed Lozano's testimony about his awareness of the
motorcycle by pointing to other witnesses _ including the officer's
partner, Dawn Campbell _ who said they heard a motorcyle speeding
loudly up the street.
   ``No, I did not hear the motorcycle,'' Lozano insisted. ``I
never heard it coming.''
   The prosecution had shown photos of Lozano and Ms. Campbell
together earlier in the trial to suggest they had concocted the
story that the motorcycle almost hit him. Lozano testified the
photos were taken at the scene of a minor accident that occurred
after the shooting, and said he and Ms. Campbell had never
discussed the shooting.
   ``You asked Dawn Campbell to lie for you that night, didn't
you,'' Hogan challenged.
   ``No, I never spoke to Dawn Campbell that night,'' Lozano said,
adding ``Not about lying.''
   Expert defense witnesses have attempted to counter testimony for
the prosecution that Lozano violated Miami police policy when he
failed to step out of the roadway, and then fired at a moving
vehicle.
   When the case opened Oct. 23, the defense attempted
unsuccessfully to move the trial, arguing that Miami juries will be
too worried about renewed violence to acquit Lozano. The defense
also lost a battle to challenge a black juror.
   The final six-member jury consists of two blacks, one Hispanic
and three non-Hispanic white jurors, as well as two Hispanic and
two non-Hispanic white alternates.

   The jury that convicted Rep. Donald Lukens
for having sex with an underage girl should have been allowed to
review her school and juvenile records, the congressman's attorney
told an appeals court Thursday.
   The prosecution contended that the girl's past was irrelevant to
the case against the 58-year-old Republican.
    After hearing 40 minutes of argument in Lukens' bid to overturn
the conviction, a three-judge panel of the 10th Ohio District Court
of Appeals took the case under advisement. It could take several
months for the court to rule.
   Lukens was convicted May 26 in Franklin County Domestic
Relations Court on a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the
unruliness of Rosie Coffman. She testified that in November 1988,
when she was 16, Lukens paid her to have sex with him at his
Columbus apartment.
   Judge Ronald Solove would not let Lukens' attorney, Thomas
Tyack, introduce Ms. Coffman's school and juvenile records into
evidence at the trial.
   Tyack said he has not seen the girl's juvenile record, but it
would have given the court a chance to determine Ms. Coffman's
credibility and motive. He said her school records show she had a
tendency to fantasize, often defied authority and had exhibited
psychological problems.
   He also argued that Solove's instacross the three branches of the
federal government; and not unreasonably restrictive so as to
discourage able citizens from entering public service.''

   The State Department denied on Thursday that
the crash of a CIA plane in Angola indicated the United States was
acting like the Nicaraguan government it has accused of helping
leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler refused to confirm
publicly, as other officials have said privately, that the plane
was on a covert CIA mission to resupply Angolan rebels.
   However, she responded to suggestions at a news briefing of a
parallel between the crash and a similar incident over the weekend
involving equipment that U.S. and Salvadoran officials say had been
earmarked by Nicaragua for leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   ``I would point out to you the fact that there is a regional
peace agreement signed by Nicaragua, committing the signatories not
to support subversion of neighboring countries. The Nicaraguans are
clearly violating this obligation,'' she said.
   This was a reference to the twin-engined Cessna that went down
last Saturday in El Salvador while carrying surface-to-air missiles
and other equipment. The Salvadoran government and the State
Department charged that the plane originated in Nicaragua but
Sandinista authorities denied that.
   On Wednesday, U.S. officials said an L-100 cargo plane flying
from a military base in Zaire crashed while carrying supplies to
rebels fighting Angola's leftist government.
   They said a huge fireball was created on impact, suggesting that
the plane was carrying large quantities of weapons.
   The State Department said all four Americans on board are
believed to have died. The plane crashed not far from the UNITA
rebel headquarters in southeastern Angola.
   The Angolan government issued a statement Wednesday confirming
the crash but gave no new details. U.S. officials, noting that the
crash took place in rebel-held territory, said it was doubtful the
Angolan government had any independent information about the
incident.
   The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Africa subcommittee,
Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., said he hoped the crash and its
``wholly unnecessary loss of lives'' would prompt the Bush
administration to reconsider its policy of supplying weapons to
UNITA.
   Covert U.S. support for the war ``runs counter to our diplomatic
efforts'' in the region and undermines the credibility of both the
United States and Zaire when they seek peaceful solutions to the
conflict, Wolpe said.
   Improving U.S.-Soviet relations have provided new opportunities
for diplomacy around the world, Wolpe noted. But he added: ``I
don't think our policy in Angola has caught up with the changing
dynamic.''
   The Angolan statement used the occasion of the crash to accuse
UNITA of showing no interest in a peaceful settlement to their
14-year old conflict.
   The statement said that the country's Roman Catholic bishops had
indicated support for the UNITA position by calling for a
cease-fire and free elections, but that the plane incident showed
who really wanted peace in Angola.
   The Bush administration also has been an advocate of free
elections as the best hope for a peaceful outcome in Angola.
   U.S. officials said that President Bush, in his discussions with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev this weekend, is expected to
press for that option rather than engage in debate over aid levels
to the opposing factions in Angola.
   According to some estimates, the Soviets have been providing
$800 million a year to the Angolans while U.S. assistance for the
rebel forces is said to be in the $40 million to $50 million range.

   The Solar Maximum satellite lost about 20
miles altitude in a 24-hour period Thursday, prompting the U.S.
Space Command to predict that it will fall to Earth about 10:45
p.m. EST on Friday.
   Most of the satellite will burn up in the atmosphere but up to a
dozen larger pieces, weighing up to 100 pounds, may survive.
Officials weren't ready to say in what part of the satellite's
track they might come to Earth.
   ``We can't predict because there is about a six-hour margin of
error in our calculations,'' said Capt. Thomas Niemann, spokesman
for the space command. ``That's four orbits of Earth.''
   More than 80 percent of the satellite's path is over water and
the chances of debris hitting anyone are considered remote. The
only parts of the United States under Solar Max's ground track are
South Florida and the extreme southern parts of Texas, and Hawaii.
   Solar Max, which has been studying the sun for nearly 10 years,
exhausted its positioning fuel recently and has been tumbling. Its
electricity-producing solar panels and antenna were jettisoned by
radioed command late last week.
   On Thursday, Solar Max was orbiting the globe every 88.4
minutes. When that period is down to 87.5 minutes, the satellite
will be near enough to be slowed by the thickening atmosphere and
pulled in by gravity.

<HEAD>Cocaine Addicts Risk Heart Attacks Even After Withdrawal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cocaine addicts are in danger of suffering
heart attacks even for a few weeks after they stop taking the drug,
a group of Los Angeles researchers reported.
   Researchers from the West Los Angeles Veterans Administration
and UCLA report that the effects of cocaine may linger after
withdrawal, altering the balance of chemicals in the brain that
direct the cardiovascular system.
   Other scientists studying how cocaine affects the heart said the
report offers ``compelling'' evidence of the risk of heart attacks
and may have implications for drug treatment.
   The report appears in the Philadelphia-based journal Annals of
Internal Medicine in the issue being published Friday.
   Young abusers often experience fatal heart attacks while using
cocaine. The 1986 deaths of University of Maryland basketball star
Len Bias and Cleveland Browns football player Don Rogers were both
ascribed to cocaine-induced heart failure.
   But the Los Angeles study, which measured the heart function of
21 men who were in a substance abuse treatment program, discovered
that addicts may experience abnormal heart activity for as long as
four weeks after quitting cocaine.
   The report's lead author, Dr. Koonlawee Nademanee of the VA
medical center, warned that the first few weeks after withdrawal
are crucial.
   ``I feel that during withdrawal, patients should be carefully
monitored. The most important thing is to make sure the patient is
completely abstinent from the drug,'' he said.
   The researchers found that eight of the 21 subjects had episodes
of abnormal blood flow to the heart. They speculated that cocaine
had upset the balance of chemicals in the brain that prevent the
arteries from undergoing spasms, making heart attacks more likely.
   A heart attack causes the death of part of the heart muscle. It
occurs when arteries that are narrowed or blocked keep a section of
the heart from getting enough oxygen, which is carried in the blood.
   Cocaine restricts blood supply to the heart while increasing the
heart rate, blood pressure and demand for oxygen.
   ``This is the strongest evidence to date that cocaine may cause
spasming of the coronary arteries,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Isner, a
cardiovascular medicine professor at Boston's Tufts University.
``This really is incontrovertible evidence,'' he said, calling the
study a ``spectacular report.''
   But Douglas Wilkerson, who studies the cardiovascular effects of
cocaine at the Medical College of Ohio, cautioned that researchers
do not have enough evidence to attribute the heart attacks to
spasms of the arteries.
   Some scientists argue that the heart attacks could be caused
instead by clots forming in the arteries or simply by blood flow
inadequate to the heart's demand, he said.
   One member of the Los Angeles group, Dr. David Gorelick, now
with the National Institute of Drug Abuse, said the group ruled out
heart disease as the cause of the temporary heart abnormalities in
the subjects.
   ``With longer periods of abstinence from cocaine, the (blood
flow) went back to normal,'' he said.
   The report has immediate impact on how emergency room physicians
will treat addicts experiencing chest pains, according to Dr.
William Spivey, chief of emergency room research at the Medical
College of Pennsylvania.
   ``It's going to make us realize that we're going to have
problems (after withdrawal) with these cocaine addicts,'' said
Spivey.
   The study ``opens our eyes'' to the value of preventive medical
treatment for addicts withdrawing from cocaine, said Dr. Gary
Schaer, a cardiologist at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical
Center in Chicago.
   An estimated 25 million Americans have used cocaine at least
once, including 6 million regular users and 1 million addicts,
according to Isner.
   Gorelick said the Los Angeles scientists now plan to focus on
how cocaine use alters the chemicals in the brain to reduce the
flow of blood to the heart and use other, more precise tests to
examine heart function in cocaine addicts.

<HEAD>Excerpts from Mikhail Gorbachev's Speech at Rome's City Hall</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gorbachev, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following are excerpts from the official
English-language text of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
speech Thursday evening at the Campidoglio, Rome's city hall:
   ``Our time is indeed a watershed of destiny. ... We need
spiritual values. ... We need a revolution of the mind. ...
   Of late, there has been much talk in the West that the world
community will really become a single whole only if the `other
side,' i.e. the Soviet Union, abandons its ideological and social
values. Frankly, we are often told that we should purely and simply
renounce socialism. Then, it is said, the world will become a nice
and easy place to live in. It may sound simplistic, but I am
deliberately reducing the argument to its essence.
   This is not the approach that the world needs as it is taking a
great turn to a new era. It is another example of wishful thinking
of the temptation to make policies on the basis of illusions rather
than reality. ...
   We have abandoned the claim to have a monopoly on the truth; we
no longer think that we are the best and that we are always right,
that those who disagree with us are our enemies. We have now
decided, firmly and irrevocably, to base our policy on the
principles of freedom of choice, to build our economy and
technology on the principle of mutual advantage, and to develop our
culture and ideology through dialogue and acceptance of all that is
applicable in our conditions, and hence, all that should be
digested and used for our own progress. ...
   Unless we get rid of all things associated with the deformations
of socialism in the past, we will not succeed in implementing the
ideas of perestroika. ...
   We want to give second wind to the Soviet federation. Quite
frankly, it will take deft handling. For inter-ethnic relations is
a fragile and delicate sphere. But perestroika will enable us to
solve this problem, crucial for the future of our state.
   We have changed our attitude to some matters _ such as, for
example, religion _ which, admittedly, we used to treat in a
simplistic manner. ...
   But now we not only proceed from the assumption that no one
should interfere in matters of the individual's conscience; we also
say that the moral values which religion generated and embodied for
centuries can help in the work of renewal in our country, too. ...
   Today, the focus is on the socialist world. Having embarked upon
the road of radical reform, the socialist countries, one after
another, are crossing the line beyond which there is no return to
the past.
   Nevertheless, it is wrong to insist, as many in the West do,
that this is the collapse of socialism, the end of the socialist
system. On the contrary, it means that the socialist process in the
world, having accumulated extensive, although admittedly dramatic
experience, will pursue its further development in a multiplicity
of forms. It will thus acquire new opportunities for moving toward
its just and noble goals, for releasing the enormous humanistic and
democratic potential contained in the socialist idea. ...
   Let us leave it to experts in anti-communist propaganda to
rejoice in the `triumph of capitalism' in the Cold War. ...
   We hope that next year all European countries, the United States
and Canada will sign a historic document which will begin a new
countdown in the area of military policy. ...
   My meeting with President George Bush will, I am convinced,
enable us to take a new constructive step in the movement `from
mutual understanding to mutual action' in Soviet-US relations. ...
   I believe that this year's events underscore the desirability of
an all-European summit, a Helsinki-2 meeting. We could consider
advancing its date from 1992 to, say, as early as 1990. ...
   In the final analysis we envision Europe as a commonwealth of
sovereign democratic states with a high level of equitable
interdependence and easily accessible borders open to the exchange
of products, technologies and ideas and wide-ranging contacts among
people.''

<HEAD>As Airport Hotel Has Grand Opening, Radar Dispute Renewed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hotel built too close to an airport
radar because of a typographical error had its grand opening
Thursday, renewing air traffic controllers' complaints that it
blocks some radar coverage.
   The controllers dispute the government's claim that keeping
planes at high altitudes above the blind spot is a temporary
solution.
   ``It's just as bad if not worse,'' said Cheryl Readio, a member
of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. ``We still
can't see airplanes in that area.''
   Controllers said they would like to see the Federal Aviation
Administration make a stronger response to an ``unsatisfactory
condition report'' filed in May. At the time, controllers noticed
that as the six-story Quality Suites hotel went up, more and more
planes began disappearing from the radar screen.
   The FAA conducted tests that showed gaps in radar coverage up to
about 2,000 feet in a corridor of air space up to seven miles wide
and extending about 25 to 35 miles southwest of Portland
International Jetport.
   Until the radar can be moved, the agency adopted interim
guidelines under which airplanes going through the area are kept
well above 2,000 feet, said Walter Claxton, FAA tower manager at
the airport.
   ``I can't say the problem is completely solved,'' Claxton said.
``We set up the interim procedures until the problem is solved. If
it was a real safety issue, the radar would have been moved two
months ago, or we'd put a new one in.''
   Claxton said only small planes are affected, because larger
planes are not flying that low when they are 30 miles out.
   Jim Breen, the New England representative of the air traffic
controllers association, said controllers also have to keep
jetliners out of the area even if they are at a high altitude
because pilots cannot be advised about what might be flying under
them.
   Ms. Readio said commercial flights from Boston often go near the
area, and controllers have to make sure they stay away from the
blind spot.
   ``We can't tell them what's there,'' Breen said from Bradley
International Airport, just north of Hartford, Conn. ``The system
could be safer by getting this radar moved soon.''
   Claxton said the radar might be moved within the next year.
   ``We're going to move the radar,'' Claxton said. ``Where we're
going to move it, I'm not sure. It kind of sits low on the airport,
and things were fine until the building came along.''
   The FAA said it never objected to the hotel construction because
when the project was first proposed, the developer's plans
contained a typo that indicated the building would be 12,000 feet
from the runway when it was in fact just 1,200 feet from the runway.
   Breen blames the FAA for the mixup.
   ``Twelve-hundred feet and 12,000 feet are quite a bit
different,'' Breen said. ``Typo or not, you'd think somebody would
have noticed it.''

including plane tickets, were also taken, with the total loss
valued at $19,000, police said.

   Light snow was scattered across much of the Northeast on
Thursday, with nearly a foot of snow at a New York state ``snow
belt'' town, and temperatures fell well below zero in the northern
Rockies.
   Snow showers were scattered over northern Maine, Vermont, the
northwestern two-thirds of New York state, the northwestern third
of Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, northern Lower Michigan, eastern
Upper Michigan, and northeastern Minnesota,
   The small upstate New York community of Barnes Corners, about 10
miles south of Watertown, had 10 inches of new snow. The town is in
a ``snow belt'' downwind of Lake Ontario, whose moisture
contributes to ``lake effect snow.'' Watertown got 6 inches of snow
between 7 a.m. and noon, the National Weather Service reported.
   In western New York state, Springville had 5 inches of new snow.
   Elsewhere, snow was scattered over northwestern New Mexico. And
near San Angelo, Texas, less than an inch of snow fell overnight
across the Concho Valley, leaving patches of ice on roads and
highways in the morning.
   Rain was scattered from northwestern Texas across central Texas
and the central half of the Texas Gulf Coast.
   South of Florida, tropical storm Karen dumped heavy rain on
Cuba, with 14 inches in 24 hours at Punte del Este on the Isle of
Youth, the weather service said.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 6
degrees at Jackson, Wyo., to 75 at Miami.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 12 degrees below zero
at West Yellowstone, Mont.

<TEXT>
   A former CIA agent who fled to the Soviet
Union just before he was charged with passing secrets was recently
ordered expelled from Hungary, U.S. officials said Thursday.
   The U.S. government urged Hungary to permanently bar Edward Lee
Howard, a defector wanted on an espionage charge who has made
extended visits to the eastern block country, said the officials,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In 1985, Howard eluded FBI surveillance near his home in Santa
Fe, N.M., and fled the country two days before he was charged in a
warrant with passing secrets to the Soviet Union.
   He later turned up in Moscow and the Soviet Union announced
nearly a year after his defection that it had given Howard
political asylum.
   Howard, 37, is charged with selling secrets to the Soviet Union
for $6,000 in 1984 during a trip to Austria.
   He is said to have exposed the network of CIA contacts in
Moscow, a spy post for which he was trained but never assigned to
because he was fired in 1983.
   ``He certainly gave away the entire CIA operation in Moscow,''
said David Wise, author of the 1988 book about the Howard case
entitled ``The Spy Who Got Away.'' Wise reported in the book that
Howard was paid more than $150,000.
   One official confirmed that Howard was still in the Soviet bloc.
Wise said Howard was probably in Moscow where he has an apartment
and a nearby summer house.
   Besides exposing dead-drop locations and codes the CIA employed
to contact Soviet contacts, Wise said Howard exposed details of
electronic eavesdropping the agency conducted in the Soviet capital.
   ``There wasn't much he didn't give up,'' Wise said.
   CIA Director William Webster made a veiled reference to Howard's
expulsion when asked by reporters Wednesday about cooperation
between intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union and Eastern bloc
nations.
   Webster cited the case of a ``a prominent defector from the
United States (who) was permanently expelled from a bloc country
which had provided him comfort and sanctuary in the past.''
   ``And that would have been contrary to the wishes of the KGB,''
said Webster, who didn't identify Howard or the country by name.
   But the U.S. officials confirmed a report in Thursday's editions
of the Los Angeles Times that Webster was referring to Howard's
expulsion from Hungary.
   Asked about the report, Hungarian Interior Ministry spokesman
Lt. Col. Janos Horvach said in a telephone interview, ``It's news
to me.''
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel refused to comment
about the case.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh met with Howard's handler
during a recent visit to Moscow.
   Thornburgh met with Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, who was the No. 2 KBG
official at the time he was directing Howard. Runkel said the
Howard case was not discussed during the meeting at KGB
headquarters.
   The meeting was scheduled ``only to talk about areas where there
could be discussion on cooperation in the law enforcement area,''
including efforts to combat terrorism, Runkel said.
   Wise, who interviewed Howard for his book during a visit to
Hungary, said the former CIA agent spent a lot of time in that
country, enjoying visits to Budapest and Lake Bolatov, a resort
area.
   ``I would doubt if he would set foot in the West'' for fear of
being snatched by U.S. agents, Wise said. Howard was even nervous
about visiting Budapest, where he feared the CIA could inject a
tranquilizer in his arm and spirit him across the Austrian border,
Wise said.
   Given the current political climate in Eastern Europe, Wise said
it is most likely that Howard has returned to the Soviet Union,
where he would feel safe from U.S. efforts to arrest him.
   While Howard would not be subject to extradition from a Western
country because espionage is a political crime, Wise pointed out
that he might feel threatened by the new overseas snatch authority
conferred on the FBI.
   A legal opinion issued last June by the Justice Department said
that the FBI had the legal authority to seize U.S. fugitives
overseas without the permission of a foreign government.
   Wise reported in his book that Howard was paid handsomely for
his spying by the Soviets. Howard had $150,000 in a Swiss bank
account before he defected and afterwards, his wife, Mary, led FBI
agents to a spot in the New Mexico desert where her husband had
buried $10,000 worth of gold and other valuables.
   Howard's wife, who lives in the Minneapolis area with the
couple's son, could not be reached for comment.

<HEAD>AMA Issues Patient ``Bill of Rights''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SARAH NORDGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patients have a right to basic health care from
attentive, courteous doctors who tell them their choices for
treatment, according to the American Medical Association's first
``Patient Bill of Rights.''
   In a brief list of six principles, the nation's largest
physicians' organization spells out the responsibilities doctors
have to those who seek their help.
   The document issued Thursday is being presented for approval at
next week's meeting in Honolulu of the AMA's House of Delegates.
   The bill is a ``reaffirmation of what is inherent in the
relationship of physician to patient,'' the AMA's general counsel,
Kirk Johnson, said in a telephone interview Thursday.
   ``It is coming now not because physicians need to be reminded''
of their responsibilities, he said, but because patients need to
``know and retain their trust in the basic elements of their
relationship with their physician.''
   Johnson said the bill of rights was devised over the past year
by the association's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs. The
House of Delegates may accept it as is, or send it back to the
council for further explanation, he said.
   The bill of rights is ``something that patients can understand _
simple, straightforward and the minimum that patients can expect
from their physicians,'' he said.
   It includes a patient's ``right to essential health care''
regardless of ability to pay and suggests in an attached commentary
that ``physicians have a responsibility to provide some
uncompensated care to the indigent.''
   A critic of the AMA immediately took issue with the document,
saying that in many ways, the AMA circumvents the bill's intent in
its everyday actions.
   ``These are sort of apple pie, motherhood ideas, rights, which
none could disagree with,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of
Public Citzen Health Research Group.
   ``There are two main problems: They (the principles) aren't
enforceable and many of them run completely contrary to what the
AMA does and stands for,'' said Wolfe, whose group, a
Washington-based consumer health research and advocacy
organization, is in its 18th year.
   ``If they took action to ensure that these rights were
translated into results for patients, it would be another thing.
   ``The AMA has hardly been at the forefront ... in ensuring that,
for example, patients have access to information showing
differences between hospitals and doctors.''
   Johnson discounted the criticism, saying the bill of rights is
``valuable and needed.''
   Patients, the document says, have the right to receive
information and know the ``benefits, risks and financial costs'' of
their treatment. They also have the right to make their own
decisions on the treatment of their illness, it says.
   ``The patient has the right to courtesy, respect, dignity,
responsiveness and timely attention,'' according to one article of
the bill, which adds: ``Physicians have an obligation to schedule
their appointments ... in a way that respects the value of the
patient's time.''
   The document's final principle says a patient ``has the right to
continuity of health care.'' According to the attached commentary,
``The physician may not discontinue treatment of a patient as long
as further treatment is medically indicated, unless alternative
arrangements are available.''

Godoy of his immunity from prosecution as a deputy, opening the way
for possible charges of mismanagement.
   Even before the vote, Godoy scoffed at the procedure. He called
it part of a leftist Sandinista plot to discredit him as vice
presidential candidate of the National Opposition Union and weaken
the anti-government bloc.
   The 14-party bloc is the major rival of the ruling Sandinista
National Liberation Front in Feb. 25 elections.
   ``What they have done today is a farce, and farces are performed
by humbugs,'' Godoy said after the vote, which he boycotted.
   Sandinistas hold 61 of the 96 seats in the single-house
legislature. Deputies from six opposition parties hold the
remaining 35 seats.
   Godoy is president of the Liberal Independent Party and one of
its nine deputies in the assembly.
   The measure to strip him of his parliamentary immunity passed
61-1, with one abstention. A Conservative Democrat Party deputy
voted against. A deputy belonging to a Liberal faction opposed to
Godoy abstained.
   Thirty-three deputies were absent, including 21 opposition
deputies.
   Accusations focus on items and about $60,000 donated to a
Godoy-directed research center by the Friedrich-Naumann Foundation,
based in Bonn, West Germany.
   The foundation said it was satisfied with how its donations were
managed and called questions about the management ``baseless.''
   Godoy says members of a rival Liberal faction who questioned the
center's handling of donations were put up to it by the Sandinistas.

   Testimony by survivors of the nation's
worst drunken driving accident concluded Thursday with several
badly burned teen-agers weeping as they detailed the horrible
aftermath of the bus crash.
   A weekend recess was called after the sixth day of testimony in
the trial of Larry Mahoney, 36, charged with murder and drunken
driving in the fiery crash on May 14, 1988, south of this Ohio
River town.
   Christy Pearman, 15, testified she cried out for her father,
John R. Pearman, who was driving the First Assembly of God church
bus, as she struggled to escape the heavy smoke and flames inside.
   ``I turned around to see my dad and I saw the fire,'' she
testified. ``I was standing in the aisle, yelling for my dad.'' He
did not survive.
   Miss Pearman said she was trapped in her eighth-row window seat
in the crush of panicked teen-agers making their way to a rear
emergency door. She managed to free herself and began climbing over
a bus seat to escape.
   ``The seat was so hot it melted my right palm,'' she said.
   Twenty-seven people died in the fire and 40 survived, but some
with disfiguring burns.
   Carroll Circuit Court Judge Charles Satterwhite called a
15-minute recess after Ciaran Foran, 16, of Radcliff broke down in
sobs during testimony.
   Miss Foran sobbed heavily when asked by Assistant Attorney
General Paul Richwalksy Jr. to describe what she had seen seconds
after the bus collided with a wrong-way driver on Interstate 71.
   Some jurors turned their eyes away from Miss Foran, who was
wearing a special pressure garment to assist healing of severe
burns on her neck, face and shoulder.
   After the unscheduled break, Miss Foran testified that her head
was resting on a plastic helium balloon that blew up in her face
after the crash. Miss Foran spent about six weeks in a hospital and
underwent 19 operations.
   Also testifying was Joseph Percefull, 16, who suffered first-and
second-degree burns to his arm, legs, wrists and face.
   Percefull, who escaped through a crowded rear emergency door,
told the court he saw his ``skin from the heat _ it rolled up on my
arm.'' He also said he heard a sound like a match thrown on
gasoline seconds after the collision.
   Other survivors told of falling unconscious as they were
overcome with smoke and heat inside the bus, and somehow being
pulled from the wreckage. They also told of losing friends inside
the bus.
   Carey Aurentz, 15, of Radcliff, sobbed as she held small color
pictures of Kashawn Etheredge, Jennifer Arnett and Emillie
Thompson, all of whom died in the wreck.
   In the courtroom gallery, family of victims and survivors wiped
at tears and sniffled.
   The pictures were placed on a large seating chart of the bus to
show the jury the exact location of each of the 67 passengers at
the time of the crash. Some of the girls sat on the laps of boys,
and some were lying in the aisle, asleep after a long day at a
Cincinnati-area amusement park, according to testimony.
   Defense attorneys have said that they would argue that it was
defects in the bus, which was manufactured before federal rules
requiring more safety features went into effect, that led to the
deaths. Later buses were required to have, among other things,
better shielding around the gas tank.
   Louisville surgeon Dr. Mark Malangoni testified that six of the
survivors he treated would have died of suffocation if they hadn't
received prompt medical attention.
   He also described amputating the severely burned foot of Miss
Aurentz, who suffered burns over 55 to 60 percent of her body and
has required extensive surgery.
   Mahoney is charged with 27 counts of murder, 42 counts of wanton
endangerment, 12 counts of assault and one count of drunken driving.
   Testimony is expected to move onto the 27 murder counts next
week, but Richwalksy declined to say when that phase of the trial
would begin.

treatment alternatives that are appropriate for their condition.
Patients should receive guidance from their physicians as to the
optimal course of action. Patients are also entitled to obtain
copies of their medical records, to have their questions answered,
to receive second independent opinions and to be advised of
potential conflicts of interest that their physicians might have.
   2. The patient has a right to make decisions regarding his or
her medical treatment. Accordingly, patients are free to accept or
refuse health care that is recommended by their physicians.

<HEAD>Bush Fills Two Vacancies On Legal Services Board</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writers</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Thursday filled two
vacancies on the board of the Legal Services Corp. on the eve of a
scheduled vote to replace the organization's president Terrence
Wear.
   Bush gave so-called recess appointments to former Rep. John
Erlenborn, R-Ill., and Texas attorney J. Blakely Hall to sit on the
board that oversees the independent agency that gives legal help to
the nation's poor.
   Bush made the appointments during the year-end recess of
Congress, thus avoiding Senate confirmation proceedings.
   Under the Constitution, people given recess appointments can
serve until the end of the congresional session _ in this case the
end of 1990.
   The board meeting scheduled for Friday is the latest in
skirmishing between two factions over the nature of legal services.
   The corporation's board has been a battleground for
conservatives seeking to limit legal services, particularly
class-action lawsuits against the government over welfare and other
social programs.
   Conservatives also object to legal services representing
plaintiffs in lawsuits to force hospitals to give abortions to
indigent women.
   This faction held a 6-5 majority on the board until two
vacancies recently occurred, said Carolyn Stewart of the National
Legal Aid and Defenders Association.
   The group monitors the agency and supports efforts to allow
legal services lawyers to provide a full range of representation,
she said.
   Supporters of a broader range of legal services held a 5-4
majority on the board before Bush made the appointments on Thursday.
   The board was scheduled Friday to consider a move to oust Wear
and demand an accounting of more than $100,000 spent to hire a
former Reagan administration official to provide outside legal
advice, Stewart said.
   The money was paid for legal opinions provided by Charles
Cooper, a former assistant attorney general in the Reagan
administration and a conservative activist, Stewart said. Those
opinions include one by Cooper that the corporation is
unconstitutional.
   Stewart said her organization did not know how Erlenborn would
vote if he attended Friday's meeting.
   Now a private attorney in Washington, Erlenborn was considered a
supporter of legal services when he represented a suburban Chicago
congressional district, she said.
   Earlier this year, conservative activists successfully lobbied
the White House to stop the appointment of former Republican Rep.
Caldwell Butler of Virginia to the board.
   Butler had angered conservatives by stating he would not support
restrictions on the activities of legal aid attorneys.

<HEAD>Former Neighbor Charged In 20-year-old Slaying</HEAD>

   Twenty years after Susan Nason was
killed, a former neighbor appeared in court Thursday and was
charged with the slaying, and published reports said the man's own
daughter gave the information leading to his arrest.
   George Thomas Franklin Sr., 50, was arrested Tuesday at his home
in Carmichael, near Sacramento, and charged with murdering the
8-year-old girl. He was held without bail on one count of murder.
   Investigators would not identify the witness who provided the
tip that led to the arrest. But the San Francisco Chronicle,
quoting an unidentified law enforcement source, reported Thursday
that Franklin's daughter, a former classmate of the dead girl, came
forward and told investigators she witnessed the 1969 slaying.
   The source said the daughter had repressed all memory of the
event, but finally recalled seeing her father bludgeon her friend
to death with a rock in his van.
   Susan disappeared while playing after school near her home in
Foster City on Sept. 22, 1969.
   Her disappearance led to an extensive search in the San
Francisco Bay area. A $20,000 reward was offered for the arrest and
conviction of her killer by the employer of Donald Nason, the
girl's father.
   The girl's remains were found four months later under an old
mattress at an abandoned gravel pit near the Crystal Springs
Reservoir about 20 miles south of San Francisco. She had been
killed with a blunt instrument that fractured her skull,
investigators said.
   Nason, who lives in the same Foster City home with his wife,
Margaret, said he never gave up hope a suspect would be arrested in
his daughter's killing.
   ``The law has a very long memory,'' he said. ``After 20 years _
almost on the anniversary and it's pretty close to the day _ it's
something you hope for all this time.''
   San Mateo County Sheriff's Department Lt. Mike Dow said
detectives believe Franklin killed the girl because he had tried to
sexually molest her.
   At Carmichael, a suburb of Sacramento, a close friend of
Franklin said the arrest shocked them both.
   ``I talked to him today, and he's still in shock. He has
absolutely no idea what's happening or why or anything,'' said the
friend, who declined to identify herself. ``I certainly do believe
he is innocent.''
   Franklin retired to the Sacramento area several years ago after
a long career with the San Mateo Fire Department, said the friend.
The woman said Franklin is a licensed real estate agent but is not
currently working.
   ``He's an outgoing man, a delightful person,'' the woman added.

   President Bush headed Thursday for his first
summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, saying the two
have a ``powerful and historic opportunity'' to work for peace.
Gorbachev, in a speech in Rome, called for a 35-nation meeting next
year to speed the integration of Europe.
   Urging an end to East-West divisions, Gorbachev said the changes
sweeping Eastern Europe and toppling hard-line communist regimes
are irrevocable. He said they do not signal ``the collapse of
socialism'' but, rather, further development of a concept with
noble goals and ``enormous humanistic and democratic potential.''
   ``I'm ready and confident,'' Bush said at a farewell ceremony in
the White House Rose Garden a few hours before departing Andrews
Air Force Base, Md., aboard the presidential jet. He labeled
himself and Gorbachev as ``envoys for positive, productive change.''
   He praised Gorbachev as a man ``looking for ways to keep those
reforms moving forward, and I'm looking for ways to promote
democracy and freedom.''
   ``And today,'' the president said, ``the people of Berlin toast
the dawn of a new Europe.''
   Aboard Air Force One shortly after takeoff, Bush told reporters,
``We're about on the same wavelength, from what I've heard from the
briefings'' by European leaders who had recently spoken with
Gorbachev.
   Half a world away, authorities on the Mediterranean island of
Malta were busy mobilizing the military _ and even the boy scouts _
in preparation for the superpower leaders.
   Not even a shortage of tiny, wavable Soviet flags was enough to
hamper the preparations, said Eddie Stafrace, who reported selling
160 American and Maltese flags a day from his little toy store
behind the Palace of the Grand Masters in Valletta.
   Bush and Gorbachev will meet Saturday, beginning 11{ hours of
talks over two days on warships anchored off the Mediterranean
island of Malta.
   Addressing 300 administration officials, Bush said, ``This
meeting represents a point of departure, the beginning of a process
as full of promise as any that we've ever known.
   ``And given the remarkable and rapid change in Eastern Europe,''
he said, ``our meeting will be yet another important step in this
long but hopeful journey toward a Europe that is indeed whole and
free.''
   The discussions are expected to focus on the reforms in Eastern
Europe, negotiations to cut nuclear arms and conventional forces,
trade issues, and regional disputes, including a U.S. complaint
about Soviet-made weapons shipped to El Salvador.
   Bush praised Gorbachev for his ``efforts to relax the grip of
the centralized government, to move toward pluralism and the free
expression of ideas.''
   Calling the changes in the Soviet Union ``dramatic,'' Bush said,
``I believe the people of Europe can see that Mr. Gorbachev and I _
East and West _ are not in some kind of competition. Rather, we're
both working to make the world a more peaceful one.''
   Bush, who originally described the summit as an informal,
get-acquainted meeting, used the word ``historic'' three times to
describe the weekend talks.
   ``Ours is a powerful and historic opportunity, made possible by
a continuing American commitment to the (Western) Alliance and its
defense,'' he said.
   As Bush was preparing to leave, Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, and 32 other members of Congress urged him to
give priority in his talks to ending the rule that imposes high
U.S. tariffs on Soviet imports.
   The president has authority to waive the Jackson-Vanik
Amendment, a provision in the trade law that denies
``most-favored-nation'' status to the Soviets because of their
limits on emigration.
   It will be the first superpower summit since Gorbachev met
then-President Ronald Reagan on New York's Governor's Island on
Dec. 7, 1988. Bush, vice president at the time, sat in on those
talks.
   Since then, a tide of democracy has swept over Europe, removing
from power authoritarian communist regimes in Poland, Hungary,
Czechoslavakia, East Germany and Bulgaria.
   Only Romania has spurned the reforms initiated by Gorbachev
after he rose to power in March, 1985.
   In the text of an interview released Thursday, Bush prodded
Romania to get in step with its Eastern European neighbors. ``My
God, I'd like to see some action there,'' he said. `` ... I'd like
to see them come into the New World and not deprive their people of
a chance to be independent and free.''
   Looking ahead to the summit, Bush said, ``Mr. Gorbachev and I
see eye to eye on what our upcoming meeting is all about. We both
want to build a sustained relationship for real achievements over
the long term.''
   Bush and Gorbachev have expressed support for the changes and
said they want them to be carried out peacefully.
   In the Rome speech following his talks with Italian government
leaders, the Soviet president said the 35-nation meeting he called
``Helsinki 2'' should be moved up from 1992, as originally called
for under the 1975 Helsinki Accords on human rights and security in
Europe.
   He made the proposal in a speech from the Campidoglio, Rome's
city hall, where the treaty was signed in 1957 establishing the
European Common Market.
   On the eve of his historic meeting with Pope John Paul II, he
said that Soviets have changed their attitude toward religion and
now believe religious values can help in the restructuring of
Soviet society.
   Aboard Air Force One, Bush was asked by reporters about
Gorbachev's proposal. The president replied: ``I'll talk to him.
Any ideas he's got, I'll discuss them with him. Then we'll let you
know.''
   Earlier in the day, Italy and the Soviet Union declared that the
``curtain of mistrust between the East and the Wet is crumbling,''
and they promised to support the dramatic movement in Eastern
Europe for deocratic reform.
   In a joint statement, issued at the conclusion of two days of
high-level talks, the countries cited the ``changes toward
democracy'' taking place in Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria
and Czechoslovakia.
   Gorbachev indicated that the movement toward uniting Europe
could be accelerated, with the participation of the United States
and Canada.
   ``In the final analysis,'' he said, ``we envision Europe as a
commonwealth of sovereign democratic states with a high level of
equitable interdependence and easily accessible borders open to the
exchange of products, technologies and ideas and wide-ranging
contacts among people.''
   Bush was to arrive in Malta at mid-morning Friday after an
all-night, nine-hour flight from Washington. He planned to fly out
to the American aircraft carrier, the USS Forrestal, to meet with
crew members and officers and to deliver a speech.
   Bush and Gorbachev will meet on two guided-missile cruisers. On
Saturday they will hold talks on the Soviet ship, the Slava, and in
the evening will have a dinner on the U.S. ship, the Belknap, the
flagship of the U.S. fleet in the Mediterranean.
   The second and final day of talks will be on the Belknap. The
two leaders are to make a joint appearance and make statements on
the Belknap and then hold separate news conferences before leaving
Malta on Sunday night.
   Bush will fly to Brussels to brief NATO leaders on the talks.
The Soviet news agency Tass said Gorbachev will meet with other
leaders of Warsaw Pact nations in Moscow sometime in early December.
   Completing his summit preparations in Washington, Bush placed
telephone calls to Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti and
French President Francois Mitterrand. The White House said Bush had
called leaders of all the NATO countries in recent days.

<HEAD>Third Man Sentenced in Ethiopian's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The third man charged in the racially
motivated beating death of an Ethiopian student has been sentenced
to 20 years in prison.
   Steven Strasser had pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter
in the Nov. 13, 1988, slaying of 27-year-old Mulugeta Seraw.
   Strasser asked for leniency before sentencing Wednesday but
Multnomah County Circuit Judge Philip T. Abraham called the death a
``shocking and horrendous crime.''
   ``I'll never again be a part of a group that advocates
violence,'' Strasser said in a statement to the judge. But Strasser
stopped short of denying that he harbored racist views when
questioned by Abraham.
   Abraham read from a report by a psychologist who concluded after
interviewing Strasser that he ``felt pride in the concept of the
white working man but that he did not have extreme racial views.''
   When Abraham asked if that was how he felt, Strasser replied:
``I didn't necessarily say that. I think people should have a right
to belong to a group.''
   Strasser, 21, was a member of East Side White Pride, a group
advocating white supremacy. Two other members of the same group,
Kenneth Mieske and Kyle Brewster, pleaded guilty to murder and
manslaughter, respectively, in Seraw's death.
   Strasser joined White Pride ``partially out of loneliness and
wanting to belong to a group,'' said his attorney, George Haslett.
``He is just a nice young boy whose life is ruined.''
   Besides manslaughter, Strasser also pleaded guilty to
second-degree assault for striking another victim. He pleaded no
contest to a charge of racial intimidation arising from the same
incident.

<HEAD>Kremlin Official Cautions Lithuanians on Creating Splinter Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Kremlin official Thursday warned Lithuanians
that their efforts to form an independent Communist Party would
hurt national reforms, while party members across the Baltics
pushed for more freedom from Moscow.
   ``The aspiration of certain forces to drive a wedge between the
Lithuanian Communist Party and the Soviet Communist Party will
benefit no one but will only complicate the process of
perestroika,'' Tass quoted Vadim A. Medvedev, the Kremlin ideology
chief and a member of the ruling Politburo, as telling Communists
in Lithuania's capital, Vilnius.
   Despite the well-publicized Kremlin hostility to the
Lithuanians' intentions, 39 Communists in neighboring Latvia,
including eight members of the local party's Central Committee,
called for founding a ``politically, organizationally and
economically independent'' Communist Party, Tass reported.
   ``Many party organizations in the republic look at the address
of the 39 Communists as a call for the splitting of the Latvian
party,'' the official news agency reported from Riga, Latvia's
capital.
   Meanwhile, in Estonia, the third Baltic republic, the local
party's ideology chief, Mikk Titma, said in an interview with his
party's daily that he is ``certain'' the legal guarantee of the
party's leading role in political life will be eliminated from
Estonia's constitution.
   ``Some kind of coalition'' will then govern Estonia, Titma said
in the interview, printed in the Sunday edition of the Sovietskaya
Estonia newspaper.
   The political changes in the Baltic republics come against the
backdrop of upcoming local elections across the country, which
begin in some parts of the Soviet Union on Dec. 10.
   For the first time nationwide, voters will be offered a choice
of candidates for their local ``soviets,'' or governing councils.
Party officials in the once independent Baltic republics have said
they must have a free hand to set policies popular with voters or
risk defeat.
   Medvedev, who was quoted by Tass, traveled to Lithuania
Wednesday to take part in a high-level party meeting. He spoke
Thursday to Vilnius-based delegates to a special congress of
Lithuania's Communist Party, which will open Dec. 19.
   On the congress agenda is a draft program proclaiming the
republic's party ``a political force in the creation of an
independent, law-governed Lithuanian state.''
   Since the days of Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin, Kremlin
leaders have rejected autonomy for local party organizations in the
name of ``democratic centralism.'' Lithuanian party leaders were
summoned to Moscow on Nov. 16 to make their intentions known to the
full Communist Party Politburo, including Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev and Medvedev.
   Gorbachev strongly opposes plans for the Lithuanian party to
separate from the national Communist Party, which he has headed
since March 1985. At the meeting in Vilnius, Medvedev advocated
more rights for the local parties in the 15 constituent Soviet
republics, but only ``within the renewing Soviet Communist Party,''
Tass reported.
   In Latvia, the dissident Communists called for renouncing the
``utopian goal of building Communist society and the dogmatic
interpretation of Marxism-Leninism,'' Tass said.
   Despite criticism of the dissidents, the Latvian Politburo
admitted ``it was losing the initiative'' and decided to organize
working groups to draft the rules and program of the Latvian party,
Tass said.
   Latvia's Communist Party also scheduled a plenum of its Central
Committee in January ``to renew its composition'' and make changes
in the party apparatus, Tass said, indicating the likelihood of
sweeping personnel changes.
   The declaration of the 39 Latvian Communists was printed by
Latvia's major party and government newspapers, according to a
telex sent to the Moscow bureau of The Associated Press by the
Latvian Popular Front, a grassroots pro-reform group.

tackling a $1.2 billion tax-hike package that signaled the end of
the economic boom dubbed the ``Massachusetts miracle'' and
triggered a ``firestorm'' of taxpayer protest.
   A Statehouse switchboard operator said she was handling 100
calls every 15 minutes from irate taxpayers.
   Speaker George Keverian, after a day of vote hunting, recessed
the House without opening debate on the package approved Wednesday
by the House Ways and Means Committee. It includes hikes in sales,
capital gains and gasoline taxes.
   ``Considerable time has gone by today and I apologize to many of
you who have been here waiting for the beginning of debate,''
Keverian said. ``Our position is the same as it was. We intend to
make some refinements and some suggestions tomorrow.''
   The committee's package would add two cents to the sales tax,
increase the gas tax by 10 cents over the next two years and hike
capital gains from 5 percent to 7.5 percent. Most increases would
take effect Jan. 1, 1990, but the capital gains would be
retroactive to last January.
   The proposal is the Legislature's latest move to deal with the
deficit, which a Ways and Means staffer said had swelled to $825
million.
   As the committee sent the proposal to the House, the Senate held
hearings on a $350 million House-approved package of spending cuts.
   Keverian said later Thursday the Democratic leadership would
propose an amendment to lower the sales tax increase to 6 cents on
the dollar, up from the current 5 cents. That would cost $190
million in new revenue this fiscal year and about $400 million next
year.
   Keverian said the loss would be made up with additional cuts and
possibly with additional revenue in the tax package. He said he did
not anticipate any other significant changes, although he would not
predict the outcome of a vote on a rank-and-file amendment he said
he expects will be offered to remove the capital-gains tax hike
from the bill.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who had suggested he had some
reservations about the package, urged approval, saying he realized
taxes were unpopular but elected officials should take a tough
stand.
   ``If there's anything we've got to have now it's fiscal
stability,'' the governor said. ``And that's what this package is
going to bring.''
   The Republican minority leader, Rep. Steven Pierce, said the
size of the package and the leadership's effort to rush it through
were a losing combination.
   ``They failed to get it out because they're pushing an
outrageous bill,'' Pierce said, adding that it had set off a
``firestorm of angry criticism from an angry public.''
   ``The answer should be the same no matter what the package is.
The answer should be no,'' Pierce said.
   Rep. Marjorie Clapprood, a Democrat and supporter of the
package, predicted the sales tax increase would be lowered. ``I
think it is clear as the package stands, we are short of the 81
votes needed to pass it,'' she said.
   Clapprood suggested shutting off the Statehouse switchboard and
locking lawmakers in the House chamber to get the bill passed.
   She said she got one call at home at 4:30 a.m. Thursday from a
woman opposed to higher taxes.
   ``The whole state of Massachusetts has called,'' said one of the
Statehouse's two switchboard operators who declined to give her
name.
   Barbara Anderson of the Citizens for Limited Taxation said the
Legislature was trying to con voters into accepting taxes by
slashing human services and education budgets.
   ``The point is, are we going to give into this kind of
blackmail?'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Americans, many
waving white flags, on Thursday fled combat by leftist guerrillas
that shattered the peace of their upscale neighborhoods and headed
back to the United States.
   The Roman Catholic Church's Legal Aid office meanwhile issued a
report concluding that soldiers carried out the Nov. 16 massacre of
six Jesuit priests and their two domestic employees.
   Guerrillas fired their first anti-aircraft missile Wednesday but
missed the target _ an air force A-37 jet fighter-bomber near
Zacatecoluca, 25 miles south of San Salvador, a Western military
source reported.
   A rebel statement said the insurgents would not use the missiles
if government aircraft stopped bombing, strafing and firing rockets.
   Members of the Salvadoran high command have said missiles could
signficantly alter the balance of power in the fighting.
   The civil war has gone on 10 years and killed 71,000 people.
   ``I'm not coming back,'' Kate Lewis, a teacher at the American
School, said as she carried her 8-month-old baby, Cassandra, down
Mirador Street to where a U.S. Embassy official was waiting for her
and her husband, William.
   Other Americans flashed V-for-victory signs at International
Airport and shouted, ``We'll be back after Christmas!''
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said ``departure is voluntary for all embassy dependents and
personnel who are scheduled for leave or can be spared. We do not
know how many private American residents will take advantage of
this opportunity. We are encouraging American dependents and
personnel who can be spared to depart.''
   The Lewis home, and 30 or 40 others in the exclusive Escalon
neighborhood in the city's western sector, were taken by guerrillas
before dawn Wednesday.
   Rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or
FMLN, observed a six-hour truce beginning 6 a.m. (7 a.m. EST) in
their 20-day offensive, to permit evacuation of those who wished to
leave.
   The neighborhood was quiet Thursday afternoon and remaining
residents ventured out to assess damage and clear rubble. Soldiers
moved cautiously along the streets and drew no fire. The last
guerrilla snipers appeared to have pulled out from their nests in
sumptuous homes. Most of the rebels appeared to have retreated up
nearby San Salvador volcano by dawn.
   ``The FMLN is maintaining a constant siege of the capital, which
is the neurological center of the nation. The fuse of a social
time-bomb has been lit,'' said the clandestine rebel radio
Venceremos.
   About 20 U.S. citizens were among scores of people who took
advantage of the truce to leave Escalon. Many waved white flags and
carried small bundles as they walked past a burned-out light tank,
the bodies of soldiers and guerrilla barricades of expensive cars
with the tires shot out.
   Military spokesmen said five soldiers and 12 guerrillas were
killed in Wednesday's fighting. Reporters counted the bodies of at
least 10 soldiers and saw one dead guerrilla, a woman still
clutching her U.S.-made M-16 rifle.
   Four bodies unrecognizable as soldiers, guerrillas or civilians
were burned on a sidewalk.
   About 150 U.S. citizens left on the first of two charter flights
arranged by the U.S. Embassy. They included embassy employees and
dependents, and Americans living in El Salvador for other reasons.
   Many had taken refuge in the embassy or the headquarters of the
U.S. Agency for International Development headquarters, both well
away from the fighting.
   Many luxury homes and automobiles were shot up, but residents of
Escalon had few complaints about their treatment by the raggedy,
unwashed invaders.
   ``They were kind and gentle,'' said Sheri McKibben of Cleveland,
who was leaving with her husband, Sam.
   Mrs. Lewis said one rebel ventured out to bring fruit juice for
her baby.
   Manuel Vides, a 48-year-old businessman, used his 9mm pistol in
a 20-minute gun battle with rebels who tried to enter his home, but
surrendered after they fired a light anti-tank rocket at his house.
   ``They spared my life, and I have to thank them for that,'' he
said.
   Guerrillas took over the home of retired U.S. Army Col. George
Mynus, former military attache at the U.S. Embassy. His wife,
Rosie, said wounded guerrillas were treated there. They and their
three children left Thursday.
   A young Salvadoran man whose house was occupied described the
guerrillas as ``very respectful,'' but added: ``The very act of
invading a civilian neighborhood and turning it into a combat zone
is a great maliciousness on their part.''
   In the report on the massacre at the Simeon Canas Central
American University, the Church Legal Aid office said ``all the
evidence and indicators establish that those responsible for the
murder of the six Jesuit priests and their two domestics were
members of the armed forces.''
   It noted that the attackers wore army uniforms, according to a
witness; they spent at least an hour shooting up part of the campus
in the middle of a dusk-to-dawn curfew; the zone was militarized,
with troops guarding southern access to the nearby headquarters of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the assassins used sophisticated arms,
including flame-throwers, and burned some priests' offices, and
soldiers searched the residence two days before the massacre.
   President Alfredo Cristiani has promised to find and punish
those responsible.
   A small plane carrying 25 anti-aircraft missiles crashed
Saturday in eastern El Salvador. The government said the plane and
its four-man crew, all of whom died, were Nicaraguan, and broke
diplomatic relations with Managua.
   Missiles are presumed to have been delivered on another plane
that landed Saturday in southern El Salvador and was burned by its
crew.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua has not denied his country
sent the weapons.

   President Bush on Thursday reluctantly signed
into law a bill creating a new independent inspector general within
the Central Intelligence Agency, two years after such a move was
called for by congressional investigators of the Iran-Contra affair.
   The new law is one of three Iran-Contra related measures
Congress sent to Bush at the end of this year's legislative
session. Bush now has signed two, and is expected to approve the
third, even though his administration believes the bills place
unwarranted restrictions on its foreign policy activities.
   Creation of the new inspector general's office, similar to the
oversight posts at other government agencies that review federal
programs and seek to ferret out abuses, was part of a broader bill
authorizing U.S. intelligence activities for the coming year.
   While the precise spending authorized by the bill is secret, it
reportedly involves between $25 billion and $30 billion for
intelligence collection and analysis, upgraded spy satellites and
other hardware, and covert operations overseas.
   In a statement, Bush said the new inspector general post ``could
impair the ability of the CIA to collect vitally needed
intelligence information by creating a perception that
confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.''
   To secure cooperation, the CIA ``must be able to assure foreign
individuals and organizations that their identities, the fact of
their association with the United States, and the information they
provide are not subject to expoure,'' added Bush, himself a former
CIA director.
   A day earlier, CIA Director William Webster said while the
provision could damage confidence of foreign intelligence services
in U.S. ability to keep secrets, he would seek to rebuild
safeguards against compromising intelligence sources and methods.
   ``If it becomes law, we will do our best to make it work,''
Webster said.
   Bush said his objections were mitigated by a provision that
would let the CIA director kill any inspector general's
investigation he believed might compromise national security
interests.
   He vowed he ``will resist any attempt by the intelligence
committees to micromanage the CIA through the vehicle of a
statutory inspector general.''
   The new inspector general would be appointed by the president
and confirmed by the Senate, and the auditor's reports would be
available to the House and Senate committees that oversee U.S.
intelligence.
   Currently, the agency's inspector general is appointed by the
CIA director and reports only to him. That arrangement has caused
friction with the House Intelligence Committee, which has been
denied access to some reports.
   Congressional investigators who probed the Iran-Contra scandal
said the agency's inspector general lacked independence and didn't
have ``the manpower, resources or tenacity'' to uncover
arms-for-hostages transactions or the diversion of profits to
Nicaragua's Contra rebels.
   The implication was that as an underling of former CIA Director
William Casey, who was deeply involved in the affair, the inspector
general lacked the muscle to detect or report on Iran-Contra abuses.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House Iran-Contra
investigating panel, said Bush's acceptance of the new inspector
general provision was ``not easy for him to do. It represents a
concession on the part of the president, a deference to the
congressional sensitivity on this.''
   The bill also keeps on track a multibillion-dollar program to
upgrade the nation's intelligence collection through so-called
``national technical means,'' or satellites and other electronic
spying.
   The program apparently doubles the rate at which the government
will be launching Lacrosse radar satellites, which orbit about 400
miles up and can penetrate darkness and cloud cover to take
high-resolution pictures of the Earth, said John Pike of the
Federation of American Scientists.
   Impetus for the buildup began with U.S. ratification of the
intermediate-range nuclear arms control treaty with the Soviet
Union, which brought new requirements for verification, and has
been given additional urgency by the likelihood of new strategic
and convention arms control treaties with the Soviets in the coming
months.
   Last week, Bush signed a foreign aid bill that includes a
warning against using U.S. aid money as a ``leverage'' to induce
recipients to carry out American policy goals that otherwise would
be forbidden by U.S. law. The provision is a reaction to President
Reagan's apparent use of aid money as a reward to Honduras for
harboring the Nicaraguan Contra rebels in its territory along the
Nicaraguan border.
   Still pending, but expected to be signed by Bush, is a bill that
would impose criminal penalties on any official who permits sales
of restricted arms to terrorist countries, a list that now includes
Syria, Libya, Iran, North Korea, South Yemen and Cuba. The measure
seeks to eliminate loopholes like the ones that permitted the
arms-for-hostages deal with Iran.

   President Bush on Thursday announced he was
vetoing a bill to allow Chinese students to remain in the United
States after their visas expire, calling it unnecessary and an
infringement on his presidential authority.
   Bush said in a statement that the measure was unneeded in light
of administrative steps he had taken to accomplish the same ends _
including new measures taken Thursday.
   The president said he was directing the attorney general ``to
take the steps necessary to extend administratively to all Chinese
students in the United States the same benefits'' that were in the
rejected bill.
   However, a congressional sponsor of the legislation, Rep. Bruce
A. Morrison, D-Conn., accused Bush of yielding to pressure from the
Beijing government, which had strongly opposed the measure.
   ``I'm shocked that the president would kowtow in this way to the
demands of the Chinese communist government, especially when that
government was threatening Chiense students here in the United
States and telling them that the United States was not going to
protect them,'' said Morrison, chairman of a House Judiciary
subcommittee on immigration.
   And Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said in a statement:
   ``I oppose the veto and I hope Congress will override it. The
president should have stood up for the courageous Chinese students,
instead of bowing to the cruel Chinese regime.''
   Democratic leaders had similar comments. Sen. George Mitchell,
D-Maine, majority leader of the Senate, said Bush's action was a
``grave mistake,'' and Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., majority
leader in the House, the No. 2 position there, said it was a
``tragic error'' that the House would make its ``first item of
business ... when we return in January.''
   The president said he was rejecting the legislation with a
``pocket'' veto, a procedural device available when Congress is in
recess but has the same impact as a regular veto.
   When Congress is in recess, a president can veto a bill by
simply taking no action on it, or ``pocketing'' it _ thus the term
pocket veto. Congress has gone home for the year. An override, as
mentioned by Kennedy, would have to be done through an entirely new
bill in the 1990 session.
   Aboard Air Force One en route to the Malta summit, Bush told
reporters he acted to preserve executive control of foreign policy.
   ``I want to keep control of foreign policy as much as I can,''
Bush said. Opposition is ``quite an emotional feeling, but I'm
going to protect the office of the president.''
   Bush earlier criticized the measure, claiming it was unneeded
because he already agreed to extend student visas in the aftermath
of the government's bloody crackdown on protesters in Tianenmen
Square in June.
   Congressional sponsors of the measure, however, said that Bush's
gesture did not go far enough and that many of the 40,000 Chinese
students now studying in the United States had not taken advantage
of it.
   In most cases, visas for visiting foreign students are issued
for two years. The bill Bush vetoed would extend the Chinese
students' visas for more four years and then give them a chance at
applying for permanent residency.
   Bush said the measure passed by Congress was another attempt by
lawmakers to micromanage foreign policy. ``Such legislation puts
America in a straitjacket and can render us incapable of responding
to changing circumstances,'' Bush said.
   ``Chinese and other foreign visitors should know that this is
not an expedient or temporary action, but one reflecting
fundamental American humanitarian values.''
   Bush said he was re-emphasizing ``my commitment _ as I have told
Chinese students in America, and as I have told Congress _ to never
allow any action that would force the return of Chinese students if
their lives or liberty are at risk.''
   Bush also announced that he was expanding a program for offering
political asylum to Chinese visitors who opposed that nation's
policy of forced sterilization or abortion to ``all foreign
nationals, regardless of their country of origin.''
   U.S. law permits the admission to the country as refugees people
who can show a well-founded fear of persecution at home. The
administration has granted such a status to Chinese who claim they
would be persecuted for their opposition to what the U.S.
government claims are coerced sterilizations and abortions in China.
   Whether Bush's announcement would actually apply to anyone was
not clear. No one has accused any other country of such coercive
family planning policies.

   Americans give Mikhail Gorbachev more credit
than President Bush for lessening East-West tensions, and nearly
eight in 10 believe the Soviet leader seeks true reform in his
country, according to a poll.
   The Media General-Associated Press survey found suspicions of
the Soviet Union's intentions fading rapidly, with a majority of
Americans now convinced that the Soviets do not seek world
domination.
   Bush and Gorbachev, who are meeting in a shipboard summit off
Malta this weekend, won exceedingly high popularity marks, with
roughly seven in 10 respondents rating each favorably.
   Their summit comes at a time of momentous change in the
communist world. While Gorbachev pushes reforms in the Soviet
Union, his Eastern European allies in recent weeks have moved
dramatically away from political domination by their Communist
parties.

   The reported crash of a CIA plane carrying
supplies to anti-communist rebels in Angola is underscoring
U.S.-Soviet differences on the eve of this weekend's superpower
summit in the Mediterranean.
   Government officials said Wednesday the L-100 plane went down
Monday night in southeastern Angola after a flight from a military
base in Zaire.
   The crash occurred just two days after the Bush administration
lodged a protest with the Soviet Embassy over an abortive attempt
to deliver Soviet weapons to leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   That shipment was foiled when the Cessna aircraft carrying the
weaponry from Nicaragua crashed in eastern El Salvador.

   A leading U.S. scientist says there is
statistical evidence of a possible link between cancer and exposure
to electromagnetic fields that radiate from the cables and wires
that electrify the nation.
   The unpublished findings by Dr. Genevieve Matanoski, an
epidemiology professor at Johns Hopkins University, run against the
grain of traditional scientific theory about the possibility of
health dangers from power distribution lines.
   Her conclusions fit an emerging pattern of evidence, however,
that the possibility of health risks can no longer be ruled out and
should be studied more closely.
   ``This is consistent with my judgment ... that we'll end up
seeing electric and magnetic fields are cancer promoters of some
kind,'' said Indira Nair, a physicist at Carnegie Mellon University
and co-author of a recent comprehensive background paper on the
issue for the federal Office of Technology Assessment.

   Injections of the natural disease-fighting protein
interferon give doctors their first effective weapon against
hepatitis C, a virus that infects at least 150,000 Americans
annually, according to a report today.
   ``In my opinion, this is a major clinical advance,'' said Dr.
Gary L. Davis of the University of Florida.
   The work appears to represent another milestone in a year of
advances against this elusive virus. Until recently, doctors were
sure of only two hepatitis viruses, type A and type B. Since many
people got hepatitis without exposure to these viruses, their
disease was simply labeled non-A, non-B.
   In April, researchers from Chiron Corp. in Emeryville, Calif.,
reported the discovery of a new hepatitis virus, which they called
hepatitis C. They said it is the principal culprit in non-A, non-B
hepatitis. They also described a new test that will reveal whether
blood is tainted with the virus.

   With the holiday season gearing up, a
chocolate supplier is urging the federal government to avoid a
chocolate shortage by temporarily lifting the import quota for
non-fat dry milk.
   But the chocolate industry is running into opposition from dairy
farmers, who contend that lifting the quota would cause domestic
milk prices to plummet.
   Peter Van Leer, whose 40-year-old family business in Jersey
City, N.J., produces 30 million tons of dark and milk chocolate
each year, said the import limit for non-fat dry milk is 7,000
pounds a year.
   ``That's what we use in a day,'' said Van Leer, whose company
supplies chocolate to Pepperidge Farm cookies, Godiva chocolates
and Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream.

   Johnnie L. Johnson knows what it's like
to be on death row, alone with his thoughts in the middle of the
night.
   A thin man with pale skin and the long sideburns of a hustler,
he spent 12{ years _ one-third of his lifetime _ on ``the row'' for
his role in the 1973 slaying of a Savannah, Ga., woman, a killing
he claims stemmed from a busted drug deal.
   ``On death row it's the waiting that really gets to you,''
Johnson said during an interview at the Georgia State Prison at
Reidsville. ``You feel so helpless. All you can do is sit there in
your cell while some judge somewhere looks at your appeal and
decides if you live or die.
   ``I used to stare at the wall of my cell for hours. I'd look at
it for so long that pictures would start to appear on the wall and
then _ and I know this sounds crazy _ but the pictures would start
to move.''
   Imaginary images are not only a torment, however. Johnson's
imagination has helped him escape _ through the prize-winning
poetry he writes.
   Still, prison officials say he's known best not as a writer but
as a death row inmate who escaped _ literally _ in 1980.
   Wearing makeshift guard uniforms fashioned from pajamas, Johnson
and three other inmates broke out with outside help.
   ``The dye for the uniforms arrived in some stereo headphones,
and the hacksaw blades were in the handle of a portable radio,'' he
said.
   ``We sawed through the screen on an air vent and climbed through
the vent to the roof. Then, we walked across the roof of the
prison, in plain sight of the guard tower.''
   He said they drove off in a car that had been left for them
nearby.
   ``I was never so scared in my life,'' Johnson recalled. ``We
were pretending to be inspecting the roof; I was sure the sniper in
that tower would start shooting at any minute.''
   They were recaptured three days later in Charlotte, N.C.
   During the long, bleak hours following his recapture Johnson
began writing poetry. He says it was an effort to keep from going
``stir crazy.''
   ``Poetry was my safety valve on death row. You might be
surprised to know that quite a few of the inmates here write
poetry.''
   The subjects are the same as those taken up by poets who aren't
behind bars, Johnson says. ``Unrequited love, how you feel about
things, how people feel about you.''
   Once a ``hell-raising kid'' from Beaufort, S.C., Johnson has had
plenty of time to think about such things.
   ``I come from a good family but I got into drugs in the 7th
grade and went downhill,'' Johnson says. ``I quit school in the
10th grade and was on death row before I was 21.''
   ``At my trial my lawyer told me to plead guilty and I'd get a
life sentence,'' he recalls. ``But an election was coming up and
the judge sentenced me to die.''
   In a poem called ``Maturity,'' Johnson writes:
   ``Were we so wise
   as we lived by
   the needle and the gun?
   Is it really living
   when one comes
   so near self-destruction?''
   In 1986 an appellate court ruled Johnson had not had adequate
legal counsel at his trial. His death sentence was overturned and
he is now serving a life sentence.
   In his poem, ``Cellmate,'' he likens his situation to that of
the tiny spider he discovers living in a remote corner of his death
row cubicle. The poem won the top award in a national prison
publications contest sponsored by the Southern Illinois
University-Carbondale School of Journalism in 1987.
   The spider, he says in the poem,
   ``sits behind his sticky desk
   like a fat pompous official
   a tyrant who dictates to those below
   and so someday
   when his antics no longer please
   and I have grown tired of his presence
   his whole world will be swept away
   with one swish of the broom
   and this cell which some call a room
   will be more empty without him
   ... I wonder would he be consoled
   if he knew that I too await my fate
   and wonder what broom
   will sweep me away and how soon''
   Alice Stewart, the Marietta, Ga., attorney whose work got
Johnson's sentence overturned, said, ``He has managed to deal with
his anxiety pretty well, for the most part.''
   Johnson, who spends his days making license plates, said the
hope that he'll get out of prison someday keeps him going. He has
taken college courses while in prison and hopes to get a degree.
   ``Meanwhile,'' he says, I've got a life of sorts here, now that
I'm off death row. I work, I interact with people.
   ``And then, too, there's always writing, or reading. I can get
so involved writing, or reading a good book, that the walls
disappear; I'm not even here.''

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of Johnnie L. Johnson's
poem, ``Cellmate'':
   in the upper left hand corner of my cell
   beneath the roof of his weatherproof
   concrete sky
   a sly
   and ever alert spider catnaps
   with one hairy hand
   on his web-fine fishing line
   a patient fisherman
   he awaits the signal
   announcing the arrival
   of another foolish fly
   who swimming carelessly
   in his ocean of air has
   become ensnared in
   the fisherman's net
   yesterday I watched him
   as he gracefully swung
   from his web-limb
   an eight-armed Tarzan
   trailing a vine of web behind
   and once he lost his hold and fell
   a short distance into space
   but his safety line held fast
   and for a moment there
   he was like a mountain climber
   dangling in mid air
   and I held my breath until at last
   he pulled himself to shore
   and I laughed aloud to see him stand
   safe but shaken on his own strand
   but he pays no attention to me
   and acts as though he does not see
   his enemy here below
   he sits behind his sticky desk
   like a fat pompous official
   a tyrant who dictates to those below
   and so someday
   when his antics no longer please
   and I have grown tired of his presence
   his whole world will be swept away
   with one swish of the broom
   and this cell which some call a room
   will be more empty without him
   and I shall regret my loss
   because he served me well
   in that he disposed of the flies I loathe
   but moreover he is a compatible companion
   quiet clean neat undemanding
   and doesn't occupy much space
   and I think it good that
   he will never know what whim
   caused the stroke that destroyed him
   I wonder would he be consoled
   if he knew that I too await my fate
   and wonder what broom
   will sweep me away and how soon

<HEAD>A Recession in Corporate Profits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although the economy as a whole manages to
continue expanding, business is beginning to suffer a profits
recession.
   The situation is rare since corporate profits are such an
integral part of the broader economy. But the evidence is
overwhelming: While third-quarter gross national product rose 2.5
percent, corporate profits fell.
   Much of the decline was due to a non-recurring event _ money
assigned by five big banks to cover anticipated losses on Third
World loans _ but even without these losses corporate profits in
general were off.
   While totals are not complete, profits for the companies making
up the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 22 percent to $4.98 a
share from $6.38 a share in the third quarter of 1988. Excluding
the banks the decline was 7 percent.
   A survey by the Wall Street Journal showed a 21 percent drop in
after-tax earnings on continuing operations, and another by
Business Week indicated a 22 percent drop, with both declines
negatively influenced by bank performance.
   Several industries performed much worse. Within the S&amp;P, 13 of
25 industry groups fell from their year-ago levels, compared with
eight in the second quarter and just five in the first three months
of the year.
   In addition to the financial sector, other big declines occurred
in the automotive group, aerospace, printing and publishing.
   Reviewing the numbers, Wright Investor's Service said it is
unlikely to see a fourth-quarter repeat of big bank write-offs,
``but you never know.'' It said ``unusual charges and writeoffs
have increasingly become a regular feature of fourth-quarter
earnings reports.''
   While a sluggish though still expanding economy has much to do
with the declines, intense competition is playing a large role,
typified by a 16 percent drop in Sears' profits after it slashed
prices in an effort to boost sales.
   Intense competition also marks the computer, fast-food and auto
industries, with the latter attempting to raise prices only to be
forced into renewed discounting. The auto group showed a 29 percent
year-to-year earnings decline.
   While a decline of that magnitude is considered unusually sharp,
Wright points out that it could have been much worse, around 46
percent, if Chrysler Corp. hadn't gained $300 million from the sale
of Mitsubishi Motors stock.
   Many economists believe that the decline will level off next
year, but none can provide convincing assurance. The unusual event,
such as the billion-dollar accident involving Exxon Corp. this
year, seems to have become less so.
   Moreover, while most forecasts for 1990 suggest the economy will
continue to lumber along on the positive side of a
recession-expansion line, global competition conceivably could
continue to erode profits.
   Edward Yardeni, senior vice president of Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., continues to believe that the economy will expand
in 1990, accompanied by a trend to lower interest rates and a
moderation of inflationary pressures.
   ``The only big change for us is in the outlook for profits,'' he
wrote this month. ``The economy is clearly experiencing a profits
recession,'' he said, attributing it to competition.
   Looking on the brighter side of the situation, Yardeni said he
hoped consumers would respond favorably to discounted prices and
cut-rate financing. If not, ``then the profits recession could
become a growth recession as well.''
   A growth recession is generally understood to mean an economy
that manages to expand, but at such a meager rate that the
difference between growth and shrinkage is little more than
statistical.

<HEAD>Well-Wishers Root for Poisoned Tree, Experts Wait for Spring</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PEGGY FIKAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People no longer leave chicken soup beneath
the branches of the historic Treaty Oak, but well-wishers still
send support from as far as West Germany for its struggle to
survive a poisoning attack.
   Since the May 31 discovery that it was poisoned with a powerful
herbicide, the centuries-old live oak has shed five sets of leaves.
The sixth is sparse.
   It will be spring, though, before experts know the fate of the
tree where legend has it that Stephen F. Austin, the father of
Texas, signed a treaty with the Indians. The Handbook of Texas says
there is little foundation for that tale, but that hasn't
diminished the popularity of the landmark.
   The oak is 50 feet tall and has a limb spread of about 120 feet.
   Throughout the summer, well-wishers brought cans of chicken
soup, flowers and cards, and rock crystals that some believed would
transmit healing powers. Visitors still pin get-well messages,
woven friendship bracelets, ribbons and beads on a line strung
around a barrier surrounding the tree.
   A West German company recently shipped organic fertilizer for
the tree, which has undergone myriad treatments. Contaminated soil
was replaced, and some roots were severed in a move to keep the
tree from absorbing more poison. Shade screens were mounted on
telephone poles to protect it from the summer sun, and it was
misted with water to ease heat stress. A saltwater solution was
pumped in to try to counteract the poison, followed by
energy-giving sugar water.
   Recent tests show the level of the herbicide, Velpar, has been
significantly reduced, said city forester John Giedraitis. If
leaves that bud next spring stay on the tree, ``We're in luck, and
the tree will survive.''
   Treatment has cost about $80,000, plus $40,000 worth of
services. Dallas billionaire H. Ross Perot has pledged to cover the
cash outlay.
   The man charged with felony criminal mischief in the poisoning
has been waging a battle of his own.
   Paul Stedman Cullen, 45, of Elroy, has been in jail since his
June 29 arrest, unable to make $20,000 bail or get it reduced.
Because of a prior felony conviction, he could face life in prison
if convicted in the poisoning, which authorities say may have been
done in some sort of ritual.
   If an effort to quash Cullen's indictment fails, defense
attorney Terrence Kirk said he will try to get the case moved out
of Travis County. Some people have suggested that the tree's
poisoner should be hung from its branches.
   ``This city basically has been transformed into a city of
druids, tree-worshippers. People that never heard of the Treaty Oak
before _ wouldn't know the Treaty Oak from a cactus _ are now
clamoring for blood,'' Kirk said.
   Vengeance isn't the only emotion evident, however.
   Gordon Israel, who lives across the street from the oak and
picnicked under its branches as a child, is growing seedlings from
its acorns. Israel said he hopes some seedlings could be planted in
the Treaty Oak's place if it dies.
   An enterprising entrepreneur sold T-shirts bearing a drawing of
the oak superimposed on a red heart. The sales raised more than
$15,000 for a special Treaty Oak fund to finance tree plantings
citywide.
   Well-wishers sent a post card addressed to ``Treaty Oak, Austin,
Texas'' _ and a postal worker delivered it to the tree.
   An Austin foundry worker suggested bronzing the tree if it dies,
at a cost of more than $1 million, and replanting the metal replica.
   While the spring growth will be a milestone, Giedraitis said, it
could be two years before the tree is ``out of the woods.'' Even if
it lives, it always will bear the effects, he said, like a tree
that has been struck by lightning.
   But no matter what it finally looks like, the Treaty Oak is
special to visitors like Margaret Lounsbury of San Jose, Calif.
``I'm a tree person. ... To me, this is how a tree is supposed to
look,'' said Ms. Lounsbury. ``Well, not with the dead leaves, but
the shape.''
   ``We come here to see this thing, how it's doing, every time we
come to Austin,'' said Elmer Immell of Amarillo.
   ``We came to wish the tree well,'' added his wife, Margot.

<HEAD>NBC's `True Blue' Cop Show Premieres</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For NBC on Friday nights, the Southern
California beaches are protected by ``Baywatch,'' and Washington,
D.C., by ``Mancuso, FBI.'' Now, New York is going to be more or
less safe then, too.
   A new police series, ``True Blue,'' is joining NBC's lineup next
Friday. The show, for which ``Hardball'' was temporarily taken off
the network's active-duty roster, is getting a two-hour premiere
this Sunday.
   The newcomer is about the New York Police Department's Emergency
Services Unit, whose troops specialize in all manner of rescues.
They also pack artillery, however, because they are cops and there
are bad guys out there.
   Sometimes they have to shoot and rescue simultaneously. That's
made amply clear Sunday in a clinker of a subplotline that has a
squad of Middle East terrorists at large in Fun City, plastic
explosives and Uzis at the ready.
   The baddies, of course, are evil incarnate. Not only do they
plot to blow up the New York Stock Exchange, which would halt even
junk bond sales, they later kidnap a school bus full of children of
United Nations diplomats and threaten to blow them up.
   The show is rife with high-tech police gear, including an
armored truck to end all armored trucks. It also has a lot of
dumb-dumb disco music that usually cranks up as our compassionate
heroes set forth on missions of high drama.
   And if Sunday's epic is typical, the lads in blue will always
succeed, in contrast to a pretty good NBC cop series of yesteryear,
``Police Story,'' in which not all stories had a happy ending.
   But there are two bright sides to ``True Blue,'' although it
must be said its debut wastes guest star Amanda Plummer in a role
of few lines and many squints as your basic Anglo-Saxon female
member of your basic Middle East terrorist cell.
   True, the opener _ it also has Tony LoBianco guest-starring as
Doc, one of the ESU cops _ spends much time introducing the show's
11 regulars and their backgrounds. The regulars include a Russian
immigrant (Elya Baskin), a free-lance TV cameraman who continually
pesters the emergency constables.
   And yes, a beautiful woman cop (Ally Walker, cast as a divorced
mother who also is a registered nurse) joins this traditionally
male bastion and must face its macho ways, which are surprisingly
subdued here.
   But Walker, like most in the cast, has a strong theater
background. It gives her and her relatively unknown colleagues a
definite edge in salvaging bad lines and generally making their
characters close to believeable.
   It also helps that one of the show's three executive producers
is Sonny Grosso, a former New York detective famed for his part in
the city's French Connection narcotics case that later became a
movie, naturally.
   With Grosso at the helm, you get a good taste of the closeness
of cops, the practical jokes they play on each other, and the wild
human comedy that can be found in some of the most tragic
situations cops face.
   One example in Sunday's show: A distraught man threatens to leap
from a building. He tells the cops he wants a priest to hear his
confession before he jumps. A young cop (Nestor Serrano) posing as
a hard-of-hearing padre arrives.
   As part of the rescue plot, Serrano edges closer to the
would-be-leaper, saying he can't hear him. The man erupts: ``You
sent a deaf priest to hear my last confession ... God, I HATE NEW
YORK!''
   Sunday's effort has the usual suspects of routine cop-show life,
specifically two shootouts with the terrorists. The second is part
of a predictable finale in which a helicopter and a truck trailer
each go boom.
   But there is potential in ``True Blue.''
   This new entry might just have a chance, provided NBC dumps the
show's emergency disco beat, and the nine other episodes filmed so
far have made a valiant effort to avoid TV cop cliches.
   The cast is good. Let us pray future scripts are, too.

   Elsewhere in television...
   JENNINGS COMES ON STRONG _ With the Big Three of network anchors
all now personally chronicling superpower summit news at Malta,
there comes good Nielsen news for Peter Jennings' ``World News
Tonight'' on ABC.
   According to audience estimates for a four-week period that
ended Sunday and includes three weeks in the November ratings
``sweeps'' race, Jennings' newscast was the winner, averaging 10.9
rating. Dan Rather's usually-first ``CBS Evening News'' was in
second place with a 10.3 average. Tom Brokaw's ``NBC Nightly News''
remained where it's been this year, in third, with a 9.9 average.
Each ratings point currently represents 921,000 homes. The sweeps
are important to network affiliates because they help them set
advertising rates for the next three months.
   Only Jennings' program showed a ratings increase _ two-tenths of
a ratings point up from the November sweeps of last year. Rather's
broadcast dropped by six-tenths of a ratings point. Brokaw's
program was down, too; it averaged a 10.4 rating in the November
sweeps of 1988.

   The ratio of price to earnings long has been one
of the most popular measurements of value in the stock market, so
well known that it is published each business day in many
newspapers.
   It is easily comprehended, being nothing more than the multiple
of per-share earnings that buyers are willing to pay for a
company's stock. Example: Earnings of $2 a share, price $24, equals
P-E of 12.
   This very simplicity, however, provokes critics into warnings
that it is too simplistic, too dated and too variable to provide
fully reliable information.
   Simplistic? To measure value by P-E alone may mean ignoring
management changes or developing problems. Dated? It measures past
performance, not that of the future. Variable? P-Es bounce all over
the lot.
   This latter criticism is becoming one of the paramount
considerations these days, one that is perhaps as difficult to
fathom as any in the marketplace. The reason: The level of P-Es
varies enormously, depending on myriad factors.
   If these factors were strictly financial, perhaps they could be
understood. But they include mass psychology, cultural change,
relations between nations, threats of war, investment money
available, world confidence and on and on.
   As a result, the market's average P-E can vary sharply from year
to year, from one industry to another, from country to country.
While you might be able to tell if one company's P-E is out of line
with the market as a whole, how do you know that the market's
average P-E also isn't out of whack?
   At the end of October, according to John Dessauer, an
independent analyst who follows stocks throughout the world, P-Es
in Europe were 11.8, in the United States 13.7 and in Japan 50.1.
   Which is too high, which too low? What are the factors _
cultural, economic, psychological _ that justify such differences?
   And what do you make of Dessauer's finding that at the end of
1982, when the U.S. economic expansion began, comparable ratios
were 10.8 in Europe, 10.1 in the United States and 22.2 in Japan?
   Dessauer, publisher of Dessauer's Journal of Financial Markets,
Orleans, Mass., traced average P-Es in the United States for
several decades and found variability that many would consider
surprising.
   A general trend toward higher P-Es developed through the 1950s
and 1960s.
   In 1950, investors paid on average only seven times earnings for
the stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average. By 1959 the average
had risen to 18.4 times earnings and it peaked in 1961 at 21.7
times.
   The trend went into reverse in the 1970s.
   Perhaps because of rising oil prices, double-digit inflation and
growing budget deficits, investors lowered the prices they were
willing to pay for stocks. By 1979 the Dow's P-E ratio was down all
the way to 6.8.
   From that extreme low, the Dow's P-E began rising again in the
1980s _ until the great crash of October 1987. Recently it stood at
11.3, down from a 1987 average of 15.8.
   What does the future hold? To even attempt answering that you
would have to consider the possibilities for the U.S. economy, the
consequences of the Cold War ending, the contributions that will be
made by changes in Eastern Europe, the growth rate of China's
economy, the amount of investment money available.
   That might be a beginning; the end could never be sighted. The
amount of research necessary, to say nothing of its quality, would
consume so much time that it couldn't keep pace with changes,
including those in the average P-E.
   Opinions are always possible, however, and Dessauer believes
``the overwhelming need to invest huge amounts of surplus capital
can be expected to overcome stock market jitters.''
   He believes the trend will gather momentum and become
self-reinforcing. His forecast: ``Look for world stock markets,
pushed by the forces of a huge global savings pool, to be generally
strong in 1990 and into 1991.''

   Students at pricey universities like Notre Dame, Yale and
Stanford are dishing up meals in soup kitchens, counseling abused
children and helping the homeless in a domestic version of the
Peace Corps.
   The work helps defray tuition that can exceed $10,000 a year,
but for the students _ many of them more accustomed to spending
summers by the lake than on the soup line _ the volunteerism offers
extra education.
   ``I think for some of our students, those who have grown up in
wealthy suburbs, it brings them into contact with a segment of
society they've never encountered,'' said Notre Dame spokesman
Richard W. Conklin.
   ``Enough of them have come back and given witness to the fact
that it was a lasting experience,'' Conklin said. ``It caused
reflection that really changed their attitudes, especially a wider
recognition of the less fortunate.''
   Yale recently announced a program to give students $2,000
stipends for taking community service jobs across the country each
summer. A similar program began last summer at Stanford, offering
$1,300. Both are based on the James Andrews Summer Scholars
Program, which gives about 24 Notre Dame students $1,400 each in
tuition money to pursue public service projects.
   Stanford's tuition is $13,569 a year, Yale's is $14,000 and
Notre Dame's is $11,315.
   While tuition stipends may be recent, campus volunteerism
certainly isn't.
   ``We've got a tradition here of volunteering,'' Conklin said.
``About two-thirds of Notre Dame students engage in volunteer
services and about one in 10 devotes a year of social service upon
graduation.''
   More than half of DePauw University's 2,400 students in
Greencastle, Ind., participate in public service projects,
including overseas missionary work and visiting prison inmates. At
Yale, more than 2,000 students a year donate time, as did 70
percent of Stanford's graduating seniors last year.
   ``I do hope it does change the image of college students of
today as not just party-goers,'' said Sue Cunningham of Notre
Dame's Center for Social Concerns, which oversees the Andrews
program in South Bend, Ind.
   The 9-year-old program was begun as a memorial to Andrews, an
alumnus and co-owner of Universal Press Syndicate. It is financed
with contributions from the syndicate's talent, including
``Doonesbury'' cartoonist Garry Trudeau and advice columnist
Abigail Van Buren.
   The fund is worth more than $350,000, according to Conklin, who
said he knows of no universities other than Stanford and Yale with
similar programs.
   Last summer, 94 Notre Dame students participated in public
service projects and 34 were given stipends through Andrews
scholarships.
   Despite the assurance of a paycheck at the end of the summer,
the big payoff is often emotional. In the fall, the Andrews
recipients gather to share stories about their summer of social
work.
   ``There's not a dry eye in the house after that dinner. The
stories, however brief, are very poignant,'' said Conklin, whose
daughter, Christina, spent a summer working in a home for abused
children in Minneapolis.
   ``I remember my daughter saying she learned not to ask these
children where they were from because most of them did not have a
home. They were from foster homes and jails. It was a question they
could not answer.''
   Notre Dame students have helped inner-city youth in Cleveland,
counseled pregnant teens in Michigan, served meals to shut-ins in
South Carolina and run a religious camp for second-graders in
Boston's Roxbury neighborhood.
   ``It's an eye-opener to many of them,'' Conklin said. ``These
experiences take hold. It's not `I'm a three-day dilettante in the
city of Chicago.'''
   Stanford's program had a modest start with three students who
worked in a neighborhood health care center, counseled families
with dropouts and taught a creative arts and writing program.
   ``It's clearly something that has entered the student
consciousness,'' said Betty Kaplan, who runs the Stanford Club
Community Service Fellowship program. ``People feel so impotent
about the problems we have. If you can do anything, it certainly
helps.''
   At DePauw _ Vice President Dan Quayle's alma mater _ public
service is emphasized in a program offering a fifth year of classes
tuition-free. Students must take a majority of their classes
outside their undergraduate major, pay for their room, board and
books, and carry a 3.2 grade-point average. The annual tuition
normally is $10,550.
   Joseph Webster Jr. of Fort Wayne is the only student enrolled
this year during the program's first semester. Five students will
be selected next year.
   Webster graduated in May with Phi Beta Kappa honors in
chemistry. To fulfill his public service requirement, he works with
the science department to recruit prospective science majors, and
is studying philosophy, religion and psychology. ``I've increased
my base of knowledge,'' he said. ``I just couldn't intellectually
hold a conversation with some of these people.''
   Associate Dean John White said: ``We are encouraging them to
take only upper-level classes. We want them to take risks. A lot of
seniors probably have real-world anxiety. They're thinking, `What
am I going to do?' So they may see this as an interesting option
for them.''

<TEXT>
   The future of Deng's decade of market-oriented economic reforms,
under which China's economy staged a remarkable recovery after the
ruinous 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, is particularly murky.
   ``To get rich is glorious'' was the phrase that moved the masses
in the 1980s, but it has fallen out of favor with the ascendancy
this year of ideological hard-liners.
   If conservatives such as Premier Li Peng win the power struggle,
the open-door policy would slow and more emphasis would be placed
on central planning, which would be bitterly opposed by coastal
regions that prospered greatly during Deng's reforms.
   China's uncertain future was summed up recently by U.S.
Ambassador to Beijing James Lilley, who said: ``It may be some
years before we can put a name or theme to the new chapter China
will write in the 1990s. In the meantime, we must be prepared for
twists and turns that may defy attempts'' at labeling.
   A crisis also could occur in the Philippines, a fledgling
democracy where President Corazon Aquino has said she will not seek
re-election when her term expires in 1992. No strong candidate has
emerged as her heir apparent on the politically fractured
archipelago.
   Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Malaysia's Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Indonesia's President Suharto are
strong leaders who also may leave the scene in the coming years.
   ``Every leader but one will change'' in the region, said
Broadfoot. He expects only the Sultan of Brunei to still be in
power at the turn of the century.
   One territory that is almost assured of a rough decade is Hong
Kong, which Britain will hand over to China in 1997.
   Fewer and fewer of the colony's 5.7 million people have faith in
Communist China's promise that Hong Kong can maintain its
capitalist lifestyle for 50 years and enjoy a ``high degree of
autonomy,'' particularly since the suppression of the pro-democracy
movement in Beijing.
   Huge numbers of people uncertain about the future are emigrating
from Hong Kong. A foreign passport is the most prized possession in
the colony, and residents are sparing no effort to secure one.
Marriage counselors report booming business from people desperately
seeking foreign national spouses.
   The government, in estimates often criticized as too
conservative, believes 42,000 people will emigrate in 1989 and
another 55,000 will leave the following year.
   Many highly educated white-collar workers are among those
leaving, leading to a brain drain that could reduce the territory's
economic competitiveness.
   Adding to the territory's headache are the approximately 57,000
Vietnamese boat people who have sailed to Hong Kong seeking asylum.
The squalid camps in which they are housed could erupt in violence
if the government carries through plans to send most of them back
to their homeland against their will.
   Two of the other ``little dragons'' _ Taiwan and South Korea _
show promise for furthering what Mushkat calls ``the slow and
painful process'' of democratic change in Asia, which has a long
history of authoritarian rule.
   For example, the ruling Nationalist Party is slowly giving up
its monopoly on political power in Taiwan.
   ``Democratization shall not move backward in Taiwan unless the
economy collapses or in case of a war, neither of which looks very
likely,'' said Lu Ya-li, a political commentator at National Taiwan
University.
   But Taiwan may experience some social instability because of a
problem also faced by South Korea and Japan _ a population that has
not seen its standard of living increase as quickly as national
wealth.
   Property prices have skyrocketed in Taiwan, and most
middle-class families have lost all chance of buying their own
homes. Crime has increased to the point where sales of luxury
foreign cars have fallen sharply because businessmen say the
vehicles make them targets of blackmail.
   In Japan, the average person lives in cramped housing, suffers a
long commute through congested traffic and pays prices 20 percent
to 30 percent higher than in other industrial nations.
   Says Broadfoot: ``You'll see a much greater emphasis on quality
of life in Northeast Asia'' during the 1990s.
   In Southeast Asia, the 1990s will begin with a number of thorny
security issues, including the Cambodian civil war in which the
genocidal Khmer Rouge is among several groups fighting for power.
   Washington will be negotiating the future of six U.S. military
bases on the Philippines whose lease expires in 1991. Many
influential politicians oppose the bases, and there has been some
indication of growing sentiment in the Philippines' armed forces
against the U.S. facilities.
   But perhaps the most interesting security question will be what
Tokyo does to protect its growing economic interests in the region.
   Broadfoot sees Japan likely flexing greater military strength.
``I don't think the United States will be able to continue to be
the defense umbrella of Asia to the extent that it has been,'' he
said.
   A stronger Japanese military will undoubtedly rekindle painful
memories throughout the region of Tokyo's efforts to carve a
subservient Great East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere during the World
War II era.
   Japan may choose to protect its investment through the use of
foreign aid designed to promote stability in the region, but that
could help create a zone of influence that also could lead to
anti-Japanese sentiment.

<HEAD>Mitsubishi Montero: As Much Beauty as Beast</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   It's tall, boxy, big and truck-like, but in its own way, the
1990 Mitsubishi Montero 4-Door RS is as much beauty as beast.
   True, there's no refined leather interior or woodgrain trim, but
there is lumbering V-6 power and decent handling to impress.
   There are no comfort-making, front-seat middle armrests, the
steering wheel is large and truckish, and the Montero's radio is a
bit of a reach at the bottom of the center dashboard console. But
the Montero does offer lots of legroom and headroom, thanks to its
unusually tall profile, and it climbs inclines with gusto.
   In sum, the Montero is a substantial, serious vehicle with a
rugged character. It's not a dressed-up pretty face on the road.
   That didn't stop Motor Trend magazine from naming the 1989
Montero 4-Door the top buy among sport utility vehicles. The
vehicle returns for 1990 virtually unchanged mechanically and in
design.
   Among the key attributes of the Montero that Motor Trend noted
was its interior space: at 94.9 cubic feet of cargo capacity with
the rear seat folded, it's the largest of its class.
   The magazine wasn't exaggerating. The room inside the test
vehicle was something to behold. Three adults were comfortable in
the bench back seat, and legroom there was admirable, thanks to the
high perch of the back seat that meant legs were extended mostly
downward, rather than horizontally.
   Way back in the cargo area, I could even sit straight up on the
carpeted floor with my back against the rear seat and conveniently
fit my legs inside.
   The 43.4 cubic feet left plenty of room for tailgating, and as
mentioned, it could be enlarged to 94.9 cubic feet if the rear seat
was folded.
   The rear gate swung open sideways, not pulling downward. Even on
a slight slope, the gate opened easily and held _ not swinging back
on me.
   Of course, I did have a big step up to get inside because of its
high ground clearance for off-roading.
   There also was good passenger visibility, thanks to the high
seating perch in the 74.4-inch-high Montero, which is taller than
competitors Isuzu Trooper and Jeep Cherokee.
   Inside the Montero, handles seemed to be about everywhere,
especially for rear-seat passengers. They could grab either of two
handles by the rear doors to help them scramble up, or they could
use the cut-out-style headrests on the front seats to help them get
situated inside.
   The Montero also had a unique inclinometer in the middle of the
dashboard. It was an encased blue and black ball that rolled in its
case with the movement of the vehicle. When the ball went nearly
black, I knew the vehicle was in a dangerously inclined position.
   But don't try to watch the ball as you drive, or you may wind up
off the road as I did. Mitsubishi notes that the inclinometer's
indicator should be checked when the vehicle is at a standstill.
   Still, just its moving presence on the dash served as a reminder
that the Montero, like all sport utility vehicles, has a different
center of gravity than cars do and must be driven with care.
   The test vehicle went from two-wheel- to four-wheel-drive and
back again with the help of automatic free hubs. They automatically
locked or unlocked the front wheels according to the setting on the
transfer shift lever inside, next to the regular transmission gear
shifter.
   The two-door Montero has been sold in the United States since
February 1984, but the four-door model didn't arrive until August
1988. Spokeswoman Debbie Stearn said the four-door was needed as
more Americans began using sport utilities as station wagons and
for rural and off-road trips for families.
   Sales of Monteros grew from 2,348 in 1984 to 10,924 in 1987,
then fell to 8,521 in 1988. But in the first 10 months of this
year, sales were up again, from 5,903 in the January-October period
in 1988 to 9,792.
   Mitsubishi says the four-door Montero buyer is typically male
(74 percent) and married (88 percent). But studies show it's not
unusual for their wives to drive the Montero more than they do.
Median age of the male buyer is 39, and 66 percent are college
graduates, the company says.
   Average family income is $75,500, and 40 percent are in
professional and technical jobs. An additional 15 percent are
managers.
   The Montero is not at the bottom of the sport utility field,
pricewise. Starting price for a four-door with V-6 engine and
manual transmission is $15,519, compared with $14,249 for an Isuzu
Trooper (trim levels may differ slightly, too). The test vehicle, a
middle range RS model with four-speed automatic transmission and
options, topped out at more than $21,000.
   Consumer Reports magazine did not list an owner trouble record
for the Montero.

   Nine years after the AIDS epidemic began, a
sluggish U.S. government is quickening its response. Perhaps the
most visible sign is the relatively rapid approval given to new
AIDS drugs this year. One reason for this is the grass-roots
activism prodding the government to change the way it does business.

<TEXT>
   Larry Kramer's sunlit, book-lined apartment
overlooks leafy Washington Square, the heart of Greenwich Village.
Inside are two desks: one for Kramer the writer, another for Kramer
the activist.
   The second desk, covered with scientific reports, news clippings
and government memorandums, is where Kramer plots his battles
against drug companies and the Food and Drug Administration, urging
them to move faster to combat AIDS.
   Kramer is a playwright, novelist and journalist and the founder
of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT UP, a highly visible
advocacy group. Through ACT UP, he has staged angry demonstrations
like one that delayed the opening of the Fifth International
Conference on AIDS in Montreal last June.
   Kramer also writes fiercely eloquent newspaper columns inciting
AIDS patients to fight for better care and attacking the FDA's
delays in approving new drugs.
   ``I don't think anyone can understand what it's like being a gay
man in a big city,'' Kramer said in an interview. ``It's like
wartime. ... I'm fighting for lives, and I'm fighting for my own
life.'' Kramer lost his lover to AIDS in 1984 and is himself
infected with the virus, although he isn't visibly ill.
   Kramer and his allies have become well-known for shouting and
picketing. They are less known for their behind-the-scenes pursuit
of reforms. For two years, they have studied the FDA, learning its
rules and probing its secrets with the Freedom of Information Act.
   Now they are beginning to change it. ``Before we just
protested,'' Kramer said. ``Now we have plans.''
   After years of blind anger, Kramer and like-minded activists
across the country have become adept at persuading the FDA and the
pharmaceutical industry to respond to their concerns.
   ``The needs of the patient community are the most extreme and
desperate,'' Kramer said. ``The laws that bind the FDA are the most
extreme and inhumanely lengthy.''
   As of the end of October, the federal Centers for Disease
Control had reports of 112,241 cases of AIDS and 66,493 deaths.
With such a toll, ``you simply can't do business-as-usual studies
that take 10 years,'' Kramer said.
   Thousands more will die unless the FDA's protection-at-all-costs
system for investigating new drugs is changed and potentially
life-saving treatments are more rapidly approved, Kramer asserts.
And even those who can obtain experimental drugs may find they
can't afford them: health insurance covers only drugs approved by
the FDA.
   Activists argue that desperate patients should have the right to
choose what drugs to try.
   ``I think right now we are seeing a major shift in the federal
health establishment, from attempting to protect people to
realizing there are circumstances under which people should be
allowed to take risks,'' said James Eigo of ACT UP's treatment and
data committee.
   Several recent events highlight the change in attitude at the
FDA.
   In June, Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the federal AIDS research
effort, announced he would push for an experimental system under
which the FDA would continue controlled studies of promising new
drugs but also make the drugs more widely available to patients who
cannot get into the experimental trials. This is now referred to as
the ``parallel track'' approach.
   ``Parallel track was our idea two years ago,'' said Eigo. He is
now a member of a federal committee appointed to oversee the new
process.
   In July, federal health officials met with AIDS activists to
discuss how government research might benefit from underground drug
trials organized by the activists. The meeting was a high point in
cooperation between the activists and government.
   ``This is like a dream,'' Dr. Donald Abrams of San Francisco
General Hospital said last summer. ``I don't think any of us could
have envisioned it.''
   In September, the FDA made an experimental drug widely available
to patients, even though parallel tracking had not been formally
established.
   The drug, called dideoxyinosine or ddI, is still under study to
determine whether it offers advantages over AZT, the only approved
anti-AIDS drug in this country. At the same time, however, the FDA
is allowing drugmaker Bristol-Myers to dispense it to patients with
advanced AIDS or AIDS-related complex who cannot tolerate AZT.
   Some scientists worry that wide distribution of drugs will
interfere with experimental trials because patients know that in
controlled trials they might get placebos rather than drug doses.
Federal officials say it is too soon to know how serious the
potential problem is.
   Even with release of ddI, however, activists have not eased up,
continuing their pressure on American drug companies by threatening
to buy drugs overseas if they can't get them in the United States.
   If Bristol-Myers had not made ddI available, for example,
activists could have bought it from underground labs, Kramer said.
The company was ``about to lose a big market if they didn't get the
drug out,'' he said.
   Activists in New York, San Francisco and other cities have
established ``buying groups'' that travel to other countries where
AIDS drugs banned in this country are freely available or less
expensive.
   In one important case, activists protested the high cost of a
drug called pentamidine, used to prevent and treat pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia, one of the deadliest of AIDS-related infections.
   They threatened to buy the drug in England, where a monthly dose
can be bought for less than half of the $99.54 wholesale price
charged by its American maker, Lyphomed Inc. of Rosemone, Ill. The
company compromised, insisting on keeping its wholesale price but
agreeing to provide the drug free to uninsured AIDS patients.

<HEAD>Cold and Snowy Gray Skies Set Mood for Soviet Winter of Discontent</HEAD>

   As snow begins to fall and the sky turns gray,
Soviet citizens enter a long winter of discontent over barren store
shelves, strikes and ethnic clashes that, far from being halted by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, often have worsened.
   ``There's much that we'd like to have, but the Russian people
are used to difficulties,'' said Luda Panina, 33, as she sold red
carnations outside a Moscow subway station on a cold, snowy day.
   Russians _ and the Soviet Union's more than 100 other national
groups _ have endured hardships for decades, but the difference is
that now they expect more, both from Gorbachev and from his
perestroika program that 4{ years ago promised to make their lives
better.
   Preparing for his shipboard summit with President Bush in the
Mediterranean Sea this weekend, Gorbachev indicated a principal
goal of the talks would be to discuss easing of international
tensions so that he could focus more on problems at home. ``To put
it in a nutshell, we need a normal external environment
for our domestic work,'' he said.
   The country has been torn by long-simmering ethnic, economic and
environmental woes that the leadership previously ignored or
stifled, but which have surfaced as ``glasnost,'' or openness,
exposes harsh realities.
   Inflation, crime and budget deficits, around for decades, were
hushed up until glasnost brought out the shocking numbers: crime up
34 percent in the first 10 months of 1989 over the same period last
year, a budget deficit reaching 120 billion rubles ($194 billion),
inflation pegged by one economist at 4 percent to 5 percent yearly.
   Ethnic tensions among the myriad Soviet peoples _ many of whom
were brutally oppressed under dictator Josef Stalin _ have pitted
Armenians against Azerbaijanis, ethnic Turks against Uzbeks and
Russian minorities against Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians,
Ukrainians and Moldavians. Ethnic clashes have taken more than 300
lives, by official count.
   In addition, growing campaigns for independence in many of the
15 constituent Soviet republics, especially in the Baltics, are
threatening the very glue that holds the union together.
   Strikes by coal miners, angry about official inattention to
their hazardous work conditions and poor lifestyles, have depleted
fuel supplies going into the winter.
   In the southern republic of Georgia, the government ordered
businesses to switch days off to Wednesdays and Thursdays because
of an electricity shortage, caused in part by the shutdown of
Armenia's nuclear power plant after last year's devastating
earthquake.
   Outright economic sabotage is afoot as well. Azerbaijan
blockaded the ethnic hotspot of Nagorno-Karabakh and neighboring
Armenia for two months, preventing trainloads of fuel, food and raw
materials from getting through. The blockade delayed reconstruction
of the area leveled by the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake that killed
25,000 Armenians. Officials now say rebuilding will take three
years, one more than planned.
   Other headaches the nation and Gorbachev have suffered include
the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion and fire that,
according to one Soviet newspaper, led to the deaths of 250 people
and cost billions of rubles, a gas pipeline blast in June that
killed more than 600 passengers on passing trains, and extensive
water and air pollution.
   To many Soviets, however, their mood depends largely on what
there is to eat and wear.
   For the most part, Gorbachev's reforms have brought not
improvements in Soviets' standard of living, but more of what
people here call ``deficits,'' shortages of products that have led
to the widespread rationing of butter, cheese, meat, sugar and tea.
Some economists even propose rationing everything, to prevent the
hoarding that is now common.
   As Soviets approach the end of the year, many would agree with a
prediction made months ago.
   ``One can expect that the year 1989 will be the most
unsuccessful of all those we have lived through,'' Vasily Selyunin,
a specialist in economic affairs, wrote in April.
   Statistics tell the 287 million Soviets what they already know
from painful experience:
   _Of 211 food products, a consumer demand institute found only 23
could be bought freely. The rest require connections with the
sellers or overpayment or they are rationed.
   _Soviets eat half the meat and fruit consumed by the average
American, but twice as many potatoes.
   _Because of losses in distribution and processing, one-quarter
of all farm products don't reach consumers.
   _Nearly 80 percent of Muscovites buy up items in short supply,
even though they don't really need them at the time, and there is
unsatisfied consumer demand in the capital worth the equivalent of
$14 million to $16 billion, a research institute estimates.
   Gorbachev now speaks openly about the failures of perestroika
and has increasingly expressed worry over the people's mood.
   ``The shortage of food creates social tension and generates not
merely criticism but actual discontent,'' he told the Communist
Party Central Committee in March.
   Yuri Maslyukov, the state planning chief, also has spoken of
``mounting social discontent.''
   Gorbachev and his aides admit they failed initially to pay
enough attention to the people's welfare and say improving it is
now their No. 1 priority.
   ``All of our productive capacity must be reoriented to produce
what the people need: consumer goods,'' the Soviet leader said in
May.
   To that end, some 300 military factories are being converted to
civilian production and the 1990 government budget calls for
increasing consumer goods output by 12 percent.
   The Kremlin also is turning to other countries for quick fixes.
It plans to use its precious reserves of foreign currency and
Western credits to import $51.8 billion worth of consumer goods
next year.
   To help Soviet industry gear up to produce such goods on its
own, plans call for importing $2.6 billion worth of raw materials
and light industry equipment.
   This year, the government brought in 15 million pair of leather
shoes, 12 million pair of warm women's boots, 300 million razor
blades, 10 million compact cassette players, as well as clothing,
soap, detergent and toothpaste. Contracts were signed with foreign
companies from Turkey to Japan.
   An encounter with Ms. Panina, the flower saleswoman, showed the
imports are reaching the people. Two large boxes of Danish laundry
detergent she had bought sat on the ground next to her flower
stand. American-brand toothpaste also has appeared in some Moscow
stores.
   But the Kremlin cannot afford such costly imports for long, and
Western officials say they will not help solve the basic problem:
inadequacy of domestic production.
   U.S. aid ``might take the pressures off for a few months,'' one
senior Western diplomat said, but later ``the shelves would still
be bare.''
   Gorbachev has said the ``socio-economic situation'' must be
righted within a year and a half at most, but one of his chief
economic advisers, Abel Aganbegyan, says it will take twice that
long to end shortages. Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev estimates
it will take until 1996 to bring Soviets' diet up to nutritional
norms.
   In the meantime, Soviets keep scrounging around.
   ``You must run around to stores to buy what you need,'' said Ms.
Panina. A look of wonderment on her face, she added, ``They say in
America you go to one store and buy all you want.''

<HEAD>Senators United Against White House Bid To Control Judgeships</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a display of bipartisanship with a
vengeance, Republican and Democratic senators are feuding with the
White House over the senatorial prerogative of saying who should be
appointed a federal judge back home.
   The administration is trying to enforce a multiple choice system
instead of letting GOP senators pick names for almost automatic
nomination to federal district judgeships. That has angered
Republicans, gained them Democratic allies, and set the lines for a
confrontation after Congress reconvenes on Jan. 23 unless the
dispute can be settled first.
   ``It is said that marriages are made in heaven, but judgeships
are made in the Senate,'' a Democratic senator declared, applauding
a Republican colleague for challenging the Republican White House
on the matter.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said Wednesday that President
Bush ``wants a pool of suitable candidates from which he can choose
his nominee,'' and govern the process himself. He said if senators
won't accept those terms, ``that's a matter between them and the
president.''
   On this one the lines are institutional, not political. Senators
don't have much in the way of patronage, and they are not about to
let go of the judgeships on which they have claimed selection
rights for 150 years and more.
   The case at issue involves the appointment of a federal district
court judge for Vermont. Sen. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., has been
trying all year to get Fred I. Parker of Weybridge nominated to
fill the vacancy.
   The dispute erupted into debate just before Congress adjourned
10 days ago. Because of it, Jeffords held up the confirmation of
federal judges in Alabama and Arkansas, and said he will block
nominations wholesale next year if necessary.
   The Senate Republican Conference sided with him, and told
President Bush that he ought to nominate Jeffords' choice.
   Jeffords said district court judgeships have been the
prerogative of senators since 1840, a tradition so strong that
President Herbert Hoover once nominated a man he didn't want
because a senator insisted, and then sent administration aides to
lobby, unsuccessfully, against confirmation.
   That tradition has been whittled a bit during the past two
administrations. Jimmy Carter had selection panels look at all
nominees, and required that there be more women and minority
nominees. While he bent the old system, he did not break it.
   Ronald Reagan had a review commission, and his administration
required that senators send the Justice Department three names for
each vacancy instead of just one. But Republican senators left no
doubt about which name counted, and they got their way.
   Jeffords said the Reagan changes didn't really interfere with
Senate prerogatives. ``What formerly was a formality is now a
reality,'' Jeffords said. ``It is the policy of this administration
that any senator must send at least three names, and it also has
been made clear to me personally that they are not restricted to
those names to select from.'' Bending to the administration,
Jeffords did supply two more names, but made clear that Parker's
was the only one acceptable to him.
   Jeffords said the names go to ``a review panel of five
bureaucrats somewhere in the bowels of the Justice Department.''
   ``If they, as in my case, decide that that candidate is
unacceptable, that is the end of the process,'' he said.
   That's why he decided to fight, using another Senate prerogative
to block other nominees.
   In Vermont, Jeffords said, a nine-member, bipartisan panel
reviews candidates for the federal bench. He said Parker was rated
the best of a dozen potential nominees, far ahead of any other, and
he insisted the state selection board is better equipped than the
administration to choose the best judge for Vermont.
   Jeffords told the Senate that if he yields on Parker, every
other senator will be at risk when it comes time to fill a federal
court vacancy.
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., agreed with Jeffords on the system
and on the selection of Parker, whom he called the best possible
choice. He said judgeships should continue to be made in the Senate.
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del. chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, said there's more at stake than an ancient prerogative.
``Unlike five bureaucrats in the White House subjecting nominees to
litmus tests or any other tests, the home state senators know
better the quality of the people in their states,'' Biden said.
   Jeffords, a Senate freshman, has ventured no public guess as to
why the administration is making his choice a test case. Parker,
who practices law in Middlebury and Burlington, was an assistant
attorney general when Jeffords served as state attorney general.
   Murray Dickman, an aide to Thornburgh, has cited Parker's
membership in the all-male Ethan Allen Club of Burlington. Parker
resigned from the club before his name was recommended for the
bench.
   Dickman noted that Leahy once complained to Thornburgh about the
membership of another judicial nominee in an all-male club. The
nomination of Vaughn R. Walker of San Francisco was held up for
nearly two years, and finally approved this month.
   There's not much political logic there. Walker also was
sponsored by a Republican senator, and two Republican
administrations stuck with him, Democratic opposition and club
affiliations notwithstanding.

<HEAD>Congress on Verge of Passing Landmark Handicapped Rights Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is on the threshold of enacting one
of the most far-reaching pieces of civil rights legislation ever,
addressing one of the nation's largest and disparate minorities:
the disabled.
   The Americans With Disabilities Act guarantees the nation's 43
million deaf, blind, lame and otherwise infirm people against job
discrimination, assuring them access to transportation as well as
shopping malls, doctors' offices, restaurants, movies and other
public accommodations.
   An entire section guarantees the nation's 24 million
hearing-impaired and 3 million speech-impaired residents access to
telephone service.
   The legislation also says the 1.5 million Americans infected
with the AIDS virus can be treated no differently from anyone with
any other illness or disability, such as multiple sclerosis or
cancer.
   ``This is one of the best steps forward that we can take to
fight the AIDS epidemic,'' Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., told fellow
senators.
   Further, the bill declares that alcoholism and drug addiction
are medical problems rather than signs of moral turpitude,
protecting people who are trying to overcome their addictions. The
bill also extends new protections to those suffering from mental
illness, mental retardation and learning disabilities.
   Opposition has come primarily from small business groups worried
about the cost and complication of compliance and from a small but
vocal group of lawmakers opposed to new legal protection for AIDS
victims.
   House debate is likely to be heated over the AIDS provisions and
the question of precisely how much protection the bill affords
victims of the disease.
   But with more than 200 sponsors in the House, the support of the
Bush administration and backing from more than 200 civil rights and
other advocacy groups, the overall bill is likely to pass
substantially unchanged.
   The Senate passed the measure 76-8 on Sept. 7, and four House
committees are going through its provisions before a floor vote
likely to send the bill to President Bush for his signature.
   In Senate debate, proponents likened it to the Civil Rights Act
of 1964, which prohibited racial or religious discrimination. Some
turned the clock back further: to the freeing of the slaves.
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, one of the measure's chief sponsors,
calls it a ``20th century Emancipation Proclamation for people with
disabilities.''
   Business groups, however, remain skeptical. The National
Federation of Independent Business claims its 570,000 members,
mainly small business owners, will bear the largest burden with
nothing offered in return.
   The federation and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce also complain
that the legislation is so vague that the only ones guaranteed
employment will be lawyers.
   Lawyers following up on the bill's provisions could ``achieve
results from courts that perhaps are not in accordance with the
manner in which Congress intended the statute,'' says chamber
attorney Zachary Fasman.
   No one has come up with a private-sector price tag. Supporters
talk instead about the economic benefits of putting the disabled
into the economic mainstream. They say the bill will lead to fewer
government support payments, more consumers and more taxpayers.
   The numbers: 8.2 million disabled Americans who wanted to work
were unemployed in 1986, and half had household incomes of $15,000
or less. Transfer payments to the disabled are reaching nearly $60
billion a year. Institutionalization costs $200 a day per patient.
   Behind those numbers lie tales of suffering and humiliation:
   _The foster mother of a deceased AIDS victim in Maryland who
went to more than two dozen funeral homes before finding one that
would prepare the body. The Kentucky woman who was dismissed from a
job because her AIDS-stricken son moved back home.
   _The blind Harvard Law School graduate who wrote to 600
corporations three times over without receiving a single job offer.
   _The New Jersey zookeeper who kept children with Downs syndrome
away from the primate cage for fear they might upset the chimps.
   _The college that refused to hire a severely arthritic woman
because trustees thought ``normal students shouldn't see her.''
   _The paralyzed Vietnam veteran who must use the service entrance
to restaurants because the regular doorways are too narrow for his
wheelchair.
   _The paraplegic who can't go out on the spur of the moment with
non-disabled friends because the transit bus lacks a wheelchair
lift and the special van must be scheduled a day in advance.
   _The rural, elderly person who can't afford an airline ticket
but can't ride a less expensive bus because it has no lift.
   _Or, in one of the frequent cases of ``benign'' discrimination,
the blind person who wants to wait his turn in line at the National
Aquarium but is told he must use the handicapped entrance.
   If the bill's spirit recalls the Emancipation Proclamation, its
letter comes out of the word processors of the federal bureaucracy.
   The legislation borrows from the 1964 civil rights act and
sections of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 dealing with companies,
institutions and groups that receive government money.
   Rather than list specific disabilities _ estimated by some to be
about 900 _ the law defines disability as ``a physical or mental
impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life
activities.''
   Disabled individuals must be hired if they are qualified to do
the ``essential functions'' of a job.
   Still, exceptions _ likely fodder for future legal tests _
abound. The disabled need not be hired if that poses ``an undue
hardship.'' Existing public accommodations must be made accessible
as long as the changes are ``readily achievable'' without creating
an ``undue financial burden.''
   Debate has focused on the cost and extent of accommodations,
with supporters arguing that most will involve relatively little
expense. Widening a door might cost $300. Relay services for the
deaf and speech-impaired would add about $1.20 a year to each
customer's telephone bill.
   But Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., argues that the annual cost of
a sign-language interpreter can reach $23,500. A reader would have
to be hired for a blind executive or accountant, forcing employers
to hire two people for one job. Computers with speech synthesizers
and special software for the blind can easily cost $5,000, he says.
   The bus industry estimates the cost of lifts at $35,000 each,
not to mention the lost seats and lost cargo space for package
express. Proponents say new, state-of-the-art models are now
available for $11,000.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., says he is troubled by the lack of
discretion allowed employers when dealing with an addict, even if
that person is now ``clean.''
   ``It is difficult for a person to develop an addiction to
illegal drugs without first making a conscious decision to break
the law,'' Rudman says.

   The bill includes assorted timetables and exemptions:

provisions take effect 18 months after enactment.
   _Smaller and shorter buildings are exempt from special elevator

   _All new public-transit vehicles must be accessible but those

disabled. Since all buses last 10 to 12 years, the full conversion
of the fleet would be gradual.
   _Homosexuality, bisexuality, sexual behavior disorders are
excluded from the definition of disability, as are compulsive
gambling, pyromania, kleptomania and some other aberrations.
   _No punitive damages may be collected for violations. However,
fines of up to $50,000 for the first violation and $100,000 for
subsequent violations may be imposed under the accommodations
provision.

<TEXT>
   The prospect of outfitting public buses to accept
wheelchairs, as the pending Americans With Disabilities Act would
require, troubles many transit officials. They say wheelchair lifts
are expensive, unreliable and a nuisance to ``normal'' riders.
   But in Seattle, where the Metro system started putting lifts on
buses 10 years ago and now has them on 75 percent of its 1,000-bus
fleet, it's hard to see what all the fuss is about.
   This city is a leader in making its bus system accessible to
lame, deaf, blind and mentally disabled riders. It even gets fan
mail: a wheelchair-bound couple from Chicago recently wrote to say
they honeymooned in Seattle because they knew they'd be able to get
around.
   ``The difference here was that we planned it to succeed rather
than to fail,'' said Metro official Bob Carroll. ``The attitude in
Seattle has been that accessibility is worth the cost.''
   The cost to the system is high _ $3.89 per trip for wheelchair
passengers, compared to $2 per regular ride. Taxpayers bear the
brunt of it; disabled riders pay just 25 cents per trip, less than
half the lowest regular fare of 55 cents.
   But Carroll thinks the price is reasonable. Paralyzed from the
waist down by a diving accident 15 years ago, he says the city's
wheelchair lifts have opened doors once closed to him and other
disabled residents.
   ``It's being told, `You're part of the system,' versus, `You're
a pain in the neck,''' Carroll said one recent afternoon as he
waited at a downtown bus stop.
   A bus soon eased to a halt, and other passengers hurried on.
Seeing Carroll's wheelchair, the driver pushed a button. With the
whine of an electric motor, a metal platform slid out from under
the front steps.
   Carroll rolled onto the hydraulic lift, which then rose up and
over the steps, settling on the floor inside. As the lift reversed
itself and slid back out of sight, Carroll wheeled down the aisle
and, with the driver's help, strapped his wheelchair into a
reserved space.
   The driver was courteous. Some passengers on the crowded bus had
to pull their feet back to let Carroll pass, but nobody grumbled,
and the whole operation took 45 seconds.
   When Seattle started its program, critics held up the failures
of New York, Philadelphia and St. Louis, which had been plagued by
lifts malfunctioning up to 70 percent of the time, uncooperative
bus drivers and disabled people afraid to use the system.
   ``I was told the (bus drivers') union would fight it,'' said
B.J. Carol, who started Metro's program in 1978 and now is a
private transportation consultant. ``I was told there would be a
huge backlash from non-disabled persons refusing to ride with
disabled passengers.''
   Metro headed off problems by aggressively marketing its new
program. Lift-equipped buses visited nursing homes for practice
sessions. Officials asked riders for advice and followed it.
   They augmented wheelchair-accessible buses with ``para-transit''
vans available on a reservation basis for people too disabled to
use buses.
   Perhaps most importantly, they maintained their equipment.
Nationwide, wheelchair lifts break down an average 10 percent of
the time, an unacceptable rate for riders depending on the bus to
get to work, Metro official Rick Walsh said. Seattle's malfunction
rate hovers around 1 percent, he said.
   Even here, disabled passengers are still a tiny minority. They
account for about 380 rides a day _ less than 1 percent of the
system's total ridership.
   ``It would be more cost-effective to tell them, `Go jump in the
lake, we're not going to serve you at all,''' said Carol.
   But that, too, would have a price: ``You can support disabled
people in a warehouse situation, or you can get them in the
mainstream, with a job, paying taxes,'' Carol said. ``Overall, it's
cost-effective to let people work, because that's what they want to
do.''

<HEAD>Bombs Have Always Worked, But Testing Continues At Nevada Site</HEAD>

   For 38 years, the government has exploded
nuclear weapons at the Nevada Test Site. Bombs have been dropped
from airplanes and exploded atop tall towers. They've been buried
deep underground and in tunnels. At least one was launched with an
air-to-air rocket.
   In every one of 697 announced tests, there's been one constant.
   ``They've always gone off,'' said Paul Brown, head of the
Defense Systems Arms Control office at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory. ``Sometimes the yields haven't been what we expected,
but they've always gone off.''
   Given that nearly perfect track record, why does the government
continue spending some $500 million a year to test its nuclear
weapons?
   ``Reliability is one reason, but it's only one,'' Brown said.
``We see a need to modernize our weapons in response to a changing
world. And there's a tremendously significant need to improve the
safety of our current weapons.''
   That view is challenged by a senior physicist at Lawrence
Livermore, where nuclear weapons are designed. Ray Kidder, a
30-year veteran of nuclear weapons research, says current weapons
are both safe and reliable and contends the only reason for
continued testing is to develop new warheads, such as one under
development that would burrow underground before exploding.
   ``Do you want new weapons or not? That is really the only
question,'' said Kidder, who in a 1987 report to Congress refuted
the Reagan administration's contention it needed to test weapons
from stockpiles to ensure they worked.
   Kidder's five-month study found the nuclear stockpile to be
robust, and argued that weapons no longer had to be taken off the
shelf to be tested.
   ``With the exception of a few of the management people in the
complex here, I think almost everyone agrees with that now,'' he
said. ``Almost anybody that doesn't have an institutional reason
for it pretty much agrees you can maintain a stockpile for
deterrence forever without new testing.''
   Nuclear weapons have a shelf life of only about 20 years before
they start deteriorating, but Kidder argued in his study that
scientists would be able to manufacture new ones based on old
designs without the need for new testing.
   ``I think he underestimates the difficulty of remanufacturing
these weapons,'' Brown said. ``We've tried to remanufacture things
and there have been problems that surprised us at the time,''
because of changes in materials and the difficulty of following the
old old designs.
   Older weapons are still being tested but much of the current
program involves new ones, he said. ``There are new systems being
developed at the request of the Air Force, Army and Navy...
   ``Right now we're working on a short-range attack missile with
advanced security features that will help penetrate air defenses.''
   Without testing, he said, designers wouldn't have the confidence
to make new warheads for new weapons. ``An example is the
air-launched cruise missiles, which needed a new warhead. We did a
test in the 1980s at low temperatures that failed to meet
expectations and we had to make a correction.''
   Scientists no longer carry on the breakneck testing schedule
that, at one point, saw an average two detonations a week in 1962.
An evolving knowledge of nuclear science has seen testing schedules
reduced to an average of little more than one explosion a month in
the last decade.
   Since U.S. testing began with the detonation of the first atomic
bomb, a 15-kiloton blast in July 1945 at Alamogordo, N.M., 825 U.S.
nuclear weapons have been detonated, 697 of those since testing was
moved to its current location.
   ``It's not just blowing up a bomb in the bottom of the desert,''
said Nick Aquilina, who runs the Energy Department's nuclear
testing program. ``This is a completely new science. It's only been
since 1945 that we've been doing this.''
   Several tests in the last few years were ``Star Wars''-related,
Brown said, and perhaps incongruously, some are to see how the
nation's weapons program can operate if there were a U.S.-Soviet
agreement limiting the size of explosions.
   ``A fairly significant part of our program is devoted to how we
can accomplish our mission under further test limitations,'' he
said. ``We're trying to determine what we might be able to
accomplish at lower thresholds.''
   Congress last year asked federal agencies and laboratories to
study how a test ban treaty with the Soviet Union would affect U.S.
nuclear capabilities.
   ``The government's position is that it is taking a stepwise
approach to a ban,'' Brown said. ``We're doing the research aimed
at developing the technical base for the government to make its
decisions.''
   Current nuclear tests are restricted to no more than 150
kilotons, the explosive equivalent of 150,000 tons of TNT. The
limit was set in a 1974 treaty never ratified by Congress. The
United States and Soviet Union agreed to a test ban in November
1958 that ended in September 1961 with the Soviets' decision to
resume testing. The United States is on record as wanting to agree
to lower limits before it will negotiate a test ban, Brown said.
   The two nations made history last year when nuclear scientists
from each witnessed a test at the other's secret site. Soviet
scientists witnessed a test at the Nevada site in August 1988;
American scientists went to the Soviet site at Semipalatinsk the
following month. The tests were aimed at finding a verification
method for future limitations on nuclear tests.
   Kidder, though, said those in the nuclear weapons industry are
proceeding slowly with any preparations for a possible test ban.
``The pro-nuclear forces in this business don't want to be ready
for a test ban,'' he said. ``They simply feel the best way to avoid
one is to be unprepared for it.''
   At the site itself _ where 5,500 people work in an area the size
of Rhode Island, ``There's not anything as organized as a
contingency plan to mothball the test site,'' Aquilina said. ``We
don't have a specific plan for that.''

   As an Episcopal priest, Bob Nelson prays that
no one will ever use what he helps to produce at his day job.
   Other priests may lead protests against nuclear weapons; Nelson
leads the teams that explode those weapons deep underground at the
Nevada Test Site. It's contradictory, being ``the only priest I
know who fires nuclear weapons.''
   And it forces him almost daily to reconcile his occupation and
his calling.
   ``There are no right or wrong answers,'' he said. ``I would like
to be in a situation where there are no nuclear weapons. But I
would also like a situation where we maintain the system of freedom
and justice we have in our country.''
   The 48-year-old deputy manager of Nevada operations for the U.S.
Energy Department is a nuclear veteran, having begun his career in
the Navy on the staff of Adm. Hyman Rickover, a force behind
nuclear development.
   He's a newcomer to the clergy, however, having for years put
aside his thoughts of becoming a priest. ``The way God works, he
just doesn't follow the rules at all. With my family, work and
other commitments, I thought becoming a priest was something that
just couldn't happen,'' said the father of two.
   Nelson, a lifelong Episcopalian, was nominated into the
priesthood by the congregation at All Saints Episcopal Church under
a canon allowing elevation of parishioners to priests in remote
parishes. He was ordained two years ago. The church has not taken a
position on continued nuclear testing.
   Nelson takes pains to separate his role as a priest from the job
in which he has given the final approval to detonate more than 30
nuclear devices. But he also believes his experience in the weapons
program has given him insight into the everyday world that is
useful in his role as a priest.
   ``I deal with a lot of real world things here that perhaps the
clergy who have been clergy for their whole careers don't see,'' he
said.
   Nelson doesn't shy away from defending his beliefs on continued
nuclear testing and he is often asked to go before anti-nuclear
groups and explain the government's position that testing is vital
to the nation's security.
   ``I don't think in any of these discussions I change anybody's
mind or they change mine, but we come away from honest and direct
discussions the better for it. The best comment I ever got from one
anti-nuclear activist was, `I don't agree with what you're doing,
but I'm glad you're the one doing it.'''
   ``He's the kind of guy I admire and respect whether he worked
for me or was on the other side,'' said Nick Aquilina, manager of
the test site. ``I believe he comes across in a very credible way
because he's so honest. I've never second-guessed his motives on
anything because he's always so honest.''
   Nelson goes out of his way not to criticize anti-nuclear
protesters who often congregate at the gates of the test site.
Many, in fact, are his friends, including the wife of another
Episcopal priest in Las Vegas.
   Nelson and the priest's wife are founding board members and work
closely together on a project to build a shelter for homeless women
and children in the city. ``We just don't talk about nuclear
weapons when we're working together. She and I have the same
ultimate aim. We'd both like not to have nuclear weapons. The
difference is how we get there.''

   Andrew Rivers is a bright, witty 10-year-old
whose 2-foot-11-inch frame is so brittle he breaks like a china
doll.
   ``He will never be a Joe Namath; an Albert Einstein, maybe. We
take things one day at a time,'' said Mary Rivers, whose son has
osteogenesis imperfecta, a relatively rare genetic bone disorder
for which science has no cure.
   It's caused more than 30 fractures so far, stunted Andrew's
growth and left him confined to a wheelchair. Doctors don't know if
he'll ever walk.
   ``At the moment there are really no good medical therapies that
make a difference long term,'' says Dr. Peter Byers, a Seattle
medical geneticist who specializes in inherited diseases, including
osteogenesis imperfecta.
   For the short term, surgeons put metal rods through the bones in
Andrew's deformed legs to strengthen them. Rodding, exercise and
external splinting seem to be the best that medicine has to offer
OI patients.
   An estimated 20,000 to 25,000 Americans suffer from the disease,
which is a lack of collagen or protein in the bone. It is either
inherited or caused by some mutation in a gene. OI patients often
have triangular heads and barrel chests that can lead to pulmonary
and spinal problems.
   Andrew has a 7-year-old buddy, Alex Metcalf, who also suffers
from OI. The two match wits at computer games or sit giggling on
the living room carpet as they bat a sponge ball around in a fast
game of catch. The die-hard football fans cheer the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers from the sidelines during home games.
   Alex was born with three breaks and four shortened bones.
   ``Basically, we were told to handle this child as fine
crystal,'' said his father, Matt Metcalf. ``But you've got to
assess the risk, take precautions, then let them go out and play
despite the outcome. The interaction is important.''
   Sometimes, just twisting during sleep can break a child's limb.
Picking up a baby up can fracture the frail bones. Often parents
sandwich newborns between pieces of foam for support to turn the
child over or change a diaper.
   Andrew broke an arm while asleep; his right leg at six months,
his left leg the month after.
   ``Here we have all this attention on child abuse and I'm
carrying around this little body with all these casts,'' said Mrs.
Rivers. ``I was ready to get a T-shirt that read: `I have brittle
bones.'''
   At Lake Fern Montessori Academy where Andrew is a fifth-grader,
Principal Nettie Rossi credits Mary and Conrad Rivers for their
son's academic and social achievements. ``They're so supportive.
They explain things, prepare him, then let him go out and do what
he has to do. They don't baby him.''
   As a result, Andrew plays ball from his wheelchair and does
pushups with his class of 27. ``He has a really good outlook. I'm
sure he has his moments but they don't show here,'' Mrs. Rossi
said. ``He has a sense of hummor, is bright, a good
conversationalist and just an all-around good guy. The kids treat
him like one of them.''
   OI can be so severe it claims a child at birth, or so mild a
person may only show the tell-tale blue sclerae, a blue color to
the whites of the eyes, and suffer a few dozen fractures over a
lifetime.
   ``Some clearly have a shortened life span. They get curvature of
the spine, or suffer compressed lungs making the heart and lungs
work harder. Others have a near normal life,'' Byers said.
   ``It's devastating news at birth that your child has a
mind-boggling disease,'' said Bob Phillips, 42, an accountant with
a mild case of OI who is director of accounting for the Shriners
and treasurer of the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation Inc., both
headquartered in Tampa.
   The foundation formed as a volunteer organization in 1970. In
November 1987, members decided to organize and centralize to offer
support, help collect information about the disease and share it
with other patients and with members of the medical profession.
   Phillips, 4-foot-10 and ambulatory, said he stopped counting
bone breaks after more than 90 during his growing years, adding,
``We do break easy, but we seem to heal faster and that's a plus.''

   Would-be super athletes who take on
projects like bicycling across the country are psychologically
pretty much like the rest of us, but may offer some clues on
handling daily stress, researchers say.
   ``We look at sports as a way to look at other things in life
that are harder to study,'' said James Whelan, a Memphis State
University psychologist and part of a team studying riders in the
annual Race Across America.
   Even though they voluntarily take on the grueling challenge,
riders aren't psychologically unusual, said Andrew Myers, the study
director. ``We thought we'd find that they were all crazy but the
data just doesn't support that.''
   The racers ride for 10 days with one to two hours of sleep a
night, conditions producing what Whelan and Myers say produces a
unique source of study subjects under extreme physical and
emotional stress.
   ``These people reported some rather serious psychological
disturbances during the race,'' Whelan said. ``There were
perceptual distortions.
   ``For example, they would see trees get up and move, which they
knew wasn't happening and it was bizarre to them. A fair number at
different times during the race would actually hallucinate _ they'd
see dragons coming out of the woods. For some riders, their ability
to see the world around them was so impaired they had to stop
riding for a period of time.''
   The researchers still are evaluating data from the 1988 and 1989
races, but Whelan said some factors already stand out on dealing
with stress. Riders who could concentrate on the task, set and
achieve reasonable interim goals and rely emotionally on their
support teams generally came out best.
   ``Among those who finished the race, we found that their skills
in concentration and mental preparation and motivation mediated
their emotional deterioration,'' he said. ``What we're talking
about here is not just are they more motivated but do they have the
skills to keep themselves motivated. You can be real motivated at
the start but 1,500 miles into the race, when you're hitting
100-degree days, how do you keep yourself into what you're doing?''
   The racers learned the needed skills through years of training
and competition, but they can be taught to non-athletes, ``... in
particular how they plan for something, how concentrated they are
on the task, how well they're able to keep themselves motivated,
how well they're able to deal with anxieties and worries and their
ability to depend on others for support and encouragement,'' he
said.
   Riders participating in the study filled out questionnaires at
the beginning and end of the races and also were questioned at
various stages along the 3,000-mile route. Research assistants
conducted the in-race surveys hanging out the window of a chase
van. As one would expect, they found that the mood of the riders
deteriorated dramatically as the race wore on. Twenty-six of the 34
riders in 1988 took part in the study and 20 of the 27 riders in
1989.
   ``People just get involved in seeing how far they can ride and
this is an ultimate challenge,'' Whelan said. ``They're pretty
normal folks who become focused on this sort of activity. They
dream about whether they can cross the country and how fast they
can do it, but they're no different from any other sort of athlete
or other people who enter a hobby and become really involved in
it.''

<HEAD>Food-Poisoning Toxin Helps Vocal Cord Disorder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Small doses of a toxin that causes food
poisoning can help people with a condition that strangles their
voices, researchers say.
   Injections of botulinum into the vocal cords of people with
spasmodic dysphonia relax the tightly squeezed cords within days,
said Dr. Robert Miller, chairman of Tulane Medical Center's
department of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery. The only
adverse reactions are brief hoarseness and difficulty swallowing,
and the toxin does not spread to the rest of the body.
   Spasmodic dysphonia is uncommon, but reliable estimates are not
available of the number of people affected. It seems to worsen with
stress and was long thought to be psychosomatic, but evidence has
accumulated linking the problem to nerve disorders such as tics and
other uncontrollable movements.
   Injections of botulinum toxin have been used to treat facial
tics, Miller said, so researchers decided to try it against the
vocal cord disorder. Work is also being done in New York, San
Diego, Houston and at the National Institutes of Health, said Dr.
Joseph Jankovic, a Baylor College of Medicine neurologist.
   The treatment does not cure the condition. The shots, costing
about $300 each, must be repeated every few months.
   The toxin works with the vocal cords for much the same reason it
causes food poisoning, Jankovic said. In each case, it binds to the
synapse and blocks release of acetylcholine, a chemical that helps
transmit nerve impulses. In the case of food poisoning, the nervous
system's control over breathing often is disrupted, causing death
by respiratory paralysis, he said.

<HEAD>Listening to the Private Lives of Hogs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers are eavesdropping on the most
private, intimate moments in the lives of hogs, hoping for hints
that will help farmers.
   ``We're not trying to talk to the animals. What we're doing is
listening to the animals and seeing what they have to tell us,''
said Jim DeShazer, who has established that hogs make different
sounds identifiable with greeting humans, romancing mating
partners, hunger, stress and other conditions.
   In a more subtle distinction, sound- and signal-analysis
equipment has helped determine that there is a single peak to a
sound wave emitted by a sow during nursing and a double peak to the
sound while giving birth.
   ``Even though it's not picked up by hearing, instruments and
maybe other animals can pick it up,'' said DeShazer, an
agricultural engineering professor at the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln whose research has drawn on the talents of
psychologists, speech clinicians and even dentists.
   Differentiating hog sounds could have practical applications.
Microphones and sound-measuring devices could summon a farmer to
help when a sow is giving birth, for example, or could identify
sounds inaudible to humans that might be stressful to hogs _ like a
squeaking ventilator fan, he said.
   Such equipment ``allows us to pick up sounds animals make and to
analyze those sounds that tell us there's some stress problems or
other indicators that need to be taken care of, or that things seem
to be all right.''

   Eat right. It can improve and even prolong your
life. By now, most people probably know that _ but many still don't
know how.
   To help, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has launched a
campaign called ``Eating Right ... The Dietary Guidelines Way,'' a
collection of four colorful booklets that make making the right
food choices easier.
   ``What we want consumers to know is that they can eat healthier
without changing all their eating habits overnight or giving up
their favorite foods,'' said Susan Welsh, director of the nutrition
education division of the USDA's Human Nutrition Information
Service.
   The booklets cover shopping, quick meals, menus, making lunches
and snacks, desserts and eating out. They're based on the USDA's
nutrition recommendations and are available from the government's
Consumer Information Center.
   Unlike some efforts to improve nutrition, this one starts from
what is known about the way people eat. It accepts that almost
everyone snacks, but it suggests ways to make snacks parts of a
healthy diet. The books are clear and filled with detailed
information on what to do to improve eating habits.
   Many Americans would be surprised at how easy it is to make a
significant change, Welsh said. Salad dressings, for example,
contribute an average 9 percent of total fat in women's diets.
   The booklets, available from the Consumer Information Center,
Dept. 70, Pueblo, Colo. 81009, are:
   _``Preparing Foods and Planning Menus,'' $2.50, Item No. 172-V.
How to cut sodium, fat and sugar in baking; how various cooking
methods work; planning menus; specific ways to follow the old
admonition to eat from all food groups; nutritional needs at
different ages; charts of fats, sodium and sugar in dozens of
standard foods; revising sample menus to improve nutritional
content.
   _``Making Bag Lunches, Snacks and Desserts,'' $2.50, Item No.
173-V. Lists calories, fat, sodium and cholesterol for a variety of
sandwich ingredients; recipes for soups, sandwich fillings and
desserts; snack suggestions. Charts the nutritional cost of lunch
selected from vending machines.
   _``Shopping for Food and Making Meals in Minutes,'' $3, Item No.
174-V. A fourth of the people in a recent survey said speed and
easy preparation had top priority in buying food. Booklet includes
strategies to organize the kitchen, quick-cooking methods, how to
evaluate recipes, reading labels at the supermarket, unit pricing,
selecting the right foods.
   _``Eating Better When Eating Out,'' $1.50, Item No. 175-V.
Making choices among limited offerings at restaurants. A sample
menu and quiz for selecting well from it. Choosing from fast-food
menus.

   The U.S. economy grew moderately from July
through September, the government said, but analysts said it has
since weakened sharply and threatens to derail an unprecedented
peacetime expansion.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that the gross national
product, the broadest measure of economic health, grew at an annual
rate of 2.7 percent in the third quarter, slightly higher than the
2.5 percent rate originally reported last month.
   Earlier this year, economists had widely forecast only sluggish
growth in the quarter.

   U.S. corporations' after-tax profits fell for
the third straight quarter in a sharp 7.2 percent decline
attributed largely to losses stemming from Hurricane Hugo, the
government said.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that the drop followed an
identical fall in the second quarter, which was the steepest in
three years, and a 1.1 percent decline in the first quarter.
   The changes left after-tax profits at an annual rate of $149.5
billion in the July-to-September period.

aren't dreaming of an unusually merry Christmas, an industry

   Rosalind Wells, chief economist of the National Retail Merchants

likely as merchants try to draw customers who might otherwise take
advantage of an extra pre-Christmas weekend and wait until the last

   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. announced a major

   The nation's second-largest brokerage also reportedly was

and reduce American Express Co.'s 61 percent stake in Shearson.
   The restructuring announced Wednesday, which had been expected,
comes as Shearson confronts the fallout from a major expansion
strategy that has been shaken by a downturn in the securities
industry.

<HEAD>Upper-Crust British Institution Fends Off Takeover</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Savoy Hotel, an upper-crust British
institution, has won an eight-year legal battle to fend off a
takeover by Trusthouse Forte PLC, a giant hotel and catering chain
founded by an Italian immigrant.
   Lord Forte, who powered Trusthouse on the back of a single
London milk-drinks counter he opened in the 1930s, called off the
fight Wednesday because he was not willing to spend large sums of
money in legal fees, an aide said.
   Trusthouse said it would not buy any more shares in Savoy Hotel
PLC for five years and the Savoy said it would not issue any more
shares for five years without Trusthouse approval.
   After spending about $64 million, Trusthouse owns 69 percent of
Savoy shares but controls only 42.3 percent because of the stock's
voting structure. Forte employed a team of lawyers in an
unsuccessful bid to gain more votes.
   In return for the truce, the Savoy offered seats on its board to
Rocco Forte, Lord Forte's son and Trusthouse chief executive, and
to Trusthouse financial director Donald Main.
   But Savoy Manging Director Giles Shepard said he will continue
to have final say in the Savoy's operations. He estimated that
fending off the takeover had cost the Savoy at least $1.56 million
in legal fees.
   ``We are delighted to have come to this agreement with the
Savoy,'' Rocco Forte said. ``We have always recognized the
excellence of the Savoy's hotels'' Built in 1889, the Savoy runs
separate kitchens on each of its seven floors, keeps count of its
famous guests' tastes throughout their lives and decorates its 300
rooms individually so that no two are identical.
   The company also operates other famous hotels _ Claridge's, the
Connaught, the Berkeley and the Hotel Lancaster in Paris. Royalty
stays at Claridge's and the superpowers hold banquets there when
their leaders come to London.
   Trusthouse claims to be the world's most profitable hotel and
catering chain and looks after entertaining at the 10 Downing
Street residence of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who admires
its entrepreneurship.
   Sir Hugh Wontner, chairman of the company that owns the Savoy
and a former lord mayor of London, has been catering adviser to
Buckingham Palace for more than 50 years and his family controls 10
percent of the Savoy shares.
   Wontner said quality comes before profit. Lord Forte said they
go hand-in-hand.
   Trusthouse operates in more than 40 countries and Lord Forte
once said the Savoy's profits could be doubled in one year if its
``grossly overpaid'' top management were fired.
   During the legal fight, Lord Forte charged the Savoy directors
with not maximizing potential profits from the famous hotels in
Savoy group.
   Wontner dismissed Lord Forte as ``not a hotelier, just a
caterer,'' while Shepard said of Trusthouse: ``You've got a
difference in philosophy, a David versus Goliath. ... I just don't
believe they'll provide quite what we do.''
   London's Evening Standard newspaper reported the peace pact
represented defeat for Lord Forte's efforts to ``break his way''
into the British upper class ``establishment.''
   Neither Lord Forte nor Wontner, both of whom are 81, attended
the peace pact signing, which must be approved by Savoy
stockholders.

<HEAD>Third-Quarter After-Tax Profits Fall Sharply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. corporations' after-tax profits fell for
the third straight quarter in a sharp 7.2 percent decline
attributed largely to losses stemming from Hurricane Hugo, the
government said.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday the drop followed an
identical fall in the second quarter, which was the steepest in
three years, and a 1.1 percent decline in the first quarter.
   The changes left after-tax profits at an annual rate of $149.5
billion in the July to September period.
   A broader measure, before-tax profits adjusted for depreciation
and inventories, decreased at an annual rate of $15.5 billion to
$292.3 billion. But $11 billion of that was attributed to
hurricane-related losses _ $9 billion from payouts by insurance
companies and $2 billion from uninsured losses.
   Analysts also attributed the poor showing to firms' inability to
raise prices to compensate for rising labor costs and to slower
growth in export sales. Exports are being hurt by the strong
dollar, which makes U.S. goods more expensive on overseas markets.
   ``The problem is very basic. Labor costs are rising and prices
are not going up fast enough to cover the increase,'' said
economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Analysts said the profit squeeze likely will continue. Consumer
resistance caused by a softening economy, as well as stiff
competition from overseas firms, will make it difficult for U.S.
companies to raise prices.
   Economist David Wyss of DRI-McGraw Hill Inc., a Lexington,
Mass., forecasting firm, said fourth-quarter profits also will be
depressed by a strike at the Boeing Co. and from insurance losses
attributable to the San Francisco earthquake.
   A likely result of lower profits will be weaker investment
spending by businesses, a bright spot in previous quarters.
   Business capital spending grew at an annual rate of 4.6 percent
in the third quarter, down from a previous estimate of 5.8 percent
and sharply lower than the second-quarter rate of 8.6 percent.
   Corporate cash flows, a measure intended to show funds
corporations have available for investment, rose 1.3 percent in the
third quarter, compared with a 0.8 percent rise in the second and a
5.6 percent decline in the first.
   Dividend payments to stockholders increased 2 percent to an
annual rate of $123.3 billion after an identical increase in the
second quarter.

<HEAD>Early Reading on Holiday Sales: Mixed to Disappointing</HEAD>

   Cooperative weather and widespread markdowns are
luring shoppers to the stores, but retailers aren't expecting this
year's holiday shopping season to be a blockbuster, an industry
economist says.
   Rosalind Wells, the chief economist for the National Retail
Merchants Association, also said Wednesday that continued
discounting is likely as merchants try to draw customers who might
otherwise take advantage of an extra pre-Christmas weekend and wait
until the last minute to shop.
   She said feedback from stores around the country showed a patchy
pattern of sales in the days immediately after Thanksgiving _ when
shoppers traditionally launch their annual buying binge.
   ``My feeling is that it was a pretty good start to the season
but nothing exceptional,'' Ms. Wells said.
   Speaking at a luncheon meeting with reporters, Ms. Wells said
that after talking with retailers about business last Friday
through Sunday ``My sense ... is that there was overall some
disappointment.''
   The nation's major retailers will provide an early reading on
the holidays when they release monthly sales figures on Thursday.
Most of the big chain stores will report their results for the four
weeks ended Nov. 25.
   Like other analysts, Ms. Wells expects a mediocre Christmas for
the retail industry. She has predicted holiday sales will rise 5.5
percent this year over last year, when the sales gain was 9 percent
over 1987.
   ``I think the preliminary results we're getting are consistent
with our forecast,'' she said.
   Continuing an almost year-long trend, clothing is moving the
fastest, paced by sales of womens apparel, Ms. Wells said. Mens and
childrens wear sales are less robust. There also is continued
weakness in sales of home-related merchandise, such as furniture,
floor coverings, curtains and appliances.
   Markdowns by stores strapped for cash and by their competitors
are giving sales a boost, especially in the Northeast, Ms. Wells
said. A cold snap in the Northeast and elsewhere also is
encouraging shoppers to buy winter goods.
   She said special holiday promotions are pervasive and
particularly intense in areas that have stores owned by financially
troubled Campeau Corp., whose properties include Bloomingdale's,
Jordan Marsh, The Bon and Rich's-Goldsmiths.
   Another highly leveraged retailer, R.H. Macy &amp; Co., is
responding with aggressive promotions of its own.
   In addition to the East Coast, sales promotions seem to be
having a major impact in Atlanta, Boston, Indianapolis and several
other areas.
   Business between Thanksgiving and Christmas generates as much as
half of a retailer's annual income.
   In the retailers' favor, the holiday shopping season is longer
this year than last year by 1 day, spanning a total of 31 days. In
1987, the peak spending season was 28 days.
   But Ms. Wells said there is a drawback to this year's calendar.
   Many shoppers, knowing they have a final weekend for gift
hunting, might put off buying until the last minute. By that time,
retailers would be anxious for business and might offer even bigger
markdowns to attract customers, which would cut into their profits.
   ``I think there's a high probability that that's going to be the
case,'' Ms. Wells said.

<HEAD>Administration Says It Won't Cut Funds for Computer Chip Research</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House's science adviser has denied
reports the Bush administration may seek to slash federal support
for Sematech, an industry-government consortium working to develop
advanced computer chips.
   ``I personally am completely unaware of any move to reduce
support for Sematech,'' D. Allan Bromley told the Senate Armed
Services defense industry and technology subcommittee on Wednesday.
   But he said the administration does not endorse an advisory
committee's recommendation that government funding for Sematech be
substantially increased from its current level of $100 million a
year. That money is matched by another $100 million from U.S.
companies.
   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., the subcommittee chairman, said he
was ``concerned over recent reports of attempts by administration
officials to drastically reduce or eliminate funding for a number
of existing programs, such as Sematech.''
   Other Pentagon-funded programs that Bingaman said may face
cutbacks include manufacturing technology, high-definition computer
displays and X-ray lithography, a technique used for producing
powerful semiconductor chips.
   ``I believe that (the Defense Department) has an appropriate
role in supporting research in long-term, high-risk, high-potential
technologies,'' he said.
   Bromley testified he shares the concerns expressed in a recent
report by the National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors over
the danger of losing U.S. world leadership in the semiconductor
industry.
   ``In many ways, what has and is happening to the semiconductor
industry is a paradigm for what could happen to other U.S.
industries such as the computer and telecommunications industries
unless corrective actions are taken in the immediate future,'' he
said.
   However, Bromley contended that ``the money for direct
government subsidies to somehow reverse the situation by brute
force is not now available, and it is unlikely ever to be
available. Even if such funding were available, it is unlikely that
such an approach would work.''
   The semiconductors advisory committee recommended that
Sematech's funding should be increased immediately by $100 million
a year, split evenly between industry and government. It said
additional funding of $800 million will be required over the next
three years.
   But Bromley, director of the White House Office of Science and
Technology Policy, said the Bush administration does not endorse
``major increases in federal funding levels for Sematech.''
   He also said the administration opposes creation of a publicly
supported corporation to rebuild the consumer electronics industry
in the United States.

<HEAD>U.S. Negotiators Urged To Use Defense Accords To Push Trade</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A business group formed by Congress has urged
U.S. negotiators to use defense accords with European allies to
open more trade opportunities for American business.
   The Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations, which
consists primarily of business executives, said Wednesday the
Defense Department should coordinate negotiating strategy with the
U.S. Trade Representative to boost business.
   The report on U.S. policy toward the European Economic Community
comes as the 12-nation trade bloc prepares to make its 320 million
consumers into a single market in 1992.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said in a statement that
the report's recommendations ``suggest very constructive steps that
can be taken by the private sector.''
   She did not refer specifically to the defense accords. That
recommendation pointed to agreements called ``memorandums of
understanding'' between the United States and individual member EEC
governments.
   Hundreds of the agreements concern the buying of weapons worth
billions of dollars. Some are always being renegotiated by Pentagon
officials and European goverments.
   The report said renegotiations should be used as leverage to
make international rules apply to a greater share of European
governments' spending. It said such leverage would help expand
rules to new areas of interest to U.S. exporters.
   Spending by European governments was one of six issues
highlighted in the report. The report said the 12 governments buy
$600 billion worth of goods and services every year, including
about $150 billion for defense. It said 95 percent of the money is
spent within each country.
   The report also recommended ways to safeguard U.S. business
interests in Europe by urging governments there to:
   _Loosen requirements on the origin of imported goods.
   _Give Americans a greater share in setting up rules for testing.
   _Help get a common standard for enforcing rules on the transfer
of technology.
   _Be flexible about buying U.S. television programs.
   _Improve the conditions for foreign insurance and investment
companies.

   Three activist groups have called for the
ouster of thrift regulator M. Danny Wall but stopped short of
recommending the same for five senators who interceded with his
agency on behalf of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.
   Joining a growing chorus of critics who blame Wall primarily for
Lincoln's loss of up to $2.5 billion in federally insured deposits
were the National Taxpayers Union, Public Citizen and Citizens
Against Government Waste.
   The three groups on Wednesday urged President Bush in a letter
to dismiss Wall as director of the Office of Thrift Supervision,
saying his decision to delay closing Lincoln for 20 months ``may
have cost citizens of this country more than any other political
appointee in history.''
   On Monday, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, also
called for Wall's resignation, saying, ``Everybody will be better
served by a clean break and new leadership.''
   House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
asked Bush in a letter last month to replace Wall. And Bush told
reporters earlier this month he ``is not closing the door'' to that
possibility.
   But at the White House on Wednesday, presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said no decision has been made.
   ``There's been no consideration of Mr. Wall's tenure,''
Fitzwater said. ``He's serving on the board and there's been no
change.''
   Wall said Sunday that he has no intention of resigning and a
spokesman for him reasserted that Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, his office issued press releases Wednesday quoting
new studies as saying that Wall's handling of 223 S&amp;L failures last
year saved the government $6 billlion to $8 billion.
   ``... While some of the 1988 deals are souring, enough of them
are holding together to make it worthwhile, so far, for Wall to
have stuck his neck out,'' said Veribank, a bank rating firm based
in Wakefield, Mass.
   Wall was chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board from July
1987 until last August, when its function as the federal regulator
of the savings and loan industry was transferred to the new office
he now heads in the Treasury Department.
   For nearly two months, he has been the chief target of hearings
by Gonzalez' committee into why the bank board allowed Lincoln to
remain open until last April even though examiners had recommended
in May 1987 closing the Irvine, Calif., thrift.
   ``Mr. Wall's behavior ..., in which he frequently appeared to
knuckle under to political pressure from members of Congress and
the thrift industry, shows he is not qualified to hold office in an
administration dedicated to high ethical standards. ...,'' the
three public interest groups said in their letter Wednesday to Bush.
   None of the groups was willing to say at a news conference that
the five senators who interceded on behalf of Lincoln in two April
1987 meetings with Wall's predecessor and Bank Board officials in
charge of the case should also step down.
   The Senate Ethics Committee is now investigating whether
DeConcini and the four other senators _ Alan Cranston, D-Calif.;
Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., John McCain, R-Ariz., and John
Glenn, D-Ohio _ violated conflict-of-interest rules.
   Together, the five senators accepted a total of $1.3 million in
contributions for their campaigns or other political causes raised
by Lincoln's owner, Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr.
DeConcini and Riegle have since returned the money they received.

   President Bush plans to choose David W.
Mullins Jr., a chief architect of the administration's bailout bill
for the savings and loan industry, to fill a vacancy on the Federal
Reserve Board, an administration source said.
   Bush plans to nominate Mullins, an assistant secretary of the
treasury, to fill a vacancy on the seven-member board expiring Jan.
31, 1996, said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater acknowledged that Mullins
is the top candidate for the vacancy, adding, ``We have not made an
announcement at this point. It could come at any day, though.''
   Mullins, 43, a former Harvard Business School professor, is a
longtime associate of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and
began serving in his current post in October 1988, shortly after
Brady became secretary.
   This year, Mullins attended lengthy congressional sessions to
write S&amp;L legislation, representing the administration in
behind-the-scenes deliberations.
   Earlier, he was the No. 2 staff person on a presidential task
force Brady headed that studied the October 1987 stock market crash.
   ``His association with Brady has been so close he's going to be
viewed as the Treasury's man on the board,'' said economist David
Wyss of DRI-McGraw Hill Inc., a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm.
``Any time you get a strong administration type on the board, it
gives the administration a little stronger finger on the lever of
monetary policy.''
   In recent months, the Fed has been somewhat at odds with the
administration, which has favored lower interest rates than the Fed
and has pressed the central bank to be more aggressive in efforts
to improve the U.S. trade deficit by manipulating the value of the
dollar on world currency markets.
   Mullins would be Bush's first appointment to the board.
President Reagan named the other six members.
   However, economists warned that previous Fed appointees viewed
as administration representatives subsequently took an independent
line.
   ``Vice Chairman (Manuel) Johnson came over from the Treasury,
but he quickly became his own man,'' said economist David Jones of
Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government securities dealer in New York.
   Mullins, if nominated and approved by the Senate, would succeed
H. Robert Heller, who resigned from the Fed in June to become
executive vice president of Visa International, the credit card
company.
   Mullins has little professional background in broad economic and
monetary policy-making but is highly regarded as an expert on U.S.
financial markets and the banking system.
   He received his undergraduate degree from Yale University and
graduate degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He
grew up in Fayetteville, Ark., where his father was president of
the University of Arkansas.
   The Fed, as the nation's central bank, attempts to fight
inflation and sustain economic growth by manipulating interest
rates. It also regulates the banks that are members of its system
and governs the activities of bank holding companies.

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen says the Senate Finance
Committee, which he heads, will consider a wide array of proposals
next year for encouraging saving and investment, including a cut in
capital-gains taxes.
   Expanded Individual Retirement Accounts also will be considered
as Congress looks for ways to increase productivity and the
nation's ability to compete with foreign producers, Bentsen said
Wednesday.
   ``Is there no way America can better compete abroad?'' the Texas
Democrat asked in remarks prepared for a meeting of the Tax
Foundation in New York. ``In fact, there is. The key is to
accumulate investment capital _ and then use that capital to
restore our manufacturing base from the 21 percent of gross
national product it is today to about 25 percent.''
   With Bentsen and Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell,
D-Maine, leading the way, Congress this year defeated President
Bush's call for a reduction in taxes on capital gains, which are
profits from the sale of investments.
   Democratic leaders viewed the proposed reduction as a windfall
for the rich, the beginning of the undoing of the landmark 1986 tax
overhaul and a deficit-increaser that would do little for the
economy. They responded with a plan to liberalize tax-deductible
IRAs but withdrew that proposal when the capital-gains cut failed.
   In his remarks to the Tax Foundation, which honored him with its
distinguished achievement award, Bentsen had much to say in favor
of IRAs but little for a capital-gains tax cut.
   He cited Canada's experience as evidence that IRAs encourage
saving. The U.S. and Canadian savings rates were comparable until
the mid-1970s, when the Canadian rate soared but the U.S. rate fell
to less than half that of Canada, Bentsen said.
   ``What accounts for this sudden divergence? Some economists
believe it can be attributed to broader eligibility and higher
limits for IRA plans in Canada,'' Bentsen said.
   He said he once supported a lower capital-gains tax rate. But
that preferential rate was far more important when the nation's
wealthiest people paid tax rates as high as 90 percent on part of
their income, he said.
   He criticized the temporary nature of the capital-gains tax cut
passed by the House this year and said supporters of a reduction
must find a way to pay for it.
   For a cut to win his support, Bentsen said, ``We would have to
answer the virtually unanimous verdict of economists that after ...
(the) first year such a cut drains the treasury.''

<HEAD>Shearson Restructures; AmEx Reportedly Seeking New Capital Infusion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major restructuring announced by Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. comes as Wall Street's second-largest brokerage
confronts the fallout from an expansion strategy that was shaken by
a downturn in the securities industry.
   ``We are moving from a period of growth by acquisition to a
period of internal consolidation and selective expansion,''
Shearson Chairman Peter A. Cohen said Wednesday as the brokerage
announced major changes in its management structure.
   The restructuring, which had been expected, comes on the heels
of Shearson's announcement that it will lay off hundreds of workers
and make a drastic cut in stockbroker commissions.
   Shearson also reportedly is seeking an outside investor to
provide it with a capital infusion and reduce American Express
Co.'s 61 percent stake in Shearson.
   Under the management shuffle, Shearson is reassigning President
Jeffrey B. Lane to a lesser position and shifting another dozen top
executives. Shearson also established four core business groups and
disbanded its main policy making group.
   Pressure has increased on Shearson and other Wall Street firms
because of sagging profits in an overall industry slowdown since
the October 1987 stock market crash.
   ``American Express would like to see their ownership generating
higher profits,'' said analyst Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical
Services. ``But if the environment doesn't get better it's going to
be difficult for anyone in the industry to have better profits.''
   Shearson is dividing its businesses into four groups _ capital
markets, investment and merchant banking, private client and
subsidiary activities _ similar to realigmnents by other firms in
recent years.
   Lane will head the subsidiary activities group that will include
Shearson's money management businesses, which have more than $95
billion in assets under management, and its Boston Co. division.
   Robert S. Fuld Jr., who heads Shearson's taxable fixed-income
division, was seen as replacing Lane as Cohen's second-in-command,
although Fuld was not named as Shearson president.
   Fuld was named president of Shearson's capital markets group,
which will include the company's worldwide capital markets
activities. He also will oversee Shearson's administrative side.
   Sherman R. Lewis Jr. will head the investment and merchant
banking group and Hardwick Simmons will be president of the private
client group, Shearson's brokerage operations.
   Shearson is disbanding its chief policy-making committee, the
11-member policy group, but will create a business development
committee to ``help identify future directions for the firm.''
   Shearson's net income fell to $106 million in the first nine
months of this year, down 3 percent from $110 million in the same
period last year.
   The firm's woes stem partly from its January 1988 acquisition of
E.F. Hutton Group Inc. for close to $1 billion and its 1984 merger
with Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc. The latter deal marked a major
expansion for Shearson from retail brokerage into investment
banking _ essentially arranging or providing financing for
corporate buyouts.
   Analysts said Lehman's old business generally has helped the
firm in the last two years, but Shearson's pre-tax profit margin
has not approached its pre-merger levels of 15 percent. For the
1989 third quarter, pre-tax profit margin was just over 1 percent,
compared with an industry average of about 4 percent.
   Additionally, analysts said, the Hutton buyout saddled Shearson
with debt and cost the firm more than $1 billion in writeoffs.
   ``Following the Lehman acquisition the significant increase in
the capital markets business really made them a force, particularly
in mergers and acquisitions,'' said Lawrence Eckenfelder, a
securities industry analyst for Prudential Bache Securities Inc. in
San Francisco.
   But, he said: ``The Hutton acquisition created problems because
the business didn't really pick up. It dissipated.''
   Because of the slowdown, Shearson this month said it would cut
broker commissions by 1 percent to 2 percent in 1990 and lay off up
to 800 employees by year's end. That would reduce the firm to
35,700 employees from a peak of 46,000.
   Also, American Express reportedly is considering selling a
portion of its Shearson stake to an outside investor to provide the
firm with more capital. A deal would have to be approved by
Shearson, American Express and Nippon Life Insurance Co. of Japan,
which owns 13 percent of Shearson.
   The capital infusion could help appease Moody's Investors
Service. The Wall Street credit rating agency last month said it
was considering lowering its rating on Shearson's long- and
short-term debt because of the firm's exposure to corporate buyout
debts and its softening business prospects.
   John Kriz, a Moody's assistant vice president, said Wednesday
the credit rating agency had not made a decision on Shearson.

   Italian automaker Fiat SPA is prepared
to pay the equivalent of about $780 million for control of the car
division of Swedish automotive and aerospace group Sabb-Scania AB,
Swedish Radio reported.
   Saab's main owners, the Wallenberg family, is prepared to
relinquish its control of the car division, facing heavy losses,
the radio said.
   The main obstacle to a final agreement was reported to be Saab's

<HEAD>Publisher Launches Magazine for Family-Owned Businesses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owner of an automobile dealership may have
more in common than he realizes with the couple that runs a few
retail stores or the building contractor who owns operations spread
over several states.
   They are all involved in family-run businesses, and are the
targets of the publishers of a new magazine called Family Business.
   The premiere issue of the magazine was recently sent to a
charter susbcriber group numbering 100,000. The magazine will be
available monthly both at the newstand and by subscription starting
in January.
   In an interview Wednesday, Publisher Leonard Zweig estimated
there are 7 million family-owned businesses in the United States.
   But he said that despite the introduction of a number of
consumer-oriented business magazines over the past several years,
he found none that dealt exclusively with issues important to
owners of family businesses.
   Entrepreneur, for instance, contains information on how to get a
business started. But Zweig said information on how to pass a
business along to heirs may be more relevant for a family-run
business that has dealt with startup issues generations earlier.
   ``There has been a resurgence of interest in family
businesses,'' Zweig said. He said MBA students five years ago would
seldom admit it if they intended to go to work for their own
family's business, but today are forming clubs where issues
affecting such operations are discussed.
   The takeover wave has made family-run business a more appealing
career option, he said. ``Corporate life is not offering the secure
niche people thought it was,'' he said.
   Samir A. Husni, the University of Mississippi journalism
professor who publishes an annual guide to new magazines, said it
appears that Family Business has found a niche that has not been
filled by other magazines.
   ``It's a good idea but how well they execute the idea remains to
be seen,'' he said. He estimates only two of 10 new magazines
survive four years.
   Family Business is designed for the 1.5 million to 2 million
family-owned businesses with sales of $1 million to $100 million,
Zweig said.
   The cover story in the first issue deals with a company that is
called into to contain oil and toxic waste spills on waterways, and
describes how the father who owns the business is learning to trust
his children to run it.
   Another story discusses how healthy family companies base
salaries for family members on performance rather than sentiment.
   Regular features will include an advice column with tips on
raising capital, handling tax issues and settling disputes.
   Jack Nessel, a former editorial executive with New York and
Psychology Today magazines, is the editor-in-chief of Family
Business, which is being published from Great Barrington, Mass.
   Publishing consultant Robert S. Walker of Periodical Studies
Service Inc., said new magazines for small business are ``a hot
genre'' sustained partly by the need to advertise a proliferation
of new products these businesses may find useful, such as
computers, fax machines and cellular telephones.
   Advertisers in the first issue included investment and business
consulting companies, financial services concerns and office
equipment makers.
   There were 12 pages of ads in the first 72-page issue. Zweig
plans to have an editorial-to-advertising ratio of 60 percent to 40
percent.
   The magazine is owned by MLR Enterprises, a family-run business
based in Philadelphia that publishes the professional magazines
Mergers &amp; Acquisitions and Directors &amp; Boards and offers database
services.
   Zweig said MLR is investing several million dollars in launching
the magazine and expects that it will take four years for it to
become profitable. He declined to be specific on how much MLR was
prepared to lose.
   Subscriptions will cost $33.97 for a year and single copies will
be sold for $3.50 each at the newstand. Zweig said he would
eventually like to boost circulation to 250,000 to 300,000.

<TEXT>
   Machinist union leaders have huddled to assess
the impact of the defections of pilots and flight attendants on
their strike against Eastern Airlines and vowed to continue their
walkout ``however long it takes.''
   Machinists President George Kourpias said Wednesday the union
would try to pressure Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent company,
and the bankruptcy court overseeing the cash-strapped carrier into
a settlement.
   The plans include demanding that Bankruptcy Judge Burton R.
Lifland, in charge of the Eastern case since the airline filed for
protection from creditors five days after the beginning of the
strike, remove himself from the case. Kurpias and other Machinists
leaders have accuse bias in favor of Frank Lorenzo, head of Texas
The union also plans to push Eastern to make ts to its pension
plan, which is currently owedas $1 billion, and take legal action
against Eastern and Texas Air if the payments are not madr cash and
court actions involving the underfunded pension planaffect
Eastern's attempt to emerge soon from baourpias, who met with
Machinists Vice President paul and the Eastern union leaders, said
the unould seek to lobby Congress to win enough suppoident Bush's
veto of legislation creating a conanel to recommend a solution.
   The pilots at attendants cited the veto last week in makingions
to end sympathy strikes in support of the ists, who walked off the
job March 4 after refusrant more than $150 million in work-rule and
otoncessions sought by Eastern.
   Kourpias, in called those decisions ``disappointing'' but pon,
now alone on the picket lines, ``will not en strike until the
Eastern workers win the fairst treatment on the job that Frank
Lorenzo tried to strip away when he forced the strike.''
   The Machinists, however, face an array of obstacles to winning
back the strike or the jobs of their more than 3,000 members who
worked as mechanics and baggage handlers.
   Eastern was not concerned with the prospect of a Machinists
strike from the outset but was stung when the pilots unexpectedly
supported the walkout.
   Since then, however, the Miami-based airline has been rebuilding
and has told the 1,700 flight attendants and the 2,000 or so pilots
that it has few if any jobs for those who now wish to return to
work.
   Those unions hope to win more of their jobs back through
negotiations with the company and are considering legal action
against Eastern if those efforts fail.
   Henry Duent of the pilot's union, told reporters Wednesday he
expects Eastern to rehire about 700 union pilots at a pace of about
100 a month. He said Eastern officials had taken a ``soft
approach'' in initial discussions about returning to work.
   ``The airline needs some reconciliation with its traditional
employees to work, because it's sure not working now,'' Duffy said.

   F. Gilman Spencer, former editor of the New York
Daily News, was named editor-in-chief of The Denver Post.
   The 63-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner replaces Robert W. Ritter,
executive editor, who resigned Wednesday.
   ``I feel this is a terrific thing for me,'' Spencer said. ``I
think Denver is an interesting market. I love the look of it.''
   Spencer is scheduled to start at The Post on Monday.
   ``Gil Spencer is one of the industry's premier editors,'' said
William Dean Singleton, vice chairman and chief executive of
MediaNews Group, the parent company of The Post. ``He brings
warmth, excitement and creativity to newspapers and newsroom
staff.''
   Spencer resigned from the Daily News in September after five
years. He said he left partly because the newspaper was about to
enter difficult labor negotiations, and he had to make a commitment
either to stay or leave.
   Before going to the New York tabloid, Spencer was editor of the
Philadelphia Daily News for nine years. He won his Pulitzer Prize
for editorial writing in 1974 while at The Trentonian in Trenton,
N.J.
   The Post also said Chuck Green, editor, will become editorial
page editor, effective Monday. Carl Miller, current editorial page
editor, will be reassigned to another senior management position.

<HEAD>Survey: Women on Medical School Faculties Held Back by Motherhood</HEAD>

   Although female doctors can successfully combine
child rearing with teaching at medical schools, most feel that
motherhood has slowed their careers, according to a survey released
today.
   Women make up 19 percent of medical school faculties _ up from
13 percent two decades ago _ but they have been slower to crack the
the academic world's top ranks.
   A nationwide survey of 558 of these women, all younger than 50,
found that nearly two-thirds had children. About half of those with
youngsters had delayed starting their families until they were in
their early 30s and had finished their medical training.
   Although the majority said they were satisfied with their
careers and their decision to have children, 78 percent felt that
their families had slowed their job advancement.
   ``We believe that it is possible for women to combine motherhood
with a fulfilling career in academic medicine, but it is difficult,
and most such women believe that motherhood slows the progress of
their careers,'' the researchers wrote.
   Drs. Wendy Levinson and Susan W. Tolle of Oregon Health Sciences
University and Charles Lewis of the University of California, Los
Angeles, conducted the survey. The results were published in
today's New England Journal of Medicine.
   To earn senior posts on medical faculties, junior doctors must
first receive tenure, and that requires conducting research and
publishing reports, among other duties.
   The study's authors suggested that women _ or men _ who take
time off for their children be given longer to complete these
milestones. ``For example, a faculty member working half time would
have twice as long to achieve standards for promotion and tenure as
those working full time,'' they wrote.
   In a separate commentary in the journal, Dr. Carola Eisenberg, a
child psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School, said medical schools
should use affirmative action to get more women into their upper
levels.
   ``If there is only one tenure slot and there are both men and
women fully qualified to fill it, a woman should be appointed,''
she wrote. ``That is the only way to offset the prevailing pattern
of discrimination.''
   She also urged that the proportion of women among tenured
faculty members rise from the current 6.7 percent to 10 percent
within the next three years.
   ``Does anyone really believe that 500 qualified women cannot be
found among the 8,000 now at the level of assistant or associate
professor to make this goal realistic?'' she asked.

<HEAD>House Panel Hears About Short-Selling Abuses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After two days of testimony on the pros and
cons of short-selling by company heads, traders and exchange
officials, a House panel is slated to hear from federal regulators
next week.
   Market regulation and enforcement officials of the Securities
and Exchange Commission are scheduled to testify about the trading
strategy next Wednesday.
   When selling short, an investor tries to take advantage of an
anticipated drop in a company's stock price. The investor borrows
stock from a broker, hoping to replace it with stock purchased at a
lower price. The investor's profit comes from the difference
between the price of the borrowed stock and the lower price paid to
replace it.
   Profits from short-selling can be huge, but the risks are great.
If the stock's price doesn't go down, the investor will have to pay
a higher price to replace the borrowed stock.
   In opening three days of hearings on short-selling Tuesday, Rep.
Doug Barnard Jr., D-Ga., said the practice is legitimate and
accepted in the market, but the subcommittee was concerned about
``persistent reports of efforts by short-sellers to manipulate
stock prices downward through various techniques meant to be
harmful to the companies or their shareholders.''
   Barnard chairs the commerce, consumer and monetary affairs
subcommittee of the House Government Operations Committee.
   On Wednesday, the head of a nationwide association of companies
traded in the over-the-counter market told the panel that tougher
federal disclosure laws are needed to curb manipulative practices
in short-selling.
   John F. Guion, president of the National Association of OTC
Companies, told a House panel that a survey conducted by the
800-member organization points out the need for such curbs.
   Of the 183 companies responding to the survey, 22 percent said
they believed their company's stock had been the subject of
short-selling by professional short-sellers.
   Guion said the Securities and Exchange Commission should adopt a
rule requiring anyone who sells short a number of shares exceeding
5 percent of a company's outstanding stock notify the company, the
SEC and the market where the stock is traded within 10 days.
   In earlier testimony, other witnesses complained that
professional short-sellers often break the rules to get a stock to
drop quickly so they can take their profit and get out.
   Their alleged methods include spreading false rumors about a
company that it is about to declare bankruptcy or that it is under
SEC investigation.
   ``We find these companies are suffering from the standpoint of
survival,'' said Barnard, the subcommittee chairman.
   Guion said 83 percent of the companies surveyed believe
short-sellers should be required to report their short interest
positions when they exceed a specified amount of shares.
   But other witnesses were less enthusiastic about such a
requirement.
   ``It's difficult to say that additional information would not be
helpful,'' said John Pinto of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, a self-regulatory organization that oversees
the over-the-counter market. ``But I really don't think it would be
a significant regulatory tool.''

<HEAD>Resources Company Cutting Back</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a decade of playing the field _ from
oilfields to goldfields _ Jim Bob Moffett is ready to settle down.
   Moffett, who assembled an unlikely combination of fertilizer
mills, oil and gas wells, sulfur mines, Indonesian copper pits and
Australian gold ore into the natural resources company
Freeport-McMoRan Inc., will sell up to $1.5 billion worth of assets.
   In an abrupt change in strategy, the company said Wednesday it
will prune away many of the operations it bought during the 1980s _
fully a third of the company _ and focus on phosphate fertilizers,
metals and oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``This is a case of selling peanuts to enjoy the watermelon,''
Moffett said, referring to seven operations ranging from the
Freeport-McMoRan Gold Co. subsidiary to the company's Canadian oil
and gas reserves.
   Moffett hopes to realize $1.2 to $1.5 billion. One unit already
has been sold and two were put on the block earlier this year.
   Of the proceeds, $900 million will be used to support huge
mineral discoveries made within the past 18 months.
   One is the largest known existing sulfur deposit in North
America, called Main Pass Block 299, situated under 200 feet of
water off the Louisiana coast. Freeport, which owns 58.3 percent of
the deposit, estimates it's worth $5.4 billion.
   The other is the Grasberg deposit on the remote Indonesian
island of Irian Jaya. Its 3.9 billion pounds of copper more than
double the copper reserves of subsidiary Freeport-McMoRan Copper Co.
   Mixed with the copper are 5.6 million ounces of gold _ more than
the twice the 2.5 million ounces of North American reserves the
company will unload by selling Freeport-McMoRan Gold Co. Because
the gold is mined along with copper and silver, its production
costs should be substantially less than those of the North American
mines.
   With $1.8 billion in debt already on its books and only $474
million in equity as of Sept. 30, it was time to decide which
assets were most expendable, Moffett said.
   ``We can't be everywhere any more,'' Moffett said. ``We have to
find niches where we have a leg up.''
   The company plans to use up to $600 million of the sale proceeds
to cut debt.
   The assets up for sale generated at least $345 million in
revenues in 1988, according to Freeport financial reports _ 18
percent of the company's total. But Moffett said earnings will
remain steady through 1992.
   The gap will be made up by a combination of the cash from the
asset sales, a $50 million cut in general and administrative costs
and lower operating and interest expenses.
   After 1992, Moffett said, revenues from Main Pass and Grasberg
will begin to gush into the company's coffers.
   Securities analysts agreed. ``We think it's a good move to
streamline operations,'' said Barbara Cranner of Howard, Weil,
Labouisse, Friedrichs. ``They had to do something about debt.''
   Low resource prices, plus high interest costs, depressed the
company's earnings performance this year. Earnings fell from $3.35
a share in the first nine months of 1988 to $1.75 in the same
period this year.
   Investors appeared only mildly impressed by the plan.
Freeport-McMoRan, which reached a high of $38 a share in april,
closed at $30.12{ Wednesday, up 50 cents. Freeport-McMoRan Resource
Partners, which owns the Main Pass sulfur deposit, closed at
$20.50, up 50 cents, while Freeport Copper, which is developing the
Grasberg strike, rose 12.5 cents to $20.87{.

<HEAD>Company Hopes To Build Super Fast Computer Using Defense Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Danny Hillis says the supercomputer he is
designing will be able to take complex problems that now require a
year of calculations and solve them in a few hours.
   In addition, the machine would need just 1 second to perform 1
trillion mathematical operations _ such as additions or
multiplications.
   ``You could tally up the national debt in 1 second,'' Hillis
said.
   Hillis is co-founder and chief scientist of Thinking Machines
Corp. in Cambridge. The company announced this week it was getting
$12 million from the Pentagon to develop a supercomputer that works
1,000 times faster than standard models now available and more than
100 times faster than the top machines.
   Thinking Machines said it was receiving the government money
from the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,
which has been awarding grants aimed at keeping the United States
the world leader in high-speed supercomputers.
   Hillis said he expects the project to be completed by the
mid-1990s, but his company hopes to have a smaller version ready to
present to the Pentagon in 1992.
   Thinking Machines uses a process called parallel computing, in
which smaller computers work separately to solve small pieces of
bigger problems. The company's current models contain about 64,000
smaller computers, but the new machine could use up to 1 million
processors.
   Other supercomputer makers, such as world leading Cray Research
Inc., use parallel processing to a much smaller extent.
   Instead, they do large chunks of problems and work quickly from
one facet to the next, said Bob Trier, director of technical
programs for Research Consortium Inc., a Minneapolis-based company
that studies the supercomputer market for users and vendors.
   While machines that use parallel processing can do many
calculations at once, they also are tailored more to solving
specific problems and are less flexible in their uses, Trier said.
   Also, he said, some complex mathematical problems must be solved
one step at a time and do not lend themselves to parallel
processing.
   But Hillis said his company, which has been growing about 50
percent a year and provides computers for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, will produce machines that have many
applications.
   For example, he said, the supercomputers can perform
calculations in human genetics, can help design microchips and even
simulate how a car will work before it is built.
   ``Some problems literally would take a year to do (on current
computers),'' Hillis said. ``If it takes a year to do, you might as
well build the car.''
   By contrast, the new computer would take only a few hours to
solve such problems, he said.

   China plans to produce a record 412 million tons
of grain next year as the state puts more land into cultivation and
invests more in the countryside, Agriculture Minister He Kang said.
   He said at a meeting Wednesday that grain production will be up
from an estimated harvest of 405 million tons this year, the
official China Daily reported Thursday.
   He said the nation also hoped to produce up to 4.4 million tons
of cotton next year, up from this year's output of about 4 million
tons. Substantial gains are also planned in production of edible
oils, meat and fishery products.
   The minister said 1.63 million acres of land will be put into
grain production, making the total 272 million acres.
   Following a record grain harvest of 407 million tons in 1984,
China has had four straight sub-standard crops, a result of poor
weather and low state-set prices for grain that have discouraged
production. Good weather has helped raise output this year, but the
harvest will still fall short of the 1984 figure.
   Chinese agricultural experts say the nation must increase output
by at least 10 million tons a year, to 500 million tons at the end
of the decade, just to keep up with population growth.

   The National Bank said it will issue a
200,000 zloty note on Friday, marking the third time this year that
a new note has been created to keep pace with roaring inflation.
   The 200,000 zloty note will be worth $59 at the official
exchange rate, or $29 at the commercial exchange rate now legally
available to Poles.
   The bank said a 50,000 zloty note, which previously was to be
issued before the end of the year, also will be put into
circulation on Friday.
   When the bank issued 20,000 zloty notes nine months ago,
inflation was running at 60 percent annually. The 20,000 zloty was
$36 at the official exchange rate.
   The annual inflation rate is now estimated at about 700 percent,
and food prices have rocketed since price controls were lifted Aug.
1 in a ``marketization'' program introduced by the previous
communist government.
   The new 200,000 zloty note will have a panorama of Warsaw on one
side and an eagle, the national emblem, on the other, the bank
communique said.
   Poles use large notes to pay cash for high-priced items such as
cars, computers and televsion sets that can cost millions of zlotys.

<HEAD>Chocolate Suppliers Want Dry Milk Quota Lifted for Holiday Season</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs graf 3, Peter Van Leer, to CORRECT 30 million tons to more

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the holiday season gearing up, a
chocolate supplier is urging the federal government to avoid a
chocolate shortage by temporarily lifting the import quota for
non-fat dry milk.
   But the chocolate industry is running into opposition from dairy
farmers, who contend that lifting the quota would cause domestic
milk prices to plummet.
   Peter Van Leer, whose 40-year-old family business in Jersey
City, N.J., produces more than 30 million pounds of dark and milk
chocolate each year, said the import limit for non-fat dry milk is
7,000 pounds a year.
   ``That's what we use in a day,'' said Van Leer, whose company
supplies chocolate to Pepperidge Farm cookies, Godiva chocolates
and Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream.
   Dry milk also is used in the production of dairy products like
ice creams and cottage cheese.
   Van Leer and another major chocolate supplier, M&amp;M Mars of
Hackettstown, N.J., have seen the price of non-fat dry milk
skyrocket from about 85 cents a pound to as much as $2.50 a pound
in October during a period of fall shortages. Prices have dipped
closer to $2 more recently.
   On Nov. 6, New Jersey's two U.S. seators and nine of its House
members appealed to Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter to
suspend the quota and keep chocolate treats on the shelf this
season.
   ``The fall is the busiest season for the chocolate manufacturing
industry as it works to meet increased demand for holiday baking
and gift-giving,'' the lawmakers wrote. ``Without non-fat dry milk,
the availability of a wide variety of chocolate-based goods to the
consumer will be restricted.''
   As of Wednesday, the USDA had provided no detailed response to
the letter, said a spokesman for Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,
whose office drafted the letter.
   Dairy farmers oppose any easing of restrictions, saying non-fat
dry milk supplies have loosened in the last few weeks so that
consumers will not face Christmas without their favorite chocolate
desserts.
   ``We have sympathy with the chocolate industry,'' said Mike
Brown, an economist with the National Milk Producers' Federation.
``We want people who use milk to make a living. But we don't want
the government to do silly things that are going to hurt the
industry.''
   Van Leer said this year's dry milk shortage has forced him to
supply some of his chocolate at a loss because much of his
chocolate sells at prices agreed upon months before shipping.
   ``We're hurt this season, but we're delivering on our
commitments,'' said Van Leer, who has not yet tallied his loss. ``I
haven't had the heart to measure it.''
   Both the dairy farmers and chocolate producers agreed that
something must be done year-round to stop American chocolate buyers
from bypassing milk and sugar import restrictions by purchasing
bulk chocolate from European producers.
   ``We're losing market share,'' Van Leer said. ``The real
solution is to make those chocolates subject to the quotas for
sugar and milk.''

   In Revolutionary times, every Philadelphia
neighborhood had its own brew pub, where a patron could stop for a
pint of beer freshly brewed that day.
   Prohibition seemed to put an end to that, but now there's a
place where someone again can watch beer tapped directly from the
brewing tanks: the Samuel Adams Brew House, a collaboration of
David Mink, owner of the Sansom Street Oyster House, and Jim Koch,
founder of the Boston Beer Co., which brews Samuel Adams beer.
   A pleasant smell of brewing permeates the air, and the vats are
enclosed behind a glass partition, readily seen by patrons. The
tanks have a direct pipeline to the taps at the bar's counter.
   The beer ``comes all of five feet from the brewery to your
glass,'' Koch said.
   ``Freshness is the key ingredient,'' said Mink. ``It makes such
a difference.''
   Of the bar's three traditional beers _ a golden ale, an amber,
and a porter _ the porter drew the most raves from patrons at
Wednesday's opening.
   Rightly so, since the beer took a silver medal last October at
the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, said Jim Pericles, the
brewer.
   One patron, Rich Wagner, described the dark brew _ ``pleasant
with a rich, clean flavor.''
   Wagner, a home brewer, said Philadelphia once was known for its
porters. ``It's a shame that the porters died out earlier in the
century, but now we've got one back,'' he said.
   Another patron, Dan Allan of Philadelphia, was glad that brewing
in general had returned.
   The city was a major brewing center through the 1800s, when a
large influx of German immigrants brought their tradition with them.
   Most of the smaller brewers died out by the turn of the century.
Even the major ones have died out; the last brewery, Schmidt's,
closed in 1987.
   Brew pubs started, like most U.S. trends, in California, when
that state eliminated Prohibition-era legislation banning such
establishments, said Dan Fink, staff member of the Association of
Brewers, a Boulder, Colo.-based research and marketing institution.
   The pubs do well in a variety of large cities like San Francisco
and Chicago, but also are picking up in places like Tempe, Ariz.,
and Lawrence, Kan., Fink said.
   Plans are already under way to bring another brew pub to
Philadelphia.
   Brewmeister Jeff Ware, whose Dock Street Beer is brewed under
contract in Utica, N.Y., also has applied for a liquor license.
Plans for the Dock Street Brewing Co. include a 200-seat capacity,
with a 40-foot bar and 10 copper brewing vats.
   Ware plans to brew five or six varieties _ including wheat beers
in the summer, bock beers in the spring and heavier ale in the
winter.

   Consumer spending fell 0.2 percent in October,
its largest decline in nearly three years, despite a 0.9 percent
gain in personal incomes, the Commerce Department reported today.
   The drop in consumer spending, reflecting plummeting auto sales,
followed a 0.3 percent advance in September. But auto sales have
continued to fall, foretelling continued sluggishness in the
spending sector this quarter.
   Consumer spending is watched closely as a barometer of economic
health because it accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity. The reports provided fresh evidence that the
economy is continuing to slow.
   As measured by the gross national product, the economy grew at a
2.7 percent rate in the third quarter, but analysts expect a sharp
decline in the current three-month period that began in October.
   Personal income in October totaled $4.51 trillion at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate, following a 0.9 percent gain in
September. It was the largest gain since a 1 percent advance last
March.
   Although the San Francisco Bay-area earthquake reduced incomes
by about $21 billion at an annual rate in October, that decrease
was offsetby increases in farm subsidies and bonus payments in the
auto industry.
   Spending declined to an annual rate of $3.53 trillion after a
0.3 percent gain in September. It was the first decrease since a
0.1 percent dip in September 1988 and the largest drop since a 1.4
percent decrease in January 1987.
   The October report showed that Americans' incomes after taxes
also rose 0.9 percent, up from September's 0.2 percent gain.
   Americans' savings rate, savings as a percent of disposable
income, rose 5.7 percent, the highest since a 5.8 percent rate last
June and up from September's 4.7 percent.
   The key component of the income category, wages and salaries,
rose $33 billion last month following a gain of $17 billion in
September.
   Payrolls at manufacturing companies rose by $6.8 billion, up
from a September gain of $300 million.
   Personal incomes totaled $4.51 trillion at an annual rate in
October, compared with $4.47 trillion in the previous month.
   On the spending side, the $6.1 billion decrease in personal
consumption, which includes everything except interest payments on
debt, contrasted to a $9.9 billion gain in September when auto
sales were rising.
   Purchases of durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last
more than three years _ dropped $28.2 billion, while purchases of
non-durable goods edged up $2.5 billion. Spending on services rose
$20.2 billion.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Rise on Signs of Soviet Corn Purchase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were broadly
higher this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade amid indications
that the Soviet Union purchased 2 million to 4 million metric tons
of U.S. corn overnight.
   The rumored buying, which was not confirmed, would be the first
significant grain export deal in several weeks. It sparked a brisk
rally in the grain markets, which have been in a downward trend due
to the slack foreign demand.
   The Soviet Union bought 8 million metric tons of U.S. corn in
October for shipment in November and December, and was expected to
buy more for January-March shipment.
   ``The question was when would they step in, and they stepped in
overnight,'' said Gerald Zusel, manager of Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s
operations on the Board of Trade floor.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to 1\ cents
higher with the contract for delivery in December at $4.07 a
bushel; corn futures were 1} cents to 4 cents higher with December
at $2.38} a bushel; oats were } cent to 1{ cents higher with
December at $1.43{ a bushel; soybeans were 3\ cents to 5{ cents
higher with January at $5.84} a bushel.
   Livestock futures were mostly higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange while pork-belly futures extended their
sharp decline into a third day, reflecting disappointment over the
slow pace of the government's purchase of pork bellies for shipment
to Poland.
   Live cattle futures were unchanged to .05 cent higher with
December at 75.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower
to .30 cent higher with November at 83.90 cents a pound; live hogs
were .03 cent to .28 cent higher with December at 50.72 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .02 cent to 1.50 cents lower with
February at 59.05 cents a pound.
   Frozen pork bellies settled sharply lower on Wednesday, leading
the livestock markets down.

<HEAD>Baby Food Maker To Close Canadian Plant By April</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREMONT, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gerber Products Co. said Thursday it will
close its Niagara Falls, Ontario, plant by April, terminating about
150 jobs.
   The world's largest baby food maker is consolidating production
in its three U.S. plants, in Fremont, Mich.; Fort Smith, Ark., and
Asheville, N.C., Gerber Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David
Johnson said.
   Except for two or three supervisory personnel who may be
transferred, employees at the Canadian plant will be dismissed,
Gerber spokesman Steven W. Poole said.
   Production is to be transferred to the Fremont plant, with some
product lines being moved immediately and some during the coming
months, Poole said.
   Dismissals are not expected to begin until early in 1990, he
said.
   Poole said employees will receive help in finding other jobs as
well as a severance package including two weeks' pay per year of
service, twice what Canadian law requires.
   Those costs will mean a charge of $4.5 million, or 12 cents a
share, against earnings for Gerber's third quarter ending Dec. 31,
the company said. That would cut third-quarter earnings projected
at 58 cents a share, or about $21.8 million, before the change, to
46 cents a share, or $17.3 million.
   Gerber reported earnings of $19.1 million, or 48 cents a share,
for its 1988 third quarter.
   For its fiscal year ended March 31, Gerber reported profits of
$81.4 million, or $4.13 a share, on sales of $1.07 billion.
   Gerber has about 70 percent of the U.S. baby food market and
about 25 percent of the Canadian market.
   It still will pursue Canadian sales, offering its full
U.S.-produced array of 184 products rather than just the 94
produced at the Niagara Falls plant, Poole said.
   He said studies that led to closing the Niagara Falls plant were
based on conditions prior to the U.S.-Canadian free trade agreement
adopted this year, and the plant would have been closed with or
without the agreement.
   In addition to baby food, Gerber markets infant and children's
wear under the Gerber, Buster Brown and Weather Tamer labels. The
company employs nearly 15,000 people.

<HEAD>Weapons Maker Struggles To Regain Image Against Corruption Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHAN RAPP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KARLSKOGA, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For more than a century the name Bofors
commanded respect as a maker of top-quality weapons and a flagship
of Swedish industry. When scandals rocked Bofors, all of Sweden
trembled.
   Bofors has become synonymous with corruption in the murky world
of the international arms trade. Its questioned dealings with Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi helped bring him down in India's recent
elections.
   A trial of three former Bofors executives has exposed evidence
of foul play in the corridors of power. The corruption charges have
deflated the faith many Swedes had in the honesty of their
leadership.
   Two affairs concerning Bofors were uncovered in the last five
years:
   _Bofors was accused of paying up to $50 million in bribes to
secure a 1986 contract to sell $1.4 billion in artillery guns to
India.
   _Bofors executives were tried on charges of violating export
restrictions in 1979-81 to sell advanced surface-to-air missiles to
Middle East countries by using Singapore as an intermediary. The
verdict is due Dec. 22.
   Other arms manufacturers have been implicated in other cases of
alleged unauthorized sales.
   Bofors spokesman Borje Johanson, a former army lieutenant
colonel, said Bofors now is ``playing strictly by the book'' and
concentrating on ``delivering good products and fullfilling
contracts.'' Unethical deals ``will not exist,'' he said.
   AB Bofors does not see itself as just another Swedish company.
In the entrance to the company's elegant headquarters hangs a
portrait of Alfred Nobel, the benefactor of the Nobel prizes who
once owned Bofors.
   Bofors is Sweden's largest weapons manufacturer and belongs to
the Nobel Industries Group, one of the powerhouses of Swedish
industry. Though privately owned, Bofors operates almost like a
government company.
   Production is tuned to the needs of the Swedish military and
exports are severly restricted according to regulations forbidding
sales to countries in conflict or in volatile regions.
   This country of only 8.4 million people produces supersonic
warplanes, submarines, and surface battle ships. Bofors alone makes
a range of artillery, missiles, air defense systems and explosives.
   Sweden says it needs an independent arms industry and strong
defense to give teeth to its neutrality and avoid entanglements
with any military alliance.
   Each foreign sale must be approved by the War Materials
Inspection Board, a government agency, under a strict set of rules.
   At their 10-week trial, the former Bofors directors admitted
skirting the export restrictions by selling the equipment to
Singapore. But they claimed they were innocent of criminal activity
because the government tacitly approved the sales.
   One of the defense attorneys, Goran Ekdahl, said a system of
tacit agreements had been practiced for 20 years because the
government wanted to avoid an open debate about where its weaponry
was being used.
   Government officials and former ministers denied knowing the
weapons were being sold to blacklisted countries. But testimony and
documents showed that the security police and at least some
officials were informed and took no action to stop the sales.
   In 1987, when the affairs were being scrutinized, the head of
the War Material Inspection Board, Carl Algernon, fell in front of
a subway train, in what police ruled was an apparent suicide.
   Gunnar Adler-Karlsson, an economics professor, author and social
critic, said he believed top government officials were lying in the
Bofors case.
   ``I cannot prove it, but it is absolutely clear as far as I am
concerned, that all ministers of trade and war material inspectors
understood that what was officially going to Singapore, absolutely
would not stay in Singapore,'' Adler-Karlsson said.
   Bofors' image problems were compounded by its handling of the
bribery accusations in the Indian howitzer contract.
   Bofors denied the allegations but rejected demands from Indian
opposition leaders to open its books. Gandhi also denied that any
Indian had received kickbacks or commissions. But he resigned last
week after his Congress Party failed to win a majority in national
elections that focused on charges of corruption and ineptitude.
   Bofors officials said they were intent on riding out the storm,
because it was a matter of company ethics not to reveal classifed
parts of a business contract.
   ``We cannot contradict the wish of the customer, or the
contracts we have signed, and go out and reveal the content of
various agreements,'' said Johanson, the company spokesman.
   ``If we did, it would mean that in the long run, we and Sweden
couldn't sign agreements and be trusted that this is an issue
between buyer and seller,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Business is booming in business class.
   In the competitive airline industry, many big carriers are
racing to cash in on the growing popularity of business class,
which is more expensive than economy but cheaper than first class.
   Business class is found mainly on international flights. It has
grown as business has become more globalized, boosting air travel
abroad.
   ``It reflects the amount of international business that's
happening,'' said Randy Petersen, editor and publisher of Frequent,
a monthly newsletter published in Colorado Springs, Colo.
   Jet-powered executives look for service, comfort and more space
to work in as they shuttle between the United States, Western
Europe and the Far East. And their companies are willing to pay
extra for them to arrive in better shape.
   A lot extra. A business class ticket from New York to London,
for example, costs around $1,400 to $1,500 one way, compared with
an economy fare of $450 to $865. First class, which provides even
more pampering than the business cabins, is the steepest: $2,400 to
$2,800 one way for the same flight.
   In return, business class passengers get separate check-in
counters and special lounges at airports, and separate cabins in
the air with wider seats, fancier food, free liquor and other
amenities. They also get a lot more attention than passengers in
the cramped coach section: the ratio of flight attendants to fliers
increases from economy to business to first.
   Who flies in business class? United Airlines says about 80
percent of its business fliers are men, mainly business executives,
with an average income of more than $80,000 a year. They average 11
airline trips per year, two of which are international.
   Some big U.S. airlines, aiming to capitalize on the business
class boom, are emulating foreign carriers with strong reputations
for international service.
   United, for example, recently announced that it is spending more
than $45 million to upgrade its business class service, in what it
calls the largest renovation program in U.S. airline history.
British Airways PLC, whose revenue from business class has jumped
106 percent in the past year, spent $40 million on an upgrade
program in early 1988.
   ``Business class customers are very important to our
international air travel business,'' United Chairman Stephen M.
Wolf said in launching the improvement program. ``These new
enhancements will give our international service a strong
competitive edge.''
   Chicago-based United offers business class on its flights to and
from the Far East _ the world's longest hauls, where comfort
becomes even more important. Its flight from Los Angeles to Sydney,
Australia, for example, takes 14 hours and 40 minutes.
   Business class accounted for around $390 million of United's
$8.9 billion in revenue in 1988. The airline plans to include the
service on its new flights to Europe next spring.
   Some U.S. airlines are catching up with big foreign carriers in
the international service game, said Dan Smith, director of
industry relations for the International Airline Passengers
Association in Dallas.
   In the United States, where the airlines have been deregulated
since 1978, cheap fares and reduced labor costs have been
emphasized more than service. Carriers in Western Europe and the
Far East, on the other hand, still operate mainly under government
control of fares and routes.
   Closer to home, only Trans World Airlines and Pan Am offer
business class to any significant extent on domestic U.S. flights _
notably on coast-to-coast flights, which use bigger jets.
   The smaller, narrow-body jets used for most domestic flights are
difficult to divide up into three sections, so the majority of U.S.
flights offer only economy and first class.
   In addition, many companies will pay for employees to fly
business class on long overseas trips but will limit them to
economy on domestic flights.
   TWA, which gets 12 percent to 13 percent of its revenue from
business class and advertises its service aggressively, provides it
on many flights from its St. Louis hub as well as on
transcontinental and international trips.
   ``We saw a niche to fill,'' said Jim Faulkner, a spokesman for
TWA in St. Louis.
   As an inducement to passengers, its domestic business class
often costs only slightly more than economy. TWA's one-way business
class fare from St. Louis to Boston, for example, is $411, compared
with $391 in coach and $670 in first class.
   Rival Pan Am offers passengers on transcontinental flights a
business class ticket at the same price as a full economy fare:
$588 one way from New York to Los Angeles.
   A fair number of business class fliers pay less than the full
fare because they fly a lot. Around 20 percent to 30 percent of
business class passengers are flying on bonus upgrades from coach
accrued in frequent flier programs, Frequent editor Petersen
estimates.

<DATELINE>WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford of Canada said Thursday it will
close an engine plant at the end of 1990, eliminating 900 jobs.
   The announcement to halt engine and stamping production at
Engine Plant 2 in Windsor was expected since no product had been
allocated for the 67-year-old plant past the end of next year.
   The Canadian Auto Workers recently urged Ford to make a decision
on the plant's future to allow workers to look for other jobs.
   The plant also was shut down in 1981 during a slump in the
automotive industry, but it was temporarily reactived in 1983 to
meet increased demand for the five-liter V-8 engine.
   Ford has been telling workers for the last few years that there
is no production planned for the plant at the end of 1990, said Leo
Brown, manager of Ford's Windsor engine plants.
   The city has two other Ford engine plants, a casting plant and
an aluminum plant.
   The number of Ford cars using the five-liter engine has declined
and some have been replaced by the 3.8-litre engine, Brown said.

<HEAD>Man Held in Alleged Plot To Kidnap Texas Billionaire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man was held Thursday on racketeering
and extortion charges for an alleged plot to kidnap Texas
billionaire Robert Bass and hold him for $5 million ransom,
authorities said.
   Austin James Veleff, 57, of Germantown, Tenn., was arrested by
FBI agents Wednesday after he had driven to Texas with an
undercover agent he thought was going to help him.
   The arrest came after Veleff took pictures of City Place, a
33-story office complex built by the Bass family where Robert Bass
has his office.
   Carroll Andre, an assistant U.S. attorney in Memphis, Tenn.,
said Veleff had never met Bass and had no connection with him. He
had made Bass the target of a kidnapping after reading about him in
a business magazine, Andre said.
   Federal authorities had been aware of the alleged plot since
May. But Andre said Veleff told the undercover agent he had been
planning to abduct Bass for seven years.
   Dee Kelly, a lawyer for the Bass family, declined to comment.
   FBI agent William Fallin of Memphis, the agent in charge of the
investigation, said Veleff planned to ask for $5 million ransom
after taking Bass to south Texas.
   Veleff, an advertising salesman for the Memphis Commercial
Appeal newspaper for about 20 years, had operated a swimming pool
business for about eight years before becoming unemployed.
   If convicted, Veleff could face a maximum prison term of five
years and a fine of up to $250,000.
   Andre said that in addition to the $5 million ransom Veleff
talked about filming Bass ``in distressing situations'' and seeking
an additional $20 million after the initial ransom had been
delivered by plane to a mountain in Mexico.
   The alleged plot called for a pilot to be informed to drop the
money on a specified mountain about 45 miles south of border, Andre
said.
   Bass, 41, has a reported wealth of $1.44 billion, according to
Forbes magazine. His brothers, Sid Richardson Bass, 46; Lee
Marshall Bass, 33; and Edward Perry Bass, 44, also are reported
billionaires.
   The Bass family's business interests include oil, gas and
various investments.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was mixed against the major
foreign currencies Thursday in thin European trading, dealers said.
   Gold prices declined.
   After little movement, the dollar fell sharply late in the day
on rumors that U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
was resigning because of his one-time consulting role with a
troubled savings and loan association.
   A denial by the Federal Reserve helped steady the dollar, but
dealers said a large order hitting the market at the same time as
the rumors added to the quick, sharp decline.
   There was brief dollar buying early in the day after the
assassination of Deutsche Bank Chairman Alfred Herrhausen, traders
said. They said the buying focused on the potentially destabilizing
effect a new wave of terrorism would have on Germany and its
economy.
   Dealers said the end of the month trading was very thin, giving
smaller orders greater impact on prices.
   ``No one wants to be adventurous on the last day of the month,''
said one London corporate dealer. ``The market won't be too lively
now,'' he said, predicting the markets would remain quiet until the
end of the year.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.45 yen from Wednesday's close of
143.35 yen to a closing 142.90 Japanese yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.5700 from $1.5655 late
Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's prices, included: 1.7800 West German mark, down from
1.7825; 1.5910 Swiss francs, up from 1.5895; 6.0725 French francs,
down from 6.0810; 2.0150 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0100; 1,311.50
Italian lire, down from 1,315.50; 1.1632 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1658.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $410.60 a troy ounce,
down from $412.50 late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of $409.50, down from
$411.70 late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $5.59 to close at a bid $405.76.
   Silver fell in London to a late bid price of $5.64 a troy ounce,
down from $5.65 late Wednesday.

   Advancing issues outpaced decliners by about 7 to 6 on the NYSE,

   Retail and oil stocks were among the gainers, while some broader

   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 103.15 million
shares.
   Analysts said many institutional players remained sidelined,
unwilling to make commitments before getting more clarification on
where the economy and interest rates are headed.
   The market firmed early behind a strengthening bond market.
Analysts said a drop in the Chicago-area Purchasing Management
Association index to 49.1 percent from 51.7 percent for November
suggested a further weakening of the economy and lent some support
to bond prices.
   ``It reaffirms a sluggish economy, which again raises
speculation the Fed will ease,'' said Hildegarde Zagorski, analyst

   A government report that showed consumer spending fell 0.2
percent in October also helped the bond market.

<TEXT>
   Hitachi Ltd. reported Thursday that its net profit
jumped 19 percent in its fiscal half-year, boosted by growing sales
in Japan and abroad.
   Japan's largest manufacturer of electric and electronic products
said its net profit rose to 101.2 billion yen, or around $723
million, in the six months ended Sept. 30 from 84.9 billion yen, or
$607 million, a year earlier.
   Per-share earnings increased to 31.71 yen, or 23 cents, from
27.40 yen, or 20 cents, in the same period a year earlier.
   Half-year sales rose 12 percent to 3.485 trillion yen, or $24.9
billion, from 3.117 trillion yen, or $22.3 billion. Overseas sales
jumped 10 percent to 786 billion yen, or $5.6 billion, accounting
for 23 percent of total sales.
   Consumer products were the only division that registered a
decline in sales, Hitachi said. They dipped 4 percent to 486.4
billion yen, or $3.5 billion.
   Company officials said air conditioners didn't sell well in
Japan because of cool weather in early summer this year. In
addition, they said, sales of color televisions were adversely
affected by the political repression in China and camcorder sales
turned sluggish under the pressure of intensifying price
competition.
   For the full fiscal year, Hitachi anticipates net profit of
around 210 billion yen, or $1.5 billion, up from 185.5 billion yen,
or $1.32 billion, a year earlier. The company expects full-year
sales to rise to an estimated 7 trillion yen, or $50 billion, from
6.40 trillion yen, or $45.7 billion.

   Textron Inc. on Thursday named James F.
Hardymon, president of a St. Louis electrical products company, as
its president and chief operating officer.
   Hardymon, 55, will replace B.F. Dolan as president Jan. 1.
Dolan, 62, will remain as Textron's chairman and chief executive
officer.
   Dolan is expected to retire at age 65 and Hardymon would replace
him as chairman, the company said.
   Textron, based in Providence, is a conglomerate focused on
aerospace technology, commercial products and financial services.
   Textron reported third-quarter earnings of $59.5 million, or 66
cents per share, compared with 1988 results of $62.8 million, or 72
cents per share. Revenue increased about $17 million from year-ago
quarter to $1.7 billion.
   The drop of more than 5 percent in third-quarter earnings was
blamed mostly on higher costs in its aerospace businessses and soft
sales of auto products.
   Hardymon spent 28 years with Emerson Electric, and served as the
company's president since October 1988. Emerson, a global
manufacturer of electrical products and systems, reported fiscal
1989 sales of approximately $7.1 billion.
   Before becoming Emerson's president, Hardymon served as vice
president, chief operating officer and a director.

<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices closed mostly
higher Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid indications the
Soviet Union bought 2 million to 4 million metric tons of U.S. corn.
   Wheat futures ended mostly lower as some traders simultaneously
sold wheat and bought corn.
   The rumored Soviet buying, which was not confirmed, would
represent the first significant grain export deal in several weeks.
It sparked a brisk rally in the corn and soybean markets at the
opening bell.
   But prices closed below their opening levels, perhaps reflecting
an overriding bearish sentiment.
   Considering the size of the rumored Soviet purchase, ``the
market didn't act all that well,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   The Soviet Union bought 8 million metric tons of U.S. corn in
October for shipment in November and December, and was expected to
buy more for shipment in January through March.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 2\ cents lower to 2 cents

bushel; corn futures were \ cent lower to 3{ cents higher with
December at $2.38\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1{ cents higher

<HEAD>Congressmen Urge Bush to Push Trade With Soviets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-three congressmen urged President Bush
on Thursday to give priority in his talks with Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev to ending a rule that imposes high U.S. tariffs
on imports from the Soviet Union.
   Bush has power to waive the Jackson-Vanik amendment, a provision
in U.S. trade law that denies the Soviets the ``most favored
nation'' status because of limits on emigration. China, Hungary and
Poland already have the status.
   ``The Soviet government has come a long way in addressing the
concerns we have long expressed,'' the congressmen said in a letter
to Bush as he was leaving for the talks with Gorbachev in the
Mediterranean.
   ``Assuming you are assured of continued Soviet progress, it is
now time to recognize and reward Soviet progress with a waiver
under Jackson-Vanik,'' they said.
   At the end of August, the Soviet Union had allowed more than
96,000 of its citizens to leave, more than in any entire year for
the past two decades.
   The letter was signed six senators, including Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, and 27 House members. All are Democrats
except for six House members.
   Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y., who last June introduced a resolution
supporting a waiver once Bush received assurances on free
emigration from Moscow. The Supreme Soviet is expected to complete
action in January on a bill to free emigration.
   The lower tariffs would only take effect after Soviet and U.S.
officials negotiate a trade accord. It was agreed earlier this
month to create working parties that would start work on the
agreement, but Valery Sorokin, economic counselor at the Soviet
Embassy, said on Thursday that they have not yet met.
   Formal negotiations are expected to start later and American
officials say they would take several months, after which Bush
would issue the waiver.

   Occidental Petroleum Corp. said Thursday it
has received British government approval to redevelop the Piper oil
field in the North Sea, where an explosion on a company platform
killed 167 men.
   The Piper Alpha platform off Scotland exploded in flames on July
6, 1988, and was destroyed.
   Occidental said the Piper field will be redeveloped with a
production platform designed to handle up to 140,000 barrels of oil
per day and accommodate up to 24 wells.
   Within the next few days, a 200-ton underwater drilling template
will be installed at the location of the new platform to allow up
to six wells to be pre-drilled, Occidental said.
   Occidental shut down all its North Sea production after the
explosion. It reopened production from the Scapa field last July,
and company chairman Armand Hammer said Occidental remained
committed to long-term production of North Sea oil.
   Hammer said in a statement that in addition to Piper, the
company plans to develop two satellite oil fields, Chanter and East
Piper, with combined reserves in excess of 100 million barrels of
oil.
   Occidental operates the Piper field with a 36.5 percent
interest. Partners are Texaco Britain Ltd. with 23.5 percent, LASMO
North Sea PLC with 20 percent and Union Texas Petroleum Ltd. with
20 percent.

   Eastman Kodak Co. on Thursday said more than 90
percent of the regular employees who are being cut by the end of
the year are leaving voluntarily with special benefits rather than

   Kodak said it expected to trim 4,500 to 5,000 jobs by the end of

   About 80 percent are regular employees. The rest are temporary
or supplemental employees who are being cut without special

   The job cuts are apart from reductions in employment due to
divestitures of businesses. Kodak is cutting jobs as part of a plan
announced in August to generate up to $1 billion in operating cash

<HEAD>Sikorsky To Lay Off About 150, Citing Military Spending Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STRATFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sikorsky Aircraft said it will lay off
about 150 hourly workers Friday in part because of shrinking U.S.
and international defense spending.
   The layoffs, announced Wednesday in a notice posted at four
company plants in Connecticut, will be the first in Sikorsky's
blue-collar work force since February 1988, when the helicopter
builder laid off 19 hourly workers.
   Sikorsky, a division of Hartford-based United Technologies Inc.,
laid off 350 salaried workers in July, a 6 percent cut in its
salaried ranks.
   ``This employee reduction must be made to remain competitive in
the face of shrinking worldwide defense budgets in the years to
come,'' Sikorsky Vice President John A. Carpino said in the notice.
   He also said that ``future production of U.S. military
helicopters will be reduced below anticipated levels despite strong
Congressional support for Sikorsky's programs during the current
budget cycle.''
   Wolfgang Demish, a defense industry analyst with UBS Securities
in New York, said the company will likely be forced to consider
further reductions.
   ``To the extent that there's a relaxation of military tensions
worldwide, the demand for military helicopters worldwide is going
down. Sikorsky remains at risk of further cuts,'' he said.
   The layoffs will leave Sikorsky with a total work force of about
12,650, including 6,550 hourly workers, company spokesman Larry
Bingaman said.
   The notice said Sikorsky will continue to assess employment
levels in light of its projected work load. Bingaman declined to
say if the company expects further layoffs.
   ``I don't think many people are projecting an increase in the
defense budget, either in the United States or internationally, in
the years to come,'' he said.
   Although it has tried to boost sales of its commercial
helicopter, the S-76, more than 80 percent of Sikorsky's sales
continue to be military. The company also has been pushing foreign
sales of its U.S. military aircraft.
   Foreign sales represented only 6 percent of the company's sales
five years ago but are expected to represent 25 percent this year,
Bingaman said.

   Readers of The Detroit News in most of
Michigan are getting used to eating breakfast without the paper,
but some subscribers in the Upper Peninsula are upset they can't
see it daily.
   The News became an afternoon paper for most of Michigan on
Monday under a partial merger with its rival, the Detroit Free
Press.
   But in the Upper Peninsula west of tiny Naubinway, the News
ceased circulation because the papers can't be trucked there
quickly enough for significant street sales, said William Stille,
an assistant circulation manager for the merged Detroit Newspaper
Agency.
   Naubinway is about 500 miles from Detroit.
   Some patrons are angry about about the canceled service,
northern Michigan circulation manager Dale Powers said.
   ``...You really at times don't realize how important that
morning paper is to people,'' Powers said. ``Some people can't eat
breakfast without their paper. It's like a disease.''
   Upper Peninsula residents have other choices for morning
newspapers. The Milwaukee Sentinel and the Chicago Tribune
circulate editions there.
   The Detroit Free Press, also a morning paper, is available in
the area.
   Before the change, the News delivered to about 450 homes in the
Upper Peninsula as well as to some businesses, Powers said. The
area comprised about 1 percent to 2 percent of the News'
circulation, said Stille.
   Now the weekday News is put aboard trucks for outer Michigan at
8 a.m., arriving for distribution at Gaylord at 1 p.m. From there,
it is several more hours to newsstands in the Upper Peninsula,
Powers said.
   ``We're still delivering in Newberry, Sault Ste. Marie and St.
Ignace, but even those gentlemen are finishing their routes in the
dark,'' he said.
   Joint weekend editions produced with the Free Press will be
available in the Upper Peninsula.

<HEAD>Third World Rejects EC Trade And Aid Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community's 66 partners
from Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific Ocean on Thursday rejected a
$13.5 billion trade and aid offer.
   The package, which the EC said was not negotiable, was ``very
much below the request'' of the Third World associates, Nigerian
Ambassador to the EC Joshua Iroha said.
   The Third World countries had asked for $17.5 billion.
   ``The ACP group expresses its deep concern and disappointment,''
Iroha said, adding that European Community aid had regularly
decreased in real terms since their first agreement was signed in
1975.
   The countries claimed the diminishing volume of aid granted over
the past 15 years could only be compensated by raising the funds to
$17.5 billion in the next agreement.
   Iroha said talks with the 12-member European trading bloc will
continue. He said if no solution is found, a plenary meeting of the
66 countries would be called to decide on further steps.
   The European Community nations agreed Monday on the new trade
and aid offer after a year of talks.

   Stock prices rallied in moderate trading today,
after new economic indicators raised investor hopes for lower
interest rates.
   Stocks opened on a firm tone behind a strengthening bond market
after new reports pointed to a slowdown in fourth-quarter economic
growth.
   The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending fell 0.2
percent in October despite a 0.9 percent rise in persona incomes.
   Another report by the Purchasing Management Association showed a
decline in a Chicago-area economic index for November to 49.1
percent from 51.7 percent. Analysts said that set the tone for the
purchasing agents' nationwide survey due out on Friday.
   ``It would indicate a further softening of the economy and
probable cause of the Fed to loosen interest rates,'' said Charles
Jensen, chief technical analyst for MKI Securities Corp.
   Lower interest rates would stimulate economic growth, including
corporate earnings.
   However, while blue chip issues were relatively strong, the
secondary market continued to languish, traders said.
   Bank stocks remained under pressure amid interest rate worries
and concern about leveraged buyout loans. New federal regulations
require banks to report loans for buyouts, acquisitions and
recapitalizations.

   Energy futures prices rallied Thursday paced by
strong demand for wholesale home heating oil.
   Analysts said heavy buying in London's heating oil market
spilled over into U.S. trading pits. The onset of colder
temperatures throughout much of the United States also has boosted
demand.
   The contract for December delivery of No.2 heating oil surged
2.10 cents to 62.71 cents a gallon after rising 0.30 cent on
Wednesday. It was the last trading day for the December contract
and some of the buying may have been tied to the expiration.
   The January contract, which becomes the nearest-month contract
on Friday, gained 1.77 cents to 61.81 cents a gallon. The February
and March contracts ended with slightly smaller increases.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the New York
Merc, wholesale unleaded gasoline for December delivery finished
0.57 cent higher at 50.29 cents a gallon, adding to Wednesday's
increase of 0.19 cent. The January contract, which will replace the
expired December contract on Friday, pushed ahead 0.71 cent to
51.35. Contracts for later delivery posted larger gains.
   The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, added 49 cents to close at $19.89 per
42-gallon barrel. The contract had gone up 15 cents on Wednesday.
Contracts for delivery in February through April finished with
slighter greater gains.
   Richard Redoglia of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s energy trading
division said: ``The strength of this market stemmed from the
London gas-oil market.''
   He said the demand in London exceeded normal seasonal increases
and carried the gas-oil contract _ the London equivalent of U.S.
heating oil _ past psychologically significant levels.
   A belief that winter weather has finally arrived to stay after
an abnormally mild autumn also has lifted heating oil futures
lately, he said.
   Energy traders continued to mull the implications of an OPEC
agreement reached earlier this week at the cartel's winter
conference. The feeling remained oil prices could be weighed down
by the pact raising the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries' self-imposed daily production limit.
   Ministers from the cartel's 13 members agreed to raise their
output ceiling to 22 million barrels for the first half of next
year from the current 20.5 million barrels.

   Carl Icahn's latest move on USX Corp. sent the
company's stock climbing Thursday, but analysts say the takeover
strategist's plans regarding the energy and steel giant are no
clearer than they were before.
   Icahn, who owns Trans World Airlines Inc., has indicated several
times in recent years that he might acquire a substantial stake in
USX. But he has made an actual public buyout offer only once _ and
that was dropped following rejection by the USX board.
   ``I'm not sure whether this is a mountain or a molehill,'' said
John Jacobson, vice president of steel consulting for AUS
Consultants in Philadelphia.
   Jacobson said Icahn's disclosure Wednesday that he was
requesting federal approval to acquire at least 25 percent of
Pittsburgh-based corporation was ``just something he had to do to
keep his options open.''
   Gregory Drahuschak, an analyst with Butcher &amp; Singer in
Pittsburgh, said he has ``serious doubts'' Icahn would try to take
over USX.
   ``There's no way you'll make me believe he wants to run the
company,'' Drahuschak said. ``It's the capital commitment that
would be required. ... We're talking serious money.''
   Based on its roughly 257.5 million outstanding common shares,
USX has a market value of some $8.8 billion.
   USX stock rose 75 cents to $34.37{ Thursday in active New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   Icahn's latest filing could be an attempt to prod USX Chairman
Charles Corry to speed up restructuring or sell major assets,
analysts said. Icahn long has advocated a spinoff of USX's steel
division, formerly known as United States Steel, as a way to boost
shareholder values.
   ``Is he waving a paper tiger before USX again? Is he asking for
a divestiture of its oil and gas properties? We don't know,'' said
George Zimmermann, director of research at Gruntal &amp; Co. in New
York.
   Icahn is seeking antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade
Commission to increase his USX stake. According to a filing
Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Icahn owned
nearly 34 million, or 13.26 percent, of USX's outstanding common
shares.
   A USX spokesman declined comment Thursday except to say Icahn
made similar requests in late 1987 and late 1988 but never boosted
his stake to the amount requested in the allotted year.
   Corry said Wednesday that he had a long telephone conversation
with Icahn last Friday and Icahn gave no indication what he planned
to do with the stock.
   ``He said once again that he thought the company's stock would
perform better if we didn't have holdings in steel and oil. He
wants one or the other,'' Corry told reporters following a speech.
   Icahn was in meetings Thursday, his secretary said. He did not
immediately return a phone call to his New York office seeking
comment.
   Icahn made a $7.19 billion, or $31 a share, offer for USX in
early 1987 but dropped the proposal after the USX board rejected
it. When he made his bid, there was speculation he only wanted to
drive up the stock price and profit from it, but he did not sell
his shares when he abandoned the offer.
   ``I think one of the reasons Icahn bought into the business is
he felt the breakup value of the pieces are greater than the value
of the whole,'' Jacobson said. ``I think that's why USX continues
to be a speculative stock candidate.''
   Zimmermann and Charles A. Bradford, senior analyst for Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets in New York, value USX stock at less than $30
a share.
   But Jacobson said the stock might be worth nearly $50 a share if
assets are sold and proceeds go to shareholders.

<TEXT>
   In a country of business giants,
Deutsche Bank chief Alfred Herrhausen towered over the rest.
   Herrhausen, 59, was killed Thursday by a bomb as he was being
driven to work. The terrorist Red Army Faction claimed
responsibility.
   Herrhausen was a friend and economic adviser to Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, who was in tears over the murder. Kohl often sought
Herrhausen's advice and asked the banker to accompany him on
several foreign trips.
   Herrhausen's voice, articulating a clear vision of the need for
expansion and new fields of business, was the most influential in
the business circles of West Germany, Europe's largest exporting
nation.
   ``He was a towering presence in the international financial
community,'' Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Chairman William A. Schreyer said
in a statement in New York. ``Mr. Herrhausen combined warmth of
character with consummate banking skills and en extraordinary
vision of world affairs.''
   ``Deutsche Bank is not without a head, but it will be without a
brilliant voice for a while,'' said Thomas Albrecht, an analyst
with London's UBS Phillips and Drew, the brokerage unit of the
Union Bank of Switzerland.
   Herrhausen had expanded the reach of West Germany's largest bank
throughout Western Europe and was broadening the bank's securities
and corporate finance business in New York and Tokyo.
   Under Herrhausen, the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank has been
expanding aggressively in Western Europe, preparing for a leading
role as the Common Market moves toward a barrier-free internal
market of 1992.
   Efforts to gain a foothold in investment banking culminated this
week in the $640 million takeover bid for the British investment
bank Morgan Grenfell Group PLC.
   Deutsche Bank has also acquired major operating interests in
Spain and Italy, and was one of the first West German companies to
be quoted on the Tokyo stock exchange.
   His next goal was Eastern Europe, although he had words of
caution for West German businesses seeking to expand in the
reform-minded countries of the Soviet bloc.
   Herrhausen repeatedly had called for a restructuring of the
massive debts of Third World nations.
   During Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit to Bonn in
June, Herrhausen said it could take 20 years or more for the
outmoded Soviet economy to achieve Western standards. He put the
time at five to 10 years for East Germany.
   Herrhausen engineered the largest industrial restructuring in
West German history, the merger of Daimler-Benz with aerospace
giant Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm.
   He used the bank's 28 percent share in the country's No. 1
conglomerate, Daimler-Benz, to push the behemoth behind cars and
trucks into electronics, aerospace and even outer space ventures.
   Kohl praised Herrhausen's sense of social responsiblity, perhaps
a reflection of the bank chief's lifelong devotion to philosophy.
   Herrhausen was concerned by the public's lack of knowledge about
the huge financial deals taking place in the bank's twin glimmering
towers overlooking Frankfurt and brought in a former radio
executive to improve communication with ordinary citizens.
   ``Abroad, Herrhausen was one of the shining examples of German
management,'' said Thomas Schiessle, a banking analyst with the
Berliner Handels-und Frankfurter Bank. ``As such, he was an
exceptional figure who cannot be replaced.''
   Herrhausen was born on Jan. 30, 1930, in Essen in the grimy Ruhr
industrial area and attended a Bavarian school, called the Napola,
set up by the Nazis for gifted children.
   He graduated from the University of Cologne with a degree in
economics and business and later received a doctorate in economics.
   Herrhausen originally pursued a career in industry, working as a
manager at Ruhrgas AG, West Germany's largest gas company. He also
worked as board member at Vereinigte Elektrizitaetswerke AG, a
power company.
   In 1969, he was recruited by the Deutsche Bank, where he worked
in the economics department and in its important North American
operations. He become co-chairman in 1985 and the sole chairman in
1988.
   He is survived by a wife and two daughters.

<HEAD>Dollar, Gold Close Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mostly lower in light trading
Thursday amid more signs of a slowing economy. Gold prices were
mixed.
   The dollar fell in response to a Commerce Department report that
personal income rose 0.9 percent in October and rumors that
purchasing executives in Chicago believed the economy was
weakening, said Marc Chandler, a currency market analyst with MMS
International in Chicago.
   Both developments ``didn't contradict the idea that the U.S.
economy continued to slow down,'' Chandler said.
   When the economy slows, financial markets expect the Federal
Reserve to nudge interest rates lower. Declining rates make the
dollar less attractive, and the U.S. currency tends to fall when
yields decline.
   The dollar also slipped as traders who had taken profits against
the West German mark in recent days began to rebuild their
positions, Chandler said.
   The dollar fell to 1.7815 marks in New York from 1.7875 late
Wednesday after dropping earlier in Frankfurt to 1.7800 marks from
late Wednesday's 1.7825.
   Volume was light as many traders awaited two economic figures to
be released Friday, the government's Index of Leading Indicators
and the National Association of Purchasing Management's monthly
assessment of the economy.
   ``Right now, dollar sentiment is so poor, we really need some
strong fundamental data in order for it to rally,'' Chandler said.
   Overseas dealers said the dollar fell sharply late in the day on
rumors that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan was resigning because of
his one-time consulting role with the troubled Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association.
   Joe Coyne, a Fed spokesman, said the rumors were ``absolutely
not true,'' and the denial helped steady the dollar somewhat.
   There was brief dollar buying early in the day after the
assassination of Deutsche Bank Chairman Alfred Herrhausen, the
overseas traders said. They said the buying focused on the
potentially destabilizing effect a new wave of terrorism would have
on West Germany and its economy.
   Late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's
quotes, included: 1.5930 Swiss francs, up from 1.5920; 6.0840
French francs, down from 6.0935; 1,312.25 Italian lire, down from
1,318.75; and 1.16405 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16525.
   The dollar lost ground against the British pound. In New York,
sterling rose to $1.5700 from late Wednesday's $1.5678, and in
London, the pound rose to $1.5700 from $1.5655.
   The dollar also fell against the Japanese yen, declining to
142.80 yen in New York from 142.825 late Wednesday. In Tokyo, the
dollar fell to 142.90 yen from 143.35 yen, and it was unchanged in
London at 143.15 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's prices, included: 1.5910 Swiss francs, up from 1.5895;
6.0725 French francs, down from 6.0810; 2.0150 Dutch guilders, up
from 2.0100; 1,311.50 Italian lire, down from 1,315.50; 1.1632
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1658.
   Gold prices rose in U.S. trading after falling overseas.
   In New York, a troy ounce of gold rose $2.10 to $411.60 on the
Commodity Exchange, and Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of
$410.65 for a troy ounce, up $2.95.
   Gold fell earlier in London to a late bid price of $410.60 a
troy ounce, down from $412.50 late Wednesday. In Zurich, the metal
fell to a closing bid of $409.50, down from $411.70 late Wednesday.
   In Hong Kong, gold fell $5.59 to close at a bid $405.76.
   Silver prices also were mixed. Silver rose 6.8 cents to $5.668 a
troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange after falling in London to a
late bid price of $5.64, down from $5.65 late Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   The three broadest measures of the nation's
money supply rose in the week ended Nov. 20, the Federal Reserve
Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose
to a seasonally adjusted $791.0 billion from $785.0 billion the
previous week.
   The measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $3,200.2
billion from $3,193.4 billion.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,049.8 billion from $4,045.9 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.2 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.9 percent, which is within the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,169.8 billion, an 8.0
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,024.1 billion, up 3.4 percent, while M1
rose 5.0 percent to an average of $784.5 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $656 million a day in the week ended Nov. 29, up sharply
from $182 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $292.4 billion in the two-week period ended
Nov. 29, down from $294.8 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Pork Bellies Fall Limit for Third Straight Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pork belly futures prices plunged the permitted daily limit for
the third straight day Thursday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
as traders disappointed by the low level of exports fled the
collapsing market.
   Livestock futures finished mixed on the Merc.
   On other commodity markets, gold futures rebounded after three
days of losses; energy futures rallied; and grains and soybeans
were mostly higher.
   Frozen pork belly futures settled .40 cent to the limit 2 cents
lower with the contract for delivery in February down 2 cents at
58.55 cents a pound.
   In livestock trading, live cattle futures settled .05 cent to
.25 cent lower with December at 74.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle
were .05 cent to .20 cent lower with January at 82.62 cents a
pound; live hogs were .13 cent to .33 cent higher with December at
50.85 cents a pound.
   The February pork belly contract has lost more 6 cents, or 9.6
percent of its value so far this week after rising sharply during
the past two months amid the excitement surrounding the political
changes occurring in Eastern Europe.
   The rally got its start with the Bush administration's pledge of
food aid to Poland _ a package that was to include up to 20 million
pounds of pork bellies, the part of the hog from which bacon is
made.
   Yugoslavia's purchase of 150,000 pounds of bellies in late
October helped the rally along, as did indications that the Soviet
Union was interested in buying U.S. bellies.
   ``All of a sudden it seemed like we were going to be sending
bellies all over the world,'' said Thomas Morgan, president of
Sterling Research Corp. in Arlington Heights, Ill. ``But if you get
the price up high enough, everyone backs away.''
   The government has purchased a paltry 1.2 million pounds of
bellies so far and a Merc report on Tuesday showed bellies piling
up in commercial freezers at a rapid pace _ an indication of slack
demand for bacon.
   Analysts said the sell-off was inevitable after so strong a
rally. The market had recorded two consecutive days of limit gains
on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1.
   ``When something goes up the way this market did, it's going to
come down the same way,'' said Dale Durchholz, an analyst with
AgriVisor Services Inc. in Bloomington, Ill.
   Precious metals prices rebounded on New York's Commodity
Exchange, taking back some of the ground lost Wednesday.
   The gold market, which had fallen for the three previous
sessions, posted modest gains on buying by bargain hunters and
speculators whose interest was piqued by the weaker dollar and the
rise in oil prices.
   Gold futures settled $2.10 to $2.70 higher with December at
$411.60 a troy ounce; silver was 5.9 cents to 6.8 cents higher with
December at $5.668 a troy ounce.
   Surging demand for heating oil drove energy futures up sharply
on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 21 cents to 52 cents
higher with January at $19.89 a barrel; heating oil was .65 cent to
2.10 cents higher with the December contract expiring at 62.71 a
gallon; unleaded gasoline was .57 cent to 1.10 cents higher with
the expiring December contract at 50.29 cents a gallon.
   Corn and soybean futures prices ended mostly higher on the
Chicago Board of Trade amid indications the Soviet Union bought 2
million to 4 million metric tons of U.S. corn.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department announced sales of
1.4 million metric tons of corn and 150,000 metric tons of soybean
meal to the Soviets.
   Wheat futures settled 2 cents lower to 1} cents higher with
December at $4.07{ a bushel; corn futures were unchanged to 3{
cents higher with December at $2.38\ a bushel; oats were unchanged
to 1{ cents higher with December at $1.42} a bushel; soybeans were
3 cents to 4{ cents higher with January at $5.82} a bushel.

   The stock market rallied behind a strengthening
bond market Thursday, reflecting investor confidence that interest
rates are headed lower.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 17.49 points to
finish at 2,706.27. It was the highest closing since Oct. 12, the
day before the stock market plunged 190 points, when the blue-chip
indicator finished at 2,759.84.
   Advancing issues outpaced decliners by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
837 issues up, 629 down and 516 unchanged.
   While blue-chips issues were strong, however, the secondary
market continued to languish, traders said.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 153.20 million
shares, up from 147.27 million in the previous session.
   Wall Street analysts said the market rallied on renewed optimism
that interest rates are headed lower. Equities took their cue from
firming bond prices after new economic data pointed to a slowdown
in fourth-quarter economic growth.
   The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending fell 0.2
percent in October despite a 0.9 percent rise in personal incomes.
   Another report by the Purchasing Management Association showed a
decline in a Chicago-area economic index for November to 49.1
percent from 51.7 percent. Analysts said that set the tone for the
purchasing agents' nationwide survey due out on Friday.
   ``The bond market responded very well in expectation of the
purchasing agency figures which supposedly are lower than in recent
months,'' said Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst for MKI
Securities Corp.
   A slower economy would point to further credit easing by the
Federal Reserve despite its mixed signals in recent days.
   ``Anything that allows the Fed to ease is good news for the
stock market, which is bad economic news,'' said John D. Connolly,
chief equities analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Oil stocks added a firm tone to the market, while bank stocks
remained under pressure amid interest rate worries and concern
about leveraged buyout loans. New federal regulations require banks
to report loans for buyouts, acquisitions and recapitalizations.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 184.94 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $16.368 billion, or 0.49
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
closed up 1.05 at 191.30.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, BankAmerica fell 1\ to

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anheuser-Busch Inc. said Thursday that it is
increasing the availability of its non-alcoholic beer just in time
for the holiday season.
   ``There are many situations where a non-alcohol malt beverage
might be preferred, such as during business lunches or while
participating in athletic events,'' said Bob Merz, group brand
director for O'Doul's Non-Alcoholic Brew.
   ``And with the holidays just around the corner, it might also be
preferred when consumers know they will be driving,'' he said.
   O'Doul's has been test-marketed since March in cities in
Missouri, Florida, Alabama and Georgia. It will be made available
in December in all or part of 12 other states and the District of
Columbia, the company said.
   Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest brewery, is one of several
breweries that have recently introduced non-alcoholic beers.
   Milwaukee-based Miller Brewing Co., for instance, announced
plans in October to offer its Sharp's non-alcoholic brew for sale
nationwide by Jan. 1.
   David Krishock, new products category director for Miller, said
growth in the non-alcoholic beer market prompted Miller to bring
Sharp's out nationwide without test marketing.
   Annual U.S. production of non-alcoholic beers is about a million
barrels a year, compared with the national beer market of more than
182 million barrels. But the non-alcoholic segment is growing at
the rate of 10 percent to 15 percent a year while the overall beer
market has been stable, analysts said.
   The introduction of non-alcoholic beers is seen as a response to
a growing anti-drinking sentiment as well as to offset sluggish
beer sales with a wider variety of products.
   ``It has been our marketing philosophy to present the beer
consumer with a broad range of alternatives in terms of beer tastes
and beer types,'' said Michael J. Roarty, executive vice president
and director of marketing for Anheuser-Busch.
   Anheuser-Busch, the brewing arm of Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc.,
said O'Doul's would be available beginning Dec. 4 in Los Angeles,
San Francisco, San Diego and Sacramento, Calif.; Philadelphia;
Minneapolis; Phoenix; Hartford, Conn.; Washington D.C.; and St.
Louis.
   O'Doul's, sold in six-packs of 12-ounce cans and long-neck
bottles, also will be rolled out statewide in Delaware,
Massachusetts, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Oregon and
Washington.
   O'Doul's contains less than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume _
about the same amount found in soft drinks and fruit juices, the
company said.

investors and managers.
   Terms were not disclosed.
   The deal includes Uniroyal Goodrich plants in Hogansville, Ga.,

produce fabrics sold to makers of products such as conveyor belts
and tire hoses.
   Uniroyal Goodrich said it would continue to operate textile

Ontario. The plants supply Uniroyal Goodrich tire production
materials.
   Dominion Textile said the joint venture would acquire its
Canadian-based engineered fabrics division to create North
America's largest independent tire cord fabric maker.

   The Du Pont Co. said Thursday it plans
to spend at least $200 million to build a Spanish industrial plant
to manufacture space-age fibers and other products.
   Construction at a site in Asturias, Spain, is expected to begin
in mid-1990 for a plant to make aramid fiber, which is used in
aerospace and protective clothing, among other things.
   Du Pont spokesman Clint Archer said it was too early to say when
the plant would open or how many people it would employ.
   The company may invest more money later to enable the plant to
manufacture other fibers, polymer and chemical products, Archer
said.
   ``The markets for the products will be the big determining
factor'' in whether Du Pont expands the operation, he said.
   Asturias, located in northwest Spain, has a good transportation
network, a strong industrial base and a well-qualified labor force,
the company said.
   Du Pont, which has had operations in Spain since 1962, employs
20,000 people in 14 European countries.

   The French and West German governments have

helicopter called the Tiger, the French arms procurement agency
said Thursday.
   The contract is worth about $1.2 billion and covers development
of the helicopter and construction of five prototypes over the next
10 years.
   The helicopter is to be built by the Eurocopter consortium
jointly owned by France's Aerospatiale and
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Bloehm of West Germany.
   The contract does not cover the turbines for the new helicopter,
which are being designed by a separate consortium consisting of MTU
of West Germany, Turbomeca of France and Rolls-Royce of Britain.
   The first prototype is expected to make its maiden flight in
April 1991. First deliveries of production machines are expected in
1997.
   France and West Germany have ordered more than 400 Tigers, which
was formerly known as the HAP-HAC program.
   The French and West German governments have indicated they would
welcome other partners into the program, especially Westland of
Britain.

<TEXT>
   In an effort to reduce costs,
communications giant US West Inc. is offering special incentives to
about 20,000 managers to retire by next Feb. 28, company officials
announced Thursday.
   President Dick McCormick said he couldn't predict how many
managers might respond to the offer, but said about one-third of
eligible employees have accepted at other companies offering
similar programs.
   The program will enable 14,000 managers to qualify for pensions
five years sooner than under previous guidelines and add five years
of service for pension calculation purposes.
   Another 6,000 managers are eligible for immediate pensions
without the service-added provision because they already are at
least 45 years old and have 20 years of service.
   McCormick said retiring managers may choose a lump sum payment
in lieu of a service pension, and placement assistance and other
incentives also are being provided.

<HEAD>Judge Sets Limits on Eastern Strikers in New York, Atlanta</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking Eastern Airlines Machinists must restrict
the size and location of some picket lines and are prohibited from
confronting the carrier's working employees and customers, a judge
ordered Thursday.
   A preliminary injunction issued by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton
R. Lifland in New York notes that violators of the order could be
fined or jailed for contempt.
   The injunction covers Hartsfield International Airport in
Atlanta and New York's LaGuardia Airport and stems from hearings
conducted by Lifland in New York from March 22 to Oct. 4.
   ``We consider this a very significant order,'' said Eastern
spokesman Robin Matell. ``It puts the strikers on notice that
threatening behavior will not be tolerated and they will have to
pay the price for their actions.''
   Matell said the two airports have been the sites of most
problems between Eastern workers and Machinists since the strike
began March 4. Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization five days later.
   On Sunday, seven strikers were arrested in Atlanta after pickets
pelted cars with rocks and injured one Eastern worker. Lifland on
Wednesday ordered 13 Machinists to appear at a Dec. 12 hearing on
possible civil contempt charges.
   The injunction prohibits the pickets from blocking entrances or
harassing Eastern employees or passengers. They are also banned
from trespassing on any Eastern property at the two airports and
from making loud noises.
   In addition, strikers are blocked from vandalizing or defacing
any property of Eastern or its customers, including placing
stickers criticizing Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo. Texas
Air is the parent of Miami-based Eastern.
   The strikers can have no more than two people conducting
strike-related activities inside the terminals at the airports.
   At Hartsfield, the strikers are prohibited from mass
demonstrations at some terminal exits and entrances. The strikers'
tent city compound must be far enough from Eastern property so
objects cannot be thrown at buildings, according to the order.
   At LaGuardia, the order limits the size of the picket line to 12
people at arrival and departure areas. Also, the lines must be at
least 40 feet from the terminal entrance and 20 feet from the
baggage claim exit area.
   ``We haven't done anything improper,'' said Machinist spokesman
Al Hanson in Miami. ``The Atlanta incident was prompted by someone
who charged the picket line ... They are doing everything in their
power to cripple the union and keep us from our First Amendment
rights of free speech and assembly.''
   Lifland also ordered that a condensed version of the injunction
be mailed to each of the more than 8,000 Machinists, which include
aircraft mechanics, bag handlers and other ground workers.
   Contract talks are presently ongoing between Eastern and its
pilots and flight attendants unions, which decided to end their
8{-month sympathy strikes last week.

   Prices farmers got for raw products rose 1.4
percent in November over the month before, chiefly because of
increased prices for strawberries, milk, eggs and celery, the
Agriculture Department reported Thursday.
   The increases were partially offset by lower prices for hogs,
grapefruit, apples and lemons, the department said.
   The prices were 2.1 percent higher than last year at this time.
   That increase came from higher prices for milk, hogs, cattle and
eggs, partially offset by lower prices for soybeans, corn and
broilers over the year, said the report.
   Feed grain prices, except oats, increased slightly from October.
Wheat, rice and soybeans also showed small gains.
   Hog prices decreased from October, steers and heifers were up,
but prices for cows and calves were down.
   Looking just at crops, the increase in November was .8 percent
over the month before, but 5.1 percent below a year ago.
   Here's what happened:
   _Potatoes averaged $6.14 per hundred pounds, up 84 cents from
October.
   _Dry bean prices advanced $1.60 to $27.60 per hundred pounds.
   _Commercial vegetable prices were 1.4 percent higher due mainly
to the near doubling of celery prices caused by a late harvest and
celery shortage.
   _Onions, carrots and lettuce prices were lower than in October.
   _Oil bearing crop prices were 1.1 higher than in October, but 21
percent below a year ago. Soybeans were $5.62 per bushel, up 7
cents from October. Peanuts declined 1.2 cents to 25.5 cents per
pound. Cottonseed was at $111 a ton, an increase of $17 from
October.
   Livestock and poultry was up .6 percent from October and 7.9
percent above November a year ago.
   ``Compared with October, higher prices for milk, eggs, cattle
and turkeys more than offset lower prices for hogs, broilers and
calves,'' said the report.
   Here are the details:
   _Milk sold to plants and dealers averaged $15.20 per hundred
pounds in November, up 50 cents from the month before and $1.88
from the year before.
   _Turkey prices increased 2.4 cents per pound over October to
40.9 cents.
   _Broiler prices averaged 29.8 cents per pound down .8 cents from
October.
   _Market egg prices averaged 72.8 cents per dozen for November,
an increase of 8.6 cents from October.
   _Barrow and gilt prices decreased $2.30 per hundred pounds from
October to $45 while sows decreased $3.60 per hundred pounds.
   _Beef cattle prices in November averaged $69.40 per hundred
pounds up 70 cents from October, while calf prices decreased 80
cents to $87.30 per hundred pounds.
   _Calf prices decreased 80 cents to $87.30 per hundred pounds.

   A jury found Amtrak guilty Thursday of
dumping raw sewage into Florida waterways in the national rail
passenger line's first such criminal trial.
   The state filed charges after Amtrak refused to stop dumping raw
human wastes from moving trains onto the tracks and into the St.
Johns River and Rice Creek.
   The six-member jury deliberated 1{ hours Thursday before
returning a guilty verdict on four counts of commercial littering.
   Amtrak contended federal law exempts it from state pollution
control laws. The dumping practice, dating back more than a
century, has also come under fire in several Western states.
   ``I'm surprised and disappointed in the verdict,'' said Amtrak's
attorney, Edward Booth of Jacksonville. ``I think it's unfair for
the law to send mixed signals.''
   Booth said Amtrak would appeal the decision ``just as quick as
you're looking at daylight.''
   Amtrak also faced one count of creating or allowing a nuisance
to health, but 7th Circuit Judge Robert Perry remanded it to Putnam
County Court, saying that prosecutors failed to prove anyone's
health was endangered. A trial on that count will be set later.
   Amtrak has 20 days to file a motion for a new trial on the
littering convictions. Sentencing was set for Jan. 19. Amtrak could
be prohibited from dumping and fined up to $5,000 on each count.
The charges also carry a possible prison term of five years on each
count, though no individual was named in the case.
   ``We are asking for injunction immediately (to stop Amtrak from
dumping),'' said State Attorney John Tanner. ``But it's obvious
that the judge is not going to act until the sentencing date.''
   The federally supported passenger railroad had threatened to
suspend service to Florida, where it serves about 1 million
passengers a year, if the state continued pressing its case.
   However, Jeff Moon, assistant general counsel for Amtrak, said
following the verdict that no decision has been made to pull the
rail service out of Florida.
   Tanner earlier had indicated if a guilty verdict were returned:
``I don't think it will immediately affect rail service in Florida.
I think in the long run it will ultimately lead to the end of the
practice of dumping sewage in the waterways throughout the
country.''
   Many of Amtrak's 600 passenger cars dispose of sewage either by
dumping directly onto the tracks when toilets are flushed or by
spraying the contents of 30-gallon holding tanks when the trains
are traveling at least 35 miles per hour.
   In his closing argument, Booth admitted Amtrak had dumped human
waste on bridges crossing waterways in Putnam County, but said the
practice was allowed under federal law.
   The company said in a federal court motion in Jacksonville that
enforcement of the state law would impose undue burdens on Amtrak,
but no hearings were held on the motion and Perry refused to delay
trial pending a federal ruling.
   The defense called Amtrak's president and chief executive
officer, W. Graham Claytor Jr., as their only witness during the
week-long trial. Claytor said Amtrak recognized the dumping
problem, but that the federally funded rail line could do little
until Congress appropriated more money for holding tanks or new
cars.
   Claytor estimated it would take about $1 million to equip the
current cars with the new system or $2 million to install it in new
cars.
   The prosecution said Amtrak could not hide behind the law passed
by Congress in 1976 and ignore environmental laws in Florida.
   ``Congress needs to know the state of Florida will not allow
Amtrak _ the federal government _ to dump raw sewage in the waters
of Florida,'' Tanner said. ``They (Amtrak) are trying to stretch
the law to say something it doesn't.''
