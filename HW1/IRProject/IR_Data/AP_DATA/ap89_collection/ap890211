<HEAD>Savings and Loans Had Record Withdrawals in December</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Savings and loan customers withdrew a record
$8.1 billion from their accounts in December, evidence, economists
say, that the industry is being squeezed by higher interest rates.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates 2,955 federally
insured savings and loans, said Friday that December marked the
eighth consecutive month of net withdrawals, reversing the tide of
deposits that poured into S&amp;Ls following the 1987 stock market crash.
   Meanwhile, in other developments:
   _Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman, in
an interview, confirmed published reports that the Federal Reserve
Board put together a contingency plan last weekend in the event that
the announcement of President Bush's proposal for the savings and
loan crisis triggered depositor runs.
   _The FDIC said it has taken control of six more savings
institutions, bringing to 10 the number of S&amp;Ls brought under the
agency's jurisdiction since Bush gave it that responsibility on
Monday.
   The December withdrawals, topping the one-month record of $7.0
billion set in November, occurred at a time of mounting publicity
about S&amp;L problems. Regulators closed or merged 75 institutions that
month.
   But Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria,
Va., attributed the development to interest rate movements rather
than to nervousness by S&amp;L customers.
   He said customers are turning to money market mutual funds and
other investments because S&amp;Ls are resisting pushing up interest
rates as fast. However, he predicted S&amp;L deposit rates likely would
be forced higher as the Federal Reserve Board tightens credit in an
effort to dampen inflation.
   ``Boy, that's hard on the bottom line,'' he said. ``This does not
bode well for thrift earnings.''
   Indeed, one member of the Federal Reserve Board, Martha Seger,
dissented from a policy-making board's decision in December to push
interest rates higher on the grounds that could aggravate S&amp;Ls'
problems.
   Her opposition to higher rates was revealed in minutes released
Friday of the Dec. 13-14 meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee.
   However, economist Martin Regalia of the National Council of
Savings Institutions said the president's effort this week appears
to have bolstered confidence in savings institutions.
   ``If you look at the stock market, they look at this whole
process as being a net plus,'' he said. ``Thrift stocks have risen
in the last few days because I guess they feel the problem is being
addressed.''
   James Barth, chief economist of the bank board, attributed a
large share of the December deposit flow to a single, healthy
institution which shrank its deposit base by $3.4 billion as part of
a deliberate strategy of substituting lower cost borrowing. He also
noted that money normally flows out of savings accounts in December
as people spend to celebrate the holidays.
   Seidman, in an interview Friday, said administration officials
who he declined to name were predicting depositor runs when Bush
announced his S&amp;L plan and that the president insisted the Federal
Reserve have an emergency plan in place.
   ``I was on the other side (of the argument) but I was just as
eager as anybody to have a plan in place in case I happened to be
wrong,'' he said.
   The FDIC, which insures bank deposits, will take control of more
than 200 insolvent S&amp;Ls in the next four to six weeks under a
cooperation agreement with the agency insuring thrift deposits, the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
   The six institutions taken over Friday by the FDIC are: First
Federal of Arkansas and Savers Federal Savings and Loan Association,
both of Little Rock, Ark.; Sandia Federal Savings and Loan
Association, Albuquerque, N.M.; Bright Banc, Dallas; University
Savings Association, Houston; and Deseret Federal Savings and Loan
Association, Salt Lake City.

<HEAD>Whirwind Trip to Highlight Defense and Trade Issues</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top prospects uncertain.</HEAD>

   Hoping he has put questions about his private bank
holdings behind him, Secretary of State James A. Baker III set out
today on a week-long trip to the capitals of the 14 U.S. allies in
Western Europe likely to be dominated by defense and trade issues.
   For Baker, whose foreign policy experience is slight, the trip
beginning in Iceland and winding up next Friday in France is a
learning experience and a warmup for a probable NATO summit meeting
in the spring.
   ``It is a listening trip and it is a consulting trip,'' Baker
said Friday at a news conference here. ``But I am carrying a
message. We want to make it clear the way to approach the East-West
relationship is with prudence and with realism. We want you to know
we are not dragging our feet, seeking delay for the sake of delay.''
   Baker said he would solicit the views of the allied governments
on how to negotiate strategic nuclear weapons reductions with the
Soviet Union and what to do about modernizing NATO 's battlefield
weapons.
   Baker hopes, meanwhile, he has put to rest a potentially ticklish
problem over his holdings in Chemical New York Corp. by saying he
would ``tend to be guided'' by whatever conclusions are reached by
government ethics lawyers.
   The holding company has $4.5 billion in loans to Third World
nations, and Baker as secretary of state will be called on to play a
leading role in addressing the economic problems of developing
countries.
   Baker said he would ask for a presidential waiver allowing him to
participate in such decisions. But Baker said he would also consider
other options, such as selling his stock or changing the terms of
the blind trust in which all his holdings have been placed in order
to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest.
   ``I have concluded I should seek a waiver because that gives me
additional protection and helps avoid any appearance of
impropriety,'' Baker said in Ottawa, where he stopped with President
Bush for five hours of talks with Canadian leaders.
   Baker said C. Boyden Gray, Bush's top adviser on ethics, and
other government lawyers were trying to find ``a mechanism or
actions that would be taken in my case to insulate me from charges
or appearances of a conflict of interest.''
   Baker said he had not talked to Gray, and that the President's
ethics adviser had not asked him to sell the bank stock. But Baker
said Gray had raised selling as an option in talking to Robert
Kimmit, a Washington lawyer who was named Under Secretary of State
for Political Affairs.
   ``I have been very careful about recusing myself from specific
issues that might constitute a conflict of an appearance of
conflict,'' Baker said, referring to his jobs as White House chief
of staff and then Treasury Secretary in the Reagan administration.
   However, he said government attorneys also told him he could
participate in ``general policy determinations'' without violating
ethical standards.
   Bush and Baker are in the midst of a review of U.S. foreign
policy. Negotiations with the Soviets to reduce long-range missiles
are on hold, and the administration also faces a decision on whether
to ease restrictions on technology sales to the Soviets.
   At the same time, Baker will try on the trip to promote increased
defense spending by the allies even while the Bush administration
tries to keep its own outlays in check.
   Baker, who began his NATO discussions Friday night with Foreign
Minister Joe Clark of Canada, is also under pressure from the allies
to ease restrictions on trade with the Soviets.
   Automatic curbs on technology that could have a military use were
imposed by the Carter administration to punish the Soviets for the
1979 invasion of Afghanistan. The Soviet troops are leaving, with
the last soldier due out by next Wednesday.
   Baker said he had not made up his mind, despite reports that he
had decided to lift the automatic curbs. But he stressed that if the
curbs are eased ``this does not mean we are opening the doors to
technology transfers.''

   With two years remaining in World War II, Dmitri
Shostakovich composed his harrowing Eighth Symphony, a reflection on
the destruction of war.
   Sir Georg Solti brought all the flash he is know for to the
hour-long piece Friday night as he led the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra at Carnegie Hall.
   Sir Georg surely has never met a cresecendo he didn't like, which
suits this Shostakovich perfectly. As the strings and the woodwinds
fade in the desolation of the score's final pages, the previous
thunder of brass and percussion has left the audience yearning for
peacefulness.
   ``In this work, there was an attempt to express the emotional
experience of the people,'' Shostakovich wrote, ``to reflect the
terrible tragedy of war.''
   To convey that experience, Shostakovich uses all the orchestral
artillery he can muster. After 15 minutes of buildup, begun darkly
by the cellos and basses, the percussion lets loose like a marching
band, sounding the drumbeat of the war that surrounded Shostakovich.
   And what orchestra better to capture that sound than the
Chicagoans? More than any other orchestra, it has managed to
maintain a distinctive sound in the age of plane-hopping music
directors. It's tone is bold and brash, powered by perhaps the best
brass section in the world.
   Sir Georg, celebrating his 20th season as music director and his
75th birthday, still leaps about the podium with the energy of a
teenager, whipping his troops to let loose. Even when the score
briefly turns towards peasant dance music at the beginning of the
fifth and final movement, Sir Georg reaches for the big sound.
   Earlier, with a much-reduced orchestra, Sir Georg led a warm
rendition of Schubert's Fifth Symphony. Schubert wrote it during a
month-long stretch in 1816, when he was 19, and although it does not
come close to the quality of his Eighth and Ninth Symphonies, it has
an almost Mozartian softness.
   The Chicagoans had a chance to show off their violins, especially
during the three allegros. Sir Georg, in contrast to his
``Falstaff'' four years ago, let the sis-boom-bah rest in a piece
that didn't need it.

   A blocked heater pipe spread deadly fumes through
a house, killing four young men and leaving a woman in critical
condition, authorities said Friday.
   The deadly fumes ``might be either gas or carbon monoxide, but
we're leaning toward carbon monoxide,'' Fire Department spokesman
Scott La Greca said.
   ``It appears that they have been dead for some time, in terms of
hours or days, I don't know,'' La Greca said. ``Somehow, the woman
was able to survive.''
   A flue pipe inside the living room heater and a separate pipe
connecting the heater to an outside wall were blocked, causing the
fumes to seep into the room, said Peoples Gas Co. spokesman Ed Joyce.
   The four men were pronounced dead on arrival at Holy Cross
Hospital, said supervisor Joyce Kopecky. She identified two of the
victims as brothers Joel Blazek, 17, and Kenneth Blazek, 21.
   Another victim, Larry Price, 27, and Carol Prykop, 18, who was in
critical condition at University of Chicago Hospital, did not live
at the house but were neighbors. The fourth victim, a 36-year-old
man, was not immediately identified.
   Four people were found in the living room and one person in a
bedroom, authorities said.
   Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, extremely poisonous
gas. Because it has no odor or color, persons breathing it usually
fall asleep without realizing they are being poisoned. It results
when fuels containing carbon like coal or oil burn in stoves or
furnaces that contain insufficient oxygen.
   La Greca said authorities determined there was no need to
evacuate nearby buildings after gas company workers shut off the
supply of gas to the building.

   The Giant Mountains National Park,
Czechoslovakia's largest, has become so heavily polluted that half
its trees are severely damaged, the Communist Party daily Rude Pravo
reported.
   It said Friday that the 80,000-acre park, a popular skiing resort
80 miles north of Prague, has been damaged by pollution from
chemical plants and power stations using low-grade coal.
   ``Over 5O percent of pollution comes from the equipment of our
neighbors,'' Rude Pravo quoted Vladimir Korinek of the Forests and
Water Ministry as saying. He apparently was referring to factories
in nearby Poland and East Germany.
   The paper quoted Korinek as saying the fate of two ski-jumping
hills in Harrachov, a prime venue for international competitions,
would likely be affected by ecological disaster _ ``There are no
trees left and there is simply too much wind, which makes
ski-jumping dangerous.''

   Robert Hunt scorched some kitchen tiles and told
his wife they fell off the ill-fated Challenger space shuttle.
   That, police say, was just one prop in Hunt's pose as an
astronaut during a period of make-believe that carried him through
several states, speaking engagements and marriages.
   Now his wife is leaving him and he faces fraud and larceny
charges for taking his make-believe too far.
   State police arrested Hunt on Jan. 28 in suburban Medford. The
27-year-old plumber's son from Everett is accused of swindling his
fourth wife and bride of five months, Ann Sweeney, of up to $50,000
on her company-issued credit card without her knowledge and for
taking $4,000 from a Saugus family on the promise he could get their
18-year-old son out of the Navy.
   On Jan. 6, calling himself Marine Capt. Robert J. Hunt, the fake
astronaut spoke before a group called the Experimental Aircraft
Association.
   ``He was a very good speaker, he entertained us. He held us
spellbound for 2{ hours,'' said Greater Boston chapter president,
Lou Pascucci.
   Sweeney, 23, a former optical engineer, also believed he was an
astronaut.
   ``I love the person I thought I was married to,'' she said.
   Recalling the day he was unmasked, Sweeney said, ``I was shocked.
It was almost like watching someone die. He just dissolved,
disappeared.''
   Hunt is being held on $100,000 bail in a Boston jail. His case in
East Boston District Court was continued to Feb. 15 after a request
for reduced bail was denied. Hunt's attorney, James Cipoletta, could
not be reached Friday, but he has said he urged his client not to
speak to the news media.
   Investigators compiling the story of Hunt's alleged stories say
that for the past eight years he has been fooling many people in
imaginative ways _ in Massachusetts, Florida, Pennsylvania and
Ireland.
   Montour, Pa., Township Police Chief Robert Lighow said Hunt
allegedly rode around Pennsylvania in a limousine seeking models for
his baby powder while pretending to be a powder maker. He said
Friday that he was investigating charges that Hunt swindled his
third wife, a local woman, out of large amounts of money. He would
not elaborate. Authorities say Hunt is believed to have been married
to two other women.
   Harry Doan, the owner of an air service in Daytona Beach, Fla.,
was convinced by Hunt that he was a Navy helicopter pilot.
   Last summer, Hunt chartered a jet to fly with his wife to
Montreal, allegedly charging it on his wife's credit card while
telling her the flight cost nothing because he was a space shuttle
pilot.
   In Ireland Oct. 8, he was granted a 10-minute interview with
Benjamin Briscoe, lord mayor of Dublin. Briscoe's spokeswoman said
the meeting at Mansion House, the official residence, was arranged
after Briscoe was told Hunt was a visiting astronaut.
   The spokewoman said when Hunt told the lord mayor that British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was arranging for him to be married
at Westminster Abbey, Briscoe realized Hunt was ``not the full
shilling,'' but politely said nothing. Others were completely taken
in.
   During Hunt's arrest, police searched the apartment and found
assorted military paraphernalia, flight jumpsuits and a helmet
bearing the insignia of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   Dr. Park Dietz, a forensic psychiatrist who is an FBI consultant
and a professor at the University of Virginia, said there are cases
in legal circles falling under the category of the so-called
imposter phenomenon.
   ``It's generally believed that people who are able to dupe others
into believing that they have some professional status that's
untrue, most likely suffer from antisocial personality disorder,''
said Dietz, who is on sabbatical in Newport Beach, Calif.
   He said a recent National Institute of Mental Health survey found
about 5 percent of adult urba men and nearly 1 percent of adult
urban women suffer from the disorder.
   Dietz said the ailment can be hereditary and that ``people who
(practice) such deceptions tend not to have the same depth of
emotions, of empathy and warmth, despite their charm.''
   Why are so many duped?
   ``It takes energy, thought, mental work to be skeptical about the
myriad claims to legitimacy we come upon every day,'' he said.
``It's easier to take people at their word, particularly when it
conveys some status by associating with them.''

<HEAD>Experts Disagree on Whether Tax Plan Would Help Oil Output</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's proposed tax breaks for oil
drillers are winning an expected round of applause from the oil
industry, but officials and analysts disagree over whether the
measures will stem the decline in U.S. oil production.
   ``I don't think we're going to get that much more oil out of the
United States even if these tax incentives were passed,'' said Ed
Rothschild, assistant director of the Citizen-Labor Energy
Coalition, an advocacy group that favors greater use of renewable
energy sources as an alternative to fossil fuels.
   ``It's more of a political gesture to the industry'' than a plan
for revitalizing domestic oil production, Rothschild said in an
interview Friday.
   Industry officials said the proposed tax incentives, worth at
least $350 million a year, would, if enacted, result in a measurable
gain in oil and gas production.
   ``This is a very healthy step forward,'' said Jim Groninger,
Washington director of governmental affairs for the Independent
Petroleum Association of America. ``Tax incentives are an important
component of a national energy policy.''
   The tax breaks unveiled by Bush in his budget address Thursday to
Congress were coupled with a postponement of lease sales for oil
drilling off the California and Florida coasts _ areas the oil
companies consider prime drilling prospects.
   Bush said he was seeking to balance environmental needs with a
desire to revitalize the depressed oil and gas industry, which he
called vital to U.S. national security.
   The American Petroleum Institute, representing the nation's major
oil companies, welcomed the Bush tax incentives but said more steps
would be needed, including opening up more federal lands and
offshore areas to oil exploration.
   ``The tax incentives ... are a step in the right direction, but
they alone cannot stem the serious decline in domestic petroleum
production,'' said Charles J. DiBona, president of the petroleum
institute.
   U.S. oil production has fallen by more than 1 million barrels a
day over the past three years, and last December the oil production
rate was the lowest in nearly a quarter of a century. At the same
time, oil demand has increased in recent years, leading to a
reliance on imports that Bush says poses security risks.
   Bush rejected the idea of imposing a tariff on imported oil but
proposed four tax incentives aimed at boosting exploratory drilling,
particularly by smaller operators. The tax breaks would be phased
out if the price of oil, currently about $17 a barrel, rose above
$21.
   The tax package includes:
   _A 10 percent credit on the first $10 million of spending, per
company per year, on intangible drilling costs, those not directly
associated with drilling a well, such as hauling equipment.
   _A 10 percent credit for spending on all new tertiary enhanced
recovery projects, those that use steam, carbon dioxide or chemical
injectants to increase the production rate from oil and natural gas
fields.
   _Allow drillers to exclude a major part of their income from the
alternative minimum tax.
   _Change oil and natural gas depletion rules that the
administration says discourage the transfer of marginal wells from
major oil companies to independent producers and result in the
premature abandonment of producing wells.
   The administration said the tax package was aimed mainly at the
smaller producers, which traditionally have drilled the majority of
new wells in the United States.

<TEXT>
   Students trying to raise money usually
go in for bake sales or car washes, but kids at a high school here
have come up with a service that's a hit with their classmates _
computer dating.
   With Valentine's Day approaching, students have been lining up in
the halls of Ottawa Hills High School at lunch hour, ready to pay $1
for the names of three potential dates whose answers to 20 questions
most closely match theirs.
   ``The first two days we've had people piling around the table,
throwing money at us,'' student Jason Woods said recently.
   Computer student Jim Ruder said he spent two or three months
writing the software for the dating service, then distributed
questionnaires.
   ``We're not up to Dating Game standards, yet,'' Ruder said. ``We
haven't said it is the perfect date or anything like that.''
   So far, the students have raised about $200, which will go toward
computer lab equipment.
   Woods and Ruder have bigger ideas for their computer program.
They hope to copyright it and market it to other schools.

   The aroma of old leather mingled with the
smell of new money at the nation's largest book fair, where you
could pick up a 1632 edition of Shakespeare or ``The Philosophy of
Andy Warhol'' bound with $5 bills.
   ``I love to lose myself in other men's minds,'' wrote Charles
Lamb in an essay on books and reading, and he would have been
blissfully transported at the California International Antiquarian
Book Fair, which opened Friday.
   Organizers hoped a record 8,000 people would browse through the
centuries of writers' and bookbinders' art, not to mention buy.
   But the 188 booksellers from throughout the United States and
seven other countries anticipated winning new devotees as well as
making profits.
   ``Book fairs cultivate book collectors. They come here and see
things they've never seen before,'' said George Robert Kane, a
bookseller and chairman of this year's fair.
   ``They love literature or see the beauty of the illustrations.
... They get into it, and pretty soon, they're hooked,'' said Kane,
whose necktie was printed with rows of books.
   ``In most cases, it's a consuming disease _ a consuming passion,
that's better.''
   Future collectors might catch the bug while admiring a second
folio edition of Shakespeare's plays, offered for $60,000, a
painstakingly illuminated 15th century Flemmish manuscript Book of
Hours for $35,000 or a 1482 Venetian volume of Euclid priced at
$25,000.
   The most expensive item is a three-volume set of the first
edition of Moby Dick, published in England in 1851 and entitled The
Whale. It's price? A quick $75,000. But it's in first-class
condition and a gold-embossed whale adorns the spine of each volume.
   Collectors on a tighter budget could choose an autographed copy
of Oscar Wilde's ``An Ideal Husband'' bound in gold-stamped blue
morocco leather and costing $4,950.
   Even some 20th century authors command a handsome price. A first
edition of Ian Fleming's ``Casino Royale,'' for example, is offered
for $1,250.
   Despite fears that television and videos have produced a nation
of people who don't read, dealers said growing numbers of people are
becoming fascinated by _ and buying _ rare books.
   ``Business is better that it's ever been,'' said Jerry Weinstein,
manager of Heritage Book Shop Inc. in Los Angeles.
   Some collectors think of their purchases as investments that will
increase in value with the years. But even collectors with an eye
toward possible resale buy the old and rare volumnes primarily out
of love.
   ``The preponderance of them are buying not for investment but for
just having it as something beautiful, just like having a Picasso,''
Weinstein said.
   Having something rare and beautiful doesn't have to cost
thousands of dollars. Prices at the fair start at about $20, and
some first editions of well-known authors such as John Steinbeck and
F. Scott Fitzgerald can be had for about $100.
   ``If you fall in love with an illustrator or an author ... from
Elior Wylie to Shakespeare ... you'll search for the things you can
afford,'' said Kane, who gave up newspaper work to become a book
dealer in Santa Cruz 18 years ago.
   A part of the admission proceeds from the fair, which continues
through Sunday, goes to the San Francisco Public Library.

<HEAD>Air Force Says Environmental Impact Minimal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Air Force study concludes that deploying
huge MX nuclear missiles on railroad cars would neither interfere
with the operation of the nation's rail network nor harm the
environment significantly.
   The final Environmental Impact Statement, released Friday at the
Pentagon, turned up some problems at a few of the 11 Air Force bases
that are being considered as candidates for ``rail garrisons.''
   But the statement insists that ``while there is a very slight
potential for accidents with the deployment of the (MX) Rail
Garrison System, the system would be safe and would pose negligible
risk to human health and the environment.''
   Former President Reagan ordered the development of a rail-basing
plan for the 10-warhead MX _ a weapon he dubbed the Peacekeeper _ in
December 1986. His goal was to overcome congressional concerns about
the vulnerability of the missiles inside underground silos.
   President Bush is now facing a March 15 congressional deadline to
decide if he'll back Reagan's plan. If he does, and Congress agrees,
the Air Force plans to build 25 six-car trains with each carrying
two MX missiles. Each garrison could house up to four trains.
   Because of the small number of trains involved, the conclusion
Friday that the system would not interfere with commercial
operations had been expected. The Air Force also went out of its way
to note that training operations for crews would be conducted with
fake trains that wouldn't carry real MX missiles.
   In the event of a derailment or other accident, the chances of an
explosion or fire involving the missile's propellants are
``unlikely'' and for the nuclear warheads, virtually impossible, the
report says.
   ``U.S. nuclear weapons include safety features and control over
arming mechanisms that assure there is virtually no possibility of
an inadvertent nuclear detonation,'' the report states.
   The rail car launchers would remain inside fortified military
bases unless there was a threat of war, and only then would scramble
on the commercial rail network to avoid a Soviet first-strike
attack, the Air Force said.
   The heaviest environmental impact would stem from construction
activities at any bases selected to serve as garrisons for the MX
cars, the Air Force said. Those would consist primarily of increased
traffic congestion, the short-term degradation of air quality and in
a few instances, the relocation of inhabited buildings.
   Of the 11 Air Force bases reviewed, however, four would likely
suffer ``significant degradation of biological resources'' if rail
garrisons were built, the Air Force reported.
   Those four are Barksdale Air Force Base, La.; Fairchild Air Force
Base, Wash.; Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo.; and Wurtsmith Air Force
Base, Mich.
   Despite those findings, the impact statement offers no ranking of
the 11 bases, nor does it disqualify any base from consideration.
   It repeats a decision made two years ago that F.E. Warren Air
Force Base, Wyo., will be the headquarters and first home for any MX
trains. But it noted that rail deployment has not been approved by
Congress and that it is premature to select other bases.
   The other bases considered candidates are Eaker Air Force Base
and Little Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas; Dyess Air Force Base,
Texas; Grand Forks Air Force Base and Minot Air Force Base in North
Dakota; and Malstrom Air Force Base, Mont.

<HEAD>Study Says Trade-Zone Program Hurts US Parts Makers</HEAD>

   A congressional study concludes that a
foreign-trade zone program intended to encourage U.S. exports
instead is helping foreign auto parts manufacturers by giving
millions of dollars in tariff breaks.
   ``Although originally created in order to encourage
export-oriented trade, in its current form the program provides
greater benefits to firms who import more parts,'' the General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said in a
report issued Friday.
   The report was immediately praised by the Automotive Parts and
Accessories Association.
   The GAO's findings ``underscore our industry's conviction that
the ... program is broken and needs fixing,'' said the trade
association's president, Julian Morris, from its Lanham, Md.,
headquarters.
   The report recommended that Congress amend the 1934 foreign-trade
zone law to provide guidance on what public benefits are needed to
justify such zones or subzones. Factors to be considered would be
exports, imports, employment and investment.
   Foreign trade zones were originally created to encourage the
export of U.S. goods that contain foreign parts. The program,
however, has ``become a major base'' for manufacturers serving
domestic markets, the report said.
   The GAO report, requested in 1987 by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill. and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, estimated
the foreign-trade zones and their subzones in 1986 reduced tariffs
on auto parts by $38 million.
   The value of parts flowing through the subzones has risen
explosively, from $200 million in 1978 to $5 billion in 1986, the
report said.
   Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich. a member of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said the discrepancy between tariffs on parts and on
finished vehicles created an obvious ``private benefit'' for
automakers under the program.
   Imported auto parts are subject to tariffs ranging from 4 percent
to 11 percent. Finished vehicles are assessed at a 2.5 percent
tariff rate.
   When vehicles built in foreign-trade zones are sold in the United
States, the imported parts are taxed at the lower 2.5 percent rate,
Levin said.
   Automakers using the foreign-trade zone program run the spectrum
from the Michigan-based domestic giants _ General Motors Corp., Ford
Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. _ to foreign makers like Nissan, Toyota
and Mazda that have established assembly plants in the United States.
   Most auto assembly plants in the United States come under the
program, the GAO said.
   Although the Foreign Trade Zone Board, which administers the
program, uses public benefit as its criterion for judging requests,
that standard has not been officially adopted and applications have
seldom been denied, the report said.
   The report recommended the public benefit standard be made part
of the law.

   BIELSKO-BIALA, Poland (AP) _ Lech Walesa is a man gingerly
dividing his time between two types of working clothes these days: a
blue suit for his talks with the government and a jacket and jeans
for his union supporters.
   He has been meeting with both this week, a delicate balancing act
aimed at winning concessions from the government and while keeping
the support of the increasingly fractious Solidarity independent
labor movement.
   Since the Monday opening of the talks, known as the round table,
Walesa has met with thousands of Solidarity supporters in three
cities to explain why he agreed to negotiate with the same
government that banned their union.
   The Nobel Peace Prize winner visited Warsaw on Tuesday, Krakow on
Thursday and this industrial town on Friday.
   Not since the heady days of Solidarity's legal existence in
1980-81 has Walesa been able to so freely travel the country and
openly meet with the union rank-and-file.
   More than 400 workers cheered when Walesa strode into a hall in
Bielsko-Biala, an industrial center, for the first open meeting of
the banned union here in seven years.
   But they voiced worry about the outcome of the talks first
proposed by the government during a wave of strikes in August,
Poland's worst labor unrest since the martial law crackdown of
December 1981.
   ``People have doubts. ... They don't know what these talks are
going to bring,'' said Miroslaw Styczen, a veteran solidarity
activist in Bielsko-Biala.
   ``Most people are really happy about the talks. But there's not
complete unity,'' he said.
   A textile town in the Beskidy Mountains 180 miles south of
Warsaw, Bielsko-Biala was one of the strongest Solidarity regions
during the union's 16-month legal existence.
   The Solidarity leader launched into a speech he has consistently
delivered all week. He told the workers he didn't really trust the
government, but that ``Poland badly needs agreement.''
   His listeners fired back questions.
   ``How will you get people to join the new unions?'' asked one
young worker.
   ``Today everybody who wants to will soon be able to organize a
group,'' Walesa replied.
   ``How is Solidarity going to be organized?'' asked another worker.
   Walesa had no concrete answer, but he assured them that
authorities have made a political decision and that the union would
exist again soon.
   He pleaded for time and urged workers to be patient and not to
strike.
   ``We all have a moral right and arguments to strike. ... Give me
a chance at the round table,'' he said.
   ``If it is too little, we will fight,'' he said.
   Earlier in the day, Walesa did don his dark blue suit for talks
with Cardinal Franciszek Macharski in Krakow and a later meeting
with faculty and students at the 14th century Jagiellonian
University.
   Walesa asked the students and professors to excuse him for any
grammatical errors he might make, saying he was just a worker.
   About 2,000 students crowded the halls near loudspeakers outside
the small, ornate room where Walesa addressed about 200 invited
guests.
   One visitor was not allowed in _ a reporter from the Communist
Party newspaper, Trybuna Ludu.
   ``Believe in yourselves and build structures that can bring
Poland into Europe and the world,'' Walesa told the audience.
   Students were dismayed that they had been given only 25 seats in
the room, and some seemed skeptical about the round table.
   ``People are still trying to learn what the round table is about.
It's too early to tell,'' said Piotr Hertig, a spokesman of the
illegal independent students' association.
   ``Walesa's speech lacked concrete propositions. People aren't
sure how to organize or what to do,'' said another student.
   ``As soon as there will be agreement, we will be able to work,''
Walesa said. He did not say how long he expected it would take.
   The trip was grueling, but Walesa says he must make contact with
people to grasp the situation, to reacquaint himself with movement
veterans and to meet the new generation of activists. He plans
another trip across Poland next week.
   Traveling by car, Walesa appeared tired and impatient when he
arrived in Krakow late Thursday.
   More than 3,000 people jammed the Mistrzejowice Church near the
Nowa Huta steel mill to hear Walesa speak.
   ``Lech, welcome, Solidarity is not underground and was not
destroyed,'' said Stefan Jurczak of the Solidarity region Malopolska.

<HEAD>World Jewish Leaders to Open First Soviet Jewish Center in 50 Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel and dozens of other
world Jewish leaders are coming to Moscow to help open the first
cultural center for Soviet Jews in more than 50 years.
   While one of the leaders hailed Sunday's opening of the center as
a sign of the improving fortunes of the country's 1.8 million Jews
under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, he said it's too soon to
declare an end to the problems of Jews in the Soviet Union.
   ``Glasnost has taken hold here. The question will be, can it
continue?'' said Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal
Center in Los Angeles.
   Hier, World Jewish Congress President Edgar Bronfman, and Wiesel
_ a survivor of the Holocaust and 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner _
are to speak at Sunday's opening of the Solomon Mikhoels Cultural
Center. About 70 Jewish leaders from Israel, Britain, France,
Australia, Canada, the United States and other countries plan to
attend.
   The opening comes a few days after a Soviet newspaper made a
major admission: that Soviet Jews have suffered discrimination for
decades and that dictator Josef Stalin destroyed Jewish culture in
the country.
   Mikhoels, a Jewish actor for whom the center was named, was among
the thousands of Jews who fell victim to Stalin's terror. He was
killed in 1948 in what was officially termed a traffic accident but
what many Jews believe was an assassination ordered by Stalin.
   The center is located in the Moscow Jewish Musical Theater on
Taganka Square in the southeastern section of the capital.
   Its director, Mikhail Gluz, told the official news agency Tass on
Friday that Yiddish and Hebrew classes are planned, itself a major
change. The teaching of Hebrew was once punished as a crime, and
several Jewish activists were jailed for religious instruction.
   Soviet laws bar the private teaching of religious subjects to
anyone under 18, but authorities have indicated a new law on
religion being drafted will ease those and other restrictions.
   Hier said in an interview that Soviet promises to allow the
teaching of Hebrew as well as membership by Soviet Jews in
international Jewish organizations ``have been couched in very
diplomatic terms.''
   ``We have no commitment yet,'' he said.
   In a report previewing Sunday's opening, Tass said: ``The
perestroika, or restructuring drive, has altered the life of Soviet
society and prompted the development of Jewish cultural
associations.''
   But Hier said plans for the center to have a public library,
Jewish museum and art gallery could be ruined if Soviet authorities
interfere.
   ``It is not the time to be euphoric, but to make sure the center
will be free to develop cultural and educational programs. If that
is what the center becomes, it will be a great and epic event,''
Hier said.
   If authorities step in, he said, ``we will be back where we
started from.''
   The Simon Wiesenthal Center has donated to the center an exhibit
and Russian-language books about the Nazi campaign against the Jews,
and has shown in Moscow a film that accuses the Soviet Union of
kidnapping Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who saved thousands
of Jews during World War II and later disappeared.
   As part of his effort to improve relations with the West,
Gorbachev has taken several steps to address complaints that his
country violates human rights.
   For Jews, the changes have meant a rise in emigration _ 1988
marked an eight-year high with about 20,000 leaving _ less
harassment at Jewish holiday celebrations, and the opening of a
private Jewish museum and library in Moscow.
   But Mikhail Chlenov, a member of a private group called the
Jewish Cultural Association, said the government has a long way to
go.
   ``Jewish life in the U.S.S.R. is in a state of crisis,'' he wrote
in a brochure on the Mikhoels center. ``Official Jewish cultural
institutions ... such as magazines, newspapers and theaters do not
satisfy the demands of our time. The growing Jewish consciousness
refuses to be compressed into an outlived framework.''

<HEAD>Congressional Democrats Say Bush Budget is a Trap for Them</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate
budget committees meet with White House budget officials next week
to try to find out what they say President Bush's 1990 budget
neglected to reveal: how the deficit will be trimmed.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., and his
Senate counterpart, Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., said Friday they would not
proceed with the high-level budget negotiations the Bush
administration wants until they get those details on deficit
reduction.
   ``Before we go any further, we want to sit down and find out
specifically where they're going, program by program,'' Sasser said.
   The lawmakers said Bush's $1.16 trillion spending plan was vague
when it came to specifying savings, a strategy aimed at putting the
pressure _ and the blame _ on Congress for cuts that will inevitably
be unpopular.
   ``Mr. Bush chose to give us only the good news,'' Panetta said of
the president's budget address Thursday night to Congress. ``He has
left it for Congress to give the American people the bad news.''
   Bush said his proposal would leave a deficit of $91.1 billion
next year, well within the $100 billion target required by the
Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.
   He achieves that level by holding the growth in the defense
budget to the rate of inflation, providing $309 billion in new
spending; making a controversial cut in the capital gains tax rate
that he says will raise $4.8 billion in new revenues; slowing the
growth of Medicare by $5 billion; selling $3.7 billion in federal
assets; and extending taxes on telephone service and airline tickets
that are due to expire.
   But of most concern to Democrats is Bush's proposal to limit a
collection of more than 1,000 programs _ most of them domestic _ to
the $136 billion spent for them this year. Democrats said this meant
that Bush was leaving the onus for finding $11 billion in cuts up to
them, reductions that could affect programs like toxic waste
cleanups, mass transit assistance, and law enforcement.
   ``This is not what we would call a flexible freeze,'' Panetta
said, referring to Bush's campaign promise to reduce the deficit by
limiting spending increases to the rate of inflation. ``It's a
flexible squeeze.''
   Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the ranking Republican on the
Senate Budget Committee, defended Bush's strategy of lumping those
programs together.
   ``There's more room for negotiation this way,'' he said.
   Darman briefed Republican senators and representatives on the
budget early Friday, and told reporters afterward that it is time
for the administration and congressional leaders to begin
negotiating on a spending plan.
   ``The spirit is very good at the moment and we've got to build on
that spirit,'' he said.

   A military aircraft crashed Friday night
despite efforts of a crew member to land the plane when the cockpit
caught fire and the pilot lost consciousness. One crew member was
killed, officials said.
   The weapons specialist aboard the F-4 Air National Guard plane
tried to land the craft but bailed out before it crashed on a runway
at the city airport, said supervisor Larry Schneider at Baer Field's
control tower.
   Lt. Kathleen Rzepka of the Indiana Air National Guard said one
crew member was killed and the other was hospitalized. She did not
know his condition. It was not immediately known which of the two on
board died.
   Earlier, patrolman Ed Bradley said the pilot was in very critical
condition, according to medics at the scene. He did not believe the
weapons specialist had suffered serious injuries.
   Both men were taken to Lutheran Hospital, but a nursing
supervisor there said no information would be released pending
notification of relatives.
   Police learned about the pilotless plane, when the craft was six
minutes away from Baer Field, Bradley said.
   The weapons specialist piloted the plane to the runway, but
ejected before it landed. There was no fire at the scene of the
crash and the fire in the cockpit had been extinguished, Bradley
said.
   Capt. Gregg Dickerson, squadron flight surgeon for the Indiana
Air National Guard, said an Air Force accident board would be
appointed to investigate the crash.

<TEXT>
   Supporters of laws to force broadcasters to
present both sides of controversial issues say they're heartened by
the refusal of a federal appeals court to consider the
constitutionality of such a statute.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
ruled Friday that the Federal Communications Commission properly
used its authority in August 1987 when it repealed the so-called
Fairness Doctrine.
   The commission had said the doctrine, written in 1949, no longer
served the public interest as defined by the 1934 Communications Act
and was unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds.
   The appeals court said the FCC was ``exercising both its
congressionally delegated power and its expertise'' when it said the
law did not serve the public interest.
   But the court sidestepped the constitutionality question, which
had been a primary issue in the court challenge. The doctrine's
constitutionality is likely to be tested if Congress writes the
doctrine into law again this year as expected.
   ``The big victory here is that any law that Congress passes ...
will not be presumptively unconstitutional,'' said Gigi B. Sohn, an
attorney representing an anti-nuclear group whose fairness complaint
against a Syracuse, N.Y., television station led to the FCC's repeal
of the doctrine.
   The court's decision ``leaves the door wide open for
congressional action to codify the Fairness Doctrine,'' said John H.
Buchanan, chairman of People for the American Way, a constitutional
liberties group.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., whose Energy and Commerce
telecommunications subcommittee held hearings on a new fairness bill
Thursday, also said the court's decision gave Congress the green
light to pass the measure.
   ``I pledge that the FCC's ill-considered decision to repeal the
Fairness Doctrine will be remedied at expeditiously as possible,''
Markey said.
   The FCC, however, said the court ``has vindicated the public's
right to receive broadcast press coverage free from government
interference.''
   President Bush has said he would veto a Fairness Doctrine bill.
Proponents have said they expect a First Amendment test in the
Supreme Court.
   All three judges concurred in Friday's ruling, although there
were partial dissents.
   In its complaint to the FCC, the anti-nuclear Syracuse Peace
Council said that WTVH, a Meredith Corp. station, had not presented
conflicting views when the station ran a series of advertisements in
1982 that said the Nine Mile 2 nuclear power plant was a ``sound
investment for New York.''
   The FCC agreed with the anti-nuclear group, and Meredith appealed
to the FCC in 1985 on grounds the Fairness Doctrine violated its
First Amendment rights. But the FCC denied the petition, saying the
constitutional question should be left in the hands of Congress and
the courts.
   However, in January 1987 the federal appeals court in Washington
ordered the FCC to consider the constitutional challenge.
   Congress stepped in and wrote the doctrine into law, but
President Reagan vetoed the bill in June 1987 before the FCC
repealed the doctrine.
   Writing for the court Friday, Judge Stephen F. Williams said
``The FCC's decision that the Fairness Doctrine no longer served the
public interest was neither arbitrary, capricious nor an abuse of
discretion.''

   Gray seals, thinned out by past hunting
and chemical pollution, face a new threat this spring because warm
temperatures have melted away their calving areas on the Baltic ice.
   The national news agency TT reported Friday that 100 seals had
gathered near Soderhamn along the central Baltic Sea coast,
apparently in search of the ice floes where they usually bear their
young.
   Most of the Baltic is ice-free, and Sweden is more than halfway
through the mildest winter in recorded history.
   An estimated 1,500 gray seals remain in the Baltic. The seals
numbered about 100,000 in 1900, but were hunted through most of this
century because they compete with commercial fishermen for their
catch.

<HEAD>Police Call for Ban on Sale of Assault Rifles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sale of rapid-fire assault rifles like the one
used last month in a Stockton, Calif., shooting spree that left five
children dead and 29 more wounded should be outlawed, the nation's
police are telling lawmakers.
   ``In my judgment, these weapons have to go,'' Los Angeles police
Chief Daryl F. Gates told a Senate Judiciary subcommittee Friday as
it opened hearings on assault rifles.
   The hearing spotlighted a bill being sponsored by Sen. Howard M.
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, that would ban the sale of AK-47s, Uzis and
other military-style, semiautomatic rifles as well as shotguns
equipped with drum magazines that can fire 12 blasts in three
seconds.
   Sgt. William Pattison, a Nassau County, N.Y., policeman and
executive vice president of the National Association of Police
Organizations, had a blunt message for the committee.
   ``Our streets are becoming a combat zone,'' he said. ``Prompt and
decisive action by Congress is needed.''
   On display was an arsenal of grease guns and semiautomatic
pistols as well as such standbys as the semiautomatic adaptation of
the AK47, long the basic weapon of Communist infantrymen from
Vietnam to Afghanistan.
   Patrick Edward Purdy used an AK47 on Jan. 17 when he opened fire
on 400 children on a playground outside the Cleveland Elementary
School in Stockton, Calif.
   Five children died and 29 children were injured as well as one
teacher.
   The hearing fell silent as Lori Mackey, a teacher at the Stockton
school, told how she and her pupils huddled on their classroom floor
while shots crackled across the schoolyard and the shadow of the
gunman crossed back and forth across their window.
   ``We hoped that he would not notice that we were there and that
he would maybe think that we were at recess too,'' she said.
   Since then, she said, nightmares and fear of strangers have
plagued her pupils. She said she has become distrustful and winces
at unexpected sounds.
   Metzenbaum's bill is being opposed by gun groups on grounds that
it would outlaw not only so-called assault rifles but also
traditional hunting rifles with a semiautomatic capacity.
   In fact, there is no functional difference between the two,
testified Edward Conroy, acting deputy associate director for law
enforcement of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   Gates scoffed at the notion that there was no way to outlaw
assault rifles without also banning the guns of legitimate hunters.
   ``It seems to me that we're smart enough to do it,'' he said.
   ``I can tell you (the difference) because I've had two police
officers killed with assault weapons,'' Gates said.
   ``Gang members love these weapons because in their drive-by
shootings they don't have to be marksmen, they don't have to be
sportsmen, all they have to do is spray,'' the chief said.
   Metzenbaum said the California episode showed that the AK-47 was
not meant for use ``in a duck blind.''
   ``We know of only one instance in which this was used for
hunting,'' he said. ``When a psychopath in California went hunting
school children.''
   Representatives of some of the nation's gun-owner groups argued
that firearms themselves are not the problem.
   The Stockton incident ``reflects a breakdown in the criminal
justice system,'' said John M. Snyder, public affairs director of
the Washington-based Citizens Committee to Keep and Bear Arms.
   He urged tougher laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.
   National Rifle Association lobbyist James Jay Baker said
Metzenbaum's bill conflicted with the Second Amendment to the
Constitution, guaranteeing citizens the right to keep and bear arms.
   ``It is just the kind of ill-considered legislation that the
Second Amendment was designed to prevent,'' he told Metzenbaum.

   Dan Quayle, in his first domestic trip as vice
president, gave a pair of speeches on human rights and democracy,
singling out Cuba, Nicaragua, Israel and El Salvador as needing
improvement.
   In remarks to the Cuban American Bar Association on Friday night,
the vice president attacked Fidel Castro's Cuba as ``an obstacle to
democracy and human rights for the Cuban people and people
throughout the region.''
   ``It is a country that has compiled a record of brutality and
oppression that is without parallel in the history of our
hemisphere. And it is a country whose leader has come to personify
they tyranny that the rest of Latin America is trying to cast off
once and for all.''
   Similarly, Quayle attacked Nicaragua, accusing the Sandinista
government of driving its citizens into exile through repression of
freedom, thus causing the massive influx of refugees into Florida.
   He said the Bush administration currently backs the diplomatic
efforts ongoing in Central America in lieu of military aid to the
Contra rebels, but added, ``We will not yield in our determination
to end Nicaragua's threat to democracy in Central America.''
   Quayle said the U.S.-backed government in El Salvador also must
do better on human rights.
   Mentioning his trip to El Salvador last Friday, in which he
warned the government and military that their sizable U.S. aid might
be jeopardized if the country's human rights record did not improve,
Quayle told the Cuban-American group, ``I believe I succeeded in
getting my message across.''
   While State Department statistics show that political murders
have declined from a high of 750 per month there in 1980 to 18 per
month in 1988, Quayle said that figure `is still unacceptable.''
   But Quayle blamed the worst human rights abuses in El Salvador on
the leftist guerrillas trying to overthrow the democratic government.
   Earlier in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith, Quayle reinforced the recent State Department report that
faulted Israel's armed forces for excessive measures against
Palestinian civilians.
   Quayle said the number of civilian deaths in the Israeli-occupied
Gaza Strip and West Bank were ``clearly unacceptable.''
   Still, the vice president promised, the Bush administration wants
to strengthen longstanding and close U.S.-Israeli ties.

   A jury found a man guilty of capital
murder Friday in the shooting and strangulation deaths of 14 family
members then recommended that he be sentenced to die for the
killings.
   Johnson County Circuit Judge John S. Patterson accepted the
recommendation and set an execution day of March 16 for R. Gene
Simmons after Simmons told the judge he know of no reason why he
should not be immediatedly sentenced.
   Simmons, who already faces the death penalty in two other
slayings, didn't visibly react to the verdict or the sentence but
several people in the courtroom applauded.
   Jurors deliberated more than four hours before reaching a
verdict, and three hours later announced a sentencing
recommendation. They could have recommended life imprisonment with
no parole.
   Prosecuting attorney John Bynum told the jury that Simmons
deserved the death penalty because he killed some of the victims to
avoid arrest before he completed his plan to kill them all.
   ``Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, life for life, '' Bynum told the
jury. ``That's where we are now in this case. That's old and ancient
and hard. But that is what we are down to in this case.''
   Defense attorney Robert E. Irwin said Simmons did not kill to
escape detection.
   `His motive was not to avoid arrest, but to satisfy a base,
primeval and vile human passion,'' Irwin said in asking the jury to
recommend life imprisonment. ``And then we can say a jury stood
staunch against an onslaught of publicity,'' Irwin said.
   Simmons, 48, has already been sentenced to die for the slayings
of two people during a 40-minute shooting rampage on Dec. 28, 1987,
in Russellville. After his arrest, authorities searching his home
near Dover found the bodies of Simmons' wife, his seven children,
two of the children's spouses, and four grandchildren. They had been
all been shot or strangled.
   As the jury deliberated, Irwin said he had received Simmons'
permission to appeal if he was convicted.
   Simmons had waived appeal on his earlier conviction.
   In his closing statement, defense attorney John C. Harris said
there was no evidence that placed Simmons at his home at the time of
the deaths nor any evidence that he personally fired the gun he gave
police when he was arrested.
   Harris told the jury that the state was asking the jury to
convict Simmons on the basis of circumstantial evidence.
   Bynum said that the evidence, though circumstantial, was strong,
including evidence that Simmons was driving his dead son's car when
arrested, owned the gun and and had it in his possession. He also
said the bodies were found at his house and that the burial of seven
bodies and the hiding of two others showed that ``this was not the
work of some phantom passer-by.''
   During the trial Friday, Simmons slugged Bynum in front of the
jury, sending spectators shrieking and ducking beneath their seats.
   Law enforcement officers posted around the courtroom immediately
swarmed over Simmons, subdued him and whisked him out a side door.
   After a recess, Simmons was brought back in handcuffs, and the
state completed its case early in the afternoon. The defense did not
call any witnesses.
   ``I'm all right,'' said prosecutor Bynum, who was hit on the chin
as the attorneys and defendant huddled in conference at the judge's
bench. ``He just got me one time.''
   Patterson, who had immediately ordered the startled jurors
removed from the courtroom, brought them back before declaring a
recess.
   ``I want you to set aside what happened in the courtroom just
now,'' said Patterson. ``This trial has gone on five days. We want
to finish it if we can. You need to disregard the incident that
happened here today.''
   After the recess, Lt. Jay Winters of the Pope County sheriff's
office read a five-page note found in Simmons' safety-deposit box in
Russellville. The jammed courtroom was hushed during the eight
minutes that Winters needed to enter the statement into evidence.
   The statement was to Simmons' eldest daughter, Sheila McNulty.
She was killed along with her husband and 6-year-old daughter.
Family members say Simmons had fathered the 6-year-old.
   ``I told you that your lack of communication with me was going to
be your downfall,'' Simmons wrote. ``You have destroyed me and in
time, you will destroy yourself.
   ``If you are trying to hurt me, then you should be very proud of
yourself, because you have done a very good job of it. You have
destroyed me. I do not want D. to set foot on my property. He turned
you against me. You want me out of your life. I will be out of your
life. I will see you in hell.''
   Simmons sat with downcast eyes while the statement was read.
Shortly after Winters finished, the state rested its case.
   After a break, the defense said it would stand on its previous
motions.
   In testimony before the morning disruption, firearms expert
Burwin Monroe of the state Crime Lab in Little Rock testified that a
.22-caliber revolver Simmons handed over when he was arrested fired
the bullets that killed several of the family members.

   President Bush says he's putting the
volatile issue of congressional pay raises on the back burner,
delaying any new move until ``the timing is right.''
   Chatting with reporters en route to this seacoast resort from a
summit in Ottawa with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Bush
said there had been ``a lot of wounds, a lot of hemorrhaging'' on
Capitol Hill over the pay raises.
   The president said that while he signed House and Senate
legislation rejecting a 51 percent pay raise, he still believes in a
substantial increase for Congress, the federal judiciary and top
government executives.
   Closing out the third full week of his presidency, Bush on Friday:
   _Gave Mulroney personal assurances that he would move as quickly
as possible to attack the acid rain pollution problem in the United
States, which also has harmed Canada's environment.
   But the president gave the Canadian prime minister no precise
timetables for reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions
from coal-burning plants, mostly in the industrial Midwest.
   Bush said he believed Mulroney was ``reasonably well satisfied''
with his statements on the issue.
   _Said he had not talked to Secretary of State James A. Baker III
about reports that Baker faces a potential conflict-of-interest
problem.
   ``I know there is nobody more ethical than Jim Baker,'' Bush told
reporters aboard Air Force One as he headed to his family compound
for a weekend of relaxation.
   Baker told reporters in Ottawa he is seeking a waiver from
ethical requirements so he could continue to hold stock in Chemical
New York Corp., a bank holding company that has lent some $4.5
billion to Third World countries.
   _Maintained there is no inflation scare in the United States,
despite fresh producer price figures showing a full percentage point
increase during January. This translated into an annual inflation
rate of 12.7 percent.
   ``I would not make assumptions based on one monthly release,''
Bush said. ``And I am not overly concerned about inflation at this
point.'' He did say, however, that ``I don't like the figures.''
   _Said that ``I'm very pleased'' with congressional reaction to
the $1.16 trillion fiscal 1990 budget he proposed to a joint session
of the House and Senate.
   Bush acknowledged his plan did not go into detail on what areas
of spending should be cut, saying ``there's a big black hole in the
budget.''
   But he also said that ``I did what I said I'd do: Here's what I
want to do.'' He said he was ``certainly conscious of the fact''
that there would be arguments with lawmakers over spending
priorities.
   Bush planned a relatively quiet weekend with his wife, Barbara,
and other family members. He said he likely would go to church
Sunday, and hinted that he might go out jogging, saying that he had
been unable to get enough exercise recently because he suffered from
a cold.
   On the lingering question of pay raises for Congress, judges and
senior executives, Bush retreated somewhat from his statement of
last Wednesday, when he suggested he would propose a new pay package
in the wake of the congressional defeat of the 51 percent raise.
   ``All I can do is make recommendations to the Congress about the
future legislation,'' he said. But he said that ``I don't want to do
something that'll look like I am simply trying to step into the
breach and raise a problem that already has caused a great deal of
divisiveness in the Capitol.''
   ``That's not what I want to do,'' he said. ``I've got to rely on
my people here to make a recommendation to me when I can be
effective for the changes that I think are overdue,'' Bush said.
   ``But what you don't want to do is come in and, when the wounded
are still lying on the battlefield, and start fighting another
battle,'' he said. ``Let's take a little time. ... I'm not sure the
timing is right. I think we've got to let the dust settle over that
battlefield.''

<TEXT>
   The operator of Holiday Spa fitness centers in
six states was accused by the Justice Department of discriminating
against blacks who seek membership in the exercise clubs.
   In a civil suit filed in U.S. District Court here on Friday, the
department charged that U.S. Health Inc. had instructed its
employees to discourage blacks from joining the Holiday Spas and
offering less favorable membership terms.
   The company operates spas in Maryland, Virginia, Massachusetts,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Georgia as well as the District of
Columbia.
   In one report, the Justice Department found that a manager in
Media, Pa., told employees ``whites won't patronize a place if there
is a mix of races,'' the report said.
   A reporter's telephone call seeking comment from the company was
not immediately returned.

   Poor weather conditions helped push the number

from 976,000 last October, the Agriculture Department said.
   The report released Friday said ``substantial rains'' occurred

eastern Texas into the middle Atlantic states.
   Average pay for all workers hired directly by farmers was $5.51

   A Minnesota couple's attempt to perform one
of David Letterman's ``Stupid Human Tricks'' didn't exactly go as
planned, but it certainly qualified for the title.
   Police had to rescue Robert Cerney and Debbie Burmeister after
they folded themselves, naked, into a collapsible sofa bed and
couldn't get out.
   Authorities say Cerney and Ms. Burmeister were trying to
replicate a feat performed by a La Crosse, Wis., man on ``Stupid
Human Tricks,'' an offshoot of ``Stupid Pet Tricks'' on Letterman's
late-night television show.
   However, the Wisconsin man, David Berg, managed to extricate
himself from his spring-loaded trap. In the copycat attempt, Ms.
Burmeister was only able to free enough of her body to reach a
telephone and summon help.
   Sgt. Dave Gabbert of the Winona Law Enforcement Center said he
was amazed that the couple could fit into a folded sofa bed. But he
advised thrill-seekers not to try it for themselves.
   ``I wouldn't do it,'' Gabbert said. ``I guess that's why they
call it `Stupid Human Tricks.'''

   Voters can't put Jack in the box.
   Jack _ yes, just plain Jack _ was an announced write-in candidate
for City Council. He wanted voters to insert Jack in the write-in
box on their ballots.
   But the city attorney decreed Thursday that just Jack wasn't
enough _ single-monikered candidates are ineligible. For Jack, whose
last name is McGrath, the ruling is yet another obstacle on a rough
and rocky campaign trail.
   McGrath, a 43-year-old commercial real estate agent, started the
political season as an aide to Steve Saltzman, who was running for
the 5th District seat. At the time, incumbent Zev Yaroslavsky
planned to challenge Mayor Tom Bradley for his job.
   Then Yaroslavsky dropped out of the mayor's race and announced
plans to run for re-election. So Saltzman dropped out. And McGrath _
er, Jack _ dropped in.
   When he failed to get the 500 signatures needed to land his name
on the ballot, McGrath launched the write-in campaign, saying he'd
run as Jack so supporters would have an easier time writing him in.
   The City Clerk's office objected and referred the issue to the
city attorney's office. The decision: Jack's not legit.
   ``There must be thousands of Jacks in the city,'' said Deputy
City Attorney Tony Alperin.
   McGrath said he was considering a challenge to the ruling, but in
the meantime the name to write in is Jack McGrath.

   The meadowlark is a ``deserter.'' The magpie
is ``murderous'' and ``thieving.'' So which one should be the state
bird of Montana?
   The question will be taken up by the Montana Legislature this
session, and emotions are running pretty high.
   The present state bird is the meadowlark, but Rep. Tom Hannah
says it deserts the state every winter, just when residents need
cheering up most.
   Enter the magpie, the black-and-white scavenger of the Plains.
   ``He's pretty; he's easily seen along almost any highway in
Montana even at temperatures of up to 40 and 50 below; he is no
fair-weather friend,'' Hannah said recently. ``He is the magpie.''
   But such talk doesn't always sit well with Montanans.
   Stan Howe, a humor columnist for the Great Falls Tribune,
endorsed the magpie as state bird two years ago, prompting a flock
of angry letters.
   Magpies eat the eggs of more desirable birds and peck through the
hides of cows, readers wrote. The most charitable adjectives Tribune
letter-writers found for the magpie were ``murderous'' and
``thieving.''
   Just as things were getting ugly, the Yellowstone Chapter of the
Audubon Society stepped in and _ depending on one's outlook _ either
defended the magpie or defamed the bald eagle.
   ``We know that in some quarters the bird isn't highly thought
of,'' said Gordon Weber of the Audubon Society. However, Hannah
said, people ``just don't realize he's in the same class as the
American eagle. He eats dead things.''

   Mikhail Baryshnikov may feel even more snug
as a bug after getting rave reviews for his part in the
Broadway-bound version of Franz Kafka's ``Metamorphosis'' playing at
Duke University.
   Tony Brown of The Charlotte Observer, the state's largest
newspaper, called the dancer's stage acting debut as a man
transformed into a giant insect ``powerful.''
   ``The surprise is that Baryshnikov _ in his first acting role in
which he does not play a dancer _ does so well in the speaking
parts,'' Brown added.
   Jim Wise of the Durham Morning Herald said the 41-year-old dance
superstar ``does make an engaging bug. A sympathetic one, even. More
importantly, a metaphorical one, which engages a viewer's
fellow-feeling and renders `Metamorphosis,' surreal as it is, a
moving expression of human feeling.''
   Not that the production needed favorable reviews to do good
business at the 640-seat Reynolds Industries Theater at Duke. The
run, which ends Feb. 25, has been sold out for weeks.
   ``Metamorphosis'' opens on Broadway on March 6 at the Ethel

   Actor Larry Hagman can have a helipad if
he keeps it quiet during prime time, but the ``Dallas'' star might
need J.R. Ewing's influence to swing the observation tower he's
seeking for his new home.
   The Ventura County Planning Commission granted Hagman's helipad
request Thursday despite some neighbors' opposition. The panel,
however, refused to approve a zoning variance allowing him to build
a 40-foot observation tower with an unobstructed view of the
countryside.
   Hagman, who plays the villainous J.R. Ewing on ``Dallas,'' and
his wife, Maj, bought close to 30 acres north of Ojai in Ventura
County and plan to build a 20,000-square-foot, split-level home.
   About 200 County Government Center workers took their lunch
breaks about the time the hearing for Hagman was finished in an

   Maytag's lonely repairman will be new, but he
still won't have much to do. After 21 years, actor Jesse White is
giving up the ``Old Lonely'' character to actor Gordon Jump.
   In one of the longest-running advertising campaigns on
television, White made the Maytag repairman into a symbol of
dependability. White first appeared as the repairman in 1967 and in
68 different commercials portrayed the man who never has anything to
do because Maytags just don't break down.
   White is becoming a consultant to Maytag. ``We're moving him
up,'' said company spokeswoman Sue Martin.
   ``I will be like a roving goodwill ambassador for the next three
years,'' White said by telephone from Calgary, Canada, where he is
appearing in the play ``Your Place Or Mine'' at the Stage West
dinner theater.
   Jump is best known for his portrayal of bumbling radio station
manager Arthur Carlson on the television comedy series ``WKRP in
Cincinnati.''
   White joked that someone could be lonely just so long.
   ``How much can you take?'' he said. ``I get so lonely, I go to

   A 25-year-old woman has filed a lawsuit accusing

dismissal from an art gallery that sells his paintings.

Galleries-Hawaii in a lawsuit filed Friday in Honolulu Circuit Court.
   She claimed that she repeatedly rejected Curtis' sexual advances
while she lived in his Kahala home and worked in his studio, and was
given no reason for her dismissal from the gallery.
   Curtis, 63, denied the accusations.
   The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission earlier
rejected a similiar complaint filed by Markell against the gallery.
   ``None of the employees interviewed were aware of sexual
harassment in the workplace,'' Deborah W. Randall, Honolulu director
of the EEOC, wrote then, adding that Markell was fired because she
disagreed with Curtis about how to handle a telephone call.

   Walter Annenberg, publisher and former
ambassador to Great Britain, has pledged $10 million to his alma
mater, the University of Pennsylvania.
   University President Sheldon Hackney said a committee of Penn
administrators decided the entire amount would go to the school's
history department. Annenberg, the former owner of TV Guide
magazine, agreed to the choice.
   The money will finance four professorships, eight fellowships, a
visiting chair for distinguished international scholars and public
figures, and a fund for special projects, said Hugo Sonnenschein,
dean of arts and sciences.
   Annenberg and his wife, Leonore, are both emeritus trustees of
the university. Penn's school of communications bears the Annenberg
name, as does the universty's performing arts complex, because of
previous gifts.
   Annenberg, 80, is a close friend of former President Reagan, and
served as ambassador to Great Britain during the Nixon
administration.
   Last year, Annenberg sold his publishing company, Triangle
Publications, to Rupert Murdoch for $3.2 billion.

<TEXT>
   Europe's top trade official wants the
Bush administration to take the lead in resolving a trans-Atlantic
dispute touched off by a ban on imports of hormone-treated meat from
the United States.
   The European Economic Community on Jan. 1 banned imports of meat
from cattle treated with growth hormones. The United States refused
to comply and slapped stiff duties on a variety of European
products. The EEC has threatened to strike back with retaliatory
tariffs.
   Frans Andriessen, the newly appointed trade chief for the EEC,
acknowledged finding a solution will be difficult.
   ``I don't know what can be done. What we cannot do is change
fundamentally our legislation (banning the meat),'' he said in an
interview Friday in his office at the headquarters of the 12-nation
trading bloc.
   The Europeans contend the stimulants pose a health risk, a claim
the United States disputes. American farmers use the hormones to
boost growth rates in cattle.
   Andriessen, a former Dutch finance minister, said he intends to
discuss the troublesome issue next week when he travels to
Washington to meet with U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills and
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
   He said he recently talked on the telephone to Mrs. Hills and
both agreed ``we should do lots of thinking to find some kind of
solution because ... nobody wants this matter to escalate.''
   Still, he said, the initiative should come from the United States.
   ``I think they should start. We are thinking as well (but) our
possibilities are limited (since) we believe that this (legislation)
is in complete conformity with our international obligations,'' he
said.
   ``So I think some kind of signal (from the) United States would
be very helpful,'' he said.
   He said the EEC has received no fresh proposals from Washington.
   On Thursday, the United States blocked a European demand for an
international investigation of the American retaliatory measures,
saying more contacts between the giant trading partners would be
useful.
   European foreign ministers gather in Brussels Feb. 20 to decide
whether to apply counter-retaliatory measures against the United
States. The ministers threatened last month to impose high duties on
imports of American dried fruit and walnuts if no progress was made
in resolving the dispute.
   ``The actions of the United States until now are not very
encouraging,'' Andriessen said.
   The ban is expected to block the import of about $100 million
worth of beef and beef byproducts from the United States. Meat used
to make pet food is exempt.
   Total trade between the EEC and the United States reached an
estimated $166 billion last year.
   Andriessen dismissed U.S. concerns that the Common Market would
try to build up barriers to foreign goods as it moved closer to
forming a single market of the 12 countries in 1992.
   He said the European nations depend on trade with other countries
to sell their exports and buy needed imports and have no reason to
create a fortress Europe.
   ``It is not (in) our interest, and it's not our intention, and it
will not be the result,'' he said.
   ``The United Sates is a very good client as we are very good
clients for the United States,'' he said.
   ``Sometimes I've asked myself in agriculture, `Why is it that the
United States is always quarreling with its best client?''' he said.
``I don't understand that.''
   Common Market members are Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France,
Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Spain.

<HEAD>Election To Test Scandal's Damage To Takeshita Administration</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A by-election Sunday is seen as a test of the damage
done to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's party by a stock-trading
scandal that has forced the resignation of three Cabinet members.
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party is battling hard to retain
the party's control of a parliament seat of a member who died Dec.
23.
   The voting, on the southern island of Kyushu, is the first
election to a national office since the scandal began last summer.
   Some newspapers predict the leading opposition group, the Japan
Socialist Party, could win, dealing a serious blow to the Liberal
Democrats.
   Suspicions of bribery and influence-peddling have Takeshita
facing opposition pressure to resign or to at least account for his
links to the information services conglomerate Recruit Co.
   The election in Kyushu is viewed as an indicator of what could
happen in July elections for half the upper house, where the Liberal
Democrats hold 143 of the 251 seats.
   Severe setbacks in the elections would endanger Takeshita's
chances next October to win another two-year term as party president
and prime minister, commentators say.
   A poll conducted by Japan's largest newspaper, the Yomiuri
Shimbun, shows Socialist Sadao Fuchigami with a slim lead over the
Liberal Democrats' Kei Oma, the newspaper reported Friday.
   Two other opposition candidates _ Tatsuzen Fujino of the Japan
Communist Party and Kozo Maeda of the Salaried Workers' New Party _
are also contesting the seat.
   The uproar over Recruit began when it was discovered that founder
Hiromasa Ezoe sold unlisted shares in the Recruit subsiary at
bargain prices to more than 150 influential politicians,
bureaucrats, journalists and businessmen before the shares began
trading publicly in October 1986.
   Share prices rose sharply then, and some shareholders gained more
than $80,000 in profits that were tax free because Japan has no
capital gains tax.
   The scandal has cost Takeshita three Cabinet ministers and his
popularity has plunged, prompting him to announce a review of
government ethics.
   ``I have vowed to myself that I must honestly accept the harsh
criticism ... must join hands with you, and must restore the
people's trust in politics,'' Takeshita told parliament Friday. He
called political reform his ``No. 1 priority issue.''
   Many lawmakers say without campaign finance reform, nothing can
be done to remove the network of obligations and expenses that
traditionally link businessmen and politicians.
   Japan is a gift-giving society, and politicians gain voter
support by presenting cash gifts at funerals and weddings of their
constituents.
   A typical legislator also has to spend more than $790,000 a year
on personnel, office rental, phone and mailing costs, said Liberal
Democratic lawmaker Kazuo Aichi in a letter to his constituents.
   The government pays salaries of only two staff members, and no
matching government funds exist to help finance campaigns.
   Politicians devote enormous efforts to raising money, leaning on
businesses and colleagues to buy tickets to fund-raising parties. In
return, business circles expect some political influence.

   Three Cuban crewmen were missing Friday and 13
others injured after their darkened, drifting cargo vessel was
sliced in two by a cruise liner off the coast of Cuba, shipping and
Coast Guard officials said.
   None of the 1,500 vacationing passengers and 600 crew members
aboard the Miami-based Celebration were injured in the pre-dawn
collision, which caused only minor damage to the liner's port bow,
said Carnival Cruise Line spokeswoman Joy Cadieu.
   The 734-foot Celebration rescued 42 of the 45 crew members aboard
the Cuban cement hauler Capitan San Luis, including one whose foot
was severed in the accident.
   ``In an interview with the captain of the cruise ship, the second
officer aboard the Cuban freighter said that the Cuban vessel had
been experiencing electrical problems,'' Carnival spokesman Tim
Gallagher said. ``The electrical problem left the Cuban vessel
without navigational lights or steering.''
   A Cuban navy frigate and tug picked up the 42 rescued crew
members Friday, the Coast Guard said. Cuba's Prensa Latina news
agency later reported that the injured passengers were being treated
at the Comandante Pedro Sotto Alba Hospital in Moa, Cuba.
   ``Basically, we've relinquished our search and rescue
responsibilities to Cuba,'' said Coast Guard spokesman Daniel White.
   The three missing men were apparently in a cabin at the stern of
the 350-foot freighter, which sank when the Celebration sliced it in
two, said Luis Diaz, another Coast Guard spokesman. The bow section
floated for hours before sinking at about 10 a.m.
   The three missing crewmen included the ship's Capt. Manuel
Velazco Morales, 34, along with Antonio Campos de los Reyes, 41, and
Ivan Freyre Diaz, 40, all of Havana, Prensa Latina reported.
   The freighter was en route from Havana to the Canary Islands at
the time of the collision, the agency said.
   A Coast Guard helicopter and Falcon jet had searched the site
Friday morning and cutters were on the way when the Cubans said they
would take over the rescue.
   National Transportation Safety Board officials said they want to
investigate the incident even though it involved a
Liberian-registered cruise liner and a Cuban freighter.
   ``We don't have jurisdiction, but we are expecting that Carnival
Cruise Lines will grant us permission to go aboard when the ship
arrives Saturday,'' said spokesman Michael Benson in Washington.
``We want to look at the ship and talk in particular to the crew on
the bridge at the time.''
   The transportation board has conducted a series of hearings in
Miami on cruise line safety.
   Ms. Cadieu said the cruise line and their insurer, Lloyd's of
London, also would conduct their own probe.
   The collision occurred in heavily traveled shipping lanes only 20
miles off Punta Guarico near the eastern tip of Cuba.
   Coast Guard spokesman Jeff Karonis said there was no information
yet on whether the accident caused a major oil spill but said it was
likely fuel tanks were split aboard the Capitan San Luis when it was
cut in half.
   The Celebration, which Ms. Cadieu said has the world's largest
floating casino, was on its way back to Miami after a seven-day
cruise that included stops at San Juan, Puerto Rico, St. Vincent and
St. Martin. It was expected to return Saturday.

<HEAD>Rodriguez Accepts Presidential Endorsement, Opposition Rally Planned</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Andres Rodriguez, the leader of
last week's coup, has accepted the governing party's endorsement for
president in elections scheduled for May 1. Opposition leaders
meanwhile planned a rally today to postpone the balloting.
   The acceptance Friday by Rodriguez came one week after he
engineered a military coup that toppled Alfredo Stroessner,
Paraguay's president since 1954, and left at least 50 people dead.
Stroessner, 76, was exiled Monday to Brazil.
   Today's demonstration was to press the opposition's demand that
the elections for president and congress be postponed six months to
give them time to organize a campaign against the Colorado Party,
which has held power in this landlocked country since 1947.
   Scheduled to attend the rally are former Arizona Gov. Bruce
Babbitt; Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn.; and Robert White, U.S.
ambassador to Paraguay in the Carter administration, said Gustavo
Riart, spokesman for the National Accord opposition coalition.
   As ambassador, White had enraged the Stroessner regime by
supporting opposition groups and making pro-democracy statements
that offended Paraguay's leadership.
   White was beaten by Paraguayan police at Asuncion's airport when,
as former ambassador, he accompanied Domingo Laino as the opposition
leader attempted to return to his homeland in 1986. Authorities put
White on the first flight out of the country.
   Rodriguez's candidacy was announced by Conrado Pappalardo,
secretary-general of Government House.
   ``Juan Ramon Chaves and Luis Maria Argana offered Gen. Rodriguez
the candidacy on the occasion of the first meeting of the national
Cabinet, and the president accepted,'' Pappalardo said.
   Chaves is president of the Colorado Party and Argana, a former
Supreme Court president and initial front-runner, is foreign
minister. Rodriguez appointed both hours after his soldiers forced
Stroessner out of power.
   Pappalardo repeated the provisional government's intention to
hold elections May 1.
   Euclides Acevedo, president of the leftist Revolutionary
Febrerista Party, said some opposition groups may boycott elections
they aren't allowed more time to organize for what would be the
first participation in elections for some.
   The rally was set before Stroessner's ouster. Its initial purpose
was to protest alleged fraud in February 1988 elections in which
Stroessner and his Colorado Party won a lopsided eighth straight
victory.
   Rodriguez and Argana say that under the constitution, elections
must be held within 90 days. The opposition argues that the
constitution is suspended since the provisional government seized
power in a coup.
   U.S. Ambassasdor Timothy L. Towell went to the Foreign Ministry
on Thursday to communicate U.S. recognition of the new government.
Towell said he stressed policies in favor of human rights and
democracy and against drug trafficking.
   He told reporters, ``We will be judging the quality of our
relations on the degree in which they move forward in all of these
areas.''

<HEAD>Newspapers Report Horror Stories of Soviet Pollution</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toxic materials saturate a lake near one Siberian
city to such an extent that stray dogs are regularly tossed into the
water to disintegrate.
   A chemical plant on the Volga River is so hazardous that
employees routinely take medical retirement at the age of 45.
   The rate of sickness from natural gas poisoning was so high in
one village that the entire town was moved away from a gas
processing plant.
   Those environmental horror stories are just three of the items
that appeared Friday in Soviet newspapers, an indication not only of
the sorry state of the environment but the new aggressiveness the
media has acquired for environmental reporting.
   Such reporting is now sanctioned under the regime of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev as good citizenship rather than anti-Soviet
treachery.
   In the Siberian city of Kemerovo, stray dogs that are not sent to
research laboratories or converted into fur boots and hats are
simply tossed into a lake filled with toxic phenols from a local
chemical plant, the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported.
   ``After several days, no trace is left,'' the newspaper said. It
was not clear if the paper was referring to live or dead dogs being
tossed into the river.
   Pravda reported that the Volga River city of Chapaevsk is known
locally as ``the city of young pensioners'' because the chemical
factory there retires so many people when they reach 45 to 50 years
of age.
   The newspaper Socialist Industry reported that Moscow's air
contains double the allowable amount of hydrocarbons, and that
ceilings on nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide are exceeded by 30
percent.
   It said city water contains five to 20 times the permitted amount
of fertilizers and other toxic chemicals.
   The paper said Moscow already has moved 174 factories outside the
city limits in hopes of reducing its pollution problem. Authorities
had hoped to move 446 factories outside the city by 1990, but it now
appears that goal will not be reached until the year 2000, the
newspaper said.
   The entire village of Muzhichya Pavlovka has been moved away from
a local gas processing plant after 76 people suffered natural gas
poisoning in January, the newspaper Nedelya reported.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Brushes Aside Reports He Will Step Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCISCO CONDE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veteran Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez
sought to play down reports he will step down or call early
elections in the face of union conflicts that have set off fears of
sustained labor unrest.
   At a news conference Friday, the 46-year-old Gonzalez, appearing
confident and relaxed, said the unions could not determine his
Socialist Party's policies.
   Responding to rumors of his early resignation, Gonzalez said:
``In politics, to comment about these things does nothing more than
contribute to an increase in rumors.''
   He said conflict with the unions would not affect Spain's current
six-month presidency of the European Economic Community.
   ``This work will not be affected by a greater or lesser amount of
social conflict,'' he said.
   Gonzalez also pledged that his 6-year-old government would make
``a maximum effort to keep on track'' Spain's annual 5 percent
economic growth rate, the highest in Europe.
   The prime minister's comments came three days after the collapse
of six weeks of talks between the government and unions over
unemployment and pension benefits. The collapse set off fears of
labor strife expected to last through the spring.
   ``Some political leaders have called either for my resignation or
new elections,'' Gonzalez said.
   ``I'd like to tell the Communist leaders who propose this that
perhaps I'd like to consider it, but not for the reasons that they,
logically, want.''
   Gonzalez was referring to a call for his resignation Wednesday by
leaders of a small leftist parliamentary coalition. The coalition
believes that elections now would favor them because the Socialists
have lost voter support.
   Elections must be held by June 1990.
   A poll published last week in the newsweekly Cambio 16 indicated
the Socialists would receive 35 percent of the vote if elections
were called now, a drop from the 44 percent they won in June 1986
elections.
   The Socialists hold 183 of the 350 seats in the lower house of
Parliament.
   Last December the General Workers Union, a former Socialist Party
ally, and the Communist Workers Commissions staged a general strike
that brought Spain to a standstill for 24 hours.
   After a nearly seven-hour negotiation session Tuesday, the unions
rejected a government offer of $3.3 billion to broaden unemployment
insurance, increase basic pensions and raise the minimum wage. They
maintained their demand for increased benefits totaling $3.6 billion.
   The prime minister said the collapse of the talks ``is not just a
failure for the government, but also a failure for the unions.''
   He said maintaining Spain's high economic growth rate was
fundamental to reducing the country's 18.8 percent unemployment,
Europe's highest.
   ``In governing, sometimes it's preferable to put at risk one's
loss of popularity than to assume the risk of not taking advantage
of the opportunities'' for economic growth, he said.

<HEAD>Ferdinand Marcos' Condition Worsens</HEAD>

   Ferdinand Marcos condition worsened to critical
when he began running a fever, a hospital official said.
   Marcos, 71, was in critical but stable condition Friday night,
said Norma Kop, a spokeswoman for St. Francis Medical Center. He had
been in guarded condition earlier in the day.
   Marcos remained in the hospital's intensive care unit and was
still breathing with the aid of a respirator, Kop said. She declined
to elaborate.
   Marcos has been in the hospital for nearly a month with pneumonia
and bronchial asthma.
   Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad said Marcos' worsened condition
``means there is infection again.''
   ``I would suspect it's the lungs because of the tracheostomy,''
Trinidad said. In a tracheostomy, a surgical incision is made in the
trachea to create an artificial breathing hole.
   Marcos underwent the emergency surgery Feb. 1 to relieve a
buildup of fluid in his lungs.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, have been living in Hawaii since
Marcos' ouster in February 1986.
   The Marcoses are under U.S. indictment for allegedly stealing
more than $100 million from their homeland and stashing much of the
money in the Unisted States.
   Defense lawyers for Marcos asked a federal judge in New York on
Friday to remove the former Philippine president from a racketeering
case for medical reasons.
   U.S. prosecutors opposed the move, saying it was too soon to make
a final prognosis of Marcos' chances for recovery.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan did not make a decision.
   A continuation of a hearing by Keenan to determine whether Marcos
is well enough to be arraigned in Honolulu is scheduled for March 6.

<TEXT>
   Wayne L. Hays, who rose from
small-town mayor to one of the most powerful positions in Congress
only to see his career ruined by a sex-and-payroll scandal in 1976,
died of a heart attack. He was 77.
   Hays served 14 terms in Congress and earned a reputation as a
tough, effective legislator feared by those who crossed him. But he
is remembered mainly for his liaison with Elizabeth Ray, the House
clerk who declared: ``I can't type, I can't file, I can't even
answer the phone.''
   Hays suffered a heart attack at home around 1:15 p.m. Friday,
said his second wife, Pat. He died a little more than an hour later
at Wheeling Hospital in nearby Wheeling, W.Va., hospital spokeswoman
Linda Crook said.
   Mrs. Hays said her husband was reading a book about Franklin D.
Roosevelt before suffering the attack.
   A private funeral was set for Monday.
   Hays, who was first elected to Congress in 1948, resigned on
Sept. 1, 1976, halting a House Ethics Committee investigation into
his affair with Ms. Ray.
   The scandal broke in the spring of 1976, when Ms. Ray, then 33,
told The Washington Post about her relationship with the congressman.
   Hays initially denied the report, saying, ``Hell's fire! I'm a
very happily married man.''
   He subsequently acknowledged the affair, but denied Ms. Ray's
allegation that he was paying her $14,000 a year in federal money
only to have sex with him.
   After Hays resigned, the Justice Department, which also was
investigating the matter, decided not to prosecute, citing a lack of
evidence corroborating Ms. Ray's account of her relationship with
Hays.
   Hays grew up in Bannock, a community of 350 people in the coal
fields of eastern Ohio. After studying at Ohio State and Duke
universities, he began teaching history and public speaking at a
high school near his hometown.
   He was elected mayor of nearby Flushing, a town of 1,200 people,
in 1939, and later served briefly in the Ohio Senate. In 1948, Hays
won his first term in Congress.
   He became chairman of the House Administration Committee in 1971
and chairman of the House Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee two years later.
   The former job gave him significant power within the House,
because the Administration Committee controlled everything from
House restaurants to staff payrolls.
   Rep. Donald Lukens, R-Ohio, said Hays ``ran his committee with
the iron hand of absolute control.''
   ``He was fierce in his attack and would take on anyone in the
House on an issue in which he had an interest,'' said Rep. Louis
Stokes, dean of Ohio's Democratic delegation in the House. ``If you
didn't stand up to him he didn't have much respect for you.''
   Despite Hays' Washington reputation as the Capitol Hill bully,
many of his heavily blue-collar constituency saw him as a man who
got things done, such as pushing through pensions for black-lung
coal disease victims or getting official documents such as Army
discharge papers and passports.
   Even after his relationship with Ms. Ray became known, Hays won
the 1976 primary for his congressional seat with 62 percent of the
vote. But the scandal ended his hopes of running for governor.
   Two days after the primary, Hays was rushed to a hospital in a
coma from an overdose of sleeping tablets. He emerged from the coma
in less than 24 hours but remained in the hospital for nine days. He
said the overdose was accidental.
   After leaving Congress, Hays returned to a 300-acre farm where he
bred angus cattle and Tennessee walking horses.
   Hays was elected in 1978 to the Ohio House, where, except for an
incident in which he threatened to punch a television cameraman, he
kept a low profile.
   He lost his re-election bid in 1980, but became chairman of the
Belmont County Democratic Party.
   Hays and his first wife, Martha, were divorced in 1976 after 38
years of marriage. That same year, he married Pat.
   In addition to his wife, Hays is survived by a daughter and two
grandchildren.

   A French teacher caught in a storm while on a
fishing trip was rescued after drifting 37 days across the
Caribbean, but he watched his son die of thirst and hunger during
the odyssey, the French Embassy said.
   Fernand Samson, 36, and his son Jeofere were caught in a storm
off the island of Guadeloupe on Dec. 30, said Frederico Fajardo, a
counsellor with the French Embassy in Mexico City.
   He said Friday that the motor in their 19-foot vessel broke down
and the boat drifted until Samson's rescue.
   News reports said the father subsisted on rainwater and fish he
caught with his bare hands. Fajardo said the father buried his son
at sea.
   Fishermen from the village of Placer in Quintana Roo state
rescued Samson last Saturday after they spotted his boat floating
off the coast, Fajardo said.
   Townspeople cared for Samson until he was able to contact the
French Embassy in Mexico City. Fajardo said he put Samson in touch
with a family in Chetumal, about 50 miles away, where he could stay
while recovering.
   He said Samson stayed with a family in Chetumal, capital of the
southeastern Mexican state of Quintana Roo, after his rescue.
   Samson, en route to Mexico City, planned to fly home to
Guadeloupe today, Fajardo said. He said Samson lives in Basse-Terre,
Guadeloupe, and has five surviving children.
   Chetumal is just north of the border with Belize, about 750 miles
east of Mexico City.

<TEXT>
   Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto arrived
today in China, beginning her first official visit abroad by
following in the footsteps of her late father, who cultivated close
ties with Beijing.
   Bhutto was greeted by about 200 screaming Pakistani residents at
the city's old airport, which is used for important guests.
   ``Long live Benazir Bhutto,'' read banners carried by the crowd.
``Long Live Pakistan-China Friendship.''
   In a break with normal procedure, the 35-year-old prime minister
did not immediately get in a waiting limousine. Instead, she walked
the line of well-wishers shaking hands and saying hi.
   ``Pakistan's relations with China are very close and friendly,''
she told China's official Xinhua News Agency in an interview before
her departure. ``My visit would give a further boost to these
relations.''
   This is Bhutto's third visit to China. She came in the early
1970s at the invitation of the late Premier Chou En-lai, and with
her father, the late prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto on a state
visit in 1976.
   Bhutto became prime minister after national elections in
November. Soon after she took office, she traveled to Saudi Arabia
on a personal visit to Mecca.
   Bhutto's predecessor, the late President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq,
died in a suspicious plane crash in August.
   While in China, Bhutto will meet with China's top leaders and is
expected to sign two agreements of limited importance _ a barter
trade agreement and an agreement on the mutual protection of
investment.
   On Sunday, she meets Premier Li Peng and Communist Party chief
Zhao Ziyang; on Monday she flies to Shanghai for meetings with
senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   Xinhua said the issue of the Afghan war would dominate Bhuto's
talks in China.
   Along with the United States, China and Pakistan have been the
main backers of the Afghan rebels fighting the Soviet-backed
government in Kabul. China and Pakistan are expected to discuss
their next step as the Feb. 15 deadline for a Soviet withdrawal
approaches.
   It is significant that Bhutto chose China as her first official
destination.
   Despite momentous political changes _ coups and wars in Pakistan,
the Cultural Revolution in China _ the relationship between the two
countries has improved steadily since January 1950 when Islamabad
first recognized Beijing.
   For Bhutto herself, the Chinese have done a great deal in the
short time she has been in office.
   In the three days after the general election in November, China's
ambassador to Pakistan met with Bhutto three times in highly
publicized meetings.
   Given China's close relationship with Pakistan's powerful
military, the move was a clear sign of Beijing's support of an
orderly transfer of power in Islamabad, Asian diplomats said.
   For China, the visit comes at a time of great fluidity in its
relations with the rest of Asia. Beijing's improving ties with India
and the Soviet Union no longer make Pakistan a natural ally. But
factors such as the close relationship with the Pakistan military
guarantee close ties for some time to come.
   Indeed, 50 percent of Pakistan's 400-plane air force comes from
China as do 1,100 of Pakistan's 1,600 tanks, according to the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Only the United
States sells more weapons to Pakistan.
   China also helps Pakistan with its nuclear industry. The two
countries signed an agreement in September 1986.
   Both China and Pakistan have denied the aid has military
applications, but Western diplomats say they are convinced that
cooperation in this field is not limited to electricity.
   Pakistan was among the first countries to recognize Beijing after
Communist China was established in 1949.
   Relations between the two countries were very good during the
administration of Bhutto's father, who visited China three times
when he was president and prime minister from 1971-76.
   The relationship improved even more under Zia, who ousted the
elder Bhutto in a coup and had him hanged in 1979. The introduction
of hundreds of thousands of Soviet troops into Afghanistan further
boosted the ties.

   A series of earthquakes hit eastern
Indonesia but no serious damage or injuries were reported,
meteorological officials said today.
   Putu Puja, an official in the Meteorology Office, said about 25
tremors were recorded Friday night. He said one tremor in the Maluku
Sea about 95 miles east of Bitung in North Sulawesi measured a
preliminary 6.0 on the Richter scale. Bitung is about 1,440 miles
northeast of Jakarta.
   ``About 25 tremors were recorded, but there were no reports of
damage or casualties,'' Puja said.
   The National Earthquake Information Center, operated by the U.S.
Geological Survey at Golden, Colo., said it recorded an earthquake
measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale in the Taluad Island, about 900
miles southeast of the Philippines. There were no initial reports of
damage or casualties.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated
areas. A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake,
capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.

<TEXT>
   A computer operator who is one of 11 formerly
terminal cancer patients saved by revolutionary transplant surgery
says the multiple-organ operation was her only hope of survival.
   ``I probably had a couple more months'' of life left, Diana
Hancock, 40, of Burlington, Wis., said Friday from her room at
Presbyterian-University Hospital. ``This was a future for me.''
   Ms. Hancock and 10 others are living free of malignancy after
receiving four new abdominal organs and being left with little or no
stomach, said transplant pioneer Dr. Thomas E. Starzl of the
University of Pittsburgh.
   ``We're pushing ourselves to the limit,'' Starzl said in an
interview.
   The transplants, believed to be the first of their kind, have
been performed on 10 men and three women since June at
Presbyterian-University. Two patients died, one of them following a
second transplant, Starzl said.
   ``It's a phenomenal accomplishment,'' said Dr. Israel Penn,
professor of surgery at the University of Cincinnati, who keeps a
worldwide transplant tumor registry. ``To keep patients alive
successfully with a big operation like this indicates that
transplantation is really advancing.''
   All 13 patients were near death and their tumors were inoperable,
Starzl said. All but the most recent survivors, including Ms.
Hancock _ who underwent the surgery Jan. 13 _ are home. The latest
transplant was performed Monday.
   Surgical teams removed each patient's liver, pancreas, most or
all of the stomach, two-thirds of the colon, and the duodenum, a
10-inch-long section of the small intestine.
   The cavity was filled with a block of organs consisting of the
liver, pancreas, duodenum and jejunum, a few feet of section of the
small intestine.
   The stomach was not replaced since it is non-essential for
digestion, which can be performed by intestines, Starzl said.
   Because she has no stomach, Ms. Hancock must eat six small meals
a day spaced an hour or two apart. Half a sandwich easily fills her
up.
   ``You try not to drink with your meals because liquid takes up
the space. You know when you've had enough,'' said Ms. Hancock, who
expects to be discharged in a few days.
   Starzl said the procedure is ``a mini-version'' of the five-organ
transplants performed next door at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh
on two 3-year-olds. Tabatha Foster of Madisonville, Ky., survived
six months before dying in May 1988 and Rolandrea Dodge of
Fruitland, N.M., died last month, six weeks after surgery.
   Both girls died of lymphoproliferative disease, an abnormal
proliferation of lymphoids, or white blood cells, that obstructed
the liver, officials said. Each had received a new liver, pancreas,
stomach, small intestine and part of a large intestine.
   ``We need better tools'' such as anti-rejection medication for
transplants involving the entire digestive system, Starzl said. ``We
need to be able to manage these so-called lymphoids.''
   Abdominal transplantation involving multiple organs ``is not an
all-or-none procedure,'' he said. ``The soundness of the surgery is
exemplified by the (13) procedures.''
   As of Dec. 31, about 1,100 people with malignant tumors had
undergone liver, kidney, heart or bone marrow transplants worldwide,
according to Penn. Eight months of cancer-free survival following a
multiple-organ transplant is ``revolutionary,'' he said.
   ``What he's trying to do is ... remove the entire tumor plus all
areas where it's most likely to spread to in hopes of curing the
cancer altogether,'' Penn said. ``There's one catch _ if the cancer
has spread (undetected) beyond the limits of his dissection.''
   Starzl said he is limiting the new procedure, at least for now,
to cancer patients less than 45 years old.
   ``It's a limited operation at present. We have to see what
happens,'' said Dr. Lewis Teperman, part of the transplant team.
``But I think it's a giant step forward.''

   The United States has granted political
asylum to two Soviet citizens who defected to the U.S. Embassy in
Bangkok, an embassy spokesman said today.
   Thai newspapers today identified the defectors as Vladimir Zhila,
a physician attached to the Soviet Embassy in Bangkok, and his wife,
Olga.
   ``Two Soviet citizens approached the American embassy seeking
asylum in the United States,'' said Ross Petzing, spokesman for the
U.S. Embassy. ``The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
determined they are refugees and they left for the United States
this morning.''
   Petzing gave no other details.
   Two Thai newspapers, The Nation and The Bangkok Post, reported
that the couple had been missing since Wednesday, when they drove
from the embassy on their way to a hospital.
   Zhila took up his embassy post late last year, the papers said.
   Last month, the United States granted asylum to a Soviet merchant
sailor who jumped ship in Bangkok.

<TEXT>
   Snow was falling in Michigan and Colorado early today, but the
rest of the country enjoyed fairly nice weather as the cold spell
that gripped the nation much of the week faded away.
   Conditions were a bit chilly over the Great Lakes and the
Northeast.
   Temperatures in the teens and 20s combined with gusty winds to
produce wind chills around 10 below zero over parts of northern New
England, Pennsylvania and New York this morning.
   Winds gusted to 40 mph at Buffalo, N.Y., and 35 mph at Detroit.
   Snow continued in Michigan as another weak cold front moved
through. A snow and blowing snow advisory was posted for northwest
lower Michigan and eastern upper Michigan.
   Southwest winds ahead of the cold front shifted lake effect snow
over New York.
   Snow also fell this morning over portions of western Colorado,
northern Utah and southeast Idaho. Rain showers were scattered over
northern California and western Oregon.
   Dense fog in central California reduced visibility at Sacramento
to zero.
   Today's forecast called for scattered snow showers over portions
of the Great Lakes, New York and northern New England. Snow showers
also were expected over western Pennsylvania, with rain or snow
showers across West Virginia.
   Scattered snow showers were expected from northeast Nevada
through northern and central Utah into western Colorado.
   High temperatures were expected in the 30s or 40s across much of
the nation.
   Highs in the 20s were forecast over the northern Rockies, the
northern Plains through the upper Mississippi Valley to the upper
Great Lakes and over northern New England. Readings were expected in
the 50s and 60s from much of California across the southern Rockies,
the southern Plains, the lower Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coast
region into the southern Atlantic states and the northern half of
Florida.
   Temperatures were to reach the low to mid 70s across southern
Arizona, the Rio Grande Valley of Texas and southern Florida.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 3
degrees at Havre, Mont., to 67 at Key West, Fla.

<HEAD>UNIFIL Officer Reprimanded For Comparing Israeli Actions to Nazis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Swedish commander of the U.N.
peacekeeping force in south Lebanon has reprimanded a Norwegian
officer for comparing Israeli army actions there to those of the
Nazis in World War II, a U.N. source said.
   The source at UNIFIL, or the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, said
Maj. Gen. Lars-Eric Wahlgren reprimanded Lt. Col. J.E. Karlsen,
commander of the Norwegian battalion, on Thursday. He spoke on
condition of anonymity and did give any other details.
   Karlsen made the remark Feb. 2 during a private meeting between
Israeli and UNIFIL officers to discuss the expulsions of 79 Lebanese
villagers from Israel's self-declared security zone in southern
Lebanon. It was leaked to Israeli media.
   The Israeli Foreign Ministry initially protested Karlsen's
remark, then demanded his removal after he said in a newspaper
interview that the comparison succeeded in drawing attention to the
expulsion of the Lebanese villagers.
   ``In World War II my fellow countrymen sacrificed their lives in
the struggle against the Nazis who were trying to expel Jews from
Norway. Nowadays you behave in south Lebanon exactly as the Nazis
did,'' Karlsen was quoted as saying.
   UNIFIL spokesman Timur Goksel, reached by telephone, said
Wahlgren called Karlsen to an hourlong meeting at the force
headquarters in the southern border town of Naqoura. He refused to
elaborate.
   Sixty-five of the deportees were from UNIFIL's
Norwegian-patrolled zone.
   Lebanon has lodged a complaint with the U.N. Security Council
against the expulsions.
   Lebanon's Foreign Ministry said 37 of those expelled were from
the Sunni Moslem village of Shibaa, which refused to cooperate with
the Israeli-supported south Lebanon army militia that patrols the
security zone with Israeli troops.
   The 5,800-strong UNIFIL, drawn from nine nations, mans a narrow
strip north of the security zone. It has been deployed in south
Lebanon since March 1978.
   Israel carved out the six-to-10-mile-wide strip when it withdrew
the bulk of its occupation army from south Lebanon in 1985.
   The strip, which extends from the Mediterranean coast in the west
to the slopes of Mount Hermon in the east, serves as a buffer
against cross-border guerrilla attacks into northern Israel.

<HEAD>Inflation Inches Upward In Mexico, Capital Flight Stops</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government says the lowest January price
rise in 11 years and the return to Mexico of about $700 million in
capital last month is proof its anti-inflation plan is working.
   The Bank of Mexico said consumer prices rose 2.4 percent in
January, the lowest for that month since 1978, the government
newspaper El Nacional reported Friday.
   The National Consumer Price Index rose by 0.9 percent the latter
half of the month, the central bank said. Higher prices for
services, rents, telephones, medicines and automotive insurance
rates spurred January inflation, it said.
   Still, inflationary momentum has inched upward in recent months,
with prices rising by 2.1 percent in December. The previous highest
monthly inflation rate was 3.1 percent in April.
   The government froze wages, prices and the peso exchange rate in
February 1988 in a bid to curb inflation that reached a record 159.2
percent in 1987.
   Consumer prices rose by 51.7 percent last year under the plan.
   The central bank, in its monthly publication, said an estimated
$700 million in capital returned to the country last month.
   It said investors were encouraged by a gradual peso currency
devaluation instituted on Jan. 1 and lower domestic interest rates.
The devaluation has averaged one peso per day.
   Analysts have said the government adopted the devaluation to
thwart investor speculation that it was planning a major, one-time
currency adjustment.
   Mexico's international reserves plunged from $16 billion in April
to less than $10 billion by December, according to private estimates.
   The run on reserves was attributed to fears of currency
devaluation, pre-payments of private sector foreign debts and
depressed revenues from oil, Mexico's leading export commodity.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega has been trying
to tidy his economic and political house before a regional summit
Monday, mindful that Nicaragua needs international help to save
itself from economic disaster.
   But the opposition said Ortega's proposals are merely window
dressing and do not seriously address the political problems at the
heart of Nicaragua's economic crisis.
   Ortega, in meetings with opposition parties, raised the
possibility of reforming electoral laws, calling early elections and
granting amnesty to members of deposed President Anastasio Somoza's
National Guard, the official Sandinista newspaper Barricada said
Friday.
   Thousands of guardsmen were imprisoned after the Sandinistas took
power in 1979, and in December the government said it still had more
than 1,700 guardsmen in custody and 1,300 captured anti-Sandinista
rebels.
   On Wednesday, the leftist Sandinista government made another
conciliatory gesture, allowing two former Somoza military officers
to leave the country after they had spent nearly 10 years at the
Venezuelan Embassy under political asylum.
   An 18-month-old regional peace plan, which Ortega and the
presidents of El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica will
try to revive at their summit, calls for democratic reforms,
amnesties for political prisoners and talks with the internal
opposition in the five countries.
   Ortega goes into the summit believing his forces have all but
beaten the U.S.-supported guerrilla movement, although scattered
fighting still occurs.
   The United States and Central American nations have been
demanding Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government make more
democratic reforms, as promised.
   ``If in Nicaragua there is no democratization, there won't be a
lasting peace,'' Ariel Bravo of the opposition Marxist-Leninist
Party said in an interview Friday.
   ``If the government agrees to allow freedom of expression, the
capitalists will start investing, the market comes alive,'' Bravo
said. ``That's what they (businessmen) want: a guarantee.''
   The opposition Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinate said Friday that
the government failed to comply with the regional peace plan while
making it appear it is seeking business and opposition support for
recent austerity measures ``under the guise of a pretended economic
and political agreement.''
   The coalition of private business groups, labor unions and
political parties also urged the government to agree to
constitutional reforms to ensure freedom of expression and changes
in laws that now ``guarantee Sandinista control over the results of
any election.''
   Elections for posts from president to town mayors are scheduled
for November 1990.
   Nicaragua needs the injections of money that Western lending
markets can provide. Those sources dried up after the United States
imposed a trade embargo on Nicaragua in 1985, four years after the
rebels began receiving U.S. military aid.
   The ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front is firmly in
power, but its rule could be threatened by the sharp budget cuts and
layoffs it has outlined to contain runaway inflation.
   Inflation rates reached 20,000 percent last year and exports have
fallen for five years.
   Ortega goes to the summit in dire need of foreign aid and loans
for Nicaragua that might be forthcoming only after political
reforms. Opposition and business groups have taken a wait-and-see
attitude toward the government's apparent attempts at rapprochement.
   ``Everybody talks about credibility,'' said Bravo. ``The
Sandinistas have lied to us so many times we don't believe them
anymore.''
   Ortega recently spoke of consolidating Nicaragua's ``historical
victory'' over the Contra rebels and of normalizing relations with
the new Bush administration, which he called more pragmatic than
that of former President Reagan.

   Six Tamils were killed in a clash
between rival militant groups in northern Sri Lanka, and nine other
people died in attacks blamed on Sinhalese extremists in the last 24
hours, police said today.
   Since early January when campaigning started for Wednesday's
parliamentary elections, more than 1,000 people _ including 13
candidates _ have been killed. Both Sinhalese extremists and Tamil
rebels oppose the government and have vowed to prevent it from
holding elections.
   A 12-year-old girl, Udanee Liyanaga, was killed when a bomb was
hurled at a political rally Friday night in Borella on the eastern
outskirts of Colombo, police said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The bomb exploded as supporters of President Ranasinghe
Premadasa's United National Party were lighting firecrackers at the
end of the rally. Twenty people, including five young girls, were
injured.
   Police blamed that attack and a series of shootings throughout
the Sinhalese heartland on the People's Liberation Front.
   The front, composed of ultranationalist Sinhalese, say the
Sinhalese-dominated government has made too many concessions to the
Tamil minority.
   In Mannar, 140 miles northeast of Colombo, six Tamil militants
died in a clash Friday between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
and the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization, police said.
   The Tigers are the largest of the Tamil rebel groups that have
been fighting the government since 1983 for an independent homeland.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who account for
75 percent of the population. More than 8,500 people have died in
the Tamil insurrection.

<HEAD>Thai Foreign Minister Says Sihanouk Resumes Post</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodia's unpredictable Prince Norodom Sihanouk
has decided to retake his post as president of the anti-Vietnam
resistance, Thailand's foreign minister said today.
   Sihanouk resigned ``irrevocably'' one year ago because of
differences with the Khmer Rouge, one of the three factions in the
resistance coalition.
   ``Sihanouk now has resumed his post again as president'' of the
resistance government, visiting Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila
told reporters in Beijing.
   Siddhi said the 66-year-old prince conveyed his decision in a
breakfast meeting today at Sihanouk's residence in Beijing.
   An aide to Sihanouk, contacted at the residence, confirmed the
prince was again president of Democratic Kampuchea, the resistance
government.
   Earlier this week Sihanouk met with Khieu Samphan, head of the
Khmer Rouge, and other resistance leaders to map out strategy for
peace talks to be held in Jakarta, Indonesia, later this month.
   At a Thursday news conference, Khieu Samphan and his partners
announced proposals for U.N. personnel to supervise the withdrawal
of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia and the establishment of a
four-party coalition government, which would include the
Vietnam-backed Cambodian government of Hun Sen.
   The resistance leaders, however, did not say anything about
Sihanouk returning to his official position. Despite Sihanouk's
quitting as president, the resistance has continued to regard him as
the only man with enough popular support to unite the nation.
   It was not clear whether Sihanouk had resolved his differences
with the Khmer Rouge. The prince last year cited Khmer Rouge attacks
on his guerrilla army as a main reason for his decision to step down
as president.
   Sihanouk now says the Khmer Rouge must be part of any future
coalition government. But in a statement Friday, he said, ``I
solemnly declare that there is no question of letting Mr. Pol Pot
return to power.''
   Pol Pot was the Khmer Rouge leader when the radical Communists
ruled the country from 1975 to 1978, during which time an estimated
about 2 million of Cambodia's 8 million people died from executions,
famine and civil unrest.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 to drive the Khmer Rouge
from power.
   The resistance wants a U.N. force to be put in place to ensure
that Vietnam ends its 10-year military incursion in Cambodia and to
keep the peace after the Vietnamese leave.
   Vietnam, which has said it will remove all its troops by
September if a peace settlement is in place, opposes bringing in
foreign military personnel. Vietnam says it has 50,000 troops in
Cambodia but Western estimates are much higher.

<TEXT>
   British Airways today gave its fleet of supersonic
Concorde jets a clean bill of health after safety checks following
the discovery of small cracks in the roof structure of one plane.
   The airline made what it called precautionary checks on five
Concordes that had made more than 3,500 landings.
   British Airways said no cracks were found in the ultrasonic
checks on the planes' upper fuselage. These checks will be repeated
after every 100 flights until the parts are replaced, the airline
said.
   The cracks in the roof of one Concorde were discovered during
maintenance work, British Airways said.
   Similar checks are being carried out on Air France Concordes.

<HEAD>Drifter Sentenced To Life In Prison For Slaying Three Indian Women</HEAD>

   A drifter who posed as an American Indian was
sentenced to life in prison for murdering and sexually mutilating
three Indian women, a decision that was applauded by Indian
activists.
   ``Everybody's happy,'' said Eleanor Evans, one of several
American Indian Movement activists who were in the courtroom Friday
night for the sentencing of Billy Glaze, 45.
   ``I think there is a sense of relief,'' added AIM member Don
McCoy. ``It has a tendency to restore my faith in the legal system
and it alleviated some fears.''
   Jurors convicted Glaze on three counts of first-degree murder and
three counts of second-degree murder in the slayings of Kathleen
Bullman, 19, Angeline Whitebird-Sweet, 26, and Angela Green, 21, in
1986 and 1987. Police believe the women met their killer in taverns.
   Glaze showed no sign of emotion as the verdict was read earlier
Friday night, but softly told Hennepin County Judge Jonathan
Lebedoff, ``I'm not the serial killer.''
   Lebedoff sentenced him to three life sentences, to be served
consecutively, making him eligible for parole in 52{ years.
   ``I have no reason to dispute the legitimacy of the findings of
the jury,'' the judge said. Noting that Minnesota does not have the
death penalty, he told Glaze it was his ``strong wish that you serve
the rest of your life in prison.''
   ``The horrors that we've been privy to over the last few weeks
cannot be undone by any sentence,'' Lebedoff said. ``There's nothing
I can do to turn back the clock.''
   The jury found that Glaze had killed the three women while
sexually assaulting them, resulting in an automatic finding of
first-degree murder under Minnesota law. The conviction on
second-degree murder charges reflects the jury's finding that the
crimes were not premeditated.
   The 35{-hour deliberations began Tuesday after a two-week trial.
   During the trial, Leroy Hamblin, a transient, testified that he
witnessed Bullman's murder and identified Glaze as the killer.
Hamblin, who said he had been drinking and smoking marijuana at the
time, said he was afraid to stop the killing.
   Other prosecution witnesses testified that Glaze told them he had
killed the women.
   Assistant Hennepin County Attorney Pete Connors, a prosecutor in
the case, said in his closing statement that Glaze's motive was that
he hated Indian women.
   ``He had a fury in his gut; he wanted to hurt them badly. He told
people that,'' Connors said.
   But Glaze's attorney, Michael Colich, said the state had failed
to prove that Glaze killed anyone. Glaze did not testify. He
characterized Glaze as a non-violent drifter who called attention to
himself by saying despicable things about women.

<HEAD>Three Fires Break Out In Manila Area, Thousands Homeless</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three mysterious fires broke out
within hours of each other in metropolitan Manila, leaving thousands
of people homeless, police said today.
   The first fire broke out Friday afternoon in Manila's slum
district of Tondo, touching off an eight-hour blaze that gutted
about 2,000 houses, said arson investigator Sgt. Baltazar Dimagiba.
   The cause of the fire is still under investigation, he said.
   At least three firemen and a woman suffered burns or minor
injuries during the fire, Dimagiba said. He said several people,
mostly children, were missing but there were no reports of deaths.
   Several Manila newspapers reported five people were missing and
presumed to have died in the fire. Radio DZMM reported that among
the dead was a looter who was beaten by irate fire victims and
thrown into the blaze.
   The reports could not be immediately confirmed, Dimagiba said.
   He said firefighters had difficulty in putting out the fire
because hundreds of shanties, made of cardboard and light-wooden
materials, blocked many side streets.
   Dimagiba estimated 2,000 houses were razed in a four-block radius
and up to 15,000 people had been rendered homeless by the fire
because most of the houses are being shared by at least three
families.
   ``They had to share small houses to minimize the cost of
living,'' Dimagiba said.
   Two hours after the fire was put under control, a second fire of
unknown origin began a street away and burned down four other
houses, Dimagiba added.
   In Manila's suburb of San Juan, fire broke out this afternoon on
the first floor of the a 12-story commercial building but firemen on
the scene said the blaze was under control.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has agreed with advisers that the
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan is no reason to cut
military aid to the Afghan rebels, The New York Times reported today.
   ``As long as (Afghan leader) Najibullah holds on, the potential
and risk of Soviet activity is very much alive,'' the Times quoted
an unidentified senior administration official as saying.
   ``If the administration took the policy decision to cut off aid
because of Soviet good behavior, it would be hard to get started
again if the Soviets start up again,'' the official said.
   The Times said Bush accepted the recommendation to continue the
aid as long as the Soviet-backed Afghan government is in power.
   The newspaper said senior foreign policy advisers suggested it at
a Friday meeting of the National Security Council.
   The Times quoted unidentified senior administration officials as
saying that although the Soviets are withdrawing troops from
Afghanistan, they continue to leave behind large amounts of military
equipment.
   Administration officials asserted that the decision does not
reflect a change in policy, but rather a change in emphasis, the
newspaper said.
   ``Our basic policy is support for the resistance,'' a senior
State Department official said. ``Our policy remains one of positive
symmetry.''
   ``We never said our support to the rebels would be proportional
to what the Soviets sent,'' the official added.
   The Soviet Union has repeatedly urged the United States to
discontinue aid to the rebels, especially in light of its withdrawal
earlier this month.
   U.S. aid to Afghan rebels is estimated to have totaled $600
million last year.

   R. Gene Simmons was sentenced to death
for murdering 14 members of his family in a rampage that his own
attorney said was motivated by ``a base, primeval and vile human
passion.''
   Simmons, who is already under a death sentence in two related
slayings, was convicted and sentenced in rapid succession Friday,
hours after he stunned jurors by attacking the prosecutor in his
trial.
   Johnson County Circuit Judge John S. Patterson accepted the
jury's recommendation and set the execution for March 16 after
Simmons said he knew of no reason why he should not be immediatedly
sentenced.
   Simmons, 48, who was handcuffed after punching prosecutor John
Bynum earlier in the day, displayed no emotion as jurors returned
the guilty verdicts at 8:30 p.m. He was similarly impassive when
they returned less than three hours later with the sentence of death
by lethal injection.
   ``Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, life for life,'' Bynum said
during closing arguments earlier in the day. ``That's where we are
in this case. That's old and ancient and hard. But that is what we
are down to in this case.''
   The verdict and sentence brought a swift end to a brief trial
that began with jury selection Monday and included just 18
prosecution witnesses. The defense did not present a case.
   In closing arguments, defense attorney John Harris said no
evidence had been presented to prove that Simmons was at his house
when the victims were killed, and said there was no evidence he had
fired the gun that he handed over to authorities when he was
arrested.
   After Simmons was convicted but before he was sentenced, the
defense pleaded with the jury to reject the state's contention that
Simmons killed some of his victims to avoid detection before he
killed them all.
   ``His motive was not to avoid arrest but to satisfy a base,
primeval, and vile human passion _ running amok without regard to
arrest,'' said defense attorney Robert E. ``Doc'' Irwin.
   The 14 family members killed by Simmons included his wife, his
seven children, two of the children's spouses and four
grandchildren. Among them was a 24-year-old daughter with whom
Simmons allegedly had an incestuous relationship.
   Their bodies were found by police on Dec. 28 and Dec. 29, 1987,
in and around Simmons' house 25 miles southeast of Clarksville in
northwest Arkansas. Autopsy reports said they had been shot or
strangled, and had died two to six days before they were found.
   Authorities went to Simmons house following his arrest Dec. 28
after he shot six people, two fatally, at four businesses in nearby
Russellville. Simmons was convicted of murder in those deaths last
May and sentenced to death.
   Simmons waived his right to appeal in that case and pleaded to be
executed as soon as possible. The execution has been delayed,
however, because of a legal challenge by an Arkansas minister.
   Irwin said Simmons has consented to an appeal of the latest
conviction.
   Simmons shocked court observers during a routine conference at
the judge's bench Friday morning when he suddenly lunged between
lawyers and struck Bynum, the prosecutor, in the chin. Simmons
punched again, missed and was subdued by court officers.
   The tape recording of court stenographer Johna Roedenbeck
recorded a voice saying, ``He's trying to get a gun,'' and another
voice saying, ``I've got it.''
   Jurors watched wide-eyed and some relatives of the slain family
members dove for the floor.
   ``We were scared to death,'' said Charlotte Crosston, whose
daughter and son-in-law died in the murder spree. ``Our legs were
like rubber. I'm glad he showed the jury, and I'm glad the jury got
to see what he's really like.''
   Before the trial resumed, Patterson told Simmons he was
disappointed in the defendant's behavior and asked, ``Can you give
me any assurance you'll behave yourself?''
   ``I can, but I don't have anything to say,'' Simmons replied.

<HEAD>Last Soviet Motorized Unit In Afghanistan Approaching Border</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last Soviet motorized unit in Afghanistan
approached the Soviet border as the deadline neared for all the
Kremlin's troops to leave the war-torn country, Radio Moscow
reported today.
   The state radio station said in an English-language broadcast
that the unit went through a mountain passage in the Salang Highway
about 125 miles from the Soviet border. The report did not say how
many troops or what kind of equipment were in the unit or when they
went through the passage.
   The Red Army newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda reported today that the
rear guard of Soviet troops had reached Aibak, 80 miles from the
Soviet border.
   Wednesday is the deadline for Soviet troop withdrawal set in a
U.N.-mediated plan.
   Radio Moscow indicated that with the withdrawal of the last
motorized unit, troops guarding the route were no longer needed.
   ``The patrols posted along the highway to ensure the withdrawal
of all troops will be called off,'' the broadcast said. It added:
``A small group of Soviet servicemen will remain at Kabul airport to
guarantee the safe landing of cargo planes from the U.S.S.R.''
   The Soviet air force has been flying hundreds of tons of flour,
canned meat and other staples into Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, to
help feed the poor. A Soviet officer in Kabul, Col. Pavel Vinokunov,
has said the airlift would continue until Monday, when he and his
men will leave the defense of the airport to Afghan government
forces and return to the Soviet Union.
   Col. Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, the military chief of staff, has said
the last Soviet soldier will leave Afghanistan on Tuesday.
   An estimated 115,000 Red Army soldiers were in the country when
the Soviet pullout began May 15. Fifty thousand Soviet troops were
reported left in the country last August.
   Krasnaya Zvezda reported as of Friday that 39,093 Soviets had
returned home from Afghanistan, leaving an estimated 11,000 Red Army
troops in the country.
   The Kremlin sent military forces to Afghanistan in December 1979
to help Afghan government forces fight Moslem guerrillas. The
guerrillas began fighting after a Communist coup in Afghanistan in
April 1978.

   Amnesty International has protested to Chad over
the detention without trial of Moukhtar Bachar Moukhtar, the
secretary of state in the Ministry of Agriculture until shortly
before his arrest.
   The international human rights organization said it had received
reports that Moukhtar is seriously ill.
   Amnesty International expressed serious concern about the case in
a Jan. 9 report, a spokeswoman said Friday. She spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   ``We haven't heard anything since then and as far as we know he
is still seriously ill and in detention,'' the spokeswoman said.
   Amnesty International said that since Chadian leader Hissene
Habre came to power in 1982, no political prisoners have been
brought to trial or had their cases referred to judicial
authorities. Instead, prisoners have been kept in secret detention
where many reportedly have died.
   Moukhtar, who formerly had been director-general of the
department of national education, was a member f the ruling party
and not known to have opposed the government.
   Amnesty International said that according to some reports he was
suspected of having criticized Habre.

   A fire in the cockpit of an F-4E Indiana
Air National Guard jet forced the navigator to land the plane when
the pilot lost consciousness, officials said. The pilot later died.
   Both crewmen ejected from the aircraft as it taxied on the runway
at Baer Field on Friday, said Lt. Kathleen Rzepka of the Indiana
Guard.
   1st Lt. David E. Kruse, 26, of Fort Wayne, died at Lutheran
Hospital, Rzepka said. The cause of death was not available.
   Maj. Wilburt J. Elliott, 39, of South Bend, the weapons system
officer on the jet, made the emergency landing. He was listed in
good condition, Rzepka said.
   The F-4 belongs to the Guard's 122 Tactical Fighter Wing.
   The cause of the fire, which apparently was out when the plane
landed, was under investigation.

   The sailboat Thursday's Child was a day
behind schedule in its effort to beat the New York-to-San Francisco
record set 135 years ago by the clipper Flying Cloud, but its tired
crew pressed on.
   The yacht had been expected to arrive in San Francisco Bay on
Friday, but that prediction was revised after the sloop made
miserable progress in a limp, northerly breeze.
   Thursday's Child was 197 miles south of the Golden Gate on
Friday, and could arrive here this afternoon, shoreside spokeswoman
Sylvia Wilkerson said, cautioning ``it could be Sunday.''
   The three-man crew was ``very tired'' after being forced into
repeated tacks, Wilkerson said at San Francisco's St. Francis Yacht
Club.
   The crew and a host of enthusiasts had hoped the boat would break
the previous record by 10 days by arriving Friday.
   If the 60-foot yacht arrives Sunday, it would be eight days ahead
of the clipper ship Flying Cloud's 89-day, eight-hour record for the
14,500-mile passage, set in 1854. Thursday's Child left New York on
Nov. 23.
   Chief shoreside coordinator Tony Lush took a philosophical view
of the delay. ``Part of being a sailor is taking what the wind gods
will allow,'' he said. ``We will take what we can get.
   ``She is pure sailboat, absolutely at the mercy of the wind,''
Lush added, noting that Thursday's Child has no engine.
   The delay, however, could make the yacht's entry through the
Golden Gate ever more spectacular.
   A flotilla estimated at 50 to 60 boats was waiting to greet
Thursday's Child on Friday, but if it arrived over the weekend there
could be hundreds in the gala fleet. The Coast Guard plans to have
cutters in the bay to prevent watery chaos.
   Besides owner Warren Luhrs, 44, the sloop is crewed by
professional skipper Courtney Hazleton, 32, and Lars Bergstrom, 54,
who helped design the boat.

   An air force plane today brought to Italy
the first bodies of Italian tourists killed in the crash of a
Caribbean-bound U.S. charter plane in the Azores.
   None of the 144 people believed aboard the ill-fated Boeing 707
survived Wednesday's crash.
   The 15 coffins were taken off the Hercules C-130 aircraft at
Bergamo airport, where the jetliner of the Smyrna, Tenn.-based
Independent Air Corp. took off.
   A second group of about 50 bodies were scheduled to arrive in
Italy late today or Sunday, according to Carla Bisegna, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman.
   At Belgamo airport, a Red Cross worker stood by as a man knelt
down, placed a hand on a carved wooden casket and burst into tears.
   A priest blessed the coffins, some of which carried name tags
with question marks next to the names. Authorities said some victims
were only tentatively identified.
   The charter flight, which carried a crew of seven Americans, was
bound for a resort in the Dominican Republic. It was about to make a
refueling stop in the Azores, a Portuguese island chain in the
western Atlantic, when it slammed into a fog-covered mountain.
   Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash.
   They have said 137 Italians were aboard.
   Italian media today, however, quoted the Italian ambassador to
Portugal as saying there appears to have been more passengers on the
plane than previously believed.
   ``On that plane, there was a lot more people than what we knew.
How and why will be difficult to understand,'' Ambassador Giovanni
Battistini was quoted as saying by La Repubblica newspaper in Rome.
He did not elaborate.
   State television reported five passports had been found that did
not belong to any of the passengers on the flight manifest, raising
suspicions perhaps there were some last-minute passengers.
   The broadcast said another possibility was the passports were of
married women who used their maiden name in the document but were
listed on the passenger list under their husband's last name.

<HEAD>Government Bans All Protests In Support Of Hunger Strikes</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with reactions to banning of protests.

<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today banned all
protest meetings intended to show solidarity with an estimated 300
black detainees waging a hunger strike to protest being held without
charge.
   The banning order specifically prohibited a protest meeting
scheduled this afternoon at a Johannesburg church by civil rights
lawyers who represent many of the hunger strikers.
   The Detainees Aid Center, a human rights group, said today that
two more hunger strikers had been taken to Hillbrow Hospital in
Johannesburg, bringing to 13 the number hospitalized this week.
   It said the two were admitted Friday, but the hospitalization
only became known today after their parents visited them. Three
others were admitted Friday.
   About 300 of an estimated 1,000 people detained without charge
are participating in the strike, which began Jan. 23 at Diepkloof
Prison outside Johannesburg and has spread to at least three other
cities.
   The Center said another striker, Mark Modiba, hospitalized
Wednesday, was suffering from pre-renal failure, a serious kidney
disorder.
   The banning order, signed by Police Commissioner Hennie de Witt,
also outlawed all other gatherings protesting against detentions or
expressing support for detainees.
   ``The banning is the act of frightened little men who fondly hope
that the problem will now go away,'' said the Human Rights
Commission, formed by anti-apartheid activists last year.
   More than 40 Johannesburg lawyers started a 48-hour fast Thursday
in solidarity with the detainees. The rally banned today was to mark
the end of the fast.
   Many of the lawyers gathered at Johannesburg's Central Methodist
Church at 1 p.m., the scheduled start of the meeting, to advise
would-be participants that it had been banned. Several dozen members
of the police riot squad watched from vehicles, and a police video
unit filmed lawyers as they spoke with journalists outside the
church.
   ``The fact that the government sees fit to ban this meeting,
called by lawyers to discuss problems faced by their clients, goes
very far down the road towards the destruction of the rule of law in
South Africa,'' said Jules Browde, a prominent defense attorney.
   The strike represents probably the strongest challenge to the
policy of detention without trial since President P.W. Botha
declared a national state of emergency in June 1986.
   The state-of-emergency regulations restrict reporting about
unrest, security force actions, treatment of detainees, some forms
of protest and statements the government considers subversive.
   On Friday, he Rev. Allan Boesak said he and Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu would consider joining the hunger strike.
   Some of the detainees have been held the entire 32-month state of
emergency, during which an estimated 30,000 people have been held
without charge for varying lengths of time.
   ``The emergency regulations have paralyzed the legal system
because detainees cannot challenge their detention in court,''
Boesak said. ``They have had to use this extreme method to draw
attention to their plight.''
   The government charged the strike was planned by outside groups,
and that some detainees had been forced to join it.
   ``It is clear the strike is being orchestrated from outside,''
Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said in Parliament.
   ``It is not spontaneous, but carefully planned worldwide by these
organizations,'' Vlok said without referring to any groups by name.
``Most of the detainees taking part do not share the enthusiasm of
these organizations.''
   Vlok said the government chose not to charge the detainees
because of the difficulty obtaining convictions.
   The Human Rights Commission said Vlok's claim of outside
instigation was ``not only ludicrous in the extreme but an insult to
the commitment and courage of these prisoners of apartheid.
   ``Support from the outside they certainly do have, no less than
the support of the entire world that rejects the evil system of
apartheid and its instruments of repression,'' the commission said.

<TEXT>
   The 1989 Berlin International Film Festival opened
with a look 50 years back to a conflict that divided Europe and
engulfed the world.
   West Berlin Culture Senator Volker Hassemer, in opening the
festival Friday, praised the German Kinemathek foundation for
preparing the memorial series ``Europa 1939,'' comprised of 50 films
produced that year in 10 European countries.
   Nazi Germany invaded Poland on Sept. 1, 1939, and World War II
began.
   The exhibit is coupled with a retrospective tribute to
German-American producer Erich Pommer, who fled Germany when Adolf
Hitler took power. The festival will screen 34 of Pommer's works.
   Twenty-two full-length feature films are entered in the main
``Golden Bear'' competition, with U.S. filmmakers out front with
four entries.
   The 12-day festival combines the international competition for
the award for best new feature film with a number of other contests,
premieres, exhibits and markets.
   The U.S. entries include ``Mississippi Burning,'' about the civil
rights movement and the fear and hatred that swept the South a
quarter century ago; ``Talk Radio,'' Oliver Stone's story of a

<TEXT>
   A working group of 24 legal experts from
the government and opposition that is part of larger negotiations on
Poland's future met today to discuss judicial reform.
   Representatives of the banned trade union Solidarity plan to
raise the issue of the need for a more independent judiciary, said
historian Bronislaw Geremek, opposition chairman of another group
trying to work out political reforms.
   Meanwhile, at least one small strike over wages by transport
workers in Piotrkow Trybunalski, a central Poland provincial city of
80,000 people, continued today, Polish television said. The strike
began Friday and is backed by the official trade union OPZZ.
   The broad-based talks, known as a ``round table,'' began with a
plenary session Monday. Working groups met through the week on trade
union, economic and political reform. Full negotiations are expected
to last four to six weeks.

<HEAD>Buckey Cleared for Jail Release on Bail</HEAD>

   A judge set strict conditions for a defendant
in the McMartin preschool child molestation case who is about to be
freed after five years beyind bars without a conviction.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders delayed the release of
Raymond Buckey until some paperwork is completed, but told him
Friday that he would have to stay away from defendants in the case
and all youngsters under 14.
   The judge also told Buckey that he would be forbidden to return
to the Manhattan Beach area where he was reared and where the
family-run preschool operated.
   ``If you fail to return for trial, the trial will take place in
your absence,'' the judge warned. He said friends of Buckey's who
posted their property to support the $1.5 million bail would lose
their real estate if he failed to appear.
   Attorneys said Buckey, who had been scheduled for release Friday,
probably won't be freed until late next week.
   Deputy District Attorney Lael Rubin, who has objected strenuously
to the defendant's release, said she is satisfied with the
conditions set by the judge, particularly those barring him from
contact with young children.
   Buckey, 30, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 61, are being
tried on 65 molestation and conspiracy counts involving 11 children.
Buckey alone is named in 52 of the charges.
   He is the only one of seven original defendants who has been held
in prison while the case crawled through the courts.
   The McMartin case burst into the national media spotlight in 1983
with lurid tales of mass sexual abuse, devilish rituals, death
threats and animal mutilations. Hundreds of children were said to be
involved.
   But at the end of an 18-month preliminary hearing, charges were
dismissed against five teachers when the district attorney concluded
there was insufficient evidence to prosecute them.

   About 500 students demanding the
release of political detainees threw rocks at riot police in
downtown Seoul today and tried to march to a government prosecutor's
office.
   Police tossed about a dozen tear-gas grenades and dispersed the
demonstrators in about 40 minutes. One dissident said at least 27
people were arrested.
   After a two-hour rally at Myongdong Cathedral, protesters
shouting ``release prisoners'' and ``arrest Chun Doo-hwan'' clashed
with riot police on a narrow shopping street.
   Chun, a former South Korean president, has been sharply
criticized recently for purported abuses of power during his
seven-year adminstration.
   The demonstrators also demanded that the government ``tell the
truth'' about the 1980 uprising in Kwangju.
   The government says 200 students were killed and at least 1,000
injured in the revolt, but critics say the numbers are much higher
and have demanded another investigation.
   Dozens of people were pushed and kicked as lines of students
tried unsuccessfully to ram their way past police, who repelled the
protesters with tear-gas grenades.
   Unlike most recent anti-government demonstrations, the protesters
did not use firebombs.
   On Friday, the government proposed legislation that would outlaw
the use or manufacture of firebombs.

   Robert Hunt scorched some kitchen tiles and told
his wife they fell off the ill-fated Challenger space shuttle.
   That, police say, was just one prop in Hunt's pose as an
astronaut during a period of make-believe that carried him through
several states, speaking engagements and marriages.
   Now his wife is leaving him and he faces fraud and larceny
charges for taking his make-believe too far.
   State police arrested Hunt on Jan. 28 in suburban Medford. The
27-year-old plumber's son from Everett is accused of swindling his
fourth wife and bride of five months, Ann Sweeney, of up to $50,000
on her company-issued credit card without her knowledge and for
taking $4,000 from a Saugus family on the promise he could get their
18-year-old son out of the Navy.
   On Jan. 6, calling himself Marine Capt. Robert J. Hunt, the fake
astronaut spoke before a group called the Experimental Aircraft
Association.
   ``He was a very good speaker, he entertained us. He held us
spellbound for 2{ hours,'' said Greater Boston chapter president,
Lou Pascucci.
   Sweeney, 23, a former optical engineer, also believed he was an
astronaut.
   ``I love the person I thought I was married to,'' she said.
   Recalling the day he was unmasked, Sweeney said, ``I was shocked.
It was almost like watching someone die. He just dissolved,
disappeared.''
   Hunt is being held on $100,000 bail in a Boston jail. His case in
East Boston District Court was continued to Feb. 15 after a request
for reduced bail was denied. Hunt's attorney, James Cipoletta, could
not be reached Friday, but he has said he urged his client not to
speak to the news media.
   Investigators compiling the story of Hunt's alleged stories say
that for the past eight years he has been fooling many people in
imaginative ways _ in Massachusetts, Florida, Pennsylvania and
Ireland.
   Montour, Pa., Township Police Chief Robert Lighow said Hunt
allegedly rode around Pennsylvania in a limousine seeking models for
his baby powder while pretending to be a powder maker. He said
Friday that he was investigating charges that Hunt swindled his
third wife, a local woman, out of large amounts of money. He would
not elaborate. Authorities say Hunt is believed to have been married
to two other women.
   Harry Doan, the owner of an air service in Daytona Beach, Fla.,
was convinced by Hunt that he was a Navy helicopter pilot.
   Last summer, Hunt chartered a jet to fly with his wife to
Montreal, allegedly charging it on his wife's credit card while
telling her the flight cost nothing because he was a space shuttle
pilot.
   In Ireland Oct. 8, he was granted a 10-minute interview with
Benjamin Briscoe, lord mayor of Dublin. Briscoe's spokeswoman said
the meeting at Mansion House, the official residence, was arranged
after Briscoe was told Hunt was a visiting astronaut.
   The spokewoman said when Hunt told the lord mayor that British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was arranging for him to be married
at Westminster Abbey, Briscoe realized Hunt was ``not the full
shilling,'' but politely said nothing. Others were completely taken
in.
   During Hunt's arrest, police searched the apartment and found
assorted military paraphernalia, flight jumpsuits and a helmet
bearing the insignia of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   Dr. Park Dietz, a forensic psychiatrist who is an FBI consultant
and a professor at the University of Virginia, said there are cases
in legal circles falling under the category of the so-called
impostor phenomenon.
   ``It's generally believed that people who are able to dupe others
into believing that they have some professional status that's
untrue, most likely suffer from antisocial personality disorder,''
said Dietz, who is on sabbatical in Newport Beach, Calif.
   He said a recent National Institute of Mental Health survey found
about 5 percent of adult urba men and nearly 1 percent of adult
urban women suffer from the disorder.
   Dietz said the ailment can be hereditary and that ``people who
(practice) such deceptions tend not to have the same depth of
emotions, of empathy and warmth, despite their charm.''
   Why are so many duped?
   ``It takes energy, thought, mental work to be skeptical about the
myriad claims to legitimacy we come upon every day,'' he said.
``It's easier to take people at their word, particularly when it
conveys some status by associating with them.''

<HEAD>Company Denies Involvement In Libyan Poison Gas Factory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German company today denied
charges by a U.S.-based Jewish foundation that it provided chemicals
for a Libyan plant that U.S. officials say is designed to make
chemical weapons.
   ``These allegations are categorically untrue,'' said Hans-Joachim
Nimtz, a spokesman for Degussa AG of Frankfurt.
   The Simon Wiesenthal Center, located in Los Angeles, accused
Degussa of supplying chemicals to the plant in Rabta, Libya.
   The United States has accused Libya of building the factory to
make chemical weapons. Libya has said the plant will manufacture
pharmaceuticals.
   Degussa once owned 42.5 percent of the Degesch company, which
manufactured the lethal gas used to exterminate Jews interned at
Auschwitz during World War II, the Simon Wiesenthal Center said.
   ``It is incredible that Degussa, which as a major shareholder in
Degesch, the company which produced Zyklon B, should once again
contribute to a genocidal mission,'' said Rabbi Daniel Landes of the
center on Friday. ``We urge the Bonn government not to release these
chemicals or any chemicals to Libya which in any way can be turned
into an agent for a new Final Solution.''
   He was referring to the Nazi policy of killing Jews.
   Nimtz said the company had delivered chemicals to a fertilizer
factory in Libya since 1983, but that it was more than 600 miles
away from the disputed chemical plant.
   Referring to the wartime connection with Degesch, Nimtz said:
``Not one Degussa official was ever convicted of war crimes. The
Degesch officials were executed.''
   Customs officials on Feb. 3 temporarily halted a Degussa chemical
shipment to Libya to determine whether export licenses were required.
   Nimtz said at the time that the chemical, hexamethylene
tetramine, could not be used to produce poison gas and did not
require an export permit.
   He said today he expected the chemical to be released for
shipment by next week.
   ``We have always delivered this chemical straight to (the Libyan
city of) Bengazi,'' Nimtz told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview. ``In the form we deliver it, it can only be used to make
fertilizer.''
   Another company official, who asked not to be identified, said
Degussa delivers the same chemical to Israel.
   ``We have nothing to do with Rabta and we are not the target of
any criminal investigations in connection with it,'' Nimtz said.

<TEXT>
   A luxury liner that sliced a Cuban freighter in two,
leaving three crewmen missing and 13 injured, returned to its home
port today while officials asked why the smaller vessel didn't show
up on the liner's radar.
   The cruise ship Celebration's crew said there was no way to avoid
slamming into the cargo ship, which was drifting without lights off
the Cuban coast before dawn Friday, said Carnival Cruise Lines Vice
President Robert Dickinson.
   ``It was not seen on radar. That's a mystery at this point,''
Dickinson said. Navigation lights on the Cuban freighter Capitan San
Luis went on only when the two ships were very close, he said.
   The 734-foot Celebration's officers tried to reverse course, but
it was too late for the 350-foot cement hauler, according to
Dickinson.
   The Miami-based cruise ship suffered minor damage and none of its
1,500 passengers and 600 crew members was injured, he said.
   A large black scrape was visible on the port side from the water
line to the tip of the bow when the Celebration approached its dock
at the Port of Miami today, but Carnival spokesman Tim Gallagher
said it looked worse than it was.
   Accident investigations were planned by the cruise line and its
insurer, Lloyd's of London, as well as the National Transportation
Safety Board, which has conducted a series of hearings in Miami on
cruise line safety.
   A team from the Coast Guard's marine safety office also planned
to inspect the cruise ship, Coast Guard Petty Officer Brian Lincoln
said today. Gallagher was confident the ship would clear that
inspection and sail again as scheduled at 4 p.m. on another weeklong
cruise.
   NTSB officials said they also wanted to look into the incident
even though it involved a Liberian-registered cruise liner and a
Cuban freighter en route from Havana to the Canary Islands.
   ``We don't have jurisdiction, but we are expecting that Carnival
Cruise Lines will grant us permission to go aboard when the ship
arrives,'' NTSB spokesman Michael Benson said in Washington. ``We
want to look at the ship and talk in particular to the crew on the
bridge at the time.''
   Two lifeboat crews from the Celebration rescued 42 of the 45
Cuban crew members, including one whose foot was severed, the Coast
Guard said.
   A Cuban navy frigate and tug picked up the rescued crew members,
who were being treated at Cuba's Comandante Pedro Sotto Alba
Hospital, Cuba's Prensa Latina news agency reported.
   The three missing men were apparently in a cabin at the stern of
the 350-foot freighter, which sank immediately, Coast Guard
spokesman Luis Diaz said. The bow section sank hours later.
   The three missing crewmen included the ship's Capt. Manuel
Velazco Morales, 34, Antonio Campos de los Reyes, 41, and Ivan
Freyre Diaz, 40, all of Havana, Prensa Latina reported.
   ``Basically, we've relinquished our search and rescue
responsibilities to Cuba,'' said Coast Guard spokesman Daniel White.
   At the time of the accident, the Celebration was on its way back
to Miami, ending a seven-day cruise that included stops at San Juan,
Puerto Rico; St. Vincent and St. Martin.

<TEXT>
   A Communist Party spokesman indicated
today that party leaders have rejected a Politburo reformer's
reassessment of the 1956 revolt as a popular uprising.
   Spokesman Emil Kimmel told Hungarian radio that speakers at a
crucial Friday session of the 108-member Central Committee said
there should be no ``single-word summary formulations'' to reassess
the past.
   Politburo member Imre Pozsgay startled the nation Jan. 28 by
saying the 1956 rebellion against Soviet control was ``a popular
uprising.'' Officially, it was called a counterrevolution.
   The meeting resumed today with the media reporting few specifics.
   Pozsgay said his assessment was based on findings of a Hungarian
Communist Party commission investigating four decades of communist
rule in Hungary.
   Prominent Central Committee member Gyula Horn, also state
secretary at the foreign ministry, hinted late Friday that Pozsgay's
stance was not accepted by most members.
   Varying only slightly from the official stance, Horn said on
television that the meeting's ``very careful assessment'' showed the
revolt ``started as an uprising, some may call it a `popular
uprising,' but later on it turned into something which could be
termed a counterrevolution.''
   State media displayed none of their new openness in reporting on
Friday's closed-door session. It was not known what was said by
Pozsgay and other senior officials.
   Kimmel told a Hungarian radio reporter that almost half the
Central Committee members will have spoken by the time the session
ends, probably late this evening.
   According to Kimmel, the speakers supported the basic idea
expounded in a report submitted by Communist Party chief Karoly
Grosz, which says ``one can establish order without a reform, but
the reform may not be instituted without order.''
   He also said Grosz called for an action program for the future.
Grosz' speech has not been published and no other details were
disclosed.
   The revolt began Oct. 23, 1956, with demonstrations for a new
government and demands that Soviet troops leave Hungary. About
20,000 Soviet troops entered Budapest to quell the uprising on Nov.
4, and Janos Kadar was elevated to power. Grosz replaced him last
year.
   Before the session, communist leaders appeared split not only
over the 1956 events but also over the pace and extent of reforms.
They were also disagreeing over introduction of a multiparty system
demanded by Hungary's mushrooming independent political groups.
   Both Grosz and other top party men went on record as disagreeing
with Pozsgay's challenge to the official view of a counterrevolution
crushed by Soviet tanks.
   His statement opened up public differences with other party
leaders and an unprecedented debate in the state press and society
about the events.
   The bloody end of the rebellion is a highly emotional issue for
Hungarians, and the Communist Party is under pressure to revise its
view.
   Alternative political movements that have sprung up in recent
months say they will not enter a coalition with the communists, as
some party reformers want, if the party does not change its stand on
1956.

   Doctors today completed an abortion on a
comatose woman whose husband had battled anti-abortion activists to
the U.S. Supreme Court to become her guardian.
   ``It's been a major battle. I am tired and wounded. I want to go
on with my life,'' Martin Klein said after the abortion was
performed on his wife, Nancy, 32. ``No other family should ever have
to go through what we have gone through.''
   Mrs. Klein, who was 18 weeks pregnant, has been at North Shore
University Hospital since a Dec. 13 car accident left her comatose.
Hospital spokeswoman Carol Hauptman at 9:40 a.m. announced that the
abortion had been completed.
   ``We are extremely relieved that the court battle is over and the
operation went smoothly,'' said Anne Zusselman, Mrs. Klein's mother.
``Now we are hopeful that Nancy's condition will improve and that we
can move on to therapy for her.''
   Klein later thanked people who had supported his efforts. About a
half-dozen pro-choice activists carried placards outside the
hospital this morning.
   Klein, of Upper Brookville, sought guardianship of his
brain-damaged wife on Jan. 26 so he could authorize the abortion
that doctors said might save her life. A judge granted his request.
   But the activists blocked the abortion at each court level until
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall on Friday turned down
their request for a stay of the lower court ruling declaring Klein
his wife's guardian.
   ``Tough battle but we won it,'' Klein said Friday by telephone
from his home in Upper Brookville on Long Island. ``We can now turn
our attention to trying to help Nancy.''
   John Short, a Farmingdale anti-abortion activist who had helped
block Klein's guardianship, also had asked conservative Supreme
Court Justice Antonin Scalia to intervene because ``they are
criminally assaulting her and killing her child.''
   Around 6 p.m. Friday, doctors gave Mrs. Klein medication that is
routinely administered about 12 hours before a second-trimester
abortion is performed, Ms. Hauptman said.
   She said it was unclear what effect the abortion would have on
Mrs. Klein.
   ``In her condition, puncturing a pimple is dangerous,'' Ms.
Hauptman said. ``She's in guarded condition and the status of her
life neurologically is very precarious. It's terrible _ really,
really tragic.''
   Outside the hospital Friday, a lone anti-abortion protester
carrying baby clothing and clutching a rosary and cross was arrested
for trespass after he lay down in front of the front door, Ms.
Hauptman and police said. He refused to give his name to authorities.
   On Thursday, Appellate Division judges said that previous New
York state court decisions had established that strangers will not
be appointed legal guardians unless no one in the family can serve
in that role.
   ``Klein was fully capable of handling his wife's affairs,'' the
lower state appeals court said.
   The next day, the seven judges of the New York Court of Appeals
in Albany, the state's highest court, declined to review the
original decision by Judge Bernard McCaffrey that named Klein
guardian of his pregnant wife.
   The anti-abortion activists, Short and John Broderick, were
rebuffed again when Marshall, who has jurisdiction over New York,
turned down their request for a stay without comment.
   Short said they would attempt to continue the case so questions
raised by the case can be resolved.
   Mrs. Klein's father, Frederick Zusselman, expressed relief, but
said the case's tragic circumstances made the legal victory
bittersweet.
   ``Life will never be the same,'' Zusselman said. ``This has been
such a horrendous ordeal. I hope no one will ever have to experience
what we have.
   ``We're really torn apart. We've been up and down on a roller
coaster. These people (Short and Broderick) have put us through
absolute hell,'' he added.
   Zusselman and his wife, Anne, live in Delray Beach, Fla., but
have been staying with their 34-year-old son-in-law during the court
battle and support his decision to seek an abortion. The Kleins have
a 3-year-old child.
   Klein said that after learning at the hospital of Marshall's
decision, ``I told Nancy that everything was going to be fine. I
gave her a kiss and came home.''

   An Afghan guerrilla spokesman said
today that a meeting to form a post-war Islamic government for his
homeland will reconvene, but others said deep divisions threaten the
process.
   The 526 delegates who gathered Friday to attend the meeting
included guerrillas, scholars and ministers from previous Afghan
governments.
   But the meeting was adjourned indefinitely after Iranian-based
guerrillas walked out in a dispute over representation at the
meeting and on a Supreme Council of guerrilla leaders.
   The Supreme Council would make many day-to-day decisions in the
post-war Afghan government.
   Rasul Sayyaf, spokesman for the gathering, told a news conference
in the Pakistan capital that the meeting would resume but that he
could not say when.
   Sayyaf played down divisions in the quarrelsome alliance of seven
Pakistani-based insurgent groups.
   But guerrilla sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said
the factions were deeply divided over the composition of a post-war
government and the role the eight Iranian-based insurgent groups
would play.
   Earlier this month, Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, chairman of the
Pakistan alliance, offered the Iranian-based groups 100 delegates to
the meeting and six seats on the Supreme Council.
   He was overruled by the Pakistan alliance's four extremist
parties, said Ghulam Waziri, political officer of Mojaddidi's
moderate Afghan National Liberation Front.
   Sayyaf said the last offer to the Iranian alliance was 102
delegates to the meeting, of which 42 would be chosen by the
Pakistani alliance. There was no offer of seats on the Supreme
Council.
   The Iranian alliance also rejected that offer.
   Mohammad Karim Khalili, chairman of the Iranian alliance, said
earlier today his delegation was returning to Tehran.
   The guerrillas based in Iran belong to Afghanistan's minority
Shiite sect of Islam.
   The Pakistani-based insurgents are Sunni Moslems and so are about
80 percent of Afghanistan's 15 million people.
   Officials of moderate guerrilla groups based in Pakistan said
they feared hard-line Islamic radicals would try to dominate a
post-war government.
   ``We don't want an extremist-dominated government to be there,''
said Azim Nasser-Zia, spokesman for the moderate National Islamic
Front of Afghanistan.
   One thing the guerrilla groups agree on is that the communist
government in Afghanistan will fall after the Soviets complete their
troop withdrawal, expected by Wednesday under an accord mediated by
the United Nations.
   The Soviets sent troops to Afghanistan in 1979 to prop up the
Marxist government. About 115,000 soldiers were stationed there when
the Red Army began its pullout in May.

   Two of 17 jailed terrorists whose release is the
key demand of kidnappers holding American hostages in Lebanon have
been released after serving five-year prison terms, Kuwait's
interior minister said today.
   Sheik Salem Sabah said the two men _ Abdul-Mohsen Rashash Abbas,
25, an Iraqi national; and 30-year-old Nasser Matar Dahash, whose
family lives in Kuwait without official citizenship _ were released
``a while ago, having completed their prison terms.''
   The pro-Iranian terrorists were convicted of a spate of bombings
in Kuwait in December 1983, including the Dec. 12 attack on the U.S.
Embassy that involved driving a bomb-laden truck into the compound.
Other targets hit in the attacks were the French embassy and Kuwait
airport control tower, an industrial center, the Electricity and
Water Ministry's control center, and offices and residences of
Americans.
   The Arab government reported five people killed, including the
truck driver, and 86 wounded. The U.S. Embassy listed seven killed,
including the truck driver.
   Speaking to reporters today, Sheik Salem said the release ``has
nothing to do with the demands of extremist organizations.''
   The 17 terrorists sent to Kuwaiti jails included three sentenced
to death by hanging, seven to life imprisonment, four to 15 years in
jail, one to 10 years and the two to five years.
   Three others, Iraqi Shiites, were tried and sentenced to death in
their absence.
   They all were sentenced March 27, 1984, by Kuwait's state
security court.
   The terrorists include Kuwaitis, Iraqis and Lebanese, most
belonging to the Shiite branch of Islam, which is the dominant sect
in Iran.
   Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
faction based in Lebanon, had demanded the release of the 17
convicts in return for two American hostages it has been holding
since 1985.
   Those captives are Terry Anderson, 41, of Lorain, Ohio, the chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press; and Thomas
Sutherland, 57, of Fort Collins, Colo., acting dean of agriculture
at the American University of Beirut. Islamic Jihad also claims to
be holding hospital administrator David Jacobsen, 55, of Huntington
Beach, Calif.
   Anderson, kidnapped on March 16, 1985, is the longest-held of 15
Westerners missing in Lebanon. Sutherland was kidnapped June 9, 1985.
   Captors of the other hostages _ including seven other Americans _
have not publicly demanded the release of the Kuwaiti prisoners.

<TEXT>
   A hurricane with winds up to 125 mph
struck the north coast of this French Pacific island territory
Saturday, causing heavy damage but no injuries or deaths,
authorities said.
   Roads were closed, electricity, water and telephone service were
cut and villages were isolated in the heavy rains dumped on the
archipelego by Hurricane Harry, according to officials in the
capital, Noumea.
   A large number of trees were uprooted, police said.
   The eye of the hurricane passed over the island about 9 p.m., and
the storm seemed to take a turn toward the east, New Caledonia's
weather service reported.
   It blew over Fiji on Friday, killing four people and devastating
several hundred acres of sugar cane, according to the Fiji weather
service.
   In Koumac, 250 miles from Noumea and the largest town in northern
New Caledonia, a school was damaged and a hospital was flooded
during the storm.
   No precise damage estimate was immediately available.
   The airline Air-Caledonia told the French news agency Agence
France-Presse it had canceled all flights to and from New Caledonia,
a group of islands covering 7,335 square miles northeast of
Australia.
   Residents of New Caledonia were warned to avoid traveling on sea
or land and to take measures to protect their homes.
   In early January, Hurricane Delilha caused two deaths and
considerable damage in New Caledonia.

   Nearly 1,000 ultra-leftist radicals shouting slogans
against the monarchy marched through downtown Tokyo on Saturday, and
five were arrested for obstructing police, officials said.
   A Metropolitan Police Department official said several scuffles
broke out during the demonstration, but there were no reports of
serious injuries.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 940
radicals participated in the march.
   Chanting ``Fight the emperor!'' and ``The final battle!'' the
radicals were surrounded by plainclothes police and riot control
personnel wearing helmets and carrying metal shields.
   Joining in the demonstration were three major radical groups: the
Chukaku-ha, or Middle Core Faction; the Kaiho-ha, or Liberation
Faction, and the Senki-ha, or Battle Flag Faction.
   All three groups have vowed to disrupt the state funeral Feb. 24
for Emperor Hirohito, who died of cancer Jan. 7.

   A Hindu laborer was found hanged early
Saturday, apparently the victim of Sikh militants who have vowed to
avenge the executions of two Sikhs convicted in the slaying of Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi, police said.
   Villagers found the victim hanging from a tree at Singh Pura,
about 50 miles southwest of Chandigarh, a Punjab police spokesman
said.
   The man was identified as Nand Lal, according to the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said no group had claimed
responsibility.
   Lal was the 14th person to be found hanged since Jan. 6, when two
Sikhs were hanged after being convicted in Mrs. Gandhi's 1984
assassination.
   Some of the other victims' bodies were found with notes claiming
responsibility in the names of Sikh separatist groups.
   Radical Sikhs, who are fighting for an independent homeland in
Punjab state, have killed more than 230 people in Punjab so far this
year, according to police.
   Sikhs are a religious minority in India, constituting 2 percent
of the nation's 880 million people, but they are a majority in
Punjab. The militants say they are discriminated against by Hindus,
who make up 80 percent of the national population.

   A small fire broke out on an oil platform in the
North Sea, but it was extinguished quickly and caused no injuries,
officials said.
   The fire flared late Friday on a platform owned by Texaco Inc.,
said a company spokesman. He said a crewman on the rig put it out.
   The 180 workers on the platform 118 miles off the east coast of
Scotland were sent to lifeboat stations but were not evacuated, said
the spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   He said the platform was not damaged and the cause of the blaze
was being investigated.
   The platform is in the Tartan field, near the Piper Alpha oil
platform, which was destroyed by fiery explosions that killed 167
men in July.

   Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto arrived
Saturday for her first official trip abroad and gave assurances that
China, long a close ally of her country, will remain a cornerstone
of Pakistan's foreign policy.
   Ms. Bhutto, speaking at a banquet put on by Premier Li Peng, said
her visit had special significance in that she was fulfilling a
promise made after her election in November to make China her first
foreign stop.
   ``This demonstrates that the democratic government attaches
special importance and priority to Pakistan's time-tested relations
with China,'' she said.
   Ms. Bhutto received a boisterous welcome from about 200 Pakistani
diplomats, residents and schoolchildren at the airport.
   She broke with normal procedure, walking away from a waiting
limousine to shake hands with the Pakistanis. Many shouted her name
and waved banners in English, Arabic and Chinese reading ``Long Live
Benazir Bhutto'' and ``Long Live Sino-Pakistan Friendship.''
   The Pakistani leader will spend three days in China. In addition
to Li, she plans to meet with senior leader Deng Xiaoping and the
general secretary of the Communist Party, Zhao Ziyang.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Afghanistan will be the main
focus of talks, but another topic is expected to be Chinese arms
sales to Pakistan. The Muslim Newspaper in Islamabad reported
Saturday that Pakistan had reached agreement with China to purchase
75 F-7 jets, a Chinese version of the MiG-21, at a cost of about
$225 million.
   China is second only to the United States in providing military
equipment to Pakistan and is now helping Pakistan develop its
nuclear industry. Both Pakistan and China have denied persistent
reports the nuclear aid has military applications.
   Ms. Bhutto, in her banquet remarks, recalled how her father, the
late Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, made his first foreign trip
to China in 1972.
   She said her father had sent all four of his children to China
for a month in 1972, when she was a student in the United States.
She returned to China with Bhutto on his 1976 state visit.
   Her speech also gave a rundown of Pakistan's foreign policy,
which generally has knitted closely with that of China.
   Pakistan was glad to see prospects of improved relations between
China and India following Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's visit
to Beijing in December, Ms. Bhutto said. She said her recent talks
with the Indian leader also ``helped to remove some of the mistrust
that has bedeviled the Pak-India relationship.''
   Ms. Bhutto also praised the warming of relations between China
and the Soviet Union, to culminate with Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's visit to Beijing in May. It will be the first
Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years.
   ``We believe that the reduction of tension and resolution of
outstanding issues between the two great neighbors will be conducive
to peace and stability in our region,'' she said.
   China and Pakistan, with common adversaries in India and the
Soviet Union, have been very close since Pakistan became one of the
first countries to recognize the Communist government in Beijing
after it was established in 1949.
   China had close relations with Ms. Bhutto's predecessor, Mohammed
Zia ul-Haq, under whose rule Ms. Bhutto's father was arrested and
executed in 1979. But Beijing was quick to support Ms. Bhutto after
she was elected to succeed Zia, who died in a suspicious plane crash
in August.
   Before the banquet, Ms. Bhutto was officially greeted by Li at a
welcoming ceremony inside the Great Hall of the People.
   On Sunday, Ms. Bhutto is to hold talks with Li and meet party
leader Zhao. She is also to meet Deng Yingchao, the widow of Premier
Chou En-lai, her host during her 1972 visit to China.
   She departs Sunday evening for Shanghai, where she is to meet
President Yang Shangkun. She will meet Deng there Monday.

   A restaurant that was moved from the Eiffel
Tower in Paris to New Orleans has become the latest casualty of
Louisiana's depressed economy.
   ``We're just not doing enough business now,'' said Daniel P.L.
Bonnot, the restaurant's developer and chef.
   ``New Orleans is a French city with a French history. It's the
perfect place to have a French restaurant like this,'' he said
Thursday in announcing the closure. ``But not with the bad economy
like this.''
   In 1981, Le Restaurant de la Tour Eiffel was removed from its
perch on the Eiffel Tower, 562 feet above the ground, when engineers
noticed the tower was beginning to sag under its weight.
   It opened in 1986 after more than two dozen partners put up about
$3.3 million. Last April, the partners filed for Chapter 13 federal
bankruptcy protection from creditors so they could attempt to
reorganize.

   Published reports today said that Defense
Secretary-designate John Tower's congressional testimony about his
work for British Aerospace Inc. contradicts an earlier sworn
statement the nominee has made about his relationship with the firm.
   The reports in The Los Angeles Times and the Legal Times raised
new questions about Tower's ties to defense contractors, one of
several areas that have held up confirmation of President Bush's
choice as secretary of defense.
   The publications said Tower has said he advised the British firm
on selling military systems to the U.S. even though he testified to
the Senate Armed Services Committee that his work for British
Aerospace concerned only non-military matters.
   Meantime, The New York Post reported today that the FBI
apparently has not bothered to talk to Tower's neighbors, examine
certain police records or investigate several car accidents
involving Tower.
   The Post, citing syndicated columnist Cody Shearer, said the
incidents included an episode on June 6, 1967 when Tower was trapped
in his hotel suite in Dallas by an early-morning blaze he
accidentally set by dropping a cigarette on an overstuffed armchair.
   When firemen broke into his room to remove him, ``he was
reportedly in no condition to free himself,'' the Post said.
   In written testimony, Tower told the Armed Services Committee he
could ``recall no actions in connection with any defense
activities'' that he had done for the U.S. subsidiary of British
Aerospace.
   Tower told the committee, which has suspended consideration of
his nomination until after the current congressional recess, that he
worked chiefly on selling commercial jets to U.S. airlines and also
advised British Aerospace on trade legislation and currency
fluctuations.
   But in a sworn deposition in June 1987, Tower said he had given
the company advice on ``selling certain systems to the Defense
Department,'' according to The Los Angeles Times.
   The statement was given in a deposition to lawyers representing
Tower's second wife in their divorce proceeding, the publications
reported.
   Tower said in the deposition that he advised the company on how
to sell training jets, fighter planes and missile systems to the
Pentagon, according to The Los Angeles Times.
   Legal Times reported that Tower earned $265,000 from British
Aerospace June 1986 until last December.
   White House spokesman Stephen Hart, with Bush in Kennebunkport,
Maine, said today when asked about the Los Angeles Times and Legal
Times reports: ``We have no information on that. It's (the issue of
Tower's nomination) before the committee. We won't comment on that.''
   The reports came as the White House moved Friday to refute
allegations concerning Tower's use of alcohol.
   The doctor who performed surgery on Defense Secretary-designate
John Tower last month released a statement saying he found no
medical evidence that the nominee abuses alcohol.
   Dr. R.D. Dignan, a colo-rectal surgeon at Baylor University
Medical Center, said Tower underwent an extensive medical
evaluation, including a complete blood chemistry analysis and an
abdominal CAT scan, prior to his Jan. 5 operation to remove a polyp
in his colon.
   ``All tests and examinations that Senator Tower underwent
indicated no abnormalities within organ systems that might be
involved with alcohol abuse,'' Dr. Dignan said in a statement
released in Dallas. ``From a medical standpoint we don't have any
evidence that Senator Tower abuses alcohol.''
   After the surgery, Dignan discussed with Tower his postoperative
recuperation and diet.
   ``I advised the senator that his normal limit of one or two
glasses of wine with dinner was medically acceptable,'' Dignan said.
   Meanwhile, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said he still has ``continuing questions
overall'' about the Tower nomination, including questions about
Tower's alcohol use. The 63-year-old former senator says he drinks
only modestly, usually a little wine.
   Nunn said the committee has received medical information from
Tower's doctors but the panel has ``done nothing with that except
read it.''
   ``We made no decision about what to do with it,'' he said.
   Nunn and the ranking Republican on the committee, Sen. John
Warner of Virginia, also said Friday that final action on the
nomination is likely when Congress returns Feb. 21 from its weeklong
recess. The action, however, depends on the results of the ongoing
FBI investigation.
   ``We're not saying any kind of deadline but it is certainly my
hope that the week we get back the committee will take a final
action on this nomination,'' Nunn said after he and Warner met with
White House counsel C. Boyden Gray.
   Nunn said he was unaware of any new allegations against Tower and
he dismissed suggestions of security breaches by the nominee while
he served as a U.S. arms-control negotiator in Geneva.
   ``We've found nothing on that,'' he said.
   Senators have said the FBI is checking any links between Tower
and defense contractors named in ``Operation Ill Wind,'' the
code-name for the federal investigation of alleged corruption in the
Pentagon's procurement system.
   Records on file at the Federal Election Commission show that
Tower received campaign contributions for his 1984 election race
from at least two men who have been named in federal affidavits
released in the Ill Wind case.
   Tower, who opted not to run in 1984, received a $500 campaign
contribution from Charles F. Gardner, a retired Unisys Corp.
employee. He also received $1,000 from Thomas Muldoon, a
Washington-based consultant. Neither has been charged in the
Pentagon case.
   Both donations were within the $1,000 limit for individual
contributions.
   Tower also received a legal contribution of $500 from the Sperry
Corp. political action committee as did Warner when he ran for
re-election in 1984. Under federal election law, the Sperry PAC
could have given up to $10,000 to any candidate for the primary and
general election.
   Sperry merged with the Burroughs Corp. in 1986 to become Unisys
Corp.
   ABC News reported Friday that Tower, in his meeting with Nunn and
Warner, said he was unaware of the campaign contributions and denied
allegations that he had a drinking problem.
   Meanwhile, The Los Angeles Times and Legal Times reported that
FBI Director William Sessions has removed himself from any
involvement in the Tower probe. FBI spokesman Gregory Jones refused
to say why Sessions, a former federal judge in Texas, had recused
himself.

   The first underground nuclear weapons test
of 1989 was strong enough to shake some highrise buildings in the
gambling city of Las Vegas, 80 miles away.
   Friday's test, code-named Texarkana, had been scheduled for
Thursday but was delayed by snow. It was delayed four hours Friday
by low cloud cover at the Nevada Test Site, a 1,350-square mile
expanse of desert northwest of Las Vegas.
   The weapon, buried 1,650 feet beneath the surface of Yucca Flat,
had an explosive yield equivalent to between 20 and 150 kilotons ot
TNT, said Energy Department spokesman Jim Boyer, who was at the
control center 7.5 miles from ground zero.
   Jan Jackson, a telephone operator at the Regency Towers highrise
apartments in Las Vegas, said chandeliers tinkled shortly after the
blast, but she said it wasn't as strong as some previous shots.
   ``Some of them have been pretty noticeable,'' she said. ``There
were no calls (from residents) but we're getting so used to them, we
don't get calls like we used to.''
   The explosion registered 5.1 on the Richter scale at the National
Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., said spokesman
Waverly Person.
   It was the 688th announced test since testing began at the Nevada
site Jan. 27, 1951.

   A judge threw out hundreds of traffic
tickets because a prosecutor was a few minutes late, and says he
thinks he's made his point.
   ``Everyone is supposed to be there by 9 a.m. and that applies to
the prosecutor as well,'' Baton Rouge City Court Judge Byron
Stringer said Friday.
   Stringer also issued a bench warrant accusing City Prosecutor
Carl Jackson of contempt, but dismissed it after conferring with
Jackson and deciding no deliberate contempt of court was involved.
   The judge acknowledged that Assistant City Prosecutor Sybil
LeDuff did walk into court about 9:02 or 9:03 a.m. Friday, and said
there has not been any problem with habitual tardiness on the part
of prosecutors.
   But he said he has warned members of the prosecutor's office that
he'd dismiss traffic cases on his docket if prosecutors were late.
   Jackson said the judge never told him personally.
   Stringer said his chief deputy clerk and bailiff both went out in
the hall at 9 a.m. but couldn't find anyone from the prosecutor's
office.
   Jackson said LeDuff, recently hired, was indeed in the hall,
taking tickets from people who had appeared and sorting through
cases to see which would go to trial. It's possible the courtroom
staffers didn't recognize her, he said.

<TEXT>
   A jet fighter of the Nationalist Chinese Air Force
crashed in a rice paddy in communist China today after it ran out of
oil, but the pilot parachuted to safety, official reports said.
   In Taiwan, a relative of the pilot said he believed the officer
had defected to China to see his grandmother in the southeastern
province of Guangdong.
   But an official at the Canton office of the state-run radio said
government officials did not believe the pilot, identified as Lin
Xianshun, 35, had defected.
   ``We believe he lost his way in the fog,'' said the official, who
would only identify himself as Wang. ``He now is in the hospital in
Canton with minor injuries.''
   The radio official said provincial officials will meet Sunday to
discuss Lin's repatriation if he is not a defector.
   Air Force officials in Taiwan said the F-5E jet fighter lost
contact with a radio tower at Chihang Air Base, 180 miles southest
of Taipei, about 10 minutes after taking off on a training flight.
   The Canton radio official said the plane crashed in a rice paddy
in Fengshun County about 180 miles north of Canton, the provincial
capital of Guangdong province.
   He said it was not clear whether there were any casualties on the
ground.
   The Xinhua News Agency said the plane was mangled in the crash.
   A relative of Lin, speaking on condition of anonymity from
Miaoli, about 30 miles south of Taipei, said he believed the pilot
had defected because Lin had complained about the ban on military
personnel visiting China.
   In 1987, the Nationalist government in Taiwan eased the ban to
allow all Taiwanese, except military personnel and government
employees, to visit China.
   More than a dozen Nationalist Air Force officers have sought
asylum in China since 1949, when the Nationalists fled to Taiwan
after losing a civil war with communist forces on the mainland.
   The latest was Li Dawei, who defected in 1983 in a trainer plane.
Li received $40,000 from the Chinese government and use of a
chauffered limousine.
   China late last year abolished the system of rewards for
Taiwanese military defectors.
   Military officials in Taiwan said 19 military personnel have
defected from China to Taiwan since 1949.
   China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and the two are
technically at war.

   Say what you will it about the savings and loan
crisis, it has done wonders for the ampersand.
   Vaguely old fashioned, the ampersand _ that curly little symbol
that stands for ``and'' _ seemed to be in a decline until the
financial difficulties of the S&amp;L industry put it on every front
page. For some reason, S&amp;Ls are always abbreviated with an
ampersand, just as superbowls are numbered with Roman numerals.
   Like everything else, the ampersand has a history. According to
Robert Hendrickson, who wrote the Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase
Origins, it was invented by Marcus Tiro, a freed slave and secretary
to Cicero, a Roman statesman, orator and author.
   Tiro's job was taking down Cicero's dictation. Cicero talked
fast, so Tiro created the first known system of shorthand, including
the ampersand. Tiro's ``Tironian Notes'' saw wide use in Europe for
nearly a thousand years.
   The &amp; itself was just a quick way of writing ``et,'' which means
``and'' in Latin. The name ``ampersand'' is a corruption of the term
``and per se and,'' which means ``as follows.''

Mary Morris laments the tendency of corporations to go modern and
abandon their ampersands.
   The Morrises note that the ad firm of Batten, Barton, Durstin &amp;
Osborne switched to simply Batten, Barton, Durstin, Osborne,
dropping the ampersand and losing ``part of the charm which led
Heywood Broun to say that the corporate name sounded to him like `a
beer barrel rolling down a flight of steps.'''
   In any event, the Morrises, getting down to business, decree that
the ampersand is to be avoided ``in writing of formal or semiformal
nature, save for the most impromptu personal notes.''
   However, the ampersand may be staging a corporate comeback, even
without the S&amp;L crisis' spur of conspicuousness, says Rick Bragdon,
senior vice president in the San Francisco firm which does ``name
development'' for companies changing their images.
   He said after stiff debate during a yearlong ``identity program''
for Pacific Gas and Electric, it was decided to abandon the ``and''
in ``PG and E,'' its old symbol, in favor of ``PG&amp;E.''
   ``We had to resolve once and for all how to represent `and,'''
Bragdon said.
   ``There were a whole variety of constituencies. Lots of people
wanted `and' and others wanted the ampersand and some thought a very
discrete plus sign would be modern and hip. We advocated the
ampersand as an inalienable part of the name _ a beautiful, stylized
ampersand.''
   However, to show how short-lived these victories are, Bragdon
said his own firm has changed its name, abandoning an ampersand in
the process. It used to be S&amp;O Consultants.
   The final decision was to go with Addison Design Consultants,
over the objections of founder and chairman Bob Ohrenschalls. In the
old days, he was the fellow behind the &amp;.

   President Ali Khamenei today told a huge
outdoor rally celebrating the 10-year revolution that Iran's leaders
are disagreeing but remain committed to their ``revolutionary
ideas.''
   ``This is natural all over the world, but there are no
disagreements over the basic policy and objectives of the
revolution,'' Khamenei said in an address to a crowded square from a
platform draped in blue and green. ``Our revolutionary ideas have
not changed.''
   Hard-liners and moderates in the regime are battling over how far
Iran should develop relations with the outside world after years of
self-imposed isolation.
   Khamenei said Iran is willing to cooperate with any country to
help rebuild the economy battered in an eight-year war with Iraq, as
long as the country giving the aid ``doesn't try to dominate us.''
   According to police, between 3 million and 4 million people
attended the rally, climaxing 10 days of celebrations for the 10th
anniversary of the overthrow of the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
and founding of an Islamic state by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   A 10-story high portrait of Khomeini suspended from a crane
overlooked the square, but the 88-year-old revolutionary patriarch,
now in frail health, was not present. He rarely leaves his Tehran
residence.
   Three choirs of children, wearing headbands saying ``happy and
blessed is the next decade,'' sang the national anthem. A squadron
of military helicopters dropped leaflets calling for unity in the
the postwar reconstruction.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported the crowd
included 230 political prisoners freed today under a general
amnesty. It said most were released from Tehran's Evin Jail, where
they were being held under sentence of death or life imprisonment.
The agency did not say for what offenses the prisoners were jailed.
   Security at the rally was tight, with guards armed with automatic
weapons patrolling and searching foreign reporters.
   ``After coming through hardships and battles today we feel much
stronger,'' said Khamenei, despite what he called ``plotting by
world oppressor powers'' _ a reference to the United States. He said
Iran wants friendly ties with all countries, except the United
States and Israel.
   The crowd listened quietly but shouted ``Death to America'' in
English and waved clenched fists when official cheerleader Ali
Montazadi led chanting in a booming baritone.
   As snow started falling at the end of the rally, Montazadi, known
to Iranians as ``minister of slogans,'' started a new chant of
``Islam is best.''
   Many attending traveled through the night for final events of the
celebrations.
   ``This is a big day for Iran and we want to show the Imam
(Khomeini) our love and support for the revolution,'' explained
Mohammad Isfahani, a white-bearded man who said he lost two sons in
the Iran-Iraq war.
   ``No sacrifice is enough in serving God,'' he said.
   Officials said similar rallies were being held across the country
to commemorate the overthrow of the 2,500-year-old monarchy.
   The celebrations take place amid increased public debate and
criticism of the clergy-dominated government.
   ``Unfortunately, instead of safeguarding the values of the
revolution, we shouted slogans. Instead of keeping the people
involved, we isolated the intelligent and active forces, making them
more and more disgruntled,'' Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri,
Khomeini's designated successor, said in an interview this week with
the newspaper Abrar.
   This year's colorful celebrations _ marked by fireworks and
floodlit buildings _ contrast sharply with previous years during the
grueling war with Iraq.
   A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire took effect Aug. 20 in the war, which
took the lives of 1 million Iranians and Iraqis.

   Afghan Shiite Moslem guerrillas
supported by Iran are demanding a major voice in the future of
Afghanistan, despite opposition from more powerful, rival Sunni
guerrilla groups.
   Iran's revolutionary Shiite government wants to use the Afghan
Shiites to exert influence in neighboring Afghanistan and try to
block the influence of the United States and Pakistan, according to
Afghan analysts.
   ``Iran wants to play the Shiite card in Afghanistan,'' said a
senior independent guerrilla official, who declined to be named.
   The United States and Pakistan have backed the Pakistan-based
Sunni groups who have been battling the Afghan government nearly a
decade.
   Shiite guerrilla leaders pulled out Friday from a meeting of
Afghan guerrilla leaders in Islamabad , which was held to try to
form an interim government to replace Afghanistan's tottering
communist regime.
   Sunni Afghan guerrilla groups refused to recognize an earlier
agreement to seat 100 Shiite representatives at the council because
they wanted to reduce the number of Shiite delegates.
   Eight Shiite Afghan guerrilla organizations are based in Iran,
but little is known about them. The groups are armed, supplied and
trained by Iran and appear to be under Iranian control.
   Seven Sunni Afghan guerrilla groups are based in Pakistan with
headquarters in the frontier city of Peshawar. But the much larger
Sunni groups are not based primarily on religious loyalties.
   Occasional reports of friction and clashes between Sunni and
Shiite guerrillas have come out of Afghanistan.
   Iranian Revolutionary Guards reportedly have operated at times in
Shiite areas of Afghanistan, aiding the Iranian-based guerrillas
against conservative Shiites who oppose Tehran's revolutionary
fundamentalism.
   Mohammad Karim Khalili, chairman of the alliance of the Iranian
based groups, said the groups are not primarily promoted by Shiite
loyalties despite their religious base. The Shiite groups, he said,
are only seeking equal rights for all religious and ethnic groups
and an end to discrimination they suffered in the past.
   ``We want an Islamic government in Afghanistan, it must be
independent and it must be non-aligned,'' he said in an interview
with The Associated Press.
   Shiites were discriminated against by past Sunni-dominated Afghan
governments before the Communists seized power in 1978. Shiites were
banned from the armed forces, most government posts and had limited
educational and career opportunities, according to Afghan exiles.
   Khalili said about 30 percent of Afghans are Shiites, but most
estimates put the number of Shiites at about 15 percent, with Sunnis
making up about 80 percent of the population.
   Shiite guerrilla groups have played a comparatively small role in
the decade-long war against the Afghan Communist government and
Soviet forces that supported the regime, according to most Afghan
analysts.
   There are no reliable figures on the fighting strength of the
various Sunni and Shiite guerrilla groups. Estimates indicate Sunni
fighters outnumber Shiite guerrillas 10-to-1.
   Khalili said he could not provide any figures on the number of
fighters the Shiites can field but said their forces had occupied
large areas of Afghanistan.
   Some of the Pakistani-based Sunni guerrilla groups operate from
Iran into Afghanistan, but their leaders complain that the Iranians
obstruct operations and limit or delay supplies. Other Sunni groups
pulled out of Iran or refused to operate there because of frequent
problems.
   Khalili denied charges the Shiite groups are influenced by Iran,
saying they had simply received aid from the Iranians.
   ``We are from Afghanistan, we are Afghani, we will never accept
interference in our affairs from any country,'' he said.
   Iran has little chance of exporting its revolutionary brand of
fundamentalism to conservative, Sunni-dominated Afghanistan, said
Naim Majrooh, head of the Afghan Information Center, which monitors
events in Afghanistan.
   But the Sunni guerrilla groups are deeply divided over sharing
power, political aims and other issues and their alliance has been
able to agree on very little.
   Even a relatively small force such as the Shiite guerrillas could
promote Iranian interests in the confusion likely to follow the
expected fall of the communist regime, some analysts say.
   ``In a divided Afghanistan, a trained and well armed force loyal
to Iran could be very useful to the Iranians,'' Majrooh said.

   Two money bags containing $365,000 fell
out of an armored truck, so Dominic and Mildred Olio did what came
naturally _ they picked them up and took them to police.
   ``We did what we felt we should do,'' said Olio, 78.
   ``My husband's just too honest,'' said his 65-year-old wife.
   The Olios will receive a reward for their honesty, said Jerry
Reeder, president of the Berkshire Armored Car Co., said from his
Pittsfield, Mass., office.
   ``We are very grateful to that couple,'' he said.
   The Olios were driving down Main Street when the bags fell out of
the truck Friday.
   ``The driver sped up just past the Prospect Street traffic light
and he must have hit a bump because a door flew open and the bags
fell out,'' Olio said.
   The armored truck kept going but Olio turned around and retrieved
the bags.
   ``They were pretty heavy, probably weighed 40 or 50 pounds
between 'em,'' said the retired mailman, who took the bags to the
police department.
   ``Something like that doesn't happen very often around here.
Those are honest people,'' said officer Greg Austin.

   President Najib today accused Pakistan
of massing troops along the border to invade and later annex
Afghanistan.
   In a speech broadcast on national radio and television, Najib
said his government had received information that Pakistani forces
were preparing to attack the southern Afghan city of Jallabad. He
did not give details.
   ``Militarist and reactionary parties envisage swallowing our
country and turning it into a fifth province of Pakistan,'' the
43-year-old president said in his strongest statement yet against
Pakistan.
   There was no immediate comment from Pakistani officials.
   The seven leading guerrilla groups fighting Afghanistan's
Soviet-backed government are based in Pakistan, their main backer
along with the United States.
   The Soviets are to withdraw the last of their estimated 115,000
soldiers from Afghanistan by Wednesday, and guerrilla leaders have
been struggling to agree on the composition of a new government.
   Many diplomats predict Najib's government will not remain in
power long after the Soviet pullout.

   Human rights activists Saturday
threatened defiance and warned of rising black anger after police
banned meetings intended to support a hunger strike by 300 blacks
detained without charge.
   Some of the strikers have gone 20 days without food, and lawyers
say 13 have been hospitalized. A support committee said many were in
danger of dying or suffering irreparable physical damage.
   The ban specifically prohibited a protest meeting scheduled
Saturday at a Johannesburg church by civil rights lawyers who
represent strikers.
   The order, signed by Police Commissioner Hennie de Witt, also
outlawed all other gatherings protesting detentions or expressing
support for detainees.
   ``The banning is the act of frightened little men who fondly hope
that the problem will now go away,'' said the Human Rights
Commission, formed by anti-apartheid activists last year.
   The Hunger Strikers Support Committee, a coalition established
last week, said the ban ``will not prevent public expressions of
solidarity with detainees. The issue is far too serious.''
   ``The government's intransigence will only exacerbate the already
widespread feelings of anger and alienation in the black
community,'' the committee said.
   More than 40 Johannesburg lawyers started a 48-hour fast Thursday
in solidarity with the detainees. They had planned to end the fast
at Saturday's meeting.
   Many of the lawyers gathered at Johannesburg's Central Methodist
Church at 1 p.m., the scheduled start of the meeting, to advise
would-be participants it had been banned. Several dozen riot police
watched from vehicles, and a police video unit filmed lawyers as
they spoke with journalists outside the church.
   ``The fact that the government sees fit to ban this meeting,
called by lawyers to discuss problems faced by their clients, goes
very far down the road toward the destruction of the rule of law in
South Africa,'' said Jules Browde, a prominent defense attorney.
   About 300 of an estimated 1,000 people detained without charge
have joined the strike, which began Jan. 23 at Diepkloof Prison
outside Johannesburg and spread to at least three other cities.
   The strike is widely viewed as the most serious challenge to the
policy of indefinite detention without trial since the government
declared a national state of emergency in June 1986.
   Some detainees have been held for the entire emergency, during
which an estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge
for varying periods.
   The government says it has not charged the detainees because of
the difficulty obtaining convictions.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok alleged Friday the strike was
planned by outside groups and that some detainees had been forced to
join it.
   The Human Rights Commission said Vlok's allegation was ``not only
ludicrous in the extreme but an insult to the commitment and courage
of these prisoners of apartheid.''
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no voice
in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate schools, districts and health services.

   The family of a woman who gave birth while
in a coma expressed support for anti-abortion activists fighting a
losing battle against a New York man's effort to have the operation
performed on his comatose wife.
   ``We should take whatever God has given us and that's the way it
is,'' said David Blodgett Sr., whose daughter-in-law, Barbara
Blodgett, was three months pregnant when she suffered a brain injury
in an auto accident last June.
   The 24-year-old woman gave birth to a healthy boy, Simon, on Dec.
9. Despite a gloomy prognosis, she began to regain consciousness
shortly after the birth and can now sit up in a wheelchair and hold
a bottle to Simon's lips.
   Blodgett said he spoke Friday with John Broderick, one of two
anti-abortion activists who challenged the request by Martin Klein
of Upper Brookville, N.Y. that he be appointed guardian of his
comatose wife, Nancy.
   New York state's highest court on Friday refused to let Broderick
and John Short intervene in the case. U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Thurgood Marshall subsequently rejected their request for a stay of
state court rulings granting Klein guardianship, and doctors
performed the abortion today.
   Mrs. Klein, who was 18 weeks pregnant, has been in a coma at a
hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., since an auto accident Dec. 13, and has
been given only a slight chance of recovering. Klein said physicians
advised him an abortion may save her life.
   Blodgett said he called Mrs. Klein's mother Thursday to offer
information. ``I told her what transpired with Barbie,'' he said.
``I don't think taking the baby is going to be any benefit to the
mother.''
   Blodgett, who opposes abortion, said he was not able to talk with
Klein.
   Members of Mrs. Blodgett's family point to her recovery as proof
that doctors can be wrong in such cases.
   ``They (doctors) were at one time telling us the same kind of
thing,'' said Greg Valenzuela, Mrs. Blodgett's father. ``All we
asked them to do is make the attempt to maintain both as best they
could. Once they decided to do it, it didn't seem like a major
problem.''
   Blodgett said his daughter-in-law's life was also threatened by
elevated body temperatures caused by the brain injury, and that the
antibiotics used to treat the fever were a threat to the fetus. But
there was never any serious consideration of trying to save one over
the other, he said.

   Two days after the House voted by an 8-1 margin
to bury a 51 percent congressional pay raise last week, Speaker Jim
Wright was asked if he would consider a smaller increase.
   ``That question has been answered,'' he told reporters, referring
to the rejection vote. ``I can count.''
   ``Everyone wants to change the subject and move on,'' said Rep.
Vic Fazio, D-Calif., who was a supporter of the raise. ``It (the pay
raise battle) left deep scars that won't be quickly healing. There's
a mutual frustration with each other.''
   Such comments are not surprising in the aftermath of the 380-48
House vote, and the 94-6 Senate tally, to reject a raise that
brought howls of protest on talk shows across the nation. As tired
as lawmakers may be of the painful affair, however, at least some
issues linked to it won't go away.
   Common Cause, the self-styled citizen's lobby, says it will
maintain pressure on Congress to eliminate the outside income
lawmakers receive from special interest groups.
   ``This Congress cannot long ignore the increasing call for
ethical reform,'' said Fazio.
   The Senate voted two weeks ago to bar members from pocketing fees
for speaking to various groups, including special interest lobbies.
But it made the change contingent on approval of the pay raise.
   The House had been planning to vote on the honoraria issue last
Thursday, coupled with a plan by Wright to scale the raise back to
30 percent. The issue went on the back burner Tuesday, when the
House decided the public wouldn't stand for any raise.
   ``It's a major setback for reform,'' said House Majority Whip
Tony Coelho, D-Calif., ``I thought what was needed was to increase
salary, do away with honoraria and start a reform movement here.''
   While House members are still eligible to keep $26,850 in
honoraria, the question of outside fees has been bucked to a new
bipartisan panel co-chaired by Fazio and Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill.
Lawmakers say there's no chance the House or the Senate _ where
members can retain $35,800 in honoraria _ will give up the system
without a raise, since that would amount to a pay cut.
   Still simmering is the issue of raises for judges and top federal
executives.
   Congress' rejection of its own increase prevented raises for:
1,100 judges; 834 top executive branch appointed officials; 7,000
career federal managers, 12,000 foreign service officers and 155
generals and admirals.
   Coelho told colleagues just before the rejection, ``We are voting
to continue the exodus of judges, top-level managers, and yes,
creative members of Congress from government service to the private
sector.''
   Lawmakers have shown little interest in resurrecting these pay
raises without considering their own.
   ``I don't think it's a sound idea, because of the branches being
equal,'' said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., and chairman of the
House Post Office civil service subcommittee. ``The forefathers
didn't say we should have a lower branch.''
   A survey by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts
concluded 20 of the last 26 judges to leave the federal bench said
pay was a factor in their resignations.
   From 1958-73, six federal judges resigned from the lifetime
position, compared to 60 from 1974 to 1978. The loss in real salary
due to inflation has totaled 30 percent for U.S. judges since 1969,
the office said.
   Here are other unresolved issues from the pay raise dispute,
which the bipartisan House ethics panel may consider:
   _Expenses. Members of Congress invited to make a speech can wind
up with a stay in a posh resort, courtesy of special interests. The
panel must decide whether to follow the lead of bipartisan House
negotiators, whose ill-fated honoraria reform package would likely
have placed time limits on trips for a single speech.
   _Non-honoraria income. The House proposal would have: limited all
outside income to 15 percent of salary; prohibited affiliation with
business entities for compensation; prevented members from
practicing a profession, except part-time teaching; and banned
members from serving as an officer or board member on a publicly
held regulated corporation. The prohibitions on business and
professional affiliations are already in Senate rules.
   A separate Wright-appointed panel on campaign finance reform will
consider whether to eliminate the ``grandfather clause'' loophole in
federal law.
   The provision allows House members, in office before 1980, to
convert leftover campaign cash to personal use. The House reform
package would have ended this loophole in 1991, allowing any member
holding leftover cash to retire with the money after this term.
   But anyone running again would have limited options, including
giving to campaigns of others, donating the money to charity, or
returning it to those who made the contributions.

   The Rev. Barbara Harris, an Episcopal priest from
Philadelphia, today became the first female bishop in any major
branch of Christendom that traces it leadership back 2,000 years to
the time of Christ.
   Harris was consecrated as suffragan, or assistant, Episcopal
bishop for the Boston Episcopal diocese, a relatively obscure
position that has drawn world attention because of her gender,
background and liberal views.
   A large number of bishops attended the stately ceremony at Hynes
Veteran Memorial Auditorium, and 2,000 clergy members, lay leaders,
ecumenical representatives and civic dignitaries marched in
procession.
   The chief consecrator was the Most Rev. Edmond Browning,
presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States.
   ``Just say I'm very proud and very happy. That's all,'' said
Harris' mother, Beatrice Harris.
   ``This is something that people feel very right about, very
convicted about,'' said the Rev. Gerald Porter, an Episcopal priest
and the master of ceremony. ``And we feel very blessed that we have
been chosen to lead the church in new ways.''
   Harris was greeted by a burst of applause as she walked down the
aisle, but there was some protest raised to the consecration.
   John Jamieson of Evanston, Ill., chairman of the conservative
Prayer Book Society's Chicago chapter, spoke during the time
allotted for any protest.
   ``Bishop Browning, please weigh the consequences. By proceeding
with this pretended consecration you will perpetuate a sacrilegious
imposture, you will abandon the communion of all those churches
descended from the Church of England and you will destroy the
concept of legality in the Episcopal Church,'' Jamieson said.
   Browning responded by saying that such objections had been raised
in advance but that the consecration was in accordance with church
laws. The audience roared its approval and gave him a standing
ovation.
   The congregation thundered out its approval after Browning asked,
``Is it your will that Barbara be ordained a bishop?''
   Harris became the first female bishop in a branch of Christianity
that believes in apostolic succession _ that its leaders are
descended from Christ's apostles. Among such denominations are the
Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox churches and the worldwide
Anglican Communion, which includes the Episcopal Church.
   While her appointment was opposed by some religious leaders
because of her gender, Harris has generated controversy for other
reasons. She is divorced, lacks a college or seminary degree and is
politically outspoken.
   In her writings, Harris has not been shy about blasting
conservatives in the church she has been designated to help lead.
   In an article last April in a liberal church publication, The
Witness, the 58-year-old priest took aim at the conservative church
Prayer Book Society and the group's plan to monitor votes by liberal
clergy members at an Episcopal convention.
   Her writings served to fan the controversy surrounding her
election last September.
   The Rev. Jerome Politzer of the conservative Prayer Book Society
put it bluntly Friday: ``A bishop is to be a disciple of Jesus
Christ, not Karl Marx. Her hard-line leftist position is not a
moderating, reconciling position.''
   Auburn Traycik, editor of The Christian Challenge, a conservative
Episcopal publication, said she objected more to the style than the
content of Harris' writings.
   ``A lot of her stuff shows a distinct lack of charity, a kind of
unseemliness,'' Traycik said. The Christian Challenge published a
lengthy article in December detailing some of what the paper's
editors believed were Harris' more objectionable writings.
   Among others, the publication found unacceptable Harris'
description of the Prayer Book Society as ``divisive, defiant,
deleterious and demonic ...''
   But not all the targets of Harris' pointed pen take issue with
her selection.
   Bishop Alden Hathaway of Pittsburgh represents Episcopalians
United for Renewal, Revelation and Reformation, referred to by
Harris as ``the new 3-R bunch.'' Hathaway said he voted in support
of Harris' election.
   ``She'll bring a very peppery perspective,'' Hathaway said. ``I'm
sure that in the house of bishops we're going to be on the opposite
sides of a lot of issues. I have met her and I liked her. I wish her
well.''

   Congress cut off military aid to Nicaragua's
rebels a year ago, and the stranded guerrilla army is marking time
at bases in Honduras. Two AP journalists spent four days at Contra
camps. Here is a report.

   A year after the U.S. Congress cut off
military aid to Nicaraguan rebels, the guerrilla army created with
U.S. assistance is stranded in an isolated mountain valley without
the means to fight.
   Its men are keeping up their morale with intense training as they
listen to the news on the radio and wonder what President Bush's
policy will be.
   ``If the U.S. doesn't help us, we'll go back to the early days,
taking our guns from the `piricuacos,''' said Contra fighter Donal
Severano, using camp slang meaning ``armed dogs'' for Nicaragua's
Sandinista army.
   Far from Contra directorate members in Tegucigalpa or Miami, far
from the policy considerations of Washington, the guerrillas are
aware of what they call ``the situation'' that began when Congress
cut off military aid Feb. 3, 1988.
   Contra troops began to move out of Nicaragua as their supplies
dwindled, most of them withdrawing to their main base here along the
Yamales River, about 10 miles inside Honduras.
   Although they continue be optimistic about prospects for aid, few
do not know that Bush's emphasis on ``bipartisanship'' and
cooperation with the Democratic majority in Congress may be a death
knell to hopes for renewal.
   Few appear disposed to quit.
   ``(Nicaraguan President) Daniel Ortega says we are a cadaver
waiting to be buried. Well, here are 11,000 `cadavers,' alive,''
said Comandante Jackson, a member of the general staff who doesn't
use his real name for reasons of security and esprit de corps.
   Like many Contras, Jackson takes heart from Nicaragua's economic
crash and the cuts the leftist Sandinista government says it is
making in its defense budget.
   ``We can beat them even though they outnumber us because we're
tougher, like wood. They can't send draftees from the city after
us,'' said ``Comandante Caliman,'' a battalion leader, his two
silver-framed teeth flashing.
   Jackson and others said groups of rebels still infiltrate
Nicaragua despite a truce in effect since May, but the scale of the
fighting has been drastically reduced.
   The Contra encampment now spreads for seven miles along the
Yamales River and gets larger every day as more small groups emerge
from the jungle.
   The camps are organized by battalion, although some are beginning
to take on a settled look; many have brought wives and children from
``the inside.'' A few women work as prostitutes, others have settled
into rough wartime relationships.
   ``The movement is reinforcing itself,'' said a fighter nicknamed
``Penguin.'' A doctor said nearly 600 children were born in the camp
last year.
   The articulate talk idealistically about why they fight; others
can say no more than that they left ``because the piricuacos came.''
   A few, generally among the higher ranking, were members of former
Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza's army and fought ``from day
one.''
   But there are also bricklayers, ranch workers, truckers, doctors,
sharecroppers who joined when the Sandinista government tried to
force them into a cooperative.
   Some said a brother or father was arrested or tortured, and there
are those who took the opportunity to shed abusive parents, family
problems or a criminal past.
   They give themselves nicknames like ``Lightning,''
``Point-Blank,'' ``Leopard,'' and ``Rambo,'' sometimes known as
``Gordo'' behind his back; but also ``Rabbit'' and ``Quetzal,'' an
ancient Indian god of the air.
   Roberto Martinez, ``Comandante Nolan,'' keeps his 700 men in
shape with volleyball, boxing, marches and extra drills, ``what
little we guerrillas know,'' he said apologetically as about 50
recruits executed a sloppy maneuver.
   Martinez, at 23, twice wounded, is less than half the age of some
of the men he commands. ``All that matters here is ability and
leadership,'' he said.
   Armed guards are posted 24 hours a day, patrols move through the
hills, and combat discipline is observed on trails _ marchers spread
out to prevent casualties, with a rear guard yards behind.
   Last week there was a brief firefight with leftist Honduran
guerrillas, officers said, and there is always the danger of
Sandinista infiltrators seeking intelligence.
   Most men live in 10-by-6-foot huts with camouflage plastic roofs
and walls, although some have built straw or wood walls and even
small mud-and-wood houses.
   ``Some guys are architects,'' said Julio Vargas Cruz, known as
``Hunter.'' He sticks to plastic, although it gets too hot in the
sun.
   The most permanent structures are at CIM, Spanish initials for
the Center for Military Instruction.
   CIM, pronounced ``seem,'' is a two-hour hike from the main camp
across a jungle mountain trail three feet deep in mud when it rains.
   Here, even as about 600 men took tests in map reading and
military tactics to qualify as officers, others worked on wooden
buildings with tin roofs so that classes would not have to be held
outdoors or under ponchos.
   ``We are not wasting our time here. We are preparing ourselves
during this pause in the war,'' an instructor told about 40 officer
candidates in an open tent.
   A kitchen turns out 900 handmade tortillas a day; there's also a
small slaughterhouse and a pit with a barbed wire grill big enough
to barbecue four sides of beef.
   Some of the beef is sold by local Hondurans at about $233 a head.
Honduran merchants peddle everything from dandruff shampoo to cowboy
boots. Baby clothes and underwear are big sellers.
   But there also are complaints ranging from drunken driving to
rape, although most confess there is much less thievery and lack of
discipline than they thought there would be.
   ``You know that when somebody kills somebody down here, all he
has to do is join the Contra and he's safe,'' said Ramon Valladares,
whose son just opened a tire repair store in Danli, 55 miles from
the Contra camp and the nearest large town.
   The trucks Valentin Valladares services are carrying food paid
for by a U.S. humanitarian aid program that provides a monotonous
but steady diet of beans, rice and tortillas, with occasional meat.
   Some officers worry about the camp's children. Boys above the age
of about 10 work as camp aides; girls work in the kitchens, as do
most of their mothers.
   ``We would like to have AID (the U.S. Agency for International
Development) give us some pencils, chalk and blackboards so we can
start schools for the kids and for the illiterate,'' said battalion
commander Caliman.
   Caliman, like most others, said he plans to return to his former
job ``when we win the war, assuming I'm not dead.'' In his case,
sharecropping with coffee-picking in season.
   ``19,'' who refused to explain his nickname, was among the less
hopeful. He made cigar boxes in Nicaragua, loved his work and tried
to find work at the Plasencia cigar factory in Honduras.
   ``But you need a Honduran ID and a work permit, and the Honduran
unions are tough,'' he said. ``I'm over 50 and I can't fight
anymore, but I'll go on because I have to.''
   His attitude is an exception to the determination expressed by
most.
   ``When I started there was no thought we would ever get aid from
the United States,'' said Adan de Jesus Vargas Garcia.
   Known as Commandante Javier, he brought 30 men, three women and
15 children out of Nicaragua last week ``because I didn't have
anything left to fight with.'' His wife was wounded in the foot
during the trip.
   ``With or without help,'' said the former small-time cattle
dealer, ``we'll go on fighting.''

<TEXT>
   L. William Seidman, a tough-talking bank
regulator who looks a little like Daddy Warbucks, is braced for his
good name to get splattered quickly now that President Bush has made
him deposit insurance czar and plopped the savings and loan crisis
in his lap.
   In more than three years at the helm of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., which backs commercial bank deposits, Seidman, 67,
has acquired a reputation as a straight shooter.
   When his agency announces good news such as a jump in bank
profits, he's more likely to focus on negatives, such as an uptick
in bad loans in the Northeast or banks' growing dependence on
leveraged buyouts.
   Over the past year, congressional committees, unhappy with what
they viewed as overly-rosy estimates from S&amp;L regulators at the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, increasingly have turned to Seidman
for information about savings and loans, even though they weren't
under his jurisdiction.
   ``His personality is very blunt. He's a no-nonsense guy and he
doesn't mince words,'' said Robert Litan, a banking expert at the
Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. ``I think a lot of
politicians appreciate that.''
   ``Seidman is an old hand and has the confidence of people in
Washington,'' explained Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of
the House Banking Committee. ``And he's been right on the issue.
Unlike the bank board he has not had to change his tune every few
months.''
   Although Seidman has presided over the worst three years for bank
failures since the Depression, he also has had two important
advantages not enjoyed by M. Danny Wall, his counterpart for S&amp;Ls: a
large, experienced staff that had escaped Reagan-era budget cuts,
and a solvent insurance fund.
   Now that Seidman, under Bush's plan to resolve the savings and
loan crisis, gets actual, not just defacto, authority over S&amp;Ls, he
may be in for tougher times.
   Many people, including the FDIC chairman himself, think the era
of good feelings could quickly end as the FDIC wrestles with the
intractable thrift problem.
   ``I think you will shortly be doing a story on this guy's the
most inept, mud-covered regulator we've ever seen. How could we have
ever thought he's reasonably good,'' Seidman, a short, nearly-bald,
craggy-featured man, predicted in a recent interview.
   Commercial banking, despite all the failures, is relatively
healthy, posting record high earnings last year. The savings
industry, by any measure, is ailing. About 350 of the 3,000 S&amp;Ls in
the nation are insolvent. The business lost more money in 1988 than
at any time in 50 years. And, only one in four institutions now have
enough money invested by their owners to meet the stricter capital
standards Bush's plan would require in two years.
   ``We're going ... into a very difficult situation to which every
answer will be painful ... and which contains all kinds of booby
traps and not many rewards,'' Seidman said. ``There aren't going to
be any miracles.''
   Others aren't as pessimistic, at least about the prospects for
Seidman's reputation.
   ``Seidman is coming in at the right time,'' said former Senate
Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire, who retired this year
after 30 years in the Senate. ``People realize S&amp;Ls are in horrible
shape. ... It's like coming in to coach a football team that has had
a disastrous season. ... If he wins three or four games, he's a
genius.''
   Some in Washington think Seidman is already a genius for having
doubled his power and simultaneously protected the bank insurance
fund from being raided to pay for S&amp;L problems.
   When asked, in the months leading up to the announcement of
Bush's S&amp;L proposal, whether he wanted jurisdiction over thrift
institutions, Seidman had a stock answer, ``We prefer to go it
alone, but we're willing to help if asked.''
   Even now he insists, ``It was not a job we wanted. We never asked
for it. ... There was no hidden agenda for us to end up where we are
now.''
   But, a senior bank board official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said, ``He had a very good set of cards and he played
them very well.''
   ``In a city where turf is your measure of success, he's very
quietly amassing a very big one and very coyly as well,'' said
Barton Naylor, a former Senate Banking Committee aide, now on the
staff of the Investor Responsibility Research Center.
   Seidman's strong suit in the struggle has been his long-standing
ties to the Republican establishment dating back to the
administration of Gerald Ford, a boyhood friend from Grand Rapids,
Mich.
   When Ford became president, he hired Seidman, head of a
family-owned accounting firm, to be a White House assistant for
economic affairs.
   It was Seidman who interviewed Alan Greenspan, now chairman of
the Federal Reserve Board, to determine whether Ford should nominate
the economist as chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers.
   During the Ford years, Seidman worked closely with James A. Baker
III, then an assistant secretary of commerce, and with Richard
Darman, then a young Baker aide. That's the same Baker who is
secretary of state now, the same Darman who is head of the Office of
Management and Budget. Seidman traveled often to Langley, Va., to
review Central Intelligence Agency economic reports with George
Bush, then CIA director.
   He has known Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas Brady for 30
years.
   ``Darman called me up the other day and said, `Now that you've
got all your proteges in office, what are you going to do?'''
Seidman said. ``I said, `I'm going to retire and enjoy it.'''
   But that won't be until the administration's S&amp;L program is well
under way, he said.
   Another asset that helps Seidman win over Democrats is his
pragmatism, according to Kenneth Guenther of the Independent Bankers
Association of America.
   ``He's been around the block four of five times. ... He's not an
ideologue,'' Guenther said.
   That's obvious from Seidman's successful effort to block several
S&amp;L proposals pushed by Bush's more conservative advisers.
   When word of the Treasury Department's proposal to impose a
direct fee on depositors leaked, Seidman dubbed it ``the reverse
toaster plan. Instead of getting a toaster when you open an account,
you give them one.''
   The remark reportedly infuriated White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu, but Seidman isn't apologetic.
   ``I wasn't trying to be obstreperous. On the other hand, I did
think it was a very bad idea and I thought it might be better to try
to deal with it with humor rather than analysis,'' he said.
   Seidman also is fighting an idea, advocated by Greenspan and
others, that lowering the $100,000 deposit insurance limit would
give bank and S&amp;L customers incentive to make sure their
institutions are soundly managed.
   Bush wants the Treasury Department to study the issue for a year.
   ``Who in the world wants to get people thinking in a public way
that they're going to change deposit insurance?'' Seidman asked.

   To the public, Nancy Klein is a
silent victim, a comatose woman who was at the center of a highly
publicized legal whirlwind over whether her husband could order an
abortion.
   But to her friends and family she is outgoing, a fashion
designer, a gourmet cook, a model mother who wouldn't welcome the
publicity.
   ``It's very frustrating not being able to tell Nancy about all of
this,'' said her husband, Martin, as he tried to avoid hordes of
television camera crews and reporters outside court. ``She just
wouldn't believe this.''
   Nancy Klein, 32, lost consciousness on Dec. 13 when her car
skidded on snow and was struck by an oncoming car. She suffered
massive brain damage.
   Doctors told her husband of nine years, a 34-year-old accountant,
that she stood a better chance of surviving if the fetus she was
carrying was aborted. Klein went to court to be named her guardian
so he could arrange an abortion.
   Guardianship was granted, but abortion opponents challenged the
ruling, delaying the procedure by appeals. On Friday, the Court of
Appeals, the state's highest court, refused to hear the case and
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall did the same.
   Early Saturday, the abortion was performed on Mrs. Klein, who
friends said would be mortified if she knew of the attention paid to
her case.
   ``We were uncomfortable at first going to her hospital room when
we heard she was in the accident,'' said Nat Borg, a close friend.
``We knew she would be embarrassed to have people see her that way.''
   She was described as the first to help out, slow to anger, an
eager hostess.
   ``You could drop in for a surprise visit at 11 o'clock at
night,'' Borg recalls. ``Nancy would pull out an unbelievable spread
of food from the refrigerator _ gourmet dishes which she had made
herself.''
   Nancy Klein worked as a freelance textile designer, designing
embroidered patterns. Most of her designs were for expensive silk
blouses made by major manufacturers.
   ``During certain seasons she would spend weeks at a time running
into Manhattan to meet with clients,'' Klein said.
   Mostly, she spent time with the couple's 3-year-old daughter,
Arielle.
   ``They would bake brownies and sit for hours together in Nancy's
art studio drawing puppets and pictures,'' said a friend, Jodie
Kleinman.
   ``She would dress Arielle up in outfits that she'd make prettier
by painting pictures on a blouse or sticking rhinestone designs
on,'' she said.
   She cooks _ ``quiches, breads, pastry _ everything was made from
scratch,'' said Mrs. Kleinman _ and decorates the family home.
   She sends balloons to friends on birthdays, devises ways to cheer
others when they are down.
   Last year, as a birthday present for Jodie Kleinman's husband,
Alan, Mrs. Klein took him breakfast in bed.
   ``We couldn't believe it,'' Mrs. Kleinman said. ``She came with
Arielle real early in the morning with a beautifully decorated tray
with an outrageous feast she had prepared.''
   Her friends wish they could turn the clock back, Borg said.
   ``She was so full of life,'' Mrs. Kleinman said.

   Iran's main rebel group says it has the
military might to overthrow Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
government, but analysts dismiss the claim and say the insurgents'
latest raid severely damaged their cause.
   Hussein Mahdavi, a senior official of the Iraqi-based Mujahedeen
Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, would not say how long it might
take to overthrow Iran's Islamic fundamentalist government, which is
celebrating its 10th anniversary.
   ``If you look at the divisions ... inside the Khomeini regime,
and compare it to the resistance ready at any time to overthrow the
regime, you cannot seriously speak about needing years,'' he said in
a recent interview with The Associated Press. ``We've shown that we
have the ability to militarily overthrow this regime.''
   The Mujahedeen's military arm, the National Liberation Army, made
a large-scale incursion into western Iran just before the Aug. 20
cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war.
   The rebels still hand out literature by the pound claiming the
raid, called Eternal Light, was a major victory, but diplomats say
Khomeini's Revolutionary Guards soundly beat the insurgents.
   The Mujahedeen is believed to have no more than 15,000 fighters,
and it admits losing 1,000 in the raid. In addition, thousands of
their supporters in Iran were arrested and many were believed
executed.
   Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Eternal Light
undermined whatever support the rebels had in Iran.
   Talk of overthrowing Khomeini is ``sheer dreaming and sheer
stupidity'' said one Western military analyst, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``What could they do? Where would they go?
They got destroyed in the Eternal Light operation.''
   Much of Iran's civilian population has been moved away from the
border during the Iran-Iraq war, so capturing territory would be a
limited threat to the government, analysts said.
   They argued that since the million-strong, high-tech Iraqi army
could not overwhelm the Iranians in eight years of war, it is highly
unlikely the rebels could.
   Even if the rebels did have an army ready to cross the border,
the analysts said, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein appears committed
to peace negotiations and probably would not allow the insurgents to
attack.
   Iraqi officials declined to comment on the Mujahedeen's future.
   ``Everything on those issues will be dependent on Iranian
behavior,'' said deputy Foreign Minister Nizar Hamdoon. ``It's
premature to address this point at the moment.''
   The Mujahedeen appear to have broad support in Iraq. They still
broadcast a nightly half-hour television program and one diplomat
noted the post office box listed on their official paper is the same
used by the Culture and Information Ministry.
   But Iraq has expelled Iranian resistance groups before. Khomeini
himself spent 15 years in the holy city of Najaf but was asked to
leave in 1978 during a moment of detente in Iran-Iraq relations.
   Mahdavi conceded a peace treaty might mean Iraq would bar the
Mujahedeen from staging military operations across the border. He
would not say if the rebels are conducting operations now.
   The Mujahedeen were allied with Khomeini in the 1979 revolution
that toppled Iran's monarchy. But the fundamentalists turned on
their liberal allies in 1981 and killed thousands in a bloody purge.
   Peace negotiations between Iran and Iraq have been stalled since
November. Mahdavi accused Iran of delaying talks because of internal
differences and said a treaty might trigger a civil war.
   ``At that time the NLA ... will embark on overthrowing the
Khomeini regime,'' Mahdavi said.

   A man who has pleaded guilty to wild animal
poaching charges kept a ledger that shows he netted about $600,000
from the illegal slaughter of hundreds of animals, including bald
eagles, officials said.
   The ledger taken from the home of Ralph J. Jackson in Sequim
indicates he poached at least 25 bald eagles and hundreds of other
wild animals, Ron Perregrin of the state Department of Wildlife said
at a news conference Friday.
   Jackson, 38, was charged with poaching 13 elk in late September
after an anonymous caller told officials Jackson had an illegally
obtained polar bear skin, Perregrin said.
   Investigators never found the polar bear skin, but they
discovered illegally obtained elk and deer, and the ledger,
Perregrin said.
   Sales listed in the ledger over 3{ years include 25 eagles sold
for $512,650, 135 elk for $28,500, 286 deer for $24,270, 18 native
cats for $15,150, 12 seals for $14,500 and nine hawks for $2,775.
   The ledger also listed purchasers and the investigation
continues, Perregrin said.
   Federal authorities arrested Jackson in October after he
threatened the lives of a witness in the eagle transactions and
several investigating officers and their families, Perregrin said.
   The department has talked to many local people who knew Jackson
was a poacher, Perregrin said. But no one knew the extent of his
activities and just assumed he took a deer or two for dinner for the
family.
   Records indicate Jackson was receiving public assistance.
   Jackson pleaded guilty in Clallam and Jefferson counties to
poaching charges and was sentenced to up to 24 years in prison,
Perregrin said. He also pleaded guilty to 10 federal felony counts
of selling bald eagles and one count of threatening a federal
witness.
   He is in custody awaiting sentencing Feb. 23 on the federal
counts, and could face additional prison time and millions of
dollars in fines.
   His wife Elaine also pleaded guilty in connection with the
poaching, he said.

<HEAD>1989 Federal Deficit Grows As Budget Spotlight Shifts to 1990</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The unveiling of President Bush's 1990 spending
plan focuses the budget spotlight on the coming fiscal year _ just
as the deficit figures for this year are getting more and more
embarrassing.
   The imbalance is not only expanding like a wet blot of red ink on
a piece of paper. But once again _ as has happened every year since
the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law was passed in 1985 _ the actual
deficit is going to be far higher than the deficit ceiling the
legislation sets.
   The budget Bush presented to Congress for fiscal 1990 last
Thursday revealed that the administration now expects the 1989
deficit to be $170.2 billion. Less than four months ago, the
outgoing Reagan administration forecast that the imbalance would be
$145.5 billion _ $500 million below the $146 billion target set in
the Gramm-Rudman law.
   ``It's a co-conspiracy between Congress and the administration,''
says Rudolph G. Penner, former director of the Congressional Budget
Office. ``And it's hard to think of any other word to describe it
than dishonest.''
   Penner, now a senior fellow at The Urban Institute in Washington,
was referring to the process set in law that is designed to force
Congress and the White House to reduce the federal deficit.
   Lawmakers and the president spend most of each year dueling with
each other over the budget, with much of their battling devoted to
deciding how they will produce a spending plan that meets the
deficit target of the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law.
   Every year, the smoke clears in the fall or winter to reveal an
agreement in which the projected red ink falls just within the
deficit target. And the awesome hammer of the law _ forced spending
cuts on domestic and defense programs, totaling billions of dollars
_ is avoided.
   But the key word here is ``projected.'' The Gramm-Rudman law is a
process that deals with the projected deficit for the coming year,
setting declining ceilings for each year until the budget is
supposed to be balanced in 1993.
   If the final projection for each fiscal year _ made in
mid-October, two weeks into that year _ falls within the target, the
automatic cuts are avoided.
   But once the projected deficit is certified as falling within the
target, the law's machinery grinds to a halt. The law sets no
consequences if the actual deficit at the end of the year turns out
to be higher than the Gramm-Rudman target.
   Budget experts say the deficit projections are off because of the
difficulties of predicting how the economy will perform and how
quickly some programs will spend money.
   They say that in addition, the economic forecasts used are
optimistic and thus underestimate the magnitude of the shortfall.
After all, it's easier to pronounce the deficit smaller than it is
to say it is larger and then have to enact spending cuts and tax
increases to shrink it.
   ``They're avoiding political pain,'' said Stanley Collender, who
oversees budget policy for the Price Waterhouse accounting firm.
   Some say the way Congress and the White House focus each year on
deficit projections is such a charade that the press is partially to
blame for paying so much attention to it.
   ``We're all a little surprised that you all report that in such a
straight-faced manner,'' says Carol Cox, president of the bipartisan
watchdog group, The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
   Experts are divided over just how significant it is that the
target is consistently missed.
   Some, like Penner, say it is deceptive and postpones true
deficit-reduction decisions. Others, like Collender, say a deficit
difference of a few billion dollars in a $5 trillion economy is
relatively harmless.
   Following are the deficit targets for each fiscal year since
Gramm-Rudman took effect, and the actual deficits that occurred:
   _1986: target $171.9 billion, deficit $221 billion.
   _1987: target $144 billion, deficit $150.4 billion.
   _1988: target $144 billion, deficit $155 billion.
   Only in 1986 were automatic spending cuts triggered by the
Gramm-Rudman law.

   The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee
has been consulting with Mexican lawmakers on ways to help reduce
that country's massive foreign debt and expand its market for U.S.
farm goods.
   ``The long-term potential for the growth of the United States'
exports is greater in Mexico than in virtually any other country in
the world,'' said Rep. E. (Kika) de la Garza, D-Texas, in a recent
interview.
   The comment came following a meeting last week with three members
of Mexico's Senate.
   ``Mexico is already our third-largest trading partner in the
world and the potential for expansion of that trade is directly
proportional to our ability to foster trade in both directions,''
said de la Garza.
   De la Garza said he urged the three senators _ Mario Niebla
Alvarez, Jose de Jesus Padilla and Bulmaro Pacheco _ to weigh the
idea of a free-trade agreement with this country, similar to the
ones the United States has with Israel and Canada.
   Those agreements call for elimination of most tariffs between the
parties over the next decade.
   De la Garza said that to begin with such an accord with Mexico
could be limited to individual sectors such as automotive or
agriculture.
   He said he is also asking Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady to
consider broadening banking guidelines to permit Mexico to
capitalize part of its external debt _ a means of converting
interest on the debt into part of the loan.
   That way less cash would leave Mexico to service its $105 billion
debt, and the money could be injected into the economy to produce
additional exports, De la Garza said. He said it would generate
badly needed export income and create jobs in a country experiencing
an unemployment rate of about 20 percent.
   The money could also be used to buy more imports from the United
States and elsewhere.
   ``The economic prosperity of Mexico is in our best interests
since an economically and politically unstable Mexico might prove to
be a national security risk for the United States,'' de la Garza
said.

   A motto in Latin about grapes and the meaning of
life brought a touch of class to ``Lonesome Dove'' even if Gus
McCrae didn't know what it meant and Latin scholars have differing
interpretations.
   ``It's a motto. ... It just says itself,'' McCrae explained to
his partner, Woodrow F. Call, in Larry McMurtry's Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel.
   But that didn't satisfy the public, which has been clamoring for
an explanation ever since the book was turned into a hit CBS-TV
miniseries, broadcast last week.
   ``We got about 15 to 20 calls the day after the final episode,''
Dallas Public Library researcher Marilyn Jackson said Friday. The
four-day series wound up Wednesday.
   The motto, ``Uva uvam vivendo varia fit,'' appeared on the sign
for the Hat Creek Cattle Company and Livery Emporium. McCrae thought
that whatever it meant, it would lend some dignity to the sign.
   In the TV series, the motto also became McCrae's epitaph as Call
used the remains of the sign to mark his grave.
   Ms. Jackson said researcher Carl Perkins translated the motto as:
``The grape is made manifold by living.''
   Two Latin scholars offered different views.
   Isaac Tennison, a lecturer at the University of Texas-Arlington
,says it's ``A grape becomes mature by living only as a grape.''
   Bruce MacQueen of the University of Dallas translates it as ``A
grape becomes a different kind of grape by living _ or in the
process of living.''
   MacQueen added that the motto was improperly constructed, saying
that under Latin's complex rules for the endings of words, the
``uvam'' should be another ``uva.'' He called it ``a mistake that a
schoolboy who was learning to write Latin might make.''
   Uva or uvam, MacQueen said he was pleased with the interest in
Latin aroused by the story.
   ``We're not going to look any gift publicity in the mouth,'' he
said.

   The road signs marking a traveler's entry into
the village of Bug have bugged out twice, leaving the man who
lobbied for them _ well, bugged.
   ``Maybe I'll put them up in a tree,'' said Glynn Mann, who
successfully lobbied to have the signs installed and is now trying
to figure out how to thief-proof the next pair of green and white
Bug signs.
   Bug-loving bandits have struck twice, stealing the two signs
within a day after the state installed them last March, and then
stealing the replacements within a few days of their installation in
October.
   ``We appeared and disappeared,'' said Mann's wife, Shirley, who
indulges with good humor her husband's efforts to mark the central
Kentucky village of 50 about 2{ miles north of the
Kentucky-Tennessee line.
   A new set of signs has been ordered but not yet installed as Mann
ponders his next move.
   Bug got its name perhaps a century ago when some men were
standing around trying to decide what to name the new post office,
said 70-year-old Harley Jones, a lifelong resident. ``A bug crawled
across the road, and they said, `We'll call it Bug,''' Jones said.
   Another version of the story, Mann said, is that the men choosing
the name were sitting around in a general store and saw the fateful
bug crawl up the wall.

   A young man who rides in a limo and wears a
white tuxedo, top hat, red bow tie and dark sunglasses has become a
mysterious hero by handing out $50 bills to charities.
   Salvation Army employees watched in disbelief Friday as the man
gave them the money, then quietly got back into the back seat of a
gray, chauffeur-driven limousine.
   As always, the blond mystery chap made his getaway without
leaving a clue as to his identity. He left only his calling card,
reading: ``Welcome to Paradise.''
   In recent weeks, he has bestowed his largess on five charities, a
hospital, and two citizens.
   But Friday's visit to the Salvation Army was perhaps predictable.
In an article on the mystery man published Thursday in The Ocala
Star-Banner, an official there joked, ``If you find out who he is,
give him our address.''
   Mary Guzan was one of the two private citizens who've gotten $50.
   ``He tried to talk to an older couple, but they turned their back
on him and wouldn't talk to him,'' said Mrs. Guzan, who was in a
restaurant at the time. ``Then he came over and started talking to
us. He said, `I want to give you something because you were nice.'
   ``I kept the card and I haven't spent the money yet,'' she said.
``My husband thinks we should buy a tree and plant it in honor of
him.''

   Sir Rudolf Bing, who suffers from Alzheimer's
disease, could not remember when interviewed in 1988 that he had
been general manager of the Metropolitan Opera for 22 years, a
psychiatrist testified.
   ``He couldn't remember where he worked or what he did,'' Dr. Alan
Tuckman said Friday. ``He said, `I do office work,' and he mentioned
Columbia Artists Management.''
   The Vienna-born Bing, 87, retired in 1972. Columbia Artists was
booking and managing agent for Bing and the opera company.
   Tuckman's testimony came in a hearing in which Bing's lawyers
contend that his marriage to Carroll Douglass should be annulled
because Bing was incompetent and had no idea of what he was doing
when he got married.
   Tuckman, forensic psychiatrist for Rockland County and a
professor at New York University, testified in state Supreme Court
that Bing did not recall being married. His condition is
irreversible, Tuckman said.
   Bing married Douglass, 50, on Jan. 9, 1987, in a civil ceremony
in Arlington, Va.
   ``I cannot believe Sir Rudolph could have the ability to
understand what was happening,'' Tuckman said. ``Sir Rudolph could
not understand things that were happening to him within minutes of
their happening.''

   Former basketball coach Dana Kirk, who fell
from grace after leading Memphis State into the national rankings,
has been sentenced to a year in prison for tax evasion and
obstruction of justice.
   ``Nobody knows how much I've been punished. I love that game of
basketball,'' Kirk told a federal judge Friday in asking for
community service work instead of jail time.
   His request was denied and he also was fined $20,000, assessed
prosecution costs for his two-month trial and ordered to serve three
years' probation after he is released from prison.
   He also must pay penalties and back taxes the Internal Revenue
Service says he owes.
   At an hourlong sentencing hearing before U.S. District Judge
Odell Horton, Kirk, 53, apologized for not paying enough attention
to his taxes but continued to claim he did not intend to break the
law.
   ``I just got so involved in my job,'' he said.
   Kirk was fired from Memphis State in 1986 shortly before he was
indicted. He was convicted in November on five counts of a
nine-count indictment.
   During the trial, Kirk was described as a wheeler-dealer who
swelled his annual income from his coach's salary of $62,500 or less
to up to $300,000.
   Witnesses accused him of demanding payments from basketball
tournament promoters, collecting money to pass along to players and
selling basketball tickets.
   Horton did not set a date for Kirk to report to prison, and the
former coach said he still is considering an appeal.

Alabama is hoping to get his stolen electric fiddle back, no

   A security guard at Middle Tennessee State University saw someone
walking out of the backstage area with the red instrument Feb. 3, a
spokesman for the band said. The person did not seem suspicious and
no one questioned him about what he was doing.

   Fans love rock acts such as Sting and
U2. But when love turns to litigation, the stars turn to Walter
Howell.
   Sting and U2 are among several rock acts whose tours are insured
by Howell's company, Birmingham-based W.R. Howell &amp; Associates. The
company also insured last year's Amnesty International tour
headlined by Bruce Springsteen, Tracy Chapman and Peter Gabriel.
   ``Twenty years ago, it was unheard-of for a fan to sue,'' said
Howell, 57. ``But today, that's simply not true. People are more
willing to sue.''
   Howell &amp; Associates had revenues of $8 million in 1988. Costs of
insuring tours vary, depending upon factors such as the number of
stops, Howell said.
   The average rock tour results in five to 10 claims, with the
usual claim seeking up to a few thousand dollars for such things as
tripping and falling when lights are turned low.
   Howell said he attends about 100 concerts a year and estimated
his company is involved with 7,500 to 10,000 concerts a year.
   ``I guess I have to like rock 'n' roll,'' he said, adding he
still has an ear for opera and Frank Sinatra.

   The oldest daughter of civil rights activist
Malcolm X stood on her father's birth site for the first time, later
saying that on her flight to Omaha she was touched and felt that her
father was near.
   Attallah Shabazz visited Omaha to talk about the side of her
father that the news media and public rarely saw, she said.
   Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little on May 19, 1925. People often
called him a militant, conjuring negative images of him, Ms. Shabazz
said Friday.
   But by the time he died in New York City in 1965, the victim of
an assassin's bullet, he had become a civil rights and human rights
leader for mankind, not just for black people, she said.
   Malcolm X's birthplace more recently had been a vacant lot. It
now has the first Nebraska state historical marker honoring a black
person, dedicated in 1987.
   Ms. Shabbazz said she was too young to fully realize her father's
rolein history or the impact he had internationally until she was in
college.
   ``I had to learn about him like any other student,'' she said.

   Federal authorities should expand tough new
anti-terrorism measures to cover foreign air carriers with landing
rights in the United States, says the chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said in a letter to Transportation
Secretary Samuel K. Skinner released Saturday he was ``dismayed''
that emergency security precautions taken after the holiday bombing
of Pan Am Flight 103 apply only to domestic carriers with
international flights.
   ``I do not think it requires a quantum leap in logic to conclude
that as it becomes more difficult to penetrate the security of U.S.
flag carriers because of their superior security systems, the
terrorist threat may well shift to foreign air carriers which carry
a large number of American passengers,'' Bentsen said.
   About half of Americans traveling abroad fly on foreign carriers,
he said.
   ``If the primary basis for the emergency rulemaking is to
minimize terrorism aimed at Americans particularly and the
international traveling public generally, then I do not see how it
is accomplished by a blanket exemption to foreign air carriers to
the requirement for improved security operations,'' Bentsen said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration in late December announced
tightened security procedures by U.S. air carriers at 103 airports
in the Middle East and Western Europe, including X-ray or physical
inspection of all checked baggage and random physical checks of some
carry-on baggage.
   The added measures were prompted by the bombing of Flight 103
over Scotland, which 270 persons dead.
   Bentsen said the measures did not go far enough.
   ``The problem is that they (FAA) offered a half a loaf and half a
loaf is just not good enough when you're talking about terrorism,''
Bentsen said.
   Bentsen said he was also urging Skinner to have the FAA
coordinate its activities with the intelligence community in
tracking terrorist activity and guarding against sabotage.
   Skinner will head a U.S. delegation to a special session of the
Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization on
Wednesday and Thursday in Montreal, where protecting aviation from
terrorists will be discussed.
   The Transportation Department said the meeting's primary purpose
will be to improve the council's international standards on
passengers, baggage and cargo security related to sabotage. The
group will also consider how standard security measures might to
expanded and applied uniformly to operations considered to be at
high risk of sabotage.

   There's barely a decimal point's difference
between the Reagan and Bush budgets. But President Bush's plan is
packaged to make the changes he's made look more dramatic.
   He tries to put the most shine on the least shoe _ to reflect
toward Congress and the American people the things they want to see
_ by following the time-honored Washington tradition of jumbling the
numbers.
   On the one hand, Bush's kinder and gentler budget includes
freezing the military budget, a sharp departure from the growth
advocated by Reagan. He defines the Pentagon freeze as increasing
spending $2.1 billion to keep pace with inflation _ a so-called
``current services'' freeze.
   But elsewhere in his budget, he ridicules the concept of
maintaining current services as defining a freeze. Assuming
adjustments to cover inflationary costs in domestic programs is
``wonderland budgeting,'' he says.
   His budget compares the domestic budgets with current fiscal 1989
levels, without mention of what providing the same services would
cost next year. This approach allows Bush to minimize the appearance
of cuts and maximize the apparent increases in his fiscal 1990 plan.
   In sum, increasing Pentagon spending with inflation is a freeze
in the Bush budget. Increasing the education budget, but not enough
to maintain current services, is not a freeze.
   Along the same lines, the president studiously avoids direct
comparisons with Reagan's spending plan.
   He claims with some fanfare initiatives to increase spending on
AIDS research and the space program. Compared to Reagan, there's no
increase at all. But the Reagan numbers aren't in Bush's book. You
have to go to another document to find them.
   Further complicating any comparisons with his predecessor, Bush's
budget drafters calculated his figures without the credit reforms
that Reagan included in his accounting. That technical difference
makes some of Bush's numbers look hundreds of millions of dollars
different from Reagan's when, in many cases, they are exactly the
same.
   In the case of fighting drugs, Bush's new spending initiative
isn't so new. Three quarters of the nearly $1 billion Bush claims as
his anti-drug program is money already approved by Congress.
   Mostly, the Bush budget as revealed so far is incomplete.
   Bush explicitly changes only about four dozen out of some 4,000
line items in the budget left behind by his predecessor.
   It claims to be increasing spending on important domestic
programs, but often lists them within a group where the total
spending is unchanged from Reagan's plan. It doesn't say what other
programs in that group would go down to compensate, or by how much.
   Budget director Richard Darman said Thursday that Bush was
rejecting Reagan's plan to reduce school lunch programs by $800
million. That change from the Reagan plan is nowhere in the budget
document he released, and there's no indication where the spending
would be cut to make up the difference.
   Darman says the administration is projecting about $9.6 billion
in total savings from hundreds of programs placed in a so-called
flexible freeze box _ with Congress to take a lead role in deciding
which individual programs to cut, which to increase and which to
keep static. Other analysts say the administration seems to be
counting on about $11 billion in savings from that ``box'' approach.
   But spelling out the billions of dollars in cuts implicit in the
plan would give more ammunition to critics on Capitol Hill and
elsewhere. It would dull the shine.

   Candlelight dinners and cool winter
evenings may sound romantic, but some residents of this city would
give almost anything to turn the lights on over a hot meal.
   Five days after an ice storm robbed an estimated 80,000
Mississippi Power &amp; Light customers of electricity, about 10,100
were still without power late Friday. Repair crews continued to work
Saturday.
   Jean and Tom King were waiting for MP&amp;L officials to reattach
their power lines that were felled in the storm.
   ``They say they have filled out work orders for us, and that's as
far as they've gotten,'' Mrs. King said.
   ``I have gas bathroom heaters and another gas heater,'' she said.
``Do you know of a TV that runs on gas?''
   Most highs statewide were only in the 30s for most of the week,
and lows were in the 20s with wind chill factors in the teens.
Temperatures Saturday warmed up into the 50s and 60s.
   Power had been restored to most of the other homes on the Kings'
street.
   Both the Kings and neighbor Charlotte Runnelses said they had
their electric meters reattached at their own cost and were just
waiting for the power company to do its part.
   ``I'm very unhappy with MP&amp;L,'' Runnels said. ``I'm not going to
pay my bill until it's late.''
   Public Service Commissioner chairman Nielsen Cochran met with
MP&amp;L officials for almost two hours Friday to discuss the utility's
alleged trouble in communicating with customers and restoring
service.
   ``I think the most critical area which I emphasized numerous
times this afternoon was that I thought their attempt to notify the
public as to the status of the service and their efforts to repair
customer service was totally inadequate,'' Cochran said.
   But MP&amp;L spokesman Jim Moore said an estimated 1,350 power
company workers _ some of them from Alabama, Arkansas, and Louisiana
_ were working on repairs.
   ``An ice storm is like a tornado. It's like a flood,'' Moore
said. ``There's only so much you can humanly do.''

   The Justice Department today appealed to the
Supreme Court to delay Oliver North's trial out of concern the
former White House aide will disclose too much classified
information in his defense.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh submitted the appeal to the high
court after a federal appeals court panel for the second time in two
days rejected the department's bid to delay the proceedings.
   The appeal to the Supreme Court said North ``is in a position to
disclose highly sensitive classified information at trial, and it
appears that the government will not be accorded its ... procedural
rights.
   ``Proceeding with the trial on those terms will make it
impossible for the attorney general to fulfill his responsibility to
safeguard classified information,'' the appeal said.
   Thornburgh said Friday that U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell
has failed to impose stringent enough controls on what classified
material North may use at trial on charges stemming from the
Iran-Contra affair.
   A jury in the case was chosen Thursday and Gesell asked them to
return to court Monday morning.
   ``Unfortunately, the judge in this case has chosen not to follow
the provisions'' of the Classified Information Procedures Act,
Thornburgh said.
   In a 14-page appeals court filing, the Justice Department said
``the extraordinary developments in this proceeding that have
transpired over the past few days are the consequence of'' Gesell's
``repeated refusal'' to follow the pre-trial procedures set out
under CIPA.
   CIPA sets up screening procedures for use of classified material
in criminal cases.
   The attorney general also criticized independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh, who is prosecuting North, for opposing the Justice
Department's effort to delay the case.
   ``I don't understand why the independent counsel doesn't share
with the Department of Justice the desire to see that the law that
Congress passed is followed,'' Thornburgh said in an interview with
reporters and editors of Knight-Ridder Newspapers. ``I cannot
explain it.''
   The Justice Department court filing said ``decisions about the
disclosure of national security information fall well beyond the
immediate concerns of an individual prosecutor whose interests are
confined by the desire to prosecute a particular case.''
   Until Wednesday, Walsh and the Justice Department had been
cooperating in trying to overcome the problems classified material
is presenting in the case.
   In a Jan. 19 order under CIPA, Gesell said that North may use
classified material that tends to show that his intent and purpose
was not to violate the law. Another section of the order allows
North to use classified material to show that a statement made by a
government witness during the trial is false or misleading.
Intelligence agencies felt this gave North too much leeway to
present classified material in the courtroom.
   Gesell later rejected a government request to set up a mechanism
by which North's lawyers would be required to provide advance notice
or obtain an order from the court before disclosing classified
information.
   The department on Wednesday began seeking a court order barring
North from disclosing any classified information to which the U.S.
government has an objection pending.
   In rejecting the department's request, the three-member panel of
the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia noted that
the legal avenue left open to Thornburgh is to file an affidavit
under CIPA declaring that certain classified information could harm
national security.
   Such a step could lead to dismissal of at least some of the
criminal charges against North, and to possibly throwing out the
entire case.
   Once the attorney general files an affidavit, Gesell would be
required to order that North not disclose that classified material
which is at issue.
   Such a procedure could force dismissal of some or all of the 12
criminal charges against North because he would be unable to
introduce evidence that would prove him innocent.

<HEAD>Canadians Want Specifics on Acid Rain Promise</HEAD>

   Running under Canadian satisfaction with President
Bush's promise to act on acid rain is a bitter current that says,
``It's about time.''
   There also is considerable reluctance to get too complacent until
specifics of Bush's program are known.
   On Bush's first trip outside the United States since his
inauguration, he promised Friday to move quickly with congressional
legislation to control acid rain.
   He also said after his meetings with Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney that the United States would move toward discussions with
Canada for an accord on the controversial issue.
   ``The president's comments on the subject mark a small step
forward in the longstanding environmental dispute between the two
countries,'' The Globe and Mail newspaper wrote Saturday.
   ``However, without an exact U.S. timetable for the discussions,
or commitments on the amount or timing of any cuts on transborder
air pollution, Canada may still have to wait years before there is
tangible relief on the issue,'' the Toronto daily wrote in
front-page coverage of the visit.
   Canadian concern about the acid rain, blamed for killing some
14,000 lakes in the eastern part of the country and defoliating
millions of acres of forests, has been a dominant issue in relations
with the United States for the past decade.
   One of Bush's two official visits to Canada as vice president was
in January 1987, when he came to Ottawa to hear Mulroney's
complaints that the United States was holding back on acid rain
cleanup.
   Frustration grew in Canada during the eight years of the Reagan
administration, when the pomp of summit meetings produced virtually
no results on the issue.
   For example, the Reagan administration did not once propose
legislation to strengthen the U.S. federal Clean Air Act.
   More than half the acid rain in eastern Canada comes from the
United States, and in some areas U.S. emissions of sulphur dioxide
and other materials cause 70 percent of acid fallout, according to
the Canadian government.
   The program to control Canadian emissions takes full effect in
1994.
   ``I think Mr. Bush's approach is a 180-degree reversal in U.S.
policy,'' said Michael Perley of the Canadian Coalition on Acid Rain
lobbying group.
   He told reporters that while Reagan did not even recognize acid
rain as a problem, the situation now is that ``we've got the right
principle, the right approach.''
   Perley also said the specific amount of emissions to be cut and
the timetable for doing so are critical.
   Senior Canadian diplomatic officials, speaking on condition they
not be further identified, said they understand Bush's need to
outline the specifics to Congress first.
   At a joint news conference with Bush, Mulroney said the
president's position ``represents quite substantial progress. You
know, it wasn't so long ago that Canada was sort of going it alone
in many ways in this area.''
   Bush said he assured Mulroney ``that the time for just pure study
was over and that we've now approached the time for legislative
action.''
   The United States apparently would be willing to start talks for
the bilateral agreement Canada long has sought on acid rain after
the legislation is moving forward, possibly as early as this year.
   Environmental concerns ran strong among Canadian voters polled
during the campaign last fall that returned Mulroney's Progressive
Conservative Party for a second consecutive majority government.
   Indeed, Barbara Bush was reminded by a reporter as she toured the
National Gallery of Canada that lakes portrayed in the paintings she
was seeing were endangered by acid rain.

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos was
in critical but stable condition Saturday after suffering a relapse
in his bout with pneumonia and bronchial asthma, hospital officials
said.
   Marcos, 71, had been in guarded condition Friday, but began
running a fever, said Norma Kop, a spokeswoman for St. Francis
Medical Center where Marcos has been confined since Jan. 19.
   Marcos remained in the hospital's intensive care unit and was
still breathing with the aid of a respirator, according to a
statement issued Saturday morning.
   Marcos' worsened condition ``means there is infection again,''
said Gemmo Trinidad, a Marcos family spokesman. ``I would suspect
it's the lungs because of the tracheostomy.''
   A tracheostomy, a surgical incision in the trachea, was done Feb.
1 to relieve a buildup of fluid in Marcos' lungs.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, have lived here since Marcos' ouster
from power in February 1986.
   The Marcoses are under U.S. indictment for allegedly stealing
more than $100 million from their homeland and stashing much of the
money in the United States.
   Defense lawyers for Marcos asked a federal judge in New York on
Friday to remove the former president from a racketeering case for
medical reasons.
   Federal prosecutors opposed the move, saying it was too soon to
make a final prognosis of Marcos' chances for recovery.
   A continuation of a hearing by U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan
to determine whether Marcos is well enough to be arraigned in
Honolulu is scheduled for March 6.
   Marcos also has asked the administration of Philippine President
Corazon Aquino to allow him to return to his homeland to die, but
she has rejected his request.

   It was the $2,500 watch and the $13,000
Mustang that put authorities on the trail of 18-year-old Frank Riley
Wolsky.
   Investigators say the high school senior attended school
regularly while running a cocaine business on the side and spending
thousands of dollars on cars, clothes and jewelry.
   The teen-ager's fast-lane lifestyle came to a halt Jan. 18 as he
prepared to go to school in this suburb east of Portland. Undercover
police surrounded his car and arrested him on charges of possession
and delivery of a controlled substance.
   Officers found 4 ounces of cocaine, five firearms and $18,000 in
cash. Also seized was a Chevrolet Corvette, customized Ford Mustang
and a Chevrolet Blazer.
   In November 1987, when he was 16, Wolsky was arrested on a
drug-possession charge. His mother, Myra Wolsky, told authorities at
the time she thought he was a dealer, but the possession case never
went to trial.
   The Regional Organized Crime Task Force, an interagency law
enforcement group, began investigating Wolsky in earnest last year
after parents and businessmen told police about his spending sprees,
said investigator Bob Peterson.
   Reports of an $1,800 clothes-buying trip and the purchase of the
$2,500 watch crossed detectives' desks.
   ``We began looking at his activities and found that he was
purchasing vehicles for cash,'' Peterson said. ``He purchased a 1986
Mustang on Sept. 24, 10 days after his 18th birthday, for $13,000
cash.
   ``He moved into a $1,000-a-month apartment on Aug. 8. We looked
at cash expenditures of $25,000 over a one-month period,'' he said.
   ``It all began to develop a pattern not consistent with a high
school student.''
   Peterson said Wolsky did most of his business from his
third-floor apartment at Johns Landing, a trendy section of Portland
a world away from Gresham.
   Wolsky didn't use drugs himself, maintained a low profile at the
apartment and was known as a ``nice guy'' at school, Peterson said.
   ``Four or five primary customers of Wolsky's were the only ones
who came to the apartment,'' Peterson said. ``There were no wild
parties.''
   Investigators believe Wolsky was a relatively small-scale dealer
until he met Narcisa L. Savinovich, who was at the time free pending
appeal after being sentenced to five years in prison for selling
cocaine. The night before his arrest last month, Wolsky stopped at
the 26-year-old woman's house and emerged with two paper bags,
Peterson said.
   Savinovich was arrested, indicted on new drug charges, and
immediately began serving her previously imposed sentence.
   Alex Gordon, special assistant U.S. attorney, said Oregon charges
against Wolsky have been withdrawn so that he can be prosecuted in
the federal system, where stiffer sentences are possible. A federal
grand jury is considering the case.
   While the 390 other students in Wolsky's senior class dream about
life after graduation, Wolsky is keeping silent about his future.
   He has been expelled from school and is back home in Gresham,
living with his mother, a parole and probation officer with the
Oregon Department of Corrections.
   ``My lawyer advised me not to say anything at all,'' Wolsky said
over the telephone. His mother also had no comment.
   At Gresham High School, Principal Rich Correa said he thought it
was a ``farce'' that Wolsky was released after putting up $650 of
$6,500 bail after his arrest.
   Correa said rumors about Wolsky's drug trade had been circulating
for some time. ``His arrest was not a surprise,'' he said. ``He was
a shrewd student who stayed out of trouble here. But he was not your
typical student who all of a sudden gets involved with a drug
problem.''
   Peterson said he hopes Wolsky's arrest will send a message that
will deter classmates from dealing drugs, but, ``Unfortunately, the
only message they may get is don't be quite so flamboyant with your
proceeds.''
   Carri Kendall, the high school's student-body president, was
similarly pessimistic about the effect of the arrest.
   ``It will be helpful in slowing down drug dealing for a while,
but it will be a short-term effect,'' she said. ``We will graduate,
a new class will come in, and someone new will start getting rich.''

   They used to be sharecroppers, or
soldiers, or just sons and daughters. Now they call themselves
``fighters,'' ``commandos'' or ``guerrillas.''
   There are more than 11,000 of them camped in the hills of eastern
Honduras, hoping for further U.S. military aid that will allow them
to resume their fight.
   Here is a look at some of the people who make up the Contras:
   Juan Cornejo Cruz, 55, and solid as a rock. A sharecropper and
coffee-picker near Jicara in northwestern Nicaragua; Said he joined
the rebels two years ago to avoid forced recruitment into the
Sandinista reserve. Brought his wife and children out at the end of
January because ``the Sandinistas were spying on them and harassing
them, saying they were helping the commandos. Which they were.''
Proudly introduces Mari Isabel, 15; Luis Armando, 12; Maria
Mercedes, 10; Arbin Alfredo, 7; and ``the big jolly one,'' Concha,
17. They live with two other families in a cramped mud house at the
Kilali battalion camp.
   Pastor Rodriguez, 78, ``Granadillo.'' Calls himself the oldest
Contra, said he last went ``inside'' three years ago but rheumatism
prevents him from going again. He owned a coffee farm that produced
150 quintals, or about 30,000 pounds, of beans a year. Normally
jolly, he fills the air with curses as he says of the Sandinistas,
``Those dogs stole my farm.'' His six sons also joined the rebels;
one has been killed, buried in the mountains. His wife is dead.
   ``Comandante Mack,'' 38. Head of the Center for Military
Instruction and also of Contra intelligence. A man of cynical cast,
he looks much older than 38. He served in dictator Anastasio
Somoza's army and received training at the U.S. Southern Command in
Panama as well as from Argentine intelligence during a time of
severe repression. He is among the few who wear an insignia of rank.
His mottos, such as ``A leader must be clear about the values he
defends,'' decorate blackboards at the school. He has not seen his
wife and children in a year; they live in Miami.
   Jose Adan, ``Quetzal,'' 18, from Danli in Honduras. He joined the
Nicaraguan rebels because ``I felt like it.'' He was wounded in the
right hip, now his foot goes to sleep on long marches. He carries a
KRT15, a plastic version of the M-16, because it's light, but would
prefer the heavier and more powerful Belgian FAL. He was in Danli
recently but didn't visit his parents. Has a Honduran fiance in Las
Trojes, 12 miles away, and a Nicaraguan ``woman'' in the Yamales
camp. ``I'm married for a little while,'' he laughs. When the war
ends he plans to join the Salvadoran army and keep on fighting.
   Roberto Martinez, ``Comandante Nolan,'' 23, and looks like a
teen-ager. Commander of the Kilali battalion. Martinez just found
out his parents moved to New York. ``I gave up wealth for the truth
that we are now living. There's life and blood here.'' Didn't tell
his mother he'd been wounded twice. Last year he married Maria Maren
Gonzalez, a woman he met while fighting in Nicaragua. They live
together in a 10-by-6 foot hut and are trying for children. ``We're
doing our part, anyway.'' They are obviously in love.
   ``Leopard,'' 14. A go-fer at general staff headquarters, he
refuses to give his name ``for security reasons.'' Knows how to
clean a rifle with a toothbrush. Two years ago, while his family was
working as day laborers on a hacienda, he had a fight with his
father over chores; his father beat him. Next day a rebel patrol
came by and ``Leopard'' joined them. Since then his father has
joined the Sandinista army. ``My father's a piricuaco now. He'd kill
me if he found me.'' Doesn't know what he wants to do when he grows
up.
   Maria de Jesus Gonzalez, called ``Marbelit,'' 19. A cook at the
Center for Military Instruction. Left home and walked into the hills
where she met a Contra patrol because ``the Sandinistas tortured my
brother.'' A family of sharecroppers. Likes having so many men
around ``so I can make tortillas for all of them.'' Much ribald
laughter from all within earshot.
   Oscar Sanchez Castillo, 28. A former sharecropper who didn't want
to join a Sandinista cooperative, which would have prevented him
from selling much of his crop to the highest bidder. Now an officer
candidate, he hasn't seen his wife and two children in six years.
``It's sad.'' He shrugs. His cheek and lip are scarred by a bullet
wound. What will he do when the war is over? ``Look for a new life
as a sharecropper.''

<TEXT>
   The thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations has warmed up
the world of art with the just-announced October mingling of the
priceless Faberge egg collections owned by capitalist Malcolm S.
Forbes and the Soviet Union.
   ``The exchange is very closely related to the improvement of
relations,'' Irina Rodimtseva, director of the Moscow Armory Museum,
said Friday through an interpreter. ``Only when countries and people
trust each other can such an exchange take place.''
   ``We're calling this egg-nost,'' said Christopher Forbes, whose
billionaire father owns a dozen of the Imperial Eggs. The
hand-crafted artworks were designed between 1884 and 1917 and
presented to the Russian czars Alexander III and Nicholas II.
   The Soviets own 10 of the hand-crafted eggs; San Diego Mayor
Maureen O'Connor, whose city will be host of the ``Treasures of the
Soviet Union'' exhibition from Oct. 21-Nov. 11, said the exact
number of eggs on display is under negotiation.
   ``Obviously this is a first not only for San Diego but for the
United States,'' O'Connor said. ``It means a lot for San Diego.
We're just very pleased.''
   As part of the deal, several of Forbes' eggs will subsequently go
to the Soviet Union for display in the Kremlin. Christopher Forbes
agreed that the Soviets' new openness was the key to the
unprecedented loans.
   ``Such a thing has never happened before. Even during previous
thaws, we were never able to get the eggs rolling,'' he said.
   According to O'Connor, the ground-breaking exhibition was
arranged with less trouble and international red tape than she
anticipated when the idea first came up.
   ``It was my dream to have the Soviet eggs in San Diego, and Madam
Rodimtseva's dream to have Mr. Forbes' eggs in the Soviet Union,''
she explained. ``She agreed to loan her eggs if Mr. Forbes would do
the same.''
   Although Christopher Forbes said he quickly agreed to this swap,
he never believed it would come about.
   ``I said yes with the firm belief that nobody would call,'' he
said. ``When they did, I had to convince my father to let them go.''
   According to Forbes, the final factor which convinced his father
to go along was the attitude of the Soviet government toward the
wealthy thrill-seeker.
   ``The fact that they treated us like another government convinced
the capitalist tool to go along,'' he said.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Facing Impeachment Trial Hits The Road Seeking Support</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings, his
impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate near, has been on the road
trying to rally support for what he concedes is a come-from-behind
effort.
   ``I have an uphill battle, all the way ...,'' Hastings told
listeners on a Miami radio station talk show last week. ``It's going
to be very difficult for me to extricate myself from this. History
demands that I try.''
   It was typical of the speaking appearances he's been making each
week on radio shows and at churches, colleges and civil rights
groups.
   With his Senate trial expected to begin as early as mid-March,
Hastings, 52, has been urging listeners to write their senators to
express interest in his case and contribute to his legal defense
fund.
   Although the judge is often warmly received, he has raised only
$4,000. He unsuccessfully asked for government help for his defense
expenses, saying the Justice Department has spent $2 million for ``a
witch hunt'' or ``fishing expedition'' against him.
   Hastings became the first black federal judge from Florida when
he was appointed by then-President Carter in 1979.
   He marked another, less happy first last August when he became
the only person ever to be impeached after he was already cleared of
similar charges in a criminal trial. The House vote to impeach, or
send the case to the Senate for trial, was 413-3.
   He is accused of conspiring with a former friend, attorney
William A. Borders, to reduce a sentence of two convicted
racketeers, and of lying and fabricating his defense during his 1983
criminal trial. Though Hastings was acquitted in that trial, Borders
was convicted of bribery conspiracy in a separate trial.
   Last month, the Senate Rules Committee dealt Hastings another
setback by deciding his trial would be largely conducted by a
12-member special committee before the full Senate votes on whether
to convict. A two-thirds majority would result in Hastings' removal
from the bench.
   On Friday, Hastings attorney Terence J. Anderson, a University of
Miami law professor, said he would file challenges to the Rules
Committee decision along with motions to dismiss the 17 articles of
impeachment.
   He contends that Hastings is unconstitutionally being tried twice
for the same case, because of the criminal trial. Supporters of the
impeachment answer that just because a charge is not proven beyond a
reasonable doubt to a jury's satisfaction does not mean that a judge
is fit to stay on the bench.
   The defense also argues that Congress and the Justice Department
may be trying to influence judicial independence through coercion.
   Hastings says the racial question bears on his troubles, but is
not the only cause.
   ``I'm not going to go up to the Beltway and say, `Leave me alone
because I'm black,''' Hastings said. But he usually adds: ``I do not
believe I would be in this situation if I were not black.''
   He says he was targeted by a federal sting operation in 1981
because of his liberal record on the bench, particularly his strong
opposition to Justice Department deportations of Haitian aliens.
   Judicial colleagues acted against him because he ``wasn't a
member of the club'' and because many of ``the Reagan ideologues''
want to keep the minorities and women appointed during the Carter
administration in check, he argued.
   Hastings called the overwhelming House vote ``rank politics.''
   Rep. Larry Smith, a Hollywood, Fla., Democrat and longtime
political ally of Hastings, said he voted for impeachment even
though such a vote was unlikely to help him politically. He said he
looked over the evidence carefully and felt he had no choice.
   Smith pointed out, though, that the impeachment was more like an
indictment and doesn't mean he presumes Hastings is guilty.
   Hastings reflected that his place in the history of the civil
rights movement would be determined by the trial's outcome.
   ``I may be considered a visionary, someone who fought the odds,''
he said. ``Or I could be remembered only for being removed from the
bench.''

<HEAD>Contradictions Cited In Tower Testimony About Defense Firm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary-designate John Tower
contradicted an earlier sworn statement when he told the Senate his
work for a British firm involved no military matters, according to
reports published Saturday.
   Meanwhile, new questions were raised about the thoroughness of
the FBI's background investigation of the embattled nominee. One
newspaper reported that several bizarre accidents, including
early-morning car crashes and a hotel fire, apparently were
overlooked in the probe.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee has put the nomination of
Tower, a former Texas senator and onetime chairman of the committee,
on hold while it takes a second look at Tower's personal habits,
including his use of alcohol, and his links to defense contractors.
   Tower, who has declined to be interviewed while his nomination is
pending, has denied in his Senate testimony any problem with alcohol
or any conflicts of interest concerning his business ties.
   A White House spokesman, Stephen Hart, declined on Saturday to
comment on the latest reports, saying ``it's (the nomination) before
the committee.''
   Tower's designated spokesman, attorney Paul Eggers of Dallas, did
not answer a reporter's calls Saturday.
   In written testimony to the Senate panel on Jan. 26, Tower said
he could ``recall no actions in connection with any defense
activities'' in connection with his work for the U.S. subsidiary of
British Aerospace, Inc.
   That statement, according to two publications, The Los Angeles
Times and the Legal Times, did not square with information which
Tower provided to divorce attorneys working for his second wife in
June of 1987.
   In the divorce deposition, Tower said he went to work for British
Aerospace eight weeks after resigning as the nation's chief
strategic arms negotiator and advised the company on how to sell
training jets, fighter planes and missile systems to the Pentagon,
the Los Angeles Times reported.
   Tower told the Senate committee he worked chiefly on selling
commercial aircraft to U.S. airlines and also advised the firm on
trade legislation and currency fluctuations. He said he earned
$265,000 from the company between June of 1986 and last December.
   The Legal Times said Tower told the divorce attorneys that he was
retained by British Aerospace for his advice on how to sell weapons
systems to the Pentagon, and that he listed the various weapons
involved. The deposition was never filed in court because Tower did
not contest the divorce, but a copy was obtained by the FBI, the
Legal Times said. It said its reporters were allowed by attorneys to
read it with the understanding that it not be quoted directly.
   The New York Post reported Saturday that the FBI apparently has
not bothered to talk to Tower's neighbors, examine certain police
records or investigate several car accidents involving Tower.
   The Post, citing syndicated columnist Cody Shearer, said the
incidents included an early-morning episode on June 6, 1967, when
Tower was trapped in his hotel suite in Dallas by a blaze he
accidentally set by dropping a cigarette on an overstuffed armchair.
   When firemen broke into his room to remove him, ``he was
reportedly in no condition to free himself,'' the Post said.
   The newspaper also said Tower wrecked his car in two
early-morning accidents within weeks of one another in 1970, and,
two years earlier, he drove into a bicycle ridden by James Patrick
Montoya, son of the late Sen. Joseph Montoya, D-N.M., on his way
home from work. The youth was not seriously hurt.
   FBI spokesman Bill Carter refused comment on specifics of the
Tower investigation, but said ``We will follow any lead.''
   On Friday, Tower authorized the release of a statement that
recent hospital tests showed no evidence of alcohol abuse, and Vice
President Dan Quayle said, ``I have never seen drinking being a
factor in John Tower's life other than a social glass of wine.''
   Eggers, meanwhile, acknowledged that there was ``no question''
that Tower sometimes drank too much in the early 1970s, but he said:
``He is not an alcoholic. He's not had a drinking problem for
years.''

<HEAD>Return of Kuwaiti Tankers Faces Possible Legal Hitch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has ``tentatively
approved'' de-flagging six Kuwaiti oil tankers, but the deal depends
on the ships remaining available to the United States in a national
emergency, U.S. officials said Saturday.
   The six ships are among 11 Kuwaiti tankers re-registered in July
1987 by the United States, entitling them to U.S. Navy protection as
they carried Kuwaiti petroleum exports through the war-torn Persian
Gulf.
   Iran, then in the seventh year of its war with Iraq, targeted
Kuwaiti ships because the Arab state supported Baghdad. Hostilities
halted Aug. 20 when a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire took effect.
   The Pentagon announced Jan. 11 the United States was preparing to
de-flag six of the Kuwaiti tankers. It said the other five had been
certified to continue flying the Stars and Stripes for another year.
   Walter Oates, a public affairs officer at the Maritime
Administration, said in a telephone interview the agency gave its
``tentative approval'' Feb. 7 for the six tankers to revert to
Kuwaiti registry.
   But he said it was unclear how Kuwait viewed the legal
requirement that its ships remain available to the United States for
possible use in a national crisis.
   ``Whether such a condition would be regarded by Kuwait as
impinging on its sovereignty, only the Kuwaitis could answer,'' he
said. Kuwaiti officials were not available immediately for comment.
   U.S. law stipulates the ``emergency availability'' as a condition
for the U.S. Maritime Administration to approve the sale or
re-registry of American-owned and American-flagged commercial ships
abroad.
   Another official, who requested anonymity, said it was not known
whether the Kuwaitis were aware of the provision, or whether it
would have made any difference at the time.
   Gulf-based shipping observers said another unknown factor was
what practical value the huge tankers might have for the United
States. One possible use might be storage.
   Technically, the 11 ships belong to the Chesapeake Shipping Co.,
of Dover, Del., a firm Kuwait set up in 1987 to provide ostensible
U.S. ownership. The ships' return to state-owned Kuwait Oil Tanker
Co. apparently would be only a paper transfer, not a sale.
   The de-flagging is the latest move by the United States to scale
down its military role in the gulf, reflecting what officials say
are reduced tensions since the truce.
   The United States tripled the strength of its force in the gulf
as the `tanker war'' worsened in 1987. Now it has trimmed that force
from 27 to 23 ships and no longer escorts tankers.
   The six being de-flagged include the 294,739-ton Townsend and
290,085-ton Middletown, both products carriers, and four identical,
46,723-ton liquified gas carriers.
   Sources close to the Kuwaiti owners said the two large tankers no
longer meet Maritime Administration safety rules and the gas
carriers were included because the United States does not have
enough merchant seamen qualified to serve on them.
   Under the agreement, Kuwait has to replace its ships' non-U.S.
crews with all-American crews if they fly the U.S. flag _ a legal
provision waived at the time of the re-flagging.

   The path taken by the Rev. Barbara Harris to her
historic consecration Saturday as Episcopal bishop took her to
prisons, corporate board rooms, divorce court and the editorial desk
of a feisty, liberal publication.
   Because that path did not include a college or seminary degree
and because of what some view as her extreme left-wing views _ to
say nothing of her gender _ Harris' consecration touched off heated
debate in religious circles.
   Harris, 58, became the first woman to become a bishop in any
branch of Christianity that traces its bishops in a direct line
2,000 years back to the time of Christ. In an elaborate ceremony
Saturday, she was consecrated suffragan, or assistant, bishop of the
Boston Episcopal diocese.
   The issue of a woman assuming the miter and scepter of a bishop
would engender debate throughout christiandom regardless of the
nominee. Harris provoked all the more discussion because of her
background.
   Some of the opposition to her elevation stemmed from her race as
well as her sex, says Harris, who is black.
   In the end her support was just as vocal and greater in quantity
than the opposition.
   ``I think the time is right for it,'' Harris said recently. ``And
I hope that we will soon see other women being elected and
consecrated as bishops.''
   Harris has been involved in chuch activities throughout her life.
Following the example of her mother Beatrice, who attended the
consecration, Harris sang in church choirs and taught in church
schools at St. Barnabus in Philadelphia.
   During the 1960s Harris became involved in the civil rights
movement and participated in the Selma, Ala., march led by the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. For a decade beginning in 1958, she worked in
a public relations firm and, beginning in 1968, she worked for Sun
Oil Co.'s public relations department, ending her career there in
1980 as a senior staff consultant.
   That same year Harris assumed the robes of an Episcopal priest
and began a career that took her to counseling sessions in state
prisons and sermons in a city parish. In 1984, Harris became
executive director of the Episcopal Church Publishing Co., an
organization not officially sanctioned by the church but one with a
considerable voice through its publication, The Witness.
   It was in the pages of this monthly magazine that Harris became
known to a wider audience through her regular editorials.
   She wrote in opposition to South Africa's apartheid policies and
to U.S. aid to rebels in Nicaragua. She wrote in favor of gay rights
and of an end to church discrimination against homosexuals and she
lambasted conservative wings of the church on numerous occasions,
sometimes angering as much with her style as with the substance of
her commentary.
   In 1963, after three years of marriage, Harris divorced Raymond
Rollins, which also was cited by some critics.
   Harris has moved into an apartment in Boston temporarily until
her permanent assignment within the eastern Massachusetts diocese is
established. Her family has lived in the same home in Philadelphia
for 70 years so the move is a jolt for her.
   She likes classical music and drinks an occasional glass of
chablis. She prefers ``any kind of gourmet food,'' but she also
likes soul food, especially black-eyed peas. ``I like cooking up a
storm for a large crowd,'' she said.

   Two of 17 pro-Iranian terrorists whose freedom is a
key demand of a group holding American hostages in Lebanon have been
released from prison after serving five-year terms, the interior
minister said Saturday.
   The 17 were convicted in 1984 of bombing the French and American
embassies and given sentences ranging from five years to death. The
Islamic Jihad, which holds two American hostages, has demanded
freedom for all 17. Kuwait has refused.
   Interior Minister Sheik Salem al-Sabah said the two freed men,
Abdul-Mohsen Rashash Abbas, 25, an Iraqi, and 30-year-old Nasser
Matar Dahash, whose family lives in Kuwait without official
citizenship, were released ``a while ago, having completed their
prison terms.''
   The two are not considered key figures in the long-running
hostage drama. Salem did not say what date they were freed or where
they are now.
   But Kuwait's information minister, Sheik Jaber Mubarak, told The
Associated Press in December the pair would be freed after they
finished their sentences and would be deported to the country of
their choice.
   Salem stressed to reporters the release ``has nothing to do with
the demands of extremist organizations.''
   Despite recent speculation that some of the 15 hostages, who
include nine Americans, might soon be freed, informed Arab sources
said there was no sign any were about to be released. Most of the
Lebanese captives are held by Shiite extremists.
   Islamic Jihad, believed made up of Shiite Moslem extremists loyal
to Iran, kidnapped Terry Anderson of Lorain, Ohio, on March 16,
1985, and Thomas Sutherland, 57, of Fort Collins, Colo. on June 9
the same year. The group has released four other Americans.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held of the hostages in Lebanon.
   In Washington, the State Department said it had no comment on the
terrorists' release.
   The 17 bombers _ Kuwaitis, Iraqis and Lebanese _ were arrested
and tried after the December 1983 bombings of the U.S. and French
embassies and Kuwaiti government installations.
   Three were sentenced to death but have not been executed, and 12
were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 10 years to life.
   The two released were handed the shortest sentences and are not
believed central to Islamic Jihad's demand for the release of the 17.
   Among the bombers sentenced to death is Mustapha Youssef
Badreddin, a cousin and brother-in-law of Imad Mugniyeh, said to be
the leader of Islamic Jihad. He was convicted under the alias of
Elias Fuad Saab.
   One of those serving life is Hassan Youssef Musawi, a cousin of
Hussein Musawi, leader of another Iranian-linked Shiite faction in
Lebanon.
   Since their 1984 trial, extremists have hijacked two Kuwait
airliners to press for the release of their comrades. Kuwait has
refused to negotiate.
   In December 1984, a Kuwait Airways plane was seized on a flight
from Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, to Karachi, Pakistan, and
was flown to Tehran. The hijackers killed two American passengers
and vanished after Iranian security men stormed the plane to end the
six-day ordeal.
   A Kuwaiti Boeing 747 was hijacked April 5, 1988 on a
Bangkok-Kuwait flight. It was flown first to Iran, then to Larnaca,
Cyprus, where the hijackers killed two Kuwaiti hostages.
   The plane was later flown to Algiers, Algeria, where the 16-day
saga ended with the hijackers freeing the hostages and the plane,
apparently in return for safe conduct out of the country.
   Mugniyeh, wanted by U.S. authorities as one of four Lebanese
Shiites who hijacked a TWA jet in June 1985 and killed an American
serviceman, is believed to have masterminded last year's Kuwait
Airways hijacking.
   Iran had accused Kuwait of aiding Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war.
   Kuwaiti officials blamed Iran for the 1983 bombings and other
acts of sabotage in Kuwait. Relations with Tehran began improving
last year after a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire between Iran and Iraq.

<HEAD>Bush Has Approved Continuing Aid To Afghan Rebels, Spokesman Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush has approved
continuing U.S. military aid to the Mujahadeen rebels resisting the
Soviet-imposed government in Afghanistan, an administration
spokesman said Saturday.
   Deputy press secretary Steve Hart confirmed that Bush had decided
Friday to continue helping the rebels.
   ``The president met with his National Security Council,'' Hart
said, ``and reaffirmed U.S. policy'' of continuing the flow of
money, arms and supplies to the rebels so long as the Soviet Union
keeps sending aid to the Kabul regime.
   The New York Times, which initially reported the decision, quoted
senior administration officials as saying that despite the
continuing Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Soviets
have left behind large amounts of military hardware and sent in new
military equipment.
   It said the Bush administration decision, in effect, means that
the political goal of American policy in Afghanistan now that the
Soviet troop withdrawal is virtually complete is to hasten the
collapse of the Kabul government.
   Bush spent a relaxed day here Saturday, taking a stroll and
greeting townspeople during a brief shopping trip.
   Wearing a heavy-duty naval flyer hat with flaps and carrying a
walking stick, Bush walked through the town square, stopping briefly
chat with people and poking his stick in the air to make points. The
first couple braved temperatures in the 20s for the midday outing.
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, appeared in the business district of
this seacoast town around lunchtime, midway through a quiet weekend
of relaxation at their Walker's Point estate.
   While Mrs. Bush held their dog, Millie, on a leash, the president
went into Colonial Pharmacy for a few moments. Asked what he'd
bought, Bush waved a paper bag and said, ``A few razor blades.''
   ``Thank you. What a welcome!'' he said just before jumping into a
beige van for the short ride back to his vacation retreat.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that Bush had
attended to routine paperwork in the morning and had made some phone
calls.
   Bush did not take any questions from reporters during his walk
through town, and press aides declined to discuss a Los Angeles
Times report saying that former Sen. John Tower had made conflicting
statements about the nature of his role as a consultant to British
Aerospace.
   The newspaper said that Tower had told a congressional committee
that he had given non-military advice to British Aerospace, although
he had said in a divorce deposition that he did consult the firm on
military-related matters.
   ``We have no knowledge on that,'' Hart said. ``It's before the
committee.''
   Fitzwater, asked to respond to criticism by congressional
Democrats about Bush's failure to specify federal programs that will
have to be cut in fiscal 1990, said only that he had talked to the
president Saturday. ``He said he's still very pleased with the
reaction to the budget,'' the press secretary said.
   Asked if he would quarrel with assertions that Bush failed to
tell Congress where he would cut the budget, Fitzwater replied,
``Dispute it? We're bragging about it. That's what he wants to do,
get Congress to help in cutting the budget.''
   Bush on Wednesday proposed a $1.16 trillion budget for the fiscal
year that begins next Oct. 1. The document proposes several changes
to the budget that Ronald Reagan submitted to Congress on Jan. 9 _
changes which principally reflected priorities that Bush laid out
during his campaign, such as more spending on education,
environmental issues and such social problems as AIDS and the
homeless.
   Fitzwater said that Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, has agreed ``to sit down'' with administration officials to
work on a budget compromise.
   ``We want to work out a budget,'' the spokesman said. ``We're not
going to speculate on courses of action. ... We want to work it out
the way it should be worked out, which is to sit down with
Congress.''

   A comatose woman on Saturday underwent an
abortion ordered by her husband in hopes of saving her life, ending
a two-week legal fight with anti-abortionists that reached the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   ``It's been a major battle. I am tired and wounded. I want to go
on with my life,'' Martin Klein said shortly after his wife's
abortion. ``No other family should ever have to go through what we
have gone through.''
   Nancy Klein, 32, remained comatose and was listed in guarded
condition after the abortion but her vital signs were stable, said
spokeswoman Carol Hauptman of North Shore University Hospital. A
team of doctors, including an expert on second-trimester abortions,
handled the procedure, she said. Mrs. Klein was 18 weeks pregnant.
   ``We have one other hurdle to overcome, and that is Nancy's
recovery,'' Klein said. ``I will live with this decision, but the
decision had to be mine.''
   Mrs. Klein has been in a coma at the hospital since a Dec. 13 car
accident.
   Klein said doctors told him that terminating his wife's pregnancy
could give her a better chance of recovering, so he asked a judge on
Jan. 26 to declare him her legal guardian so he could authorize the
abortion.
   Although a judge granted Klein's request, the ruling was
challenged by right-to-life advocates who appealed the decision at
each court level until U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall
rejected their stay request Friday.
   Klein, 34, of Upper Brookville on Long Island, quickly approved
the abortion and the procedure was completed Saturday morning.
   Although medical experts testified on Klein's behalf that the
abortion could help his wife's recovery, Ms. Hauptman said it was
unclear what effect the abortion would have on Mrs. Klein.
   The two anti-abortionists, who had sought to be named Mrs.
Klein's guardian themselves, said an abortion would threaten her
emotional well-being.
   Abortions have been performed before on comatose pregnant women,
but never involving the same type of injury or coma, Ms. Hauptman
said.
   ``This is not only landmark legal terrain but also medical.
There's nothing in the medical literature like this,'' Ms. Hauptman
said.
   The operation ended two weeks of strain for Klein and his family.
   ``We are extremely relieved that the court battle is over and the
operation went smoothly,'' said Anne Zusselman of Del Ray Beach,
Fla., Mrs. Klein's mother.
   ``Now we are hopeful that Nancy's condition will improve and that
we can move on to therapy for her,'' Mrs. Zusselman added. She and
her husband visit their daughter daily at the hospital.
   Pro-choice advocate Bill Baird said the case was not about
abortion rights.
   ``This was an issue of husband and family rights, not abortion,''
Baird said. ``It's a pity this family had to go through the pain and
the suffering.''
   Baird suggested Klein sue anti-abortion activists John Short of
Farmingdale and John Broderick of Syosset for the anguish their
extended legal efforts caused, but Klein said it was too soon to
consider such a case.
   ``This is the most tragic thing that ever could have happened,''
Short said Saturday afternoon. ``We tried very hard up to the last
second. We had a person standing on a phone at the hospital and one
standing at a phone in Washington, but we couldn't do it.''
   Short vowed to work to persuade the full U.S. Supreme Court to
hear the case in an effort to prevent such cases from happening
again.
   A half-dozen activists supporting a woman's right to choose an
abortion carried placards outside the hospital, including one that
read: ``Right to Life _ Your name is a lie. You were willing to let
Nancy die.''
   Several Nassau County police cars were stationed at the hospital
in case anti-abortion activists staged any protest, but none showed
up.

   A crowd estimated at 3 to 4 million
celebrated the Islamic revolution's 10th anniversary Saturday by
taking to the streets for a rally and roaring ``Death To America!''
   Men, women and children braved snow and icy winds whistling down
from the Alborz mountains to attend the rally around the towering
independence monument in Freedom Square.
   A 10-story-high portrait of Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini served as a backdrop.
   President Ali Khamenei told the revelers their nation is ready
for relations with ``every country that doesn't plot against us.''
   But a resolution read aloud said Iran should never have ties with
Israel, South Africa and ``their godfather, the Great Satan,'' the
Iranian epithet for the United States.
   The rally and others across Iran marked the climax of 10 days of
celebrations that began Feb. 1, the date in 1979 when Khomeini
returned to Tehran in triumph after 15 years in exile.
   Ten days later, the last government appointed by Shah Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi collapsed. Khomeini's revolutionaries took power and
proclaimed the Islamic republic.
   In November of that year, fundamentalists took over the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage 444 days.
   The revolution has survived bloody internal strife, an eight-year
war with Iraq and the hostility of much of the world.
   Beneath the huge portrait of Khomeini hoisted for the rally, a
slogan in Farsi and English said: ``The Victory of the Revolution
Needs Safeguarding.''
   Khomeini did not attend the rally, which police estimated drew 3
to 4 million people. The 88-year-old leader reportedly is in poor
health and rarely leaves his home in north Tehran.
   He was represented by his son Ahmed, who is emerging as an
increasingly powerful political figure.
   Khamenei, speaking from a platform draped in blue and green
streamers, said the turnout was proof of Iranians' faith in the
revolution and ``a warning to the world oppressor powers who
conspire against the revolution.''
   ``Today our revolution is stronger than ever despite the many
obstacles placed in its way during the first 10 years by the
oppressor powers,'' he said.
   Cheerleader Ali Mozavardi, known to Iranians as ``the minister of
slogans,'' whipped the masses into a frenzy by leading them in his
deep baritone voice in shouting anti-American slogans.
   Iranians stabbed their fists in the air in time with their
roaring chant of ``Marg Bar Amrika!'' or ``Death to America!''
   The bearded Khamenei, speaking in a flat, unemotional voice, said
``there may be differences of opinion and taste between
individuals'' in the Iranian government, but denied there was a
power struggle.
   Nonetheless, there have been clear signs of a split, particularly
since the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war.
   One divisive issue is the campaign by Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani, the most powerful figure after Khomeini, to normalize
Iran's relations with Western countries and end its self-imposed
isolation.
   The differences were illustrated last week when Interior Minister
Ali Aakbar Mohtashemi criticized a two-day visit to Iran by French
Foreign Minister Roland Dumas.
   He said France was Iraq's second-biggest arms supplier after the
Soviet Union during the war with Iran. ``Instead of clasping the
hands of such foreigners we should join hands with our people to get
rid of foreigners,'' Mohtashemi said.
   At the rally, many women _ who stood separately from the men in
accordance with religious code _ carried photographs of husbands or
sons killed in the war.
   There were hundreds of war veterans in wheelchairs or on
crutches, and one group was given a position of honor in front of
the speaker's platform.
   Khamenei said that although Iran's postwar reconstruction will
depend mainly on Iranians, ``we also need the cooperation of those
countries which are not motivated by plots or conspiracies against
us.''
   The six wide avenues converging on Freedom Square were crammed
with people after the rally, one of the biggest in the capital in
recent years.
   Sixteen helicopters, including some identified by officials as
Iranian-built Shabaviz craft, showered the crowds with flowers and
revolutionary leaflets.

<HEAD>More Than 1,000 Fisherman Brave Unsafe Ice To Fish</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 fishermen headed out onto
frozen Lake Winnebago for the start of the sturgeon spearing season
Saturday despite warnings that the ice was unsafe.
   Authorities used a helicopter and a small airplane Saturday to
look for cracks.
   No emergencies were reported in the first hours after the season
opened at dawn, the Winnebago County Sheriff's Department said.
   ``We're just keeping our fingers crossed up here,'' said a
dispatcher, who asked not to be identified.
   Signs posted along the west shore of the lake in the Oshkosh area
warn that the ice is hazardous, and state Department of Natural
Resources officials warned early last week that conditions were
unsafe on large areas of the lake.
   Martin Wesenberg of the Otter Street Fishing Club said he had not
seen conditions as bad since 1932. Anyone who ventured onto the ice
in the Oshkosh area ``is crazy,'' he said.
   Hundreds of shanties, cars, trucks and snowmobiles were in place
by Friday afternoon as fishermen prepared for the annual event,
wardens from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources said.
   Most of the fishermen were at the north end of the lake, near
Neenah, Menasha and High Cliff State Park, where the ice was
believed to be thicker than in the Oshkosh and Fond du Lac areas.
   As recently as two weeks ago, the lake had many open areas and
authorities said at least a week of very cold weather was needed to
make the ice safe.
   Fishermen were jubilant when below-zero temperatures hit the area
last week and stayed for several days, but authorities said a swift
Fox River current kept the ice from freezing uniformly and strong
wind broke up the ice in many places.
   The DNR said any strong wind between now and March 1, when the
spearing season ends, could cause the ice to break up, stranding
fishermen, shanties and vehicles.

   Well-wishers filled a London church Saturday to
celebrate the consecration in the United States of a female
Episcopal bishop, the first woman elevated to that rank in the
Anglican Communion.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, leader of the worldwide
Anglican Communion and spiritual head of the Church of England _
which bars women from the priesthood _ wrote to the Episcopal Church
to say he would pray for it on the day of the Rev. Barbara Harris'
consecration in Boston.
   ``We are deeply conscious that not every Anglican will yet feel
able to acknowledge her as a bishop of the church,'' Runcie said in
his message, which was released to the press.
   The Church of England is divided on the issue of women's
ordination but is committed to moving slowly toward it.
   The issue of a woman achieving the rank of bishop is even more
divisive, and some members of the Anglican clergy and laity say they
will not be able to recognize Harris in her new role.
   Some 250 worshipers, most of them women, filled St. James's
Church in Piccadilly, where the Rev. Sister Denzil said Harris'
consecration gave new hope to the church.
   Some of the worshipers wore badges that read: ``God is an equal
opportunity employer _ shame about the church.''
   ``Layers of fear and prejudice have been broken through and years
of stereotyping have been cast off,'' said Sister Denzil, a nun and
deacon of the Community of St. Andrew in London.
   Harris' position would bring her pain, Sister Denzil said, but
she had been elected to the post by men and women who believed she
was the best person for it.
   The service was organized by the Movement for the Ordination of
Women, Women in Theology, the St. Hilda's Community and Priests for
Women's Ordination.
   The Bishop of Bristol, the Right Rev. Barry Rogerson, said
Saturday that the consecration was a cause for sadness.
   ``We in the Church of England cannot at present receive her
ministry as a bishop and so our fellowship, our communion with one
another, is impaired; our unity is undermined,'' he said.
   The consecration has been criticized by the Evangelical and
Catholic Mission in America and the Association for the Apostolic
Ministry in Britain.

   Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank
stormed into an Arab village Saturday, damaging some homes and later
stopping police from detaining a suspect in the raid, Arab and
Israeli reports said.
   An Israeli legislator warned that conditions in the occupied
lands were ripe for producing a new Jewish underground aimed at
terrorizing Palestinians, Israel radio said.
   Arab doctors said six Palestinians were wounded in clashes with
soldiers.
   Settlers from the Izhar settlement raided the nearby Arab village
of Burkin to retaliate for a stone-throwing attack, the radio said.
It gave no details on the stoning attack.
   The radio said the settlers smashed windows of a car on their way
and damaged houses in the village. It did not say what weapons they
carried or how they damaged the homes.
   Arab reports gave a similar account but also said the settlers
beat an elderly woman. The army said it had no information on that
incident.
   Later Saturday, Izhar settlers prevented police from detaining a
suspect in the attack, the radio said. No details were given.
   Legislator Yossi Sarid of the leftist Citizens' Rights Movement
warned that conditions in the occupied lands were apt to produce a
new Jewish underground like the settlers' group that waged a
terrorist war against Palestinian activists in the early 1980s,
Israel radio said.
   Sarid called on Israel's Shin Bet security service to deploy
agents in the territories to foil any such attempt, the radio said.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, about 120 communists hoisted
Palestinian flags and marched Saturday to celebrate the seventh
anniversary of their party, Arab reports said.
   The march came on a day of more clashes in the occupied
territories between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian protesters. At
least three Palestinians were wounded, hospital sources said.
   The march in Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, attracted
members of the Palestinian Communist Party, an Arab reporter said.
The protesters were defying a ban imposed on their party by Israeli
officials.
   Their party mounted a similar march Friday in the West Bank town
of Bir Zeit.
   Later in Nablus, soldiers shot and wounded a two girls, ages 16
and 18, in the legs as the troops were dispersing stone-throwing
protesters, doctors said. Despite the clashes, the commander of a
paratrooper unit patrolling the streets of Nablus said the city of
120,000 was unusually quiet.
   ``We came to a place considered to be a center of the uprising,
and it's quiet. Of course, here and there we have stone-throwings or
burning tires, but we can control and almost ignore that,'' Capt.
Yehuda Federman said on Israel radio.
   In one of several other clashes reported Saturday in the West
Bank, a 14-year-old Palestinian was shot in the pelvis in Qalqilya,
hospital officials said.
   They also said three women from Qalqilya _ ages 18, 30 and 45 _
were beaten by soldiers when the women tried to free an Arab
detained by the army.
   The army said it was checking reports of injuries in Saturday's
violence.
   At least 380 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have died since the
revolt against Israeli occupation broke out in December 1987. Israel
seized the territories from Arab neighbors in the 1967 Middle East
war.

   The Soviet Union will build new power
plants, renovate old ones and set up oil rigs in Iraq under an
accord the two countries signed Saturday, state radio reported.
   Iraqi radio said the agreement was aimed at expanding economic
and technical cooperation between the Soviet Union and the gulf
state.
   Under the agreement, the Soviet Union will build 11
thermoelectric plants and an unspecified number of hydroelectric
power plants, and it will expand several other plants built by the
Soviets in the past 30 years.
   It said the two sides also agreed the Soviet Union will continue
its expansion and development at West Quran oil field, 43 miles
north of the southern port of Basra.
   The accord called for building four new rigs in West Quran, as
well as four others in Iraq's major oil field of al-Rumaila, also
near Basra, the radio said.
   It was signed by Iraq's Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi
and his Soviet counterpart, Vasily Dinkov.
   Iraq and Iran both have ambitious plans to rebuild their
war-battered countries since they signed a cease-fire Aug. 20.

   Grenades exploded in the police station of
a small Guatemalan town on the Mexican border and injured 30 people,
federal police said Saturday.
   Five police officers were among the injured, and two were in
serious condition in a hospital, authorities said.
   The grenade attack was on the police station in Tecun Uman
shortly before midnight Thursday. The town is near the Mexican city
of Tapachula and about 155 miles west of Guatemala City.
   Federal police said no individual or organization claimed
responsibility for the attack and they refused to say whether they
had any suspects.
   At least four rebel groups operate in rural areas of Guatemala,
but terrorist attacks are sporadic.

   More than 4,000 protesters Saturday
heckled and jeered about 1,000 members of the right-wing German
National Democratic Party as it began a two-day rally.
   Protesters gathered near a hall where delegates met for the party
conference, and 1,000 police officers surrounded the building to
keep the two sides apart, officials said.
   By mid-morning, delegates could no longer reach the hall because
of the protests, police said.
   A police spokesman, Reinhard Stellke, said officers used
spray-can irritants at one point to clear a path for delegates. He
said police, fearing violence, later decided not to escort any more
delegates to the hall.
   Police reported several scuffles and vandalism to cars.
   Stellke said party sympathizers beat one demonstrator as the
protester, but there were no arrests.
   Demonstrators shouted ``Kick the Nazis out!'' and ``Keep the
foreigners, force the Nazis out'' as delegates arrived early
Saturday.
   One delegate responded: ``You couldn't be helping us more. You're
giving us great publicity.''
   Another complained: ``This wouldn't happen in Bavaria,'' the
nation's conservative stronghold.
   The German National Democratic Party's platform calls for
expelling foreigners as a way to maintain a ``national German
identity.''
   The rally came two days after the West German government outlawed
a neo-Nazi party and two weeks after ultra-right candidates were
elected to the West Berlin Parliament.
   The democratic party has about 6,000 members, according to West
German Interior Ministry figures.
   City officials had banned the rally, saying they feared violence.
   Rahden has a population of about 12,000 and is 37 miles south of
the northern port city of Bremen.
   A regional court Friday struck down the ban and an appeals court
upheld that ruling.

<TEXT>
   U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings, his
impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate near, has been on the road
trying to rally support for what he concedes is a come-from-behind
effort.
   ``I have an uphill battle, all the way ...,'' Hastings told
listeners on a Miami radio station talk show last week. ``It's going
to be very difficult for me to extricate myself from this. History
demands that I try.''
   It was typical of the speaking appearances he's been making each
week on radio shows and at churches, colleges and civil rights
groups.
   With his Senate trial expected to begin as early as mid-March,
Hastings, 52, has been urging listeners to write their senators to
express interest in his case and contribute to his legal defense
fund.
   Although the judge is often warmly received, he has raised only
$4,000. He unsuccessfully asked for government help for his defense
expenses, saying the Justice Department has spent $2 million for ``a
witch hunt'' or ``fishing expedition'' against him.
   Hastings became the first black federal judge from Florida when
he was appointed by then-President Carter in 1979.
   He marked another, less happy first last August when he became
the only person ever to be impeached after he was already cleared of
similar charges in a criminal trial. The House vote to impeach, or
send the case to the Senate for trial, was 413-3.
   He is accused of conspiring with a former friend, attorney
William A. Borders, to reduce a sentence of two convicted
racketeers, and of lying and fabricating his defense during his 1983
criminal trial. Though Hastings was acquitted in that trial, Borders
was convicted of bribery conspiracy in a separate trial.
   Last month, the Senate Rules Committee dealt Hastings another
setback by deciding his trial would be largely conducted by a
12-member special committee before the full Senate votes on whether
to convict. A two-thirds majority would result in Hastings' removal
from the bench.
   On Friday, Hastings attorney Terence J. Anderson, a University of
Miami law professor, said he would file challenges to the Rules
Committee decision along with motions to dismiss the 17 articles of
impeachment.
   He contends that Hastings is unconstitutionally being tried twice
for the same case, because of the criminal trial. Supporters of the
impeachment answer that just because a charge is not proven beyond a
reasonable doubt to a jury's satisfaction does not mean that a judge
is fit to stay on the bench.
   The defense also argues that Congress and the Justice Department
may be trying to influence judicial independence through coercion.
   Hastings says the racial question bears on his troubles, but is
not the only cause.
   ``I'm not going to go up to the Beltway and say, `Leave me alone
because I'm black,''' Hastings said. But he usually adds: ``I do not
believe I would be in this situation if I were not black.''
   He says he was targeted by a federal sting operation in 1981
because of his liberal record on the bench, particularly his strong
opposition to Justice Department deportations of Haitian aliens.
   Judicial colleagues acted against him because he ``wasn't a
member of the club'' and because many of ``the Reagan ideologues''
want to keep the minorities and women appointed during the Carter
administration in check, he argued.
   Hastings called the overwhelming House vote ``rank politics.''
   Rep. Larry Smith, a Hollywood, Fla., Democrat and longtime
political ally of Hastings, said he voted for impeachment even
though such a vote was unlikely to help him politically. He said he
looked over the evidence carefully and felt he had no choice.
   Smith pointed out, though, that the impeachment was more like an
indictment and doesn't mean he presumes Hastings is guilty.
   Hastings reflected that his place in the history of the civil
rights movement would be determined by the trial's outcome.
   ``I may be considered a visionary, someone who fought the odds,''
he said. ``Or I could be remembered only for being removed from the
bench.''

   Antonio Ferreira, who for a time was
listed as the world's shortest man, died of a respiratory illness at
the age of 44, the LUSA news agency reported Saturday.
   Ferreira, who was 29 inches tall, died Friday, according to LUSA.
As a drummer with a musical group, The Pop Kings, Ferreira had
toured South Africa and Japan.
   Ferreira was succeeded as the world's shortest known human adult
by Nelson de la Rosa, of the Dominican Republic. According to the
Guinness Book of World Records, he measures 28.3 inches tall.
   Dozens of friends and family attended Ferreira's funeral in his
home village of Arcozelo in northern Portugal on Saturday.
   Village priest Jose Branco paid tribute to Ferreira, saying ``men
are not measured by their size, but by the deeds they do.''

   Fans of Orson Welles and the curious
lined up to pay $180 for a postcard with his picture and signature
on it and $3,500 a sculpture that once belonged to the late
actor-director.
   ``I'm going to get something,'' said Ellen Hart, 70, who cowered
in a Pennsylvania farmhouse in 1938 as the ``aliens'' in Welles'
frighteningly realistic radio play ``War of the Worlds'' drew
closer. ``I want a piece of a man who gave us so many memories.''
   More than 550 items from Welles' Hollywood estate went on the
block at a three-day auction that began Friday at C.B. Charles
Auction Galleries.
   ``Orson Welles liked to surround himself with the finest of
everything,'' said owner C.B. Charles, who purchased the items last
year from a longtime girlfriend of Welles for an undisclosed sum.
   ``There was only one Orson Welles, and people are still
fascinated by him,'' said Charles.
   Welles died Oct. 10, 1985, in Hollywood of a heart attack after a
long bout with diabetes.
   On Friday, a standing-room-only audience of more than 300 bid an
autographed publicity photograph of Welles in the classic 1941 film
``Citizen Kane'' to $110. A book with a self-portrait caricature on
the front page was snatched for $225, while a 17{-inch bronze
sculpture of a Russian soldier on horseback sold for $3,500.
   A working pocket watch went for $260; a broken one went for $140;
a French postcard with Welles' face on it, signed by Welles himself,
went for $180.
   ``We really came here just for a glimpse of what Welles was like
as a man,'' said Tom Black of Miami. ``Looking at what people own is
such an insight into what they were really like.''
   Welles directed or acted in more than 60 films and won an Oscar
for screenwriting for ``Citizen Kane,'' loosely based on the life of
newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst.
   Susan Grimes' parents were children when Welles fooled the nation
with ``War of the Worlds,'' but the mystique of the event was still
strong for her.
   ``It's part of American lore,'' said Grimes, 34. ``It will be a
long time before we forget Orson Welles.''

<TEXT>
   Workmen cleaning a heavily traveled tourist
area of a fabled temple stumbled across an ancient hoard of statues
of pharaohs and gods, a discovery that researchers called a
potential gold mine of historical data.
   Officials said five statutes so far have been dug up inside the
famous Luxor Temple in Luxor, a Nile River city about 450 miles
south of Cairo.
   ``There are other statues still buried, and only small parts of
them are showing,'' Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization. ``We will know more when we dig them up.''
   He said he expects the statues to represent leaders and deities
from a 750-year period that ended about 500 B.C., shortly before the
Persians conquered Egypt.
   Displaying the find to President Hosni Mubarak on Friday,
Egyptologist Aly Hassan described it as ``the most important of the
end of the 20th century.''
   Notable from the first half of the century are the discovery of
the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun across the Nile River from Luxor in
1922; a fabulous golden trove found in the Nile Delta at Tanis in
1939; and a dismantled full-size boat found beside the
4,600-year-old pyriamid of Pharaoh Cheops in 1954.
   Hassan said the Luxor Temple discovery turned up by chance on
Jan. 22 during routine cleaning of an area at the western end of the
temple's Amenhophis III courtyard, rimmed by towering and majestic
columns.
   Three of the five statues found so far have been identified, he
said.
   One is an 8-foot quartzite statue of Pharaoh Amenhophis III, who
ruled Egypt in 1391-1353 B.C. and founded the existing Luxor Temple.
The others are life-sized or larger.
   Another statue, 5{-feet long and made of black diorite, depicts
the cow-headed goddess Hathor, guardian of women, beauty and love.
The third identified statue, made of granite, is of General
Haremhab, a soldier who usurped the Egyptian throne at the end of
the 18th dynasty after Tutankhamun and his caretaker Aya died.
   He said the Amenhophis III statue became visible as workers were
cleaning.
   ``Nobody expected such a find because the area is visited by so
many tourists each day,'' Hassan said.
   Until Friday, the cache remained covered and under guard.
Antiquities officials debated whether excavating the relics would
damage the fragile temple and jeopardize the stability of columns.
   Luxor Temple, an island of stone beauty beside the Nile, is
considered the most endangered monument in the Luxor area,
undermined by a rising water table and a river of sewage water
flowing beneath it.
   During its construction, the temple underwent continual changes
and additions, including changes ordered by Tutankhamun, Ramses II
and Alexander the Great.
   After the reign of Amenhophis III, ancient Egypt's religion
underwent major upheaval when his son and successor Akhenaten
ordered that a new god, Aten, be given precedence over the existing
array of deities. His agents hacked the name of Amun, the
long-favored god of Thebes, from monuments throughout Egypt.
   The new discoveries give evidence of the turbulence, as the name
Amun was chiseled from Amenhophis's statue. Egyptian officials said
the cache surely will yield historical data from the period of
religious frenzy and violence.
   Antiquities officials said the statues probably were hidden by
temple priests.
   ``We can expect to find such caches from time to time,'' said
Zahi Hawass, archaeological adviser to the culture minister and
director of Giza Plateau. ``We think these objects were buried by
priests trying to hide them during periods when strife was occurring
throughout the country.''

<HEAD>Opposition Rally Demands Democracy From New Regime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM H. HEATH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people marched peacefully
on Saturday and demanded that the new regime postpone the May 1
elections so the opposition will have time to launch an effective
campaign.
   ``The people demand an authentic democracy and not a mere
facade,'' shouted Domingo Laino, leader of the Authentic Radical
Liberal Party, believed to be the largest opposition group.
   The rally in downtown Ascuncion followed by nine days the coup
led by Gen. Andres Rodriguez, who toppled the government of former
dictator Alfredo Stroessner. Stroessner had ruled for nearly 35
years.
   Rodriguez dissolved Congress, promised democracy and called
elections for May 1.
   But opposition leaders said the election has been called too
soon. They argue that voter lists are outdated and that some groups
never have been able to participate in elections.
   Opposition figures say the official Colorado Party, which has
held power for 42 years, is too rich and well-entrenched to be
effectively challenged at the polls on such short notice.
   Radio stations said the chanting, flag-waving crowd at the Plaza
of the Heroes ranged from 50,000 to 60,000 people. Witnesses placed
the number closer to 10,000.
   ``This is the first time since I was 16 years old that I've
attended a political rally,'' said Elsa Benitez Rodado. ``For the
last 30 years, only they (Colorados) have been able to demonstrate.
All we got were beatings.''
   Atilio Avelos, a 42-year-old farmer, said he traveled from the
city of Colonel Oviedo, 87 miles east of the capital, to
``demonstrate that this new opening to democracy is for the benefit
of all the people. We have to be a single family.''
   Police under Stroessner refused to authorize demonstrations that
might be construed as anti-government, and violently broke up those
that were held anyway. On Saturday, the few police that were present
directed traffic.
   Rodriguez' government authorized the rally, and one of the
capital's two television stations broadcast it live.
   Vendors sold ice cream and soft drinks from hand carts.
   Official and unofficial delegations represented the United
States, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela and Taiwan.
   ``At this historic moment, we wish to express our hope that the
Paraguayan people may find, though peaceful dialogue, the road to a
new era of justice and liberty,'' the U.S. delegation said in a
communique. The group included former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt and
the former ambassador to Paraguay, Robert White.
   The rally was staged by the National Accord, a loose grouping of
four opposition parties of which Laino is president. He said he
spoke Friday night with new Interior Minister Orlando Machuca
Vargas, and would submit opposition demands in writing on Monday.
   In addition to the postponing elections, the opposition seeks
changes in election laws that would permit several parties to unite
behind a single candiate, which now is prohibited; and new voter
lists to replace current ``fraudulent'' ones.
   Some marchers Saturday were skeptical of the new regime's
response to their demands.
   ``It's not convenient for the government to give the opposition
time to organize,'' said Maria Mercedes Ramirez, a pretty
23-year-old secretary and student.

   The government said Saturday that
a Vatican report condemning apartheid misrepresents South Africa's
racial policies.
   The Foreign Affairs Department, in a statement, said it had not
received a copy of the full, 45-page Vatican document released
earlier in the day, but was issuing a preliminary response based on
news reports.
   ``On the basis of what is known to us, (the document)
misrepresents South African government policy, clearly restated by
the newly elected leader of the governing party in his first
parliamentary statement in that capacity last week,'' the department
said.
   It referred to Education Minister F.W. de Klerk, recently elected
to replace ailing President P.W. Botha as leader of the National
Party.
   In a speech Wednesday, de Klerk called for an end to
white-minority domination and racial prejudice, although he
reaffirmed the government's commitment to segregation and made no
mention of establishing black voting rights.
   The Vatican document called apartheid ``institutionalized racism
... justified by an ideology of the superiority of persons from
European stock over those of African or Indian origin.
   ``Today apartheid is the most marked and systematic form'' of
racism, the document said. ``Change is absolutely necessary and
urgent.''
   French Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, head of the Vatican commission
that prepared the document, said he went last year to South Africa,
where 5 million whites hold political power while 26 million blacks
have no vote in national affairs.
   The Foreign Affairs Department, without mentioning Etchegaray,
said the government ``finds it regrettable that a statement has been
made on such a complex and difficult issue without the Vatican
leadership having been to South Africa to assess for themselves the
situation here.
   ``The department nevertheless appreciates the report's
condemnation of violence and its advocacy of communication and
consultation as a method of resolving problems,'' the government
added.
   The Vatican document, entitled ``The Church and Racism: Towards A
More Fraternal Society,'' said racism should be combatted through
nonviolent means.
   ``The application of legislative, disciplinary and administrative
measures, or even appropriate external pressure, can be timely ...
but without ... going so far as to replace violently one unjust
situation with another injustice,'' it said.
   Pope John Paul II has said conditions are not ripe for a papal
visit to South Africa, although his plane was forced to land there
because of bad weather during a trip to other southern African
nations last year. There have been unconfirmed reports in South
Africa that the pope might visit in 1990.

<HEAD>Law Drafted to Protect Interests of Soviet Consumer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed law published Saturday gives the often
defenseless Soviet consumer some new rights in the marketplace,
including the power to get defective mechandise repaired or replaced
at no cost.
   Legal protection for consumers has been so ineffective in the
Soviet Union that many national newspapers last year reported the
``sensation'' of Muscovite Mikhail Makhov's successful battle in
court to get his money refunded for a faulty tape recorder, the Tass
news agency said.
   ``People in the U.S.S.R. have long been awaiting the appearance
of this legal act,'' Tass said in a commentary on the new law.
   The draft law, printed in the government daily Izvestia, says
Soviet enterprises and citizens ``who sell products of inadequate
quality'' would bear legal responsibility.
   Shoddy goods must be exchanged or the purchase price refunded,
unless additional legislation provides some other redress, the
proposed law stipulates.
   Poor quality merchandise can be seized from a firm if a court
agrees, says the proposed law, which was submitted for nationwide
discussion by the Supreme Soviet Presidium, the government's top
executive body.
   Delays in meeting contracts for furnishing goods or services, a
chronic problem in the Soviet economy, can result in fines that the
delinquent supplier must pay to the consumer, according to the law.
   The legislation is to be discussed nationally and presented along
with citizens' recommendations to the Supreme Soviet parliament for
consideration by April 15, Izvestia said.
   The consumer protection law is only one of a series of measures
advanced under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to increase both the
quantity and quality of goods available to Soviets.
   Because the importance of competition was traditionally scoffed
at, many Soviet factories ``have monopolized the output of this or
that product, and dictate their terms to the consumer,'' Tass said.
   It said the new law would change that by involving consumers,
along with designers, production personnel, and government
authorities, in setting standards for goods. Independent consumer
associations are also authorized under the law.

   The Rev. Barbara Harris, with the voices of
dissidents overwhelmed by cheers from thousands of fellow
Episcopalians, on Saturday became the first woman elevated to bishop
in a 2,000-year succession dating back to the apostles.
   Harris was greeted with a roar of approval from about 8,000
people when she walked down the aisle for a consecration that has
drawn world attention because of her gender, background and liberal
views.
   She was faulted by a conservative church member who said in a
brief speech that her elevation would be a sacrilege. But when the
chief consecrator, the Most Rev. Edmond Browning, asked the
congregation if it was their will that Harris be ordained, they
thundered out: ``That is our will.''
   ``I will obey Christ and serve in his name,'' Harris said.
   ``Men and women now stand together before God, in today's world,
a world that needs that,'' First Bishop David Johnson of the Boston
Episcopal Diocese said before the consecration, held in a convention
center to accommodate the crowd.
   Beginning with a solemn procession and culminating in the laying
on of bishops' hands and the placing of a pointed bishop's miter on
her head, Harris assumed the relatively minor position of suffragan,
or assistant, bishop in the Boston Episcopal diocese.
   Harris said after her consecration that it put ``a tremendous
amount of responsibility'' on her shoulders.
   ``That responsibility includes encouraging young people to press
on and overcome barriers and to hang in there,'' Harris said, adding
that she intended to do just that.
   After the ceremony, she said she would try to reach out to her
opponents and others to try to allay their fears. ``We will be in
contact. We will do that to the best of our abilities,'' she said.
   ``Just say I'm very proud and very happy. That's all,'' said
Harris' mother, Beatrice Harris.
   The 58-year-old former publisher of a liberal Episcopal
publication is the first woman consecrated a bishop in any of the
three major branches of Christianity _ Roman Catholicism, Eastern
Orthodoxy and Anglicanism, which includes the Episcopal Church _
that consider bishops successors to Jesus' apostles.
   Her selection touched off months-long debate within the church.
   Opponents included traditionalists who believe that because the
apostles were men, the position of bishop must be reserved for men.
Others objected to Harris because of her lack of a college degree
and formal seminary training and because of her relative
inexperience in parish ministerial work. Still others objected to
her strongly liberal writings on gay rights, U.S. policy in Central
America and internal church matters.
   Harris, who is black, said she believes that some of the
opposition to her elevation stemmed from her race as well as her sex.
   But by last month her election was confirmed by a majority 118
Episcopal dioceses across the country.
   As a result of the intense debate, Saturday's rites drew network
television coverage and a live local television audience.
   During a period in the ceremony allotted for protest, John
Jamieson of Evanston, Ill., chairman of the conservative Prayer Book
Society's Chicago chapter, appealed to Browning, presiding bishop of
the Episcopal Church in the United States.
   ``Bishop Browning, please weigh the consequences. By proceeding
with this pretended consecration you will perpetuate a sacrilegious
imposture, you will abandon the communion of all those churches
descended from the Church of England and you will destroy the
concept of legality in the Episcopal Church,'' Jamieson said.
   Browning received a standing ovation after saying that Harris'
consecration was in accordance with church laws.
   A 1976 vote by Episcopal bishops cleared the way for Saturday's
consecration by approving the ordination of women as priests. Harris
became a priest in 1980, one of about 1,200 women ordained.
   Harris' election last September by members of the Boston
Episcopal diocese also touched off debate from other denominations
that bar women from the priesthood.
   Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston's Roman Catholic archdiocese
declined an invitation to attend the ceremony and said in a
statement that the consecration of Harris ``has serious ecumenical
implications because it departs from a common tradition in regard to
sacramental orders.''
   The Episcopal Church, an offshoot of the Church of England, was
established in 1784 following the Revolutionary War. It is one of 27
member churches of the Anglican Communion grouped under, though not
governed by, the Anglican Church.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, leader of the worldwide
Anglican Communion and spiritual head of the Church of England _
which bars ordination of women _ wrote to the Episcopal Church on
Saturday to say he would pray for the church.
   ``We are deeply conscious that not every Anglican will yet feel
able to acknowledge her as a bishop of the church,'' Runcie said in
his message, which was released to the press in England.
   Other Anglicans in England held prayer services of support
Saturday and two members of the Church of England came to Boston to
present Harris with letters of support.
   The Church of England broke with the Roman Catholic Church in
1534 during the reign of King Henry VIII. Despite the break,
Anglicanism, and later the Episcopal Church, maintained many Roman
Catholic rites and traditions, including the concept of a direct
succession of bishop dating back to the apostles.
   The word Episcopal itself refers to a church governed by bishops
rather than a pope or central archbishop. A 1985 survey counted
7,858 parishes and some 2.9 million members. Boston's diocese is
among the larger in the nation with 190 parishes and 96,000 members
in the eastern half of the state.

   The proliferation of harbor dinner cruises,
overnight fishing trips, whale-watching excursions, ``booze
cruises'' and commuter ferries _ coupled with a series of accidents
_ has led the Coast Guard to propose new safety standards for small
passenger vessels.
   Written after a 1951 charter boat collision off Long Island left
56 dead, the small passenger safety law has remained largely
unchanged since 1963 while a multitude of new uses has sprung up,
says Coast Guard Cmdr. William Cummins.
   The boats, defined as carrying more than six passengers and
displacing less than 100 gross tons, used to be predominately for
day fishing trips and small ferry boats.
   Most of today's vessels are much bigger than the boats of the
1950s and 1960s and often are carry hundreds _ and in several cases
thousands _ of passengers, Cummins said.
   Uses include high-speed passenger ferries, harbor taxies, dinner
cruises, whale-watching and other tour boats, the popular ``booze
cruise'' floating parties and chartered fishing trips that extend
for days at a time.
   Ocean liners, large ferry boats and other vessels more than 100
gross tons fall under separate rules and already face tougher safety
standards.
   Proposed new requirements include improved life-saving equipment,
radar and electronic position-fixing equipment for certain new
vessels as well as public address systems for all new vessels and
existing vessels with more than one passenger deck.
   Emergency lighting on vessels more than 65 feet, fire
extinguishing systems for enclosed machinery spaces, fire pumps
capable of remote operation, smoke detectors on certain vessels,
passenger manifests and mandatory public safety announcements are
also on the list.
   In addition, wooden boats or vessels operating in salt water
would have to go into drydock every two years for repairs and
inspection.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has long pushed for an
overhaul of the small passenger vessel regulations.
   Michael Benson, an NTSB spokesman, said the Coast Guard's
proposed rules ``certainly go in the right direction.''
   ``The board has felt and recommended for some time that the
changes are needed because the old rules are inadequate,'' he said.
``Whether the new rules go as far as the board would like we'll only
know after an evaluation, which has just begun.''
   Industry representatives said they too are still analyzing the
proposals and their potential impact.
   ``As businessmen they're pro-safety, but I don't think they've
been able to assess what the government regulations will mean to
them individually,'' said Peter Lauridsen, a technical consultant
for the National Association of Passenger Vessel Owners.
   The proposals would cost the industry about $8.5 million a year,
the Coast Guard estimate. Released Jan. 30, they are subject to 120
days of public comments. Cumins said he does not expect the final
rules to be adopted until mid-1990.

   Light snow was widely scattered Saturday with little significant
accumulation.
   Snow showers and squalls spread flakes during the afternoon over
northern New York state, northern Maine and Michigan.
   Advisories for snow squalls were posted over north-central New
York state, near Lake Ontario.
   Snow also was scattered from eastern Idaho across Utah and
western Colorado, as well as from east-central across west-central
Nevada.
   The heaviest snowfall during the 6 hours up to 1 p.m. EST was 1
inch at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., and Mount Washington, N.H.
   Elsewhere, light rain fell over southern Texas.
   Around the nation at 3 p.m. EST, temperatures ranged from 5
degrees at Helena, Mont., to 79 at Miami. Saturday's official
overnight low was 5 below zero at Helena.
   For Sunday, showers were forecast from northeastern Texas across
Arkansas, northern Louisiana, central Mississippi and central
Alabama. Snow was forecast from northern New England across northern
and western New York state, over Upper Michigan, and from eastern
Nevada across Utah.
   Highs in the 20s and 30s were predicted over most of the northern
Plains, the upper Missouri Valley, the Rockies, the Great Basin of
Nevada and western Utah, the upper Mississippi Valley, the Great
Lakes, the northern Appalachians, and from New England across New
Jersey; in the 30s and 40s over the Ohio Valley; in the 40s in part
of the northern Plains from southern Montana across western South
Dakota; in the 40s and 50s from Maryland and Delaware across the
Virginias, North Carolina, the Tennessee Valley, the central
Mississippi Valley, from Kansas across northern Texas, and the
northern two-thirds of the Pacific Coast; and in the 60s and 70s
over the remainder of the nation.

   The leader of Salvador's leftist rebel movement
says in an article released Saturday his group is far more moderate
than is widely believed and seeks a new system that is ``open,
flexible, pluralistic and democratic.''
   Joaquin Villalobos, commander of the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, said the revolutionary government he is fighting
for ``should avoid confrontation with the United States'' because El
Salvador's ties to it are stronger than those his country has
elsewhere.
   Villalobos outlined his views in an article in Foreign Policy
magazine, which described it as his first comprehensive statement
for an English-language publication.
   The Reagan administration spent an average of well over $100
million a year in military aid to El Salvador to prevent a takeover
of that country by Villalobos and his followers, seeing them as
intent on establishing a Marxist state with strong ties to Cuba and
the Soviet Union.
   The prevailing view in administration has been that the
Salvadoran rebels are far more radical than the insurgency in
Nicaragua which seized power nine years ago.
   But Villalobos wrote that ``it is neither possible nor
necessary'' in El Salvador to ``eliminate totally'' the private
sector, establish a single-party system, bar other parties from the
media, break with the church or eliminate elections.
   ``The FMLN,'' he said, ``pursues an El Salvador that is open,
flexible, pluralistic and democratic in both the economic and
political spheres.''
   With presidential elections set for next month, El Salvador is
entering a crucial stage. The FMLN recently moved away from its
support of a peaceful settlement based on power sharing to one of
support, under certain conditions, for the existing electoral
process.
   Although no agreement has been reached with the govenrment,
Villalobos called the proposal ``a final effort to avoid a social
explosion.''
   Rejecting the Cuban model, which emphasizes total state control
over the economy, Villalobos said a ``combination of the private and
public sectors can lead to more rapid development of Salvadoran
society than a supposedly more radical and closed model.''
   Further emphasizing his preference for pragmatic policies,
Villalobos said ``an ideological approach is of no use if it does
not resolve the problems of poverty. But El Salvador cannot develop
if the United States does not understand its situation and drives it
to develop a war economy.''
   He also called for freedom of expression.
   ``Through debate and education, the masses can learn why they
should defend their historic achievement, the revolution itself,''
he said. ``But this knowledge cannot be developed without
opposition, without an understanding of the opposition's point of
view.''
   He added that to promote debate, ``professional journalism that
is both independent and critical is fundamental.''
   There was no immediate comment by the State Department on
Villalobos' article but shortly before returning to private life
last month, Elliott Abrams, former assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs, said he expected that the Salvadoran rebels
would expand efforts to influence public opinion in the United
States.
   He said the Sandinista government in Nicaragua was able to
influence Congress last year to suspend aid to the Contra rebels and
he predicted a similar attempt by the FMLN to persuade the lawmakers
to reduce aid to the Salvadoran government.
   A recent State Department report said there has been a steady
increase in FMLN ``assassinations, kidnapings, use of
pressure-detonated mines that kill and maim indiscriminately.''
   It said that guerrilla mines killed 39 people and injured more
than 130 in the first nine months of 1988.

<TEXT>
   Food-poisoning scares involving chicken, eggs,
butter and popular precooked dinners have left millions of Britons
baffled and preoccupied with what they can and cannot eat.
   Since December, when a government health minister said most of
Britain's egg production was infected with salmonella, the debate
over the risk of eating various foods has gained momentum.
   Public anxiety has been aroused partly by news media attention
and front-page headlines, such as ``Cheese Can Kill Your Baby'' in
Saturday's tabloid The Sun, and partly by confusing data from
officials.
   ``The average consumer is punch-drunk with warnings and
statistics _ many of which seem contradictory,'' said the normally
pro-government Daily Express on Saturday.
   During the weekend, Britons faced a triple food scare:
salmonella-infected chickens and eggs; mercury-contaminated butter;
and soft cheeses, precooked meals, and fresh fruits and vegetables
contaminated by listeria bacteria.
   The Department of Health on Saturday denied a front-page story in
the liberal Guardian newspaper that claimed the government was
delaying publication of a report into another scare _ the
possibility that meat products from cattle infected with a brain
virus could trigger the same disease in humans.
   The report will be published soon and there is no health risk
because milk and meat from such animals is being destroyed, the
government said.
   With public concern mounting, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservative government announced Friday a committee to investigate
all aspects of food safety.
   The Agriculture Department on Friday ordered farmers to slaughter
all salmonella-infected chickens. The disease can be fatal to the
elderly and very young.
   Also Friday, the government's chief medical officer, Sir Donald
Acheson, warned pregnant women not to eat soft cheeses, which could
be contaminated by listeria bacteria, and urged that precooked meals
be reheated to prevent listeria contamination.
   A Ministry of Agriculture spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Saturday that a ban would be imposed on
unpasteurized milk. Pasteurization kills some bacteria and delays
the development of others.
   Meanwhile, Dairy Crest, Britain's largest butter producer, called
in police and recalled all Cornish-brand butter after a container
was found to be contaminated by mercury. The company said Saturday
there was no risk of harm to humans.
   Robin Cook, the opposition Labor Party's health spokesman,
welcomed formation of the investigative committee and Acheson's
recommendations but said: ``I would be more impressed if the
guidance to the public was accompanied by regulations on the food
industry, to get at the root of the problem.''
   Even the prime minister's staunchest newspaper supporters
expressed doubt the government's actions would quell public anxiety.
   ``The problem, which the spate of recent food scandals has
brought into focus, is the tendency of government departments to
mirror producer interests at the public expense,'' the pro-Thatcher
Daily Mail said in an editorial Saturday.
   The Financial Times, the respected conservative financial daily,
echoed this assessment, saying the government had been ``inept'' and
unable to reconcile the interests of egg producers, represented by
the Ministry of Agriculture, with those of consumers who ended up
with no voice.
   ``What we need,'' the Daily Mail said, ``is a separate Whitehall
(government) department corresponding to the Food and Drug
Administration in the United States, to safeguard the people against
the farmers', wholesalers' and retailers' failures and sins.''
   But Geoffrey Cannon, secretary of the Guild of Food Writers,
wrote in The Daily Telegraph on Saturday that the public's demand
for inexpensive, mass-produced food had led to the current health
scares.
   ``The truth is that the severe outbreak of salmonella poisoning
... is caused by our demand for cheap eggs. If we want cheap eggs,
we will get mass production, by methods that must heighten the risk
of disease; if we want safe eggs, we must be prepared to pay more.
As with eggs, so with chickens,'' he said.

<HEAD>Two Men Convicted In Slaying Of Teen-Ager Suspected Wrongly Of Rape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men have been convicted in the 1987
slaying of a teen-ager who they mistakenly accused of raping the
80-year-old grandmother of one of the men.
   A Tarrant County jury deliberated less than 40 minutes Friday
before convicting Norris Wayne Hicks and Boyd Ballard of murder in
the Nov. 27, 1987, shooting of Jeffery Donnelle, who died eight days
later.
   ``It's a shame, because he (Donnelle) wasn't guilty,'' said Terri
Moore in closing arguments. ``This 17-year-old kid absolutely died
for nothing.''
   After Donnelle's death, police determined his blood type did not
match the blood type of the person who raped the elderly woman. No
one has been charged in the rape.
   The jury will return Monday to set punishment for Hicks, 36, of
nearby Arlington, and Ballard, 35, of Alabama. They face sentences
of five to 99 years or life in prison.
   During the three-day trial, witnesses testified that Donnelle was
killed because the two defendants were under the impression that
Donnelle had raped Ballard's grandmother.
   A stepdaughter of Hicks testified that the 80-year-old woman had
identified Donnelle as her attacker from a television news report
and a photograph.
   Defense attorneys argued unsuccessfully that prosecution
witnesses were doing the same thing that the two men had done _
mistakenly identifying them as killers.
   Hicks' wife, Ruby Nell Gay Hicks, faces a charge of conspiracy to
commit murder in connection with the same case.

   About 12,000 peasants and farm
workers marched through the capital on Saturday to defend the
Christian Democratic government's land reform program.
   The peaceful rally was staged by the pro-government National
Union of Farmworkers.
   The group has warned against erosion of the gains made during the
9-year-old land reform program, which redistributed nearly a third
of the tiny Central American nation's arable land.
   Presidential elections are scheduled March 19 and the rightist
Republican Nationalist Alliance is favored to win.
   Some Christian Democrats and leftists fear the rightists may try
to overturn the land reform program, though the Republican National
Alliance denies such intentions.
   Also Saturday, about 1,000 people in the eastern provincial
capital of San Miguel marched in support of the mayor, who like his
counterparts has been threatened with death by leftist guerrillas
fighting the U.S.-backed government.
   The mayor, Ricardo Leon, said he would not resign as have 90 of
the country's 262 mayors.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the guerrilla
army, since early 1988 has waged an intimidation campaign against
municipal authorities. The rebels have assassinated nine mayors.
   The insurgents accuse municipal authorities of helping to
implement what they call ``the U.S.-imposed counterinsurgency
project.''
   The resignation of more than a third of the country's mayors has
created administrative problems. A substitute, usually from the
municipal council, carries out some mayoral functions in most cases,
but some towns have been left virtually without municipal authority.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega on Saturday
urged President Bush to abide by whatever decisions the Central
American presidents reach during their upcoming summit.
   Ortega told a news conference that the summit that begins Monday
will help revive the dormant Central American peace plan.
   ``We can assert that the plan is not dead ... but instead that it
is being strengthened by the will of the Central American
presidents,'' Ortega told a news conference.
   ``I hope President Bush respects the decisions that we Central
American presidents reach'' at the summit, he said.
   The summit of the presidents of Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala,
Costa Rica and El Salvador is to be held in El Salvador.
   Ortega said he will propose:
   _ A plan under which Central America and the United States can
jointly fight the illegal drug trade. ``Drugs are produced by the
south, consumed by the north, and in their transit they go through
Central America,'' Ortega said.
   _ Suggest having international observers ``from the United
Nations, the Organization of American States ... and other
countries'' to oversee elections.
   _ Discuss regional economic subjects. ``The Central American
region demands economic backing without discrimination of any sort.''
   _ Pursue a proposal he has given Honduran President Jose Azcona
Hoyo to repatriate Nicaraguan Contra rebels and their relatives who
are in Honduras. ``This effort could be supported by the U.S.
Congress.''
   The summit was supposed to take place in August and had been
postponed at least five times. The leaders are to meet under a plan
they signed in August 1987 designed to bring peace to Central
America.
   Congress last February stopped military aid to the Contras, who a
month later signed a preliminary cease-fire with the Sandinista
government. The Sandinistas have been extending the truce month by
month and now only sporadic violations occur.
   Asked about reports that Contra leaders would be at the summit
and would try to meet with the Nicaraguan delegation, Ortega said
the Contras ``have no place'' at a meeting of Central American
presidents.
   Ortega added that ``the possibility exists'' that U.S.-Nicaraguan
relations can return to normal. The United States, which had been
aiding the Contras since 1981, imposed a trade embargo on Nicaragua
in 1985.
   Nicaragua is suffering from a serious economic crisis with
rampant inflation and low productivity.

<TEXT>
   Legal experts from the government and the
opposition began working together Saturday on ways to reform
Poland's judicial system.
   Representatives of the banned trade union Solidarity plan to
raise the issue of the need for a more independent judiciary, said
historian Bronislaw Geremek, an opposition figure.
   The talks are part of the historic negotiation session that began
Monday between the government and the opposition, led by Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa.
   The talks are aimed at reforming the political, social and
economic framework of the country. Small groups have been set up to
address individual issues.
   The full negotiations are expected to last four to six weeks.
   Meanwhile, a strike over pay by transport workers in Piotrkow
Trybunalski, a central Polish provincial city of 80,000 people,
continued Saturday, Polish television said. The strike began Friday
and is backed by the official trade union OPZZ.
   Strikes for higher pay that began Friday also continued at two
departments in a steel plant in Ostrowiec Swietokrzyski near Kielce
in central Poland and at the Laziska steel mill in southern Poland,
the state-run news agency PAP said Saturday.
   The OPZZ was leading the strike at Ostrowiec Swietokrzyski, state
media reported Friday. A Solidarity spokeswoman said Saturday that
striking workers at the Laziska steel mill said their action was
spontaneous and not led by any union.

   The United States has warned the
Palestine Liberation Organization against attacking Israeli military
or civilian targets, but is not ready to break off talks with Yasser
Arafat's group over a clash in southern Lebanon, Secretary of State
James A. Baker III said Saturday.
   Launching a weeklong trip to 14 West European capitals, Baker
said he had not decided whether an incident a week ago means the PLO
has reneged on Arafat's pledge renouncing terrorism. In the
confrontation, Israeli forces intercepted and killed five guerillas
who were carrying identification papers linking them to two factions
of the PLO.
   The pledge and the statement by the Palestinian leader accepting
Israel's right to exist prompted the Reagan administration last
December to open talks with the PLO after a 13-year official ban.
   ``We are not prepared at this time to say this constitutes action
by the PLO to cause us to break off the dialogue,'' Baker said on a
flight from Ottawa, Canada, where he opened U.S. consultations with
North Atlantic Treaty Organization members on Friday.
   But, Baker said, Robert Pelletreau, the U.S. ambassador to
Tunisia, had informed PLO officials there that the clash last
weekend was the kind of action ``that presents us with great
difficulty.''
   In fact, Baker said, ``We made the point that actions such as
this _ directed against civilians or military targets, inside or
outside of Israel _ were something that gave us trouble.''
   The U.S. decision to talk to the PLO boosted Arafat's standing in
the international community. Since then, he has gained increased
support from West European governments.
   Israel, meanwhile, sharply disagreed with the U.S. decision.
After the clash, Israeli leaders said the five guerillas _ four
Palestinians and a Lebanese _ had tried to infiltrate Israel to
carry out a terrorist raid.
   Israeli Ambassador Moshe Arad complained to Baker on Wednesday in
Washington and said the incident showed the PLO had not changed its
tactics despite Arafat's pledge.
   Baker said terrorism was one of the issues he intended to discuss
with the 14 foreign ministers he will see on his European tour.
   Baker said he hoped to encourage ``a collective'' approach, but
that he would not ``foreclose'' unilateral retaliation.
   The United States bombed Tripoli, Libya, in 1986 in what was
described by the Reagan administration as retaliation for Libyan
involvement in a terrorist attack on a West German nightclub
frequented by Americans.
   Baker met for nearly two hours in Iceland with Foreign Minister
John Baldvin Hannibalsson.
   He then flew to London for meetings Sunday with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British
foreign secretary.
   Baker said the NATO alliance was ``extraordinary important'' to
the Bush administration as it shapes its foreign policy.
   ``We want them to be in on the takeoff so they can be in on the
landing with respect to policy formulation as this administration
gets started,'' he said in an airborne news conference.
   Baker again rejected any suggestion the administration was
foot-dragging in dealing with the Soviet Union on arms control and
other issues.
   He said an ongoing review of U.S.-Soviet relations could prompt
some U.S. policy changes, but gave no specific examples.
   On a related issue, he confirmed he would meet an early March
with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Vienna as
NATO and the Warsaw Pact open negotiations on reducing non-nuclear
forces in Europe.
   Baker said the Bush administration had not decided when to resume
negotiations with the Soviets to reduce long-range nuclear weapons.
The Reagan administration had decided tentatively on next Wednesday,
Feb. 15.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The captain of a luxury liner that sliced a disabled
Cuban freighter in two said Saturday his crew was not at fault in
the pre-dawn collision that left three Cuban crewmen missing.
   The cruise ship Celebration arrived home in Miami on Saturday as
federal transportation officials, the Coast Guard and its insurer,
Lloyd's of London, questioned the crew about the Friday morning
collision off Cuba.
   Despite an 18-inch gash and black scrape marks on its bow, the
734-foot cruise ship sustained only minor damage, and none of its
1,500 passengers or 600 crewmembers was injured, a Carnival Cruise
Lines spokesman said.
   Capt. Rafaele Gravino, master of the Celebration, said the
350-foot Cuban vessel, the Capitan San Luis, was drifting without
lights or steering in a major shipping channel and made no effort to
warn his crew of the impending collision.
   ``The fault is with the ship that had no lights,'' said Gravino.
   But the helmsman of the Cuban vessel said Saturday his captain
tried to warn the Celebration and maneuver to avoid the accident,
reported Prensa Latina, Cuba's official news agency.
   ``We signaled the other ship to let us maneuver and tried to
change course to avoid an accident,'' said Ramon Lahera, whose right
leg was amputated after the collision.
   Prensa Latina said Lahera remains hospitalized in Holguin in
eastern Cuba, and the search continues for the captain and two other
lost crewmen.
   Gravino also said his crew was not to be blamed for failing to
check radar for 27 minutes prior to the accident.
   ``When there is no visibility, the radar is checked very
frequently. But when there is good visibility, you are supposed to
see the lights of the other ship,'' Gravino said during a news
conference aboard the ship.
   His crew didn't see the cement hauler until they were 300 feet
apart, he said. His officers threw the engines into reverse, but it
was too late to avoid slamming into the disabled freighter.
   The Cuban crew told their rescuers that the freighter had lost
electrical power. But Carnival spokesman Tim Gallagher said they
still could have warned passing ships of its plight.
   ``When you do not have emergency lights, you can still raise oil
lamps, use the radio or shoot flare guns,'' he said.
   Gravino quickly left the news conference to meet with
investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board, which
has conducted a series of hearings in Miami on cruise line safety.
   NTSB officials said they were looking into the incident even
though it involved a Liberian-registered cruise liner and a Cuban
freighter en route from Havana to the Canary Islands.
   A crew from the Coast Guard's marine safety office judged the
vessel to be seaworthy and it set sail Saturday afternoon on another
weeklong trip to the Caribbean, Gallagher said.
   The Celebration's crew rescued 42 of the 45 Cuban crew members,
the Coast Guard said. The surviving sailors were picked up by a
Cuban navy frigate and tug and 13 were hospitalized in Cuba, Prensa
Latina reported.
   The three missing men included the ship's captain, Manuel Velazco
Morales, 34, Antonio Campos de los Reyes, 41, and Ivan Freyre Diaz,
40, all of Havana, the news agency reported.

<HEAD>Psycholgist Festinger Dead at 69</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Psychologist Leon Festinger, who developed the
theory of cognitive dissonance during a 47-year career as a teacher
and writer, died Saturday of liver cancer. He was 69.
   Festinger, a New York City native, was professor of psychology at
the New School for Social Research from 1968 until his death.
Festinger died at his New York home, the New School said.
   ``He certainly was one of the most influential psychologists of
our time,'' said Robert Johnson, professor of social psychology at
Columbia University.
   Festinger wrote dozens of articles and books on psychology,
including several on the theory of cognitive dissonance, which
occurs when two simultaneously held thoughts, opinions or beliefs
are inconsistent.
   A City College of New York graduate, Festinger went on to get his
master's and doctorate from Iowa State University. He later taught
at the University of Iowa, the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, the University of Michigan and the University of
Minnesota.
   Prior to coming to the New School, he was professor of psychology
at Stanford University from 1955-68.
   Festinger is survived by his wife, Trudy, two sons, a daughter, a
stepdaughter and three grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court
on Saturday to delay former White House aide Oliver North's
Iran-Contra trial, citing a danger he would divulge too many
national security secrets.
   ``Proceeding with the trial on those terms will make it
impossible for the attorney general to fulfill his responsibility to
safeguard classified information,'' the department said in asking
for a stay.
   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, who is prosecuting North,
urged the Supreme Court to reject the Justice Department's request,
saying the department has no legal authority to seek a delay.
   Walsh said the attorney general ``comes before this court in an
attempt to assume a role that the Ethics in Government Act and his
own Independent Counsel Regulation deny him: that of prosecutor in
this case.''
   The independent counsel called the Justice Department request an
``eleventh-hour application'' and said the department ``has sought
to interfere in this trial at the final hour.''
   A jury was chosen Thursday in North's trial on 12 felony charges
stemming from the Iran-Contra affair, and U.S. District Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell has asked the jurors to report to the courtroom
Monday.
   It was not clear when the Supreme Court was likely to act on the
Justice Department request.
   The Justice Department appealed to the Supreme Court after a
three-judge federal appeals panel on Friday _ for the second time in
as many days _ refused to delay the start of North's trial.
   Department officials say that if the delay is denied, Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh is prepared to act under the Classified
Information Procedures Act to file an affidavit objecting to
disclosure by North of some classified information. That step could
result in dismissal of some or all criminal charges against North.
   Under CIPA, once the attorney general files an affidavit, the
court must order North not to disclose the classified information at
issue, even though it is relevant material tending to prove his
innocence. Dismissal of charges likely would follow on grounds that
North would not be given a fair trial.
   The department criticized the judge in the case for not reining
in North's plans to use extensive amounts of classified material.
   ``No order of the District Court prohibits defendant North, in
his opening statement or during the government's case, from simply
disclosing, without seeking prior court approval, classified
information that falls outside'' eight categories identified by
Gesell last Wednesday, said the Justice Department's 19-page court
filing.
   ``Even as to information within those categories, no order
prohibits defendant North from disclosing classified information
during his own case,'' it added.
   Gesell issued orders Dec. 12 and Jan. 19 spelling out how much
censorship could be applied to classified material that the
prosecution and defense planned to use at trial.
   ``The categories of information covered by the two orders were by
no means exhaustive,'' said the Justice Department. ``Much
classified information remained unprotected and was not the subject
of any pretrial ruling on admissibility.''
   The department wants to delay the trial so additional steps can
be taken to bar North from disclosing classified material.
   Walsh disagreed with the department's assessment, saying he
believes that ``all areas of concern to the intelligence agencies
have been adequately covered by the district court's orders.''
   The independent counsel said that during seven months of CIPA
proceedings he has asked intelligence agencies to enumerate which
specific classified information could never be disclosed at trial,
and then took action accordingly to protect the secrets.
   Walsh has largely cooperated with intelligence agencies in trying
to resolve problems involving classified material.
   On Wednesday, the Justice Department and Walsh parted company so
abruptly that Walsh's staff reportedly had almost no warning that
the department was going to court on its own.
   The problems began Jan. 19 when Gesell issued an order that would
permit North to introduce, without a prior court order, classified
information tending to show that his intent was not to violate the
law.
   Intelligence agencies were concerned over the freedom the order
gave North to present a broad array of classified material.
   As an alternative, the government asked Gesell to require the
defense to provide advance notice or get a court order before
disclosing classified information. Gesell rejected that proposal
Jan. 30.
   The Justice Department on Wednesday asked for a court order
barring disclosure of classified material as long as a government
objection was pending. Walsh, however, asked Gesell to impose no
more than the restrictions that already apply to prosecutors.

<HEAD>Film On Solidarity Back In Polish Theater</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The award-winning film ``Man Of Iron,''
which chronicled the birth of the Solidarity trade union movement,
is being shown at a theater here for the first time since its
official premiere in 1981.
   The film, which includes a cameo appearance by Solidarity leader
Lech Walesa, returned to view last week, the same week the
government and the outlawed union began their historic talks on
reforming Poland.
   Directed by Andrezj Wajda, the movie was awarded the Grand Prix
prize at the Cannes International Film Festival in 1981 and
nominated for an Academy Award the same year.
   A product of the cultural explosion during the 1980-81 period in
which the communist government approved Solidarity as the only legal
independent union in the East Bloc, the film disappeared from
theaters after the martial-law crackdown in December 1981.
   ``Man of Iron'' is playing three times daily in the Palace of
Culture and Science, a Stalin-era structure that towers over central
Warsaw.
   ``Man of Iron'' depicts the rise of Solidarity during a strike of
Gdansk shipyard workers led by Walesa.
   It is a sequel to ``Man of Marble,'' which explored the
tribulations of a bricklayer plucked from obscurity to be displayed
as a model worker during the 1950s.

   Iranian monarchists marched through central London
on Saturday to demonstrate support for Prince Reza Pahlavi, the son
of the late shah of Iran.
   The march coincided with the 10th anniversary of the Islamic
revolution that overthrew the monarchy.
   The demonstrators, led by a man wearing a mask of the Iranian
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeni, shouted anti-Khomeini slogans as
they marched past Hyde Park.
   Police reported no incidents.
   The demonstrators, estimated by the organizers to number 3,000 to
5,000, said in a statement Iran had been ``taken back into the
Middle Ages, both socially and economically'' by the fundamentalist
revolution, which drove Reza's late father, Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi into exile.
   In Tehran, 3 million to 4 million took to the streets for a rally
celebrating the anniversary, the climax of 10 days of celebrations
that began Feb. 1, the date in 1979 when Khomeini returned to Tehran
in triumph after 15 years in exile.

<TEXT>
   More than 100 dissident parishioners
took over St. Michael's Roman Catholic Church on Saturday to begin a
two-day vigil to protest the transfer of their popular Polish pastor.
   ``We're here to stay, day and night,'' Halina Chmiel, a
spokeswoman for the group, said as about 120 mostly Polish
dissidents marched up the center aisle of the 89-year-old church
just before the afternoon Mass.
   The protesters planned to stay for two days and two nights and
some said they would go on a hunger strike, she said.
   The dispute centers on the replacing of the Rev. Bruno Pysz, a
popular pastor who was transferred to a Buffalo, N.Y., parish in
August, and associate pastor Roman Palaszewski.
   Church officials maintain Pysz went voluntarily to the Buffalo
parish and was not removed, as some of the protesters contend.
   The protesters criticized the Rev. John Bambol, who was brought
in to replace Pysz, for attempting to open the parish to other
ethnic groups and allegedly verbally abusing the dissidents. The
parish is in a mostly Hispanic neighborhood in Bridgeport's East End.
   Bambol was in New York on Saturday and unavailable for comment,
church officials said, and telephone calls were not immediately
answered. But he has said previously, ``as people get aroused,
they're likely to do anything.''
   ``The church is a place to pray, not to protest,'' said Casmir
Zapolnik, an usher who said he's been a church member since coming
from Poland 25 years ago.
   As the procession moved down the center aisle behind a
hand-painted banner that said ``Church Occupation'' in red letters,
arguments broke out between the protesters and those who had
gathered for Mass.
   Several police officers were dispatched to the church, but no
arrests were made and there was no attempt to remove the protesters.

   Ugandans voted Saturday for members of an
expanded legislative council in an election critics said was aimed
at entrenching the government of President Yoweri Museveni.
   The National Resistance Council, the legislative body of
Museveni's National Resistance Movement, was to be expanded from 98
members, all presidential appointees, to 278.
   Of that number, however, 68 still will be presidential appointees
and the remainder were being selected only indirectly in Saturday's
complicated balloting procedure.
   One of four main political parties in Museveni's coalition
government boycotted the election, saying it was being held ``in
order to hoodwink citizens into keeping (the government) in power.''
   Critics also pointed out that tens of thousands of displaced
people in northern Uganda, the scene of fighting between rebel and
government troops, would be disenfranchised.
   Voters participated at the village level, electing nine members
to a so-called Resistance Council. The councils in each of the 149
counties meet to elect a nine-member executive committee. Members of
each committee elect from among themselves a representative to the
National Resistance Council.
   Museveni, who waged a 5-year brush war against former President
Milton Obote, seized power in February 1986, when his troops forced
from office a group of military officers who had ousted the civilian
president six months earlier.
   Obote led Uganda to independence from Britain in 1962 but was
overthrown by Idi Amin in 1971. Obote regained the presidency after
Imin was overthrown in 1978.

<HEAD>Report: Car Giant Sold Trucks To Pakistan Military Without Permit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Automobile giant Daimler-Benz sold
trucks to the military in Pakistan without proper export permits, a
news magazine reported Saturday.
   A spokesman for Daimler-Benz, Friedrich Loesch, denied that
export rules were broken, saying the trucks were ``multi-use
vehicles'' not specifically designed for military purposes. However,
he said they could be used by the Pakistan military.
   Der Spiegel magazine said that Daimler-Benz had sold Pakistan 237
trucks and 30 tractor-trailers from November 1986 through November
1987.
   The magazine said that customs officials in Cologne determined
that the vehicles were shipped to the Pakistan army without a
required export license.
   Der Spiegel said the shipments were not inspected by customs
officials because they were registered as civilian vehicles. Customs
officials later determined that the shipments were to be used for
military purposes, the magazine said.
   Loesch said the company had complied with all export license
requirements.
   ``These vehicles came out of mass production lines and can be
used for all kinds of transport, including military,'' Loesch said
in a radio interview.
   He said the company cannot tell the buyers how to use the
vehicles.
   In the radio interview, Loesch said he did not know whether the
company had negotiated the sales directly with military officials in
Pakistan.
   But he confirmed as correct the number of vehicles mentioned in
the Spiegel report.
   Export permits are required for the shipment of military
equipment or hazardous materials to areas of tension.
   Stuttgart-based Daimler-Benz is also a major exporter of luxury
cars.

   The yacht Thursday's Child, zigzagging north
against strong headwinds, should arrive in San Francisco Bay on
Sunday to beat by eight days the New York-San Francisco speed record
set 135 years ago, a spokeswoman said Saturday.
   ``It will be the early morning,'' said Sylvia Wilkerson, a
shore-based spokeswoman for the three-man crew. ``They just want to
get in.''
   Since Nov. 23, the 10-ton racing yacht has logged some 15,000
miles in a voyage around dreaded Cape Horn off the tip of South
America. The period included a stop at the Falkland Islands to make
repairs after the boat collided with an unknown object.
   In the past seven years, five other racing boats have been sunk
rounding Cape Horn in futile attempts to beat the record set by the
clipper ship Flying Cloud in 1854 _ New York to San Francisco in 89
days, eight hours.
   Saturday afternoon, an airplane with an Associated Press reporter
and photographer aboard spotted Thursday's Child about 10 miles
southwest of Santa Cruz and 75 miles from the Golden Gate. The yacht
was moving almost due north at 8 to 10 knots in about 15 knots of
wind.
   The crew _ skipper-owner Warren Luhrs, 44, Courtney Hazleton, 32,
and Lars Bergstrom, 54, who helped design the high-tech vessel _
were in for a welcome from hundreds of boats at the finish under the
Golden Gate Bridge.
   The news earlier Saturday was not so good. Shifting winds had
dropped to a slight breeze overnight as the boat struggled to
progress north. At midnight, the boat was making only 7{ knots, less
than 9 mph.
   Although tired from the constant tacking, which requires the crew
to leap from one side of the cockpit to the other to manipulate the
sail as the boat zigzags northward, the crew was well, Wilkerson was.
   Hazleton, talking over the radio one day last week, called the
adventure ``some of the finest sailing I ever had. I would do it
again at the drop of a hat.''
   But it was with awe and respect for the power of the sea that he
recalled the boat's navigation of Cape Horn, which is always torn by
roaring winds.
   `It got pretty bad ... very unpleasant,'' Hazelton said. He said
the vessel spent six days and nights sailing into the teeth of winds
gusting to 60 knots, through seas that raged against the boat from
all directions.
   The clipper Flying Cloud, a merchantman that also ferried Gold
Rush adventurers to San Francisco, could lay on 35 sails on its tall
masts. It was the fastest of thousands of sailing clippers that
raced each other across the Atlantic and Pacific.
   Ironically, the ship's record-setting performance in 1854
coincided with the beginning of the end of this country's sailing
commerce. In that year, U.S. shipbuilders quit clipper construction
because freight rates had dropped and the oak that went into the
ships became too expensive.
   Steam sealed the doom of the clippers. And the rocks off St.
Johns, Newfoundland, did likewise to the Flying Cloud in 1874.
Nothing is left of it.

   Rock singer Mick Jagger and residents
of the tiny eastern Caribbean island of Mustique denied a report
Saturday that pop star David Bowie was getting married to his
ballerina girlfriend.
   Jagger got off a British Airways Concorde from London at 11:30
a.m. in Barbados and then boarded a charter plane for the 25-minute
flight to Mustique. Before leaving Barbados, Jagger said there was
no wedding.
   ``I phoned his house last night and the security man told me he
(Bowie) wasn't there any more,'' said Jagger.
   ``There is no wedding. It's a rumor,'' said a man who answered
the telephone at Bowie's retreat in Mustique.
   Brian Alexander, managing director of Mustique Co., which manages
the island, also denied the report.
   An unidentified spokesman for the French branch of the record
company EMI was quoted by the French news agency AFP in Paris as
saying Bowie, 42, was to marry Melissa Hurley on Saturday.

   The crew of a F-4E fighter reported a
possible hydraulic problem before smoke filled the cockpit and the
pilot passed out, forcing another officer to make an emergency
landing, officials said Saturday.
   Both men were ejected from the jet as it taxied down a runway
Friday night at Baer Field, where their unit, the 122nd Tactical
Fighter Wing, is based. There had been initial reports that the
plane crashed.
   The pilot later died; the cause of death was not immediately
known, the Indiana Air National Guard said Saturday. An autopsy was
performed Saturday, but the cause of death will not be released
until the investigation is completed, said Allen County Coroner
Phillip O'Shaughnessy.
   ``The aircraft took off around 7:30 p.m. and reported a possible
hydraulic pressure problem. Shortly thereafter, smoke was reported
in the cockpit and then that the pilot was incapacitated for unknown
reasons,'' said a National Guard statement read by Tactical Sgt.
Joseph Manier.
   It was not clear where the smoke originated or if there was a
fire in the cockpit, as had been reported Friday after the incident.
   ``That hasn't been confirmed,'' 1st Sgt. James Snider said of the
fire possibility Saturday. ``It has been confirmed there was smoke
in the cockpit.''
   The Guard would not say how the unconscious pilot ejected or why
the men ejected while the plane was taxiing. On Friday, control
tower supervisor Larry Schneider said the plane crashed. But Guard
officials Saturday said the plane skidded several thousand feet and
stopped in the grass next to the runway.
   After the pilot, 1st Lt. Dave E. Kruse, 26, passed out, the only
other person aboard, weapons officer Maj. Wilbert J. Elliott, made
an emergency landing under the escort of another jet, the Guard said.
   ``He wasn't trained to fly the airplane,'' said Lt. Col. Rick
Clevenger said. ``It's (landing the aircaft) not an easy thing to do
even if you had experience.''
   Elliott was treated at Lutheran Hospital and released, and
returned to normal duty Saturday, the Guard said.
   Kruse, of Fort Wayne, was pronounced dead at Lutheran Hospital
after the landing, the Guard statement said. An autopsy was
performed Saturday but the cause of his death was not immediately
available, Manier said.
   Kruse was a full-time Guardsman, Manier said, and Elliott ``is a
traditional Guardsman, and as a civilian is self-employed.''
   A board of officers was appointed to investigate the accident.

<TEXT>
   Party chief Karoly Grosz said Saturday
that the Communist Party leadership has endorsed a multi-party
system but would continue to reassess a key chapter in Hungary's
history, the 1956 anti-Soviet revolt.
   The Central Committee, split between socialist hardliners and
reformers, ended a special two-day session aimed primarily at
assessing the emotionally and politically significant revolt.
   Grosz, who has said previously that a multi-party system in
Hungary is likely next year, told Hungarian radio that ``the party
has taken a stand that it accepts, takes note of and endorses a
multi-party system.''
   But the length and secrecy of the meeting indicated the party was
split over plans to share power with other parties and a host of
other reforms.
   Fifteen of the alternative political movements founded in recent
months said Monday they would not enter a coalition with the
communists, as some Communist Party reformers desire, unless the
party revises its view of 1956.
   Earlier, party spokesman Emil Kimmel told Hungarian radio the
``various platforms'' within the 108-member Central Committee
``sought unity on the fundamental issues,'' indicating a split.
   The Central Committee meeting was called after Politburo reformer
Imre Pozsgay shocked Hungarians by terming the 1956 revolt a
``popular uprising.'' It had been referred to for more than three
decades years as a counterrevolution.
   A source insisting on anonymity said Saturday the party had
compromised on a new official view of 1956.
   A Central Committee member, Gyula Horn, hinted at a possible
compromise Friday by saying the revolt may have started as a popular
uprising but turned into ``something which could be termed a
counterrevolution.''
   But Grosz said the party would continue to discuss the revolt.
But he, too, suggested Saturday that it began not as a revolt
against the socialist system but that ``counterrevolutionary
forces'' were quick to profit from the rebellion.
   He admitted that ``in our assessment of 1956 in these decades,
the role of counterrevolutionary forces played a leading part in our
propaganda and we forgot the feeling of the population.''
   The revolt began Oct. 23, 1956, with demands that Soviet troops
leave Hungary. About 20,000 Soviet troops entered Budapest to quell
the uprising on Nov. 4 and replaced the government.
   When he referred to the revolt as a popular uprising on Jan. 28,
Pozsgay said his reassessment was based on the report of a party
commission investigating four decades of communist rule in Hungary.
   The report has not been published, but Grosz said Sunday it would
be. He also said Pozsgay's comments were ``too hasty.''
   Pozsgay's statement touched off unprecedented open debate and
revealed the party split on the pace and extent of reforms.
   The state daily Magyar Nemzet said Saturday two of the new
groups, the New March Front and Smallholders' Party, already have
held talks on setting up national organizations before Parliament
legalizes alternative parties.

<HEAD>Judge Throws Out LILCO Racketeering Decision</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge threw out a $22.8 million
judgment against the Long Island Lighting Co. on Saturday, ruling
that federal racketeering laws do not apply in the fraud case
brought against the utility.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein said the case, involving
electricity rates, belonged before the state Public Service
Commission and should not have been brought to the federal court. He
said he became convinced the case did not belong him while presiding
over the jury trial in December.
   ``What the trial proved ... was that the (federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) cannot, and should not, be
applied in a case such as this to permit a federal jury in a civil
case to second guess the rate-making authority of the state,''
Weinstein said.
   Weinstein has been pushing for a settlement of the civil
racketeering suit brought against LILCO by Suffolk County on Long
Island. Kenneth R. Feinberg, a court-appointed mediator, said the
ruling puts pressure on both sides to reach a settlement.
Negotiators are scheduled to meet Monday.
   ``In light of the judge's ruling, it would be folly not to settle
this case,'' he said.
   Suffolk County said it would appeal Weinstein's ruling. LILCO
officials said they were pleased.
   Last December, a jury found that the financially troubled utility
had lied to state officials about the progress of the controversial
Shoreham nuclear power plant to obtain rate increases in 1978 and
1984. The jury awarded $22.8 million in damages to Suffolk County.
   That verdict opened LILCO to the risk of a class-action suit by
LILCO ratepayers, with damages against the utility potentially
reaching billions of dollars, far beyond the net worth of the
utility.
   LILCO had filed a motion before the start of the jury trial,
asking Weinstein to decide that the matter was not an issue for the
federal court under the RICO statute. Weinstein reserved judgment on
the request.
   Construction on the Shoreham plant, 60 miles east of Manhattan,
began in 1973 and was largely finished a decade later but has never
been opened.
   Legal objections to the plant by both state and local governments
and many Long Island residents have pushed the cost of Shoreham to
$5.4 billion, more than 70 times the original estimate.
   The controversy has taken LILCO to the brink of bankruptcy
several times.

   A small plane trying to make an emergency
landing at an airport Saturday sheared off the roof of a car
traveling on a nearby highway, killing a woman inside, police said.
   Doris L. Chase, 63, of South Yarmouth, died of massive head
trauma when the Piper Cherokee plane peeled off the roof of the car
in which she was a passenger, said state Trooper William Cisternelli.
   Her husband, who was driving, and the plane's three passengers
were taken to Cape Cod Hospital, where they were treated for minor
injuries and released, officials said.
   The pilot, Robert A. Feversanger, 27, tried to bring the plane
down on a highway near the airport when his airplane's throttle
apparently jammed, said state Trooper Robert Knott. The plane
crashed about 250 yards from the Barnstable Muncipal Airport, he
said.
   Police said Saturday evening the incident was still under
investigation and there were no charges pending against Feversanger.

   Anti-abortion protesters blocked entrances at medical clinics in
New Jersey, California and Florida on Saturday in demonstrations
that resulted in the arrests of dozens of people, officials said.
   In Los Angeles, more than 700 protesters on both sides of the
abortion issue demonstrated outside two medical clinics; more than
40 abortion opponents were arrested in Woodbridge, N.J.; and 87
people were arrested when they blocked a women's clinic in
Jacksonville, Fla.
   Abortion protest drew smaller crowds in Orange County near Los
Angeles and in northern California's Sunnyvale, where 16
demonstrators were arrested and cited, authorities said.
   In Woodbridge, police arrested and carried away some of the 350
people who blocked entrances to a medical clinic during a protest
dedicated to Nancy Klein, a comatose New York woman who received an
abortion Saturday morning in an attempt to help her recover.
Anti-abortion activist had tried to stop her husband from becoming
her guardian to authorize the procedure.
   Members from the Bi-State Operation Rescue Network sat outside
the clinic, sang religious hymns and hung on the building their
trademark banner that reads, ``Killing Factory Closed.''
   A Woodbridge police dispatcher said Saturday that 44 people were
arrested and charged with trespassing. They were released on their
own recognizance after agreeing not to return to the clinic until
their cases were heard in municipal court, said the dispatcher, who
refused to give her name.
   In Jacksonville, demonstrators blocking the entrance to an
abortion clinic went limp when approached by officers, resulting in
87 trespass arrests, officials said.
   Sheriff's Sgt. Steve Weintraub said the demonstration was
peaceful. He said protesters were taken into custody after they were
warned to leave clinic property. About 200 demonstrators carrying
picket signs remained after the arrests to continue their protest,
he said.
   In Los Angeles, more than 700 people, opposing and supporting
abortion, demonstrated outside two medical clinics, with
anti-abortion forces blocking entry to one clinic for several hours.
   Police in riot gear stood by but no arrests were made.
   The two groups clashed verbally, but no altercations were
reported. As the anti-abortion demonstrators locked arms and sang
hymns, the pro-choice activists shouted, ``Right to life, your
name's a lie, you don't care if women die.''
   ``It was a tremendous success,'' said Joseph Foreman, national
field director for Operation Rescue, the anti-abortion group that
sponsored the demonstration.
   Counterdemonstrators also claimed success, citing their large
turnout.
   ``I think it shows the country that pro-choice activists are
ready to do battle,'' said Betty Ann Downing of the American Civil
Liberties Union, one of the organizers for the Pro-Choice Coalition.

<TEXT>
   The pilot of an F-5E jet fighter from Taiwan that
crashed in China has asked authorities to help him find his uncle,
an official report said Sunday.
   The China News Service said Lt. Col. Lin Xianshun, 35, who
parachuted to safety Saturday, was looking for his uncle, Lin Yuyi.
   ``But authorities have yet to find the uncle,'' said an official
at the state-run news agency.
   The official, who would only identify himself as Zhang, said it
was not clear whether the pilot wished to defect to China.
   ``He has only raised this one request _ to see his uncle,'' he
said. ``We are trying to interview him but he is still in the
hospital.''
   Air Force officials in Taiwan said the fighter, which was on a
training flight, lost contact with a radio tower at Chihhang Air
Base, 180 miles southeast of Taipei on Saturday morning.
   The plane went down in a rice paddy in Fengshun County later that
morning, about 180 miles north of Canton, the provincial capital of
Guangdong province, Chinese reports said.
   Chinese reports said the plane crashed because it ran out of oil.
   Canton television reported Lin was taken by helicopter to the
China Air Force Hospital in Canton. A Chinese reporter Saturday
night said Lin was injured slightly on his backside and arm.
   In Taiwan, a relative of the pilot said he believed the officer
defected to China to see his grandmother. But the pilot's wife, Lin
Xuezhen, said she believed her husband had lost his way in bad
weather.
   The relative, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity
from Miaoli, 30 miles south of Taipei, said Lin had complained that
military officers were banned from visiting China.
   In 1987, the Nationalist government in Taiwan eased a ban to
allow all Taiwanese, except military personnel and government
employees, to visit China.
   More than a dozen Nationalist Air Force officers have sought
asylum in China since 1949 when the Nationalists fled to Taiwan
after losing a civil war to the Communist forces on the mainland.
   The latest was Li Dawei, who defected in 1983 in a trainer plane.
Li received $40,000 plus use of a chauffeured limousine. China late
last year abolished the system of rewards for Taiwanese military
personnel defecting to the mainland.
   The Taiwan still offers rewards for Chinese military defectors
but they reduced them in September when China stopped its rewards.
   China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and the two are
technically at war.

   A barn fire that could be seen six

had $107,000 in race winnings, officials and the owner said.
   Neither the barn nor the horses were insured.
   ``This loss is not in dollars. It is much more than that,'' said
Chester Gayheart, who owned the farm south of Yellow Springs. ``I
really don't know what I will do. It's going to take some time for
me to think.''
   Gayheart said he has raised horses for 30 years. Among the horses
killed was ``Our Lucky Bell,'' a mare that Gayheart said had won
$107,000 in multiple stakes races.
   The fire was discovered by Gayheart's daughter, who saw flames
from her house. Gayheart said she tried to save a prized horse but
was driven back by smoke and heat.
   Xenia Township Fire Chief Cliff Beegle said the blaze was visible
from Xenia, six miles away. The cause is under investigation.

<HEAD>Leaders Applaud Bush's Call for Vote on Puerto Rico Status</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEILA ANDREU CUEVAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>ASsociated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political leaders hailed as a
milestone on Friday President Bush's statement that Puerto Ricans
should vote on whether they want the Caribbean island to remain a
U.S. commonwealth, become the 51st state or be independent.
   ``We are living a historic moment in Puerto Rico,'' said Gov.
Rafael Hernandez Colon. ``I give the words of President Bush my
warmest welcome.''
   Hernandez Colon, who leads the Popular Democratic Party, and
other island politicians have been lobbying in Washington in support
for a plebiscite so Puerto Rico's 3.3 million people can vote on
their political future.
   Bush said in an address to Congress Thursday night: ``I have long
believed that the people of Puerto Rico should have the right to
determine their own political future. Personally I favor statehood.
But I ask the Congress to take the necessary steps to let the people
decide in a referendum.''
   His statement followed a joint call on Jan. 17 by Puerto Rico's
three main political parties _ divided over the status issue _ for
congressional support for a plebiscite. They asked Congress to pass
legislation guaranteeing the United States would honor the election
results, whatever the outcome.
   ``The people of Puerto Rico have not been formally consulted by
the United States as to their choice of their ultimate political
status,'' they said in a statement.
   Pedro Rosello, vice president of the New Progressive Party, which
advocates statehood, said the statement ``is the type of message we
were expecting from President Bush. When the president says he is in
favor of the process and asks for congressional cooperation, it
gives a seriousness to the issue which never before existed.''
   Ruben Berrios, who as leader of the Independence Party favors
breaking ties binding Puerto Rico to the United States, also
welcomed Bush's statement.
   ``The actual status is unjustifiable because the United States
can't continue supporting colonialism in Puerto Rico,'' he said.
   Hernandez Colon's Popular Democratic Party supports the
commonwealth arrangement, but wants Washington to relinquish control
over immigration and foreign trade matters.
   The emotional status issue has dominated the governor's agenda.
The three party leaders are to meet in Washington soon with key
House and Senate committee leaders.
   In a 1967 referendum, 60 percent of Puerto Ricans favored the
commonwealth status, 39 wanted statehood and 1 percent voted for
independence. However, the referendum was not recognized by the U.S.
Congress and Congress was not bound to take action no matter what
the outcome.
   Hernandez Colon wants to make sure that in any future referendum,
Congress will guarantee to abide by the results. Without that, he
has said, ``it would be an exercise in futility.''
   Under commonwealth status, Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, but
cannot vote for president. They have a representative to Congress
who cannot vote. They are eligible for U.S. military service and
receive billions of federal benefits annually, but they don't pay
U.S. taxes.
   Puerto Rico has been a U.S. commonwealth since 1952. Spain ceded
the island to the United States after the Spanish-American war in
1898.

<HEAD>Three Food Scares Prompt Government Action</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A food-poisoning scare prompted a government
warning Friday to pregnant women against eating soft cheeses, and
farmers were ordered to slaughter salmonella-infected chicken flocks.
   Britain faced food-poisoning scares on three fronts as police
were called in to investigate the mercury contamination of butter
from the country's largest producer.
   Sir Donald Acheson, the government's chief medical officer,
warned pregnant women not to eat soft cheeses such as Camembert and
brie after these were linked to several listeria infections in
Britain and abroad.
   The bacteria could cause miscarriages and stillbirths, he said.
   The Lancet, a British medical journal, reported last week that
two women infected with listeria suffered spontaneous abortions at a
British hospital, while two other listeria-infected women had to
have Caesarian operations to save their babies.
   Acheson said Camembert was safe to eat for everyone except
pregnant women. ``As far as listeria is concerned, the risk is so
small that it is quite appropriate for the rest of the public to
carry on as before.''
   Press Association, the domestic news agency, said the government
planned to set up a committee to examine all aspects of food
poisoning.
   Acheson listed several other measures the public should take to
avoid food poisoning. His remarks, at a news conference, reflected
heightened public alarm over food poisoning, which began in December
with a salmonella-in-eggs scare.
   Egg sales fell 60 percent after a junior health minister, Edwina
Currie, said most British egg production was infected with
salmonella.
   Confronted by lawsuits from angry farmers, Mrs. Currie resigned,
but the affair has prompted a major debate.
   Also on Friday, the Agriculture Department announced that chicken
flocks contaminated by salmonella would be slaughtered and their
owners compensated.
   It said new compulsory monitoring of Britain's 45,000 flocks had
been introduced. Compensation will be paid according to the bird's
value immediately before slaughter, said a spokesman, who requested
anonymity.
   It said the volume of compensation, and the number of birds
likely to be slaughtered, were not yet known.
   Egg producers and the National Farmers' Union welcomed the
announcement, and the opposition Labor Party said it showed that
``the government was at last waking up to the problem.''
   Detectives were called to a creamery belonging to Dairy Crest,
Britain's biggest dairy chain, in Camborne, in southwest England,
after mercury was found in a tub of butter at a central England
supermarket.
   Peter Reay, the detective leading the inquiry, said: ``At this
stage there is no evidence to suggest that contamination of the
product is widespread.''
   The plant where the contaminated butter was made is to close with
the loss of 118 jobs, but company spokesman John Friend said he
doubted the mercury was planted by a disgruntled worker.

<TEXT>
   A former Harvard professor and hospital director
who resigned his posts amid charges of plagiarism has been rehired
by the hospital, officials said Friday.
   Dr. Shervert H. Frazier, 67, a former director of the National
Institute of Mental Health, was named McLean Hospital's staff
psychiatrist and psychiatrist in chief emeritus, an honorary
position.
   Frazier stepped down as hospital director and psychiatry
professor at Harvard Medical School four months ago after a faculty
committee concluded he had plagiarized portions of four papers
between 1966 and 1975.
   His forced resignation sparked criticism from several leading
psychiatrists, who said Harvard officials had overreacted.
   ``If Sherv Frazier had done something like fudge numbers that
killed people, we wouldn't be having this conversation,'' said Dr.
Paul Jay Fink, president of the American Psychiatric Association.
``But when a review article quoted a number of authors and some were
not given full acknowledgement, I'm not sure he should have been so
severely punished.''
   Dr. Lawrence C. Kolb, a New York psychiatrist whose papers were
plagiarized by Frazier, said he was delighted by Frazier's
reappointment at McLean.
   ``I would hope that there would be some kind of a change in the
Harvard position as well,'' he said.
   Dr. Daniel C. Tosteson, dean of the Harvard Medical School, said
in a statement that the reappointment ``expresses appropriate
respect and gratitude for Dr. Frazier's many years of service as an

   Communist Hungary is likely to accede to
the 1951 U.N. Convention on the Status of Refugees, a United Nations
official said Friday. It is believed it would be the first Soviet
bloc country to join the accord.
   Ghassan Arnaout, from the Geneva-based U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, spoke at a news conference after a five-day tour of
Hungary and its camps for refugees from Romania.
   He said his group asked Hungary to become a party to the 1951
accord and ``I think there is a definite, good, genuine will of
Hungary to accede to the convention.'' Asked when, he said only,
``Soon, in the coming months.''
   An estimated 30,000 Romanian citizens, most of them ethnic
Hungarians, fled illegally across the border or declined to return
home from tourist trips since Hungary took the unprecedented step
last year of refusing to force such people back to Romania.
   Hungary says Romania is mistreating its 1.7 million ethnic
Hungarians, preventing them from studying their language and
customs. Warsaw Pact ally Romania rejects the charges, accusing
Budapest of meddling in its affairs.
   Economically strapped Hungary would welcome international aid in
looking after the people fleeing from Romania and in resettling them
here or elsewhere. Arnaout quoted Western diplomats as saying
Hungary might be reluctant to accede to the convention if it ran the
risk of becoming a haven for refugees from other communist nations,
such as Czechoslovakia and East Germanuy.
   He said this matter was not raised during his group's discussions
with officials.

<TEXT>
   The government is investigating reports of
illegal trading by all but one of Mexico's 25 stock brokerage houses
in connection with the 1987 market crash, an official was quoted as
saying Friday.
   Roberto Hoyo D'Addona, the country's fiscal attorney general, was
quoted as saying his department has received 50 complaints of
alleged stockbreaker fraud stemming from the crash.
   Investigations in five of those complaints turned up no evidence
of wrongdoing, he was quoted as saying by Mexico City newspapers.
   He said investigations by the Department of Treasury were being
carried out ``without regard to the political or economic power of
those involved.''
   ``There exist accusations against all of the brokerage firms
except one. The Treasury Department is only investigating if the
National Securities Law has been violated in order to tell the
(attorney general) whether or not crimes exist to prosecute,''
D'Addona said.
   He did not identify possible securities violations but said the
investigations were related to the October 1987 crash, when Mexico's
market index plunged by 74 percent in 28 trading days.
   The Treasury Department is to complete its investigations within
weeks, D'Addona said.
   Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo said his department
would begin legal proceedings when asked to do so by the Treasury
Department or the National Securities Commission.
   ``These are the instructions of the president,'' he said in
remarks published Friday.
   A congressional panel on Wednesday voted to call D'Addona, Deputy
Attorney General Luis Porte Petit and Oscar Espinosa Villareal,
president of the securities commission, to testify about the fraud
allegations.
   The request went to the Chamber of Deputies' Treasury Committee.
Hearings are expected to begin next week.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's political parties
on Friday agreed to talk with a delegation of guerrilla commanders
about a rebel proposal to participate in this year's presidential
election.
   The 13 political parties, however, did not agree to the rebel
demand that the elections be postponed from March 19 to September.
   The guerrillas' proposal to participate in the elections was made
on Jan. 24. Their demand that the balloting be delayed was strongly
opposed by President Jose Napoleon Duarte and the armed forces.
   Aronette Diaz, leader of the leftist Democratic Nationalist
Union, told a news conference that the political parties agreed that
the guerrilla proposal contains positive elements but that ``doubts
and questions'' about the offer would be expressed to guerrilla
leaders.
   Mrs. Diaz said the parties agreed to send their questions about
the proposal to the guerrillas on Monday. Three days after the rebel
response is received, she said, the parties will invite a delegation
of commanders ``to hold direct conversations in a mutually agreed
upon place.''
   Two guerrilla commanders had offered Thursday to travel to San
Salvador to initiate face-to-face talks on the proposal with party
and government representatives.
   The guerrilla offer to participate in elections was a drastic
shift. The Marxist-led rebels waging a 9-year-old war against the
U.S.-backed government have boycotted the five national elections
held this decade.
   The rebels contend elections are part of a U.S.-imposed
counterinsurgency project to put a civilian facade on a
military-dominated government.
   Meanwhile, in Costa Rica, two Salvadoran rebel commanders met
with Costa Rican President Oscar Arias to seek his support on their
proposal when he meets with fellow Central American leaders
beginning on Monday.
   Jose Mario Lopez and Mercedes del Carmen Letona told a news
conference in the Costa Rican capital of San Jose that they also
sent letters to presidents Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala and Jose
Azcona Hoyos de Honduras, seeking their support for the proposal.
   Arias, Cerezo, Azcona and Duarte, along with Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega, are scheduled to meet in El Salvador Monday and
Tuesday.
   The presidents are to discuss a stalled peace plan they signed in
Guatemala in 1987 which calls for political amnesties and an end to
civil wars in the region.
   The foreign ministers of the five nations on Wednesday asked the
United Nations to send a multinational force of inspectors to
Central America to verify that no country supports subversion
against their neighbors.

   A jury was selected
Friday for the court-martial of a U.S. Navy captain charged with
failing to rescue more than 80 Vietnamese boat people who later
resorted to cannibalism to survive.
   The first witnesses against Capt. Alexander G. Balian are to
testify on Monday.
   Balian, 48, of Los Angeles, is accused of violating lawful orders
and dereliction of duty after his vessel, the USS Dubuque, allegedly
refused to help a boatload of Vietnamese refugees in the South China
Sea on June 9.
   Navy officials said 110 Vietnamese sailed from their homeland,
and that at least 83 men, women and children were still alive when
their vessel met the Dubuque.
   United Nations and Navy officials said 31 of the Vietnamese died
after encountering the Dubuque about 210 miles north of the
Philippine island of Palawan.
   Survivors said two died of starvation and three others were
murdered and eaten by fellow passengers before Filipino fishermen
rescued the Vietnamese on June 27 after 37 days at sea.
   Balian, who won a Silver Star and a Purple Heart in the Vietnam
War, could face 4{ years in prison and a dishonorable discharge if
convicted on all counts, officials said. Four of the six jurors must
agree on a conviction.
   Balian has been charged with failing to rescue an unknown
Vietnamese who swam toward the Dubuque at risk to his life; failing
to rescue a second Vietnamese who tried to climb the warship's ropes
but was shaken off; and failing to render assistance to refugees
``in life-endangering circumstances.''
   He told investigators the Vietnamese boat was seaworthy and that
his crew provided it with food, water and navigational directions.
   During Friday's proceedings, defense lawyer Dan Donato, a retired
Navy captain, asked each of the jurors whether they knew enough
about the case to have formed an opinion. Each indicated he had not.
Donato then told them that if a vote were taken now, ``you're
supposed to vote not guilty.''
   Two prospective jurors, both captains, were dismissed on
challenges by both the prosecution and defense. The eight
prospective jurors, including six U.S. Navy captains, were brought
here from U.S. installations in South Korea, Japan and California.
   Navy officials said the Dubuque, an amphibious landing ship, was
en route to the Persian Gulf to assist U.S. minesweepers when it
crossed paths with the Vietnamese ship about 230 miles north of
Palawan.
   The Vietnamese reported the encounter with the U.S. ship after
reaching a U.N. refugee camp on Palawan, and Balian was relieved
temporarily of his command on Aug. 13.

   Worries about rising inflation and interest rates
touched off the biggest stock selloff of the year, depressed bond
prices and boosted the dollar's value against foreign currencies.
   The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 36.97 points to 2,286.07
on Friday, the biggest drop in the key market indicator since Nov.
16.
   An accompanying decline in the bond market was more modest, but
extended the losses bonds suffered Thursday in a selloff that was
the sharpest in three months for the credit markets.
   Meanwhile, the dollar rallied on the prospect that the Federal
Reserve Board might tighten its monetary policy _ pushing interest
rates even higher _ in an effort to choke off inflation.

   Two of 17 pro-Iranian terrorists whose freedom is a
key demand of a group holding American hostages in Lebanon have been
released from prison after serving five-year terms, the interior
minister said Saturday.
   The 17 were convicted in 1984 of bombing the French and American
embassies and given sentences ranging from five years to death. The
Islamic Jihad, which holds two American hostages, has demanded
freedom for all 17. Kuwait has refused.
   Interior Minister Sheik Salem al-Sabah said the two freed men,
Abdul-Mohsen Rashash Abbas, 25, an Iraqi, and 30-year-old Nasser
Matar Dahash, whose family lives in Kuwait without official
citizenship, were released ``a while ago, having completed their
prison terms.''
   The two are not considered key figures in the long-running
hostage drama. Salem did not say what date they were freed or where
they are now.

   A comatose woman on Saturday underwent an
abortion ordered by her husband in hopes of saving her life, ending
a two-week legal fight with anti-abortionists that reached the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   ``It's been a major battle. I am tired and wounded. I want to go
on with my life,'' Martin Klein said shortly after his wife's
abortion. ``No other family should ever have to go through what we
have gone through.''
   Nancy Klein, 32, remained comatose and was listed in guarded
condition after the abortion but her vital signs were stable, said
spokeswoman Carol Hauptman of North Shore University Hospital. A
team of doctors, including an expert on second-trimester abortions,
handled the procedure, she said. Mrs. Klein was 18 weeks pregnant.
   ``We have one other hurdle to overcome, and that is Nancy's
recovery,'' Klein said. ``I will live with this decision, but the

   Harris was greeted with a roar of approval from about 8,000

views.
   She was faulted by a conservative church member who said in a
brief speech that her elevation would be a sacrilege. But when the
chief consecrator, the Most Rev. Edmond Browning, asked the
congregation if it was their will that Harris be ordained, they
thundered out: ``That is our will.''
   ``I will obey Christ and serve in his name,'' Harris said.

   The stock market's early-1989 rally has hit its
first snag, but the optimists of Wall Street profess not to be
concerned.
   In the face of negative news on inflation and a renewed rise in
interest rates, a stretch of five consecutive weekly gains that
coincided with the start of the new year came to an end this past
week.
   Many analysts say they wouldn't be surprised if the
``correction,'' or period of retrenchment, lasted a while longer.
   But the bulls argue that such a sequence would actually represent
a happy development for investors who didn't get a chance to join in
the party earlier.
   ``Signs that the current rally is maturing continue to pile up,''
said Joseph Feshbach, technical analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities, in his latest market appraisal.
   Over the next few weeks, Feshbach says, the market may well
undergo a ``consolidation'' in which the major averages fall
somewhere on the order of 4 percent to 7 percent.
   But he contends ``the bull market is just beginning'' for
industrial stocks in particular. ``Since we remain very bullish long
term, we suggest using the coming consolidation as a buying
opportunity.''
   Similarly, the Merrill Lynch Market Letter says a ``fairly
shallow'' pullback is in prospect over the near term.
   ``We think a renewed advance in the spring could carry the Dow
industrials to the 2,500 area before a more significant correction
might occur.
   ``A change in investor psychology appears to be contributing more
to the bullish atmosphere than any changes in the outlooks for the
economy or corporate profits. Investors appear more willing to
accent the positive than the negative.''
   This new upbeat spirit got a stern test in recent days when the
Labor Department reported a much larger-than-expected rise of 1
percent in the producer price index for January, and banks across
the country raised their prime lending rates from 10.5 percent to 11
percent.
   The producer price increase, the biggest in more than three
years, intensified expectations that the Federal Reserve would soon
tighten credit further.
   At the close on Friday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
stood at 2,286.07, down 45.18 from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.49 to 164.01
on the week; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market dropped 3.98 to 402.37, and the American Stock Exchange
market value index was down 2.11 at 322.77.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 191.09 million shares a day,
against 186.79 million the week before.
   While brokers naturally like the revived enthusiasm for stocks,
they are wary of seeing too much of a good thing. If everyone
becomes a believer in the market, they reason, the rally that
results could be explosive but short.
   Memories remain fresh of what followed the high spirits and
complacency that prevailed for much of 1987.
   At the moment, however, most observers say a healthy amount of
skepticism persists.
   ``A good sign _ options traders are still pessimistic,'' asserts
the Merrill Lynch letter. ``Trading in puts (options to sell stock)
remains fairly high in relation to trading in calls (options to buy
stocks).
   ``We interpret this indicator on a contrary basis, so recent
readings appear to be a favorable sign for stocks.''
   While optimism has been increasing steadily among investment
advisers, reports Investors Intelligence of New Rochelle, N.Y.,
measures of sentiment ``are still bullish and lots of cash is still
on the sidelines.''

   Don't look for a sexy swimsuit issue from the
latest offspring of Sport Illustrated.
   Sports Illustrated for Kids is aimed at the 8-to-13-year-old
crowd, and publisher Ann S. Moore promises the only people the
magazine will show in bathing suits will be competing in sports like
swimming, water skiing or surfing or else will likely have ``an
Olympic gold medal around their neck.''
   The magazine was launched in January after Mrs. Moore secured
quarter-million dollar commitments from 30 advertisers. Half the
500,000 circulation is sold by subscription or, starting with the
March issue, at newstands.
   The other 250,000 copies are given free to third- through
sixth-graders in 1,000 of the poorest schools in the nation.
   They include places like Carter Elementary School on Chicago's
South Side, where the head of the reading resources program, Jessie
Hamlet, says few students could afford a magazine subscription.
   ``My teachers have been so grateful to have them,'' she said.
``The kids love it. They say things like, `You mean it's ours to
keep?'''
   She hopes the magazine will encourage students to read.
   ``It's something current and the look of it is so nice that it
makes them want to pick it up and read it. That's half the battle
there,'' she said.
   Those are reassuring words to Moore, who says she worked more
than 18 months on developing and launching the magazine.
   Improving literacy was one of the pitches she used in persuading
companies such as IBM and AT&amp;T, as well as sneaker and snack makers,
to pay $250,000 each for a year's worth of advertising space.
   But the motivation isn't entirely altruistic. The magazine is
expected to make a profit eventually, Mrs. Moore said. She said it
also should produce some readers for ``Big SI,'' as she calls the
magazine that spawned it.
   A year's subscription costs $15.95 and single copies will sell
for $1.75. The free copies come with tips for teachers on how to use
the issue in class.
   Jeanne Mannings, a health and physical education teacher at
Adamsville Elementary School in Atlanta, said, ``I set aside one day
a month to go through each article with them to practice their
reading skills.''
   For advertisers, the magazine is supposed to offer an appealing
new avenue to youngsters who are often hard to reach with print ads.
   Mrs. Moore estimates there are 16 million youngsters in the
magazine's target audience, and said they spend $5 billion a year of
their own money and influence another $40 billion spent by their
parents.
   But at $25,000 a page and a guaranteed circulation of 500,000,
the advertisers are paying a premium over other magazines aimed at
children.
   Boys' Life magazine, for instance, charges $17,650 for a page and
has a monthly circulation of 1.3 million. Scholastic Inc. charges
$10,000 for a page in Junior Scholastic magazine with a bimonthly
circulation of 700,000.
   Mrs. Moore said she tried to avoid making her magazine something
that youngsters ``perceive to be good for them.''
   The January issue profiled basketball's Michael Jordan,
football's Doug Williams, sled racer Susan Butcher and described the
ride two 10-year-olds took in a blimp. Each issue has regular
sections explaining rules of the game, advice from the pros, a
celebrity's description of his or her worst day, a poster of an
athlete, training tips, sports quizzes and trading cards.
   Some advertisers developed unique approaches.
   Foot Locker's ads ask who was first to achieve athletic feats,
such as who first shattered a basketball backboard. Converse shoe
ads address questions children have directed to athletes such as
football's Bernie Kosar.
   American Airlines' ads trace the history of flying machines.
   Mary O'Neill, an American spokeswoman, said the carrier wants to
impress on children that American is a quality company. ``When they
start thinking about careers, we hope they think American Airlines
might be a real good place for them to work,'' she said.
   Publisher Moore makes no apologies for sending a magazine with
paid ads into the school rooms. ``We have researched this with
teachers and parents and they welcomed the idea of having a real
magazine with ads,'' she said.
   Some types of ads such as cigarettes or liquor are prohibited and
she hopes to keep the proportion of ads to editorial copy low.
   Teachers said advertising is a small price to pay for the
benefits of getting a quality magazine free.
   A school official in Oakland, Calif., who asked not to be
identified by name, said her teachers have used the magazine to
teach students how advertising works.
   In Chicago, Ms. Hamlet said she has heard no complaints about the
ads.
   ``Wouldn't that be nice (if the magazine carried no ads) but the
real world isn't like that,'' she said.

   If a decade of airline deregulation has proven
anything, it's the strong get stronger, the weak get weaker, bad
labor relations are poisonous and cheap fares may be secondary to
new planes and swank service.
   All those elements melded together in the jungle of airline
competition this past week and seemed to underscore the idea that
Darwin's survival of the fittest theory is profoundly reshaping the
landscape of U.S. carriers, 10 years after Congress unleashed them
to set fares and routes on their own.
   American said it was acquiring new McDonnell Douglas Corp. jets
in a deal that analysts said could be worth as much as $7 billion,
potentially one of the biggest fleet modernizations ever. The MD-11
jumbos and smaller MD-80 twinjets would replace American's aging
DC-10s and Boeing 727s.
   American's announcement came against a background of rising
concern about the safety of older planes, no matter how well they're
maintained.
   The enormous metal stress caused by repeated landings and
takeoffs has been increasingly mentioned as a possible source of
trouble, and some analysts say it has influenced the public's
perception about which airline to fly. If that's true, the carriers
with the newest planes stand to sell more seats.
   American wasn't the only airline to buy planes this past week.
Northwest Airlines said it ordered 10 Airbus A330 jetliners worth
$860 million. The high-tech planes are built by the European rival
to Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
   Both airlines are among the biggest and most profitable in the
country, partly because they have relied on a strategy of improving
service instead of simply slashing fares, industry analysts have
said.
   While American and Northwest were shopping, Eastern Airlines was
scrambling to plan for what could be a devastating walkout in March,
a key month for the money-losing airline because it is the height of
the Florida vacation season.
   Eastern's militant machinists vowed to strike because of an
impasse over labor concessions demanded by management, an issue that
has inflamed passions at the airline for years and played a role in
Eastern's steadily eroding base of customers.
   In a prelude of what may come, the airline suspended 100
wildcatters and Eastern's pilots hinted they may honor any picket
lines.
   The fighting coincided with an announcement by Eastern's parent
Texas Air Corp. that it lost $224.4 million in the last three months
of 1988 and $718.6 million for the year, the worst in aviation
history. The previous record was held by Pan Am Corp., which lost
$485 million in 1982.
   Pan Am, meanwhile, dropped hints of its own problems. The
airline's chairman, ex-Texas Air aide Thomas Plaskett, told an
industry seminar that Pan Am must expand operations to survive. One
way to do this, he said, is through an acquisition of Pan Am by
another airline.
   In other business and economic developments this past week:
   _Disappointment with President Bush's budget strategy, a sharp
jump in wholesale prices and other concerns about rising inflation
spooked Wall Street and sent the Dow Jones industrials reeling for a
weekly loss of 45.18 points.
   _Bush unveiled a plan to rescue the nation's ailing savings &amp;
loan industry that includes a $50 billion bond sale to fund
bailouts, higher deposit insurance rates and seizure of sick thrifts
by federal banking regulators.
   _Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s top high-yield bond trader Michael
Milken moved to block the firm's record securities-fraud settlement
with the government on grounds it violates his rights by denying him
his multimillion-dollar pay. There were also reports that talks
between Drexel and the Securities and Exchange Commission to
finalize the settlement had stalled.
   _The Financial Accounting Standards Board proposed a
controversial rule that would require companies to deduct billions
of dollars in profits to reflect the cost of retiree benefits. Many
companies are expected to fight the proposed rule.

   Some economists expect the nation's biggest banks
to raise their prime interest rates at least once more before
spring, even though the banks have just nudged the key rate up half
a percentage point.
   Major banks on Friday raised their prime rates to 11 percent from
10.5 percent to keep pace with rising rates on financial markets.
   It was the first increase of 1989 for the prime rate, which is a
benchmark for setting interest on a variety of consumer and
corporate loans such as adjustable-rate mortgages.
   Friday's increase put the prime rate at its highest level since
it reached 10.75 percent in late 1984. The last increase, from 10
percent to 10.5 percent, occurred Nov. 28.
   Chicago-based Continental Bank and Republic National Bank of New
York were the first to increase the prime and soon were followed by
Citibank, the nation's largest bank, and other money center banks.
   The increase had been widely expected by economists.
   ``It was inevitable,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of Wefa
Group, an economic forecasting service in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``Short
term interest rates have been trending upward.''
   The prime reflects a bank's costs of borrowing money, including
interest it pays on customer accounts, short-term certificates of
deposit and bonds, and as such mirrors rather than forecasts rate
trends.
   Market rates have been rising due partly to the Federal Reserve's
tightening of credit in an attempt to fight inflation.
   Records released Friday indicated the Federal Open Market
Committee, the central bank's policy-making body, decided in
December to boost interest rates to help hold down inflation.
   Short-term rates in the credit markets have risen more rapidly
than long-term rates in recent weeks. In an unusual situation
earlier this week rates on short-term Treasury securities briefly
were higher than those for long-term bonds, indicating investors
believed the Fed was tightening credit and that inflation would
decline in the long term.
   A government report Friday on inflation worsened the outlook for
interest rates and ``was really the last straw'' for the banks, said
David Wyss, chief financial economist for Data Resources Inc. in
Lexington, Mass.
   The Labor Department said its producer price index surged at an
annual rate of 12.7 percent in January.
   Rates rose in the credit markets after the Labor Department
report, as traders were convinced the jump in wholesale prices would
force the Fed to push interest rates even higher.
   The Treasury's 30-year issue was off nearly $5.65 per each $1,000
in face value in late trading. That boosted the yield on the bond _
which itself is considered a barometer of rate speculation _ to 9.04
percent from 8.89 percent late Thursday.
   The Fed could directly drive rates upward by raising its own
discount rate, the interest it charges on loans to commercial banks.
   However, Chimerine said, the Fed governors likely would take a
more indirect route, by putting further upward pressure on the
so-called federal funds rate, the interest banks charge one another
for overnight loans.
   Chimerine and Wyss anticipated there would be at least one more
jump in the prime rate before spring, especially if the government
issued more reports indicating a surging economy and soaring
inflation.
   Wyss predicted interest rates would peak before April or May
because the economy is likely to show some signs of slowing down.
One reason for a slowdown would be higher interest rates, he said.

   Worries about rising inflation and interest rates
sparked the biggest stock selloff of the year, depressed bond prices
and boosted the dollar's value in foreign exchange.
   The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 36.97 points to 2,286.07
on Friday, the biggest drop in that key market indicator since Nov.
16.
   An accompanying decline in the bond market was more modest but it
extended the losses bonds suffered in a Thursday selloff, which was
the sharpest in three months for the credit markets.
   Meanwhile, the dollar rallied on the prospect that the Federal
Reserve might tighten its monetary policy _ pushing interest rates
even higher _ in an effort to choke off inflation.
   Separately, the nation's biggest banks boosted their prime
lending rates by a half percentage point to 11 percent, the highest
level since late 1984 and a reflection of recent rises in other
rates.
   Roiling the financial markets was the Labor Department's report
Friday morning that wholesale prices jumped 1 percent in January.
   The increase was about twice as large as expected.
   Bond prices tumbled and interest rates surged higher within
moments of the report.
   ``In the first couple of minutes, there was absolute shock,''
said Elliott Platt, fixed-income research director for the
investment firm Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities. ``The market
went down hard.''
   Prices of the Treasury's 30-year bond, considered a sensitive
gauge of interest rate speculation, fell $10 for every $1,000 in
face value during a burst of trading after the report. Prices edged
back up later in the day in more subdued activity.
   By late trading, prices of the benchmark 30-year bond were down
about $5 for every $1,000 in face value and the yield jumped to 9.03
percent from 8.89 percent late Thursday.
   That loss came on top of Thursday's setback that saw the price of
30-year bonds sink $16.25 for every $1,000 in face value.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 18 points
after the first 30 minutes of trading, recoverted somewhat at midday
but deteriorated in the afternoon to finish with a 36.97-point loss
for the day.
   But the inflation report supported the dollar, which benefits
from speculation that the Fed will tighten credit and boost interest
rates, which make the dollar more attractive to foreign investors.
   By the end of trading in New York, the dollar traded at 1.8695
West German marks, up from 1.8475 late Thursday, and at 128.68
Japanese yen, up from 127.93 late Thursday.
   President Bush's budget message to Congress on Thursday also was
cited for the sour performance in the stock and bond markets, as
traders faulted him for failing to propose more aggressive steps to
trim the federal deficit.
   ``The markets looked at it as a warmed-over version of (former
President) Reagan's budget. Any changes were modest and around the
edges,'' said Gary Schlossberg, senior financial economist for Wells
Fargo Bank in San Francisco.
   Friday's increase put the prime rate at its highest level since
it reached 10.75 percent in late 1984. The last increase, from 10
percent to 10.5 percent, occurred Nov. 28.
   Some analysts said they expect further increases for the prime,
which is a benchmark for setting interest on a variety of consumer
and corporate loans such as adjustable-rate mortgages.

<HEAD>Milken Moves to Block Drexel Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s top bond trader
Michael R. Milken has moved to block the firm's record criminal
fraud settlement on grounds it illegally denies him his job and
multimillion-dollar pay.
   Attorneys for Milken on Friday asked U.S. District Judge Kimba
Wood to reject Drexel's $650 million settlement with the government
on the grounds it violates his constitutional rights.
   If successful, the motion could force prosecutors and defense
attorneys back into negotiations _ or possibly court _ after a
two-year investigation and settlement that allowed Drexel to avoid a
potentially lengthy and embarrassing trial.
   ``The prosecutor here is acting like a sheriff in the Wild West _
solely on his own initiative and in his wholly unfettered
discretion,'' said the motion filed with Wood.
   Milken is one of the biggest targets of a federal crackdown on
securities-law abuse and is expected to be indicted soon on fraud
and racketeering charges stemming from his powerful position at
Drexel, one of the nation's largest investment firms. The pressure
on him has intensified since Drexel agreed to cooperate with
prosecutors as part of its plea-bargain settlement.
   Details of the agreement, made public two weeks ago, also require
Drexel to withhold at least half of the money due to Milken's
brother, senior Drexel aide Lowell J. Milken, for 1988 and to
suspend him if indicted.
   ``The prosecutor seeks...to achieve indirectly what he could not
achieve directly _ to punish the Milkens through the imposition of
multimillion-dollar fines and the deprivation of their livelihoods
without indictment, hearing and trials,'' the 28-page motion by
defense attorneys said.
   ``This action both denies them due process of law and constitutes
an unconstitutional taking of property,'' it added.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Baird declined to comment on the
motion, saying the government would respond in court papers.
   Milken, who heads Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif.-based high-yield
``junk'' bond department, has been credited with pioneering the $175
billion market for these debt securities, used to finance takeovers
and the growth of small companies.
   The motion said his 1988 pay would ``greatly exceed $100
million,'' almost entirely through a yearly bonus tied to his
performance.
   Neither Milken has been charged with any criminal activity and
both have denied wrongdoing.
   ``This is the government using Drexel to take money that Michael
and Lowell Milken have already earned without bringing a charge
against either of them,'' said Michael Armstrong, an attorney for
Lowell Milken.
   The motion said the agreement violates their rights because it
precedes hearings on whether the Milkens committed any crime,
whether their property can be legally seized or whether there is any
lawful basis for suspending them.
   In settling criminal charges with the government, Drexel agreed
to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay $300 million in fines
and civil penalties. Another $350 million would be placed in an
account to settle potential civil claims.
   The agreement, reached Dec. 21 after two years of investigation
of the nation's fifth-largest securities firm, included allegations
of crooked deals with now-imprisoned speculator Ivan Boesky and the
defunct securities firm Princeton-Newport Partners.
   The pact remains subject to approval by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the court. Negotiations with the SEC
reportedly have stalled because of an SEC demand that Drexel move
its junk bond division to New York.
   Once approved by the SEC, the agreement is to be sent to Judge
Wood for final approval.
   In a separate letter to the judge, Armstrong said the plea
agreement was improperly filed with the court and should not have
been disclosed publicly until Drexel formally enters a guilty plea.
   Details of the agreement were revealed after U.S. Attorney
Rudolph Giuliani requested that the specific counts be unsealed.
Giuliani, who left office the week after the charges were made
public, made prosecuting Wall Street crimes a priority of his
five-year tenure.
   Drexel is one of the most profitable investment concerns in the
country with 10,000 employees worldwide.

   Attorneys for Ivan Boesky, the one-time stock
speculator who now works on a prison cleanup crew, are waiting for
indictments in a related Wall Street scandal before requesting his
early release, sources said.
   The lawyers reportedly are waiting to see whether disgraced
high-yield bond financier Michael Milken of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. is indicted in a case based on information supplied by Boesky
before moving to have Boesky's three-year term shortened.
   The attorneys believe an indictment of Milken would be further
evidence of the value of Boesky's information in weeding out Wall
Street corruption, according to sources close to the case, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   On Friday, Boesky attorney Robert McCaw said Boesky has not
applied for parole from the minimum security prison camp in Lompoc,
Calif., and has no current plans to do so.
   Boesky becomes eligible for parole on March 21. He began serving
his sentence at the 44,000-acre former military barracks about 150
miles north of Los Angeles last March 23.
   ``He will seek a parole hearing at the point where his advisers
think it is most likely he would get some kind of favorable
consideration,'' McCaw said. ``There has been no parole hearing date
scheduled. There is nothing imminent.''
   McCaw said there was ``no chance'' Boesky would be released by
March on parole and ``relatively little chance'' he would be freed
on a judge's order.
   Parole hearings at the 689-inmate prison, known as ``Club Fed''
because of recreation facilities including a tennis court and boccie
ball court, are held every other month and Boesky is not on the
March docket, Lompoc unit manager Jim Finley said.
   Under federal prison sentencing guidelines, Boesky's earliest
possible non-parole release date based on good behavior is April 4,
1990.
   Boesky, once Wall Street's best-known speculator in the stocks of
potential takeover targets, is now working on a prison cleanup crew,
McCaw said.
   He is likely to be released early only if Manhattan federal judge
Morris E. Lasker, who sentenced Boesky, rewards his cooperation in
helping nail other Wall Street felons.
   Last April, Boesky's lawyers asked Lasker to reduce his sentence
on grounds that information Boesky gave the government unearthed
other fraud cases, including the mammoth investigation of Drexel
that resulted in a record $650 million plea-bargain settlement in
December.
   The attorneys asked Lasker to wait until this past October to
hear their motion, but have delayed even longer.
   Sources close to the case said Boesky's lawyers are waiting to
see whether Milken is indicted on fraud charges before pressing for
Boesky's release.
   Milken is expected to be charged as a result of Drexel's plea
deal, in which the securities firm agreed to pay $650 million in
fines and restitution and plead guilty to six felony counts.
   Boesky could be expected to ask Lasker for a hearing on early
release ``fairly quickly'' after Milken is indicted, one source
said, adding that a pending final agreement on terms of the Drexel
settlement also could help Boesky's case.
   ``In the atmosphere of trying to show that his post-sentence and
present cooperation has shown real tangible fruits, it's better that
it's settled,'' said the source.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Baird said there has been no change
in the status of Boesky's case. He declined to comment on whether
the government would oppose any early release request.
   Boesky, 52, stunned the financial world in November 1986 when he
paid the Securities and Exchange Commission $100 million to settle
charges he illegally used nonpublic insider information to profit in
securities deals. He was banished from the securities business for
life.
   He then cooperated in a massive federal probe that has resulted
in criminal or civil charges in nearly two dozen cases in the United
States and Britain. In return, Boesky was allowed to plead guilty to
a single count of conspiracy to lie to the SEC.

<HEAD>Fed Traders Are Steam Boiler Operators Of American Economy</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: This column now replaces BC-Weekly Bonds.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Everyone talks about inflation. The steam boiler
operators of the American economy do something about it.
   The boiler operators are the little-known Federal Reserve
functionaries who add steam to the economy or take it away by
manipulating the reserves of the banking system.
   The importance of their manipulations became obvious Friday when
the Labor Department reported wholesale inflation in January
skyrocketed to an annual rate of 12.7 percent.
   It was apparent, too, when major banks raised their prime rate to
11 percent _ the highest level since 1984.
   The combination of high rates and high inflation leaves the
Federal Reserve in a delicate position:
   Should it push rates even higher and risk triggering a recession?
   Or should it leave rates where they are and risk allowing
inflation to rage out of control?
   The policy decisions are made in secret by the Federal Open
Market Committee, a group of 12 Fed governors and regional Fed bank
presidents.
   The people who carry out those decisions _ the steam boiler
operators _ sit on the eighth floor of an imposing Italian
Renaissance-style building near Wall Street, the home of the New
York Federal Reserve Bank.
   Joan E. Lovett runs the 20-person open market trading desk. She
reports to Peter D. Sternlight, who in turn answers to the Federal
Open Market Committee.
   Unlike ordinary bond traders, Fed traders usually enter the
market just once a day, and they don't care about profits. Their
only job is to keep excess banking reserves at the level specified
by the Open Market Committee.
   The bedrock assumption is that banks will lend up to the limit
permitted by their level of reserves. If banks get more reserves,
they will increase their lending. If they lose reserves they will
have to cut back lending.
   If the Fed wants to stoke the furnace of the economy, it buys
Treasury bills in the open market. The cash it spends for the
Treasury bills ends up as extra reserves on the books of commercial
banks. The banks increase lending and the economy expands.
   Conversely, selling Treasury bills drains reserves from the
banking system and banks have to cut back on lending.
   The Fed traders monitor the federal funds rate, which is how much
banks charge each other for the overnight loans they need to meet
their reserve requirements.
   The Fed can make direct loans to the banks at what it calls the
discount rate. But borrowing at the discount ``window'' is a
privilege, not a right, and banks use it sparingly.
   If the fed funds rate gets too high, the open market desk injects
reserves into the system by buying Treasury bills. If the rate drops
they sell bills.
   The Fed also trades in other government securities, but less
frequently. No small player, it typically does transactions of $2
billion or $3 billion at once.
   For short-term fine-tuning, the Fed can inject reserves
temporarily through repurchase agreements, known as ``repos.''
Customers sell Treasury bills to the Fed with the agreement to
repurchase them soon, usually the next day.
   To drain reserves temporarily, the Fed does matched sale-purchase
agreements, or ``matched sales.'' The Fed sells securities to
customers and agrees to buy them back a few days later.
   Not every Fed move is fraught with significance. For instance,
the Fed drains reserves every month to compensate for deposits of
government checks.
   In the face of turmoil in the markets and uncertainty about the
economy's direction, the goal of the Fed's steam boiler operators is
simply stability.
   ``Achieving this in the face of very large flows of funds in and
out of the economy which are not under our control, that's the skill
of the open market desk,'' said Peter Bakstansky, a New York Fed
spokesman.
