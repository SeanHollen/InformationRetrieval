   A leak of radioactive water at the state
University of New York at Buffalo's research nuclear reactor forced
the university to close the unit, the university said Tuesday.
   In a news release, the university characterized the leak as
``small'' and said there is no threat to public health or safety
from the facility, which is located on the school's south campus in
the northernmost part of Buffalo.
   Spokeswoman Linda Grace-Kobas said a little more than 300 gallons
of water from the reactor tank leaked into a storage tank. She said
authorities are trying to determine how much is still leaking.
   The university said the leak was discovered by the reactor's
staff Sunday afternoon, when a crew arrived to start it after its
weekend shutdown.
   The workers noted that the level of water in the reactor tank,
which is normally 30 feet deep, had dropped three inches.
   The university said the leak has been contained within the
reactor facility and is not reaching the public water system or
sewer system.
   Karl Abraham, a spokesman for the federal Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, said the NRC was told that about 2 gallons an hour were
leaking from the tank.
   Abraham called the leak a rare occurrence at a reasearch reactor
but not very serious because the water is not going out of the
facility. He said the radioactivity of the water is ``usually
extremely low.''
   Louis Henry, general manager of the facility, said the leak poses
no danger to the reactor but that the reactor was nonetheless shut
down to provide ``an additional margin of safety.''
   In addition to the NRC, Henry said the state Department of Health
have been notified. The reactor will remain shut down until the
cause of the leak is identified and repaired, he said.
   The reactor, which is managed by a private company, produces
short-lived radioisotopes for medical research and is also used to
study the effects of radiation on materials like reactor components
and radiation detection devices.

   Minneapolis Mayor Donald Fraser won his fourth
term Tuesday, and across the Mississippi River Jim Scheibel became
St. Paul's first new mayor in 13 years.
   In the state's largest city, Fraser defeated firefighter Jens
Peterson, 46, who finished a distant second in the Sept. 12 primary.
Both are Democrats.
   With all 182 precincts reporting, Fraser had 44,585 votes to
Peterson's 11,613.
   Fraser, 65, represented the Minneapolis area for 16 years in the
U.S. House before he lost a U.S. Senate bid in 1978. He has served a
record 10 years as mayor and outpolled Peterson, 46, more than 8-1
in the primary.
   In neighboring St. Paul, Democrat Scheibel, president of the City
Council, led independent Bob Fletcher, a police lieutenant, in a
race to succeed Mayor George Latimer, who is stepping down after a
record 13-year tenure.
   Scheibel had 36,003 votes to Fletcher's 27,783 with all 139
precincts reporting.
   Scheibel, 42, has served on the City Council since 1982. He won a
nine-way primary race with 45 percent of the vote to 26 percent for
Fletcher.
   Fletcher, 34, who has strong ties to the Republican Party, also
was elected to the City Council in 1982 but resigned before the end
of his term. He later made an unsuccessful bid for a state Senate
seat.
   The campaign has focused on property taxes, crime and drugs.
   The elections in the Twin Cities were non-partisan.

<DATELINE>HARSUD, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children draw sketches of their homes so
they'll remember them later. Their parents no longer repair their
huts. Traders don't bother to drum up new business.
   Harsud is one of 573 communities destined to be flooded in a
giant dam project that pits environmental concerns against India's
attempts at modernization.
   The government says the $15 billion project on central India's
Narmada River will irrigate drought-stricken farmland and provide
electrical power.
   Critics say it will displace a million people and destroy the
ecology.
   ``What is the use of the dam that will be our doom?'' said
Naginchand Sand, a local businessman.
   In September, leading environmentalists and 35,000 villagers
descended on Harsud, a town of 15,000, in a demonstration to
denounce the dam project as a ``human and environmental tragedy.''
   A man who runs a grocery store near Sand's fertilizer store said
he had planned to expand his business but after the dam project was
announced in 1987 ``all my dreams ended.''
   ``A sort of gloom descended on the village,'' he added. ``But now
with the massive protest there is fresh hope.''
   The Narmada dam project in Madhya Pradesh state is the largest
ever planned in the world. It envisages 30 major, 135 medium and
3,000 minor dams along the 805-mile river and its 41 tributaries. So
far three dams have been built.
   The river is one of the holiest to Hindus. According ancient
belief, it was formed by the tears of Shiva, one of the gods of the
Hindu trinity.
   The river originates in a pond 335 miles to the east of Harsud
and courses through lush forests, farmland and narrow rocky gorges
in a series of falls and twists before reaching the Arabian Sea on
India's western coast.
   About 21 million people, 80 percent of them tribespeople and
villagers, live in the Narmada basin, which is bounded on three
sides by mountains and on the fourth by the sea.
   If the river is dammed, 2,410 square miles of forests and
farmland _ an area slightly larger than Delaware _ will be submerged
and about 1 million people will be displaced, said Ashish Kothari of
Kalpavriksh, an independent environmental group. Other independent
groups agree with those figures, but no official estimates have been
made available.
   Harsud will disappear under 50 feet of water when one of the
major dams of the project, the Indira Sagar, is built 15 miles away.
   The government says the dams are necessary to bring ``an era of
prosperity'' to the valley because they will irrigate 20,000 square
miles of land in drought-prone areas of Madhya Pradesh and adjoining
Gujarat state.
   The project is also supposed to generate 2,700 megawatts of
electricity.
   As for the people who will have to move, the government says it
has prepared extensive rehabilitation plans, including monetary
compensation.
   ``Who wants money? I want my land. Will you feel nice if the land
that gives you food is drowned?'' said farmer Bhure Singh, who
traveled 155 miles on the roof of a crowded bus to demonstrate in
Harsud.
   Kothari of the environmental group said there won't be enough
land left in the area for so many people to live on if the dams are
built.
   To compensate for forest loss, the government plans to plant new
forests. Kothari maintained, however, they could not replace the
hundreds of thousands of species of plants and animals that may have
evolved over millions of years.
   Another objection is the project's $15 billion price tag, which
some economists say is a gross underestimate. The World Bank has
promised to lend India $450 million for the project.
   Gerald Fauss, a senior irrigation engineer with the World Bank,
said a project of Narmada's size is bound to create ``some
environmental disturbances.''
   ``But the trade-off is that thousands and thousands of people
benefit from it. We still feel that the project is technically and
economically feasible.'' However, Vijay Paranjpye, an economist with
the governing body of Indian universities, concluded in a study of
the project that it is ``economically not viable.''

   In the fashionable French trench, tacky khaki is out
and polyester is in.
   The berets can stay but unpleated pants got their marching orders
as the army paraded its new uniforms Tuesday at an unusual fashion
show.
   Not everyone was wild about the styles; some full-figured
soldiers complain they may have to wear girdles to squeeze into the
new skirt-pants for women.
   The parade showed blousons for all enlisted persons and straight,
pleated pants for men and women. The lighter fabrics and colors with
contemporary style and practicality make army gear look made more
for fashion than fighting.
   ``It was time for a change,'' said Gen. Gilbert Forray, chief of
staff of the army, who helped engineer the creation of the uniforms,
which had not changed for 40 years. The uniforms were ordered from
the house of Balmain.
   Balmain, who also recently redesigned uniforms for the French
police, was chosen after polls conducted within the army to
determine which cuts, colors and fabrics would best suit the needs
of today's army.
   The clothes were designed by Balmain's couture designer Erik
Mortensen and Patrick Aubert, head of the company's masculine
fashion department.
   The fashion parade, after opening with some flamboyant
red-white-blue braid-edged redingotes from the time of Louis XV,
displayed what the new officers, gentlemen and women will wear in
the service beginning in 1991.
   The new blousons with a shoulder-to-waist pleat are both sober
and chic. The clothes are topped with kepis for officers or sharp
berets with wheel-shaped pins.
   ``And thank heaven they didn't get rid of the kepi,'' said one
male fashion observer, who noticed that male officers would still
sport the hat silhouette as distinctive as Charles de Gaulle's.
   Khaki is out in the new military palette, a lighter shade of
putty or pewter called ``terre de France'' is in, and in a lighter
fabric _ a mix of wool and polyester, rather than heavy twill.
   ``It's more practical, a lot less gear is involved now, and it's
more elegant,'' said Capt. Denis Brunel.
   Except for navy blue uniforms for the infantry, the army will
wear the new greige, and women will no longer wear their slate blue,
but the same putty color as men.
   ``That's good, and makes women more the equal of men,'' said Sgt.
Patrick Gall. ``My wife is in the army too, she'll surely approve.''
   A layered look called ``modular'' means officers and gentlemen
can go without their coats even when confronting superiors. The
light cotton poplin shirts underneath have epaulets, tab pockets and
may be substituted for a jacket in warm weather.
   ``I think the uniforms look very good and easy to wear,'' said
Col. Abraham Vigilant of the artillery corps. ``They give an
impression of serenity, which we need in the army. I'm a philosopher
_ with my feet on the ground.''
   The only sticky problem, so to speak, is in women's skirt-pants,
a new knee-length pair of bermuda shorts with a wrapped skirt
covering.
   ``What about real women? I'm waiting to see how the new uniforms
will work out on us,'' said Sgt. Chantal Grosjean, a full-figured
soldier about 5-foot-4. ``A real woman has thighs and a stomach.
What happens with these uniforms? We might have to wear girdles.''
   And she also thought they might prove difficult in summer. ``We
have to sit around on those fake leather chairs all day long.''

   Mao Xinyu tries to lead a quiet life at a
prestigious Beijing university despite being the grandson of Mao
Tse-tung, the revolutionary founder of communist China.
   ``I'm just an ordinary student,'' says the shy, chubby sophomore,
who wears patched clothes and canvas army shoes. ``I have 20 classes
a week, and play badminton and Chinese chess with classmates.''
   The 19-year-old history major at People's University has seven
roommates in a cramped first-floor dorm room where he sleeps on a
bottom bunk and is known simply as ``Sixth Brother.''
   Yet, on Saturdays, a black military limousine glides up to take
the grandson of the Great Helmsman to an expensive health club,
where he enjoys the sauna.
   On Wednesdays, when he doesn't have class, the limo takes Mao
home, where he has his clothes washed and an army cook prepares
``good food.''
   And mail pours in from people across the country nostalgic about
Chairman Mao, who was virtually deified as a living god by millions
of adoring Chinese during his lifetime, and curious about his
grandson.
   Mao Xinyu is the only child of Mao's second son, Mao Anqing, a
retired Russian translator for the People's Liberation Army, and
novelist Chen Raohua, who wrote under the pen name Shao Hua.
   His home, where his parents and grandmother live, is near the
Summer Palace in northwestern Beijing. ``I can't tell you more than
that,'' he says with a chuckle. ``It's a state military secret.''
   His favorite class is the history of Sino-U.S. relations, and he
spoke excitedly about the recent visit to Beijing by former
President Nixon, who paved the way to normalizing ties between
Washington and Beijing in 1972 with his historic meeting with Mao
Tse-tung.
   Not that the elder Mao's place in history is entirely glorious.
   Western and Chinese historians alike credit him with the abortive
``Great Leap Forward'' of 1958-59, a drive to increase production
that ultimately plunged China into widespread starvation and
poverty. He was also behind the disastrous 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution, during which intellectuals and merchants were reviled,
schools closed and Red Guards spouting Mao slogans went on a
nationwide revolutionary rampage.
   ``History will judge him as a great man, a leader of great
ability, who made great contributions,'' Mao Xinyu says. ``But he
had some faults.''
   Despite his interest in politics, Mao declines to discuss the
pro-democracy protests that rocked China this spring, other than to
say ``of course'' he did not participate in the marches and
demonstrations.
   He does say, however, that vandals' splattering of the portrait
of Mao overlooking Tiananmen Square on May 23 ``made me mad. It made
all Chinese mad. It was just a couple of guys trying to attract
attention.''
   Mao attracts plenty of attention of his own, receiving bundles of
unsolicited mail.
   ``Ordinary people, students, intellectuals, they all write,'' he
says. ``Mostly they're nostalgic about Chairman Mao. But a lot of
them say they're very happy I've gone on to college.''
   Some are girls who ``just want to be friends.''
   Mao says someday he'd like to visit the hometown of Abraham
Lincoln and see the Lincoln Memorial in Washington. ``Lincoln was a
progressive capitalist revolutionary, uniting the North and South in
the civil war,'' he said.
   Mao also takes some philosophy courses. Asked who his favorite
philosophers are, he replies, ``Marx. And my grandfather.''

<HEAD>President To Meet White Extremist Leader</HEAD>
<HEAD>By DAVID CRARY</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk has
agreed to hold talks with the leader of the country's largest white
extremist group, the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement, his
office says.
   The meeting, to be held at an unspecified time this week, was
requested by the movement's leader, Eugene TerreBlanche, and
announced Tuesday.
   TerreBlanche's organization espouses the creation of a
whites-only nation in the northeastern third of South Africa.
   Its members often wear khaki uniforms with swastika-like emblems,
and TerreBlanche often ends his speeches with a Hitler-style salute.
   TerreBlanche asked for the meeting after de Klerk, who took
office in August, met with prominent black anti-apartheid activists
and declared his willingness to confer with leaders across the
political spectrum.
   The Afrikaner Resistance Movement has denounced de Klerk's
decision to ease restrictions on anti-apartheid protests and his
pledge to extend political rights to blacks.
   In July, TerreBlanche said de Klerk was ``not man enough'' to run
against him for a parliamentary seat. But de Klerk had to quit
Parliament to become president, and TerreBlanche decided not to run
for office.
   Cabinet ministers plan two other meetings this week related to
ongoing political controversies.
   _Foreign Minister Pik Botha is to travel Thursday to the
nominally independent black homeland of Transkei to confer with its
military leader, Gen. Bantu Holomisa. The 33-year-old general last
month announced he might allow the outlawed African National
Congress to operate in Transkei and has suggested holding a
referendum to see if homeland residents want to renounce their
``independence,'' which is not recognized by any foreign country.
   _Development Minister Stoffel van der Merwe and Deputy Foreign
Minister Leon Wessels were to meet today with the Rev. Frank
Chikane, general secretary of the South African Council of Churches,
to discuss the alleged maltreatment of hundreds of blacks by
authorities in Ciskei, another nominally independent homeland.
   Chikane said Tuesday that Ciskei authorities had bulldozed the
homes of more than 300 families who had sought to retain their South
African citizenship after their community, Nkqonkweni, was
incorporated into Ciskei.
   Chikane demanded that the South African government reassert
jurisdiction over the community, restore the demolished homes and
compensate for damages.
   More than 800 members of the community have taken refuge at a
Catholic Church in King Williamstown, near the Ciskei border.

<TEXT>
   Every night in thousands of Indian
villages, residents gather around a small television set in the
dusty main bazaar for news they once only got third or fourth hand,
if at all.
   Suddenly, people steeped in ancient tradition who seldom venture
beyond the next village are plunged into a world of historical
pageantry, costume drama, satellite sports or whatever Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi happens to be doing that day.
   In Bandikui, across the Rajasthan state and even in the most
backward of India's 550,000 villages, television has become the
primary means of education and the main source of information.
   Only about 20 million television sets serve the country's 880
million people. But Indians already have developed a love-hate
relationship with the government-run television network, Doordarshan.
   And Gandhi and the governing Congress Party, facing a general
election later this month, are well aware of the network's enormous
influence.
   Political analysts say the election is likely to be the most
uncertain in 22 years. There are no major national issues to swing
the vote as in the past four elections. And the governing party, its
popularity wavering, stands a chance of losing power for the second
time in modern India's 42-year history.
   ``It will be the first Indian election in which television will
have a major role to play,'' said political analyst Bhabani Sen
Gupta in New Delhi.
   In a nation with 36 percent literacy, the government still wields
a powerful monopoly over the two-thirds majority who depend on radio
and televison for information.
   Critics contend the coverage has become so biased toward the
prime minister that what is labeled news is merely propaganda for
the governing party.
   ``Television is becoming a serious impediment to free and fair
elections. It tilts the balance totally in favor of the ruling
party,'' said opposition leader L.K. Advani, minister of
Broadcasting and Information during the 1977-79 opposition
government.
   The government denies charges the network has become its
propaganda tool.
   Gandhi ``is not only the president of the ruling party, he is the
prime minister of the world's largest democracy. And what he says
and where he goes is news,'' said H.K.L. Bhagat, minister of
Broadcasting and Information. ``Does the Western media ignore Maggie
Thatcher or George Bush?''
   The controversy highlights just how far India has matured,
materially and politically, since Jawaharlal Nehru, Gandhi's
grandfather and India's first prime minister, declared television an
``expensive toy'' unsuitable for his poor country.
   Doordarshan, which means ``seen from afar'' in Hindi, debuted in
New Delhi in 1965 with black-and-white broadcasts. The network
expanded to other cities by 1972, adding to the country's rapid
progress in technology and the rising prosperity of the middle class.
   Color broadcasts began seven years ago.
   When Gandhi coasted to a landslide victory two months after his
mother's 1984 assassinatio television reached just 18 percent of the
population. But its influence was quickly noticed by the new
government.
   ``To a large number of Indians (Gandhi) is the first Indian prime
minister who is also a television personality,'' said Tavleen Singh,
a political commentator for the Indian Express newspaper, which has
been highly critical of Gandhi's government.
   ``Whereas Mrs. Gandhi used television mainly for political
purposes, rallies, important speeches, her trips abroad, Rajiv has
managed to go a step beyond and use it to project himself as a
person as well,'' Singh said.
   The Doordarshan network now has 18 stations and 340 transmitters
beaming to nearly 90 percent of India's villages and cities. The
entire country will be within reach by early next year.
   Critics contend the network's coverage has gone from generally
favorable to outright bias.
   The prime minister and his party have increasingly dominated the
20-minute English and Hindi-language nightly news programs. The
opposition has been given short shrift, with coverage often
highlighting inconsequential points of leaders' speeches and
frequently editing out criticism of the government, critics say.
   Such tactics have drawn fire from the English language-press,
which has dismissed the network as a ``pusillanimous propaganda
pustule.''
   Some reporters say the network often takes orders directly from
the prime minister's office and there is a huge amount of
self-censorship.
   ``No one wants to take a chance with the prime minister's
coverage. You never know what some hard-line party member will
object to,'' said one senior reporter, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Government officials defend their actions.
   ``This is the legitimate work of the Information and Broadcasting
Ministry,'' said Deputy Minister K.K. Tewari. ``It is our legitimate
duty also to rebut unjust criticism of the government.''

   Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk, elected as
president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, says he is
hoping to give the laity more of a role in running the church.
   ``I think we're moving out of a situation in which the only
person who was allowed to do anything in the parish was a priest.
And I think that's a healthy move,'' said Pilarczyk, archbishop of
Cincinnati.
   In the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, two of the six people in the
bishop's ``inner circle'' are women, and laypeople serve as
directors of religious education, visitors of the sick and youth
ministers.
   Pilarczyk, 55, was ordained a priest in 1959, became auxiliary
bishop of Cincinnati in 1974 and archbishop in 1982 after Cardinal
Joseph Bernardin left for the Archdiocese of Chicago.
   Pilarczyk said he is not sure he could have been a bishop in the
days before the Second Vatican Council in the early 1960s when many
prelates were ``brick-and-mortar'' men expected to be adept at
handling finances and building new churches.
   Since Vatican II, Pilarczyk said, what is expected of a bishop is
greater grassroots contact with the laity and more pastoral
attention to the personal needs of priests.
   Like his predecessor Archbishop John May of St. Louis, whom
Pilarczyk served as conference vice president, Pilarczyk is viewed
as a moderate who enjoys support from both liberal and conservative
camps.
   ``Pilarczyk will play just the role that's needed now. We want a
middle-of-the-road stance,'' said Monsignor Joseph Gremillion, a
scholar-in-residence at Notre Dame University.
   When asked what are the most important issues facing the church,
Pilarczyk mentioned abortion and euthanasia and economic issues such
as Third World debt and the rights of labor unions.
   In matters of public policy, Pilarczyk indicated a willingness to
compromise.
   For example, he said if the question was whether he would
tolerate abortions for rape and incest victims if the law were
changed to prohibit other abortions, ``the answer is probably yes.''
   Pilarczyk said he does not favor a general statement saying the
bishops' conference could tolerate condom education in public
schools if sexual abstinence was presented as the only morally
correct way to prevent AIDS.
   ``In saying that, you almost necessarily encourage people to
engage in premarital sexual activity,'' he said.
   A document on AIDS approved by the conference's Administrative
Board was criticized by some bishops for conditionally tolerating
condom education, and a second statement on AIDS that attacks condom
education is scheduled for a vote Wednesday.
   If Pilarczyk has a fault, according to the Rev. Thomas J. Reese
of the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University, it may
be that he relies too much on intellectual argument to win people to
his side.
   ``Sometimes, it takes more than that to persuade people,'' said
Reese, author of ``Archbishop: Inside the Power Structure of the
American Catholic Church.'' ``His one weakness may be he may not be
political enough.''
   Pilarczyk's term as president will run for three years.

   Japan's ambassador to the United States
had encouraging words about the future while marking the Treaty of
Portsmouth that ended the Russo-Japanese War 84 years ago.
   Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga visited a museum Tuesday to view
artifacts of the Treaty of Portsmouth, which was mediated by
President Theodore Roosevelt and signed Sept. 5, 1905, to end the
18-month war with Japan's victory.
   Matsunaga acknowledged his country's pre-eminence the global
marketplace, but said cooperation with the United States is
important to Japan.
   ``Japan needs the United States to survive, and Americans must
realize that Japan has become an indispensable trading partner of
the United States,'' Matsunaga said. ``Blaming and criticizing each
other will solve nothing. ... We must cooperate.''
   Matsunaga will complete 44 years of diplomatic service when he
returns to Japan on Nov. 18. He has served in Washington for nearly
five years.

<HEAD>State Orders Company to Remove Train Carrying Sewage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mississippi on Tuesday ordered a South
Carolina company to remove a train carrying 5,000 tons of sewage
sludge or face $2 million a day in fines.
   ``Mississippi is not a dumping ground for someone else's sewage,
and this order should ensure that we get rid of it,'' Gov. Ray Mabus
said in a statement announcing the order by the state Department of
Environmental Quality.
   The train, dubbed the ``poo poo choo choo,'' arrived Friday in
Moss Point just outside Pascagoula on the Gulf Coast after being
driven out of Louisiana by residents who complained of its smell.
The 63 cars covered with plastic are loaded with 5,000 tons of
non-hazardous, treated human waste from Baltimore.
   Under the order, GSX Chemical Services of Columbia, S.C., will be
fined $2 million a day retroactive to Nov. 3 if it doesn't remove
the waste.
   A hearing to allow the company to challenge the fines was
scheduled for Nov. 21, said Mike Goff, Mabus' adviser on
environmental issues.
   GSX Vice President Roger Davis said Tuesday night that the
proposed fine seemed excessive.
   In a telephone interview from his Columbia home, he said GSX was
considering sending the sludge to one of several landfills or to one
of several composting businesses and said he believed the company
would find someone to take the waste Wednesday. He declined to
identify the landfills.
   GSX contracted with Metcalf and Eddy Service Inc. of Baltimore to
dispose of 12,000 tons of the sludge from Baltimore's municipal
sewage system at a plant in White Castle, La. An unspecified amount
of waste still waits in Baltimore.
   Davis said the contract allows his company to return the waste if
it is turned away at White Castle, but the company in Baltimore
hasn't wanted to take it back.
   ``We probably aren't going to take any more of it since this has
been such a problem,'' he said.

   ``Chicken Soup'' was no cure-all for ABC, and its
star, Jackie Mason, says the show's cancellation is fine with him.
   The network Tuesday canceled the new series, saying it wasn't
holding its own in the Tuesday night spot following the hit
``Roseanne.'' The show's finale was Tuesday, even though three
finished episodes were awaiting broadcast.
   Mason, a rabbi-turned-comedian, played a Jewish ex-pajama
salesman in love with an Irish-Catholic widow portrayed by Lynn
Redgrave. TV Guide's editors in September had predicted ``Chicken
Soup'' as the most likely hit of the season.
   Mason said in a statement that there have been many ups and downs
in his life, ``but one thing that I know is that there are at least
20 million gentiles who now know what a real Jew sounds like.''
   Mason said he would continue to perform club dates, possibly put
on another one-man show on Broadway and work on other projects.
   ``Chicken Soup'' will be suceeded, starting Nov. 21, by
``Coach,'' which premiered last season and stars Craig T. Nelson as
a college football coach.

   Former Gov. George C. Wallace's new
hearing aids allowed him to carry on a conversation for the first
time in months without requiring others to write down what they
said, a hospital official said.
   Wallace was fitted Tuesday for the devices after doctors decided
he didn't need surgery to improve his hearing.
   Patricia Fetzer, public affairs officer at the Veterans
Administration Hospital where Wallace underwent tests, said that
Wallace ``has a high frequency loss. ... It won't be normal hearing
but it will be better.''
   She said the four-term governor recently had relied on others to
write down their messages after his old hearing aids became
ineffective.
   ``He looked in good spirits and he was a happy camper when he
left here,'' she said. Wallace will return later in the month to
pick up his new hearing aids.
   The 70-year-old Wallace has used a wheelchair since a 1972
assassination attempt. His hearing has been failing for years.

   The Duchess of York appeared at a program
encouraging children to read, but no one was sitting down with her
Budgie books: They weren't available.
   The former Sarah Ferguson led a group of schoolchildren Tuesday
at the Children's Museum of Manhattan to a table laden with books by
her publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster. The books didn't include ``Budgie
the Little Helicopter'' and ``Budgie at Bendick's Point.''
   Asked why, the duchess just smiled.
   ``It wasn't an event to promote the Budgie books,'' said Ken
Geist of Simon &amp; Schuster.
   To showcase Budgie ``would have been too obvious,'' said Francis
Corniche, a spokesman for the British Embassy. The stories are of a
helicopter that has adventures and doesn't like to bathe.
   The meeting between the 30-year-old duchess and youngsters was
organized by Reading is Fundamental.
   The duchess, who is married to Prince Andrew, has said she got
the idea for the Budgie character while taking helicopter lessons.
Andrew is a helicopter pilot in the Royal Navy.

   Humorist Art Buchwald will call several
prominent Hollywood writers, including director-screenwriter Billy
Wilder, as expert witnesses in his plagiarism lawsuit against
Paramount Pictures Corp.
   In the $5 million suit, set for trial in state court next month,
Buchwald contends the Eddie Murphy movie ``Coming to America'' is
similar to an idea called ``King for a Day'' that the columnist came
up with in 1983.
   Both stories involve African princes who come to the United
States and fall in love.
   The studio has denied the plagiarism allegations. Late last
month, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider denied a
motion by Paramount to dismiss the lawsuit.
   Plagiarism lawsuits involving ideas for films are complicated
because many people can be involved in working on a screenplay at
various stages of production.
   The 83-year-old Wilder, a six-time Academy Award winner whose
movies include such classics as ``The Lost Weekend'' and ``The
Apartment,'' is one of at least nine screenwriters expected to
testify on Buchwald's behalf.

company alleging breach of contract.
   Kanaly, who played J.R. Ewing's half-brother Ray Krebbs, filed
the lawsuit Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court against True North

   Kanaly, 43, says the companies failed to pay him $25,000 for
narrating a videocassette called ``Family Guide To Firearms and Gun
Safety.''
   The actor also claimed he is owed 3 percent of the wholesale
price of each cassette sold or shipped to retailers by the
distributor. Kanally said True North, which produced the video,
failed to pay or account for the royalties.
   A telephone call made to True North after business hours Tuesday

   NBC's Carroll O'Connor and Andy Griffith, who
went from sitcoms to dramas, are making serious problems for ABC's
Tuesday night comedy lineup.
   O'Connor in ``Heat of the Night'' and Griffith in ``Matlock''
knocked ABC's ``Roseanne'' down to fourth place last week, and
contributed to the cancellation of ``Chicken Soup.''
   NBC won the week and its own Thursday comedy block led the way.
``The Cosby Show'' was first, ``A Different World'' second and
``Cheers'' third. ``Dear John'' was sixth and the season premiere of
``L.A. Law'' was tied for ninth place, according to the A.C. Nielsen
Co. ratings.
   ``In the Heat of the Night'' was 14th and ``Matlock'' was 18th.
ABC's rival Tuesday night shows ``The Wonder Years,'' ``Who's the
Boss?'' and ``Chicken Soup'' respectively were 17th, tied for 19th,
and 23rd.
   ``Chicken Soup,'' starring comedian Jackie Mason, had been
expected by many to be the season's biggest hit. Instead, it had its
final broadcast Tuesday night.
   NBC was first last week with an average prime-time rating of
15.2, to ABC's 13.7 and CBS' 11.9. Each point represents the
percentage of the nation's 92.1 million homes with televisions.
   NBC also leads for the season-to-date and the November sweeps,
when local affiliates' advertising rates are in part determined by
the network shows' ratings. The ratings for the first seven weeks of
the season: NBC 15.0, ABC 13.7, CBS 12.6. For the first four days of
the sweeps: NBC 15.0, CBS 12.8, ABC 11.3.
   Here are last week's top 10: NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' ``A
Different World,'' and ``Cheers''; ABC's ``Roseanne''; NBC's ``The
Golden Girls'' and ``Dear John''; CBS' ``60 Minutes'' and ``Murder,
She Wrote''; and NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and ``L.A. Law,'' tied.
   NBC has been hitting ABC hard on Tuesday night, which has been
ABC's strongest ratings night. NBC won the night for the first time,
not including the summer months, since ABC moved ``Roseanne'' to 9
p.m. February. ``Midnight Caller,'' which stars Gary Cole, was 26th
for the week.
   ``Chicken Soup'' will be replaced by the return of ``Coach,''
starring Craig T. Nelson and Shelley Fabares.
   Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``Married...With Children'' was 51st for
the week.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was first in the news ratings. ABC
has won the past four weeks and tied with CBS the previous week. The
news ratings last week were: ABC 11.4, CBS 10.7, NBC 10.1.

   Voters rejected by a 2-to-1 margin Tuesday a
proposal that would have raised the salary of Texas lawmakers from
$7,200 a year to $23,300.
   ``It's a good thing there wasn't a ballot alternative that said
legislators' pay should be lowered,'' said Democratic state Sen.
Chet Edwards of Duncanville.
   With 83 percent of the state's precincts reporting, the pay raise
was defeated with 614,373 no votes, or 65 percent, to 327,823 yes
votes, or 35 percent.
   Another proposal that would have boosted lawmakers' daily expense
allowance from $30 to $81 was defeated 53 percent to 47 percent.
   Opponents of the pay hike noted that lawmakers meet only 140 days
every other year. Language in the amendment would strip voters of
the ability to approve future pay raises by tying lawmakers'
salaries to the governor's pay, which the legislature sets.
   Texas voters faced 21 ballot propositions.
   A $500 million bond issue that would provide money for water
projects statewide _ with $100 million dedicated to cleaning up
substandard communities on the Mexican border _ was leading by a 58
percent to 42 percent margin with 89 percent of the vote in.
   A $400 million bond issue for building prisons and mental health
facilities passed by 68 percent to 32 percent.
   Also approved was the removal of a 113-year-old provision
requiring Texas office-holders to swear they won their posts without
bribing anyone. The change passed by 69 percent to 31 percent.

<HEAD>`Spud Trust' to Market Potato Chips in Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The idea may sound a little flaky, but Ed and
Fritzi Cohen and their Russian partners insist they can turn a
profit on a joint venture to make ``upscale'' organic potato chips
in the Soviet Union.
   ``What you call a potato chip is almost unknown in the Soviet
Union,'' said Valeri Perekhvatov, one of two Soviet partners who
signed a joint venture protocol Tuesday with the Cohens.
   ``We believe that potato chips are a good snack, especially after
you have had a glass of vodka,'' he told a news conference called to
announce the venture, the Kartoshka Trust, which translates from
Russian roughly as the ``Spud Trust.''
   Not only will chips ease the crunch in the Soviet snack market,
said Perekhvatov, but by frying the chips down on the farm and
transporting the finished product, the partners hope to avoid one of
the most vexing problems of Soviet agriculture: the loss of up to
half of the crop in storage and transport.
   The Kartoshka Trust plans to start small, selling about 100 tons
of chips annually, to a very different market than served by the
Cohen's Tabard Farm Potato Chips.
   Tabard Farm accounts for a tiny fraction of America's annual $4
billion potato chip market. The Cohens say they grow
``environmentally sound'' spuds in the Shenandoah Valley of
Virginia, truck them to Aunt Annie's Potato Chip factory in
Pennsylvania's Amish country, and market them in a few tony stores,
restaurants and clubs in New York, Chicago, Washington and
Philadelphia.
   The Kartoshka Trust expects to market about 95 percent of its
spuds in regular Moscow stores, and about 5 percent in the Beriozka
stores and luxury hotels that cater to Western visitors and accept
only hard currency, Perekhvatov said.
   The Cohens said their low initial investment in the Kartoshka
Trust will help them avoid what has been a fatal trap for some
U.S.-Soviet ventures, a Soviet law that allows the foreign partner
to take home only the profits that are made in convertible Western
currencies.
   The Soviet government on Oct. 27 devalued the ruble for a limited
number of transactions involving foreign businesses, allowing them
to convert at 16 cents on the ruble. But for most transactions, the
rate remains at the inflated official level of $1.59, and the ban
remains on converting from rubles to dollars at the higher rate for
repatriating profits.
   But the Cohens said they were content to run a large ruble
surplus until they ``find solutions to what now seem to be
insurmountable problems'' of getting the money home.
   Besides, they believe they can obtain the right kind of potato
chip kettle for rubles, rather than dollars. Their only other dollar
expense is expected to be 10,000 bags for the initial market run,
plus plane tickets to Moscow to sign a more formal contract in
January, he said.
   The goal of the operation, at least for the American side, is not
large profits but helping the Soviets develop a new type of
small-scale food industry, said Fritzi Cohen, who was a founding
member of the Washington-Moscow Citizens Exchange, designed to
promote friendship between the superpowers.
   America is ``way ahead of the Soviet Union'' in chip technology,
acknowledged Perekhvatov, but the Kartoshka Trust will try to bridge
that gap by allowing the Soviets to start with a simple, manageable
process.
   The protocol signed Tuesday requires Perekhvatov's Moscow-based
Likino Cooperative, and the Zybina farm cooperative near the city of
Tula, to minimize their use of chemicals and synthetic fertilizers,
said Ed Cohen.
   And they will build what he called a ``one-kettle'' chip factory,
employing about a dozen people to clean, slice, fry, transport,
market and account for the potato chips, he said.
   ``Because of our small scale, we can help people who can handle
this get off to a good start,'' said Ed Cohen. ``We think that it is
a model for economic development in certain parts of the Soviet
Union.''

<HEAD>Pentagon Board Advises US to `Run Faster' on High-Tech Issues</HEAD>

   The Bush administration must ``run faster'' and
plan better to meet increased competition for civil and military
technologies from nations such as Japan and Korea, a top Pentagon
advisory board recommends.
   ``National security can no longer be viewed only in military
terms, but must include economic well-being as a key component. ...
This is a distinct departure from the past,'' said the Defense
Advisory Board, an independent group set up to counsel the Pentagon.
   ``The point is, it is not Japan's aggressive roadmap for the
future that is at fault. Rather, it has been our own inability to
get our act together and create a national vision and set of goals
of our own,'' the panel said.
   The panel issued a strongly worded report that said the current
policies for industrial cooperation and technology transfers ``are
no longer appropriate'' and may endanger American's global economic
and military well-being.
   ``Our economic, as well as our military security, depends vitally
on technological leadership. Technology is the new coinage of the
realm and ours has been seriously depleted. ... We cannot maintain a
lead by conservatism and protectionism. We must run faster!'' said
Malcom Currie, the chairman of Hughes Aircraft Co. and head of the
task group that issued the report.
   The report touched on the recent controversy over the joint
U.S.-Japanese development of the FSX fighter plane, which set off an
acrimonious debate in Congress over concerns about giveaways of U.S.
technology to nations eager to use American expertise to build their
own industries.
   Some in Congress were angry that the Japanese refused to simply
purchase the plane from the United States as a replacement for the
F-16, while others argued the deal promoted exchanges of technology
and helped the U.S. industries involved.
   ``The fragmented policies of the past, in which military security
and economic issues were separated, are no longer acceptable,''
Currie said in a letter accompanying the report. ``We must
acknowledge this new reality and act accordingly.''
   The report, which dealt with the so-called Pacific rim nations,
predicted their emerging economic bloc will be the most powerful by
the end of the century. It noted the U.S. commercial trade deficit
with those countries accounts for two-thirds of the overall U.S.
trade deficit.
   It called upon the administration to develop a ``coherent
policy'' for long-term U.S. cooperation with these nations in
defense, economics and technological growth, to maintain them as
military allies and achieve solid U.S. technological and industrial
strength over the long run.
   ``Our comparative industrial, manufacturing, and technological
strength has been eroded seriously over the last decade. This
erosion must be reversed so that we can enter cooperative ventures
involving technology transfer from a position of strength,'' the
panel wrote.
   The panel called for ``a thoughtful, tough-minded approach,'' and
recommended in particular that for U.S.-Japanese relations there
must be a ``mutually beneficial, two-way sharing of technology.''
   The report noted Japan's government and industry have worked
together to establish that nation as a dominant global player in
high-tech industries by the year 2000.
   ``A coherent U.S. policy for defense industrial cooperation is
necessary if problems such as those (that) arose with the FSX are to
be avoided in the future,'' the panel's report stated.
   ``U.S. policy must promote better coordination'' among such
agencies as the Pentagon, State Department, CIA, Department of
Commerce, and National Security Council and the Department of Labor,
the report said.
   The group said the nation lacks a ``policy framework'' to deal
with the complex issue and, among other things, called for the
formation of a high-level interagency group to propose such a
strategy to the president within six months.

   A government report says the harvest of most
1989 major field crops is completed or soon will be winding down.
   In the case of winter wheat, the 1990 crop has nearly all been
planted and is in ``mostly good to fair'' condition, although more
soil moisture is needed in some areas, the Joint Agricultural
Weather Facility reported Tuesday.
   ``Planting was 93 percent complete, four points ahead of normal''
as of the Oct. 30-Nov. 5 survey week, the report said. ``Planting
was complete or nearly complete in 13 of the 19 major producing
states.''
   However, winter wheat planting continued to lag behind normal in
Georgia and North Carolina.
   ``Rain was needed in the Great Plains, where the crop was mostly
good to fair,'' the report said. ``In Texas, the crop was mostly
fair. Russian wheat aphids were a continuing problem in portions of
the Pacific Northwest.''
   The facility is operated by the department's of Agriculture and
Commerce. Its reports cover weather and crop conditions only, not
estimates of yields or total production.
   This year's corn harvest was 88 percent completed by early
November, 10 percentage points ahead of normal, the report said.
Harvest was almost done in Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas,
Minnesota, South Dakota and Texas, and advanced sharply in Colorado,
Indiana and Michigan.
   But the report said corn harvesting lagged behind in Ohio and
Pennsylvania, while it was ``near or ahead of normal'' in the other
major producing states.
   The soybean harvest was reported 87 percent complete, 11
percentage points ahead of normal pace for this time. Farmers had
completed harvesting in Minnesota and South Dakota, and were almost
done in Illinois, Iowa, Michigan and Nebraska.
   Soybean harvesting made rapid progress during the week in the
Delta and eastern Corn Belt, with advances of 20 percentage points
or more in Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee.
   The cotton harvest advanced 12 percentage points during the week
of Oct. 30-Nov. 5, including major progress in Arkansas, California
and Mississippi, the report said.
   Other observations included:
   _Sorghum harvesting advanced 13 percentage points during the week
and was 85 percent completed, about six points ahead of normal. The
Texas harvest was 86 percent completed, the Kansas crop 80 percent,
and Nebraska almost done.
   _Rice harvesting was nearly finished in California, and
``producers were burning rice stubble as air quality regulations
permitted.''
   _Peanut harvesting was finished in Georgia and Virginia, and
continued in the Carolinas. In Texas, rain slowed the peanut harvest
in the hill country, while the Oklahoma harvest was about 20
percentage points ahead of normal.
   _Florida's harvest of fall vegetables increased seasonally. The
sweet potato harvest was at ``a near-normal pace'' in Louisiana,
Mississippi and North Carolina, and vegetable harvesting increased
seasonally in Texas' Rio Grande Valley.
   _Livestock pastures were said to be in fair-to-good condition in
the Delta and the East, and mostly fair-to-poor in the Great Plains
and the West.

   The Agriculture Department says a fungus from
Australia is showing up well as a natural killer of destructive
grasshoppers that threaten crops and rangeland.
   Jerry Fowler, director of the department's Grasshopper Integrated
Pest Management Project, said preliminary laboratory experiments
indicated the fungus _ Entomophaga praxibuli _ can infect and kill a
broad range of the pesky hoppers.
   USDA's Animal and Plant health Inspection Service said if the
fungus proves out, it could help lessen the need for chemicals to
control the pests. The project plan is to integrate the fungus with
research demonstrations in North Dakota next year, and also begin
experiments with it in Alaska.
   ``The fungus only affects grasshoppers,'' the agency said
Tuesday. ``Laboratory tests using doses at least 100 times greater
than any found in nature have repeatedly shown that the fungus
causes no harm to other insects and does not affect humans or other
mammals.''
   Grasshoppers are infected by the fungus directly through their
outer covering and usually die within 7 to 10 days. Laboratory tests
have shown that once established the fungus can also spread to
future generations of grasshoppers.
   The fungus produces spores that survive the winter in the soil,
waiting to attack the next year's crop of insects, the agency said.
Other biological control agents such as viruses and bacteria take
longer to be effective because they must be eaten before infection
can occur.
   Scientists isolated the fungus from grasshoppers during an
outbreak in Australia in 1985.
   The dry conditions in the Wanwibinda region of New South Wales,
where this fungus was discovered, were said to be similar to
America's northwestern rangelands where outbreaks annually infest
millions of acres of crops and livestock rangelands.
   ``We believe that further research and controlled introduction of
E. praxibuli in our project trials will increase our options by
providing and effective long-term biological control agency,''
Fowler said.

   Led by David Dinkins in New York, black
Democrats extended their hold on the nation's large city halls
Tuesday, winning first-ever victories in New York, New Haven and
Durham, N.C., and reclaiming the mayor's seat in Cleveland.
   On the West Coast, Norm Rice was leading in his attempt to break
the racial barrier in Seattle.
   ``These gains represent expansion for the group that was locked
out,'' said Jesse Jackson, the two-time presidential candidate who
is a possible mayoral candidate in Washington, D.C., next year.
   Rep. Bill Gray, D-Pa., the House majority whip and the nation's
highest black elected figure, praised Dinkins' election and said New
York voters ``have rejected the politics of fear.'' Dinkins
withstood late campaign attacks on his character and integrity.
   Democrat John Daniels, a veteran Connecticut state senator,
easily defeated Republican Alderwoman Robie Pooley to become New
Haven's first black mayor. In Durham, Chester Jenkins defeated
conservative candidate Nelson Strawbridge.
   In Detroit, veteran Mayor Coleman Young, who is black, won a
fifth term by defeating black challenger Tom Barrow, the man he
defeated four years ago.
   The off-year election put Democratic blacks in control of most of
the nation's big-city mayors offices. Chicago and Houston are now
the nation's biggest cities with a white mayor.
   Houston voters returned Kathy Whitmire to office Tuesday, and
Miami voters did the same for Xavier Suarez. In Pittsburgh, Mayor
Sophie Masloff -- who calls herself a ``Jewish grandmother,'' was
elected in her own right. She succeeded into office upon the death
in 1988 of Richard Caliguiri.
   In Cleveland, state Sen. Michael White defeated longtime city
council president George Forbes in a race that presented voters with
a choice between two black candidates to succeed white Republican
Mayor George Voinovich. Forbes and White both are black Democrats,
but their race was characterized by bitterness as White worked to
retire his former mentor.
   The urban victories came as L. Douglas Wilder sought election as
governor of Virginia to become the nation's first-ever elected black
governor.
   The candidacies of Wilder and Dinkins, the Manhattan borough
president, were noteworthy for their similar methods. Both ran as
mainstream, middle-of-the-road candidates who needed broad support
from white voters as well as near-total support from black voters.
   Both Dinkins and Wilder ran as soft-spoken moderates, far from
the fiery-preacher image of Jackson.
   ``Both of these candidates, who had a fairly similar strategy in
some ways, will be viewed as role models,'' said Linda Williams, a
fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School, specializing in race and
politics. ``For the future direction of black politics, there will
be a lot of inspiration about what can be done.''
   ``It symbolizes heightened security and maturity for white males
in America,'' Jackson said of Tuesday's elections. ``In the '60s we
integrated the lunch counters and the libraries. Now we are
integrating the psyche and the mind of white America.''
   In Seattle, Rice held a lead in early returns over Doug Jewett, a
Republican who authored an initiative aimed at ending mandatory
school busing, which emerged as a major issue in their campaign.
Rice charged it would lead to resegregation of schools.

   Jennifer Kissick of Carlsbad, Calif., was
chosen the 28th Miss Teenage America on Tuesday night in the seaside
community of Marina del Rey.
   Kimberly N. Tucker, 17, of Birmingham, Ala., was named runner-up
among 12 finalists in an event hosted by television actress
Khyrstyne Haje, star of ABC's ``Head of the Class.'' The 12 were
chosen from 10,000 entries nationwide.
   Miss Kissick, 17, receives a $15,000 college scholarship and
complete wardrobe from K Mart.
   The contestants were judged on their scholastic achievements,
general awareness, individual accomplishments, community service,
poise and appearance. The winner was determined by a week of
interviews prior to the pageant and on her poise in on-stage
interviews during the pageant.
   ``The program is not a beauty pageant or a talent contest, rather
it's an achievement program which recognizes outstanding young women
between ages 13 and 18,'' said contest spokesman Marc Powell.
   She will have her own monthly column in 'Teen Magazine, which is
the chief sponsor for the contest, and make personal appearances to
speak on issues important to teen-agers.
   The other finalists were: Candace Adams, 16, of Ralls, Texas;
Michele Renee Allen, 17, Roanoake, Va.; Tracy Leigh Bondy, 16,
Toledo, Ohio; Trina Clark, 16, Bellingham, Wash.; Samantha Harris,
15, Hopkins, Minn.; Virginia Baker Norton, 17, Jacksonville, Fla.,
Holly Rouse, 16, Hornersville, Mo.; Dawn Wade, 16, Goleta, Calif.;
Deirdre Dianne Walusis, 15, Youngstown, Ohio; Tracy Wong, 16,

   The Vermont Supreme Court, following a
poetic premise by Robert Frost, says good neighbors needn't help
keep up good fences.
   The five justices on Tuesday found unconstitutional a 1790 law
making a livestock owner and neighbor equally responsible for
maintaining the fence between their properties.
   The ruling came 75 years after Frost, Vermont's and the nation's
late poet laureate, published ``Mending Wall.''
   In the poem, Frost questions the springtime ritual of helping his
neighbor fix the stone wall between their properties, only to have
the old farmer respond, ``Good fences make good neighbors.''
   Frost wrote in part:
   `` ... Before I built a wall I'd ask to know
   ``What I was walling in or walling out
   ``And to whom I was like to give offense ... ''
   In Tuesday's case, offense was taken by Ernest and Louise
Choquette of Newport when adjoining landowners, Robert and Rose
Perrault, refused to help pay for a fence built to keep the
Choquettes' cows off the Perraults' land.
   The Choquettes sued the Perraults for the amount the town fence
viewer ruled the Perraults owed under state law: $316.
   Two lower courts ruled in the Choquettes' favor, but the Supreme
Court said the Perraults don't have to pay.
   The high court's ruling turned on the question of whether the
public good outweighed the state Constitution's ban on giving
special breaks to special groups _ in this case, landowners with
livestock.
   The court found it made sense in the 18th, 19th and early 20th
centuries to say the public good outweighed the no-special-interests
clause.
   ``The land was predominantly open and farmed, and rural
landowners were also livestock owners,'' Justice Ernest Gibson III
wrote.
   Without the fence law, livestock owners would be solely
responsible for keeping their animals from damaging their neighbors'
property, and solely responsible for the fence, the court said.
   But, Gibson wrote, ``As a result of changing land-use patterns,
the law more and more often applies to landowners without livestock.
In such situations, the fence law is burdensome, arbitrary and
confiscatory, and therefore cannot pass constitutional muster.''
   Many have misread Frost's view of shared fence-mending
responsibility as being positive, said Margaret Edwards, an English
professor at the University of Vermont.
   She pointed to a line in which Frost says,
   ``In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed
   ``He moves in darkness it seems to me ... ''
   ``The old farmer is really being put down,'' Edwards said,
``though it's done so gracefully it almost doesn't seem that way at
first glance.''
   She added, ``Robert Frost in my opinion would be very pleased to
see the court's decision to strike down the fence law.''
   Lawyer Robert Bent, whose argument prevailed at the high court,
said a lower court judge had cited the ``Good fences make good
neighbors'' line in his decision that the high court overturned.
   The Superior Court judge, Alden Bryan, ``sort of missed the point
that Frost was making, that his neighbor was holding onto hidebound
tradition,'' Bent said. He added that the legal argument paralleled
the poetic: that the Vermont fence law was a narrow-minded tradition
best discarded.
   The Choquettes' lawyer, Robert Davis, said he was disappointed to
have lost the case, but could understand the court's logic.
   Davis pointed to Gibson's comments about shifting land-use
patterns, and to a line from another poet named Robert: ``The times,
they are a changin'.''

<HEAD>Final Passage Given Bill Calling for Investigation of Eastern Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is ready to launch an investigation of
the Eastern Airlines strike but President Bush, who refused to
intervene when the walkout began eight months ago, may veto the bill
calling for the review.
   Legislation creating a House-Senate commission won final approval
Monday in the House. But the administration said its position had
not changed since last month, when it issued a statement saying the
measure was a candidate for a veto.
   The bill, approved on a voice vote, is a watered-down version of
organized labor's initial attempt to get Congress to demand that
Bush use his power to halt the strike by naming an emergency
mediation board. Bush said then that the dispute should be settled
by Eastern's unions and management.
   Instead of demanding that Bush intervene, the bill now headed to
the White House would create a four-member panel to recommend ways
to end the Eastern strike. It also would make suggestions for
maintaining competitiveness in the airline industry and for
protecting employees of air carriers that seek bankruptcy protection.
   Labor urged Bush to reconsider his veto threat.
   ``We urge the president to quickly sign this bill into law,''
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said in a statement. ``For the
president to do otherwise would strip the administration of any
pretense of fairness in this dispute.''
   Under the bill, a Democrat and a Republican from the House and
one each from the Senate would be appointed by their respective
leaders in Congress to the commission. The panel's report would be
due 45 days after enactment.
   Its recommendations, should they include presidential
intervention, would not be binding on Bush but could lead to
additional legislation.
   Eastern was struck by the Machinists' union March 4 and most
union pilots and flight attendants have honored the walkout. The
airline, owned by Texas Air Corp., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection five days after the strike began and although still
cash-poor has been rebuilding as a non-union carrier.
   The unions have contended that Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank
Lorenzo has siphoned Eastern cash and assets for the parent
corporation and wants to use bankruptcy to bust the unions, as he
did when Texas Air bought Continental Airlines, filed for Chapter 11
and then emerged as a non-union carrier.
   Texas Air has said concessions by Eastern's union workers were
necessary for it to remain competitive.

<HEAD>Senate Votes to Place Independent Watchdog in CIA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a spinoff from the Reagan administration's
Iran-Contra scandal, the Senate is moving to set up for the first
time an independent watchdog inside the Central Intelligence Agency.
   Senators voted 64-34 late Tuesday to keep the independent
inspector general provision in a bill authorizing U.S. intelligence
activities for the next two years.
   The provision, offered by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., would create
an independent CIA inspector general, nominated by the president and
confirmed by the Senate. The current inspector general is appointed
by the director and reports only to him. President Bush is strongly
opposed to the Senate plan.
   The intelligence bill later was passed on a voice vote and sent
to a conference to work out differences between it and a version
passed by the House last month.
   The House bill would retain the current system for appointing the
inspector general, but would require full access to the
investigator's reports and audits by the intelligence committees on
Capitol Hill. The House approach also is opposed by the White House
and would tempt a veto, the administration has said.
   In its Iran-Contra investigation two years ago, Congress
concluded the scandal escaped the notice of the CIA inspector
general because the office did not have ``the manpower, resources or
tenacity'' to uncover what had gone on.
   Among its recommendations was an independent investigator at the
agency like the arrangement approved by the Senate on Tuesday.
   The implication was that the agency's overseer had turned a blind
eye to the activities of his boss, then-CIA director William Casey,
who was deeply involved in the scandal that sent arms to Iran and
clandestine funds to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   ``Iran-Contra was a very significant event in our history and
there are some lessons to learn from it,'' said Sen. William Cohen,
R-Maine, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a
member of the special panel that investigated the scandal.
   ``We had the potential to have a government within a government,
selling assets and using the money to run operations with no trail,
no trace and no one would know,'' Cohen said. ``We nearly saw the
unraveling of a presidency.''
   Others, including Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., sought to
link the provision to a new Bush administration policy that will
free U.S. operatives to work with the plotters of coups in countries
like Panama, so long as the coup is not aimed at assassinating a
foreign leader. They argued stronger agency oversight would help
keep such a policy from running out of control.
   Several senators sought to strip out the new reins on the agency,
saying the restrictions would appear to be a slap at CIA Director
William Webster and could hamper the agency's ability to win
cooperation from intelligence sources and other countries.
   ``They wouldn't be dealing just with one organization, they would
be dealing with two parallel organizations that exist side by side,
with two chains of command,'' argued Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.
   Under the provision, the CIA director would be able to shut down
an inspector general's investigation if he felt it were dangerous to
national security, but would have to inform the congressional
intelligence committees of his action within seven days.
   The overall intelligence bill provides a blueprint for the
government's intelligence spending over the next two years. Most of
what the United States spends on such activities is secret, tucked
away in the Pentagon budget. But reports put the spending level at
upwards of $25 billion a year, most of it for personnel and spy
hardware like satellites, and lesser amounts for covert operations
overseas.

   Homeowners who feel burdened by the chore of
raking up autumn leaves might feel better if they consider the
plight of highway departments.
   Take Patrick Lucey, highway superintendent in the Buffalo suburb
of Amherst. He figures his city's trees will shed about 2,200
truckloads of leaves this fall.
   It'll take 80 workers, using 44 pieces of equipment, to sweep up
the 800 miles of curbs.
   In Cheektowaga, another Buffalo suburb, Highway Superintendent
Christopher Kowal will run seven leaf vacuums for 16 hours a day,
seven days a week to keep the streets clean. And even that isn't
holding off an estimated 200 calls a day _ many from irate residents
demanding better leaf service.
   ``It's crazy,'' Kowal said. ``These four weeks are my nightmare.
I dread it every year. We can deal with snow. We can deal with
everything but leaves.''

failing to pay bills for work on the mountain hideaway where he
married actress Melanie Griffith.
   The lawsuit filed Friday by Duddy-Viele Construction of Vail said
Johnson owed $95,813 from the $604,085 bill. It asked for an order
that the bill be paid before other liens on the property.
   Ten contractors who helped remodel the home filed liens over
unpaid bills during the spring and summer, according to the lawsuit
filed in Pitkin County District Court.
   Notification of the lien was sent to Johnson in Miami and at the
Vail address where he and Griffith were married on June 26 for a
second time.
   Johnson's publicist, Elliot Mintz, said he was not aware of the
lawsuit and could not comment on it.

   The nation's former chief thrift regulator says
he was asked by Sen. Dennis DeConcini to drop a rule barring risky
investments by the now-defunct Lincoln Savings and Loan Association,
whose owner was a major political contributor.
   Former Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Edwin J. Gray told
the House Banking Committee on Tuesday that DeConcini, D-Ariz., made
the request to him in an April 2, 1987, meeting in DeConcini's
office attended by three other senators.
   The four senators _ who received $1.3 million in contributions
arranged by Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr., who
controlled Lincoln _ all have acknowledged they were at the meeting
but denied knowledge of such a request.
   The others present at the meeting, Gray testified, were Sens.
John McCain, R-Ariz.; Alan Cranston, Calif., and John Glenn, D-Ohio.
   The other three senators, Gray testified, ``raised no objection
whatsoever'' when DeConcini proposed ``that I withdraw a duly
adopted regulation on behalf of their `friend' and their
contributor.''
   He quoted DeConcini as saying the senators would convince their
``friend'' to make more home loans if the regulation was withdrawn
until after it had been tested in the courts.
   ``It sounded like a quid pro quo,'' Gray said. ``It was a quid
pro quo.''
   The four senators, plus Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Michigan, now
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, also have acknowledged
meeting a week later with regional Bank Board officials based in San
Francisco who had been called to Washington to answer questions
about an ongoing audit of Lincoln.
   All five senators have been asked by the Senate Ethics Committee
to explain in detail their presence at the two April 1987 meetings,
but the Senate panel has begun no formal investigation.
   Bob Maynes, a spokesman for DeConcini, said his boss and the
three other senators have consistently taken issue with Gray's
description of the meeting.
   ``There were five people in that room _ Gray and the four
senators,'' he said, ``and all four senators have said on the record
that Gray is totally and completely inaccurate.''
   But Gray said a claim that he ``fabricated such a yarn ... simply
is not credible.''
   ``The fact that this meeting became public knowledge has deeply
embarrassed these senators,'' he testified. ``They have every reason
in the world to deny what Sen. DeConcini offered me in that meeting
because he was, evidently, speaking on their behalf.''
   His testimony came in the fourth of a series of hearings by the
House committee on why regulators waited two years after bank board
examiners concluded that Lincoln was acting in an unsafe and unsound
manner before seizing control of it.
   Federal regulators seized Lincoln last April and said they could
have to pay up to $2 billion to depositors whose federally insured
savings were lost through Lincoln's risky investments.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., the agency created by Congress to
clean up the thrift industry mess, filed a $1.1 billion suit in
September against Lincoln and Keating, alleging fraud and
racketeering.
   Keating, who has said he arranged several millions of dollars in
contributions to members of both political parties this decade,
purchased the 29-branch Lincoln S&amp;L in Irvine, Calif., in 1984.
   He also had been scheduled to testify Tuesday before the House
panel but his appearance was postponed for two weeks at the request
of his attorneys.
   Another witness Tuesday, Jack Atchison, refused to answer any
questions, claiming a Fifth Amendment constitutional right against
self-incrimination.
   Atchison was in charge of auditing Lincoln for Arthur Young &amp; Co.
in 1987 and wrote nearly identical letters to Riegle, McCain and
DeConcini that March supporting assertions by Lincoln's officials
that it was being harassed by bank board examiners.
   Shortly afterward, according to the House panel's chairman, Rep.
Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Tex., Atchison resigned from Arthur Young and
took a $900,000-a-year job with Lincoln's parent company, American
Continental Corp., which is chaired by Keating.
   In other testimony Tuesday:
   _Former California S&amp;L Commissioner Larry Taggert acknowledged
that four weeks before leaving his job at the end of 1984, he
approved a change in state regulations that allowed Lincoln to make
$900 million in direct investments that would have been forbidden by
a new federal policy.
   While still in office, Taggert was listed in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission as a board member of TCS
Financial, a San Diego investment consulting firm that Lincoln
bankrolled in January 1985 with a $2.89 million purchase of stock.
   _Former Bank Board Member Lee Henkel, who had more than $2
million in loans from Lincoln when named to the board in 1986,
testified that he recused himself from all decisions involving
Lincoln during his five-month term. He denied allegations by Gray
and others that his proposal at his first board meeting to
``grandfather'' exclusions for direct investments prior to December
1984 from the regulation was at Lincoln's behest.
   ``I had no idea at the board what was going on at Lincoln,'' he
said, adding that he had no conversations with Keating or any of
Keating's representatives before drafting it.

<TEXT>
   A $10,000 federal grant for an AIDS art show
that includes homosexual images is being reviewed by the National
Endowment for the Arts as a possible violation of a new
anti-obscenity statute.
   The NEA grant to Artists Space, a private, non-profit arts
institution in New York City, is the subject of week-long
negotiations between arts endowment chairman John E. Frohnmayer and
Susan Wyatt, the gallery's executive director.
   The issue was discussed Tuesday by board members of the Manhattan
gallery, but Ms. Wyatt refused to say whether any decisions were
made. She and Frohnmayer refused to discuss details of the
negotiations, but Frohnmayer said he believed the matter would be
resolved later this week.
   The NEA's tax-paid grant was awarded to Artists Space last July,
before Congress approved legislation inspired by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., that forbids federal support for artworks that ``may be
considered obscene'' by the arts endowment chairman.
   The endowment cannot force the New York gallery to return the
$10,000 in taxpayer funds. But Frohnmayer said in a telephone
interview the endowment's options include formally disavowing its
support for the AIDS show and persuading the gallery to refund the
money voluntarily.
   Ms. Wyatt said she alerted Frohnmayer to the content of the show
because she was concerned that Helms ``might not particularly like
this artwork,'' and she wanted to make the NEA aware of a potential
controversy involving one of its grants.
   Ms. Wyatt said the $30,000 exhibition includes images of gay
sexuality among the works by 23 painters, sculptors and
photographers that depict the emotional and spiritual effects of
AIDS on the artistic community. The show is scheduled to open at
Artists Space on Nov. 16.
   ``There is male nudity in the show, but I don't consider that
necessarily homoerotic,'' Ms. Wyatt said. ``There is also female
nudity, but no one has said anything about that.''
   It was the first time Frohnmayer has wrestled with the legal
implications of the anti-obscenity law regarding a specific NEA
grant recipient.
   The law, enacted last month, expressly forbids spending tax money
on ``depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual
exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts'' and
any other works that lack serious artistic or literary value.
   The congressional ban was prompted by a controversy over $45,000
worth of NEA grants to contemporary art institutes in Philadelphia
and Winston-Salem, N.C., that supported works by photographer Robert
Mapplethorpe and artist Andres Serrano.
   Helms and other conservative lawmakers criticized some of their
pictures as highly offensive, and sought to restrict the arts
endowment's grant-making authority.
   A touring exhibition of Mapplethorpe's work, which was canceled
in June by the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, included
homoerotic and sadomasochistic images and pictures of nude children.
Serrano was criticized for a photograph of a crucifix submerged in a
container of urine.
   The NEA gave $10,000 to Artists Space for the AIDS show before
the Helms legislation was approved last month as part of the
endowment's $171 million appropriation for the current fiscal year.
   The endowment, an independent federal agency, awarded $156
million in matching grants last year to about 800 individual artists
and 3,800 arts institutions.
   Frohnmayer told a weekend meeting of the National Council on the
Arts, a presidentially appointed body that advises the arts
endowment, the new law is ``extremely difficult to interpret'' and
is being implemented with caution.

performance and their handling of baggage, according to the
Transportation Department's monthly consumer report.
   The report released Tuesday showed airlines with their best
on-time performance since April and showed a decrease in the number
of mishandled baggage complaints against airlines but a slight
increase in other complaints.
   The data for September showed the 12 largest carriers reported
79.6 percent of their flights operated on time, an improvement over
the 74.6 percent that operated on time in August and the best record
since April's 83.4 percent.
   Mishandled baggage complaints filed against carriers averaged
7.25 reports per 1,000 passengers in September, compared to 8.19 in
August, the report said.
   Consumer complaints, the only category for which October figures
are available, increased from 1,104 in September to 1,143 in October.

<HEAD>Thousands of Hazardous Waste Sites Fail to Make Cleanup Lists</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of dangerous waste dumps never make
the Superfund list or any other federal roster of toxic sites,
according to testimony at a House panel hearing.
   The list is incomplete because the way EPA gathers information
and evaluates sites is seriously flawed, says the Office of
Technology Assessment.
   The General Accounting Office says the list is arbitrary and up
to 425,000 sites have yet to be put on any kind of federal list
despite potential harm to the environment.
   The two congressional research services presented their findings
Tuesday at a hearing of the House Government Operations subcommittee
on environment, energy and natural resources, headed by Rep. Mike
Synar, D-Okla.
   ``Many sites never enter the Superfund program because they fail
to be discovered or are discovered but are not entered into the
inventory of potential cleanup sites,'' OTA's Joel S. Hirschhorn
told the House Government Operations subcommittee on environment,
energy and natural resources.
   He said the EPA relies on information supplied it, from state and
local governments for example, rather than devising ways to seek out
data on hazardous waste sites.
   EPA also is ruling out too many sites from Superfund
consideration too early in the review stage to have a firm handle on
their potential harm, Hirschhorn said. He said EPA is sacrificing an
objective review of Superfund sites to the bureaucratic need to
manage its caseloads.
   A report released last month by Hirschhorn's office estimates the
EPA may have rejected as many as 2,000 sites for Superfund
consideration.
   The EPA said it could not challenge the figures because it did
not know how they were compiled, but it defended its early screening
process.
   ``Yes, we've processed more, but we've made better decisions,''
replied Henry Longest, director of EPA's Office of Emergency and
Remedial Response.
   The nearly 10-year-old Superfund program has resulted in the full
cleanup of 38 of 1,200 sites deemed to need immediate federal
attention, said Richard L. Hembra of the GAO, the investigative arm
of Congress.
   GAO estimates that between 130,000 and 425,000 sites may
eventually have to be evaluated for possible cleanup action, a
burden that will fall mostly on the states.
   The House Appropriations Committee estimated last year that a
Superfund cleanup costs on the average $21 million to $30 million.
   A GAO report released at the hearing said the evaluation of sites
for Superfund depends on an arbitrary numerical rating, adding that
a number of sites coming close to that cutoff score pose real
hazards even though they don't make the list.

<HEAD>Black-Bellied Whistling Ducks on New Duck Stamp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 25-year-old Minnesota wildlife artist is the
winner of this year's government Duck Stamp competition, besting
more than 600 other entrants for the award.
   A panel of judges on Tuesday selected an acrylic painting of two
black-bellied whistling ducks in flight by artist Jim Hautman of
Plymouth, Minn., as its choice for the next Duck Stamp, covering the
1990-91 hunting season.
   The federal stamps, which also are purchased widely by
collectors, must be bought for licenses to hunt waterfowl.
   The contest is perhaps the most prestigious in area of wildlife
art. Hautman also could earn as much as $1 million from commercial
printings and other royalties, although the government pays no money
for use of the painting.
   Five judges selected Hautman, who had entered the Duck Stamp
competition four previous times, after they sifted through the works
of 603 artists during two days of judging at the Interior
Department's auditorium.
   More than a million of the stamps with Hautman's design will be
sold for the waterfowl hunting season, bringing $12.50 apiece to the
government. Last year the Interior Department received more than $13
million from the sale of the stamps.
   Although the government sold nearly 1.4 million stamps last year,
the demand for the stamps has been declining in recent years. About
2.4 million stamps were sold annually in the early 1970s.

   Republican Mayor Sue Myrick held off a
last-minute challenge by a write-in candidate and retained her job
after a campaign that featured disclosures of drug use and marital
infidelity.
   Mrs. Myrick received 32,127 votes Tuesday, ahead of Al Rousso, a
write-in candidate who polled 25,868 votes, and Democratic
challenger Craig Madans, who had 10,380.
   ``I just want to thank God and the people,'' said Mrs. Myrick,
who in 1987 became the first woman mayor of the city of 300,000
residents.
   She said she planned ``to continue to do all the same things I've
been doing the last two years. I will deliver like I did the last
time.''
   Rousso, a businessman, dropped out of the Democratic primary and
launched the write-in campaign last week out of disgust with the
tone of the Myrick-Madans race.
   Early in the race, Mrs. Myrick attacked Madans for his
acknowledged use of marijuana and cocaine while in college.
   Later it was disclosed that Mrs. Myrick, an advertising
executive, had an affair with her current husband, Ed, in 1973 when
he was married to another woman.

<HEAD>Floor Battle Looming in Senate Over Clean Air Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation to strictly control auto emissions
is advancing in a Senate committee, but faces future battles when
the full chamber debates the major initiative to clean the nation's
skies.
   The auto exhaust language won a razor-thin 7-6 victory Tuesday in
a Senate Environment and Public Works subcommittee, after Democrats
refused a GOP request to delay a vote while alternatives were
considered.
   The vote was along party lines, although future debate would be
more likely to find divisions between supporters and critics of the
auto industry.
   The industry and the Bush administration opposed the Senate
language, which will now move from the Environmental Protection
subcommittee to the full committee _ probably next week after the
panel debates acid rain provisions.
   The Senate bill would impose tough exhaust standards, now
required in California, starting in 1993 and require a second round
of reductions in 2003 that would be 50 percent stricter than the
California requirements. A rival House plan would only impose a
second round of reductions if a study showed they were necessary,
achievable and cost-effective.
   William Rosenberg, the Environmental Protection Agency's
assistant administrator for air programs, said ``it makes a lot of
sense'' to substitute a plan that would let automakers choose how to
cut emissions early in the next century.
   He said the cheaper choice, saving $7 billion to car purchasers,
would be to require automakers to build cars that can run on fuel
that burns cleaner than pure gasoline.
   The EPA and automakers said that going beyond the California
standards would provide only minimal pollution reductions while
raising the average cost of a new car by $500.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the subcommittee, disputed
the $500 figure, equating the cost of tailpipe reductions in the
next century to the purchase of ``a nice new hubcap.''
   The ranking subcommittee Republican, Sen. John H. Chafee of Rhode
Island, has drawn up a proposal that would let automakers choose the
method of pollution reduction, but he did not introduce it. He asked
instead for a delay in the vote and a hearing.
   Baucus refused to delay, saying a postponement would prevent him
from reporting a bill to the full Senate before Thanksgiving. He
agreed to hold a hearing on Chafee's plan Nov. 20, but any changes
would have to be proposed on the Senate floor, he said.
   The bill is not likely to be scheduled for full Senate debate
until early next year.
   ``We ought to look at oil companies'' to produce cleaner fuels,
Chafee said in support of his alternative. ``Why should they be let
off the hook in doing something on clean air?''
   Baucus said he would support an alternative fuels proposal that
would be added to the 2003 tailpipe emissions reductions, but would
not support the plan as a substitute.
   An alternative fuels proposal was a key part of President Bush's
clean air legislation. A House Energy and Commerce subcommittee
already has watered it down, and the issue will resurface before the
full committee.
   The Senate bill's pollution reduction requirements for
non-methane hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide would
take effect a year earlier than those in the major clean air
legislation approved by a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: The Good, the Bad and the Un-Ugly of Negative Campaigns</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says sure, he'd like to see
cleaner campaigns. But he won't apologize for the hardball tactics
that produced his lopsided victory over Democrat Michael Dukakis a
year ago today.
   ``I don't have to stand here and defend the campaign of 1988. I'd
be perfectly prepared to do it, but I was elected,'' the president
asserted. And why argue with success?
   Bush told a news conference on Tuesday: ``I put confidence in the
American people _ their ability to sort through what is fair and
what is unfair, what is ugly and what is un-ugly, and be as positive
as possible.''
   Anyway, negative campaigning, like un-ugliness, may be in the eye
of the beholder, Bush suggested. ``What some consider negative,
others consider factual,'' he said.
   Bush wasasked his views on the negative campaigning that marked
this year's gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey and the
mayoral race in New York City _ tactics that might have been
borrowed, after all, from Bush's own 1988 campaign playbook.
   ``I think everybody would prefer the positives ... But I'm not
sure there is much that a president can do about it,'' Bush
reflected.
   He said candidates must be permitted to get their message across
in their own way, and that any restrictions on that message would
amount to censorship.
   Still, he continued, ``Maybe I can have a role in seeing that it
gets a little more positive.''
   The Virginia and New Jersey races included negative campaigning _
largely from the Republican side in the final days of the Virginia
race, and with both candidates in New Jersey comparing each other to
a lying Pinocchio, complete with growing noses.
   Democrat L. Douglas Wilder claimed victory over Republican
Marshall Coleman in Virginia's gubernatorial race, while Democrat
James Florio easily defeated Republican James Courter in New Jersey.
   Bush relied heavily on negative campaigning in 1988 _ from his
frequent attacks on Dukakis' patriotism to the constant airing of
ads on the rape of a Maryland woman by convicted murderer Willie
Horton while on a weekend furlough from a Massachusetts prison.
   In the concluding weeks of last year's race, then-Vice President
Bush would vow on one day to wage a gentler, kinder campaign. Then,
the very next, he would attack Dukakis as a ``card-carrying member''
of the American Civil Liberties Union who would torpedo prosperity
and bring gloom and malaise upon America.
   Sometimes he'd voice positive lofty themes in a morning
appearance, then breathe fire later in the day.
   Bush campaign ads, in addition to dramatizing abuses of the
prison furlough program that Dukakis oversaw as Massachusetts
governor, ridiculed his rival's ride in an Army tank and appeared to
equate his veto of a pledge of allegiance bill to disrespect for the
flag.
   One of the chief architects of Bush's attack campaigning, media
adviser Roger Ailes, resurfaced this year in the GOP New York
mayoral campaign of Rudolph W. Giuliani _ as did Bush's 1988
political strategist, Bob Teeter.
   Bush campaigned this fall for the GOP candidates in New York,
Virginia and New Jersey.
   The president said Tuesday he still has ``great confidence'' that
Americans made the right decision one year ago.
   ``I think they sorted through some of the allegations that this
was the ugliest, dirtiest campaign. And I think they voted on a more
positive basis,'' he said.
   Bush reiterated a view expressed often during the 1988 campaign
by his campaign manager, Lee Atwater, now the chairman of the
Republican National Committee, that American politics were rife with
negative campaigning from the very beginning.
   ``I don't say anything started in 1988 that hadn't been taking
place in '86 or '82 or '80,'' Bush said. ``You know, if you look
into history, you're going to have certain things that are
considered negative.''
   ``I think it ought to be a little more positive ... (But) what
else can you do?'' he asked. ``I'm certainly not going to legislate
it.''

<HEAD>Salvadoran Leftists Demand Prosecution In Death-Squad Murders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCOS ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After three of its members were
kidnapped, tortured and shot to death, a leftist political party
blamed military men and demanded that the local army commander turn
them in for civilian prosecution.
   The slaying of the young activists of the Social Christian
Popular Movement, discovered Tuesday, comes a week after 10 people
were killed in the bombing of a leftist labor union's downtown
headquarters.
   Leftist political leaders blame the military for both incidents,
which reflect a rise in attacks on civilians in the 10-year-old
civil war.
   There are widespread fears that rightist death squads are again
on the prowl after lying low for four years.
   Julio Flores, a Social Christian spokesman, said military men
dressed in civilian clothes seized the three party members Monday
night after a meeting in Sonsonate, a provincial capital 40 miles
west of San Salvador.
   The victims were found dumped on Sonsonate's outskirts Tuesday
evening bearing all the hallmarks of the death squads: they had been
tortured, shot repeatedly, and a hand-lettered sign nearby said they
were ``executed'' because they ``betrayed the fatherland,'' Flores
sad.
   He said in a telephone interview that the party is demanding that
Sonsonate military commander Col. Juan Armando Rodriguez turn the
soldiers involved over to civilian judicial authorities.
   ``We hold those military officials ... responsible,'' he said.
   Flores identified one of the victims as Cecilio Rivera, the
movement's Sonsonate coordinator. He did not have Rivera's age or
the names and ages of the other two, he said, because of poor
telephone communications.
   Local judicial authorities ordered the three buried as
unidentified corpses shortly after they were found, but Flores said
party members were able to see the bodies and identified them.
   The slayings, a recent wave of bombings and other attacks have
threatened to scuttle negotiations for a cease-fire in the civil war
and to force leftist political groups back underground.
   Flores said Social Christian leaders ordered all party offices
and halls temporarily closed Tuesday because they did not want more
members killed. ``The authorities are threatening us, they do not
let us operate,'' he said.
   Most of the more than 70,000 people killed in the civil war were
civilians slain by the right-wing death squads from 1979 to 1984 on
suspicion of being leftists, according to the Roman Catholic Church
and human rights groups.
   Death squad activity dropped sharply in mid-1984 with the
election of President Jose Napoleon Duarte, a centrist Christian
Democrat, but attacks on leftists picked up when rightist President
Alfredo Cristiani took office June 1 for a five-year term.
   Leftist leaders accuse Cristiani's Republican Nationalist
Alliance, or Arena, of links to the death squads, which have
enlisted off-duty military and security agents.
   They blame the military for bomb attacks Oct. 31 on the National
Workers' Federation, or Fenastras, and Comadres, an organization of
relatives of political prisoners and people who have disappeared in
the war. The attacks killed 10 people and injured 33.
   Leaders of Fenastras and Comadres say the bombings were in
retaliation for a mortar attack the previous day by leftist rebels
on the Defense Ministry compound that killed one civilian and
wounded 15.
   On Oct. 19, a bomb exploded at the home of Ruben Zamora, the
Social Christian leader, but no one was hurt. The movement was
created in 1980 by dissidents who broke away from Duarte's Christian
Democratic Party.
   Zamora is a member of the Democratic Revolutionary Front, a
political coalition allied with the guerrillas. He returned to El
Salvador two years ago from exile after the Duarte government
promised an end to repression.
   To protest the Oct. 31 attacks, the rebel Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front canceled its participation in a third
round of cease-fire negotiations with Cristiani's representatives
set for Nov. 20-21 in Caracas, Venezuela.
   Earlier meetings in Mexico and Costa Rica resulted in deadlock,
but the two sides pledged to continue meeting at 30-day intervals
until they could agree on some kind of a truce.

<HEAD>Customs Says Problems With Radar Planes Investigated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Customs Service says it's
investigating ``everything from safety concerns'' to possible
management coverup of problems at the agency's Texas surveillance
center, where sophisticated radar planes are launched to locate
drug-smuggling aircraft.
   William Green, assistant commissioner for internal affairs, said
the investigation followed ``a lot of complaints'' about management
of the Surveillance Support Center in Corpus Christi, where the
high-tech P-3 airborne early warning (AEW) planes are based.
   Customs Service documents on the planes, most written by crewmen,
say the aircraft have serious electronic problems that have
diminished their ability to locate drug-ferrying aircraft and guide
other Customs planes pursuing the suspects.
   The internal affairs investigation could be joined by a House
probe. Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., a Government Operations
Committee member who has conducted numerous hearings on Customs air
operations, said Tuesday he asked Chairman John Conyers, D-Mich. to
hold hearings on the allegations.
   ``We've got to get to the bottom of this,'' said English, who was
instrumental in getting Customs the $27 million for its first P-3
AEW that arrived in June 1988; and more than $30 million for the
second AEW, delivered last April. Funding has been approved for a
third of the four-engine turboprops outfitted especially for the
drug war by Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co.
   The Customs investigation involves ``everything from safety
concerns ... to management being aware of problems and not taking
appropriate actions,'' Green told The Associated Press.
   He said the investigation could touch other centers in Customs'
air operations, which launch interceptor and pursuit aircraft.
   Peter Kendig, acting director of the Surveillance Support Center,
confirmed the agency's own investigation ``has been going on for
about four weeks. Internal affairs has not talked to anyone in
management. We encourage any investigations, whether from Congress
or internal affairs.''
   Asked about allegations of a coverup, Kendig said, ``There has
never been any intention by management to gloss over problems'' that
appeared ``in any official documents. All problems have been
identified and have been resolved or are being resolved.''
   One Customs source, speaking only on condition he not be named,
offered a different picture, saying problems documented in staff
memos ``were never reflected in any reports to headquarters. ...
We're still living with the same problems 15 months down the road''
from the arrival of the first P-3 AEW.
   The Surveillance Support Center operates seven detection
aircraft, with the two airborne early warning planes featuring
state-of-the-art equipment that Lockheed says outperforms U.S.
military surveillance planes.
   The AEW computer systems and graphic displays are designed to
locate plans the government estimates carry about half the cocaine
reaching the United States.
   Deficiencies noted in the Customs Service documents have included
a computer system that has trouble locating and tracking smugglers;
faulty on-board communications for the crew, and a problem with a
spinning, metal radar dome.
   Some reports critical of the performance of the aircraft were
ordered rewritten by an agency supervisor to stress success and not
failures, according to the documents and Customs sources.

   Texas voters rejected a pay raise for state lawmakers by a 2-to-1
margin Tuesday, and smoking curbs in Greensboro, N.C., the heart of
tobacco-land, were approved by the narrowest of margins.
   Meanwhile, New York City approved a sweeping charter change that
makes its government more representative.
   In Greensboro, where the tobacco giant Lorillard Inc., employs
2,000 workers and more than half the city's registered voters smoke,
limits on smoking in some public places were approved by 173 votes
out of 29,809 votes cast.
   With all 45 precincts reporting unofficials tallies, there were
14,991 votes for the curbs and 14,818 against them.
   The proposal would ban smoking in elevators and in certain
stores. Smoking limits would also require restaurants seating more
than 50 people to set aside a quarter of their seats for non-smokers.
   In Texas, with 3,880 of 6,621 precincts reporting, the proposal
to triple the current $7,200 salary of state lawmakers to $23,300
had 387,898 no votes, or 69 percent, to 174,365 yes votes, or 32
percent.
   A proposal to boost the expense allowance from $30 to $81 was
also rejected by 57 percent to 43 percent.
   But Texans were favoring the dropping of a 113-year-old provision
requiring state office-holders to swear they didn't bribe their way
into their positions. Voting was 373,192 votes, or 67 percent, in
favor of dropping it and 184,968 votes, or 33 percent, against
dropping it.
   The Texas ballot had 21 propositions. A $500 million water
measure to bring running water and sewers to disease-ridden border
towns was approved by a 56 percent to 44 percent margin, and a
proposal to spend $400 million on new prisons to ease overcrowding
was being approved by a 66 percent to 34 percent margin.
   New York City voters approved a charter change giving the mayor
more power, boosting the size of city council from 35 to 51 members
and abolishing the Board of Estimate. With 4,677 of 5,243 precincts
reporting, the measure received 442,883 yes votes, or 56 percent, to
354,430 no votes, or 44 percent.
   The city is under order by the U.S. Supreme Court to make its
legislature more representative.
   Taxes, gay rights and a new baseball stadium to keep the Giants
in quake-rattled San Francisco were among the local and statewide
issues at stake Tuesday. Voters in 10 states encountered 56
statewide ballot measures.
   Kansas City voters approved a quarter-cent increase in the sales
tax to raise $98 million over the next seven years to fight the war
on drugs. There were 29,464 yes votes, or 62 percent, to 17,877 no
votes, or 38 percent in the city. The percentages were similar in
Jackson County, which encompasses Kansas City.
   Maine voters were favoring ratification of a contingency contract
to dispose of low-level nuclear wastes in Beatty, Nev., and were
narrowly favoring the end of Navy testing of Tomahawk cruise
missiles over the state.
   With 517 of 666 precincts reporting, the nuclear waste disposal
contract was being endorsed with 85,638 yes votes, or 54 percent, to
71,735 no votes, or 46 percent.
   Opponents of missile testing maintained a slight edge. There were
84,929 votes to end testing, or 53 percent, to 76,324 votes, or 47
percent to continue testing. The referendum was non-binding.
   In Michigan, voters rejected two proposals that would increase
the state sales tax to generate $400 million for schools. The
measures were defeated by a better than 2-to-1 margin.
   St. Louis voters also rejected a four-cent property tax increase
to subsidize the St. Louis Symphony.
   In another issue dealing with taxes, Washington voters soundly
rejected a ``Children's Initiative'' to hike the sales tax by nearly
a penny per dollar to help raise at least $360 million a year for
smaller school classes, early childhood education, child-abuse and
drug education. The measure failed by 70 percent to 30 percent.
   In Utah, voters approved the spending of $56 million in state tax
revenues in hopes of becoming the host for the Winter Olympic Games
in 1998. The money is needed for ski jumps, a speed skating oval and
bobsled-luge runs.
   With 726 of 1,134 of the precincts reporting, or 64 percent,
there were 110,347 votes for, or 55 percent, and 89,045 votes
against, or 45 percent.
   The Giants won at least one victory in Scottdale, Ariz., where
voters approved $8.4 million to build a new stadium and keep the
National League champions from moving their spring training site to
Florida. The measure received 14,340 yes votes to 5,520 against.
   The new stadium will hold 7,000 fans, about 1,800 more than the
current park holds. The Giants have trained there since 1982.
   But in San Francisco, it remained unclear whether voters would
approve a $115 million downtown stadium to replace windswept
Candlestick Park, which opened in 1960 and survived the Oct. 17
earthquake with minimal damage.
   With 250 of 621 precincts counted, or about 40 percent of the
vote, the measure was losing with 41,705 no votes to 37,558 yes
votes.
   Owner Bob Lurie had threatened to move the team, possibly to San
Jose or Sacramento, if the measure failed.
   Several California cities had proposals dealing with gay rights.
   San Franciscans voted on a ``domestic partners'' measure
entitling unmarried and homosexual couples who work for the city to
the same funeral and sick benefits as married couples. With 156 of
621 precincts reporting, the measure had 29,389 votes against it to
22,832 votes in favor.
   In affluent Irvine, a measure that would deny homosexuals the
protection of the city's anti-discrimination ordinance was leading
by a handful of votes. The measure as it stands bans discrimination
based on age, sex, reglion, race, disability, marital status and
sexual orientation.
   With 14 percent of the ballots counted, the measure to remove
sexual orientation had received 1,572 yes votes, or 50.9 percent,
and 1,514 no votes, or 49.1 percent.
   Discrimination against AIDS victims was an issue in Concord,
Calif., the first time it was on the ballot anywhere. Voters decided
whether to repeal a recent ordinance protecting the rights of those
with AIDS. With 20 of 52 precincts reporting, the measure to take
away the rights had 5,926 yes votes to to 4,924 no votes.
   In Seattle, voters weighed a measure that would end forced school
busing and promote educational choice.

   Inmates at a prison near the Olympic National
Forest say there's something wrong with the chow. Nonsense, say
prison workers: The meat's so fresh you can still see the tire marks.
   Some prisoners at the Clearwater Olympic Corrections Center say
they're sick of eating venison and other wild game that comes from
illegal kills by hunters and occasionally from ``road kills'' by
logging trucks and other vehicles.
   They've nicknamed such fare ``Rudy stew.'' As in Rudolph the
Red-Nosed Reindeer.
   It's no rarity for inmates to gripe about the food.
   The difference at Clearwater _ a minimum-security work camp 30
miles from this logging town _ is the species they get to gripe
about.
   Sometimes it's deer. Sometimes elk.
   ``These guys who come through that chow line don't have a
choice,'' said Bill Bevard, an inmate and camp butcher. ``That's
what it comes down to: Here's the Rudy stew. You eat it. If you
don't like it, right over there is the peanut butter jar.''
   ``I don't like it. I won't eat it. I took one bite and said,
`That's not for me,''' said inmate Gary Thomas, who works in the
kitchen and serves the fare to the 256 prisoners. He has complained
about the entrees to the state Health Department.
   Bevard said he knows of at least one instance in which no one
inspected the meat from a deer hit by a truck.
   But state Corrections Department officials said the road-kill
game can be served and is inspected by a local medical authority and
a state Wildlife Department official.
   ``It really undergoes a rigorous evaulation by the (Wildlife)
Department. The game warden certifies the game as fit for human
consumption,'' said Loye Studer, the department's food service
adviser.
   Prison staff members eat the food, too.
   ``There is nothing that any of us are trying to hide,'' said
Clearwater's superintendent, Neal Brown. ``The real issue is whether
it's illegal or not illegal to do it. From our standpoint, it is
legal. Unfortunately, if it's stopped, there will be a lot of good
meat gone to waste.''
   Prison staff members said they are tired of hearing the inmates'
bellyaching.
   Carla Parks, kitchen staff supervisor, called Bevard a
complainer, and said, ``He eats it like it's going out of style.''
   She and other staffers said they like the game. If inmates don't
like the food, they said, there's always the salad bar.

<HEAD>Dollar Slips, Stocks Rebound</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar edged down against the Japanese yen
Wednesday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rebounded.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues regained 325.13
points, or 0.92 percent, ending at 35,595.59. It had lost 163.54
points the previous day.
   The dollar closed at 142.97 yen, down 0.66 yen from Tuesday's
143.63 yen-finish. The currency opened lower at 143.00 yen, and
ranged between 142.80 yen and 143.20 yen.
   The dollar had opened lower following its overnight decline in
New York. The currency's decline was attributed to the move by the
U.S. Federal Reserve to lower the federal funds rate, a short-term
interst rate in interbank transactions.
   Japanese investors were cautious because lowering the federal
funds rate does not necessarily indicate the Federal Reserve is
going to lower the discount rate, the key lending rate to commercial
banks, said a trader with a major Japanese commercial bank, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei, the market's main barometer,
started higher following an overnight gain in the Dow Jones average
of 30 major industrial issues in New York, dealers said.
   Yoshio Shimoyama, Nikko Securities' senior dealer, said Japanese
participants were reassured by the gains in New York, which was
encouraged by prospects that the United States might soon ease its
monetary policy.
   Lower interest rates are considered an encouraging factor for
stock trading.
   ``Construction issues were widely bought following the U.S.-Japan
structural talks,'' Shimoyama said, citing the fact that U.S.
representatives urged Japan to increase its spending on public
facilities.
   During the two-day U.S.-Japan economic talks in Washington, U.S.
officials urged the Japanese to take such steps as consuming more,
building more sewers, ports and express highways, and making it
easier to convert farmland to housing projects.

<TEXT>
   Kathy Whitmire, who led Houston through the
economically tumultuous 1980s, received solid backing to steer the
nation's fourth-biggest city into the next decade with a resounding,
record-tying election victory.
   ``We need to move Houston into a great new decade that is only
two months away,'' Mrs. Whitmire said Tuesday night. ``Our high
priority in the 1990s is to make sure the economic recovery benefits
all of Houston.''
   Mrs. Whitmire finished with 173,285 votes, or 63.2 percent, to
87,836 or 32 percent, for former mayor Fred Hofheinz. Four other
candidates shared the remainder of less than 5 percent.
   Mrs. Whitmire was the second Houston mayor elected to five
consecutive terms. The first was Louie Welch, whose 1985 comeback
bid was squelched by Mrs. Whitmire.
   ``You have given me such a high honor,'' she told supporters.
``You have placed your trust in me. My goal is to live up to that
trust and to make sure our community is the greatest city anywhere
in the world.''
   The loss snuffed a bid for a political comeback by Hofheinz, 51,
who served as mayor for two terms in the 1970s. Hofheinz's father
was colorful Harris County Judge Roy Hofheinz, the prime mover
behind building of the Houston Astrodome.
   ``This is not the end of anything,'' Hofheinz said. ``It is the
beginning of something. A tremendous number of people went to the
polls with our vision of 1990. I don't leave unhappy.''
   Hofheinz' campaign assertions that Mrs. Whitmire had run out of
steam after eight years on the job never appeared to take hold, as
Mrs. Whitmire built a commanding lead in the polls and never
relinquished it.
   Mrs. Whitmire, a 43-year-old accountant, took office at the
height of the oil boom, but had to deal with declining revenues and
a shattered economy when oil prices collapsed. She touted her
handling of city finances through the tough times and boasted that
unemployment, which peaked at some 13 percent, is now around 5
percent.
   ``It's been a long campaign but a fun campaign,'' she said. ``We
never knew exactly what to expect. We felt if we kept the campaign
on a positive note, we'd win, and that's what we've done. I think
there was a log of mudslinging but I'm ready to put that behind us.''

of discriminating when she called white voters and invited them to
City Hall for an after-hours voter registration session.
   Tuesday's scheduled mayoral election was postponed after the
Justice Department launched an investigation of the meeting where
only white voters registered.
   The mayor and other Zebulon officials agreed to the postponement
and a series of steps, including reopening the voter registration
rolls, to assure that blacks are not subjected to discrimination. No
new date for the election has been set.
   Mrs. Chandler's black opponent, Lewis E. Mack Jr., 31, said he
thinks the registration session, which occurred Oct. 20, was an
effort to get out the white vote against him.
   The 42-year-old Mrs. Chandler, who is white, is seeking her

   Fans blew kisses at the open casket of pianist
Vladimir Horowitz, and his widow said he was playing as well as ever
at the end.
   ``He was still playing so beautifully,'' Wanda Horowitz said
Tuesday outside the funeral house where her husband's body was on
public view. ``He was everything in my life. We had some wonderful
times and some very sad times together.''
   Horowitz, who emigrated from Russia in 1925 and won international
acclaim for his thunderous, volatile command of the piano, died
Sunday of a heart attack at his Manhattan home. He was 85.
   With some of Horowitz' recordings playing softly in the
background, dozens of mourners _ among them tenor Luciano Pavarotti,
socialite Kitty Carlisle and pianists Murray Perahia and Byron Janis
_ slowly filed past the coffin. Many wept. Others blew kisses.
   ``I was a great fan and he gave me so many hours of listening
pleasure,'' said Eva Arnstein. ``The least I could afford to do was
pay my respects.''
   About Horowitz' music playing at the funeral home, Arnstein said:
``The music feels so good. Very few people get to perform at their
own funeral.''
   Thomas Frost, Horowitz' record producer, lamented the pianist's
death.
   ``He was absolutely in top form,'' he said, referring to a
recording Horowitz was making at the time of his death.
   Horowitz' last public performances were in the spring of 1987 in
Berlin; Hamburg, West Germany; and Amsterdam, Netherlands. The
previous year, he returned to Moscow for the first time in 61 years
for an emotional, memorable concert shown on American television.
   Mrs. Horowitz, the daughter of the late conductor Arturo
Toscanini, was married to the eccentric piano virtuoso for 56 years.
   Sitting in a limousine, her voice faltered Tuesday as she spoke
how her husband's music would live on.
   ``So many people have his records and they will continue to give
joy to people and to me,'' she said. ``I will always have many
wonderful remembrances of my life with him.''
   Horowitz' body will be flown to Italy on Thursday evening and
will be interred in the Toscanini family plot in Milan.

<HEAD>Congressional Plan Would Toughen Sanctions on China</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An agreement between House and Senate
negotiators that the Bush administration also consents to would
toughen trade sanctions against China in response to last summer's
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.
   A compromise reached Tuesday on a measure authorizing activities
of the State Department and other agencies included penalties on
China that go beyond those imposed by Bush after the Tiananmen
Square massacre in June.
   The sanctions included suspension of risk insurance through the
Overseas Private Investment Corp. for companies doing business in
China; suspension of trade assistance; a freeze on exports of
satellites; a halt to sales of controlled munitions, including
helicopters and parts, and crime control equipment; and an end to
sale of certain nuclear material and components.
   The measure harshly condemned the ``unprovoked, brutal and
indiscriminate assault'' on the thousands of pro-democracy
demonstrators in Beijing on June 4, noting that at least 700 people
died and another 27 or more were executed afterward.
   The bill also condemned China's efforts to conceal the truth of
what happened, including clandestine disposal of bodies and
suppression of news reports.
   The sanctions and the verbal condemnation were included in the
compromise version of a two-year, $9.7 billion State Department
bill, which now goes back to the full House and Senate for final
approval.
   The measure was initially opposed by the White House because of
the sanctions, but was later accepted after Rep. Stephen Solarz,
D-N.Y., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Asia subcommittee,
agreed to make it easier for the president to waive the penalties.
   In discussions with National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft,
Solarz said, the measure was altered to allow termination of the
sanctions if the president certifies such action is ``in the
national interest.'' Scowcroft reported the president would not veto
the measure based on that provision, said Solarz.
   The conferees also accepted a section that would impose criminal
penalties on any government official who enlists any foreign
government to carry out policies that are banned by U.S. law.
   The amendment grew out of the Iran-Contra affair. It was intended
to bar use of U.S. foreign aid as leverage with countries to support
goals the United States cannot pursue directly because of legal
restrictions.
   It is aimed at situations like the use of U.S. military aid for
Honduras to pressure that government to support the Contra rebels
fighting the government in Nicaragua. That provision could still
provide a reason for Bush to veto the bill.
   The overall measure includes major boosts in aid for the United
Nations and for U.N. peacekeeping forces. They would be authorized
to receive a total of $832 million this year and $939 million next
year, compared with $520 million last year.

<TEXT>
   After a month of delay during which 2,000
Contras slipped into Nicaragua, the Security Council is taking the
unprecedented step of sending peacekeepers to Central America to
stop the border crossings.
   Another mission for the 625-strong border patrol force will be to
interdict shipments of Nicaraguan and Cuban weapons that the State
Department says are being made to leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   Sandinista officials are to meet Contra leaders in New York
Thursday and Friday for talks mediated by a joint U.N.-Organization
of American States commission. Honduran officials will sit in as
observers.
   The Contras are insisting on reinstatement of the 19-month
cease-fire with the government. President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua
suspended the unilateral truce last week, citing mounting rebel
raids he said were aimed at disrupting national elections set for
Feb. 25.
   The Contra attacks violate an Aug. 7 agreement by five Central
American presidents under which Ortega promised the free elections
in exchange for the demobilization of the Contras by early December.
   The State Department says about 2,000 Contras infiltrated
Nicaragua in recent weeks, and that now about 4,000 are in Nicaragua
and 10,000 remain in their bases in Honduras.
   The United States ceased arming the Contras in February 1988 but
the Bush administration has continued to supply them with non-lethal
eaid.
   The border patrol force is the first U.N. peacekeeping force to
be deployed in the Western Hemisphere, and U.S. acceptance of it
marks a reverse by Washington.
   Earlier this year, then-U.S. ambassador Vernon Walters said
Washington opposed such a force and Jeane Kirkpatrick said when she
was ambassador that U.N. peacekeepers would never have a role in
Central America.
   Deployment of the force had been delayed for weeks by the failure
of the United States to adopt a clear policy.
   A U.S. diplomat, speaking privately, said Ambassador Thomas
Pickering had won political support for the force, but it took
longer to persuade Capitol Hill that the $41 million cost for six
months was worthwhile.
   Other officials said there was a split in the Bush administration
over whether the peacekeepers would interfere with U.S. support for
the Contras camped in Honduras.
   Canada, West Germany and Spain will provide the bulk of the U.N.
soldiers, pilots and staff for the force, to be called ONUCA after
the Spanish initials for U.N. Observer Group-Central America.
   The force will also contain a Latin American contingent. Colombia
and Venezuela have agreed in principle to provide troops.
   ONUCA will be a highly mobile border patrol, equipped with jeeps,
helicopters and speedboats.
   It will have 260 military observers; 115 crew members for 12
helicopters and an airplane; 50 members for a naval unit consisting
of speedboats and patrol boats; 14 medical workers; about 104 U.N.
staffers for administration; and 82 locally recruited civilians.
   Headquarters will be in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.

   Abortion rights leaders say victories by their
candidates in New Jersey and Virginia prove the power of their issue
and that ``George Bush should take heed.''
   A spokeswoman for abortion opponents voiced displeasure with the
way anti-abortion Republican candidates ran their campaigns in
Tuesday's off-year elections.
   ``The right to choose has been proven to be a pivotal voting
issue,'' said Kate Michelman, executive director of the National
Abortion Rights Action League.
   The abortion rights group poured money into independent
expenditure campaigns in the Virginia and New Jersey races for
governor and was involved in selected legislative races in both
states.
   Democrat James Florio won easily in New Jersey while supporting
continued abortion rights. Democrat Douglas Wilder claimed a narrow
victory in Virginia over anti-abortion Republican Marshall Coleman
in a race where abortion was a dominant issue.
   Abortion also became an issue in the Virginia lieutenant
governor's race, where little-known Democratic nominee Don Beyer
upset Republican Edwina ``Eddy'' Dalton, an opponent of abortion who
had aired television ads highlighting the issue and seeming to
soften her opposition.
   Nancy E. Myers, spokeswoman for the National Right to Life
Committee, the leading anti-abortion group, faulted Coleman's
handling of the issue. ``We're frustrated that Wilder was able to
frame the debate'' on abortion, she said.
   She said her group did not work on behalf of Florio's Republican
opponent James Courter, who sought to modify his opposition to
abortion. She said the losses by Courter in New Jersey and Dalton in
Virginia pointed up the risk of backing away from an anti-abortion
position.
   ``Eddy Dalton betrayed the pro-life movement in Virginia,'' she
said. ``She used the rhetoric of the pro-abortion side. It was
exactly the wrong thing to do. She lost because of it.''
   Michelman, however, said Dalton's loss to Beyer ``proves that a
candidate's anti-choice position will dog them right to the end and
that lying won't work.''
   ``This is a wake-up call for George Bush,'' she said, noting the
president's recent veto of a bill that would permit federally
financed abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest.
   ``The message to politicians everywhere is if you're out of touch
you'll be out of office,'' she said. ``George Bush should take
heed.''
   Among the other races where abortion was a focus was the race for
Nassau County district attorney, on Long Island in New York.
Republican incumbent Denis Dillon won re-election a year after
bolting the Democratic Party in protest over that party's support
for abortion rights.

   A man believed to be the adopted son of
actress Jill Ireland was found dead Tuesday, police said.
   Police tentatively identified the man as Jason Bronson, 27, said
Sgt. John Waters.
   Miss Ireland has an adult son named Jason McCallum, adopted when
she was married to actor David McCallum.
   She was divorced from McCallum in 1967 and a year later married
actor Charles Bronson, best known for portraying a vigilante in the
``Death Wish'' movies.
   The death was not being investigated as a homicide, although the
cause of death wasn't immediately determined, Waters said.
   Miss Ireland, who co-starred with Bronson in several action
movies, wrote about Jason's heroin addiction in a book published
earlier this year, ``Life Lines.''
   She has called the battle to save her son from drugs a greater
trauma than her own five-year battle with cancer.

<HEAD>Suarez Wins Landslide; Commission Races In Runoff</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mayor Xavier Suarez underscored his growing
political power by winning re-election handily, while the city's
lone elected black commissioner headed to what's expected to be a
tense runoff against a Cuban-born challenger.
   Suarez had 21,946 votes, or 64 percent, to 12,165 votes, or 36
percent, for former city commissioner Armando Lacasa, 53.
   The 40-year-old mayor called his landslide re-election Tuesday
``a victory that clearly shows the unity of Miami.''
   But he sees a threat to that unity in former commissioner Joe
Carollo, who earned a runoff against incumbent Miller Dawkins, who's
black.
   ``(Carollo) has been very divisive,'' Suarez said. ``He's run a
very, very ethnically tinged and characterized campaign.''
   Dawkins, 64, had 13,150 votes, or 38 percent, to 12,459 votes, or
36 percent, for former commissioner Carollo, 34, in a six-candidate
field.
   Carollo said he would appeal to all groups and rejected
suggestions that blacks _ 30 percent of the city's voters _ should
be assured of keeping a black representative on the commission.
   ``The American way is not that you assign any seat to black or
white or Cuban,'' Carollo said.
   Dawkins said: ``There is no such thing as a black seat ... But
there being three ethnic groups in the community, each group should
have a representative. We will not have a divisive campaign.''
   A runoff also will be held next week for the other commission
seat up for grabs.
   Rosario Kennedy, who resigned the position this summer to run
unsuccessfully for Congress, was second in a six-candidate field
with 10,044 votes, or 29.2 percent, to educator Miriam Alonso's
10,279 votes, or 29.9 percent. Both are Cuban-born.

<HEAD>Soviet Magazine Editor Says Glasnost Won't be Stifled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A trailblazing Soviet magazine editor who was
rebuked last month by an angry President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for
being too radical says the free atmosphere of glasnost has advanced
too far to be reversed.
   Vitaly Korotich, editor-in-chief of the magazine Ogonyok,
delivered a strong response to those in the Soviet leadership who
would seek to stifle the press for not being supportive enough of
Gorbachev's reforms.
   ``They'll never stop us,'' Korotich said Tuesday night in a
speech sponsored by the Gannett Center for Media Studies.
   In the past, the state-controlled press was a laughingstock to
its readers, Korotich said, and ``nobody took it seriously.'' Under
Gorbachev's policies of glasnost, or openness, it has enjoyed an
explosion of freedom, with some publications printing frank
discussions of the nation's problems.
   Now that people believe in the press, ``we must be honest,'' said
Korotich, who today ended a two-week U.S. tour.
   ``If we lose our face now, it will be tragic,'' he said. ``It
will be the most dangerous tragedy. And we must fight for the
honesty. And not only for us, but for many of you and for many other
countries.''
   On Oct. 13, Gorbachev summoned top Soviet editors, including
Korotich, for a two-hour, closed-door lecture during which he
expressed his fury at several liberal publications. He accused them
of working against the party or of seeking his political downfall at
a time when the country is suffering economic and ethnic problems.
   Korotich said he had never seen the Soviet leader so angry.
Gorbachev is ``always soft, always nice, always such a very, very
polite man.''
   This time, however, ``he was cruel. ... It was quite a different
man.''
   According to Korotich, Gorbachev warned the editors: ``We are
standing in the ocean of gasoline and you, you play with the
matches.''
   Gorbachev reportedly said Vladislav Starkov, editor of the Soviet
Union's most popular newspaper, Arguments and Facts, should resign.
Starkov has refused to quit, and he is still waiting to learn his
fate.
   Korotich, 53, said no editor is secure, including himself.
   ``I think it will be possible ... to fire one editor or two
editors, but it will be impossible to change the atmosphere,'' he
said. ``The atmosphere is very free.''
   Whether from Gorbachev or the more conservative factions in the
Communist Party leadership, Korotich says the press criticism has
been more strident.
   ``Now we have stronger and stronger speeches: the press is
guilty. I always have those discussions with the party Central
Committee. They tell me sometimes that people don't believe in our
system because `You're writing that terrible things are happening.'
I tell them that people don't believe so strongly (in the Soviet
system) because they don't have sausages in our supermarkets.''
   Nevertheless, Korotich said he liked the stormy meeting with
Gorbachev.
   ``I think this meeting with editors was good move played by
Gorbachev in the long and dangerous continuation (he has) usually
played. It was quite a professional move, an interesting move. But I
still am not afraid of him. You see, I want to play on his team,''
he said.
   Korotich agreed his progressive weekly is a weapon for Gorbachev
and his reforms, ``but I never try to be personally connected in
such a way that I call Gorbachev and ask, `What do you want from
me?' Never! ... Journalism must not be personal service. I support
the idea of democratic changes, and Gorbachev is personally
connected with this idea, and I try to connect the magazine with the
same idea.''
   Korotich, a member of the Soviet legislature, also said lawmakers
were drafting measures to do away with censorship and make
publications such as his independent.
   He also said he has been discussing joint publishing ventures
with several U.S. magazines, including Reader's Digest and Life.

   Democrat John Daniels trounced his
Republican opponent to become New Haven's first black mayor, but
warned in his acceptance speech that the city was on the brink of
disaster.
   ``Our city is on the edge in many ways. We can only pull back
from the edge if we all pull together,'' said Daniels, 53, a
five-term state senator.
   Elsewhere around Connecticut, voters sent incumbent mayors
packing Tuesday in East Hartford, Bridgeport, Danbury and
Middletown. Incumbents won in Hartford, Waterbury and Stamford.
   Daniels won 20,644 votes, or 68 percent, to Republican Alderwoman
Robie Pooley's 8,886, or 29 percent, according to unofficial
returns. Green Party candidate Matthew Borenstein had 931 votes, or
3 percent.
   Mayor Biagio DiLieto, who decided not to seek a sixth term,
painted an even gloomier picture than did Daniels, speaking of the
city's high rates of poverty, homelessness, AIDS, drug abuse, teen
pregnancy and infant mortality.
   ``There is a litany of problems that disgusts you just to think
of,'' DiLieto said. ``I don't envy him.''
   Political novice Mary C. Moran, a Republican who told voters she
was a businesswoman and a housewife, not a politician, became the
first woman mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut's largest city.
   Moran, running in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans
3-1, had 15,624 votes, or 53 percent, to 12,368, or 42 percent for
Democratic Mayor Thomas W. Bucci, whose administration is beset with
budget problems. Four other candidates sharing the remaining 5
percent of the vote.
   In East Hartford, Republican challenger Susan G. Kniep ousted
Democratic incumbent Robert F. McNulty; Democrat Gene Eriquez ousted
Republican incumbent Joseph H. Sauer Jr. in Danbury; and Democrat
Paul Gionfriddo upset Republican Mayor Sebastian J. Garafalo in
Middletown.
   In Hartford, Democrat Carrie S. Perry won a second term with a
2-1 vote margin over Republican challenger Rosemary Z. Cardwell.
   In other races, Waterbury Republican Joseph J. Santopietro won a
third term and Democrat Thom Serrani was returned to office in
Stamford.

<HEAD>Washington, Hall Kick Off Runoff Campaign for Leland's Congressional
Seat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The race to fill the unexpired term of the late
U.S. Rep. Mickey Leland will come down to a runoff between state
Sen. Craig Washington and City Councilman Anthony Hall.
   None of the 11 candidates in the crowded field Tuesday could
attract more than 50 percent of the vote for an outright win. A
spokesman in the Texas secretary of state's office said Gov. Bill
Clements likely would schedule the runoff in mid-December.
   Washington fell nine percentage points short of taking the seat,
winning 41.4 percent of the balloting, or 27,317 votes, to Hall's
34.4 percent, or 22,728. The two, both Democrats, pulled away early
from a pack of nine other hopefuls.
   Their nearest pursuer, state Rep. Ron Wilson, also a Democrat,
picked up 4,937 votes, or 7.5 percent.
   ``Let's do it again,'' Washington said Tuesday night. ``We'll
have to get my voters out one more time, but we're going to win.''
   Hall vowed he would begin rallying support beginning today for
the new race. ``We've got to start at 6:30 in the morning,'' Hall
told supporters.
   Pre-election polls gave Hall the edge over Washington, 32 percent
to 24 percent, but Washington said being behind then did not trouble
him.
   ``I didn't lose faith,'' he said. ``Those polls have a tendency
to discourage people from voting and I think we ought to encourage
people to vote.''
   Hall said now that the other nine candidates have been eliminated
from the race, the runoff can focus better on the issues.
   Hall and Washington emerged as front-runners early in the race
for one of Texas' most Democratic and racially mixed districts until
the regular election is held in 1990.
   A year remains on the unexpired term of Leland, who was killed
Aug. 7 in a plane crash in a remote jungle of Ethiopia while he was
on a famine relief trip.
   Other Democrats who ran included state Rep. Al Edwards, who got
3,088 votes, or 4.7 percent; attorney Shirley Fobbs, 1,312 or about
2 percent; businessman Timothy John Hattenbach, 1,263 or 1.9
percent; and Lee Arthur Demas Jr., 341 or 0.5 percent.
   Republicans in the race included attorney Beverly Spencer, 2,118
or 3.2 percent; businessman Manse R. Sharp Jr., 1,071 or 1.6
percent; and education supervisor Byron J. Johnson, 1,057 or 1.6
percent.
   Austin stockbroker Gary Johnson was the Libertarian candidate and
took 823 votes or 1.3 percent.

<HEAD>Dollar Down, Stocks Rebound</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar declined against the Japanese yen today,
while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index rebounded sharply from
the previous day's losses.
   The dollar closed at 142.97 yen, down 0.66 yen from Tuesday's
143.63-yen finish. It opened at 143.00 yen and ranged between 142.80
yen and 143.20 yen.
   The dollar's decline in Tokyo followed its overnight downswing in
New York, where investors were discouraged by a rumor that the U.S.
Federal Reserve Board would soon ease its monetary policy. Lower
interest rates make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors.
   The rumor followed buying operations by the Fed to lower the
federal funds rate, a short-term interest rate used for interbank
transactions.
   ``The dollar-yen rate moved little in Tokyo today, as market
players just couldn't figure out whether they should buy or sell the
dollar,'' said Yuji Nakao, a trader with Chemical Bank.
   ``The dollar was stuck between 142 yen and 144 yen, and it
wouldn't go either higher or lower than that range,'' he said.
   An estimated $7.76 billion changed hands in today's trading.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained
325.13 points, or 0.92 percent, ending at 35,595.59. It had lost
163.54 points Tuesday.
   The index opened higher following gains in the Dow Jones
industrial average in New York overnight, dealers said.
   ``The yen's strength on the foreign exchange market also helped
reassure investors,'' said Tsuneo Ishii, an analyst at Nomura
Securities.
   ``The market expectation for the U.S. central bank to ease its
monetary stance also encouraged Japanese investors,'' he said.
   The Nikkei continued to strengthen as Japanese investors bought
real estate, construction and housing issues. In current U.S.-Japan
trade talks, U.S. representatives have urged Japan to invest more in
public facilities.
   An estimated 800 million shares were traded on the first section,
up from Tuesday's 750 million.

   Feisty Mayor James D. Griffin again
demonstrated his enduring popularity among Buffalo voters by
becoming the city's first mayor to win election to a fourth,
four-year term.
   With nearly all precincts reporting, he captured 75 percent of
the vote Tuesday. Griffin easily defeated state Assemblyman William
Hoyt, who had 14 percent, and former City Court judge Wilbur
Trammell, 11 percent.
   Hoyt was not an active candidate in the general election, and
Trammell waged a write-in campaign against Griffin. The longtime
mayor beat both men in September's Democratic primary.
   Griffin, 60, had the Democratic, Republican, Conservative and
Right-to-Life nominations.
   In his campaign, Griffin emphasized major redevelopment projects
in New York's second-largest city _ including several new office
buildings and hotels, waterfront condominiums and Pilot Field, the
city's highly praised baseball stadium.
   A former grain-elevator worker, Griffin lost his first election
for city councilman in 1959, but subsequently was elected to the
state Senate.
   Though an enrolled Democrat, Griffin has often been at odds with
the Erie County Democratic Party. In becoming mayor in 1977, he beat
out the party's challenger, Assemblyman Arthur O. Eve, by running
with the Conservative Party endorsement.
   In his last election in 1985, Griffin again beat out the
Democratic Party's challenger, City Councilman George Arthur.

<HEAD>Report: Force of Hazardous Waste Inspectors Needs to Be Increased</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 28-member force of inspectors that checks
the safety of rail shipments of hazardous chemicals is not large
enough to ensure federal safety regulations are being obeyed,
according to the General Accounting Office.
   ``It's like trying to stop an elephant with a fly swatter,''
Kenneth M. Mead, the GAO's chief transportation expert, told a House
subcommittee Tuesday. ``You try to stop all these tank cars and
there's another 500,000 cars right behind them.''
   Mead said the federal government can't afford to hire enough
inspectors to look at all 1.1 million rail carloads of hazardous
chemicals which move each year but that ``a doubling of this
workforce would be reasonable.''
   The GAO, in a report to be issued next week, concluded the
Federal Railroad Administration hasn't done a good job of running
the government's hazardous materials inspection program.

   In an initial step toward a
chemical-weapons treaty, the United States and Soviet Union will
begin exchanging information about their arsenals next month, an
official says.
   The superpowers are likely to conduct trial inspections in May, a
U.S. official said Tuesday.
   President Bush and Soviet Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze called
for production bans in recent speeches to the U.N. General Assembly.
   The U.S. official, attending an arms control seminar at Wye
Plantation on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, estimated U.S.
stockpiles at about 30,000 tons.
   The official, who spoke to reporters under rules that barred
identifying him, said the Soviet's claim of possessing 50,000 tons
of poison gas was widely understated. He said their arsenal could be
five or six times as big.

   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee says his panel will conduct hearings on the explosion
aboard the USS Iowa that claimed the lives of 47 sailors.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said Tuesday the panel will hold hearings
both on the April 19 blast and the Navy's investigation of it. The
hearings start next week.
   The Navy concluded that gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig ``most
likely'' caused the explosion by inserting some type of detonator
between bags of gunpowder in one of the ship's 16-inch guns.
   But since the service issued its report on Sept. 7, members of
Congress, Hartwig's family and the sailor's former shipmates have

   The devil-worshiping ``Night Stalker'' who
murdered 13 people during a summer-long rampage that terrorized
California told the judge who sentenced him to death that Satan will
avenge his execution.
   Richard Ramirez, wearing his trademark black sunglasses,
delivered a chilling recitation before Superior Court Judge Michael
Tynan ordered death in the gas chamber at San Quentin.
   ``You don't understand me,'' the 29-year-old Ramirez told the
crowded courtroom Tuesday. ``You are not expected to ... I am beyond
your experience. I am beyond good and evil ... I will be avenged.
Lucifer dwells within us all.''
   A jury on Sept. 20 convicted him of 13 murders and 30 other
felonies in the 1985 attacks. The panel later recommended the death
sentence.
   The sentence carries an automatic appeal. No executions have been
held in California in almost 25 years.
   Defense attorney Ray Clark said appeals courts would face a novel
issue in the case: determining the impact of the slaying of one
juror during deliberations. A juror was shot to death in August by
her boyfriend, who later took his own life.
   Ramirez burglarized homes late at night, often murdering men in
their beds before attacking women and children. Satanic symbols were
left at crime scenes and surviving victim testified of being forced
to swear to Satan.
   In one murder, a victim's eyes were gouged out. In another, a
woman testified during the trial she was raped beside the body of
her murdered husband.
   Ramirez, a drifter from El Paso, Texas, was captured by an East
Los Angeles mob on Aug. 31, 1985, a day after his picture appeared
in newspapers and on television and he was identified as a suspect
in the crime spree.
   Jurors, some of whom said they felt the defendant tried to
intimidate them during the trial by sneering at them, returned death
penalty recommendations on each of 19 special circumstance counts.
   ``The jury has found death a fitting and just punishment and this
court has ratified that judgment,'' Tynan said.
   As the horrific case was brought to a close, Ramirez caused some
spectators to gasp as he delivered a rambling statement.
   ``I don't believe in the hypocritical, moralistic dogma of this
so-called civilized society,'' he said. ``I need not look beyond
this oom to see all the liars, the haters, the killers, the crooks,
the paranoid cowards. Truly the trematodes of the earth (a parasitic
worm) ...
   ``You maggots make me sick, hypocrites one and all.''
   Deputy District Attorney P. Philip Halpin dismissed Ramirez's
words as ``more baloney.''
   ``I certainly wouldn't want anyone to listen to what he has to
say because he is a pathetic human being who is grasping at some
structure in his life,'' Halpin said.

<HEAD>Young Takes Unprecedented Fifth Term as Detroit Mayor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN L. ADLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Coleman Young overcame challenges of his
personal and professional conduct and coasted to an unprecedented
fifth term.
   ``I don't know how I can thank you enough for what you have done
tonight,'' Young told supporters late Tuesday. ``This is a great
victory here in Detroit.
   ``Once again the people of this city have proved that they are
sophisticated ... They can see through any kind of propaganda and
disinformation and come up with the truth.''
   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Young led challenger
Tom Barrow 137,466, or 56 percent, to 106,739, or 44 percent.
   Young, 71, led from the earliest returns, which confirmed exit
polls showing him firmly in control.
   ``We fought, we did. But we're not going to blame anybody,''
Barrow said. ``My opponent may be across the street with all the fat
cats celebrating. I don't care.''
   Young told cheering crowds of supporters that they used ``the
right stuff'' in returning him to office until 1993, which would
give him two full decades as mayor of the nation's sixth-largest
city.
   The non-partisan race was a somewhat more competitive rematch of
the two candidates' 1985 contest. Young beat Barrow by 61 percent to
39 percent then.
   This time, again, the overriding issue was Young's record.
   A paternity suit filed by a former city worker was settled out of
court, and Young blunted criticism of his handling of a deal in
which the city paid 20 times more than the assessed value for land
on which Chrysler Corp. will build a $1 billion assembly plant.
   Polls released after last week's annual Devil's Night arson spree
showed Barrow closing to within eight percentage points with 14
percent of voters undecided. But Barrow was out of town at the time
and seemed slow to capitalize on his gains.
   Barrow, 40, hammered away at Young's leadership style and its
results but was largely ignored when he talked about the city's main
issues: crime, schools and creating new jobs.
   In declining to debate Barrow, Young said his challenger had no
record on anything because he had never held elected office.

   U.S. and Japanese officials made less progress
than was hoped for in their talks on indirect causes of the two
countries' trade imbalance, according to U.S. officials.
   Only modest progress, ``far less than we had hoped for,'' was
achieved in the second two-day round of new high-level talks on
reducing the $50 billion annual U.S. trade deficit with Japan, said
U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary Charles Dallara.
   ``There was very little flexibility in the Japanese government
position ... in reaching common ground on the nature of the
problems, even problems which do appear to be widely recognized in
Japan,'' he told reporters Tuesday night.
   Japanese officials would not be quoted by name. One from the
Gaimusho, Japan's foreign ministry, said his country was concerned
about many of the issues raised by the U.S. side but progress could
not be expected overnight.
   In addition to modernizing business practices, the U.S. side has
asked Japan to consume more and spend more on such infrastructure as
roads, sewers and housing.
   There is no question about the need for housing and roads but the
solution is complicated by the shortage of land and the world's
highest land prices, the Japanese official said.
   ``We were a little disappointed that we didn't go as far as we
had hoped,'' said U.S. Undersecretary of State Richard McCormack, a
participant in the talks. Some progress was made, ``but we would
have hoped to have made more,'' he said.
   McCormack said the third round of the talks would be in Japan in
mid-January, shortly before Japanese parliamentary elections. ``I
would expect there to be very intense discussions ... immediately
after the (Japanese) election,'' McCormack added.
   Despite slow progress, he predicted that the target would be met
of an early spring interim report on structural changes that could
help ease the trade imbalance.
   President George Bush in May announced the SII, or Structural
Impediment Initiative, to identify problems contributing to the
trade problem stemming from lifestyles, traditions and business
practices rather than formal market barriers. The U.S. side has been
warning that lack of concrete results could bring new pressure from
Congress next year to restrict U.S. import of Japanese goods.

   Powerful thunderstorms sent up to 16 inches of
rain sluicing through streets and bayous, flooding homes, stranding
schoolchilden and killing a toddler who swept away in a drainage
canal.
   Flood waters were receding early today in most areas drenched by
the 24-hour deluge. A 70 percent chance of thunderstorms was
forecast for today, but the National Weather Service didn't issue
flood warnings.
   As much as 16 inches of rain fell in Jefferson Parish, next to
New Orleans, from Monday night through Tuesday, said Civil Defense
Director Robert Lyons. Ten inches was measured at New Orleans
International Airport.
   ``If it rains long enough and hard enough, as the Bible tells us,
everybody is susceptible to flooding,'' said Jefferson Parish
President Mike Yenni.
   The weather service said 7 inches of rain fell on Baton Rouge, 75
miles to the north, but dry ground quickly absorbed much of the
water.
   The downpour overcame efforts to use huge pumps in Orleans and
Jefferson parishs to suck water out of the bowl-shaped area and into
Lake Pontchartrain.
   ``You can't prepare for the amounts of water we had,'' Yenni
said. ``We're still trying to prepare for 5 inches of rain in five
hours. We had one drainage station measure 10 inches.''
   Two-year-old Brian Serrano of Metairie wandered out of his house
and either fell or jumped into a drainage canal, said sheriff's Lt.
Bob Garner. He was swept more than a mile to a pumping station,
where two workers in a rowboat pulled his body from the water.
   Lightning knocked out transformers and switches, blacking out
11,000 customers in the New Orleans area, utility officials said.
Most of the electricity was restored.
   Many students were kept at schools into the night because of
traffic snarls and the dangers of travel.
   At least 150 homes in Orleans, Jefferson and St. Bernard parishes
were flooded, an experience most owners in low-lying Louisiana had
been through before.
   ``I lost everything _ all my Christmas presents that I had
purchased so far. The bedding's gone. Clothes are gone. I have one
pair of shoes left that were sitting in the van two streets down
that I took off on the way home from work,'' said Christina Fleming
of Avondale.

<HEAD>Custody Battle Follows Steamy Society Divorce Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pulitzer vs. Pulitzer, the
high-society divorce case that featured revelations of steamy
extramarital affairs and drug abuse in exclusive Palm Beach, is
scheduled to return to court in January.
   This time, aerobics teacher Roxanne Pulitzer is taking on her
ex-husband, millionaire newspaper heir Herbert ``Peter'' Pulitzer,
for more time with their 12-year-old twin sons.
   On Monday, a judge set the week of Jan. 16 for a two-day trial.
Roxanne Pulitzer is seeking more than the 70 days a year she was
awarded with Mac and Zac.
   In December 1982, Circuit Judge Carl Harper ruled she was unfit
to be a mother, and gave custody to the father after the 18-day
trial that included allegations of lesbianism, cocaine use and her
sleeping with a trumpet to communicate with the spirit world.
   ``I have mixed emotions about the courts,'' she said Tuesday.
``(But) one must do what one must do for their children.''
   Attorneys for both parents went to court Monday to discuss the
trial and ask a judge to appoint a mediator.
   Peter Pulitzer, grandson of publishing magnate Joseph Pulitzer,
made it clear in a four-page response filed in court last month that
he would fight his former wife's bid.
   He claimed his ex-wife's nude photographs in Playboy magazine,
talk-show publicity, a television movie and her best-selling book
make her unfit to spend more time with their sons.
   ``The former wife has seen fit to display herself nude for the
entire population of the United States, and perhaps the world,''
Pulitzer wrote of the Playboy spread several years ago.
   ``(Her) first and foremost interest is money,'' his lawyer added.
   Roxanne Pulitzer denied the new dispute was about publicity.
``The last time, the press got involved when it shouldn't have,''
she said.
   Her attorney, Donald Sasser, said none of her actions should have
anything to do with her fitness to spend more time with her children.
   The twins moved with their father from Palm Beach to a ranch in
Okeechobee County three years ago.

   A thief who left behind a wallet
with cash and a pair of valuable amplifiers in a van made off with
four silent witnesses: a ventriloquist's dummies.
   Sam Lamerson, the pastor of Westside Baptist Church and an
entertainer, said Tuesday he found his vehicle had been broken into.
Gone were hand-carved wooden Studley; Ebenezer the Geezer; Al, the
Faithful Hunting Dog; and Roscoe the Rabbit.
   Lamerson, who performs as a juggler, magician and ventriloquist
at nightclubs, trade shows and birthday parties about 30 times a
month as one of the Zucchini Brothers, said he's heartbroken.
   ``It's almost like having your child kidnapped,'' he said.
   Police speculated that the thief or thieves could be children or
a vagrant hoping to pawn the dummies.
   One of the them, Ebenezer, hates children, Lamerson said. ``He's
probably really mad right now,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Voters in St. Paul elected their first new
mayor in 13 years, handing the post to the City Council president.
   Democrat Jim Scheibel defeated independent Bob Fletcher, a police
lieutenant, in a race to succeed Mayor George Latimer, who is
stepping down after a record tenure.
   He had 36,003 votes to Fletcher's 27,783 with all 139 precincts
reporting Tuesday night.
   Scheibel, 42, has served on the City Council since 1982. He won a
nine-way primary race with 45 percent of the vote to 26 percent for
Fletcher.
   Fletcher, 34, who has strong ties to the Republican Party, also
was elected to the City Council in 1982 but resigned before the end
of his term. He later made an unsuccessful bid for a state Senate
seat.
   The campaign had focused on property taxes, crime and drugs.
   Across the Mississippi River in neighboring Minneapolis, the
state's largest city, Mayor Donald Fraser won a fourth term by
defeating firefighter Jens Peterson, 46, who finished a distant
second in the Sept. 12 primary. Both are Democrats.
   With all 182 precincts reporting, Fraser had 44,585 votes to
Peterson's 11,613.
   Fraser, 65, represented the Minneapolis area for 16 years in the
U.S. House before he lost a U.S. Senate bid in 1978. He has served a
record 10 years as mayor and outpolled Peterson, 46, more than 8-1
in the primary.
   The elections in the Twin Cities were non-partisan.

   Michigan residents soundly thumped two
school financing proposals that would have raised sales taxes to pay
for education improvements.
   The results in Tuesday's election marked the latest in a series
of defeats for school levies, with five earlier issues falling since
1972.
   With 88 percent of the precincts reporting early today, Proposal
A was failing 1,153,695, or 71 percent, to 462,170, 29 percent.
Proposal B was losing 1,184,793, or 74 percent, to 410,109, or 26
percent.
   Proposal A, backed by Gov. James Blanchard, would have increased
the state sales tax from 4 percent to 4.5 percent. Proposal B would
have raised the sales tax to 6 percent while cutting property taxes.
   Voters could choose one, both or neither of the proposals.
   The failure of the proposals throws the issue of school finance
back to the Legislature, which went through three years of
discussion before putting the two plans on the special ballot.

   Jackson County residents put more muscle

   The levy, intended to raise $98 million, received approval from
60 percent of the voters Tuesday.
   The money will go toward investigation, prosecution,
incarceration and treatment of drug offenders. Although it is a
county tax, some of the money is earmarked specifically to the
Kansas City Police Department.

voted for the tax increase and 33,968, or 40 percent, voted against
it.
   The area had 136 slayings last year, the ninth-highest murder
rate in the country, according to the FBI.
   In Kansas City, which is part of Jackson County, 29,464, or 62
percent, voted in favor, and 17,877, or 38 percent, voted against.
   In the rest of Jackson County, including Kansas City suburbs and
rural areas, 22,443, about 58 percent, voted in favor, and 16,091,
42 percent, voted against it.

   A lawyer for a man named Savage who is
accused of killing a woman wants his client identified by a
less-violent sounding alias to ensure a fair trial.
   ``When they hear `savage,' they see Indians attacking and all
that,'' attorney George Turner said during a hearing Monday in the
first-degree murder case of James Hudson Savage.
   Turner said he plans to file a motion for an alias during the
trial, scheduled to begin Monday. Brevard Circuit Judge Lawrence
Johnston said the motion would be argued once the trial opens.
   Savage is charged with the Nov. 23 slaying of Melbourne interior
designer Barbara Ann Barber.
   Assistant State Attorney Russ Bausch opposes an alias because
Savage's name appears on the indictment for murder, sexual battery
and robbery.
   Johnston said he may bring in an expert to testify to the effect
the name Savage could have on a jury.

Ithaca's first Socialist mayor will mean the start of a new era in

   Nichols, a retired Cornell University professor of electrical
engineering, was listening to Beethoven at home Tuesday evening when
he was informed he'd edged Republican Jean Cookingham by 2,630-2,428.
   Although there were enough absentee ballots outstanding _ 250 _
to still give Cookingham a shot at winning, the political newcomer
conceded defeat.
   ``I'm relieved it's all over,'' she said.
   Nichols, 60, is a former chairman of the local chapter of the
Democratic Socialists of America.
   Her ran as a Democrat after knocking off incumbent Mayor John
Gutenberger in September's primary, but said he had identified
myself as a member of the Democratic Socialists from the beginning

   ``The fact is that the people of Ithaca are willing to accept
that and not throw up their hands.'' he told supporters Tuesday
night.
   ``People who wanted the status quo, and the media, didn't trust

   Roger Quaring was just a retired custodian
and ordinary citizen when he left town for an eye examination. By
the time he returned, he was Mayor Roger Quaring.
   ``It doesn't pay to leave town on election day,'' Quaring
grumbled after he learned of his not-particularly-welcome victory.
   Quaring was elected chief executive of this southeastern Montana
town by virtue of 27 write-in votes, but he he doesn't know if he'll
accept the voters' mandate.
   ``I don't plan on making a decision until I talk to the (city)
council members,'' he said. ``I didn't have any idea that I would be
written in.''
   No one ran for the post or even expressed interest in being a
write-in candidate.
   Current Mayor Klayton Rogge said he didn't want the job either,
but accepted it after receiving the most write-in votes four years
ago. Rogge said he lacks time to continue in the position.
   ``Nobody wants it (the office of mayor),'' said Darlene Thompson,
the city clerk. ``For about $40 a month, you can get a lot of
hassle.''

   A United Mine Workers leader waged a

millions of dollars.
   The union leader, Jackie Stump, said it was working people from

   Stump, president of UMW's District 28, defeated Delegate Donald

   ``It shows what working people can do when they stick together,''
Stump told supporters who gathered outside the UMW offices in
Oakwood. ``The nurses, the custodians, the teachers, the people who

   By a paper-thin margin, tobacco-country
voters approved some limits on smoking in public places.
   Final unofficial returns showed the city's voters favored smoking
restrictions by a 173-vote margin, 14,991 to 14,818.
   The ordinance would ban smoking in elevators and in retail stores
employing more than 25 people or with a capacity of more than 200.
It also would require restaurants seating more than 50 people to set
aside a quarter of their seats for non-smokers.
   David Hudgins, a spokesman for the group Greensboro to Alleviate
Smoking Pollution, rejected the notion that voters were sacrificing
jobs for their health because Lorillard Inc., the big cigarette
company, employs about 2,000 people in the area.
   ``I don't think it's going to cost you any jobs,'' Hudgins said.
``It's just going to give everybody a place of quiet enjoyment to go
out and be happy together and get along.''
   But opponents saw the defeat as an invasion of individual rights.
   ``I am surprised that citizens are not more concerned about
individual rights than they showed at the polls today,'' said Earl
Jaggers, president of the local Tobacco Workers Union at Lorillard.
``This could have a snowball effect.''

   East Germany's ruling Politburo resigned Wednesday
at the request of the country's new Communist leader, Egon Krenz,
the official news agency ADN said.
   The resignation of the Communist Party's top leaders came one day
after the 44-member Cabinet handed in its resignation in response to
a mass movement by the people for free elections and speech and
unrestricted travel abroad.
   In a brief dispatch, ADN said Krenz, who on Oct. 18 replaced
longtime leader Erich Honecker, ``suggested'' the Politburo
resignation ``so that the responsibility for the current situation
can be made clear.''
   ADN said nothing about any change in the status of Krenz, who is
both Communist Party chief and the nation's president.
   Eight seats on the 21-member Politburo were already vacant before
Wednesday's resignation.
   The turmoil in the leadership comes as East Germany loses
thousands of young workers a day to emigration and as citizens by
the hundreds of thousand take to the streets nearly to protest the
Communist Party's political monopoly.

<TEXT>
   Voters approved a new city charter that gives
more power to the mayor and an expanded City Council in the most
sweeping overhaul of the municipal government since the five-borough
city was formed in 1898.
   The charter that passed Tuesday would wipe out the powerful,
eight-member Board of Estimate and transfer most of its powers to
the mayor and a City Council enlarged from 35 to 51 members.
   With 99 percent of the 5,243 precincts reporting, the vote was
493,853, or 55 percent, for Proposal 2, which encompassed most of
the changes, and 410,249, or 45 percent, against.
   Frederick A.O. Schwartz Jr., chairman of the commission that
drafted the charter, said it would provide ``a more democratic
government, a government people can understand and a more efficient
government.''
   Before the new charter can go into effect, it must be approved by
the Justice Department, which under the federal Voting Rights Act is
charged with deciding whether local governmental changes would
diminish minority political power. The department should rule in
December.
   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in March that the city's current
form of government _ specifically, the Board of Estimate _ was
unconstitutional.
   Created shortly after the boroughs consolidated into one city,
the board has broad authority over contracts and planning, and
approves the annual budget.
   It consists of the five borough presidents, who have one vote
each, and the three officials elected citywide _ the mayor,
comptroller and City Council president _ who have two votes each.
   Since the boroughs have widely disparate populations _ from
350,000 in Staten Island to Brooklyn's 2.2 million _ the high court
ruled that allowing them one vote each on the board violated the
principle of one-person, one-vote.
   There were conflicting impressions citywide whether the board
would end up improving or diminishing the influence of selected
boroughs and their ethnic populations.
   Staten Island, the city's least populated borough, was the one
clear loser; some of its residents have formed a Secessionist party
to consider leaving New York.
   The borough's residents, however, ousted incumbent borough
President Ralph Lamberti, who was a strong opponent of the new
charter, running both as a Democrat and a Secessionist.
   Guy Molinari, who defeated Lamberti, said, ``I think that I can
work very well with the new charter.''
   If the charter is accepted by the Justice Department, budget
authority would pass to the City Council in January, and the Board
of Estimate would disappear in September.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Fed Action Expected to Result in Lower Interest Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most commercial banks are likely to cut
short-term interest rates in response to steps taken over the past
two days by Federal Reserve officials, according to a published
report.
   Financial analysts predict the Fed action means that most banks
are likely to cut their 10.5 percent prime lending rate to 10
percent, probably before the end of the week, according to today's
editions of The Washington Post.
   Sources told the Post the decision to cut short-term rates was
made Monday during a telephone conference call meeting of the Fed's
top policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee.
   Later that day, the nation's central bank began to supply extra
cash to the banking system and followed Tuesday with a similar move,
the newspaper said. Those actions resulted in the federal funds rate
being lowered from 8.75 percent to just over 8.5 percent, the paper
said.
   The federal funds rate is the interest rate financial
institutions charge one another on overnight loans. Its level
broadly determines most other short-term interest rates.
   The drop in the federal funds rate is the fifth since the Fed
began to loosen its control on credit at the end of May, which
marked the reversal of a yearlong effort to hold down inflation by
slowing growth. The most recent previous cut came last month after a
sharp drop in the stock market.
   The Post said that in Monday's decision, Fed officials were
responding to recent statistics that have convinced many economists
that growth will drop to the 1 percent or 2 percent range by early
next year, the lowest since 1986.
   The Federal Reserve did not announce its decision and a Fed
spokesman declined to comment on whether the central bank had
changed its policy, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
   Maine voters endorsed a ban on cruise
missile flights over the state and backers of the voter initiative
pledged to take their fight to Washington to make the non-binding
expression of sentiment stick.
   Tuesday's vote was ``a first step toward stopping the cruise
missile tests,'' said Eric Johnson, campaign manager for the
anti-missile forces.
   With 587 of 666 precincts reporting, opponents of missile testing
led by 104,281 to 94,776, or 52 percent to 48 percent.
   The Navy launches unarmed but nuclear-capable Tomahawk missiles
from submarines. The missiles fly 500 to 6,000 feet above the ground
to targets at the Navy Survival School in Rangeley.
   Test ban backers object to nuclear weapons on moral and economic
grounds. Opponents of the measure argued nuclear strategy is a
federal issue, and said as long as the nation maintains a nuclear
arsenel it should be tested.
   Gov. John R. McKernan opposed the initiative but said he'd press
the issue with Maine's congressional delegation, ``if that is the
request of the majority.''
   The election held a mixed message for anti-nuclear forces.
   The voters ratified a state contract for disposing of low-level
nuclear waste at a special dump in Beatty, Nev. The contract,
approved by the Legislature but requiring clearance from the voters,
was opposed by those who have campaigned to shut down the Maine
Yankee atomic power plant.
   With 88 percent of the precincts reporting, the contract was
endorsed by 106,114 to 88,279, or 55 percent to 45 percent.

<HEAD>Texas Voters Reject Raise for Lawmakers; Reforms Urged</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HOLMES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State House and Senate leaders said defeat
of a pay raise for lawmakers doesn't mean Texans are demanding
ethics reform, but others in and out of government say that's
exactly what the voters meant.
   ``The defeat of Proposition 1 shows that Texans want reform
before raises,'' said Tom Smith, director of the government watchdog
group Public Citizen.
   In final unofficial returns, the pay-raising Proposition 1 was
defeated by nearly 2-to-1.
   Lawmakers had sought to more than triple their pay, from $7,200 a
year to $23,300, and to eliminate the need for voter approval of
future raises.
   But several lawmakers and activists said revelations that
lobbyists spent nearly $2 million this year to entertain legislators
_ along with tricky ballot wording _ doomed the amendment.
   ``It's a good thing there wasn't a ballot alternative that said
legislators' pay should be lowered,'' said state Sen. Chet Edwards.
   The pay raise _ and its companion Proposition 11 to raise
lawmakers' daily expense allowance from $30 to $81 _ were the only
losers among the 21 constitutional amendments on Tuesday's ballot.
   Voters aproved a referendum to remove from the oath of office
taken by public officials the denial that they bribed anyone.
Officials still would be required to sign a written statement
swearing that they didn't bribe anybody.
   Among other proposals approved by voters: A $500 million water
bond issue that will provide $100 million to put running water and
sewers in the developments called ``colonias'' along the
Texas-Mexico border.

<HEAD>Voters Reject Tax Hike for Children in Washington State</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters statewide overwhelmingly rejected an
initiative that would have raised $360 million for children's
programs.
   Called the Children's Initiative, it won only 33 percent of
Tuesday's vote with 91 percent of precincts reporting.
   Opponents said the measure was vague, would hurt working families
through a tax increase, and amounted to a blank check for
bureaucrats.
   ``I am really stunned it was such a big landslide victory,'' said
Cathy Mickels, head of Mothers' Campaign for Family, the
opposition's point group. ``That tells me the taxpayers of the
state, who have been generous in the past with their tax dollars,
are tired of their money being wasted.''
   Backers, including Gov. Booth Gardner, said the money was needed
for smaller school classes, early childhood education, child-abuse
and drug education, as well as family services. The money would have
been divided equally between children's services and schools.
   ``It's always difficult to pass a tax increase,'' said Jon
LeVeque, initiative campaign chairman.
   If passed, the initiative would have required the Legislature to
raise the money in the next fiscal year. The measure could have
increased King County's sales tax to 9 percent.
   Washington voters have never passed a general tax hike, although
they approved a state income tax in 1932 that later was thrown out
by the state Supreme Court.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Democrat Elizabeth Holtzman said her election as
the city's first woman comptroller, and David Dinkins' election as
its first black mayor usher in a new era in city politics.
   ``My victory and David's victory attest to the fact that New
Yorkers reaffirmed that this is a city of inclusion, where everyone
counts,'' she said late Tuesday.
   Holtzman, the District Attorney in Brooklyn and a former
congresswoman, won 75 percent of he vote. Republican Albert Lemishow
was a distant second with 19 percent. Five other candidates ran.
   The job opened up when Harrison J. Goldin made an unsuccessful
bid for the Democratic nomination for mayor.
   Voters also approved a new city charter that abolishes the
powerful Board of Estimate, an eight-member panel on which the city
comptroller had an equal vote with the mayor.
   But Holtzman, 48, said the city charter changes would give the
comptroller additional auditing duties that will make her position
more important.
   The $105,000-a-year post carries a variety of fiscal oversight
responsibilities, including management of the city's
multi-billion-dollar pension funds, which Holtzman said might be
used for economic development and housing.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar eased in quiet European trading late
this morning and currency dealers said the market was waiting to see
whether key U.S. interest rates would fall.
   Gold prices were higher, but off their overnight peaks.
   Dealers said Thursday's scheduled release of U.S. producer price
figures for October could provide some clues to the direction of
interest rates.
   A higher-than-expected figure would probably leave interest rates
untouched, they said, while the Federal Reserve could have grounds
to loosen credit policy if the figure is in line with the 0.2
percent rise analysts have predicted.
   The postponement of a Treasury auction Tuesday added fuel to
speculation about an imminent cut in U.S. rates, dealers said.
   Other dealers said the resignation of the East German government
and the increasing flow of refugees out of that country into West
Germany could start casting a shadow over the Deutsche mark.
   ``The market is very, very nervous'' about events in East
Germany, said Bill Sutton, a foreign exchange manager at Merrill
Lynch International Bank in London. ``It's very difficult for the
market to evaluate.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.66 yen to a closing 142.97 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 142.73 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.8398 West German marks, down from 1.8442
   _1.6135 Swiss francs, down from 1.6175
   _6.2365 French francs, down from 6.2520
   _2.0764 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0820
   _1,344.50 Italian lire, down from 1,349.00
   _$1.1693 Canadian, down from $1.1705
   In London, the dollar fell slightly against the British pound. It
cost $1.5881 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5810 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $387.50 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $384.50. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $386.95.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $386.50 compared with $384.00 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $6.23 to close at a bid $387.80.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.28 a troy ounce,
up from Tuesday's $5.26.

   A small Navy research and
recovery submarine carrying a crew of three broke free early today
after being entangled in cables for nine hours under nearly 1,300
feet of water, officials said.
   ``It broke free and is ascending to surface,'' said Lt. Sonja
Hedley, a public affairs officer at the Naval Submarine Base in San
Diego. ``We don't know how.''
   The crewmen inside the Deep Submerged Vehicle Turtle, as the
vessel is known, had a three-day supply of air and were never in any
danger, Navy spokesman Cmdr. Doug Schamp said.
   Thier names weren't immediately available.
   ``They are fine,'' Schamp said.
   The 26-foot-long submersible, which weighs 24 tons, became
entangled about 4:15 p.m. Tuesday while conducting maintenance on an
underwater sonar array in Wilson Cove, said Coast Guard Petty
Officer Reid Crispino.
   A pair of Navy vessels that were headed for the area where the
submersible was trapped off San Clemente Island, about 70 miles
northwest of San Diego, apparently won't be needed, Hedley said.
   The ships were carrying an unmmanned vehicle with cable cutters
to free the submersible. Also aboard was a manned rescue vehicle,
the Avalon, which would have been used to rescue the trapped crewmen
if the unmmanned vessel had been unable to untangle it, she said.
   The trapped vessel's mother ship, the Choueste, remained in the
area throughout the ordeal. Its officers were able to communicate
with the three crewmen by underwater phone.
   The Turtle, launched in 1968, is assigned to Submarine
Development Group 1 at the Navy Submarine Base at Point Loma near
San Diego.

<HEAD>Doctor: Kitty Dukakis in Hospital for Nausea, Dizziness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCIS HOPKINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kitty Dukakis was under observation today in an
intensive care unit for nausea and dizziness, but officials declined
to reveal details of her illness.
   The wife of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis was feeling ``very poorly''
and wanted little else revealed to the public, said Dr. Gerald R.
Plotkin, the governor's personal physician.
   ``Kitty doesn't want to discuss any more about her condition,''
Plotkin said at a Tuesday night news conference. ``We don't want to
say any more.''
   Mrs. Dukakis, 52, underwent four weeks of treatment for
alcoholism earlier this year at a Rhode Island facility and has
previously admitted she spent years addicted to diet pills.
   Plotkin refused to answer questions on whether Mrs. Dukakis'
illness was related to her previous alcohol and drug problems.
   ``Although her condition has improved somewhat during the past
few hours, until she feels better and has an opportunity to discuss
her condition with her doctors and to fully evaluate the results of
the tests ... she has asked that no further statements be made,''
Plotkin said.
   Mrs. Dukakis was taken by ambulance on Monday night to Brigham
and Women's Hospital. She underwent tests Tuesday, one year after
the governor was defeated in his presidential bid.
   Dukakis spokeswoman Mindy Lubber had said Mrs. Dukakis was
suffering flu-like symptoms. But Plotkin refused to say whether she
was suffering influenza or whether her life had at any time been in
danger.
   A hospital spokeswoman refused to disclose Mrs. Dukakis'
condition Tuesday night. Mindy Lubber, a spokeswoman for the
governor, said she would be unable to update Mrs. Dukakis' status.
   The governor, who spent all Tuesday at his wife's side, cancelled
all appointments scheduled today.
   Lubber said Plotkin went to the Dukakis's Brookline home Monday
night after Mrs. Dukakis awoke ``feeling particularly ill'' and
recommended she be taken to the hospital.
   ``After five days at home during which Mrs. Dukakis experienced
dizziness, headaches and severe nausea, she was admitted to the
hospital ... she is continuing to experience those same symptoms''
Tuesday, Plotkin said.
   A year ago, Mrs. Dukakis was admitted to a Minneapolis hospital
for observation after she suffered a fever and chills one week
before her husband lost his presidential bid.
   The Dukakises were married June 20, 1963, and have three
children, one of them from Mrs. Dukakis' first marriage. They live
in Brookline, a short distance from the hospital.
   Dukakis' 86-year-old mother, Euterpe Dukakis, meanwhile, was in
satisfactory condition at Beth Israel Hospital, where she was
admitted Monday after experiencing repeated fainting spells, said
spokeswoman Laurie Veno.
   Plotkin said the governor's mother was doing well and would
likely be released from the hospital by week's end.

   Seattle residents elected their first black mayor
in a vote winner Norman B. Rice hailed as proof the predominantly
white city deserves its reputation for progressive politics.
   Rice, 46, a three-term City Council member, defeated his neighbor
and one-time political ally, three-term City Attorney Douglas N.
Jewett on Tuesday in an election dominated by an anti-busing school
initiative.
   Jewett, 43, helped draft the so-called ``Save Our Schools''
initiative, and used it as his main campaign vehicle only to watch
it run out of gas.
   Rice, who had announced he would not run for mayor again after
losing to incumbent Charles Royer in 1985 and failing in a bid for
Congress last year, changed his mind and entered the 30 minutes
before the filing deadline. He cited the anti-busing initiative as
the main reason.
   Rice defeated Jewett 93,491 votes to 67,276 _ or 58 percent to 42
percent.
   The fate of the initiative was undecided with 99.9 percent of the
vote counted: The count was 64,447 against, to 64,377 in favor, or
50.04 percent yes to 49.96 percent no.
   ``Hear me well. Hear me well,'' Rice told cheering supporters.
``Seattle can be proud of itself tonight _ proud because we're a
thinking people, a thinking city and a city that cares and a city
that lives up to the progressivity that stands so high and makes it
the most livable city in the United States.''
   Rice's victory was particularly notable in light of the fact only
10 percent of the city's population is black.
   The Seattle election was one of several that resulted in firsts
for blacks. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia claimed victory as the
nation's first black elected governor and David Dinkins as the first
black mayor of New York.
   The initiative asked but did not require the independently
elected and self-budgeting city School Board to halt mandatory
busing of students for racial balance. In exchange, about $4.5
million in city tax revenue would be earmarked for ``magnet''
programs to achieve racial balance in school enrollment.
   Early in the evening, Rice received congratulatory telephone
calls from Dinkins, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Democratic National
Committee chairman Ron Brown and Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass.
   Only after Jewett conceded at 11:20 p.m. PST, however, did Rice
claim victory.
   Jewett, a moderate Republican who once tried to form a third
party, said he might have lost because of his GOP affiliation in the
strongly liberal, Democratic city.
   ``Norm and I started the race as friends and we've ended the race
as friends, and I look forward to supporting Norm in every way
possible during his administration as mayor,'' Jewett said.
   Royer, who served an unprecedented three four-year terms as mayor
and is a former president of the National League of Cities, has
accepted the position of director of the Institute of Politics at
the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
   The initiative asked but did not require the independently
elected and self-budgeting city School Board to halt mandatory
busing of students for racial balance. In exchange, about $4.5
million in city tax revenue would be earmarked for ``magnet''
programs to achieve racial balance in school enrollment.

   Thai officials said today that more
bodies were being plucked from the Gulf of Thailand, bringing the
known casualties from Typhoon Gay to nearly 200 dead with more than
400 still missing.
   The navy said it had recovered 58 bodies from the gulf since the
typhoon struck Friday with 100 mph winds. The Interior Ministry said
111 people had died on the Thai mainland.
   The Fisheries Department said 447 fishermen were still missing
along with nearly 100 of their craft.
   The American oil company Unocal said its rescue vessels had
picked up 27 bodies in the seas around its drilling ship Seacrest,
which capsized in the typhoon. It was not known whether these bodies
were crewmen from the Seacrest which overturned with 97 people on
board.
   Richard C. Keller, in charge of rescue operations at Unocal in
Bangkok, said at least 19 of these were from the Seacrest because
they wore life jackets bearing the Unocal company logo.
   To date, Unocal has confirmed six survivors and seven bodies
recovered from among its crew from 13 nations.
   Unocal said the search was continuing with the help of the Thai
navy.
   The typhoon, which swept over the gulf, then moved into southern
Thailand, is described as the worst to hit the country in 35 years.

<TEXT>
   City voters rejected a new baseball stadium
for the San Francisco Giants and a ``domestic partners'' law, while
suburban Concord repealed a measure that banned discrimination
against people with AIDS.
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos, who campaigned hard for the new
ballpark, conceded defeat early today on the measure known as
Proposition P. With all 621 precincts counted, 86,592, or 50.5
percent, voted Tuesday against it, to 84,618, or 49.4 percent, in
favor.
   City election workers still had 2,000 to 3,000 absentee ballots
to count, but Agnos said, ``It won't be enough to make a
difference.'' The measure called for construction of a new stadium
to replace Candlestick Park for the National League champions.
   Giants' owner Bob Lurie said the team would play at cold, windy,
foggy Candlestick next year but was uncertain where the club would
play in 1991.
   ``The Giants and their fans now face an uncertain future,'' Lurie
said.
   Opponents said the new ballpark was unnecessary and untimely,
considering San Francisco's other post-earthquake needs. The measure
would have committed San Francisco to contributing $40 million for a
waterfront stadium in China Basin, four miles south of Candlestick.
   Expense also was an issue in Proposition S, designed to provide
the same legal rights received by married couples to unmarried city
workers living together as ``domestic partners.''
   The measure appeared to lose, 84,060 to 82,342, with the absentee
votes out.
   Backers said all the measure does is extend hospital visitation
and bereavement leave to these couples, but opponents feared it
would open the door to providing other rights and expensive services
later.
   Voters passed a measure calling for the sale of $60 million in
bonds for repairs from damage due to the earthquake three weeks ago.
The measure passed 143,453, or 87.2 percent, to 20,995, or 12.7
percent.
   In Concord, a city of about 100,000 that is 40 miles east of San
Francisco, voters passed an initiative to repeal a city
council-passed ordinance banning discrimination against anyone
suffering from AIDS or testing positive for the virus that causes
the deadly disease.
   The final vote was 13,438 to 10,514.
   Fliers sent out before the election criticized the ordinance as
giving special benefits to prostitutes, drug addicts and homosexuals
_ all at high risk of contracting AIDS.
   Health officials, however, rallied behind the measure, saying
they believed it would help slow the spread of AIDS by encouraging
potential victims to seek testing, treatment and education without
fear of reprisal.
   In the Southern California city of Irvine, voters approved a
measure that denies homosexuals protection under a municipal
anti-discrimination ordinance, 11,482 to 10,328. The measure removes
the phrase ``sexual orientation'' from Irvine's human-rights
ordinance, which bans discrimination based on age, sex, religion,
race, disability or marital status.

<HEAD>Actor Acquitted of Attempted Murder In Drug-Dealer Shooting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Todd Bridges, an admitted cocaine addict
who wept on the witness stand while telling of suicidal tendencies,
was acquitted of attempted murder in the shooting of a drug dealer.
   Jurors also acquitted Bridges of attempted voluntary manslaughter
Tuesday, but told Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Florence-Marie
Cooper they were deadlocked on an assault charge.
   Deliberations were scheduled to resume deliberations today.
   Bridges, 24, played actor Gary Coleman's brother Willis on the TV
series ``Diff'rent Strokes'' for eight years. He testified he became
depressed and turned to drugs after the situation comedy was
canceled in 1986.
   The defendant, dressed in a gray suit, white basketball shoes and
wearing wire-rimmed eyeglasses, displayed no emotion when the
verdict was read.
   The actor was charged with firing eight shots at Kenneth ``Tex''
Clay and slashing his throat during a Feb. 2 attack in a
South-Central Los Angeles house where crack cocaine was sold.
   Clay, 25, survived and testified that Bridges was intoxicated
from smoking cocaine at the time of the attack.
   ``He looked like his eyes were about to jump out of his head,''
Clay said.
   Jurors said they could reach a verdict on the assault charge if
given more instructions from the judge, said Sandi Gibbons, a
spokeswoman for the district attorney's office.
   In trial testimony, Clay described himself as a bodyguard for the
owner of the crack house where Bridges was living. He told of
arguments stemming from Bridges' alleged sale of weapons belonging
to the crack-dealing operation.
   Bridges testified that Clay borrowed his BMW automobile and never
returned it. The actor said that on the night of the shooting Clay
hit him, pushed him over a fence and locked him out of the house.
   However, he said he was so intoxicated that he couldn't remember
shooting Clay.
   Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran maintained Bridges shot Clay in
self-defense.

<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan apologized
to the entertainment industry for his recent criticism of American
TV and movies but said Hollywood should forge a new code for
self-censorship.
   Reagan's speech to more than 1,000 members of the Hollywood Radio
and Television Society was billed as an address on the ``unfinished
business'' of his presidency, but he focused instead on his comments
in Japan last month denigrating U.S. film and TV productions.
   The former actor said Tuesday the industry should voluntarily
police vulgarity and tastelessness to avoid government intervention.
   ``The federal government has tried to interfere too much and too
often,'' said Reagan.
   ``Censorship or restriction should be within,'' he said,
suggesting voluntary standards similar to the Hays Code, which held
sway through the 1950s.
   Reagan said he was appalled by what he sees in movies and on
television.
   ``You can call me a blockhead or a prude if you want, but ... if
I was offered a script and told I had to say those words I would
have turned down the script,'' he said.
   Reagan said in Japan that he supported Sony's $3.4 billion
acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Corp.
   ``I'm not too proud of Hollywood these days with the immorality
that is shown in pictures and the vulgarity,'' he said in a TV
interview broadcast Oct. 25 in Japan.
   ``I just have a feeling that maybe Hollywood needs some outsiders
to bring back decency and good taste to some of the pictures that
are being made.''
   Reagan began his speech Tuesday with his apology.
   ``I'm sorry I was a little tardy in getting here today,'' he
said. ``You see, my dentist was running late. He had a little
difficulty in removing from my mouth the last piece of shoe leather
I acquired in Japan.
   ``I'm glad he did, though. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to enjoy
this wonderful lunch _ there's nothing like crow souffle followed by
humble pie.''
   The former president also defended the $2 million a Japanese
company paid him for a series of appearances.
   ``That's what was offered and I didn't protest. ... I just
thought that in 16 years I hadn't made any kind of money,'' Reagan
said.

<TEXT>
   A woman let an unwed teen-ager and
reluctant mother-to-be enter a hospital under her name to give
birth, then claimed the newborn as her own, police said.
   Police said they had not decided whether to bring charges against
the women, whose identities were not released.
   ``It was not a plot for money or anything. It was just one woman
wanted the baby and the other didn't. It was just a dumb way to go
about it,'' Detective Ann Osika said Tuesday.
   The ruse was discovered because the infant's mother ``told too
many people'' and ``the lies she told finally caught up with her,''
Osika said.
   The baby was born Sept. 22 at St. Vincent's Medical Center.
Police began investigating last Wednesday, and two days later, the
infant's would-be mother turned the child over to authorities. The
infant is in foster care.
   The 29-year-old Bridgeport woman who pretended to be the child's
mother has children of her own and ``just felt very sorry for the
baby,'' Osika said. ``She heard about the system where babies go
unwanted.''
   The woman had heard through a mutual friend of the 18-year-old
Derby teen-ager's desire to give up her child, police said. Police
said the woman pretended to be pregnant so people would believe the
baby was hers.
   Neither the hospital nor the woman's doctor was aware the new
mother had assumed another woman's identity and insurance documents,
police said. The teen-ager also assumed the older woman's identity
during a prenatal visit in her eighth month of pregnancy, Osika said.
   The child's mother, whose whereabouts remained unknown Tuesday,
could face charges of abandonment, criminal impersonation and
forgery, Osika said. The older woman could be charged with
conspiracy, the detective said.
   Osika said police did not know why the teen-ager did not simply
put the baby up for adoption.

<TEXT>
   A judge who said she wanted to keep a
child molester from ``slinking back into the dark'' has ordered the
man to buy a newspaper ad with his picture, an apology and a plea
for others to get help.
   Superior Court Judge Corinne P. Grande gave Stephen
Germershausen, 29, until Friday to buy the 4- by 6-inch ad in The
Providence Journal-Bulletin. The judge on Oct. 26 also placed
Germershausen on 35 years' probation.
   He pleaded guilty to fondling three children, ages 8 to 11, and
sexually assaulting one of them two years ago.
   ``I thought, if he goes to jail, that's good because he'll be
locked up; and while he's locked up, he's not going to hurt anybody
anymore,'' Grande said.
   ``But then I thought, once he got out, he'd go slinking back into
the dark, and no one ever would know what he had done.''
   Grande said ``there doesn't appear to be a sufficient social
response to people like Stephen Germershausen. So I thought about
other children and wondered whether I could use the sentencing
process to effect some change.''
   ``I think that this type of punishment by humiliation is not an
appropriate form of punishment,'' said Stephen Brown, executive
director of the Rhode Island chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union.
   Defense attorney Robert B. Mann said that Germershausen had
undergone intensive therapy and that a report suggested he was ``no
longer a threat.''
   Gerhershausen's picture must carry a caption that identifies him
as a child molester and also reads:
   ``If you are a child molester, get professional help immediately
or you may find your picture and name in the paper and your life
under control of the state. This ad is being published by order of
the Superior Court judge who sentenced me.''
   Grande also ordered Germershausen to contribute $1,000 to a
program to help child victims of sexual abuse.
   In Portland, Ore., a judge in 1987 ordered a child molester to
hang a sign on his door warning children to stay away. Judges in
Florida have ordered people convicted of drunken driving to use
bumper stickers announcing their misdeeds.

<HEAD>FBI Probe Ordered in Secret State Police Taping</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The State Police commander faces an FBI
probe and calls for his firing over his department's practice of
secretly taping telephone calls between suspects and their lawyers.
   ``I don't think he should be around anymore,'' state Rep. Richard
Tulisano said of Col. Lester J. Forst.
   After the taping was disclosed Tuesday, U.S. Attorney Stanley A.
Twardy Jr. ordered the FBI to investigate and Gov. William A.
O'Neill ordered a halt to the taping at State Police barracks. The
practice was disclosed Tuesday by The Hartford Courant.
   ``I was not aware such a practice existed and my immediate
reaction is that it is unnecessary and inappropriate,'' the governor
said in a statement.
   Forst was on vacation in Alaska and unavailable for comment
Tuesday. He was appointed by O'Neill in 1981.
   The Courant reported that State Police routinely record virtually
all calls to and from their barracks and have taped calls between
suspects and lawyers for at least a year and possibly as long as 10
years at some barracks.
   Sgt. Richard J. Sealander Jr., a State Police spokesman, defended
the taping as harmless, saying police do not actually monitor the
conversations.
   ``No one is listening to the tapes,'' he said.
   The practice stunned defense attorneys, who called the taping
blatantly illegal and said it could jeopardize past and present
cases and expose the State Police to lawsuits, large fines and
criminal charges.
   ``That is really scary. Unbelievable. Outrageous,'' said lawyer
Hubert J. Santos. ``There goes the right to counsel.''
   ``I would think that pending cases are subject to dismissal and
that convictions are likely to be overturned,'' said Margaret Levy,
a defense attorney.
   O'Neill called the policy ``deeply disturbing'' and assigned
Attorney General Clarine Nardi Riddle, the chief state's attorney
and the governor's legal counsel to investigate.
   Tulisano called for Forst's dismissal.
   ``If I were a State Police officer, I would be damned upset to
find out that every conversation I had with anybody _ even my spouse
_ was being tape-recorded by my supervisors,'' Tulisano said.

<TEXT>
   Jordanians voted for a new Parliament today
in the first nationwide elections in 22 years, part of a democratic
initiative by King Hussein after riots over price increases left 10
people dead.
   ``A phase has ended in our lives and a new one is beginning
today,'' Hussein told reporters during a visit to the campaign press
center.
   Nearly 259,000 voters cast ballots by noon, almost 30 percent of
those eligible, Interior Ministry spokesman Salameh Hamad said.
Women voted for the first time in a general election since winning
the right in 1974.
   In the first nationwide election since Jordan renounced claims to
the Israeli-occupied West Bank, 648 candidates _ including 12 women
_ ran for 80 seats. Hussein said the new Parliament would be
convened soon and that he would name a new Cabinet shortly after
that.
   First returns were expected late today, and officials said they
hoped to have complete but unofficial results on Thursday.
   The revamped Parliament _ with no representatives from the West
Bank of the Jordan River _ put the seal on Hussein's decision to
recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization's claim to the area.
   Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East War. Loss
of the territory, which held half of the 60 seats in the old
Parliament, had made national elections impossible.
   Hussein suspended Parliament in 1974 and revived it a decade
later. Jordan's monarchs have used their powers repeatedly to
suspend the legislature and the previous Parliament was passive.
   Under the new system, Parliament must approve all laws and can
override a royal veto and remove Cabinets.
   Despite martial law and a 33-year-old ban on political parties,
the king's government allowed political groups to run slates openly
for the first time since 1956. It was one of the most open contests
ever held in the Arab world.
   Competing for the support of 877,000 registered voters were
Islamic fundamentalists, tribal sheiks, Communists, businessmen and
former political prisoners.
   Urban candidates addressed rallies attended by thousands while
some rural aspirants offered traditional camel-meat feasts to voters
at Bedouin camps. The fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood last week
held the campaign's largest rally, attracting more than 5,000 people
to a soccer field near downtown Amman.
   There is no organized governing party and the leader or party
that succeeds in forming a government will have to forge alliances
to gain a parliamentary majority.
   Political observers predicted the Moslem Brotherhood could gain
between 12 and 20 seats in Parliament, making it a major bloc.
   ``They are going to help the poor people,'' Mufad Abdullah, a
23-year-old unemployed vocational school graduate, said of the
Moslem Brotherhood. He spoke at a rally attended by several hundred
people chanting the party's slogan, ``God Is great, Islam is the
solution.''
   The new Parliament must deal with rising unemployment and a 50
percent fall in the value of the national currency, the dinar, which
sent prices of imported goods soaring.
   With few natural resources to support its 3 million people,
Jordan is suffering an economic crisis brought about partly by a
drop in money sent home by Jordanian workers in Persian Gulf
countries where the oil boom has ended.
   April riots against price increases for gasoline, auto fees,
telephone service, heating oil, cigarettes and alcoholic beverages
led to the resignation of Prime Minister Zaid Rifai's government.

   Miss West Virginia has been charged with
brandishing a gun after an auto accident damaged the white sports
coupe that is one the spoils of her office.
   Lisa Bittinger, a 19-year-old who came under fire after the Miss
America Pageant for remarks deemed racist, was arrested with another
motorist after the two swore out complaints against each other
Tuesday, said Police Chief Ed DeVito.
   Miss Bittinger and Tammy Boyce, 23, were freed on $200 bail.
   Bittinger said Boyce forced her 1989 Chevrolet Beretta off the
road and into a utility pole, causing damage estimated by police at
$4,000. Immediately afterward, Bittinger brandished a handgun,
police said.
   Bittinger and a passenger were treated for minor injuries.
   Brandishing a gun carries up to six months in jail and a $200
fine.
   Boyce was charged with battery, destruction of property and
reckless driving.
   The beauty queen came under fire earlier this year for remarks
she made upon her return from the Miss America pageant, at which she
failed to make the top 10.
   ``If it's political, it's not my fault,'' she said. ``If you look
at the top 10, it's quite obvious. It was one black, one Korean, one
Japanese, one hearing impaired, one kidney implant, and of course
Texas and Florida were part of the top 10. It makes you wonder.''
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
called for her resignation.

<TEXT>
   Voters streamed to the polls today, many
after being thwarted by long lines the day before, to elect an
assembly that is to write a constitution and declare Namibia
independent from South Africa.
   Many voters camped overnight to keep their places in line after
they were unable to reach the polling booths Tuesday.
   Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the U.N. monitoring force, said about
30 percent of the 701,483 registered voters cast their ballots
Tuesday, a figure he called ``extremely encouraging.''
   Several polling stations on Tuesday stayed open hours past
closing time while others ran out of ballots and ink as they
accomodated the crush of voters. At least one line was a mile long.
   Lines were shorter today, the second of five days of
U.N.-supervised balloting in the predominantly black territory for
the 72-member assembly. Seats will be allocated according to the
proportion of votes each of the 10 political parties receive.
   Officials said voting could be extended to Sunday if necessary
and that results could be announced on Wednesday of next week.
   Eckhard said there had been scattered incidents of intimidation
and distribution of bogus pamphlets aimed at discrediting the
favored party, the South-West Africa People's Organization, known as
SWAPO. These actions ``degrade a process which is otherwise being
carried out with self-control and dignity,'' he said.
   The main election issue is whether the left-leaning SWAPO, which
fought a 23-year guerrilla war, will get the two-thirds of the seats
necessary to write a charter without consulting any of the other
parties.
   Its main rival is the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, a
multiracial coalition that favors a capitalist economy and was part
of a transitional government installed by South Africa.
   The chairman of the alliance, white farmer Dirk Mudge, accused
the South African government and news media of deciding in advance
that SWAPO was sure to win.
   ``We are already fighting an uphill battle without it being made
more difficult,'' he said.
   Eckhard said U.N. officials were investigating allegations that
alliance supporters forced Angolans across the northern Namibian
border and pressured them to vote. He stressed that no one could
vote who had not already been registered.
   Gerhard Roux, spokesman for the territorial government, said,
``The people of our country will forever remember ... the feeling of
expectation and election fervor'' of the day.
   He said one cause of the long delays was the large number of
people who arrived to vote without bringing identification or voter
registration cards.
   Some white South Africans, eligible to vote because they used to
live in Namibia, flew on special chartered flights to vote at
Windhoek's airport.
   To reach some remote areas of the sparsely populated territory,
helicopters were being used as mobile polling booths, flying to a
different village each day.
   An estimated 60 percent of Namibia's voters are illiterate. The
318,252-square-mile territory, rich in minerals, had a population of
1.3 million in 1981, when the last census was taken.
   Sporadic violence and intimidation marred the four-month
campaign, including the assassination Sept. 12 of Anton Lubowski,
the only prominent white member of SWAPO.
   South Africa captured South-West Africa from Germany in 1915 and
governed it under a League of Nations mandate.
   The United Nations revoked the mandate in 1966 and, after South
Africa refused to leave, the SWAPO insurgency began. More than
20,000 people, most of them guerrillas, were killed in the bush war.
   Last year, South Africa agreed to a U.N.-brokered accord calling
for Namibia's transition to independence. SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma
said the group would accept any election result certified by the
United Nations.

<HEAD>Talks with Minister Break Down, Miners Fear Crackdown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking Arctic miners said today that talks with
the minister of the coal industry have broken down and that they
feared the government was preparing to crack down on the 2-week-old
walkout.
   Coal Industry Minister Mikhail Shchadov left Vorkuta after
failing in a meeting Monday to convince workers to return to their
jobs, and warning that the strikers could be held financially
responsible for losses, said Sergei Kozlov, a strike leader at the
Vargashor mine.
   ``Everything is ready for repression,'' Kozlov said. A regional
court on Oct. 27 found the strike to be illegal and mine directors
have started taking the names of workers who organized the walkouts,
he said.
   Vargashor is the largest of a dozen mines on strike in the Arctic
coal basin. Miners there walked off their jobs Oct. 25, complaining
that the government had not improved living and working conditions
as it promised in July.
   The government was forced to make those promises to end a
nationwide walkout last summer of thousands of coal miners. During
this strike, miners also have made political demands that include
removing an article of the Soviet Constitution that declares the
Communist Party to be the leading force in Soviet society.
   Miners want Moscow to send a commission that is empowered to
negotiate the miners' demands, Kozlov said.
   ``We don't care who leads it as long as they have the power to
decide,'' he said. Kozlov added that some miners want Premier
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov to negotiate with them.
   Ryzhkov on Sunday appealed to the miners in a telegram to go back
to work because the country is short on coal as the winter season
approaches. He said the government's record on fulfilling its
promises will be reviewed at a meeting in Moscow on Nov. 17.
   But Kozlov said the miners did not return to work because Ryzhkov
had not offered them anything.
   Miners' estimates of the number who have walked off their jobs
have varied between 15,000 and 30,000.
   The news agency Tass said coal production in the area was 236,000
tons short of the target for the first six days of November.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Says ``Civil War'' Inevitable in Cambodia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Hun Sen said today that
civil war in his country is unavoidable because other nations are
funneling arms to guerrillas bent on testing his government on the
battlefield.
   In an interview with the official Cambodian news agency SPK, Hun
Sen downplayed recent victories by a three-party opposition
coalition that includes the Khmer Rouge and two non-Communist groups.
   He accused China, the United States, France, the United Kingdom,
Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand of involvement in the military
activities of the guerrillas.
   Hun Sen said a number of countries had not honored their
commitments to cease military aid to the coalition after Vietnam
said it completed the withdrawal of all its forces in late
September. Rebels say some of the troops remain.
   ``Hence a civil war is inevitable in Cambodia. The Khmer
reactionary forces and their outside supporters are intending to
make a test of forces in the military field within six months before
they engage in a new round of talks,'' Hun Sen said.
   ``We are still advocating the settlement of the conflict through
negotiations,'' he said in the interview that took place in Phnom
Penh, was carried by SPK and monitored in Bangkok.
   He said the first stage of the guerrilla's strategy was to seize
the northwestern provinces of Battambang, Siem Reap and Bantey
Meanchey.
   ``Over the past months, the enemy have made the highest possible
efforts in their military campaigns involving almost all the armed
forces of the three Khmer reactionary factions,'' he said.
   But he said the coalition's ``noisy claims about their so-called
victories are nothing but a ploy of their psychological warfare.''
   Since the Vietnamese troop pullout, the Khmer Rouge have seized
the gem-mining town of Pailin and moved towards Cambodia's
second-largest city, Battambang. The Khmer People's National
Liberation Front and a group loyal to coalition leader Prince
Norodom Sihanok have captured a number of government positions in
the northwest.
   The Cambodian army is supplied by weapons from the Soviet Union
and until last month was backed by a formidable Vietnamese force
which invaded the country in late 1978.
   Hun Sen accused China, the United States, France and Singapore of
shipping military supplies to the guerrillas while Thailand, the
United Kingdom, Malaysia and the United States have trained the two
non-Communist groups. China alone, Hun Sen said, was training the
Khmer Rouge.
   The prime minister said Chinese, American and Thai military
advisors plus some Thai mercenaries had joined the guerrillas during
the recent offensive.
   The United States denies sending lethal aid to the two
non-Communist factions but provides other forms of assistance. China
and Thailand have long been the major backers of the coalition.

<HEAD>Actress Jill Ireland's Adopted Son Found Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Jill Ireland's adopted son, who had
battled heroin addiction in recent years, was found dead in his
home, police said today.
   Police found no sign of foul play in the death of 27-year-old
Jason McCallum Bronson, said Detective Don Kalash. ``We do not know
the cause of death at this point. We will have to wait for an
autopsy report,'' he said.
   Bronson, whose mother is married to actor Charles Bronson, was
the focus of his mother's second book, ``Life Lines,'' which was
published earlier this year and recounted his struggle with heroin.
   He made numerous attempts at drug rehabilitation and said in
April he had been clean for two months after one month in a recovery
program.
   ``I just hope, in the end, it can help somebody,'' he said of his
mother's book.
   His body was found by a friend Tuesday night at his Hollywood
Hills home, Kalash said.
   Miss Ireland adopted Jason after she suffered a miscarriage while
married to actor David McCallum of the 1960s TV series ``The Man
From U.N.C.L.E.'' Miss Ireland and McCallum divorced in 1967 and she
married Charles Bronson a year later.
   ``I thought I had adopted the child of a married architect and a
young Irish girl,'' the actress said in a recent interview.
``Instead I had adopted a drug addict's child.''
   She has called the battle to save her son from drugs a greater
trauma than her five-year battle with cancer.
   Miss Ireland starred with Charles Bronson in several action
movies, including ``The Mechanic'' and ``Love and Bullets.''

<TEXT>
   A powerful car bomb exploded today in
Syrian-policed west Beirut, killing four people and wounding 19.
   The blast came shortly before the expected arrival of newly
elected President Rene Mouawad in the city's Moslem sector.
   The booby-trapped car went off in the Caracas neighborhood, about
three blocks from the posh villa where Mouawad planned to stay.
   The presidential palace, traditional seat of the head of state,
is occupied by rebellious army commander Gen. Michel Aoun, who
rejected Mouawad's election Sunday by members of Parliament under a
peace plan Aoun opposes.
   The peace plan shifts political power to the Moslem majority, and
Aoun has specifically criticized it for not including a timetable
for a withdrawal of Syria's estimated 40,000 troops.
   Police said four people were killed and 19 wounded in the blast
today. Window glass of apartment and office buildings was shattered
by the 3:15 p.m. explosion.
   Half a dozen cars were set ablaze in a parking lot as Syrian
soldiers, clutching AK-47 rifles, converged on the scene. They fired
in the air to make way for ambulances and fire engines that raced to
area, the witnesses said, insisting on anonymity.
   Also today, the Lebanese Communist Party chief was quoted as
saying his militia may try to kill Aoun for rejecting the election
of Mouawad, a 64-year-old Maronite Catholic.
   Sources said that before the end of the week, Mouawad would
announce formation of a national reconciliation government to end 14
years of civil war.
   George Hawi, secretary-general of the Syrian-backed Communist
Party, was quoted as saying his militia has among its ranks other
fighters such as Soha Bishara, who tried to kill renegade Lebanese
army Maj. Antoine Lahd in south Lebanon last year. Lahd was wounded
and treated in Israel.
   ``I stress that Soha Bishara who managed to strike at the head of
treason in south Lebanon is capable of reaching the head of the
secessionists and mutineers in east Beirut,'' he told the party
newspaper An-Nida.
   Miss Bishara is still being held by Lahd's Israeli-backed
militia, the South Lebanon Army, which helps patrol Israel's
self-designated ``security zone'' in south Lebanon.
   The party comprises a few hundred fighters, most of them of
Christian families.
   Aoun, who headed a Christian Cabinet in a dual government that
ruled for 13 months, opposes Mouawad because the president advocated
close ties with Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon. Aoun fought
the Syrians for six months this year until an Arab League truce was
enforced in September.
   Aoun commanded about 20,000 Christian troops during the fight
against Syria. But it remains unclear how many troops will continue
to back him in the confrontation with Mouawad.

<HEAD>First Securities Market Founded</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first securities market since the
Communists took power 43 years ago was formally established today,
and one newspaper reported the exchange will develop into a
full-fledged stock market.
   The Financial and Securities Market, to begin operating Dec. 31,
will at first deal only in short-term documents such as banking
certificates and will initially be used only by financial
institutions, said the official Tanjug news agency.
   It will eventually evolve into a full stock market, allowing
individual citizens to participate, reported the
government-supervised newspaper Borba.
   ``We are preparing to have in the future a stock market like any
other ... which will also be connected to international markets,''
said Dragutin Gajic, an advisor in the Yugoslav National Bank, in an
interview with the daily.
   The exchange is a major landmark in efforts of Premier Ante
Markovic to radically reform Yugoslavia's stagnating economy and
bring it into line with Western economic practices.
   The government is seeking parliamentary approval for legislation
allowing government-owned and private enterprises and other
institutions to issue stocks and bonds, which would be dealt with on
the newly-established exchange.
   Founding of the exchange was one of the conditions set by the
International Monetary Fund at last week's round of negotiations
aimed at providing Yugoslavia with continued financial support,
according to press reports.
   The Communists abolished Yugoslavia's three existing stock
exchanges in Belgrade, Zagreb and Ljubljana when they created a
centrally planned economy along Soviet lines in 1946.
   Yugoslavia is currently faced with an annual inflation rate
approaching 1,500 percent, a $17 billion foreign debt and rising
unemployment. Economic performance has stagnated throughout the past
decade.
   Markovic's 6-month-old government is committed to introducing
market mechanisms into the economy as a way out of the crisis and
has already allowed for large-scale private enterprise and foreign
investment. A sweeping reform of the country's innefficient banking
system is also under way.

   A tentative agreement was announced today in the
eight-week-old musicians strike that canceled the New York City
Opera's fall season.
   Terms of the agreement reached late Tuesday were withheld pending
a ratification vote, probably this weekend, said Judy West, speaking

   The strike began Sept. 13, which was to have been opening night
of a 70-performance season. After making progress in negotiations
last week, the company announced that it was going ahead with plans
for its spring season of musicals.
   The opera's 69 orchestra members went on strike over wages and
the number of guaranteed weeks of work per year.
   Under the old contract, orchestra members were paid $755 per
19\-hour week.

<TEXT>
   More than 250 people who worked at the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant during the 1986 accident or helped clean up
after it have died, a newspaper reported today.
   The toll reported by the weekly Moscow News was far higher than
the official toll of 31 killed in the April 26, 1986, explosion and
fire at the plant in the Soviet Ukraine.
   A spokesman for the government agency that is responsible for the
Chernobyl cleanup acknowledged the figure of 250 dead but said only
the 31 could be traced directly to the disaster, the world's worst
atomic accident.
   ``More than 250 people of those who were at work at the time of
the explosion or worked on liquidating the consequences of the 20th
century's greatest accident, have already died,'' Moscow News said.
   It said they died of various illnesses, and that no one can tell
what the full human cost of the disaster will be.
   The article, on a new association of those concerned about the
accident, did not say what the source of the figure was or provide
any more details of it.
   The government newspaper Izvestia also printed a report on the
association, which calls itself simply ``Chernobyl,'' but it did not
use such a figure.
   However, it did say that ``many of those who worked for a long
time in conditions that were dangerous for their health, need help
today.''
   Alexander Karasyuk, an engineer and spokesman for the Kombinat
organization that is handling the cleanup said in a telephone
interview from Kiev: ``We can't say that those 250 died directly
from illnesses caused by radiation.''
   Karasyuk said he is a member of the Chernobyl association.
   The register of the dead included some people who died of
illnesses from which they suffered even before an explosion and fire
ripped through Chernobyl's No. 4 reactor. More scientific study was
needed, he said.
   Further information on the figures could not be obtained
immediately. Most offices in the Soviet Union were closed because
today was taken as a holiday after the celebration of the 72nd
anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.
   The figure of 31 dead, which officials have used as the death
toll since just months after the accident, includes 28 people who
died of radiation sickness, two who died of burns and one who had a
heart attack trying to put out the fire, Karasyuk said.
   Officials say they give regular medical check-ups to thousands of
people who were exposed to radiation in the accident. A radiation
center in Kiev, about 80 miles south of the power plant, has files
on about 600,000 people, the Kombinat spokesman said.
   After the accident, which released a cloud of radioactive
material that circled the world, Soviet officials evacuated
thousands of people in an 18-mile zone around the plant.
   The Chernobyl accident already has cost the Soviet Union billions
of dollars, and spawned a strong anti-nuclear movement. A report in
March said almost a quarter-million people still were living on land
so contaminated that they cannot eat food grown on it, and three
years after the accident officials still are evacuating more people
from the area surrounding the plant.

<HEAD>Lawyers Confer With Mandela, Say He Seeks Black Unity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAM VENTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PAARL, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela, jailed leader of the
African National Congress, appealed today for unity among rival
black organizations, according to lawyers who conferred with him.
   ``His message is about unity, that people should forget about
petty differences,'' said Keith Kunene, one of three officials of
the Black Lawyers Association who met with Mandela for more than
three hours.
   The meeting came amid speculation Mandela is spearheading an
effort to reconcile the African National Congress and a rival
guerrilla movement, the Pan Africanist Congress. A leader of the Pan
Africanist Congress, Jafta Masemola, has been invited to visit
Mandela for several days starting Thursday.
   Mandela, the best-known black leader in South Africa despite
having been jailed since 1962, sent an invitation two weeks ago to
the lawyers.
   One of them, Ernest Moseneke, was a fellow prisoner of Mandela
for 10 years after being convicted at age 15 of illegal activities
on behalf of the Pan Africanist Congress. Another of the lawyers,
Godfrey Pitje, worked closely with Mandela in the African National
Cogress' Youth League in the 1950s and early 60s.
   ``It was very exciting,'' said Pitje of his first sight of
Mandela since 1964. ``I had a difficult task stopping the tears from
flowing.''
   Mandela, 71, was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 for
plotting anti-government sabotage and currently lives in a former
staff residence at Victor Verster prison farm outside Cape Town.
   Last month, eight political prisoners, including Masemola and
five of Mandela's co-defendants in the 1964 trial, were freed
unconditionally. Mandela's release is widely expected within the
next few months.
   The lawyers said Mandela declined to discuss the prospects of his
release. They said he tried unsuccessfully to arrange for the
release of two other political prisoners last month, but they did
not elaborate.
   The African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress
have differed bitterly over political philosophy. The African
National Congress includes white supporters while the Pan Africanist
Congress advocates black self-reliance in the struggle to end
apartheid.
   Kuene said Mandela does not view himself as a one-man force that
will bring negotiations about.
   ``He said no one single person can tackle the issue of
negotiation. It's a matter for all the organization, not for
individuals,'' said Kunene.
   Moseneke said Mandela ``is in excellent condition physically and
has an amazingly retentive memory.''

   He stood nearly 7 feet tall and

bin was incapable of inflicting anything more harmful than a paper
cut.
   Several people mistook the life-size cardboard cutout of late
actor and pro football player John Matuszak holding a large pistol
for a real-life bad guy Monday. One person even flattened himself

<HEAD>Kemp Gives Unprecedented Approval to House Homeless in Public Units</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jack Kemp, the nation's housing chief, has given
the city unprecedented approval to offer vacant public housing units
to the homeless.
   The secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development
made the announcement Tuesday during a tour of housing
rehabilitation projects on Chicago's West Side.
   He said his agency, which funds public housing, is waiving a
requirement that smaller Chicago Housing Authority apartments be
rented only to low-income families, the elderly or the handicapped.
   A HUD spokesperson did not immediately return a call today
seeking comment on whether whether Kemp planned to exempt low-income
housing units in other cities.
   Chicago Housing Authority Chairman Vincent Lane had requested the
rule change to help fill the agency's 1,200 vacant one-bedroom
apartments. Homeless people will get first claim on 400 to 600 of
the units to be made available starting this winter, he said.
   The units are too small for many of the 38,000 families on the
housing agency's waiting list, he said.
   ``We will continue to take care of families who need help _
that's our ongoing responsibility,'' Kemp said. ``But for the first
time we are going to allow public housing rules to be changed so
that single men and women who are homeless can also have access to
public housing units.''
   ``This is a very positive step,'' said Les Brown, executive
director of the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless. The group
estimates as many as 40,000 people in the city are homeless at one
time or another during the year.

<HEAD>Detained Israeli Tanker Released</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have ordered the release of an
Israeli-owned tanker detained almost three weeks after it allegedly
spilled oil in Egyptian waters, the ship's owners said today.
   The 103,332-ton Panama-registered Nyuta is expected to head for
Israel on Thursday, said Yehoshua Goldstein, director of Tanker
Services Ltd., which is owned partly by the Israeli government.
   Joseph Zvi, the tanker's skipper, will be in command, as Egyptian
authorities allowed him to leave despite a pending court case,
Goldstein said.
   The release order followed Egypt's acceptance of a $1.5 million
letter of guarantee obtained by the owners from its insurers in
London. In addition, the ship owners promised to pay any fine the
court imposed on Zvi, Goldstein said.
   The ship, with a crew of 26 Israelis and two Yugoslavs, was
detained on Oct. 21 in the southern Gulf of Suez west of the Sinai
peninsula. Authorities acted after receiving a report that the Nyuta
was responsible for an oil slick fouling about 60 square yards of
the gulf.
   The Nyuta had been taking Egyptian crude oil from a gulf terminal
to Israel's southern port of Eilat, as it has done for four years.
Israel imports 2 million tons of Egyptian oil annually under a
contract made in conjunction with the 1979 peace treaty between the
two countries.

<TEXT>
   Black Democrats, scoring precedent-shattering
victories in mayoral elections around the nation, are taking control
of city hall for the first time in New York, Seattle and other
cities while regaining it in Cleveland.
   Virginia's Douglas Wilder challenged a century-old racial barrier
and claimed a thin margin of victory in his race for governor, while
blacks extended and solidified their control of some of the nation's
biggest cities in Tuesday's odd-year elections.
   ``It's an excellent testament to the people of Virginia, to the
people of this nation, as to how far we've come in a very short span
of time,'' Wilder said on NBC's ``Today'' show, declaring himself
the winner and the nation's first elected black governor.
   The Republican whip in the House, Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia,
acknowledged the gains for black Democrats.
   ``I think a clear signal was sent that Americans will vote for
the best qualified candidates,'' Gingrich said on the ``CBS This
Morning'' show. ``While I really wish our guys had won, there is
something fundamentally good for this country.''
   Jesse Jackson, the two-time black presidential contender, said,
``These gains represent expansion for the group that was locked
out.''
   In the main mayoral event, David Dinkins won election in New York
over Republican Rudolph Giuliani _ the first time a black has been
elected mayor of the nation's largest city.
   Other Democrats who won election as mayor, and who will become
the first blacks to head their cities, were John Daniels in New
Haven, Conn., Chester Jenkins in Durham, N.C., and Norm Rice in
Seattle.
   Michael White was elected in Cleveland, succeeding white
Republican George Voinovich.
   Detroit Mayor Coleman Young, who is black, won a fifth four-year
term by defeating black challenger Tom Barrow.
   Dinkins' election in New York and Wilder's claim to a narrow
victory in the Virginia governor's race raised the likelihood a new
array of elected black leaders would gain national prominence.
   Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., the House majority whip and the
nation's highest black elected figure, praised Dinkins' election and
said New York voters ``have rejected the politics of fear.'' Dinkins
withstood late campaign attacks on his character and integrity.
   Gray said Wilder's apparent success ``gives us all hope _ hope
that America is maturing and that people are able to make decisions
without regard to race, but on the issues.''
   The off-year election put Democratic blacks in control of most of
the nation's big city mayors' offices. Going into Tuesday's
balloting, New York, Chicago and Houston were the nation's biggest
cities with a white mayor.
   Houston voters returned Kathy Whitmire to office Tuesday, and
Miami voters did the same for Xavier Suarez.
   White was elected Cleveland's new mayor by defeating longtime
city council president George Forbes in a bitter contest between two
black candidates who once were allies. His victory gives the city
its first black mayor since Carl Stokes left office nearly two
decades ago, the first of the big-city black mayors.
   The candidacies of Wilder, Virginia's Democratic lieutenant
governor, and Dinkins, the Manhattan borough president, were
noteworthy for their similar methods. Both ran as mainstream,
middle-of-the-road candidates who stressed their experience in
elected office.
   They projected an image that was far from the fiery-preacher and
populist outsider appeal of Jackson. In fact, Wilder's campaign
deliberately kept Jackson at arms' length for fear of alienating
white voters.
   Both Dinkins and Wilder appealed for broad support from white
voters while counting on near-total support from black voters.
   ``Both of these candidates, who had a fairly similar strategy in
some ways, will be viewed as role models,'' said Linda Williams, a
fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, specializing in
race and politics. ``For the future direction of black politics,
there will be a lot of inspiration about what can be done.''
   Wilder was seeking to become the first black governor of a state
since Reconstruction and the first black elected governor ever.
   Daniels, elected in New Haven, is a veteran Connecticut state
senator who easily defeated Republican Alderwoman Robie Pooley.
   In Durham, Jenkins' victory came in a closely contested
non-partisan race with conservative candidate Nelson Strawbridge.
   The election ``symbolizes heightened security and maturity for
white males in America,'' Jackson said. ``In the '60s we integrated
the lunch counters and the libraries. Now we are integrating the
psyche and the mind of white America.''

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto opened a
seven-nation South Asia meeting today with a new call to negotiate a
regional treaty limiting nuclear weapons.
   ``We are prepared for negotiations to prevent proliferation of
nuclear weapons in our region on a non-discriminatory basis,'' Ms.
Bhutto told foreign ministers from India and six other nations of
the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.
   Pakistan is widely reported to have developed nuclear weapons
capability despite denials by Ms. Bhutto's government. India
exploded what it termed a ``peaceful nuclear device'' in 1974.
   Ms. Bhutto's latest proposal came at the start of a two-day
meeting which is meant to set the stage for a December summit of the
association's leaders, probably in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Other members
are Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives.
   The association's nations represent a combined population of more
than 1 billion people who earn on average about $150 a year.
   The foreign ministers were originally to meet in July but it was
canceled after a Sri Lankan boycott to protest India's refusal to
withdraw more than 50,000 of its soldiers from the island nation.
The two countries have since reached an agreement.
   Pakistan, which has fought three unsuccessful wars with
neighboring India, previously has offered to enter into several
bilateral non-nuclear agreements.
   Predominantly Hindu India and Moslem Pakistan have tried to thaw
traditionally cold relations since Ms. Bhutto's left-leaning
government came to power following elections a year ago.
   But Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India has refused to discuss
non-proliferation with Pakistan because he claims the military and
not Ms. Bhutto's civilian government is in charge of the program.
   Analysts say India has rejected talks mainly because it wants to
keep its nuclear weapons option open in response to China, its rival
northern neighbor, which has been a nuclear power since 1964.
   ``The problems of underdevelopment must not be compounded by
misgivings and misperceptions,'' Ms. Bhutto told the foreign
ministers. ``The legacy of mistrust, suspicion and genuine security
concerns need to be overcome.''
   Ms. Bhutto, who is expecting her second child within a month,
said one third of child deaths worldwide occur in Pakistan, India
and Bangladesh.
   The association's charter signed four years ago in Bangladesh
prohibits overtly political initiatives. It was organized to
concentrate on trade, cultural, health and environmental matters.
The last summit was held in December 1988 in Islamabad.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez is seeking a nearly 5
percent cut in spending by all state agencies to help make up a
projected revenue shortfall of nearly $280 million.
   Martinez proposed the cuts Tuesday in an effort to balance
Florida's $23 billion budget in light of lower-than-expected tax
collections.
   The governor recommended all state agencies be ordered to reduce
spending 4.9 percent for the seven months left in the fiscal year.
   He and the Cabinet must vote on the proposal and are expected to
do so Thursday. The cuts do not require legislative approval.
   In addition, Martinez ordered agencies under his direct authority
to fill only one of every two vacancies after Dec. 1 and curtail
travel and the purchase of supplies.
   State economists attributed the shortfall to consumers saving
more and spending less. Patricia Woodworth, the governor's budget
director, said also that economists overestimated revenue from sales
and corporate income taxes.

   David Dinkins, a courtly figure in a clamorous
campaign, defeated an aggressive Republican prosecutor to become the
city's first black mayor in what he hailed as a triumph over
``division and suspicion.''
   ``We held to the high road and we proved that it is the right
road to victory,'' Dinkins told supporters early today. ``And
whatever the final margin, I like to think that we won a great
victory against the division and suspicion.''
   Dinkins, a 62-year-old Democrat, attracted nearly all of the
black vote, roughly a third of the white vote and Jewish vote, and
about 70 percent of the Hispanic vote.
   ``Ours is a new coalition of conscience and purpose,'' he said.
``One that has room for everyone and excludes no one. We will search
city and nation to find the best minds and the best ideas.''
   With all but six of the city's 5,237 precincts reporting, the
unofficial count showed Dinkins with 898,534 votes, or 50 percent,
while Rudolph Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor who ran as a
reformer, had 856,448 votes, or 48 percent. Conservative and Right
to Life candidates each had 1 percent.
   Pollsters said late-deciding voters helped close the margin of
victory compared with the double-digit lead Dinkins maintained in
opinion polls through last week.
   Dinkins, a background figure for more than 20 years in the state
assembly, and as city clerk and Manhattan borough president, will
succeed brash Edward I. Koch, whose attempt to become the city's
first four-term mayor was derailed in the September primary.
   ``We passed another milestone on freedom's road _ a victory not
for African Americans alone but for all New Yorkers and for all
Americans,'' Dinkins said.
   New York voters also decided to change the city government,
approving a new charter by 55-45 percent.
   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled this year that the city's Board of
Estimate, which decided most land-use and budget issues, was
unconstitutional because it gave equal power to five boroughs with
widely varying populations.
   A commission wrote up the new charter, which got rid of the Board
of Estimate, increased the size of the City Council from 35 to 51
and gave what some feel is more power to the mayor.
   To reach City Hall, Dinkins withstood Giuliani's relentless
attack on his competence and integrity, and responded with a call
for unity and tolerance.
   ``We held to the high road and we proved that it is the right
road to victory,'' Dinkins said. ``And whatever the final margin, I
like to think that we won a great victory against the division and
suspicion.''
   Giuliani, hoping to become the first Republican mayor since John
Lindsay in 1965, had spent most of the campaign slamming Dinkins as
a ``clubhouse politician'' whose sloppy financial dealings bode ill
for a city that has weathered several corruption scandals. The
strong showing in this Democratic stronghold will make the
45-year-old Giuliani a force in state Republican politics.
   In his concession speech, Giuliani screamed at his supporters to
stop booing Dinkins' name, urged them to unite behind the
mayor-elect _ and appeared to keep the door open for another shot at
Gracie Mansion.
   ``David Dinkins will have a difficult task ahead of him,''
Giuliani said. ``Our city is troubled in deep and serious ways.
Every prayer you have ever said for me, every assistance you have
ever given me, all the patience and support you have shown to me, I
ask you now to give to our new mayor.''
   But he later told the crowd: ``You did a miracle _ 48 percent of
the vote, when Republicans are outnumbered 5-to-1 in this city.
   ``And you did it because we tapped a chord, we reached for a
feeling that exists in this city for reform, for a new kind of
politics. We almost made it, but we're not stopping, are we?''
   In Harlem, where Dinkins grew up, joy was evident.
   ``I feel proud,'' said Barbara Johnson, who celebrated in
Dinkins' uptown headquarters on 125th Street. ``It's a reinforcement
of black pride. Twelve years of Mayor Koch was just enough. I expect
less homeless and more racial togetherness. Those are the two main
things.''
   Blacks make up a quarter of the city's population. But Dinkins,
whose campaign themes of unity and tolerance resonated at a time
when violent racial incidents shook the city, pointed to his
broad-based support and urged that it continue.
   ``What can unite us is far stronger than the forces that can keep
us apart,'' he said. ``I intend to be the mayor of all the people,
not just for those who voted for me.''

   State Sen. Mike White won a mayoral race marked
by heated rhetoric and name-calling, defeating City Council
President George Forbes in a nonpartisan contest between two black
Democrats.
   ``Tonight is a time to cheer. Tonight is a time for victory,''
White, 38, told his supporters Tuesday night. ``But the healing
begins in the morning. I pledge to you, under my leadership, we
shall be one city.''
   Forbes, who had called his opponent a slumlord, making polticial
hay of nearly 200 city housing code violations lodged against seven
rental properties owned by White, said in his concession speech he
thought White's race was well-run.
   ``If I can be of assistance to him, all he has to do is call
me,'' said Forbes, 59. His term expires at the end of this year, and
he said he plans to leave government and concentrate on his law
practice.
   With all precincts reporting, White had 85,829 votes, or 56
percent, to 68,167 votes, or 44 percent, for Forbes. He succeeds
Mayor George Voinovich, who is stepping aside to run for the
Republican nomination for governor.
   Early today White already was hinting at sweeping changes in City
Hall, saying he was not inclined to keep Voinovich's police chief
and safety director.
   In Toledo, incumbent Mayor Donna Owens, a Republican, was
defeated by Democratic challenger John McHgh, who had 79 percent of
the vote to Ms. Owens' 21 percent.
   ``I'm really elated,'' McHugh said. ``I was just hoping to win by
a few votes. We did as well as we could. We had a great game plan,
and the people of this community have decided that they wanted new
leadership.''
   In a tearful concession speech, Ms. Owens _ the only incumbent
mayoral candidate not returned _ thanked supporters for her time in
office.
   ``I can't say that this is easy, because it's not. It hurts. But
the last six years as mayor have been the best years of my life.
Thank you,'' she said, barely finishing her sentence.
   Dayton Mayor Richard Clay Dixon, a Democrat, claimed victory over
GOP challenger Abner Orick by a 59-to-41 percent margin. Youngstown
Mayor Patrick Ungaro won re-election, defeating Fred DeLuca 83
percent to 17 percent.
   And in Cincinnati, incumbent Mayor Charles Luken won another
term, leading 20 candidates for nine seats on City Council with. The
top vote-getter in the council race becomes mayor.
   In a sidelight to that race, Cincinnati Bengals linebacker Reggie
Williams, a member of the city's Charter Committee party, took
fourth place in the council balloting, winning a seat on the panel.

<HEAD>Justice Official Says President Can Violate International Law</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 11 grafs new to UPDATE with hearing, picks up at pvs 4th

<TEXT>
   A Justice Department official told Congress
today that the president has the power to violate international law
by ordering the seizure of terrorists or drug traffickers without
the consent of other nations.
   Assistant Attorney General William P. Barr, who wrote a legal
opinion giving the FBI authority to make such arrests, said such
violations of international law would be justified to thwart
terrorist attacks or capture drug dealers harbored by another
country.
   Abraham Sofaer, the State Department's chief legal adviser,
endorsed Barr's legal reasoning but warned of the dangers of making
such arrests because ``all nations need to take into account the
reactions of other nations to conduct which departs from accepted
norms.''
   Barr and Sofaer told the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil
and constitutional rights that seizing terrorists or drug
traffickers in violation of international law but in self-defense
would be legally justifiable.
   ``In response to an actual or threatened terrorist attack, we
would have good grounds under general principles of international
law to justify extraterritorial law enforcement actions over a
foreign sovereign's objections,'' Barr said.
   ``In appropriate circumstances we may have a sound basis under
international law to take action against large-scale drug
traffickers being given safe haven by a government acting in
complicity with their criminal enterprise,'' he added.
   Barr and Sofaer stressed that the legal opinion did not mean a
change in government policy that requires cooperation with other
nations before an arrest on foreign soil is made. Overseas arrests
without a foreign government's consent would only be undertaken with
approval of the president.
   ``It may well be that the president will choose to direct
extraterritorial arrests only when he believes that he is justified
in doing so as a matter of self-defense under international law,''
Barr said. But ``it is ultimately the president's judgment as to the
need for a particular operation that is controlling for purposes of
domestic law.''
   Sofaer outlined the hazards of pursuing such a policy, noting
danger to U.S. agents overseas and the inevitable ``adverse impact
on our bilateral relations with the country in which we act.''
   ``We need to consider the fact that our legal position may be
seized upon by other nations to engage in irresponsible conduct
against our interests,'' the State Department official said.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif, the subcommittee's chairman noted that
the Iranian parliament ``has cited the Justice Department opinion to
say that they have the same right to come into the United States to
arrest their fugitives without our knowledge and kidnap them.''
   The June 21 opinion, which the Justice Department has refused to
make public, states U.S. law authorizes the FBI to snatch fugitives
in foreign countries that refuse to cooperate in extradition
proceedings.
   It reverses a 1980 department ruling that the FBI lacked U.S.
legal authority to ignore international law.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel on Tuesday defended the
agency's refusal to make public the opinion or give it to the
subcommittee, saying it was confidential legal advice given to the
FBI.
   Runkel said not even members of Congress are entitled to see the
legal advice the Justice Department gives other executive branch
agencies. He said, ``Why would we treat the committee any
differently than the news media or the general public?''
   On Tuesday, Edwards expressed dismay over Runkel's statement,
saying: ``Maybe the department needs more experience, it needs an
education about how the government is supposed to work in a free
society.''
   Edwards said he hoped the hearing ``will guide them along that
path.''
   Justice Department officials, responding to news accounts of the
opinion, have said it does not represent policy but merely an
evaluation of the FBI's legal authority.
   FBI Director William S. Sessions told reporters Tuesday the
opinion was sought because the bureau's jurisdiction has been
expanded to investigate terrorist acts overseas against Americans.
   ``We're seeking to be as innovative and as fully responsible to
congressional intent as we can possibly be,'' Sessions said.
   But Sessions said the FBI wouldn't exercise its legal authority
to grab fugitives without permission from the highest levels of the
administration.
   ``We are not now contemplating any particular undertaking that
would involve that particular capability.''
   But Sessions said he envisioned circumstances when it could be
used. ``I think that the capability obviously and the approval of
that kind of operation could be reality.''

   A state legislator's wife was killed with an
arrow at their rural home today and the couple's son was arrested,
authorities said.
   Sheriff Stephen Fitzgerald said 19-year-old Chad E. Goetsch was
arrested at his parents' home and jailed in the slaying of Carolyn
Goetsch, the 51-year-old wife Rep. Robert G. Goetsch. The teen-ager
was awaiting formal charges.
   The legislator, a Republican first elected in 1982, was treated
at Beaver Dam Community Hospital for cuts to the hand and face,
Fitzgerald said. It was not known how he suffered those injuries,
the sheriff said.
   Fitzgerald said Mrs. Goetsch was found in the upstairs hall with
an arrow in her upper body. Authorities found a bow and arrow at the
home, he said.
   A spokeswoman at Marquette University in Milwaukee said the
younger Goetsch was a freshman there.

   A couple hired to clean carpets were found
dead at the customer's home of carbon monoxide poisoning from their
gasoline-powered generator.
   The bodies of James and Selma McKnight were discovered Tuesday by
Patricia Newman, who had hired them. The McKnights were last heard
from on Sunday.
   Investigators said the generator used to power the carpet cleaner
had filled the house with odorless, colorless carbon monoxide.
   ``It would be just like closing your garage door and cranking
your car up,'' said Jeff Britton of Generator Systems Inc., a
supplier of generators.
   ``When (authorities) got there, the fumes were still very strong,
to the point they became lightheaded themselves,'' sheriff's Capt.
Bill Brown.
   McKnight, 27, worked of a carpet-cleaning firm for two years. His
wife, who was helping him, was employed by the county Department of
Social Services.

   A terrier that strayed onto an elevated railway
halted rush-hour commuter traffic for 1{ hours, eluding dogged
pursuers who chased it up and down the tracks above the streets of
Miami.
   ``We didn't want to be heartless and just run over the dog,''
said transit spokesman Andrew Miller.
   The dog apparently entered the Metrorail system by ducking under
a street-level turnstile Tuesday. The transit agency cut power to 1{
miles of track in case the fare-beater or its pursuers came into
contact with an electrified rail.
   When the stray was finally cornered and collared, the posse
``looked as tired as the dog,'' said Dade County animal control
specialist Mary Grant.
   The terrier, a female, was taken to the pound to be either
claimed by its owner or put up for adoption.

   Jacqueline C. McGinn discovered one of the
mysteries of mass production when a couple mistakenly took her car
to run errands because their key fit the ignition.
   The cars, although different makes, were the same color inside
and out and had been parked next to each other, Police Chief Lenard
McDougall said of the Monday mixup.
   ``What's surprising is that the Oldsmobile key fit the Chevrolet
ignition. They're not supposed to do that,'' McDougall said.
   McGinn had left her brown 1984 Chevrolet Caprice to go shopping.
Twenty minutes later, she returned to find her car missing. She
reported it stolen. Later, she spotted her car back where she had
left it, but with a couple inside.
   George A. Gauthier of Aumsville, Ore., told police he and his
wife had borrowed a friend's 1983 Olds and parked behind McGinn's
car. Later, they mistakenly took McGinn's Chevy when their key fit
the ignition and started it up.
   No charges were filed.

<DATELINE>BECKLEY, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An end to tolls at the exits of the West
Virginia Turnpike has been delayed a week so Gov. Gaston Caperton
can close the toll booths with flair.
   The Legislature voted to eliminate 12 toll booths, where
motorists are charged 25 cents to 75 cents as they get off the
turnpike, saying the booths don't generate enough revenue to make
them worthwhile.
   Caperton had scheduled a ceremony for today in Charleston to mark
the occasion, but it was moved to Tuesday near Beckley.
   ``It was rescheduled because the turnpike authority felt Beckley
would be the more appropriate place to conduct the ceremony because
it is in the central part of the turnpike and serves more people,''
Caperton spokesman Steve Cohen said.
   Cohen said the delay will allow time to gather supporting players
and props for the ceremony, including turnpike workers, trucks and
heavy construction equipment.
   The 88-mile turnpike was built in the 1950s. It runs between
Charleston and Princeton and is a main north-south route between the
northern Midwest and the Southeast.
   Legislators said the exit tolls, referred to as ``nuisance''
tolls, bring in only $2.2 million a year and discourage motorists
from stopping in West Virginia.
   Four toll booths will remain.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout
the country:
   Nov. 7
   Central Maine Morning Sentinel, Waterville, Maine, on Soviet-bloc
reforms:
   The changes wrought on the Soviet Union under ... perestroika
have come so frequently over the past couple of years that they've
lost their shock value in the United States.
   Disarmament proposals from the Soviets are routine. The public
return of Raoul Wallenburg's effects, with an apology from the KGB,
was unusual but not startling. But last week's mea culpa from the
Kremlin _ on Afghanistan and the Krasnoyarsk radar base _ was
astounding.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told the Soviet
legislature that the war in Afghanistan was illegal and undertaken
behind the backs of the Soviet people.
   Shevardnadze said the Siberian radar violated the Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty, and would be dismantled. But that wasn't all.
   On the same day, Hungary marked the anniversary of its 1956
uprising by declaring itself a republic.
   Still on the same day, 300,000 East Germans marched through East
Berlin, calling for democracy.
   Perestroika has spread and is spreading. But while the news was
breaking in Moscow and East Berlin, the Bush administration
officials were trying to prove that they were ready with the new
opportunities for change.
   The ``clearest opportunity to reduce the risk of war since the
dawn of the nuclear age,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d
said, later adding, ``It would be folly indeed to miss this
opportunity.''
   Folly indeed. The opportunity is so great, that to squander it
would be one of the most grievous mistakes of the nuclear age. And
it could happen, sooner than one would think. Hard-line communism is
lurking in the shadows.

   The Arizona Republic, Phoenix, on Soviet-bloc reforms:
   As London's Economistput it, you don't go bang by stages. There
is something beguiling in the notion of a ``controlled explosion,''
the idea that after 40 years of communist rule Eastern Europe's
Marxist leaders could manage a transition to democracy without
everything going smash.
   In the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev has been lured by the same
siren song, thinking he could reform the stagnant Russian economy
incrementally without repudiating the core doctrines of communism.
In both cases it appears that the old Soviet bloc may be headed for
a major crash.
   Gorbachev has adopted a hands-off policy toward European reform
apparently on the assumption that change could be controlled in two
ways: (1) Communist parties would retain a significant share of
power, and (2) there would be no dismantling of the Warsaw Pact.
   Again, as the Economist notes, sensible Hungarians wish to avoid
questioning Hungary's membership in the Warsaw Pact, and Western
governments are not eager for them to tempt Moscow. But the effect
of democratization in Hungary has been that politicians there now
worry more about the voters than the Russians, and lots of
Hungarians want Hungary to become neutral like Austria.
   All this change in the most sensitive areas of the Soviet empire
comes as ... Gorbachev's economy approaches chaos and parts of the
country the striking coal miners in Vorkuta, for instance are close
to open rebellion. ...
   Gorbachev has tried to reform the economy without jettisoning
Marxism-Leninism outright. That may be impossible. It may take an
honest-to-goodness revolution to pull the Soviet Union out of its
doldrums.

   Tulsa (Okla.) World on East Germany:
   A million East Germans filled the streets of Berlin Saturday
(Nov. 4) in a pro-democracy rally that even a year ago would have
been unthinkable.
   The communist government's answer _ or the Soviet Union's answer
_ would have been tanks and troops. The world behind the Iron
Curtain is turning upside down.
   The communist government's response was the announcement of a
prospective new law allowing citizens 30 days of unrestricted travel
in the West.
   It is a small gesture, but a significant victory nevertheless for
the German citizens who gathered in Berlin to shout ``Freedom!
Freedom!'' ...
   But the voice of freedom has been raised throughout Eastern
Europe. It can be restrained and muted, but no one seriously expects
it to be totally silenced again.
   The people have had a taste of it, and it is addictive.

   The Journal, New Ulm, Minn., on Nicaragua:
   Nicaraguan dictator Daniel Ortega (last) week brushed aside a
19-month cease-fire between the Sandinista forces in Nicaragua and
the contra rebels.
   At a summit meeting of American governments ..., Ortega announced
his government would end the cease-fire due to what he called
increasing rebel attacks, saying the Bush administration has
supported ``terrorism in Nicaragua.''
   Baloney. Congress long ago put an end to military aid to the
contras, over the objections of those who feel the only thing
forcing the Sandinistas to make any concessions to democracy and
peace talks was the military threat imposed by Congress.
   If Ortega was truly dedicated to peace and concerned about
increased contra action, the summit ... would have been a great
place to complain about it, but not to abandon the cease-fire.
   We agree with the Bush administration that resuming military
assistance to the contras is too tessentially American
businesses _ Columbia Pictures and Rockefeller Center _ haven't
helped matters. Fears grow daily that a weakened United States is
ceding its independence to more robust foreign economics.
   Those fears, happily, are unwarranted, based on an incomplete
picture of the world economy and America's uniquely strong position
in it.
   It should be understood that foreign investment in the United
States is much smaller than scare stories would lead us to believe.
Foreign groups employ less than 4 percent of the American work force
and own less than 5 percent of U.S. assets.
   The global economy is shaped by forces undreamed of 50 years ago.
Billions of dollars can be moved across borders by computer in
seconds. The United States has proved itself a source of both
stability and innovation amid the lightning changes. That's cause
for pride, not alarm.

   The Milwaukee Journal on the demise of the Los Angeles Herald
Examiner:
   No doubt we're more sensitive than others to such things, but the
death of a newspaper is a sad event. One occurred last week; the Los
Angeles Herald Examiner folded. It was once the nation's largest
afternoon paper but later switched to morning publication.
   At the age of 86, the Herald succumbed to labor problems, heavy
competition from the giant Los Angeles Times, and other stresses.
   Of course, the Herald was not as good a paper as the Times.
Together with suburban papers, however, the Herald did provide
journalistic diversity to the millions who live in the Los Angeles
area, and it was a challenge to the Times. Even as the end drew
near, the Herald was taking the lead in reporting possible financial
irregularities by Mayor Tom Bradley.
   Now, the Times is the area's only metropolitan daily paper. Life
will be a little easier, and perhaps less interesting, for the
paper. Newspapers that must compete tend to fight harder, to ask
more questions and dig deeper. Many times over the last 86 years,
the Herald did that kind of a job for its readers.

   The Kansas City (Mo.) Times on Vladimir Horowitz:
   Vladimir Horowitz's agelessness was compatible with his world
citizenship: He was not a musician who fit into epoch or niche. ...
   Perhaps Horowitz's ultimate artistry was that he also spoke to
mere music lovers.
   It took no vocabulary in the finer points of piano technique to
delight in the great artist's playing.
   Neither was there a need for familiarity with the vast
differences between Rachmaninoff and Bach to appreciate Horowitz's
interpretation of both.

   Daytona Beach (Fla.) News-Journal on the minimum wage:
   The news that the Bush administration finally is dropping its
opposition to an increase in the minimum wage is welcome. But for
the working poor, the measure will go only a short way toward making
up for the ground lost over the past eight years. ...
   When the working poor become too poor, they become a burden on
taxpayers. An adequate minimum wage not only protects those in
low-paying occupations, but society in general.
   The increase before Congress, however small, is a welcome step
toward restoring the protections of the minimum wage.

   The Clarion-Ledger, Jackson, Miss., on waste disposal:
   WANTED: Good men with shovels _ and no sense of smell.
   That's an obvious requirement for disposing of box cars of
excrement as recently rolled into Moss Point (Miss.) from Baltimore.
But what do you do with 63 box cars _ 12,000 tons! _ of it? That's
quite a lot of, uh, droppings.
   Much like the ill-faded garbage barge last year that roamed the
seas in search of disposal, the ``Poo-poo choo-choo,'' as it's being
called, is finding itself a pariah. It has been shuffled from
Baltimore, to Louisiana, now to Mississippi, with nervous officials
creating bureaucratic paperwork barriers _ basically because of the
stink.
   It is an odious subject, but the trainload is merely a symbol of
a failure in this country to deal with the issue of waste disposal.
   Baltimore residents may be embarrassed by this episode, but
(they) need not feel ashamed. At least they got some poor sucker to
agree to accept their offal in the first place.

   Dallas Times Herald on a pickup truck parking ban:
   In three weeks, a judge in Illinois will decide whether there are
federal issues in a local ordinance banning pickup trucks from
parking anywhere in public view in the community of Flossmoor _ an
affluent small town south of Chicago.
   We would like to ask the judge this: Does he think there were any
federal issues in the Civil War? Would he like to see a repeat? Are
these people in Flossmoor, Ill., totally serious? Would they be
willing to give us a large break?
   The pickup truck! Why, the pickup truck is a thing of beauty. On
the front end, it's sleek and chromey, just like the cars people
drive in town. But on the back end, it's stout and practical and can
carry several bales of hay when needed. It's what America should be
_ honest, rough, ready, but with a clean face whenever possible.
   And here these people are banning it. Maligning the pickup truck!
It's almost beyond belief. The explanation Flossmoor citizens give
for their ban on the public parking of pickups within their
corporate limits is that pickups are ``unattractive.''
   Well, if that's how it's going to be, then we can imagine any
number of bans that might be easy to sell to other communities. How
about a ban on ... gazebos? There are lots of Americans who might
find it painful to suddenly turn a corner or glance up a hill and
have their vision accosted by one of these big fat frou-frou
monstrosities. What about their sensitivities? ...
   A ban on the public parking of pickup trucks is a direct assault
on the American way of life, the Constitution, the family unit,
agriculture, progress, history, liberty, social responsibility and
pets.
   Federal issue, indeed! Strike it down, we say. Strike it down now.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Free Bakker on Bail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court today refused to
free TV evangelist Jim Bakker on bail while he appeals his 45-year
prison sentence.
   A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld a judge's finding that Bakker should remain jailed because he
might flee.
   The court said it found no reason to reject prosecution evidence
that many of Bakker's followers are prepared to ``do anything for
him.''
   The court also said Bakker had shown little grounds for a
successful appeal.
   The 47-year-old preacher was convicted Oct. 5 in Charlotte, N.C.,
on 24 charges of fraud and conspiracy for cheating followers of his
PTL ministry of $3.7 million by selling more lifetime vacations than
he could honor.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter refused bail when he sentenced
Bakker on Oct. 24 to 45 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.
   He is being held at a federal prison-hospital in Rochester, Minn.
   Defense attorney Harold Bender in Charlotte did not immediately
return a telephone call today.
   Bakker's lawyers had argued he should be released because of
substantial flaws in the trial.
   They have said they will argue that Bakker was denied a fair
trial because of heavy publicity, the handling of certain evidence
and erroneous jury instructions.

   Jury selection began today for the trial
of a man charged with 27 counts of murder in the nation's deadliest
drunken driving accident, the 1988 crash of a wrong-way pickup truck
and a church bus.
   Larry Mahoney, 36, who authorities say drank as much as a case of
beer the day of the crash, is charged with 83 counts in all,
including drunken driving, assault and wanton endangerment over
injuries to those who escaped the burning bus.
   Some 100 prospective jurors arrived today. Attorneys have said
selecting a jury could take two to three weeks, and the trial itself
could last two months.
   Tight security was imposed at the tiny courthouse, including a
metal detector at the courtroom entrance.
   ``We want to do it once, and we want to do it right,'' said
Circuit Judge Charles Satterwhite.
   Assistant Attorney General Paul Richwalsky said he expected most
of the jury pool to have heard of the case, which prompted a
national debate over school bus safety and renewed attention on
drunken driving.
   Mahoney, of Worthville, is accused of driving his truck the wrong
way on Interstate 71 and crashing into a former school bus from the
Radcliff First Assembly of God church. The bus was returning from an
outing to an amusement park.
   Twenty-four members of a youth group and three adults died, all
from smoke inhalation.
   ``My defense will revolve around whether Larry Mahoney is a
murderer or whether Larry Mahoney was involved in a traffic
manslaughter,'' said defense attorney William Summers.
   The defense attorney said he planned to ask potential jurors if
they or someone in their families had been convicted of drunken
driving ``to understand that these people are everywhere.''
   ``There's thousands and thousands of people each year in this
commonwealth convicted of DWI,'' Summers said.
   The defendant's blood-alcohol level was 0.26 percent 90 minutes
after the accident, and a National Transportation Safety Board
investigator testified during board hearings that at the time of the
accident it likely would have been 0.29 percent.
   That is nearly three times the state's 0.10 percent threshhold
for drunken driving and two-thirds of a lethal dose of alcohol, said
NTSB investigator John Moulden, who estimated Mahoney would have
consumed a case _ 24 cans _ of beer to reach that level.
   Mahoney pleaded guilty to driving under the influence in a case
several years ago.
   After the crash, Mahoney spent several weeks in a hospital and
was then examined at the Kentucky Correctional Psychiatric Center.
He was jailed until October 1988, when his family put together
enough money and property to post his $540,000 bond.
   Mahoney returned to work at his job at M&amp;T Chemicals in
Carrollton and lives with his parents. He neither drives nor drinks
anymore, Summers said.
   The NTSB found Mahoney's drunkenness was the probable cause of
the accident, but went on to recommend the oldest 20 percent of the
nation's school bus fleet be taken out of service as unsafe.
   The board also recommended stricter standards for fuel tank
protection, emergency exits and the flammability of seat covers on
school buses.

   The Sandinista government said today it
will propose a new cease-fire plan that calls for a dismantling of
the U.S.-backed rebel force.
   President Daniel Ortega outlined a 15-point plan that he will
propose during a meeting with the Contras on Thursday at the United
Nations in New York.
   ``If the Contras don't accept this plan, they will be voting for
war,'' said Ortega, who last week ended a 19-month truce with the
rebels.
   The Sandinista proposal urges the United States to divert toward
the Contras' demobilization what remains of a $49 million package in
non-lethal rebel aid the Congress authorized in March.
   The plan also includes creation of routes within Nicaragua for
the rebels to use to return to Honduras, where the commission would
provide certificates for their repatriation or relocation in third
countries, Ortega said.
   He spoke at a news conference after the Nicaraguan delegation,
headed by Assistant Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco, left for
the talks in New York.
   As a concession to U.S. interests, Ortega offered to suspend
temporarily Nicaragua's weapons imports until next April 25, but
only after the demobilization accord is signed. This seemed an empty
gesture since the Soviet Union told the United States earlier this
year it had suspended weapons shipments to Nicaragua.
   A general amnesty would be offered once at least 50 percent of
the Contras have demobilized and the rebels free kidnapped people
they hold, he said.
   Ortega asked for the U.N. meeting to discuss demobilization of
the Contras. He proposed it when he announced an end to a 19-month
cease-fire last week.
   The Contra rebels are to disband and leave their Honduran camps
voluntarily by the first few days of December under an agreement
signed by Honduras, Nicaragua and three other Central American
governments Aug. 7.
   About 12,000 rebels were in neighboring Honduran camps Aug. 7.
Ortega said he ended the cease-fire because more than 1,100 rebels
had moved back into Nicaragua in recent weeks.
   The rebel delegation went to Washington on Monday to meet with
U.S. officials, rebel sources in Tegucigalpa said.
   The Contras have said they want a resumption of the cease-fire, a
general amnesty and guarantees they can visit Nicaragua to verify
that sufficient reforms have been made to allow their safe return.
   Rebels and the government last met directly in June 1988 in an
effort to turn a temporary truce signed in March into a permanent
peace. The effort failed when the government refused to accept
Contra demands, among them an end to Sandinista control of the army
and police.

   Americans and Soviets have at least one thing
in common _ many don't know much geography and show ``an astonishing
lack of awareness of the world around them,'' a Gallup poll showed
today.
   In the first survey of geographic knowledge conducted in the
Soviet Union, young Soviets scored significantly higher than their
American counterparts, but didn't do well when compared with adults
of all age groups in the 10 nations where the test was given.
   For example, Soviets between ages 18 and 24 correctly identified
an average of 9.3 of 16 locations on a world map, ranking fourth
along with Canadians and Italians. Young American adults came in
last, with an average of 6.9 correct.
   Overall, however, Soviets as a whole identified an average of 7.4
of a possible 16 locations. That put them at the bottom with Mexico.
American adults ranked only slightly higher with 8.6 correct. Swedes
were at the top with an average of 11.6 correct.
   The survey was commissioned by the National Geographic Society to
find how the United States compared with its neighbors and other
industrialized nations. The 16 places on the world map were the
United States, Soviet Union, Central America, Japan, Canada, France,
Persian Gulf, Mexico, Italy, Sweden, United Kingdom, South Africa,
West Germany, Pacific Ocean, Egypt and Vietnam.
   ``We believe the results from the survey point to a startling
superpower comparison,'' said the Gallup Organization, which called
the international geography survey the largest of its kind.
``Americans and Soviets have demonstrated an astonishing lack of
awareness of the world around them.''
   The other overall scores were West Germans, 11.2; Japan, 9.7;
France, 9.3; Canada, 9.2; the United Kingdom, 8.5; Italy, 7.6; and
Mexico, 7.4.
   Thirteen percent of Soviet adults were unable to correctly
identify the Soviet Union on a world map, while 14 percent of the
Americans could not correctly identify the United States.
   About 1,500 Soviet adults were surveyed this spring in Moscow and
Kursk, an industrial city of 425,000 people, 300 miles south of the
capital.
   Nearly 11,000 people in Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Mexico,
Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, and West Germany were
tested in the spring of 1988 and the results were announced last
year.
   Geographic Society President Gilbert Grosvenor said the survey
result ``reinforces the need to strengthen the teaching of geography
in American classrooms.''
   Vladimir Andreyenkov, of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, which
conducted the survey with Gallup, said ``it was a shock'' that the
overall Soviet results fell short of Soviet researchers'
expectations.
   ``I didn't believe Soviet citizens know so little about
geography,'' he said. ``I rechecked the data many times. The results
were unbelievable. They will have very great repercussions in the
Soviet Union.''
   Neil Upmeyer, a Gallup vice president, attributed the poor
overall ranking of the Soviets to low scores among those over 55
years old, who grew up in war times without adequate educational
opportunities.
   Nearly 90 percent of the Soviets surveyed _ compared with 47
percent of the Americans _ said they had taken a course devoted
entirely to geography.
   Those surveyed in the 10 nations were interviewed in their homes
and asked to locate the same 13 countries, Central America, the
Pacific Ocean, and the Persian Gulf on an unmarked world map. The
Soviets also were asked to locate Afghanistan, which borders it to
the south.
   Despite heavy Soviet involvement in Afghanistan during the past
decade, only four people in 10 could find it on the world map.
   Only about a third of the Americans and Soviets located Vietnam.
And only about 25 percent in each country picked out the Persian
Gulf. About 40 percent of the Soviets did not recognize the Pacific
Ocean, confusing it with the Atlantic or Indian Ocean.

   Former Prime Minister Timoci Bavada was buried
in his home village of Viseisei on Wednesday, his coffin borne by
bare-chested Melanesian pallbearers under a hot tropical sun in
front of 50,000 mourners.
   Bavadra, who was ousted two years ago in a military coup, died
last week of cancer at age 55.
   In honor of his chiefly rank, a traditional war club decorated
his grave in the western Fiji village on the Coral Coast where he
lived in exile. A crucifix also was placed on the grave.
   Bavadra ruled for about one month before being overthrown on May
14, 1987, by army Lt. Col. Sitiveni Rabuka. Diplomats and some
representatives of the regime that overthrew Bavadra attended the
funeral, but not Rabuka.
   Schools, shops and offices were closed across the nation of
715,000 people for the funeral, and the proceedings were broadcast
live on state-controlled Radio Fiji.
   Grieving members of the opposition coalition indicated they would
name Bavadra's widow, Adi Kuini Bavadra, to head the party her
husband led.
   Long lines of mourners, many of them wearing black and some
openly sobbing, paid their last respects all night before the
funeral.
   By early Wednesday, cars and buses were parked for several miles
either side of the highway that bisects the settlement. Makeshift
shelters were errected and huge amounts of food were brought in.

   Stone etchings believed to be about 5,000

   The find was made by an archaeological group from the department

   The etchings date back to the 1st and 2nd centuries B.C., the
radio said in a report monitored in Cyprus.
   Carvings are found at random on the stone cliff walls, suggesting
they were made during respites from hunting for food. Pictures of
mountain goats are repeated, the radio said.
   In addition, etchings of the sun carved on stones placed in high
cliffs suggest the carvers worshipped the sun, it said.
   The find is the first of its kind in Iran, the broadcast said.

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party has a monopoly on power in East
Germany, although four small parties are tolerated to give the
system a semblance of a democracy.
   The four ``block parties'' until now have been allied with the
Communists and have closely followed Communist policies in return
for holding a few relatively insignificant posts. In recent days,
three parties have urged the party to implement reforms.
   The Communist Party's leading role in East German society is
guaranteed in the country's constitution.
   The Politburo, the nation's top decision-making body, was
streamlined Wednesday from 21 to 11 members, with four new
reform-minded members elected to the body and seven members
surviving from the old one.
   The party's general secretary, Egon Krenz, is the most powerful
man in East Germany. He is also head of state and chief of the
national defense council _ commander in chief of the armed forces.
   In theory, the highest organ of the Communist Party is the party
Congress, which usually meets every five years. The Congress elects
a Central Committee _ currently at 163 members _ to act for it
between sessions.
   The Central Committee approves the Politburo, which runs the
country between Central Committee meetings. In practice, the
Politburo usually makes all major decisions.
   The party also controls the the 500-member People's Chamber, or
parliament, which acts as a rubber-stamp body that approves party
decisions. The parliament also chooses the Council of Ministers, or
the government.
   The government usually includes some Politburo members who run
key ministries such as defense and security.
   The party has ``cells'' in the army and factories, which
effectively ensure the party's control and supervision of the
society and economy. It also runs a workers' militia, a paramilitary
force.
   The parliament is elected by popular vote but is limited to
single candidates proposed and approved by the party. Opposition
leaders say the elections are rigged to ensure the election of party
candidates.

   Deputies tired of slogging out to the
middle of a swamp to destroy marijuana plants decided to end the
problem by blowing up the field.
   Attacking the problem by getting rid of the dirt instead of what
grows in it, sheriff's investigators Tuesday blew up some 20 dirt
mounds where 2,000 pot plants had been destroyed in three raids over
the past year.
   There was no marijuana planted there when bomb experts rigged
about 20 charges and blew the mounds _ along with trees, weeds, foul
water and almost certainly a considerable number of confused snakes
_ into the afternoon sky.
   Maj. James Foy said as much as $100,000 in marijuana could be
harvested in a single crop from the mounds.
   No one has ever been arrested in the raids, and investigators
said it was only a matter of time before someone again took
advantage of the isolated site.

which begin in December.

   The nation's Roman Catholic bishops voted
overwhelmingly to let laymen and nuns conduct Sunday worship
services in isolated communities that lack priests.
   Communities in such states as Alaska, Texas, Wyoming are expected
to be affected by the proposal, which was approved late Tuesday
225-18 in a tally announced this morning. The measure still must be
approved by the Vatican.
   Bishop Joseph P. Delaney of Fort Worth, chairman of the Committee
on Liturgy, said a survey showed 51 dioceses with severe clergy
shortages already have Sunday celebrations without a priest.
Parishes in Alaska have had priestless celebrations for 12 years,
said Bishop Michael H. Kenny of Juneau.
   Delaney said the measure will provide uniform guidelines for
worship services in areas where a priest is unavailable.
   But Retired Bishop William E. McManus of the Diocese of Fort
Wayne-South Bend in Indiana charged that approval of the rite ``will
bless a monster that could destroy the Sunday Mass tradition.''
   At worship services, laymen will be allowed to distribute
Communion wafers that were consecrated by a priest. Such services
are not Masses because the consecration does not take place during
the celebration. Mass must still be led by a priest.
   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops today put off until
tomorrow another controversial issue: a proposed statement on AIDS
seeking to drop the conference's earlier qualified support for
condom education in public schools.
   The statement urges that youngsters be taught chastity instead.
   The bishops also unanimously approved a statement declaring that
the world's system of producing and distributing food is ``adrift
without a moral compass.'' It calls for the United States to change
tax policies to promote farm ownership and seek to reduce reliance
on commercial fertilizers and pesticides.
   The bishops said the growing concentration of farm land in a few
corporate hands threatens the common good. ``We have to return the
means of production to the greatest number of people possible,''
said Bishop Thomas J. Connolly of Baker, Ore.
   On Tuesday, the bishops approved a policy statement declaring
that no Catholic can responsibly take a ``pro-choice'' stand, and
made a special plea to Catholic public officials to pursue
legislation limiting abortion.
   Archbishop Roger Mahony of Los Angeles said the church was nearly
alone in its stance.
   ``We may be the only major population segment in our country, the
only nationwide institution, so fully committed to protect and
defend the rights of the unborn. We may be in reality the only moral
conscience in our country willing to be proclaimed publicly,'' he
said.
   On the abortion issue, a Catholic abortion-rights activist
accused the prelates of being ``a political bully'' and predicted
their position will come to no avail.
   ``This is a political war they cannot win,'' said Frances
Kissling, executive director of Catholics for a Free Choice in
Washington.
   The bishops' renewed activism on abortion follows a U.S. Supreme
Court ruling in a Missouri case giving states broader authority to
regulate abortion. They said abortion is an issue of ``overriding
concern'' to Catholics, the nation's largest religious denomination.
   ``No Catholic can responsibly take a `pro-choice' stand when the
`choice' in question involves the taking of innocent human life,''
the bishops said.
   The bishops also elected Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk of
Cincinnati, a moderate, to a three-year term as president of the
bishops' conference. The 55-year-old Pilarczyk who had been
conference vice president since 1986.
   Archbishop William Keeler of Baltimore, past chairman of the
bishops' Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs Committee, was
elected vice president.
   Cardinal John O'Connor of New York was elected to succeed
Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago as chairman of the bishops'
Committee for Pro-Life Activities.

   Four high school students apparently

   ``One of the children told me they had been studying the human

Kanawha County Sheriff's Cpl. J.L. Landers.
   A juvenile court referee found probable cause to charge the four
Cabin Creek boys, ages 16 and 17. Their names were not released.
   Landers said the boys apparently wanted to dig down to the
casket, open it and see what was there. However, the casket had
deteriorated and they found the body of the woman. The remains were
found on the ground near the grave, he said.
   An arraignment will be scheduled in two to three weeks, Landers
said.

   East German leader Egon Krenz ousted the ruling
Politburo today and replaced its aging members with reformers in a
dramatic bid to gain control of a country convulsed by protests and
the exodus of thousands of its people.
   The action followed Tuesday's resignation of the entire Cabinet
and another round of street demonstrations involving more than
100,000 people in four cities who demanded the right to choose their
own government.
   East Germans skeptical about the government's promises of reforms
continued to flee their homeland today, with more than 50,000 people
reaching West Germany since Saturday.
   The entire 21-member Politburo resigned in a major leadership
reshuffle, which opposition leaders and party members alike had been
urging for days. It was Krenz's boldest move to get a grip on power
since he became leader last month.
   The party's 163-member Central Committee then reaffirmed Krenz as
party leader and voted in four new members to the Politburo,
including Dresden party chief Hans Modrow, who have backed
Soviet-style reforms.
   Krenz and six other members who support his reforms were
re-elected to the ruling body.
   Modrow also was nominated for the post of premier, the state-run
news agency ADN said. The Politburo is the country's most powerful
decision-making body. The Central Committee approves leadership and
major policy changes.
   ``Our country is going through a tense and extremely difficult
development,'' Krenz said in a speech to the Central Committee. He
indicated that independent non-communist groups would be allowed a
greater role in society.
   Meanwhile, ADN said that provincial authorities in several cities
were beginning to legally register New Forum, the largest pro-reform
group.
   Later today, Krenz addressed a crowd of several thousand people _
mostly party faithful _ in front of the Communist Party
headquarters. ``We want a socialism that is politically democratic
and morally clean,'' he said.
   In Washington, deputy White House press secretary Roman Popadiuk
said the Bush administration hoped the dramatic change in the
Politburo's makeup ``is a step on the road to stable and
evolutionary reform.''
   Today's action reduces the number of Politburo members from 21 to
11. In addition to Krenz and Modrow, the Central Committee
re-elected to a Politburo seat Guenter Schabowski, who has also
become a leading reform advocate.
   The Central Committee also voted to appoint Johannes Chemnitzer
as a non-voting member of the Politburo. Chemnitzer was the first
high-ranking East German politician to suggest discussing the need
for the Berlin Wall.
   In a brief dispatch, the official ADN news agency said Krenz
``suggested'' the Politburo resign ``so that the responsibility for
the current situation cn be made clear.''
   Many members of the outgoing Politburo are in their 60s and 70s
and are closely associated with Krenz's mentor, former hard-line
leader Erich Honecker. The aging leadership had increasingly lost
credibility, especially in the face of massive defections to the
West.
   Krenz, in office just three weeks, faces great difficulties as he
tries to assert authority in a country that exploded in unrest a
month ago as it marked the 40th anniversary of its founding as a
Communist state.
   Krenz has indicated no intention of releasing the Communists'
grip on power. He is under growing pressure at home and abroad to
follow the lead of discredited Communist rulers in Poland and
Hungary and share power.
   Before the Politburo action, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West
Germany urged East German Communists to surrender their monopoly on
power, approve free elections and clear the way for economic reforms.
   ``With this condition, I am also ready to discuss a new dimension
in our economic aid,'' Kohl told Parliament in Bonn. West Germany
has several times offered East Berlin substantial new financial aid
if wide-ranging reforms are embraced.
   On Tuesday, more than 100,000 people rallied in at least four
East German cities after the resignation of the Cabinet, a 44-member
body that has little power and implements policy made by the
Politburo.
   About 5,000 East Berliners marched past the party building to
demand free elections and shouted, ``Egon we are the competitors,''
and ``We are the people.'' The few police outside the party building
did not intervene.
   Border officials in West Germany said the number of refugees
reaching Bavaria by way of Czechoslovakia since Saturday, when free
exit through that country was first permitted, had reached more than
50,000.
   Czechoslovakia is the only country to which East Germans can
travel freely.
   The escape route opened Saturday created the first free passage
to the West since the Berlin Wall went up in 1961. Authorities have
said the route will remain open until a new travel law takes effect,
possibly before Christmas.
   So far this year, more than 190,000 East Germans _ more than 1
percent of the population of 16.6 million _ have moved to West
Germany by emigrating legally, escaping or failing to return from
approved trips abroad.
   West Germany gives them automatic citizenship and help in
starting new lives.

   A judge who told a divorcee she couldn't
live with her boyfriend and keep her child is out of touch with the
times, observed a state Supreme Court justice who said the case
reminded her of ``Harper Valley P.T.A.''
   Two high court justices on a panel considering an appeal by the
mother noted Tuesday that it's rare these days for custody disputes
to be settled on the basis of alleged misconduct by a spouse after a
divorce.
   The mother, Judith Roush, asked the court to overturn an order by
Kanawha County Judge John Hey, who gave her 30 days to marry her
boyfriend, move out of his house or give up custody of her
14-year-old daughter, Melissa.
   Hay issued the order Aug. 23 order at the request of Mrs. Roush's
former husband, Rodney Dell Roush. They were divorced in January
1988.
   At the Supreme Court hearing, Justice Margaret Workman said
repeated court decisions have rejected the notion that cohabitation
is grounds for removing a child from a parent's custody.
   ``It reminds me of `Harper Valley P.T.A.,''' Workman said,
recalling the hit 1968 ballad of small-town moralizing.
   Justice Richard Neely said the notion of defining post-marital
misconduct is impossible in modern society.
   ``How do you define misconduct?'' Neely said. ``Nobody in the
world agrees on misconduct.''
   The appeal said Hey rejected the recommendation of a court
official known as a family law master because Mrs. Roush and her
daughter live with Robert Cain, though he and Mrs. Roush aren't
married. The family law master recommended that the girl stay with
her mother.
   Attorney Larry L. Skeen, who represented Hey at the hearing,
noted there's a state law against ``lewd and lacivious
cohabitation.'' If the laws of the state on morality are outdated,
the state Supreme Court should ``just say they are.''
   ``Can you imagine any jury in West Virginia convicting someone
for cohabitating?'' Neely asked.
   ``You'd have to pick your jury carefully,'' Skeen said to an
outburst of laughter.
   The Supreme Court did not immediately rule.
   Mrs. Roush's petition said she earns $80-$100 a week in net
income and cannot afford to maintain an apartment of her own, the
suit said.
   Hey was out of his office Tuesday and could not be reached for
comment.

   A 70-year-old man whose boat caught fire in
Lake Altus-Lugert swam 1{ hours to knee-deep water, then clutched
his chest and died of a heart attack, authorities said.
   The Highway Patrol said Hoyt Shadid of Altus was pronounced dead
on arrival Tuesday at Elk View General Hospital.
   His 82-year-old brother, Abe Shadid, who also jumped out of the
boat as the flames neared the gas tank, was treated and released,
the patrol said.
   After Hoyt Shadid fell over in the knee-deep water, the patrol
said, his brother called for help. Two park employees pulled him out
of the water and tried to revive him.
   The patrol did not report how far the boat was from the shore or
how the fire started. Troopers said both men were wearing life
jackets.

   A pilot trainee, Ensign Steven Pontell, 23, of Columbia, Md.,
crashed while making his first solo approach to a carrier.
   Four people on the flight deck were killed with him, and 19

   President Bush's nomination of his cousin, John

prominent legal scholar as a violation of the law against nepotism
in government.
   ``He would not have gotten this nomination if he were not the
president's cousin,'' Harvard law Professor Alan M. Dershowitz said
Tuesday at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.
   Walker, 48, currently a U.S. District Court judge in New York,
drew no critics other than Dershowitz at the hearing. The committee
is not expected to vote on whether to recommend the nomination to
the full Senate for several weeks, a customary delay.
   Dershowitz told the panel that Walker ``got this appointment
because of family connections'' and that it ``violates the
anti-nepotism statute both in language and in spirit.''
   White House deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk said today,
``No law is being broken, period.'' He said Walker had received the
American Bar Association's highest rating.
   Under the 1976 law, federal officials may not name relatives to
government jobs. Dershowitz said he thinks the statute covers the
Walker nomination but later told reporters there was room for
disagreement on that point.
   He told the committee that even if the law does not apply to
judicial nominations, the Walker nomination ``violates the spirit of
the law.''
   Walker, elegantly dressed and bearing a slight resemblance to his
cousin, sat a few feet away as Dershowitz described him as an
``average'' rather than a distinguished judge. Once he shook his
head impatiently.
   ``Judge Walker's name would not have appeared on the long list or
the short list'' if Bush had polled the New York bar to find a
candidate for the post, Dershowitz said.
   ``It shouldn't be enough that he is minimally qualified,'' he
said.
   Dershowitz also said that Walker once held an improper discussion
with an attorney in a court matter growing out of the
attempted-murder trial of socialite Claus Von Bulow, who was
subsequently acquitted. Walker denied the allegation.

   Mug shots 6 feet by 3 feet of Florida's
most wanted felony fugitives will stare at motorists across in a new
billboard campaign, a state official said Wednesday.
   James ``Tim'' Moore, commissioner of the Florida Department of
Law Enforcement, predicted the program would be successful because
public exposure is the one thing fugitives can't stand.
   About 100 billboards eventually will carry the mug shots, he
said. Moore said he knew of no other state with a similar program.
   People who provide tips that lead to the arrest of the fugitives
will be eligible for rewards of up to $5,000, Moore said. The
billboards list a toll-free number.
   Next week 10 billboards featuring the face of Bruce Edward
Frazier, wanted on charges of first-degree murder and kidnapping
stemming from a quadruple murder in Escambia County last September,
will go up, Moore said.
   Since Florida's most wanted program began in January, six of the
13 fugitives listed have been taken into custody.

<DATELINE>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Mike Hayden today proposed curbs on
late-term abortions and called for a requirement that girls under 16
notify at least one parent before terminating a pregnancy.
   The proposed changes in Kansas' relatively liberal abortion law
do not go nearly as far as those expected to be offered by
anti-abortion activists after the Legislature convenes Jan. 8.
   Kansas law bans the use of public funds for abortions but
otherwise allows abortion virtually on demand.
   Hayden's Republican administration has been developing a position
on the issue since the U.S. Supreme Court in July opened the door to
more restrictive abortion laws. The court upheld a Missouri law
banning use of public funds and facilities for most abortions.
   Florida's Legislature last month flatly rejected curbs on
abortion pushed by Gov. Bob Martinez. In Pennsylvania, the state
House overwhelmingly approved what would be the nation's most
restrictive abortion laws; the legislation goes next to the Senate.
   Hayden unveiled his proposals during a speech to the Kansas
Public Health Association in Manhattan.
   ``I believe the decision to have an abortion in the first 22
weeks of pregnancy should be determined by the woman involved and
her doctor,'' he said.
   But he proposed that after 22 weeks a woman not be allowed to get
an abortion unless her health is at risk, the pregnancy is the
result of rape or incest or the fetus is severely deformed.
   ``As neighboring states come to enact restrictions on late-term
abortions, we do not want Kansas to become an abortion mill for the
nation,'' Hayden said.
   Anti-abortion activists have said they will seek an outright ban
on late-term abortions and on all abortions at the University of
Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, Kan.
   Hayden said the state should maintain its ban on the use of
public funds for abortions but that outlawing all abortions at the
medical center ``could have serious consequences, particularly for
preganant women with life-threatening conditions.''
   He said parental notification legislation would promote
communication in families. ``Public policy in Kansas should support
families,'' he said. ``In 35 other states, parental notification or
consent laws have been enacted.''
   Pat Goodson, lobbyist for Right to Life of Kansas Inc., which
endorsed Hayden during his 1986 campaign, harshly criticized the
proposals.
   ``What he's done is advocate the do-nothing position of the
so-called moderate wing of the pro-choice movement,'' she said.
   House Speaker Jim Braden, a Republican, endorsed Hayden's stand.
He said, ``I believe the decision, whether to have an abortion,
should be made by a woman and her doctor. I laud the governor for
his leadership and courage.''

<UNK>Atlanta Mayor Says Black Victories Won't Affect His Gubernatorial

<TEXT>
   Mayor Andrew Young, who plans to run for governor
next year, said Wednesday that this week's victories by black
candidates won't have much bearing on his campaign.
   ``I'm certainly encouraged by the election of Democrats all over
the country, and in particular two good friends of mine,'' Young
said at a news conference, referring to David Dinkins and L. Douglas
Wilder.
   ``But other than the fact that we all went to the same college
(Howard University) and we all happen to have the same skin color,
there isn't really a lot we have in common.''
   Dinkins won election Tuesday as New York City's first black
mayor, and Wilder claimed a disputed victory in Virginia's
gubernatorial race. If he is the winner, Wilder would be the
nation's first black governor.
   Although he has not yet formally announced as a candidate, Young
is expected to enter a crowded race for Georgia's Democratic
gubernatorial nomination.
   Young said his political experience, like that of Dinkins and
Wilder, would be an advantage.
   ``I think Georgia has come further in race relations than
Virginia,'' he added. ``We have more elected black officials.''
   If race should become an issue in next year's election, ``I think
it would be rejected by Georgians. Georgians are ready to get that
chapter behind us.''

   Alberto Vitale will become the new chairman,
president and chief executive officer of Random House Inc., the
largest general trade book publisher in the United States, it was
announced Wednesday.
   Vitale, 55, is currently president and chief executive of the

Bernstein, who is retiring at the end of the year.
   S.I. Newhouse Jr., chairman of Advance Publications Inc., which
owns Random House, made the announcement at a meeting of executives
and editors.
   ``Bob has built Random House into one of the world's great
publishing businesses,'' Vitale said. ``But at the same time ... he
has preserved the sense that Random House is still the firm that
Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer founded many years ago _ a place
that cares about its authors, a place that retains a human scale
despite its growth, a place where authors and employees come and
stay.''
   Vitale will become the third leader of Random House in its
64-year history. He will join the firm Dec. 1 and take his new
position Jan. 3, 1990, the announcement said.
   Vitale began his publishing career in 1975 when he joined Bantam
Books Inc. as director of administration. He moved up to executive
vice president in 1979 and in 1986 was named president and chief
executive.
   He was appointed to his present position in December 1986 after
Doubleday &amp; Co. was acquired by Bertelsmann AG, the West

<HEAD>House Panel Concerned About Use of Trade Sanctions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Ways and Means Committee expressed
concern Wednesday about the use of U.S. trade sanctions to achieve
U.S. foreign policy goals, saying they work only if many countries
impose them.
   The panel urged President Bush to try to persuade other nations
to impose sanctions in support of the United States and to consider
ending U.S. sanctions if they do not.
   The committee comments came as it endorsed pending legislation
authorizing the use of trade sanctions against foreign countries and
companies whose actions lead to the spread or use of chemical or
biological weapons.
   Several committees have jurisdiction over the legislation,
endorsed earlier by the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   The House version of the bill requires the president to impose
sanctions against foreign companies that have substantially
contributed to another country's ability to make or use chemical or
biological weapons.
   Other sanctions could be imposed against countries obtaining or
using chemical weapons.
   The bill gives the president flexibility in choosing whether to
impose sanctions and is generally weaker than legislation pending in
the Senate. It gives the president authority to waive sanctions if
he determines that doing so is in the interest of the United States.
   The Ways and Means Committee said in a policy statement that
evidence strongly indicates that sanctions are most effective when
imposed by many nations.
   ``Unilateral sanctions rarely have a significant effect on the
target country,'' the panel said, adding that sanctions imposed by
the United States alone place an ``unduly heavy burden'' on U.S.
exporters and importers and give an unwarranted advantage to U.S.
trading partners.
   ``The committee therefore urges the administration, if it imposes
sanctions against a country under authority of this bill, to seek
the timely imposition of substantially similar sanctions by other
major producers of goods and technology which can be used to make or
use chemical or biological weapons,'' the panel said.

<TEXT>
   Retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord
pleaded guilty today to one count of lying to congressional
investigators in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   Secord had been scheduled to go on trial next Monday on 12
criminal charges, nine of them stemming from his testimony to
Congress in 1987.
   But at a pre-trial hearing, Iran-Contra prosecutor Reid
Weingarten announced that the government and Secord's lawyers had
negotiated a plea agreement. The government will seek dismissal of
the other 11 criminal charges against Secord, who also could have
faced tax charges, prosecutors said.
   ``No further criminal charges, including criminal tax charges,
will be brought against the defendant based on information now known
to the Office of Independent Counsel relating to the Iran-Contra
affair,'' the plea agreement stated.
   Prosecutors were prepared to present evidence that ``Secord
personally received ... in excess of $1.5 million'' in profits from
the sale of weapons to the Contras and Iran, the office of
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh said in court papers.
   Secord agreed to ``cooperate fully'' with Iran-Contra prosecutors
``by testifying truthfully at any trial ... to which he may be
called,'' according to the plea agreement.
   He could become a government witness against former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter, whose criminal trial is
scheduled to begin Jan. 22. Poindexter is accused of obstructing
Congress and giving false statements in various investigations.
   Poindexter has told the judge in his case that his daily meetings
with then-President Reagan included discussions of Secord's role as
a middleman in the transfer of arms to Iran. Poindexter is trying to
subpoena Reagan's notes and diaries.
   Secord flew with Poindexter from Central America to the United
States on April 20, 1986, after the two men reviewed problems in
White House aide Oliver North's secret Contra re-supply network.
   When they landed in Miami, Secord and Poindexter met with North
at the offices of Southern Air, a former CIA-owned company involved
in Contra re-supply, according to deposition testimony given to
Congress by one of the participants in the operation.
   Secord admitted in U.S. District Court that he made a false
statement when he told congressional investigators on June 10, 1987,
that he had not been aware any money from his business dealings in
the Iran-Contra affair went to White House aide Oliver North.
   Secord told Judge Aubrey Robinson that he had paid for a $13,800
security fence at North's home.
   ``I should have known that they were aiming at the fence,''
Secord said of the question by congressional investigators that led
to his false statement. Secord said his answer was ``a misguided
effort to prevent further criticism,'' noting that there had
``already been a firestorm in the press'' about who paid for North's
security fence.
   Secord said ``I was trying to shield both of us'' when he lied
about North's fence in his deposition to the congressional
investigators.
   Secord could be sentenced to up to five years in prison.
   Secord's profits for his work on the administration's Iran arms
sales and assisting the Contras ``exceed $1.5 million,'' prosecutors
said in a recent court filing. Secord had been called into both
initiatives by North.
   The government presented a document listing the evidence it would
have presented at Secord's trial in support of the charge to which
he pleaded guilty.
   The document stated that in addition to Secord paying for the
fence, there was an attempted cover-up of who paid for the fence
through the use of back-dated documents.
   Secord's attorney, Thomas Green, objected to that portion of the
government's evidence, saying Secord had not been involved in a
cover-up.
   The document also said Secord and his business partner, Albert
Hakim, had arranged to set aside $200,000 for an insurance fund for
North's wife for the education of the North children.
   The document said Secord told North that the money had been set
aside.
   In his congressional testimony in 1987, North testified that he
knew nothing of the $200,000.
   Secord's deal with prosecutors was first reported Tuesday night
by NBC-TV.
   Secord was one of the first figures in the Iran-Contra affair to
cooperate with the congressional investigation. He was the leadoff
witness in televised hearings in the summer of 1987 and testified
without immunity from prosecution that was granted others, including
North.
   Hakim and Secord were the middlemen in U.S.-Iran arms sales.
Secord, an expert in covert operations, also helped North, then a
National Security Council aide, set up a secret arms supply network
to the Nicaraguan rebels.

   Thirty-five years ago, Silvio
Santos was selling wallets illegally on street corners, with a quick
patter to attract customers and an eye out for the police.
   Santos, a multimillionaire executive and controlling stockholder
of Brazil's second-largest TV network, now enthralls millions with
his antics on camera. He also may become the next president of Latin
America's largest country in the Nov. 15 election.
   ``I don't have any plan,'' said Santos, 58, shortly after
declaring his candidacy at the last minute on Oct. 31 for the
country's first direct presidential vote in 29 years. ``But I felt
the desire of the people.
   ``If the railsplitter Abraham Lincoln was president of the United
States and the actor Ronald Reagan as well _ and for two terms _ a
street vendor who became an entertainer and businessman can be
president of Brazil,'' he was quoted as saying in Veja magazine,
Brazil's largest newsweekly.
   The Supreme Electoral Court is expected to rule by Friday on
whether Santos' ``wild-card'' candidacy, as a substitute on the
ticket of the minuscule, unknown Brazilian Municipalist Party, is
legal.
   A spot poll by the Brazilian Gallup Institute on Nov. 2 showed
the popular TV personality leading the other 21 candidates with a 29
percent voter preference. Two polls released since then put him in
second place, with 14 percent and 18 percent, after center-right
candidate Fernando Collor de Mello.
   On Monday, Collor de Mello accused President Jose Sarney of
trying to manipulate the election by backing Santos. Both Santos and
Sarney, who by law cannot run again, deny the allegations. Although
the president has not endorsed Santos, he opposes Collor de Mello, a
former governor who has accused Sarney of being corrupt and
incompetent.
   Santos, born Senor Abravanel into a Greek-Jewish working-class
family in Rio, said, ``It's not my fault if the election fell into
my hands at this moment.''
   Santos sold odds and ends in downtown Rio, watching for police
because he didn't have a vendor's license. He later got the beer and
soft-drink concession on ferryboats crossing Rio's Guanabara Bay and
entertained commuters over a loudspeaker.
   Next came stints as a radio announcer and circus performer.
   In 1958, in Sao Paulo, Brazil's biggest city, Santos took over a
business through which poor Brazilians without credit could buy
household goods by making monthly payments in coupon books.
   The system, called the ``Trunk of Happiness,'' let people
exchange coupons for merchandise. With it, Santos turned his one-man
operation into one of the biggest private conglomerates in Latin
America. Grupo Silvio Santos has some 50 companies employing nearly
20,000 people.
   To sell more coupon books, Santos in 1965 bought TV time on
Sunday afternoons and put on his own variety show in which he
cajoled viewers into signing up for the ``Trunk of Happiness.''
   When Santos decided to raffle off houses as special prizes, the
response was so great he set up a construction company to meet the
demand. He later bought an automobile dealership, sold auto
insurance, formed a securities investment firm and went into the
retailing business.
   In 1975, he bought his own TV station; in 1981, with the backing
of the military dictatorship that then ruled Brazil, he became the
owner of the SBT network.
   Running for eight hours every Sunday, ``The Silvio Santos
Program'' is a mixture of game shows and a beauty pageant.
   Polls show that Santos' political support comes largely from the
masses who watch his show and buy his time-payment coupons. The
Census Bureau says that of 82 million registered voters in a
population of 150 million, only 31 percent have completed eighth
grade and 75 percent make less than the average salary equal to $36
a week.
   To vote for Santos, Brazilians will have to draw an `X' through
the box next to the name of Armando Correa, the Municipalist Party
candidate who withdrew to make way for Santos.
   But first the Supreme Court must rule whether Santos is affected
by a law that directors of government-licensed businesses, such as
TV stations and networks, must resign at least three months before
running in an election.
   Santos's lawyers said that although he is the main stockholder in
the SBT network, he is not an active director.
   Jose Francsco Rezek, president of the seven-member electoral
court, said the tribunal would rule by Friday.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Wednesday
offered badly needed financial support to East Germany if the
nation's Communist leadership surrenders its 40-year monopoly on
power.
   In East Berlin, the Communist Party's ruling Politburo resigned
in a major leadership reshuffle brought on by weeks of unprecedented
unrest and an exodus of thousands of East Germans to the West.
   Kohl, in a state-of-the-nation address delivered to Parliament,
warned the Communist government in East Berlin against trying to
make do with ``cosmetic changes.''
   ``We are not prepared to support a system that has lost its
legitimacy,'' Kohl said. ``But we are prepared to offer far-reaching
help if genuine and thorough-going political and economic reforms
take root.''
   Kohl urged the Communists to relinquish their monopoly on power,
to legalize independent political parties and to allow free
elections.
   ``Under these conditions we are prepared to discuss a new
dimension in our financial assistance (to East Germany),'' Kohl said.
   But Kohl made it clear that any such increase in economic aid
would have to be linked to progress in establishing a more
market-oriented economy.
   ``Without a dismantling of a centrally planned and bureaucratic
economy and the creation of a market-oriented economy our help will
be in vain,'' Kohl said.
   Kohl said it was West Germany's ``national task'' to promote
political and economic change in East Germany.
   West Germany already pays out millions of dollars in financial
aid to East Germany, including transit subsidies and special
economic credits.
   New Communist leader Egon Krenz was reaffirmed in his post, and
several prominent reformers were named to the powerful body. Krenz
has promised to introduce wide-ranging political and economic
reforms, but the pledge has so far not ended widespread street
protests and the westward flight of his people.
   Referring to the mass exodus, whose latest surge has brought
50,000 to West Germany via the Czechoslovak border since Saturday,
Kohl said:
   ``These refugees are voting with their feet against a system that
has denied them their basic rights and freedoms.''
   Kohl said the dramatic developments in East Germany have showed
the world that ``the division of our land is unnatural.''
   ``The (Berlin) Wall and the barbed wire cannot stand forever,''
he said. ``These events have made it clear before the eyes of the
world that the German question is still to be solved, because the
people cannot accept the present'' division.

   Joan Rivers said four days after her husband
killed himself, she flew into a rage, cursed him and smashed all his
medicine bottles.
   ``I opened his medicine chest, which I was never allowed to go

   Miss Rivers said she asked, ``What did you do to us?'' then

   The entertainer described the 2-year-old episode during taping of
her syndicated television talk show. The show taped last week is to

   Rosenberg killed himself with an overdose of sedatives Aug. 14,
1987. He left tapes in which he expressed despondency over his
health and business problems.

   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger followed
in the footsteps of his ex-boss Wednesday, meeting with senior
Chinese officials.
   Former President Nixon paid a visit to China last week.
   Nixon and Kissinger are considered old friends of China. Both got
warm welcomes in Beijing and access to top Chinese leaders.
   Kissinger met with two vice premiers and a prominent Chinese
businessman, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   Kissinger is in China at the invitation of the Chinese Foreign
Ministry, but Chinese officials have refused to give details of the
visit or even say how long Kissinger will stay.

   Prince Charles laid a university cornerstone and
Princess Diana toured a drug clinic Wednesday during their Hong Kong
visit.
   The princess flew by helicopter to the Shek Kwu Chau
rehabilitation center, about 13 miles southwest of downtown Hong
Kong, and chatted with drug addicts.
   Charles began the second day of their official visit by laying a
foundation stone for Hong Kong's third university, saying ``there
can be no more important investment than developing and improving
the education opportunities available to all.''
   China is to take control of Hong Kong from Britain in 1997.
   The royal visit comes at a particularly sensitive time for Hong
Kong, which was shaken by China's harsh summer crackdown on dissent
and was angered by London's unwillingless to offer the right of
abode in Britain to more than a fraction of the colony's 5.7 million
people.

   Seven years, a Playboy photo spread,
a best-selling book and a television movie later, Roxanne Pulitzer
is going back to court.
   A judge set Jan. 16 for a trial on Ms. Pulitzer's request that
her visits with her 12-year-old twin sons be increased.
   After a much-publicized 1982 divorce trial filled with testimony
about infidelity, sexual experimentation and drug use in Palm Beach
society, Ms. Pulitzer lost custody of the twins to her millionaire
ex-husband, Herbert ``Peter'' Pulitzer.
   ``I have mixed emotions about the courts,'' Ms. Pulitzer said
Tuesday. But ``one must do what one must do for their children.''
   In court papers, Pulitzer claimed his former wife's nude
photographs in Playboy magazine, talk-show publicity, a television
movie and her best-selling book render her unfit to spend more time
with their sons.
   The twins moved with their father, who is the grandson of
publishing magnate Joseph Pulitzer, from Palm Beach to a ranch in
Okeechobee County three years ago.
   Ms. Pulitzer's lawyer, Donald Sasser, said her former husband has
consistently made it difficult for her to spend time with the boys.
   ``We're just asking for more than 70 days,'' Sasser said.

   The president may order U.S. agents to arrest
terrorists and drug traffickers overseas without a foreign nation's
consent even if it violates international law, a Justice Department
official said Wednesday.
   At a congressional hearing, Assistant Attorney General William P.
Barr defended his June 21 opinion that the FBI has the legal
authority in certain circumstances to go into foreign countries and
arrest fugitives without a host government's permission.
   The State Department's chief legal adviser, Abraham D. Sofaer,
supported Barr's legal reasoning but outlined several dangers that
the United States could face by engaging in conduct ``which departs
from accepted norms.''
   His comments reflected what one lawmaker termed obvious
differences between the State and Justice Departments over the
ruling.
   Barr and Sofaer both said the legal ruling about FBI arrest
authority did not signal any change in the Justice Department of
administration policy respecting foreign sovereignty.
   But the two officials outlined circumstances under which the
FBI's legal authority might be used to seize terrorists or drug
traffickers who pose a serious threat to the security of American
citizens.
   ``The bottom line is if we find a terrorist, for example, who
blows an American 747 out of the sky, if we find him basking in some
safe haven, enjoying the payoff of his operation ... the issue is
whether we have the authority under our law to go in an arrest
him,'' Barr told the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil and
constitutional rights.
   ``In response to an actual or threatened terrorist attack, we
would have good grounds under general principles of international
law to justify extraterritorial law enforcement actions over a
foreign sovereign's objections,'' Barr told the panel's chairman,
Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif.
   The president may decide to arrest ``large-scale drug traffickers
being given safe haven by a government acting in complicity with
their criminal enterprise,'' Barr said.
   Edwards said he couldn't understand why such a ``very radical
program'' was proposed when the number of domestic terrorist
incidents ``this year and last were infinitesimal.''
   ``I'm sure the families of the people on Pan Am 103 will be glad
to know that the incidents in the United States were
infinitesimal,'' Barr replied, referring to the terrorist bombing
last December of a U.S.-bound Pan Am jetliner that killed 259 people
over Scotland.
   Edwards charged that the legal authority asserted by Barr's
opinion would tarnish America's reputation as the ``beacon of
democracy.''
   Barr cited numerous court cases supporting the proposition that
the United States could violate international law to assert its
sovereignty as long as there was no specific ban in American law.
   ``It may well be that the president will choose to direct
extraterritorial arrests only when he believes that he is justified
in doing so as a matter of self-defense under international law,''
Barr said.
   Sofaer, meanwhile, endorsed the idea that international law could
be breached in self-defense to protect Americans from terrorists or
drug traffickers who engage in terrorism.
   ``An act of self-defense is a justified act under international
law'' and the United Nations Charter, Sofaer said.
   But Sofaer, who has previously testified against legislation that
would have given the FBI the authority outlined in Barr's opinion,
warned of the political consequences of the ruling.
   ``We need to consider the fact that our legal position may be
seized upon by other nations to engage in irresponsible conduct
against our interests,'' he said.
   Edwards noted that the Iranian parliament ``has cited the Justice
Department opinion to say that they have the same right to come into
the United States to arrest their fugitives without our knowledge
and kidnap them.''

<HEAD>Car Bomb Explodes Shortly Before New President's Arrival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RIMA SALAMEH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded in Moslem west Beirut
an hour before the arrival Wednesday of Rene Mouawad, Lebanon's new
Christian president. Police said four people were killed and 19
wounded.
   A red Volvo exploded in the Caracas neighborhood three blocks
from a villa put at Mouawad's disposal by Rafiq Hariri, a Lebanese
businessman living in Saudi Arabia, police said.
   Gen. Michel Aoun, the Christian army commander, occupies the
shell-pocked presidential palace in Baabda, a Christian suburb. He
opposed Parliament's election of Mouawad, who is supported by Aoun's
Syrian enemies, and refuses to vacate the palace.
   Police said the dead included a boy, a 37-year-old woman and a
vegetable vendor. They said the wounded included three members of
one family and a 70-year-old man.
   The explosion shattered windows in the area and set least 10 cars
ablaze in a parking lot 500 yards from a Syrian army checkpoint.
Syrian soldiers fired shots into the air to clear the way for
ambulances and fire engines.
   Residents ran to the parking lot hoping to save their cars.
   A young man sped out of the lot in a black car covered with
shards of glass and hit a boy in the street. Rescuers put the boy in
an ambulance.
   An ambulance with a loudspeaker drove through the streets urging
people to donate blood.
   No group claimed responsibility for the seventh car bombing in
Lebanon this year. Thirty people were killed and 225 wounded in the
previous six, by police count.
   Mouawad arrived from Syrian-controlled north Lebanon in a Middle
East Airlines plane that landed an hour after the bombing. He was
taken to an apartment building Hariri owns at at Ramlet Baida, far
from the explosion site.
   His route was kept secret. Syrian troops and Lebanese riot
policemen sealed the area around seven-story apartment building.
   Mouawad, 64, was elected Sunday in north Lebanon. Parliament
moved its session to Syrian-controlled territory because Aoun
threatened to shell the Parliament building in Beirut.
   Aoun says the 40,000 soldiers Syria keeps in Lebanon, under a
1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League, are an occupation
army and has declared a ``war of liberation'' to drive them out.
   A six-month artillery battle between his forces and the Syrians
killed hundreds of people and wounded thousands before a cease-fire
stopped it in September.
   Sources said Mouawad would announce formation of a national
reconciliation government by the end of the week in hopes of ending
the 14-year-old sectarian civil war, which has cost more than
150,000 lives.
   George Hawi, head of the Syrian-backed Lebanese Communist Party,
threatened to kill Aoun for rejecting Mouawad.
   Hawi was quoted by the party newspaper An-Nida as saying his
militia had other fighters like Soha Bishara, who attempted last
year to kill former army Maj. Antoine Lahd, commander of a south
Lebanon militia allied with Israel. Lahd was wounded and treated in
Israel.
   Aoun and acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss have led competing
Christian and Moslem governments since September 1988, when
President Amin Gemayel's six-year term ended with Parliament unable
to agree on a successor.
   The general declared Parliament dissolved on Saturday and claims
it met illegally Sunday to elect Mouawad and approve a peace plan
negotiated in Taif, Saudi Arabia.
   He has said he will continue to control the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave north and east of Beirut with the 20,000 soldiers
he commands, but how many troopers will stick with him in a
confrontation with Mouawad is uncertain.

<DATELINE>EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former judge accused of
escaping from a federal prison turned himself in, saying he thought
he had been released.
   Paul Ottinger, 74, surrendered in his hometown of Hagerstown,
Md., on Tuesday. He said he had heard on the radio that he was
wanted for escape, said Sheriff Charles Mades of Washington County,
Md.
   ``He thought he'd been released from federal prison,'' Mades
said. ``It was his understanding he had four days to find his way
back to Hagerstown.''
   Ottinger was to be paroled Friday _ the day he disappeared from
the unfenced, minimum-security prison here, where he was serving a
six-month term for mail fraud _ and was then supposed to be
transferred to Maryland to serve a state sentence.
   He was a judge from 1971 to 1977 and then returned to private
practice. He was convicted of lying on financial statements to
banks, forging checks and insurance papers and stealing thousands of
dollars from the estates of dead people.
   Ottinger had a good chance of being been paroled from state
prison in a month or two but now may face up to five more years if
convicted of escape, officials said.
   The inmate told Mades he spent the weekend with friends in
Mobile, Ala., and then flew to Hagerstown and went immediately by
taxi to the sheriff's office.
   Mike Earp, an investigator with the U.S. marshal's office, which
was looking for the judge, said he didn't believe Ottinger's story.
   ``There's no doubt in my mind he knew what he was doing,'' Earp
said.
   Earp said it will be up to the U.S. attorney's office to decide
whether to bring escape charges.
   Ottinger once said he didn't want to serve time in state prison
because he was afraid that inmates he had sentenced would try to
kill him.

   The Supreme Court has reaffirmed its opposition
to permitting television cameras in its courtroom.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, in an Oct. 27 letter to a
lawyer representing a group of news organizations, said a majority
of the court's nine members remains opposed to cameras in their
courtroom.
   The lawyer, Timothy B. Dyk, said Wednesday he is disappointed but
remains hopeful the justices will change their mind. ``It won't
happen now. But I hope it will happen one day,'' he said.
   Dyk arranged a demonstration one year ago of how cameras would
operate in the high court's stately and ornate chamber.
   Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Byron R. White
observed the demonstration, in which a small video camera was placed
in an alcove to focus on the justices and a second camera was
directed at the area lawyers stand to argue their cases.
   Rehnquist's letter to Dyk did not offer any explanation for the
justices' decision, nor did it specify which members opposed cameras
in the court.
   But court sources have said some justices were turned against TV
coverage by the televised Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on
Robert H. Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court.
   Bork's nomination was rejected by the Senate.
   The U.S. Judicial Conference, the federal courts' policy-making
arm headed by Rehnquist, has enforced a ban on electronic and
photographic coverage of all federal courts.
   Televised news coverage of state court proceedings is permitted
by 44 states.

   Relatives of people killed in the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 said the government assured them
Wednesday it had issued timely warnings to airlines about the
potential threat of a terrorist attack.
   Five Americans and two Britons, representing a group called The
Victims of Pan Am Flight 103, are meeting with government officials
this week to gather information about the Dec. 21, 1988, disaster
over Scotland.
   Group leader Frank Rosenkranz said Hesse state officials assured
the delegation they had transmitted two warnings of possible
terrorist attacks to airlines ``in a timely fashion.''
   Hesse state oversees security at Frankfurt airport, where the
doomed flight originated.
   Rosenkranz, a New York lawyer, lost his wife in the crash.
   Group members said they would press West German government
officials in further talks Thursday in Bonn about recent claims by
Pan Am.
   The airline alleges U.S. authorities were warned by West Germany
90 minutes before the plane's takeoff of suspicious activity in the
baggage handling area of Frankfurt airport.
   ``There is no question there were numerous warnings'' about
Flight 103, said Bert Ammermann, a River Vale, N.J., resident whose
brother died in the crash.
   ``Why wasn't all this pulled together? That's the answer we're
going to pursue,'' he told reporters at the Hesse state Economics
Ministry, where Wednesday's talks were held.
   West German authorities say they issued a general warning about
possible terrorist attacks the month before the bombing, but denied
there were last-minute warnings specifically about Flight 103.
   The relatives are representatives of a survivors' group that
claims about 400 U.S. and 40 British members. The group already has
had similar talks with U.S. and British authorities.
   Rosenkranz said the group was set up to press for airline
security improvements and keep the Lockerbie case in the public eye.
   Ammermann said the talks with Hesse officials were ``the most
refreshing and positive'' so far.
   During three days of talks, the group also was to meet with the
Frankfurt prosecutor handling the case.
   After the flight originated in Frankfurt, passengers and luggage
were transferred to the ill-fated Boeing 747 jetliner at Heathrow
airport in London. The plane exploded over the town of Lockerbie
after taking off from Heathrow bound for New York.
   News reports have alleged the bombing has been traced to
terrorists of the radical People's Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
   Pan American World Airways has filed papers in U.S. federal court
seeking access to any information showing that U.S. authorities
received the pre-flight warning about Flight 103.
   The airline, facing $300 million in lawsuits, wants a court order
for documents and interviews at the CIA and other U.S. agencies,
along with any information the government may have about warnings
before the flight.

<TEXT>
   An anti-abortion prosecutor worried that state
officials may back down and settle a major abortion-rights case
before it goes to the U.S. Supreme Court lost a bid today to take
part in the negotiations.
   U.S. District Judge John A. Nordberg rejected a request from
Madison County State's Attorney William R. Haine to replace the Cook
County state's attorney as Illinois' representative in the case. The
judge said he saw no reason to make such a change.
   The abortion case, if decided by the high court, could open the
door to more restrictive laws across the country. But a settlement
would prevent such an outcome.
   The case involves a challenge by a clinic owner, Dr. Richard
Ragsdale, to an Illinois regulation that he says requires him to
build the equivalent of a small hospital to do abortions. He
contends the regulation is a veiled attempt to restrict access to
abortions.
   The American Civil Liberties Union and the state are scheduled to
argue the case Dec. 5 before the Supreme Court but have been talking
in recent weeks in an effort to settle the case.
   Haine's lawyer, James Bopp Jr., general counsel to the National
Right to Life Committee, told The New York Times it is widely
believed the Supreme Court will uphold the Illinois law and that the
state is giving up the fight ``at the doorstep of victory.''
   It is one of three cases that the high court has agreed to hear
this term that could have far-reaching effects on abortion rights.

   It was not immediately known what caused the fire, which damaged
the upper rear fuselage of the C-5, the world's largest cargo plane.
   Authorities put jacks beneath the aircraft to keep it from

<HEAD>Gallup Poll Shows Soviets, Americans Weak in Geography</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young Soviets know more geography than young
Americans, but citizens of both superpower nations do poorly at
pinpointing the countries of the world, a Gallup poll showed
Wednesday.
   ``In today's world, if you don't know where you are, you are
nowhere _ and clearly a lot of people are nowhere,'' said Gilbert
Grosvenor, president of the National Geographic Society.
   The Gallup Organization poll, commissioned by the National
Geographic Society, was the first survey of geographic knowledge
conducted in the Soviet Union. The survey found:
   _Soviets between ages 18 and 24 correctly identified 9.3 places
of a possible 16 on a world map. That score was the same as for
young people surveyed in Japan, Canada, Italy and France, but below
the West Germans and Swedes. The American average was 6.9, the
lowest among all nations surveyed.
   _Soviets as a whole identified an average of 7.4 places or bodies
of water of a possible 16 on a world map, as did Mexicans surveyed.
Residents of Sweden topped the list with 11.6 correct, West Germany
11.2, Japan 9.7, France 9.3, Canada 9.2, United States 8.6, United
Kingdom 8.5 and Italy 7.6.
   _Thirteen percent of Soviet adults were unable to correctly
identify the Soviet Union on a world map, while 14 percent of the
Americans could not correctly identify the United States.
   ``Americans and Soviets have demonstrated an astonishing lack of
awareness of the world around them,'' Grosvenor said, adding the
result ``reinforces the need to strengthen the teaching of geography
in American classrooms.''
   Vladimir Andreyenkov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, which
conducted the survey with Gallup, said ``it was a shock'' that the
overall Soviet results fell short of Soviet researchers'
expectations.
   ``I didn't believe Soviet citizens know so little about
geography,'' he said. ``I rechecked the data many times. The results
were unbelievable. They will have very great repercussions in the
Soviet Union.''
   Neil Upmeyer, a Gallup vice president, attributed the poor
overall ranking of the Soviets to low scores among those over 55 who
grew up during World War II without adequate educational
opportunities.
   About 1,500 Soviet adults were surveyed in their homes last
spring in Moscow and Kursk, an industrial city of 425,000 people 300
miles south of the capital.
   Respondents were asked to locate 16 places on the world map: the
United States, Soviet Union, Central America, Japan, Canada, France,
Persian Gulf, Mexico, Italy, Sweden, United Kingdom, South Africa,
West Germany, Pacific Ocean, Egypt and Vietnam.
   The Soviets also were asked to locate Afghanistan, which borders
it to the south.
   Nearly 11,000 people in Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Mexico,
Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States and West Germany were
tested in spring 1988 and the results were announced last year.
   Nearly 90 percent of the Soviets surveyed _ compared with 47
percent of the Americans _ said they had taken a course devoted
entirely to geography.
   Only about a third of the Americans and Soviets located Vietnam,
and only about 25 percent in each country pinpointed the Persian
Gulf. About 40 percent of the Soviets didn't recognize the Pacific
Ocean, confusing it with the Atlantic or Indian Ocean.
   After the Soviet Union, the United States was the next most
recognized country among the Soviets surveyed. Sixty-six percent of
Soviets correctly located the United States. Three-quarters of the
Americans recognized the Soviet Union, but fewer than half could
find Japan.
   West Germany was identified by only about 40 percent of the
Soviets and 30 percent of the Americans surveyed. However, 94
percent of the West Germans identified the Soviet Union, compared
with 88 percent identifying their own country.

<TEXT>
   Federal savings and loan regulator M. Danny Wall
warned industry executives Wednesday that an ``arranged marriage''
with a merger partner might be the only way to prevent a weak
institution from closing.
   ``Thrifts that are undercapitalized are in very grave jeopardy.
Understand that,'' Wall told 3,600 delegates at the 97th annual
convention of the U.S. League of Saving Institutions, the industry's
largest trade group.
   Wall, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, was the
closing speaker at the four-day meeting, the first major gathering
of S&amp;L executives since the Aug. 9 enactment of thrift bailout
legislation.
   In his speech, Wall didn't mention the controversy swirling
around his agency's handling of the failure of Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., expected to cost taxpayers as
much as $2 billion.
   However, at a news conference, he defended his decision to delay
seizure of Lincoln by nearly two years, saying he was legally
required to keep it open unless it was insolvent. The staff of the
House Banking Committee contends that Wall needed to determine only
that Lincoln was operating unsafely and dissipating its assets.
   ``We were advised at the time we did not have the (legal) basis
(to seize Lincoln). It was the best advice we could find,'' he said.
   On Monday, Wall's agency issued new regulations requiring S&amp;L
owners to back their lending with more of their own capital.
   The rules, required under the S&amp;L bill, are designed to provide a
larger buffer of private money between S&amp;L losses and government
deposit insurance funds.
   The thrift office estimates that about 800 of the nation's 2,600
solvent S&amp;Ls will fall nearly $20 billion short of the new standard.
Regulators have identified 223 of those S&amp;Ls as likely candidates
for government takeover. Many of the others will be able to meet the
requirements by shrinking their balance sheets or retaining profits,
Wall said.
   The rest, about 300, ``must consider a merger or the reality of
being acquired,'' Wall said, warning weak thrifts not to be too
choosy about suitors.
   Thrifts not meeting capital standards by the end of 1994 face
closure. In the meantime, the thrift office will launch a vigorous
``matchmaker'' program, starting with a national conference next
week, to help weak S&amp;Ls merge with stonger partners without
government assistance.
   ``We are calling this our arranged marriage program,'' Wall said,
citing recent interest by Canadian and Japanese companies as
evidence of the thrift industry's positive outlook.
   ``The worst is really over,'' he said. ``We have been through the
fire and emerged tempered by the experience.''
   Meanwhile, the new chairman of the league said Wednesday that the
S&amp;L legislation may too narrowly limit thrift institutions to
housing loans.
   ``While I consider myself first a housing lender, I also want to
help meet other community lending needs, and I fear that (the S&amp;L
bill) will restrict my ability to fulfill that role,'' said Chairman
Kenneth D. Seaton.
   During congressional debate on the bill, the trade association
lobbied for the preservation of its business by arguing that the
United States needs a separate mortgage finance system. As a result,
Congress adopted a provision that will require thrifts by July 1991
to devote 70 percent of their assets to home financing, up from 60
percent currently.
   Industry critics charge S&amp;Ls got in trouble in part because they
left their traditional business and risked depositors' money on
speculative commercial real estate projects and other types of
ventures they weren't familiar with.

   Phylicia Rashad, supermom Claire Huxtable on
``The Cosby Show,'' steps out of that role and takes a cue from
sister Debbie Allen in the Walt Disney TV movie remake of
``Pollyanna.''
   ``There are no disadvantages to working with my sister,'' Mrs.
Rashad said of working in the NBC-TV movie ``Polly'' airing Sunday.
Miss Allen of ``Fame'' directed ``Polly.''
   ``She knows me so well, she knows how far she can stretch me. She
knows that I can go far beyond where some people think I can go,''
Mrs. Rashad said. ``She doesn't look at me as the actress who plays
Claire Huxtable. That's not her point of origin for me.''
   Mrs. Rashad plays the disciplinarian aunt in the musical
recreation of the 1960 classic. ``Cosby'' co-star Keshia Knight
Pulliam stars as the unflappable orphan sent to live with her aunt
in a turn-of-the-century Alabama town.
   ``The main focus is still how this little girl touches the lives
of all those around her. The message is still that love is the
answer,'' Mrs. Rashad said.

   L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia celebrated a razor-thin
breakthrough as the nation's first elected black governor today, but
his Republican opponent declared his intention to seek a recount of
the vote. David Dinkins was elected New York City's first black
mayor and said voters had responded ``with the voice of hope, here
and in Virginia.''
   Republican J. Marshall Coleman called a news conference to
announce that if the official tally in Virginia shows the candidates
separated by less than one half of one percent of the vote _ a
certainty based on unofficial figures _ ``It is my intention to ask
for a recount.''
   ``Let me first say that I congratulate Doug Wilder on a
hard-fought campaign and if he is certified the winner he will have
my full support,'' Coleman told reporters at his Northern Virginia
campaign headquarters.
   He said ``for the good of the new governor'' it is necessary that
the public have complete confidence in the results.
   Coleman said he expected the official vote tally to be available
in five days.
   The unofficial count showed the two candidates separated by 5,200
votes out of a total of 1.78 million cast.
   Wilder credited the volatile politics of abortion with being a
major factor in his victory and dismissed suggestions that race was
a factor in the narrowness of his margin _ a plurality still
questioned by his Republican opponent.
   ``I'm saying it (race) is not and was not a factor in the results
because I was elected,'' Wilder told a morning-after news conference
in Richmond, Va. Nonetheless, Wilder ran well behind the other two
Democratic candidates for statewide office.
   The turnout of pro-choice voters powered an Election Day
nightmare for Republicans that extended to New Jersey, where
Democratic Rep. James Florio reclaimed the governorship for his
party and the Democrats regained control of the Assembly.
   ``It's a very tough day for Republicans,'' said Rep. Newt
Gingrich, the Republican House whip.
   ``Wait 'til next year,'' President Bush said when asked by
reporters about the election results as he met with Republican
congressional leaders.
   As significant as the shift in abortion-voting sentiment was the
extension of black political success in America's large city halls.
Led by Dinkins, blacks also succeeded white mayors in Seattle,
Cleveland, New Haven, Conn., and Durham, N.C.
   ``It's a good day for Americans,'' Gingrich told CBS, ``when
young blacks and other folks all over the country can look at a
Mayor Dinkins, a Gov. Wilder and say there is a future in America if
you work hard and learn your trade.''
   The main event of the day was in Virginia, where Republican J.
Marshall Coleman trailed Wilder by 7,700 votes of more than 1.7
million cast in the unofficial, final vote count. With all precincts
counted, Wilder had 889,869 votes or 50 percent and Coleman had
882,137 votes or 50 percent.
   Wilder claimed victory, telling jubilant supporters in the
capital of the old Confederacy, ``The people of Virginia have
spoken.'' Coleman did not concede, saying, ``The race is not yet
over,'' and he would await a final, official count.
   Wilder said the race was particularily close because of a high
turnout in Virginia, and told ABC, ``Notwithstanding that turnout, I
still emerged with the majority of votes. I'm tickled pink.''
   He called his election ``an excellent testimony to the people of
Virginia, to the people of this nation, as to how far we've come in
a very short time.''
   Both the Virginia and New York races were far closer than
pre-election polls had indicated, in keeping with previous campaigns
in which black politicians drew fewer votes than predicted by
traditional polling methods.
   Dinkins, like Wilder, waged a soft-spoken campaign that dwelled
not at all on race. He replaces the often acerbic Ed Koch and will
surely bring a new style of leadership to Gracie Mansion.
   ``This year voters rejected the calls of fear and voted with the
voice of hope, here and in Virginia,'' Dinkins said in victory. ``We
passed another milestone on freedom's road.''
   With 99 percent of precincts counted, Dinkins had 898,534 votes
or 50 percent, Giuliani had 856,448 votes or 48 percent, and two
minor party candidates divided the remainder.
   Republican Party chairman Lee Atwater offered the opposition a
grudging tip of his hat.
   ``These were local contests in which the Democrats outcampaigned
us and ran better campaigns,'' said Atwater. ``My hat's off to them,
but I don't think it makes much difference at all with regards to
the 1990 campaign.''
   Democratic Party chairman Ronald H. Brown saw things differently.
   He called the results ``a tremendously positive sign for us as we
move into the '90s. It gives us tremendous momentum heading into
1990,'' when 36 governorships, 34 Senate seats and all 435 seats in
the House are at stake.
   A sweep of the governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey would
give the Democrats 29 of the 50 governorships.
   The contest to fill the U.S. House seat made vacant by the death
of Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, in a plane crash in Ethiopia last
summer was headed for a runoff between two Democrats, state Sen.
Craig Washington and Houston City Councilman Anthony Hall.
   Most of Tuesday's action was in the nation's cities.
   Coleman Young, 71, won an unprecedented fifth term as mayor of
Detroit, defeating 40-year-old Tom Barrow. Other mayors re-elected
included Xavier Suarez of Miami, who won a third term, and Kathy
Whitmire, who coasted to a fifth in Houston.
   Democrat John Daniels was elected mayor of New Haven, becoming
the first black mayor of his majority-white city, while in Seattle,
City Councilman Norm Rice defeated busing foe Doug Jewett to gain a
similar distinction.
   Ohio state Sen. Michael R. White defeated his old mentor, City
Council President George Forbes, in a bitter contest between two
black Democrats to succeed retiring Republican Mayor George
Voinovich.
   The nasty tone in Cleveland was all too typical of the year's
campaigns.
   Giuliani, a 45-year-old former U.S. attorney, was unrelenting in
his attacks on Dinkins, calling the Manhattan borough president
``unfit'' for the office of mayor. But once the outcome was
determined, Giuliani called on New Yorkers to unite behind the new
mayor with ``every prayer.''
   In New Jersey, Florio trounced Republican Rep. James Courter to
win a governorship held by Republican Thomas Kean the past eight
years. Courter never recovered from criticism suffered when he tried
to moderate his strong anti-abortion position.
   With 99 percent of the New Jersey precincts counted, Florio _ who
twice before lost gubernatorial races _ had 1,356,957 or 62 percent.
Rep. James Courter had 824,505 or 38 percent.
   It was Florio's third try for the office and he defeated Courter
by a margin of 500,000 votes out of about 3 million cast. The two
candidates bombarded voters with negative commercials.
   Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League, said Tuesday's results proved that the recent
Supreme Court decision opening the way for states to restrict access
to abortion had energized pro-choice voters and that ``politics in
America would never be the same.''
   She contended that in the Virginia governor's race, ``the issue
of a woman's right to choose was so powerful it overcame all other
issues.''
   Nancy E. Myers, spokeswoman for the National Right to Life
Committee, criticized Republicans, such as Courter and Coleman, who
tried to temper their prior opposition to abortion.
   ``Courter turned off pro-life voters,'' she said.
   As for Coleman, she said, ``He probably could have handled the
issue a lot better. He could have come out a lot earlier attacking
Wilder.''
   Prominent black politicians hailed the results in Virginia and
New York.
   ``If Wilder can win in Virginia, the cradle of the Confederacy,
black and other candidates of a new breed can win in Georgia, in
Mississippi, in Alabama and elsewhere in the South,'' said Rep. John
Lewis, D-Ga.
   ``There have always been Doug Wilders in the African-American
community,'' said Rep. Bill Gray, D-Pa., the assistant House
majority leader. ``What is changed is that now the white community
is looking beyond skin. They are looking at character and policy and
leadership.''

<HEAD>House Panel Hears Computer Virus Testimony</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ A computer security specialist estimated Wednesday
that there have been up to hundreds of thousands of computer virus
attacks against American corporations and the government in recent
years.
   Carolyn Conn, an official of the EDP Auditors Association, told a
House panel that the majority of incidents go unreported ``because
there is not a high expectation of successful prosecution.''
   Also, she said, ``organizations do not want to publicize their
vulnerabilities when seemingly there is little or no benefit'' from
public disclosure.
   ``The costs are staggering,'' Ms. Conn told the House Judiciary
subcommittee on criminal justice. ``Viruses have cost corporations,
government agencies and educational institutions millions of dollars
to prevent, detect and recover from computer virus attacks.''
   The panel's chairman, Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., asked her
for a estimate of the overall number of virus attacks that have
occurred in recent years.
   ``Is it tens, is it hundreds, is it thousands?'' he asked.
   Ms. Conn responded: ``I think probably in the hundreds of
thousands.''
   The EDP Auditors Association is a 9,000-member group of
electronic data processing professionals based in Carol Stream,
Ill., a Chicago suburb.
   At the same hearing, the head of another computer industry
association urged Congress to take a cautious approach toward
legislation intended to help fight viruses and other software
threats.
   ``Like the swine flu vaccine of the 1970s, these anti-virus bills
could end up doing more harm than good,'' said John L. Pickitt,
president of the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers
Association.
   Pickitt criticized three anti-virus bills whose chief sponsors
are Reps. Wally Herger, R-Calif., C. Thomas McMillen, D-Md., and
Edward J. Markey, D-Mass.
   ``Outlawing some of the programming techniques used to create
computer viruses might prevent the use of similar programs for
beneficial purposes, including countering a virus,'' said Pickitt,
chief of CBEMA, a Washington-based trade association whose member
companies had combined sales last year of more than $230 billion.
   Herger's bill would impose penalties of up to 20 years in prison
on people convicted of ``interfering with the operations of
computers through the use of programs containing hidden commands
that can cause harm.''
   The McMillen measure would punish anyone who ``willfully and
knowingly sabotages the proper operation of a computer hardware
system or the associated software.'' Markey's bill would make the
introduction of a computer virus into an interstate electronic
network a federal crime.
   Computer viruses generally are small strings of computer code
that can ``infect'' legitimate computer programs and may cause
destruction or alteration of data files.

   Democrat L. Douglas Wilder claimed a
hairbreadth victory that would make him the nation's first elected
black governor, but Republican J. Marshall Coleman refused to
concede said he would demand a recount.
   Fewer than 8,000 votes out of 1.7 million cast separated the two
candidates in the unofficial returns from Tuesday's election, which
saw the largest voter turnout for a statewide election in Virginia
history.
   Reports from the state's 1,967 precincts gave Wilder 889,869
votes to 882,137 for Coleman.
   Coleman called a news conference today to announce that he would
ask for a recount if the official tally shows the candidates
separated by less than one half of one percent of the votes _ a
certainty based on the unofficial figures.
   ``Let me first say that I congratulate Doug Wilder on a
hard-fought campaign and if he is certified the winner he will have
my full support,'' Coleman told reporters at his Northern Virginia
campaign headquarters.
   However, he said that ``for the good of the new governor,'' it is
necessary that the public have complete confidence in the results.
   Wilder, who also held a news conference today, dismissed a
suggestion that the racial factor threw his election into doubt
while his white running mates for lieutenant governor and attorney
general won substantial victories.
   ``I'm saying it is not and was not a factor in the results
because I was elected,'' Wilder said.
   Earlier, he said on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that his vote
totals were a sign of the gains made by blacks in America.
   ``It's an excellent testament to the people of Virginia, to the
people of this nation, as to how far we've come in a very short span
of time,'' the 58-year-old lieutenant governor said.
   ``The people of Virginia have spoken,'' Wilder told supporters
Tuesday night at a jubilant rally. ``Whatever it takes, that's what
I want to win by.''
   But Coleman, a 47-year-old former attorney general, did not
accept defeat.
   ``This race is not yet over,'' he told supporters. ``We don't yet
know what the outcome is.''
   ``This governor's race is too close to call,'' said Donald
Huffman, chairman of the state Republican Party. ``This is a race
that's going to be recounted. All we ask for is a fair and honest
counting of the ballots.''
   The difference between the candidates' totals was well within the
1 percent separation required for a recount, and possibly within the
half a percent margin that allows the apparent loser to seek a
recount without risk of having to pay for it if results are
unchanged.
   The State Board of Elections will meet Nov. 27 to certify the
results. Coleman then would have 10 days _ until Dec. 7 _ to request
a recount. There is no timetable in state law for completing a
recount.
   Observers could not recall a closer gubernatorial race, and the
65 percent of the 2.5 million registered voters who turned out also
appeared to set a record.
   Wilder campaigned as the heir to two successive Democratic
administrations headed by Charles S. Robb, now a U.S. senator, and
Gov. Gerald L. Baliles, who could not succeed himself under Virginia
law.
   He noted that 80 percent of the Virginia electorate is white and
cited this as evidence that race had not been a factor in the
election.
   ``Instead of letting race be a factor they decided the reverse,''
he said. ``They believed in me notwithstanding accident of birth,
class or any other demarcation.''
   Coleman, who lost the 1981 race for governor to Robb, said
Virginians wanted a change and pointed to five tax increases in four
years under Baliles.
   But the leading issues in the campaign were abortion and
questions about the moral character of the candidates.
   Wilder took a strong pro-choice stand and charged that Coleman,
who opposed abortion except to save the life of the woman, wanted to
set back the clock on women's rights.
   Wilder blasted Coleman for accepting huge contributions from
northern Virginia real estate developers _ although Wilder himself
had wealthy backers, among them John W. Kluge, whom Forbes Magazine
identified as the richest man in America.
   Campaign reports filed by the candidates showed that Wilder had
raised $6.46 million and Coleman $8.05 million in the third most
expensive gubernatorial election in the nation's history, including
the sums spent during primaries.
   Jack W. Gravely, president of the state chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said that if
Wilder's victory stands it would inspire hope among the nation's
blacks.
   ``But I do not think that one night in this state can erase years
of degradation and segregation,'' Gravely said.
   Wilder, a millionaire lawyer, grew up in Richmond in what he
described as ``gentle poverty.'' He earned money for college by
waiting on tables at whites-only political dinners in downtown
Richmond, and became the first black to sit in the Virginia Senate
since Reconstruction.
   Coleman, a Shenandoah Valley native who has practiced law in the
Washington, D.C. suburbs for eight years, has been out of office
since the loss to Robb. A moderate in the state GOP, he was
discouraged from running in the 1985 lieutenant governor's race by
party conservatives.
   The Republican Party registered a net gain of four seats in the
state House of Delegates, a result that left Democrats with a 59-39
majority.

   Prehistoric humans may have raided the
nearest pond when they got a hankering for leftover mastodon.
   Daniel Fisher of the University of Michigan said evidence he's
uncovered at a pond in south-central Michigan indicates prehistoric
humans would make a bag from part of a mastodon's digestive tract
and fill it with sand and gravel, making an anchor for the meat.
   ``This is the first physical evidence documenting its use in
prehistoric times,'' he said.
   Fisher on Wednesday presented the results of his work to a
meeting of the Geological Society of America in St. Louis.
   The Heisler site contains remains of a mastodon which died about
11,000 years ago. The remains are in clusters, some of which are
surrounded by gravel and sand.
   ``Our working hypothesis is that the mastodon was killed some
distance from the pond,'' Fisher said. ``Hunters would have quickly
butchered the animal into manageable sections.
   ``Large portions of bone, meat and fat were then apparently
carried to the pond, submerged and marked with posts shoved
vertically into the pond bottom. After that, the kill site may have
been abandoned to scavengers.''

   The newest combo at Carl's Jr. restaurants
features fast food and instant money. With one stop, you can get a
burger, fries and 40 bucks.
   Carl's Jr. patrons soon will be able to pay for their food with
automatic teller machine cards, officials of the fast-food company
announced Tuesday.
   Four hundred Carl's in California will be outfitted with ATM
machines, said Bob Altman, vice president for management information
systems at Carl Karcher Enterprises headquarters here.
   The network will allow customers to pay for their food and
withdraw up to $40 in cash for a 10-cent service charge.
   The machines will accept bank cards from Wells Fargo, Bank of
America, Security Pacific and First Interstate. Company officials
believe the cards will be used by about 5 percent to 7 percent of
their customers.
   Company officials said they hope to expand the system to all
their restaurants in the Wwestern states by the end of next year.
   McDonald's, Arby's, Domino's Pizza and Wendy's International are
testing their own ATM systems, but have yet to implement programs
companywide.

<HEAD>Autopsy Pending in Death of Jill Ireland's Adopted Son</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Jill Ireland often spoke publicly of
her struggle to save her adopted son from his heroin addiction,
saying the battle was more traumatic than the cancer she's suffered
since 1984.
   Now, Jason McCallum Bronson, 27, is dead of unknown causes. His
body was found Tuesday in his Hollywood Hills home.
   ``We are awaiting the coroner's results, but at this time the
case is not being handled by homicide detectives,'' police spokesman
Bill Frio said Wednesday.
   An autopsy was scheduled for Thursday, although toxicology
results likely would take longer, said Bob Dambacher, a spokesman
for the Los Angeles County Coroner's office.
   Miss Ireland recounted Jason's addiction in ``Life Lines,'' a
1989 autobiography.
   ``I knew I wanted to write about Jason, about adoption, about
DNA,'' she has said. ``When you adopt a child, the birth mother is
never out of the picture. I thought I had adopted the child of a
married architect and a young Irish girl. Instead I had adopted a
drug addict's child.''
   Miss Ireland's publicist, Lori Jonas, did not immediately return
telephone calls Wednesday and a call to husband Charles Bronson's
publicist was referred to Ms. Jonas.
   The actress adopted Jason while she was married to David
McCallum, who was perhaps best known for his role as agent Illya
Kuryakin in the 1960s television series ``The Man From U.N.C.L.E.''
   Miss Ireland and McCallum were divorced in 1967, and she married
Bronson a year later. Jason is one of seven children they raised.
   Miss Ireland termed the battle to save her son from drugs a
greater trauma than her breast cancer, saying in one interview: ``I
can never forget the horror of learning Jason was an addict.''
   Five years ago, the 54-year-old actress lost her right breast to
cancer, and a year ago learned that the disease had spread to her
lungs. Since the discovery of the new cancer, she has been
undergoing treatment.
   As recently as last month, Miss Ireland said, ``Jason is still
fighting his demons.''
   Jason made numerous unsuccessful attempts at drug rehabilitation
but said in April that he had been clean for two months after
spending one month in a recovery program.
   ``I just hope, in the end, it can help somebody,'' Jason said
about his mother's book.

   An electoral aftershock to the San Francisco earthquake wrecked
plans for a new home for the baseball Giants, while voters concerned
with less seismic matters dealt blows to gay rights, pay raises for
Texas lawmakers and money for schools in Michigan and Washington.
   ``The Giants and their fans now face an uncertain future,''
Giants' owner Bob Lurie said after San Francisco voters Tuesday
narrowly defeated a plan to build a new waterfront stadium to
replace windswept Candlestick Park.
   The same voters also rejected a ``domestic partners'' proposal
that would give unmarried municipal workers, both heterosexual and
homosexual, the same funeral and sick benefits as married couples.
   And in Irvine, Calif., voters reversed an ordinance protecting
homosexuals against discrimination. Mayor Larry Agran called the
reversal on discrimination ``mean-spirited.''
   But Michael Shea, a leader of the Irvine Values Coalition, said,
``special protection for homosexuals is something we're not prepared
to give at this point.''
   The Oakland suburb of Concord repealed an ordinance banning
discrimination in housing and employment against AIDS victims. It
was the first time a community held a referendum on ending
discrimination against people with AIDS or the virus that causes it.
   Among the winners in Tuesday voting on local and statewide
propositions were smoking curbs in tobacco country, tax money to
help Utah lure the Winter Olympics, higher taxes to fight drug wars
in Kansas City, more prisons for Texas and a new government for New
York City.
   The San Francisco stadium vote left more questions than answers,
but Lurie was adamant about one thing. ``Candlestick Park cannot
stand as a longterm home to the Giants,'' the owner of the National
League champions said.
   He said the team would play the 1990 season at the reviled
29-year-old stadium. Where the Giants would play after that was open
to question. Lurie said he would move the team, possibly to San Jose
or Sacramento, unless a new $115 million downtown stadium was built.
   Candlestick suffered minimal damage in the Oct. 17 earthquake,
but blueprints for the proposed downtown stadium were less
fortunate. Opponents of the new park said it was no time for the
quake-damaged city to spend money on such a project.
   The stadium question was fiercely contested, falling 1,977 votes
short of passage out of 171,487 votes cast.
   But the Giants didn't strike out completely. Voters in Scottdale,
Ariz., approved $8.4 million to build a new stadium and keep the
Giants from moving their spring training site to Florida.
   The new stadium will hold 7,000 fans, about 1,800 more than the
current park holds.
   Utah voters also supported athletes, approving $56 million for
ski jumps, bobsled-luge runs and skating rinks that could lure the
1998 Olympic Winter Games to their state.
   Kansas City, Mo., area voters approved a quarter-cent increase in
the sales tax to raise $98 million during the next seven years to
fight the war on drugs. The measure passed 60 percent to 40 percent.
   But voters gave thumbs down to tax hikes for education in
Michigan and Washington. Michigan's electorate rejected two
proposals to increase the state sales tax to generate $400 million
for schools.
   Washington state voters soundly rejected a ``Children's
Initiative'' to hike the sales tax by nearly a penny per dollar to
help raise at least $360 million a year for smaller school classes,
early childhood education, child-abuse and drug education. The
measure failed by a 70-to-30 percent margin.
   Elsewhere, St. Louis voters rejected a four-cent property tax
increase to subsidize the St. Louis Symphony.
   The closest vote involved limiting smoking in some public places
in Greensboro, N.C., where the tobacco giant Lorillard Inc. employs
2,000 workers and more than half the city's registered voters smoke.
   By only 173 votes of 29,809 votes cast, the electorate banned
smoking in elevators and certain stores while requiring restaurants
seating more than 50 people to set aside a quarter of their seats
for non-smokers. The measure passed, 14,991 to 14,818.
   ``I don't think it's going to cost you any jobs,'' said David
Hudgins, spokesman for Greensboro to Alleviate Smoking Pollution.
``It's just going to give everybody a place of quiet enjoyment to go
out and be happy together and get along.''
   In Texas, the proposal to triple the current $7,200 salary of
state lawmakers to $23,300 went down by more than 2-to-1. A proposal
to boost the expense allowance from $30 to $81 also was rejected.
   But Texans, who had 21 ballot proposals to determine, favored the
dropping of a 113-year-old provision requiring state office-holders
to swear they didn't bribe their way into their positions. The vote
was 2-to-1 to drop it.
   A $500 million water measure to bring running water and sewers to
disease-ridden border towns was approved. So was a proposal to spend
$400 million on new prisons to ease overcrowding.
   New York City voters approved the most fundamental revision of
the City Charter this century by passing a plan that gives the mayor
more power, boosts the size of City Council from 35 to 51 members
and abolishes the Board of Estimate. The measure passed 56 percent
to 44 percent.
   Maine voters endorsed a non-binding ban on the Navy's testing of
Tomahawk cruise missiles over the state. The missiles are launched
from submarines off the coast and fly as low as 500 feet off the
ground.
   Maine voters also approved a contingency contract to dispose of
low-level nuclear wastes in Beatty, Nev.

   Communist leader Egon Krenz faces
growing troubles as confusion spreads among East Germans who are
tempted to join their friends and families heading West, experts and
politicians said Wednesday.
   ``The Communist Party is fighting for its life like a drowning
man,'' said an East Berliner walking past the party's Central
Committee headquarters on Unterwassertrasse 10 _ No. 10 Under Water
Street.
   Krenz, after just three weeks as Communist Party chief, threw out
the aging Politburo on Wednesday and replaced the ruling body with
reform proponents. But some said Krenz himself could be ousted
unless he seizes the initiative.
   The conservative West German newspaper Die Welt compared Krenz
and his men with the crew of a sinking ship.
   ``Water is breaking in everywhere through the rotting planks,''
the newspaper said in an editorial. ``They are grasping at
everything to stop the leaks.''
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, the leader of the West German leftist
opposition Social Democrats, stressed the urgent need for democratic
reforms.
   ``A German Democratic Republic that is bleeding to death, whose
supply system is breaking down and whose economy is failing won't be
able to reform at all,'' Vogel told Parliament. ``It will sink into
lethargy or even chaos.''
   There were questions about whether the Politburo shakeup would be
enough to keep East Germany from veering out of control, especially
since Krenz has insisted the Communist Party keep its leading role
in society.
   ``Just changing a few faces is not enough,'' said Volker Ruehe,
the general secretary of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democratic Party. ``The new politics has to take into account what
the people of (East Germany) want _ and that is an end to the
Communist Party's monopoly on power.''
   Backed by the United States, West Germany and other countries,
the opposition has called for free elections.
   A leader of an East German political party allied with the
Communists demanded a constitutional change to revoke the
Communists' monopoly on power and urged free elections.
   ``We have seen that the current constitutional basis can't
protect the country from instability,'' said Liberal Democratic
Party vice chairman Hans-Dieter Raspe.
   Another allied party, the National Democrats, demanded Krenz give
``proof of ability to lead.''
   Krenz, hounded by a lack of support among East Germans, has
become a target of ridicule among the hundreds of thousands of
people who have taken to the streets to demand democracy.
   ``Grandmother, why do you have such long teeth?'' read one
placard at Saturday's million-strong demonstration in East Berlin _
with a leering, grinning Krenz replacing the wolf of the Little Red
Riding Hood fairy tale.
   Most East Germans watch West German TV, which has given ample
coverage to the democratic changes sweeping Poland and Hungary.
   ``Krenz just doesn't enjoy any trust,'' said Christian Schreiber,
an East Berlin dental technician who joined one of Europe's largest
single post-war migrations by fleeing to Bavaria with his wife and
child last weekend.
   As the number of refugees approaches 200,000, there is growing
confusion for those left behind.
   There is ``mental chaos'' as ordinary East Germans are torn
between staying and fleeing to the West, said Josef Janning of the
University of Mainz.
   ``The East Germans are confused about their identity,'' Janning
said. The life they were accustomed to ``is breaking down'' with
every departure.
   ``Suddenly they are forced to make a decision: Do I head to the
West or don't I?'' Janning said. ``It's one thing to dream about how
nice it would be to visit the West and live there. It's another to
be asked by your own children, `Do we go or do we stay?'''
   For ordinary East Germans, there are the daily inconveniences of
stores shut down because workers have fled, and the anxiety of
knowing that the flight to the West has stripped the country of
hundreds of its doctors and nurses. Opposition leaders note the
country is losing the equivalent of a village every day as East
Germans turn their backs on the Communist system.
   ``The people of East Germany have unmistakably shown they won't
be satisfied with cosmetic improvements,'' said Dorothee Wilms, the
Bonn cabinet minister in charge of relations between the two German
nations.
   Janning said ``Krenz is not a reform type,'' and warned that the
new leader could be ousted within months if he fails to seize the
initiative.
   Klaus Boelling, the former head of Bonn's diplomatic mission in
East Berlin, said the Politburo resignations were a sign of ``total
helplessness and powerlessness'' and predicted they would fail to
stabilize the growing crisis.
   ``I urgently wish that Krenz, in the interest of millions of East
Germans, would realize that he doesn't enjoy confidence at all in
his own country,'' Boelling told Saarland state radio.

   The Treasury began to replenish its coffers
Wednesday after last-minute congressional action raising the debt
limit averted the government's first-ever default.
   The Treasury sold $16 billion in three- and six-month bills in
its weekly auction that was postponed on Monday because the
government's borrowing authority had dropped to $2.8 trillion, a
level its debt already surpassed.
   The drop also forced postponement of $40 billion in quarterly
refunding auctions and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said the
government would default if Congress failed to act by midnight
Tuesday.
   Without congressional action, the Treasury would have been unable
to redeem $13.8 billion in bills that mature Thursday.
   Congress approved legislation shortly before the midnight
deadline raising the debt ceiling to $3.1 trillion for the fiscal
year ending next Sept. 30. President Bush signed the bill Wednesday
morning and the Treasury rescheduled its auctions, starting with the
short-term bill offering that afternoon.
   The Treasury on Wednesday also resumed sales of U.S. savings
bonds and special securities for state and local governments, the
temporary investment vehicles for money those governments raise in
the bond market, that had been suspended.
   The Treasury said the newly scheduled quarterly refunding will
include auctions of $10 billion in three-year notes on Thursday, $10
billion in 10-year notes next Monday and $10 billion in 30-year
bonds next Tuesday. The Treasury also said it would reoffer $10
billion in 36-day cash management bills on Friday.
   In addition to the note auction, the Treasury plans to hold its
regular weekly auction for $16 billion in three- and six-month bills
next Monday.
   In Wednesday's auction, interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell to their lowest level since last month.
   The Treasury Department sold $8 billion in three-month bills at
an average discount rate of 7.67 percent, down from 7.78 percent
last week. Another $8 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.49 percent, down from 7.62 percent last
week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.52
percent on Oct. 23, and six-month bills averaged 7.42 percent on
Oct. 16.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.93 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,806.10 and 7.89 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,621.30.
   The debt limit fell from $2.87 trillion to $2.8 trillion on Oct.
31 after Senate action raising the ceiling became stalled over
Republican demands that the legislation also include a capital gains
tax cut. That demand was subsequently dropped.
   Although the U.S. government had never defaulted on its debt
before, it came close on several occasions.
   For example, it had to dip into Social Security funds to keep its
line of credit open in 1985. And in 1983, a delay in increasing the
debt limit forced the government to exhaust its line of credit,
leading to a suspension of savings bond sales, restrictions on
deposits to the Social Security funds and cancellation of scheduled
securities auctions.
   The national debt has more than tripled since the beginning of
the decade as the Treasury was forced to borrrow more and more money
to finance government spending that exceeds tax receipts.
   The annual deficits have gone down from their peak of over $200
billion a year, but the deficit still totaled $152.1 billion in the
year ending last Sept. 30.
   The Gramm-Rudman budget law, itself passed as part of a 1985 debt
bill that put the limit above $2 trillion for the first time,
mandates that Congress and the president reduce the deficit in
fiscal 1990 to $100 billion. Fiscal 1990 began Oct. 1.

   Eugene Fodor, a virtuoso violinist who rode the
roller coaster of fame from a dazzling high of winning a medal in
the 1974 Tchaikovsky Competition to a dizzying low of a drug bust in
July, says he is on the upswing again.
   Fodor, 39, whose violin recital Saturday night in Peekskill,
north of New York City, was his first public appearance since he was
charged with drug possession and breaking into a motel room, said of
his performance:
   ``I had a feeling of freedom of expression that I can't remember
having had before to that degree. It seemed like the channels were
really open from the emotions I was feeling through to the music.''
   With the sense of starting with a clean slate, Fodor _ once
dubbed the Mick Jagger of classical music _ headed Wednesday from
New York to Iowa for a performance Saturday with the Sioux City
Symphony. From there he goes on to a three-night stint in Phoenix.
   The performances were scheduled before Fodor's run-in with the
law, and he said he is grateful no one canceled.
   ``In addition, I've gotten some additional engagements because
people want to hear the new me,'' he said in a telephone interview
Tuesday from his Manhattan home.
   An Edgartown, Mass., judge placed the musician on three years'
probation last month as part of a plea arrangement in which drug
charges were dropped and Fodor pleaded guilty to breaking and
entering a motel July 27 on Martha's Vineyard.
   Fodor spent 28 days in a drug rehabilitation center in New York
state, and under the terms of the probation he is to continue drug
treatment and submit to random testing.
   After the bust, many who knew the flamboyant violinist said he
had trouble coping with his stalled career after such a splashy
start. Fodor's winning the silver medal at the Tchaikovsky
Competition at age 24 _ no gold was awarded that year _ made him the
first American prize winner in that prestigious competition since
Van Cliburn took the gold in piano in 1958.
   The post-Tchaikovsky Prize publicity painted the Denver-born
violinist as an atypical classical musician, a young all-American
Western male who grew up on a ranch and loved to ride, jog and swim.
   ``I had a lot of publicity that wasn't of a very serious nature,
which created an image that I wasn't serious, which is not the
truth,'' he said.
   For the first few years there were whirlwind engagements and
television appearances, then his popularity began to wane. Critics
accused him of playing only showy crowd-pleasing selections and said
he lacked musical maturity.
   Fodor said he feels better about his music now than in 1974.
``What other artists are doing in comparison with what I'm doing is
not an issue with me any more. I'm grateful for what I have. I'm
grateful to be alive.''
   He said he remembers everything leading up to his arrest. ``I
never blacked out. I went to Martha's Vineyard to ride my bicycle. I
stopped at 11 at night. I couldn't summon the clerk at the motel. I
rang the buzzer repeatedly. I walked in. The first room I came to
wasn't locked.
   ``I think it was divine intervention the way the whole thing came
about. The maids woke me up in the morning. I could have left and
not paid and not gotten arrested. I waited one and a half hours for
the manager to get there. When she did, she had the police on the
phone. I was trying to give her money for the room. I had over $100.
   ``I had cocaine in an aspirin container. I had a chance to throw
it away. ... I wanted to go to rehab and I knew I'd never commit
myself.''
   Although authorities charged Fodor with heroin possession as well
as cocaine, Fodor said the trace of heroin they found in the back of
his car wasn't his.
   He said he used cocaine for about four months before his arrest,
and that he is shocked now when he realizes he played under the
influence of the drug at the last few concerts before his arrest.
   ``The reason I got into cocaine is because I have the disease of
addiction. I'm an extremely compulsive and obsessive person. It
served me well in learning violin and being able to master difficult
works,'' he said.
   He didn't abuse alcohol, Fodor says, because he didn't like
hangovers.
   Now, said Fodor, ``I'm willing to accept what life has to offer.
It wasn't easy getting to this place. It is so rewarding. I'm
enjoying life more every day. I really don't have any desire to have
a drink or a drug. ...
   ``The feeling is a lot better than I ever got on drugs.''

<HEAD>Wilder's Life Moves from `Gentle Poverty'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When L. Douglas Wilder was a boy, he would
get on the trolley that ran near his Church Hill home and take a
seat up front. Then his mother would make him move to the back.
   ``Her explanation would be one day this will all change,'' said
Wilder, a 58-year-old grandson of freed slaves who grew up in what
he describes as ``gentle poverty'' in segregated Richmond.
   Wilder, now a millionaire lawyer who has served the past four
years as lieutenant governor, claimed a narrow victory over
Republican J. Marshall Coleman in Tuesday's governor's race _ a
triumph that would make him the first elected black governor in U.S.
history.
   With only about 5,000 votes separating the two candidates out of
more than 1.7 million cast, Coleman refused to concede and said he
would ask for a state-financed recount.
   If Wilder is ultimately sworn in as governor, he will occupy an
Executive Mansion just blocks from the once white-only clubs where
he waited on tables at political dinners to earn money for college.
   Wilder, one of eight children, set out on a career in medicine.
He got a chemistry degree from Virginia Union University, a
predominantly black school here, but then was drafted into the Army
and sent to Korea.
   He earned a Bronze Star in the war, came home and found his job
options limited. Sensing that the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on
school integration would offer new opportunities for blacks, Wilder
entered law school at Howard University in Washington.
   After graduating, he returned to Richmond to open a law practice
and built a reputation in the 1960s as an up-and-coming criminal
trial lawyer.
   In 1969, Wilder entered politics when one of the city's two state
Senate seats became vacant. He ran for the seat against two white
opponents and won, becoming the first black in the Virginia Senate
since Reconstruction.
   As a senator, Wilder allied himself with a group of young,
moderate colleagues who were poised to challenge the body's
established conservative leaders. The alliance proved fruitful and
the moderates took control.
   Wilder advanced quickly, becoming chairman of four committees
over a 16-year career. He never faced opposition for re-election.
   But despite his insider status, Wilder occasionally took stands
that were considered militant by Virginia's political mainstream at
the time.
   He fought for years for a state holiday to honor slain civil
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., and he attacked the state
song, ``Carry Me Back to Old Virginia,'' because of lyrics that
blacks find offensive.
   The King holiday didn't become law until 1985, and only after it
was joined with a holiday paying tribute to Confederate heroes
Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. The state song was never
changed, although it is seldom sung in public.
   In 1982, Wilder threatened to run as an independent against Gov.
Charles S. Robb's hand-picked U.S. Senate candidate, Owen B.
Pickett, who had angered Wilder by paying homage to the
once-segregationist Byrd dynasty. Pickett withdrew his candidacy.
   When Wilder decided to run for lieutenant governor in 1985, he
and fellow Democrat Robb again were at odds after Robb encouraged
others in the party who were interested in the No. 2 office to run.
   None did, Wilder was nominated without opposition and political
experts said the presence of a black on the ticket spelled doom for
Democrats.
   Instead, Wilder and his ticketmates swept all three of the
state's top offices. Wilder got 52 percent of the vote against
Republican state Sen. John Chichester of Fredericksburg.
   As lieutenant governor, Wilder's chief function was to preside
over the state Senate and cast tie-breaking votes. But he also used
the office as a campaign pulpit by delivering warm welcoming remarks
to dozens of groups visiting the gallery each day the General
Assembly was in session.
   Wilder has been at odds occasionally with Democratic Gov. Gerald
L. Baliles. He opposed _ after the fact _ passage of a 1986 sales
tax increase that helped finance Baliles' $10 billion road-building
initiative.
   But Baliles, as well as Robb, stayed in Wilder's camp. And
Wilder's only serious potential opponent for the nomination for
governor, Attorney General Mary Sue Terry, decided to seek
re-election.
   Wilder ran what he described as a ``Virginia campaign'' that
emphasized his ``new mainstream'' candidacy. He steered clear of
appeals on minority issues and vowed to avoid letting race be the
focus of his effort.
   ``You and I have a responsibility to make certain that what takes
place on November 7 isn't something that should happen once in a
lifetime, but something that should be expected,'' he told an
audience of black college students last month.
   Wilder, who is divorced, has three children.

   A thirsty and hungry Abiud Upendura
stood in line for nine hours on the first day of voting in Namibia's
elections, but he still had to return Wednesday to cast his ballot.
   ``I'm OK,'' he said. ``I feel right because I want my
independence.''
   Voters again turned out in large numbers Wednesday, the second of
five days of voting for an assembly that will write a constitution
and make Namibia independent of South Africa after 74 years.
   Upendura, 22, and many others camped overnight at their places in
line or went home to sleep after failing to reach the voting booths
Tuesday, when some lines extended more than a mile. The lines were
slightly shorter Wednesday, but again the heat was sweltering.
   Helicopters are being used as mobile voting stations in some
remote areas, visiting a different village each day.
   On Tuesday, 210,053 people cast ballots _ 30 percent of the vast,
mineral-rich territory's 701,483 registered voters.
   ``Given the circumstances in this country, this is a mammoth
achievement,'' said David Venter, a spokesman for the Namibian
administration appointed by South Africa, which captured the
territory from Germany in World War I.
   South Africa had resisted U.N. efforts to get it out of Namibia
since 1966, but finally agreed to grant independence under the world
organization's supervision. No independence date has been set, but
Namibia is expected to be free by early next year.
   Despite heat in the 90s and slow-moving lines, voters turned out
in numbers almost equal to those of Tuesday, said U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard.
   He said there were scattered incidents of intimidation and
distribution of bogus pamphlets aimed at discrediting the favored
party, the South-West Africa People's Organization, which fought a
23-year bush war against South African occupation.
   A territorial official said three children were killed when a
grenade they found exploded. The territorial radio said a baby was
killed and several people injured in pushing and shoving Tuesday at
two northern polling stations.
   Eckhard said the U.N. could not confirm the death of the baby but
that a child was among three people injured in one incident.
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said in
Washington that the Bush administration was very encouraged by
initial reports that turnout was heavy and voting was proceeding
smoothly. He called on all parties to abide by election rules.
   The election focuses on whether SWAPO, which leans to the left,
will win two-thirds of the seats so it can write a constitution
without consulting other parties.
   Its chief rival is the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, a
multiracial coalition that favors a capitalist economy and was part
of the transitional government installed by South Africa.
   Seats will be allocated according to the proportion of votes
received by each of the 10 parties involved.
   Dirk Mudge, a white farmer who leads the Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance, said the South African government and news media decided
in advance that a SWAPO victory was certain.
   ``We are already fighting an uphill battle without it being made
more difficult by South African assumptions,'' he said.
   Officials said the election could be extended through a sixth
day, Sunday, but Gerhard Roux, spokesman for the transitional
government, predicted that would not be necessary.
   Election officials hope to know the outcome by Nov. 15. The
assembly is to convene one week after the results are final.

<TEXT>
   At the corner of Huntington Avenue and Francis
Street in Mission Hill, near where a pregnant woman was abducted and
shot to death, there are now few signs of the murder that outraged
the city.
   In the hours that followed the shooting of Carol Stuart and her
husband, Charles, police fanned out over this inner-city
neighborhood in droves, questioning housing project residents for
leads. But the trail of the person who shot them two weeks ago as
they left a childbirth class seems to have grown cold.
   A lone police car cruised by a package store Wednesday. A group
of teen-agers lounged on the steps of Fermoyle Drugs, across from
the intersection where it is believed the woman and her husband were
first confronted.
   ``There are all kinds of crimes that happen here,'' said Hibah
Mohamed, 23, who was walking down Huntington Avenue. ``And these
guys who live around here know how to hide very well.''
   Police and city officials are silent, after a highly conspicuous
presence in the days after the shooting. Police say they don't want
to jeopardize the case and have been told by the Suffolk County
district attorney not to talk.
   ``We're not saying anything,'' police spokesman Jim Jordan said
Wednesday. ``We don't want the investigation played out in the
papers. We probably won't say anything until there's a real break.''
   Mrs. Stuart, 30, a tax attorney from the suburb of Reading who
was seven months pregnant, was shot in the head by a gunman shortly
after she left a birthing class at a hospital near the Roxbury
section Oct. 23. She and her husband, 29, were accosted in their
car, probably while they paused at a stoplight, police said. The
gunman forced them to drive a short distance into the Mission Hill
section where he robbed and shot them.
   Stuart called police on the car's cellular telephone and, in a
dramatic 10-minute plea for help recorded by police, led them to the
car where his wife lay dying as he lapsed in and out of
consciousness.
   Mrs. Stuart died after delivering the couple's son by Caesarean
section. Charles Stuart and his son, Christopher, are at separate
hospitals in Boston. Stuart is listed in stable condition and the
infant is still in a neo-natal intensive care unit. Officials won't
comment on his condition.
   Police in Reading, the suburb 13 miles north of Boston where the
Stuarts lived, sent a detective to help Boston police with the
investigation.
   ``We are confident that they will catch up with this person,''
said Reading Lt. Bob Silva. ``People are still talking about it here
and they're still upset.''
   A 29-year-man arrested on an unrelated burglary charge a few days
after the killing was questioned as a possible suspect. Police
refused to call him an ``official'' suspect. However, he is still in
custody following acquittal on the burglary charge Tuesday because a
new charge of armed robbery was brought against him the same day.
   Residents around Mission Hill have grown skeptical.
   ``They would have caught him by now if they were going to,'' said
Michael Stewart, 18, a busboy at the Mississippi Restaurant Cafe,
which is adjacent to the stoplight where it is believed the Stuarts
were first abducted.
   Stewart said Mission Hill residents are still frightened because
of the shooting and ``everyone's pretty cautious. They're locking
their doors. But you don't see many police. There were a lot more
here when it first happened.''

   Checks totaling $420,000 were delivered Wednesday
by industrial tycoon Victor Posner to representatives of five South
Florida organizations as partial settlement of his sentence in a
tax evasion case.
   Posner pleaded no contest in September 1987 to federal income
tax evasion and U.S. District Judge Eugene P. Spellman placed him
on probation for five years and set unusual provisions requiring
him to help the homeless.
   The sentence obligated him to contribute $3 million and 5,000
hours of community service with South Florida's homeless. The
contribution was not tax deductible.
   At the offices of the U.S. Probation Service, checks were
delivered to officials of: The Lord's Place, West Palm Beach,
$80,000; The Lord's Place, Fort Lauderdale, $40,000; Covenant
House, Fort Lauderdale, $150,000; New Life Family Shelter, Miami,
$100,000; and the Junior League Transitional Housing Project,
Miami, $50,000.
   An additional $800,000 will be delivered in 1991 and 1992 to the
organizations.

<UNK>Socialist Leader Proposes Bush-Gadhafi Meeting</UNK>
<DATELINE>VALLETTA, Malta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition party leader called on the
government Wednesday to try to arrange a meeting between President
Bush and Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi during the superpower
summit off Malta next month.
   Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev are scheduled to
hold shipboard meetings off the Mediterranean island nation Dec.
2-3.
   Socialist Party leader and former Prime Minister Karmenu Mifsud
Bonnici said the government should try to arrange a Bush-Gadhafi
get-together to help ``reduce tensions between the two countries.''
   Mediterranean countries, he said, ``give a high priority to the
reduction of tension in the area and to closer relations between
the United States and Libya.''
   On Monday, Bonnici said his party will stage an anti-nuclear
demonstration during the summit that will also demand a timetable
for withdrawing foreign fleets from the Mediterranean.
   The Bush administration has said previously it was not ready to
hold talks with Libya. It said last month that Libya is still
providing funds, weapons, safe havens and training facilities to
terrorists.
   Bonnici was the prime minister in April 1986 when Malta gave
Libya advance warnings of the U.S. air raids on the Libyan cities
of Benghazi and Tripoli.
   Maltese air traffic controllers told their Libyan counterparts
that the warplanes were approaching. However, Libya apparently did
not act on the information. Then-President Reagan said the bombing
raids were intended to punish Libya for its alleged support of
international terrorism.
   The Socialists were voted out in 1986 after 16 years in power
and the conservative government of Prime Minister Eddie Fenech
Adami has loosened its ties with Libya and moved closer to the
United States and Western Europe.

<TEXT>
   A national strategy for improving
transportation in rural America was outlined Wednesday in a report
by the Agriculture Department.
   No new major federal or state spending program was recommended.
But massive cooperative efforts by government and the private
sector at all levels were urged, including a diversification of
funding and planning.
   Martin F. ``Buzz'' Fitzpatrick Jr., head of the department's
Office of Transportation, which issued the report, said the
findings and recommendations were based on regional meetings going
back two years and a national conference in Omaha, Neb., in August
1988.
   ``From the very beginning, this initiative has been a
cooperative activity involving a wide range of public and private
agencies seeking solutions to the transportation problems of rural
residents,'' he said.
   Fitzpatrick added that the report will give rural transportation
organizations a practical guide to help in planning and policy
development at national, state and local levels.
   Although no specific mode was recommended over another, the
report referred to ``passenger transportation'' generically,
meaning that it could include rail, bus or air travel, depending on
the circumstances.
   The report said cooperation between public and private sectors
``is essential if rural passenger transportation is to meet the
mobility needs of rural residents'' and that new approaches must be
found.
   In mobilizing support for rural passenger transportation, the
report said a national plan for rural communities to maintain and
expand passenger transportation should be a top priority for action.
   ``Communities are an essential source of financial and volunteer
support for rural passenger transportation providers,'' the report
said. ``Effective community participation can generate support for
continued intercity bus service and provide financial and volunteer
support for rural public providers.''
   Copies of the report, ``Reconnecting Rural America:
Recommendations for a National Strategy,'' are available from:
USDA-OT, P.O. Box 96575, Washington, D.C. 20090-6575. For more

   The Bush administration is ``greatly
concerned'' that Israel may have provided South Africa with American
technology used in a South African missile test, a U.S. official
said Wednesday.
   As a result, an Israeli request to buy six supercomputers from
the United States will be given special scrutiny, the official said
at an arms control symposium on the Eastern shore of Maryland.
   ``The request is being held because we are concerned,'' the
official said. ``We are greatly concerned Israel could have
transferred U.S. technology.''
   Questions have been raised over the years about Israel's military
ties with South Africa. The official, speaking under seminar rules
that barred further identification, acknowledged that ``the United
States does not know the extent of Israel's relationship with South
Africa.''
   But, the official said, technology used by South Africa in last
summer's missile test exceded the country's known capabilities.
   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told the cabinet last
month that Israel had not given South Africa any military technology
developed or funded by the United States.
   The denial followed a statement by President Bush that transfers
of forbidden technology were ``taboo'' and that ``it would not
enhance relations'' if Israel defied the United States to help South
Africa develop a nuclear-capable intermediate-range missile.
   NBC News had reported that Israel provided Pretoria with know-how
from Israel's canceled Lavi jet plane program, financed largely by
the United States.
   The U.S. official who spoke at the arms control symposium also
raised questions about a South African fighter plane known as the
Cheetah, saying it was ``virtually a mirror image'' of an Israeli
plane.
   Also, the official raised questions about Israel's program, known
as Aarow, that is designed to defend against ballistic missiles that
are proliferating in the Arab world.
   On a related subject, the official said the United States had not
reached a conclusion whether South Africa conducted a nuclear test
10 years ago with Israeli help.
   Earlier, another U.S. official said Poland, in a strong show of
independence, would disband four of its 13 military divisions.
Polish authorities also have notified the Soviet Union that it would
not participate in an upgrading Warsaw Pact forces, the official
said.
   Two other divisions are being placed on stand-by, which means
about 10 percent of the division troops will remain on active duty
while the remaining will be sent home. The four disbanded divisions
have about 40,000 troops.
   Poland told the Soviet Union it was taking the steps because of
economic necessity, the U.S. official said at an arms control
symposium at the Wye Plantation on the Eastern shore of Maryland.
   The official, who could not be identified under the seminar
rules, said the Soviets apparently raised no objections.
   The Soviets also are in the midst of a partial withdrawal from
Eastern Europe. Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, said last week that three tank divisions had
been pulled out in past 11 months although some new artillery had
been sent into the region.
   Poland and Hungary are showing their independence in other ways
as well, U.S. officials said. They are putting pressure on the
Soviet Union for the Warsaw Pact to reach agreement with NATO in
Vienna on a reduction of troops and non-nuclear weapons across
Europe.
   Polish and Hungarian officials are speaking out and registering
their views in the negotiations for the first time, the official
said.
   Reporting progress on a 1987 treaty to abolish U.S. and Soviet
intermediate-range nuclear missiles, officials said the Soviets had
destroyed 297 of their arsenal of 654 SS-20s. The others are due to
be scrapped over the next two years.
   The United States, keeping pace, has eliminated 486 of its 846
intermediate-range rockets covered by the treaty.
   The United States this week is installing a $38 million X-ray
device at Votkinsk, the factory where SS-20 missiles were
manufactured, to improve inspection of rail cars carrying other
still-legal missiles from the factory.

   A look at Tuesday's elections:
   GOVERNORS
   _New Jersey: Democratic Rep. James Florio overwhelmingly defeated
Republican Rep. James Courter, ending an eight-year Republican hold
on the statehouse.
   _Virginia: Democratic Lt. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder claimed a
razor-thin victory over Republican J. Marshall Coleman, a former
attorney general, but Coleman refused to concede. The two were
separated by fewer than 8,000 voters out of 1.7 million cast; a
recount is likely.
   LEGISLATURES
   _New Jersey: Democrats regained control of the Assembly, winning
at least 43 of 80 seats.
   _Virginia: Republican gained four seats in House of Delegates.
Democrats still outnumber them 59-39. Independents won two seats.

Socialist mayor.
   _Miami: The city's first Cuban-born mayor, Xavier Suarez, won a
third term, defeating former city Commissioner Armando Lacasa.
   _Minneapolis: Incumbent Donald Fraser defeated firefighter Jens
Peterson.
   _New Haven, Conn.: Democrat John Daniels, a five-term state
senator, defeated Republican Alderwoman Robie Pooley to become the
city's first black mayor.
   _New York City: Democrat David Dinkins, who beat Mayor Edward
Koch in the September primary, defeated Republican Rudolph Giuliani.
Dinkins will be the city's first black mayor.
   _Pittsburgh: Incumbent Sophie Masloff, who was appointed last
year, ran unopposed and became the first woman to be elected mayor.
   _St. Paul, Minn.: City Council President Jim Scheibel defeated
police Lt. Bob Fletcher.
   _Seattle: City Councilman Norm Rice defeated City Attorney Doug
Jewett, and will be Seattle's first black mayor.
   STATEWIDE PROPOSITIONS
   _Maine: Voters endorsed non-binding referendums calling on the
Navy to stop Tomahawk cruise missile testing over their state and
ratifying a contract to dispose of nuclear waste at a facility in
Nevada.
   _Michigan: Voters rejected two tax proposals to provide up to
$400 million in additional state funds for education.
   _Texas: Among 21 statewide propositions, voters rejected one to

   _Utah: Voters approved a referendum to spend $56 million on
building winter sports facilities to attract the 1998 Olympic Winter
Games.

million.
   CITY PROPOSITIONS
   _Concord, Calif.: Voters decided to repeal a recent ordinance
that banned discrimination against AIDS patients.
   _Greensboro, N.C.: A proposal to limit public smoking was
approved by a narrow margin.
   _Irvine, Calif.: Voters approved a measure to remove the words
``sexual orientation'' from the city's human rights ordinance, thus
ending its applicability to homosexuals.
   _New York City: A revision of the city charter to do away with
the powerful Board of Estimate, which has been declared
unconstitutional, was approved.
   _St. Louis: Voters rejected a four-cent property tax hike to help
fund the St. Louis Symphony.
   _San Francisco: Voters defeated measures to give unmarried
couples working for the city the same funeral and sick leave
benefits as married couples, and to raise $115 million for a new
stadium for the San Francisco Giants.
   _Seattle: A measure to end forced school busing and promote
educational choice trailed by a thin margin, but the vote remained

   Victories by black Democrats in municipal and
state elections signal a ``new direction for black politics'' and
will likely result in more blacks running for elected office as
moderates, several analysts said Wednesday.
   The victories ``will help set a new direction in black politics''
because black candidates were successful in many cases where the
black voting population remains a very small minority, said Linda
Williams, a fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School for
Government.
   On Tuesday, David Dinkins was elected as the first black mayor of
New York and L. Dougles Wilder was apparently elected as governor of
Virginia. If Wilder's apparent victory holds up, he will become the
nation's first black governor.
   Blacks also took control of city halls in New Haven, Conn.;
Seattle; Cleveland, and Durham, N.C. In Detroit, Coleman Young was
elected to an unprecedented fifth term as mayor.
   ``One of the first sort of practical developments I think we'll
see is more blacks taking a chance, running in places where blacks
are not the majority,'' said Williams, who specializes in race and
politics.
   She said blacks chose not to run previously under those
circumstances because they saw little likelihood of winning.
   But Williams and other analysts say the exhilaration blacks may
feel with these successes is tempered by the moderation of the
candidates and their campaigns. Some analysts argued that the
winners were forced to be moderate, almost to the exclusion of
economic and social issues more traditionally associated with black
candidates.
   Williams noted that both Wilder and Dinkins distanced themselves
from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, twice a presidential candidate.
   But Jackson dismissed attempts to ``disconnect'' himself from
Tuesday's electoral victories.
   ``If, after the '88 campaign of Dukakis, there had been an
increase in Greek registration, if you now had a Greeek chairman of
the Democratic Party and a Greek governor of Virginia and mayor of
New York and New Haven and Seattle and Cleveland, no one would be
trying to find the disconnection because the connection would be so
very apparent,'' Jackson told reporters outside the Washington
Hilton Hotel.
   ``It was clear that the (Roger) Ailes forces were going to use me
as the Willie Horton force for polarization,'' in New York, said
Jackson in a reference to George Bush's use of a black Massachusetts
murderer in what many termed a negative 1988 presidential campaign
against Michael Dukakis. Ailes is a campaign consultant.
   ``We stepped back strategically,'' Jackson said.
   ``If we're members of the same team, does it really matter who
scored the touchdown. If we're members of the same team, if we win
the championship, all of us get the ring,'' Jackson said.
   Other analysts say the elections may signal harder rather than
easier times for black politicians and their base constituency.
   ``What we're going to have is that it's going to make it much
more difficult for the black community,'' said James Turner, a
political sociologist at Cornell University.
   Turner called the victors ``clubhouse politicians'' who ``have
said they are not going to speak to the black community while they
assume their support.''
   ``These people have taken a very cautious, moderate position, a
kind of non-economic liberal position,'' Turner said.
   ``I think this could be deceiving because it has not prepared the
white electorate for the really difficult decisions,'' said Turner.
   Of political candidates who still want to run on the platform
more geared toward the poor, Williams said, ``I'm not sure that they
will see a lot of hope for that strategy.''
   ``If they (Dinkins and Wilder) couldn't have done what they did,
it really would have been a hopeless situation,'' said Williams,
also noting that many of Tuesday's victors are black politicians who
worked their way up the Democratic Party structure.
   Williams said that although both Dinkins and Wilder garnered
support from many of the whites who voted for Jackson in 1988 their
successes Tuesday ``may show him he'll have to moderate it even more
and change his campaign style.''

   Soldiers killed eight guerrillas in
northern Colombia, the army reported Wednesday, and a newspaper said
a former rebel leader who had served in Congress was convicted of
treason by former comrades.
   Meanwhile an anti-drug crusading journalist shot three times by
hitmen hired by traffickers died Wednesday from his injuries.
Interior Minister Carlos Lemmos Simmonds deplored the slaying of
World Vision TV news director Jorge Enrique Pulido, who was shot
Oct. 29 in his car in downtown Bogota.
   ``We will continue lamenting deaths such as these until we win
the war against drug traffickers,'' Simmonds said. Pulido, the 46th
journalist to be killed in Colombia since 1977, was the most recent
victim of the war that began in mid-August when the government vowed
to crack down on Colombian drug barons.
   El Tiempo said the death sentence of Braulio Herrera was
suspended and he went into exile in Moscow.
   A Defense Ministry statement said the guerrillas killed in two
battles Tuesday were from the National Liberation Army, one of six
Colombian guerrilla groups.
   It said five were killed near Bagre, a town 200 miles north of
Bogota, and three near Simiti, 230 miles north of the capital.
   Herrera was a field commander of the Colombian Revolutionary
Armed Forces guerrilla group.
   He was elected to Congress in 1986 for the Patriotic Union Party,
which guerrillas organized as part of a peace effort by Belisario
Betancur, then president of Colombia.
   For years, the guerrilla group had controlled a part of central
Colombia called the Middle Magdalena, a stretch of about 200 miles
along the Magdalena River, which runs nearly the length of Colombia.
   Paramilitary groups opposed to the guerrillas gained control of
the area during the truce with the Betancur government. The
guerrilla leadership asked Herrera to take command in the Middle
Magdalena and restore its dominance, El Tiempo said, quoting four
former guerrillas.
   Herrera had 109 combatants of a unit of about 200 guerrillas
executed on suspicion of being army spies, El Tiempo quoted the
former insurgents as saying.
   It said that practically destroyed guerrilla influence in the
area and the guerrilla high command tried Herrera for treason. El
Tiempo did not say when the trial occurred.
   According to newspaper, the former guerrillas said a group of
leftists they did not identify interceded to get the death sentence
suspended.
   The pro-Soviet Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces was organized
more than 30 years ago and is believed to have about 3,000
combatants.

<HEAD>Accident Victim May Have Taped Car Crash on Videocamera</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOLLAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man trying out his new videocamera may
have taped the head-on collision that killed him and two other
people, police said.
   A damaged videocassette taken from the wreckage of the Oct. 8
accident in Holland Township shows some footage that apparently was
shot from the car a short distance from the crash site.
Investigators are trying to salvage more of the mangled tape in the
hopes it shows the collision.
   Investigators said Jeff Scharenbroch of Hollan may have been
running his videocamera at the time the car's driver, Curtis Bender
of Holland, lost control while trying to pass a vehicle and slid
into the path of a second car, police said.
   The driver of the second car, Curtis Mobley of Holland, was
killed and his 12-year-old son, Lonnie, died a day later.
Scharenbroch, 26, died two days later from injuries. Bender, 27,
was paralzyed in the crash.
   Authorities said the tape so far has not shed new light on the
cause of the accident.
   Ottawa County Sheriff's Lt. Larry Beld said the footage stops
several hundred feet before the intersection where the accident
occurred and then goes blank.

<HEAD>Congress Clears Way to Act On Repeal Of Catastrophic Insurance Repeal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The House and Senate unanimously approved bills
repealing the catastrophic health insurance surtax Wednesday in a
parliamentary step that clears the way for conferees to work out a
final solution.
   The carefully orchestrated action was calculated to simplify the
parliamentary procedures under which the highly volatile issue will
be resolved.
   The net effect to was to leave the two houses precisely where
they have been _ substantively _ on the legislation since early
October, but to clear out legislative underbrush.
   By having a free-standing bill to work with, conferees will be
able to negotiate without the extraneous pressure _ time and
otherwise _ of having their work attached to broader legislation.
   Several conference committee members have expressed optimism they
can reach agreement by next week, clearing the way for final action
on the legislation.
   Major new parts of the original catastrophic health legislation
are to take effect Jan. 1, and Medicare officials are required by
law to notify beneficaries of those changes unless they are repealed.
   The bill passed by the House on a unanimous voice vote followed
word-for-word the language approved earlier on a 360-66 vote calling
for outright repeal of the landmark expansion of Medicare approved
last year.
   Likewise, the Senate amended the House bill with the exact
language by which it voted earlier 99-0 to repeal the surtax but
retain a small portion of benefits. The Senate action took less than
one minute to complete.
   Prior to the agreement reached by House and Senate leaders
Tuesday night to separate catastrophic health from other issues, the
rollback legislation had been attached to a giant deficit reduction
bill.
   There was an aborted attempt by the leadership of both houses on
Tuesday to push conferees to reach an agreement that could be
attached to a debt ceiling bill passed late Tuesday.
   However, conference committee members on all sides of the issue
argued that the catastrophic health issues were too complex to be
handled in such an expedited fashion.

<HEAD>Advisory Panel Casts Doubt on Cold Fusion Prospects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Claims for the discovery of a new nuclear
process called ``cold fusion'' raise some puzzling questions and are
too weak to justify special government research efforts, an Energy
Department advisory panel said Wednesday.
   The group, in a report prepared for Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins, said it found no persuasive evidence that the cold fusion
process would produce useful sources of energy.
   University of Utah scientists last March first announced they had
attained cold fusion, and the claim sparked worldwide efforts to
reproduce the phenomenon. Some laboratories have supported the Utah
claims but most have not.
   Cold fusion is the claim that the decomposition of water at room
temperature into hydrogen and oxygen by an electric current passing
through a palladium electrode leads to the absorption of hydrogen
atoms in the electrode. The atoms then fuse to produce helium and
large amounts of heat.
   If such a process could work on a large scale, it would make
possible limitless supplies of cheap energy.
   The panel, known as the Energy Research Advisory Board,
recommended to Watkins that no special funds be earmarked for
investigating cold fusion and that the government not establish
special programs or research centers to work on the issue.
   ``Nuclear fusion at room temperature would be contrary to all
understanding gained of nuclear reactions in the last half century;
it would require the existence of an as-yet-undiscovered nuclear
process,'' the report said.
   The panel said it was ``sympathetic toward modest support'' for
experiments with existing funds. This research should focus on
confirming or disproving the claims that excess heat was produced in
the University of Utah experiment.
   Separately, the advisory board said in a draft interim report to
Watkins that it doubted the potential for using a linear accelerator
instead of a new nuclear reactor to produce tritium, a radioactive
gas needed to make nuclear warheads.
   Scientists at Brookhaven and Los Alamos national laboratories and
at Westinghouse-Hanford Co. in Washington state concluded in a
report earlier this year that a linear accelerator could make
tritium more cheaply, quickly and safely than could a new nuclear
reactor. Energy Department officials in Washington, however, have
said the accelerator technology is too uncertain to count on yet.
   Watkins in August asked his advisory board to study the
accelerator option.
   In a draft of its interim report to Watkins, the panel said that
while an accelator would pose fewer safety and environmental
problems than a new nuclear reactor, those advantages may be more
than offset by the accelerator's need for large amounts of
electricity to operate.
   ``It may be simpler, in fact, to use a nuclear reactor to produce
tritium directly ... rather than have it, or a fossil plant, produce
electricity to operate the accelerator,'' the report said.
   The panel plans to issue a final recommendation to Watkins by
February.

<TEXT>
   Norman Rice, freshly elected as Seattle's first
black mayor, hit the streets Wednesday to thank voters and start
healing a city he sees divided over school busing and the quality of
public education.
   ``I think there is legitimate anger and frustration in the city
over education,'' Rice said before he began walking tours of
downtown and residential neighborhoods to shake hands and greet
residents.
   Rice, a three-term City Council member, defeated his neighbor and
one-time political ally, three-term City Attorney Douglas N. Jewett.
   With more than 99.9 percent of the city's precincts reporting,
Rice had 93,491 votes to Jewett's 67,276 _ a 58-to-42 percent margin.
   ``Seattle can be proud of itself tonight,'' Rice had told an
election-night victory party. ``Proud because we're a thinking
people, a thinking city and a city that cares and a city that lives
up to the progressivity that stands so high and makes it the most
livable city in the United States.''
   Rice, 46, said he would try to form a partnership between city
government and the schools to defuse tensions that rose over the
``Save Our Schools'' initiative, which sought to end mandatory
busing for school desegregation.
   That initiative, which had become a central issue in the mayoral
campaign, remained too close to call Wednesday, trailing by just 100
votes.
   The non-binding measure asked the city School Board to halt
mandatory busing of students for racial balance. In exchange, about
$4.5 million in city tax revenue would be earmarked for ``magnet''
programs to achieve racial balance in school enrollment.
   With about 12,000 ballots still uncounted, there were 64,477
votes against the initiative and 64,377 votes in favor.
   Rice said he also wanted his walking tours to show he is
committed to being actively involved in every neighborhood in
Seattle, which has a black population of about 12 percent.
   ``I want to make sure this is a partnership where neighborhoods
are rewarded for innovation and have police protection,'' Rice said.
``And I think I can play a role and assist the school district where
it needs it.''
   Jewett, 43, said he might have lost because of his GOP
affiliation in the strongly liberal, Democratic city.
   ``But Norm and I started the race as friends, and we went at it
as friends, and we finished it as friends,'' he said.
   Rice will succeed Mayor Charles Royer, who served an
unprecedented three four-year terms as mayor. He has accepted the
position of director of the Institute of Politics at the John F.
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.

<HEAD>Gov.-Elect Florio, Still Shaking Hands, Starts Building Administration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JO ASTRID GLADING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat James J. Florio set out
Wednesday to build a new administration, basking in his landslide
victory for governor and the return of Democratic control in the
Legislature.
   The Florio-led sweep gives Democrats the ability to redraw
congressional districts _ and influence political power _ after the
1990 Census.
   Florio, who soundly defeated Republican Rep. James Courter on
Tuesday, was up shortly after dawn Wednesday to thank commuters at a
train station. He then met with reporters and announced details of a
transition team before heading to a scheduled victory rally with
abortion rights activists.
   Abortion was one of the issues that helped Florio, 52, end an
eight-year Republican hold on the governor's office. Democrats, who
already controlled the state Senate, also reclaimed a majority in
the state Assembly.
   The governor's race was just getting under way in July when the
U.S. Supreme Court gave states more power to restrict abortions.
Courter, who has a long anti-abortion voting record, took several
weeks to remold his position and promise that he would not impose
his personal views on New Jersey's largely pro-choice electorate.
   By contrast, Florio, despite an anti-abortion stance early in his
political career, promised immediately to veto restrictive abortion
legislation.
   Courter's sometimes unclear position was criticized by both sides
on the abortion question. Anti-abortion activists accused the
Republican of abandoning them for political convenience, while
pro-choice forces never embraced his reformulated stance.
   Analysts and political loyalists said the Florio victory was
largely a credit to the Democrat's nearly flawless campaign and
evidence that Courter was hurt by his campaign's internal disarray,
miscues on delicate issues such as abortion and his own conservative
leanings.
   For New Jersey Republicans, Wednesday was a day to count the
casualties and wonder what ended the years of political dominance,
popularity, and unprecedented party wealth under Gov. Thomas Kean,
who was barred by state law from seeking a third consecutive term.
   Democrats won at least five Assembly seats from Republicans
Tuesday and will hold between 44 and 46 of the 80 seats when the
counting is completed, reversing a 41-39 GOP majority. Two districts
remained too close to call Wednesday.
   In the governor's race, with all but a handful of precincts
reporting, Florio had 1,356,957 votes, or 62 percent, to Courter's
824,505 votes, or 38 percent.
   Florio promised to tackle high auto insurance rates as his first
priority. New Jersey, where motorists pay an average of $1,000 per
car, has among the highest premiums in the nation.
   Florio's victory ended a 12-year-quest for the statehouse that
began when he competed in the 1977 Democratic primary. In 1981, he
lost to Kean by the narrowest margin in the state's history.

<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan presidential candidate Violeta
Chamorro met Wednesday with President Bush to underscore his support
for her cause and focus international attention on the upcoming
election.
   ``I am looking to my democratic friends to tell them my desire
for solidarity for the future'' of Nicaragua, Mrs. Chamorro,
candidate of the umbrella group opposing the ruling Sandinistas,
said after the meeting with Bush.
   She also will go to Rome, London, Madrid and Paris to solicit
international pressure for fair, open elections Feb. 25, said her
associate, Ernesto Palazio.
   ``We need more than ever the eyes of the world to be fixed in
Nicaragua. Don't look anywhere else, even for a single minute,''
Mrs. Chamorro said earlier at a luncheon sponsored by the Roman
Catholic human rights group, Puebla Institute.
   ``All over the world, the time for dictatorship is running out,''
she said.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega cannot win a fair election,
Mrs. Chamorro said.
   ``In a clean election in Nicaragua, he is not going to win
because the people want a change from totalitarianism to
democracy,'' she told reporters at the White House.
   Mrs. Chamorro visited the White House as the Sandinista
government said it would propose a new cease-fire to be coupled with
demobilization of the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   Ortega said he would bring the plan to reinstate the cease-fire
he called off last week to a United Nations-sponsored meeting with
the Contras on Thursday in New York.
   The plan would include a general amnesty once at least 50 percent
of the Contras have demobilized and the rebels free kidnapped people
they hold.
   Mrs. Chamorro told reporters Ortega should have given the amnesty
long ago and fulfilled other promises of the regional peace accord
he signed in August with four other presidents of Central America.
   The Contras should demobilize, she said, adding that the
Sandinista government should fullfil its promises.
   Contra leaders met Wednesday with Bush administration officials
to discuss their approach to the U.N. talks. The Contras were
willing to discuss demobilizing their troops, said one
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Their conditions include full amnesty for those imprisoned in the
war and several ``confidence-building'' measures aimed at ensuring
secure conditions for those Contras who want to return to their
homeland.
   Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council is sending a 625-member
border patrol force to stop Contras from infiltrating the border
from Honduras and to interdict shipments of Nicaraguan and Cuban
weapons the State Department says are being made to leftist rebels
in El Salvador.

   Five teen-agers were charged Wednesday
with raping an 11-year-old girl to initiate her as a gang ``queen.''
   ``Queen'' is a term for a girl who has gained status within a
gang by having sex with all its members, said Jefferson County
Sheriff's Deputy Tony Pippen. The girl apparently was not a willing
participant but was too afraid to resist, he said.
   The five, identified by authorities as members of the Gangster
Disciples, were arrested Sunday in Brighton, a Birmingham suburb.
   Lt. Thomas Jacobs said Antonio Jones, 18, was charged as an
adult and that the four others were charged with being juvenile
deliquents accused of rape. Three are 17 and one is 14.
   Deputy Charles Buchannon said that to his knowledge none of the
five, all students at Brighton High School, had been in trouble
before.
   Pippen said the girl was raped Saturday night in a Brighton
park. She was visiting a friend in Brighton and had talked on the
telephone to one of the boys who allegedly assaulted her, he said.
   The five went to the house the girl was visiting and asked her
to go for a walk. When she refused, they forced her to go with
them, Pippen said.
   He said the girl returned to her friend's house after the rape
and did not call authorities or her parents.
   Residents who heard about the rape flagged down Pippen and his
partner during their patrol Sunday and told them about it. The
deputies found the victim still at the girl friend's house and
questioned her.
   Gang members usually try to entice a girl into participating
willingly in the queen initiation, Pippen said.

   Total U.S. vegetable output this year is
expected to exceed the drought-reduced 1988 production, an
Agriculture Department report said Wednesday.
   The overall increase is due mostly to a 29 percent boost in
processing vegetable tonnage and a 3 percent larger potato harvest.
   Production of processing vegetables is estimated at nearly 15
million tons, while potato output is estimated at around 370
million hundredweight. The output of fresh vegetables in 1989 is
expected to be up 1 percent; mushrooms, 14 percent; sweet potatoes,
7 percent; and dry edible beans, 29 percent.
   Despite the strong increase in U.S. vegetable production, the
value of U.S. vegetable imports is expected to be up by about 5
percent to a record level, the report said.
   ``Growth in imports during 1989 stemmed from continued strong
prices at the wholesale and retail levels, and continued strong
consumer demand,'' the report said. ``Most of the imports are fresh
vegetables, which are brought in during the winter months when U.S.
production is limited to the southern-tier states.''

<HEAD>Japan Railways Use Mechanical Shaker as Wake-up Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three major railways said Wednesday they will use
mechanical shaking devices to replace some human wake-up services
for locomotive operators to save more than $1.8 million a year.
   Masamichi Kawabata, an official of East Japan Railway Co., said
his company made the decision after the government's Board of Audit
suggested that it and West Japan Railway Co. and Central Japan
Raiway Co. end wake-up services provided by outside agencies.
   He said East Japan will spend $1.1 million to introduce the
mechanical devices by next March. The devices inflate an air bag
under the sleeper at a set time to shake him awake.
   Kawabata said 40 to 50 electric locomotive operators and
conductors usually sleep in the same room but must get up at
different times, and alarm clocks would disturb everybody in the
room.
   He said that since before World War II, the railroad had
employed people from a wake-up service agency who went about with
lists of train schedules and bed numbers, waking up railway
employees one by one.
   Kawabata said East Japan, with 83,000 workers, has 162
dormitories and 38 of them use the services of outside agencies at
a cost of nearly $700,000 a year.
   An official of 50,000-worker West Japan, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said his company will spend $1.3 million to install
the wake-up devices in 25 sleeping rooms. West Japan has been
spending $1.1 million a year on wake-up service agencies, he said.
   An official of Central Japan said his company also will replace
the wake-up services with mechanical devices, but declined to
discuss details.
   The three companies are among seven corporations formed when the
state-run 277,000-worker Japan National Railways turned private in
April 1987.
   The Board of Audit still looks into their business since the
government still holds all stock in the companies.

   Republican J. Marshall Coleman said
Wednesday he would demand a recount of the closest governor's race
in Virginia history, but Democrat L. Douglas Wilder was already
relishing the historical dimensions of his apparent victory.
   ``It starts coming home to you, something happened last night,''
Wilder said at a news conference the morning after he claimed
victory as the nation's first black elected governor.
   Just what happened was not absolutely certain, although Wilder
still clung to a lead of 5,500 votes out of more than 1.7 million
cast. With all 1,967 precincts reporting, unofficial results showed
Wilder with 896,283 votes to Coleman's 890,750 votes.
   Because the margin was within one-half of 1 percent, Coleman had
the right under state law to demand a recount. At a news conference
in McLean, Va., he said he would do so.
   ``The outcome, although still in doubt, has given me a
responsibility, for plainly I am the trustee of the votes of more
than 880,000 Virginians who supported me in this contest. I have a
responsibility to them and to all Virginians to ensure the person
with the most votes is declared the winner,'' Coleman said.
   ``I congratulate Doug Wilder on a hard-fought campaign and if he
is certified the winner, he will have my full support,'' he added.
   But, he continued, ``For the good of the next governor, whoever
he may be, and for the good of the commonwealth, it is essential
that there be complete confidence in the integrity and accuracy of
the results.''
   The State Board of Elections will meet Nov. 27 to certify the
results of Tuesday's vote, which board Secretary Susan Fitz-Hugh
said was the closest contest for governor ever in Virginia.
   Coleman will have until Dec. 7 to request a recount. Mrs.
Fitz-Hugh said as far as she knew, no such recount had ever been
conducted in a statewide election. She had no estimate of how long
it would take to tally the votes a second time.
   Wilder's white running mates for lieutenant governor and attorney
general, Donald S. Beyer Jr. and Mary Sue Terry, both won by
substantial margins, prompting questions about the role that race
played in the campaign.
   But Wilder dismissed such speculation, saying the election
answered ``the subliminal question'' about the importance of race.
   ``I'm saying it is not and was not a factor in the results
because I was elected,'' he said. ``I said if I won by 50.1 percent
of the vote, I'd be happy. That's why you see me happy.''
   Wilder also dismissed questions about whether people were saying
one thing in pre-election polls and exit polls, all of which showed
him leading by a comfortable margin, and then voting a different way.
   The same polls showed Beyer well behind his Republican opponent,
Edwina P. ``Eddy'' Dalton, Wilder said. Beyer won 54 percent to 46
percent.
   Wilder also said he intended to serve as a full-time governor
rather than get involved in national Democratic politics as a
potential black rival to Jesse Jackson.
   ``I don't think you're going to see me being in confrontation
with anybody,'' he said. However, he added that if he were asked and
had the time, he would campaign for Democrats in other states. He
also would not rule out a bid for federal office in the future.
   He said his victory showed national party leaders that
``Democrats don't need to make special appeals to special groups''
because mainstream candidates can win.
   ``The mandate is that in Virginia, we are prepared to move and we
don't care what that person looks like,'' he said.
   Wilder, who used Coleman's opposition to abortion in television
advertising, said it would be wrong to say that his candidacy was
based on that single issue.
   But he said the vote showed that Virginians want to move forward
rather than ``turn the clock back'' to when abortions were illegal.
And he criticized President Bush's decision to veto Medicaid funding
for abortions.

<TEXT>
   The AP tally of votes in the Virginia
gubernatorial race erroneously gave Democrat L. Douglas Wilder
between 5,000 and 18,000 more votes than he actually had for about
an hour Tuesday night.
   At no point in the count of more than 1.7 million votes cast did
the bulge change who was ahead.
   The AP figures were based on unofficial reports from county
clerks.
   The problem was caused by double-counting of returns from a small
group of heavily black precincts. The returns from the precincts
were being gathered as a special project to provide information on
black voting patterns in Virginia contest. The precinct returns were
to be kept separate from the county-level tabulation in the AP
election computer, but they were not.
   Since Wilder was running up large margins in the heavily black
precincts, double-counting inflated Wilder's margin over Republican
J. Marshall Coleman. The degree of the inflation varied during the
period involved _ from about 8:45 p.m. EST until 9:55 p.m. EST.
Exact numbers by which the vote was inflated varied through the
hourlong period from 5,000 votes to 18,000 votes.
   The AP conducted a complete recanvass of all 136 jurisdictions in
Virginia on Wednesday to gather final, unofficial returns on the
race. With all those jurisdictions rechecked, the count showed
Wilder with a lead of about 5,500 votes. He had 896,283 votes or 50
percent to Coleman's 890,750 votes or 50 percent.

<HEAD>Bolinas To Tourists: Now that You Haven't Been Here, Don't Come</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOLINAS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you want to visit Bolinas, you'd better
have a map.
   Residents of this seaside town relish their privacy. And to make
sure they can maintain it, they rejected a measure on Tuesday's
ballot to erect signs pointing the way to their community. In the
past, directional signs were posted by the state and torn down by
residents.
   Measure N lost in the 875-voter precinct located somewhere in
Marin County, north of San Francisco. About 73 percent of voters
said they don't want the signs posted.
   The state Department of Transportation has the authority to erect
the signs anyway. However, the agency has posted 36 such signs in
the past 20 years, and residents have quietly torn down most of them.
   ``The vote count doesn't matter,'' said Greg Shelley, bartender
at Smiley's Schooner saloon. ``The sign's going to be torn down
anyway _ it's an unwritten thing.''

<NOTE>Concord Rejects Measure to Protect AIDS Victims from Discrimination</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of a measure to ban
discrimination against people with AIDS said Wednesday they lost at
the polls because of a well-organized, anti-gay campaign led by
Christian fundamentalists.
   ``The gay community has been confronted with fundamentalists for
three years out here and this was the first test at the polls,''
said the Rev. Larry Whitsell, who blamed the repeal of the
anti-discrimination ordinance on people who had a ``homophobic
reaction to what should've been a health issue.''
   Whitsell also blamed the defeat on apathy.
   ``I am disappointed in the city,'' he said. ``I am disappointed
in the people who did not get out and vote.''
   In a measure widely seen as a test of support for gay rights,
voters in this city of 100,000 about 40 miles northeast of San
Francisco passed Measure D, which repealed an ordinance designed to
protect AIDS victims from discrimination in housing or employment.
   Supporters characterized the defeat as a rejection of
``special-interest legislation.''
   ``I'm happy the people of Concord looked past the rhetoric and
the sympathy sell and looked at the facts,'' said Mark Zapalik,
chairman of the Yes on D Committee. ``They had the money and the
political backing and we had the truth. Jesus Christ is still Lord.''

<NOTE>Polugamist Mayor Wins Again</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Polygamist Alex Joseph, founder and
charter mayor of this southern Utah hamlet, has won another term by
defeating his brother-in-law by a lopsided vote of 104-to-4.
   Joseph, who has presided over the nation's only
Libertarian-controlled municipality since 1983, defeated Democrat
Davis Ruiz in Tuesday's municipal election.
   Ruiz is the brother of Delinda Joseph, one of Joseph's nine wives.
   Joseph opposes property taxes and the city collects none from its
450 residents.
   However, he has acknowledged the town needs a waste water
disposal system and paved roads, and he invited Ruiz to run on the
Democratic ticket to present a ``more traditional political
viewpoint.''
   Ruiz had no prior political experience beyond the Oct. 3 primary,
in which he defeated fellow Democrat Joseph Smith, but noted that he
had organized the Lake Powell marathon earlier this year.

<TEXT>
   A United Mine Workers leader waged a
last-minute write-in campaign to score an overwhelming victory over
a Democratic legislator whose son, a judge, has fined his union
millions of dollars.
   Don McGlothlin Sr. would not comment on whether frustration with
the seven-month-old UMW strike against Pittston Coal Group led to
his defeat after 22 years in the state House of Delegates.
   ``I respect the electorate. I have an abiding faith in their
decision,'' McGlothlin said by telephone from his law office in
Grundy. ``They decided it's time for a change, and so be it.''
   Jackie Stump, head of the UMW in southwestern Virginia, said
Tuesday that working people of all sorts, not just mine workers
elected him.
   With all 22 precincts reporting, Stump won 7,805 votes to
McGlothlin's 3,818.
   ``It shows what working people can do when they stick together,''
Stump told supporters who gathered outside the UMW offices in
Oakwood, Va., Tuesday night. ``The nurses, the custodians, the
teachers, the people who cook the schools, the doctors _ they all
came out and supported me.
   ``While I'm proud to be a part of the UMW, it's clear I got
support from all the working people of this area,'' he said. ``The
workers now have a voice in Richmond.''
   During the campaign, neither candidate talked much about the fact
that the legislator's son, Circuit Judge Donald A. McGlothlin Jr.,
fined the UMW repeatedly for strike-related activities.
   But UMW President Richard Trumka said in a telephone interview
from his Washington, D.C., office that the relationship ``had some
impact'' on the election.
   Democratic Party spokeswoman D.K. Starr, said: ``That's the wrong
way to win a race. You don't fire the father to punish the son.''
   Trumka said that although the elder McGlothlin claimed to be a
friend of the UMW he had said and done nothing to support the
strikers.
   ``The people have shown overwhelming support for the issues of
working people. They saw that Jackie Stump would be their voice,''
he said.
   About 1,700 UMW members in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky
have struck Pittston in a dispute over job security and benefits.

   Having toilets to flush and safe water to
drink will help end Third World conditions in the impoverished
``colonias'' along the Mexican border, community activists
celebrating voter approval of a water plan said Wednesday.
   Seven years of organizing and lobbying paid off with Tuesday's
passage of Proposition 2, said Amalia Lerma, a leader of Valley
Interfaith, a coalition of 36 churches in the Lower Rio Grande
Valley.
   A network of church-based groups throughout the state have pushed
for improved conditions in the substandard rural subdivisions for
years, including the statewide water amendment.
   Two things most Americans take for granted _ drinking water and
sewer lines _ will arrive for the first time for thousands of
colonia residents, Mrs. Lerma said.
   ``Peope will have toilets to flush,'' she said. ``It's not a
joke. This will make a big difference in people's lives.''
   Sewer systems particularly will help curb the incidence of such
``Third World'' diseases as hepatitis, tuberculosis, dysentery and
other gastrointestinal illnesses in the colonias, Mrs. Lerma said.
   The amendment authorizes a $500 million bond package for water
projects, sewer systems and flood control statewide. The colonias
are to get $100 million of the bond revenues.
   The measure passed by a vote of 686,475, or 60 percent, to
462,582, or 40 percent, of the ballots cast.
   More than 100,000 people are estimated to be living in colonias,
which often are carved out of farmland by real estate developers who
offer homes for down payments of as low as $100, but never install
adequate water, sewers, streets or drainage.
   Outhouses in back yards are common sights in colonias. Most homes
have drinking water but it is not unusual for the water system to be
contaminated or limited to a single outdoor faucet in the front
yards.
   Carmen Anaya, who has lived in Las Milpas, a colonia south of
Pharr in the Lower Rio Grande Valley for more than 30 years, said
Wednesday that the amendment's passage reminded her of the biblical
story of a man who said he could die contented after seeing Jesus.
   ``Last night, I went to church and I told God, `Thank you, but I
don't want to die. I want to keep working,''' said Mrs. Anaya, who
spent Tuesday hauling colonia residents to the polls in a tiny
Chevrolet Chevette.
   ``My greatest desire was that our children have water, so they
could bathe and go to school without being covered with dust from
the streets and being rejected by the other children,'' she said.

<HEAD>Hope for Endangered Elephants, Congress Told</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The tide may be turning in the battle to save
the African elephant, witnesses told a congressional hearing
Wednesday.
   ``For the first time in many years there is hope and confidence
that the species' precipitous decline can be stemmed and even
reversed in much of Africa,'' said Curtis Bohlen, senior vice
president of the World Wildlife Fund.
   But the United States must do more, including increasing its
spending for anti-poaching measures in Africa, according to Bohlen
and other conservationists testifying before the House Subcommittee
on Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation.
   ``It has been bitterly disappointing to me to see how little
money Congress has appropriated to the African Elephant
Conservation Fund: a paltry $350,000 for this fiscal year,'' Bohlen
said.
   ``That amount will not save many elephants,'' he added.
   Witnesses said worldwide recognition of the plight of the
African elephant has begun to have an impact on poaching, which has
been decimating the population for years. Agreements by the United
States and Japan to ban ivory imports and anti-poaching actions in
Africa have been crucial to the effort.
   Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., who chairs the subcommittee, said
merely declaring the elephant an endangered species is not enough.
   ``Our goal is not simply to save a few elephants here and there
for zoos and parks,'' Studds said. ``Our objective must be to
restore elephant populations; to work with the international
community and with the nations of Africa to bring those populations
back up to sustainable levels; to provide a source of income for
countries in desperate need of revenue.''
   Witnesses said that the banning of ivory trade has in some
instances already had an impact on poaching by reducing the market
for ivory.
   ``The absence of market demand and stepped-up enforcement
efforts have combined to greatly reduce the toll on elephants,''
Bohlen said. ``Ivory presently has no value in Tanzania where 1,840
poachers and traders have been arrested. Incredibly, tusks have
been found washing down the Ruaha River, dumped by culprits who no
longer can sell them.''
   Susan Lieberman of the Humane Society of the United States said
disagreements among African countries _ some of which do not
consider their elephant populations endangered _ must be settled
before more progress can be made.
   She also said steps must be taken to curb recreational hunting
despite arguments that costly hunting licenses provide revenue to
protect elephant herds.
   Nevertheless, Lieberman said the international agreements on
banning trade and helping to fight poaching mark significant
progress in the past year.
   ``The African Elephant has been granted a cease-fire,''
Lieberman said.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Anti-Abortion Protesters Not To Block Clinics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Wednesday prohibited
anti-abortion protesters from blocking half a dozen abortion clincs
in the District of Columbia.
   U.S. District Court Judge Louis Oberdorfer issued the
preliminary injunction against Operation Rescue and Veterans
Campaign for Life, which plan demonstrations the next two weekends
in the nation's capital.
   The injunction was issued at the request of the National
Organization of Women and nine other groups and medical facilities.
   Oberdorfer rejected a request from NOW to broaden the injunction
so that it covers all three dozen or so abortion facilities in the
metropolitan area.
   At a court hearing earlier this week, attorney John Schaefer
said Operation Rescue has harassed and intimidated women seeking
abortions, inflicting psychological and emotional harm during
blockades outside clinics in various parts of the country.
   Jay Sekulow said NOW's allegations are ``devoid of facts'' and
that there is no evidence Operation Rescue is involved in any type
of violent activity outside clinics.
   Patrick Mahoney, an Operation Rescue consultant, said he has
been in Washington for five weeks planning this week's
demonstrations and that ``I have no idea'' whether blockading
abortion clinics is among the activities.
   Questioned by the judge, Mahoney said there is a possibility
Operation Rescue has plans Mahoney doesn't know about.
   Operation Rescue is ``sidestepping back and forth'' by refusing
to say whether its members will trespass on private property at
abortion clinics, said attorney Laurence Eistenstein.
   But ``they will, as they have in the past,'' Eisenstein asserted
to the judge.
   Eisenstein said Operation Rescue has ``become a little more
sophisticated'' by using euphemisms like ``rescue'' for breaking
the law.

   A morning attack by Polisario guerrillas
in the disputed Western Sahara left 45 government soldiers dead and
56 wounded, the Ministry of Information said Wednesday.
   The statement released in Rabat confirmed reports from Polisario
headquarters in Algiers, Algeria, of heavy fighting early Wednesday
between the guerrillas and Moroccan troops.
   Morocco claimed 87 guerrillas died in the fighting in the
northeastern section of the Western Sahara. Polisario released no
casualty figures for its fighters.
   Both sides claimed to have wounded and taken prisoner
unspecified numbers of enemy troops.
   The attack took place along 16 miles of the 2,500-mile defensive
wall Morocco has built around the territory to keep the guerrillas
at bay, Polisario said.
   The rebels, who operate mostly from camps in Algeria and
Mauritania, claimed to have pushed back the 4th Moroccan Parachute
Battalion 15 miles.
   The guerrillas have battled the Moroccan government of King
Hassan II for control of the sparsely populated, mineral-rich
territory since Spain withdrew in 1975.

   The State Department on Wednesday welcomed what
it described as positive steps taken by the Syrian government toward
easing restrictions on the country's small Jewish population.
   In a written statement, the department said that Syria has
pledged to look positively at applications for legal emigration by
Jews with relatives who have already emigrated.
   In addition, the Syrian government has said it intends to
consider favorably the application for emigration visas by unamrried
Jewish women who have no prospect for marriage from within the
Jewish community, according to the statement.
   Finally, the statement said that Syria has promised to take
before the courts a case involving two Jewish brothers who have been
detained on suspicion of visiting Israel. Family visits also will be
allowed, the statement said.
   ``The U.S. government, which has long been involved in
discussions with the government of Syria on these important issues,
welcomes Syria's decision to take these positive steps and what
appears to be a more flexible approach by Syria to these
humanitarian concerns,'' it said.

<HEAD>Airline Reregulation Emerges In Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airline officials told a congressional panel
Wednesday that proposals that could lead to reregulation of the
industry would hurt service rather than improve it.
   ``The message I hear is that we are free to be innovative, free
to risk capital, free to compete, as long as we lose money,'' Robert
L. Crandall, head of American Airlines, told the Senate Commerce,
Science and Transportation's aviation subcommittee.
   ``If we are successful, the rug is likely to be pulled out from
under us,'' he said.
   The subcommittee heard testimony on a bill that would alter
several practices sponsors say have driven small airlines out of
business and kept others from starting up.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, meanwhile, introduced the Airline
Reregulation Act that would go much further, allowing the government
once again to regulate fares, routes and services.
   Congress deregulated the industry in 1978.
   ``I don't know if complete reregulation is the answer,''
Metzenbaum said in announcing the bill. ``But I do know it's time we
owned up to the fact that airline deregulation was a mistake.''
   Metzenbaum was the lead-off witness before the subcommittee,
which was discussing an airline competition bill opponents said also
would reregulate.
   That proposal, sponsored by Sens. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., and
John McCain, R-Ariz., would force big airlines to give up their
computerized reservations systems, stop them from booking flights on
smaller airlines as if they are their own, end the selling of slots
at major airports and strengthen the government's hand to increase
competition.
   ``Instead of a proliferation of choices, consumers are
increasingly faced with little or no choice,'' McCain said about
airline service.
   Crandall, however, told the committee the proposals would
``diminish, not enhance, competition.''
   He acknowledged that computer reservations systems give airlines
who own them a competitive advantage, but denied that was because of
anything built into the systems provided to travel agents for
booking all their flights.
   ``Why should we be deprived of an advantage we have earned?''
Crandall asked.
   He said that rather than trying to restrict successful airlines,
the government should concentrate on building more airports and
other facilities to increase competition.
   James W. Callison, a senior vice president of Delta Air Lines,
said forced divestiture of reservations systems would produce
increased air fares.
   Callison said a provision of the bill that would prevent airlines
from linking up with small commuter airlines would punish airlines
that have not taken over smaller carriers.
   ``Delta's connection carriers operate as independent companies,
not owned by Delta, and are major examples of small business at its
best,'' he said.
   Edward R. Beauvais, chief executive of the smaller America West
Airlines, indicated general support for the bill and suggested it
also call for an Internal Revenue Service investigation of frequent
flyer programs.
   ``These programs, although quite popular, are among the most
antithetical to the spirit and goals of airline deregulation,''
Beauvais said.
   He noted that while businesses often pay for the original
tickets, employees can use the frequent flyer bonus without being
taxed for the benefit.
   ``The programs do not promote new business, they simply allow
airlines to charge higher prices for the business that they are
already receiving,'' Beauvais said.
   Most U.S. airlines, including America West, award flights and
other benefits for customers who regularly fly with them.

<TEXT>
   Victories by black Democrats in municipal and
state elections signal a ``new direction for black politics'' and
will likely result in more blacks running for elected office as
moderates, several analysts said Wednesday.
   The victories ``will help set a new direction in black politics''
because black candidates were successful in many cases where the
black voting population remains a very small minority, said Linda
Williams, a fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School for
Government.
   On Tuesday, David Dinkins was elected as the first black mayor of
New York and L. Douglas Wilder was apparently elected as governor of
Virginia. If Wilder's apparent victory holds up, he will become the
nation's first black governor.
   Blacks also took control of city halls in New Haven, Conn.;
Seattle; Cleveland, and Durham, N.C. In Detroit, Coleman Young was
elected to an unprecedented fifth term as mayor.
   ``One of the first sort of practical developments I think we'll
see is more blacks taking a chance, running in places where blacks
are not the majority,'' said Williams, who specializes in race and
politics.
   She said blacks chose not to run previously under those
circumstances because they saw little likelihood of winning.
   But Williams and other analysts say the exhilaration blacks may
feel with these successes is tempered by the moderation of the
candidates and their campaigns. Some analysts argued that the
winners were forced to be moderate, almost to the exclusion of
economic and social issues more traditionally associated with black
candidates.
   Williams noted that both Wilder and Dinkins distanced themselves
from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, twice a presidential candidate.
   But Jackson dismissed attempts by others to ``disconnect'' him
from Tuesday's electoral victories.
   ``If, after the '88 campaign of Dukakis, there had been an
increase in Greek registration, if you now had a Greeek chairman of
the Democratic Party and a Greek governor of Virginia and mayor of
New York and New Haven and Seattle and Cleveland, no one would be
trying to find the disconnection because the connection would be so
very apparent,'' Jackson told reporters outside the Washington
Hilton Hotel.
   ``It was clear that the (Roger) Ailes forces were going to use me
as the Willie Horton force for polarization,'' in New York, said
Jackson in a reference to George Bush's use of a black Massachusetts
murderer in what many termed a negative 1988 presidential campaign
against Michael Dukakis. Ailes is a campaign consultant.
   ``We stepped back strategically,'' Jackson said.
   ``If we're members of the same team, does it really matter who
scored the touchdown. If we're members of the same team, if we win
the championship, all of us get the ring,'' Jackson said.
   Saying that many of Tuesday's winners were ``either delegates of
our campaign or voters for our campaign,'' Jackson said he had won
the 1988 Democratic presidential primary in all the areas where
black candidates were successful Tuesday.
   ``In many ways, the electorate yesterday was less sexist and less
racist and more fair and more mature than ever before in American
history,'' he said.
   Other analysts say the elections may signal harder rather than
easier times for black politicians and their base constituency.
   ``What we're going to have is that it's going to make it much
more difficult for the black community,'' said James Turner, a
political sociologist at Cornell University.
   Turner called the victors ``clubhouse politicians'' who ``have
said they are not going to speak to the black community while they
assume their support.''
   ``These people have taken a very cautious, moderate position, a
kind of non-economic liberal position,'' Turner said.
   ``I think this could be deceiving because it has not prepared the
white electorate for the really difficult decisions,'' said Turner.
   Of political candidates who still want to run on the platform
more geared toward the poor, Williams said, ``I'm not sure that they
will see a lot of hope for that strategy.''
   ``If they (Dinkins and Wilder) couldn't have done what they did,
it really would have been a hopeless situation,'' said Willims, also
noting that many of Tuesday's victors are black politicians who
worked their way up the Democratic Party structure.
   Williams said that although both Dinkins and Wilder garnered
support from many of the whites who voted for Jackson in 1988 their
successes Tuesday ``may show him he'll have to moderate it even more
and change his campaign style.''

<HEAD>Ambassador-Nominee Criticizes Honduran Election System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's nominee to be U.S. ambassador
to Honduras told senators on Wednesday that a recent decision to
permit Hondurans to vote by simply flashing an identity card opens
the door to election fraud.
   Cresencio Arcos Jr., 45, a Texas-born career diplomat, commented
in response to questions during confirmation hearings before the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   The issue was raised by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman
of the panel's Latin American subcommittee, who said such a method
of voter registration could allow one person ``to vote in seven
different places.''
   Arcos, who is currently deputy assistant secretary of state for
Central America, said the Bush administration has made its concern
over the development known to the Honduran government.
   Under the new rule, he said, ``it would be possible for someone
to vote in several different precincts.''
   ``That is a wide open invitation for widespread fraud,'' Dodd
told the nominee.
   ``You certainly can reach that conclusion,'' Arcos replied. ``It
lends itself to that.''
   Arcos, a native of San Antonio, joined the United States
Information Office in 1971 and has served in Portugal, Brazil, the
Soviet Union and Honduras.
   In 1985 he was named deputy director of the Nicaraguan
Humanitarian Assistance Office which was responsible for
distributing $27 million in so-called humanitarian aid to the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   The committee is set to endorse the Arcos nomination shortly,
sending it to the Senate floor where early confirmation is expected.
   Arcos will replace Ambassador Everett Briggs.

   David Dinkins gave the thumbs-up sign Wednesday
to hundreds of people who welcomed him to City Hall, where he will
begin work in January as the first black mayor of the nation's most
populous city.
   ``Frankly, I'm flabbergasted!'' he said. ``I was very surprised
to find so many people. I'm delighted.''
   Dinkins' first day after defeating Rudolph Giuliani by fewer than
50,000 votes was spent getting acquainted with his workplace.
   He met with Mayor Edward I. Koch and then said at a news
conference that he might not have won without the immediate support
Koch gave him after Dinkins defeated the three-term mayor in a
September primary.
   With all but three of the city's 5,237 precincts reporting, the
unofficial count showed Dinkins with 898,900 votes, or 50 percent,
while Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor who ran as a reformer,
had 856,450 votes, or 48 percent. Conservative and Right to Life
candidates each had 1 percent.
   Dinkins, 62, said he recognized the importance of his role in
history.
   ``Clearly, I see myself as a person who has the privilege of
representing a large number of people, not just in New York but
across the country, who are African-Americans. And I am very proud
to accept that,'' he said.
   ``But there's also leadership of the largest, most important and
greatest urban center in the world and they really go hand in hand.
If I can do my job well, then African-Americans across this land
will be proud that I have done that,'' he said.
   Koch, meanwhile, said he'll fall behind the curtain gracefully
but hinted he will stay in the wings.
   ``I'm going to differ with him on occasion _ privately in the
beginning, publicly later on,'' he said.
   ``I loved being the mayor but it's not the whole Ed Koch,'' he
added. ``I have other facets to my personality which you will soon
see,'' he said.
   The same might be said about Giuliani. Some Republicans _ and at
least one prominent Democrat _ said they wouldn't be surprised to
see the former prosecutor challenge Gov. Mario Cuomo next year.
   ``If I was Mario Cuomo, I would be worried,'' said John Dyson, a
wealthy Democrat who worked in the administration of former Gov.
Hugh Carey.
   Democratic consultant William Cunningham also said he was
impressed by Giuliani.
   ``He got 48 percent in a Democratic city, against a 5-1
registration edge, up against every leading light of the national
Democratic Party,'' Cunningham said.
   His reference was to the high-level assistance Dinkins received
during the campaign from Cuomo, Koch, Sen. Edward Kennedy, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson and others. But Wednesday was a day for celebration by
people with less prominent names as well.
   On the streets of the city, from subways to stores to hotels to
the steps of City Hall, people like 29-year-old Shelley Miller and
32-year-old Arlene Hamilton were talking about tiny differences they
already perceived in their city as a result of Dinkins' victory.
   ``I do feel there's a new respect,'' said Ms. Miller, who is
black.
   Noting that taxis often refuse to pick up black people, she
recalled how a friend told her early Wednesday as they emerged from
Dinkins' victory celebration, ``Oh, we won't have any problems
getting a taxi tonight.''
   ``Actually, we did get a cab like that last night,'' she said
with a laugh and a snap of her fingers.

   A non-binding ballot question declaring
English the official language of Lowell passed overwhelmingly over
the objections of minority groups who fear it could jeopardize
federal funds.
   The measure, which passed Tuesday by a vote of 14,575 to 5,679,
was strongly opposed by minorities in a city of about 100,000 that
is home to 25,000 Hispanics and Asians.
   School Committeeman George Kouloheras proposed the measure, not
as a statement against minorities, he said, but to determine the
support for a common tongue.
   ``The United States of America has been enriched by the cultural
contributions of immigrants with many traditions, but blessed with
one common language that has united a diverse nation and fostered
harmony among its people,'' Kouloheras said in statement.
   Critics had warned that federal discretionary funds for
bilingual programs could go elsewhere if the city took such a stand.
   Daniel Lamb, director of the Massachusetts Office of Refugees
and Immigrants, called the vote ``regrettable'' and said he hoped
voters would reconsider the measure in the future.

<HEAD>Eds: State Oil Spill Liability Laws Preserved</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Wednesday preserved the states'
ability to adopt stricter oil spill liability laws than the federal
government in a move environmentalists called a victory and the oil
industry wants vetoed.
   ``This is a fundamental right of the states,'' said Rep. George
Miller, D-Calif., who along with Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., led the
fight to maintain existing state discretion against the oil
industry's call for change.
   Their effort was approved by a 279-143 vote that inserted the
provision into a massive bill that determines how oil spill cleanups
will be financed and managed. A vote on the whole bill is expected
Thursday.
   The legislative package has been in the works for years, but was
pushed to the forefront after the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground
last spring in Prince William Sound, Alaska, dumping 11 million
gallons of crude oil into the pristine waterway.
   Michael Francis of the Wilderness Society called the action
``very significant'' and a victory for environmentalists.
   ``This is one of the biggest environmental votes this year,'' he
said.
   The American Petroleum Institute lobbied heavily against the
provision and said it would urge a presidential veto if it is not
changed in a conference committee.
   The oil spill liability legislation passed by the Senate also
allows states to have tougher laws. This is the first time in 14
years of considering such measures that the House has gone along
with the Senate in adopting an explicit recognition of state
discretion. But Congress has never prohibited the states from
adopting stricter laws.
   Twenty-eight states have their own oil spill liability statutes.
Nineteen set no limits on the amount that should be spent by oil
companies or carriers for cleaning up damaged environments.
   A key concern raised during House debate was whether the
insurance costs for transporting oil would be prohibitively high if
states continue to demand more money from the oil companies and
carriers for spills.
   ``Operators involved in transportation of petroleum products may
feel it's not worth the legal risks,'' said Rep. Norman Lent, R-N.Y.
``Home heating oil may suddenly disappear.''
   ``Before the Valdez oil spill we had not seen a spill that
created more than $100 million to $200 million worth of damage,''
said Rep. Thomas Carper, D-Del. ``It's not going to be easy to get
insurance in the future.''
   A $2 billion price tag has been put on the Exxon Valdez cleanup.
   ``If the House plan is adopted into law many responsible
transporters of oil will likely be driven out of business and
replaced by less financially responsible and capable shippers,''
said the petroleum institute.
   The states' right to pre-empt the federal statute was supported
by the National Governors Association, the Coastal States
Association, the National Association of Attorneys General and
environmental organizations.

   Communist Party chief Egon Krenz swept the old
guard from the ruling Politburo in a desperate attempt Wednesday to
stem flight to the West, appease pro-democracy protesters and
strengthen his 3-week-old leadership.
   East Germans disillusioned by 40 years of rigid rule and
skeptical of promises continued leaving in droves. Pro-reform
groups pleaded with their countrymen to stay and help ``build a
real democratic society,'' but more than 50,000 had arrived in West
Germany since Saturday.
   Krenz made a stinging attack on his predecessor and mentor,
Erich Honecker, and Communist authorities took the first steps
toward registering New Forum, the nation's largest pro-democracy
group.
   Officials in Frankfurt an der Oder legalized New Forum locally
and the local Christian Democrats, a small party previously allied
with the Communists, gave them space in its building, the official
news agency ADN reported.
   The party propaganda chief said free elections might be possible.
   ADN said 25,000 people in Neubrandenburg rallied for free
elections, greeting the leadership's decisions with whistles, and
15,000 protested in Limbach-Oberfrohna, near Karl-Marx-Stadt.
   ``Our country is going through a tense and extremely difficult
development,'' Krenz told the Central Committee, which unanimously
approved his proposal to dissolve the 21-member Politburo and form
a smaller one.
   Central Committee members reaffirmed Krenz, 52, as party leader
and announced the election of an 11-member Politburo. Krenz and six
other Politburo members were re-elected.
   Four new members chosen for the Politburo, the nation's most
powerful body, included Hans Modrow, the 61-year-old Dresden party
chief said to be a leading advocate of reform.
   Modrow was proposed for the post of premier, which has been
empty since Tuesday's resignation of Premier Willi Stoph, 75, and
the entire Council of Ministers, or Cabinet.
   Parliament's presidium was to meet Thursday to set a date to
elect a new Cabinet.
   In Washington, deputy White House press secretary Roman Popadiuk
said the Bush administration hoped the shakeup ``is a step on the
road to stable and evolutionary reform.''
   The aging Politburo members dropped were closely associated with
Honecker, 77, whom Krenz replaced Oct. 18. They included Stoph;
ideology chief Kurt Hager; Erich Mielke, head of the dreaded
security apparatus, and Parliament speaker Horst Sinderman.
   Krenz accused the old guard of ``hesitant, even repelling
attitudes'' and said: ``Wrong judgments were made about the
situation, and there was no reaction to questions long posed by
daily life.''
   Independent, non-Communist groups would be allowed a greater
role in society, Krenz said, because ``the Politburo thinks that
citizens' movements that are within the constitution should be
legalized.''
   It was unclear how much power any such group would have because
the constitution guarantees the leading role of the Communist
Party, and Krenz has said that is not open to debate.
   The Interior Ministry has accepted New Forum's application to be
legalized and the ministry will decide in three months. New Forum
was outlawed in September, but has been tolerated of late.
   Krenz has been under growing pressure at home and abroad to
allow free, multiparty elections like those held in Poland and
planned for Hungary.
   Politburo member Guenter Schabowski, the party's new propaganda
chief and one of those re-elected, said such elections were
possible.
   ``When we have an election law that gives all political forces
the opportunity to draw up and represent their own programs, the
Communist Party will stand,'' he said.
   Schabowski, the East Berlin party chief and a leading reform
advocate, gave no timetable or details, and said the party would
not embark on such a course ``with the suicidal notion that it
could be swept from the political stage.''
   In Bonn, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl offered badly needed
financial support to East Germany if the Communists surrender their
monopoly on power.
   ``We are not prepared to support a system that has lost its
legitimacy,'' Kohl said. ``But we are prepared to offer
far-reaching help if genuine and thorough-going political and
economic reforms take root.''
   The Central Committee decisions and Krenz's speech were reported
by the state news agency ADN. The Central Committee, which approves
leadership and major policy changes, has 163 members, but only 157
attended Wednesday's session.
   On the West German border Wednesday, police said 50,000 East
Germans had arrived since Saturday, when the Communist government
allowed them to go West via Czechoslovakia. It was the first time
East Germany opened a direct channel to the West since the
Communists built the Berlin Wall in 1961.
   Nearly 200,000 mostly young East Germans have left their country
this year, either by emigrating legally, or by fleeing through
Hungary, Czechoslovakia or Poland. West Germany grants East Germans
automatic citizenship and helps them start new lives.
   In a dramatic appearance on national TV, author Christa Wolf
read an appeal from five unofficial, pro-reform groups, including
New Forum, to East Germans to stay in their homeland.
   ``Help us to build a real democratic society,'' Ms. Wolf said.
``We need you ... have confidence in yourself and in us, stay
here.''

<HEAD>Judge Rules in Favor of Prosecution in Case Aginst Miami Officer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge made key rulings Wednesday in favor of the
prosecution in the manslaughter case against the Miami officer
whose shooting of a black motorcyclist touched off January riots.
   The Jan. 16 shooting by Officer William Lozano, 30, of
motorcyclist Clement Lloyd, 23, and the death of passenger Allan
Blanchard, who also was black, in the subsequent crash touched off
three days of racial violence.
   Defense efforts in pre-trial motions to introduce the drug
connections and police record of Lloyd were denied by Dade Circuit
Judge Joseph Farina during a break in jury selection.
   ``You don't get summarily executed because you are a drug
dealer,'' prosecutor Richard Shiffrin told the judge.
   Farina also said the prosecution could use testimony about Miami
city police regulations to indicate whether Lozano acted
negligently and unprofessionally.
   The defense's only consolation came when Farina ruled it may
bring up 5.5 grams of marijuana found on Lloyd's body, as well as
$1,500 cash he had in his pocket.
   The defense may also tell jurors that Lloyd had alcohol and a
high level of THC, marijuana's active ingredient, in his
bloodstream. The judge, however, barred any such testimony for
Blanchard, 24.
   He reserved judgment on testimony about minute amounts of
cocaine found in Lloyd's nose.
   Wednesday's hearing touched on the key issues for both sides in
the case against the Colombian-born officer, who faces two
manslaughter counts.
   Lozano fired one shot, hitting Lloyd in the head and killing
him, as the motorcyclist sped away from another officer.
   In the subsequent rioting, one person was killed, 11 wounded by
gunfire, and 13 buildings were burned down in predominantly black
neighborhoods.
   Defense attorney Roy Black sought to bolster his client's
self-defense argument by saying Lloyd was willing to run over the
officer to avoid arrest.
   Calling Lloyd ``a man who was in Overtown collecting his drug
profits for the day,'' the attorney said: ``He didn't want to stop.
... He wanted to escape.''
   Black said Lloyd ``was going right through Lozano to get away.''
   The defense also sought to introduce statements contending the
prosecution was racially and politically motivated, and that some
prosecutors had privately acknowledged that. But the judgedenied
that.
   Questioning of prospective jurors, which began Monday,
continued. By mid-afternoon, the jury pool had been narrowed down
to 42 people comprised of seven blacks, five Hispanics and 30
non-Hispanic whites.

   President Bush conferred Wednesday with a
group of government experts on the Soviet Union in the third in a
series of meetings to prepare for next month's shipboard summit
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Bush met for more than an hour with representatives of the State
Department, National Security Council and Central Intelligence
Agency, including CIA Director William Webster, said White House
deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk.
   Bush met with a similar group last Saturday at Camp David, and
then held talks Monday with Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was national
security adviser to President Carter.
   Further meetings are planned with government and outside experts
before Bush meets with Gorbachev Dec. 2 and 3 on warships in the
Mediterranean in the waters off Malta.
   Meanwhile, officials said the tentative schedule calls for the
first day of talks to be held on a Soviet ship, followed by
meetings the next day on the U.S. ship, the guided missile cruiser
Belknap.
   Gorbachev likely will host a luncheon and dinner for Bush on the
first day, and Bush will host a reciprocal luncheon the next day.
   While there have been references to the meeting as a high-seas
summit, the ships actually are to be anchored close to shore,
perhaps 1,000-to-2,000 yards off land.

<HEAD>Analyst Says Palestinian State Inevitable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank is inevitable and further U.S. and Israeli rejection of
this conclusion could be dangerous, according to a study by the
Rand Corporation.
   The study, written by the CIA's former chief analyst on the
Middle East, Graham Fuller, also concluded that the Israeli and
American search for Palestinian spokesmen who are not members of
the Palestine Liberation Organization ``is to all intents and
purposes dead.''
   The Rand Corporation is a research center financed mostly by the
Defense Department, but Fuller's report was a project he initiated
before joining the organization and was not requested by the
administration, said Rand spokesman Jess Cook.
   The United States and Israel both rejected the PLO's declaration
of a Palestinian state in the West Bank when it was made last year.
   But while the United States has said it would accept a
Palestinian state in the West Bank if it was the result of
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, Israel flatly opposes such a
state on the land it captured in the 1967 Mideast war.
   The administration has been trying to get Israel and the 1.7
million Palestinians under Israeli occupation to negotiate a
political settlement. But Israel has asked for U.S. assurances that
the PLO will be excluded from such talks, which would initially be
convened to arrange elections in the West Bank.
   The United States has been trying to negotiate a course between
Israeli rejection of the PLO and pressure from Egypt and the PLO
itself to be included in all talks. The administration reversed a
13-year ban last December and launched low-level talks with the PLO
in Tunis.
   ``To talk to the PLO is to move a long way toward recognizing
the legitimacy of Palestinian aspirations for a state,'' said the
Rand report. ``Hardline Israeli politicians know this _ which is
why direct talks with the PLO are absolutely anathema. Indeed, with
the establishment of direct talks between the United States and the
PLO, Israel now has, whether it wants them or not, indirect
negotiations with the PLO.''
   Entitled ``The West Bank and Israel: Point of No Return?,'' the
report suggests that the forces unleashed by the 23-month
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule ``have now made the
ultimate emergence of a Palestinian state on the West Bank
inevitable.
   ``Such a process will be long, painful and complex. But no other
solution any longer seems viable.''
   It warns that ``continued efforts by either side to resist what
now seems the inevitable compromise of conflicting national
aspirations will prove frustrating _ and perhaps even costly.''
   Fuller advises Israel to accept this reality and assume
leadership in bringing about creation of such a state: ``It is
important that the birth of the new state not be perceived as an
Arab victory born of force and violence, for this might encourage
further attempts to use force against the Israeli state.''

<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES thoroughout with Bush pledge to lift trade embargo if
Mrs. Chamorro wins Nicaraguan election in February. No pickup</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush promised Wednesday to lift the
trade embargo against Nicaragua if the U.S.-backed presidential
candidate, Violeta Chamorro, defeats leftist President Daniel
Ortega in the February election.
   The statement came after a meeting in which Mrs. Chamorro asked
Bush for aid to help with economic reconstruction after the
election and the two agreed on the need to muster international
support for fair elections, according to U.S. and Nicaraguan
participants.
   The United States spent millions of dollars under President
Reagan to fuel the Contra rebels in their war to oust Ortega.
   Bush, while endorsing a diplomatic rather than military
approach, has continued the policy that Ortega should be removed
from office. He supports Mrs. Chamorro's candidacy, signing a $9
million election aid package that will in large part boost her race.
   A statement issued by White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said
that Mrs. Chamorro had stressed in a letter to Bush that her
administration ``would be committed to reconcilation ... and
reconstruction of the economy in peace and democracy.''
   ``Should this occur, the president said the United States would
be ready to lift the trade embargo and assist in Nicaragua's
reconstruction,'' the statement said.
   The trade embargo was imposed in May 1985, banning imports from
or exports to Nicaragua.
   ``The president looks forward to the day when, with a democratic
government, Nicaraguans will have good political and economic
relations with the United States and the rest of the free world and
will be able to begin rebuilding after decades of dictatorship,''
the statement said.
   Mrs. Chamorro visited Bush as part of an international trip
seeking to focus the global spotlight on Nicaragua's Feb. 25
election.
   ``I am looking to my democratic friends to tell them my desire
for solidarity for the future'' of Nicaragua, Mrs. Chamorro,
candidate of the opposition coalition opposing the ruling
Sandinistas, said after the meeting with Bush.
   She also will go to Rome, London, Madrid and Paris to solicit
international pressure for fair, open elections, said her
associate, Ernesto Palazio.
   ``We need more than ever the eyes of the world to be fixed in
Nicaragua. Don't look anywhere else, even for a single minute,''
Mrs. Chamorro said earlier at a luncheon sponsored by the Roman
Catholic human rights group, Puebla Institute.
   ``All over the world, the time for dictatorship is running
out,'' she said.
   Ortega cannot win a fair election, Mrs. Chamorro said.
   ``In a clean election in Nicaragua, he is not going to win
because the people want a change from totalitarianism to
democracy,'' she told reporters at the White House.
   Mrs. Chamorro stands to benefit from much of the $9 million the
United States is sending to help with election-related preparations
such as voter registration and poll monitoring.
   The president and Mrs. Chamorro agreed that ``although the
Nicaraguan government has taken several measures to permit greater
freedoms, the Sandinistas have not fully complied with their
agreement of Aug. 4 with the opposition coalition. More needs to be
done, such as providing equal access to television and full amnesty
for political prisoners,'' Popadiuk's statement said.
   Mrs. Chamorro visited the White House as the Sandinista
government said it would propose a new cease-fire to be coupled
with demobilization of the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   Ortega said he would bring the plan to reinstate the cease-fire
he called off last week to a United Nations-sponsored meeting with
the Contras on Thursday in New York.
   The plan would include a general amnesty once at least 50
percent of the Contras have demobilized and the rebels free
kidnapped people they hold.
   Mrs. Chamorro told reporters Ortega should have given the
amnesty long ago and fulfilled other promises of the regional peace
accord he signed with four other presidents of Central America.
   The Contras should demobilize, she said, adding that the
Sandinista government should fulfill its promises.
   The White House said Bush hoped the New York talks wouuld lead
to a permanent ceasefire and conditions under which the Contras
could return to their homeland ``in safety and with full political
and civil rights.''
   Contra leaders met Wednesday with Bush administration officials
to discuss their approach to the U.N. talks. The Contras were
willing to discuss demobilizing their troops, said one
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Their conditions include full amnesty for those imprisoned in
the war and several ``confidence-building'' measures aimed at
ensuring secure conditions for those Contras who want to return to
their homeland.
   Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council is sending a 625-member
border patrol force to stop Contras from infiltrating the border
from Honduras and to interdict shipments of Nicaraguan and Cuban
weapons the State Department says are being made to leftist rebels
in El Salvador.

   A widespread power outage struck parts of the West late
Wednesday afternoon, leaving cities in Wyoming and South Dakota
without electricity, authorities said.
   ``From what I've been told, it's a system-wide failure,'' said
Lt. Glen Talley of the Custer, S.D., sheriff's department. ``I've
talked to people at Black Hills Power and Light and they don't know
what the problem is.
   ``It looks like most of the Black Hills is without
electricity,'' he said.
   Cities known to have lost their power shortly after 4 p.m. MST
were Gillette, Wyo., and the South Dakota communities of Rapid
City, Spearfish, Belle Fourche, and Custer.
   In Gillette, police department Lt. Laurie Kadrich said police
were advising consumers to expect to be without power for at least
one hour, and possibly as long as three.
   ``The only thing we know right now is we're part of an area-wide
power outage,'' said Kadrich. ``We have strange power outages. Part
of the county is out, and part is in.''
   Utility officials could not immediately explain the outage,
which occurred in systems operated by the Black Hills Power and
Light Co., based in Rapid City, S.D., and the Portland, Ore.-based
Pacific Power and Light Co., which serves Utah, Idaho and Wyoming.

<TEXT>
   The government said Wednesday some
food companies are using cheap industrial tallow from the United
States to make instant noodles instead of soap, and ordered
emergency action to stop them.
   Instant noodles are South Korea's most popular fast food.
   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon directed health officials to stop
the use of inedible fats in food and ordered new rules for food
production.
   Health Ministry officials said tests indicated the contaminated
noodles were not harmful to health, but consumer groups are
demanding tougher food standards.
   Prosecutors announced Wednesday that 10 senior officials of five
food companies would be indicted on charges of using industrial
fats and tallow to make instant noodles and other foods. The
maximum sentence on conviction is five years in prison.
   Public anger has grown over what South Korean media call ``the
great noodle scandal.'' Officials allege that several leading food
companies have used industrial fats, which are cheaper and of
poorer quality than those intended for use in food.
   Government prosecutors say imported U.S. fats and tallow
intended for making soap and other industrial uses have been used
for noodles and other food products. The companies claim the tallow
was purified to make it edible.
   Consumers have boycotted leading brands of instant noodles,
forcing stores to pull the goods from their shelves.
   Supermarkets have removed other suspected products, including
margarine, cooking oil and shortening. News reports say many
customers are returning unused food items for refunds.
   The Defense Ministry said it had ordered military kitchens to
stop using instant noodles, a staple food for the nation's 650,000
soldiers.
   According to prosecutors, Samyang Food Co. has imported more
than 8,000 tons of industrial tallow this year to make 700 million
packets of instant noodles.
   It came from the United States, the world's leading exporter of
industrial tallow, but officials said there was no American
involvement in the scandal. Prosecutors say food companies changed
labels on the tallow to indicate it was edible.
   About 18,000 of the 70,000 metric tons of industrial fats
imported from the United States last year was improperly used in
food processing, the prosecutors allege.
   Those arrested included officials of Samyang Food Co., Ottugi
Food Co., Samlip Oil and Fat Co., Pusan Oil and Fat Chemical Co.
and Seoul Heinz Co., which is partly owned by the U.S. company
Heinz.
   The government said it would prepare new customs guidelines for
food materials, increase the number of customs officers and spend
the equivalent of $2.3 million on new testing facilities.

   PLO official Hakam Balaoui held talks with
American diplomats on Wednesday on the eve of a meeting by the
PLO's Executive Committee to take a final stand on a U.S. Middle
East peace plan.
   The Palestinian news agency WAFA gave no details except to say
the talks at the U.S. Embassy were aimed at ``advancing the Middle
East peace process in a practical way.''
   U.S. Ambassador to Tunisia Robert Pelletreau remains the only
American official authorized to talk with representatives of the
Palestine Liberation Organization since Chairman Yasser Arafat
renounced terrorism last December.
   Since then, four high-level meetings have taken place between
U.S. and PLO delegations and numerous individual consultations.
   PLO official Abdullah al-Hourani announced Thursday's meeting of
the Executive Committee to reporters in Cairo, Egypt, after he and
two other committee members met with Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel-Meguid. The 15-member committee, headed by Arafat, is the
PLO's highest standing body.
   Al-Hourani said the meeting with Abdel-Meguid was ``to discuss
(peace) initiatives on the table and ways of dealing with the
situation ... after Israel's reply to the Baker plan.''
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III last month submitted
a proposal for an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue mainly to discuss an
Israeli plan for Palestinian elections in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza. The elections would be to choose negotiators on interim
limited autonomy in the territories.
   Israel conditionally accepted Baker's proposal last weekend. It
demanded assurances the PLO would not play any role and the agenda
would be confined to Israel's election plan. Israel rejects the PLO
as a terrorist organization.
   PLO officials insist the organization must be a full partner and
choose its delegates and that the dialogue agenda be unrestricted.

   Sudan has halted the U.N. famine-relief
operation in its southern provinces because of renewed fighting
with rebels in the region, officials said Wednesday.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said any prolonged
suspension of aid to southern Sudan, where about 250,000 people
died of starvation in 1987, ``would result in severe food shortages
and the interruption of critical immunization and health programs.''
   Officials of Operation Lifeline Sudan, intended to prevent more
starvation in the region, confirmed that Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan
el-Bashir's government had suspended relief flights, rail shipments
and distribution by barges.
   In April, the government and rebels of the Sudan People's
Liberation Army agreed to a truce so relief supplies to be
delivered by the U.N. operation. El-Bashir, who ousted the elected
government of Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi on June 30, had
promised to end the war.
   The truce generally held until last month, when the government
said rebels seized the town of Kurmuk.
   Planes bombed two rebel-held towns in the south after the Kurmuk
battle and the rebels blamed the government, which did not respond
to the charge.
   Operation Lifeline Sudan saved over 200,000 Sudanese civilians
this year by moving 107,000 tons of food in the south before the
rainy season isolated villages.
   Perez de Cuellar said he is ``greatly concerned'' about the
suspension because the operation can only be successful ``if its
air, road and river transport is assured of an unfettered access to
strategic distribution points.''
   Both sides were accused in 1987 of using food as a weapon and
causing even more people to starve.
   Rebels led by former army Col. John Garang have fought
Moslem-dominated central governments since 1983 for greater
autonomy and economic reforms in the south, populated by blacks who
are predominantly Christian or animist.

<HEAD>New York Gallery Refuses to Relinquish Arts Endowment Grant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York City gallery Wednesday rejected a
request from the National Endowment for the Arts that it relinquish
a $10,000 federal grant for an AIDS art exhibition as a possible
violation of a new anti-obscenity statute.
   Endowment Chairman John E. Frohnmayer, informed of the gallery's
refusal, said that although the grant was approved last May, the
funds were never actually sent to the gallery and would be withheld
pending a legal opinion from the Justice Department.
   In a telephone interview, Frohnmayer said a review of the
catalog for the AIDS exhibition made clear that ``the nature of the
show had changed from an artistic focus to a political focus.''
   The $30,000 show is sponsored by Artists Space, a private,
non-profit arts institution in Manhattan, where it is scheduled to
open Nov. 16. Frohnmayer said the gallery refused to accept his
contention that ``the show was primarily a political statement and
that it would not be appropriate to take endowment money for its
support.''
   Susan Wyatt, executive director of Artists Space, said
Frohnmayer was informed Wednesday of the unanimous decision by the
gallery's 23 board members to refuse the NEA's request to
relinquish the grant. She denied that the focus of the exhibition
had changed from art to politics.
   Frohnmayer also had asked the gallery, in a letter dated Nov. 3,
to publish a disclaimer stating that ``the National Endowment for
the Arts has not supported this exhibition or its catalog.''
   The controversy over the AIDS show, titled ``Witness: Against
Our Vanishing,'' illustrated the dilemma that Frohnmayer faces in
trying to support the arts community while enforcing a
congressional ban on federal support for works that ``may be
considered obscene.''
   Ms. Wyatt said the AIDS show, which portrays the effects of the
disease on the artistic community, contains some images of male and
female nudity and ``deals with sexuality in the context of AIDS,''
although that is not the primary emphasis.
   The law which Congress passed last month at the urging of Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., specifically prohibits federal support for
``depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual
exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts,'' and
materials that lack serious artistic value.
   The legislation was prompted by Helms' criticism of $45,000 in
endowment grants that supported exhibitions of controversial
photographs by the Andres Serrano and the late Robert Mapplethorpe,
whose show included homoerotic images.
   In his Nov. 3 letter to Ms. Wyatt, Frohnmayer said that ``given
our recent review, and the current political climate, I believe
that the use of endowment funds to exhibit or publish this work is
in violation of the spirit of the congressional directive.''
   He said that ``certain texts, photographs and other
representations in the exhibition may offend the language'' of the
new law.
   ``Because of the recent criticism the endowment has come under
and the seriousness of Congress' directive, we must all work
together to ensure that projects funded by the endowment do not
violate either the spirit or the letter of the law,'' he wrote.
   ``The message has been clearly and strongly conveyed to us that
Congress means business.''
   In his interview, Frohnmayer said he particularly objected to
portions of the AIDS show's catalog which he said contained ``very
hostile, angry and accusatory'' statements and ``very politically
pointed commentary'' about Helms and other critics of controversial
art and the AIDS cause.
   Ms. Wyatt said the gallery board, in refusing to relinquish the
endowment grant, was ``taking a stand against censorship and
self-censorship.''
   ``We believe this is a show that should be funded by the
endowment,'' she said in a telephone interview from New York. ``It
is a very regrettable thing that the endowment has been forced to
take this stand by Congress in this political climate we are seeing
today.''
   She rejected as ``totally erroneous'' Frohnmayer's contention
that the exhibition is primarily political.
   ``This is not a show about politics,'' she said. ``It's a show
about AIDS.''

   The government put army ambulances on the streets
of London Wednesday night after regular ambulance crews, embroiled
in a pay dispute, said they would handle emergency calls only.
   An eight-week work-to-rule dispute escalated Tuesday when 2,500
regular ambulance crewmen and women in charge of 455 ambulances at
71 ambulance depots were suspended without pay because of their
refusal to handle all calls.
   Calls for ambulances were rerouted to police and volunteer
ambulance crews, with 51 army ambulances mobilized Wednesday night
to assist.
   The last time army ambulances were used was during the wave of
public service pay strikes in the winter of 1978-79.
   Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke said in an interview with
British Broadcasting Corp. radio that he regretted calling on the
army but that the unions ``are still insisting on 11.4 percent .. .
and they are prepared to take industrial action in support of
that.''
   The government has offered a pay increase of 6.5 percent.
   Ambulance staff now earn just over $16,900 a year after five
years on the job. The crews have asked the government to agree to
arbitration.
   Chris Humphreys, senior London officer for National Union of
Public Employees, pleaded with Clarke not to deploy army ambulances.
   ``I have confirmed that ambulance staff will respond and not
place any restrictions on the use of the radio in respect of all
999 calls, all calls for urgent assistance and queries,'' Humphreys
said. The 999 code is the telephone number for ambulance and other
emergency services in Britain.
   Clarke has said army ambulances will be withdrawn only when
union leaders agreed to resumption of normal ambulance services.

<TEXT>
   A former Marine and Air Force
communications officer who told federal officials he wanted to be a
double agent after meeting with Soviet agents was indicted
Wednesday on espionage charges.
   Charles Nesbitt, 44, who had top secret clearance, passed on
secrets to Soviet agents and conspired with them, officials alleged.
   A statement issued by Henry E. Hudson, U.S. Attorney in northern
Virginia, and Jay B. Stephens, U.S. Attorney for the District of
Columbia, said Nesbitt was charged with two counts of espionage.
   If convicted, Nesbitt faces a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment and a fine of $500,000.
   Federal agents arrested Nesbitt Oct. 14 at a hotel in McLean, Va.
   Nesbitt, formerly of Memphis, Tenn., left his family and a
computer job last June and traveled to Central and South America,
he said in an interview with The Washington Post last month.
   The indictment revealed that Nesbitt met with Soviet agents in
Bolivia and Peru, where he was given a plane ticket to Moscow.
Nesbitt told the newspaper that he did not give the Soviets
anything useful during his 11-day stay in their country.
   In his newspaper interview, Nesbitt said he was given an initial
payment of $2,000 and was promised between $50,000 and $100,000
depending on his assignments.
   When he returned from the Soviet Union, he was debriefed by the
FBI, and he offered his services as a spy, according to his account.
   He said he entered the Air Force shortly after finishing high
school in Oregon and served from 1963 to 1966, and served in the
Marines from 1969 to 1979.

   Helicopter crews on Wednesday
rescued the last of 51 people aboard a gas-drilling platform 10
minutes before it toppled and capsized in the North Sea, the coast
guard said.
   The Interocean II platform was being towed by two ships from a
drilling point off Britain to the Netherlands when one of the
vessels' lines snapped in gale-force winds 75 miles northeast of
Great Yarmouth in eastern England, a coast guard spokesman said.
   Authorities dispatched two Royal Air Force helicopters and two
commercial helicopters, which airlifted the last of the 51 crew
just minutes before the platform tipped into the sea, said the
spokesman on condition of anonymity.
   Eight workers had intended to stay behind, but decided to
abandon the platform at the last moment, the spokesman said.
   The platform was operated by the Houston-based Interocean
Steamship Corp., and was on contract to Texaco North Sea, a Texaco
spokesman said.

<HEAD>Bush Gets Bill Authorizing Japanese-American Reparations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Wednesday completed
congressional action on legislation appropriating $17.2 billion for
the State, Justice and Commerce departments and guaranteeing
reparations payments to Japanese-Americans interned in World War II.
   The legislation, which was approved on a voice vote, was sent to
the White House where President Bush's signature is expected.
   The bill fulfills a commitment to Japanese-Americans made in
1988 legislation that authorized reparations payments for their
internment but provided no money.
   It provides $20,000 for each of the estimated 60,000 living
Japanese-Americans interned in the camps after the Japanese attack
on Pearl Harbor.
   The payments, expected to total about $1.2 billion, would begin
next Oct. 1 and be spread out over three fiscal years at a rate of
about $500 million a year.
   Rep. Norm Mineta, D-Calif., a principal sponsor of the
reparations legislation, said the Senate vote tells the American
people that ``we will keep this most important promise.''
   ``It is a great milestone and heartening victory for those who
have struggled for more than 47 years to redress the injustices
which 120,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry were forced to endure
by the U.S. government during the Second World War,'' said Mineta,
who as a child was confined to one of the camps with his parents.
   The Senate left one knot untied in its handling of the overall
House-Senate conference report which resolved differences between
the two bills.
   It left in doubt the scale of appropriations for the State
Department during the 1990 fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1.
   By law, the State Department cannot receive new appropriations
until Congress passes an authorization bill.
   That legislation is bogged down in a House-Senate conference and
it is not clear when it will emerge.
   The Senate last week refused to waive the section of the law
requiring an authorization bill to be passed.
   Members of the Appropriations Committee said that State
Department spending would be frozen at the lower levels that
prevailed during the last fiscal year until the authorization bill
clears all hurdles, including the possibility of a veto by Bush,
who objects to some of its provisions.
   The bill also contains the lion's share _ $7.6 billion _ of the
funds to be made available to wage the war on drugs. An additional
$1.9 billion, representing a drug-war compromise between Congress
and the White House, is contained in a transportation
appropriations bill.
   The final version of the bill formally repeals a law imposing
economic sanctions against Argentina. The sanctions, imposed at the
height of human rights abuses during a period of military rule,
were withdrawn by former President Reagan in 1983 after Argentina's
return to democratic rule. But until now they were never officially
expunged.
   Also included in the measure is a provision creating a formula
to guarantee that small states receive some share of the anti-drug
funds contained in the bill.
   Among many other provisions is one establishing an FBI databank
containing so-called DNA profiles of convicted felons. DNA is
genetic material that law enforcement agencies are just beginning
to use like fingerprints for identification of individuals.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said the new crime-fighting tool would
be similar to the FBI's national fingerprint file and the contents
will be shared with state and local law enforcement agencies. The
measure also provides $500,000 to enable the FBI to expand its
training of DNA typing technicians.

<TEXT>
   Nicaragua put forth a plan Wednesday
for demobilizing Contra rebels and offered to suspend arms imports
in exchange.
   The Soviet Union said last May it stopped shipping arms to
Nicaragua at the end of 1988, but Paul Wolfowitz, a U.S. Defense
Department undersecretary, said last week other Soviet bloc nations
and Cuba continued sending weapons.
   President Daniel Ortega told a news conference his decision last
week to end a cease-fire after 19 months had opened the way to
peace between the leftist Sandinista government and U.S.-supported
rebels.
   He said Nicaragua would forgo arms imports until April 25, 1990,
if the 15-point plan was accepted.
   President Bush on Wednesday promised to lift the trade embargo
against Nicaragua if the U.S.-backed presidential candidate,
Violeta Chamorro, defeats Ortega in elections set for Feb. 25.
   His statement came after a Washington meeting in which Mrs.
Chamorro asked Bush for aid to help with economic reconstruction
after the election and the two agreed on the need to muster
international support for fair elections, according to U.S. and
Nicaraguan participants.
   In their proposal Wednesday, the Sandinistas urge that the
United States divert to demobilization what remains of $49 million
in non-lethal aid to the Contras authorized by Congress in March.
The aid includes such items as boots, tents and uniforms.
   The 12,000 rebels, some in Nicaragua and most camped in
neighboring Honduras, are to be disbanded by early December under
the regional peace agreement signed Aug. 7 by Ortega and the
presidents of Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Guatemala.
   ``If the Contras don't accept this plan, they will be voting for
war,'' Ortega said in apparent reference to the cease-fire
cancellation and fighting reported since.
   He said he would demand a meeting of the Central American
presidents to discuss the situation if the Contras rejected his
proposals.
   Ortega said he had instructed his government's five-member
delegation not to leave the two-day meeting with the Contras at
U.N. headquarters in New York without a signed agreement.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, Roman Catholic archbishop of
Managua, will be present at the meeting, which begins Thursday.
   Honduras said it would send an observer delegation that might
participate more actively after the meeting began. Military
commander Enrique Bermudez leads the Contra delegation.
   The Sandinista plan repeats some points of the Aug. 7 agreement
and sets forth the role of the International Commission for
Verification and Support, a joint agency of the United Nations and
Organization of American States formed to supervise and verify
demobilization.
   It offers to withdraw Sandinista military forces from routes the
Contras use to travel between Honduras and Nicaragua so rebels in
Nicaragua can return to their Honduran camps, and to reinstate the
cease-fire Nov. 30.
   As incentives, the Sandinistas offer to release all political
prisoners under a general amnesty after at least half the Contras
have been demobilized and any Nicaraguans kidnapped by the rebels
have been freed.
   An annex to the document deals with the government's offers to
guarantee respect for the rights of Contras who return to civilian
life in Nicaragua.
   Contra leaders have demanded unconditional amnesty.
   Ortega declared that, before he decided to suspend the
cease-fire, ``there were no hopes for peace. ... Now the situation
has changed favorably.''
   The Sandinistas and Contras agreed to a 90-day truce in March
1988, during their last direct negotiations. After the talks broke
down in June of that year, Ortega's government renewed the
cease-fire on a monthly basis and the Contras tacitly accepted it.
   Ortega said in declaring an end to the cease-fire that thousands
of Contras had infiltrated Nicaragua and were making attacks. The
rebels denied it.
   Military mobilization began with his announcement and fighting
was reported in parts of the country, but the Defense Ministry has
given few details.

<HEAD>Oil Slick Southbound on Mississippi; Hundreds of Barges Stalled at
Lock</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A three-mile-long oil slick snaked down the Iowa shore of the
Mississippi River on Wednesday, while 86 tow boats pushing more
than a thousand barges were backed up 300 miles south at a lock in
Illinois, officials said.
   The slick was reported Wednesday morning by a LeClaire, Iowa,
resident who found ducks coated with foul-smelling slime, said
police Chief David Kuhn.
   ``Those ducks are goners,'' Kuhn said of the 15 to 20 birds.
   Residents of the town, about 10 miles north of Bettendorf, Iowa,
feared more ducks would be endangered as they flocked to the
village to feed.
   The spill involved only 100 to 200 gallons of lubricating oil,
said Ensign Jane Wong of the U.S. Coast Guard in St. Louis.
   ``You don't have to have very much oil to have a sheen on the
water,'' Ms. Wong explained, adding the spill had not threatened
any water supplies.
   A contractor was hired to contain the spill with booms and
remove it, she said.
   ``Right now the weather itself is containing the spill,'' Ms.
Wong said Wednesday afternoon, referring to a lack of strong wind.
   The source of the spill was believed to be a boat or a barge,
said Dick Vons, an aide to Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad. The Coast
Guard was investigating the source.
   Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson said it was ``probably one of
the smallest spills that we've experienced in Illinois or in the
Midwest'' and said crews were cleaning it up less than four hours
after it was spotted.
   As the spill slithered downstream, about 1,200 barges were
converged on Lock and Dam 26 at Alton, Ill., waiting in a 36-mile
line to get through. The jam-up was not related to the oil slick.
   The two-week delay was blamed partly on a temporary gate on the
main lock chamber that broke from wear and tear and had to be
repaired, said Billie Sanna, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers worker
at Alton.
   ``We always get this backlog each year,'' she said, adding that
the gate shutdown increased the congestion only slightly.
   ``Every year come September and October because the river
freezes up above, they try to get it (the barges) out of there,''
Sanna said.

   Democrats savored off-year election success in ``everything, all
over the country'' Wednesday, while blacks and abortion rights
groups celebrated L. Douglas Wilder's likely victory as governor of
Virginia and David Dinkins' triumph as New York's new mayor.
   ``It's a very tough day for Republicans,'' conceded Rep. Newt
Gingrich, the GOP whip in the House. Said President Bush: ``Wait
till next year.''
   Republican J. Marshall Coleman declared his intention to seek a
recount in Virginia's close race, saying there must be public
confidence in the election outcome ``for the good of the new
governor.'' Coleman said Wilder, if victorious, would have his full
support.
   But Wilder _ leader by about 5,500 votes in complete, unofficial
returns from Tuesday's balloting _ wasn't waiting to stake his
claim to history as the nation's first elected black governor.
   ``It starts coming home to you, something happened last night,''
he said.
   Asked whether the color of his skin had mattered, he told a news
conference, ``I'm saying it is not and was not a factor in the
results because I was elected.''
   Jesse Jackson said Wilder's trailblazing campaign was ``a little
sweeter'' coming as it did in the South, and predicted it would
pave the way for other black politicians to win seats elsewhere in
the old Confederacy.
   Dinkins went to City Hall in New York where he will soon take
office as the first black mayor of the nation's largest city. ``I
got a pretty fair percentage of the white vote, and I think that's
very important,'' said the man who pledged to bring racial harmony
to his city.
   He said voters had spoken ``with the voice of hope, here and in
Virginia.''
   In New Jersey, Democratic Rep. James Florio celebrated his
personal victory as governor after two previous campaign defeats.
Democrats savored regaining the state's top job after eight years
as well as two-house control in the state legislature, assuring
them the upper hand when the state's congressional districts are
reapportioned after the 1990 census.
   The Republican post-mortem was in progress, even before the
final precinct tallies were known.
   Gingrich said his party must be ``willing to rethink exactly
what we're going to do in 1990 if we're going to have a successful
year'' when 34 Senate seats, 36 governorships and all 435 House
seats are on the ballot.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, of Oregon, a liberal Republican with a strong
pro-choice voting record, said, ``If we go in 1990 and abortion is
the issue ... we will lose on that issue.''
   Abortion rights groups read the returns the same way.
   ``This morning's election results are a wake up call for George
Bush,'' an opponent of abortion, said Kate Michelman, executive
director of the National Abortion Rights Action League. ``To
politicians everywhere, we say with conviction: If you're out of
touch with the pro-choice majority, you're out of office.''
   There were pre-1990 stirrings in Massachusetts, where GOP
gubernatorial hopeful William Weld joined about 20 state
legislators of both parties in signing a petition for a state
constitutional amendment to make abortion and birth control a
woman's prerogative.
   Among the group was a Republican state legislator, Rep. Lucile
Hicks, who predicted ``you will see a change in the position our
national leaders will take in this issue.''
   Tuesday's elections were the first widespread voting since the
Supreme Court's ruling last summer permitting states to impose
restrictions on women seeking abortions. The topic became an issue
in all three of the closely watched races, and Democrats put their
anti-abortion rivals on the defensive in each of them.
   ``There's no way for the Republican Party to find any silver
lining at all in what happened yesterday,'' said Democratic
National Chairman Ron Brown.
   ``No time in my lifetime do I ever remember waking up the
morning after an election where one party had won everything, all
over the country.''
   ``The Democrats are on a roll,'' said Rep. Beryl Anthony of
Arkansas, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee.
   ``We have recruited better candidates. Our candidates have
better mainstream messages. And the voters are responding.''
   Coleman called a news conference to announce that if the
official tally in Virginia shows the candidates separated by less
than one half of one percent _ a certainty based on unofficial
figures _ ``it is my intention to ask for a recount.''
   Wilder said at his own news conference he was confident of the
outcome. ``The mandate is that in Virginia we are prepared to move
and we don't care what that person looks like,'' he said.
   Returns from 99 percent of the precincts in New York gave
Dinkins 50 percent of the vote, to 48 percent for Republican
Rudolph Giuliani.
   In New Jersey, Florio had 61 percent of the vote to 37 percent
to Rep. James Courter with 98 percent of the precincts tallied.
   In a Texas contest, a runoff shaped up between two Democrats,
state Sen. Craig Washington and Houston City Councilman Anthony
Hall, to fill the unexpired term of the late Rep. Mickey Leland, a
Democrat.
   While the national attention was riveted to Virginia, New York
and New Jersey, much of Tuesday's action was in the nation's cities.
   Coleman Young, 71, won an unprecedented fifth term as mayor of
Detroit, defeating 40-year-old Tom Barrow for the second time.
Houston Mayor Kathy Whitmire won her fifth term and Miami Mayor
Xavier Suarez his third.
   Democrat John Daniels was elected mayor of New Haven, becoming
the first black mayor of his majority-white city, while City
Councilman Norm Rice defeated busing foe Doug Jewett to gain a
similar distinction in Seattle.
   Ohio state Sen. Michael R. White defeated his old mentor, City
Council President George Forbes, in a bitter contest between two
black Democrats to succeed retiring Republican Mayor George
Voinovich as mayor of Cleveland.

   Four hundred police surged onto the campus of
San Marcos University's medical school on Wednesday, seizing bombs
and leftist propaganda and detaining hundreds of people as soldiers
sealed off the area, police said.
   University rector Jaime Rey de Castro said around 500 people
were arrested. The government would not confirm the number.
   It was the largest police incursion onto a university campus in
the capital since April, when 518 people were arrested in a similar
crackdown.
   Students, teachers and university workers were detained
Wednesday, along with people not related to the university,
officers said.
   Classes have been suspended until after nationwide municipal
elections Sunday.
   Police said they confiscated sticks of dynamite, firebombs,
propaganda and maps of Lima districts marked with the location of
voting districts.
   The main San Marcos campus was invaded Monday by police looking
for rebels who attacked the nearby National Society of Industries
headquarters. Eighty people were arrested then and police seized
revolvers and grenades.
   The government says the campus serves as a ground for recruiting
and organizing by leftist rebels, and a storehouse for arms used in
attacks in the capital.
   Maoist Shining Path rebels have waged a violent campaign to
sabotage Sunday's elections, assassinating 120 mayors, candidates
and local officials the past 10 months. More than 330 people died
in political violence last month, one of the bloodiest months in
the Shining Path's 9-year-old insurgency.
   Police said Wednesday that 27 rebels were captured in Ica
department, 185 miles south of Lima.
   The 438-year-old San Marcos University is the oldest university
in the Western Hemisphere. More than 40,000 students use its two
campuses, including about 6,000 in the medical school.

<HEAD>State Police Taping Policy Examined In Court</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   WATERBURY, Conn. _ A defense lawyer trying to expose details of
a state police policy of secretly taping telephone conversations
between suspects and their attorneys grilled a trooper at a
manslaughter trial Wednesday.
   In another development, U.S. Rep. John Rowland, a Republican who
plans to run for governor, called on Gov. William A. O'Neill to
abandon a state investigation of the matter, and cooperate fully
with a parallel probe by the FBI.
   Attorney Hugh Keefe questioned Trooper Chris Garrity, who
inadvertently revealed the policy's existence last month, and said
he would subpoena higher-ranking officials until the policy is
explained.
   ``We're going right up the line,'' said the New Haven attorney.
``If we don't get adequate answers, satisfactory answers, we'll go
to the top.''
   The policy of taping calls into and out of state police
barracks, including calls made by suspects to their lawyers, was
described in The Hartford Courant on Tuesday. O'Neill ordered an
immediate end to the practice and launched the state investigation.
   The Courant's story sent shock waves through courthouses across
the state. Outraged defense attorneys predicted that scores of
criminal cases would be affected and that state officials could
face heavy penalties if it's found they violated state or federal
wiretapping laws.
   Rep. Rowland said in a statement issued by his office in
Washington that the state probe of ``this sorry situation'' should
be dropped because it would lack credibility in the eyes of the
public.
   Asked for a response to Rowland's statement, O'Neill spokesman
Jon Sandberg said, ``The governor has made his position perfectly
clear. He is not in the business of responding to other
gubernatorial candidates.''
   O'Neill earlier said he was anxious to talk to Public Safety
Commissioner Lester J. Forst, who as state police commander is
responsible for the policy. Forst is on a hunting trip in Alaska.
   In Hartford, the governor said he had no plans to fire Forst,
but said, ``All commissioners serve at my pleasure. We're all
replaceable, it's just a question of when.''
   In Waterbury, Garrity testified in the trial of Waterbury police
detective Robert Little on drunken-driving and manslaughter charges.
   Garrity said he originally thought all phone calls from police
barracks were taped, but now is not sure what the policy is.
   ``If you believe these troopers, they don't know the extent of
the system,'' said Keefe.
   During a pretrial hearing Oct. 24, Garrity mentioned the
practice of taping all phone calls from state police barracks,
including calls Little made to his attorney the night he was
arrested.
   In subsequent testimony, Garrity backed off from his original
description of the policy. He has said calls are randomly selected
to be taped, but has also said he's not sure which calls are taped.
   Sgt. Richard Sealander, a state police spokesman, lent credence
to Garrity's initial description when he confirmed in the Courant's
story that a policy exists of recording calls from barracks,
including calls by suspects.
   Keefe on Wednesday asked Garrity, ``If Sergeant Sealander said
that every conversation were taped, would you agree with that?''
   Garrity replied, ``If that's what he said, yes I would.''

   U.S. negotiators expressed disappointment
Wednesday with the lack of progress in deregulating Japanese
financial markets to allow greater participation by American and
other foreign investment firms.
   Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford, who headed the American
team in top-level trade talks, said that the U.S. side had
discussed ``concerns and disappointments in the lack of progress in
some fundamental areas'' during the day-long session.
   However, Makoto Utsumi, the Japanese vice minister of finance,
who appeared with Mulford at a joint press conference Wednesday
night, said his country had made significant progress in
deregulating its financial markets.
   ``We believe we have been steadily making progress and we intend
to do so in the future,'' he told reporters.
   Both sides agreed to establish a working group to explore
technical questions before their next formal meeting in the spring.
   Japan, whose citizens save at more than double the U.S. savings
rate, has long been an enticing potential market for U.S. banks and
securities firms.
   The discussions began six years ago and have focused on such
issues as allowing American and other foreign banks and brokerage
firms to do business in Japan. Other issues have revolved around
the removal of interest rate caps in Japan and other proposals.
   Mulford noted some progress: 50 percent of Japanese savings
deposits are no longer covered by interest rate limits.
   He said the Japanese government was still resisting attempts by
American firms to offer an expanded range of investment services to
Japanese investors even though they have a ``proven track record''
worldwide.
   As the talks go forward, Mulford said U.S. negotiators would
also be pushing for the removal of barriers that keep individual
Japanese from moving their investments overseas.
   The meeting Wednesday followed discussions Monday and Tuesday on
structural barriers to trade, such as Japan's antiquated wholesale
and retail distribution system and the close ties that Japanese
companies maintain with each other.
   At the end of those talks, U.S. officials said they were
disappointed that the Japanese negotiators had not been willing to
change various business practices that are widely believed to limit
imports into Japan.
   Both the financial market discussions and the wider talks on
structural trade barriers are aimed at reducing the huge $50
billion trade deficit that the United States is running with Japan,
a deficit that this year will account for almost half of America's
total trade imbalance.

   Subway workers and bus drivers
went on strike Wednesday to press pay demands, stranding hundreds
of thousands of commuters.
   Union spokesman Juan Palacios said 75,000 workers participated
in the walkout, the worst since President Carlos Menem took office
four months ago. The effectiveness of the strike caught the
government by surprise and demonstrated wages remain an obstacle to
plans to reform Argentina's economy.
   Menem went on national television and radio Wednesday night to
denounce the strike as ``irresponsible,'' calling it ``an act of
abuse'' by both unionists and businessmen.
   ``This government is going to remain firm in its direction. This
government is a strong government. It has immense power, which it
is going to use,'' he said without elaborating.
   Labor Minister Jorge Triaca said if an agreement between drivers
and bus owners was not reached Wednesday, he would order compulsory
arbitration during which drivers must work. The union said it would
continue the strike.
   On Tuesday, drivers parked their buses at intersections in this
densely populated city of 10 million, deflated the tires and walked
away. Many had just been paid and were angry at how little they
received.
   A strike by signalmen on commuter train lines was declared
illegal by the ministry, and teachers who boycotted classes last
month were docked pay. University professors, doctors, court clerks
and public employees in many provinces have staged strikes to
demand more pay.
   Menem's tough labor policies run counter to his Peronist Party's
traditional backing for organized labor, which was a base for his
electoral support.
   Organized labor in this heavily unionized South American nation
of 31 million claims Menem is forcing workers to bear the brunt of
sacrifices the government says are essential to curtail chronic
inflation and the massive deficits of companies run by the state.
   Bus drivers who were paid about $86 for October are demanding
$32 more and a base pay of $139 for November and December.
   Bus owners are offering a monthly pay of about $100 through
March.
   The government brought inflation down to 5.6 percent last month
from 197 percent in July by devaluation, massive increases in
public service rates and wage and price guidelines. It is offering
an increase of $16 a month to public employees.
   Projecting inflation at a steady 2 percent a month beginning in
November, government officials have told private businesses that
any increase higher than 15 percent through March may not be added
to prices.
   Employees at the state oil and telephone companies, anticipating
layoffs and wage cuts, have protested Menem's privatization plans
that aim to attract foreign investment and reduce the national
budget deficit.
   Collective wage bargaining with metal workers, perhaps the
country's strongest and best paid union, has stalled, and unions
representing the majority of employees at public ministries walked
out of contract talks two weeks ago.
   Groups representing industrial and farm groups meanwhile have
complained of a pending tax increase and the reduction of tariff
barriers that would expose their products to foreign competition.

<TEXT>
   A container ship and a
British-bound passenger ship carrying nearly 400 people collided
Wednesday night at the mouth of the Elbe River, and officials said
three people were killed and up to 10 injured.
   The ferry Hamburg was struck from behind in heavy seas by the
container ship Nordic Stream, said officials for Scandinavian
Seaways, the Danish owners of the ferry. They said the impact
occurred near a shipboard lounge that is usually crowded with
passengers.
   ``Three people have been killed, we don't know at the moment if
they were passengers or crew,'' a Scandinavian Seaways spokeswoman
said in London.
   The 10:15 p.m. accident occurred near Cuxhaven, about 60 miles
northwest of Hamburg at the entrance to the North Sea.
   Harbor police in this industrial northern city said the
475-foot-long ferry had been bound for Harwich, Britain. The Sea
Rescue station in Cuxhaven said the Nordic Stream had been steaming
into the Elbe channel bound for Hamburg.
   The Scandinavian Seaways spokeswoman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the ferry was carrying 277 passengers, most of them
West Germans and Britons, and a crew of 96. There were no
indications any Americans were on board the ship.
   Officials in Hamburg said preliminary reports indicated the
ferry was carrying 278 passengers.
   The harbor watch in Hamburg said the victims had been recovered
from the ferry.
   A dispatcher at the Cuxhaven station, who asked not to be
further identified, earlier said two people were killed and
``between five and 10'' injured.
   He said a storm warning had been in effect at the time of the
accident with high winds and seas.
   The Cuxhaven station said helicopters and two navy ships had
been dispatched to the scene.
   Officials in Hamburg said a hole was punched in the ferry above
the waterline and that it remained seaworthy. The container ship
was only slightly damaged, according to preliminary reports from
the Hamburg harbor watch.
   The ferry was expected to make its way back to the West German
port of Bremerhaven early Thursday. The ferry sails every two days
between Hamburg and Harwich.
   On March 6, 1987, 193 people died when the British passenger
ferry Herald of Free Enterprise capsized outside the Belgian North
Sea port of Zeebrugge.
   The Herald of Free Enterprise capsized after it began to take in
water through bow loading doors that had been left open.

   Former President Reagan and his wife Nancy
will visit the White House next week for the unveiling of their
portraits.
   The ceremonies will be held next Wednesday in the State Room,
followed by a reception, deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk said
Wednesday.
   It will be the Reagans' first return visit since exiting the
White House last Jan. 20.
   Both Reagans' portraits were painted by New York artist Aaron
Shikler. The oil paintings were commissioned by the White House
Historical Association, a private group.
   Shikler redid Reagan's portrait after Mrs. Reagan expressed
dissatisfaction with the initial effort.
   The Reagan portrait was completed in August and originally was
to be unveiled in September, but it was delayed when Reagan
underwent surgery at the Mayo Clinic for a head injury suffered
over the summer when he was thrown from a horse.
   Mrs. Reagan has already provided a glimpse of the portraits in
her newly published memoirs, ``My Turn.''

<HEAD>U.S., Britain Blocked Italian War Crimes Trials, Says Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Official documents traced by an American
researcher show Britain and the United States blocked the trials of
hundreds of Italian World War II criminals, according to a
television documentary Wednesday night.
   The collusion, prompted by fears of unsettling Italy's postwar
anti-Communist government, meant about 800 Italians listed by the
U.N. War Crimes Commission escaped trial, the British Broadcasting
Corp. program said.
   Most were wanted for atrocities in Yugoslavia during occupation
by the Italian army, which was allied in the conflict with Germany
from 1939 to 1943. and in Ethiopia.
   The suspects included Marshal Pietro Badoglio, leader of the
Italian administration formed after the fall of fascist dictator
Benito Mussolini in 1943. Italy then changed sides in the war.
   Ethiopia pressed for Badoglio to be tried on charges of ordering
the use of poison gas and bombing Red Cross hospitals after Italy
invaded the east African territory in 1936.
   One British document showed the Foreign Office countered in a
1945 memorandum that Badoglio had ``rendered valuable assistance to
the Allies.''
   Badoglio, who died in 1956, was never tried.
   Among the Yugoslav charges were that Italian soldiers set up
concentration camps in which hundreds of people died and that
Serbian, Moslem and Croatian units under Italian control murdered
prisoners of war.
   The program, titled ``The Fascist Legacy: A Pledge Betrayed,''
was based mainly on documents traced by an American researcher and
graduate of the City University of New York, Michael Palumbo.
   Palumbo said he assembled the material on the Italians from
documents in the Public Records Office in London, in the U.N. War
Crimes Commission files and in the U.S. National Archives in
Washington.
   ``These documents show that the British and American allies had
engaged in a policy of stalling, deceiving and blocking the
extradition of hundreds of Italian war criminals who they knew were
guilty of enormous atrocities in Africa and the Balkans,'' he said
on the program.
   A spokesman at the Italian Embassy said the ambassador, Boris
Biancheri, had protested to the BBC about the program on grounds it
singled out Italy.
   Documents quoted on the program indicated British and U.S.
officials accepted the listed Italians were guilty but, in the
words of one Foreign Office document, prosecutions would be
``politically embarrassing.''
   ``Justice requires the handing over of these people,'' said a
document quoted on the program as being signed by an official of
the war crimes sections of the Foreign Office, R.A. Beaumont.
``Expediency, I fear, militates against it, or at least the handing
over of some highly placed ones.''
   A 1946 U.S. report from the Combined Civil Affairs Committee of
the Combined Chiefs of Staff stated, ``The claims of the Yugoslav
government that offenses of the type charged were in fact committee
is corroborated by reports of the Office of Strategic Services (the
predecessor of the CIA).''
   Other memorandum quoted include a British Foreign Office report
that ``the State Department considers that the best action for both
governments would be to attempt to stall.''

<DATELINE>RED CLOUD, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mildred Bennett, an authority on
Pultizer-Prize winning novelist Willa Cather, has died of lung
cancer. She was 80.
   She died Tuesday at the Webster County Community Hospital.
   Mrs. Bennett, who delved into Cather's life after moving here to
the writer's hometown in 1946, guided the Willa Cather Pioneer
Memorial and Educational Foundation that was formed in 1955. She
wrote a biography of Cather and published a collection of early
Cather stories written before 1912. Cather published ``O
Pioneers!'' in 1913 and ``My Antonia'' in 1918.
   Mrs. Bennett's interest in Cather began in 1932 when she was the
new school teacher in the tiny town of Inavale, located in the
heart of the farming country described in Cather's novels.
   Many of her pupils were the children and grandchildren of the
people Cather immortalized in her Nebraska stories.
   Mrs. Bennett's foundation created a ``living museum'' of nearly
50 sites in Red Cloud and the surrounding countryside that are
points of historical interest in Cather's life and stories.
   Thousands of visitors travel to Red Cloud each year to visit the
restored sites and the Willa Cather Memorial Prairie, 610 acres of
mixed-grass virgin prairie.
   ``Never underestimate what one person can do,'' said Ron Hull,
associate general manager of the Nebraska ETV Network in Lincoln
and a foundation board member who was working with Mrs. Bennett on
a documentary about Red Cloud and Cather.
   ``Mildred Bennett decided that she was going to honor Willa
Cather in the early `50s so she called in some of her close friends
in Red Cloud to her kitchen and they decided to start the
memorial,'' Hull said.
   ``What she started is an important part of Nebraska and its
history and will be more important as time goes by.''
   In 1951, Mrs. Bennett published ``The World of Willa Cather,''
one of the authoritative books about the early life of Cather, and
``Early Stories of Willa Cather'' in 1957.
   Survivors include her husband, Dr. Wilbur Bennett. Arrangements
for services were incomplete.

   A West German fugitive befriended three West
Germans and two Danes in Mexico in a series of encounters last
summer, killed them and robbed them of credit cards and traveler's
checks, authorities said Wednesday.
   The attorney general's office said in a news release that Diego
Bohmer Detmar, 38, was arrested Tuesday at his home in the Pacific
resort of Acapulco along with his girlfriend, Eva Maria Kroker Geb
Moge, 35.
   The office said the girlfriend knew about the slayings and used
some of the credit cards herself.
   He was held on provisional charges of murder and illegal
possession of firearms and drugs. She was held on a provisional
charge of conspiracy.
   Both are to appear before a magistrate on Thursday.
   Assistant Attorney General Javier Coello Trejo told a news
briefing Bohmer Detmar was wanted in West Germany for falsifying
U.S. visas.
   Acapulco police said they confiscated a .22-caliber pistol,
boxes of ammunition, photos of Bohmer Detmar with the Danish
victims, cameras bearing victims' identification, receipts from
victims' credit cards and several ounces of marijuana when they
searched his house.
   Federal Judicial Police working with the international police
organization Interpol said they tracked the two by following a
trail of forged credit card signatures after victims were reported
missing.
   Coello Trejo said Bohmer Detmar fled West Germany in September
1988, going to the Netherlands and then France before moving to
Mexico this year.
   The body of one West German, Stefan Ferler, missing since July
14, was discovered near Pochutla in southern Oaxaca state on July
17.
   The attorney general's office and Coello Trejo gave this account:
   Ferler met Bohmer Detmar in Acapulco and the two traveled to
Oaxaca in a red Ford pickup. They smoked marijuana and drank.
   Bohmer Detmar shot Ferler, robbed the body, dumped it near
Pochutla and returned to Acapulco.
   On Aug. 12, two more bodies were found in the Pochutla area
where they had been buried secretly. They were identified as
Sebastian Hedemann, 25, a student of dentistry, and Katin Nicolaus,
27, a schoolteacher, both from Hamburg.
   The two had been missing since July 24. Medical examinations
showed both had been shot.
   Bohmer Detmar met them in Acapulco. Marijuana and liquor also
figured here.
   The bodies of Danish victims Preben Olsen and Lars Krause
Kristiansen were fished out of Majahual Lake in Veracruz state in
August, both shot.
   Coello Trejo said the two traveled with Bohmer Detmar, drinking
liquor and using hallucinogenic drugs. He said the three argued and
Bohmer Detmar shot them in their sleep, robbed the bodies and threw
them in the lake.
   Coello Trejo said Bohmer Detmar will undergo psychological
evaluation.
   He said no request has been received from West Germany for
extradition.
   Acapulco police stopped Bohmer Detmar this week after he was
involved in a traffic accident and began beating the other driver.
   Coello Trejo said Bohmer Detmar and Ms. Kroker Geb Moge met two
years ago in West Germany.

<HEAD>Short New Pinter Play Opens</HEAD>

   Harold Pinter's plays have sometimes bewildered
theatergoers. His newest, and shortest, ``Mountain Language,'' will
horrify some and mystify nobody. It's a denunciation of
totalitarianism.
   In 20 minutes and a few stark scenes, a police state is shown,
squashing individuals.
   ``Mountain Language,'' opened Wednesday at the off-Broadway CSC
Theater. It's paired with ``The Birthday Party,'' one of Pinter's
earliest plays from the late 1950s.
   Women in black winter coats stand along a bleak brick wall as
theatergoers enter. One of them, played by Wendy Makkena, says they
were told to arrive at 9 a.m. and it's now 5 p.m. Another woman,
played by Jean Stapleton, is admitted to a prison to visit her son.
She tries to tell him she has brought him bread and apples. A guard
forbids her to use her mountain language, the only one she knows.
For her attempts to use it, he beats her son, during a stage
blackout, and she dies of shock.
   Makkena sees her husband, a sack over his head, held by two
guards. Recordings play their thoughts of springtime at a lake.
``It's my right to see my husband,'' she says. A guard throws her
to the floor. She has no rights.
   ``The Birthday Party'' is fortunate in having Stapleton to play
Meg. As a frowsy, dim housewife, who sounds like her Edith Bunker
in TV's ``All in the Family'' but actually is very different,
Stapleton is hilarious. She makes serving her husband corn flakes a
true comic turn.
   Are they nice? She asks her husband.
   Yes, they are, responds Bill Moor, her perfect foil.
   He also gives his character some spine and dignity in an attempt
to stand up to two bullies who obviously have might on their side.
   Two men arrive and menace Stanley, the couple's boarder, played
gray-faced and timid by David Strathairn. The sense of fear the
audience feels comes from not knowing why Stanley is being
threatened or even if it's deserved.
   Richard Riehle plays McCann, the thug of the pair, who indicates
that perhaps Stanley has defected from the IRA. Stanley knows
immediately why they're there.
   Peter Riegert plays McCann's boss, whose smoothly civilized
speech is meant to mask the deeper evil. Riegert diminishes the
play's sense of fear and dread by not making his evil believable.
   Stapleton makes up for it by making Act 1 remarkably funny. This
doesn't overbalance the play; it makes a strong contrast between
mundane but valuable everyday life and existence in the terrible
shadow of force.
   Pinter wrote ``Mountain Language'' and ``The Birthday Party''
three decades apart. It's obvious they are related. They're
directed by Carey Perloff, artistic director of CSC.

in either incidents.
   On Wednesday, suspected Moslem rebels attacked a convoy of
Austrian engineers outside the city of Marawi, 510 miles southeast
of Manila, killing two of them. At least three other Austrians and
two Filipinos were wounded.
   Communist rebels also killed the deputy provincial military
commander of Mindoro Oriental provincial and a civilian.

<HEAD>Judge Allows Suit Against Parents of Laurie Dann</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAULINE JELINEK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The victims of Laurie Dann's shooting rampage can
go forward with their lawsuit against her parents, a judge ruled
Wednesday, saying the couple may be partly responsible for their
daughter's violent behavior.
   Ms. Dann stormed an elementary school in north suburban Winnetka
in May 1988 and fired on a second-grade classroom, fatally wounding
8-year-old Nicholas Corwin and five other children.
   She wounded a seventh person at a nearby house where she
barricaded herself before killing herself.
   Circuit Judge Donald O'Connell's ruling Wednesday denied a
motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Nicholas' parents and others
charging that Ms. Dann's parents, Norman and Edith Wasserman, were
negligent.
   The suit alleges the Wassermans, who lived in Glencoe at the
time but now live in Florida, knew their daughter was dangerous but
failed to get her help.
   The suit says that although the couple knew their daughter had a
history of violence, they failed to take away guns she owned, gave
misleading information to her psychologist and helped her get an
illegal, experimental drug for her emotional problems.
   The judge said that if the allegations are true, there is
evidence the Wassermans were not just ``merely permitting'' her to
pose a risk to society.
   ``We are dealing with allegations of a continuing course of
conduct that fostered ongoing violent, aberrant conduct on the part
of Laurie Dann,'' O'Connell said.
   He noted allegations in the lawsuit that the couple ``knew about
the possession of arms and ammunition, in fact they fostered that
... by providing money'' for her to buy them.
   He also noted allegations that the Wassermans were aware of
reports that Ms. Dann had stabbed her ex-husband and complaints
that she had made death threats against other people.
   In refusing to dismiss the case, the judge rejected arguments by
defense attorney Robert L. Reifenberg that the Wassermans had
neither the ability nor the legal authority to control their adult
daughter.
   ``There was nothing that the Wassermans could have done legally
to remove those firearms,'' Reifenberg said. He said they would
have had to steal them.
   ``If the Wassermans acted to somehow confine Laurie Dann or
constrain her against her will ... the Wassermans could, under a
certain set of circumstances, be liable for false imprisonment,''
Reifenberg said.
   ``Hospitals, jails and penal institutions have the expertise to
control a violent person,'' he said. ``The same cannot be said for
the Wassermans.''
   The attorney for Dann's victims said the defense was ``really
missing the point.''
   ``It's precisely because the Wassermans are not strangers, not
institutions, that they didn't need guards to take control,'' said
Al Hofeld.
   He said that because of the parent-child relationship, the
Wassermans were in a position to ``do things that institutions may
not be able to accomplish because they deal with people at an arm's
length.''
   It was the second time that O'Connell turned away an attempt by
the Wassermans to have the case dismissed.
   The couple didn't attend Wednesday's hearing. The judge has
ordered them to appear in Chicago by mid-December to give
depositions in the case.

   ``Throughout his career, Ed Koch has never been at a loss for

``In this new role ... he will continue to speak out about issues

   According to the station, Koch will co-host a Sunday morning

station's 5 p.m. weekday newscasts, Colloff said.
   Koch is slated to debut the week of Jan. 8, the station said _
one week after the mayor turns Gracie Mansion over to Mayor-elect
David Dinkins. Details of Koch's contract were not announced.
   Koch is apparently going to be a very busy man after leaving
office. In addition to the TV spot, Koch will do a morning radio
spot on WNEW-AM, speak on urban affairs at NYU, and undertake a
national lecture schedule.

   Twelve East German families
applied to emigrate to South Africa after the government began a
recruitment drive aimed at skilled workers who fled to West
Germany, state radio reported Wednesday.
   Manpower Minister Eli Louw confirmed this week his department
would try to recruit East German refugees to meet shortages in 34
professions, most involving technical skills.
   The South African Broadcasting Corp. quoted a spokesman at the
South African Embassy in Bonn as saying 12 families applied thus
far and a surge of additional applications was expected after
Christmas. Ads in West German newspapers suggested South Africa as
an attractive alternative for refugees who have trouble finding
jobs or housing in West Germany.
   The population growth rate among South Africa's 5 million whites
is stagnant, while the black population of 28 million grows
steadily.

   Members of communist East Germany's dreaded secret
police will be put to work in industry to stem a growing economic
crisis caused by an exodus of workers to the West, the official ADN
news agency said Wednesday.
   ADN said 385 members of the state security forces will be
transferred at once to factories and regional transit systems due
to the ``urgent demands of the economy.'' They will drive trucks
and replace bus drivers who fled.
   Pro-reform demonstrators repeatedly demanded at recent street
protests that security officers stop snooping on workers and rejoin
``productive society.''
   The West German newspaper Bild said Tuesday the new communist
government planned to fire 15,000 secret police and put them to
work in factories and fields.
   Nearly 200,000 East Germans have gone to West Germany this year.
   East Germans have long feared and despised the ``stasi,'' and
routinely ridicule them.

<TEXT>
   Kitty Dukakis, struggling with alcoholism and
chemical dependency, was hospitalized because she drank a small
amount of rubbing alcohol and experienced a ``severe reaction,''
her doctor disclosed Wednesday.
   Gerald Plotkin said in a statement that the wife of Gov. Michael
Dukakis said she swallowed the liquid ``in a state of exhaustion,
with flu symptoms and depression.''
   He did not comment on whether or not she was knowingly trying to
hurt herself.
   Mindy Lubber, the governor's spokeswoman, said she believed the
Dukakis family had removed all alcoholic beverages from their home
after Mrs. Dukakis entered a treatment program for alcoholism last
February.
   Plotkin said the family and Mrs. Dukakis were deciding what
steps to take next.
   Plotkin, who said Mrs. Dukakis had been taking anti-depressants
prescribed by her psychiatrist, was ``completely out of danger.''
Tests indicated no other drugs or alcoholic beverages were
involved, he said.
   Susan Kaplan, another spokeswman for the governor, was asked if
the incident amounted to a suicide attempt. She said, ``All I can
tell you is that you can read the statement.'' She also would not
say how much rubbing alcohol Mrs. Dukakis had ingested.
   ``Kitty has suffered from chemical dependency and struggled with
depression for many years. These two problems often are related.
Autumn has been a particularly bad season for her,'' said Plotkin.
   Rubbing alcohol is most commonly sold as isopropyl alcohol,
according to Alan Woolf, Director of the Massachusetts Poison
Center at Children's Hospital in Boston. It is more toxic than
ethanol alcohol, which is in liquor, and is irritating to the
stomach.
   About 10 ounces of rubbing alcohol, which often contains about
70 percent isopropyl alcohol, could be lethal, Woolf said.
   A woman who answered the phone at the Alcohol Abuse 24-Hour
Hotline said it was not uncommon for people with drinking problems
to drink rubbing alcohol if nothing else was available.
   ``Usually it's somebody with a severe alcohol problem,'' said
the woman, who declined to give her name. ``They'll drink anything,
even hairspray.''
   Mrs. Dukakis was brought by ambulance Monday night to Brigham
and Women's Hospital complaining of what a spokeswoman said were
``flu-like symptoms.''
   She was admitted to the intensive care unit and underwent tests
Tuesday, one year to the day after her husband lost his
presidential bid. She was admitted to the intensive care unit but
moved Wednesday to a private room.
   Plotkin on Tuesday refused to answer many questions about her
condition.
   The governor spent Monday and Tuesday with his wife, canceled
all appointments, but also refused comment.
   The health of Mrs. Dukakis, who turns 53 on Dec. 26., is of
intense interest because of a high visibility she has never
avoided. Her ready disclosures about her addictions to pills and
alcohol were applauded as courageous and refreshing.
   During her husband's run for the White House, Mrs. Dukakis
underwent neck surgery. Then, a week before the presidential
election, she entered a Minneapolis hospital suffering fever and
chills.
   Earlier this year, she underwent four weeks of treatment for
alcoholism. She has previously admitted to a 26-year addiction to
diet pills.
   The Dukakises were married June 20, 1963, and have always lived
in suburban Brookline. The couple has three grown children and a
granddaughter.
   Dukakis' 86-year-old mother, Euterpe Dukakis, also was
hospitalized Monday. She was in satisfactory condition Wednesday at
Beth Israel Hospital, where she was admitted Monday after a bout of
fainting spells.

   A state lawmaker's wife was killed by an
arrow wound in her chest before dawn at their farm home Wednesday,
and sheriff's deputies arrested the couple's 19-year-old son.
   Carolyn Goetsch, 51, was pronounced dead at the scene at 4:53
a.m., nearly an hour after the couple's 14-year-old daughter,
Shana, called law enforcement officers, said Dodge County Sheriff
Stephen Fitzgerald.
   State Rep. Robert G. Goetsch, 56, suffered cuts to the hand and
face, said Fitzgerald. Goetsch was treated at Beaver Dam Community
Hospital and released.
   The couple's son, Chad E. Goetsch, was arrested at the home
outside Juneau, a town of about 2,000 people about 50 miles
northwest of Milwaukee, according to Fitzgerald. He was being held
at the Dodge County Jail without bond.
   Chad Goetsch, a freshman at Marquette University in Milwaukee
who does not live at home, refused to talk to authorities,
Fitzgerald said.
   A court appearance was tentatively set for Thursday, said
District Attorney Kevin Schram. ``I can't speculate as to what the
charges might be,'' Schram said.
   Fitzgerald said authorities have been called to the Goetsch home
at least twice within the past year because of disputes involving
the son.
   Fitzgerald said authorities were uncertain how the son got into
the home, but believe he may have entered while his parents were
sleeping.
   His 84-year-old grandmother, Dorothy L. Goetsch, lives on the
first floor of the Goetsch home. She said she was surprised to see
Chad Goetsch sitting in the stairwell around 3 a.m.
   ``He didn't answer me,'' she said.
   She said she then heard thumping from the second floor, where
the couple lived, but figured her grandson ``was just stomping his
feet because he was mad about something.''
   Shana Goetsch called authorities around 4 a.m., Fitzgerald said.
   Mrs. Goetsch was found in the upstairs hallway with an arrow in
her chest.
   Deputies recovered a bow and arrow, but Fitzgerald said he could
not say whether the arrow was shot from the bow or whether the
wound was inflicted by hand.
   The sheriff said forks and spoons were found scattered around
the second-floor kitchen.
   According to relatives, Chad Goetsch is Mrs. Goetsch's son and
was adopted by Robert Goetsch when the couple married 15 years ago.
   Robert Goetsch's sister, Wilma Lee, said the couple had argued
about their son. ``It was hard for Robert raising an adopted son,''
she said.

   The U.S. semiconductor industry is reeling
from foreign competitors who are trying to gain a choke hold on the
materials and equipment needed to make computer chips, an industry
executive told Congress on Wednesday.
   ``Are we going to sit by and allow foreign competitors to
control our destiny in such a critical industry?'' asked Robert
Noyes, chief executive officer of Sematech.
   ``The equipment and materials industry in this country is
falling prey to targeted efforts by foreign competitors determined
to control the supply lines, the manufacturing and the end
products,'' Noyes said.
   He did not name specific competitors he had in mind.
   Noyes told a joint hearing of two House Science subcommittees
that while the United States has a 40 percent share of the
worldwide semiconductor market, its hold on the markets for
critical equipment and materials is below that.
   Sematech is a government-supported consortium of 14 companies,
established two years ago to help the U.S. computer chip industry
compete in the world market. Congress gave Sematech $100 million in
each of the last two years, and committees in both houses have
recommended paying the same amount for 1990.
   In his testimony before the subcommittees, Rep. Mel Levine,
D-Calif., blamed the hands-off business policies of the Bush
administration for the decline of the nation's high-tech industries.
   ``The American people have entrusted the president with the
economic health of our nation,'' Levine said. ``Trampling that
trust by quietly sabotaging America's major high-technology
initiatives is a national disgrace.''

<HEAD>Bush Envoy Getting Surplus VA Equipment for Vietnam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Veterans Department has made available
surplus medical equipment to President Bush's special envoy to
Vietnam for use in that country, the department said Wednesday
night.
   The United States agreed two years ago to ease the way for
private groups with expertise in artificial limbs to help
Vietnamese war victims.
   That agreement was in return for Hanoi's help on resolving the
question of what happened to missing U.S. servicemen and recovering
remains of those killed in the war. There are 2,331 U.S. servicemen
unaccounted for, according to the Defense Department.
   The envoy, retired Army Gen. John Vessey, a former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made his second trip to Vietnam in
October and reported to Bush on Monday. The president noted on
Tuesday that Vessey had reported a ``stepped up spirit of
cooperation in terms of accounting for remains'' on the part of
Vietnamese leaders.
   On Monday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush was
looking forward to progress on the MIA issue ``and other
humanitarian concerns.''
   Don Smith, a Veterans Department spokesman, said some veterans
groups had expressed fear that U.S. veterans hospitals might be
deprived of needed equipment in a time of financial stringency,
``but I think that stems from a misunderstanding.''
   All equipment being turned over to Vessey is surplus and first
has been offered to installations throughout the Veterans
Department system and to other government agencies, Smith said. The
original cost of the items involved was about $250,000, but the
monetary value today would be much less if any at all remains, he
said.
   Though the 1987 agreement was aimed at artificial limbs and
similar prosthetic devices, ``I don't think there's much of that in
there,'' said Smith.
   From the list of items being made available to Vessey, Smith
said he remembered defibrillators, used to restore normal heartbeat
in certain cardiac emergencies, and X-ray equipment.
   ``If this can help Gen. Vessey make progress on the MIA issue, I
can't imagine the most hard-bitten Vietnam Veteran having a problem
with it,'' Smith said.
   He said he did not know what arrangements Vessey had made for
delivery.

<HEAD>Six Chinese Executed for June Rioting</HEAD>

   Six people were executed in Chengdu for taking
part in riots there that broke out at the same time the military
was crushing the pro-democracy movement in Beijing, a local
official said Thursday.
   The six were sentenced to death at a public rally on Tuesday and
were immediately executed, said the official of the Foreign Affairs
Office in Chengdu, capital of southwestern Sichuan province.
Executions in China are usually by a bullet to the back of the head.
   He said three were charged with ``beating, smashing, looting and
burning'' during the June 4-6 riots in Chengdu and three with theft
and murder.
   At least 12 others, including two in Chengdu, were executed
previously for direct involvement in anti-government demonstrations
and riots that wracked the nation this spring.
   The previous 12 were all non-students. It was not clear whether
any students were among the six executed in Chengdu this week.
   The national press now rarely reports on arrests or court cases
involving participants in the student-led pro-democracy movement.
Reports that student leaders and soldiers who refused to cooperate
in the military crackdown in Beijing have been put to death cannot
be confirmed.
   Police attempts to break up a student sit-in on June 4 led to
three days of rioting in Chengdu, with estimates of 30 deaths. A
whole city block, including a large department store, was engulfed
in flames in the most serious outbreak of violence in any city
outside Beijing.

<HEAD>Miss West Virginia Says Woman Beat Her Head on Pavement After Crash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Miss West Virginia, accused of pulling a
gun after a traffic accident, said the other woman involved grabbed
her by the hair and beat her head against the pavement while
screaming obscenities.
   The woman, Tammy Boyce, told police that the 21-year-old pageant
winner, Lisa Bittinger, pulled a gun and began walking toward her
after the early morning accident.
   Bittinger was charged with brandishing a dangerous or deadly
weapon, a misdemeanor, after the incident, police said.
   Boyce, 23, was charged with reckless driving, battery and
destruction of property, all misdemeanors, police said.
   Brandishing a weapon carries a maximum penalty of six months in
jail and a $200 fine.
   Bittinger was freed on a $200 personal recognizance bond and
Boyce set free on a $350 personal recognizance bond after their
arraignments Tuesday night. No hearing date has been set.
   Several telephone calls to Bittinger's residence were answered
by a machine. She hadn't returned the calls by late Wednesday.
   Jodi Bice, Bittinger's traveling companion and business manager,
said Bittinger told her that she didn't have a weapon.
   ``She said there was no gun, and I've never known her to have
one,'' Bice said.
   Boyce said the two had confronted each other before but enied
that she had anything to do with Bittinger's accident.
   ``I've known her for about two or three years,'' said Boyce, who
works at a local restaurant. ``I've never gotten along with her.
It's like every time I see her she gives me dirty looks.''
   Boyce denied a published report that said the two might have
been fighting over a mutual boyfriend.
   In her complaint, Bittinger said the car she was driving hit a
telephone pole after she tried to avoid Boyce's car. Bittinger told
police that Boyce had been following her and had run her off the
road before she hit the pole.
   ``I pulled my car out of the intersection,'' Bittinger wrote in
her complaint. ``The defendant then pulled her car in front of mine
and then she got out and came over to my car.
   ``She put her hand inside of my sunroof and grabbed my hair. I
pulled free and then locked the doors.''
   Bittinger said Boyce then kicked out her window while screaming
obscenities and tried to pull her out of the car by her hair.
   ``I unlocked the door and got out,'' Bittinger wrote. ``She
threw me on the ground and beat my head on the pavement by holding
my hair.
   ``A witness pulled her off of me. She continued to laugh as she
got into the car and drove off.''
   Boyce's complaint was shorter and contained few details. She
wrote that Bittinger pulled a gun on her while Bittinger was in her
car.
   During an interview Wednesday, Boyce said she and Bittinger left
a Fairmont bar about the same time on the night of the accident.
   ``She turned around and took off and I followed her because I
was going the same way,'' Boyce said. ``She was way ahead of me
going pretty fast. I didn't run her off the road. I was just
driving normal.
   ``Then she tried to turn left and hit the pole. I pulled along
side her car and stopped and she started cussing me and I wasn't
going to take it.''

   A van carrying workers to factory jobs on
Long Island ran off a highway, slammed into a tree and exploded,
killing seven people and injuring eight Wednesday, state police
said.
   The accident occurred on the Northern State Parkway at 6:20
a.m., just before dawn, in heavy fog. The highway curves at the
site, and the pavement was damp, but police said they did not know
what caused the crash.
   The occupants of the 1988 Dodge van, all residents of the New
York City borough of Brooklyn, were Haitians who spoke little
English, making it difficult for investigators to find out what
went wrong, police said.
   No other vehicles were involved and there were no witnesses,
said Sgt. Brodie Schulz.
   Five were declared dead at the scene and two died later of their
injuries. The dead included four men, two women and one person
whose sex could not be determined.
   Two of the injured were in critical condition Mid-Island
Hospital in Bethpage. The other six were in fair to serious
condition at area hospitals.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Wednesday denied a petition to free
anti-Castro militant Orlando Bosch, whom the Justice Department is
trying to deport as ``Miami's No. 1 terrorist.''
   But U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler ordered that Bosch
not be expelled while his attorneys exhaust their appeals of the
extradition order, made by the Justice Department in June.
   Bosch, considered by some exiles a hero of the anti-Castro
struggle, has been held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional
Center south of Miami since February 1988 when he returned to the
United States from Venezuela.
   ``This order concludes another chapter in the sad odyssey of
Orlando Bosch Avila,'' Hoeveler wrote in a 12-page ruling. ``Once a
hero of Cuban resistance to Castro's communist takeover, his
efforts became sullied by his extremes and eventually resulted in
his imprisonment.''
   Bosch was convicted of a 1968 bazooka attack on a Polish ship in
Miami and fled the U.S. while on probation in 1974. He was later
jailed for 11 years in Venezuela in the bombing of a Cuban
airliner, killing 73 people, but he was never convicted in the
attack.
   According to CIA documents released by the Justice Department,
the 62-year-old Cuban doctor ran successful bombing raids in Cuba
in the early 1960s. U.S. intelligence reports have linked Bosch to
terrorist bombings throughout the U.S. and Latin America into the
1970s, and he is regarded by the FBI as ``Miami's No. 1 terrorist.''
   But his attorneys say that Bosch now repudiates violence, and
his family believes he'll be killed if he is deported.
   Some prominent Cuban Americans have asked President Bush to
intervene, but the White House has said it won't comment on the
Bosch case while it's in the courts.
   Bosch's attorney, Raul Cantero, planned continuing the legal
battle, saying, ``I think it's an issue we can win. It's up to the
family to decide whether they want to go through the aggravation of
another few months litigating this.''
   But Bosch's daughter, Myriam, left the court in tears.
   ``He's a pediatrician,'' she said of her father. ``He's a lover
of people _ and this is how this country pays him back.''

<HEAD>Richard Williams, Who Named `Flying Fortress,' Dies at 78</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard L. Williams, a writer and
editor credited with inventing the term Flying Fortress for the
famed B-17 bomber of World War II, has died at age 78.
   Williams died of pneumonia Sunday at Bayfront Medical Center.
   Williams was born in Seattle, home of Boeing Co., which
developed the B-17. He earned a journalism degree from the
University of Washington and joined the Seattle Times in 1933.
   Williams was assigned to write a caption on a picture of the
B-299, a B-17 prototype, on July 17, 1935, according to the Boeing
News, a company publication.
   He later said he was impressed by the apparent power of the
plane and wrote: ``Declared to be the largest land plane ever built
in America, this 15-ton flying fortress, built by the Boeing
Aircraft Co. under Army specifications, today was ready to test its
wings.''
   The name stuck.
   Williams also worked for Boeing Aircraft before becoming an
editor at Dell Publishing Co. about 1948. Later, he went to Time
Inc. as an editor for Time-Life Books.
   Williams moved to Florida's Gulf Coast in 1985 from Unadilla,
N.Y., after his retirement from the board of editors of the
Smithsonian magazine.

   L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, celebrating an off-year Democratic
surge, claimed a razor-thin breakthrough today as the nation's first
elected black governor. David Dinkins was elected New York City's
first black mayor and said voters had responded ``with the voice of
hope, here and in Virginia.''
   The volatile politics of abortion hurt Republicans throughout the
campaign and powered an election-day nightmare that extended to New
Jersey, where Democratic Rep. James Florio reclaimed the
governorship for his party and the Democrats also regained control
of the Assembly.
   Just as significant as the pro-choice political turnout was the
extension of black political success in America's large city halls.
Led by Dinkins, blacks also succeeded white mayors in Seattle,
Cleveland, New Haven, Conn., and Durham, N.C.
   The main event of the day was in Virginia, where Republican J.
Marshall Coleman trailed Wilder by 7,700 votes of more than 1.7
million cast in the unofficial, final vote count. With all precincts
counted, Wilder had 889,869 votes or 50 percent and Coleman had
882,137 votes or 50 percent.

whose owner was a major political contributor.
   Former Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Edwin J. Gray told
the House Banking Committee on Tuesday that DeConcini, D-Ariz., made
the request to him in an April 2, 1987, meeting in DeConcini's
office attended by three other senators.
   The four senators _ who received $1.3 million in contributions

   Americans and Soviets have at least one thing
in common _ many don't know much geography and show ``an astonishing
lack of awareness of the world around them,'' a Gallup poll showed
today.
   The survey, the first of geographic knowledge conducted in the
Soviet Union, was commissioned by the National Geographic Society to
find how the United States compared with its neighbors and other
industrialized nations.
   The study found Soviets between ages 18 and 24 scored
significantly higher than their American counterparts, but did not
do well when compared with adults of all age groups in the 10
nations where the test was given.
   ``We believe the results from the survey point to a startling
superpower comparison,'' said the Gallup Organization, which called
the international geography survey the largest of its kind.
``Americans and Soviets have demonstrated an astonishing lack of
awareness of the world around them.''

   A man whose truck smashed into a bus,
killing 27 people, accepts some responsibility for the nation's
deadliest drunken-driving crash, but is no murderer, his attorney
said on the eve of his trial.
   Larry Mahoney, who authorities say drank as much as a case of
beer the day of the fiery crash with a school bus carrying a church
youth group, is charged with 27 counts of murder.
   Jury selection was scheduled to begin today in Carroll Circuit
Court in his trial on 83 charges. In addition to murder, Mahoney is
charged with drunken driving and assault and wanton endangering
counts connected with injuries to some of the 40 people who escaped
the burning bus on May 14, 1988.
   Defense attorney William Summers said he planned to argue that
Mahoney, 36, of Worthville, isn't guilty of murder.

   After three of its members were
kidnapped, tortured and shot to death, a leftist political party
blamed military men and demanded that the local army commander turn
them in for civilian prosecution.
   The slaying of the young activists of the Social Christian
Popular Movement, discovered Tuesday, comes a week after 10 people
were killed in the bombing of a leftist labor union's downtown
headquarters.
   Leftist political leaders blame the military for both incidents,
which reflect a rise in attacks on civilians in the 10-year-old
civil war.
   There are widespread fears that rightist death squads are again

   The Bush administration must ``run faster'' and
plan better to meet increased competition for civil and military
technologies from nations such as Japan and Korea, a top Pentagon
advisory board recommends.
   ``National security can no longer be viewed only in military
terms, but must include economic well-being as a key component. ...
This is a distinct departure from the past,'' said the Defense
Advisory Board, an independent group set up to counsel the Pentagon.
   ``The point is, it is not Japan's aggressive roadmap for the
future that is at fault. Rather, it has been our own inability to
get our act together and create a national vision and set of goals
of our own,'' the panel said.
   The panel issued a strongly worded report that said the current
policies for industrial cooperation and technology transfers ``are
no longer appropriate'' and may endanger American's global economic
and military well-being.

   Mbali Umoja wrote her first poem when she was
8 years old. Her inspiration? The Brownies.
   ``We had to draw some kind of springtime picture, and instead of
drawing a picture, I wrote a poem about the spring,'' she said.
   But she just as easily could have drawn the picture because
Umoja, who has a degree in theater from the California Institute of
the Arts in Los Angeles, is an art therapist at the Philadelphia
Child Guidance Clinic.
   As an artist, her influences vary. Her office reflects
multiethnic culture with displays of African musical instruments and
ceramic sculptures created by her young patients.
   ``We are all citizens of the world,'' Umoja said. ``We write
about our whole life experiences.''
   In one of her works, ``Messing With a Poet Is a Dangerous
Thing,'' which she wrote for her former husband, Aschak, she writes:
   ``When you've just got to bug someone
   ``and don't know who
   ``grab a dancer
   ``or a painter
   ``but leave the lover of oral expression be.''
   The 33-year-old Umoja grew up in Elkins Park, Pa., as Elmyra
Bell. She changed her name while a student in Los Angeles.
   As a child, she was surrounded by books. Her parents are Ed Bell,
a University of Pennsylvania graduate and former Philadelphia Eagle,
and Barbara Bell, the head psychiatric nurse at Temple University
Hospital.
   ``Literature was a major part of my environment,'' Umoja said.
``My mother grew up in the segregated South and went through a
segregated school system, which opened her up to the experience of
black literature. She used to give my father lists of books to pick
up during his travels around the country, and they would read them
to us.
   ``The language of poetry always touched me. My mom can read it
really well, and it was the written word that related to me.''
   Writers who early influenced her were Langston Hughes and Maya
Angelou. but it was Paul Laurence Dunbar's ``Sympathy'' that really
reached her.
   ``It made sense to me when I was about 11 years old,'' she says.
``I was reading it for what could have been the 50th time and it
suddenly made me cry. I really felt it. That was the first time I
knew that poetry could do more than just sound good, that it had an
impact that couldn't die.''
   Her poetic direction eventually came from Ntozake Shange, author
of ``For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow
Is Enuf,'' which won a Tony award in 1977 for the play's star,
Trazana Beverley.
   ``She took the woman's perspective,'' Umoja said. ``She finally
started speaking honestly, in the face of monumental criticism, to
what our lives are as women.''
   Shange's writing also taught Umoja what it means to be a female
artist.
   ``You're fighting all the way,'' she said, ``whether you're black
or white, or Asian, Chicano _ it doesn't make any difference.''
   Umoja, whose works have appeared in such anthologies as ``Poets
on the Move,'' often wonders what it would be like to be a so-called
normal person, one who experiences life as it relates to themselves,
rather than as it relates to the greater human experience.
   ``It would be easier not to be as strong as I am,'' she says,
``instead of functioning as a technicolor character in a
black-and-white world. That's how it feels to be me.''
   As a high school student, Umoja works were strident and bitter,
reflecting her rage and the politics of the time. One such poem,
``America the Beautiful,'' was written in 1972:
   ``America
   ``The stench of blood is in the air
   ``Everywhere
   ``The heat of hate is rising fast
   ``A shot for the moon, a kick in my ass
   ``Kent State students dead
   ``Sadistic pigs busting heads
   ``Helping me, well, that's a bunch of bull
   ``But this is America, yeah, the Beautiful.''
   Her writing has mellowed somewhat since then. Now, she struggles
with issues many women understand _ safety, loneliness, making ends
meet and concern for America's children.
   ``I can't believe how we treat children in this country,'' she
said. ``We need to stop being afraid of our children and make a
difference with them.'' She writes of women as mothers, as
individuals and as they relate to men. One poem, ``Widow Madness,''
was written after a close male friend died, but it became a tribute
to all women who have lost a loved one.
   In the poem, a woman thinks of her husband long after his death:
   ``She was two years past those cravings
   ``past the late night phone call, smothering cold of death's hand
   ``in her face.
   ``life went on.''
   But later, the woman dreams of the night she learned of her
husband's death:
   ``she never saw
   ``only smelled the blur of wide shoulders interrupt her search.
   ``never heard a strangled cry ...
   ``She only remembered the french quarter aroma,
   ``wafting from his collar ...
   ``she climbed his back
   ``clung hotly to a memory.''

<HEAD>Casualty Losses Get Limited Tax Relief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a year marked by a hurricane in the East and a
severe earthquake on the West Coast, many Americans are coming face
to face with the intricacies of the tax laws covering casualty
losses.
   And countless others who were spared any damage this time might
well be pausing to consider the situation they would face if they
are less lucky in some future calamity.
   The federal income tax system contains provisions for relief
among taxpayers who suffer losses from casualties or theft. But the
benefits are limited, and not as generous as they used to be.
   ``Most people with casualty losses are surprised and disappointed
by the tax rules,'' says the accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young.
   Before the tax code was repeatedly overhauled in the 1980s,
taxpayers could deduct all the personal-property losses they could
document from sudden or unpredictable events such as fire, storm,
theft or riot, minus any insurance claims paid.
   The only limit was the exclusion of the first $100 in losses from
each casualty _ a measure intended to keep minor cases out of the
system.
   Now, however, a taxpayer's total casualty loss for the year,
after subtracting the first $100 in each individual event, does not
qualify for any deduction until it exceeds 10 percent of adjusted
gross income for the year.
   So for a taxpayer making $35,000, a $4,000 loss would produce
only a $400 deduction.
   Another primary sticking point: The deductible loss for property
stolen or destroyed cannot exceed your orginal cost of acquiring it,
plus any improvements made over the years.
   You cannot claim the market value of a property or collectible
item that has appreciated in value over the years since you acquired
it.
   Furthermore, if you receive an insurance payment, based on recent
or present market value, that exceeds your original cost of the item
in question, the difference is subject to taxation as a capital gain.
   The law treats such cases as if you had sold the item at a
profit, through a transaction known legally as an ``involuntary
conversion.''
   Of course, these strictures apply only to the question of taxes.
They do not take into account any government or private assistance
programs that may provide relief for your loss.
   For example, in places that are designated by the government as
federal disaster areas, people with casualty losses can file claims
for deductions against their taxes for the year preceding the loss.
   This is aimed at giving them a chance to seek refunds immediately
in order to have funds available as soon as possible for rebuilding
or replacement of their lost assets.
   Some misfortunes are ineligible for casualty loss deductions _
for instance, damage caused over time by insects, rust, rot or
exposure to the elements.
   Also ruled out are any losses deemed to be caused by your own
willful negligence.
   Even in a case where you have an eligible deduction to claim,
experts on the subject caution, you often need to take steps to
demonstrate its legitimacy.
   Thus, they say, it helps to establish that a theft has probably
been committed if you file a police report soon after an item is
determined to be missing.
   Says the J.K. Lasser Institute in its annual publication Your
Income Tax: ``If your return is audited, you will have to prove that
the casualty occurred and the amount of the loss. The time to
collect your evidence is as soon after the casualty as possible.''

   Playing fictional police roles on television
is one thing, but there's an added responsibility in portraying a
real-life detective, says actor A Martinez who stars in NBC's
``Manhunt: Search for the Night Stalker.''
   Martinez, who was born Adolph but shortened his name to A,
appears in the movie about the killer who terrorized California
between March and August 1985. He plays Gil Carrillo, a detective
for the Los Angeles County sheriff's department. Richard Jordan is
Frank Salerno, another detective.
   ``I've played other cops on `Police Story' and on `The Whiz
Kids,''' said Martinez. ``It's just different when it's someone you
get to meet and form opinions of. It puts a responsibility on you.
It's difficult to uphold when the piece is not a character study.
   ``I found myself wishing I could expand on a scene so I could
show more of the man.''
   ``Manhunt: Search for the Night Stalker'' will be telecast
Sunday. It ends with the arrest of Richard Ramirez, who was
convicted on Sept. 20 of 13 murders, five attempted murders, 11
sexual assaults and 14 burglaries. The jury's recommendation he be
sent to the gas chamber was affirmed by the trial judge Tuesday.
   ``It's really the story of the investigation,'' said Martinez,
who also has a starring role on NBC's ``Santa Barbara.''
   Martinez said he developed a great respect and admiration for
Carrillo. ``He's remarkable because he remains warm-hearted in a
de-humanizing job where he is constantly in the face of human
behavior at its worse,'' he said. ``It's difficult to imagine myself
handling such a challenge so gracefully.
   ``My favorite part of the picture was when I could show Gil's
personal life and his family. He was a victim, too, because he was
separated from his family. I sense a lot of pain in him over that.
It's fascinating the way he bears it.''
   Martinez, who has two children, said in particular he identified
with Carrillo's empathy for children.
   ``The Night Stalker harmed a lot of children, directly or
indirectly,'' he said. ``That aspect stood out in bold relief.''
   Martinez was interviewed in his dressing room for ``Santa
Barbara,'' which he joined within a week of its debut in 1984. He
plays Cruz Castillo, a private detective.
   ``Cruz Castillo is the hero, who's in love with a woman from the
other side of the tracks,'' he said. The character was recently
married to the soap opera's heroine from a wealthy family, Eden
Capwell, who is played by Marcy Walker.
   Martinez took off four weeks from ``Santa Barbara'' to work on
the Night Stalker movie. During that period, however, he still
managed to appear in 10 episodes.
   ``An hour show five days a week is an intensive grind,'' said
Martinez, who appears in almost every show. ``It's a small cast so
the core people tend to work a lot. Even being away for a weekend
tends to upset the rhythm of the show. Sometimes the fatigue is your
ally because you don't have the excess energy to get nervous.''
   He also co-stars with Meryl Streep, Roseanne Barr and Ed Begley
Jr. in the feature film ``She Devil.'' He plays Streep's gigolo
lover. While on location in Port Jefferson, N.Y., his wife, Leslie
Bryans, gave birth to their daughter, Devon. They also have a son,
Dakota Lee, called Cody.
   Martinez, the son of a school principal, grew up in Los Angeles
as the third generation Adolph Martinez. As a child he was known as
``Little A'' and ``A-Bone.'' The name was later shortened to A.
   He got into acting while at UCLA. He made his professional debut
in the movie ``Born Wild'' and had roles in other films. He was a
regular in such series as ``Cassie &amp; Co.'' and ``The Whiz Kids.''
   ``The bulk of my work has been in Hispanic or Native American
roles,'' he said. ``But within that I've played characters from
professionals to illiterates. It's a privilege to make your living
as an artist.
   ``Now that I'm a father my desire for cinematic grandeur has
washed away. The irony is that for years I was afraid to have kids
because I was afraid it would be an albatross around my neck. It's
amazing that the thing you feared is what liberates you.''

   A help-wanted sign is going out for the 1990s,
expected to be a decade of great change in the United States. This
is one of a periodic series of articles, ``The '90s,'' looking ahead
to the promise and peril of the upcoming 10 years, in the
environment, medicine, technology and society.

   Fewer and fewer people will be entering the
U.S. job market in the 1990s, and the dwindling flow will change the
face of the factory and office _ and of American society _ in the
coming decade.
   Women and minority-group members will account for over 80 percent
of all new entrants in the labor force in the '90s, says the private
Population Reference Bureau.
   In the 1970s, 24.1 million young people entered the workforce. In
this decade, only 18.0 million did so. And in the 1990s, according
to a bureau study, the number is expected to decline to 15.6
million. Much of the dropoff is among non-Hispanic white males.
   The coming change in the labor force will follow a decade, the
1980s, of significant social transformation in the United States,
lifestyle changes likely to continue through the coming 10 years.
   Because improved medical care has extended lifespans, the
Americans who greet the year 2000 will be on average older and, if
not wiser, at least better-educated than the ones who saw the
current century arrive. Other lifestyle trends: people are marrying
later and divorcing more, and women have become an important part of
the workplace.
   Forecasting into the next century, Carol J. De Vita, a senior
researcher at the Population Reference Bureau, says technology may
solve part of the labor dilemma by eliminating the need for some
jobs.
   But many millions of new workers will still be needed, and
employers may have to turn to older people or immigrants, De Vita
explained in an interview.
   Some businesses, such as fast-food outlets, are already feeling
the pinch and have begun seeking out retired people to fill jobs.
   ``Many of the jobs that younger workers do are entry level, so
the question is if someone with more experience would want to switch
and gain some new skills,'' she said.
   A second choice for labor-short companies may be immigration, if
foreign workers can be found with needed skills.
   In fact, De Vita noted, some bills have been introduced in
Congress to shift the focus and give foreign workers with desired
skills, rather than those with relatives in the United States,
higher priority for immigration.
   The growth of the U.S. population is expected to slow in the '90s.
   Americans of the giant post-World War II Baby Boom generation are
now becoming parents, producing a relatively large number of
offspring.
   The ``Boomers'' were followed by a Baby Bust generation in the
late 1960s and 1970s. As this group reaches its childbearing years
during the 1990s, fewer potential parents will mean fewer offspring,
unless the ``Bust'' generation sharply reverses the trend of recent
decades, during which people have postponed childbearing and
eventually had smaller families than in years past.
   The U.S. Census Bureau notes that the elderly constitute the
fastest-growing group in the national population.
   As of 1987, there were 29.8 million Americans age 65 or older,
12.2 percent of the population. The Census Bureau says this group
will continue growing into the next century, and will include one
American in five when the bulk of the Baby Boom generation has
senior-citizen status, by about the year 2030. Census projections
show the elderly to be the only group to continue growing through
the middle of the next century.
   The boom in elderly will have a critical impact on health care
and retirement-income programs, observes the Population Reference
Bureau study. But it also will provide more older candidates for the
jobs De Vita sees going begging because of the decline in the number
of young workers.
   Meanwhile, the ``traditional'' family of working husband, and
wife staying home with the children, has largely disappeared. Fewer
than half of all families now have children. Even in families that
have offspring, most mothers held jobs outside the home as of 1987,
the Census Bureau reports.
   At the same time, the Population Reference Bureau noted, ``the
growing incidence of divorce and out-of-wedlock births has fueled an
enormous increase in single-parent families.''
   Almost one in four children now lives with only one parent,
compared with one in 10 in 1960, the Population Reference Bureau
found. ``The growing concern over child care, elder care and
parental leave will continue well into next century,'' it concluded.
   The Census Bureau reports that blacks now constitute 12.2 percent
of Americans and Hispanics 8 percent _ meaning these two groups
account for about one in five Americans.
   ``By 2000 nearly one-third of all school-age children will be
from minority populations _ a situation that presents a major
challenge to our school systems,'' the Population Reference Bureau
reports.
   The growth of minority groups, like the change in the face of the
workforce, will present society with further new challenges _ in the
economy, in politics and in the legal system, where affirmative
action and related issues may become still more pressing.

<DATELINE>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was front-page news when the managing
editor of the Key West Citizen annouced he was retiring after
testing positive for AIDS.
   Jim Tucci, who started 12 years ago as a reporter at the local
daily newspaper, is one of the more visible AIDS stories to hit this
sunny tourist mecca, but Key West, famed for a relaxed, relatively
carefree lifestyle, is coping with one of the nation's highest AIDS
rates.
   Despite signs that a spiraling number of AIDS cases has taken a
heavy toll on health service providers, longtime residents say
bigger, richer cities could probably learn something from this
community's attitude toward victims.
   ``I think this town is a lot further ahead than others,'' said
Gordon Ross Bondesen, a gay entertainer at a popular resort hotel
who has lived here nearly 20 years. ``There's a lot of education and
support'' and compassion, he said.
   However, concerns raised in published reports on the prevalence
of AIDS and on its potential impact on the tourism industry anger
community leaders.
   ``My only concern is the way it's reported, not that it's here,''
said Don Defeo, president of the Key West Hotel-Motel Association.
   ``There's a lot of competition out for the tourist dollar,'' said
Chamber of Commerce President John Parks Jr. ``We're more concerned
about the hurricane situation.''
   Yet acquired immune deficiency syndrome has had a much more
dramatic effect on the people of Key West this decade than any
hurricane.
   Just 243 cases have been recorded since 1982 by the Monroe County
Public Health Unit, which covers all of the Florida Keys, population
about 77,000. But the rate of 121 cases per 100,000 people puts Key
West (population 27,000), in the company of such cities as San
Francisco (104 cases per 100,000), New York (70 per 100,000) and
Miami (47 per 100,000). Key West has most of the cases.
   ``In a little town like this, that much AIDS is relatively a
lot,'' said Dave Nolan, the health unit's statistician.
   One reason for the high rate is a large gay population, which has
a higher incidence of AIDS. Some victims diagnosed elsewhere also
move here, raising concern about limited resources being strained.
   ``I think anyone can understand our concern, that people who've
contracted AIDS elsewhere and are looking for a sympathetic
community will think of Key West, but there is a point where the
community will be stretched to the limit,'' said Mayor Richard
Heyman.
   However, the greater concern for the future is new cases arising
from drug abuse, Nolan said. ``Like everybody else in the country,
we have drug problems, and where there are drugs, AIDS follows.''
   How prepared Key West is to handle a surge in new cases is
uncertain, but one doctor who sees most of the AIDS patients at his
private practice with two other physicians says the island isn't
ready.
   ``The health-care resources are not in place in this community,
as they are not in other cities,'' said Dr. Larry Siegel. ``This
community is not yet prepared to deal with large numbers of new
patients.''
   The spiraling costs for AIDS-related medical care already have
had a dramatic impact at Florida Keys Memorial Hospital, the
county's only public hospital. During the last fiscal year, it
absorbed $1 million in unpaid bills left by AIDS patients,
accounting for about one-third of its bad debt. That figure was up
sharply from the previous year, hospital administrator Donald Mayer
said.
   One AIDS patient who died recently left a $150,000 bill for a
45-day stay, Mayer said. Lee Brooks was diagnosed HIV-positive in
Miami in 1981 and moved to Key West five years ago to run a guest
house. The 36-year-old man died in March without medical insurance
after spending the last nine months of his life at the hospital,
according to a published report.
   Lack of state and federal dollars is a key problem, said Heyman,
adding that Key West's size puts it at a disadvantage in competing
for financing with cities like Miami. ``We're having to do more on
less,'' he said.
   Much of the burden for helping AIDS patients with basic needs has
fallen on local groups, such as AIDS Help, which help with rent,
food and medication.
   The focus also has been put on education, with monthly safe-sex
workshops, brochures and condoms distributed at gay bars, and free
condoms provided at guest houses, among other programs.
   A mobile testing van, believed to be the first in the state, will
soon hit the streets to provide safe-sex education and conduct AIDS
tests, said Norene Sofranac, director of the AIDS Prevention Center,
which is run by the state Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services.
   Bondesen, who has lost 30 friends to AIDS, said the epidemic has
made the gay community more sexually responsible and resulted in a
solid support network for AIDS victims. ``There isn't a sense of
gloom but more a sense of determination'' to educate people about
AIDS, he said.
   Tony Tarracino, 73, a saloon operator in the Old Town section,
said Key West is a survivor and will carry on as usual, despite what
is perceived as negative media coverage of AIDS here.
   ``We always seem to overcome,'' said Tarracino, who was elected
mayor on Nov. 7.

   Clink. Charley Hummel drops a nickel into the
jukebox.
   Plonk. He taps C-1.
   Whir. The platter twists onto the turntable.
   WHAM! It's 1958 and _ great balls of fire! _ Jerry Lee Lewis is
on the loose:
   ``You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain! Too much loving
drives a man insane! You took my will! Oh what a thrill! Goodness
gracious, great balls of fire!''
   Hummel, an ex-cop with a ruddy, boyish face, stares fondly at his
1961 Rock-Ola Regis 200, which has the sleek chrome lines of a '57
Chevy. For a moment, he's transported back to his junior year of
high school; the gang is together at the neighborhood bowling alley.
   Then he snaps back. And while the Killer wreaks aural havoc from
behind the Rock-Ola's blue metal grill, Hummel discusses the 100th
birthday of that most American of inventions, the jukebox.
   An amateur historian, professional tinkerer and jukebox wizard,
Hummel has determined that the first jukebox swallowed its first
coin on Nov. 23, 1889, at the Palais Royale Saloon in San Francisco.
   It didn't much resemble its flashy descendants, nor did it have
the same name _ it was called a ``nickel-in-the-slot.'' But the
operating principle was pretty much the same: When a nickel was
dropped into a slot, a wax cylinder began to spin, a needle plopped
onto it and music blared into crude headphones.
   The songs were about two minutes long, and there was only one
selection per machine. But it was recorded music, and the sound
quality was surprisingly good.
   Hummel collects jukeboxes, and the family room of his suburban
home is a combination warehouse, workshop and museum, crammed
wall-to-wall with vintage jukes, wax cylinders, 78- and 45-rpm
records, advertising signs and a bronze bust of the father of
recorded music, Thomas Alva Edison. The collection includes a
turn-of-the-century nickel-in-the-slot that still works when a penny
is dropped in (prices were slashed from a nickel in the 1890s).
   Slipping in a penny, Hummel hands over the headphones and a
listener hears the imperial strains of ``Columbia, Gem of the
Ocean'' screech through the rubber tubes.
   ``It's beyond our age _ we really can't recall these _ but these
are really dynamite pieces, these early nickel-in-the-slots,''
Hummel says. ``People couldn't afford a phonograph, yet for a nickel
they could go out to a tavern or an arcade and settle into a nice
song they remembered.''
   Elvis hadn't been born yet, so 19th century hitmakers made do
with what was available. One early favorite: ``Nearer My God to
Thee.''
   The word ``jukebox'' apparently entered the language in the
1920s. The Random House Dictionary of the English Language traces it
to ``jukehouse,'' a Southern dialect word for brothel, which in turn
came from a West African word ``dzugu,'' meaning ``wicked.''
   Americans embraced the wicked machines.
   The modern jukebox was born in 1927, when Automatic Music
Instrument Co. made a machine that had amplified sound and played a
variety of selections. It still looked old-fashioned _ like an old
wooden radio _ but it set the stage for the heyday of the jukebox in
the 1930s, '40s and '50s.
   Those were the years when Wurlitzer, Seeburg, Rock-Ola and other
companies competed to create the brightest, flashiest, most
multicolored and spectacular jukes imaginable.
   Jukeboxes became an integral part of the American experience _
particularly the experience of teen-agers flush with burgers and the
first stirrings of romance.
   It was a time when Perry Como crooned of his ``jukebox baby'':
``All your lunchtime money goes down the slot, you could live on air
if the music's hot. ... Jukebox baby, you're the swingingest doll in
town.''
   Jukeboxes hit an artistic peak in the post-war years, when
Wurlitzer came out with its Model 1015, regarded by many aficionados
as the most beautiful jukebox of all time. It was wrapped in a
rainbow of multicolored plastic tubing, was trimmed with pieces of
Art Deco chrome, played 24 songs and sounded sublime. It was an
American classic.
   ``The war was over, there were happy times,'' observes Don
Fairchild, who runs the Juke Box Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City.
``Money was more plentiful, jobs were opening up and people were
getting out and listening to the jukeboxes.''
   And along came something else: rock 'n' roll.
   It's no coincidence that the most popular jukeboxes at
Fairchild's Hall of Fame are those that were in use during the '50s.
It was a golden age, when music and machine united in a marriage
made in teen heaven.

   Fairchild recalls growing up in Tishomingo, Okla., during the
'50s.
   ``If you was going with a girl, it seemed like the songs they had
back then _ it seemed like every song was written about you and that
girl. All them by Elvis, Fats Domino doing `Blueberry Hill' . .. the
Coasters doing `Searchin' and `Young Blood.' Whoo! They had some
good artists back then!''
   Charley Hummel remembers, too.
   ``I mean, God, I can remember the '50s. We used to listen to
Elvis all the time on the jukebox _ it was super _ and ... the
Penguins, Clyde McPhatter, the Tokens ... a lot of those R&amp;B songs,
we used to blast them.
   ``Normally, kids weren't supposed to know where the volume
control was, but we all knew where it was in the back, and you just
took your little screwdriver and you just slowly, slowly cranked it
up.''
   To demonstrate, Hummel leans behind his 1961 Rock-Ola and makes
an adjustment, then slips a coin in the slot. A drum beat sounds and
Chubby Checker blasts out a song from the year the jukebox was built:
   ``Come on, let's twist again like we did last summer, let's twist
again like we did last year, woo, woo, woo, woo. Remember when we
were really hummin'. Yeah, let's twist again, twistin' time is
here.''
   That was one of the last good years for the jukebox industry. The
industry estimates that 43,000 new jukeboxes were shipped to
customers in 1955 and 42,000 in 1960. By 1965, the numbers had
slipped to 29,000; by 1975, 17,000; and by the mid-'80s, 10,000 to
12,000.
   Jukeboxes were challenged by home stereos, shunned by fast-food
drive-ins and threatened with obsolescence by the compact disc and
the decline of the 45-rpm single.
   There's been a modest revival in the past few years. In part, the
industry has adapted, producing jukeboxes that play CDs and music
videos. In part, it is because people yearn for the old times and
are buying nostalgic recreations of the old jukeboxes.
   ``I would say it is going to continue to increase because you are
incorporating new technologies into it, which is attracting new
audiences,'' says Fred Newton of the Chicago-based Amusement &amp; Music
Operators Association, a trade group. ``The oldies' thing is going
to continue.''
   Not surprisingly, Hummel is bullish as well.
   ``I think there is a market, especially for the CDs. The CDs are
high quality and high-tech. That's what the public wants; they want
good music. And that's what the jukebox has been doing for 100 years
_ it's been getting better quality, better sound and better
reliability. So there is a place for the CDs.''
   Still, he says, he hopes the record industry continues to produce
45s.
   As he speaks, Hummel drops another nickel into his jukebox.
``This is one of my favorites,'' he says. ``Percy Faith. `Theme From
a Summer Place.'''
   The music wells up.
   ``You see, I can remember from when I was a kid. It's a little
flashback: me and my ife, you know, a '57 Chevy maybe, riding down a
highway, listening to something like this.''
   The song, unabashedly romantic, fills the house. Hummel's wife
begins to dance lightly around the living room, looking for all the
world like a teen-ager gearing up for the high school dance. He
lovingly looks at her and smiles.
   Charley Hummel is suddenly 17 years old _ and very, very happy.

<HEAD>Bootleg Translation of Japanese Book Hot Item in Congress</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX7 of Nov. 8</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN L. HERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the hottest books circulating in the
nation's capital these days isn't available in any store and you're
unlikely to get your hands on a copy unless you have a friend in
Congress or at the CIA.
   The book is a bootleg translation of ``The Japan That Can Say
No,'' co-authored by Sony Corp. founder Akio Morita and Shintaro
Ishihara, a novelist and right-wing Diet member of Japan's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party.
   The rhetoric isn't what Americans are used to hearing from their
Japanese allies. The book characterizes the U.S.-Japanese
relationship as a ``fatal attraction.''
   Morita writes that America is in an economic malaise because it
thinks only about the next 10 minutes, not the next 10 years as
Japan does.
   Ishihara calls the United States a ``shifty country'' and says if
it doesn't start playing more by Japanese rules, Tokyo might stop
selling it the microchips essential for targeting U.S. missiles and
begin selling them to the Soviets.
   Congressional aides say translations, produced by U.S.
intelligence and defense agencies, have been spreading like wildfire
through House and Senate office buildings.
   ``I think this is the first time that these kinds of attitudes
have been publicly expressed,'' Sen. James Exon said in an interview
in his office as he clutched a copy.
   Exon, D-Neb., described the Japanese as ``very shrewd business
people and who are very clever in promoting the interests of
Japan.'' He said he is worried that the book outlines ``a plan that
they've had for a long time.''
   Like Exon, Rep. Don Ritter, R-Pa., also has a well marked-up copy
of the 74-page translation. Ritter said his initial reaction was
``you've got to be kidding.''
   He said he is especially troubled by Ishihara's description of
U.S. forces in Japan as ``mad dogs'' and his declaration that Japan
should spurn further U.S. military assistance.
   ``Mr. Ishihara sounds a little like some of the Japanese
ultra-right politicians, ultra-nationalist politicians prior to the
onset of World War II, which is somewhat disturbing,'' Ritter said
between reciting passages from the book during an interview.
   There are some important passages in the book, Ritter said,
especially those by Morita dealing with Japan's success in bringing
products to mass markets.
   ``This part of his message has gotten lost underneath the burden
of all these other statements and this inflammatory rhetoric,''
Ritter said. ``This is a message that is awfully important for
Americans to know.''
   Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., agrees with Ritter that some of
Morita's comments ``were right on the mark'' and Ishihara's words
``inaccurately reflected some of the issues between our two
countries.'' Levine said that was why he began passing out copies of
the book to his Capitol Hill colleagues.
   ``I felt this was important,'' Levine said. ``It was something
that they should have the opportunity to see.''
   Despite his role as an unofficial distributor, Levine said media
accounts about congressional reaction to the book should not be
``overblown.'' Such reports filtering back to Tokyo already have
helped boost sagging sales of the book there, according to the
Kobunsha publishing company.
   Interest is growing in Washington as well.
   ``We've had people in here every day going absolutely bananas
looking for it,'' said Sarah Wassum, who works at a bookstore in the
National Press Club building in Washington. ``We're losing our minds
trying to track it down.''
   Levine emphasized that he did not commission the unofficial
translation, saying his came from the Pentagon.
   A congressional aide, speaking on condition he not be identified,
said that the version Levine obtained was translated by the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency and that another translation done
by the Central Intelligence Agency also has begun circulating in
Washington.
   Yet another version is making its way through California's
Silicon Valley and other American high technology centers. At United
Technologies Corp., international affairs director Ellen Frost and
Japan office director Stanley Krueger said the book expresses views
that have been aired in Japan for a long time.
   ``It isn't so surprising,'' Frost said. ``For Congress to appear
shocked is a measure of how little they follow Japan in any kind of
depth.''
   Krueger said he thinks he knows why the book has received bad
reviews in Congress. ``There is a tendency in the United States,
maybe in Washington, in terms of various policies toward Japan to
assume their total dependence on the United States,'' he said.
``This book puts a little chink in that armor. This is the first
time somebody (in Japan) has said, `Hey, wait a minute, we can go
some other way.'''
   Frost, a former official in the Defense and Commerce departments,
said congressional criticism of the book will only make things worse
for American companies trying to penetrate Japanese markets.
   ``The more bashing that occurs as a result of things like this
book, the more those Japanese who think like Mr. Ishihara are
inclined to cast off more on their own and throw us out,'' she said.

   Financially ailing Braniff Inc. canceled its
last 46 round-trip flights, dismissed many of its remaining
employees and stranded passengers as it abruptly ended service.
   A severe cash shortage short-circuited the company's
reorganization plan and forced it to halt all passenger service as
of midnight Monday, Chairman William G. McGee said. Officials said
Braniff is looking for a buyer.
   Braniff, which sought protection from creditors Sept. 28 while it
developed a reorganization plan under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws, was dismissing many of its remaining 1,800
employees, spokeswoman Sandy Smith said Tuesday.

   American consumers dramatically slowed their
accumulation of new debt in September, adding only $606 million and
showing caution about buying cars and other expensive items.
   The Federal Reserve Board reported Tuesday that consumer credit
increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of just 1 percent in
September, down from a revised 4.6 percent rate of advance in
August. For all of 1988, consumer credit increased 8.5 percent.
   August's net debt increase totaled $2.66 billion, a sharp
revision from the $3.48 billion originally reported last month.

   The tentative agreement, reached Tuesday, still faced obstacles.
But acceptance by members of the Senate and House could result in
action to raise the debt limit and keep the government from running

   Fixed-rate mortgage rates dropped to 9.85
percent in October, the Federal National Mortgage Association said
in a report expressing optimism for the sluggish housing industry.
   Fannie Mae said Tuesday that its monthly national survey showed
October rates for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages down from 9.93
percent in September and returning to their August level.
   The rate had been 9.73 percent in July, the lowest since a 9.25
percent rate in March 1987.
   ``With the prospect of mortgage rates moving somewhat lower
during the next few months after significant declines earlier in the
year, signs of strength in the housing market can be expected to
continue,'' said David W. Berson, the association's chief economist.
   Rates for adjustable mortgages, meanwhile, edged up to 8.55
percent in October from 8.53 percent in September and 8.51 percent
in August.
   As the fixed-rate mortgage rates declined, homebuyers have turned
away from adjustable-rate loans recently. In September, the
percentage of adjustable rate mortgage applications fell to 13
percent, down from 15 percent in August. ARM applications had been
25 percent of total applications in June.

   _Braniff advised ticketholders to call 1-800-282-5586 for
information about refunds.
   _People holding tickets purchased by cash or check before Sept.
28, when Braniff filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, are
considered unsecured creditors. They must apply for refunds directly
to Braniff or the federal bankruptcy court, which eventually will
decide how ticketholders are treated in any reorganization. Braniff
spokeswoman Sandy Smith said those customers should make a copy of
their ticket and send the original to the Refund Accounting Dept.,
Braniff Inc., Box 7035, Dallas, Texas, 75209.
   _People holding tickets purchased with cash or a check after
Sept. 28 also must apply to Braniff for a refund. However, the
airline said those refunds are considered administrative payments
under the bankruptcy case and have a slightly higher priority for
repayment.
   _People holding tickets bought with a credit card have the right
under federal law to a refund or credit for services not performed,
such as an airline ticket for a cancelled flight. Those
ticketholders must apply to their credit card company for a refund
or credit to their account.
   _Some other major carriers on Braniff routes said they would
honor Braniff tickets with various conditions. Eastern Airlines and
Continental Airlines said they would honor Braniff tickets on a
stand-by basis and would honor tickets issued by Braniff for travel
on their own systems on a confirmed basis. Southwest Airlines also
said it would honor Braniff tickets while United Airlines it would

   A new round of layoffs could be coming to Wall
Street as financial firms continue to be pinched by the 2-year-old
slump in the brokerage business, analysts say.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. began laying off employees this week
in a cutback that could total 2 percent of its work force by year's
end.
   ``It's not a problem just for Shearson; everybody has it,'' said
Perrin Long, who follows the industry for Lipper Analytical
Securities Corp. in New York. ``I think we'll be seeing several
cutbacks but in smaller numbers ... to avoid a lot of media
attention.''
   Shearson and other Wall Street firms, particularly retail
brokerages catering to individual investors, have been under
increasing pressure in recent months to trim costs in the face of
rising operating expenses.
   Most are expected to show a decline in trading profits this year
due to the stock market's October plunge and the general pressure on
takeover stocks, which had been the driving force behind the
market's earlier advances.
   The lingering wariness of individual investors since the October
1987 stock market crash also has hurt the industry.
   ``I wouldn't sit here and wait for his (the individual
investor's) imminent return in size,'' said James P. Hanbury, a
securities analyst with Wertheim Schroeder &amp; Co. in New York. ``With
business slow and expenses high something's got to give.''
   Total employment by New York Stock Exchange-member brokerages has
fallen about 10 percent from a peak of 262,173 employees in
September 1987 to 229,455 by mid-1989. The firms had added about
120,000 employees from 1980 to the time of the crash.
   The decline since then coincides with a steady slowing in the
growth of revenue. Jeffrey Schaefer, director of research for the
Securities Industry Association, an industry trade group, said
overall revenue grew from $50 billion in 1986 to $52 billion last
year. Although revenue rose to $60 billion by mid-1989, it was
expected to drop off by the end of the fourth quarter, he said.
   Shearson _ second only to Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in terms of the
number of U.S. retail brokerage offices _ began laying off some of
its 38,500 employees Monday and notified others in a two-paragraph
newsletter that more across-the-board cuts were planned, said
company spokesman Steven Faigen.
   Shearson cited, among other things, the slowdown of market
activity, which includes the buying and selling of stocks and bonds
that generates commissions and trading profits.
   Shearson, a subsidiary of financial services giant American
Express Co., earned $106 million, or 98 cents a share, during the
first three months of this year. That was off 3 percent from
earnings of $110 million, or $1.05 a share, in the same quarter last
year.
   Faigen declined to provide details on Shearson's layoffs and said
only that ``several hundred'' employees would lose their jobs in the
next few weeks. But a company source speaking on condition of
anonymity said as many as 800 people, or 2 percent of the total work
force, could be cut. That would be the largest staff reduction on
Wall Street this year.
   A year ago, Shearson laid off about 1,200 employees. Since then
it has trimmed 300 more jobs.
   Other Wall Street firms have retrenched in varying degrees this
past year.
   Last week, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. laid off more than 100
employees in its taxable fixed-income sales division. The firm
announced earlier this year it was selling its entire retail
brokerage division of 2,300 workers. Over the past three years it
has more than halved its work force from a peak of about 10,000.
   Among the others, First Boston Corp. last spring laid off 200
employees, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. has let go dozens of bond traders
and Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. laid offabout 120 employees,
largely in its municipal bond and stock departments.
   Long said that in addition to gradual cuts, many firms ``are
paying close attention to normal attrition and not rehiring.''

<HEAD>Consumer Debt Additions Slowed in September</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reflecting caution about buying cars and other
expensive goods, American consumers drastically slowed their
borrowing in September, adding only $606 million in credit card and
other debt.
   The Federal Reserve Board reported Tuesday that consumer credit
increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of just 1 percent in
September, down from a revised 4.6 percent rate of advance in
August. For all of 1988, consumer credit increased 8.5 percent.
   August's net debt increase totaled $2.66 billion, a sharp
revision from the $3.48 billion originally reported last month.
   The pace of net borrowing in September was the second slowest of
the year after an actual decline of 0.9 percent in July. That was
the first drop since January 1987 when consumer debt fell 3.4
percent.
   Consumer spending is closely monitored as a gauge of the
economy's health because it represents two-third of all economic
activity. The economy, particularly housing and manufacturing, has
become sluggish in recent months in response to the Fed's campaign
to restrain growth and ease inflationary pressures by keeping
interest rates relatively high.
   Auto loans, which had dropped sharply in July, rebounded a bit in
August, driven by end-of-model-year sales incentives and higher
prices for 1990 models to come. The August sales had the effect of
stealing from those ordinarily expected in September.
   As a result, auto loans in September dropped $842 million, a 3.5
percent annual rate of decline, the Fed said. They were virtually
unchanged in August after declining 6.9 percent in July.
   Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group, said the Fed
report may not accurately reflect the amount of consumer debt since
people have other ways to borrow, such as home equity loans, that
are not included in the survey.
   But she said consumers are becoming more cautious in their
spending, particularly for autos and other durable goods _
big-ticket items expected to last more than three years that often
are financed by loans.
   The category of debt that includes credit cards slowed to a 4.7
percent annual rate of growth from a 21.2 percent advance in August.
Total revolving credit increased $756 million, compared with a gain
of $3.37 billion in August.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose by
$785 million, a 4.8 percent annual rate of growth. That compared
with a decline of $29 million, or 0.2 percent, in August.
   Mobile home debts continued to fall, down $91 million or a 4.8
percent annual rate of decline. This category has fallen for eight
consecutive months, including an August drop of $692 million or 35.1
percent.
   The various changes left total consumer debt in September at a
seasonally adjusted $703.6 billion.

<HEAD>Braniff Employees Gather To Reflect on Airline's Fate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dozen Braniff employees gathered
Tuesday afternoon at Minsky's Pizza &amp; Lounge near Kansas City
International Airport, reflecting on the fate of the carrier on
which they had spent thousands of hours of their lives.
   They had come from all over the country to be part of the
airline's expansion, under which Kansas City was a major hub.
   But as Linda Horn watched the television news of Braniff's sudden
cancellation of its flights, tears began to well in her eyes for the
second time in about a month.
   ``We're a family,'' said Horn, a 16-year Braniff flight
attendant. ``It just breaks my heart.''
   Horn, who recently bought a house, said work in the airline
industry was now over for her.
   ``I'm fatigued. I want to try something else,'' she said.
   For many Braniff employees, the bond among workers was a key
reason they stayed with the carrier, even after their jobs were put
at risk by Braniff's filing for bankruptcy court protection in
September.
   ``That's why we've gone through what we have,'' said J.T.
Carroll, who has worked as a Braniff customer service agent for 17
years. Carroll and some others said they remained optimistic that
Braniff would fly again.
   ``Once again, Braniff employees hold their heads high,'' he said
as he raised a glass.
   But for many of Braniff's workers, the stoppage of flights late
Monday seemed to confirm their previously unspoken fears that little
hope remained for their carrier or their jobs. Some spoke harshly of
Braniff's investors, who have been accused of reaping riches at the
expense of the company and its workers.
   ``This may be the final straw for me,'' said Mary Greene, a
Braniff flight attendant who spent Tuesday interviewing for other
work. ``It's very stressful to wait around for this sort of
announcement.''
   Dick Goduti, a vice chairman of the Air Line Pilots Association,
said, ``I think a lot of pilots were waiting for the other shoe to
fall.'' He added that some pilots were now starting to look for work
elsewhere.
   Neither union officials nor Braniff workers knew late Tuesday
what would become of their jobs. They said they were left in the
dark, just as they were a month ago.

<TEXT>
   Embattled Braniff Inc. closed its corporate
offices and refused further comment after grounding its last 46
daily flights while it seeks investor cash or an outright buyer.
   ``I don't expect any further announcements,'' airline spokeswoman
Sandy Smith at the airline's Orlando headquarters said Tuesday after
the abrupt cancellation of Braniff's schedule.
   Chairman William G. McGee and other executives were busy
arranging details to mothball the carrier's fleet and notify most of
its remaining 1,800 employees that they were without jobs.
   Braniff will determine by Friday the exact size of its remaining
work force, said Thomas Volz, senior vice president of marketing.
   ``It could be 150 to 250 or 300 people,'' Volz said.
   In addition, Volz said, Braniff probably will not honor an
agreement with John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. to extend
employee health insurance coverage through November. If the airline
fails this week to pay premiums to John Hancock or fund the trust
that pays employees' medical claims, coverage ends Friday.
   A severe cash shortage aborted the airline's reorganization plans
under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, said McGee in a
terse statement at midnight Monday. Braniff, which filed for
protection from its creditors on Sept. 28, wants to continue its
charter services while looking for investors or a buyer.
   Braniff's regular charter customers include the Kansas City
Chiefs and the New Orleans Saints football teams.
   ``There are no plans at this point to gave consideration to
liquidation,'' said Volz. He said discussions are under way ``with
potential investors'' whom he declined to identify.
   The carrier had been operating from week to week by relying on
emergency infusions of cash approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Orlando. In its bankruptcy filing, Braniff listed debt of $347
million and assets of $326 million.
   Before the filing, the carrier operated 256 round-trip flights a
day and employed up to 4,800.
   ``They pissed away all their cash at the rate of $300,000 a day
when they should have been preserving their cash for a restart of
the airline,'' said Scott Hamilton, editor of ``Commercial Aviation
Report,'' a newsletter based in Dallas.
   ``Continental and Eastern could fly through their bankruptcies
because they had multi-millions of cash on hand,'' Hamilton said,
referring to the Texas Air Corp. carriers that have undergone
bankruptcy reorganizations. Eastern is now flying under Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings.
   ``Braniff had only $3 million to $10 million in cash on hand,''
he said, noting that the airline needed $50 million to $100 million
to survive. Braniff had as much as $31.6 million in February, but
was down to only $3.6 million by July 31.
   Meanwhile, Braniff said, a meeting of its unsecured creditors
took place Tuesday in Orlando. But the airline would not comment on
what was discussed.
   However, a source close to the case contacted by the Kansas City
Times said Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, which was retained by
Braniff to explore alternatives for the carrier, made a presentation
about the airline's financial condition. No potential buyers were
discussed, however.
   The abrupt schedule stoppage surprised and angered employees and
left a few unsuspecting customers frustrated in Orlando, Kansas
City, Dallas and other major airports.
   Ticket-holders were advised on a toll-free telephone line to
check with other airlines ``who may honor tickets in some cases.''
   Braniff ticket and check-in counters were unstaffed Tuesday, and
passengers were getting varying responses from other carriers.
   Eastern was taking Braniff customers on a standby basis, United
was giving Braniff ticket-holders a 50 percent discount on a
full-fare coach ticket, and Continental and Southwest also were
honoring tickets, with some restrictions.
   There were no long lines at Braniff ticket counters like those
that formed in September when the carrier filed for bankruptcy
protection, but the few customers who did show up Tuesday were
confused and bitter.
   ``We don't know what we're going to do,'' said Helaine Ruglio.
She and her husband, Richard, both 27, were in Orlando on a
seven-day vacation. They were scheduled to leave for New Jersey on
Tuesday evening, but went to the airport nine hours early when they
heard of Braniff's cancellations.
   In 1982, a much larger Braniff filed for bankruptcy protection
when it was nearly $1 billion in debt. Two years later, the airline
started flying again as a low-cost, no-frills carrier.
   The company was acquired by BIA-COR, an investor group formed by
PaineWebber Inc., in June 1988, and shifted most of its flight
operations from Dallas to Kansas City.

<HEAD>Times to Close Plant, Consolidate Operations at New Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Times said it does not expect to lay
off workers when it closes a New Jersey printing plant.
   Times spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen said the bulk of the 1,200
workers employed at the plant in Carlstadt would be transferred to
the Edison, N.J. plant where new color presses are to begin
operating next summer.
   ``We do not expect layoffs,'' Nielsen said, and buyouts are a
possibility that would be discussed.
   The Times said in a statement that the decision to close the
Carlstadt plant was influenced by a two-year decline in advertising
revenue _ ``a trend which is expected to continue in 1990.''
   George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council,
said the number of jobs that would be lost was ``open for
discussion.''
   ``We are both united, both the unions and the company _ united
for the benefit of getting this up and running without any
problems,'' McDonald said after an afternoon meeting where Times
Publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger and Lance R. Primis, president of
the Times, addressed leaders of the 10 unions represented by the
council.
   ``As in the past, the Times will work with its unions to find
ways to insure the security of its regular employees,'' Sulzberger
said in a statement.
   The unions' contracts, which do not expire until March 30, 1993,
agree to what the Times statement called ``the orderly, successful
and efficient start up and operation of the new plant'' and the use
of arbitration to resolve any disputes.
   Advertising linage declined 5.5 percent in 1988 compared to 1987
and declined 7.9 percent for the first three quarters this year, the
Times said.
   Nielsen said that no figures were available to compare the linage
decline and the decline in revenue.
   But revenues were up for The New York Times Co., she said. In the
first nine months of this year, revenues were $1.29 million, versus
$1.25 million for the same period last year.
   The company's newspaper group, consisting of the Times and 35
regional newspapers, had revenue of $1.02 billion for the first nine
months of 1989, versus $1.01 billion for the same period in 1988.
Nielsen said there were no separate figures for the Times. The bulk
of the revenue comes from advertising.
   The Times circulation also climbed, according to Audit Bureau of
Circulations figures quoted by the newspaper. Circulation reached a
record for the six-month period ended Sept. 30 of more than 1
million on weekdays, up 2.8 percent over the same period last year.
   Sunday circulation was up 1.7 percent during the same period to
more than 1.6 million.
   The automated Edison presses, which will cost more than their
original estimate in excess of $400 million, are situated on 45
acres of land and will greatly increase production. Automatic Guided
Vehicles, or AGV robots, are part of the production, which is
estimated to be 70 percent complete.

<HEAD>Former Senator Blasts Merc Board, Resigns</HEAD>
<HEAD>Laserphoto ST3 of Nov. 7</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the National Futures Association
defended the integrity of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange after a
former U.S. senator cried foul and quit the exchange's board of
directors.
   Former Sen. Thomas F. Eagleton resigned Tuesday, saying concern
for ``fat cat'' insiders outweighs the interest of the average
investor at the world's second-largest futures exchange.
   Eagleton accused the Merc of trying to protect its former
chairman, Brian Monieson, who is before a Commodity Futures Trading
Commission hearing board this week on charges of failing to stop two
employees from defrauding investors.
   Bob Wilmouth, president of the National Futures Association, said
he admires and respects Eagleton but disagrees with the criticism,
saying the Merc punishes those who break exchange rules.
   ``I think if you go back and take a look ... (Merc officials)
have severely punished the violators that they have found,''
Wilmouth said in a telephone interview from his home.
   Eagleton said the board's efforts regarding the former chairman
was ``the straw that broke the camel's back,'' and said he had
become increasingly disappointed by the board's decisions.
   ``When a serious decision is made by the board, I have found that
consistently it's what's best for the insiders that prevails, not
necessarily what's best for the public,'' Eagleton said from his law
firm in St. Louis.
   Because of its concern for insiders, the Merc cannot be trusted
by the public to police itself, Eagleton said.
   ``Joe Six-pack sitting in St. Louis can have no confidence that
the order he's entering is going to be treated the same as a fat
cat's order within the Mercantile Exchange,'' Eagleton said. ``He
just can't have any confidence in that, and that's a rotten shame.''
   The Merc issued a three-sentence statement saying Eagleton's
resignation was accepted.
   Dave Gary, a spokesman for the CFTC in Washington, D.C., said the
commission had no immediate comment.
   As evidence that the exchange protects its own, Eagleton pointed
to the willingness of Wilmouth and Merc Executive Committee Chairman
Leo Melamed to act as character witnesses in the CFTC action against
Monieson.
   But Wilmouth said Tuesday he has decided not to testify on
Monieson's behalf, citing the advice of attorneys who examined the
Merc's code of ethics.
   Home telephone numbers for Monieson and his attorney, Jerrold
Salzman, were not available in the Chicago area. Melamed has an
unpublished number.
   Eagleton was serving his second two-year term on the 31-member
board of directors, one of six board-appointed public or industry
members. The remaining 25 directors are elected from among Merc
members.
   ``His service has been appreciated although there have been some
differences of opinion in recent months,'' the Merc statement said.
   Although the CFTC does not allege that Monieson himself engaged
in fraud, it contends in an 18-page complaint that from at least
January 1986 until May 1986, ``he did not act in good faith and-or
knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the fraudulent trade
allocation by'' the two GNP brokers.
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, also a former Merc
president, has been identified as a potential character witnesses
for Monieson in the seven-day hearing. Yeutter has not yet testified.
   Monieson is head of GNP Commodities Inc. in Chicago.

   Stock prices rose today, extending Tuesday's
rally on signs of a new move toward a more stimulative Federal
Reserve credit policy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 17.21 to 2,614.34
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 586 up, 247
down and 449 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 27.11 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Stocks turned upward Tuesday on evidence that the Federal Reserve
was taking steps in the money markets to encourage interest rates to
decline. News accounts this morning quoted unnamed government
officials as saying that inference was correct.
   Analysts said the news heartened stock traders who had been
growing increasingly apprehensive about the possibility of a
recession.
   Wall Streeters still expect corporate profits, which came in
below expectations for the third quarter, to be disappointing for
the next few months.
   But the Fed could presumably cushion the impact of an economic
slowdown in the future by relaxing its credit policy now.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up { at 41];
General Electric, up \ at 53}; McDonald's, up \ at 30}, and American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up \ at 43}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
1.05 to 186.79. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .64 at 369.15.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 14.96
points to 2,597.13.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 11 to 9 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 813 issues up, 662

<HEAD>Hoylake Intends to Pursue BAT Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hoylake Investments Ltd., who this year made a $21
billion hostile bid for BAT Industries PLC, intends to pursue a
takeover of the British tobacco giant, a Hoylake shareholder said
Wednesday.
   Anglo Group PLC, which was formed by Anglo-French financier Sir
James Goldsmith and owns a stake in Hoylake, included the
announcement in its six-month earnings statement.
   Goldsmith also heads the investment group that created Hoylake to
launch the $21 billion takeover of the British conglomerate BAT last
July.
   Hoylake's offer for BAT lapsed in September after Britain's
Takeover Panel, which monitors mergers and acquisitions, said the
group could relaunch its bid after it clears regulatory hurdles with
U.S. insurance commissioners.
   The bidders are seeking approval from U.S. state insurance
commissioners to change the ownership of BAT's Farmers Insurance
Group Inc. of Los Angeles, which some say could take months.
   Anglo said Wednesday that Hoylake ``firmly intends to make a new
offer for BAT within 21 days of the clearance date.''
   Hoylake held between 2 percent and 3 percent of BAT's shares at
the last announced count.
   Goldsmith, who wants to sell all of BAT's non-tobacco interests,
has said he intends to pursue a takeover of BAT.
   Anglo said the structure of a new bid would depend on ``the
progress of BAT's announced reorganization and upon market
conditions at the time that such a bid is launched.''
   BAT, the world's biggest tobacco company, last month received
shareholder approval to restructure itself to fend off the bid.
   The restructuring involved the sale of BAT's U.S. retailing
businesses, including Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's chains,
and the spinning off of its paper businesses.
   BAT also intends to buy back 10 percent of its own stock.

   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed this
morning on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Corn was steady to slighty lower after reports that Mexico and
South Korea have entered the market for about 280,000 metric tons of
corn.
   Analysts say corn prices may drift lower in expectation of
tomorrow's U.S. Agriculture Department crop report. The report is
expected to contain an upward revision in this year's corn
production.
   Prices of soybeans softened on concerns about quiet soymeal
trading in Europe.
   The pressure on wheat prices stems from the failure of the Soviet
Union to show up in the market as had been expected, said William
Biederman, an analyst with Allendale Inc. in Chicago.
   In early trading, wheat was a \ cent to 2 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.03{ a bushel; corn was a \
cent lower to } cent higher with December at $2.37} a bushel; oats
were 1 cent to 1\ cents lower with December at $1.42{ a bushel;
soybeans were a \ cent to 2\ cents lower with November at $5.62{ a

   Livestock and pork futures were mixed in early trading on the

<HEAD>Debt Comes Due As Exports, Tourism, Foreign Lending Slows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first big pile of bills from China's
decade-long economic boom are coming due next year, and the timing
couldn't be worse.
   Foreign exchange earnings are down: tourism is a major casualty
of martial law in Beijing and export growth is hobbled by severe
shortages of energy, raw materials and cash.
   Foreign commercial banks, which will be needed to roll over and
reschedule some of the debt, are still warily assessing the
political and economic fallout from the June power struggle and army
crackdown on student protesters.
   Foreign banks have joined recently in arranging three group loans
for Chinese state-owned companies, each involving about $50 million.
Finland's government decided in October to grant China a $7 million
interest-free loan to buy a Finnish paper mill.
   But one Western banker said the message from home offices is
still ``go slow with long-term commitments.'' For now, any new loans
will cost the Chinese at least half a percentage point more in
interest than before June, and bankers want shorter terms and more
guarantees.
   ``There's a crisis of confidence,'' the banker said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The green light everyone is waiting for is the resumption of new
World Bank loans, halted in June because of the confusion in
Beijing. The World Bank's major shareholders, including the United
States, have prolonged the freeze as a political sanction.
   The Asian Development Bank, which also offers low-interest loans,
must make a decision before the end of its fiscal year in December
on whether to go ahead with loans to China. Its president, Masao
Fujioka, said recently that the bank still was preparing loan
proposals.
   Chinese officials, meanwhile, insist their credit-worthiness
remains good.
   Vice Finance Minister Liu Zhongli has repeatedly said China will
have no difficulty in paying back loans. But he acknowledged for the
first time in October that it would be possible only by taking out
new loans.
   He also said China might set up special debt-service funds to
make sure money is available for repaying debts.
   China's foreign debt, $15.8 billion in 1985, jumped by about $10
billion dollars in 1987 and again in 1988 as cities raced to build
luxury hotels and offices towers and factories imported modern
assembly lines.
   The total is now about $42 billion, with about $7 billion in
principal and interest due in 1990, the first big repayment year.
   The government also has a domestic deficit that it is covering by
cracking down on tax delinquency and issuing new ``guaranteed value
public debt'' notes. The notes are sold in units starting at $5.40.
Most work places are requiring employees to buy at least one.
Workers already are required to buy treasury bonds amounting to half
a month's salary each year.
   The external debt, which must be paid in foreign exchange,
presents a greater challenge. Most of it was contracted for projects
expected to generate foreign exchange. Eighty percent of the loans
went to construction projects, including luxury hotels and office
buildings for foreign businessmen.
   But even before June's violent attack on the student
pro-democracy demonstrators scared away tourists and businessmen,
real estate experts agreed the sector was overbuilt.
   Since June, few hotels have been able to achieve 50 percent
occupancy. Rentals of newly opening office towers have slowed, and
foreign bankers say they are quietly rescheduling loans on many
projects.
   Other foreign loans went to modernize export industries such as
textiles, but shortages of cotton, raw silk and energy have hampered
growth.
   Despite the problems, foreign bankers say China's credit rating
remains good, and that it is just a matter of time before outrage
over June's events fades and their home offices approve a return to
business as usual.
   ``Our experience is quite good. They are strict in their
repayment,'' said the Western banker.
   Assessments are mixed as to whether China's year-old austerity
program, which has drastically tightened domestic credit and slashed
new construction, has made the investment climate better or worse.
Inflation has dropped sharply: September prices were up just 13
percent from the previous September.
   But credit has become so short that many companies lack operating
funds and in some places business has deteriorated to barter.
   ``I wouldn't give a penny to a (Chinese) factory as a borrower,''
said another foreign banker. But he said major institutions such as
the Bank of China and China International Trust and Investment Corp.
remain good risks.

<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tiny woman whirls around carpet rolls on a
motorized cart, approaches a customer and asks: ``Are you finding
anything?''
   Nearly 96, Rose Blumkin is back selling furniture and carpeting
at a new store she hopes will compete with the first one she founded
52 years ago and left last May in a power struggle with her two
grandsons.
   Customers who remember her from Nebraska Furniture Mart, one of
the nation's largest individual furniture stores, are finding their
way across the street to Mrs. B.'s Warehouse. And it hasn't even
opened officially.
   ``I got the devil in me. I'll fight as much as I can,'' Mrs.
Blumkin said recently as she spun around the store, helping
customers and talking about her plans for the future.
   ``My two grandsons say I'm too old and too cranky. They don't
know nothing,'' she said.
   Mrs. Blumkin, a 4-foot-11 Russian emigrant who began selling
furniture in the basement of her husband's secondhand store, built
Nebraska Furniture Mart into a business that had more than $150
million in sales last year.
   The store is known throughout the Midwest for its policy to
``sell cheap and always tell the truth'' and ships furniture to
customers throughout the United States.
   Mrs. B sold the business for $55 million in 1983 to Berkshire
Hathaway Inc., but remained chairman and ran the carpeting
department until May 3 of this year, when she walked out in a
dispute with two grandsons.
   She said her grandsons, Ronald and Irvin Blumkin, thought she
paid too much for carpeting and charged too little.
   Ronald Blumkin, the president, said he views his grandmother's
nearby store as competition. ``We're not going to treat any
competitor differently,'' he said.
   Mrs. Blumkin has a long way to go to threaten Nebraska Furniture
Mart, but she is trying.
   One woman in the store recently walked over with three samples of
the carpet she ordered from Nebraska Furniture Mart. Mrs. Blumkin
quoted the woman prices slashed down from the marked prices.
   ``I'll guarantee you to save $350 maybe $400,'' Mrs. Blumkin
said. ``I don't need no money. I want to get even with them. ... I'm
going to give them all the hell I can.''
   A mother of four, grandmother of 12 and great-grandmother of 18,
Mrs. Blumkin sometimes tells her customers what they want, or should
want.
   ``I always stuck in my nose and saw that they bought right,'' she
said.
   Cherene Lantis of Omaha knows that firsthand. Mrs. Lantis, 27,
who bought carpeting from Mrs. Blumkin at Nebraska Furniture Mart a
few years ago, was in Mrs. B's Warehouse recently to buy more
carpeting.
   ``I'll come to her first,'' Mrs. Lantis said. ``She gives you a
good deal. She doesn't cheat you. I love her. She's real honest.''
   She remembers Mrs. Blumkin arguing with her in Nebraska Furniture
Mart that she didn't need as good a quality of carpeting in her
bedrooms as in other areas that had higher traffic.
   She also remembers Mrs. Blumkin giving her 3-year-old daughter a
ride through Nebraska Furniture Mart on her cart.
   Mrs. Blumkin said she cried every day for two months after she
quit before deciding to take some of her earnings and start over
again.
   Her day is long. She gets up at 6 a.m. She is at the store by 9
a.m. and works until 5 p.m. She then often goes with a driver around
town, checking out parking lots and stores of competitors, until as
late as 9 p.m.
   ``To me, it's the biggest punishment when I'm home,'' she said.
   One of eight children born to a rabbi and his wife in a small
town near Minsk in western Russia, she learned to read and write but
had little formal education. Nevertheless, she calculates square
footage and price estimates quickly in her head.
   She came to the United States in 1917 via Siberia and China. She
said she talked her way past a border guard out of Russia.
   ``I told the guard that I was buying leather for the army and I
would bring him back a bottle of vodka. They're still waiting,'' she
said with the accent that lingers from the country she left 72 years
ago.
   Mrs. Blumkin will be 96 years old on Dec. 15. ``I am absolutely
awed by her,'' said her oldest daughter, Frances Batt. ``At this
stage of her life she has her eye on the future.''

<HEAD>Bush Sign Debt Limit Hike</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 2nd graf to change tense, note historical significance

<TEXT>
   President Bush today signed a bill raising the
government's borrowing limit to $3.1 trillion, averting a government
financial crisis and allowing the Treasury to replenish its empty
coffers.
   Congress had approved the legislation raising the national debt
ceiling the night before. The bill allows the government to avoid a
default on paying its bills for the first time in history.
   The Treasury Department said that with the higher limit in place
it would resume borrowing immediately. An auction of $16 billion in
three-month and six-month bills, originally scheduled for Monday but
reset for later today, will permit the government to redeem the
$13.8 billion in Treasury bills that mature on Thursday.
   Its passage also sets the stge for pressurized confrontations
between the Democratic-controlled Congress and Bush on a range of
issues _ such as how to stem the tide of red ink that has led to the
nation's huge debt burden.
   ``It provides momentum,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman
Leon Panetta, D-Calif. Lawmakers will focus on wrapping up some
long-contentious issues because ``there really is a chance to
conclude the Congress before Thanksgiving,'' he said.
   The Senate, by voice vote, and then the House, by 269-99, sent
the debt bill to Bush Tuesday night. The measure increases the
borrowing limit by $300 billion to finance government operations
well into 1991.
   Despite such highly touted efforts as the Gramm-Rudman law,
government spending continues to outpace revenue, recently at a rate
of $150 billion a year.
   As a result, the government has been forced to borrow more and
more money. The new statutory debt ceiling, an increase from the
$2.8 trillion already borrowed, is more than three times what it was
at the beginning of the 1980s.
   The Treasury had said that unless they were allowed to issue new
debt, the government would have been unable to pay its debts on
Thursday. It would have been the first-ever default by the U.S.
government, a calamity for the world financial markets and America's
prestige.
   The debt bill was passed following days of complex negotiations
between the two parties on Capitol Hill and the president's
representatives.
   As a result of the talks, divisive issues such as Bush's capital
gains tax cut and a move to repeal the Medicare catastrophic illness
law were kept off the debt bill rather than risk default.
   The debt bill did carry one legislative sweetener: repeal of a
provision in the 1986 income tax law known as Section 89.
   The provision prohibited employer-financed health insurance plans
from discriminating against lower-paid workers. Business said it was
an onerous burden, and its repeal was widely supported in both
parties.
   As part of the deal allowing the debt bill to speed through
Tuesday night, the House was expected to pass for a second time a
measure to repeal the catastrophic illness law.
   The repeal was attached earlier this year in the House to a
deficit-reduction bill that is still pending. The Senate countered
with a plan to scale back, but not completely repeal the
catastrophic law.
   The White House and congressional leaders have now agreed to
consider catastrophic separately from the deficit bill. That
decision was made easier because the repeal would increase the
deficit, at least in the short term.
   Bush last week agreed to drop his push for a capital gains tax
cut this year. He changed his focus to pressuring Congress to pass a
strong deficit-reduction bill.
   Under the Gramm-Rudman law, annual government spending in fiscal
1991 was automatically cut $16.1 billion dollars beginning Oct. 1.
If a deficit reduction bill is passed and signed by the president,
those cuts would be at least partially reversed.
   The House and Senate are currently negotiating apackage of cuts
in entitlement spending and selected tax increases which would help
meet the deficit-reduction goals.

<HEAD>Oregon Company Offers $1.7 Billion For Arizona Public Service</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS details and edits throughout.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PacifiCorp today announced a $1.7 billion buyout
offer for Arizona Public Service Co., the state's largest utility,
from its financially troubled parent Pinnacle West Capital Corp.
   Pinnacle West also is the holding company for MeraBank, a federal
savings bank that has suffered increasing losses and is under
federal mandate to increase its capital reserves.
   PacifiCorp said it was offering to purchase all outstanding
common stock in the Arizona utility for $1.7 billion. Pinnacle West
holds all of Arizona Public Service's approximately 71 million
common shares, a PacifiCorp spokesman said.
   PacifiCorp, based in Portland, Ore., said the cash buyout would
enable Pinnacle West ``to strengthen its other businesses.''
   Pinnacle West executives and spokesmen did not immediately return
telephone calls.
   Patrick Slattery, PacifiCorp's public information manager in
Portland, said: ``Our intent is for a friendly merger.''
   Slattery said PacifiCorp became interested in the Arizona utility
after acquiring Utah Power, based in Salt Lake City. ``We have
gained significant experience in what types of mergers would be
beneificial for our customers,'' he said.
   Under PacifiCorp, Slattery said Arizona Public Service customers
would be subject to no more than 2 percent annual rate increases
over the next four years. He said that customers would face
``significant rate increases'' if Pinnacle West maintained ownership.
   Arizona Public Service supplies elecricity to some 1.6 million
people in Arizona, according to industry figures.
   It is a part owner of the three-reactor Palo Verde Nuclear
Generating Station, located about 50 miles west of downtown Phoenix.
Other part owners include the Salt River Project in Arizona and
additional utilities in California, New Mexico and Texas.
   Pinnacle West's MeraBank unit has been hurt by general weakness
in the Southwest real estate market, which has increased the number
of its non-performing loans while reducing revenue from loan
origination fees, analysts say.
   Federal regulators are demanding that Pinnacle West pump an
additional $180 million into MeraBank to guarantee against
insolvency. The Arizona Corporation Commission in July temporarily
capped the amount of dividends that Arizona Public Service could pay
to Pinnacle West.
   MeraBank lost $209 million in 1988 and $85.7 million in the third
quarter of this year, and a 13,000-member group of stockholders of
Pinnacle West Capital urged in June that MeraBank be spun off.
   MeraBank officials on July 18 announced a turnaround plan for the
savings bank, including layoffs, sales of subsidiaries and
repossessed real estate, and tight restrictions on loan-making.
   While the plan is expected to reduce annual overhead to $80
million from $148 million within five years, MeraBank still expects
to continue to lose money because of non-performing loans until the
real estate market recovers.
   Pinnacle West bought MeraBank in December 1986 for $426 million.

   Here are short profiles of some of the major
figures in Wall Street's financial scandals:
   _IVAN BOESKY, 52, the former speculator in takeover stocks,
became the hub of the insider trading scandal when he was charged by
the Securities and Exchange Commission. The silver-haired arbitrager
paid $100 million in fines and restitution and agreed to plead
guilty to one count of lying to federal regulators to settle his
case on Nov. 14, 1986. His cooperation with prosecutors has yielded
a mother lode of investigations and prosecutions. Now serving a
three-year prison sentence in Lompoc, Calif., Boesky is eligible for
release in April 1990.
   _MICHAEL R. MILKEN, 43, former head of junk-bond trading at
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., faces a 1990 trial on racketeering and
fraud charges for a series of alleged schemes, most with Boesky.
Milken, who is credited with creating the $200 billion market for
junk bonds, resigned from Drexel in June to form his own consulting
firm. He has pleaded innocent and plans a court fight, which is
expected to include testimony by his chief accuser, Boesky.
   _DENNIS LEVINE, 36, was paroled last September after serving 17
months of a two-year prison term for securities fraud, tax evasion
and perjury. The original target in the recent crackdown, Levine's
confessions about a broad insider trading ring led prosecutors to
Boesky. The former Drexel managing director, who accepted satchels
of money and arranged deals from pay phones, pleaded guilty to four
felonies and returned $11.6 million in alleged illegal profits.
Levine told a group of business students this year he has formed a
mergers and acquisitions consulting firm. ``I'm sorry I broke the
law,'' he said.
   _MARTIN SIEGEL, 40, pleaded guilty in 1987 to illegal stock
trading and tax evasion while head of mergers and acquisitions at
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. He also agreed to return $9 million in cash
and securities to settle civil charges for his role in illegal
dealings with Boesky. Siegel, also a former Drexel managing
director, named names for the government and is expected to be
sentenced by the end of the year.
   _BOYD L. JEFFERIES, 58, the workaholic Los Angeles stockbroker
snared in the Boesky web, in July was placed on probation and fined
$250,000 after two years of helping the government. He pleaded
guilty to two felony counts in 1987 and then testified in the trials
of GAF Corp. and corporate raider Paul Bilzerian. Jefferies, who
admitted to a stock concealment scheme with Boesky, was banned from
the securities business for five years but plans eventually to
return to the brokerage that bears his name.
   _PAUL A. BILZERIAN, 39, the Florida investor with mutton-chop
sideburns, in September was sentenced to four years in prison for
his conviction on nine counts of securities fraud, conspiracy and
making false statements, and fined $1.5 million. The sentence for
the former Singer Co. chairman was the stiffest so far. Bilzerian,
who seized control of Singer in a $1.06 billion deal but has stepped
down as chairman, continues to deny the charges and is free pending
appeal.
   _STEPHEN WANG JR., 25, recently was released after serving eight
months in prison for a September 1988 guilty plea to mail, wire and
securities fraud. The former Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. junior analyst
allegedly made $200,000 from a multimillion-dollar insider trading
scheme. ``You had a brilliant future and you blew it,'' a judge told
him at sentencing. Wang is ``trying to get his life back in order,''
his attorney, Ira Lee Sorkin, said.
   _ROBERT FREEMAN, 46, former head of arbitrage for Goldman, Sachs
&amp; Co., was arrested along with two other executives for insider
trading in the most dramatic of the government's string of cases.
Implicated by Siegel, Freeman negotiated for his future after the
government failed to bring an indictment. In August, he agreed to
plead guilty to one felony count and is awaiting sentencing. Cases
were dropped against the two other officials, Timothy Tabor and
Richard Wigton, who was arrested on his trading floor in handcuffs.
   _BRUCE LEE NEWBERG, 32, a former Drexel trader, has been indicted
in the Milken case and convicted along with five others in the
Princeton-Newport Partners racketeering and fraud trial. He was
sentenced to three months in prison in the Princeton-Newport case.
Newberg was Milken's assistant at Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif.,
high-yield bond division. In a tape played at the Princeton-Newport
trial, Newberg told an executive of the investment firm after a
shady deal: ``Welcome to the world of being a sleaze.''
   _R. FOSTER WINANS, 41, is the former Wall Street Journal reporter
who was convicted of passing on tips from his ``Heard on the
Street'' column to a stockbroker in a failed get-rich-quick scheme
that predated the Boesky era. Winans went on a speaking tour, wrote
a book about his downfall and then served less than a year of an
18-month prison term.
   _LISA JONES, 26, a former Drexel trading assistant, was convicted
in April of lying to a federal grand jury during the government's
investigation of the firm. The one-time teen-age runaway climbed to
a $100,000 position logging trades for Bruce Newberg and traveling
regularly to New York and London. A federal judge ordered 18 months
in prison and psychological treatment for the shy woman the
government said lied 150 times during various questionings.
   _SEYMOUR ``RUDY'' RUDERMAN, 63, former broadcast editor of
Business Week, was released last week from a federal camp in Forth
Worth, Texas, after serving about six months for trading on inside
information gleaned from purloined copies of the influential
magazine. Ruderman's ruse was the tip of a still-widening probe of
illegal trading in which various brokers, printers and others paid
for the ``Inside Wall Street'' column the day before its publication.

<HEAD>Insider Trading in Waldbaum Takeover Raises Legal Storm</HEAD>

   When Ira Waldbaum decided in 1986 to sell the
grocery store chain bearing his name, he told his sister, who told
her daughter, who told her husband, who told his stockbroker, who
used the information to buy the company's stock.
   Broker Robert Chestman was convicted of charges related to
insider trading in a case experts say demonstrates the vagueness of
federal securities laws.
   Although small by the standards of other Ivan Boesky-era
prosecutions, the Waldbaum case sent a man to prison, caused turmoil
in a well-known family business and raised issues possibly destined
for the Supreme Court.
   ``Factually, it's as straightforward as you could imagine,'' said
Robert L. Plotz, a former assistant U.S. attorney on the case. ``It
involved one tip in one instance and one set of trades and then a
pattern of coverup for several months afterward.''
   Prosecutors say the case happened this way:
   On the Friday before Thanksgiving in 1986, Waldbaum agreed to
sell the grocery business founded by his grandfather in 1921 to the
Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. _ better known as A&amp;P _ for $50 a
share, or $28.7 million.
   The following Sunday, he told his sister, Shirley Witkin, about
the deal, stressing that the information had to remain confidential
until it was announced publicly.
   Witkin went to a Long Island bank with one daughter to remove her
Waldbaum stock certificates and later informed another daughter,
Susan Loeb, who in turn told her husband, Keith.
   Keith Loeb then told stockbroker Chestman, who bought 11,000
shares of Waldbaum Inc. for about $25 each, making overnight profits
of $250,000 for himself and several clients, including Loeb.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, alerted to the trading by
routine post-merger stock market surveillance, filed civil charges.
Loeb cooperated with investigators. Chestman was charged criminally
and convicted by a jury last March on 31 counts.
   The Waldbaum case wasn't a big-money swindle. Keith Loeb, who
with his wife legitimately made $1.6 million on family shares from
the A&amp;P deal, earned $22,000 from the illicit trades, which occurred
just 12 days after Boesky admitted to the largest insider trading
ring ever.
   The case expanded securities law interpretation to encompass
disclosure of secrets down a lengthy chain of tipsters. No prior
criminal case had involved confidential information passed among
several family members.
   At issue is whether confidentiality carries down from a corporate
inner sanctum. Does a family member who works outside the company
have any duty to the corporation? Does that duty transfer to an
outsider who profits from nonpublic information?
   ``The problem here is information is inherently leaking,'' said
Columbia University law professor John C. Coffee Jr. ``At some point
it becomes a market rumor. This is in that zone where it is a little
bit more specific than a market rumor.''
   Ira Waldbaum took over six Brooklyn grocery stores in 1947 after
his father died, expanding Waldbaum into a 137-supermarket chain in
New York and New England. The family owned more than 60 percent when
Waldbaum was sold to A&amp;P.
   Testimony at the federal court trial in Manhattan last spring
revealed that Waldbaum ran the company tightly but that the family
wasn't particularly close. Waldbaum had trouble telling his two
nieces apart and visited his 90-year-old mother just a few times a
year, testimony showed.
   The business nonetheless was a family affair, so Waldbaum got
word out about the company's sale _ a legal disclosure under
securities law. All family members were told to keep the information
secret.
   Loeb testified he called Chestman, a senior vice president at
Gruntal &amp; Co. and his broker since 1982, on the morning of
Wednesday, Nov. 26. ``I told him that Waldbaum's is about to be sold
and it would be substantially higher than it was currently trading
at,'' he said.
   Loeb did not cite his source or say the information was
confidential.
   Brokerage records show Chestman bought 3,000 shares of Waldbaum
stock for himself that day and 8,000 for Loeb and other clients, at
prices ranging from $24.62{ to $26 a share.
   The sale to A&amp;P was announced after the close of the market. By
the end of the next business day, Waldbaum stock had surged to $49 a
share.
   Chestman denied talking to Loeb on Wednesday morning. The timing
of Chestman's stock purchases, lawyers said, was a ``staggering
coincidence.'' He bought the shares because Waldbaum trading volume
was high and the company was sound.
   Loeb testified that shortly after the sale he became nervous and
even asked Chestman if he could rescind the trades. After learning
of an SEC inquiry, Loeb admitted to lying to a Waldbaum lawyer about
the trades.
   In April, the SEC showed Ira Waldbaum a list of buyers of
Waldbaum stock that Wednesday including Keith Loeb and Joseph
Sierchio, another nephew by marriage. ``I would say I was rather
surprised,'' Waldbaum testified.
   Loeb paid the SEC more than $45,000 in alleged illegal profits
and penalties. Sierchio, a New York securities lawyer, paid a total
of $123,000 and was not prosecuted.
   Chestman's conviction hinged on whether Loeb had a duty to the
Waldbaum company via the family and whether Chestman knew he was
breaching it.
   The government argued that Loeb had a duty to his wife, who had a
duty to her mother, who had a duty to Ira Waldbaum, who had a duty
to the company. But Chestman attorney Elkan Abramowitz said:
``That's too flimsy to be the basis for criminal action.''
   ``There was no pre-existing relationship of trust and confidence
established beyond the fact that these people were related,''
Abramowitz argued before the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
earlier this month.
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney E. Scott Gilbert told the three-judge
panel that all family members were intertwined in a legal bond, and
Chestman knew it.
   ``He's taking the rap for the breach of a family relationship,''
Judge Roger Miner said in questioning Gilbert.
   ``No, he's taking the rap, your honor, for taking stolen
information and trading on it,'' Gilbert replied.
   Chestman, 42, began serving a two-year sentence shortly after
conviction, rather than wait for the appeal to finish. He is
eligible for parole from a minimum-security prison in Allenwood,

   Abramowitz said his client, whose wife and three children live on
Long Island, felt he couldn't get a job until the case was behind
him so he decided to serve time as soon as possible. He said the

this particular family was,'' Abramowitz said. ``Dreadful.''

   Stocks in London closed sharply higher Wednesday
largely on technical factors and positive sentiment stemming from
Wall Street's continued recovery from its steep loss at the start of
the week.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 25.6
points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 2,203.6, above the
psychologically important 2,200 level for the first time in nearly a
month.
   The Financial Times 30-share index ended 20.4 points higher at
1,774.2. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 13.25 points to
close at 1,217.63.
   Volume was a healthy 427.7 million shares, up from 416.9 million

<TEXT>
   Mesa Airlines Inc. and Air Midwest Inc.
Wednesday announced they have called off negotiations on Mesa's
possible takeover of Air Midwest, a carrier that has lost business
due to the problems at Braniff Inc. Gary Risley, Mesa's vice
president for corporate affairs, said the companies mutually decided
to end negotiations Tuesday and that Mesa has withdrawn its cash
plus stock offer for Air Midwest's outstanding shares.
   ``Basically both parties negotiated in good faith for a good deal
of time and there were just a couple of issues that could not be
agreed upon,'' he said.
   Risley declined to discuss specifically why the airlines
terminated the negotiations.
   Robert Priddy, Air Midwest's president and chief executive
officer, also declined to discuss why the negotiations broke down.
   ``Both parties negotiated in good faith. When you're working on a
definitive merger agreement there are a lot of points. We just
couldn't agree on some of them,'' he said.
   Priddy said he did not know whether other companies were waiting
to approach Air Midwest with takeover proposals.
   Air Midwest's board in June rejected Resort Air's $31 million
buyout offer.
   Mesa on Oct. 12 sent a letter to Priddy asking to enter into an
exclusive agreement that would lead to an acquisition of Air Midest,
based in Wichita, Kan.
   Mesa's negotiating suggestion of $6.34 per share of Air Midwest
stock, based on the market price at the time the letter was sent,
calculated to more than $24 million.
   Risley said acquiring Air Midwest would have given Mesa flights
that travel from the Southwest to the Midwest.
   Air Midwest has 42 airplanes and serves 39 cities in Kansas,
Missouri, Colorado, Nebraska, Iowa, Indiana, Arkansas, Alabama,
Kentucky, Illinois and Tennessee.
   The airline was hit hard by the recent bankruptcy reorganization
attempt by Braniff Airlines, which on Tuesday announced it was
grounding its last 46 daily flights and laying off its remaining
1,800 employees.
   Air Midwest provided connector flights to Braniff's hub in Kansas
City, and about half of its revenue was from ties with Braniff.
   Priddy said Air Midwest is trying to sell seven SAAB 340 aircraft
that became surplus planes when the Braniff feeder flights ended.
   Air Midwest laid off 165 workers on Oct. 5, on the heels of a
30-worker layoff earlier that week. The cuts were intended to save
about $200,000 a month. The airline has not laid off any more
employees since then.
   During the second quarter of this year, the latest period for
which figures were available, Air Midwest earned $1.6 million,
nearly four times the earnings for the same quarter in 1988.
   Mesa has 16 airplanes serving 25 cities in New Mexico, Colorado,
Wyoming, Arizona and Texas.
   Mesa's subsidiary, Skyway Airlines of Milwaukee, has six
airplanes serving 15 cities in Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and
Wisconsin. Mesa acquired Skyway in April.
   Risley said Mesa does not own any Air Midwest stock. Priddy owns
more than 13 percent of the airline's stock, or about 509,000 shares.
   Mesa on Aug. 4 reported net income of $101,546, or 6 cents a
share, on revenue of more than $5.8 million for its third fiscal
quarter that ended June 30.
   The company reported net income of $3,492 on revenue of more than
$4 million for the same period that ended June 30, 1988.
   Mesa last month rejected a merger proposed by a smaller carrier,
Stateswest Airlines in Phoenix, which serves communities in Arizona,
Southern California and Nevada.
   Risley said he could not comment on whether Mesa was looking to
acquire other specific airlines, but said the company is ``always
looking for good investment opportunities that would allow us to
expand beyond what we have now.''

   Collective bargaining agreements covering 3
million workers will expire or be subject to renegotiation in 1990,
including 2.1 million workers in private industry, the Labor
Department said Wednesday.
   The department's forecast of 1990 bargaining activity said the
upcoming negotiations would involve 884,000 of the 2.5 million
workers under major contract agreements in state and local
governments.
   The 2.1 million private-industry workers whose contracts are up
for bargaining in 1990 represent 35 percent of the 6 million workers
in that sector covered by major collective bargaining agreements.
   The Labor Department defines major agreements as those covering
at least 1,000 workers.
   In private industry, the largest groups affected by the
negotiations will be construction workers, with contracts covering
409,000 up for bargaining, and in transportation equipment, with
595,000 workers affected, most of them at automobile manufacturers.

   Ted Turner is getting into the book business.
   Turner announced Wednesday that Turner Broadcasting System Inc.
is creating a new division, Turner Publishing Inc., that will
develop book publishing possibilities related to the parent
company's other interests.
   ``Turner Broadcasting's television programming ... has affected
people deeply,'' said Turner, chairman and president of TBS. ``With
the creation of this new division, the company will make its work
available to a still larger audience.''
   The publishing division will be headed by Michael Reagan, a
photographer who has worked on TBS' ``Portrait of America'' and
``Portrait of the World'' series.
   Turner Publishing's first projects, to be released next year,
will be photo books based on the television programs ``Portrait of
Great Britain'' and ``Season of Giants,'' which was about the
Italian Renaissance period.
   Atlanta-based TBS is the parent company of Cable News Network,
Headline News, SuperStation TBS, Turner Network Television,
baseball's Atlanta Braves and basketball's Atlanta Hawks. TBS also
has a division that makes videotapes from its MGM film library.

<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The newest combo at Carl's Jr. restaurants
features fast food and instant money. With one stop, you can get a
burger, fries and 40 bucks.
   Diners at Carl's Jr. fast food restaurants will soon be able to
pay for their fare with automated teller machine cards, company
officials announced Tuesday.
   Four hundred Carl's in California will be outfitted with ATMs,
said Bob Altman, vice president for management information systems
at Carl Karcher Enterprises headquarters here.
   The network will allow customers to pay for their food and
withdraw up to $40 in cash for a 10-cent service charge.
   ``We think this gives us an advantage by opening the fast food
restaurant to the check-paying public, where they can get one-stop
convenience by buying a meal and withdrawing up to $40 in cash,''
Altman said.
   The machines will accept bank cards from Wells Fargo, Bank of
America, Security Pacific and First Interstate. Company officials
believe the cards will be used by about 5 percent to 7 percent of
their customers.
   Janet Lowder, a restaurant analyst with Laventhol &amp; Horwath in
Los Angeles, said the ATM system could put Carl's Jr. at a
competitive advantage by generating greater sales.
   ``If you don't have to pay with cash, chances are that you will
buy more food,'' Ms. Lowder said.
   The ATMs were test-marketed for two years in San Diego, San
Francisco and Sacramento.
   Steven Rockwell, an analyst with Alex. Brown &amp; Sons investment
banking firm in Baltimore, Md., said he did not expect the cost of
implementing the system to cause the company any financial loss.
   Company officials said they hope to expand the system to all
their restaurants in the western states by the end of next year.
   McDonald's, Arby's, Domino's Pizza and Wendy's International are
testing their own ATM systems, but have yet to implement the
programs company-wide.

   The Senate headed today toward a final vote on
a compromise plan to raise the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour, which
some Republicans claimed would hurt the economy and cost young
workers their jobs.
   ``There is unanimous agreement, except among politicians, that
this is not the thing to do,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C, citing
studies that a higher minimum wage likely would fuel inflation and
make marginal businesses less likely to hire new workers. ``So what
do politicians do? They go ahead and do it.''
   The opposition of Helms and other Republicans notwithstanding,
the compromise plan agreed to by President Bush and congressional
Democrats was expcted to win final passage by day's end.
   The vote originally was planned for Tuesday but negotiations on a
plan to raise the federal debt limit stalled the minimum-wage
debate. That logjam was broken late Tuesday and the minimum-wage
bill was the first order of Senate business today.
   Several GOP senators were mulling amendments, despite an attempt
by the Bush administration to persuade them not to offer any. If
offered, none was expected to pass but debate on them would delay a
final vote, still expected later today.
   The compromise, passed by the House last week, would raise the
wage floor for the first time since it reached $3.35 an hour in 1981.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, in a letter Tuesday, reminded
senators the administration supported the compromise approved by the
House and ``accordingly I ask for your support of this same bill now
before the Senate with no amendments attached.''
   Aides to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he planned to offer an
amendment to exempt small businesses from the increase in the
minimum wage. Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., said today he also might
offer an amendment but did not offer details.
   The minimum wage, paid to an estimated 4 million Americans, would
rise to $3.80 next April 1 and to $4.25 a year later under the
legislation.
   It also would create a subminimum for workers 16 to 19 years old
new to the job market. All workers in that age group could be paid
the subminimum for their first three months of work experience and
up to six months provided they were in certified training programs
for the final three months.
   The subminimum would be $3.35 when the minimum wage rose to
$3.80. It would rise to $3.61 when the minimum wage rose to $4.25.
The provision allowing the subminimum expires in 1993.

   Grain and soybean futures were mixed in sluggish
trading Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Corn futures closed within a one cent range as traders settled
back to wait for the release Thursday of the U.S. Agriculture
Department's crop production report. The report is expected to
contain an upward revision in this year's corn production.
   News that South Korea entered the market Tuesday night for about
200,000 metric tons of corn did not provide a stimulous to the
market, said Dale Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. in Chicago.
   Soybean futures prices were little changed from Tuesday's close,
with the buildup of soybean stocks putting pressure on prices.
   Thursday's USDA crop report is expected to show an increase in
U.S. soybean production, which also weighed on prices.
   Wheat prices were stable despite the failure of the Soviet Union
and China to show up in the market as has been expected, Gustafson
said.
   At the close, wheat was 1} cents lower to 1} cents higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.04 a bushel; corn was a

<HEAD>Net Farm Income To Fall, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARROLL, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. net farm income will decline steadily
through 1996 from its current record heights, researchers said
Wednesday.
   The projections include forecasts of falling government
subsidies, declining soybean prices and generally stable prices for
cattle, hogs and corn.
   The Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute predicted a
27 percent drop in net farm income by 1996, but said that still
would leave the income figure higher than in any year before 1986.
When adjusted for inflation, however, the drop is steeper.
   Net farm income represents agriculture's contribution to the
gross national product. It measures the return to farmers for their
labor and management of farms and households.
   The projections were released at the institute's fall
agribusiness outlook and policy conference in this west-central Iowa
farm community. The institute is a joint program of the Center for
Agricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State University and the
Center for National Food and Agricultural Policy at the University
of Missouri.
   Patrick Westhoff, a research associate at Iowa State center, said
the forecast is designed as a reference point for policy makers as
they prepare a new federal farm program for 1990, when the 1985 law
expires.
   One basic assumption is that current domestic and foreign
agricultural policies are continued. The impact of any policy
changes then could be measured against the projections, Westhoff
told the conference.
   The institute predicts:
   _Net farm income will rise to approximately $49.2 billion this
year from $45.7 billion last year, then fall to about $36 billion by
1996. After adjusting for inflation by measuring net farm income in
terms of the buying power of the dollar in 1967, the forecast
projects a 43 percent slide, from $14.6 billion in 1989 to $8.4
billion in 1996.
   _Government payments to farmers will fall from an estimated $10.5
billion in 1989 to almost $5.8 billion in 1996.
   _Cash receipts from sales of crops and livestock will rise 16
percent, to $180.4 billion from $155.6 billion. Production expenses
will rise 24 percent, to $170.4 billion from $137.4 billion.
   _Corn prices will average $2.18 per bushel in the marketing year
that ends next August, and $2.19 per bushel in the year that ends in
August 1996. In the meantime, prices range from $1.99 per bushel in
the 1991-92 marketing year to $2.20 in 1993-94.
   _Soybean prices should average $5.78 per bushel in the current
marketing year and $6.34 in 1995-96, dropping as low as $5.26 in
1990-91.
   _Prices of slaughter steers at Omaha should average $72.33 per
100 pounds this year, rising to $79.32 in 1996, with a low of $69.48
in 1995.
   _Prices of butcher hogs should average $42.30 per 100 pounds this
year and rise to $45.40 in 1996, with a low of $40.74 in 1992 and a
high of $45.95 in 1994.

<HEAD>Short Supplies Forcing Milk Prices to Record Levels This Fall</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Drought, dropping production and changes in
consumer tastes are forcing Americans to pay more for milk at the
supermarket and creating shortages for some dairy processors.
   The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that retail milk
prices in the United States averaged $1.27 per half gallon in
October, the highest level this decade.
   Prices for milk, cheese and other dairy products have been
increasing this fall at a pace 50 percent faster than the overall
Consumer Price Index during that time, the bureau said.
   Jim Miller, an agricultural economist with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture in Washington, said retail milk prices probably would
continue to increase through the end of this year, although
consumers may see lower prices in the spring.
   In parts of New York City, the New York state Department of
Agricultural and Markets reported that milk now costs as much as
$2.55 a gallon. Richard Kessel, executive director of the state's
Consumer Protection Board, has warned that the increases might make
milk too expensive for lower-income families.
   ``It's becoming a very expensive commodity,'' said Kessel. ``I
think that when you recognize the fact that milk is probably the
most important staple for any American family, you see the rising
prices of milk at the retail level is very disturbing.''
   Dairy industry experts say American consumers still are paying
for the drought of 1988, which scorched farmland in parts of the
Midwest, South and the Northeast. The quality of feed grown during
that summer was inferior to previous crops and the milk production
of cows feeding on those grains has been below average.
   According to the USDA, American farmers produced 1 percent less
milk in August than they did in August 1988. In September, milk
production was off 2 percent from the same month last year.
   Fewer dairy cows are producing milk in the United States now than
in the mid 1980s. Some 1.6 million head of dairy cattle were taken
out of milk production under the federal buyout program designed to
trim U.S. milk surpluses.
   The production decline has been accentuated by an increase in the
amount of milk being used for making cheese, which reflects
increased consumer demand for that product, according to Earl
Fuller, an agricultural economist at the University of Minnesota.
   Ed Coughlin, director of regulatory affairs for the National Milk
Producers Federation in Arlington, Va., said tight milk supplies
also stemmed partly from commitments by U.S. processors to supply
nonfat dry milk to Mexico and other foreign countries.
   When American milk production unexpectedly began to tail off
midway through this year, some processors had to scramble to get
enough milk to produce as much cheese, nonfat dry milk, butter, ice
cream and other domestic dairy products, Coughlin said.
   Plants that might be operating normally at 90 percent to 95
percent of capacity might have to operate at 75 percent if they were
unable to buy as much milk as they wanted, he said.
   ``Is that a shortage? I don't really see that as a shortage of
milk,'' he said.
   Coughlin said about half the milk produced in the United States
is sold fresh in stores. There will be enough milk meet that demand
for the next several months, he said, until the traditional spring
production surplus wipes out any short supplies.
   The USDA predicts prices will plunge dramatically by spring, when
milk prices traditionally reach their lows of the year due to peak
supply and slack demand.
   Robert Cropp, a farm economist at the University of
Wisconsin-Platteville, projects that the upward price trend will
last until about mid-February, when a decline will start as the
traditional spring milk ``flush'' approaches.
   The beneficiaries of the recent price increases are the American
dairy farmers who've struggled to make money for most of this decade
while milk prices have been stable _ or even dropped _ and
production costs have increased.
   The base price for milk produced in the United States, determined
by processors in the leading milk-producing states of Minnesota and
Wisconsin, has increased from $10.98 per hundred pounds in March to
$13.87 per hundred pounds in October. That price is boosted further
by regional premiums added by federal milk-price regulating boards
around the country.
   The Minnesota-Wisconsin price in October was $1.99 per hundred
pounds higher than the base milk price in October 1988.

<HEAD>Walter Industries Refinancing Bonds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parent company of Walter Industries Inc.
wants to refinance $624.3 million in debt before Jan. 1, when
interest rates on the junk bonds are scheduled to be reset.
   The move, announced Tuesday by Hillsborough Holding Corp., is
designed to buy time for the construction and building-supplies
company.
   If the holding company fails to restructure the debt before Jan.
1, when the interest rates are reset some bondholders are likely to
demand high yields that could saddle Walter Industries with
interest costs it can't afford.
   Hillsborough announced a plan to ask its junk bondholders to
swap existing bonds for a package of new bonds and varying amounts
of cash. The new bonds would carry a slightly higher interest rate
of around 18 percent and be accompanied by cash payments of $3 or
$5.
   Interest rates on those bonds also would be subject to future
adjustment _ but not until Nov. 1, 1990, giving the company 10 more
months of breathing room.
   Bondholders have until Dec. 5 to exchange their holdings. The
plan is contingent on the willingness of 80 percent of junk
bondholders to swap.
   ``What it comes down to is we're faced with interest rates we
don't think the bonds deserve,'' said David L. Townsend, spokesman
for Tampa-based Walter Industries Inc. ``This is compounded by the
fact that the market is volatile.''
   Hillsborough said its refinancing package ``would better
insulate the company from possible distortions in its capital
structure that could be caused by current market conditions.'' The
company added that its operations are ``presently strong and
performing according to plan.''
   The bonds are part of a $1.1 billion junk-bond financing package
used last year to take Walter Industries, formerly Jim Walter
Corp., private in a leveraged buyout.
   The acquisition of the publicly held company was orchestrated by
the New York investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co, and the
bond financing was managed by the investment firm Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   The prices of junk bonds are depressed, a result of turmoil
caused by defaults and near-defaults by some companies that issued
junk bonds.
   Hillsborough's bond prices also are low because of renewed
concern about its asbestos liability stemming from a lawsuit filed
earlier this year.
   A Hillsborough junk bond that was sold last year with a face
value of $100 was priced at the end of last month about $55.
   Meeting the Jan. 1 bond value would force the company to pay an
interest rate of more than 40 percent, said King Penniman, managing
director of McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei Inc., a New York junk bond
investment adviser. ``There's no way they can reset these.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives of the Machinists union and Condor
Partners met Wednesday amid reports the UAL Corp. board of directors
has given its chairman permission to explore the possibility of a
buyout or recapitalization of United Airlines' parent.
   The meeting in Washington, D.C., was held only to hear what
Condor is planning for UAL, said spokesman Jim Conley of the
Machinists, United's largest union representing 25,000 of its 70,000
workers.
   He said the union was not seeking to reach any immediate
agreements with Condor, which was formed by Coniston Partners, a New
York investment group that announced last week it had accumulated a
9.7 percent stake in Chicago-based UAL.
   Coniston principal Augustus Oliver refused to elaborate on the
substance of Wednesday's meeting with the Machinists, whose
opposition contributed to the October collapse of a pilot-management
buyout proposal.
   Condor was established to solicit majority support from UAL
shareholders for Coniston's effort to reduce UAL's board from 16
members to five, three of whom would be Coniston principals.
   With control of the board, Coniston could direct UAL toward a
sale, restructuring or recapitalization. In 1987, Coniston _ then
the majority shareholder _ helped force a restructuring of United's
parent, then called Allegis Corp.
   Meanwhile Wednesday, published reports indicated that the UAL
board had cleared Chairman Stephen Wolf to explore new means of
mounting a buyout or recapitalization of the company.
   UAL spokeswoman Sara Dornacker declined to comment.
   Oliver said he was familiar with the reports, but had no comment.
   ``In any event, there has been no change in our plans'' to gain
control of UAL, he said from New York. ``We've been talking to all
interested parties and will continue to do so.''
   The reports concerning Wolf were confirmed by Hank Krakowski of
the Air Line Pilots Association, which spearheaded the failed
pilot-management bid for UAL. He declined to elaborate.
   But Krakowski said United's pilots are ``continuing to explore
any and all options in its effort to gain employee control of the
airline.''
   The pilots union has held talks with management, he said.
   ``All I can say is the pilots are seeking employee ownership with
the current management team,'' but would not exclude an effort with
other parties, Krakowski said.
   Robert J. Joedicke, an airline analyst with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in New York, said the UAL board's action regarding Wolf
was not surprising or new.
   He noted the board had issued a vague statement last month
suggesting Wolf get on with managing the company and indicating it
would not consider any offer under $300 a share _ the per-share
price of the failed $6.75 billion bid.
   Joedicke said he believes UAL management has been pursuing
another buyout offer or recapitalization since the announcement last
month that the pilot-management group was unable to secure financing.
   ``I suspect that it (another buyout bid) has been progressing all
along and has moved from Act One to Act Two,'' he said.
   The announcement of the collapse of the pilot-management deal on
Oct. 13 helped trigger a 190-point drop in the Dow Jones average of
30 industrials.
   Conley said the Machinists' meeting with Condor principals was
part of a union effort to discover some way to put United back on
stable ground and end the bidding war, which the union contends
would lead to overwhelming debt for the nation's second-largest
carrier.
   He said the Machinists would not participate in any deal that
would give the pilots control of the airline, but had not ruled out
a compromise on the magnitude of employee ownership.

<HEAD>Kansas City Wants Late Gate Fees from Braniff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City officials said Wednesday that if
Braniff Inc. doesn't pay $1.8 million in overdue airport rental and
gate fees by Nov. 28 it risks losing its gates at Kansas City
International Airport.
   Kansas City will file a motion in federal bankruptcy court next
week demanding the payment and will resist any effort by Braniff to
extend the deadline, said Assistant City Attorney Nordahl Holte.
   The City Council's Aviation Committee expressed concern that the
airport gates would be unused for a long time as Braniff moves
through bankruptcy court.
   Airline officials were unavailable for comment.
   Braniff filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection from
creditors on Sept. 28. The Orlando, Fla.-based airline canceled its
remaining flights at midnight Monday due to a severe cash shortage
and said it would dismiss most of its remaining 1,800 employees.
   Under federal bankruptcy law, Braniff has 60 days from its Sept.
28 filing to decide whether to pay the airport fees, give up the
gates or seek an extension.
   If Braniff does not pay, a lender that loaned Braniff money
before bankruptcy would have the option of taking over the leases.
If the lender declines to pay the bills by Dec. 28, the city would
be free to offer the gate space to other airlines.
   Seprately, the head of a concern that planned to acquire the
airline said those plans had changed since Braniff's virtual
shutdown.
   Farhad Azima, head of Kansas City-based Aviatin Leasing Group,
said he still would consider using some of Braniff's assets to
operate a passenger airline service, focused principally on Kansas
City. But hopes of renewing service through Braniff have ended, he
said.
   ``Based on the present situation, we have to look at it in a
different view than as a going concern,'' he said. ``Our plan (to
revive Braniff) is no longer applicable. We will look at its assets
but no longer look at it as a going concern.''
   The airline's decision to stop air service makes restarting it
too difficult, he said.
   Azima plans to meet with his investment bankers in New York next
week to decide whether to become involved in Braniff's bankruptcy
reorganization.

   The stock market ran up a broad gain Wednesday,
extending Tuesday's rally on signs of a new move toward a more
stimulative Federal Reserve credit policy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 14.96 on Tuesday,
climbed 26.23 points to 2,623.36.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 5 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,091 up, 418 down and 463 unchanged.
   Stocks turned upward Tuesday on evidence that the Federal Reserve
was taking steps in the money markets to encourage interest rates to
decline. News accounts this morning quoted unnamed government
officials as saying that inference was correct.
   Analysts said that encouraged stock traders who had been growing
increasingly apprehensive about the possibility of a recession.
   Wall Streeters still expect corporate profits, which came in
below expectations for the third quarter, to be disappointing for
the next few months.
   But the Fed could presumably cushion the impact of an economic
slowdown in the future by relaxing its credit policy now.
   A relatively small St. Louis bank lowered its prime lending rate
from 10{ percent to 10 percent, helping to stir expectations that
bigger money-center banks might soon do the same.
   Bank stocks were notably strong. J.P. Morgan rose 1~ to 43{;
Bankamerica 1\ to 28|; Manufacturers Hanover 1\ to 37, and Chemical
Banking 1 to 32[.
   Gainers among the blue-chip industrials included Philip Morris,
up } at 41|; General Electric, up 1 at 54{; Procter &amp; Gamble, up 2|
at 129[; Coca-Cola, up 2\ at 74{, and American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, up } at 44\.
   But International Business Machines dropped | to 96} and Digital
Equipment was down 1{ at 87.
   Woolworth dropped 1[ to 58\ amid some disappointment over the
size of the quarterly earnings gain posted by the company.
   Wyse Technology led the active list, down [ at 9]. The stock
traded as high as 12{ early in the session amid takeover rumors.
   Then it fell back when the company said it was discussing a
possible acquisition at $10 a share with a party it didn't identify.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 170.15 million
shares, against 163 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 202.37 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $30.38 billion, or 0.93
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
1.74 to 187.48.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 3.75 to 385.14, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up 3.34 at 338.15.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
4.65 to 454.05. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 370.72, up 2.21.

   Weakness in the heating oil market led petroleum
futures prices lower Wednesday in moderate trading.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December contract for
heating oil fell 1.11 cents to 58.72 cents a gallon, while the
January contract slid 0.90 cent to 58.69 cents a gallon.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline also declined. The December contract
lost 0.54 cent to 51.87 cents a gallon and January fell 0.49 cent to
52.29 cents a gallon.
   The December contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 15 cents to $19.87 a barrel. January
crude moved down 11 cents to $19.68.
   Analysts said softness in the heating oil market stemmed
forecasts for warmer weather and from weekly statistics from the
American Petroleum Institute that showed supplies rose 1.9 million
barrels last week to 120.6 million barrels.
   Although crude oil inventories fell by 3.9 million barrels
overall to 341 million barrels, in some crucial production areas
they increased.
   ``If you digest the numbers, you'll find there was some buildup
of crude in two main areas, including Oklahoma the Gulf Coast,''
said Richard Kane, ab energy trader with Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures.
   Total gasoline stocks declined by 871,000 barrels to 221.9
million barrels, according to the API report.

<HEAD>Labor Officials Halt UAW-Chrysler Joint Programs Over Plant Closing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor officials have put at least two joint
programs between Chrysler Corp. and the United Auto Workers union
on hold to protest the automaker's planned closing of a carmaking
plant.
   Aaron Taylor, president of UAW Local 7 at Chrysler's Jefferson
Avenue plant in Detroit, said Tuesday the union was stopping its
participation in a quality improvement program and a training
project.
   On Friday, Chrysler announced it would stop production of its
Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon subcompact cars at the aging plant
in February, idling 1,700 workers. The plant was scheduled to be
phased out by 1992 to make way for Chrysler's new Jefferson North
plant.
   Taylor, echoing other UAW officials, said he felt betrayed by
Chrysler's announcement Friday.
   Chrysler officials declined to comment on the UAW's action. The
company has implemented a program to cut $1 billion in costs by the
end of next year.
   Last year, the union threatened to pull out of similar joint
programs to protest Chrysler's proposed sale of its Acustar Inc.
parts-making operation. The company dropped its sale plans.
   The nation's No. 3 automaker said it expected to begin recalling
the Jefferson Avenue plant workers in the fall of 1991 to train
them for work at the Jefferson North plant, which will produce
sport-utility vehicles.

   The dollar rose modestly against most major
currencies Wednesday, showing resilience in the face of expectations
of declining interest rates.
   Gold prices also advanced. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a bid for gold at 4 p.m. EST of $387.50 a troy ounce, up from
$384.75 late Tuesday.
   Currency traders said the dollar showed fundamental strength
despite the market's perception that the Federal Reserve is relaxing
its credit policy, which likely would encourage lower interest
rates. Falling interest rates usually depress the dollar's value.
   That perception was fueled by the Fed's action in the bond market
on Monday and Tuesday, when it unexpectedly injected several billion
dollars of reserves into the market.
   ``The dollar is basically absorbing the lower interest-rate
scenario rather well,'' said Robert Hatcher, a vice president of
corporate trading at the New York office of Barclays Bank PLC.
``It's hanging in there.''
   He noted that traders are looking toward Thursday's government
report on wholesale price inflation in October for further signs of
an economic slowdown, which could spur the Fed to ease credit
further.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell to a closing 142.97 Japanese yen from 143.63 yen at
Tuesday's close. Later, in London, it declined further to 142.73
yen. But in trading in New York, the dollar recovered and finished
at 143.18 yen, up from 142.95 yen late Tuesday.
   The British pound rose in London to $1.5860 from $1.5810 late
Tuesday. Later, in New York, the pound fetched $1.5885, up from
$1.5865 the day before.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.8445 West German marks, up from 1.8430; 1.6168
Swiss francs, up from 1.6165; 6.2515 French francs, up from 6.2470;
1,347.25 Italian lire, down from 1,348.00; and 1.1698 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1712.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.8450 West German marks, up from 1.8442; 1.6170
Swiss francs, down from 1.6175; 6.2510 French francs, down from
6.2520; 2.0805 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0820; 1,349.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,349.00; and, 1.1695 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1705.
   Gold bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $384.75 a troy
ounce, up from $384.50 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, Switzerland, the
metal was unchanged from Tuesday, closing at a bid of $384.00.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $6.23 to close at $387.80.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold contracts for current
delivery closed at $388.80 a troy ounce, up from $386.20 on Tuesday.
   Silver bullion in London slipped to a late bid price of $5.25 a

   The Senate gave final passage Wednesday to
legislation to raise the hourly minimum wage to $4.25 by April 1991,
the first increase in the floor wage since 1981. President Bush is
expected to sign the bill next week.
   The 89-8 Senate vote came eight days after Bush and congressional
Democrats agreed on the plan to boost the minimum wage by 45 cents
next April 1 and another 45 cents a year later.
   The measure, passed overwhelmingly by the House last week, also
creates a new, subminimum wage that could be paid to teen-agers for
their first three months in the work force and up to three months
more for those in certified training or education programs.
   Bush's signature will not only trigger the first increase in the
minimum wage in nearly a decade but also will end a bitter stalemate
between congressional Democrats and successive Republican
administrations over the politically charged issue.
   ``The nine-year logjam on the minimum wage is finally broken,''
said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., a key architect of the
compromise. ``The working poor are about to receive an increase,
although it is not as much as they deserve.''
   Kennedy promised to return to the issue and seek another increase
as the 1992 presidential election nears. Democrats may try to use
the issue against Bush then, but on Wednesday they had praise for
the president.
   ``We all owe a debt of gratitude to the president of the United
States, who was willing to stand up and support a minimum wage
increase, thereby reversing the policy of the prior administration,
which had consistently opposed any increase,'' said Majority Leader
George Mitchell of Maine.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, one of two Republicans who
unsuccessfully sought to amend the measure, credited Democrats and
Kennedy with a victory over the White House in the compromise talks.
   ``He's won with the president,'' Hatch said of Kennedy. ``He got
the president to come his way.''
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said the labor federation was
``delighted that the compromise bill to raise the minimum wage has
cleared the Senate and is on its way to the president's desk.
America's poorest workers have gone nearly a decade without a raise
and this long overdue step will give them a chance to lift
themselves and their families out of poverty.''
   The final vote came afer Hatch and a handful of other
conservative Republicans long opposed to any increase made a
spirited rhetorical effort to derail the compromise by defeating or
amending it.
   ``The fact is that this legislation will not help the people it
says it is supposed to help, those people at the bottom of the
economic ladder,'' said Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho.
   But even the Senate's GOP leaders, citing Bush's deal with the
Democrats, frowned on the amendment efforts.
   ``The president made an agreement,'' Republican Leader Bob Dole
of Kansas said in urging his colleagues not to support amendments.
   The minimum wage, frozen at $3.35 an hour since January 1981, is
paid to about 4 million American workers. But the legislation likely
will have a broader impact by driving up the wages of workers who
now make slightly more than the minimum wage, particularly those
covered by collective bargaining agreements.
   Such wage inflation was a major concern of Republicans and
business interests who opposed any increase in the minimum wage. But
Bush's campaign promise to support one left them hobbled in their
efforts to block a boost, one of organized labor's top priorities
throughout the 1980s.
   Labor, on the other hand, which failed to win an increase during
the eight-year Reagan administration and lost in its first fight
with Bush on the issue, was forced to drop its longstanding
opposition to any subminimum wage.
   Bush in June vetoed a Democratic-backed bill calling for an
increase to $4.55 and, as his veto was sustained, said he would not
budge from his offer of an increase to $4.25 an hour by January 1992
provided employers could pay all newly hired workers a subminimum
for up to six months.
   The White House, under increasing pressure from GOP lawmakers
seeking to avoid another veto battle heading into an election year,
two weeks ago signaled a willingness to strike a deal, and both
sides made concessions leading to the compromise.
   Bush agreed to a timetable reaching the $4.25 level nine months
before he had proposed and also accepted a far more restrictive
training wage than he had demanded. The compromise limits
application of the subminimum to workers 16-19 years old, requires
actual skills training for it to be paid to those with more than
three months work experience and prevents it being paid to any
worker with six months total experience. The provision allowing the
subminimum expires in April 1993.
   Bush wanted a provision allowing the lower wage to be paid to all
workers, regardless of age, for their first six months on any new
job, regardless of past work experience.
   Labor and the Democratic sponsors of the increase, in addition to
accepting the new subminimum, lowered their final target for the
increase _ at one time more than $5 _ to $4.25 an hour. They also
gave up demands for a commission to report annually on whether
additional boosts were needed. Opponents of any increase feared such
a panel would become a lobbying arm for annual confrontations on the
issue.
   All eight senators voting againt the measure were Republicans.
They were Sens. William Armstrong of Colorado, Hatch and Jake Garn
of Utah, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Gordon Humphrey of New
Hampshire, Connie Mack of Florida, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, and
Symms of Idaho.

<HEAD>Boeing Reported Ready To Plead Guilty in Pentagon Case</HEAD>

   Boeing Co. plans to plead guilty next week to
two felony charges of unauthorized conveyance of Pentagon budget
documents, Justice Department sources said Tuesday.
   The Seattle-based aerospace company has agreed to enter the pleas
in connection with obtaining two budget documents, said the sources,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. Boeing's planned plea has been
widely reported over the past week.
   A court document states that Boeing, which was the Pentagon's
10th-largest contractor with $3 billion worth of business last year,
is scheduled to enter a pre-indictment plea Monday in U.S. District
Court in Alexandria, Va.
   According to another court filing, Boeing is an unindicted
co-conspirator of Richard Lee Fowler, a former company marketing
analyst awaiting trial on charges of obtaining more than 100
Pentagon documents between 1979 and 1985.
   Many of the documents Fowler obtained were classified, according
to the indictment.
   Robert S. Bennett, Boeing's Washington attorney, declined to
comment on the case.
   The documents Fowler, who worked as a civilian Air Force employee
before joining Boeing, is accused of giving Boeing include material
on former President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Under the terms of the guilty plea being negotiated with Boeing,
the Pentagon could still take steps to bar the company from future
defense contracts, according to the sources.
   The company has agreed to reimburse the government for the cost
of the investigation.
   Defense Department spokesman Glenn Flood said a decision on
whether to bar Boeing from bidding on future contracts would be made
as part of an administrative proceeding conducted by the Air Force.
   ``It's not an automatic thing,'' he said. But a decision to debar
Boeing would apply to all Pentagon procurement, not just Air Force
contracts, he said.
   Howard W. Cox, deputy assistant inspector general for the Defense
Department, said that if a contractor agrees to take adequate
corrective measures, ``there's a good chance the Air Force will not
take any action.''
   Fowler, 64, of Springfield, Va. is to go on trial Dec. 4 on
charges of conspiracy, conveyance without authority, mail fraud and
conversion of government property. He has declined to comment about
the case.
   He is accused of obtaining detailed budget documents for various
Defense Department programs, including a five-year plan for the
Pentagon. Such material would help a defense company submit bids for
government contracts.
   Prosecutors allege that while the indictment charges Folwer with
obtaining 110 documents for Boeing, he procured more than 600
classified documents for the defense contractor over the six-year
period.
   In doing so, he was able to give Boeing ``a comprehensive picture
of the internal dynamics'' of the Defense Department's planning and
budgeting system, prosecutors say in court documents obtained by The
Morning News Tribune of Tacoma, Wash.
   Court files contain a 1986 interview with Fowler by Boeing
officials as part of an internal inquiry conducted at the direction
of the Defense Department.
   Fowler said in the interview that he received calls from managers
in various Boeing divisions asking him to get the Pentagon planning
and budget documents.
   Asked if he was pressured into obtaining them, Fowler replied,
``No, that's what I was hired to do.''
   In another statement, Fowler said he considered it an accepted
practice throughout the defense industry to acquire such information.
   Fowler was critical of the Pentagon's classification practices,
saying that some papers were overclassified and others were
classified for political rather than security reasons. Sometimes
information would be classified in one document and unclassified in
another, he said.
   ``I never consciously believed that the data extracted from DOD
documents, in spite of the classification, was in fact classified,
nor would the data in any way compromise the security of the
nation,'' he wrote.

<HEAD>U.S., Japan Electronics Groups Form HDTV Cooperation Committees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese electronics industry group has offered to
share information about advanced high-definition television with
U.S. semiconductor makers to allow them to produce components for
Japanese-developed HDTV systems, U.S. industry officials said
Wednesday.
   The Electronic Industry Association of Japan said it ``would
welcome the active participation of foreign-based semiconductor
manufacturers'' in HDTV, the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association
said in a statement.
   HDTV, which uses large numbers of semiconductor chips to produce
images as clear as in movie theaters, is seen by some analysts as a
key element of the consumer electronics industry's future.
   E. David Metz, executive director of the Semiconductor Industry
Association's Japan office, said the two industry groups agreed in
talks Tuesday night to establish committees on HDTV cooperation and
technical exchange.
   He said the committees would ``provide U.S. semiconductor makers
with an opportunity'' to supply chips for Japanese HDTV
manufacturers.
   ``We don't see that there are formal barriers to participation,''
Metz said Wednesday. ``We sense a cooperative attitude.''
   He said the talks were not likely to have an immediate effect on
sales of U.S.-made semiconductors in Japan because HDTV equipment is
still at the prototype stage.
   ``But we hope it will encourage more design activity in Japan''
by U.S. semiconductor makers, he said. More U.S. designs of HDTV
chips for Japanese manufacturers ``should show up in volume business
later,'' he said.
   Wilfred Corrigan, chairman of the semiconductor group, said
Tuesday that Japanese companies and government agencies have stepped
up their efforts in recent months to increase purchases of foreign
semiconductors, but that foreign chips still have only a 11.2
percent share of the Japanese market.
   ``I'm optimistic these new efforts and this new openness is going
to result in a very real increase in market share for American
companies,'' he said.
   The Semiconductor Industry Association says Japan pledged in
semiconductor negotiations in 1986 to boost the share of foreign
chips in the Japanese market to more than 20 percent within five
years, but Japanese officials say the figure was a goal, not a
commitment.

<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to 350 Ford Motor Co. employees will
be laid off at the company's Kentucky Truck plant in January
because of sagging orders for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, the
company said Wednesday.
   Ford spokesman John Emmert said the plant will reduce production
of the vehicles by 20 percent beginning Jan. 15, 1990, resulting in
the layoffs.
   ``There has been an industry decrease in medium- and heavy-duty
truck orders,'' Emmert said. ``We feel it will continue for the
rest of this year and into 1990.''
   The plant near Louisville employs about 2,000 hourly and 445
salaried workers, Emmert said. It produces 256 vehicles a day, but
that will drop to about 200 daily in mid-January.
   The layoffs will be for an indefinite period, Emmert said.

   The debate over whether computerized program
trading is good or bad for the stock market moves to Washington
Thursday with former Treasury Secretary Donald Regan and other Wall
Street heavy hitters testifying before a House panel.
   The chairman of the House subcommittee that will hear Regan plans
to introduce legislation to restrict program trading during market
drops.
   But a Senate leader said Wednesday that there won't be enough
time to shoehorn a program trading ban into pending legislation
before Congress adjourns for the holidays.
   Program trading _ rapid-fire transactions through computerized
buy and sell programs _ has been a topic of dispute for years but
the debate heated up again after the Oct. 13 stock market slide.
   When the Dow Jones 30-stock industrial average dropped more than
190 points on that Friday the 13th, many critics said the situation
was worsened by program trading, especially one form _ index
arbitrage _ in which speculators try to take advantage of
inconsistencies between the stock and futures markets by
simultaneously buying in one while selling in the other.
   Critics believe the computerized trading strategy also creates
wild price swings, and that, in turn, has driven small investors out
of the market.
   The New York Stock Exchange has called on large, institutional
investors to curb program trading while it considers ways to handle
the bursts of stock orders it generates.
   Regan, a former head of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., has likened program
trading to casino gambling and told a Senate committee last year
that index arbitrage was to blame for the 1987 stock market crash.
   He is expected to express a similar view Thursday to a
subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., the subcommittee chairman, said
he called the session ``to hear from those who have firsthand
experience with the destructive impacts of such program trading
strategies.''
   In addition to Regan, other witnesses scheduled to appear before
the subcommittee on telecommunications and finance include: William
J. O'Neil, chairman of the financial newspaper, Investor's Daily; W.
James Tozer, president of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.; Philip
J. Purcell, chairman of Dean Witter Financial Services Inc., and
Stephen B. Timbers, chief investment officer of Kemper Financial
Services Inc.
   Markey is introducing an amendment to pending market reform
legislation that would halt program trading in times of extreme
market turbulence.
   ``There has been an unprecedented outcry over program trading by
the nation's investment community in the days since the Oct. 13
market collapse,'' said Markey, chairman of the telecommunications
and finance subcommittee.
   But at the Senate Banking Committee, Sen. Christopher J. Dodd,
D-Conn., chairman of the securities subcommittee, said he didn't
think there was enough time to add a program trading ban and still
get the legislation passed before Congress adjourns.
   ``I could not get the bill out with program trading,'' Dodd told
a press briefing Wednesday. ``There are just too many members of the
committee who have strong reservations about the program trading
piece.''
   Dodd added: ``It's important that this Congress not let time go
by without expressing its view'' on market reforms.
   Markey's amendment would grant emergency powers to the Securities
and Exchange Commission to temporarilly halt program trading during
wide market price swings.
   The amendment would be added to the Stock Market Reform Act of
1989, which is pending before the subcommittee. That bill calls for
four major reforms: giving the SEC authority to halt trading in
market emergencies; requiring reports of large securities and
options trades; and rules for assessing the financial stability of
the parent companies of broker-dealers.
   A similar bill is pending in the Senate.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Drop With Release of Inventory Figures</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices slid Wednesday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as traders shrugged off news that petroleum stocks in the
United States declined.
   On other markets, grain and soybeans and precious metals were
mixed, copper declined slightly and livestock and pork futures
mostly higher.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 15 cents
lower with the contract for delivery in December at $19.87 a barrel;
heating oil was .16 cent to 1.13 cents lower with December at 58.70
cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .49 cent to .54 cent lower
with December at 51.87 cents a gallon.
   The selling was spurred by bearish inventory data from the
American Petroleum Institute which showed a 3.98-million-barrel draw
on crude stocks to 341 million barrels.
   ``Most of the stock drawdown occurred on the West Coast, while
stocks actually increased in the Midwest and Gulf regions,'' said
Jerry Samuels, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New
York.
   Adding to selloff pressure was the weakness in heating oil, which
in recent weeks has provided a steadying force in the market. The
weakness in heating oil was due to a increase in stocks, Samuels
said.
   Copper futures prices were higher on New York's Commodity
Exchange as uncertainty continues around labor activity at Chile's
Chuquicamata mine, the world's largest open-pit mine.
   Miners have threatened a strike vote if the government passed a
law reorganizing state-owned Chile Copper Corp., which operates the
mine. The reorganization could lessen the influence of the unions,
analysts say.
   Copper was 1.50 cents to 3.90 cents higher with November at
$1.1545 a pound.
   Precious metal prices settled mixed on the Comex.
   Gold prices were up because of strong overseas demand, said
Stephen W. Platt, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago. Prices were also supported by an expected decline in key
interest rates.
   Silver trading was restrained on reports of high stocks in
Comex-approved warehouses, Platt said.
   Gold was $2.40 to $2.80 higher with November at $388.80 a troy
ounce; silver was 0.1 cent lower to unchanged with November at
$5.265 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures were mixed in sluggish trading on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Corn futures closed within a one-cent range as traders settled
back to wait for the release Thursday of the U.S. Agriculture
Department's crop production report. The report is expected to
contain an upward revision in this year's corn production.
   News that South Korea entered the market Tuesday night for about
200,000 metric tons of corn did not provide a stimulus to the
market, said Dale Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. in Chicago.
   Soybean futures prices were little changed from Tuesday, with the
buildup of soybean stocks putting pressure on prices.
   Thursday's USDA crop report is expected to show an increase in
U.S. soybean production, which also weighed on prices.
   Wheat prices were stable despite the failure of the Soviet Union
and China to show up in the market as has been expected, Gustafson
said.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents lower to 1} cents higher with the contract
for delivery in December at $4.03} a bushel; corn was a { cent lower
to unchanged with December at $2.38 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1\
cents lower with December at $1.42\ a bushel; soybeans were 1\ cents
lower to 2{ cents higher with November at $5.63 a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures closed mixed in light trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were slightly higher because of a strong cash market,
but price strength was limited by lower wholesale beef prices.
   Feeder cattle also were higher because of the reduction of the
U.S. tariff on imported feeder cattle from Mexico.
   Hog futures were lower on a weaker cash market, and bellies were
higher because of the lighter than expected movement of bellies into
storage.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .25 cent higher with December at
74.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent to .25 cent higher
with November at 83.12 a pound; hogs were .52 cent lower to .13 cent
higher with December at 47.80 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .80 cent to 1.92 cents higher with February at 63.47 cents a
pound.

<HEAD>Georgia-Pacific Gets ICC Clearance to Include Railroads in Takeover
Bid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia-Pacific Corp. said Wednesday it had
received government clearance to include four railroads controlled
by Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. in its bid to acquire the
Connecticut-based paper products company.
   Georgia-Pacific spokeswoman Gail Smith said such a clearance by
the Interstate Commerce Commission is required when the holder of a
railroad seeks to acquire another.
   Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific now controls four ``short line''
railroads, used primarily to transport products and raw materials
to and from company facilities. She said Great Northern, based in
Norwalk, Conn., also controls four rail lines.
   ``This is part of the process,'' Ms. Smith said. ``Both
Georgia-Pacific and Great Northern control railroads, and this is a
clearance necessary for approval to acquire Great Northern's
railroads.''
   Georgia-Pacific, one of the largest producers of forest
products, last month offered to acquire Great Northern in a
transaction valued at $3.13 billion, or $58 a share for each of
Great Northern's approximately 54 million shares of outstanding
stock.
   Great Northern is expected to respond next week to the tender
offer, which expires at midnight EST Nov. 29.
   Officials at Great Northern declined to comment on the ICC
decision. Stephen Hill, Great Northern's director of investor
relations, also declined to comment on his company's continued
consideration of the Georgia-Pacific offer.
   ``We have to issue a formal response next week, and we will,''
Hill said.
   Ms. Smith said Georgia-Pacific operates a railroad in
California, two in Arkansas and one between Louisiana and
Mississippi.
   Great Northern has two railroads in Georgia, one in Mississippi
and one in Wisconsin.

week before regular service starts on the luxurious
American-European Express.
   The train carrying lawyers, business leaders, travel agents and
reporters on the overnight run was to be greeted Thursday morning
by a jazz band and welcoming speeches in Chicago's Union Station.
   The cars, hooked to a regular Amtrak train, will make the run
six nights a week. One-way fares range from $695 for a single cabin
to $1,450 for the ``presidential'' cabin. All fares include
sleeping accommodations.
   Regular one-way Amtrak fares between Washington and Chicago
range from $103 to $356.
   The train features a grand piano, gourmet meals and service
patterned after luxury trains in Europe. The 1930s cars have
leather and mahogany interiors trimmed with brass and 24 karat
gold. Services include a fax machine and telephone.
   Each run can carry 56 passengers and a crew of 13 to serve them.

<HEAD>Comptroller Wants Thrift's Art Collection Sold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida's top banking regulator tried
again Wednesday to push a Miami savings and loan into selling its
$28 million art collection, which includes a $13.2 million Rubens
portrait.
   State Comptroller Gerald Lewis filed a 14-page administrative
complaint against CenTrust Savings Bank and its chairman, David L.
Paul, to turn over the collection to a qualified art expert
approved by Lewis' office.
   Lewis contends the art purchases were an unauthorized investment
for a savings and loan, and in particular one that has lost
millions of dollars in recent months.
   ``We're taking this action to expedite the sale of the
collection,'' Lewis said in a statement from his office. ``By
seeking an art expert, it is our intention to see that the
institution gets the best possible price for these works.''
   The collection, which consists of at least 25 pieces, includes
``Portrait of a Man in Armor as Mars,'' a work by 17th Century
Dutch painter Rubens which was bought by CenTrust for $13.2
million, according to the complaint.
   Telephone calls to Centrust late Wednesday were unanswered.
   The comptroller's action comes seven months after he ordered
CenTrust to sell the art. In an April 7 letter, Lewis gave the
thrift six months to sell the artworks, but Lewis' office says only
three pieces have been sold.
   In the new complaint, Lewis claimed CenTrust's purchase was an
``unsafe or unsound'' business practice because of the speculative
nature of art.
   ``Respondents' purchase of the art collection constitutes
practices and conduct contrary to generally accepted standards
applicable to a savings association, especially for an insured
financial institution that lost more than $29 million during the
last 15 months,'' the complaint said.
   The thrift was given 21 days to challenge Lewis' proposed order.
If challenged, the matter would be heard by an administrative law
judge, said Lewis spokesman Terence McElroy.
   If CenTrust does not contest the complaint, a final order would
be issued by Lewis' office giving the thrift 10 days to turn over
the art, he said.

   Texas Air Corp., the nation's largest airline company, reported
Wednesday a net loss of $158 million in the third quarter, as its
Eastern Airlines subsidiary continued to lose money. Pan Am Corp.
said its net income dropped to $458,000 from $67.4 million a year
earlier as passenger traffic continued to decline on its North
Atlantic routes.
   Houston-based Texas Air, parent of both Eastern and Continental
Airlines, again saw profits at Continental offset by losses at
Eastern, which has been in bankruptcy reorganization since it was
struck by its three unions on March 4.
   Texas Air said it lost $158 million, or $4.09 a share, in the
three months ended Sept. 30, widened from a net loss of $114.1
million, or $3.05 a share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue fell to $1.67 billion from $2.19 billion.
   For the first nine months of the year, Texas Air had a net loss
of $522.8 million, or $13.51 a share, widened from a loss of $494.3
million, or $13.06 a share, in the same period of 1988.
   Nine-month revenue tumbled to $4.96 billion from $6.55 billion.
   Miami-based Eastern recorded a third-quarter net loss of $185.2
million, widened from a loss of $112.9 million in the same quarter
of 1988.
   Eastern's revenue for the latest quarter dropped to $305.7
million from $912.7 million.
   ``Eastern continued to successfully rebuild its operations
during the third quarter at a rate well beyond expectations,''
Eastern President Phil Bakes said in a statement. ``While losses
were substantial, they were well within projections, and reflect
the costs of building back our operations.''
   Houston-based Continental, which reported its third-quarter
results on Monday, more than doubled its earnings _ partly because
of the sale of some assets.
   In the quarter, Continental had net income of $43.5 million on
revenue of $1.34 billion, up from net income of $15.2 million on
revenue of $1.26 billion in the same period in 1988.
   In late August, Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo said he was
considering a sale of all or part of Continental because its
business was being hurt by the long-running strike against Eastern.
   Mickey Foret was named president of Continental last week,
replacing Joseph Corr who resigned after less than 10 months on the
job. While remaining as Texas Air chairman, Lorenzo was named
Continental's chairman and chief executive officer, positions which
Corr also held.
   Pan Am, the nation's eighth-largest airline, said its per-share
earnings for the three months ended Sept. 30 fell to less than 1
cent from 47 cents in the third quarter of 1988.
   The latest results include a gain of $18.4 million from
completion of the sale of a division of Pan Am World Services,
which sells security, maintenance and other services to airlines,
government agencies and the military. The subsidiary was purchased
by Johnson Controls Inc. of Milwaukee, Wis.
   Pan Am's third-quarter revenue slipped 1.9 percent to $1.02
billion from $1.04 billion a year earlier.
   The company blamed the decline on continued falling passenger
traffic between the United States and Europe, stemming from the
December 1988 crash in Lockerbie, Scotland, and on increased
competition on flights within West Germany. EuroBerlin, a joint
venture of Lufthansa German Airlines and Air France, started
operating in the country about a year ago.
   The dollar's strength against European currencies during the
period also depressed revenue somewhat, Pan Am said.
   Pan American World Airways, its largest subsidiary, reported a
net loss of $21.9 million in the third quarter, compared with a net
profit of $52.3 million a year earlier.
   ``Results for the third quarter _ our peak season _ were clearly
disappointing,'' said Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett.
``However, we are encouraged by the declining rate of revenue
shortfall and the improving trend of future bookings.''
   For the first nine months of the year, the parent company posted
a net loss of $158.3 million, or $1.09 a share, widened from a net
loss of $21 million, or 15 cents a share, in the same period in
1988.
   Nine-month revenue declined 2.4 percent to $2.66 billion from
$2.73 billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>London Office Rents Highest in Western World, Bank Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   London has the most expensive office rents in the
Western world, outstripping those of New York, Paris and Frankfurt,
the Bank of England said Wednesday.
   Only Tokyo among the major financial centers has higher office
costs than London, the central bank said.
   In terms of living expenses for the families of top executives,
London is cheaper than Japan and in line with New York and major
European cities, it said.
   The findings were published in the bank's quarterly bulletin.
   Tokyo office rents cost $157 a square foot per year, the article
said.
   It put London office rents at $103 a square foot, compared with
$57 in midtown Manhattan and $40 in New York City's downtown.
   Office rents in Paris came to $54 a square foot and in
Frankfurt, $35.
   Living expenses in London, the bank said, are ``not far out of
line with its main European counterparts or New York, (and)
considerably cheaper than Japan. ...''
   Studies of cost of living, staff, overhead, tax and property
have shown that London overall is a cheaper business location than
Brussels, Frankfurt or Paris, the bank said.
   However, it warned that transportation congestion could make
London less appealing as an international financial center.
   ``This congestion is likely to become a serious concern unless
major improvements, currently under examination, can be made in the
foreseeable future,'' it said.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Share Index Falls</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with morning trading, comments.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange erased
early gains and fell back Thursday morning, while the U.S. dollar
rose marginally against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar ended the morning session at 143.02 yen. It higher at
143.33 yen, up 0.36 yen from Wednesday's 142.97-yen close here, but
inched down while ranging from 142.98 to 143.33 yen during morning
trading. In New York, the currency closed at 143.20 yen overnight.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 23.42
points, or 0.07 percent, ending morning trading at 35,572.17. The
index, which gained 325.13 points Wednesday, added 60.17 points
shortly after the opening.
   The index started higher following an overnight gain in the Dow
Jones industrial average of 30 major issues in New York, but
gradually fell back as market players decreased their buying amid
uncertainties over interest rate movement, said an analyst with
Nomura Securities.
   ``Although the Nikkei recovered yesterday following a rumor that
domestic interest rates wouldn't go up further, nothing has changed
in the Japanese economy,'' he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Other dealers said participants sold spot issues in exchange for
arbitrage deals in an attempt to collect profits on the price gap
between spot and future issues. This, they said, prompted the
index's fall.
   In currency dealings, the dollar was moving narrowly due to
uncertainties over U.S. monetary policy after the currency's higher
start, traders said.
   The dollar-yen rate will move tightly but nervously ahead of a
rescheduled auction of U.S. Treasury securities, a dealer from the
Bank of Tokyo said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The U.S. Treasury on Wednesday rescheduled the quarterly auction
of $56 billion in securities after Congress finally approved an
increase in the federal debt limit. Congressional delay forced the
postponement of the auction.

   A judge on Wednesday approved the sale of the
Chicago-to-St. Louis line of Chicago, Missouri and Western Railway
Co., ending fears of a shutdown during the company's bankruptcy
reorganization, its trustee said.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Schwartz made final a tentative
approval he had given last week to the purchase of CM&amp;W's
north-south line for $21.5 million by Rio Grande Industries Inc.,
the parent of Southern Pacific Railroad.
   The sale was endangered, with the threat of a shutdown in
service, late Tuesday when negotiations hit a snag, CM&amp;W trustee
Daniel Murray said.
   The snag occurred when Norfolk Southern Corp., the joint owner
of facilities with CM&amp;W, demanded at least $350,000 from contracts
signed before CM&amp;W declared bankruptcy in April 1988, Murray said.
   But that dispute and several other minor ones were resolved
Wednesday, he said.
   ``The closing is in the process of being completed right now,''
he said late Wednesday afternoon. ``We reached a resolution of the
dispute with Norfolk &amp; Western after negotiations last night and
this morning.''
   Norfolk Southern is the parent of Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Co.
   Murray did not provide details on how the problem was resolved.
   ``There will be continuation of service on the line from Kansas
City to St. Louis,'' he said. ``Southern Pacific will take over the
north-south line. Service will continue uninterrupted.''
   CM&amp;W has 632 miles of track from Kansas City to Joliet, with
trackage rights into Chicago. The purchase affects the 282-mile
line running roughly from St. Louis to Chicago.
   Murray had said Tuesday that if negotiations to resolve the
dispute were not completed before the parties went before Schwartz
on Wednesday, the judge would probably have ordered the entire
railroad shut down at midnight.
   About 100 businesses in Illinois and Missouri would have been
affected by a shutdown. An estimated 300,000 people annually also
travel by Amtrak on CM&amp;W track between Chicago and St. Louis.
   The sale of the north-south line to Rio Grande came during
eleventh-hour negotiations last week. State officials stepped in to
mediate the deal and avert a possible shutdown.
   Citicorp North America Inc. and Heller Financial Inc., CM&amp;W's
chief creditors, had asked the court to cancel the CM&amp;W contract
with Amtrak on the north-south line because they said the railroad
was continuing to lose money on passenger service and had no
prospects for a successful reorganization.
   Murray said those creditors appeared to accept the deal and
voiced no objections in court.
   Rio Grande agreed to pay $1 million in start-up expenses and
assume responsibility for $11 million in loans the state of
Illinois made last year to keep struggling CM&amp;W afloat.
   The state, in turn, agreed to reduce interest rates on the
existing loans and extend their payoff periods, as well as forgive
another $2.5 million loan by changing it to a grant.
   Negotiations continued with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., which seeks
to purchase the CM&amp;W east-west lines that are used to haul freight
between St. Louis and Kansas City.
   The Wertheim cash proposal was expected to go before Schwartz on
Dec. 4, Murray said.
