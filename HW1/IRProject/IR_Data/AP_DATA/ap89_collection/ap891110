<HEAD>Protestors Say New Courthouse Will Decimate Rain Forests</HEAD>

   Hardwood paneling may lend a stately air to a
courtroom, but environmental activists are angry that a new state
courthouse will be decorated with 47,000 square feet of mahogany
from shrinking rain forests.
   ``Our halls of justice should not be decorated through the death
of tropical rain forests,'' Randall Gingrich said as he and other
menbers of the Arizona Rainforest Alliance picketed the site Friday.
   The building on the Capitol mall will house the Supreme Court as
well as most of the Court of Appeals and other court-related
agencies.
   The blueprints call for use of 32,880 square feet of }-inch
plywood and 14,520 square feet of \-inch mahogany plywood,
according to the demonstrators.
   Most mahogany comes from rain forests in Brazil, Malaysia and
Indonesia, and there are estimates that about five acres of rain
forest disappear every minute to meet U.S. demand for tropical
timber. Environmentalists say destruction of the rain forests
threatens the natural balance and is detroying the lives of many
indigenous tribes.
   Chief Justice Frank Gordon Jr. wasn't available Friday, a state
holiday, to comment on the issue, and the vice chief justice,
Stanley Feldman, didn't return calls to his Phoenix and Tucson
homes.
   The demonstrators said the government should send a signal by
using maple, ash, or other hardwoods cut in the United States.
   But Gingrich added, ``I frankly don't think using any kind of
hardwood is going to make a better justice system.''

   A General Motors Corp. executive
and his wife were found shot to death, their bodies dumped in a
park, after their home was ransacked and robbed Friday, police and
FBI agents said.
   Glenn E. and Wanda Tarr's neighbors reported a possible break-in
about 5:30 a.m. Friday. The couple was not there, and police said
it appeared they had had been abducted.
   Their bodies were discovered by a woman walking her dog in a
park in nearby Pontiac later Friday. Each had been shot several
times.
   ``We do not believe they were shot at the home,'' said Hal
Helterhoff, who heads FBI operations in Michigan. ``They were shot
somewhere between the house and the park.''
   Investigators believe Mrs. Tarr may have abducted during an
outing Thursday evening, forced to withdraw cash from the couple's
bank account at a 24-hour teller machine and then taken to her home
by her assailants, Helterhoff said. After the house was ransacked,
the Tarrs were abducted, he said.
   There was no forced entry at the house, he added. Deputies found
no signs of violence or a struggle, police Sgt. Joe Quisenberry
said.
   The couple's two cars, a 1989 Geo Prizm and a 1988 Chevrolet
Cavalier, were missing. Guns, liquor, jewelry and part of a coin
collection were believed taken from the home, Helterhoff added.
   Helterhoff said the FBI was questioning neighbors and relatives
and had talked with two of the couple's children, college students
who weren't at the home Friday.
   Glenn Tarr was assistant manager of marketing information and
research for GM's Chevrolet Division headquarters in Warren, said
GM spokesman Jim Crellin.
   Ralph Kramer, director of public relations for GM's Chevrolet
Division, said Tarr supervised the collection and analysis of sales
data from across the country for Chevrolet.

   More and more Israeli army reservists are
coming up with a wide variety of excuses to avoid duty in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip to put down the Palestinian uprising known as
the intefadah.
   One reservist, identifying himself as Joshua, a 25-year-old
architecture student, said he invented ``psychological problems''
to get out of serving.
   ``There is a limit to what I will do,'' he said. ``If I killed a
Palestinian kid, I don't think I could live with it.''
   Others called up arrive at induction centers on crutches or with
letters from employers saying they are too essential to the
business to be let go. Some claim illness.
   It is what Israelis call a ``gray refusal'' _ getting out of
duty without directly refusing to serve, which would challenge the
pride that Israelis hold for their army.
   Some have legitimate excuses. Others feel their previous combat
training is wasted on what they view as essentially police work.
Still others believe the uprising is not a real military threat to
Israel.
   Most reservists interviewed said they would not hesitate to
serve if Israel faced a war or some other serious threat.
   ``But nobody feels threatened by the intefadeh,'' said Andre
Dreszin, a spokesman for the conscientious objectors' group Yesh
Gvul. ``It's not like the Egyptian and Syrian tanks in 1973 where
if we didn't stop them they would have made it to Tel Aviv.''
   Brig. Gen. Ehud Gross, the army's chief education officer, said
61 soldiers had been tried for refusing to serve in the occupied
territories and he called it ``an ignorable number.''
   ``I do believe that today there is no problem with the
mission,'' he added. ``There are some refuseniks, who decline to
serve in the territories. Those are the minority. The vast
consensus is against them.''
   The newspaper Yediot Ahronot recently quoted senior army
officers as estimating the number who avoid service in the
territories has grown into the ``thousands.''
   ``What is significant about this new phenomena is that it
includes those who don't usually try to evade service, like senior
officers and guys from elite units,'' said Ariela Hoffman, a
reporter on military affairs for the newspaper.
   Virtually all Israeli men and women serve two to three years of
mandatory service starting at age 18. Men continue in the reserve
until age 56, and it is estimated the army can triple its size by
calling up 370,000 reservists within a few days.
   Since the uprising began in December 1987, seven Israeli
soldiers have been killed, including a 28-year-old reservist whose
skull was crushed by a stone dropped from a roof by a Palestinian.
At least 600 Arabs have been killed by soldiers or Israeli
civilians, and 33 Israeli civilians also have been slain.
   Dreszin, the conscientious objector who has not been called up
during the uprising but served 63 days in jail for refusing service
in the Lebanon war, said some reservists avoid service by using
minor illnesses that they would disregard if called up for a real
war.
   ``They exploit their illness,'' he said. ``They say to
themselves, `Why should I ignore my medical problems if they help
me stay out of the territories?'''
   Reservists usually receive their call-up notices in the mail
weeks in advance, so they have plenty of time to work out excuses.
Letters from professors telling of upcoming exams are plentiful on
call-up day, as well as those from employers and doctors.
   ``If you cry enough in the army they will say, `Go home,' just
to get rid of you; you are demoralizing,'' said a 32-year-old
lawyer and father of three identifying himself only as Motti.
   There are other ways to get out of duty in the territories.
   One officer was indicted for accepting bribes from reservists to
assign them to an ``easy posting.''
   Yediot Ahronot also reported that one man called to duty fired a
few rounds into the air and shouted, ``We're going to kill Arabs!''
His intent was to have officers declare him too unstable.
   Among soldiers who do serve in the territories, despite
misgivings, some have found their own ways to protect their ideals.
   Paul, 29, a soft-spoken immigrant from England, recently served
16 days in Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, but said he
ignored orders to fire at stone throwers.
   ``Some of the guys were shooting at the kids as they got off the
truck,'' he said. ``I shot at a garbage can.''

   Environmentalists will honor a farmer who
won a battle of wits with bugs.
   James M. Szynal, a farmer in the western Massachusetts town of
Florence and chief mechanic at Woods Enterprises, will be presented
on Saturday with an award from the Massachusetts Audubon Society
for a homemade device that vacuums bugs off potato plants.
   He developed the ``Beetle Eater'' two years ago at the request
of another farmer, who didn't want to use pesticides. It can suck
potato beetles off four rows of plants at one time as it is towed
through a field.
   The machine can clean 50 to 70 acres of potatoes in a day and
removes 75 to 95 percent of the beetles, according to Szynal.
   ``This farmer walked into my garage ... and said, `You've got to
invent something to take the bugs off the plant. The spray's
killing me,''' Szynal said Thursday. ``Ten days later I had a
machine rolling.''
   The key to the machine is a blower that dislodges the beetles; a
vacuum hose then scoops them up.
   ``The Colorado potato beetle likes to play dead as soon as it
senses any noise or movement, that's why we had to add the blower
to shake them up,'' Szynal said.
   Szynal has other inventions for the farm. There's a vacuum
device that debugs strawberry plants, a plastic cutter that makes
round holes in plastic ground covers for corn plants, and an
automatic pickle picker.
   ``It used to be I'd put my whole week's pay into my inventions
and be broke by Wednesday,'' he said.

   Two men who reeled in a cat from an old
water well say their feat is no fish story.
   Charles Wolfinger and Terry Johnson, reserve officers for the
Vanderburgh County Sheriff's Department, said workers at a truck
stop heard a cat's meows from a well.
   The attached a towel to a hook and dropped fishing line 45 feet
down an 8-inch water pipe. The cat clawed on to the towel, and the
men pulled it to safety.
   ``I thought that by instinct they like to claw things and I
thought that if I could get a piece of cloth down to it, it would
grab on,'' Wolfinger said.
   He said someone apparently had dropped the cat in the well
because a heavy hinged lid over the opening had been closed.
   A worker took the cat home.

   NBC's studio tour, begun at Rockefeller Center
shortly after the network moved there at the dawn of radio's golden
age in 1933, has a new look focusing on modern TV technology like
satellites and robotic cameras.
   The revamped tour was formally opened Thursday by NBC President
Robert C. Wright, who said the aim of the updated backstage tour is
to ``make it as contemporary as possible.''
   The tours, which were discontinued in 1977, then resumed six
years later, draw nearly 200,000 people annually. The one-hour trip
costs $7. A similar tour is available at NBC studios in Burbank,
Calif.
   Looks at the studios where ``Today'' and ``Saturday Night Live''
originate still are included in the New York tour.
   Each trip ends in a small studio where the customers can appear
in a mock version of the ``Tonight'' show and see themselves on TV
monitors.
   The tours are conducted by a staff of pages whose precedecessors
include ``Nightline'' anchorman Ted Koppel, actress Kate Jackson
and former NBC Chairman Grant Tinker.
   Although the tours begin in what NBC calls the ``radio
orientation theater'' and include videotaped looks at NBC's radio
days, no tours of radio broadcast operations are given, for such
operations no longer exist at NBC.
   General Electric Co., owner of NBC, sold the company's radio
networks in 1987 to Westwood One Inc., in Los Angeles.

   Some people have trouble finding
homes for unwanted cats. One cat, though, is wanted by two
families, and a detective and lawyer have been called in.
   In June, Bonnie Bouman's parents gave her 2-year-old cat, Dee
Dee, to the the local Humane Society while she was in Paris
studying French. The cat had begun urinating in the house and
bringing home dead mice.
   Bouman reacted in horror to the news and called the society from
Paris. She pleaded with them not to put Dee Dee to sleep. ``I told
them I'd fly home immediately to claim the cat,'' said Bouman, now
a student at the University of Michigan.
   Too late: Another family had adopted Dee Dee.
   Humane Society Director Betsy Pullen said Dee Dee's new family
won't give her up, and she won't make them. ``The cat is very
content,'' Pullen said.
   Bouman hired a private detective for $200 to track down the new
owners. When that didn't work, she hired a lawyer.
   Some of Bouman's friends think she's gone overboard, but she
doesn't care.
   ``Pets can be best friends, and that's what Dee Dee was to me,''
she said.

   The trio then allegedly ate Ndong's stomach, liver, heart,

   The news agency did not give further details about the type of
ceremony. Murder and cannibalism are both punishable by death in
this West African country.
   The three will be tried Nov. 23.

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The jagged, gray concrete wall that divides Berlin
is a Cold War symbol of freedom denied.
   It was built under the direction of Erich Honecker to stop the
hemorrhage of East Germans fleeing to the West _ about 2.5 million
escaped to freedom from 1949 until Aug. 13, 1961.
   Now, in one of history's ironies, the flight to freedom of
hundreds of thousands of East Germans around the wall and through
neighboring countries has forced the Communist government to back
down and declare free travel will be allowed.
   And 77-year-old Erich Honecker has been swept out as Communist
Party leader by the exodus and by protests by East Germans
demanding democratic reforms.
   The 15-foot-high structure cut through the city, dividing
families, friend from friend, Berliner from Berliner and communism
from capitalism.
   It drew American presidents like John F. Kennedy who declared:
``Ich bin ein Berliner.'' It drew tourists like onlookers viewing
the scene of a grim accident.
   Hundreds of brave East Germans tried to scale the wall or tunnel
under it or crash through a checkpoint. Many died in the attempt.
   The 28-mile-long wall is only a part of elaborate fortifications
that stretch all along the 860-mile border between East Germany and
West Germany. A barrier of barbed wire, armed guards, death strips
and eerie lights that played over the border at night.
   But it was the cold concrete wall in Berlin, which is surrounded
by East German territory, that became the symbol. ``We kept telling
ourselves, `You cannot put a wall right through a major city,''
said Helmut Haar on the wall's 25th anniversary. ``Now we're used
to it.''
   Visiting presidents and prime ministers climbed a special stand
to peer over the wall into East Germany. Many called for the wall
to be dismantled.
   But East Germany insisted they dared not open the wall. Honecker
said time and again: ``The wall will remain as long as the
conditions that led to is construction endure.''
   With the political change sweeping in from Moscow and striking
reforms taking place in nearby Poland and Hungary, the discredited
and hard-line East German was finally overwhelmed by a popular
revolt.
   From barbed wire and simple barricades started in 1961, the wall
has grown in some areas to a pair of parallel concrete barriers
with a ``death strip'' in between.
   Many escape attempts have ended with freedom-seekers lying dead
in the shadows of the Berlin Wall or somewhere along the frontier
between the two countries.
   Running, driving and even swimming, thousands of people have
been caught trying to flee from East Germany over the Berlin Wall
or across fortifications along the border with West Germany.
   Mention of the Berlin Wall conjures up memories not only of
desperate escape attempts, but also of major spy swaps between East
and West.
   For years, border guards watching out for escapes had
shoot-to-kill orders, but earlier this year the East Germans
announced the orders had been lifted.
   According to West German statistics, up until recently as many
as 4,000 people were held in East German jails and prisons in
connection with failed escape attempts. The East German government
has since pardoned them and they are to be released by the end of
the month.
   The Aug. 13 Working Group, a West Berlin organization that
tracks human rights abuses in East Germany, estimates a total of
191 people were killed trying to flee East Germany between 1961 and
1988.
   In the first few months after the wall was erected, 14 trucks
rammed holes in the barrier. In September 1962, 147 people dug
under the wall in the largest of several successful tunnel escapes.
   In 1983, two young men used an archery bow to fire a cable over
the wall from an attic to an accomplice on a rooftop in the West.
They attached pulleys to the cable and rode in the dark over the
heads of guards to the West.

   A Navy fighter jet exploded and crashed into
an apartment complex while attempting to land near this Atlanta
suburb Thursday evening, engulfing several buildings in a fireball
that left five people missing.
   Smyrna police Lt. J.L. Martin said officers believed at least
one man was trapped and killed in the fire that destroyed two
apartment buildings and heavily damaged two others. Officials gave
conflicting estimates of the number of injured ranging from four to
12 people.
   ``My first officer on the scene said he heard screams, but the
building was engulfed in flames and he couldn't get in,'' Martin
said.
   By late Thursday night, however, authorities had accounted for
everyone in the two buildings that were destroyed and found no
bodies in nine of 12 apartment units whose occupants had not been
located, said John Patterson, the Cobb County emergency management
director.
   Five people were unaccounted for in the remaining three
apartments, which were to be searched later in the night.
   Capt. George Brogdon of the Smyrna Police Department said
several injuries were serious. Among the injured was the pilot, who
was in critical condition with burns and internal injuries after
ejecting from the plane.
   Authorities said the A-7E Corsair II attack jet crashed shortly
after 6 p.m. into the Pine Village Apartments off Windy Hill Road,
a heavily traveled thoroughfare lined with scores of apartment
complexes and businesses.
   Witnesses said the plane landed in a parking lot, setting
several cars on fire and spewing burning fuel over the buildings.
The fire was under control about two hours after the crash.
   Several witnesses said the jet exploded in the air.
   ``I saw it out my kitchen window. It was stable, then it just
exploded in the air and went straight down,'' said Tawanna
Washington, who lives in an adjacent apartment complex.
   ``When I went outside, I saw a ball of fire heading toward the
ground,'' said eyewitness Terry Scott. ``After the second or third
explosion, the pilot ejected himself from the seat.''
   Scott said he saw the pilot's parachute deploy when he was just
about 100 feet above the ground. ``When I got to the pilot to give
him CPR, he had multiple contusions and was bleeding profusely from
the nose and mouth. I gave him CPR and got him as comfortable as
possible.''
   Navy spokesman Kerry Honore said the pilot, a Naval reservist,
was attempting to land at Dobbins Air Force Base, about 15 miles
north of Atlanta, but crashed 2.5 miles short of the runway. The
jet is based at the Naval Air Station, which is located at Dobbins.
   Honore, who said the plane carried no ammunition, could not
confirm that the jet exploded in the air. He said authorities did
not know what caused the crash.
   A Navy Department spokesman, Cmdr. Mark Baker, said he presumed
the plane was on a routine training mission.
   Joy Schmiedt, who lives two miles from the complex, said she
heard two explosions and her TV blinked off.
   ``I went to door and saw flames in the air. (I) went over there
and (the place) was just totally engulfed in flames,'' she said.
   Ms. Schmiedt, a nurse, ran to the scene and offered help. ``It
was a horrible sight. I'm convinced there are people still in their
apartments they haven't found.''
   A resident of the apartment complex, John Finch, said he escaped
from the building along with his wife. He said he saw a woman and a
girl run out from another unit engulfed in flames. ``I don't think
the husband made it out,'' Finch said.
   Martin Singleton, 21, said he had been away from his apartment
visiting friends.
   ``I got back in time just to see my apartment on fire,'' he
said. ``It's gone. There's nothing left.''
   He said he was searching for a friend who he thinks was at home.
``I don't know if he's dead or alive,'' Singleton said.
   Smyrna Fire Chief Larry Williams originally said 12 people,
including the pilot, were injured. But Williams later said he was
lowering the count to four. A check at area hospitals also
indicated four people were injured. Brogdon, however, said police
were standing by their earlier count of seven injured. He said some
of the injured might not have been admitted to hospitals.
   Most of the injured were taken to Kennestone Hospitals, two
sister medical centers in Marietta, as a huge traffic jam of
emergency vehicles, rush-hour commuters and curiosity seekers
quickly developed.
   The pilot, a reservist who was not identified, was in critical
condition after undergoing surgery late Thursday night, said
Kennestone official Bill Ballew.
   A 28-year-old woman and her 5-year-old daughter were in critical
condition with burns at Grady Hospital, said Grady spokeswoman
Beverly Thomas. The mother was identified as 28-year-old Margie
Padovani by Susan Padgett, a spokeswoman at Kennestone Hospital,
where the two were taken initally.
   Ballew said another woman was being treated for minor injuries
at Kennestone Hospital at Windy Hill, a sister hospital of
Kennestone.
   Lt. Cmdr. Jim Lawrence of the Naval Reserve, a friend of the
pilot, said he flew the same plane earlier Thursday on a separate
training mission.
   Lawrence said it was in ``beautiful'' shape at the time. He said
he doesn't have any idea what might have causd the crash.
   He said he and the pilot, who still had not been unidentified,
both work at Delta Air Lines and had put in time with the reserves.
   Lawrence said he has known the pilot for about three years and
described him as a ``capable, excellent'' pilot.
   Asked whether the pilots worry when they fly over heavily
populated areas during training missions, Lawrence said, ``It's a
concern. You have a tremendous concern for the people around here.''
   The A-7E, which entered service as the A-7 in the 1965, is a
single-seat attack aircraft used for a variety of bombing missions
on land and at sea.
   The current version has undergone a number of modifications. The
A-7E has a 20mm gun and can carry payloads of up to 15,000 pounds
of bombs and missiles.
   Navy records indicate that A-7E Corsair IIs were part of the
two-carrier battle group that conducted a joint strike on selected
Libyan terrorist-related targets in 1986. Together with
carrier-based F-A-18s, A-7s used anti-radar missiles to neutralize
air defenses.

<HEAD>Shakespeare's Four Folios Fetch $2 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A set of the first four successive editions of
Shakespeare's collected plays was sold Thursday for $2 million, a
record for what are known as the ``Four Folios,'' Sotheby's said.
   Apart from an unfinished attempt in 1619 to publish a collected
issue of Shakespeare's plays, the Folios were the only collected
editions printed in the 17th Century, according to the auction
catalog.
   ``I never paid $2 million for anything before,'' said James
Cummins, a Manhattan dealer who bought the Folios for a customer he
would identify only as a private American collector. ``I'm a little
nervous but excited.''
   Cummins said he and his customer had been looking for at least
the first Folio for about five years.
   ``The first Folio is the first collected works of Shakespeare,''
he explained. ``The four together are exceedingly desirable, but
the first Folio is the one that you're really paying a premium to
get because it's almost impossible to find a fine copy and this is
a very, very nice copy indeed.''
   A first edition of the two volumes of ``El ingenioso hidalgo don
Quixote de la Mancha,'' by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, sold for
$1.65 million to a London dealer, said a Sotheby's spokesman,
Matthew Weigman.
   A first edition of Nicolaus Copernicus' ``De revolutionibus
orbium coelestium,'' dated 1543, in which he first put forth the
theory that the sun is at the center of the planets, sold for
$473,000 to an Italian dealer.
   The same dealer paid the same price for what Sotheby's said is
the only copy in private hands of the first edition of the first
printed announcement of Copernicus's heliocentric theory.
   ``De libris revolutionum ... Nicolai Copernici ... narratio
prima,'' was written by Georg Joachim Rheticus in 1540.
   The works in Thursday's sale, which drew $10.4 million, came
from The Garden Ltd. collection of books and manuscripts relating
to the history of ideas. It was amassed by Haven O'More and Michael
Davis over more than 25 years as part of a publishing venture,
Weigman said.
   The sale continues Friday.

<HEAD>King Tells Abernathy Book Was Unfair To His Father</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s eldest
son told the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy that the former King aide's
book about his father was unfair, a newspaper said.
   In an interview Thursday to be published in Friday's editions of
The Tennessean, Martin Luther King III said he had spoken with
Abernathy following the dedication of the Civil Rights Memorial in
Montgomery, Ala.
   ``I told him I have always been taught to love people and I
still love you,'' King said. ``I said, `I think your treatment of
my father was unfair.' But I told him I loved him and I always
will.''
   It was believed to be the first time a member of the King family
had talked to Abernathy since the publication of his autobiography,
``And The Walls Came Tumbling Down.''
   Abernathy, 63, was president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference from 1968 to 1977 and was King's closest aide
during the civil rights movement.
   He wrote that King spent the night with two women and fought
with a third in Memphis the night before he was assassinated by
James Earl Ray.
   Abernathy's account has been condemned and disputed by other
associates of King.
   After the memorial on the Southern Poverty Law Center grounds
was dedicated Sunday, King said he took Abernathy's hand and called
him ``Uncle Ralph.''
   ``What I was doing in speaking to him was in no way to express
any malicious sentiment. It was a concerned sentiment. It was just
human nature to speak to him,'' said King. He said he spoke for
himself and not other members of his family.
   Because of the negative reaction to his book, Abernathy was
excluded from the speaker's platform during the ceremonies honoring
King and 39 others slain in the struggle for civil rights.
   After the speeches, Abernathy rushed up the stairs and began
shaking hands with people on the platform. He and King spoke
briefly.
   Abernathy told The Tennessean on Thursday that King called him
``Uncle Ralph,'' and said Abernathy had embarrassed his family and
him.
   Abernathy said he loves Martin Luther King III, and said he will
be writing him and talking to him in the future.
   ``I will tell him that his father was my dearest friend,''
Abernathy said. ``I am a part of him. A part of me went on the trip
with him. He was my best buddy.''
   ``He was a human being,'' Abernathy said. ``He was frail, just
as all of us are. I want to tell his children that.''

<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa is about to
make his first trip to the United States, and he says the prospect
leaves him ``trembling.''
   Simultaneously nervous about leaving Poland for too long and
fearful of disappointing his U.S. hosts with a visit that's too
short, Walesa said in an interview with The Associated Press that
he sees Poland's future hinging at least in part on how he does
during seven busy days in Washington, New York, Chicago and
Philadelphia.
   The journey, which begins in Canada and winds up in Venezuela,
is highlighted by two meetings with President Bush and a speech to
a joint session of Congress on Nov. 15, where Walesa will appeal
for economic aid and investment in Poland.
   When asked what his message was for the United States, Walesa
replied:
   ``We need Columbuses from the States to come and discover
Poland, to clear the trail. First clear the trail, clear it like
Columbus. ... Then there will an influx of millionaires. Because
there is business to be done here.''
   The former shipyard electrician who won the Nobel Peace Prize in
1983 and engineered the formation of the East bloc's first
non-communist government will be among the few people who were not
heads of a government or state to address Congress. Other private
people so honored included Revolutionary War hero Marquis de
LaFayette and Winston Churchill, after he left office.
   Walesa, a guest of AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland and the union
federation, arrives in Washington Monday and leaves for Venezuela
Nov. 19.
   ``Any trip to the States shorter than one month is no good,'' a
harried but bantering Walesa said in the interview in his Gdansk
office before his departure.
   With the limited time at his disposal, ``I will disappoint many,
and that it why it is not a good trip and a trip which is dangerous
for me. I cannot satisfy Americans in such a short time. I cannot
thank Americans enough. It is physically impossible,'' he said.
   In addition, he said he is burdened by the prospect of something
going wrong in Poland while he is away.
   Walesa, whose mother and stepfather lived in the United States,
canceled a trip in 1981 because the political situation was too
unstable. Martial law was imposed a few months later.
   He seems to have similar fears about being away too long now,
even with his friend Tadeusz Mazowiecki sitting comfortably at the
helm of government and scores of his union colleages filling the
benches of parliament.
   ``Whatever bad happens _ knock wood, it could _ will be all
blamed on me,'' Walesa said. ``That I did it deliberately, that I
did not anticipate it. ... That is why I am trembling. In these
conditions I cannot make a good visit.''
   At a time when Walesa would seem able to savor the fruits of his
victories in 1989 _ Solidarity regained legal status, swept all the
parliament races it entered and took over the government in a
once-unimaginable defeat for the Communists _ he claims to be more
burdened than ever.
   By comparison, his lonely work as an organizer of free trade
unions in the late 1970s and his years of internment and
surveillance after Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's martial-law crackdown
were ``easy, like playing in the boy scouts,'' he said.
   ``I think that the difficult things are only coming now. Let's
not forget that we are building something now, we are building an
America in the East. But can we anticipate everything? ... This
will be the danger.''
   He also sees a personal danger for himself _ the swift passage
of time and the unlikelihood that he can lay his burdens down soon.
   ``I don't like what I am doing,'' he said.
   ``I was born a free man, and now what's offered me is slavery.
... I felt better when I was a prisoner than I do now that I am
free. Then I could lay down and rest. And now it is like being
under arrest even at home. I cannot even walk outside. Somebody is
immediately on me.
   ``And so time is running out. I want to live a little, and I
don't know if it is possible anymore.''
   He also worries a bit that his political wits may be getting
dull.
   ``So far it is not too bad. But I don't know. I am getting
older, but I am trying to save myself. I am doing calisthenics now
because I am starting to feel exhausted. Maybe I weigh too much.
Just to stretch it out, I have started wearing jeans, pretending to
be 18 years old. I do sports to extend my life. I don't know if it
is going to work.''
   Walesa said he thought communism was finished ``a long time
ago.''
   ``But it all depends on what we understand by `communism' If you
understand the monopoly of one party, a monopoly over everything,
then that has been over for a long time. It cannot be maintained.''
   But if communism was to find a way to stop limiting freedom and
pluralism and correct ``a few other minor things,'' then ``it might
not be entirely a stupid ideology someday, when people forget about
all its sins.''

<TEXT>
   Torsten Ryl had been a Berliner all 24 years of
his life. But until early today, he had never seen the other half
of the divided city.
   Suddenly, all it took was a flash of his identity card.
   ``At the stroke of midnight, they told us, `The procedure has
been shortened, and all you need is a stamp,''' said Ryl, a waiter,
still awestruck at his sudden crossing into the West through
Checkpoint Charlie.
   ``It's not my intention to stay here, but we have to have the
possibility to come over here and go back again,'' Ryl said. ``I
have my apartment and my car over there.''
   A middle-aged West German reached over, gave him 20 marks ($11)
and said with a grin: ``Why don't you go get yourself a beer
first?''
   In what seemed like a fantasy, thousands of Berliners today
strolled through the other half of the city where Communist East
Germany had denied them free passage for 28 years.
   Helmut and Katarina Erdmann said they briefly left their three
sleeping children at home in East Berlin.
   ``We just wanted to go for a stroll,'' Helmut Erdmann said.
``It's crazy.''
   West Berliners also crossed eastward. Germans from both sides
held impromptu dances atop the wall, hoisting people up from both
sides to join them.
   Thomas Moll said he was allowed to cross into West Berlin in
less than five minutes.
   ``I just can't believe it,'' he said. ``A lot of people thought
it was just another trick.''
   Moll, 21, said he also intended to return home after having a
look around West Berlin.
   He reluctantly gave his name to reporters. ``You're not from
Stasi, are you?'' he asked, referring to the East German state
security service.
   It seemed as if each East Berliner who crossed the demarcation
line was greeted with cheers _ many by hugs and kisses _ by the
crowd at Checkpoint Charlie.
   Traffic jams built up on the western side of the checkpoint, and
people with sparklers and champagne bottles streamed out of the
Kochstrasse subway stop on the West Berlin side to join the party.
   Thousands celebrated on the Kurfuerstendamm, a boulevard in West
Berlin's upscale shopping district.
   East German Trabant cars were welcomed by cheers and honking
horns as they slowly wended their way down the boulevard, which for
one night was the scene of the wildest celebrations since the
Berlin Wall was born in the Cold War.
   ``This is a historic day!'' one man yelled. ``We're going to be
able to tell our children about this!''

<HEAD>Man Acquitted in Florida Rape Case to Face Georgia Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man whose rape acquittal in Florida
gained national attention when jurors criticized the woman's
clothing is now facing attempted rape charges in his home state of
Georgia.
   Steven Lamar Lord, 26, was indicted Wednesday on one count each
of false imprisonment, aggravated assault with intent to commit
rape, criminal attempt to commit rape and robbery in an attack on a
Gwinnett woman Sept. 21, 1988.
   The 24-year-old woman says she was raped a knifepoint.
   Lord was first indicted in the case in January, but Assistant
District Attorney Scott Smeal said a new indictment was issued to
change the language of the aggravated assault charge.
   A six-member jury in Broward County, Fla., found Lord innocent
of charges last month that he raped a 22-year-old woman at knife
point after abducting her from a Fort Lauderdale restaurant parking
lot in November 1988.
   Several jurors said the woman enticed Lord with skimpy clothing,
including a lace miniskirt with no underwear.
   ``She was obviously dressed for a good time, but we felt she may
have bit off more than she could chew,'' juror Mary Bradshaw said
following the verdict, which unleashed outrage around the nation
from sexual assualt counselors and women's groups.
   The woman, wearing various disguises, has appeared on several
national talks shows to discuss the case.
   During the trial, Lord's attorney told jurors that the woman
agreed to have sex with Lord in exchange for $100 and cocaine.

   A chronology of the Berlin Wall, erected 28 years
ago at the height of Cold War tensions:
   Aug. 13, 1961 _ East German troops move to seal all access to
West Berlin after a mass exodus of hundreds of thousands of East
Germans threatens to ruin the economy.
   In the following days, barbed wire is replaced by concrete
barriers. Houses along the border are sealed. Border guards are
issued shoot-to-kill orders for all those trying to flee. West
Berlin is encircled and isolated from the West.
   June 26, 1963 _ President Kennedy visits West Berlin. In a show
of solidarity with the divided city, he declares to a cheering
crowd of 400,000 at the wall: ``I am a Berliner.''
   June 12, 1987 _ President Reagan visits West Berlin and calls on
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to tear the wall down.
   March 8, 1989 _ The last fatality related to an escape attempt
over the Berlin Wall is recorded. An East Berlin man falls to his
death after his homemade hot-air balloon deflates prematurely. A
total of 80 East Germans have been reported killed trying to flee
over the wall since 1961.
   Oct. 18, 1989 _ Hard-line leader Erich Honecker, who supervised
the building of the Wall, is replaced after an unprecendented wave
of unrest and the exodus of thousands of citizens.
   Nov. 3, 1989 _ In the first direct challenge to the wall's
purpose, East Berlin announces that East Germans who want to flee
West can do so over the Czechoslovak border. Tens of thousands do
so.
   Nov. 9, 1989 _ The Communist leadership declares that citizens
can travel directly to West Germany through East German checkpoints
with proper documentation. Thousands of East Berliners make their
way to the Berlin Wall. Officials waive the requirement for visas
and thousands stream over to West Berlin for a night of celebration.
   An East German border trooper jokes that the Wall will soon be
broken up into pieces and sold as souvenirs for convertible
currency.

   Actor Robert Redford owns a ski resort in
the mountains east of Salt Lake City, but he's opposed to widening
the road that leads to it, and has mixed feelings about bringing
the Winter Olympics to Utah.
   Utah voters on Tuesday approved a referendum calling for
spending $56 million to build ski jumps, a speed skating oval and
bobsled-luge runs required by the International Olympics Committee,
which will pick a 1998 site in June 1991.
   Redford said he personally was not opposed to the Games _ none
of which would be held at his Sundance resort _ but felt the state
should make sure the Olympics did not lead to further damage of the
Utah environment.
   ``What is Utah going to do to protect its future rather than
squander it for a 16-day event?'' he said.
   Redford criticized proposals to expand to four lanes the
two-lane Provo Canyon highway, which leads to his resort.
   ``Are we going to cut the canyon to suit the road or cut the
road to suit the canyon? Personally, I prefer the latter,'' he said.

   About 80 women on a tiny island in the
Venetian lagoon are busy stitching lace for a shawl to be given to
Soviet first lady Raisa Gorbachev.
   Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti personally selected the model
and decorative pattern for the shawl by the Burano lace makers that
he will present during Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's Nov. 29
visit to Italy. It has not yet been disclosed whether Mrs.
Gorbachev will accompany her husband.
   Gorbachev will meet with Andreotti in Rome and meet Dec. 1 with
Pope John Paul II, the first meeting between the leaders of the
Kremlin and Vatican.
   The fishing village of Burano is the center of traditional
Venetian lace making, an art that has suffered from industrial
competition. It takes three days for a pocket handkerchief to be
braided in `Burano' stitch.
   Britain's Queen Elizabeth II is among the former customers of
the island's artisans. She ordered a set of sheets and tablecloths

<HEAD>Gasoline Vapors Unhealthy, Consumer Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consumer group is calling for tighter
controls on toxic gasoline vapors, saying that motorists who pump
their own gas are being exposed to unhealthy levels of
cancer-causing benzene and other pollutants.
   Citizen Action, a Washington-based organization that focuses on
consumer and environmental issues, accused the oil companies
Thursday of ignoring health concerns by increasing levels of
benzene and other aromatic hydrocarbons in unleaded gasoline to
boost its octane rating.
   The American Petroleum Institute issued a statement that
disputed the claims and accused Citizen Action of raising
``unwarranted fears about motorists' exposure to gasoline.''
   The Environmental Protection Agency acknowledged that toxic
vapors from gasoline at the pump are a health concern, but an
agency spokesman suggested the claims raised by Citizen Action on
health impact may be exaggerated.
   Nevertheless, said EPA spokesman David Ryan, the Bush
administration proposal for tightening federal air quality laws
calls for better vapor-capturing devices such as sleeves or hoods
on gasoline pumps. It also would require oil companies to produce
gasoline that releases less vapor pollutants.
   Several localities already require vapor-control hoods on
gasoline pumps, but the devices have been controversial because
they have been found to be cumbersome and unpopular in many cases.
   Benzene, which has been shown to cause leukemia, appears in
petroleum products such as gasoline and its vapors. It also is
generated during combustion and releases through motor vehicle
tailpipes.
   The report by Citizen Action claimed that motorists are exposed
to benzene levels of more than 1 part per million when refueling
their cars _ a level expected to result, according to several
studies, in at least two additional cancer cases over a lifetime
per 1 million people exposed. It said a California study suggested
even higher exposures.
   ``Despite the scientific evidence demonstrating that human
exposure to benzene increases the risk of contracting cancer, oil
companies have neither adequately warned consumers, nor acted to
responsibly reduce benzene levels,'' said the citizen group.
   Ed Rothschild, energy and environmental policy director for
Citizen Action, said the EPA ``has sat on its hands for the last 13
years and has done nothing to regulate mobile sources of benzene,''
although it recently announced regulations to curb benzene releases
from industrial facilities and storage tanks.
   The American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry's trade
group, denounced the Citizen Action claims, calling the allegations
``a disservice to the consumers it purports to represents.''
   Gus Ensz, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, said
consumers' exposure to benzene at service stations is for ``only a
few minutes a week (and) typically to low levels.''
   The trade group accused Citizen Action of trying ``to raise
unwarranted fears'' among motorists.
   The Environmental Protection Agency recently announced tighter
controls on benzene emissions from a variety of sources from
industrial plants to storage facilities because chronic exposure is
believed to cause leukemia. But the new regulations do not cover
emissions from motor vehicles, which the agency says accounts for
about 80 percent of the benzene releases.
   Most of the releases from gasoline occur through vehicle
tailpipes during fuel combustion, but a substantial amount also is
released through gasoline vapors with exposure being greatest at
service stations when motorists are refueling, environmental
studies have said.
   Citizen Action is a Washington-based federation of citizen
groups that claims more than 2 million members in 25 states. It
focuses on a variety of consumer, environmental and health issues.

   Opponents of smoking aboard airliners are on
the verge of winning their fight to forbid passengers from lighting
up on practically all U.S. flights.
   The Senate by voice vote Thursday passed a prohibition against
cigarette smoking on all but a handful of domestic flights.
Tobacco-state lawmakers, long convinced they were badly
outnumbered, made no comments on the prohibition.
   The House approved the ban, included in a $12 billion
transportation bill for the new fiscal year, on Oct. 31. The Senate
will continue debate on the spending measure Tuesday and will send
it to President Bush for his signature if no changes in the
legislation are made.
   ``Approval of this law is a milestone in the efforts to protect
those who don't want to put themselves at risk by inhaling other
people's smoke,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., the measure's
sponsor.
   The new restrictions permanently forbid smoking on all routes
within the continental United States, and on all flights to and
from Alaska and Hawaii scheduled for six hours or less.
   The current ban _ which expires next April _ applies only to
routes lasting two hours or less, covering 80 percent of all
flights.
   Smoking would remain legal on only about 28 of the 17,500 daily
scheduled U.S. flights, according to the House sponsor of the
measure, Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill. Uncovered would be 24 flights
each day to Alaska and Hawaii and four to Guam.
   Lautenberg and his allies, citing studies by the surgeon
general's office and other sources, have argued that it is
unhealthy to breathe cigarette fumes from smokers.
   Tobacco industry supporters insist cigarette smoke is only one
chemical in airline cabin air, which is recirculated. They have
argued Congress should not act until the Department of
Transportation completes a study next year on the components of
cabin air.
   ``The Congress has essentially acted in an informational
vacuum,'' said spokesman Walker Merryman of the Tobacco Institute,
the cigarette industry's trade group.
   Cigar and pipe smoking aboard airliners has been illegal since
1983.
   The bill also provides $3.2 billion for anti-drug programs; $40
million to begin building a new airport in Denver, the nation's
first new airport in 15 years; and $14 million to develop new
bomb-detection machines.

<HEAD>It's an Ethics Package, Not a Pay Raise</HEAD>

   Ask House Speaker Thomas S. Foley about plans
for a 33 percent congressional pay hike and his response reflects
the barrage of semantics that is a key part of many lawmakers'
strategy.
   ``Are you talking about the ethics package?'' he says.
   And the initial 7.7 percent raise members would receive on Jan.
1 is a ``cost-of-living adjustment, not a pay raise,'' he says.
``If you are talking about a pay adjustment, no one is proposing to
do that in this Congress.''
   Ten months after public uproar drove lawmakers to kill a
proposed 51 percent salary increase for Congress, the judiciary and
top executive branch jobs, House leaders are charging ahead with a
new mix of semantics and timing, public policy and financial
self-interest.
   House members would within 14 months see their salaries rise
from $89,500 to more than $120,000. The initial pay boost is billed
as a cost-of-living adjustment to make up for two years of
inflation without an increase.
   The bulk of the raise, a 25 percent boost, would be delayed
until Jan. 1, 1991, after the next Congress is elected. At that
time, lawmakers would be banned from keeping money from speeches
before interest groups.
   It was James Madison who suggested that the Constitution bar
lawmakers from approving pay increases to take effect in the same
Congress.
   ``This is not the same old saw,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif.,
who along with Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., led a bipartisan panel
that fashioned the plan.
   Other ethics reforms would include requiring members to disclose
more about their personal finances and new restrictions on the
gifts they could receive. Final details of the package were being
negotiated this week between Republicans and Democrats in the House
and Senate, and with the White House.
   The new proposal also would be handled in a more straightforward
way than earlier this year, when former House Speaker Jim Wright
tried to force the 51 percent pay hike into effect without a vote.
On this one, members will be forced to record their views.
   ``Clearly the package that's before us now is substantially
better,'' said Rep. Thomas Tauke, R-Iowa, a leader of the effort to
defeat the earlier proposal.
   Tauke said he would not actively oppose the new plan, but he
wouldn't vote for it. Among his reasons is the inclusion of the pay
increase starting in January.
   ``It is very difficult, I think, to explain to people back home
that a cost of living adjustment is not a pay raise,'' said Tauke,
who is running for the Senate.
   Tauke and others said it was bad timing for Congress to consider
a pay raise before it has taken steps to correct massive budgetary
problems.
   The failure to enact a deficit-reduction bill this year has
required the Bush administration, under the Gramm-Rudman law, to
order across-the-board spending cuts. The Pentagon said this week
it could be forced to reduce U.S. troop strength by tens of
thousands.
   Foley on Thursday said he was willing to put forward the
pay-and-ethics plan before a fiscal settlement, but others said
that would be a mistake.
   ``There is no question in my mind (that) if we cannot eliminate
the across-the-board cuts, there is no chance members are going to
vote for a pay raise,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman Leon
Panetta, D-Calif., who is working to complete the deficit bill.
   Rep. Jim Chapman, D-Texas, said many members, including himself,
would be very cautious about voting for a pay raise. ``I don't
think there's anything about this thing that's popular,'' he said.
   President Bush has indicated a willingness to accept a raise,
since he badly wants to increase salaries for federal judges and
his top political appointees in the administration.
   Senators, however, have little desire to risk anything for a pay
boost. They generally have more personal wealth than their House
colleagues and their rules let them keep honoraria equal to 40
percent of their salaries, compared to 30 percent in the House _
and senators have a much easier time lining up speeches.
   ``There's not a lot of support in the Senate for a pay raise,''
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said Thursday.
   House and Senate leaders have discussed the possibility that the
Senate might accept the initial 7.7 percent raise but, for its own
members, eschew the later installment.
   On board or not, members are getting the message.
   ``It's an ethics package. It's not a pay raise,'' quipped Rep.
Jack Buechner, R-Mo., when he was asked for a stance. ``If you
can't get the jargon down...''

<TEXT>
   House and Senate Democrats, with the help of a
maverick Republican senator, are setting the stage for a new
showdown with President Bush over child care subsidies.
   Negotiators from the two congressional bodies reached agreement
Thursday night on legislation that would increase direct federal
child care subsidies to low- and moderate-income families by $1.2
billion in 1990 and by up to $8.5 billion over the next five years.
   The accord was struck after Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, dropped
his demand that states be allowed to issue vouchers for a new $300
million program to pay for keeping schools open longer hours to
provide day care and establish a new education-driven program for
pre-school tots.
   ``At least we have a running shot now with a bill that the
president might not veto,'' said Hatch, who angered the
administration, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole and conservative
groups by joining with liberal Democrats last spring in putting
together the basic package.
   In exchange, House Democrats agreed to allow more of the money
to go to rural areas at governors' discretion and let states issue
vouchers that parents could use to pay for day care services
provided by churches.
   A separate group of House and Senate negotiators still must
reach accord on another provision included in the child care
package that would increase tax credits for poor families with
children by $500 to $750 a year.
   But House and Senate Democratic leaders instructed the chairmen
of their tax-writing committees Thursday to try to settle
differences over that portion by Monday night in a drive to get a
House vote by the end of next week.
   ``We're going to move on the child care bill as a separate item
... and we hope to see an early enactment of it,'' said House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.
   His counterpart in the Senate, Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, said the same effort will be made there, but acknowledged
it will be more difficult to accomplish before adjourning for
Thanksgiving, under Senate rules.
   ``Our problem is there's Republican opposition,'' Mitchell said.
``They're opposed to passing it any time, this year or next.''
   The Senate approved its version of the bill by a 63-37 margin in
June over fierce opposition from the administration and Senate GOP
Leader Bob Dole. A companion measure was approved by the House last
month as part of a bill aimed a bringing down the federal deficit
in fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1.
   With public opinion polls indicating a large majority of
Americans favor federal aid for child care, Democrats and Hatch
hope that Bush would not veto the bill.
   But if he does, said Rep. Gus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the
House Education and Labor Committee, Congress will pass the same
measure again early next year at the opening of the 1990 election
cycle.
   ``It's going to be pretty damned hard to get anybody in 1990 to
vote against child care,'' said Hawkins.
   No one knows exactly how much of the federal block grants to
states are now spent on child care subsidies, but estimates range
from $400 million to $1 billion a year.
   Under the compromise reached Thursday, those block grants would
be augmented with a new $750 million program of child care
subsidies with a mandate that states regulate care providers.
   Another $150 million would be added to the Head Start pre-school
program that now reaches about half a million 3- and 4-year-olds
each year with the aim of turning those facilities into all-day,
year-round child care centers.
   Bush has adamantly opposed making states regulate day care
centers and has insisted that any new aid be limited to tax credits
for poor families with children under age 4 and a slight expansion
of Head Start funding.

Finds</HEAD>

   Four million Americans may have Alzheimer's
disease _ 1.5 million more than had been thought _ according to
findings that suggest the disease and its treatment will ``weigh
heavily on our future.''
   A study of 3,623 elderly people in Boston indicates one in 10 of
them probably had Alzheimer's disease, which robs people of their
memories and their ability to function, researchers said.
   The rates of Alzheimer's grew rapidly higher with advancing age,
as nearly half of those older than 85 suffer from it, said the
researchers, led by Dr. Denis A. Evans of Harvard Medical School.
   Based on the study's results, the National Institute on Aging
revised its estimate of how many people in the United States suffer
from Alzheimer's from 2.5 million to 4 million.
   The institute issued a statement saying the study is unique
because it involved large numbers of people, including those living
in their own homes or with their families, and it included people
with few or no memory problems.
   ``As a result, these estimates might lay the groundwork for
developing the most accurate picture of Alzheimer's disease in the
U.S. population to date,'' said Dr. Zaven Khachaturian, NIA
associate director for neuroscience and neuropsychology of aging.
   Results of the study, partly financed by NIA, were published in
today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   ``People that I see do not realize that this is an extremely
prevalent condition, that it is an epidemic that is going to weigh
heavily on our future,'' said Dr. Bruce Naughton, geriatrics chief
at Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago.
   The U.S. Census Bureau has estimated that from 1980 to the year
2000, the number of people 90 years old and up will increase 236
percent, to 1.9 million, Naughton said.
   The Harvard study consisted of giving brief memory tests to 81
percent of the 65-and-older population of east Boston beginning in
1982, and conducting more extensive psychiatric and laboratory
testing on 467 of the individuals.
   Of people 65 to 74 years old, 3 percent had ``probable''
Alzheimer's disease, compared with 18.7 percent of those 75 to 84
years old and 47.2 percent of those over 85, said the study.
   ``Everyone in our study, whether they had Alzheimer's disease or
not, was living in the community, not in institutions,'' Evans
noted in a telephone interview. ``They may have had impaired
function, far from perfect function, but they were able to live in
the community.''
   Victims of Alzheimer's disease often end up in nursing homes,
but Evans called for finding ways to allow Alzheimer's sufferers to
stay in the community with their families.
   Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative illness of the brain and
nervous system with no known cause, no cure and no effective
treatment, save medication to treat the depression that sometimes
accompanies it.
   The disease usually is fatal within 5 to 10 years, according to
Naughton, who said its first symptom is typically memory loss,
followed by speech difficulties and a tendency to lose one's way
even in familiar surroundings.
   Alzheimer's later robs people of their ability to cook and care
for themselves, as well as exaggerating their personality traits _
such as hot-temperedness or passivity. The illness eventually
confines victims to bed and renders them unable to respond to their
environment, Naughton said.
   The Harvard study ``points out the need for further research,
because the problem is greater than formerly recognized,'' said
Creighton Phelps, vice president of medical and scientific affairs
for the Chicago-based Alzheimer's Association, a research and
family-support group.
   Naughton said Alzheimer's research is relatively well funded
compared with financial support for training physicians to care for
Alzheimer's victims.
   ``We're very poorly prepared in the medical profession to deal
with chronic care,'' he said.

<HEAD>US and Soviet Grain Harvests Larger Than Predicted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American and Soviet farmers are both producing
more grain this year than experts figured a month ago.
   This year's U.S. corn crop, for example, is estimated by the
Agriculture Department at a three-year high of 7.59 billion
bushels, up 54 percent from last year's drought-reduced crop and up
2 percent from the forecast in October.
   Based on recent information out of Moscow, the department on
Thursday also boosted its estimate of 1990 total grain production
by the Soviet Union to 208 million metric tons, up three million
from October indications.
   On a metric basis, the U.S. corn harvest is estimated at 192.8
million tons. And total U.S. grain output this year _ not counting
52.7 million tons of soybeans _ is about 284 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn, or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans.
   In October, the department estimated this year's production at
7.45 billion bushels, a 51 percent increase from last year's
drought-reduced 4.92 billion bushels.
   Based on Nov. 1 surveys, the 7.59 billion bushels now forecast
would be the largest since 8.25 billion bushels in 1986. The record
was the 1985 crop of nearly 8.9 billion bushels.
   ``Harvest progressed rapidly in the 17 major producing states
during October and was 88 percent complete by Nov. 5, compared with
91 percent last year and the average of 78 percent,'' the
department's National Agricultural Statistics Service reported.
   Corn yields were estimated at 116.6 bushels per acre harvested,
up from 114.4 forecast in October and 84.6 bushels in 1988 but
still below the record of 119.4 bushels per acre in 1987.
   As livestock feed, corn is the largest and most important U.S.
farm crop. It is essential for the production of meat, poultry and
dairy products.
   Consumer food prices, which rose an average of 4.1 percent in
1988, are expected to go up about 6 percent this year, according to
USDA economists. The USDA has not issued its 1990 forecast, but
some analysts tentatively believe food prices won't match this
year's rise, the steepest since a 7.8 percent jump in 1981.
   Soybean production, a source of high-protein meal and vegetable
oil, was estimated at 1.94 billion bushels, up 25 percent from last
year's harvest of 1.54 billion bushels and 1 percent above the
October estimate of 1.93 billion bushels.
   The record soybean output was 2.26 billion bushels in 1979.
   Yields were estimated at an average of 32.8 bushels per acre
this year, compared with 26.9 bushels in 1988, the October forecast
of 32.6 bushels and a record 34.1 bushels per acre in 1985.
   The department's all-crops production index was reported at 104
percent of its 1977 average used for comparison. Last year,
reflecting the severe drought, the index plummeted to 89 percent.
The record reading was 117 percent set in 1981, 1982 and 1985.
   Cotton production was indicated at 12.1 million bales, down 21
percent from last year's output and 2 percent below the September
estimate of 12.3 million bales. The new estimate was up about 1
percent from October. The cotton record was 18.9 million bales in
1937.
   No new estimates of 1989 production of wheat and other crops
harvested earlier were included in the report.
   In a related report on supply and demand for major commodities,
analysts said total corn use in the 1989-90 marketing year that
began on Sept. 1 is expected to be about 7.625 billion bushels,
including domestic and export requirements, an increase from 7.5
billion forecast in October.
   With demand exceeding 1989 corn production, that will mean a
further drawdown of U.S. stockpiles to about 1.9 billion bushels
left over by next Sept. 1, down from inventories estimated at 1.93
billion bushels at the beginning of the marketing year.
   Still, that represents only a slight dip in the U.S. corn
stockpile, compared to last season's decline, when it plummeted
from 4.26 billion bushels on Sept. 1, 1988, to the 1.93 billion
bushels on hand this Sept. 1.
   Analysts said total corn use in the coming year will be boosted
by larger exports than had been anticipated, about 2.15 billion
bushels instead of the 2 billion that was forecast last month.
   Larger imports by the Soviet Union are expected to account for
much of the increase. According to the new estimate, Moscow will
import about 37 million tons of grain from all sources in 1989-90,
up three million tons from the October forecast but still short of
last year's 39 million tons.
   The report said U.S. corn prices may average in the range of $2
to $2.40 per bushel in the 1989-90 marketing year, down from $2.54
last season. The October forecast was $1.85 to $2.25 per bushel.
   Other 1989 crop estimates based on Oct. 1 indications, compared
with 1988 output, included:
   _Sorghum, 628.9 million bushels and an average yield of 59.8
bushels per acre, compared with 577.6 million and 63.8 in 1988.
   _Rice, 156.4 million hundredweight and a yield of 5,697 pounds
per acre, compared with 159.5 million and 5,511.
   _Peanuts, 4.13 billion pounds and a yield of 2,523 pounds per
acre, compared with 3.98 billion and 2,445.
   _Potatoes, total, 367.3 million hundredweight and a yield of 292
hundredweight per acre, compared with 356.4 million and 283.
   _Tobacco, 1.47 billion pounds and a yield of 2,105 pounds per
acre, compared with 1.37 billion and 2,160.
   _Sugarbeets, 26 million tons and a yield of 19.6 tons per acre,
compared with 24.8 million and 19.1.
   _Sugar cane, 30.4 million tons and a yield of 35.2 tons per
acre, compared with 29.9 million and 35.4.

<HEAD>New Debate Set For Bush's Capital Gains Tax Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents of a capital gains tax reduction say
new debate set in Congress is merely the ``death throes'' for the
year for President Bush's tax cut proposal.
   The House took the first step in the new round of debate
Thursday, repassing without debate or dissent the same capital
gains cut it had approved in September as part of a
deficit-reduction bill.
   But House and Senate leaders say the new debate will only put
the issue to rest for the year.
   ``This is just part of the death throes of capital gains,'' said
Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
   Only Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee, spoke on the bill Thursday. ``It removes this
issue as an impediment to moving forward on budget reconciliation
(deficit reduction) and other important matters,'' he said.
   Republicans will offer their own version of a capital gains cut
in the Senate and the issue will be debated for a day or two. There
likely will be two efforts to shut off debate on the bill. Although
Republicans say most senators favor a cut, it is generally agreed
backers will be unable to muster the 60 votes required to force a
final vote.
   If, as expected, the second vote to limit debate fails, capital
gains will be dead for the year. Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole
of Kansas told reporters he would not attempt to attach the
amendment to any other bill this year.
   Republicans agreed last week to stop trying to attach the
reduction to debt-ceiling and deficit-reduction legislation. But
they want to have next week's debate to keep the issue in the
public eye in hopes of building support.
   Asked what chance the bill has of becoming law this year,
Rostenkowski told reporters, ``None.''
   Republicans say a cut in the tax on capital gains, which are
profits from the sale of investments, would spur investment and
create jobs. Democrats call it a tax cut for the wealthy and cite
estimates that 80 percent of the benefit from a reduction would go
to those with incomes more than $200,000 a year.
   The cut approved by the House on Thursday would exclude from
taxation 30 percent of the gains on assets sold before Dec. 31,
1991. After that, only gains resulting solely from inflation would
be excluded.
   Present law fully taxes capital gains at the same rates applied
to wages and other income.
   The Senate Republican plan would allow an exclusion based on how
long an asset was held. If property was owned for more than a year,
5 percent of the profit would be excluded from tax. The excluded
portion would increase by 5 percentage points each year, up to a
maximum of seven years. Thus, 35 percent of the profit from the
sale of an asset owned more than seven years would escape taxation.

   Alzheimer's disease usually progresses in three
broad stages, according to the American Medical Association. Here
are typical symptoms, as described by the AMA and Dr. Bruce
Naughton of Northwestern University Medical School:
   _Forgetfulness, frequently going unnoticed but causing anxiety
or depression in the person affected.
   _Severe memory loss, with victims unable to remember recent
visitors or what they saw on television, though they can remember
long-ago events. Accompanying this stage may be a tendency to get
disoriented in time or space, to lose one's way or wander, and to
lose the capacity to care for themselves.
   Also apparent may be an exaggeration of existing personality
traits _ extreme anger if the person is normally hot-tempered,
extreme passivity if the person is normally placid; or an extreme
tendency to wander if the person is normally an ``on-the-go'' type.
   _Severe confusion and disorientation, with possible
hallucinations or delusions. The sufferer may forget to eat, may
lose control of bladder and bowel functions and may be bedridden
and prone to repeated infections.
   A person usually lives five to 10 years after developing
Alzheimer's disease, though the course of the uncurable illness may
run from one to 20 years, Naughton said.

   Old soldiers die, but they never
fade away at the old soldiers' home, where they celebrate Veterans
Day with memories of glory past and make no apologies for the place
they live.
   ``This is my home and I'm proud of it,'' says Lawson G. Taylor,
71, a two-year resident of the Barboursville Veterans Home. ``I won
$3 in bingo last night.''
   Barboursville is one of many such homes in West Virginia where
veterans, often rebuilding lives broken by injuries and rejection,
try to put things back together and relive tales of old battles.
   West Virginia sent more soldiers per capita to the Korean War
than any other state and the state's casualty rate in Vietnam was
the highest in the nation, 28.8 per 100,000 residents, according to
federal statistics.
   Some say the state's traditionally poor economy pushes more
soldiers to war; others attribute the figures to a fighting spirit
among people whose ancestors conquered rugged terrain and seceded
from Virginia during the Civil War.
   ``West Virginia is a very patriotic state,'' Secretary of State
Ken Hechler said. ``We have a lot of hunters who are very good in
the use of guns. A few of them join up because of the tough times
at home.''
   West Virginia officials say the state hasn't received a fair
return on its investment. While the state's residents paid $1.59
billion in federal taxes that went toward defense spending in 1987,
only $322 million in defense-related work was funneled back to the
state, according to a study by Employment Research Associates.
   ``West Virginia is first in war, first in peace and last in the
hearts of the Pentagon,'' Hechler said.
   But Barboursville residents say they aren't bitter, and draw
from a healthy reservoir of patriotism even when it isn't Veterans
Day, which will be observed on Saturday.
   ``If we ever have a war on our shores, the enemy will be in
trouble,'' said David Hall, a 41-year-old Vietnam veteran and
resident of the home. ``If they got as far as West Virginia, they
wouldn't get much farther.''
   ``War was just something that had to be done. We had a man who
told us what to do and we did it,'' said Taylor, a World War II
veteran. ``I've never talked to a West Virginian who came back and
said he was sorry he went.''
   About 115 veterans live in the Barboursville home, a former
state hospital that was renovated in 1975. The average stay is 16
months and residents double-, triple- or quadruple-up in cramped
quarters formerly used by mental patients.
   The library is stacked with American history books and
newspapers and the place is festooned with enough red, white and
blue to look like victory for an enterprising flagmaker. Thick
clouds of cigarette smoke seem to hang everywhere.
   There's little anger toward those who fled to Canada to avoid
the Vietnam draft and those who protested the war.
   ``My choice was to enlist and go to war,'' Hall said. ``Those
who left for other countries, they have to live with themselves.''
   But mention the flag _ and burning it _ and it sets off a
torrent of comment about ``kids'' who don't know enough to respect
it and the ideals it stands for.
   ``When you are in the services, when you see the flag go up the
pole you get a feeling in your body. Chills go up your spine. You
still get that feeling,'' said Jack Messenger, 58, a Korean War
veteran who said he got tired of living alone and moved into the
home a month ago.
   Stewart Breeding, 56, said most people learn about war through
pictures, movies and news accounts _ not by living through it.
   ``If he goes to a war zone and sees what we went through, he
wouldn't go do that,'' Breeding said of the flag burners.
   ``I don't believe in burning the flag, but I don't believe in
beating the stuff out of a man on the steps of the Capitol,'' Hall
said. ``I'd want to prevent a man from burning the flag and prevent
a man from getting beat up for burning it.''

<HEAD>Democrats Consider Five Cities For '92 Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five cities are making their pitches to host
the 1992 Democratic National Convention and party chairman Ron
Brown says the decision will be based on facilities, not electoral
politics.
   A selection committee of the Democratic National Committee was
finishing a two-day meeting today to hear formal presentations from
the five cities in the running.
   They are Cleveland, with its suburb of Brook Park, Ohio;
Detroit; Houston; New Orleans; and New York.
   The panel may pare the list to three or four and the members
will visit those finalists.
   But Brown said he would regard the committee's final choice only
as a recommendation and that he will make the final decision.
   ``I want a city that has facilities that will allow us to have a
first-class convention, that will be able to nominate the next
president of the United States,'' Brown said. ``It is principally
what kind of facilities, what kind of financial package, the local
support that we're going to have.
   ``There has been no decision made yet on where this convention
is going to be,'' Brown told the committee. ``It is truly an open
process.''
   Seattle, Miami and Atlanta have withdrawn their bids. Several
other major cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas
and Chicago, declined to make a bid.
   Most cited the requirement that the party have unlimited access
to the convention hall for three months before the convention as
the reason for withdrawing or not bidding. The party also said each
city would have to be prepared to invest $15 million.
   The Democrats met last year in Atlanta and the Republicans met
in New Orleans. Detroit was the site of the 1980 GOP convention,
and the Democrats met in New York in 1976 and 1980.
   Brown told reporters he didn't feel any need to look in one
particular region as a symbolic selection and didn't believe
selection of a city would make much difference in Democratic
chances of carrying that state or region in 1992.
   ``It certainly hasn't been the case in the past,'' he said. ``It
is not going to be a principal consideration in these
deliberations.''

<HEAD>House Overwhelmingly Passes Oil Spill Legislation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers expect President Bush to sign
legislation on oil spill liability that they hail as ``an
enormously significant environmental step forward'' from the days
before the Exxon Valdez disaster.
   The bill approved 375-5 by the House on Thursday gives ``the
strongest possible incentives for those who transport and produce
oil to take every precaution that is humanly possible to avoid a
spill,'' said Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass.
   ``We have every reason to expect this bill to be signed,'' he
said.
   Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, agreed the measure would be signed
after it goes through conference committee to work out differences
with the Senate version.
   Young called it a ``pretty good bill,'' but said it would need
``fine-tuning'' to ease restrictions on the oil industry.
   During two days of debate, the House loaded its bill with
amendments to strengthen its environmental language. The oil
industry strongly fought the additions, arguing lawmakers were
making oil hauling prohibitively expensive.
   Young led the effort Thursday to remove a provision added by
Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., to make simple negligence, instead of
gross negligence, the standard by which an oil company or carrier
would have to pay unlimited damages under federal law.
   ``With the defeat of the last Miller amendment, the president
will sign the bill,'' Young said. He said the amendment was ``an
attempt to embarrass the president'' because it would cause him to
veto a bill seen as the chief congressional response to the Exxon
Valdez spill.
   The tanker spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska's
Prince William Sound in the March accident, devastating miles of
scenic coastland.
   ``This is an enormously significant environmental step
forward,'' Studds said of the bill.
   ``It took, tragically, as in human nature is so often the case,
a disaster of the dimensions of Prince William Sound to provide the
public focus and spur the Congress ... to act far more quickly than
they have in previous years,'' he said.
   The most significant vote on the legislation was the approval
Wednesday of an amendment by Miller and Studds to allow states to
set stricter liability laws than the federal government. That
provision also is in the Senate version.
   Twenty-eight states have their own oil spill liability statutes,
and 19 of them require unlimited liability.
   A key provision approved Thursday would require all tankers that
come into U.S. ports to have double bottoms within seven years and
double hulls within 15 years of the bill's enactment.
   New tankers would have be built with double hulls and double
bottoms and those already in use would have to be refitted.
   ``When I see people like the builder of the Valdez, the company
that is repairing it, saying that there would have been
environmental protection, a 50 percent reduction in the loss of oil
if there had been a double bottom, I'm impressed,'' said Rep.
Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who wrote the language on double bottoms.
   The Senate narrowly defeated a similar provision.
   Young said he didn't think the Torricelli provision would
survive House-Senate negotiations in its present form, although he
thought the final version would call for some kind of improved
technology on ships.

<HEAD>Bishops Urge Palestinian Homeland, Approve AIDS Statement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's Roman Catholic bishops ended their
annual fall meeting by urging Israel to negotiate terms of an
independent Palestinian homeland, and rejecting condom education as
means of preventing AIDS.
   Over the objections of some American Jewish leaders, the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops unanimously approved
Thursday a policy statement on the Middle East that declares
Palestinians have a right to ``participate as equals'' in
negotiations affecting their destiny and the right to a homeland.
   ``The conclusion which follows from these assertions is as clear
as it has been controversial: Palestinian representation in Middle
East negotiations leading to Palestinian territorial and political
sovereignty,'' the bishops said.
   The policy statement on AIDS declared condom education
represents a ``quick-fix'' approach to the AIDS crisis that
promotes a false sense of security.
   ``You're dealing with a deadly, terminal illness. To suggest to
anyone to use a device ... that may not work is a very dangerous
admonition,'' said Archbishop Roger Mahony, chairman of the
committee that drafted the statement.
   Both the Middle East and condom education stands drew criticism.
   Rabbi A. James Rudin and Judith H. Banki of the American Jewish
Committee said the bishops' call for Palestinian sovereignty
``removes incentives for flexibility and accommodation on the part
of Palestinian leadership.''
   And Jay Blotcher, a spokesman for the AIDS Coalition to Unleash
Power, said not giving youngsters information about condoms is
``abandoning them to death.''
   The bishops' statement on Middle East affairs called on the
administration to increase talks with Palestinians; support a
Palestinian homeland; press Arab states to normalize relations with
Israel; and urge all foreign nations, including Syria and Israel,
to withdraw from Lebanon.
   The bishops also called upon the Arab states and Palestinians to
recognize Israel's right to exist, and said there must be
negotiated limits on Palestinian sovereignty to protect Israel's
security.
   Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston said the statement is a ``sorely
needed invitation to dialogue for the cause of peace in the Middle
East.''
   The wide-ranging AIDS statement opposes universal mandatory AIDS
testing, calls for increasing federal funds for AIDS research, and
denounces violence and discrimination against those suffering from
the fatal disease as immoral.
   ``The threat of AIDS is real and great. Precisely, though,
because of their terror, people act without reason,'' said
Archbishop John May of St. Louis, outgoing president of the
bishops' conference. ``Persons with AIDS are often shunned: They
lose their jobs, they can't rent homes, schools won't educate them,
insurance companies won't cover them.
   ``As moral leaders, we say that sort of discrimination is a
scandal and compassion is the only Gospel response.''
   The statement drops an assertion in a 1987 document that the
church could tolerate public school education on condoms as long as
sexual abstinence was taught as the ``only morally correct and
medically sure way'' to prevent AIDS.
   On condom education, the statement approved Thursday said: ``The
`safe-sex' approach to preventing HIV@AIDS, though frequently
advocated, compromises human sexuality and can lead to promiscuous
sexual behavior.''
   Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk of Cincinnati, the newly elected
conference president, said in an interview priests would still be
able to counsel condom use in individual cases if it seemed the
only recourse for an individual who would refuse to remain chaste.

   The nation's governors say they will seek help
from members of Congress and experts in the business and education
fields in keeping their promise to set up national education goals
by the end of February.
   Emerging from a White House meeting with Bush administration
officials Thursday, governors said they will also hold a Dec. 7
Task Force on Education meeting in Washington and are seeking state
hearings and discussions in December and January.
   ``We promised in Charlottesville to put this national education
goals on the front burner for the governors, on the front burner
for the White House, and we're keeping it on a very very fast
track,'' said Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, a Democrat.
   The drive for national goals came from the education summit
President Bush and the nation's governors held in late September at
the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.
   Clinton said the governors will seek the views of Congress and
other educational experts before recommending targets for the
nation's schools.
   ``Before the summit, we let the leadership of both parties of
Congress know that we needed their help and support and their
involvement in order to do anything meaningful to restructure the
schools and to get greater flexibility in the expending existing
federal programs,'' said Clinton.
   Congress and educators were excluded from the two-day summit
that concluded nationwide goals are needed to improve learning.
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell, a Republican, said
governors want to ``form a true coalition between the Congress, the
states and the executive branch of the White House in trying to
build a consensus to improve education in the country.''
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, chairman of the National Governors
Association and a Republican, said Congress will be asked to begin
immediately to work on legislation that would bring more
flexibility to regulations attached to many federal education
programs.
   Looser restrictions on federal funding was discussed at the
summit. Other summit goals were to improve early childhood
programs, restructure school systems to make educators more
accountable, keep drugs out of schools, bolster on-the-job
education, improve literacy and reduce the national dropout rate.
   Branstad led the group of governors who met at the White House
with chief of staff John Sununu; Roger Porter, the president's
domestic policy adviser; budget director Richard Darman; and
Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos.
   After the Dec. 7 Washington meeting of education experts, the
governors will hold state hearings and discussions in their
respective states in December and January, said NGA Vice Chairman
Booth Gardner of Washington state.
   Once the goals are adopted, said Campbell, governors will focus
on strategies for reaching them and ``tackling the rest of the
ambitious agenda we set at the summit.''
   ``Goals are the essential first step toward what the governors
are really after _ results in the classroom and in the workforce,''
said Campbell.

<HEAD>CDC to Survey AIDS Risk for Doctors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Centers for Disease Control wants to
undertake a major survey of the AIDS risk among surgeons as part of
its effort to determine the particular risks in health care
professions.
   ``It's very delicate,'' said Dr. David M. Bell of the CDC in
Atlanta, explaining negotiations with members of the surgical
profession. He said surgeons are concerned that patients, for
example, could demand the results of AIDS tests for all patients.
   He said the method of conducting the test is in place if the
agreement can be made.
   Bell mentioned the proposed study Thursday when asked to comment
on allegations made at a congressional hearing that government
health officials are grossly understating the possible risk of
contracting AIDS.
   Dr. Lorraine Day, chief of orthopedic surgery at San Francisco
General Hospital, said the government fears health care workers
will deny treatment to HIV-infected patients if all the risks are
known.
   She told the House Education and Labor subcommittee on health
and safety that CDC and others have been off the mark in their
assessment of the AIDS risk. She said the same argument used now
that AIDS is not transmitted by saliva was used in 1983 to rule out
transmission of the virus by blood transfusions, and the number of
documented cases in each instance was the same: five.
   ``There are more things we need to do,'' Bell acknowledged, but
said there are ``huge masses of data indicating what the risks
are.''
   He said health care professional need to ensure that instruments
and techniques are not ``inherently hazardous.''
   Three surgeons in the last 10 years who engaged in none of the
high-risk behavior associated with AIDS have contracted the
disease, he said. ``We have the feeling that while its true that
these are cases of AIDS and not HIV infection, we have the feeling
that after 10 years we would see more than three surgeons. It's a
feeling,'' he said.
   The subcommittee is conducting hearings on proposed federal
regulations to limit the spread of blood-borne pathogens such as
the AIDS and hepatitis B viruses.
   Day said the same reluctance to look at possible AIDS infection
through contact with unbroken skin and saliva is cheating the
public of important knowledge.
   The government says AIDS is spread through sexual contact,
needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood
products and from infected pregnant women to their offspring.
   Day said the growing risk of AIDS cases prompted her to resign
effective Feb. 1, 1990, from the hospital. The hospital has San
Francisco's only trauma center and is one of the foremost AIDS
research centers in the country.
   ``I personally know 13 surgeons who are HIV positive from
occupational exposure,'' she said, adding patients have a right to
know if their physicians are infected.
   Bell said as for possible transmission of AIDS through contact
with unbroken skin, ``We just don't see that.''
   He said there is nothing to suggest that transmission through
the high-speed tools used in an operating room is a risk.
   One study cited by Day showed that the AIDS virus lived seven
days outside the body. But Bell said that involved higher
concentrations than in any operating room or the ``worst AIDS
patient.''

   Gov. Michael Dukakis quashed rumors that he might
resign to spend more time with his wife, Kitty, as she prepared to
leave the hospital where she has been recovering after drinking
rubbing alcohol.
   Mrs. Dukakis' family said she may leave the Brigham and Women's
Hospital today, four days after she drank the poisonous fluid.
   Dukakis issued his first public statement about his wife
Thursday after spending two days at her bedside. He vowed to stand
by her and to serve out the remaining 14 months of his term.
   ``We have a tremendous amount of work to do here,'' Dukakis said.
   He said he had faith in his wife's ability to rebound: ``I love
Kitty. I'm going to stand by her, just as she's always stood by me.
We're in this thing together.''
   Dukakis also alluded to the strain of the past year, beginning
with his defeat to George Bush in the presidential race last Nov. 8.
   ``This has been a very difficult week for Kitty and for me and
for our family. And it's been a difficult year,'' he said. ``Many
families have troubles like this ... You do your very best to deal
with it _ and then you go on.''
   Mrs. Dukakis was treated for alcoholism in February and
previously has admitted to a long period of abusing diet pills.
   Some alcohol and drug abuse experts around the country said it
was not uncommon for recovering alcoholics to reach for anything
containing alcohol if they suddenly get a craving. One specialist
said it did not sound like a suicidal gesture.
   ``Sometimes people will drink any alcohol when they're craving
the drink,'' said Dominic Ciraulo, a senior consultant in substance
abuse at New England Medical Center in Boston. ``Sometimes the
craving for alcohol becomes so intense that they ignore the risks.''
   Markku Linnoila, clinical director of the National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in Bethesda, Md., said he could not
comment directly on the Dukakis case but in such a situation ``it
certainly looks like a fairly desperate individual doing something
out of the ordinary.''
   Mrs. Dukakis was taken to the hospital by ambulance Monday night
after experiencing ``severe reaction'' to drinking rubbing alcohol,
said Dr. Gerald Plotkin, the Dukakis family physician.
   Mrs. Dukakis was said to be suffering from depression and
exhaustion stemming from a busy schedule of speaking engagements
and work on her upcoming book. She recently returned from a trip to
Colorado where she participated in an Outward Bound program.

   The adoration for Philippine President Corazon
Aquino is perhaps somewhat diminished from three years ago when she
received the most thunderous reception Congress ever gave a foreign
leader.
   Mrs. Aquino's return visit this week is far more low-key than it
was then, a time when she was still able to coast on her image as
symbol of modest righteousness, triumphant over the corruption and
extravagance of the Marcos era.
   It was a time when U.S. lawmakers were so taken with Aquino's
eloquence in an appearance before Congress that they quickly
lavished $200 million in extra aid on the Philippines, prompting
Capitol Hill wags to call it the largest honorarium in American
history.
   The affection for Mrs. Aquino was _ and still is _ genuine but,
as any diplomat knows, relations among sovereign states are based
not on heartfelt sentimentality but compelling national interests.
   The issue now for Americans and Filipinos is not so much whether
democracy can survive _ the communist insurgency seems less
menacing than before _ but rather what kind of relationship the two
countries should have.
   Can the U.S. bases in the Philippines survive the growing
nationalism among Filipinos? Does the Pentagon need all those
military facilities now that so many people are saying the Cold War
is over?
   Does a large U.S. aid program enable the Philippines to defer
badly needed but politically painful reforms? Should aid be
replaced by trade or is a combination of both the best approach?
   Mrs. Aquino seems sensitive to the notion that there are limits
to U.S. aid levels, and her visit here emphasizes trade and
investment instead. The military base question was not even on her
agenda with President Bush although she was meeting this afternoon
with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   It's hard to overestimate the difficulties she faces back home.
She presides over a country where 40 percent live below the poverty
line, where the per capita income of $700 a year is less than a
quarter of South Korea's and where servicing of the nation's $28
billion foreign debt is a continuing drain on cash assets,
exceeding foreign aid from all sources combined.
   But it's the base issue that is expected to dominate
U.S.-Filipino relations between now and September 1991 when the
U.S. leases on Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base expire.
Preliminary talks start next month.
   Discussions last year over base compensation for the Filipinos
generated considerable acrimony, with the two sides arguing
bitterly not only over aid levels but also over who gets the most
benefit from the U.S. military presence, which includes 36,000
Americans and their dependents.
   The installations provide 68,000 jobs to the local economy but a
significant minority of Filipinos look on the U.S. presence as an
infringement on national sovereignty.
   Sensing that the welcome mat may be withdrawn, U.S. officials
have begun speculating publicly about transferring the facilities
elsewhere in the Pacific, mentioning such locations as Australia
and Palau.
   But Bush expressed confidence on Thursday that the two sides
will reach an agreement that will prolong the U.S. military
presence in the Philippines.
   Mrs. Aquino didn't mention the subject in her arrival statement
and brushed aside a reporter's question about it. Unlike three
years ago, she's been playing hard to get.
   The base problem hangs over the relationship much like the gray
cloud that sprinkled rain on Bush and Mrs. Aquino Thursday morning
as they stood on the White House south lawn.
   Still, Bush was able to put things in perspective. Recalling the
halcyon days of 1986, Bush said:
   ``From Main Street to Wall Street, America loves the
Philippines. And America loves Cory Aquino.''

<HEAD>White House Issues Last-Minute Invitation for Bush-Shamir Meeting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush will be meeting with Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir next week, after all.
   The invitation for next Wednesday's meeting was issued Thursday
_ almost two months after Israel first sought it while making
arrangements for Shamir's visit to address Jewish groups in
Cincinnati and Los Angeles.
   Shamir arrives in New York on Monday and his aides had been
holding his schedule open in hopes that Bush would invite him to
meet with him.
   Israeli officials were upset and mystified by the U.S. delay,
believing that Israel had appeased U.S. requirements by adopting
Secretary of State James A. Baker III's proposal to begin making
arrangements for Palestinian elections in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   But Baker, speaking to reporters aboard a plane whic brought him
Wednesday from Australia, said he had made clear to Israel that he
rejected the assurances it sought regarding the talks with a
Palestinian delegation.
   ``It's all very curious. Did the Israelis misunderstand or is
Baker trying to send some sort of signal?'' said one State
Department official.
   A White House statement on next Wednesday's meeting said Bush
wanted to talk with Shamir about steps to advance the Middle East
peace process.
   Israel gave its qualified approval to Baker's blueprint on
Sunday but asked for his assurances on several matters, including
the exclusion of the Palestine Liberation Organization from any
talks.
   The State Department said Thursday that another in a series of
meetings between U.S. Embassy officials and PLO representatives was
held in Tunis on Tuesday to discuss the election proposal. It did
not elaborate.
   The United States is still awaiting word from Egypt, which has
also been speaking for the PLO, on whether the Baker plan has been
accepted.
   The plan calls for elections to pick Palestinian delegates who
would negotiate with Israeli authorities for self-government in the
West Bank and Gaza.
   The crux of the problem concerns the makeup of the Palestinian
delegation that will discuss the election procedures with Israel, a
U.S. official said Thursday.
   To win the PLO's backing for the plan, Baker has proposed that
some of the delegates be Palestinians living in exile. But Israel,
fearing that any exiled Palestinian would be a de facto PLO member,
is insisting that only Palestinians from the territories be
permitted to take part.
   Two weeks ago presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said a
Bush-Shamir meeting was likely. But later in the day, his office
issued a terse statement saying no decision had been made on such a
meeting and that Shamir would be here on a private visit.
   Bush, asked at a news conference earlier this week whether he
would meet with Shamir, said he would be willing to consider such a
meeting as long as the two sides have ``something positive to talk
about.''
   It would have been highly unusual for an American president to
refuse to meet with an Israeli leader. Israel is the largest
recipient of U.S. aid, getting $3 billion each year, and is one of
Washington's top allies.

   It was, quite simply, the biggest party that
fun-loving Berliners ever had.
   Hours after East Germany opened the wall it built in 1961 to
keep the two Berlins apart, thousands of East and West Berliners
reunited in an outpouring of joy that lasted well into this morning.
   Hordes of East Berliners poured across the Berlin Wall, crossing
in their tiny Trabant cars, on foot, or on packed subways.
   ``Madness! Madness!'' cried a 44-year-old East Berlin woman who
gave her name as Inge. ``To think that I'm seeing all this after 28
years.''
   She and her husband Werner were already in their nightclothes
when they heard the border was open.
   ``We were up and dressed with our son in a second,'' her husband
said. ``But even we couldn't get across in the car, there were so
many people. So we just left it there and pushed our way across.''
   At the Invalidenstrasse crossing to East Berlin, police appealed
frantically to the crowd to clear the path for hundreds of East
Berliners crossing to raucous cheers from the Westerers.
   ``This is a historic day, and because it is such a historic
moment we ask you to keep the crossing clear,'' a policeman
repeatedly told the crowd.
   Few listened.
   ``We were here when the Wall went up in 1961,'' beamed West
Berliner Helga Zuballa, 53. ``We're so happy. If it keeps on like
this, we'll have nothing left to wish for.''
   Champagne corks popped, and some West Berlin bars _ the only
ones in Germany which never close _ offered free beer to the
arriving hordes of East Berliners. Other West Germans offered money
to the newcomers.
   West Berlin authorities ordered city subways to run all night to
cope with the unprecedented mass of people moving around in the
city.
   ``I promised him I'd take him across if they opened up the
border,'' said Uwe Scheiderat as he and his 17-year-old son, Erich,
gazed in wonder at the electronics on show in a display window on
the Kurfuerstendamm, one of Europe's most elegant shopping streets.
   Hundreds of West Berliners took a journey themselves, heading in
the opposite direction to catch a glimpse of the East.
   ``For the first time in my life, I had tears in my eyes when I
listened to the TV news,'' said Peter Huber, one of thousands of
West Berliners who flooded toward the Invalidenstrasse crossing.
   ``What joy! This is the best thing that happened in 100 years!''
yelled another West Berlin man.
   ``It's crazy! It's crazy!'' shouted a young man from the back
seat of a car.
   In the delirium, few seemed to notice that East German radio had
announced visa-free entrances would stop this morning.
   In East Berlin, however, hundreds of people jammed the House of
Travel on the Alexanderplatz, already lining up for visas that
would allow them to cross today.

<TEXT>
   The United Mine Workers and the Pittston
Co. will begin intensive bargaining next week in an effort to
resolve the 7-month-old strike against the coal company, the
government's supermediator says.
   ``I'm absolutely convinced that both sides want a contract,''
mediator W.J. Usery said Thursday after he hosted the first
face-to-face negotiating session involving UMW President Richard
Trumka and Pittston Chairman Paul Douglas.
   Usery and other participants said the 75-minute session was
largely spent setting ground rules for the negotiations but
included a brief discussion of the broad issues in the strike,
which has idled 1,700 miners in Virginia, West Virginia and
Kentucky since April.
   ``We weren't dealing with substance,'' said Trumka.
   Among the rules, said Usery, was an agreement that specifics of
the negotiations to begin Monday will not be disclosed to the media.
   ``We don't want to mediate in the press,'' the former labor
secretary and veteran mediator told reporters. Usery said
negotiations would go on ``day and night if necessary'' and he held
out hope the bitter and sometimes violent strike could be over by
Thanksgiving.
   The biggest issue in the dispute is over Pittston's payments of
health and retirement benefits, a fight whose outcome could have
far-reaching effects in the coal industry.
   The company withdrew from a national compact among coal
producers that guarantees retired miners health and pension
benefits. The union believes that if Pittston is successful in
trimming those benefits, other companies will attempt to do so.
   Usery said he did not ask Trumka and Douglas to attend Monday's
session and would not request their presence unless he believed an
agreement was within reach.
   Douglas pledged his support for the mediation, saying he would
do ``whatever I can do to help with the process.'' He also praised
for Usery, saying he was ``very impressed'' with the man Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole tapped two weeks ago in hopes of resolving
the strike.
   Trumka said, ``If anyone can get this job done I think Bill
Usery can.''

   The National Liar's Hall of Fame cited The
Des Moines Register as teller of 1989's tallest tale in a story of
a drought-stricken corn farmer who gave new meaning to the phrase
``knee-high by the Fourth of July.''
   The newspaper deserved the top award for its report on an Iowa
farmer who ``was doubly proud last summer when his corn was
knee-high twice before the Fourth _ once on the way up, once on the
way down,'' Hall officials said Thursday.
   The hall of fame ceremony in Dannebrog was billed as the 65th
annual awards banquet, although sponsors admitted they might be
lying.
   Bill Orr, husband of Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, won the Mendacity
Diplomacy Award when he notified hall officials he would be unable
to attend next year's dinner because, ``I have an important funeral
to attend that day.''
   Last year, politicians were banned from the competition because
the winners must be amateurs, said Roger Welsch, the hall of fame's
founder and director.
   This central Nebraska town, population 356, welcomed celebrities
in black shirts and white ties to the Dannebrog Convention Center,
Welsch claimed.
   ``The gala day began with the first ever Formula One Grand Prix
Race in the streets of Dannebrog, with the favorites _ Andretti,
Unser and Sullivan _ finishing first, second and third,'' he said.
   ``Fred Andretti expressed his appreciation and said it was worth
driving over from Grand Island for the event, but he had expected
something more than $5 off a bearing pack over at Mel's Sinclair
and a warm six-pack of Mountain Dew,'' Welsch said.
   He said Gaylord Unser and Lumir Sullivan filed protests with
race officials because Andretti repeatedly rolled through stop
signs in downtown Dannebrog.
   Jim Knapp, a Kearney attorney, won the Karma Award for his
naming of three things necessary to become a successful trial
lawyer _ ``sincerity, sincerity, sincerity.'' He said once you
learn how to fake it, you can get away with almost anything.

   The flight of tens of thousands to the West and
the stunning growth of a popular revolt has overwhelmed East
Germany's Communist leadership and forced reforms at a breathtaking
pace.
   The tempo of change has been much faster in East Germany than in
the Soviet Union, Poland or Hungary. Events have spun out of
control since East Germany, the Communist child of the Cold War,
celebrated its 40th birthday just a month ago with 77-year-old
leader Erich Honecker heading the celebration.
   But the party was spoiled by images of East Germans fleeing to
the West, through Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland. Now Honecker
_ builder of the Berlin Wall in 1961 _ is gone, along with most of
his aging comrades.
   What was left of the Communist Party Politburo resigned en masse
on Wednesday, and the new leader, Egon Krenz, tried to put together
a leadership that could retain the political supremacy of a
discredited party.
   He promised free elections, and then on Thursday Politburo
member Guenter Schabowski announced the opening of his country's
borders, unleasing the once unthinkable flight of thousands through
crossings in the Berlin Wall.
   As Mikhail S. Gorbachev decreed reform in the Soviet Union, he
also set loose reform movements across the Soviet bloc. At home, he
allowed freer elections, a more open press and formation of
legislative bodies that partly reflected popular will.
   In a decade of struggle, Poland managed to come to terms with an
opposition that rallied around Solidarity to form the East bloc's
first non-Communist government. Hungary moved slowly but surely
toward demoractic reform.
   East Germany seemed firmly embedded in the old ways, its
leadership wary of change.
   Then, East Germans started leaving, in a swelling flood that has
reached nearly 200,000 people.
   Even worse for the East German leadership, they were leaving
through friendly countries _ Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia _
especially after Hungary began dismantling fortifications along its
border with Austria May 2.
   No other East European state has undergone such staggering mass
departures. The exodus caught the East German leadership by
surprise.
   Honecker, reportedly ailing and probably not in full control
during those crucial summer weeks, then compounded the problem by
mishandling the exit of East German refugees from the West German
embassy in Prague.
   On the night of Oct. 3-4, thousands of East Germans stormed
Dresden station trying to get on the special trains taking the
Prague refugees west on a bizarre journey back through their
Communist homeland.
   Riot police beat back the crowds, and battled others on the
streets of East Berlin days later when they tried to march for
reform during the 40th birthday celebrations.
   The next day, anger at the police and a mixture of shock and
hopelessness caused 100,000 people to take over the streets of
Leipzig to demand free elections.
   ``I'm leaving because of what I saw on the night of Oct. 3-4,''
said a Leipzig worker caught in the Dresden station battle by
chance.
   Another factor in the swiftness of the revolt in East Germany
was that the government didn't seem to know what to do. It could
not stop the protests or the flight of East Germans, and could not
prevent Hungary and Czechoslovakia from letting East Germans cross
the borders.
   At the Czechoslovak-West German border this week, not every East
German was fleeing. Some had simply driven friends to the threshold
of freedom before returning home.
   ``Got to go back and keep on demonstrating,'' smiled a man in
his early 40s from Erfurt, clenching a fist in the air.

<HEAD>Congress Sending New Military Aid to War-Torn El Salvador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With violence escalating in El Salvador,
congressional negotiators on a $14.4 billion foreign aid bill are
providing up to $85 million in military aid to the country's new
rightist government.
   The House and Senate conferees, who completed work on the
measure late Thursday, also agreed to $12 million for police
training to the government of President Alfredo Cristiani.
   But the police training aid was included only after lawmakers
added a requirement that President Bush report to Congress on the
investigation into the deadly Oct. 31 bombing of the headquarters
of a leading anti-government union.
   Cristiani, of the right-wing Arena party, took office in June.
Talks he initiated with the leftist FMLN guerillas fighting his
government failed and violence on both sides of the 10-year-old
civil war has escalated in recent weeks.
   Final agreement on the overall aid package by the conferees sent
it back to the House and Senate floors for final approval.
   The agreement also increased the likelihood legislation carrying
substantial aid for Poland's new Solidarity-led government could be
approved in time for next week's scheduled speech to Congress by
party leader Lech Walesa.
   The bill includes $533 million in aid to Poland and Hungary, two
Eastern European countries that have been on the leading edge of
political and economic reform in the Warsaw Pact.
   It also included $15 million in aid to the United Nations
Population Fund, which would reverse a five-year policy of not
funding agencies that carry on programs in China, which has a
policy that leads to forced abortions and sterilizations.
   President Bush has vowed to veto the bill if it includes that
provision, but it was considered likely to be removed when the
measure goes back to the House.
   The bill also contained another veto target, a provision barring
the United States from using foreign aid money to entice any
foreign government to carry out any policy that would violate U.S.
law. The provision grew out of the Iran-Contra affair, when
Honduras was rewarded with expedited aid for its support of the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   In other provisions, the bill:
   _Extended authority of the Export-Import Bank to subsidize sales
of U.S.-made defense items to Turkey and Greece. The provision,
pushed by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., was designed to
facilitate a sale of Sikorsky helicopters to Turkey. Overall Ex-Im
funding was pegged at $615 million.
   _Earmarked $35 million for the American Schools and Hospitals
Abroad program, the same as last year. The program has come under
fire as a ``foreign aid pork barrel'' that funds pet projects
overseas of members of Congress.
   _Set aside $20 million in economic aid and $43 million in
military aid for Morocco, which lobbies on Capitol Hill, but killed
similar aid for Tunisia, Portugal, Malawi and Central America.
   _Provided $50 million as the U.S. contribution to the World
Bank, but effectively froze the money until Congress is satisfied
that U.S. commercial banks have made adequate concessions to write
down third-world loans.
   _Redistributed the 23,000 metric ton sugar sales quota forfeited
by Panama under U.S. sanctions to Caribbean nations and Bolivia.
   The measure included $4.7 billion overall in military aid and
$3.2 billion in economic aid. The largest recipients of U.S.
largesse are Israel and Egypt, which receive money as rewards for
participating in the Camp David Middle East peace process.

<HEAD>Oscar Trophy Has No Copyright</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Oscar statuette, one of the most
recognizable images in the entertainment world, has no copyright
protection, a federal judge has ruled.
   The small Academy Award statue is part of the public domain,
U.S. District Court Judge Laughlin Waters said in a ruling released
Thursday.
   The decision was a setback for the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences, which had sued a Chicago-based manufacturer of
an employee-incentive trophy similar to the Oscar.
   Academy President Karl Malden said the ruling ``comes as a shock
to me.'' The academy said it would appeal.
   The academy claimed that the Star Award, the trophy look-alike
made by Creative House Promotions, violated copyright laws, diluted
the academy's trademark and represented unfair competition.
   The Star Award depicted a naked, muscular male much like the
Oscar, just two inches shorter and holding a star instead of a
sword. It had a gold finish similar to the Oscar, and stood on a
circular gold cap mounted on a cylindrical base.
   Although Waters acknowledged that the Creative House trophy is
``very similar'' to the Oscar, he rejected all of the academy's
legal claims, saying that the statuette became part of the public
domain prior to Jan. 1, 1978, the effective date of the Copyright
Act of 1976.
   The film industry's top award was distributed from the first
ceremony in 1929 until about 1941 without the ``c'' mark indicating
a copyright.
   The judge ruled, too, that the Oscar not only was an honorary
award but also was used to promote the film industry, and therefore
did not have a ``limited purpose,'' as required by the copyright
act.
   The academy noted that the ruling applied only to the statuette
and that the academy's trademark and service marks for the Oscar
and the Academy Award names and symbols are unaffected.
   ``We are surprised that the court would base its decision on
events which occurred half a century ago, overlooking the
meticulous fashion in which the Academy has protected the integrity
of its institutional symbol for decades,'' Malden said in a
statement.

   Lawmakers are complaining that the
House-approved $305 billion defense bill is a weak response to
major political changes worldwide and amounts to nothing more than
a jobs program.
   ``The Warsaw Pact is crumbling before our eyes and we're
building weapons of destruction,'' said Rep. Ronald Dellums,
D-Calif., a member of the House Armed Services Committee and a
longtime opponent of military buildup.
   Although both proponents and opponents criticized the defense
bill _ a compromise package worked out by House and Senate
conferees after nearly two months of contentious negotiations _ the
House on Thursday adopted the legislation, 236-172.
   The bill, which goes to the Senate, slashes $1.1 billion from
President Bush's request for the Strategic Defense Initiative but
provides much of the money for two land-based nuclear missiles and
the B-2 stealth bomber.
   The legislation also continues two programs Bush sought to kill
_ the Navy's F-14D Tomcat jet fighter and the AHIP helicopter _ for
one more year, and postpones a decision on the Marine Corps' V-22
Osprey and the Phoenix missile.
   The Osprey, the tilt-rotor aircraft that takes off like a
helicopter but can fly like a plane, will receive about $255
million in research and development money in fiscal 1990 but no
funds for procurement.
   The legislation includes money for 18 F-14D jet fighters but
requires the manufacturer, Grumman Corp., to sign a termination
agreement ending all future production.
   Salvaging weapons programs _ and jobs in many districts _ drew
the ire of a number of lawmakers.
   ``The defense pork bill passed the Congress today. Congress made
no hard choices,'' said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, a member of the
House Armed Services Committee. ``The relationship between national
security and the defense authorization bill is just about
coincidental.''
   The complaints came as East Germany opened the Berlin Wall and
its other borders Thursday and allowed citizens to cross freely to
the West for the first time in 28 years.
   ``Peace is breaking out and we're going to have four legs of the
triad instead of three,'' said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a
member of the Armed Services panel.
   Another committee member, Rep. Larry Hopkins, R-Ky., said, ``The
winds of change are sweeping across every part of our world. We
have an opportunity to set a course to take this nation forward.''
   Instead, Hopkins said, Congress was ``corrupted by parochial
avarice.''
   The defense budget, according to Dellums, ``continues to pursue
the same tired old path of no change, military expansion, more and
more brand-new conventional and nuclear weapons systems at a time
when the world is crying out for change and the world is crying out
for peace.''
   Among the legislation's provisions are $4.3 billion for the B-2,
$430 million less than the administration requested for the fiscal
year that began Oct. 1. The bill provides money for two bombers in
fiscal 1990, one less than the administration sought. However, the
legislation accepts Bush's proposal for components for five bombers
in fiscal 1991.
   The bill provides $3.8 billion for SDI _ also known as Star Wars
_ about $279 million less than was spent in fiscal 1989 and the
first decrease since President Reagan proposed the anti-missile
shield six years ago. Bush had sought $4.9 billion for the program.
   Approximately $1.1 billion is included for two land-based
nuclear missiles: the multiple-warhead, rail-garrison MX and the
single-warhead, truck-based Midgetman. The bill trims about $150
million from the administration's request for the two weapons and
adds House language imposing a 50-missile cap on the MX.
   Also Thursday, House and Senate negotiators reached agreement on
a $288 billion military spending bill for fiscal 1990 that largely
tracks the defense authorization bill on the major strategic
weapons, said lawmakers and congressional sources, who requested
anonymity.

<HEAD>Sharp Rise in Gonorrhea Could Signal Return to Unsafe Sex, Feds Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An outbreak of gonorrhea among homosexual men in
Seattle could signal a ``risky relapse'' from AIDS-prompted ``safe
sex'' practices among homosexual men, health officials warned.
   Researchers with the national Centers for Disease Control said
Thursday that a study reported 79 gonorrhea cases in the first 10
months of this year at a public health clinic in Seattle. If the
rate continued, the clinic would report about 100 cases this year,
compared with 27 last year.
   The surprising increase follows a 96 percent decline in
gonorrhea cases at the clinic over the previous six years.
   Widespread publicity about the spread of the deadly disease
among homosexuals has led to changes over the last decade in the
sexual practices of many homosexual men who previously may have had
many partners. Gonorrhea, like AIDS, is sexually transmitted.
   The latest increase might be an isolated occurrence among
homosexuals who have continued to practice unsafe sex, the CDC said
in its weekly report. But the outbreak could mean that, eight years
after the discovery of AIDS, ``some homosexually active men may
have relaxed behaviors regarding sexual safety.''
   ``These really profound changes _ celibacy, monogamy _ may be
remarkably difficult, more difficult to maintain as time passes,''
said William Whittington, a CDC specialist in sexually transmitted
diseases. ``If this is indeed true, we in this business may need to
look at things we can try to help people sustain these kinds of
changes over time.''
   The notion of a ``risky sexual relapse'' was put forth in June
at an AIDS conference in Montreal, as researchers said they had
seen signs of riskier sexual behavior among homosexuals in San
Francisco.
   The new findings came from the Seattle-King County Department of
Public Health STD clinic, where patients are classified on the
basis of sexual orientation.
   The decade-long decline of gonorrhea in homosexual and bisexual
men has been attributed to concern over the spread of AIDS, which
was first reported in 1981.
   About 589,000 gonorrhea cases have been reported nationwide thus
far this year, down from an average of 713,000 at this point in the
five preceding years.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys the
body's defenses against disease, exposing the victim to
life-threatening infections and cancers.
   The virus that causes the incurable and fatal disease is
believed to be passed mainly through sexual intercourse, shared
hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to their infants
before or during birth.

<HEAD>Dollar In Tight Range Against Yen</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The dollar remained in a tight range against the
Japanese yen today while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
gained slightly.
   The dollar closed at 142.75 yen, up 0.05 yen from Thursday's
close of 142.70 yen. After opening at 142.98 yen, the currency
ranged between 142.60 yen and 143.00 yen.
   A dealer with Mitsui Bank said a rumor in the morning that
Japan's central bank would raise its official discount rate caused
dollar-selling pressure briefly, but the currency then recovered
slightly before being sold by investment trust banks. Later, the
rumor was found to be groundless.
   ``As a whole, the dollar remained directionless in a narrow
range,'' said the dealer, who spoke anonymously.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, a 61.83-point gainer the previous day, added 5.78 points,
or 0.016 percent, closing the week at 35,663.20.
   Volume on the first section was a heavy 1.1 billion shares,
compared with 800 million shares traded Thursday.
   The market's main barometer slowed its advance as some
participants took a cautious attitude because of uncertainties over
Japanese and American monetary policies, securities dealers said.

   Navy pilots accidentally dropped hundreds of
bombs for years outside a military bombing range in central Nevada,
and state officials are angry they never were told about it.
   Navy officials, in a sweep that began Oct. 30 and should be
completed by mid-November, have found some bombs on public lands
used by hunters, hikers and off-road-vehicle enthusiasts.
   The Navy has recovered up to 2,000 live and dead bombs dropped
outside the 22,000-acre bombing range at Fallon Naval Air Station.
   ``I'm just appalled this has occurred,'' Gov. Bob Miller said
Thursday.
   He called it the latest in a ``string of broken promises from
the Navy.''
   ``There is absolutely no reason why we cannot expect them to
stay within the boundaries that were given them,'' Miller said.
   Miller ordered the closure of state Route 839, an 18-mile road
that parallels Navy bombing areas starting 60 miles east of Reno.
   He also said the Bureau of Land Management agreed to his request
to close 35,000 acres of public land surrounding the ranges until
the Navy completes its cleanup.
   Citizen Alert called for an indefinite halt to bombing at Fallon
pending an investigation into why the bombs were allowed to fall
outside the 22,000-acre range for years without public knowlege.
   ``This is something they should have notified the public about a
long time ago,'' said Bob Fulkerson, executive director of the
Reno-based environmental group.
   Capt. Rex Rackowitz, Fallon's commanding officer, said the
search and cleanup operation, code-named Operation Ugly Baby, is a
routine exercise to ensure people's safety. The public wasn't
informed of the effort to keep away onlookers, he said.
   Some of the ordnance is so dangerous is must be detonated on
site.
   Some explosives were found a mile or so outside the military
ranges and some appeared to have been there for up to 30 years,
``and the Navy has done nothing in that time,'' the governor said.
   Miller told military officials he was concerned some people
might take live ammunition on public lands as souvenirs.
   U.S. Sens. Harry Reid and Richard Bryan, both D-Nev., have
written Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett demanding full
disclosure about where the bombs are and why they were allowed to
sit for years.
   Base spokeswoman Susan Reinhardt said information about the
search by the Navy's Explosive Ordnance Disposal detachment was
released after Reno television station KTVN reported the sweep.
   Fallon Mayor Robert Erickson said the Navy ``has always been a
good neighbor'' and he's glad to see the recovery effort.
   ``Most of the bombs are in remote areas and I'm glad to see the
Navy identify a problem and take care of it,'' he said.
   Rackowitz said the current cleanup involves helicopters and
ground crews patrolling areas just outside the Navy's Bravo 17
range. The Navy plans another routine search for loose ordnance
next spring near the Bravo 16 and Bravo 19 ranges, he added.
   No accidents have been reported from people finding bombs.
   Rackowitz said the bombs were dropped outside the ranges because
of system malfunctions or by training pilots who made mistakes.

<HEAD>Game Show Host Off Presidential Ballot in Brazil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A popular TV game show host who appeared
tied for the lead in Brazil's presidential race lost his chance
when an electoral court ruled he violated election guidelines and
could not be on the ballot.
   The decision Thursday by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal ended
the nine-day candidacy of Silvio Santos, whose late entry into the
race rocked Brazil's first free presidential vote since 1960.
   It came the same day a Gallup poll was published showing Santos
virtually tied for the lead with center-rightist candidate Fernando
Collor de Mello. The poll showed Santos had 21.6 percent of the
vote.
   News reports speculated that President Jose Sarney engineered
Santos' entry into the race to undermine Collor de Mello, who has
tried to distance himself from the highly unpopular government and
create an image as a fighter of corruption.
   Sarney, who is not a candidate in the Wednesday's election,
denied it.
   All seven members of the electoral court ruled Santos was
ineligible to run because he violated a 1970 election law requiring
each candidate to leave the directorship of a government-licensed
business _ such as TV stations and networks _ three months before
the election.
   Santos' lawyers contended he merely owned controlling stock in
the SBT television network. But the court decided Santos actively
ran the nation's second-largest network.
   The court also unanimously ruled Santos' tiny Municipalist Party
did not fulfill election registration guidelines requiring at least
nine state conventions, and declared the tiny party defunct.
   Santos can appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, said the
court president, Jose Francisco Rezek.
   Santos, 58, refused comment on the ruling Thursday night.
   ``Mr. Santos told me to tell all of you reporters that he had a
headache and went to bed,'' said his maid, Narilia Lopes.
   The TV entertainer, who is popular among Brazil's poor, had been
widely criticized by other presidential candidates since he
declared his candidacy.
   Santos, born Senor Abravanel of Greek immigrant parents, rose
from selling wallets on streetcorners 35 years ago to become a
multimillionaire executive and owner of more than 30 businesses.
   Most candidates welcomed the court's decision.
   ``Santos' campaign was doomed from the start,'' said Luis Inacio
Lula da Silva of the Marxist-oriented Workers' Party.
   ``Now the campaign can get back to normal,'' said Sen. Mario
Covas of the left-of-center Brazilian Social Democracy Party. ``Now
all of those votes will come back to the true candidates of the
campaign.''
   Leonel Brizola, of the left-of-center Democratic Labor Party,
said those who backed Santos ``benefited from the dictatorship and
don't want to lose their accumulated privileges.''
   He was referring to Brazil's military rule that began in 1964
and lasted until Sarney, a poet, became president in 1985.

<HEAD>Army Grounds All Apache Choppers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army says it has grounded its fleet of
AH-64 ``Apache'' attack helicopters after a flaw was found on two
of the gunships during maintenance inspections.
   The Army said in a statement released at the Pentagon Thursday
that it was grounding the 526 choppers as a precautionary measure
because a cracked retention nut was found on the two helicopters.
The grounding, the fourth of the Apache fleet, was expected to last
a few days.
   The Apache is the Army's newest and most sophisticated
helicopter gunship.
   Army spokesman Maj. Barry Bomier said no accidents had been
reported because of the problem.
   The fleet, based throughout the United States and Europe, was
grounded twice in 1986 and once earlier this year after an accident
in which a piece of sheet metal struck a gunship's rotor blade.
   The grounding will remain in effect until an analysis of the
part is completed at the U.S. Army Aviation Systems Command in St.
Louis, Mo. The analysis should result in information to identify
the proper procedure for maintenance crews to follow, Bomier said.
   The part, known as the main rotor hub retention nut, holds the
rotor onto the shaft of the aircraft, Bomier said.

<NOTE>Unintentionally Automatic Pistol Being Recalled</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says thousands of .22-caliber
semiautomatic pistols called Scorpions, which may switch without
warning to an automatic function, are being recalled by the
manufacturer under an agreement reached with federal authorities.
   ``A flawed part used in the manufacture of the Scorpion .22
semiautomatic pistol may cause the gun to malfunction, including
turning the semiautomatic into an automatic,'' Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms Director Stephen E. Higgins said in a
statement released Thursday.
   In a semiautomatic weapon, a separate pull of the trigger is
required for each shot. In an automatic weapon, one pull of the
trigger can dispatch numerous shots. Congress in 1986 banned sales
of automatic weapons made on or after May 15, 1986, to all
purchasers the armed services and law enforcement agencies.
   The Scorpion is manufactured by Intratec, U.S.A., a Miami-based
firearms firm, according to ATF spokesman Jack Killorin.
   The company says it has sold about 20,000 of the guns and has an
additional 27,000 in a warehouse. The ATF will supervise the recall
and repair to make sure the guns are working properly before they
are allowed back on the market, ATF spokeswoman Dot Koester said.

<NOTE>Rep. Oakar Questions Navy Decision on USS Iowa Skipper</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congresswoman is questioning the Navy's
decision to make the skipper of the USS Iowa eligible for another
major command in light of inquiries into the battleship blast that
killed 47 sailors.
   Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, said Thursday that she was asking
Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett III to explain the ``alleged
selection'' of Capt. Fred P. Moosally for sequential major command.
   The Navy investigation concluded that gunner's mate Clayton
Hartwig of Ohio ``most likely'' caused the April 19 explosion by
inserting some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in one
of the ship's 16-inch guns.
   Members of Congress, Hartwig's family and shipmates have
criticized the report. Oakar has asked the General Accounting
Office, the investigative arm of Congress, to review the Navy's
findings.
   The Navy screening board that took the action on Moosally
includes Rear Adm. Richard Milligan, who headed the service's
investigation into the explosion, Oakar said.
   ``I realize that consideration and possible selection of Capt.
Moosally does not commit the Navy to consider him for sequential
major command, but I question the propriety of such action while
there are several congressional and Navy investigations ongoing,''
Oakar said.

   Pianist Vladimir Horowitz left nearly all of his
estate, valued at $6 million to $8 million, to his wife, Wanda
Toscanini Horowitz.
   Horowitz died in New York on Nov. 5 at age 85.
   His nine-page will, dated Nov. 1, 1985, and filed Thursday in
Surrogate's Court in Manhattan, also leaves his personal property
to his wife, daughter of conductor Arturo Toscanini.
   Horowitz left $300,000 to the Juilliard School of Music to
establish scholarships for needy piano students.
   The Yale University School of Music will receive his
memorabilia, musical scores, correspondence, recital transcripts,
photographs, awards and trophies, along with programs relating to
his musical career. All of this is to go into the school's Horowitz
archives, established Aug. 14, 1987.
   A longtime employee of the Horowitzes, Giuliana B. Lopes of
Queens, was left $200,000. Horowitz described her as ``my friend
and companion.''

   A-7 Corsair attack jets like the one that
exploded in air and crashed into an apartment complex Thursday
night have been part of the U.S. arsenal since 1965.
   The subsonic, single-engine aircraft has been used for a variety
of bombing missions on land and at sea, and was part of the
American air armada in the Vietnam War.
   The single-seat A-7E, the version of the aircraft that went down
in this north Atlanta suburb, has a 20mm gun and can carry up to
15,000 pounds of bombs and missiles. It was built by LTV Corp.
   The first version of the Corsair, the A-7A, made its initial
flight on Sept. 27, 1965, according to Jane's All The World's
Aircraft. It has been extensively modernized over the years,
particularly in the areas of flight control, navigation and
targeting equipment.
   Corsair IIs were part of the two-carrier battle group that
conducted a strike on Libyan terrorist-related targets in 1986.
A-7Es and FA-18s used anti-radar missiles to neutralize air
defenses.
   The airplane has also been used by the Greek and Portuguese air
forces.
   Two years ago, a crippled A-7D Corsair slammed into the lobby of
the Ramada Inn-Airport in Indianapolis, killing 10 people.
   The Air Force fighter was making an aborted emergency landing
attempt on Oct. 20, 1987, when it crashed into the hotel 1{ miles
from the runway moments after the pilot ejected.
   Maintenance records show that the A-7D had numerous oil system
problems in the month before the 1987 crash. The plane had been
brought in twice for dead-stick landings when its engine shut down
in midair.
   Pilots who were interviewed after that crash said the plane is
noted for its bombing accuracy, but also for unfortunate
aerodynamics.
   ``It's not an easy plane to fly,'' one Navy pilot said at the
time. ``It's underpowered to begin with and if you lose the engine,
there's not much glide left in the old bird.
   ``This is a seat bolted to a jet engine and without power,
you've got the aerodynamics of a rock. We used to joke that if you
got in trouble, you'd drop three feet for every foot you moved
forward.''
   LTV no longer produces the plane, but the company received a
contract from the Air Force in 1987 to rebuild two A-7s into ``A-7
Plus'' aircraft that would incorporate a stretched fuselage, a new
engine that would give it supersonic capability and aerodynamic
improvements.
   The Air Force would ultimately like to rebuild many of its A-7s
to the new Plus configuration, extending the planes' life into the
next century.

   Two youths inspired by a television show
created a bomb using a shotgun shell and a pipe, and both lost
fingers when the device exploded in their hands, police said.
   ``They told us they'd watched that show `MacGyver' recently and
they wanted to try and build one like they'd seen on there and set
it off in a field,'' state trooper S.A. Lawrence said.
   Kenneth Price, 19, and Mark Paul, 11, were in fair condition at
Charleston Area Medical Center's Women &amp; Children's Hospital,
nursing supervisor Darla Brumfield said Thursday. Price also
received facial burns in Wednesday's accident.
   Paul's father, Edward, drove the boys to the hospital, said
Lawrence.
   The youths removed the shell's pellets and powder and placed the
material inside the pipe. They set off the explosion by drilling a
hole in the pipe to try to make room for a fuse, Lawrence said.
   ABC-TV's ``MacGyver'' stars Richard Dean Anderson as someone who
outwits criminals with his scientific knowledge, including by
fashioning explosives out of everyday materials.
   Calls to the network's office in Los Angeles went unanswered,
and a receptionist at its New York offices said no one was
available to comment Thursday night.

   Change is coming even to East Germany's once-dour
guards at the Berlin Wall, who are better known for blocking trips
to the West _ sometimes with gunfire _ than for ushering people
across the border.
   ``The sun is shining, and the people are in a good mood,'' said
a smiling, husky East German guard this morning at the
Invalidenstrasse crossing of the Berlin Wall.
   East German authorities opened the crossings and other borders
to the West Thursday after weeks of pro-democracy protests and a
mass flight of refugees to West Germany.
   Today, the East German guard stood shoulder-to-shoulder with a
West Berlin police officer.
   Both tried good-naturedly, if unsuccessfully, to control the
crowd of West Berliners who gathered at the checkpoint to greet
newcomers from East Berlin.
   Throughout East Berlin, there were reports that border guards
were putting aside their forbidding demeanor in favor of a more
friendly look.

   Seven of Hurricane Hugo's nine victims in Puerto
Rico died in the storm's aftermath, while 13 of Hugo's 29 victims
in South Carolina died at the peak of its impact, federal
researchers found.
   But the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said Thursday residents
of both places largely avoided the most common killer historically
from hurricanes: the storm surge, a wall of water that builds up
ahead of the storm's intense low pressure.
   The agency, reviewing reports by officials in 25 South Carolina
counties, said only one person died when Hugo's 17-foot storm surge
swept the South Carolina coast on Sept. 21-22 _ a 60-year-old woman
in her mobile home.
   No storm-surge deaths were reported when Hugo lashed Puerto Rico
three days earlier.
   In Puerto Rico, most of the Hugo-related deaths were
electrocutions among repair workers after the storm.
   In South Carolina, besides the woman killed in the storm surge,
five people drowned while trying to bring boats inland at
Charleston, four were crushed in mobile homes, two were killed by
falling trees and one died in a house collapse.
   After the storm, nine people in South Carolina were killed in
five separate house fires blamed on the use of candles during power
outages. Another four people were electrocuted during cleanup and
repair work, two were killed by falling trees and one died in a
chain saw accident.
   Because of the South Carolina deaths, the CDC on Thursday
recommended more efforts to educate the public in hurricane areas
about the hazards of candles, the need to evacuate mobile homes and
the hazards of boating during the approach of a hurricane.

<HEAD>Georgia State Board Upholds Firing of Teacher of Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Board of Education upheld the dismissal
of an award-winning teacher even though she was acquitted of
charges stemming from the discovery of marijuana growing on
property she shared with her husband.
   The board said Vicki Sherling's immorality could be inferred
without proof of criminal purpose or intent.
   The state board voted 4-3 Thursday to uphold Colquitt County's
decision not to reinstate Mrs. Sherling, who was fired in May. The
local board contended there was sufficient evidence to conclude
that Mrs. Sherling at least knew her husband had possessed
marijuana.
   Mrs. Sherling, who was named 1989 Teacher of the Year in the
south Georgia county, was arrested with her husband, Michael, after
marijuana plants were found in a makeshift greenhouse in their back
yard in May.
   A test detected no trace of marijuana in her blood, and her
husband, who was sentenced to three years prison after pleading
guilty to possessing and manufacturing marijuana, testified that
Mrs. Sherling had no knowledge of the plants.
   Attorney William Norwood said Mrs. Sherling will file a lawsuit
in Colquitt County to appeal the state board's decision, and he may
file a federal case charging civil rights violations. He did not
elaborate.
   The board's action does not revoke Mrs. Sherling's teaching
certificate, and she remains eligible to teach in any Georgia
district that will hire her.
   The Georgia Association of Educators backed Mrs. Sherling,
paying legal fees for her appeal.

   Mild and pleasant weather was expected to settle over much of
the lower 48 states this weekend, replacing a week of stormy
weather from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest. Alaska's deep freeze,
though, was expected to stay put.
   Bitter, cold air across Alaska's interior dropped temperatures
Thursday to minus 39 in Fairbanks and minus 51 in Nenana. A high
pressure system was forecast to continue to build into the first
part of the weekend. Forecasters said the cold air wasn't expected
to move south soon.
   On Thursday, unseasonably warm temperatures hovered over the
Northwest and Florida. Record highs included Lewiston, Idaho, with
66 degrees, and Hollywood, Fla., 90. In Montana, two record highs
were tied: Billings, 65 degrees, and Helena, 62.
   Temperatures were cool across the Atlantic states, with
temperatures early today in the 30s and 40s from the mid-Atlantic
states to New England; over the weekend temperatures were expected
in the 40s to the 60s.
   The high temperature for the nation Thursday was 91 degrees at
the North Dade County Airport near Miami.

<HEAD>Margarine Heiress, Colombian Found Guilty Of Distributing Cocaine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The heiress of a margarine fortune and her
Colombian co-defendant were convicted of cocaine distribution and
conspiracy and face a maximum sentence of life in prison.
   Prosecutors said Sandra Filbert Amos, the granddaughter of the
founder of Mrs. Filbert's Margarine, helped her live-in boyfriend
set up the drug ring because she loved him and wanted to overcome
his feeling that the disparity in their incomes harmed their
relationship.
   Sentencing, ironically, was sent for Valentine's Day, Feb. 14.
   ``She cut a pretty sympathetic figure with the jury,''
prosecutor Breckenridge Willcox said. ``She's young, she's
attractive, she's an heiress, if you will, so this was not someone
we assumed we were going to have a slam-dunk case on.''
   Also convicted Thursday was Guillermo Moran, a Colombian living
in New York City. Amos' boyfriend, Jeremiah Dennis Case, had
already pleaded guilty to drug charges and is awaiting sentencing.
   Amos and Moran each were convicted of two counts of distribution
of cocaine and one count of conspiracy to distribute more than five
kilograms of cocaine.
   Amos, 35, who inherited $2 million of the Mrs. Filbert's
fortune, was accused of participating in a distribution ring that
operated out of her home on Maryland's Eastern Shore.
   Defense attorney Russell White argued that Amos was guilty only
of cocaine possession, spending as much as $2,000 a week to support
her drug habit.
   The conspiracy charge carries a minimum sentence of 10 years,
but prosecutor Lisa Griffin said the sentence could be lightened
depending on Amos' knowledge of the size of the distribution ring.

   Club-wielding police today drove
hundreds of protesters from the U.S. Embassy, where they were
demanding the closing of U.S. military bases. At least two people
were injured.
   Protesters carried placards denouncing President Corazon
Aquino's meeting Thursday in Washington with President Bush.
   ``President Aquino's meeting with Bush is a sign of her
treacherous selling of her country's sovereignty in exchange for
the bases,'' said Philip Hernandez, a union official who spoke at
the Manila rally.
   Police initially stood by as about 100 militant workers
protested in front of the embassy to demand the six U.S. bases be
closed.
   However, when about 500 marchers led by the League of Filipino
Students arrived to join the protest, police arrested student
leader Nathaniel Santiago.
   The students began hurling stones, and police fired warning
shots in the air. They then charged the group, scattering
protesters into sidestreets.
   At least one photographer and a policeman were injured by flying
stones.
   In Olongapo, home of the U.S.-run Subic Bay naval base,
thousands of residents turned out today to show support for
maintaining the bases after their lease expires in September 1991.
   The demonstration took place as two Philippines Senate
committees held a joint hearing in Olongapo, 50 miles west of
Manila, on the future of the bases.
   U.S. and Filipino negotiators are expected to begin talks in
Manila next month on extending the lease. Any agreement must be
approved by two-thirds of the 23-member Senate, where opposition is
strong.
   Olongapo, with a population of about 50,000, depends on Subic
Bay for its economic livelihood. During the Senate hearing,
speakers argued for keeping the bases because of their economic
benefits.
   U.S. officials say the facilties pump about $1 billion a year
into the Philippine economy through salaries, purchases of local
supplies and spending by the 40,000 U.S. troops, civilians and
military dependents.

   Law officers wearing ``moon suits'' today
finished a week-long job of sifting through warehouse barrels
filled with dangerous chemicals and cocaine that authorities say is
worth more than $850 million.
   The delicate operation, involving federal agents, local police
and even the American Red Cross, unfolded in an unlikely setting: a
quiet block in the New York City borough of Queens that includes
warehouses, tenements and humble houses with a view of the Empire
State Building across the East River.
   ``It's an old-fashioned neighborhood; most of the residents are
hardworking, blue-collar or middle-class people,'' said resident
John O'Sullivan at a nearby coffee shop. ``Drugs are not within our
vernacular.''
   But in a raid on a three-story warehouse last Friday, drug
agents found cocaine.
   On top of the cocaine packages in the sealed drums were six
inches of a powdery substance, which police soon learned contained
a 98 percent concentration of sodium hydroxide _ a chemical used in
lye that can eat through concrete. In comparison, said Lt. Doug
Reed of the Police Department's hazardous materials unit, drain
cleaner has about a 4 percent concentration of sodium hydroxide,
known as caustic soda.
   The authorities finished recovering the cocaine this morning,
cataloguing 10,648 pounds of the drug, said Rick Mercier, a U.S.
Customs special agent. Police and Customs officials estimate the
cocaine's street value at $80,000 a pound.
   It could be the largest seizure to date in New York, and one of
the five largest cocaine seizures in the nation's history,
according to DEA spokeswoman Mary Cooper.
   The investigation, begun by U.S. Customs, soon included federal
drug agents, city police, county police and emergency medical
squads. The Red Cross fed 80 workers on Wednesday night alone.
   Police working inside the warehouse wore oxygen masks, 40-pound
tanks, and protective suits, the sleeves sealed with tape to two
pairs of gloves. The gloves were changed when the chemicals ate
through them, about twice an hour.
   The teams worked around-the-clock on the painstaking process of
opening the drums, decontaminating, repackaging, removing the
cocaine _ except on Sunday, when New York Marathon runners streamed
right past the cordoned-off warehouse.
   As it was decontaminated, the cocaine was placed in a
semi-trailer truck. Eventually, the truckload will be driven to an
incinerator at an undisclosed location.
   Mercier said the cocaine could be tainted, despite the plastic
that surrounded it in the drum. It wasn't clear whether any had
made it onto the streets.
   Sodium hydroxide can irritate the skin and respiratory tract and
cause blindness. The damage is compounded when it's smoked or
injected.
   Investigators were searching for five suspects, believed linked
to the Cali drug cartel. The New York Times reported that police
were searching for Juan Martinez, head of a company called the
Aranal Corp., which rented the warehouse.
   In a simultaneous raid last Friday, agents found thousands of
drums of sodium hydroxide in a Philadelphia warehouse leased by
Aranal Corp. Mercier said he had no immediate word of cocaine in
the drums there.

   The dollar steadied in European trading today
while traders debated the impact of East Germany's decision to
permit free travel for its citizens.
   Gold was slightly lower in quiet trading.
   The immediate impact of German developments, said Peter Kane,
chief corporate dealer at Credit Suisse in London, was to create
uncertainty about the consequences for the West German economy and
thus undermine the Deutsche mark.
   ``Where there is uncertainty, there tends to be weakness,'' Kane
said.
   Analysts said a flood of East Germans into West Germany would
have a mixed impact, raising unemployment but perhaps easing
pressure on inflation as new arrivals accept lower wages.
   ``It may take months or years for problems to show through,''
said Chris Furness of Hill, Samuel &amp; Co. Ltd. in London. ``What
still is unclear is if any other of the major countries is going to
do any better.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed Friday at 142.75 yen, barely changed
from Thursday's close of 142.70. Later in London, the dollar traded
at 142.78 yen.
   Other dollar rates in Europe compared with late Thursday:
   _1.8524 West German marks, up from 1.8475
   _1.6255 Swiss francs, up from 1.6212
   _6.2825 French francs, up from 6.2545

   _1,352.75 Italian lire, up from 1,351.50
   _1.1680 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1675
   In London, the pound sterling traded at $1.5850, down from
$1.5863 late Thursday.
   London's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommend price of
$386.45 bid per troy ounce this morning, up from $386.25 a troy
ounce late Thursday.
   In Zurich, gold traded at $386.40 per troy ounce at noon today,
down from $387.30 bid late Thursday.
   Gold in Hong Kong closed at $386.24 today, down 48 cents from
late Thursday.
   Silver bullion traded at $5.27 bid per ounce, retreating from a
four-month high of $5.33 bid late Thursday.

   Masked gunmen raided an engineering
college dormitory in Punjab state before dawn today and fatally
shot 19 students as they slept, police said. Eight others were
wounded.
   Police said the gunmen were believed to be Sikh extremists
fighting for an independent homeland in Punjab, a rich farming
state on the northern border with Pakistan.
   The attack occurred just hours before Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi was scheduled to arrive in the city for a brief campaign
trip.
   Police said the gunmen stormed a dormitory at the Thapar
Engineering College in Patiala, about 25 miles south of Chandigarh,
and opened fire.
   Sixteen students died instantly, said police, speaking on
condition of anonymity. They said three of the 11 students injured
died at a nearby hospital.
   The victims were students at two universities in neighboring
states and were participating in Thapar College's annual youth
festival, police said.
   Sikh extremists have killed at least 1,544 people this year in
their bid for the separate homeland they want to call Khalistan, or
``Land of the Pure.''
   The radicals allege Sikhs are socially and culturally
discriminated against by the Hindu majority and the Hindu-dominated
government.
   Sikhs make up 2 percent of India's 880 million people but are a
slight majority in Punjab. Hindus comprise 82 percent of the
population.

<HEAD>Mistrial Declared Over Remaining Assault Charge Against Actor Todd
Bridges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Todd Bridges, acquitted this week of
attempted murder in the shooting of a drug dealer, left jail for
the first time since February after a mistrial was declared on the
lone assault charge facing him.
   Bridges, best known for his role in the former NBC-TV series
``Diff'rent Strokes,'' was released from jail on $25,000 bail
Thursday after the jury could not reach a unanimous verdict on the
charge of assault with a deadly weapon.
   Bridges, 24, was acquitted of attempted murder and attempted
voluntary manslaughter Tuesday.
   He had been in custody since his arrest in early February,
accused in the close-range shooting of Kenneth ``Tex'' Clay, a drug
dealer's henchman working out of a Los Angeles house where crack
cocaine was peddled.
   Clay survived the attack and testified that Bridges was highly
intoxicated the night of the shooting. Bridges said in tearful
testimony he had been on a four-day cocaine binge at the time and
did not remember pulling the trigger.
   Superior Court Commissioner Florence-Marie Cooper declared the
mistrial after jurors announced they remained deadlocked 8-4 in
favor of acquittal.
   Bridges ``was gratified, real pleased,'' defense attorney
Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. said Thursday. ``He just wanted to get out.
He wants to put his life back together.''
   The prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney William Hodgman, said
he was surprised and disappointed by the acquittals and mistrial.
He said the district attorney's office likely will decide next week
whether to retry Bridges on the assault charge.
   Juror Maxine Hall said ``it was a sloppy case'' and that Bridges
``never should have been charged with attempted murder. There was
no problem finding him not guilty of attempted murder at all.''
   The prosecution had argued that Bridges shot Clay eight times at
close range in a dispute over the actor's BMW automobile.
   Clay denied he had stolen the car in his testimony during
Bridges' preliminary hearing but reversed himself during the trial.
   Cochran characterized Bridges as ``a babe in the woods'' out of
his element in the mean streets of South Central Los Angeles, and
said the actor had fired in self-defense.

<TEXT>
   China has poured an additional $1.1 billion into
money-losing state factories, it was reported today, a blow to the
government's attempt to balance the budget.
   The latest loan to large industrial enterprises, reported by the
official China Daily today, was also more bad news for citizens who
are being forced to buy ``voluntary'' debt bonds to pay for
government subsidy programs.
   The daily said the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China,
which recently gave out $1.4 billion in loans to faltering
government enterprises, was providing the additional credit to
carry them through current difficulties.
   It said $378 million more had been set aside as credit funds for
enterprises having cash problems due to a government austerity
policy that has restricted money supply.
   The daily said the latest funding was believed to be part of a
more sizeable loan. If so, it would appear the government has begun
to cave in on a tough fiscal policy out of fears of plant
shutdowns, rising unemployment and recession.
   On Thursday, the Communist Party Central Committee outlined a
plan committing the nation to at least two more years of economic
retrenchment and called for the gradual achievement of a balanced
budget.
   Hard-line communists led by Premier Li Peng face the dilemma of
supporting an inefficient government-run system that makes fiscal
solvency an impossibility.
   About a quarter of government industries, top-heavy with workers
and shackled by planning demands, are money losers, and the central
government is believed to pay out about $10.8 billion a year in
subsidies to keep them going.
   The Finance Ministry has put China's budget deficit at about
$2.2 billion but Western economists say it could be as much as four
times that amount if foreign loans and the issuance of treasury
bonds were included.

   East Germany's official news agency ADN published
this text Thursday announcing the opening of borders to the West:
   As ADN was told by the government spokesman, the Council of
Ministers of the German Democratic Republic has decided that the
following regulations for private travel and permanent departure
abroad from the GDR are to be put into force with immediate effect,
pending a corresponding legislative provision by the People's
Chamber:
   1. Private travel abroad can be applied for without submission
of requirements (purpose of travel and family relationships).
Permits will be issued at short notice. Reasons for refusal will be
applied only in special exceptional cases.
   2. The relevant passport and registration divisions of People's
Police regional offices in the GDR have been instructed to issue
visas for permanent departure without delay, without requiring that
still valid preconditions for permanent departure be fulfilled. As
before, application for permanent departure is possible also at
Internal Affairs offices.
   3. Permanent departures can be made via all border crossings of
the GDR to the Federal Republic of Germany and West Berlin.
   4. Therefore, the temporary issuance of permits in foreign
missions of the GDR or permanent departure with the personal
identity papers of the GDR via third countries is no longer
necessary.

<HEAD>Man Accused of Killing His Children Allegedly Tried to Blow up House</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man charged with drowning his four children by
driving his car into the Detroit River admitted trying to blow up
his home in 1982 while his wife and infant son slept, the
prosecutor said.
   A motion filed by the Wayne County prosecutor's office alleges
that Lawrence DeLisle of Lincoln Park admitted lighting a candle
next to a dryer that was leaking gas in the basement of the
family's town house in Taylor in an attempt to kill his family. The
gas did not ignite.
   DeLisle, 29, faces first-degree murder charges in the drowning
deaths of his four children; Bryan, 8, who was a baby at the time
of the drying incident; Melissa 4; Kathryn, 2; and Emily, 9 months.
The children were trapped inside the family station wagon when it
plunged into the Detroit River on Aug. 3.
   DeLisle's wife, Suzanne, 32, was in the car but survived. He
also faces a charge of attempted murder.
   DeLisle originally claimed that a leg cramp was responsible for
the accident. Under police questioning he later said he
deliberately drove into the river, but then he recanted that
confession and said police obtained it by duress.
   Defense attorney Frank Eaman said he will try to prevent
DeLisle's statement about the dryer from being used in the case,
saying the incident isn't pertinent. He maintains that statement
also was coerced by police.
   A hearing on the motion to have the dryer incident admitted as
evidence is scheduled for Dec. 8. DeLisle's trial is scheduled to
begin Jan. 16.
   Mrs. DeLisle has maintained her husband's innocence.

   Hundreds of East Germans converged on Checkpoint
Charlie today to cross through the Berlin Wall to the West for the
first time in their lives.
   Tens of thousands more virtually stormed police stations across
the country to get the visas that will take them West. But West
German news media quoted some travelers as saying they found that
formal visas weren't even necessary to join the wave of visitors to
the West.
   ``Can't take it in,'' muttered Helmut Imhof as he stood in line
at Checkpoint Charlie for a visa that would take him to West Berlin
through the weekend. Communist authorities on Thursday began
allowing citizens to travel freely to the West for the first time
since the wall was erected in 1961.
   ``I've worked right here next to the Wall for 20 years,'' Imhof
said, jerking a thumb in the direction of East Berlin. ``You looked
across once in a while. But the fact that we can go through, it's
just unbelievable.''
   On the Western side of the Wall, East German construction
workers still wearing their work overalls and hard hats drank beer
and toasted their first experience of West Berlin, watched by about
200 curious Westerners and immortalized by a host of photographers.
   Back in the East, more hard-hatted workers filled out the
uncomplicated forms that guaranteed them a brief visit to West
Berlin.
   ``Everybody wanted to go so we decided to do it in shifts,''
said a young worker who declined to give his name. ``But we're
still fulfilling our quota of work,'' he assured a reporter.
   The crowd waiting to go across included three Soviets, who said
they missed the chance to go through Thursday when the news broke.
   ``But we must try now. Just to see it once,'' said a Russian
worker who said he lived in East Berlin but declined to give his
name.
   Rene, a 20-year-old factory worker who declined to give his last
name, was one of the uncounted tens of thousands who surged across
to West Berlin without waiting for the official visa on Thursday
night.
   ``I think it's simply great,'' he said on East Berlin's
Leipziger Strasse this morning just after getting the stamp that
will allow him unlimited trips to West Berlin for six months.
   ``I was over there for an hour last night,'' he said. ``I didn't
see much, it was dark. But the way the people greeted us _ that was
wonderful. And I saw enough to know that it's something quite
different over there. It's a once-in-a-lifetime feeling.''
   At one East Berlin police station, about 3,000 people were
waiting for the new visas by the time the police station opened at
8 a.m., witnesses reported.
   Police stations were ordered to remain open through the weekend
to cope with the crowds, the official news agency ADN said.
   At the Checkpoint Charlie, the famed spot where East and West
have exchanged spies for nearly three decades, as well as the
Invalidenstrasse and Bornholmer Strasse crossings into West Berlin,
people were being waved through after simply filling out a form for
a one-day visit. Some didn't even have to do that.
   Neither West Berlin nor East Berlin authorities had any real
idea of how many tens of thousands of East Berliners into West
Berlin Thursday night and early today in a delirious, spontaneous
outburst of joy. However, the Sender Freies Berlin radio station
estimated the number at more than 50,000.

   Here is a look at the tumultuous year in East Europe, where
governments and their citizens are grappling with the wave of
reforms unleashed by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   POLAND:
   The Communists began negotiating with the outlawed Solidarity
trade union in February to halt labor unrest and enlist the
opposition group's help in instituting austerity measures. On April
17, the Communist government grants Solidarity legal status and
allows limited opposition participation in elections. Solidarity
wins virtually every seat it is allowed to seek, then puts together
a legislative majority with two minor parties that were once
thought to be puppets of the ruling Communists.
   The Communists are unable to form a legislative majority or a
government. On Aug. 18, Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski
approves the concept of a Solidarity-led government. A week later,
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a former Solidarity activist, becomes the first
non-Communist prime minister of a Soviet bloc nation.

<TEXT>
   CZECHOSLOVAKIA:
   Although it has the highest standard of living in the East bloc,
the Communist government is among the most resistant to
Soviet-style reforms. The government jails playwright and activist
Vaclav Havel, freeing him four months later after worldwide
condemnation. Police attack demonstrators in January. They launched
a similar assault on demonstrators in August during a rally marking
the Soviet-led invasion of 1968, which crushed the ``Prague
Spring'' reforms that presaged Gorbachev's own initiatives.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SOVIET UNION:
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who fathered the reforms sweeping the East
bloc when he came to power in 1985, turns inward to settle a series
of ethnic disputes and labor unrest spurred by his tolerance of
dissent. Ethnic clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijans, strikes
in key mining regions and nationalist movements in the Baltic
republics threaten Gorbachev's ability to improve the nation's
economy.
   Gorbachev, however, proceeds with major political reforms that
include the creation of a new, stronger and more vocal Parliament.
Citizens vent their displeasure with the Communist old guard by
voting out scores of Communists in the Soviet's first competitive
elections. Dissident physicist Andrei Sakharov is among government
critics elected to a place in the new legislature.

<TEXT>
   HUNGARY:
   Politburo reformer Imre Poszgay stuns the nation by calling the
1956 revolt against Soviet rule a ``popular uprising'' rather than
a counterrevolutionary revolt. After a remarkable series of
soul-searching meetings in February, the Communist Party endorses
democratic elections.
   In May, Hungary begins removing border fortifications with
Austria to symbolize its quest for close economic and political
ties with its capitalist neighbors. What transpires is an abrupt
deluge of citizens from East Germany who have been looking for a
quick and easy way to West Germany. On Oct. 7, Hungary's Communist
Party dissolves itself at a historic meeting, then reconstitutes
itself as the Hungarian Socialist Party, espousing democratic
ideals in a bid to do well in next year's democratic elections.

   BULGARIA:
   The nation Todor Zhivkov has led for 34 years has been slow to
embrace change. Human rights abuses and police repression are
reported with increasing frequency as dissidents grow bolder. Last
week, about 9,000 people gathered in the capital, Sofia, in the
first known pro-democracy rally in the country's Communist history.
Witnesses said the demonstrators chanted ``democracy'' and
``glasnost,'' Gorbachev's word for his policies of greater openness.

   EAST GERMANY:
   Hard-line leader Erich Honecker, in power for 18 years,
denounces the Soviet-style reforms embraced in Poland and Hungary.
But Hungary's decision to open its border to Austria triggers a
flood of tens of thousands of East Germans heading to West Germany,
where they are granted automatic citizenship. Hundreds of thousands
of others begin holding demonstrations demanding free elections and
unrestricted travel. Honecker begins loosening reins on his rigidly
controlled society, and on Oct. 18 steps down.
   He is replaced by Egon Krenz, who, though also considered a
hard-liner, tries to placate the unruly masses and stop the
hemorrhaging of emigres at its borders. Krenz holds talks in Moscow
with Gorbachev and announces East Germany has much to learn from
Kremlin-style reforms. He says on Nov. 3 that he would support a
law ensuring free and democratic elections, then completely throws
open the borders to the West _ in essence eliminating the reason
for the 28-year-old Berlin Wall.

   ROMANIA:
   President Nicolae Ceausescu rules so harshly that any opposition
is crushed at the outset. Romania remains the most repressive of
the Warsaw Pact nations. Ceausescu's efforts to rid the nation of
its foreign debt has left it financially strapped. Huge food and
power shortages are the norm. Last week, Ceausescu fired the
planning chief of the state-run economy. At one point this year,
Ceausescu suggested the Warsaw Pact military alliance block the
Solidarity takeover in Poland.

   Deng Xiaoping met former U.S. Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger among the official trappings of the Great Hall of
the People today, a day after he announced his retirement from his
last party post.
   Deng on Thursday gave up his last official job as chairman of
the Communist Party's Central Military Commission.
   The 85-year-old Deng today noted with a hearty laugh that
Kissinger was the first foreign guest he had met since retirement,
but he said he will continue to play his ``dual role'' as citizen
and party member.
   The meeting at Beijing's Great Hall, the seat of government,
reinforced the general feeling that Deng will remain dominant,
though he no longer holds official titles.
   After Deng made reference to his retirement, Kissinger said:
``You will never be without great influence.''
   ``Are you opposed to it?'' Deng asked.
   ``I am for it,'' Kissinger said.
   Deng commented that Kissinger is no longer secretary of state
``yet you are still busy working in international affairs.''
   Kissinger is making what is believed to be his 15th trip to
China since a secret visit in 1971 that set the stage for
normalization of relations with the United States.
   Deng referred to his advanced age and his stutter but said he
was ``quite healthy,'' adding, ``My mind is quite clear.''
   He was replaced on the military body by Jiang Zemin, Communist
Party chief.
   Former Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang continued to be
pilloried in the official press even while a just-concluded party
meeting refrained from further attacks on the once-powerful
reformer.
   This week's edition of the Newspaper-Magazine Digest, a weekly
review of the official press, accused Zhao of ``violent treachery''
in the 1988 demise of the party ideological magazine ``Red Flag.''
   Zhao, 70, was purged from all his party posts on June 24 at a
party Central Committee meeting that accused him of supporting the
pro-democracy demonstrations crushed by the military earlier that
month.
   Zhao, believed to be under house arrest, has been under constant
attack since then and there has been speculation he might face
criminal charges.
   However, the party Central Committee, in a communique issued
Thursday, failed to mention the former party chief, indicating
either that the Zhao case has been put to rest or party leaders
were unable to agree on how to deal with him.
   Jiang said in an interview with Japan's Jiji Press today that an
investigation into Zhao's actions has not been completed and as a
result his case had not been taken up at the party meeting.

<HEAD>GOP Leaders Give Angry Colleague Committee Seat He Demanded</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 5 grafs to explain that Ravenel had difficulty getting
on the committee because the senior GOP member of the panel was blocking
his appointment.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

   A disgruntled House Republican from South
Carolina is going to get a seat on the Merchant Marine and
Fisheries Committee after saying he could ``just as easily be a
Democrat.''
   Rep. Arthur Ravenel of South Carolina insisted he had not
actually threatened to bolt his party. But GOP Chairman Lee Atwater
and House Republican leaders got him on the panel anyway.
   House Republican leaders Bob Michel of Illinois and Newt
Gingrich of Georgia, after consulting with Atwater, hurriedly
arranged Ravenel's appointment Thursday.
   The behind-the-scenes jockeying took place after the State
newspaper in Columbia, S.C., quoted unidentified sources as saying
Ravenel felt out of step with his party and was considering
crossing over to the Democrats.
   But what had been irking Ravenel was his inability to get on the
committee he called ``extremely important to the health and wealth
of the 1st Congressional District'' of South Carolina.
   Atwater is a native of South Carolina and congressional sources
said Ravenel's defection could have proved embarrassing to him. GOP
spokeswoman Leslie Goodman said the party chairman discussed the
problem at breakfast Thursday with Ravenel and Gingrich.
   Atwater, who has known Ravenel since he was a volunteer for
Ravenel's mayoral candidacy in Charleston in 1970, said he spoke
with Gingrich and Michel about the seat for Ravenel.
   ``It was those two who lobbied and got the votes on the
committee,'' said Atwater, adding ``it makes sense'' to have a
congressman from the coastal city of Charleston on the committee.
   Earlier Thursday, Ravenel had dismissed speculation in his home
state that he was prepared to leave the GOP.
   ``If I was going to switch parties, I would hold a press
conference and I would tell the people at home I was switching
parties and why,'' the lawmaker said. ``I wouldn't make a switch
unless I had a compelling reason.''
   In an interview earlier this week, Ravenel said he had been
criticized by conservatives in South Carolina for his recent
support of funding for abortion in cases of incest or rape and for
backing some spending measures.
   ``I'm just not a right-winger. I'm a moderate, and it just
drives some of the Republicans back home up the wall,'' Ravenel was
quoted as saying. ``I could just as easily be a Democrat as a
Republican.''
   But Ravenel said Thursday those comments were nothing new and
``that's a lot of old stuff I've been saying for a long time.''
   Michel and Gingrich had to lobby Rep. Don Young of Alaska, the
senior Republican on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee,
to remove his objections to Ravenel's joining the panel.
   Ravenel had said Young was blocking his appointment because he
opposed Young's stance in favor of opening the Alaska National
Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration.
   C.J. Zane, Young's administrative assistant, confirmed that
Young fought Ravenel's appointment because Ravenel refused to
pledge to support Young's position on the Alaska National Wildlife
Refuge issue.
   Zane said Young ``went along'' with the requests of the party
leadership to seat Ravenel out of concern for party unity.
   ``There was a big push from Michel and other Republicans,
including Atwater, because they didn't want to deal with losing a
guy to another party at this time,'' the aide said.

<HEAD>`Prince of Central Park,' A New Musical, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs with other critics' comments. No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only in a Broadway musical can you spend the
night in New York's Central Park and survive to sing and dance. Not
only sing and dance, but build a home, in this case a tree house
complete with dinnerware stolen from Tavern on the Green.
   ``Prince of Central Park'' is a New York fairy tale told with a
modest amount of musical imagination and wit. The show, which
opened Thursday at Broadway's Belasco Theater, is a small musical
in almost every respect. It's not awful, but its mildness and
meager musical numbers make it a dim prospect to last very long on
Broadway.
   The story, adapted by Evan H. Rhodes, is based on Rhodes'
successful novel and a well-received television special. A
middle-aged woman facing divorce meets a young runaway in Central
Park. She's escaping from an unsatisfying marriage; he's fleeing a
brutal life as a foster child. Before the musical is over, they
unsurprisingly have forged a new family.
   The New York conjured up by Rhodes, composer Don Sebesky and
lyricist Gloria Nissenson is a remarkably tame city, despite the
references to drugs and crime. At times, their vision of Gotham
seems like bargain basement Comden and Green. It's a city where
police officers tap dance, bag ladies are lovable, sales clerks ask
if they can help you and muggers look like refugees from an MTV
video.
   What makes the musical tolerable is the personalities of its two
stars, Jo Anne Worley, who plays the woman, and Richard H. Blake as
the boy. Worley is what used to be known as ``a trouper,'' a
vanishing breed on Broadway today. No matter how unhummable the
music or insipid the lyrics or book, she carries on. Worley charges
through the show as if she believes every note and word. She is
having fun and insists the audience do so, too.
   Blake has remarkable poise for a 14-year-old. He can dance as
well as sing, talents which director and choreographer Tony Tanner
utilizes to great effect. He has a rapport with Worley that adds a
dimension not found in Rhodes' adaptation of the story.
   But Anthony Galde is an unmenacing teen-age villain, the kind of
street punk who would have been out-of-date in the original
production of ``West Side Story.'' There are too many dance numbers
featuring Galde and his unthreatening gang of toughs from central
casting. And Chris Callen is left with the thankless task of
playing Worley's daughter who is conspiring to send her mother off
to a Florida retirement community.
   Michael Bottari and Ronald Case designed the revolving set,
including a large tree that spins to reveal the boy's leafy
sanctuary. When Blake sits there and stakes his claim to being
``The Prince of Central Park,'' the musical has a certain appeal.
But too often the show depends on the charms of its stars to do the
work neglected by the book, music and lyrics.

   What other critics said:
   Frank Rich, The New York Times: ``Prince of Central Park'' ...
is a numbing evening of such guileless amateurism that it will
probably have a future as a Harvard Business School case study,
whatever its fate in the annals of drama.
   Howard Kissel, Daily News: None of this is presented with the
slightest whimsy or genuine understanding. It all passes quickly by
in sitcom-length scenes, punctuated by music and lyrics of equal
dreariness and witlessness.
   Clive Barnes, New York Post: In my subjective view this show,
which started in Florida, should have stayed in Florida _ the
alligators might have found it more to their taste.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A boy born two months premature after his mother
was fatally shot by a robber has died at the age of 2 weeks,
officials said.
   ``It's a tragedy for a mother and a baby and it's a tragedy for
all the families of innocent victims who have suffered violence in
our society,'' Mayor Raymond Flynn said after Christopher Stuart's
death Thursday afternoon at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
   Dr. Steven Ringer, head of the hospital's neonatal intensive
care unit, said the infant died of respiratory failure from his
premature and traumatic birth.
   The baby had been in intensive care since his delivery by
emergency Caesarean section shortly after his mother, Carol Stuart,
was shot Oct. 23.
   Charles Stuart, 29, who was critically wounded in the attack,
was brought by ambulance from Boston City Hospital to be at his
son's bedside along with family members.
   Mrs. Stuart, 30, who was seven months pregnant, was shot and
killed by a gunman who held up the couple in their car after they
left Brigham and Women's Hospital.
   ``Everybody in the city of Boston was really praying beyond hope
that Christopher would make it,'' Flynn said.
   But family members said the baby, who was delivered two months
prematurely, may have suffered serious brain damage. He weighed 3
pounds, 13 ounces at birth and had neither grown nor gained weight.
   The infant had been on a life-support system and suffered
repeated convulsions since birth, family members said.
   The assailant in the case is still at large.

<HEAD>Three White Guerrillas Go to Prison</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three whites who proudly
admitted to being guerrillas of the African National Congress were
sentenced on terrorism charges today to prison terms of up to 25
years.
   Supporters in the courtroom threw yellow daisies at the
defendants when the sentence was announced. One defendant, Iain
Robertson, yelled, ``Long Live The ANC!'' as police pulled him away.
   The two men and one woman acknowledged they were from the
military wing of the predominantly black movement, which has waged
a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961 to end white rule and
apartheid.
   They were arrested in May 1988 at a farmhouse outside
Johannesburg where police seized a large cache of Soviet-made
weapons. It included a SAM-7 missile, hand grenades, mortar bombs,
assault rifles and pistols, and was described as one of the largest
caches ever seized in South Africa.
   Damian de Lange, 31, a former journalist and leader of the cell,
was sentenced today to 25 years in prison. Robertson, 35, received
a 20-year sentence and Susan Westcott, 25, a native of Swaziland
whose parents are British, was sentenced to 18 years.
   Magistrate W.J. van den Bergh, in issuing the sentences, said
the defendants ``were indifferent to loss of life.
   ``They are entitled to their own political views and beliefs. It
is their transgressions of the law that must be punished,'' he said.
   The Human Rights Commission, an independent anti-apartheid
monitoring group, condemned the sentences as harsh and said
apartheid was to blame for the ANC's decision to use violence.
   David Soggott, the defense attorney, said an appeal might be
filed.
   Ms. Westcott's mother, Margaret Westcott, said afterwards: ``We
stand by our daughter _ she's done a very brave thing for this
country.''
   The chief prosecutor, Frans Roets, had asked for sentences of
125 years for de Lange, 110 years for Robertson and 90 years for
Ms. Westcott.
   ``They wanted to intimidate the population with cowardly
attacks,'' Roets said in his summary earlier this week in Pretoria
Regional Court.
   Prosecutors said de Lange detonated a bomb last year that
damaged a bus carrying military personnel to work. No one on the
bus was seriously hurt.
   The three were held in solitary confinement for seven months
after their arrest. They first appeared in court in January, and
all three pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in June.
   Throughout the sentencing procedures, the courtroom gallery was
packed with Arican National Congress supporters. Many wore the
gold, green and black colors of the guerrilla movement.
   One session was attended by Walter Sisulu and three other ANC
leaders who were freed on Oct. 15 after 26 years in prison.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sailors on the USS Iowa were looting
possessions while their crewmen battled the explosion in a gun
turret that killed 47 shipmates April 19, a published report says.
   As many as 10 sailors were involved in looting that day,
although their names were withheld from their shipmates for fear of
reprisals, crew members told The Washington Times in a story
published in today's editions.
   The Navy has denied that any looting took place while crew
members were fighting the fire in gun turret No. 2.
   ``It is absolutely false,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley, a Navy
spokesman. ``There was nobody caught. There was no break-in. There
was no evidence of looting.'' Quigley said the lockers of the 47
victims were sealed that day and no possessions were taken.
   However, The Times reported it received a letter from an officer
currently assigned to the USS Iowa who was on the battleship the
day of the blast. ``You are correct that there was looting while
the damage control efforts were ongoing on 19 April ...'' the
officer, who was not identified, wrote The Times.
   ``Those who did the looting were punished either at captain's
mast or at special court martial,'' the sailor added.
   Two other sailors also have told The Times they heard while on
board the ship that looting occurred, although they had not
actually witnessed the thefts.
   ``The bad part is they (the looters) tried to break into lockers
of those that were killed,'' said former gunner's mate David James,
who said he was informed of the looting by a master at arms. Two
other former shipmates, who asked not to be identified, confirmed
James' account.
   The Naval Investigative Service in its report on the Iowa
disaster described a locker break-in in the berthing area that
housed those killed in Turret 2.
   The Navy investigation concluded that gunner's mate Clayton
Hartwig of Ohio ``most likely'' caused the April 19 explosion by
inserting some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in one
of the ship's 16-inch guns.
   Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, said Thursday she is asking Navy
Secretary Lawrence Garrett III to explain why Iowa Capt. Fred P.
Moosally is being made eligible for another major command.
   ``I realize that consideration and possible selection of Capt.
Moosally does not commit the Navy to consider him for sequential
major command, but I question the propriety of such action while
there are several congressional and Navy investigations ongoing,''
Oakar said.

   Abortion rights activists plan to stage nearly 1,000 pro-choice
events this weekend _ from a sunrise rally in Maine to a sunset
gathering in California _ to remind lawmakers that limiting
abortion access could be politically harmful.
   ``Since the emphasis in reproductive choice has shifted from the
federal level to the state legislative level, we feel it's
important to have demonstrations in each state,'' said Sally Tyler,
executive director of the Georgia Abortion Rights Action League,
which is planning a demonstration at an Atlanta park.
   Organizers of the campaign, called Mobilize for Women's Lives,
said the demonstrations, panel discussions and other activities in
towns and on college campuses are to remind legislators they
represent the views of the majority of the U.S. public. Abortion
opponents said they would stage counterdemonstrations at some
locations.
   Representatives of both sides said they plan to turn out for
two-block march on the state capitol in Jackson, Miss.
   ``People for choice have been invisible because of legalized
abortion,'' said Brenda Henson, president of Sister Spirit, a
women's resource center in Gulfport, Miss. ``We haven't been
threatened until now. Now we need to stand up and say `We already
fought this battle once, and we won't give up.'''
   Henson was referring to the U.S. Supreme Court decision on July
3 that stopped short of reversing the Roe vs. Wade decision that
legalized most abortions in 1973 but gave states more power to
limit abortions.
   Sunday's events will begin with a sunrise rally in Kennebunk,
Maine, and wind up with a sunset rally in San Francisco. In
Washington, a rally is planned at the Lincoln Memorial in
Washington.
   At some events, pro-choice participants will wear purple
clothing or purple bows, the color of the women's suffrage movement
decades ago.
   Samuel Lee, legislative chairman for Missouri Citizens for Life,
said his group would hold a news conference in the Capitol in
Jefferson City shortly before pro-choice demonstrators were due to
hold a rally outside.
   Asked if the purpose of the conference was to share in the news
coverage, he said, ``I wouldn't deny that at all. It's a
convenience for the media people, too, for us to all be in one
place.''
   It was a case from Missouri that led to the recent Supreme Court
decision.
   India McCanse, an organizer of the pro-choice demostration in
the Missouri Capitol, said the expected turnout of thousands ``will
be significant, because a lot of people in this country have
written off Missouri as being totally anti-choice. We want to
demonstrate that is absolutely wrong.''

<TEXT>
   Authorities arrested about 1,000 Moslems
today when they tried to march to the nearby town of Ayodhya, where
triumphal Hindus celebrated the building of a new temple on a site
claimed by both religions.
   The Moslem protest was peaceful, but one of its leaders who was
arrested, Zafaryab Jilani, warned: ``When all these methods fail,
arms are taken up. The next generation may not listen to peaceful
protest.''
   At least 290 people have been killed in Hindu-Moslem violence in
three Indian states since August, when plans for the new temple
were announced. So far the violence has not spread to Ayodhya and
Faizabad, 330 miles southeast of the capital New Delhi.
   The demonstrators in Faizabad accused Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi and his Congress Party of caving in to Hindu fundamentalists
in a bid for votes from the Hindu majority in national elections
less than two weeks away.
   ``If this ruling Congress Party is ousted from power, perhaps
secular government can be saved,'' said Jilani, a senior leader of
the All India Babri Masjid Action Committee.
   Babri Masjid, or the Mosque of Babar, was built in the 17th
century in Ayodhya on the spot where Hindu fundamentalists claim
one of their most popular gods, Lord Ram, was born.
   About 90 minutes after the Moslems were arrested in Faizabad, a
frenzied mob of Hindu worshipers celebrated the placing of the
foundation stone of a new temple to Ram about 120 feet from the
Babri Masjid. They flung marigold petals into a 6-foot hole where
their leaders reverently placed a pile of bricks and a cornerstone.
   Police wearing helmets and chest protectors struggled to keep
from falling into the pit as at least 5,000 pilgrims pushed into
the small hilltop enclave in less than an hour.
   The Hindu-Moslem dispute over the Ayodhya hilltop is centuries
old, but the the current furor centers on who owns the land where
the foundation is being laid for a new Hindu temple. Hindus and
Moslems had agreed that one tiny plot that was to hold the
foundation stone was owned by a Hindu.
   The rest of the land needed to complete the new Ram temple is
disputed.
   While the Moslems opposed the construction of the new temple,
they agreed they could not prevent its foundation stone from being
placed on the little plot owned by a Hindu.
   So far the courts in Uttar Pradesh state, where the government
is headed by Gandhi's Congress Party, have declined to rule who
actually owns the property.
   The demonstrators in Faizabad vowed today to turn the Moslem
votes away from Gandhi in national elections scheduled Nov. 22, 24
and 26.
   ``After today, Moslems will not vote for Congress,'' said
Mohammad Azam Khan, an Uttar Pradesh state legislator from the
opposition Janata Party, or People's Party.
   Hindus make up about 83 percent of India's 880 million people.
While Moslems make up 11 percent of the population, they have voted
heavily for the Congress Party since India became independent from
Britain in 1947.
   With Gandhi facing a tough challenge this month from Vishwanath
Pratap Singh, leader of the National Front coalition, the Moslem
vote could be pivotal.

   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today
interrupted his visit to Poland and flew to Berlin after East
Germany's historic decision to open its borders to the West.

chief Egon Krenz, but there was no official word on whether such a
session would take place.
   The state PAP news agency reported in a brief dispatch that Kohl
left Warsaw in the early afternoon.
   Other top West German officials planned to join Kohl for a
ceremony in front the Schoeneberg City Hall in West Berlin, the
spot where President John F. Kennedy made his famous ``Ich bin ein
Berliner'' speech in 1963.
   Hans Klein, Kohl's spokesman, told reporters the chancellor
would return to Poland on Saturday to conclude his visit.
   East Berlin announced suddenly Thursday it was opening its
borders and allowing its citizens to leave. Thousands of East
Germans immediately swarmed into West Germany through the open
Berlin Wall and at other crossings.
   Earlier Thursday, Kohl said West Germany ``could be ready to
offer significant economic aid if the will to reform manifested
itself in East Germany.''
   In addition to opening his country's borders, Krenz said the
country would hold democratic elections, but it was not clear if
the elections would include parties competing with the ruling
Communists.
   Kohl also said he had discussed with U.S. officials the
possibility of housing mounting numbers of East German refugees in
U.S. facilities in West Germany.
   His six-day visit here was intended to move the World War II
enemies closer to reconciliation. The developments in East Germany,
however, drew attention away from the economic issues expected to
be the focus of the summit.
   The developments have fueled Polish fears about German
reunification and have forced long-simmering border issues to the
forefront of Kohl's visit.
   ``Creation of a superpower in the heart of Europe is not a
neutral concern for the future of a whole Europe,'' said Polish
deputy goverment spokesman Henryk Wozniakowski.
   ``Certainly Poland is now looking more seriously on the
possibility'' of German reunification, he said.
   Wozniakowski said Poland recognizes the sovereign rights of both
German states, ``but the question of reunification is not just a
German question. It is also a European question,'' he said.
   Combined with Polish fears of a new economic superpower were
worries over recent comments by West German conservatives that
reunification should be sought within the 1937 borders of the
German Reich. Those borders include large areas of what is now
Poland.
   A 1970 treaty between West Germany and Poland recognizes the
Oder and Neisse rivers as the western boundary of Poland, but a
reunified Germany would not be bound to those terms.
   Malgorzata Niezabitowska, spokeswoman for Prime Minister Tadeusz
Masowiecki, said the prime minister ``stressed that Polish people
must have certainty that the question of borders be settled
permanently.''
   Kohl also met with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, the driving
force behind the trade union movement's rise to control of the
government.
   The West German leader came to Poland with a billion-dollar
economic package that is crucial for the new government to make the
difficult transition toward a market-oriented economy.
   Mazowiecki's government has asked for huge amounts of Western
economic aid, saying it is needed to safeguard the transition to
democracy.

<HEAD>Architectural Preservationists Fear Needless Demolitions After Quake</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many of the beloved Victorian buildings
that give the city its charm are in jeopardy, say preservationists
battling to have the quake-damaged structures repaired instead of
razed.
   Hundreds of the beauties that survived the 1906 quake may not
make it through 1989, the preservationists charged Thursday, saying
city regulations aimed at getting unsafe buildings torn down may
force property owners to take ``precipitous action.''
   Mark Ryser, executive director of the Foundation for San
Francisco's Architectural Heritage, criticized the city's procedure
for inspecting damaged buildings. He spoke at a news conference in
front of Saint Dominic's Church, where workers were removing a
tower damaged in the Oct. 17 quake,
   He said owners are not being given time to consider
rehabilitation in lieu of demolition, and said structural engineers
doing voluntary inspections for the city may lack the expertise to
adequately assess building hazards.
   City officials defended the inspection and notification process.
   ``We haven't torn down that many buildings, only those that pose
an imminent life hazard or are a danger to adjacent property,''
said Public Works Director Richard Evans. ``I'm tired of people
taking potshots at the process, because it's a good process.''
   Although some buildings were razed immediately after the quake,
Deputy Mayor of Housing Brad Paul said recent efforts have focused
on rehabilitation.
   More than 1,400 housing units are in buildings that have been
``red-tagged'' by the city, requiring owners to promptly shore up
or demolish the buildings, Paul said.
   An additional 3,647 units are in buildings with limited access,
he said, adding that total replacement costs are estimated at close
to $200 million.
   Kathryn Burns of the National Trust for Historic Preservation
estimated that up to 500 historic buildings may be threatened in
the seven-county area hit by the quake, which measured 7.1 on the
Richter scale.
   Fewer than 200 buildings in San Francisco are designated
landmarks, but about 2,000 more are in designated historic
districts, said Ryser.
   To help increase options for property owners, the Trust has
established a special low-interest loan program for owners of
quake-damaged historic buildings. The funds would be available to
stabilize buildings while rehabilitation assessments are made, she
said.
   Emergency legislation to prevent the demolition of any buildings
not in imminent danger of collapse was signed by Gov. George
Deukmejian on Monday.
   ``Natural disasters cannot serve as a pretext for rash decisions
to destroy important relics of California history,'' said State
Sen. Milton Marks, who sponsored the legislation.
   Preservationists are worried about residential neighborhood
buildings as well as public buildings.
   As an example, Ryser cited a 1908 building on Front Street that
he said was needlessly razed. Although the front of the building
was a public hazard and had to be removed, the entire structure did
not have to be demolished, he said.
   Unnecessary demolitions may occur because owners are not aware
of rehabilitation options, cannot get qualified engineers to
inspect the property within city-ordered time limits, or believe
demolition is mandatory, Ryser said. He conceded that some owners
may be looking for a ``convenient rationale'' to tear down unwanted
property.
   A new city ordinance allows tenants who fear that landlords are
unfairly trying to remove rental units from the market to call in
an independent structural engineer to assess quake damage, Paul
said.

<HEAD>Moslem Fundamentalists Gain Largest Bloc In Jordan's Parliament</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN MARRIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslem fundamentalists, many of them
campaigning under the slogan ``Islam is the solution,'' won the
biggest bloc of seats in Parliament during this kingdom's first
general election in 22 years.
   The result was an apparent setback for King Hussein, who urged
voters not to mix religion with politics in Wednesday's vote.
   Fundamentalist candidates captured 34 of the 80 seats in
Parliament, according to results announced Thursday.
   About 20 seats were won by pro-government candidates, while
leftists, Arab nationalists, tribal leaders and others took the
rest. The breakdown gave opposition forces a clear majority over
strict loyalists.
   For the first time, women were allowed to vote and seek office,
but none of the 12 females among the 647 candidates won a seat.
   ``The people want Islam, and it is not strange for our country
and our people to have such a large number of Moslem candidates
winning,'' said Ziad Abu Ghanimeh, a spokesman for the Moslem
Brotherhood, the largest Islamic organization.
   The Brotherhood called for more social welfare programs to help
the poor and for a Palestinian state on Israeli territory.
   Its 26 declared and several undeclared candidates held the
largest rallies in the campaign, including one in Amman attended by
about 5,000 people.
   Though the fundamentalists have often allied themselves with
Hussein, they have also prodded him to embrace a stricter version
of Islam with restrictions on Western-type entertainment, more
social welfare programs and greater separation of the sexes.
   The new Parliament seems certain to be more assertive than the
legislature dissolved last year, although Hussein retains ultimate
power.
   Parliament must approve all laws and can dissolve Cabinets. But
the king can dissolve Parliament and rule without it, and he has
done so for much of the past 15 years.
   The winners included Mansour Murad, who was convicted of
participating in a 1969 attack on an Athens office of the Israeli
state airline El-Al. The attack killed a Greek child and wounded 11
people.
   He was freed in 1970 in an exchange for 55 hostages aboard a
hijacked Olympic Airways jetliner.
   During the campaign, many candidates who went on to win seats
demanded prosecution of former officials accused of corruption and
economic mismanagement.
   The nation has a foreign debt of $8.3 million, and financial
hardship led to four days of rioting in April.
   The election formalized Jordan's separation from the West Bank,
which held half the seats in the Parliament that was elected two
months before Israel captured the territory in 1967.
   Last year, Hussein renounced Jordan's claims to the West Bank in
favor the Palestine Liberation Organization and dissolved
Parliament.

   The admission sheet checking Al Capone into a
Pennsylvania prison sold for $6,875 at an auction of memorabilia of
the famous and infamous.
   The admission sheet, signed ``Alphonse Capone,'' was bought
Thursday by a Pennsylvania collector, said Herman Darvick, owner of
the Herman Darvick Autograph Auctions. On it, the gangster is
listed as ``Alphonsus Capone alias Al Brown alias Scarface,''
Darvick said.
   Capone was jailed at Eastern State Penitentiary in 1929 after
arranging his own arrest on gun possession charges to protect
himself from George ``Bugs'' Moran, whose gang was largely wiped
out that year in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.
   Capone's occupation is listed as ``Paper &amp; Leather Cutter
(Bootlegger)'' and the entry for last employment reads simply ``in
business for himself.''
   The auction at a hotel included a signed photograph of Adolf
Hitler that attracted $2,200 and one of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s last
Christmas cards, signed in November 1963, which sold for $3,300.

   World leaders today praised East Germany's opening
of its borders, with some predicting the eventual dismantling of
the ``hideous construction'' _ the Berlin Wall _ and the
reunification of Germany.
   The United States, Britain and France offered their military
camps in West Germany to handle the expected flood of emigres.
Czechoslovakia, which had become the gathering point for East
Germans fleeing West, breathed a sigh of relief.
   Britain's prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, called it ``a great
day for freedom'' and said Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
the architect of East bloc reforms, had made it possible.
   Willy Brandt, a former West German chancellor and the West
Berlin mayor when the Berlin Wall went up in 1961, said he believed
prospects for German unity had taken a major step forward.
   ``The Berlin Wall will come down, and Berlin will live,'' Brandt
told The Associated Press.
   ``It seems appropriate that this hideous construction, which
never should have been built, has now definitely lost it reason for
being,'' said Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen of Denmark.
   ``It wasn't just the landscape of European politics which
suddenly changed last night. It was the European cosmos,'' wrote
political columnist Neal Ascherson in the London newspaper The
Independent.
   ``For most West Europeans now alive, the world has always ended
at the East German border and the (Berlin) Wall: beyond lay
darkness and demons. The opening of the frontiers declares that the
world has no edge any more. Europe is becoming once more round and
whole,'' he wrote.
   Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said the move was ``one of
the most memorable events in the political history of Europe.''
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada said it was ``one of the
most powerful statements'' about the strength of democracy.
   Not everyone was so impressed. Finnish Prime Minister Harri
Holkeri told Finnish radio, ``As far as I can see, the final
outcome of World War II still stands and the situation will not
change because of these developments.''
   The superpowers were relatively subdued.
   President Bush said if East Germany makes good on its promise to
allow free emigration, ``This wall built in '61 will have very
little relevance.''
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov praised
East German reforms but said any speculation about a reunified
Germany is ``out of the question.''
   The U.S. ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance,
William H. Taft IV, agreed. He also told reporters in Portugal that
the changes under way in Eastern Europe increase the risk of
instability.
   Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry spokesman Lubomir Marsik said the
opening of the East German border ``represents a positive
solution.'' ``The situation was getting difficult for everybody,
including Czechoslovakia,'' he said, referring to the thousands of
East Germans who previously were forced to go West via a third
country, often Czechoslovakia.
   In an interview on French radio, French Foreign Minister Roland
Dumas said the reforms will probably change ``the global balance.''
   He tied them to rapid changes also sweeping Hungary and Poland.
``We have the duty first of all to assume responsibilities in
aiding these countries,'' he said.
   The Times of London headlined its report: ``The Iron Curtain
Torn Open.''
   Mrs. Thatcher said: ``We all hope this is only the prelude to
the dismantling of the Berlin Wall'' but added that the priority
must be to see a ``genuinely democratic'' government in East
Germany.
   She, Bush and French Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement
offered the use of their countries' military camps in West Germany
to temporarily house any flood of emigres.
   Spain's foreign minister, Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, said the
opening of the border was a ``step full of hope'' that will likely
lead to further reforms.
   In Japan, Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe told foreign
journalists today: ``The Berlin Wall has in substance been lifted,
and it has great historical significance.''
   In South Korea, governing party spokesman Park Hui-Tae used the
occasion to prod Communist North Korea.
   ``On the occasion of East Germany's border opening, North Korea
is urged once again to make active efforts to conduct exchanges
with South Korea and open up its doors in keeping pace with the
tides of the time,'' he said.
   The European Community in Brussels pledged to seek closer trade
relations with the government in East Berlin.
   Calling Friday's events in Berlin reason ``for profound
rejoicing throughout Europe,'' The EC's external affairs
commissioner, Hans Andriessen, said he would contact the East
German government ``to explore areas of mutual interest and
support.''

   A Soviet spokesman said today that East Germany's
decision to open its borders was well received in the Soviet Union,
but he reiterated the Kremlin's opposition to reunification of
Germany.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, chief spokesman for the Soviet Foreign
Ministry, called the East German government's throwing open of its
borders ``a sovereign act'' of East Germany, reiterating the
Kremlin's determination not to interfere in the internal affairs of
its East Bloc partners.
   But he reminded Soviet and foreign reporters at a Foreign
Ministry briefing, ``The border still remains, though some might
think it ceased to exist.''
   East Berliners streamed into West Berlin today following joyous
overnight celebrations after East Germany opened its borders.
Thousands of East Germans also crossed into West Germany along the
nations' frontier.
   Gerasimov cited a statement by East German leader Egon Krenz at
a Nov. 1 press conference in Moscow at which Krenz said the border
exists ``due to other reasons'' and not for the purpose of
interfering with contacts between people.
   Krenz pointed out then the Berlin Wall marks the division
between political systems as well as between the military alliances
of East and West.
   Gerasimov said the border opening was part of the ``wide
democratization of life'' taking place in East Germany, where the
recent replacement of hard-line communist leader Erich Honecker
touched off a popular rush toward reform.
   ``These are not separate acts but full-scale measures embracing
the whole of life of the GDR (East Germany) and its contacts with
the outside world,'' the Soviet spokesman said. ``The measures that
have been taken were welcomed'' in East Germany, ``and there was
also a positive reaction abroad, including in the Soviet Union.''
   But Gerasimov said West Germany ``should take into account that
policies aimed at reconsidering borders would not suit any
government in Europe and would cause only mistrust.''
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnandze today also welcomed
the opening of East Germany's border to the West, Swedish
journalists meeting with the envoy in Moscow reported.
   Shevardnadze was quoted as saying the Kremlin had nothing to do
with the decision to open the gates in the Berlin Wall, which he
said was an internal affair.
   ``It was decided by the comrades in Berlin,'' he said. ``This
was a reasonable and sensible decision,'' he said, and he described
the developments as ``a normal process'' toward greater democracy
in East Germany.
   ``The new course in East Germany echos the mood among the people
in East Germany. It also corresponds to our own interests,'' he
said, according to a report by the Swedish national TT news agency
and Swedish Radio in Stockholm.
   Shevardnadze, who met the reporters accompanying Foreign
Minister Sten Andersson, said people should be helped to reunite
with relatives or to travel abroad for other reasons, and said he
was undisturbed by the sight of tens of thousands of East Germans
flooding across the frontiers.
   ``Its not abnormal for people to leave their countries.
Sometimes they return,'' he said. ``Twenty thousand people leave
the Soviet Union every year. That in itself is not unusual.''
   He also said Moscow was not worried that the swift pace of
events in East Europe would threaten global stability.
   The events in East Germany have been covered on Soviet
television and in the press but with little editorial comment.
   Tass, the Soviet news agency, reported the opening of the
borders without delay.
   The Soviet Union in the past two years has eased the strict
control of its borders and now grants thousands of exit visas a
month to Soviet citizens wishing to travel abroad or emigrate. But
relatively few Soviets are eligible to emigrate under present law.
   A bill before the legislature would grant all citizens the right
to come and go as they please _ except in cases when the state
determines national security might be threatened. But the measure
is still up for debate.

<HEAD>Longtime Erie, Pa., Mayor Steps Down Because of Rare Illness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ERIE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After nearly a quarter-century in office and
more than two years of battling an incurable disease, Mayor Louis
Tullio is stepping down and has appointed an aide to fill the
remaining seven weeks of his term.
   Aides delivered a letter to the Erie city clerk today saying the
six-term mayor has appointed Patricia Liebel, a longtime assistant,
acting mayor effective immediately.
   ``We'll do the best we can. This is the way the mayor wants
it,'' Ms. Liebel said late Thursday.
   Ms. Liebel, who lost a bid to win the Democratic mayoral
nomination in the May primary, will fill the post only until Dec.
31. Two-term Councilwoman Joyce Savocchio, who was elected mayor
Tuesday in this northwestern Pennsylvania city of 120,000, takes
over then.
   Tullio suffers from amyloidosis, a rare and fatal disease that
deposits proteins in the heart, kidneys and other major organs. The
illness has weakened Tullio's heart and lungs amd confined him to
his home since May. Pittsburgh Mayor Richard Caliguiri died of the
same illnesss in May 1988.
   Over the summer, several City Council members called for Tullio
to appoint an acting mayor because of his illness.
   ``He had held off on naming an acting mayor because he hoped to
return one day to the job he so loved,'' Grace Tullio, the mayor's
wife, said late Thursday. ``But now he wants the work on the budget
and the transition to Joyce Savocchio's administration to go as
smoothly as possible.''
   Tullio technically will continue as mayor, receiving full pay
and benefits, and said he would provide input into matters of city
business.
   Ms. Liebel, who has been Tullio's top aide since he took office
in 1966, was to meet today with Mrs. Savocchio to discuss the
transition.
   ``I promise to work with Pat Liebel and the administration over
the budget in this difficult time for the city,'' said Mrs.
Savocchio, a Democrat.
   Tullio assumed office 24 years ago after defeating incumbent
Republican Mayor Charles Williamson.

<TEXT>
   An civil rights group has asked the army to
investigate reports of soldiers forcing Palestinians to perform
``ridiculous and humiliating tasks'' such as singing army songs and
sweeping the streets.
   The Association for Civil Rights in Israel has asked the army's
legal adviser to stop the ``manifestly illegal'' practice in the
Ein Bet al-Ma refugee camp in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said
Dan Simon, the group's lawyer.
   ``They force the inhabitants to perform ridiculous and
humiliating tasks such as sweeping streets, washing the streets,
and so forth,'' said Simon.
   ``It's usually done in the middle of the night,'' he said. ``The
people are called out, their ID cards are taken away from them and
returned at the end of the work.''
   Israeli officials said today that a preliminary check indicated
soldiers made residents of the camp clean up rubble from tires set
on fire demonstrators.
   ``There's no initial indication of improper behavior by the
soldiers, but the story is being investigated,'' said an army
spokesman, who by Israeli army regulations cannot be identified.
   Simon said the army legally can force Palestinians to remove
roadblocks put up by demonstrators and to erase graffiti and can
confiscate their identification cards while they do the work.
   But forcing Palestinians to clean streets and pick up cigarette
butts and pebbles is ``manifestly illegal,'' he said. He also
complained that six residents were made to march around the camp
singing an Israeli army song one night last month.
   ``What we expect to hear is what the army is doing to make sure
these things do not reoccur,'' he said.
   Simon said he probably will petition Israel's Supreme Court if
the army does not take action. He said the practices were ``a local
kind of initiative'' and were not widespread.
   Also today, Arab reporters said Israeli soldiers wounded a
12-year-old boy in the Gaza Strip. Army officials said they were
unaware of any such incident.

   Prosecutors indicted six radical
students today in connection with an attack on the U.S.
ambassador's residence last month and ordered a nationwide manhunt
for four other suspects.
   Government prosecutors said criminal charges were filed against
Jung Chung-rae, a senior at Seoul's Konkuk University, and five
others as a result of the Oct. 13 attack on the residence of U.S.
Ambassador Donald Gregg in Seoul.
   The six students are accused of climbing over a stone wall,
hurling homemade bombs at guards, and smashing artwork and windows
in Gregg's living room. He and his wife escaped unharmed.
   Charges against the six ranged from violent acts to attempted
arson.
   The prosecutors said heavy penalties would be demanded for the
students, calling their attack ``an unforgivable terrorism hurting
our national interests.'' They said four other suspects were sought
in the attack.
   Dissidents contend Gregg helped support military rule when he
was CIA station chief in Seoul in the 1970s.

   A Nicaraguan rebel leader today spurned a
government proposal for his forces to disband and instead vowed at
the first peace talks in 16 months to ``put an end' to the regime
in Managua.
   Chief Contra negotiator Enrique Bermudez, just before heading
into the second day of talks today, said he had reason to ``doubt
the sincerity'' of the Sandinista offer of a truce and amnesty.
   Bermudez said the Sandinistas did not offer a true amnesty but
merely offered to release political prisoners from jail, stopping
short of restoring their civil and political rights.
   Talks between the U.S.-backed Contra rebels and the Sandinista
government opened Thursday. Nicaragua's foreign minister said
before the talks that if the rebels agreed to demobilize, his
government would meet their demands for a truce and amnesty.
   The Contras countered with a plan to restore the cease-fire with
the government, which was called off last week, and discuss other
conditions _ such as demobilization _ later.
   Neither proposal was accepted, despite the urging of U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to renew the cease-fire
that President Daniel Ortega ended.
   An estimated 12,000 people have been killed in the 8-year-old
war.
   Perez de Cuellar and his Organization of American States
counterpart, Joao Clemente Baena Soares, turned the mediation
effort over to aides.
   An election campaign is under way in Nicaragua under a regional
peace accord signed in August. The plan calls for free and fair
elections.
   Voting is set for Feb. 25, and U.N. observers say the campaign
is proceeding smoothly.
   Foreign Minister Miguel d'Escoto of Nicaragua said before the
meeting that key Contra demands would be met if demobilization
began by the end of November.
   Documents obtained by The Associated Press showed the Contras'
opening position calling for an immediate truce. The Sandinistas
would then declare a amnesty for the rebels by Nov. 20.
   The estimated 12,000 Contras camped in Honduras would then move
into Nicaragua, with their weapons, to join their comrades there in
secure zones.
   Diplomats said this would remove the pressure placed on Honduras
under the Central American peace plan to shut down the Contra camps
by Dec. 5.
   Only after these steps had been completed would discussion of
disbanding the Contras begin, under the rebel proposal.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco, who leads
Nicaragua's delegation to the U.N. meeting, rejected the Contra
proposal as presented.
   D'Escoto, waving a copy of Sandinista proposals, said the
Contras say ``they require three things; the three things are met
by what we are offering.''
   D'Escoto said the Nicaraguan delegation was willing to stay in
New York beyond the two days allotted for the talks and would be
flexible. ``This is a proposal, not an ultimatum,'' he said of the
Sandinista document.
   In Miami, the Contras announced formation of a new
``civilian-military commission'' to replace the old directorate,
several of whose members have resigned and returned to Nicaragua.
   Contra military spokesman Alejandro Acevedo said the U.N.
negotiating team led by Contra military commander Enrique Bermudez
had recognized the new commission, which includes only one of the
former directors, Aristides Sanchez.
   Ousted civilian Contra leaders compared the action to a coup.
   When Bermudez arrived for the U.N. meeting, he said: ``We expect
to re-establish the cease-fire and put an end to the totalitarian
government in Nicaragua.''
   In refusing to renew the cease-fire after 19 weeks, Ortega cited
increased Contra attacks in Nicaragua. Contra leaders denied the
rebels were attacking, which is forbidden by Congress while they
still receive U.S. aid.
   Congress ended U.S. military aid to the Contras in 1988, but has
continued non-lethal aid.
   Honduras, where most of the 12,000 Contras are encamped, and
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo of Managua are attending the peace
talks as observers.
   The last direct talks between the Sandinistas and Contras broke
down in June 1988. They agreed to a 90-day cease-fire during that
session, in March, and Nicaragua had extended it on a monthly
basis, with tacit agreement from the Contras.

<HEAD>Plant Accused of Polluting Says Closure Would Hinder Cleanup</HEAD>

   Operators of a rayon plant that supplies
the Pentagon say it must remain open in defiance of the state's
revocation of its waste water discharge permit so that it can clean
up pollutants.
   The State Water Control Board voted 6-0 Thursday to revoke the
permit of Avtex Fibers Inc.'s Front Royal plant effective
immediately. The water board said Avtex violated the permit by
discharging polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, into the Shenandoah
River.
   David A. Tousignant, the plant's president, told reporters an
orderly shutdown of the plant would take months and would halt the
company's efforts to clean up the toxic chemical.
   ``We can't let this happen. It's not in anybody's best
interest,'' he said.
   He maintained that an immediate shutdown is impossible and that
the company could not clean up the PCBs without continuing to
operate Avtex's waste water treatment facility, which discharges
into the river.
   ``If you're not operating, then you have no resources to do
anything,'' he said.
   Avtex lawyers failed to persuade Richmond Circuit Judge Theodore
J. Markow to stay the order and were considering an appeal to the
state's Court of Appeals, which was closed today for Veterans Day.
   Markow is to preside over a trial Wednesday of a state lawsuit
seeking closure of the plant and fines and damages against Avtex.
The permit revocation followed Markow's rejections of two state
requests to close the plant pending the trial.
   The company could be liable for as much as $10,000 a day in
fines for making illegal discharges, said Bert Rohrer, a spokesman
for the state attorney general's office.
   During two days of hearings last week, the attorney general's
office said state testing found as much as 3{ pounds of PCBs
flowing toward the river daily in August. The state said PCBs have
contaminated the plant site since a December 1985 leak of some 500
gallons of the highly toxic oils from an electrical transformer.
   The state has accused Avtex and the federal government of
knowingly allowing the pollution to continue, which Tousignant
denied.
   ``When we found out ourselves that we had a problem, we took
immediate action,'' he said.
   The federal government has worked for years to keep various
pollution and worker safety problems from shutting the more than
50-year-old plant, which is the only supplier of a carbonizable
rayon fiber used in rocket nozzles for the space shuttle and
nuclear missiles.
   Water board members said they were concerned about the nearly
400 employees at Avtex who could lose their jobs, but they were
more worried about the pollution.
   ``This was all brought about by actions and inactions on the
part of Avtex,'' said Donald M. Plotkin, a board member.
   Velma M. Smith, board chairwoman, said the board's investigation
showed Avtex knew it had violated its permit by discharging PCBs
long before it began cleaning up the toxins this year.
   ``Avtex did not take the issuance of a permit seriously,'' she
said.
   The public found out about the pollution in May, when state
officials warned people not to eat fish from the river.

   Zhivkov also resigned from the ruling Politburo, BTA said.
   The brief dispatch said the policy-setting Central Committee
formally thanked him for his ``long selfless service to the party
and the people.''
   Zhivkov was the longest serving leader in Eastern Europe, having
held the post of party leader since 1954.
   The Central Committee also proposed that Zhivkov be relieved of
his post as state president.
   It the was latest development to rock the East bloc during a
tumultuous year of social and political change. On Thursday, East
German leader Egon Krenz opened the Berlin Wall and other Western
borders in East Germany, the most breathtaking development in a
three-week whirlwind of reform.

   The opening of trading was delayed an hour today
at the New York and American stock exchanges because of a fire
beneath a building that houses a key computer system.
   A spokeswoman at the American Stock Exchange said a fire at the
building housing the Securities Industry Automation Corp. in lower
Manhattan's financial district made it impossible to process
information, delaying the usual 9:30 a.m. opening of stock trading.
   Trading at both the American and New York exchanges finally
opened at 10:30 a.m.
   A Fire Department spokesman said the blaze erupted in an
electrical vault below the building. The first alarm sounded about
8 a.m. and the fire was under control by about 9:45 a.m. It was
extinguished shortly after, the spokesman said. No injuries were
reported.
   The lobby and the second floor of the 53-story building were
evacuated, and some tenants on higher floors lost power. Light
smoke filtered into the building from the fire underneath, the fire
department said.
   John Lafayette, a spokesman for the Securities Industry
Automation Corp., said the fire did not affect trading systems, but
uncertainty about the power supply led the company to suspend
operations and switch to an emergency power source shortly before
stock exchange trading was due to begin.
   The fire disrupted trading in stock index futures at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, but other
trading went on as scheduled at the two exchanges.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, lauding East Germany's lifting
of travel restrictions as a dramatic advance for freedom, is
ordering ``all possible assistance'' to help West Germany cope with
the flood of refugees from its communist sister state.
   And Secretary of State James A. Baker III, reflecting today on
Thursday's border-opening decree by East German authorities, said
he hoped it would lead to greater freedoms. ``Hopefully, now
they'll move in the area of other freedoms. Hopefully we'll see
movement toward free and open democratic elections,'' he said on
``CBS This Morning.''
   Bush, boarding his helicopter today for a trip to Texas, waved
off questions about the fast-moving developments. Spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said, however, that the president intended to talk to
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl by telephone later today.
   In another TV interview, on ABC's ``Good Morning America,''
Baker said it was premature to talk about the reunification of
Germany because East Germany had a long way to go before becoming
truly democratic.
   ``There are some steps that have to be taken between just giving
people one of the basic human rights, the freedom to travel,
between that and addressing the question of reunification of
Germany,'' he said.
   Baker also linked Western financial aid to East Germany to
greater freedoms, including ``free and open'' elections. ``I think
it's going to be the view, frankly, of some of our other allies
that assistance will be much more forthcoming if the German
Democratic Republic (East Germany) moves toward true reform, in
terms of political pluralism across the board,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, the secretary said, ``I think it's the most
dramatic event in East-West relations since the end of the war.''
   Baker acknowledged that the speed of the East German action
caught U.S. officials off guard.
   ``Were we surprised by the speed of it? You bet your life, and
so was everybody else as far as I can determine,'' he told CBS. ``I
don't know anybody who suggested that they predicted this was going
to happen. It's a very good development. I'm not the least bit
ashamed of saying that the rapidness of it came as somewhat of a
surprise.''
   If East Germany fully implements the promise to open its
borders, Bush told reporters Thursday, ``this (Berlin) Wall built
in '61 will have very little relevance.''
   It was just 6{ months ago in a speech in Mainz, West Germany,
that Bush added his voice to the chorus of U.S. presidents who have
demanded that the Berlin Wall be torn down. He called it then a
``brutal wall'' that ``stands as a monument to the failure of
communism. It must come down!''
   Former President Reagan said on the ABC television show ``Prime
Time Live'' that ``If the wall isn't torn down immediately, at
least they could keep the gates open.''
   East Germany said it was opening its borders to the rest of the
world and that its citizens may travel or emigrate anywhere,
including through the 28-year-old Berlin Wall, erected at the
height of the Cold War between East and West.
   ``It's a dramatic happening for East Germany and, of course, for
freedom,'' Bush said.
   The White House announced Thursday night that Bush had ordered
U.S. military units and U.S. Ambassador Vernon Walters to give
``all possible assistance'' to the West German government
struggling to cope with the flood of refugees. The Pentagon said it
was making available housing for 980 people in three off-base
installations.
   Defense Department spokesman Glenn Flood said today there has
been no new West German request for additional assistance, and
there have been no new Pentagon offers of military assistance
beyond what was made Thursday.
   Other U.S. leaders reacted with a mixture of joy and surprise.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine called it a
``symbolic destruction of the Berlin Wall'' and urged East Germany
to ``take the final step and tear that wall down.''
   ``The events of today are truly remarkable,'' said Vice
President Dan Quayle.
   Bush, with Secretary of State Baker at his side and a map of
Germany open on his desk, said, ``We salute the people in East
Germany, whose aspirations for freedom seem to be a little more
down the road now.''
   Bush seemed subdued in an exchange with reporters summoned to
the Oval Office to hear his reaction to the latest startling news
from the East Bloc.
   ``I am not an emotional kind of guy,'' he explained. But he
added, ``I feel very good about it.''
   Bush said he was prepared to give ``maximum help'' to Bonn to
cope with refugees. Some 200,000 East Germans have fled their
country this year through Hungary, Czechoslovakia or other routes
West.
   But recalling his advice last spring to Poles to stay in their
homeland to work for democratic reforms, Bush said:
   ``These are Germans. And Germans love their country. And at some
point, I think a lot of Germans who have felt pent-in and unable to
move are going to say, `Look, we can move but wouldn't it be better
to participate in the reforms that are taking place in our own
country?'''
   Bush said that when he meets with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev next month in the Mediterranean, he would discuss
additional steps the United States might take to help spur change
in East Europe _ including possible restoration of long-denied U.S.
trade benefits.
   Sounding a note of caution, Bush said, ``I don't think any
single event is the end of what you might call the Iron Curtain,
but clearly this is a long way from the harshest Iron Curtain
days.''
   At a state dinner for Philippine President Corazon Aquino, Bush
told reporters he has sent a message to the West German government
saying he wants to talk to Chancellor Helmut Kohl when he returns
from a visit to Poland.
   Secretary of State Baker said East Germany's action is ``a very
welcome and positive and significant development. ... I don't think
anybody would have predicted (it) three or four days ago.''
   ``Hopefully, we'll see more steps toward freedom in East
Germany,'' said Baker. ``Once people taste the fruits of freedom,
you don't put the genie back in the bottle.''
   At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the odds of
military forces from East Germany being used against the West
appeared to be ``significantly lower now than at any time in the
postwar period.''
   Retired Army Gen. Bernard Rogers, who was supreme allied
commander in Europe from 1979 to 1987, gave a similar assessment on
NBC-TV's ``Today'' show this morning.
   ``I think that all indicators from at least 1987 on are that the
threat of war is reduced. At least that should be our perception at
the present time,'' Rogers said.
   Dean Rusk, who was President Kennedy's secretary of state when
the wall was erected, said, ``I never thought I would live to see
the day. The implications of it are very far-reaching.
   ``The West Germans may have a problem absorbing all the East
Germans who will want to move there, but that's something the West
Germans will just have to struggle with, said Rusk, now a law
professor at the University of Georgia.
   ``But it's obvious that in Eastern Europe several things have
been set in motion that are irreversible and that cannot be taken
back to the worst of the Cold War days.''

<TEXT>
   A pre-dawn Army shoot-'em-up _ complete
with machine gun fire, flares and soldiers racing through
civilians' yards _ has the sheriff, well, up in arms.
   The mock military attack came on Thursday at 4:30 a.m., a time
Sheriff Jay Printz said was totally inappropriate.
   Calls from terrified residents came in so quickly ``my lone
dispatcher couldn't get everybody's name,'' Printz said.
   ``One woman was so scared she was calling from the bathroom,
where'd she'd locked herself in,'' the sheriff said.
   Callers told of unidentified men firing automatic weapons and
shooting flares and warriors racing across the deck of a private
house, Printz said.
   The Army was ``essentially having a little war'' in an area just
outside Corvallis, which is south of Missoula in western Montana,
Printz said.
   Complaints focused on rude disruptions in the pre-dawn, trespass
on private property, spooked livestock bouncing off barbed-wire
fences and potential fires from flares on roofs, the sheriff said.
   Army officials refused to say anything other than there would be
an investigation of the complaints.
   Margaret Searle said her family thought it was a ``war zone''
outside. Her husband got his rifle and fired a round into a wood
pile to scare off the soldiers, she said.
   The woman said military investigators came by later and told her
the special forces troops were making a mock attempt to blow up a
fuel depot. She noted there are some fuel storage tanks a few
hundred yards from the family residence.
   Printz said he was told last summer that parts of ``Exercise
Knife Blade 90'' would occur in Ravalli County this fall. He was
never informed about specific operations but was promised they
would not be near residential areas, he said.
   He told military officials that if there's another similar
occurrence, deputies will be making arrests, Printz said.

<HEAD>BBC Broadcasts to China Being Jammed For First Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said Friday its
Mandarin-language broadcasts to China are being jammed for the
first time.
   ``There is no possible justification for this deliberate and
systematic interference with our broadcasts, although it clearly
indicates the impact the World Service is having inside China as
far as the authorities are concerned,'' said John Tusa, managing
director of the BBC World Service.
   The BBC said the interference typically starts a few minutes
before the Mandarin transmissions begin and stops shortly after
they end. It takes the form of a steady, low-frequency noise about
25 percent as strong as the program signal itself.
   The BBC said it did not know exactly how long the interference
had been taking place. There has been evidence of it since June but
it was only positively identified this week by a BBC engineer in
Beijing, it said.
   ``Jamming is a practice which violates established broadcasting
relations,'' Tusa said. ``This latest instance is particularly
regrettable at a time when jamming from all other Communist
countries has ceased.''
   The Soviet Union stopped jamming BBC Russian service broadcasts
in 1987 and lifted its interference with BBC Polish broadcasts a
year later.
   The BBC said World Service broadcasts in English are not being
jammed by the Chinese but it is still unclear whether Cantonese
language broadcasts are affected.
   The BBC said it stepped up its Mandarin broadcasts by half an
hour in early June to a total of three hours daily in response to
demands for coverage of the student-led demonstrations in China and
the government's crackdown.
   During the Beijing protests, students carried banners saying
``Thank you BBC'' and some wore BBC headbands.

   More than 36,000 people have turned themselves in
for economic crimes during a 10-week grace period that ended last
week, a senior judicial official said Friday.
   They included 9,300 Communist Party members and one vice
minister, and three people who embezzled more than $270,000, said
deputy chief prosecutor Zhang Siqing.
   The People's Supreme Court and prosecutor's office announced
Aug. 15 that all who turned themselves in before Oct. 31 for
economic crimes would be treated leniently.
   Those who confessed admitted receiving bribes and embezzling $94
million, and returned the equivalent of $56 million in ``ill-gotten
gains,'' the state-run Xinhua News Agency quoted Zhang as saying.
   Since the call went out in August, 17,600 government employees
confessed to receiving bribes and other actions ``in violation of
discipline,'' Xinhua said.
   Shanghai newspapers reported last week that factory bosses,
managers and midlevel business officials were among those who
surrendered during the campaign.
   Authorities have given a high priority to rooting out corruption
that has ballooned in recent years alongside the market-oriented
reforms of the past decade.

   Three East Germans had a little

across the border to Hamburg, but he agreed to do it anyway.
   Late Thursday night, Hamburg police noticed a taxi with East
German license plates cruising through the city, officials said

   ``The driver apparently didn't know his way around the city very
well, so police offered their assistance,'' said a Hamburg police
spokesman, who did not give his name.
   ``The passengers laughed and said they just visited'' an aunt in
Hamburg, the spokesman said. ``The only difficulty they had was
persuading the taxi driver that such a visit was suddenly possible
without any difficulties.''
   East Germany's Communist authorities on Thursday threw open the
borders with West Germany.
   The travelers said they were from the East German city of
Schwerin, 62 miles east of Hamburg, police said. Thy returned to
Schwerin after getting advice from police on the shortest route
back to their hometown.

<TEXT>
   A team of observers from the
Organization of American States dashed out of the voter
registration station and scrambled into a caravan of waiting
vehicles.
   In the confusion, some of them jumped into a U.N. jeep at the
curb and ordered the bewildered driver: ``Follow that caravan!''
   When the string of vehicles screeched to a halt at the next
station and the observers again jumped out, the U.N. driver peeled
off and returned to his employers, hoping they hadn't missed him.
   ``There are so many observers in this little country, you find
them in the soup,'' said a Latin American diplomatic source who
requested anonymity. ``But that is good. We'd rather have too many
than too few.''
   Foreign observers are swarming all over Nicaragua in such
profusion that the Foreign Ministry felt compelled to call a news
conference to explain who is doing what.
   There are observers for the electoral process leading to general
elections Feb. 25; observers to make sure the anti-Sandinista
rebels known as Contras disband; observers to a regional accord not
to arm guerrillas; and self-appointed observers of foreign
contributions to political parties.
   A 625-member force approved by the U.N. Security Council is the
latest addition to the battalions of observers in Central America.
They are to verify that Contras don't slip across the border from
Honduras into Nicaragua.
   ``Observing elections has become an industry,'' said British
government observer David Browning of Oxford University. ``But
who's observing the observers?''
   There are observer teams from the OAS, the United Nations, joint
commissions from both organizations, the European Parliament,
former President Jimmy Carter, one U.S. government foundation and
one private U.S. foundation.
   Apart from that, there are individuals and groups representing
the political spectrum descending on Nicaragua in droves. U.S.
congressmen come down singly or in clusters.
   ``It seems like we get one every weekend,'' said a Western
diplomatic source. ``I don't know the last time we had a full
weekend off.''
   OAS Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares headed his
organization's mission to observe the first Sunday of registration,
Oct. 1. He and his retinue visited 35 voter registration stations
in five communities within 12 hours.
   The confusion over the jeeps happened at one of those stations.
   In Nicaragua's severely depressed economy, observers are good
business. They need housing, food, transportation. They need office
space, drivers and secretaries.
   Housing in the Managua area, the center of operations for all
these groups, is scarce. The laws of demand and supply take over.
   Property rental agents are delighted. But the observer staff
members are not.
   ``I was shown the same house three times in one day, by three
different agents,'' said a U.N. observer. ``Every time the (rental)
price was different _ each time it was higher.''
   The observers' first job was to watch over voter registration
during the first four Sundays in October. It ended Oct. 22. The
United Nations and the OAS released reports calling the
registration process largely free and fair.
   Now their job is to keep watch over the campaigning and ensure
every one of the 21 legally registered parties in Nicaragua has a
chance to spread its message freely.

   State police were warned by the state's
chief justice six years ago to stop taping private conversations
between attorneys and their clients, but the taping continued, and
led to a federal lawsuit.
   The class action lawsuit filed Thursday names the state and 19
high-ranking state police officials allegedly involved in secret
taping as far back as 1980. ``Hundreds of thousands'' of
conversations may have been taped at about a dozen state police
barracks around the state, said Michael Koskoff, a lawyer who
called a news conference to announce the lawsuit.
   In 1983, former state Chief Justice John A. Speziale warned
police to stop tape-recording suspects' telephone conversations
with their lawyers.
   ``Eavesdropping by the police or their agents makes a mockery of
the right to consult counsel before being interrogated,'' Speziale
wrote in a 1983 ruling on a 1980 tape recording of a lawyer talking
to his client.
   The taping resurfaced inadvertantly Oct. 24 when a state trooper
testified at a hearing in a manslaughter case that a conversation
between the suspect and his attorney had been taped.
   Gov. William A. O'Neill on Tuesday ordered an investigation into
the taping policy, and Thursday, federal prosecutors asked Chief
State's Attorney John J. Kelly to turn over the 763 state police
tapes _ containing 18,000 hours of conversations _ that were
impounded when O'Neill opened the probe.
   State police claim the taping was done to ensure that emergency
telephone calls to the barracks could be replayed in case the call
was unclear or if someone had a complaint about the way a call was
handled.
   The taping posed a political problem for O'Neill, a Democrat up
for re-election next year. His adversaries in both parties called
on him to fire State Police Cmdr. Lester J. Forst, the lead
defendant in the case.
   The lawsuit seeks damages of at least $10,000 for each person
who joins the class action, and punitive damages under federal
racketeering statutes.
   ``If anybody made a phone call from the state police barracks
and spoke to someone other than a police officer, they can pretty
well assume their phone call was intercepted,'' Koskoff said at the
news conference. ``We even had information there were police
officers who didn't even know these phones were being tapped.''
   The lawsuit could overturn criminal convictions if the court
found an illegally taped conversation led to the conviction, said
Joseph Keefe, president of the 200-member Connecticut Criminal
Defense Lawyers Association, which filed the suit.
   ``People make the most damaging admissions when they're arrested
because they're upset,'' Keefe said, adding, ``I suppose nothing
should should shock us. But to violate the right to counsel, to do
that knowingly ...''
   Normally, police must obtain warrants to conduct secret wiretaps
or tape conversations. The taping also appears to have violated
privileged lawyer-client conversations.
   Forst has been on a hunting vacation in Alaska. O'Neill said
Wednesday he was not inclined to fire Forst, whom he hired in 1981,
before speaking with him.
   The state police is not the only department in Connecticut to
stand accused of secret taping. The Waterbury Republican reported
today that police in Torrington, a town north of 30,000 of
Waterbury, routinely taped conversations between prisoners and
lawyers and at least once refused a lawyer's demand that the taping
be stopped.
   Attorney John Logan said he helped another lawyer, John Del
Buono, get charges against a client reduced because tapes had been
made of Del Buono's conversations with the client a year ago even
though Del Buono objected.
    Torrington Police Chief Mahlon C. Sabo said he was unaware of
the taping until Thursday and it would be stopped. The department
makes tapes of all calls on the department's main business line,
and because of equipment shortages, the telephone that prisoners
use is hooked up to that line, he said.
   ``I'm embarrassed I didn't know,'' said Sabo, who's been chief
about 3{ years. ``I don't know why, and this (phone system)
certainly has been here a lot longer than I have.''

<HEAD>Philippine Leader Meets With Quayle, Nicaraguan Challenger</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 6 grafs new with meeting, picks up at pvs 2nd graf, Bush

   Philippine President Corazon had breakfast
today with Vice President Dan Quayle and U.S.-backed Nicaraguan
opposition candidate Violeta Chamorro, and a Quayle aide said the
administration hoped some of the visiting leader's popularity would
rub off.
   Mrs. Chamorro is in the United States this week seeking to raise
funds for her February election against leftist President Daniel
Ortega.
   A Quayle aide, Carnes Lord, said the two women _ both the wives
of slain national leaders _ discussed their common experiences in
entering politics.
   Asked if Mrs. Chamorro hoped to cash in on some of Mrs. Aquino's
popularity, Lord said, ``That was the idea, obviously.''
   He said the three-way meeting at the vice president's residence
had been suggested to Mrs. Aquino during Quayle's recent visit to
the Philippines.
   Mrs. Aquino is not dropping any clues about the fate of U.S.
military bases in her country, but President Bush says he is
confident an agreement will be reached for a ``long-term security
partnership.''
   Bush was effusive in his praise for Mrs. Aquino during meetings
at the White House on Thursday despite her reluctance to discuss
continued U.S. access to Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base.
   ``From Main Street to Wall Street, America loves the
Philippines. And America loves Cory Aquino,'' Bush said in
welcoming remarks.
   ``You deserve our help and you will get it. I pledge our
continuing assistance to your government, and that means security
assistance as well as aid to economic development,'' Bush said.
``And it means cooperating in your important debt-reduction
programs.''
   The future of the two massive bases is the most important _ and
most controversial _ issue on the U.S.-Philippine agenda.
   Leases for the facilities expire in September 1991, and the
United States regards them as a vital for projecting American
military power throughout Southeast Asian sea lanes and for
stability in the Pacific. They serve as a counterpoint to Soviet
naval forces based in Vietnam.
   Mrs. Aquino faces pressure at home to end the U.S. access. An
influential minority of Filipinos view the continued U.S. military
presence as an infringement on Philippine sovereignty and a vestige
of the former U.S. colonial administration.
   Before leaving Washington today, Mrs. Aquino planned to meet
with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. Then, she was heading to Dallas
to meet with officials of the large retailing chain, J.C. Penney, a
major importer of Philippine products.
   In a toast at a state dinner Thursday night, Bush lauded her
``monumental'' political and economic accomplishments and said her
country's revolution had inspired ``freedom-loving people
everywhere.''
   Mrs. Aquino, in a poignant reply, said, ``The Philippines is a
small country and cannot claim to affect directly events beyond its
borders; certainly not across half the world in Europe.''
   But, after reciting the ``startling'' changes underway in the
East Bloc, she said: ``Yet it is not too much to say that the
images of heroism spawned by our people power revolution gave
dominated peoples throughout the world a glimpse of certain
possibilities that they are now exploring _ the possibility, for
example, that armor and infantry do not exhaust the varieties of
power.''
   Mrs. Aquino told reporters after the dinner, ``Many times people
approach me in my travels abroad and say they are truly inspired by
what happened in the Philippines in 1986. I'm very glad we're
identified with something so noble and so pure.''
   Earlier at the White House, Bush noted that preliminary talks on
the bases will begin next month and said, ``We are confident we'll
mold a new and mutually beneficial long-term security partnership
in the future.''
   Steering clear of the basing issue, Mrs. Aquino emphasized the
themes of trade and investment.
   ``We will raise particularly the means by which the Philippines
and the United States can cooperate in more ways to our mutual
economic benefit. We shall explore the means to increase trade
between two countries with long historic ties and deep cultural
affinities.''
   It was her first visit to the White House since 1986 when she
received a tumultuous welcome after leading the successful campaign
to depose President Ferdinand Marcos, ending years of authoritarian
rule.
   ``Your leadership has made the Philippines a beacon of
democracy, worthy of imitation throughout the world,'' Bush told
Mrs. Aquino.
   In their talks, Bush mentioned the bases only in ``a passing
reference'' to next month's talks, said Richard Solomon, assistant
secretary of state for East Asian affairs. He said Mrs. Aquino
expressed no sentiment one way or the other.
   Mrs. Aquino pressed Bush for greater access to U.S. markets,
help in debt relief and U.S. investment in the Philippines, Solomon
said. He said she specifically mentioned U.S. quotas on textile and
sugar imports.
   U.S. and Philippine officials signed a $25 million aid agreement
Thursday to lay the groundwork for telecommunications,
transportation, energy and other infrastructure projects.
   While Congress rushed through a $200 million aid package for the
Philippines after Mrs. Aquino took office, there is less eagerness
now because some lawmakers believe economic reform and increased
trade would improve living standards there more than additional
economic aid.

<TEXT>
   People who bought tickets for airline flights
canceled by Braniff Airlines when it shut down operations this week
may be able to get refunds if their purchase was made with a credit
card, the FTC says.
   The Federal Trade Commission said consumers who charged tickets
for flights canceled by the airline may be able to use the
``billing error'' protections of the Fair Credit Billing Act to
avoid paying for the tickets.
   The commission recommended on Thursday that travelers with
canceled tickets send a written notice to the credit card issuer at
the address listed on their bill for inquiries about billing errors.
   The notice should include:
   _The person's name and account number.
   _Aa statement that payment is being withheld or a refund is
being requested because the bill contains an error.
   _A description of the error, including dollar amount and the
reference number of the ticket transaction.
   Consumers should keep a photocopy of the notice and send the
original by certified mail, return receipt requested, within 30
days after receiving the first bill that contains the ticket charge.
   The agency also suggested people keep the ticket in case the
card issuer later asks for evidence.

<HEAD>26 Cases of Blood Disorder Cited, Officials Probe Link to Amino Acid
Tablets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health officials are investigating whether
an outbreak of a rare blood disorder that has affected 26 people in
five states is linked to a dietary supplement taken for stress and
premenstrual syndrome.
   Twenty-one cases of eosinophilia have been confirmed in New
Mexico over the past two to three months, Dr. Millicent Eidson,
environmental epidemiologist with the state Health and Environment
Department, said late Thursday.
   She said an additional case has been reported in Arizona. The
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said a Missouri man and a
Mississippi woman are being treated for the disease, and an FDA
official in Denver said two cases have been reported in Oregon.
   At least 19 of the patients had been taking L-tryptophan, an
amino acid commonly taken to relieve premenstrual syndrome, sleep
disorders, muscle tension and stress. The non-prescription tablets
are sold under a variety of brand names in health food stores and
pharmacies.
   Eosinophilia occurs when there is an abnormally high number of
eosinophils, a type of white cell, in the blood. It has been known
to be fatal, although officials said there have been no deaths
among the recent 26 cases.
   Ms. Eidson said of the cases in New Mexico and Arizona, 17 were
among women. Sixteen of the 17 women and one of the five men had
taken L-tryptophan, she said.
   Teams from the federal Food and Drug Administration and the
Centers for Disease Control came to New Mexico on Thursday to
assist in the investigation.
   Dr. Edwin Kilbourne, chief of the Health Studies Branch of the
Division of Environmental Hazards and Health Effects at the CDC,
said the out-of-state cases ``raises the ante a bit.''
   Kilbourne, who planned to arrive in New Mexico on Monday, said
all agencies are being very cautious about making a connection
between L-tryptophan and the cluster of eosinophilia cases.
   ``The problem is an epidemic association and as far as I am
aware it is not very solid,'' he said.
   Ms. Eidson said the New Mexico and Arizona patients suffered
severe muscle pain and 10 were hospitalized. She said today that
one woman was still hospitalized early this week but she didn't
know if the patient has since been released.
   New Mexico health officials have asked retailers to halt sales
of L-tryptophan.
   Dr. Gerald Gleich of the Mayo Clinic said both the Missouri and
Mississippi patients had taken L-tryptophan.
   ``The thing that's unusual is seeing so many patients with the
same pattern,'' Gleich said. ``It's not like we haven't seen the
likes of this before. What's different is there are so many at one
time, and they're all taking L-tryptophan.''
   Dr. LeRoy Gomez, director of the FDA in Denver, said Oregon also
has reported two cases, but he could provide no details except that
one of the cases apparently involved L-tryptophan. He planned to
contact the FDA in Seattle to investigate the Oregon incidents.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II inaugurated the first
Vatican exhibit of Russian religious art Friday and said the icons
symbolized the roots of Christianity in Europe.
   He was guided through the exhibit of 107 medieval works by J.S.
Meldev, minister of culture for the Russian republic.
   Meldev noted that the exhibit opened ``on the eve of an historic
meeting,'' a reference to pope's scheduled audience with Mikhail S.
Gorbachev during the Soviet president's visit to Italy on Nov.
29-Dec. 1.
   John Paul nodded and smiled at the remark. In his speech, he
said:
   ``The art of the East and of the West is the expression of the
unique Christian spirit, and, in a manner of speaking, the
`breathing' of those `two lungs' of European Christianity, Western
and Eastern, which should contribute equally ... to the recovery of
the Christian roots of the European people.'' He also linked the
exhibit to last year's 1,000 anniversary of the introduction of
Christianity in what now is the Soviet Union. He said the
celebrations prompted ``a spontaneous ray of light, rich in further
promise and developments, which lead to hope of a deeper accord
between East and West.''
   Works on display, dating from the 13th to 18th centuries,
include faces of Christ, the Madonna and child, saints, and scenes
of Christmas and other religious celebrations. The exhibit, at the
Braccio de Carlo Magno in St. Peter's Square, opens to the public
Saturday and runs through Jan. 30.

<HEAD>Moslems Protest, Hindus Celebrate Over Shrine Site</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FAIZABAD, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested 1,000 Moslem protesters
Friday who tried to march to nearby Ayodhya, where celebrating
Hindus laid the foundation stone of a new temple at a site claimed
by both religions.
   The Moslem demonstration was peaceful, but Zafaryab Jilani, one
of its leaders, declared: ``When all these methods fail, arms are
taken up. The next generation may not listen to peaceful protest.''
   At least 290 people have been killed in Hindu-Moslem violence in
three Indian states since plans for the temple were announced in
August. No violence has been reported in Faizabad or Ayodhya.
   Protest leaders in Faizabad accused Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
and his Congress Party of giving in to Hindu fundamentalists in a
quest for Hindu votes in national elections set for Nov. 22, 24 an
26.
   ``If this ruling Congress Party is ousted from power, perhaps
secular government can be saved,'' said Jilani, a senior leader of
the All-India Babri Masjid Action Committee.
   Babri Masjid, the Mosque of Babar, was built in the 17th century
on the spot in Ayodhya where Hindu fundamentalists claim one of
their most popular gods, Lord Ram, was born.
   About 90 minutes after the arrests in Faizabad, Hindus
celebrated the laying of the foundation stone of a new Ram temple
130 feet from the Babar Mosque. They flung marigold petals into a
6-foot-deep hole in which their leaders reverently placed bricks
and the stone.
   Police wearing helmets and chest protectors struggled to keep
from falling into the pit as at least 5,000 pilgrims pushed into
the small, hilltop enclave in less than an hour.
   The dispute over the Ayodhya hilltop in Uttar Pradesh state is
centuries old and the current chapter began on a night in 1949,
when a Ram idol was spirited into the mosque. A court ordered the
mosque closed to people of both faiths in an effort to prevent
religious strife.
   In 1986, another court order opened the Babar Mosque, but only
to Hindus. That decision prompted riots across India in which at
least 200 people died.
   Currently, the argument centers on who owns the land where the
foundation is being laid. Hindus and Moslems agree the small plot
intended for the stone is owned by a Hindu, but the rest of the
landed needed for the temple remains in dispute.
   Although Moslems opposed construction of the temple, they agreed
they could not prevent the stone from being laid in the plot owned
by a Hindu.
   Late Thursday night, however, Moslem activists contended the
foundation site was spilling over to property they claim is Moslem.
   Courts in Uttar Pradesh state, where Gandhi's Congress Party
controls the government, have declined to rule who owns the
property.
   ``After today, Moslems will not vote for Congress,'' Mohammad
Azam Khan, an Uttar Pradesh state legislator from the opposition
Janata Party, said Friday.
   Azam, like Jilani, is a convenor _ a sort of senior organizer _
of the Babri Masjid Action Committee. Both were among those
arrested in Faizabad.
   The arrests were part of a uniquely Indian form of peaceful
protest in which people do something they know police will not
allow, such as marching to Ayodhya, thus inviting arrest. The
police oblige by rounding them up, generally with little or no
force.
   In Faizabad, the Moslems and at least 40 Hindu sympathizers
climbed willingly into freight-hauling trucks and waved as they
were driven to a police compound on the outskirts.
   At the compound, they sat on the ground listening to leaders
exhort them to preserve India as a secular state and vote Gandhi
and his party out of office.
   Moslems, who make up 11 percent of India's 880 million people,
have given the Congress Party strong support since India's
independence from Britain in 1947. Gandhi faces a tough challenge
from Vishwanath Pratap Singh, leader of the National Front
coalition, and the Moslem vote could be pivotal.

   Americans have lavished praise on
President Corazon Aquino during her visit to the United States, but
at home she faces declining popularity.
   ``From Main Street to Wall Street, America loves the
Philippines,'' President Bush told Mrs. Aquino at the White House
on Thursday. ``And America loves Cory Aquino.''
   But a recent survey of 300 Manila residents showed that only 35
percent were satisfied with their president. Two years ago, a
survey by the same pollster, the Social Weather Stations, indicated
a 77 percent approval rating for Mrs. Aquino.
   Bush's remarks were typical of the reception Mrs. Aquino has
received during her North American tour. She arrived in Canada on
Nov. 4 and traveled Tuesday to New York. After Washington, she is
to visit Dallas and Los Angeles.
   ``The attentive observer with an eye constantly cocked for
exquisite ironies would not miss this one: of apparent cheers for
the president on foreign soil and tears and jeers on her home
base,'' wrote columnist Rosario Garcellano in The Manila Times.
   Columnist Luis Beltran, traveling with Mrs. Aquino, noted the
enthusiastic welcomes she has received from Filipino expatriates in
North America.
   ``It is as if Filipinos abroad are caught in a time warp,''
Beltran wrote in The Manila Standard.
   National leaders often enjoy a more favorable image abroad than
at home, and Mrs. Aquino's aides routinely dismiss criticism as the
carpings of opposition groups jealous of power.
   But even her supporters acknowledge growing public disaffection
because of rising prices, crime, corruption, lack of basic services
and a failure to fulfill many of promises of the ``people power
revolution'' that ousted Ferdinand Marcos and brought Mrs. Aquino
to power.
   Much of the dissatisfaction stems from economic problems.
Despite a 6 percent economic growth, inflation has reached more
than 13 percent, with the greatest increases in food.
   The country's electric power system is in such deplorable
condition that the state-run National Power Corp., has begun a
system of two-hour rotating brownouts throughout Manila and Luzon
island to cope with the shortage.
   Public school teachers, Supreme Court staffers and other
government employees began a series of strikes this week over pay
demands and delays in receiving promised salary differentials.
   Crime is widespread, due in part to corruption within the police
and armed forces. There have been so many robberies of buses in
western areas of Mindanao island that the military has begun
providing armed escorts for vehicles.
   Police say the crime rate between January and September was 1.4
percent above the figure for all of last year. More than 15 percent
of all crimes reported took place in Manila.
   Critics also claim Mrs. Aquino tends to make grandiose promises
without keeping them. She promised justice to victims of a January
1977 incident in which troops killed 12 protesters. No one was ever
charged in the incident after the commission she established to
investigate effectively exonerated the troops.
   The senior officer at the scene, Brig. Gen. Ramon Montano, was
later promoted to major general and placed in command of the
national police.

<HEAD>Japanese Whaling Ship Leaves for Antarctic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first of Japan's four-ship whaling fleet left
Friday for the Antarctic, where officials say it will catch 300 of
the mammals as part of a research program conservationists call
commercial whaling in disguise.
   The ship, the Nisshin Maru No. 3, will arrive in the Antarctic
Ocean in December, where it will be joined by three catcher boats,
said Nobuyuki Yagi, a Fishery Agency official.
   Japan halted commercial whaling in the Antarctic at the end of
the 1986-87 season, during which it caught 1,941 whales. It then
began a program of research whaling which it says is aimed at
assessing whale stocks.
   Japan killed 273 small minke whales, a non-endangered species,
in the first year of the research program and 241 last year.
   In 1986, the International Whaling Commission imposed a
moratorium on commercial whaling to allow scientists to assess
whale stocks without the disruption caused by regular whaling
activities.
   However, under the organization's charter, member nations are
allowed to conduct research whaling whenever they wish.
   The official said Japan hopes its research will prove that
enough of some species remain to allow a resumption of limited
commercial whaling when the commission's moratorium comes up for
review next year.
   ``But judging from the current positions of the members of the
commission, it looks very unlikely that the ban will be lifted,''
he said.
   Japanese whaling officials have said that at least 825 whales
must be caught to make the research program scientifically
accurate, and the quota for the program's first year was initially
875. But strong opposition from international environmental groups
and other commission members led Japan to reduce the quota to 300.
   The meat obtained by the research program is sold for food, as
permitted under commission regulations.
   At an annual meeting of the 38-member commission in June, Japan
also asked for special permission to catch 320 minke whales along
its coast to ``alleviate the suffering'' of several whaling towns
where it said 789 people have lost their jobs because of the ban.
The request was turned down by the commission.
   Japan is the world's largest consumer of whale meat, and
officials say the food is an important part of the country's
culture.
   In the early 1960s, when Japanese whaling was at its peak,
whales provided 23 percent of all meat consumed in the country.
Since then, declining whale supplies have turned it into a
delicacy, and the Nisshin Maru is the only remaining processing
ship.
   Whaling officials say whales must be killed during the research
to accurately determine their age, sex, diet and health. But
anti-whaling groups say non-lethal research methods are available,
such as skin sampling.
   Minke whales, a smaller species, are currently estimated by the
IWC to number about 730,000, Yagi said.
   Norway and Iceland also conduct research whaling, but Iceland
has announced it will end its research whaling program at the end
of this season.

   Americans, Italians and others clambered up the
Berlin Wall on Friday to join Germans from both sides of the divide
in an exuberant celebration of East Germany's newly opened borders.
   ``I've seen this wall many times, and I'm glad to see it break
open,'' said Rick Mike, an American soldier who joined the hundreds
atop the graffiti-covered concrete barrier at the city's hallmark
Brandenburg Gate.
   ``It should have happened a long time ago, this freedom _ that's
what we're here for,'' said Mike, who is based in West Berlin.
   Two jackbooted Soviet soldiers standing guard at the massive
Soviet World War II memorial less than 200 yards to the west of the
wall watched impassively.
   Champagne bottles littered the base of the wall. On the other
side, scores of unarmed East German soldiers _ some grim, others
bemused _ kept an eye on the throng on top of the barrier. A nearby
brass band drowned out shouts and the milling crowd paralyzed local
traffic on the wall's west side.
   The celebrations began late Thursday when Communist authorities
threw open East German borders for the first time since the Berlin
Wall rose in 1961. On Friday, authorities said they would forever
lift all travel restrictions and begin knocking down a portion of
the wall.
   Mike, 20, and another American soldier, Edward Tolentino, 23, of
Chicago, said neither they nor the city had slept since the first
wave of East Germans began pouring into West Berlin.
   ``I worked midnight shift last night, and I'm going to work
midnight shift tonight, and I don't think I'm going to get much
rest in between,'' said Mike, of Waltham, Mass.
   Robert Davidson, a modern dancer from Seattle, said friends had
told him of East Germany's decision to permit its citizens
unrestricted travel abroad, ``and I still don't believe it.''
   ``I was sure the wall was here to stay at least till the turn of
the century,'' but the decision to permit free travel for East
Germans had now changed his mind, he said.
   Sergio Lauria of Rome said he felt anticipation mixed with the
joy of celebrants atop and near the wall.
   ``People are waiting for something,'' he said. ``This thing is
not over yet.''
   His neighbor, Giorgio Puzzilli, said he felt fortunate to be
visiting Berlin at this historic time.
   ``This is a very important moment,'' he said. ``You have to feel
for these people, who have been waiting for such a long time.''
   Jozsef Dudas, of Miskolc, Hungary, said he felt special empathy
for the East Germans.
   ``If it weren't for Hungary, this wouldn't have happened,'' he
said, alluding to his country's initial role in the exodus of East
Germans wanting to settle in West Germany.
   Since Hungary threw open its western border to Austria Sept. 10
to East Germans wishing to turn their back on the East bloc, more
than 50,000 of them have used Hungary as a springboard to the West.
Others have used Czechoslovakia and Poland.
   At Checkpoint Charlie, three miles down the wall, officials lost
count of how many East Berliners had crossed into West Berlin since
the border was opened. ``It must be tens of thousands,'' said one
West German border official. Early morning reports in West Berlin
spoke of about 50,000 people.
   East Berlin construction workers still wearing their hard hats
drank beer and toasted their first experience in West Berlin,
watched by about 200 curious Westerners.
   There were jubilant scenes at other border crossings and East
and West Berliners joined in a never-ending party they had been
awaiting for decades.
   The wall, which has divided Berlin and symbolized the division
of East and West for decades, was built to stop the flow of East
Germans fleeing to the West _ 2.5 million from 1949 until Aug. 13,
1961.
   More than 20,000 Berliners gathered Friday outside the
Schoeneberg City Hall in West Berlin, where President John F.
Kennedy proclaimed ``Ich bin ein Berliner'' on June 26, 1963.
   ``There are some who say that Communism is the wave of the
future. Let them come to Berlin,'' Kennedy said. ``And there are
some who say in Europe and elsewhere, `We can work with the
Communists.' Let them come to Berlin.
   ``And there are even a few who say that it's true that Communism
is an evil system, but it permits us to make economic progress. Let
them come to Berlin.
   ``Freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect.
But we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to
prevent them from leaving us.''
   Every president since has repeated Kennedy's plea to tear the
wall down.
   Former West German Chanellor Willy Brandt, mayor of West Berlin
when the wall went up in 1961, said prospects for German unity had
taken a major step forward with East Germany's opening of its
borders.
   ``The Berlin Wall will come down, and Berlin will live,'' Brandt
said.

<TEXT>
   Communist Party leader Todor Zhivkov
today stepped down after 35 years in power, longer than any current
Eastern European leader, in the latest upheaval in the Soviet bloc.
   Zhivkov, who molded Bulgaria into one of the Kremlin's most
loyal modern allies, was replaced by Foreign Minister Petar
Mladenov, the news agency said.
   Zhivkov, 78, also resigned from the ruling Politburo, and the
party's policy-setting Central Committee proposed that he be
relieved of his post as state president, the official BTA news
agency said.
   Mladenov, 53, has been foreign minister since 1971 and is
considered more open to reform than Zhivkov.
   The changes occurred at a Central Committee meeting.
   During the meeting, about 150 followers of the independent
Society for the Protection of Human Rights held a rally in a nearby
park, the latest gathering by a growing pro-reform movement. Police
vans were parked nearby, but officers did not interfere.
   Zhivkov had been rumored to be on his way out for two years, but
diplomats and dissidents said the leadership change at this
juncture was unexpected.
   They said they had expected Mladenov to be ousted from the party
leadership because he had reportedly angered party hard-liners by
pushing to hold an international meeting in Sofia last week, an
occassion that allowed independent groups to campaign publicly for
reform.
   Although Bulgaria had paid lip-service to reform, the leadership
has so far not implemented the kind of broad political reforms
enacted in Hungary and Poland, where the Communists have
significantly loosened their grip on power.
   Zhivkov gained ultimate power as Communist Party chief in 1954
with the backing of Bulgarian supporters of Josef Stalin, the
Soviet dictator. Two years later he sided with Nikita S.
Khrushchev, Stalin's successor and ideological foe.
   Dogmatic and conservative by temperament and training, Zhivkov
displayed surprising ability in smoothing over party dissent to
emerge with his leadership strenghtened.
   He began consolidating his power upon assuming the leadership,
purging opponents and sending the most dangerous ones into exile.
By 1964, his authority was firm enough to survive an
anti-Khrushchev backlash. A year later he emerged unscathed from a
conspiracy to remove him.
   The brief BTA dispatch said the Central Committee formally
thanked him for his ``long selfless service to the party and the
people.''
   It was latest development in a tumultuous year of social and
political change in eastern Europe.
   On Thursday, East German leader Egon Krenz opened the Berlin
Wall and other Western borders, the most breathtaking development
in a three-week whirlwind of reform in a country that was once so
resistant to Soviet-style reforms.
   Zhivkov's resignation comes exactly one week after thousands of
demonstrators rallied in the capital, Sofia, in the first known
pro-reform rally in postwar Bulgaria.
   Bulgaria has long resisted the reforms introduced by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but about a dozen small civil
rights groups have formed in recent months.
   Zhivkov and other senior officials had pledged to work toward
separating party and state functions and introducing a measure of
democracy by ammending the constitution.
   On Friday, a crowd estimated at up to 9,000 took part in a
demonstration that coincided with the last day of a 35-nation
conference on protection of the environment.
   Protesters reported chanted ``Democracy!'' and ``Glasnost!'' _
Gorbachev's policy of openness.
   No such demonstration has taken place in the Bulgarian capital
since the end of World War II.
   Radio Sofia reported today that the two main points on the
meeting agenda were the development of economic restructuring in
Bulgaria and a preliminary discussion on preparing the 14th
Communist Party congress, scheduled in November 1990.
   Diplomats here say there is growing awareness that economic
reforms, badly needed to revamp a stagnating economy, cannot be
carried out without some political changes.
   A report released by Zhivkov before today's meeting acknowledged
this.
   ``The real problem is to specify what changes will be introduced
in our political system, in the structure and way of functioning of
power, as well as in the party, by which we will move ahead the
political reform and bring it into conformity with the
restructuring of the socio-economic and intellectual life,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Communications Program Contains Provisions Troubling For West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY DUNPHY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A UNESCO commission Friday approved a program for
the first half of the 1990s containing provisions on global
communication and news distribution that are troubling to some
Western observers.
   The United States and Britain, which pulled out of the U.N.
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in the mid-1980s
in part over anti-Western bias, have said the agency's decisions on
communications will play a major role in determining whether they
return.
   Many old code words about protection of journalists and
government licensing and censorship powers are gone from the
proposed program. But the plan sets up an adversary relationship
between the media and the public by saying the public should be
educated to avoid manipulation by the media.
   It also reiterates the legitimacy of the new world information
and communications order, which Western opponents regard as a
threat to international reporting and news distribution.
   Dana Bullen, executive director of the World Press Freedom
Committee, said there were ``some welcome things'' in the new
program ``but UNESCO still has a way to go before it becomes a
beacon for press freedom.''
   The head of the U.S. observer mission Richard T. Miller
described the document as ambiguous and complex. He said it would
have to be reviewed before any decision on a U.S. return to the
organization after leaving it in 1985. British observers made
similar comments.
   Miller said the proposed strategy did not resolve the
controversy over the new world order but had positive references to
the independence of media, pluralism and diversity of opinion.
   The two nations, which between them provided 30 percent of
UNESCO's budget, had charged that the organization had become
anti-Western, spent too much and was poorly managed.
   UNESCO Director General Federico Mayor of Spain, who took over
as head of the troubled agency two years ago, has been trying to
remove references to this order from the communications program and
take a new direction.
   But the 50-nation Executive Board, where Third World and East
bloc nations have a majority, have watered down Mayor's proposals
and resurrected controversies on communications that have been
debated at UNESCO since the 1970s.
   Canadian spokesman Tom McPhail said Mayor could be proud of the
outcome because ``under his leadership freedom of the press has
returned to the halls of UNESCO.''
   Many media specialists maintain the concept of a new world
information and communication order has become outmoded, given the
substantial progress in communications technology in the past 10
years. They said the way to remove imbalances is to strengthen the
communications capabilities of developing countries.
   But Third World nations believe there still are imbalances in
the flow of information to them, with a dominant role for Western
media.
   These nations, led by Senegal and Yugoslavia, succeeded in
getting several references in the program to their charge that
Western media report about them in a false and distorted way.
   The program was approved by consensus, that is without a vote,
after three days and nights of lengthy, sometimes tense debate.
   It now goes before the General Conference of the 161-nation
UNESCO, which is expected to approve it next week before
adjourning. The conference is the agency's highest decision making
body and meets every two years.

   Armed Sikh separatists stormed one of the
country's most prestigious engineering colleges before dawn Friday,
killing 19 students sleeping in a dormitory, police said.
   The militants, armed with Chinese-made AK-47 rifles, entered
Thapar Engineering College and knocked on the door of the
dormitory, said a police spokesman. When one of the students opened
the door, the gunmen opened fire, he said.
   Police said the gunmen were believed to be Sikh extremists
fighting for an independent homeland in Punjab, a rich farming
state on the northern border with Pakistan.
   ``When I awoke, I saw a man with a gun firing
indiscriminately,'' student Umesh Benjamin said from his bed in
Patiala's Rajendra Hospital. ``Before I could get up, I was hit by
a bullet and then I don't know what happened.''
   At least 16 people died instantly and three died later of their
injuries. Five other students remained hospitalized, doctors said.
   The victims were from colleges in neighboring states who had
come to attend the school's annual youth festival, said the police
spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   The attack occurred at 2:30 a.m., hours before Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi arrived in Chandigarh, the capital of Punjab, for a
brief visit. Gandhi made no public statement on attack.
   Patiala, in southern Punjab, is about 45 miles southwest of
Chandigarh.
   The Thapar College, one of the best known institutions in
northern India, has about 1,500 students. About 200 others had come
for the youth festival.
   Sikh extremists have killed at least 1,544 people this year in
their bid to carve out a separate homeland they want to call
Khalistan, or ``Land of the Pure.''
   The radicals allege Sikhs are socially and culturally
discriminated against by the Hindu majority and the Hindu-dominated
government.
   Sikhs make up 2 percent of India's 880 million people but are a
slight majority in Punjab. Hindus comprise 82 percent of the
population.

<TEXT>
   A civil rights conference this weekend was
named in commemoration of an uprising on a slave ship 150 years ago
but is as concerned with the future as it is with the past, an
organizer said.
   ``We've achieved great advances in expanding citizenship rights.
But we still have a long ways to go in achieving educational equity
and economic first-class citizenship,'' said Lawrence N. Powell, a
Tulane University history professor and chairman of the Amistad
Civil Rights Conference.
   The west African tribesmen who took over the Spanish schooner La
Amistad _ ironically meaning ``Friendship'' _ won the first U.S.
legal victory for freedom for African slaves in 1841, two years
after their revolt in Cuban waters.
   The conference is the first major event of the Amistad Research
Center, keeper of the nation's foremost collection of black and
ethnic manuscripts and records, since it moved to Tulane University
in 1987.
   Speakers are to include Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, former U.S.
Labor Secretary Ray Marshall, Democratic National Committee
Chairman Ron Brown and senior Judge John Minor Wisdom, who wrote
landmark civil rights rulings for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in the mid-1960s.
   ``We thought of having some kind of family reunion, but decided
there's been enough of that and what we really need to do is
rededicate ourselves. ... We can't sit around and pat ourselves on
the back,'' said Powell.
   New Orleans became host of the conference as a result of former
Mayor Ernest Morial's success in persuading the city's colleges and
universities to form a consortium to support bringing the Amistad
collection to Tulane.
   The collection started when the American Missionary Association,
which traces its history to the Christian abolitionists who carried
the Amistad case to the U.S. Supreme Court, asked a young history
teacher to organize the files he'd used for his doctoral
dissertation.
   Clifton Johnson organized the files in 1966 and remains
Amistad's executive director.
   ``We probably have the largest collection in the world on
African-Americans in civil rights in the United States. Our
collection of manuscripts numbers more than 10 million pieces,''
said Johnson.

   A woman was buried Friday in the back of her
beloved red Cadillac convertible, said funeral home officials.
   Aurora Schuck told her husband, Raymond, about 10 years ago that
she wanted to be buried with her 1976 Cadillac, so Schuck bought 14
plots at the Riverview Cemetery.
   ``The casket is going to be placed on the back of the car. The
top's down, so it will just be placed on that, across the back,''
said a spokesman for Rullman Funeral Home who would not give his
name.
   Mrs. Schuck, a native of Cuba, died Tuesday of cancer at age 62.
   Terry Adams, superintendent of the cemetery, said the cemetery
board had approved the unusual burial.
   A construction company dug a grave large enough for the car. The
Cadillac was lifted with a crane and placed into a vault, which
measured 27 feet by 12 feet and was 6 feet deep, Adams said.

<DATELINE>ABADAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An army of technicians working around the
clock is repairing what was once the world's largest oil refinery,
heavily damaged in the war with Iraq and now playing a key role in
Iran's reconstruction.
   Collapsed oil-storage tanks crumpled into rusting shapes, miles
of twisted pipes, wrecked workshops, and refining equipment
peppered with shrapnel holes can be seen everywhere in the
6-square-mile Abadan complex near the Persian Gulf.
   ``The refinery was set on fire and burned for days at the start
of the war when it was shelled by the Iraqis from across the river
and raided repeatedly by their planes,'' said Farzad Oveisi,
Abadan's plant director.
   Oveisi boasted the refinery was partially reopened in April
after a crash five-month repair program, with no foreign help. It
is operating at about 40 percent capacity with 130,000 barrels
produced a day, earning $12 million a month.
   About 3,000 people work at the complex that once employed
12,000. Workers are laying more than 370 miles of new pipeline and
have repaired 45 storage tanks.
   ``We don't need any foreign assistance. We have all the
expertise necessary and our only need from abroad is specialized
equipment,'' he told foreign correspondents who visited Abadan
recently.
   Nonetheless, Tehran hotels are full of technical teams from
Europe and Asia working on reconstruction projects worth billions
of dollars.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani has ruled out direct U.S.
involvement, but some West European companies with teams working on
petrochemical and engineering projects are subsidiaries of
specialist American firms.
   Before the war broke out in September 1980, Abadan was the
biggest refinery in the world with a capacity of 630,000 barrels a
day.
   It was knocked out in the early days of the fighting, when the
Iraqis besieged the city. The refinery, within rifle range of Iraqi
positions across the Karoun river border, was hammered repeatedly
by artillery and air strikes.
   The restoration of Abadan was politically symbolic in the
post-war rebuilding. But it also eased the pressure on Iran's five
other refineries, all badly hit during the war.
   With a postwar reconstruction bill likely to top $400 billion,
every dollar from Iran's vital oil industry counts. Oil income this
year has been estimated at $12 billion, $2 billion more than
projected.
   Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh estimated that oil revenue in
the next five years will total $70 billion. On top of that,
Rafsanjani said last month he will seek up to $20 billion in
foreign investment in a five-year plan expected to start next
spring.
   Rafsanjani's move to encourage foreign financing marks an
important ideological shift in Tehran following the death of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini June 3 and the July 28 election of
Rafsanjani, leader of Iran's so-called pragmatists.
   Radicals are opposed to foreign involvement because they fear it
will dilute the Islamic revolution's fundamentalist principles.
   The level of foreign investment Rafsanjani seeks, subject to
parliamentary approval, is considered to be about the limit that is
politically acceptable right now, diplomats said.
   Rafsanjani has given top priority to the oil and gas industry,
with a major expansion of the gas sector, primarily for export.
Iran sits on top of an estimated 700 trillion cubic meters of gas,
the second-biggest reserves in the world after the Soviet Union.
   Aqazadeh said last month the government will invest $13.4
billion in foreign currency in the oil and gas sectors in the next
five years. Several new refineries and major petrochemical plants
are planned.

   Searchers picked through the rubble of a
suburban Atlanta apartment complex today, looking for clues to the
crash of a Navy jet fighter that exploded and slammed into the
buildings, leaving one man missing and feared dead.
   Four people were injured, including the pilot of the A-7E
Corsair II who ejected just before the crash Thursday evening, and
a pregnant woman and her 5-year-old child who were critically
burned.
   ``All the people are accounted for, except one occupant,'' Cobb
County Medical Examiner Joseph Burton said today. ``Unfortunately,
we're pretty sure he's in there.'' Four other people who had
originally been listed as missing were accounted for today.
   Earlier, Burton had said, ``If there are no fatalities, I'd call
it somewhat of a miracle.''
   The unarmed A-7E Corsair II crashed 2{ miles short of the runway
at NavalAir Station Atlanta, 15 miles north of Atlanta adjacent to
Dobbins Air Force Base, said Navy spokesman Kerry Honore. The pilot
was attempting to land at the air station when the crash occurred
at about 6:30 p.m.
   About 30 people at the Pine Hill Village Apartment complex were
left homeless. Burton said the missing man was believed to be the
sole occupant of an apartment, but he said he could not rule out
the possibility that a visitor also could have been with him.
   ``My first officer on the scene said he heard screams, but the
building was engulfed in flames and he couldn't get in,'' Police
Lt. J.L. Martin said.
   An initial sweep today looking for the missing man yielded
nothing, Burton said at midmorning, adding, ``He's not where you
can see him.'' Later, Smyrna Fire Chief Larry Williams said local
search crews had yielded for the time being to military searchers
who were looking mainly for clues.
   The crash site remained sealed off with police tape and Marine
Reserve guards. Police officer Frank Durrance, who had been inside
the complex, said the Navy jet struck the edge of a building before
crashing into a car and coming to rest by a chain link fence about
30 yards away.
   ``It's completely burned. It's just a big piece of metal. ...
The car was completely burned. You could tell it was a car, but you
can't tell that it was a plane,'' Durrance said.
   The Navy today identified the pilot as reservist Lt. Cmdr.
Robert M. Conlyn Jr. of Marietta, a veteran pilot both for the
Naval Reserve and Delta Air Lines.
   He underwent brain surgery at Kennestone Hospital on Thursday
night. He was still listed in critical condition today, unconscious
and breathing with the aid of a ventilator, although he showed
``some slight improvement,'' said hospital spokeswoman Laurel
Fredlake.
   A witness, Terry Scott, said he saw the pilot's parachute deploy
about 100 feet above the ground. The pilot plunged into a street,
where he was given cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   ``I saw the plane pop and all the lights go off,'' said Charles
Feather, a maintenance supervisor at an adjacent apartment complex
who said he helped a pregnant woman and her child escape the
burning building.
   ``I found the baby girl, and she was burnt,'' he said. ``Then I
found the pregnant woman, and the paramedics showed up.''
   Margie Padovani, 28, and her 5-year-old daughter, Jacquelyn,
were in critical condition today with burns over about half their
bodies, said Grady Memorial Hospital spokesman Jim Driscoll. He
said Ms. Padovani also had a broken leg. Troy Kraemer, who said he
was Ms. Padovani's fiance, said she was pregnant. He said doctors
told him the fetus might not survive.
   Holly Alfredson, 24, was treated for cracked ribs she suffered
while fleeing her apartment, hospital officials said.
   The commander of the Naval Air Station, Capt. Peter Hunt, said
today that he had no information on the cause of the crash. A Navy
review board would study the wreckage and maintenance and pilot
records, he said.
   The plane did not carry the ``black box'' flight recorder
required on commercial airlines, and Hunt said air traffic
controllers received no distress messages from the pilot.
   The crash confirmed the worst fears of residents who hear
military planes and helicopters roar above them daily.
   ``I'm not surprised,'' said Tim Head, a resident of the damaged
apartment complex. ``Not a week goes by that I don't think, `When
is a jet going to crash here?'''
   ``What I want to know is why they do maneuvers in such a
populated area?'' said Tony Clark, who lives nearby.
   Military officials last year canceled performances by the Blue
Angels stunt aircraft because of the concentration of businesses
and residences near the base.
   The A-7E, which entered service as the A-7 in the 1965 and was
widely used in Vietnam, is a single-seat attack aircraft used for a
variety of bombing missions on land and at sea.
   The current version has undergone a number of modifications. The
A-7E has a 20mm gun and can carry payloads of up to 15,000 pounds
of bombs and missiles.
   Two years ago, a crippled A-7D Corsair, an earlier version of
the plane, slammed into the lobby of the Ramada Inn-Airport in
Indianapolis, killing 10 people.

   Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, who
sought a plain-spoken campaign against AIDS while in office, says
it's a mistake for homosexuals to mix the fight against the deadly
disease with the politics of the homosexual rights movement.
   In a health address and news conference Thursday, Koop said that
``the plea for compassion and care for people with AIDS, if it gets
mixed up with the homosexual rights movement, would fail.''
   Koop, who put the condom in the front-line of the AIDS battle,
declared, ``In the beginning, because AIDS was politicized, we lost
precious time and lives. I hope Hispanics and blacks don't make the
same mistake.''
   The leaders of both those communities, he urged, should say
publicly, ``we have a number of people who, through no fault of
their own, are sick and need our health care and sympathy. They
should not say we should be treated differently from anyone else.''
   Black ministers, Koop declared, should warn from their pulpits
of the perils of unsafe sex and drugs.
   It was inevitable that an AIDS anti-discrimination ordinance,
such as that repealed in Concord this week, would be unpopular,
said Koop.
   Asked whether he supported AIDS anti-discrimination legislation,
he declined a direct answer, saying, ``that's a political issue,
not a public health issue.''
   But, he added, ``People who are sick deserve all the help and
care they can get and shouldn't be discriminated against.''

   East Germany today said it was permanently lifting
travel restrictions on its citizens, and West Germany's foreign
minister said workers would begin knocking holes in the Berlin Wall
to allow people to pass freely between the nations.
   Interior Minister Friedrick Dickel said Thursday's removal of
travel restrictions was permanent.
   ``The new travel regulation is not a temporary measure,'' Dickel
told East German television. ``It is permanent and will be the
foundation of a new travel law.''
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany told a
crowd of about 20,000 people outside West Berlin's City Hall that
holes would be made in the 9-foot-high wall, starting this evening.
   A portion of the wall at the famed Potsdamer Platz will be torn
down during the weekend, Genscher said. At times, his voice was
drowned out by cheers from the crowd. Genscher said he was told of
the plans by East German officials.
   The announcements capped one of the most dramatic shifts in
postwar Europe, giving the once penned-up East German people
freedom of travel for the first time since the Berlin Wall was
built in 1961.
   East Germany first opened its borders Thursday, but until today
there had been some uncertainty about the scope of the move.
   Dickel said police and travel authorities had been instructed to
expeditiously deal with all requests for trips abroad, ``especially
to the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and to West
Berlin.''
   All efforts will be made to grant permission for travel or
emigration the same day the request is received, Dickel said.
   Visas for private trips will be stamped in passports. If they do
not have passports and want to leave immediately, their identity
cards will be stamped, said Dickel.
   Tens of thousands of East Germans streamed into West Berlin and
other parts of West Germany today after a heady night of
celebrating the opening of the Berlin Wall and other borders.
   ``Last night, the Germans were the happiest people in the
world,'' West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper said. The party continued
today, as revelers popped champagne corks, lit sparklers and
embraced on both sides of the border.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl cut short his visit to Poland
to meet with his Cabinet and arrived in West Berlin. He hoped to
talk with East German leader Egon Krenz.
   Krenz, in a continuing effort to stop an exodus of East Germans
to the West, today fired four more members of the ruling Politburo
and launched an investigation of ``gross mistakes'' made by the
leadership under his predecessor, Erich Honecker.
   The Politburo, which normally has 21 members, was streamlined to
11 two days ago. It lost one more full member today and three
candidate, or non-voting, members.
   East Germans began fleeing their Communist homeland by the tens
of thousands in September, after Hungary began dismantling its
borders to the West and allowed East Germans to pass through.
   Pro-reform demonstrations began spreading across East Germany,
finally leading to the ouster Oct. 18 of the hard-line leader
Honecker.
   The abrupt opening of the border was the breathtaking climax of
a remarkable series of reforms that began with Krenz's appointment.
   East and West Berliners joined in dancing atop the Berlin Wall
during the celebrations that lasted through the night. More than
50,000 East Berliners crossed into West Berlin during the night,
said the West German radio station Sender Fries Berlin. Only about
1,000 of them planned to stay, the radio said.
   Most were just visiting, exulting in their sudden new freedom to
travel to the other side of the monolithic structure.
   ``The sun is shining, and the people are in a good mood,'' said
a smiling, husky East German guard today at the Invalidenstrasse
crossing of the wall.
   Many people cried as they embraced relatives they hadn't seen in
decades. Others rushed to West Berlin department stores to buy
cosmetics and other goods scarce in the East bloc.
   ``It was so simple to come over,'' one young East German said.
``The feeling is just indescribable.''
   In Bonn, jubilant West German lawmakers, many shaking with
emotion, spontaneously stood to sing the national anthem Thursday
during a hastily called session of the lower house of Parliament.
   President Bush said if East Germany makes good on its promise to
allow free emigration, ``this wall built in '61 will have very
little relevance.''
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov praised the East German reforms but cautioned that any
speculation about a reunified Germany was ``out of the question.''
   West Germany ``should take into account that policies aimed at
reconsidering borders would not suit any government in Europe and
would cause only mistrust,'' Gerasimov said.
   The sight of people dancing atop the barrier that epitomized the
Cold War since it was built in 1961 was unthinkable only hours
earlier. Some took hammers and chisels to the wall Thursday night
in a symbolic effort to tear it down.
   Hundreds of West Berliners took advantage of the newly opened
borders to head in the opposite direction and catch a glimpse of
the other side of the divided city.
   ``What joy! This is the best thing that happened in 100 years!''
yelled a West Berlin man.
   Many hugged and kissed strangers, while cars packed with East
Germans and others paraded down the streets of West Berlin.
   Honecker supervised the building of the Berlin Wall before he
became Communist Party chief. Every U.S. president since John F.
Kennedy has urged that it be torn down.
   Krenz on Thursday also advocated a law that would ensure free
and democratic elections in his Communist nation, which has been
disrupted by pro-reform demonstrations and weakened by mass flight
to the West.
   More than 200,000 East Germans, nearly 1.5 percent of the
nation's 16.5 million people, have left so far this year _ 56,000
through Czechoslovakia since Saturday alone. Most are young,
skilled workers vital to the economy.
   Hundreds of thousands of people who stayed behind have filled
the streets to demand democratic reforms and an end to 40 years of
rigid one-party rule.
   An ADN dispatch said a party conference planned for next month
would consider personnel changes in the 163-member Central
Committee.

   The garden clubs in this wealthy,
suburban city are banding together against what they see as an
unsightly enemy: ``For Sale'' signs, which residents consider tacky.
   The 11 clubs have decided to embark on a letter-writing campaign
to persuade real estate agents to stop using the signs, once
unheard of in Greenwich, where George Bush grew up and where many
New York City corporate titans live.
   Garden club members say burglars may see the signs as hints the
owners are absent. They also worry that the signs hurt property
values.
   ``It's the effect of a fire sale,'' said Nadine Von Storch, a
real estate broker and member of the Hortulus garden club.
``Everything must go. People get panicky. Why is everyone on North
Street selling their house?''
   One real estate agent, David Ogilvy, said his firm simply won't
stoop to using signs.
   ``I think signs are very ugly,'' Ogilvy said. ``I see people
spending tons of money and time landscaping their yards beautifully
to have it ruined by their next-door neighbor whose house is for
sale for nine to 11 months and all you see is signs.''
   But Tom Gorin, vice president of the 700-member Greenwich Board
of Realtors, said: ``In a tough real estate market, it's very
difficult to tell a homeowner that he can't use any means available
to sell.''

   Fifth-graders who got a whiff of the
city's waste water treatment plant said they preferred touring it
to spending the day in the classroom.
   ``This was better than going to reading class any day,'' said
Megan Russell, 10.
   The visit was arranged after 25 students in Sue Kellerman's
class at Hampton Elementary School wrote Mayor Delbert Schrems to
say they wanted Saginaw to stop raw-sewage discharges.
   Many pupils held their noses during much of the tour Wednesday,
but most agreed they learned a lot about Saginaw's dumping of
untreated sewage into the Saginaw River.
   About 600 million to 800 million gallons of raw sewage and storm
water finds its way into the Saginaw River annually. Saginaw
Assistant City Manager Robert Dust told the students that the city
will spend $72 million to stop most of its raw-sewage discharges by
1994 by building six retention basins.

   Supporters of a new state policy to
strengthen the teaching of evolution in the nation's largest public
school system say it was diluted to please religious
fundamentalists.
   But a minister said the new science education guidelines
censored teaching of the biblical theory of the origin of life.
   State Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig, who
helped write the guidelines, said Thursday they clearly say that
evolution _ not creationism _ will be taught to California's 4.6
million public school students.
   ``This is a much stronger statement than was in place before,''
Honig said after the state Board of Education unanimously adopted
the policy. ``This now states for the first time evolution will be
taught in its entirety and it's not controversial.''
   The Rev. Louis Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition, an
opponent of the policy, said it censors creationism.
   ``It isn't the state's role to be hostile to religion,'' Sheldon
said. ``It is to be accommodating.''
   Sheldon cited as particularly offensive the sentence in the
policy that says: ``The particular case of `creation science' or
`scientific creationism' has been thoroughly studied and rejected
by the leading scientific societies as qualifying as a scientific
explanation.''
   The Board of Education's 9-0 vote sets up the guidelines only as
recommendations to local school boards, which mandate course
content. But such standards historically have influenced the local
panels and textbook publishers throughout the nation.
   The vote climaxed months of dispute, the latest round in the
long struggle between educators and civil libertarians over
evolution vs. creation.
   Honig maintained that the changes did not weaken the evolution
language, but Michael Hudson of the civil libertarian group People
for the American Way said the language ``leaves the door open to
controversy.''
   The policy ``is a 90 percent victory for science,'' he said.
``It is frustrating that the state Board of Education was compelled
to weaken the evolution coverage to appease the religious right.''
   Eugenie Scott, executive director of the National Center for
Science Education, said the policy is ``slightly weaker'' on
evolution but remains a strong document overall that still says
evolution is a fact.
   The changes, she said, were a concession to Christian
fundamentalists that were necessary to gain board support for
passage.
   Scott said that overall the new policy may be so much stronger
on evolution that they shock teachers into ignoring the guidelines
altogether. She also said some textbook publishers may withdraw
from the lucrative California market because of the costs of
reorganizing their books.
   Specifically, Honig and Board of Education President Francis
Laufenberg made the amendments by striking a sentence that said:
``There is no scientific dispute that evolution has occurred and
continues to occur; this is why evolution is regarded as a
scientific fact.''
   Honig said the sentence was redundant within the document.
   Other changes include deletion of two paragraphs that contain
references to a precedent-setting U.S. Supreme Court decision and a
National Academy of Science booklet that both question the
scientific validity of the creationist theory.
   Several sentences were added that, in part, say ``some people
reject the theory of evolution purely on the basis of religious
faith,'' and that such ``personal beliefs should be respected and
not demeaned.''
   The old guidelines said evolution must be taught in schools, and
they offered no guidance to teachers or administrators on dealing
with questions from students about the biblical theory of creation.

Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors requested dismissal of a
manslaughter charge against the man accused in the hit-and-run
death of kidnap victim Steven Stayner.
   Antonio Loera, 28, still faces a charge of felony hit-and-run
driving to which he is expected to plead no contest a hearing on
Dec. 14, Merced County District Attorney Frank Dougherty said
Thursday.
   The decision to dismiss the manslaughter charge was based on
evidence that a defective carburetor and loose throttle caused the
Sept. 16 accident, Dougherty said.
   Loera had testified that the car motor died when he pulled out
of a driveway. Stayner, who gained prominence when he returned to
Merced seven years after being kidnapped by a drifter, was killed
when he hit the car with his motorcycle.
   Loera fled to Mexico after the accident, but later returned to
Merced voluntarily. Dougherty said that if Loera had remained at
the scene, he wouldn't have faced any charges.

   Sparks from a welder's torch today ignited
100,000 pounds of recycled plastics in a nearby warehouse, sending
thick smoke over downtown and threatening to force the closure of
an interstate highway, authorities said.
   Sixty workers in nearby buildings were evacuated as a precaution
after the the blaze broke out in a warehouse next to Interstate 40.
   Deputy Fire Chief Jon Hansen said authorities were concerned
that the burning material might release toxic vapors, and people
were warned to avoid walking into smoke. There were no reports of
injuries, he said.
   The fire broke out about 10 a.m. and was still burning out of
control an hour later, Hansen said. Welders were working on a
billboard with other workers on the ground with fire extinguishers
to put out any sparks that fell. Somehow, a spark ignited the
plastics in the warehouse nearby, officials said.
   The heavy, black smoke boiled up from the blaze, blanketing
downtown Oklahoma City. It could be seen as far as five miles away.
   The Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported several accidents on
Interstate 40, primarily because of people slowing to look at the
fire. Dispatcher Joseph Dukes said troopers would have to close
I-40 if winds blowing the smoke to the north shifted direction.
   Hansen said firefighters were trying to keep the fire from
spreading to nearby buildings, including a huge U-Haul warehouse
across the street.

<TEXT>
   Petar Mladenov, who was named Bulgaria's
Communist Party chief on Friday, is seen as a relative moderate
whose views have at times raised the ire of hard-liners in this
Communist country.
   But in the past, Mladenov also spoke out against reforms
demanded by Poland's Solidarity movement, and during a recent visit
to China he cautioned against countries interfering in each other's
internal affairs.
   Mladenov was an unexpected candidate to replace Todor Zhivkov,
who resigned Friday after 35 years in power.
   Diplomats and analysts said he had upset hard-liners in the
party leadership by pushing to hold an international conference in
Sofia, under whose auspices independent groups were able to
publicly campaign for reform.
   Mladenov, 53, was born in 1936 in a village in northwestern
Bulgaria into a peasant's family.
   He studied philosophy at Sofia University and graduated from the
prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations in
1963. He joined the ruling party a year later.
   A regional party secretary of the Vidin county in northwestern
Bulgaria, he quickly made his way up through party ranks and became
a Central Committee member in 1971. He was appointed a full
Politburo member in 1977.
   Mladenov became foreign minister in 1971 when he was just 35,
making him not only the youngest foreign minister in Bulgaria but
also one of the youngest and longest serving chiefs of diplomacy in
the Soviet bloc.
   Diplomats said Friday before the opening of a party plenum at
which Mladenov was appointed that they expected him to be ousted
from the party leadership.
   During last week's international conference, independent
activists were joined by thousands of Bulgarians who demonstrated
in Sofia for reforms.
   Mladenov was conspicuously absent from the head of a delegation
that met last month with Turkish officials to discuss the problem
of ethnic Turks in Bulgaria. Bulgarian officials cited a heart
ailment that Mladenov reported has suffered from for years.
   Mladenov, who toured many Western countries in his long tenure
as foreign minister, including Japan, West Germany and France, was
a supporter of East-West disarmament talks but cautioned against
reforms demanded by Solidarity in Poland in 1981.
   During a visit to Moscow that year, he told reporters that ``we
want to hope that the Polish Communists and healthy forces in the
country will do everything necessary'' to defend communism.
   Poland banned the independent trade union movement and declared
martial law the same year.
   As part of sweeping reforms that have engulfed the Soviet bloc,
Solidarity was made legal this year, and a Solidarity member,
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, became prime minister.
   In an unmistakeable reference to the East bloc reforms, Mladenov
said during a visit to Beijing last week that ``interference in
internal affairs aimed at imposing this or that model of
development in all cases leads to destabilization and poses a
threat to peace and security.''

   Poland said it understood Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's decision to break off a visit Friday after the
dramatic opening of East Germany's borders, and officials tried to
salvage the future of the trip.
   The stunning developments in East Germany were the main topic of
talks when Kohl met with Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki on
Friday and said he planned to go back to West Germany, according to
Kohl spokesman Hans Klein.
   ``The prime minister showed understanding for the decision of
the chancellor to cut short his visit,'' Klein said, adding that
Kohl ``wanted to do everything to create the impression that West
German interest in Poland had not decreased.''
   ``Kohl has bigger problems and everybody must understand that.
It would have been politically unwise for him not to return,'' said
Jerzy Osiatynski, head of the central planning office.
   Government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska said Kohl told
Mazowiecki that he needed to break the six-day visit for ``about 24
hours'' to go to Berlin and Bonn.
   Making light of the events sweeping Eastern Europe, a senior
government official remarked, ``Kohl will be back if Germany
doesn't reunify in the meantime.''
   Klein said Kohl was planning to return Saturday night and would
travel to the Silesian town of Krzyzowa to attend a Roman Catholic
Mass with Mazowiecki. Ethnic Germans also are planning to gather
there.
   Despite the departure, the two sides managed to sign six
agreements.
   The documents include the important investment promotion and
protective agreement, which provides West German guarantees for
private enterprise investments in Poland. The economic assistance
amounted to about $1.5 billion in two years, including a $250
million loan to help stabilize the zloty.
   Mazowiecki's government says massive Western economic aid is
needed to secure the fragile democratic process under way.
   West Germany is Poland's largest Western trading partner and
Kohl brought a delegation of businessmen with him to start
developing projects between the two countries.
   On Thursday, the nations agreed to establish consulates in
Hamburg and Krakow, and to extend contacts between their foreign
ministries.
   Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski said his talks with West
German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher had been ``very
good'' and all the bilateral issues had been resolved before the
East German developments propelled the talks to an international
level.
   Thousands of East Germans streamed into West Berlin late
Thursday after the decision by East Berlin to open border
crossings, and a massive and emotional street party continued
through the night.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa told PAP that the changes in East
Germany ``should have been taken much earlier.''
   ``The drama of the events in East Germany is the result of
earlier neglect, as usually happens when someone misses the train
of history,'' Walesa said.
   The developments in East Germany have fueled Polish fears about
German reunification and forced long-simmering border issues to the
forefront of Kohl's visit, which was intended to move the former
World War II adversaries closer to reconciliation.

   Schmidt, 45, gave his name and address in Glendale during the

   A Soviet spokesman Friday welcomed East Germany's
decision to throw open its borders and said it would help stem
emigration and do away with ``stereotypes about the Iron Curtain.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said the Soviet
Union was concerned about the instability brought on by the mass
exodus of East Germans to the West.
   But now that travel will be easier, he said, ``The wanderlust
the Germans are famous for will go down because now when you know
you can go maybe you'll postpone the decision.''
   Gerasimov stressed that the border between East and West Germany
remained in force and the eased travel restrictions should not be
taken as heralding the imminent reunification of the two Germanys.
   ``The border still remains, though some might think it ceased to
exist,'' he said.
   East German Communist officials said later Friday they were
permanently lifting travel restrictions on their citizens and would
begin taking down a portion of the 28-year-old Berlin Wall.
   Now that the wall has lost its significance as a physical and
symbolic barrier, ``it removes all the stereotypes about the Iron
Curtain,'' Gerasimov said.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze also welcomed the move,
saying it was ``a reasonable and sensible decision.''
   The Soviet Union had nothing to do with the decision to open the
Berlin Wall gates, Shevardnadze told reporters covering his meeting
with visiting Swedish Foreign Minister Sten Andersson.
   Shevardnadze told Andersson that some West German leaders are
making statements ``against the post-war setup and stability in
Europe,'' said Tass, the official news agency.
   ``The U.S.S.R. and Sweden are resolutely in favor of the
inviolability of the European borders,'' Tass said.
   In the first press commentary on the East German move, veteran
Tass political observer Yuri Kornilov called the border opening
``positive and important,'' but ridiculed speculation that
reunification of the Germanys was at hand.
   Western claims that the borders will be redrawn in Europe ``are
strange postulates, in my view!'' he wrote. ``Yes, the Berlin Wall
has stopped being an obstacle isolating East German citizens from
the Western world.'' But the move does not mean the removal of such
border functions as customs inspections, he emphasized.
   Gerasimov cited a Nov. 1 statement by East German leader Egon
Krenz that the border exists ``due to other reasons'' and not for
the purpose of interfering with contacts between people.
   Krenz noted then that the Berlin Wall marks the division between
political systems as well as between the military alliances of East
and West.
   Gerasimov said the border opening was part of the ``wide
democratization of life'' taking place in East Germany, where the
recent replacement of hard-line Communist leader Erich Honecker
touched off a popular rush toward reform.
   East Berliners streamed into West Berlin after East Germany
opened its borders. Thousands of East Germans also crossed into
West Germany.
   Soviet TV, in its nightly news broadcast ``Vremya,'' showed
people cheering as they left East Germany at several border points,
including Checkpoint Charlie at the Berlin Wall.
   Shevardnadze said he was undisturbed by the tens of thousands of
East Germans fleeing westward.
   ``It's not abnormal for people to leave their countries.
Sometimes they return,'' he said. ``Twenty thousand people leave
the Soviet Union every year. That in itself is not unusual.''
   In fact, officials say more than 100,000 people, mainly Jews,
Armenians and ethnic Germans, have emigrated from the Soviet Union
this year and some 2 million gone on visits in an outflow made
possible by eased emigration restrictions.
   However, emigration is still limited by a variety of
restrictions and complications, as well as would-be emigres'
difficulties in finding promising countries willing to accept them.
   A bill before the Soviet legislature would grant most citizens
the right to come and go as they please but it would still require
an invitation from abroad for people who want to emigrate.

<HEAD>Chinese Dissidents Welcome Deng's Resignation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese who fled their country after the June
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement said Friday that
international disgrace forced Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping to
resign.
   Deng, 85, gave up the chairmanship of the Communist Party's
Central Military Commission on Thursday and was replaced by his
chosen successor and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin.
   ``The resignation of Deng appears to us ... as the necessary
result of the June 4 massacre,'' the Paris-based Federation for
Democracy in China said in a statement issued Friday.
   The federation founded by exiled Chinese dissidents said Deng's
resignation proved the government is unstable, though he is
believed to retain a dominant political role.
   ``In the face of criticism from the Chinese people, from the
people of the whole world and from democratic governments, Deng
Xiaoping understood he could no longer remain head of the military
commission,'' the statement said.
   Deng met former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in
Beijing on Friday, reinforcing the general feeling that Deng
remains a powerful figure.
   In Tokyo, Japanese government officials said Deng's resignation
will cause little change in China's domestic and international
policies.
   Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama and Finance Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto said Japan won't change its policy before China's new
leaders articulate their positions.
   ``The important thing is that we should maintain our stand not
to isolate China,'' Chief Cabinet Secretary Mayumi Moriyama told a
news conference.
   Muneyoshi Date, a China specialist at Takushoku University, told
the nationally circulated Asahi Shimbun newspaper that Deng would
control Zemin, who is inexperienced in military affairs. ``Although
Deng resigned from his last post, that's not a real resignation,''
Date said.
   ``It will be impossible for China to avoid the wave of democracy
brewing in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union,'' said the Nihon
Keizai Shimbun, an economic daily.

<HEAD>Bush Proposes $4.2 Billion Program to Help Poor with Housing</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout with text of speech</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush today proposed a $4.2 billion
package to help the poor buy houses and the homeless receive
shelter, and vowed to ``change the destructive practices'' that
have blocked affordable housing in inner cities.
   Bush did not suggest ways to pay the federal share of the
three-year program, which would begin in the fiscal year starting
next October.
   He announced the package, called Home Ownership and Opportunity
for People Everywhere and entailing federal programs tied to state
and local matching funds, in a speech for the National Association
of Realtors.
   It would include $2.1 billion in grants to help residents of
low-income housing buy their units.
   Bush proposed a 50-percent match of federal funds by state and
local governments or non-profit organizations. The grants would be
used to rehabilitate and purchase units in public housing, vacant
and foreclosed properties held by the government and ``distressed''
properties cited by the Federal Housing Authority.
   Bush also offered incentives to local communities that remove
bureaucratic barriers blocking the availability of affordable
housing, such as zoning restrictions.
   He would give $210 million in insurance and rental
rehabilitation grants for zones that best develop plans to remove
such tax and regulatory barriers in inner city areas.
   ``We will change the destructive practices which have kept FHA
out of the inner cities and distressed communities that most need
its support,'' he said. He assigned Housing and Urban Development
Secretary Jack Kemp to name a panel that would recommend ways to
remove barriers to affordable housing.
   ``No city, state or town should receive a single penny of HOPE
funding until they have identified the barriers to affordable
housing in their own back yard and start taking steps to remove
them,'' Bush said.
   He said the centerpiece of his HOPE plan was ``to recapture the
American dream of home ownership for those who have been left
behind.''
   He also proposed:
   _ $728 million in federal housing funds, to be matched at the
state and local level, for new housing and support services for the
homeless.
   _ $1.08 billion to help tenant groups buy and convert federally
subsidized buildings to resident-owned cooperatives.
   _ Allowing first-time buyers to use Individual Retirement
Accounts for a home down payment without paying a penalty.
   _ $44 million for a demonstration project that would offer
housing and support services for elderly people who otherwise would
have to be institutionalized.
   HUD officials said the state and local matching funds would add
$1.7 billion in assistance.
   Bush also was attending a dinner to help Texas Gov. Bill
Clements retire $2 million in debt from his 1986 campaign and
helping dedicate a Texas memorial to Vietnam veterans before flying
home Saturday.
   In a speech last March 14, Bush said, ``When you look out the
window of the White House and see the ragged, pathetic figures
huddled over the steam grates of the Ellipse, I see an affront to
the American dream, a national shame.''
   He ordered Kemp then to come up with new ideas to get the
homeless off the streets of urban America.
   Earlier in the year, Bush proposed spending $644 million in
fiscal 1990 to carry out the McKinney Act, a program created to
find housing for the homeless.
   President Ronald Reagan was often criticized by homeless
activists for not seeking more funds for the homeless. Federal
funds for low-income housing were cut 75 percent during the Reagan
administration.
   District of Columbia officials believe there are 8,000 to 10,000
people living on the streets of the nation's capital. Nationally,
some researchers estimate 300,000 to 600,000 Americans are homeless
on any given night. Some activists say the homeless number 2
million or more.
   HUD has been enveloped in an influence-peddling scandal left
over from the Reagan years and Kemp has devoted most of his energy
to date to straightening out his department's procedures for
dispensing grants and contracts.

   Iran Friday reiterated the U.S. release
this week of $567 million in frozen Iranian assets won't affect the
status of Americans held hostage in Lebanon.
   Tehran television reported Eftekhar Jahroomi, legal adviser to
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, rejected any link because the
U.S. decision Monday complied with a U.S.-Iranian claims commission
in the Hague set up in 1981 after talks in Algiers.
   ``The payment was solely in line with the Algiers agreements,''
Jahroomi was quoted as saying by the broadcast, monitored in
Cyprus. ``Iran's claims against American banks were similarly
paid.''
   Nowbari Heirani, Iran's representative at the international
court also said the released assets ``have nothing to do with the
hostages,'' the report said.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi said Thursday repayment of
the assets had ``nothing to do with good will.''
   President Bush said Tuesday he hoped the U.S. move will prompt
Iran to obtain freedom for the eight American hostages in Lebanon.
The State Department said the decision itself was not influenced by
the hostage issue.
   Rafsanjani, leader of the so-called pragmatists in Iran, told a
news conference last month Iran would help secure the release of
the 18 Western hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon if
Washington unblocks Iranian assets.
   Iran claims the assets frozen a decade ago are as much as $12
billion, including the value of weapons purchased before the 1979
Islamic revolution but never delivered.
   The assets were blocked after militants stormed the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran Nov. 4, 1979, and held American diplomats and other
personnel hostage. Fifty-two captives were released 444 days later.
   The longest-held hostage in Lebanon is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   The venerable rock group Crosby,
Stills &amp; Nash brought music back to this quake-damaged city in a
benefit concert that raised more than $21,000 for county relief
agencies.
   The band performed two shows Thursday night at the Catalyst
nightclub, just a half-block from the Pacific Garden Mall, which
suffered severe damage in the Oct. 17 quake. Three people were
killed when several dozen mall buildings collapsed.
   The 400 people at each show were a mix of yuppies and yippies
that savored the folky standards by David Crosby, Stephen Stills
and Graham Nash.
   The three refrained from making benefit speeches, letting their
guitars do the talking, but Nash dedicated ``Our House'' to the
Cooper House, a county courthouse dating from the 1890s that was
converted to a mixed commercial building. The structure was
severely damaged in the quake.
   Nash arranged the benefit with longtime tour manager R. Mac
Holbert, a Santa Cruz native.

   Meeting Roy Rogers was a dream come
true for a 5-year-old cancer victim who has been a fan of the
screen cowboy since he was 2, his mother says.
   Dustin Benson, of Smithville, Tenn., met his hero Thursday at
the Roy Rogers Museum here and the two exchanged gifts. Rogers gave
Dustin a cowboy hat and a belt with horses on it, and in return
received a photo album and hand-painted picture of the boy and his
pony.
   Dale Evans, Rogers' wife and TV sidekick, was given a bracelet
made by Dustin's sister, Shacina Glory.
   With their belts and cowboy hats, ``Dustin and Roy looked like
they belonged together,'' said Dustin's mother, Myla.
   The meeting was made possible by DreamMakers, a Nashville-based
organization that makes wishes come true for children with
life-threatening illnesses. The group flew Dustin, his 12-year-old
sister and their parents to California for the visit. The family
was to visit Disneyland before returning home.
   Dustin suffers from Ewing's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor of the
chest wall. He is one of the youngest people in the world known to
have the disease.

   Actor Don Johnson says the roof, windows and
a bathtub leak in his new home, and that's just part of the reason
he's refusing to pay nearly $100,000 to a contractor for work done.
   The contractor, Duddy-Viele Construction of Vail, filed a
lawsuit last week in Pitkin County District Court, saying although
Johnson has paid $508,272 for construction work, he still owes
$95,813. Others who have done work on the house have filed liens on
the Aspen residence.
   Johnson had refused to comment on the matter until Friday, when
he issued a statement saying, ``Anyone who has ever been on the
receiving end of an incompetent contractor should be able to
understand my frustration and anger.''
   The actor said his hardwood flooring is cracked, the floor sags
and the beams in the interior of the home also appear to be sagging.
   ``All of the windows and doors leak and there is evidence of
water intrusion throughout the home. The upstairs bathtub ... leaks
between the floors onto occupants below,'' said Robert Showcraft,
Johnson's attorney.
   The former ``Miami Vice'' star issued the statement before
leaving for Key West, Fla., with his wife, actress Melanie
Griffith. He will be competing in a powerboat race there later this
month.

   The 47-year-old singer, best known for her song ``Stand by Your

1988.
   Gorden said Wynette has paid back all of a $450,000 Federal

co-signed some loans on a shopping center in Boynton Beach, Fla. A
Florida savings and loan company involved in the deal went defunct.

   Ballerina Suzanne Farrell, who made a triumphal

Balanchine to create some of his greatest dances for her, will
peform in the Der Rosenkavalier section of ``Vienna Waltzes''
created by Balanchine in 1977.
   Farrell, who joined the ballet company in 1961, announced she
would retire in 1986, but the company then said she would wait to
see how she felt after hip-replacement surgery. She has danced in
three ballets since then.
   ``If my dancing has been able to express even a fraction of what
Mr. B. gave me, I will consider myself very fortunate indeed,''
Farrell said of Balanchine in a statement the company released

   Prince Charles learned the medicinal value of
cow gallstones, deer tails and reindeer antlers during a tour of a
Chinese pharmacy Friday as he concluded his official visit of Hong
Kong.
   Chiu Kwong Lee, 79, explained to the smiling prince that the
gallstones were good for inflammatory conditions. Chiu then
produced a deer antler, which he claimed promotes virility and
strengthens heart muscles.
   Charles asked the price of the deer tails, which he was told
sold for $256 each.
   The prince tasted a sliver of red Korean ginseng, which is said
to help cure fatigue and hangovers, and sampled an herbal laxative
mixture offered by Chiu.
   Charles will remain in the British colony until Sunday, although
his official visit concluded Friday. His wife, Diana, returned to

   Old soldiers worry about being turned out
to the street. A program intended to help homeless veterans
allegedly milked them instead. And the state says it has no money
to stop the battleship USS Massachusetts from turning into a rust
bucket.
   This Veterans Day, it's tough being a vet in Massachusetts. The
problems relate one way or another to money in a state facing a
projected $730 million budget deficit.
   ``They say Veterans Day is to really honor the veterans and the
deceased veterans,'' said Mark Kelley, 66, who served as an Army
staff sergeant in World War II and now lives at the Chelsea
Soldiers Home.
   But, he added, ``what they're doing to us here is not even in
the ballpark of the word `honor.'''
   State figures estimate Massachusetts is home to 666,000 military
veterans, including 170,000 from the Vietnam War era, 121,000 who
served during the Korean War, 259,000 from World War II and about
3,000 who served in World War I.
   About 500 of them live at the state home for wartime veterans,
which opened in 1882 and is believed to be the first such
institution in the country.
   Since July, Gov. Michael Dukakis' administration has announced
$1,435,000 in cuts from the home's $16.4 million budget, but the
Legislature has moved to restore the money.
   The budget reduction threatens the home with severe cutbacks
Jan. 1 in its medical services, and some residents read this as an
omen that it will be shut down altogether, said Kelley, who heads
the residents' council.
   Kelley moved to the home in 1985 when two heart attacks
compelled his retirement at age 62.
   ``My feeling is the same as practically every other veteran in
the place,'' he said. ``We do not have anywhere to go if they close
this home.''
   Similar budget cuts are threatened for the Soldiers Home in
Holyoke and its 262 residents.
   Another casualty of the money shortage is the USS Massachusetts,
berthed in Fall River and operated as a state memorial by a private
charitable committee. The World War II battleship was to be towed
to Boston this weekend for $6 million in repairs, but the project
was aborted last week after state money was withdrawn.
   In Boston, something is apparently rotten in the Homeless
Veterans Reintegration Project.
   Two officials of the federally financed, state-run project were
suspended without pay last month while the attorney general's
office looks into allegations they charged illegally high rents and
accepted finder's fees from landlords.
   Thomas Hudner, state deputy commissioner for veterans services,
whose agency sponsors the project, acknowledged in an interview
this week, ``There are a lot of people who are embarrassed about
the thing.''
   In any event, he said, ``I feel comfortable that there has been
no diminishment of the services.''
   At the soldiers' home, 101-year-old Alma Bloom explained the
need for such services from the perspective of a World War I Navy
nurse who joined the home's staff in 1948 and became a resident
about 10 years ago.
   ``Veterans deserve good care,'' Mrs. Bloom said. While she
sympathizes with the need to save money, she said, ``veterans
should come first.''
   Her daughter, a 69-year-old Air Force retiree also named Alma
and part of a lineage of veterans going back to the American
Revolution, was more direct.
   ``We're no different than the blind or the abused children and
other services that deserve not to be cut,'' Miss Bloom said.
   ``Take a look out there,'' Miss Bloom said, nodding toward her
fellow residents. ``People with their legs cut off, in wheelchairs,
shuffling along with canes.''

   Dozens of mourners filed past the
flower-covered coffin of Vladimir Horowitz in the famed La Scala
theater on Friday, and the pianist was buried in the family chapel
of the late maestro Arturo Toscanini.
   Horowitz, who died Sunday in New York at the age of 85, had
hoped to attend the opening of the opera season Dec. 7 at La Scala.
   ``He had promised me he would come to Milan to attend Vepri
Siciliani on the gala night,'' said Carlo Maria Badini,
superintendent of the theater. ``On the occasion we could have
obtained his promise to perform a concert at La Scala.''
   Fans slowly filed past the coffin, which was covered with red
flowers during a two-hour public exposition in the theater main
hall.
   The Soviet-born virtuoso was buried near his only daughter,
Sonja, who died in 1975.
   Horowitz's widow, Wanda, the daughter of Toscanini, had asked
that Horowitz be buried in the Toscanini plot in Milan's Monumental
Cemetery.
   She was among a crowd of 200 who attended the burial.
   ``The piano became orchestra as Horowitz played it,'' said
Italian maestro Gian Andrea Gavazzeni.

<HEAD>Federal Judge OKs Agreement to Sell Impounded Rifles to Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court-approved agreement permits a gun
dealer to sell to police officers a $1.7 million shipment of
semiautomatic rifles impounded under a Bush administration ban nine
months ago.
   Gun South Inc.'s shipment of 1,252 Steyr AUG-SA semiautomatic
rifles was seized by Customs at the Birmingham airport in March,
leading to one of the first court challenges to the government
moratorium on imports of such weapons.
   Under the agreement approved Thursday by U.S. District Judge
William Acker, the dealer can sell the impounded rifles, plus 3,000
more Steyrs awaiting shipment Austria, but the sales can be made
only to officers or law enforcement agencies. The dealer had
planned to sell them to hunters.
   ``I'm glad it's all over. Our legal bill is astronomical,'' said
Gun South owner Don Wood. He said Friday the rifles sell for $1,375
each. He said he cannot order more of the rifles because of the
ban, which remains on the books.
   The agreement cancels a Nov. 21 trial of Gun South's lawsuit
challenging the ban.
   James C. Barton, a lawyer for Gun South, said he is convinced
the Trussville company has the right under law to import freely any
number of Steyr rifles and sell them to anyone, but the financial
burden required a settlement.
   Gun South, sole U.S. importer and distributor of Steyrs, ordered
and committed to pay for the two shipments months before the Bush
administration announced a temporary ban on imports of
semiautomatic rifles in March.
   The ban came in response to public outcry over use of assault
rifles in crimes, including the shooting at a school in California
in January.
   The Customs Service impounded the first Gun South shipment at
the airport before Gun South could pick it up, and the company went
to court seeking an order to release the guns.
   Gun South argued the gun was not an assault rifle and had
received government approval for importation previously as suitable
for hunting.

<HEAD>Soviet Spokesman Blasts Pentagon `Scandal' on Lasers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government spokesman Friday accused Pentagon
officials of trying to spoil superpower relations by charging that
Soviet ships in the Pacific shot lasers at U.S. military aircraft.
   ``Right-wing forces in the United States are seeking to poison
the atmosphere of the two countries' relations by fanning up some
insignificant scandal,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov.
   He told a news briefing the scandal was timed to sour President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's summit with President Bush next month on
ships in the Mediterranean Sea off Malta.
   U.S. Defense Department officials said Thursday the Soviets were
suspected of shooting lasers at four U.S. military aircraft in the
Pacific in recent weeks, damaging the eyesight of an Air Force
crewman in one incident.
   Lasers are sometimes used as rangefinders to target enemy
aircraft.
   The Pentagon officials said the actions occurred despite an
agreement last summer by U.S. and Soviet military officials
designed to avoid such dangerous military encounters. The agreement
is not due to go into effect until Jan. 1.
   Defense Department sources said it had not been officially
determined that lasers had been used, but that they were suspected
because of past incidents and accounts from American military
personnel.
   Gerasimov said ``nothing actually happened, but even if
something happened, U.S. Defense Department people could have
obtained necessary clarification through regular channels.''
   The afflicted U.S. crewman _ a loadmaster aboard an HC-130
aircraft _ suffered disruption of his color vision, headaches and
other visual problems and is under medical evaluation, Pentagon
sources said.
   The crewman had been wearing ``laser eye protection'' gear at
the time, and U.S. officials are also investigating why the damage
could occur despite that equipment, the sources said.

   Anti-Castro extremist Orlando Bosch is tired of
jail and will give up his fight against government efforts to
deport him, relatives said.
   ``He doesn't want to prolong the anguish, after two years of
this,'' said Bosch's wife, Adriana.
   Bosch has 50 days to appeal a judge's ruling Wednesday that
upheld the government decision to deport him. But if he notifies
the government in writing that he won't appeal, he could be
deported as soon as the State Department can find a country to
accept him.
   ``He feels that to appeal would be giving his approval to the
judicial limbo in which he has been kept,'' Mrs. Bosch said
Thursday.
   Bosch's attorneys say they'll give him some time to reconsider
before notifying the government that he won't appeal.
   Bosch, 63, has been at the Metropolitan Correctional Center
since Feb. 16, 1988, when he flew to Miami from Venezuela. He spent
11 years in Venezuelan prisons on charges he masterminded the
bombing of a Cuban jetliner in 1976 that killed 73 people.
   Bosch never was convicted of those charges, but the U.S.
Attorney General office maintained that his anti-Castro activities
make him a threat to national security.
   Immigration experts say it will be difficult for the government
to find a country that will accept Bosch, who would likely be
accompanied by his wife. A Justice Department spokesman refused to
comment, other than to restate the government's promise not to send
Bosch to Cuba, where a death sentence awaits him.
   The pending deportation provoked anger among Miami's exile
community, many of whom regard Bosch as a tireless campaigner
against Cuban leader Fidel Castro.

   Surprising numbers that turned up in

desegregation, officials said Friday.
   With five of the city's 12 wards recounted in the official
canvass, Democratic incumbent Nicholas Wasicsko had picked up 1,663
votes, cutting by more than a third the margin by which he trailed
Republican Henry Spallone.
   ``This makes it close and there is a possibility the results
could change,'' said Marion Oldi, one of two Westchester County
elections commissioners.
   The canvass was suspended Friday for Veterans Day and was to
resume Monday.
   Commissioner Antonia D'Apice said the error discovered Thursday
was unnerving because of its size, but that she considered a
reversal unlikely.
   Wasicsko acknowledged the chance was remote, but obtained a
court order to have the remaining machines impounded under state
police guard.
   ``The whole direction of the city hangs in the balance,'' the
mayor said.
   The race for City Hall was a pivotal one for Yonkers, a city of
195,000 on the Hudson River north of New York, where a
court-ordered housing desegregation plan has divided the city for
years. The election was basically a referendum on the issue, with
Spallone urging continued defiance and Wasicsko calling for
compliance.
   In addition, the mayor will be the seventh vote on a City
Council that apparently shapes up as evenly divided on the issue.
   ``There's always a possibility I might wake up and not be mayor
of Yonkers. But I think the numbers will hold,'' Spallone said.
``Everything's in the hands of the Lord.''
   Unofficial Election Night tallies had Spallone defeating
Wasicsko by 4,466 votes, 29,025 to 24,559. Vote totals generally
change slightly in the official canvass that verifies the voting
machine tallies phoned in from the polling places Tuesday night.

<HEAD>Study Indicates Radiation Not Linked to Childhood Leukemia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increases in leukemia among young people living
near nuclear plants are not caused by exposure to radiation, said a
study released Friday.
   Researchers found that death rates from leukemia and Hodgkin's
disease among young people were about as high in areas that were
only considered for nuclear plants as in areas that actually
contained nuclear plants.
   Hodgkin's disease is a cancer of the lymph glands. Researchers
said it has never been linked to radiation exposure.
   The cause of heightened cancer rates found in the study remains
a mystery.
   But the researchers said their findings indicate an increased
risk of leukemia is not associated with exposure to radiation, with
the possible exception of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant
on England's northwest coast.
   The Sellafield plant has been plagued by radioactive leaks.
Government studies have found a 10-fold increase in childhood
leukemia a mile from the plant, and concluded the plant is linked
to the disease.
   In the study released Friday, researchers from the Medical
Research Council and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund said the new
findings suggest that areas near existing and potential nuclear
sites might share ``unrecognized risk factors other than
environmental radiation pollution.''
   Dr. Sarah Darby of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund said the
findings point to something possibly ``in the lifestyle of the
young but at the present time we don't have a great deal of handle
on it.''
   The researchers investigated death statistics in 400 districts
of England and Wales near existing or potential nuclear sites. The
results were published in the The Lancet, a weekly medical journal.
   ``Excess mortality due to leukemia and Hodgkin's disease in
young people who lived near potential sites was similar to that in
young people who lived near existing sites,'' researchers wrote.
   Ms. Darby said: ``There was a 16 percent increase in childhood
leukemia mortality in areas near nuclear installations compared
with the rest of the country after adjusting for factors such as
urban-rural status. When the same analysis was carried out for
areas near potential installations, there was a 14 percent
increase.''
   ``We carried out this study because estimates of radiation
received by children living near nuclear installations are
extremely low, and it has been suggested that increases in the
number of deaths are not caused by the presence of the
installations, but by some other feature of the districts in which
they tend to be built,'' she said.
   The new findings on leukemia bolster this hypothesis, the
researchers wrote. Other previous theories, such as those involving
exposure to radon gas or viruses, could not account for all the
excess cancers in young people, they said.
   Ms. Darby said the study also would disprove stress or
psychosomatic illness being a possible cause since most people
living around the potential sites ``wouldn't have been worried
about it.''
   She said the main theory that needs investigation is ``that
people who are exposed less frequently to infection very early in
life are at a slightly higher risk of leukemia later on.''
   Mel Greaves of the Leukemia Research Fund, who originated the
theory, ``has biological reasons for thinking that is the case,''
she said.
   ``Our data support that,'' she said, explaining that areas with
a higher proportion of people in the upper social classes had a
slightly higher risk of leukemia than people in areas with a higher
proportion of manual workers.

<HEAD>Dream of Embracing West Germans May Be Nightmare For Bonn</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-East Germany, Bjt</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For decades, politicians in Bonn
dreamed of embracing East Germans in the free West. Now, Chancellor
Helmut Kohl has rushed back from Warsaw to consider whether the
flood of humanity could turn the dream into a nightmare.
   In one of the most dramatic shifts in postwar Europe, the
Communist East German government has thrown open the Berlin Wall
and also let people cross through the heavily fortified borders
into West Germany.
   The joy of those who came through by foot and car and even on
sleek skateboards only temporarily deflected attention from a
suddenly volatile Central Europe.
   On the human level, there is the question of what do with the
200,000 East Germans who already have poured into West Germany _ to
say othing of the 1 million more that some have predicted may swamp
one of Europe's most densely populated countries.
   Mayor Walter Momper of West Berlin told a session of the upper
house of Parliament the East German newcomers will keep causing
``large and weighty problems'' for West Germans.
   ``But if we never forget the suffering caused by the Berlin
Wall, and if we keep recalling the happy faces and joy of
yesterday, we can master this challenge together,'' Momper said,
speaking the day after the borders were thrown open.
   After breaking off a politically sensitive trip to Poland, Kohl
planned an emergency meeting of the Cabinet to map the country's
strategy. At issue is how to proceed both at home and in regard to
the breakneck pace of changes in East Germany.
   From a military standpoint, the two nations remain at the
forefront of still officially hostile military alliances. West
Germany is the base for 250,000 U.S. troops, while nearly 400,000
Soviet troops are based in East Germany.
   The military element is vital to the increasingly frequent
predictions the latest shifts and uncertainty in East Germany will
lead to a German reunification.
   Neither Washington nor Moscow is likely to give up completely
its front-line ally any time soon, and German neutrality is a risk
that many in West Germany are unlikely to take.
   Still, says conservative West German lawmaker Eduard Lintner:
``Reunification is coming closer, but I can't say whether it will
take 10, 15 or 20 years. We have the impression that things are
much more concrete than we could have imagined five years ago.''
   Any move toward reunification would cause unease and perhaps
resistance in the Soviet Union, France, Britain and some other
European countries.
   A reunified Germany also would mean an enormous financial
sacrifice for West Germany, as tax money from Bonn flowed eastward
to modernize increasingly outmoded factories and to clean up some
of Europe's worst pollution.
   Perhaps as an interim measure, Kohl increasingly has been
demanding democratic reforms in East Germany in direct exchange for
Bonn's financial aid, to keep East Germans from leaving in droves.
   Kohl said while still in Warsaw that West Germany ``could be
ready to offer significant economic aid if the will to reform
manifested itself in East Germany.''
   At times, it seems that Kohl talks less and less about actual
reunification the more the topic goes from a nostalgic dream into
the realm of serious discussion.
   Kohl and his top aides also have increasingly been painting a
bleak picture for the East Germans who might want to come over. It
is another sign of growing stress for the government, the strapped
social services and problems such as lack of housing for the
newcomers.
   ``Every refugee must figure that he will have to live in
inadequate housing for a fairly long time, and will probably be
living much worse than if he had stayed home,'' Interior Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble told parliament Thursday.
   Schaeuble repeated the same warning the following day, although
claiming the East Germans still are welcome.

<HEAD>Tobacco Town Readies for State's Toughest Smoking Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This tobacco town now has the state's
toughest ban on smoking, thanks to a pregnant woman who grew tired
of having smoke blown in her face at a neighborhood grocery store.
   ``People don't have the right to pump poison in me,'' said
attorney Pete Clary, who voted for the controversial referendum,
which passed by only 173 votes out of nearly 30,000 cast in
Tuesday's election.
   While Greensboro may not be on the scale of nearby Winston-Salem
or Durham in terms of tobacco production, it is still a tobacco
stronghold. Lorillard Inc., which makes Newport, Kent and True
cigarettes, is one of the city's major employers with 2,300 workers
in this town of nearly 200,000 people.
   ``We don't feel like it's going to stop here,'' said Earl
Jaggers, a union leader at the Lorillard plant. ``These people
(anti-smoking proponents) are going to move on to other cities and
states.''
   The city council could enact the ordinance within two weeks,
putting smoking bans in elevators and large retail stores, and
no-smoking sections in most restaurants.
   Otherwise, if both sides agree, the referendum would go into
effect Jan. 1, to give the restaurants and other public places time
to prepare.
   The ordinance, the toughest in any North Carolina city, requires
restaurants seating 50 or more to set aside at least 25 percent of
their seats for non-smokers.
   ``It seems like a painful pill to swallow until everything gets
worked out,'' said David Hudgins, spokesman for the group which
pushed the referendum.
   ``We're not saying, `Don't smoke,' '' he said Friday. ``We're
saying, `Don't expect me to have to breathe your smoke.'''
   Lori Faley is credited with starting the referendum after she
could do nothing about shoppers smoking in the check-out line at
her neighborhood supermarket.
   Mrs. Faley, who has since moved to Wisconsin, did not return
phone calls Friday.
   ``She backed off from being in the forefront after she received
some threats and comments,'' Hudgins explained. ``I've received
some threats, too.
   ``It took someone with courage to speak out,'' Hudgins said.
   Prior to the vote, she told a local newspaper she was frustrated
with trying to get businesses and restaurants to impose voluntary
restrictions.
   ``I tried that almost a year and a half ago when I went to
grocery stores and asked them to (impose their own bans),'' she
said. ``They just kind of looked at me funny.
   ``I asked some restaurants, and they said, `We can't enforce it
because there's no ordinance, so why don't you get an ordinance,''
Mrs. Faley said.
   So Mrs. Faley and others formed GASP _ for Greensboro to
Alleviate Smoking Pollution. Volunteers collected 7,300 signatures
calling for the referendum.
   The penalty for lighting up in a designated non-smoking area is
$25 for each offense. No penalties will be imposed in the first
year, however.
   ``There's so many families for which tobacco is their
livelihood,'' said Donnie Prago, the owner of the restaurant
``Donnie's.'' ``What we need is a generation or two in which the
kids don't go into tobacco.''
   With 14,000 tobacco farmers, the Tar Heel state produces about
two-thirds of the nation's flue-cured tobacco, which is valued at
$900 million annually. Flue-cured tobacco is used to make
cigarettes, and North Carolina's cigarette makers produce 56
percent of all domestic brands.
   Before Tuesday's vote, an organization calling itself
``Greensboro Citizens for Fairness'' mailed out 55,000 brochures to
residents asking them to vote against the ordinance.
   The group was funded by Lorillard, RJR Nabisco in Winston-Salem
and other cigarette manufactures, according to RJR spokeswoman
Betsy Annese.
   Lorillard vice president Alexander Spears became the chief
spokesman for the group fighting the ban. Opponents do not plan to
challenge the results of the vote, Spears said.
   ``I still believe a voluntary approach is the better one,''
Spears said. ``I believe restaurant owners need to have more
flexibility than the ordinance mandates.''
   The referendum also will help anti-smoking campaigns elsewhere,
he said.
   ``I am sure they will try to use this as a political plum and a
reason for other communities to follow suit and that sort of
thing,'' he said.
   Spears said he had spent most of Wednesday trying to calm irate
employees who felt betrayed by voters in a city where the tobacco
company has always worked hard to build a reputation as a good
neighbor.
   ``There's a feeling that the community was not supportive of
them as individuals,'' Spears said. ``Generally, there's a great
feeling of disappointment in the community, particularly in those
segments of the community where the referendum was so
overwhelmingly voted for.''

   President Bush said today the rapid, dramatic
change in East Germany and elsewhere in Eastern Europe ``offers us
all much hope and deserves our continued encouragement.''
   In comments at the beginning of a speech on housing, Bush took
note of East Germany's decision to open its borders for the first
time in decades and pledged to ``seize every opportunity to
contribute to lasting peace and to extend democracy.''
   Referring to his planned December summit with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Bush said ``the Malta meeting, given recent
events, takes on even more'' importance.
   In words that were greeted by applause, Bush said,
``Twenty-eight years after the desperate days of 1961, when tanks
faced off at Checkpoint Charlie and that terrible barrier was
built, now the East German government has responded to the wishes
of its people.''
   ``The changes in recent months make clear that the process of
reform initiated by the Eastern Europeans and supported by Mr.
Gorbachev, by America and by our allies is real, offers us all much
hope and deserves our continued encouragement,'' Bush said.

   The White House is considering a high-risk
move to temporarily bypass the Senate confirmation process by
giving ``recess appointments'' to a number of presidential
nominations.
   White House officials said recommendations are being prepared
for President Bush outlining the process for such a parliamentary
end-run.
   That the White House is even considering such a move reflects
frustration by Bush and his top aides over the Senate's slow pace
in acting on his nominations.
   However, the action would be certain to further inflame already
strained relations between Bush and Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Under the Constitution, the president can temporarily sidestep
the Senate's confirmation powers by appointing a person to fill a
vacancy while the Senate is in recess. Those named during Congress'
upcoming winter break could hold their jobs through the end of 1990
without Senate confirmation.
   Some of the 119 nominations now pending before the Senate have
been controversial.
   For instance, Bush's choice of James Cason for a top Agriculture
Department post has drawn fierce opposition from environmentalists
and many senators for what they allege to be a pro-development bias.
   The nomination of John M. Walker _ a cousin to Bush _ to be a
federal appeals judge in New York has been snarled in a nepotism
charge. Walker is now a U.S. district judge in New York.
   Victor Stello Jr.'s nomination as assistant secretary of energy
for defense programs has been stalled since July over criticism of
his record at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   Some ambassadorial appointments have been blocked by Senate
Democrats who claim they have few qualifications other than large
contributions to Republican campaigns.
   Also among the pending nominations are Richard G. Austin as head
of the General Services Administration, Barbara Everitt Bryant as
director of the Census Bureau, Brian W. Clymer as urban mass
transportation administrator, Michael Paul Gavin as assistant
secretary of commerce and a host of ambassadorial and judicial
appointments.
   A recess appointment might come back to haunt the officeholder
when the grace period expired.
   And there are other ways that Congress can make its will felt.
``If the recess appointee wanted to get paid, it might be a
problem,'' said an official in the Senate parliamentarian's office,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Federal law requires Bush to formally resubmit nominations of
any recess appointments once a new session of the Senate begins in
order for the official to get his or her paycheck.
   Chase Untermeyer, White House personnel director, said Thursday
he is preparing recommendations for Bush on the possible use of
recess appointments this year. ``I've done it on my own, without
direction of the president or the chief of staff (John Sununu),''
said Untermeyer.
   However, he added, ``I've not been told to stop.''
   Another White House official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said: ``We're not anxious to do this. This is only a
last resort. But it is something we may be compelled to do.''
   At a news conference Tuesday, Bush, who often has vented his
frustration at the slow pace of Senate consideration of his
nominees, accused the Democratic-led Congress of ``blocking
everything I do.''
   Meanwhile, Mitchell repeatedly has accused Bush of foot-dragging
on other key government positions. He told the Senate recently that
Bush had failed to ``make nominations for nearly half'' of the key
executive branch jobs and that Bush's criticism of Senate inaction
was ``unfounded and unfair.''
   Another controversial judicial nomination involves Vaughn
Walker, who is no relation to John Walker.
   Vaughn Walker is being questioned because of his past membership
in a private club that long barred blacks from joining and still
refuses to admit women. Vaughn Walker has been nominated for a
federal district judge in Northern California.
   ``Frankly, I'm concerned that he was too slow to grasp the
significance of his membership,'' Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, told a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Thursday. ``I
still wonder whether he resigned because he believed his club
membership was wrong or because he sought to curry favor with the
Senate.''
   Vaughn Walker told the panel the proceedings have made him
``more sensitive now than I was about the need for a federal judge
to conduct the courtrooms of the United States in a way to insure
fairness.''
   Walker resigned his 15-year membership in San Francisco's
Olympic Club in a Feb. 15 letter.

<HEAD>Feds Finish Counting Cocaine Bags Hidden in Lye Strong Enough to
Eat Concrete</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a week of sifting through barrels of lye
in a warehouse, federal drug agents announced Friday they had
turned up 10,648 pounds of cocaine _ one of the largest seizures in
U.S. history.
   The cocaine _ valued at nearly $852 million, or $80,000 a pound
_ was wrapped in plastic and topped with 6 inches of powder that
turned out to be a 98 percent concentration of sodium hydroxide, an
extremely caustic lye.
   To extricate the cocaine, scores of law enforcers wore ``moon
suits'' _ oxygen masks, 40-pound air tanks, and protective suits,
the sleeves sealed with tape to two pairs of gloves.
   The gloves had to be changed twice an hour because the lye ate
through them that quickly.
   Sodium hydroxide at that concentration can eat through concrete;
it is nearly 25 times more concentrated than household drain
cleaner.
   The cocaine was discovered Nov. 3 during a raid on the
three-story warehouse. Investigators were searching for five
suspects believed linked to the Cali drug cartel of Colombia.
   Drug Enforcement Agency officials said a ship, the New York
Senator, brought the cocaine to Philadelphia from Panama late last
month; it was then trucked to New York.
   The investigation, begun by U.S. Customs, soon encompassed city
and Nassau County police, the DEA and the Emergency Medical Service.
   The teams worked around the clock, painstakingly opening the
drums and decontaminating, repackaging and removing the cocaine _
except on Sunday, when New York Marathon participants ran past the
cordoned-off site.
   DEA spokeswoman Mary Cooper said it was one of the five largest
cocaine seizures in the nation's history.
   Customs Special Agent Rick Mercier said the drug could be
tainted with the lye despite its wrapping.
   ``We strongly suspect other smuggling has occurred using this
method,'' said Mercier. ``The potential is there that cocaine on
the street may have been contaminated. From a user's standpoint,
how do they know they're getting cocaine that hasn't been tainted?''
   The chemical can irritate the skin and respiratory tract and can
cause blindness. The damage is compounded when it's smoked or
injected.
   Mercier said Thursday's rain caused ``major safety concerns''
for the workers because slight dampness, such as from rain or
sweat, can activate the lye's caustic properties. Still, no
injuries were reported.

   Convicted ``Night Stalker'' Richard Ramirez
had his jailhouse television and visiting privileges suspended for
10 days after he vandalized a ceiling air vent, authorities said
Friday.
   Ramirez was disciplined for damaging the vent while taking a
shower at the Men's Central Jail on Thursday, said Sheriff's deputy
George Ducoulombier.
   Ramirez was sentenced to death Tuesday and was awaiting transfer
to San Quentin.
   The incident was being ``handled strictly as a disciplinary
action,'' the deputy said. ``It is not considered by the custody
authorities as an attempt to escape. ... The air vent was not large
enough for a person to get into.''
   Ramirez faces the gas chamber for his conviction of 13 murders
and 30 charges stemming from a string of nighttime rapes and
burglaries. As with all death sentences, Ramirez's case will
automatically be appealed to state Supreme Court.

<HEAD>Cheney: Caution Needed As Eastern Europe Reforms</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-US-East Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Friday the
United States must react with caution to changes sweeping the
Warsaw Pact, but the revolutionary developments ``might portend
some changes'' for the NATO alliance if peaceful reforms continue.
   ``The opening of the (Berlin) wall, it's a major event, but it's
important for us to think about what comes after that,'' Cheney
said in an interview at the Pentagon, minutes after the East German
government announced that its open-border policy would become
permanent.
   Cheney said the U.S. government must develop a long-term
strategy to deal with the developments that have rocked Europeans
on either side of the Iron Curtain.
   ``What kinds of governments will develop in the East, will they
be democratically elected? ... What kind of security arrangements
are going to exist between those nations and the Soviet Union? Do
they constitute any kind of threat to the West?'' Cheney asked.
   ``If you get non-communist governments in Eastern Europe,
they're likely to be less of a threat than has been true in the
past in the military sense, and that obviously might portend some
changes on our side,'' Cheney said.
   The secretary said the United States and the governments of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, ``need to be cautious.''
   ``We need to digest these changes. Clearly we welcome them, but
we have to be little reserved about formulating major policy shifts
until we have an opportunity to see what happens,'' Cheney said,
adding that he finds the developments in Poland, Hungary and East
Germany ``very positive. The trend's very much in the right
direction.''
   Cheney has said repeatedly that he doesn't see the need for any
immediate changes in the force structure of NATO or realignment of
the alliance because of the reforms instigated in the East.
   East German Ambassador Gerhard Herder also urged caution Friday,
speaking at the National Press Club.
   ``I don't want to hide before you that these developments are
very dangerous. They could lead, if they get out of control, to
bigger conflicts,'' Herder said.
   Herder noted that East German armed forces are only a short
distance away from American, British and French forces stationed in
West Berlin. ``By any miscalculation, they could be involved. This
could lead to a conflict,'' he said.
   A former military commander of the NATO forces, retired Gen.
Bernard Rogers, said Friday the changes in Europe will result in
pressures to reduce the 340,000-member U.S. military force in
Europe.
   ``We'll find that there will have to be withdrawals from Western
Europe, because we can't afford to keep our troops there,'' Rogers
said on NBC-TV.
   Rogers, who served from 1979 to 1987 as NATO's commander, said a
partial U.S. withdrawal would require the revision of NATO
strategy, affecting the so-called ``forward defense'' that keeps
U.S. troops on the front lines in Europe should war break out.
   The retired general, asked as well about the possible
reunification of Germany, said he believed ``the events so far lead
us in that direction,'' but that the Soviet Union and many nations
in Western Europe are ``very concerned'' about such a development.
   Cheney, asked about U.S. support for Germany in the midst of the
refugee influx, said he'd sent orders to Gen. John Galvin, NATO's
European commander and the top U.S. military man in Europe, to
provide ``whatever assistance he can'' to the West German
government.
   The defense secretary emphasized that the Soviet Union has said
it wants preserve the Warsaw Pact, ``and I don't see there's any
need for us to challenge that at this point.''
   He said that while he, President Bush and Secretary of State
James A. Baker III all welcome the changes, ``We want the changes
to occur peaceably.''
   ``While we want to encourage freedom and democracy, it's the
kind of change we hope will occur without violence, without a
resort to force,'' he said.
   Cheney said that at this point, it appears there have been no
alerts called among the East European military forces, and that
among the East German police, border patrol and military ``the
spirit, the mood is very positive, very upbeat.''

<TEXT>
   Excerpts of President John F. Kennedy's speech June 26, 1963,
outside City Hall in Berlin:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   There are many people in the world who really don't understand _
or say they don't understand _ what is the great issue between the
free world and the Communist world. Let them come to Berlin.
   There are some who say that Communism is the wave of the future.
Let them come to Berlin.
   And there are some who say in Europe and elsewhere ``we can work
with the Communists.'' Let them come to Berlin.
   And there are even a few who say that it's true that Communism
is an evil system but it permits us to make economic progress. Let
them come to Berlin.
   Freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect. But
we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to
prevent them from leaving us.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   While the wall is the most obvious and vivid demonstration of
the failures of the Communist system, all the world can see we take
no satisfaction in it, for it is, as your Mayor has said, an
offense not only against history, but an offense against humanity,
separating families, dividing husbands and wives and brothers and
sisters and dividing a people who wish to be joined together.
   What is true of this city is true of Germany. Real lasting peace
in Europe can never be assured as long as one German out of four is
denied the elementary right of free men, and that is to make a free
choice.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Freedom is indivisible and when one man is enslaved who are
free? When all are free, then we can look forward to that day when
this city will be joined as one and this country and this great
continent of Europe in a peaceful and hopeful globe.
   When that day finally comes, as it will, the people of West
Berlin can take sober satisfaction in the fact that they were in
the front lines for almost two decades.
   All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin.
And therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words ``Ich bin
ein Berliner.''

<HEAD>Holocaust Survivors Thank Sweden For Their Rebirths</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Seven Holocaust survivors thanked Sweden on
Friday for providing a safe haven to heal their mental and physical
wounds after World War II.
   ``If there is a heaven on this Earth, it was in Sweden for me
and many others,'' Seva Scheer of St. Paul, who survived the
Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps, told an
international conference on the role of Scandinavians in rescuing
Jews during World War II.
   The conference drew about 150 scholars, survivors and
representatives of Nordic governments to the University of
Minnesota and included several people featured in the book
``Witnesses to the Holocaust: An Oral History.''
   The book, being published next month by Twayne Publishers-G.K.
Hall &amp; Co. of Boston and edited by Rhoda Lewin of Minneapolis,
contains the accounts of survivors, as well as liberators.
   Another survivor featured Friday was Reidar Dittmann, a
Norwegian Lutheran who ended up in Buchenwald concentration camp
for his activities in the Norwegian resistance movement while an
Oslo University student.
   Now a college art history professor, Dittmann, 67, said Sweden
was the only Scandinavian country capable of providing significant
relief for Jews after World War II ended. Sweeden was able to keep
its economy intact due to its neutral status during the war.
   Dittmann says he owes his survival to Swedish Count Folke
Bernadotte, who persuaded Heinrich Himmler to allow his country to
take Scandinavian inmates from the camps in March 1945, two months
before V-E Day.
   ``I weighed 92 pounds,'' Dittmann says in the book. ``If my stay
in Buchenwald had lasted for another two months, I wouldn't have.''
   Dittmann said Sweden rescued 38,000 Norwegians and Danes from
concentration camps after World War II.
   Fred Baron, 66, of Golden Valley, who was born in Austria, and
his wife, Judy Baron, 61, of Romania both ended up in the
Bergen-Belsen but didn't meet until after the war when they found
themselves in a Swedish hospital.
   Mrs. Baron credits the Swedish government for restoring her
health and giving her an education.
   But Sweden was not as kind to Jews before the war, recalled her
husband.
   ``As it is well known, the world closed itself and refused to
take in any of these would-be Jewish immigrants. Sweden,
unfortunately like most of the other Scandinavian countries and
other countries in the world, was no exception. During the course
of the war...the attitude certainly changed,'' he said.
   ``I know that I owe my physical health, my sanity to the efforts
of the Swedish government and the people,'' Baron said. ``This
helped to restore us and we regained a measure of confidence in the
human race.'' Baron said he came to Minnesota after the war, in
part because of his warm feelings for people of Scandinavian
descent.
   Julius Ancer of Minnetonka survived the war by concealing his
Jewish identity, later married his teen-age sweetheart, Nusia, who
was among only a few survivors from his hometown in Poland.
Eventually they moved as refugees to Sweden.
   ``We were amazed how friendly officials and the population were.
I didn't believe people could be so friendly to a bunch of
strangers who couldn't even communicate,'' Ancer said. ``Not only
did the Swedish government help us with our every need, but also
through them I got my education.
   ``This was like a rebirth,'' he said.
   Ms. Scheer, 68, experienced the same emotional healing in
Sweden, where the only things she possessed upon her arrival were
the pajamas she was wearing. She recalled the delight she felt when
she was taken to a store in Sweden and given new clothes.
   ``I have no desire to go back to the place where I was born, but
someday I would like to revisit Sweden again, the place where I was
reborn.''
   The seventh person to echo the sentiments of thanks on Friday
was Rosa Nisenholz, 64, from St. Paul.
   Some 30,000 Jews were brought to Sweden after the war, said Inga
Gottfarb, author of ``The Fatal Oblivion,'' which is about
Holocaust survivors Sweden and elsewhere.

   A crowd demanding the release of protesters
arrested during a Revolution Day gathering clashed with police in
the capital of the southwest republic of Moldavia on Friday night
and people were injured, a witness said.
   Vladimir Solonar said he saw police fire in the air after
members of the Moldavian People's Front political organization
stormed Interior Ministry headquarters in downtown Kishinev, the
capital.
   Solonar, a history lecturer at Kishinev State University and
member of another political group, said by telephone that some
people were injured in ensuing clashes but he had no details.
   A police duty officer, speaking by telephone from the offices
that were stormed, confirmed a demonstration took place, with
casualties. He said some policemen were seriously hurt and the
Health Ministry was determining whether demonstrators were also
injured.
   The officer refused to give his name or details. He said his
superior was busy consulting with Moscow about the clashes.
   At one point during the protest, the crowd stopped and
overturned an ambulance, Solonar said.
   The protesters were demanding the release of about 20 people
arrested Tuesday as they gathered at a monument to a national hero
near the route of a scheduled parade to mark the 72nd anniversary
of Communist power. Activists said police beat people in that crowd.
   A military parade was canceled but a demonstration of workers
went off as scheduled. Thousands of People's Front supporters later
marched the same route with slogans condemning the police and the
republic's leadership.
   Moldavia, with a population of 4.3 million on the border with
Romania, is among the restive Soviet republics where people are
clamoring for more independence from Moscow and preservation of the
local language and culture.

<HEAD>Developer Says $40 Million Goal To Be Met</HEAD>

   A nightclub and restaurant developer said
Friday he would give enough money to ensure that the proposed Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame reaches its $40 million fund-raising goal by
next week's deadline.
   Hall of Fame planners in Cleveland have until Wednesday to raise
the money, according to an agreement signed in May with the New
York-based Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation Inc.
   ``The last time I talked to the rock hall people, they were
saying they are within $500,000 of their goal, so I told them I
would commit so that they would get over the top,'' Jeffrey Jacobs,
owner and developer of the Nautica entertainment and restaurant
complex near the proposed site of the rock music shrine, said
Friday.
   Jacobs said his contribution would come from money raised in
concerts at his 4,000-seat Nautica Stage outdoor theater.
   ``We're going to do several things, including put a $1 surcharge
on all tickets to events at the Nautica Stage, and there will be
one benefit concert every summer for three years,'' he said.
   ``We feel very confident we will make the goal by Nov. 15,''
Larry Thompson, rock hall director in Cleveland, said. Thompson
said he expects a 1990 groundbreaking.

<HEAD>U.N. Says Namibian Election is `Commendably Dull'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HEIDI VON EGIDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 90 percent of eligible voters
have cast ballots in a pre-independence election that appeared
headed for a successful conclusion, the United Nations said Friday,
the second-last day of voting.
   ``The situation in Namibia is commendably dull,'' said U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard. ``The process seems to be going extremely
well.''
   Also Friday, a 12-member U.S. delegation appointed by President
Bush and led by former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie arrived to
observe the election being watched by representatives from around
the world.
   The five-days of balloting, whose results are expected by
Wednesday, will determine a constituent assembly that will write a
constitution paving the way for independence after 74 years of
South African rule. No date for independence has been set, but it
is expected to be early next year.
   Around 90 percent of the 701,483 registered voters cast ballots
through Friday, Eckhard said. U.N. and territorial officials said
the turnout could near 100 percent by the time the balloting ends
Saturday evening.
   As of Friday, no reports of serious political violence were
reported and there were few instances of intimidation. Officials
reported some election code violations such as anonymous smear
pamphlets aimed at discrediting the South-West Africa People's
Organization, the favorite at the polls.
   A Namibian journalist covering the elections, Martin Erastus,
has been missing since Monday when he was seen near the
Namibia-Angola border. Police are investigating.
   The key election issue is whether SWAPO will win two-thirds of
the vote necessary to write a constitution without consulting the
other nine parties. The left-leaning organization waged a 23-year
bush war against South African rule.
   SWAPO is challenged by the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, a
multiracial coalition that favors a capitalist economy, was part of
the transitional government installed by South Africa.
   The U.N. has more than 7,000 military and civilian personnel
monitoring the election in the sparsely populated, mineral-rich
territory.
   Assembly seats will be allocated according to the proportion of
votes received by each party, and the assembly is to convene one
week after the results are final.
   South Africa captured the territory from Germany in World War I.
It resisted U.N. efforts to get it to leave but finally agreed to
grant independence under U.N. supervision.
   An estimated 60 percent of Namibia's voters are illiterate. The
318,252-  square-mile territory had a population of 1.3 million in
1981, when the last census was taken.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Telephone callers in the Chicago suburbs should
be touching some new numbers Saturday, as the suburbs leave the
familiar 312 area code for a new number: 708.
   ``In the Chicago metropolitan area, about 90 percent of our
customers have awareness of the change,'' said Pat Montgomery, a
spokeswoman for Illinois Bell. ``Outside the Chicago area that
number is probably less.
   ``We're urging the Chicago-area people to make sure their
out-of-town customers, relatives and friends know about the
change,'' said Miss Montgomery on Friday.
   The phone company is running out of prefixes _ the first three
digits after the area code. The shortage is not due to population
growth but to the increase in new services that require separate
telephone numbers, such as Fax machines, said Bell officials.
   The 312 area code will remain for the city, and 708 will be
applied to surrounding towns. The new area code will extend roughly
from city limits north to Wisconsin, west to Hampshire and Oswego,
east to Indiana and south to Peotone and Beecher.
   About 1.5 million residential lines, 750,000 business lines and
36,000 pay phones will carry the new 708 code.
   While Illinois Bell says the change won't cost customers
anything now or in the future, businesses have had to deal with new
business cards, stationery and notifying out-of-state associates.
The change was announced two years ago, and there appeared to be
little last-minute panic among businesses, officials said.
   ``The department has not received a great deal of alarm or
concern from businesses about making the transition,'' said
Laurence Msall, assistant to the director of the Illinois
Department of Commerce and Community Affairs.
   Debra Hale, spokeswoman for the Chicago Association of Commerce
and Industry, said businesses have called the change a minor
annoyance.
   There will be a grace period _ from Nov. 11 until Feb. 10 _ when
both the old and new systems will work. Calls between the city and
its suburbs will go through without use of the area codes and calls
from other areas will go through to the suburbs with either the old
or new code.
   But on Feb. 11, callers must dial ``1'' plus the area code for
calls between the 312 and 708 area-code zones.
   Those using the 312 code for the suburbs will be reminded by a
recording asking them to call again with the new code.
   Chicago follows several other metropolitan areas forced to split
from former area-code comrades for want of new prefixes. Last year,
Colorado, Florida and the Boston area all integrated new area
codes. New Jersey is on the docket for 1990.

   A medical examiner ruled Friday that the death of
an infant delivered by Caesarean section after its mother was shot
to death was a homicide, adding a second murder charge if a suspect
is ever found.
   Suffolk County Medical Examiner Gerald Feigin concluded after an
autopsy that the 17-day-old boy died Thursday as a result of
complications stemming from the gunshot wound his mother sustained
last month. The infant was eight weeks premature.
   Christopher Stuart died at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the
same hospital where his parents had attended a birthing class the
night they were shot.
   Carol Stuart, 30, a lawyer who was seven months pregnant, and
her husband, Charles, 29, a furrier, were accosted in their car at
a stop light a few minutes after they left the hospital. A gunman
forced them to drive a short distance where he robbed them and shot
Mrs. Stuart in the head and her husband in the abdomen. Charles
Stuart managed to contact rescuers using a cellular telephone in
his car.
   Mrs. Stuart died shortly after delivering the baby. Christopher
Stuart remained at the neonatal intensive care unit at the hospital
until his death.
   Charles Stuart, who has been hospitalized since the shooting,
was taken by ambulance from Boston City Hospital to Brigham and
Women's on Thursday where his son lay dying.
   ``Everybody in the city of Boston was really praying beyond hope
that Christopher would make it,'' Mayor Raymond L. Flynn said.
   Charles Stuart was back at Boston City Hospital on Friday,
listed in stable condition. His brother, Mark Stuart, said the
family has retained a lawyer to handle inquiries from reporters.
   ``We've all suffered enough, we can't say anymore,'' he said
Friday.
   The gunman remains at large, and Flynn said police were still
pursuing leads.

<HEAD>Magazine Reports More Active Discussions of Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Discussions of the possible release of
the 18 Western hostages held in Lebanon have become more active, a
magazine said Friday.
   In a report that cited no sources, the weekly Ash-Shiraa said
the U.S. release of Iranian assets this week while Iran's foreign
minister was in Algiers indicated the matter was getting more
attention.
   ``It is known that the issue of foreign hostages in Lebanon has
been put on the front burner and developments could come up
concerning the release of some of the hostages very soon,'' the
magazine said in a two-paragraph story.
   It has made similar predictions regularly since November 1987,
when it broke the story of the arms-for-hostages deal between the
United States and Iran. None of its recent hostage reports have
been accurate.
   Eight of the Western hostages in Lebanon are Americans,
including the one held longest: Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent of The Associated Press, kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Iran repeated on Friday that the U.S. release this week of $567
million in frozen Iranian assets would not affect the status of the
American hostages, most of whom are held by Shiite Moslem
kidnappers loyal to Iran.
   Tehran television quoted Eftekhar Jahroomi, legal adviser to
President Hashemi Rafsanjani, as saying the U.S. action Monday
merely complied with a decision of the U.S.-Iranian claims
commission set up in 1981 after talks in Algiers.
   ``The payment was solely in line with the Algiers agreements,''
Jahroomi said. ``Iran's claims against American banks were
similarly paid.''
   Algeria was the main mediator in negotiations that led to the
release in January 1981 of 52 Americans held hostage 444 days at
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency had said the
purpose of Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati's 3-day trip to
Algeria was to discuss relations between the two countries.
   President Bush said Tuesday he hoped return of the assets would
encourage Iran to seek release of the hostages, but U.S. officials
also insisted the transfer was not related to the hostage issue.
   Rafsanjani, leader of the ``pragmatists'' who seek to end Iran's
isolation, told a news conference last month he would help secure
freedom for the hostages if the United States released all Iranian
assets frozen after the embassy was stormed in 1979.
   Iran says the assets now are worth $12 billion, including the
value of weapons purchased by the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlevi,
who was overthrown by the Islamic revolution in February 1989.

<HEAD>Navy Denies Reports of Looting Aboard USS Iowa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Navy spokesman denied on Friday a published
report that sailors aboard the USS Iowa took part in looting
shipmates' possessions while they battled the explosion that killed
47 sailors.
   The Washington Times reported in its Friday edition that it had
received a letter from an officer aboard the Iowa who said looting
occurred while the damage control efforts were going on.
   The officer was not identified in the Times report, but the
paper also quoted a former Iowa sailor, gunner's mate David James,
as saying he was informed of such looting by a master at arms on
the ship.
   ``You are correct that there was looting while the damage
control efforts were ongoing on 19 April. ...'' the Times quoted
the officer as writing.
   ``Those who did the looting were punished either at captain's
mast or at special court martial,'' he added.
   Two other sailors also have told the Times they heard while on
board the ship that looting occurred, although they had not
actually witnessed the thefts.
   Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley called the assertions
``completely false.''
   ``This is a rumor that has persisted since the day of the
explosion,'' Quigley said of the April 19 blast in the battleship's
No. 2 gun turret.
   ``There is no record whatsoever of any tampering with crew
lockers. There was no one seen in the berthing area. There was
nothing strewn around the crew quaters,'' Quigley said.
   ``I am sure there are sailors aboard the Iowa who believe this
occurred, but there is no record that such a thing ever happened.''
   Quigley said that while the Naval Investigative Service included
testimony about such alleged actions in its report on the
explosion, such activity was never found to have taken place.
   As well, he said, there is no record of any court martial having
been convened, and such a procedure would be a matter of public
record.
   In its report issued Sept. 7, the Navy concluded that gunner's
mate Clayton Hartwig of Ohio ``most likely'' caused the explosion
by inserting some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in
one of the ship's 16-inch guns.
   Following complaints from Hartwig's family about the report,
several congressional investigations of the Navy's report have been
opened.
   On Thursday, the author of the report, Rear Adm. Richard
Milligan, is scheduled to testify about his findings before the
Senate Armed Services Committee.

   East German Ambassador Gerhard Herder said
Friday his country would be a ``predictable partner'' of the West
in maintaining peace but warned that any miscalculation in reacting
to the liberalization of his homeland could lead to conflict.
   Herder noted that armed forces of three allies are stationed in
Berlin _ the United States, Britain and France.
   ``By any miscalculation, they could be involved. This could lead
to a conflict,'' he said in a speech at the National Press Club.
   The Soviet Union also has troops in Berlin, and the city itself
lies more than 100 miles inside East Germany and the East German
and Soviet forces of the Warsaw Pact.
   ``I don't want to hide before you that these developments are
very dangerous. They could lead, if they get out of control, to
bigger conflicts.''
   Herder said President Bush's reaction to the events in Berlin
was ``encouraging'' and said he hoped the changes in his country
would open up a new phase in relations with the United States.
   ``My country has always been in the forefront'' of efforts to
maintain stability in Central Europe and intends to remain ``a
predictable partner'' of the West in that effort.
   His government's decision to grant freedom of travel is
irreversible: ``If there are still people who believe the changes
are cosmetic, they are victims of an outlived era of suspicion and
mistrust.''
   He was asked whether he could foresee a unified Germany.
   ``In my dreams, yes. But being a politician, I don't see any
prospect for a united Germany,'' Herder said, because East and West
Germany are ``integrated into military alliances guaranteeing a
stable balance of power'' in Europe.
   Asked whether the December meeting between Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev would decide German reunification,
Herder said, ``I don't think it's a matter to be decided by Mr.
Bush and Mr. Gorbachev'' but rather a matter to be decided by the
people of the two Germanies.
   Asked whether he could envisage a crackdown similar to that by
Chinese authorities against pro-democracy demonstrators in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square last June, Herder said, ``I exclude it
personally and I can tell you'' the East German government is
committed to ``solve all problems by political means.''
   Asked whether the Berlin Wall would come down, he replied, ``We
should have no illusions and not be led by euphoria.''

<HEAD>Longtime Mayor Steps Down Due To Rare Illness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ERIE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Louis Tullio stepped down Friday after
nearly 24 years in office, appointing an aide to fill the remaining
seven weeks of his term as he battles a rare, fatal illness.
   A letter delivered Friday to City Clerk James Klemm said the
six-term mayor has appointed Patricia Liebel, a longtime assistant,
as acting mayor effective immediately.
   ``I told him I did not want him to do it, and he felt like he
had to do it,'' Ms. Liebel said at a news conference. ``I hated to
see it happen at this point when we're within six weeks of a new
administration.''
   Tullio, 73, suffers from amyloidosis, a rare and fatal disease
that deposits proteins in the heart, kidneys and other major
organs. The illness has weakened Tullio's heart and lungs and
confined him to his home since May.
   Pittsburgh Mayor Richard Caliguiri died of the same illness in
May 1988.
   Ms. Liebel, who lost a bid for the Democratic mayoral nomination
in the May primary, will fill the post until Dec. 31. Councilwoman
Joyce Savocchio, who was elected Mayor Tuesday in this northwestern
Pennsylvania city of 120,000, takes over then.
   ``Because I feel this year's budget is so important, I feel it
is essential for someone to be readily available to meet and to
make decisions,'' Tullio's letter said.

<HEAD>Government Orders Retrial Investigation in Mindszenty Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors are examining the case of
Cardinal Jozsef Mindszenty, one of the Cold War's most famous
victims, and he may be cleared of treason charges, the official
news agency MTI said Friday..
   Officials ordered earlier this year that the prosecutor
general's office review the case against the late Roman Catholic
primate, who was convicted at a show trial in 1949.
   The reform movement sweeping Hungary already has brought the
posthumous rehabilitation of Imre Nagy, who led the anti-Stalinist
uprising that was crushed by Soviet tanks in 1956.
   Mindszenty was sentenced to life in prison for high treason
after confessing, presumably under duress or drugs, to most of the
charges against him.
   ``It was established during the re-examination that the relevant
authorities committed law violations which also affected the
sentence passed,'' MTI said.
   ``Presumably, the persons interrogated during the criminal
procedure made their confessions under the impact of violence or
compulsion,'' it reported, without elaboration.
   A ``major proportion'' of the material proof on which the
verdict was based was missing from files, according to the report.
MTI did not say how long the investigation might take.
   Mindszenty had been appointed head of the Hungarian church with
the Communist government's assent, but was arrested at the end of
1948 as tension grew between the church and state.
   He was freed during the 1956 uprising and took refuge in the
U.S. Embassy. Mindszenty stayed there until 1971, when he left
under an agreement worked out with the Vatican.
   He died in 1975 at age 83, while living in self-imposed exile in
Vienna.

<HEAD>New Leader `No Democrat,' Lantos Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said Friday that
Bulgaria's new leader Petar Mladenov was ``no democrat,'' although
he might surprise the world just as Egon Krenz has in East Germany.
   Lantos, who has known members of the Bulgarian leadership for
many years, said he met with Communist Party leader Todor Zhivkov
at his Black Sea summer palace in August.
   Zhivkov, the Soviet bloc's longest-serving party leader,
resigned Friday in a surprise move. But Lantos said he wasn't
surprised.
   ``I expected this,'' the Hungarian-born lawmaker said in an
interview from his California office.
   ``The Bulgarian people have always looked to the Hungarians as
their role model. Once democracy started breaking out in Hungary,
Bulgaria could not be far behind.''
   Hungary will be the first East European nation to hold free
elections, probably next spring. A fledgling pro-democracy movement
has sprung up in Bulgaria in recent months.
   Lantos said he found Zhivkov ``in good shape and good spirits.
He never seems to age.''
   ``He spoke of reform, and I urged him to match his words with
actions,'' Lantos said, adding that Zhivkov urged him to help bring
about U.S. investments and joint ventures in Bulgaria.
   ``This is largely a generational change,'' Lantos said of the
power shuffle in Bulgaria. ``Mladenov was Zhivkov's boy in the
foreign ministry. He's no democrat, although he sounds more
moderate.''
   But Lantos noted that when East Germany's ailing ruler Erich
Honecker stepped down last month, everyone said Krenz, his
successor, was just a younger version of the hardline leader.
   However, Krenz this week opened East German borders, allowing
residents to travel freely.
   ``You might see a parallel development in Bulgaria, too,''
Lantos said.

<HEAD>Georgetown Paper Skips Publication Over Ad For Abortion Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgetown University students refused to
publish an edition of their newspaper Friday because officials of
the Roman Catholic institution had forbidden them to run an
advertisement on an abortion rights rally.
   The university's stand on the advertisement prompted swift
protests from pro-choice organizations and national education
groups.
   ``The ad was not promoting any specific service,'' said Karl
Hente, a senior who serves as the paper's managing editor. ``The ad
was for a pro-choice rally and was basically expressing a political
viewpoint. The newspaper's foundation is freedom of expression.''
   The twice-weekly Georgetown Hoya had first asked university
officials to review the ad, but when the university was slow to
respond, the paper's student board of directors voted on Wednesday
to include the ad in Friday's edition.
   The school's dean of students, Jack deGioia, then told newspaper
officials that they could not publish the issue with the ad, and
the paper's board responded by voting unanimously not to put out a
paper at all.
   The newspaper did print up several thousand flyers explaining
the decision not to publish and distributed them around campus.
   ``The reaction has been overwhelmingly positive,'' Hente said.
``I got to some academic buildings, and I found that some
professors had already posted them on their office doors, while
others were talking about it in their classes.''
   The American Association of University Professors, which was
meeting on Georgetown's campus, issued a statement supporting the
students' decision not to publish. The resolution was also endorsed
by the United States National Student Association, the Association
of American Colleges, and several other education groups.
   ``We are a Catholic, Jesuit institution, and we don't allow
advertisements of condoms, abortions or things like that,'' said
Georgetown spokesman Gary Krull. ``Basically it was an interpretive
question between the dean of students _ the paper's publisher _ and
the student editorial board.''
   The rally, which will be held Sunday at the Lincoln Memorial, is
designed to build support for family planning and a woman's right
to an abortion.
   National Organization for Women president Molly Yard, whose
organization is sponsoring the event, chastised Georgetown.
   ``I'm kind of horrified that any university would deny free
speech,'' Yard said. ``That they are afraid to allow open diologue
... isn't a very good teaching example to a group that is there to
get an education.''
   Hente said that the newspaper would accept _ and try to publish
_ any other advertisements submitted in the future for rallies or
forums sponsored by groups like NOW.
   ``We're not out for publicity,'' Hente said. ``We just want to
publish, but this is something we take very seriously.''

   Authorities said Friday they had arrested a
Colombian accused of smuggling 50 tons of cocaine into the United
States and Mexican policemen who protected him.
   Federal judicial police confiscated a half-ton of cocaine,
weapons, vehicles, jet fuel and radio communications gear, Deputy
Attorney General Javier Coello Trejo told a news conference.
   He said Jorge Humberto Chalarca Cortes, known as El Negro, was
the main representative in Mexico of the Medellin cartel, the most
notorious Colombian cocaine gang.
   Coello said Chalarca was a close associate of alleged Medellin
cartel leader Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha. He said the Colombian was
arrested Thursday night at his Mexico City apartment along with his
Venezuelan wife, Cristina Rosas Rodriguez.
   Chalarca's operation moved at least 50 tons of cocaine to the
United States through Mexico the past four years, Coello said, most
of it via California and Florida.
   The other suspects were apprehended in a series of operations by
federal drug agents in Mexico City, Mazatlan and northern
Tamaulipas and Sonora states, he said.
   Among them was the head of the state police in Tamaulipas,
Arturo Cuellar Tijerina, and one of Cuellar's agents, Carlos
Eduardo Perales, the deputy attorney general told reporters. He
said Perales admitted obtaining jet fuel in McAllen, Texas, for the
gang's clandestine landing strips.
   McAllen is on the Texas-Tamaulipas border across from Reynosa.
   Among other suspects is an employee of the Mexican government
telephone company, Yolanda Haxiola Sandoval. Coello said she helped
Charlarca avoid detection by arranging for his calls to Colombia to
be registered as official government calls.
   He said another telephone company employee was being sought.
   Two other suspects, Alejandro Bernal Madrigal and a U.S. citizen
named Julio Chagy de la Rosa, admitted using a Miami business to
launder drug money, he said.
   Coello said U.S. authorities and Interpol, the international
police organization, cooperated in the investigation.

   Rain and melting snow pushed rivers over
their banks, sweeping away one house and two mobile homes,
collapsing part of a bridge and forcing as many as 80 people to
evacuate, officials said Friday.
   Flood warnings remained in effect Friday along the Nooksack and
three other rivers in northwestern Washington, with the National
Weather Service predicting warm weather and occasionally heavy rain
in the Cascade Mountains.
   The worst problems were in Whatcom County, where the loss of a
bridge over the Nooksack cut off access to about 10,000 to 11,000
people, although some could be reached overland through Canada,
said Gary Myers of the county's Department of Emergency Services.
   Two days of warm rain melted snow on 10,775-foot Mount Baker,
filling the river's three forks.
   As many as 60 people were evacuated in Whatcom County and fewer
than two dozen left their homes in Skagit County, officials said.
   In the Glacier area, 90 miles north of Seattle, a vacation house
``collapsed into (Canyon) creek'' and two recreational mobile homes
``were pinned against some trees'' along Glacier Creek, said
volunteer fire Capt. Tim Coralline. No one was injured, Myers said.
   Flood warnings also were posted along the Skagit, Snoqualmie and
Snohomish, rivers.
   Washington 9 and 544 were closed at Everson, where most of the
evacuations occurred. Washington 542 _ called the Mount Baker
Highway and the county's main east-west road _ was closed at
Nugent's Corner, when an 80-foot section of bridge collapsed
Thursday, Myers said.
   Myers said some high-bottom vehicles were able to pass through
Everson for about 2{ hours early Friday before the water rose again.
   ``Wherever the river is, we're having problems right now,''
Myers said. ``A lot of the secondary roads that would normally take
up the slack are having problems, too.''
   Leslie Salisbury of the state Transportation Department said the
bridge at Nugent's Corner had been closed several hours before the
collapse and would take at least several weeks to repair.
   Whatcom County Executive Shirley Van Zanten declared the county
a disaster area, and state transportation officials authorized
emergency funding so people and equipment could be hired as needed.
   Earlier, 25 to 30 people were evacuated from a trailer home park
in Everson as waters reached about three feet in the town Thursday.
An additional 20 people were evacuated from the Glacier area.
   At Everson, volunteers coordinated by the fire department placed
sandbags around city hall and other buildings, said Mary Branham,
assistant city clerk.

<HEAD>Major Exchange of Soviet, American Art Exhibits Announced</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major Soviet-American exchange of eight art
exhibitions over the next five years, tentatively scheduled to
appear in more than a dozen museums across the United States and
Soviet Union, was announced Friday.
   At a news conference in a gilded salon at the Soviet Embassy,
Ambassador Yuri Dubinin said he hoped the new cultural exchange
would give the American people ``a better understanding of our
life, our perestroika ... and our sincere desire to improve
Soviet-American relations.''
   The exchange, arranged by the Soviet Ministry of Culture and
InterCultura, a private, non-profit organization based in Fort
Worth, Texas, will involve tours of four exhibitions of Soviet art
in the United States and four American shows traveling through the
Soviet Union.
   A ninth exhibition, organized jointly by U.S., Soviet and
Canadian institutions, will feature artworks of the Tlingit people,
North American Indians of Alaska and British Columbia and will tour
all three countries in 1994.
   The Soviet exhibitions headed for the United States include:
   _Masterpieces of 19th century Russian paintings from an artistic
group of social activists known as the Wanderers, to premiere at
the Dallas Museum of Art in the summer of 1990 and travel to an
undetermined second American museum.
   _Important avant-garde Russian works from the early 20th
century, many of them never seen in the United States, and examples
of traditional Russian art that inspired those modern artists. The
show will debut at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth in 1991 and
travel to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art the following year.
   _The first major U.S. display of treasures of medieval Russian
ecclesiastical art from the 14th to the 17th centuries, involving
90 to 100 objects from the State Russian Museum in Leningrad. The
exhibition will be seen at the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore in
1991, the Dallas Museum of Art in 1992 and a third undetermined
museum the same year.
   _Masterpieces of 19th century Russian photography, to be shown
in two or three U.S. museums _ yet undecided _ in 1993.
   American art shows traveling to the Soviet Union include:
   _A collection of 195 historic American photographs taken between
1839 and 1904, including images of the Civil War, exploration of
the American West and the native Indian nations. Tentatively
scheduled to open in Moscow in 1991.
   _Sculptures from the Nasher Collection, regarded as the most
important private holding of 20th century sculpture in the world,
to open in Moscow in the summer of 1991.
   _A survey of American modern art from 1950 to 1980, including
paintings by Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and Willem de Kooning.
Tentatively scheduled to open at the Artists Union Hall in Moscow
in 1992 and travel to the Russian Museum in Leningrad the same year.
   _Treasures of pre-Columbian art from North and South America,
including more than 200 sculptures, ceramics and other ancient
objects dating to 2000 B.C. To open at the Russian Museuim in
Leningrad in 1993.
   Gordon Dee Smith, president of InterCultura, and Genrikh P.
Popov, chief of the Soviet Ministry of Culture's fine arts
department, said the exchange will be unsurpassed in scope, size
and duration in the history of Soviet-American cultural cooperation.
   They said that when exchange plans are completed, the
itineraries for the exhibitions are expected to stress appearances
at museums outside such major cities as New York, Washington,
Moscow and Leningrad.
   Smith said there were no current plans for any of the Soviet
shows to appear at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York or
the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
   The first project under the joint agreement, resulting from
negotiations that began in 1987, is ``10 + 10: Contemporary Soviet
and American Painters,'' an exhibition of recent works by 10 Soviet
and 10 American artists. That show, which opened in Fort Worth last
May, will travel to the Soviet Union next year after a U.S. tour.

   President Bush signed legislation Friday that will
require all states to use competitive bidding to buy food and
formula for poor women, children and infants.
   Bush, in a statement released here by the traveling White House,
said the 28 states that already use competitive bidding in the
Womens, Infants and Children (WIC) program have saved $300 million
this year alone and been able to serve 500,000 more people.
   Bush signed the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act on
Air Force One while flying here to speak at a Realtors' convention.
   The measure ``will save an additional $40 million and allow
68,000 more needy pregnant women, infants and children to
participate in WIC,'' Bush said in a statement.
   Bush said he is ``firmly committed to helping nutritionally
deficient children obtain improved nourishment that will give them
a better start in life.''
   He repeated the lament from his inaugural address that ``we have
more will than wallet,'' and added:
   ``This is the kind of action we must pursue _ obtaining better
value for each dollar of federal spending _ if we are to make
progress on pressing national concerns.''
   The White House also announced that Bush had signed an $8.6
billion military construction appropriations bill for the
Department of Defense for fiscal 1990.

   A Maryland company said Friday it will begin
field trials of a plant vaccine, which could inoculate corn plants
against an insect that costs U.S. farmers $500 million a year.
   In greenhouse tests, corn borer damage was reduced by 80 percent
in plants inoculated with the naturally occuring microorganism,
according to a statement released by Crop Genetics International of
Hanover, Md.
   ``This is the first time that a plant has been able to grow its
own genetically-engineered pesticide in its vascular system,'' the
company said.
   The borer is a pest on 20 million acres of the U.S. corn crop,
the company said. U.S. farmers annually lose 200 million bushels of
corn worth $500 million to the borer.
   ``If it proves to be effective, if it can be easily used and it
is not too costly it will do Minnesota farmers a lot of good,''
said Ken Ostlie, a University of Minnesota entomologist.
   Minnesota lost an average of $107 million worth of corn to the
borer from 1981 to 1983, years in which borer infestation was
particularly bad, Ostlie said.
   The microorganism, whose scientific name is Bacillus
thuringiensis, is harmless to humans and animals, making it
preferable to chemical pesticides, according to the company, which
specializes in developing biological pesticides.
   ``Our InCide vaccine is environmentally more attractive than
synthetic chemical pesticides,'' said company chairman John B.
Henry.
   A prototype of the vaccine was field tested in several states. A
newer, more potent version was effective in greenhouse tests and is
scheduled for field trials in Maryland next summer, the company
said.
   The bacteria already is being used as a pesticide by being
applied on corn in granular form, Ostlie said.
   Researchers are concerned about whether the borers would become
resistant to the toxin if it goes into widespread use.

<TEXT>
   For 45 years, the fate of U.S. Army Sgt. Lloyd
Willard Wibben was a mystery to both his family and the residents
of Treguier, a coastal village in northwestern France.
   The family knew Wibben had died somewhere in France during World
War II.
   The villagers knew an American soldier fell while liberating
their town, but they never knew his name.
   A historian's persistence finally led to the name, jotted in the
yellowed pages of a diary kept by the commander of Wibben's
regiment.
   This week, Mervin Wibben of St. Charles, Ill., arrived in
Treguier, population 3,400, at the invitation of city elders to
join them in honoring his older brother.
   On Saturday, Armistice Day in France, Wibben will lay a wreath
at a new monument the villagers are dedicating to the man who was
once their unknown soldier.
   Lloyd Wibben was 24 years old on Aug. 14, 1944, when his 15th
Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron advanced just to the edge of
Treguier, a village 250 miles west of Paris.
   They found the road blocked by debris, so Wibben and other
soldiers left their vehicles to clear the road. Wibben was killed
in a barrage of German fire.
   The villagers placed a simple granite marker where he died,
dedicated ``to the unknown American soldier who died during the
Liberation 14 August 1944.'' He was buried in Plot K, Row 7, at the
American military cemetery at St. James in Normandy, along with
about 4,400 other U.S. soldiers who died in the fighting.
   The Americans took the village and eventually stopped the Nazis'
counterattack on Avranches.
   ``All we really knew was that that we got telegram from the Army
that Lloyd was killed in France,'' Wibben said Wednesday by
telephone from Treguier.
   ``We didn't know too much more of it until Treguier contacted us
to help in this ceremony,'' he said. ``He really is some kind of
hero to the people here.''
   The people of Treguier did not know the soldier's name until
local historian Yvon Herve launched a research project about two
years ago.
   His search eventually led him to retired Col. Robert Dwan, who
commanded the 15th Cavalry Regiment and kept a diary listing all
the men under his command who had died.
   Dwan showed Herve the entry for Aug. 14, 1944, and further
investigation confirmed that Wibben was Treguier's unknown soldier.
   ``Very few people in the war kept a diary like that,'' said
Mervin Wibben, a semi-retired meat processor who served with the
U.S. Army in the Pacific. ``Most of them just wanted to forget
about everything.''
   Herve considered the puzzle fully solved in mid-September, and
Treguier officials started planning a ceremony to place a bronze
plaque with Wibben's name over the old granite marker.
   ``Because we have learned his identity, we wanted to invite his
brother,'' said Herve. ``For us, this ceremony is a symbol of our
freedom.''
   Mervin Wibben and his wife, Jan, flew to Paris courtesy of Air
France on Wednesday before traveling on to Treguier. They visited
Wibben's grave and will tour the area around the World War II
battlefields before leaving for home Sunday.
   ``It really broke me up bad when Lloyd died,'' Mervin Wibben
said. ``He was five years older than me, but we were really close.
He left me his car when he volunteered for the service.''
   The family, natives of Yankton, S.D., included seven brothers
and four sisters. Mervin is the first to visit Lloyd's grave.
   ``When they called, it brought back a lot of memories _ and a
few tears,'' he said. ``Lloyd was a prince. He wanted to go fight
for his country. He loved horses so much he signed up for the
cavalry ... but when he got to Europe it was all mechanized.''
   Saturday's ceremony comes nine days before Lloyd Wibben would
have celebrated his 70th birthday.

   Maoist guerrillas trying to disrupt local
elections this weekend blew up power lines and attacked troops and
civilians, and 17 people were killed, police said Friday.
   Among those killed in the attacks late Thursday and Friday were
seven local officeholders and candidates. That raised to more than
135 the number of officials and candidates assassinated by the
Shining Path rebels this year.
   The government says more than 15,000 people have been killed in
political violence since the Shining Path launched their insurgency
in 1980, and the increasing tempo of attacks have been denounced by
all political parties. Thousands marched in Lima Nov. 3 for peace.
   Police said rebels fatally shot an election board official, a
town council officer and three council candidates Friday in Palca,
155 miles southeast of Lima. They killed a policeman and his wife
Friday morning in Tarma, 95 miles east of Lima, police said.
   Authorities said guerrillas shot to death a town council
candidate and a provincial official before dawn Friday in Huanta,
near the Andean city of Ayacucho.
   On Thursday night, Shining Path rebels broke into the house of
the former local election board president Thursday night in
Ayacucho, fatally shot his wife and sister and set fire to the
house, police said. The official, Juan Guzman, was not at home when
the attack occurred.
   Police said rebels also shot and killed the wife of the director
of a government development agency in Ayacucho Thursday night after
not finding the man at home. The guerrillas also set fire to the
house.
   Rebels on Thursday also killed a teacher in the city 235 miles
of southeast of Lima.
   Ayacucho and several mountain departments, or states, have been
under a 10 p.m. curfew since Sept. 18. The government on Friday
extended a curfew in four states where more than 2 million people
live.
   On Friday, rebels distributed pamphlets in Ayacucho urging
people to boycott Sunday's municipal elections, saying, ``Down with
the electoral farce.''
   The pamphlets also announced a three-day ``armed strike''
beginning Saturday in the department of Ayacucho. The rebels had
previously announced similar strikes for the departments of Junin,
Pasco and Huanuco, important agricultural and mining regions in the
central highlands.
   The term is used by the Shining Path to call a general strike,
and implies violence against anyone who doesn't comply.
   The rebels have been waging a campaign of terror and sabotage to
disrupt the nationwide municipal elections.
   Elsewhere, guerrillas blew up high-tension power lines in a
series of attacks Thursday night and Friday against the main power
grid in the highlands near Huancayo, 140 miles east of Lima. Much
of the central highlands were blacked out, as well as some coastal
cities, including parts of the capital.

   Here is a list of current leaders of Eastern European Communist
nations and the length of their tenure as key leaders:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SOVIET UNION _ Mikhail S. Gorbachev became Communist Party chief
March 11, 1985. Gorbachev came to power after a transitional period
following the 1982 death of Leonid I. Brezhnev, who ruled for 18
years.
   BULGARIA _ Communist Party leader Todor Zhivkov stepped down
Friday after 35 years in power, longer than any current Eastern
European leader. He was replaced by Foreign Minister Petar Mladenov.
   CZECHOSLOVAKIA _ Milos Jakes was named head of the Czechoslovak
Communist Party on Dec. 17, 1987, replacing Gustav Husak.
   EAST GERMANY _ Egon Krenz became East Germany's leader Oct. 18,
replacing his mentor, Erich Honecker, an orthodox Communist who was
ousted in the face of escalating protests for reform and mass
flight to the West.
   HUNGARY _ On Oct. 7, the Communists dissolved the party,
reconstituted themselves as the Hungarian Socialist Party and
elected reformer Reszoe Nyers as party chief. Nyers replaced Karoly
Grosz, a centrist who had been party chief since longtime leader
Janos Kadar was ousted in May 1988 by party reformers. Kadar came
into power in 1956, during the bloodshed of the Soviet-supressed
1956 revolt.
   POLAND _ Newly elected Solidarity government headed by Tadeusz
Mazowiecki took over Aug. 24. Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who became
Communist Party chief in October 1981 and declared martial law two
months later, is president under the new system.
   ROMANIA _ Nicolae Ceausescu has been in power since 1965.
   YUGOSLAVIA _ Under a system of rotating the presidency among
members of the nine-man presidency, the federal president serves 12
months. The nine-member collective presidency includes
representatives from all six of Yugoslavia's republics, its two
autonomous provinces and the country's Communist Party chief. The
system was devised by former leader Josip Broz Tito who ruled from
1945 until his death in 1980.
   ALBANIA _ Ramiz Alia assumed power in 1985 upon the death of
Enver Hoxna, who ruled for 41 years.

   East Germany's upheaval will rattle all Europe,
impelling the two Germanys toward political and economic
association and throwing into question the NATO and Warsaw Pact
alliances, American experts said Friday.
   ``It is probably the most important strategic change since the
war,'' said Gregory Treverton, senior fellow for Europe at the
Council on Foreign Relations.
   ``The center of Europe, the Germanys, still are the most
strategic landscape in the world. This change there is the most
important thing to happen in Europe certainly for the last 30
years,'' Treverton said in an interview.
   While reforms in Poland and Hungary initiated the process,
Treverton said, East Germany was ``the place where we've always
presumed change would come last. Now we find it coming very soon,
and very quickly.''
   The lifting of travel restrictions and promised political reform
there ``means the successful self-liberation of the German
Democratic Republic, which in itself is a momentous event,'' Prof.
Fritz Stern of Columbia University said, also in a telephone
interview.
   Moreover, in its aftershocks, ``it is likely to change the
politics of Europe, and the political climate of Europe,'' said
Stern, a historian specializing in Europe. ``It's an astounding
historical development.''
   East Germany said Friday it was permanently lifting travel
restrictions on its citizens, and tens of thousands of East Germans
streamed into West Berlin through the newly opened Berlin Wall.
Many, however, are expected to return.
   The events were sparked by pro-reform demonstrations across East
Germany _ and the flight to freedom of thousands of East Germans _
that forced the Oct. 18 ouster of hard-line leader Erich Honecker.
His successor, Egon Krenz, swept aside the old guard in the ruling
Politburo and has promised political reform, including free
elections.
   Allied conquerors sliced Germany into the democratic West and
communist East after World War II, and forces of the Warsaw Pact,
on the East, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, on the
West, have faced each other across the two Germanys every since.
   Now, Treverton said, the question for the short term is whether
East Germany will produce economic and political reforms sufficient
``to build for itself some legitimacy.'' The conundrum is that if
it fails it loses all legitimacy, he said, but if it succeeds,
``then it's difficult to see what basis there is for a separate
state.''
   ``Then the question is whether some sort of reassociation in
stages can happen and how than would be regarded by the rest of
Europe,'' Treverton said. ``It's no so much reunification as what
form association of the states takes, and over what time period.''
   Stern held a largely similar view: ``It sounds to me as though
the East German government is trying desperately to find some
stability, and that it might be able to satisfy its citizens with
the promises made and the deeds committed, and then enter into
negotiations with the Federal Republic (West Germany) for vast
economic aid.
   ``And then you would have two German states, in the short run,
in very close association. That's not yet reunification, and I
could imagine that it wouldn't become reunification for many
years.''
   The response of other European states is critical, Treverton
noted, because of their fear that a reunited Germany would
contribute to the kind of political instability that preceded the
world war.
   ``Most of the rest of Western Europe is exhilarated and nervous
in about equal proportions,'' he said. ``Nobody knows whether the
nature of the European state system has changed enough that a
Germany that was always destabilizing before may not be so this
time around.''
   With that concern, Treverton said, ``NATO and probably the
Warsaw Pact ought to stay in place a long time as a kind of
residual insurance policy.''
   John Vessey Jr., former chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of
Staff, also said there was reason for caution amid the jubilation.
   ``East Germany is not appearing to be in control of its own
destiny,'' Vessey said from his home in Garrison, Minn. ``I would
hope there isn't a crackdown.''
   Stern, however, wondered if the East Bloc alliance had not
already largely crumbled. ``What is left of the Warsaw Pact?'' he
asked. ``Would the Soviets really be able to count on the Poles and
the Hungarians, even if they could count on the East Germans, or
maintain their troops there?''
   One possible outcome, he suggested, was ``a breathing period''
in which the Americans, Soviets, British and French, along with the
two Germanys, might reach agreements reducing their troops there.
   On the economic front, Treverton suggested that the European
Economic Community promptly open negotiations with East Germany and
the other changing Eastern European states in order to cement its
position as the economic framework for the new Europe.
   Stern, for his part, said the impact of the upheavals on
Europe's economy, particularly on Western Europe's economic merger
in 1992, remain to be seen.
   ``Nobody could have predicted what has occurred so far,'' he
said. ``So it's foolhardy to make any predictions.''

<HEAD>Divided Parties Propose Their Solutions to Political Deadlock</HEAD>
<HEAD>By NIKOS KONSTANDARAS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former socialist Premier Andreas
Papandreou received a presidential mandate Friday to try to form a
government, but all three major parties were offering conflicting
solutions to end the political deadlock.
   Conservative leader Constantine Mitsotakis earlier Friday
returned his mandate to President Christos Sartzetakis and proposed
a short-term administration to tackle pressing economic problems.
   Underscoring the crisis, the central bank Friday ordered
commercial banks to limit credit extended to the private sector
because of a cash shortfall.
   ``There is a need for a government with international prestige .
.. made up of personalities which will be supported by all
parties,'' Mitsotakis told a news conference.
   He said the government members should not be politicians and
elections should be held early next year.
   The deadlock arose after Mitsotakis' New Democracy Party won the
most votes in last Sunday's elections but missed a majority in the
300-seat Parliament.
   New Democracy won 148 seats in the elections, Papandreou's
Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK, took 128, and the
Communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress won 21. Three
seats went to independents.
   Papandreou, who governed from 1981 until June, proposed a
long-term alliance between PASOK, the leftist Coalition, and two
independents.
   He said now was not the time to consider Mitsotakis' proposal
for a government supported by all parties, but did not rule out
such an eventuality.
   The leftist Coalition supports the idea of a broad-based
government of personalities, but its conditions for backing it
include a freeze on negotiations on the future of U.S. military
bases in Greece.
   If Papandreou fails to form a government by Monday, he will
return the mandate to the president and it will be given to
Coalition leader Harilaos Florakis.
   The last government, administered by a conservative-Communist
alliance, dedicated itself only to investigating and indicting
Papandreou and five of his former ministers on corruption charges.
   Papandreou, who has denied all charges, is to be tried by a
special high court early next year.

   Anti-nuclear activists on Friday protested a Leeds
University decision to award former U.S. Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger an honorary degree.
   Bruce Kent, the chairman of the Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament, called on the university in northern England to
reverse its decision. In a letter to Alan Wilson, acting head of
the university, Kent said Weinberger ``has a record as a promoter
of the arms race and of the Cold War which must have few equals.''
   The university's Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament coordinator,
Eddie Goncalves, said he delivered 2,000 letters and postcards to
the administration calling for a reversal of the decision to honor
Weinberger, defense secretary from 1981 to 1987.
   Weinberger, 72, who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in February
1988, is scheduled to receive his honorary degree Monday night.

   An express train rammed into an
idled passenger train Friday, killing five people and injuring 52,
the official CTK news agency reported.
   The northbound Baltorient Express was en route from Prague to
East Germany when the two trains crashed near Nove Kopisty, about
45 miles north of Prague, CTK said. The impact destroyed four rail
cars and derailed six cars of the express train, CTK said.
   One of the five dead was an East German, the news agency said.
It did not give the nationalieties of any of the other dead or
injured.
   Thirty people were hospitalized with injuries and 22 others were
treated and released, CTK said.
   The news agency did not say how many people were aboard the two
trains.
   CTK said soldiers were helping railway workers clear the
wreckage. Traffic was rerouted throughout the day, it said.

<TEXT>
   L. Douglas Wilder, confident that his claim
of victory in Virginia's gubernatorial race will stand, went on
vacation Friday while his opponent sought an explanation for why
some campaign mail wasn't delivered.
   Wilder, with about a 6,500-vote lead over Republican J. Marshall
Coleman in unofficial returns from Tuesday's balloting, is taking a
few days off before planning his administration, said B.J.
Northington, the Democrat's deputy press secretary.
   Coleman aides, meantime, claimed that 20,000 pieces of campaign
mail destined for the 10th congressional District in northern
Virginia were not delivered.
   ``We're expecting a thorough investigation of postal employees
will take place, and we will be interested in the results,'' said
Jay Timmons, a spokesman for Coleman.
   The missing mail cleared the area's Post Office, was given to
satellite post offices on Saturday and was put into the hands of
carriers on Monday, Timmons said.
   ``We're not sure if they had them for lunch or someone is not
telling the truth,'' he said.
   Another 2,200 pieces of Coleman mail destined for the Petersburg
area was mistakenly placed in a truck full of empty equipment by
someone who thought the mail sacks were empty, said Deborah
Yackley, communications manager for the Richmond division of the
U.S. Postal Service.
   The Petersburg literature, which Timmons said was mailed Oct. 6,
was found Wednesday, the day after the election. Ms. Yackley said
the Post Office expressed regrets to the state Republican Party.
   Coleman has promised to seek a recount if the election's final
results as certified Nov. 27 by the State Board of Elections show
him losing by a half percent or less.

   The foreign minister of West Germany thanked
the United States for its help over the years in a telephone call
Friday that Secretary of State James A. Baker said ``almost brings
tears to your eyes.''
   Describing the call on ``The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour'' on public
television, Baker said when he took the phone he was greeted by the
secretary to the foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   ``She said, `Just a moment sir, and thank you for everything.
God bless America. Here's the minister.'''
   And Genscher came on the line and said: ```I'm calling to
express to you, and through you to the American people, our
gratitude for what America has done for Germany, and particularly
for what America has done for Berlin.' Now I find that very moving.
It almost brings tears to your eyes,'' Baker said.
   The United States, Britain and France, the western allies that
defeated Nazi Germany in World War II, sustained West Berlin by
flying in food and fuel when the Soviet Union blocked all land,
rail and water transport to the city in the winter of 1948-1949.
   When the Soviet Union threatened action against West Berlin
after the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, President John F.
Kennedy stood at the wall and proclaimed: ``Ich bin ein Berliner''
_ I am a Berliner.

   Parts of Washington state were flooded Friday from rain and
melting snow, and winds kicked up to 100 mph in the Rockies.
   Flood warnings remained in effect along the Nooksack River and
three other rivers in northwestern Washington, with the National
Weather Service predicting warm weather and occasionally heavy rain
in the Cascade Mountains.
   The worst problems were in Whatcom County, where the loss of a
bridge over the Nooksack cut off access to about 10,000 to 11,000
people, although some could be reached overland through Canada,
said Gary Myers of the county's Department of Emergency Services.
   Two days of warm rain melted snow on 10,775-foot Mount Baker,
filling the river's three forks.
   Low pressure moving across southern Canada also brought strong
and gusty winds to the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in
Montana and Wyoming, where high wind warnings were in effect.
   Winds gusted above 100 mph at Choteau, Mont., early Friday, up
to 72 mph at Cutbank and 61 mph at Cody, Wyo.
   Mild temperatures prevailed in the Pacific Northwest. A morning
reading of 64 degrees in Portland, Ore., surpassed a previous
record for the date of 62 degrees set in 1977.
   Elsewhere around the country, rain showers were scattered across
the upper Ohio Valley and the middle Atlantic Coast states, and a
few showers were over northern Michigan and southern Florida.
   Clouds were over much of the northern half of the country. Sunny
skies prevailed across the southern tier. Dense fog was reported
along the coasts of Texas, Louisiana and California.
   Temperatures dipped below freezing overnight across much of the
area from the Dakotas through Minnesota and Iowa to Michigan.
Readings also dropped below freezing in the Plateau region and the
Rocky Mountains.
   The nation's low was 11 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.

   Hollywood actress Kelly McGillis will break a
one-year commitment and leave the Folger Shakespeare Theater on
Nov. 19 because she is pregnant and under doctors' orders not to
work, the theater said Friday.
   The theater's artistic director, Michael Kahn, accepted Miss
McGillis' departure ``with deep regret'' but best wishes. Miss
McGillis, who married yacht broker Fred Tillman last year, is
expecting a baby in June.
   The actress will leave after the closing performance of
Shakespeare's ``Twelfth Night,'' in which she received rave reviews
for her portrayal of Viola. Her season-long contract had also
called for to appear in Schiller's ``Mary Stuart'' in February and
Shakespeare's ``The Merry Wives of Windsor'' in April.

<TEXT>
   An art gallery director fighting to keep a
$10,000 federal grant in a test of a new anti-obscenity law said
Friday she fears a return to the blacklists of the 1950s.
   ``And I do not think blacklists are a good thing to have in this
country,'' said Susan Wyatt, executive director of Artists Space in
downtown Manhattan.
   ``Last June, Artists Space sponsored an exhibition of Eastern
European art. From that show, we learned a great deal about the
aesthetic poverty of official vs. unofficial art,'' Wyatt said at a
news conference. ``I sincerely hope that this country is not moving
in that direction.''
   In a Nov. 3 letter, National Endowment for the Arts Chairman
John E. Frohnmayer revoked the grant for the gallery's upcoming
AIDS art exhibition. He said later the exhibition catalog indicated
the show was political rather than artistic in nature.
   Artist Space's board on Wednesday unanimously rejected the
request to relinquish its claim to the grant. The board's decision
``is our way of defending the American public's right to form their
own opinions on artistic expression,'' Wyatt said.
   The endowment is withholding the $10,000 pending a legal opinion
from the Justice Department.
   Wyatt said she had not yet obtained a lawyer and would not
speculate on what actions might be taken.
   ``We're kind of in a crisis situation,'' she said.
   The show will open Nov. 16, ``exactly as we had planned,'' she
said.
   It features works by 23 painters, sculptors and photographers
that portray the effects of AIDS on the artistic community. An
apparent sticking point was a catalog essay by David Wojnarowicz, a
photographer who has AIDS, which assails Cardinal John J. O'Connor,
Rep. William E. Dannemeyer, R-Calif., and Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   ``It would be extremely naive to publish a catalog with strong
language and references to public figures and not expect some kind
of comment or controversy,'' said Wyatt.
   Still, she said, ``We didn't decide to do a catalog that was
politically charged; we are publishing a catalog with artistic
texts and writing.''
   Wyatt said that although the show includes some images of male
and female nudity, ``This is not a show about politics; this is not
a show about sexuality; this is a show about AIDS.''

   President Bush promised Friday to ``recapture the
American dream of home ownership'' for all Americans and provide
shelter for the poor and homeless with a three-year, $4.2 billion
spending package.
   ``The true measure of success isn't how many families we add to
housing assistance rolls. It's how many families move up and out _
and into the ranks of homeowners,'' Bush said without specifying
where he would find the money.
   The secretary of housing and urban development, Jack Kemp, told
reporters he hoped the money would come from a cut in the capital
gains tax, a proposal that has encountered vigorous opposition on
Capitol Hill.
   Kemp said the spending would be new money and that it was not
his understanding it would come from other housing programs.
   Bush, speaking to the National Association of Realtors, outlined
$4.2 billion in federal spending for three years starting in fiscal
1991, which begins Oct. 1, 1990.
   In addition to the $4.2 billion in actual spending, Kemp said,
the package will cost the government ``several billion'' dollars in
revenue lost due to tax incentives, including low-income housing
tax credits and penalty-free IRA withdrawals for home down payments.
   The program, unlike congressional housing proposals, does not
provide any money for new construction of low-income housing.
   The financing levels in the Bush proposal are well below
legislation making its way through both the House and Senate, but
well above anything proposed in the Reagan administration.
   Bush proposed $2.15 billion in grants to help low-income
families buy units in public housing buildings, or vacant or
foreclosed properties under the program _ Home Ownership and
Opportunity for People Everywhere, or HOPE.
   However, Kemp said the grant money would not go directly to home
buyers. Most would go to local groups that rehabilitate or buy such
properties and make the housing available at below-market prices.
   About one-third of the grant money money would be used by such
groups to help poor people with mortgages, said Kemp's assistant,
Mary Brunette.
   ``The real centerpiece of our HOPE initiative,'' Bush said, is
``to recapture the American dream for home ownership for those who
have been left behind, through resident management and resident
ownership.''
   In Washington, Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the
House Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, said in a
statement: ``I welcome the spotlight that President Bush has shone
on housing'' but he argued the president's plan ``merely arranges
the deck chairs on the Titanic. ... The $4.2 billion could be
better spent building new units.''
   Bush's plan:
   _Provides $728 million for the homeless _ to be equally matched
by states, local government or private groups _ for housing and
support services such as social and mental health programs. That
would be above the more than $200 million already envisioned in HUD
spending under the McKinney Act to serve the homeless through a
variety of federal programs.
   _Allows first-time homebuyers to use their Individual Retirement
Accounts for down payments without paying a penalty for withdrawal.
However, they would have to pay taxes on the money, Kemp said.
   _Asks Congress to create 50 inner-city Enterprise Zones over
four years where investors would be given tax incentives for
undertaking development.
   _Includes $1.075 billion for tenants to convert and rehabilitate
federally subsidized housing into resident-owned cooperatives.
Tenant groups would have the first right to buy buildings whose
owners leave the low-income housing programs. About 334,000 units
would be affected by that provision in the next 15 years.
   _Provides $210 million for insurance and rental rehabilitation
grants in 50 ``housing opportunity zones.'' These areas would be
selected on the basis of which localities best removed zoning and
other bureaucratic barriers to providing affordable housing.
   _Provides $44 million for a demonstration project to set up
``service-supported housing for the frail elderly'' that would
given them both housing vouchers and assistance to pay for services
they need to live independently.
   _Requires public housing authorities and local governments to
help welfare and other low-income families with job training, child
care, transportation and other assistance.
   ``This is the first time a Republican president has acknowledged
that the war on poverty is not only an essential inner city
strategy ... that there are pockets of poor left out of the
recovery,'' Kemp said.
   In a new bid to revive his flagging proposal to cut the capital
gains tax, Bush said he would tie that proposal to renewal of a
low-income tax credit due to expire at the end of the year.
   Proponents of a reduction in taxes on capital gains contend
businesses would invest the extra money in projects that ultimately
would increase government revenues. Opponents, however, say the
government would not recoup the lost revenue.
   The low-income tax credit was enacted in the 1986 Tax Reform Act
to encourage the development of low-income rental housing in
exhange for highly favorable tax treatment. Bush proposed renewing
the credit ``as part of a package of reforms that includes a cut in
the capital gains tax.''
   However, Kemp indicated Bush would not hold the low-income tax
credit renewal hostage to passage of the capital gains reduction.
   The capital gains issue was among the most contentious between
the White House and Congress this year. The administration agreed
last week not to continue blocking other legislation by trying to
attach a capital gains provision to it, at least for the rest of
this year.
   Bush said Kemp would name a commission to find ways to remove
bureaucratic barriers to construction and rehabilitation of
affordable housing in inner cities.
   ``No city, state or town should receive a single penny of HOPE
funding until they have identified barriers to affordable housing
in their own back yard, and started taking steps to remove them,''
Bush said.

<HEAD>Military Gov't Gives Visas to 1st Foreign Reporters Since Crackdown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military government has granted the
first visas to foreign reporters since it arrested opposition
leaders in July and began rounding up thousands of activists
supporting democratic reform.
   ``Foreign journalists' visas are being considered on a
case-by-case basis,'' Col. Ye Htut, a government for the ruling
junta, told a news conference Friday.
   ``Genuine journalists, who will report the truth objectively
without bias, will be permitted when their credibility is vouched
and guaranteed by a responsible person or organization,'' he said.
   A Cable News Network television crew visited Burma this month,
ending a ban on foreign reporters that coincided with the military
junta's crackdown on the opposition.
   Burma has been a one-party state since Ne Win toppled the
elected government in a military coup in 1962 and instituted a
rigid socialist system that impoverished what had been considered
one of Asia's most prosperous states.
   Ne Win resigned in July 1988 after hundreds of thousands of
Burmese took to the streets to demand democracy, but armed forces
chief Gen. Saw Maung seized power two months later and troops
killed thousands of people in a crackdown on dissent.
   In January, Burma officially granted visits by foreign
journalists for the first time in 26 years.
   But the journalists were banned in July, when authorities
rounded up thousands of political activists and put opposition
leaders Aung San Suu Kyi and Gen. Tin Oo under house arrest.
   The United States said it has ``credible'' reports that many of
those imprisoned have been tortured, some until death.
   The state press recently has stepped up attacks on foreign
journalists, accusing them of bias and of assisting allegedly
subversive groups.

   Philippines President Corazon Aquino ended her
visit here Friday with pledges of U.S. economic support but no
outward sign that she will back continued American use of military
bases in her country.
   Before departing, Mrs. Aquino breakfasted with Vice President
Dan Quayle and U.S.-backed Nicaraguan opposition candidate Violeta
Chamorro.
   The two women _ both the wives of slain national leaders _
discussed their common experiences in entering politics, said
Quayle aide Carnes Lord. Asked if Mrs. Chamorro hoped to cash in on
some of Mrs. Aquino's popularity, Lord said, ``That was the idea,
obviously.''
   Mrs. Aquino, accompanied by members of her Cabinet and aides,
later left for Dallas, where she planned to resume what she has
described as the main purpose of her mission to the United States _
encouraging trade and investment needed for the Philippines'
economic recovery.
   Before departing, she agreed during a 30-minute talk with
Defense Secretary Richard Cheney to start exploratory talks in
Manila in mid-December on the future of the Philippine bases,
Philippines Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus said.
   Manglapus, who attended the Aquino-Cheney meeting at a downtown
hotel, told reporters, ``It all depends on the results of the
exploratory talks'' whether the December meetings lead to
negotiations on a new bases agreement after the existing pact
expires in 1991.
   ``If both sides see after the talks that negotiations are
worthwhile towards a new treaty, then those negotiations will begin
soon afterward,'' Manglapus said during a National Press Club
appearance.
   Manglapus, who will lead the Manila talks, said there must first
be exploratory meetings to determine if ``negotiations are
worthwhile towards a new treaty'' _ opening the possibility that
the basing arrangement might not be renewed.
   President Bush and administration officials, however, have
voiced optimism that the process will lead to a new agreement.
   Manglapus said the exploratory talks should deal with use of the
bases, jurisdiction over criminal cases and compensation.
   He mentioned no payment amount. In talks a year ago, Manglapus
had demanded $1.2 billion worth of aid during each of the last two
years of the current agreement. Negotiators finally settled on $480
million annually.
   Various opinion polls show that the Philippine public supports
keeping the U.S. military presence. Aquino's reluctance to take a
stand is regarded by some Bush administration officials and members
of Congress as both a negotiating tactic and recognition of strong
opposition to the bases in the Philippine Senate.
   In his welcoming remarks Thursday, Bush said: ``You deserve our
help and you will get it. I pledge our continuing assistance to
your government, and that means security assistance as well as aid
to economic development. And it means cooperating in your important
debt-reduction programs.''

   Attorneys for James Hudson Savage got a

his last name might negatively influence the jury at his murder
trial.
   Defense attorneys had argued that Savage's last name might cause
a jury to think of him as an ``uncivilized primitive.''
   Instead, the defense will call the 25-year-old man Russell
Thomas Moore, the name given to Savage by his mother.
   Prosecutors, meanwhile, must refer to the defendant as Mr.
Savage, Brevard Circuit Judge Lawrence Johnston ruled Thursday.
   ``We are not going to mock his name,'' Assistant State Attorney

   Savage will stand trial Monday on charges of first-degree
murder, sexual battery and robbery in the November 1988
strangulation of Melbourne interior designer Barbara Ann Barber.

   A Dallas police officer riding in Philippine
President Corazon Aquino's motorcade was injured Friday when a
driver ran into his motorcycle, police said.
   The officer, whose identity was not released, was taken to
Baylor Medical Center for treatment, according to Michael McMurray,
a communications officer for the Dallas Police Department.
   ``We don't believe it was serious,'' McMurray said. ``We think
he's in good shape.''
   An initial report that the accident occurred during a motorcade
for President Bush, who was also visiting the city, was false,
McMurray said.
   The 6:13 p.m. accident did not delay the motorcade, which was
taking Mrs. Aquino to a hotel for a private dinner. Her Dallas stop
was the last of a seven-city tour the president is making to to
promote foreign investment in the Philippines.
   A woman driving a BMW apparently did not see the intersection
was blocked off and hit the motorcycle, said Cpl. J.W. Lawton, who
investigated the accident.
   The driver was cited for a routine violation and no alcohol was
involved, he said.

   Two Pakistani drug traffickers were
beheaded Friday for smuggling heroin into the kingdom, the Interior
Ministry announced.
   A ministry statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency
identified the men as Lal Mohammed Abdul-Hamid and Sahebzad
Ahmeduddin Abdul-Rashid and said they were executed in the eastern
city of Dammam.
   It said the men had been condemned to death by an Islamic court
but gave no other details.
   Beheading is a punishment for murderers under the Islamic
Sharia, or religious laws, in effect in the kingdom. Thieves have
their hands chopped off and adulterers are stoned to death.
   But in recent years, Islamic theologians have prescribed
beheading also for those convicted of spreading ``corruption on the
face of the earth,'' and drug smuggling falls under that category.
   Executions usually take place in public squares outside mosques
Friday, the Moslem holy day, as the faithful come out of noon
prayers.

   Industrialist Armand Hammer underwent surgery
Friday to have a pacemaker implanted in his heart and was reported
in good condition afterward at UCLA Medical Center.
   A statement from his company, Occidental Petroleum Corp., did
not elaborate. But Hammer, 91, has a history of painful heart
flutters and had been reported to be making monthly visits to his
cardiologist, Dr. Jan Tillisch.
   The surgery, performed Friday afternoon by pacemaker specialist
Dr. Peter Guzy, was voluntary, Occidental spokesman Frank Ashley
said late Friday afternoon.
   ``He is alert and talking,'' Ashley said.
   Doctors expect him to be released from the hospital in a few
days and return to normal activity, Ashley and UCLA spokesman Mike
Byrne said.
   A pacemaker regulates electrical activity in the heart so that
it beats normally in a person who suffers abnormal heart rhythms.
   Hammer, the chairman of Occidental, is nearly as well-known for
his art collecting and philanthropy as for his business acumen. He
considers himself a private ambassador for world peace and has met
every Soviet leader since Vladimir Lenin.
   After word of Hammer's hospitalization leaked, trading in
Occidental stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange. The
price of Occidental shares has surged in the past when Hammer has
been reported to be in ill health.
   Analysts say the reason is that without the longtime chairman's
presence, the company would become a likely takeover target.
   Hammer was pardoned earlier this year by President Bush for a
Watergate-era crime, making illegal contributions to President
Nixon's re-election campaign in 1972.
   Hammer had pleaded guilty to the charges in 1976, was placed on
probation for one year and fined $3,000. He had campaigned for a
pardon ever since.

   East Germany's Communist Party on Friday promised
free elections, freedom of association and assembly, closer
supervision of its security forces and an end to official
privileges.
   In other moves to boost its sagging authority, the party's
Central Committee also sacked four officials from the ruling
Politburo and launched a broad investigation of ``gross mistakes''
made under ousted party boss Erich Honecker.
   The committee gave no precise timetable or details of the
promised political reforms. But it suggested they should be adopted
without delay.
   The party moves followed the Communist government's stunning
decision to throw open the East Germany's borders to the West for
the first time since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961.
   They came at the end of a three-day committee meeting and
closely followed similar promises made Wednesday by new party
leader Egon Krenz. The committee also confirmed Krenz, 52, as party
general secretary.
   Like the dramatic move to open the borders it kept shut for 28
years, the leadership's promises seemed an attempt to address the
demands for more democracy made by hundreds of thousands of
demonstrators in recent weeks.
   They are also designed to calm grass-roots party members who
vented their anger at party leaders at two rallies this week, and
to give the Communists a program they can try to sell to restore
the party's standing.
   The policy-making committee approved a document that admitted
``grave mistakes'' made by Honecker, ousted Oct. 18, and the old
Politburo that resigned en masse Wednesday ``led to a deep crisis.''
   ``Radical reforms are indispensable,'' the document added.
   To this end, it promised:
   _ ``Free, general, democratic and secret elections,'' adding
that the Communists support ``a democratic coalition government;''
   _ More autonomy for local government and the greater separation
of party and government bodies;
   _ New laws on freedom of assembly, association, the press and
moves to restore the supremacy of law and independence of the
judiciary;
   _ Greater openness in the media and a new law on the press;
   _ A parliamentary committee controlling the work of the secret
police and other security organs;
   _ Investigation of the mistakes of the old party leaders and an
end to ``undeserved privileges'' for all party officials;
   _ More say for the workers, more role for market forces and more
orientation toward consumer goods in the economy.
   ``We have a great task before us, a revolution on German soil,
which will bring us a socialism that is economically effective,
politically democratic, (and) morally clean,'' Krenz told a party
rally in East Berlin Friday night.
   He gave no further details of the plans for free elections _ the
key demand of East Germans rallying for democracy in recent weeks.
   The next parliamentary elections are not due until 1991, and
Krenz told visiting West German Social Democrat Johannes Rau on
Thursday that he intended to stick to that timetable.
   However, some party members have demanded that elections be held
next year at the latest.
   The official news agency ADN said four Politburo members were
expelled Friday and that two former Honecker associates were
removed from the Central Committee.
   Fired Friday were full member Hans-Joachim Boehme and three
candidate, or non-voting, members, Johannes Chemnitzer, Werner
Walde and Inge Lange.
   Boehme, 59, had lost the support of his local party
organization, ADN said.
   Earlier this week, the 21-member Politburo was reduced to 11
members. The latest changes left the Politburo with 10 full and
three non-voting members.
   The meeting also set a party conference for Dec. 15-17 to
discuss personnel changes in the 163-member Central Committee.
   Two longtime Honecker associates, Guenter Mittag and Joachim
Herrmann, were kicked out of the Central Committee.
   The Central Committee accused them of ``greatly damaging the
reputation'' of the party and ordered a special commission to
investigate their mistakes. The investigation would include other
party members, ADN said.
   Mittag had been Honecker's economy czar and Herrmann had been
propaganda chief.
   The 10-member Politburo now is made up of: Krenz, Werner
Eberlein, Wolfgang Herger, Werner Jarowinsky, Heinz Kessler,
Siegfried Lorenz, Hans Modrow, Wolfgang Rauchfuss, Guenter
Schabowski and Gerhard Schuerer.
   Its three non-voting members are Margarete Muller, Guenter
Sieber and Hans-Joachim Willerding.

   For decades, politicians in Bonn
dreamed of embracing East Germans in the free West. Now, Chancellor
Helmut Kohl has rushed back from Warsaw to keep the flood of
humanity from turning the dream into a nightmare.
   In one of the most dramatic shifts in postwar Europe, the
Communist East German government has thrown open the Berlin Wall
and also let people cross through the heavily fortified borders
into West Germany. On Friday, in response to the flow of refugees
and overwhelming criticism from the public, the Communist Party's
policy-making Central Committee also promised free elections and
greater separation of party and state.
   The joy of those who came through by foot and car and even on
skateboards only temporarily deflected attention from a suddenly
volatile Central Europe.
   On the human level, there is the question of what do with the
200,000 East Germans who already have poured into West Germany _ to
say nothing of the 1 million more that some have predicted may
swamp one of Europe's most densely populated countries.
   Mayor Walter Momper of West Berlin told a session of the upper
house of Parliament the East German newcomers will keep causing
``large and weighty problems'' for West Germans.
   ``But if we never forget the suffering caused by the Berlin
Wall, and if we keep recalling the happy faces and joy of
yesterday, we can master this challenge together,'' Momper said,
speaking the day after the borders were thrown open.
   After breaking off a politically sensitive trip to Poland, Kohl
planned an emergency meeting of the Cabinet Saturday to map
strategy. At issue is how to proceed both at home and in regard to
the breakneck pace of changes in East Germany.
   The chancellor told reporters the session will consider
``necessary special measures,'' without elaborating.
   Government sources, speaking to The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity, said Kohl also will try to speak with new
East German Communist Party leader, Egon Krenz, by telephone within
the next few few days.
   From a military standpoint, the two nations remain at the
forefront of still officially hostile military alliances. West
Germany is the base for 250,000 U.S. troops, while nearly 400,000
Soviet troops are based in East Germany.
   The military element is vital to the increasingly frequent
predictions the latest shifts and uncertainty in East Germany will
lead to a German reunification.
   Neither Washington nor Moscow is likely to give up completely
its front-line ally any time soon, and German neutrality is a risk
that many in West Germany are unlikely to take.
   Still, says conservative West German lawmaker Eduard Lintner:
``Reunification is coming closer, but I can't say whether it will
take 10, 15 or 20 years. We have the impression that things are
much more concrete than we could have imagined five years ago.''
   Any move toward reunification would cause unease and perhaps
resistance in the Soviet Union, France, Britain and some other
European countries.
   A reunified Germany also would mean an enormous financial
sacrifice for West Germany, as tax money from Bonn flowed eastward
to modernize increasingly outmoded factories and to clean up some
of Europe's worst pollution.
   Perhaps as an interim measure, Kohl increasingly has been
demanding democratic reforms in East Germany in direct exchange for
Bonn's financial aid, to keep East Germans from leaving in droves.
   Kohl said while still in Warsaw that West Germany ``could be
ready to offer significant economic aid if the will to reform
manifested itself in East Germany.''
   At times, it seems that as Kohl talks less and less about actual
reunification the more the topic goes from a nostalgic dream into
the realm of serious discussion.
   Kohl and his top aides also have increasingly been painting a
bleak picture for the East Germans who might want to come over. It
is another sign of growing stress for the government, the strapped
social services and problems such as lack of housing for the
newcomers.
   ``Every refugee must figure that he will have to live in
inadequate housing for a fairly long time, and will probably be
living much worse than if he had stayed home,'' Interior Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble told parliament Thursday.
   Schaeuble repeated the same warning the following day, although
claiming the East Germans still are welcome.

   A brush fire stopped short of an affluent
development above Pacific Palisades on Friday because homeowners
had cleared away brush and water-dropping helicopters acted
quickly, officials said.
   The morning blaze charred nearly 90 acres of chapparal in Santa
Ynez Canyon in hot, dry weather.
   Within two hours, four other brush fires also were reported in
Los Angeles County, including a 200-acre blaze that briefly
threatened ranches outside of Lancaster, 50 miles north of downtown
Los Angeles. All of the fires were contained within hours and no
injuries or property damage were reported, authorities said.
   The other wildfires burned 30 acres in the Santa Susana
Mountains of the San Fernando Valley, 15 acres near Diamond Bar
along the San Bernardino county line, and one acre in Rowland
Heights, about 20 miles east of downtown, officials said.
   The Palisades fire quickly raged into highlands from Sunset
Boulevard toward the development known as the Palisades Highlands,
said Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo.
   Five helicopters operated by city and county fire crews helped
slow the fire, moving like mud wasps between flames leaping 40 feet
high and the nearby Santa Ynez reservoir. Twenty-nine engine
companies assisted from the ground.
   ``The fire department has been on our tails to keep the brush
cleared and that's what's saved us,'' said Hyman H. Haves, board
chairman for 15 homeowners' associations in Palisades Highlands.
   The dense chaparral canyons of Topanga State Park surround the
Palisades Highlands community. The Spanish-style development
nestled in the Santa Monica Mountains consists of 1,200
condominiums and homes valued from $400,000 to $4 million.lanc- 50
mileas north downtown
   Ash fell like a light snowfall over the community, but Haves
said there were no wooden shingle roofs in the area, another factor
that helped stymie the fire.
   He added that the fast response by helicopters was pivotal.
   ``They just doused it,'' he said.
   The Palisades Highlands are just inland from the Pacific
Palisades, in the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains east of
Malibu.

   Nicaragua's government and the U.S.-backed
Contras made progress in their talks on a cease-fire, amnesty and
disbanding of the rebels, officials said Friday. The parties will
meet again next week.
   The talks recessed in the midst of discussing the toughest
issue, whether the Contras would commit to a timetable for
disbanding as part of a package deal including a cease-fire and
amnesty.
   ``We are negotiating now our return to Nicaragua in accord with
the Tela agreement, and we are ready to go back once there is a
meeting of minds between the Sandinistas and our side,'' said
Enrique Bermudez, the Contra military commander and chief
negotiator.
   The agreeement, signed in Tela, Honduras, by the five Central
American presidents last Aug. 7, calls for disbanding of the
Contras by Dec. 5.
   ``We are negotiating; in that sense it is positive. It is
negative in the sense that we could not achieve a cease-fire. There
is a war in Nicaragua,'' said Bermudez.
   The chief Nicaraguan negotiator, Deputy Foreign Minister Victor
Hugo Tinoco, said, ``I think we were able to find some coincidence
(of views), and next week in Washington we are going to continue
those discussions, and we hope we will able to get a sound
agreement that will incorporate the demobilization and the
cease-fire.''
   U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos Brandt said the talks will resume
Monday at the Washington headquarters of the Organization of
American States.
   The talks are being jointly mediated by the OAS and the United
Nations.
   Diplomats said privately that the Contra delegation wanted to
confer over the weekend with a new rebel leadership commission that
was announced this week.
   Brandt confirmed the Contras were still discussing the details
of demobilizing.
   Earlier, he said headway was being made on the Sandinista
insistence on an agreement for the Contras to disband, and on rebel
demands for an amnesty and truce.
   Bermudez has not rejected the Dec. 5 deadline or the concept of
demobilization in the Tela accords, which the Contras did not sign,
said a source close to the talks, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The leftist Sandinistas and Contras are close to agreement on a
cease-fire, but the government wants the truce to be part of a pact
to disband the Contras, said the source.
   Despite tough talk, both sides appeared committed to reaching
agreement on ending an 8-year-old war that has cost an estimated
12,000 lives.
   One new element of uncertainty is whether all Contra field
commanders will abide by any agreement reached at the United
Nations.
   This week, a new rebel civilian-military commission was
announced.
   The leader of the new commission, Israel Galeano, said in a
letter to Vice President Dan Quayle released Friday, ``It would be
foolish to voluntarily hand over our weapons before free elections
are held'' Feb. 25.
   The new commission still authorizes Bermudez to negotiate on its
behalf. The Nicaraguan negotiators recognize the new commission.
   When the first direct talks in more than a year began Thursday,
the U.S.-backed rebels said they would not disband until the
Sandinistas granted amnesty and renewed the cease-fire President
Daniel Ortega canceled last week.
   Government negotiators said Nicaragua would not reinstate the
truce nor grant amnesty until the Contras agreed to demobilize.
   The agreement Ortega and the presidents of Costa Rica,
Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador signed at Tela requires that
the Contras be disbanded by Dec. 5 and Nicaragua hold free
elections by Feb. 25.
   Asked if an agreement was possible, Bermudez replied: ``Anything
is possible with political will.''
   In Managua, government and rebels accused each other Friday of
launching recent attacks.

<HEAD>State and Federal Workers Investigate Outbreak of Rare Illness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal and state health officials on
Friday worked to discover what caused an outbreak of a rare and
sometimes fatal blood disorder.
   Thirty-one cases had been reported by Friday in six widely
scattered states, including 21 in New Mexico, as health authorities
sought to determine if the outbreak was linked to the use of
L-Tryptophan, an amino acid dietary supplement.
   The disease, eosinophilia, is characterized by high counts of
eosinophils, a type of white blood cell. Symptoms may include sharp
muscular pain, fatigue, fever and rashes.
   Dr. Millicent Eidson, environmental epidemiologist with the
state Health and Environment Department, said 21 cases of
eosinophilia have been confirmed in New Mexico, and an additional
case involving a nearby Arizona resident was reported.
   Eidson said 16 of the 17 women patients and one of the five men
had taken L-Tryptophan, which is often sold in health food stores
to promote relaxation and to ease premenstrual syndrome and
sleeping disorders.
   Medical officials also reported four cases in Oregon, three in
Texas and one each from Missouri and Mississippi by Friday.
   At least five of those nine patients also used L-Tryptophan,
said Nancy Hunter, spokeswoman for the Health and Environment
Department.
   Health officials have requested that New Mexico retailers impose
a voluntary ban on sales of L-Tryptophan while the investigation is
under way.
   Teams from the federal Food and Drug Administration and the
Centers for Disease Control came to New Mexico Thursday to assist
in the investigation.
   Personnel from health department's Office of Epidemiology and
the FDA will be working during the weekend to contact the confirmed
cases, Ms. Hunter said on Friday.
   ``They will be getting the patients' Tryptophan and then going
back to the location where they purchased it and getting samples of
the product for testing,'' Ms. Hunter said.
   ``The FDA will be doing a broad spectrum of tests,'' she said.
``Some of the things they might be looking for are heavy metals or
other organic contaminants.''
   Eosinophilia occurs when there is an abnormally high number of
eosinophils, a type of white cell, in the blood.
   Sixteen people died in 1986 nationwide as a result of
hypereosinophilic syndrome, a form of eosiniphilia, and 12 died in
1987, said Sandy Smith of the National Center for Heath Statistics
in Washington, D.C.
   All of the eosinophilia cases in New Mexico suffered severe
muscle pain. Ten of the patients required hospital treatment and as
of Friday one patient, a 51-year-old woman from Gallup, remained
hospitalized in Albuquerque.
   Dr. Gerald Gleich of the Mayo Clinic said both the Missouri and
Mississippi patients had taken L-Tryptophan.
   ``The thing that's unusual is seeing so many patients with the
same pattern,'' Gleich said. ``What's different is there are so
many at one time, and they're all taking L-Tryptophan.''

   Ford Motor Co. Chairman Donald Petersen,
who shepherded the automaker from the gloomy financial days of 1980
to huge profits last year, said Friday he would retire March 1.
   Petersen, 63, will be succeeded as chairman and chief executive
officer by Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer Harold Poling,
who described his predecessor as a ``visionary leader.'' Poling,
64, will be chairman for three years.
   ``I have been chief operating officer or chief executive officer
for 10 years, and I think that it is time for me to make a change
in my life,'' Petersen said, his eyes misting as he spoke at a news
conference.
   During his decade at Ford, the nation's second-largest automaker
staged a remarkable comeback.
   Petersen was elected Ford president in March 1980. By the end of
the year, the automaker lost $1.5 billion. Eight years later, after
cost-cutting, streamlining and payroll shrinking, Ford posted a
$5.3 billion profit.
   ``I do want to thank the 367,000 Ford employees for everything
they have done these past 10 years to bring our company from the
depths of our difficulties at the beginning of this decade to the
sound footing upon which it stands today,'' Petersen said.
   During the 1980s, Ford embarked on ambitious and, at the time,
risky car development programs that resulted in the Ford Taurus and
Mercury Sable cars. They helped paved the way for modern
aerodynamic-looking cars.
   Succeeding Poling as chief operating officer will be Philip
Benton, who will become corporate president. That title was dropped
when Poling became vice chairman in October 1987.
   ``I'm surprised that Petersen is retiring early,'' said analyst
Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. in New
York City. ``I think he (Poling) is really going to sit there and
wait it out for the next chairman.''
   Petersen joined Ford in 1949 and held a variety of positions in
domestic and international product planning, design and marketing
before he became president. Poling's Ford career began in 1951 and
focused mainly on the financial side of the corporation.
   Poling said his goal during the next three years is to continue
current programs at Ford.
   During Petersen's tenure, the company branched out and became
heavily involved in financial acquisitions, capped last month with
the completion of the purchase of Associates Corp. for $3.35
billion.
   Ford's acquisitions spilled over into the automotive sector,
too. It bought Aston Martin in 1987 and bid $2.5 billion last month
for Jaguar. Ford officials have said they hope the Jaguar
acquisition is completed by the end of the year.

   East Germany's decision to open its borders to the West brought
accolades from world leaders, tempered with caution from some and
words of warning against too swift a move to reform.
   Hungary's Socialist Party annnounced its support of East
Germany's action and Ferenc Kosa, a member the party's presidium,
said ``the reforms now under way in East Germany will contribute to
the unfolding democratization in the whole region.''
   Hungary had been concerned about East German insensitivity to
Hungary's own reforms before the replacement of East Germany's
hard-line leader Erich Honecker last month by Egon Krenz.
   On Sept. 10, Hungary opened its borders to East Germans wishing
to emigrate to the West, and tens of thousands used this route to
flee their country before the dramatic announcement Thursday that
they would be permitted to travel straight to the West from East
Germany.
   In Warsaw, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa told the Polish news
agency PAP the changes in East Germany ``should have been taken
much earlier.''
   ``The drama of the events in East Germany is the result of
earlier neglect, as usually happens when someone misses the train
of history,'' Walesa said.
   Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry spokesman Lubomir Marsik said the
opening of the East German border ``represents a positive
solution.''
   ``The situation was getting difficult for everybody, including
Czechoslovakia,'' he said, referring to the thousands of East
Germans who previously were forced to go West via a third country,
often Czechoslovakia.
   The United States, Britain and France offered their military
camps in West Germany to handle the expected flood of people from
the east.
   French President Francois Mitterrand said moves toward freedom
and democracy in Eastern Europe ``open a new phase in European
history'' and added he hoped to visit East Germany.
   In Portugal, the U.S. ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, William H. Taft IV, rejected speculation about
reunification and said the changes under way in Eastern Europe
increase the risk of instability.
   But Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnandze called the
border opening ``a reasonable and sensible decision'' and added
that Moscow was not worried that the pace of events in Eastern
Europe was a threat.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, however, said
the Soviet Union was concerned about instability brought on by the
exodus of East Germans to the West.
   Gerasimov stressed the border between East and West Germany
remained in force and that eased travel restrictions should not be
taken as heralding the imminent reunification of the two Germanies
split since the end of World War II.
   He warned that West Germany ``should take into account that
policies aimed at reconsidering borders would not suit any
government in Europe and would cause only mistrust.''
   It was ``a great day for freedom,'' said British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher. But the fast pace of reforms in East Germany
called ``for keeping a very cool head and being very steady and
being very practical about it,'' she added.
   Asked about the possibility of reunification, she replied, ``You
are going much too fast. You have to take these things step by
step. The first thing is to get a genuine multiparty democracy in
East Germany,'' the prime minister said.
   Prime Minister Harri Holkeri of Finland told Finnish radio, ``As
far as I can see, the final outcome of World War II still stands
and the situation will not change because of these developments.''
   The Belgian government, calling the move ``a victory for freedom
and democratic ideals,'' also urged caution.
   Mark Eyskens, the Belgian foreign minister, said: ``Those who
demand new frontiers are irresponsible. ... Measured progress is
required to avoid anarchy.''
   Also speaking in Brussels, the European Economic Community
External Affairs Commissioner Hans Andriessen said the East
European nations were not yet ready for EEC membership.
   But French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said the thawing of
Eastern Europe creates obligations for the EEC.
   The West should reflect on ``these two or three new pieces of
data which are going to change the face of Europe and probably the
global balance,'' Dumas said.
   The West was now ``called upon to stretch out its hand even
further for cooperation to (remove) the economic deficit in East
Europe,'' said Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky.
   The Spanish government called for free elections and said East
Germany's decision ``opens a path of hope in the democratic
development of Europe.''
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said: ``We see this event
as part of an inevitable process which must lead to further reform,
free elections and full self-determination by the population.''

<UNK>`Pooh Pooh Choo-Choo' Heading Back To Baltimore</UNK>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baltimore officials agreed Friday to take back
a trainload of sewage sludge after authorities in Louisiana and
Mississippi refused to let a disposal company unload the ``Pooh
Pooh Choo-Choo'' in their states.
   Mayor Kurt Schmoke felt that although Baltimore was not legally
obligated to take back the nonhazardous waste shipment, it did have
a moral obligation to do so, said George Balog, the city's public
works director.
   The first of the 63 carloads will begin arriving in about nine
days at the Back River waste treatment plant that produced the
sludge, he said. The 5,000 tons of sludge will be treated with lime
and then transferred to a facility that will mix the waste with
leaves and sell it as compost, he said.
   Back River is under a court order to reduce a backlog of sludge
at the plant.
   The cost of returning the sludge to Baltimore will be borne by
GSX Chemical Services of Columbia, S.C., Balog said.
   GSX contracted with the city to dispose of the sludge and
initially sent it to its waste treatment facility in White Castle,
La., but residents of Assumption Parish complained vehemently about
the stench.
   The company moved the train to Moss Point in southeast
Mississippi on Nov. 3, but Mississippi officials threatened to fine
GSX $2 million a day if the company didn't take it out of the state.
   GSX will get a chance to challenge the fines during a hearing
Nov. 21.
   Private landfills in a number of states were willing to accept
the shipment, but public officials refused to allow the waste in,
Balog said.
   ``The permitted landfills are there,'' he said. ``However,
because of this particular issue of this sludge train, it became so
controversial that state officials did not want to accept it.''
   In Arkansas, the Pollution Control and Ecology Department
obtained a temporary restraining order Thursday preventing a
landfill in Arkansas County from accepting the sludge.

<TEXT>
   A solitary building stands on the far corner of
the once teeming and elegant Potsdamer Platz, now a desolate no
man's land overlooking a jagged corner of the Berlin Wall.
   Potsdamer Platz will soon regain at least a semblance of its
former prominence after 28 years as a Cold War curiosity, East
German officials said Friday.
   Devastated during World War II and long a lonely tourist
attraction for a glimpse over the Berlin Wall, Potsdamer Platz will
shortly become another major transit checkpoint between East and
West Berlin.
   Its opening comes as part of East Berlin's decision to open its
borders to the West, officials say.
   Since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, Potsdamer Platz and
similar landmarks have been sober reminders of the brutal division
of the city and the two Germanys.
   For many Berliners, the blockaded Brandenburg Gate and Potsdamer
Platz are the starkest symbols of that division. In both cases, two
main thoroughfares end abrubtly at the concrete base of the
imposing, graffiti-smeared Wall.
   When Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany
told a rally in West Berlin that the East Germans had decided to
punch a hole through the Wall at Potsdamer Platz, the crowd roared
with applause and cheers.
   Another famous crossing has also taken on new tasks.
   Berlin's Glienicke Bridge, a frequent site of East-West swaps of
spies and political prisoners, has since been opened to accommodate
more travelers.
   Another notorious stretch of the Wall is also to be opened _
Bernauer Strasse, where scenes of dramatic escape attempts stunned
the world 28 years ago.
   A house near the new checkpoint still stands with its
westward-facing windows boarded and sealed with bricks, testimony
to the first desperate attempts to jump to freedom as the Wall was
going up.
   Nearby, others died later in escape attempts that ended in a
hail of bullets. Eighty people died trying to cross the Wall.
   The Wall's most famous crossing, Checkpoint Charlie, will remain
in use for foreign visitors, although East German border guards
have allowed scores of East Berliners to use the crossing since
travel restrictions were lifted on Friday.
   No plans have surfaced so far to tear down the concrete barriers
that stand in front of the massive, 18th-century Brandenburg Gate,
which for decades has been a rallying point of protest against the
city's partition.

   Lech Walesa on Friday said Europe is witnessing
``a new generation'' of leadership, with the new guard dedicated to
reuniting the divided continent.
   The Solidarity leader made his comments to reporters at Mirabel
Airport as he began a 10-day visit to Canada and the United States.
During the visit, he will travel to New York, Philadelphia and
Chicago.
   Airport onlookers cheered the shipyard electrician who
spearheaded Solidarity's successful challenge to Poland's communist
leadership.
   Walesa rejected suggestions that he had been the catalyst for
the changes now occurring in Eastern Europe.
   ``Everyone is responsible, the media, the television,
everybody,'' Walesa said. ``A new generation is taking over. We
want one unified Europe.
   Earlier in Warsaw, Walesa told the Polish news agency PAP the
changes in East Germany, which include relaxing travel
restrictions, the promise of democratic elections and the
resignations of longtime Communist leader Erich Honecker and his
ruling Politburo, ``should have been taken much earlier.''
   ``The drama of the events in East Germany is the result of
earlier neglect, as usually happens when someone misses the train
of history,'' he said.
   Walesa, 46, is on a foreign tour to plead for aid and foreign
investment for economically strapped Poland. After 10 days in North
America, he will conclude his trip with a visit to Venezuela Nov.
19.
   The 1983 Nobel Peace Prize winner was greeted at the airport by
Canadian Labor Congress leader Shirley Carr and Louis Laberge,
president of the Quebec Federation of Labor.
   Walesa flew into Toronto late Friday for weekend meetings with
political leaders and tributes by the local Polish community and a
labor confederation in Hamilton, Ontario. He is to travel to Ottawa
Monday to meet Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and then go to
Washington for talks with President Bush and to give an address to
a joint session of Congress.
   Poland's Solidarity-led government has said that it needs at
least $2.5 billion in loans from Western sources to begin its
program for economic liberalization.
   Walesa has no official role in the new government but is a close
confidant of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a Solidarity
veteran.

<HEAD>Britain's Defense Chief Says ``Lunacy'' To Renounce Strong Defense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Tom King said in an interview
published Friday that it would be lunacy for Britain to renounce
its longstanding policy of strong defenses in the face of Eastern
bloc reform and disarmament.
   Britain's independent nuclear deterrent could not be submitted
as a bargaining factor at East-West disarmament talks ``for the
foreseeable future,'' he said in the interview with the domestic
British news agency Press Association.
   Repeating what Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has said on
previous occasions, King stressed that Britain and NATO needed to
maintain their guard against Soviet-led Warsaw Pact forces and said
he believed the British public would understand this, PA reported.
   It said he also pointed to difficulties being faced at East-West
talks on conventional arms reductions in Vienna and warned there
was a considerable way to go in this area.
   Britain and France are the only two West European nations who
have their own nuclear forces independent of the the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization's nuclear arsenal.
   Britain plans to update its ageing submarine-borne Polaris
nuclear missiles by the mid-1990s with a more powerful Trident
system bought from the United States.
   PA quoted King as saying: ``It is true the present tremendous
changes might make some people think we don't need defense any
more. But it is a very human emotion to see your own country
properly defended.''
   He said events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union were
happening fast and it was impossible to predict how they would turn
out, PA reported.
   It quoted him as saying progress had been achieved by
maintaining strong defenses to ensure that freedom in the West was
not overwhelmed by communist pressures and intimidation.
   ``By being prepared to maintain strong defenses, we have seen
this opportunity for improvement. The one thing which would be
lunacy and almost criminal would be just at this moment to change
our approach which could damage this process of reform,'' PA
reported him as saying.
   ``We must keep our defenses strong but respond in a positive and
constructive way to the approaches from the Soviet Union and the
Warsaw Pact.''
   PA said the interview by its defense correspondent Charles
Miller was conducted in London Thursday.
   Britain's opposition Labor Party this year shed its vote-losing
policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament in favor of a
multilateralist stance. Under this, a Labor government would only
scrap Britain's independent nuclear force in a negotiated arms
control deal.
   Political analysts say Labor's defense policy change is a main
reason for the current surge in the party's fortunes. Labor has
lost three successive elections to Mrs. Thatcher's governing
Conservative Party since 1979 but now leads the Conservatives by up
to 12 points in opinion polls.
   Mrs. Thatcher said Labor's new defense policy was merely a form
of words to see the party through the next general election, due by
mid-1992.

   President Bush promised Friday ``to seize
every chance'' to promote democracy in turbulent Eastern Europe but
Secretary of State James A. Baker III ruled out substantial Western
aid for East Germany until ``there is political pluralism across
the board.''
   Bush, traveling in Texas, noted the spectacle of Berliners
hacking at the wall that divides their city with hammers and
chisels and the opening of 18 crossings in the wall and said he was
surprised at the speed of change.
   The accelerating torrent of change in previously closed
societies ``offers us all much hope and deserves our continued
encouragement,'' Bush said in a Dallas speech.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl spoke with Bush by telephone for 18 minutes
and gave him a ``thorough briefing on the first part of his trip to
Poland and on developments in East Germany.''
   Bush congratulated Kohl on his handling of the East German
situation and ``promised the full cooperation of the United
States.''
   The two ``agreed that these dramatic developments make the Malta
meeting (between Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev) even
more important and agreed to consult closely between now and the
meeting,'' Fitzwater said. He said they would talk again next week.
   Speaking a day after the East German government announced a
lifting of all travel restrictions and just before news arrived of
a promise of free elections in East Germany, Bush said, ``We will
seize every opportunity to contribute to lasting peace and to
extend democracy.''
   Bush offered no specifics as to future policy, saying only that
he would be guided by ``prudence'' and ``imagination.''
   But in remarks at a fund-raising dinner for Texas Gov. Bill
Clements, the president sounded a note of restraint.
   ``The best way to keep America and the West free is to keep the
United States of America strong,'' Bush said.
   ``This country must not base its foreign policy or its national
security on the aspirations of one man inside the Soviet Union or
anywhere else.''
   Bush departed from his text to add: ``We're living in exciting
times. The rapidity of change is mind-boggling, and I will do my
level best to conduct an imaginative foreign policy, but I will be
prudent. ... I will do my best to move freedom forward.''
   He said Kohl ``asked me to share with the American people his
conviction ... that this remarkable change that's taking place in
Eastern Europe, most recently in the German Democratic Republic,
could never have taken place without the steadfast loyal support of
the United States of America.''
   As the president was speaking, the Central Committee of the East
German Communist Party was promising free elections, freedom of
association and assembly, supervision of security forces by
parliament and an end to official privileges.
   Egon Krenz, the new party general secretary, told a rally, ``We
have a great task before us, a revolution on German soil.''
   Baker hinted at a go-slow approach toward East Germany.
``There's a long way to go before there is true freedom and true
political pluralism in East Germany,'' Baker said on ABC's ``Good
Morning America.''
   Baker, while calling the East German decision to open its
borders ``the most dramatic event in East-West relations'' since
the end of World War II, said the United States and other allies
believe any discussion of an aid program now would be premature.
   The allies, he said, will be much more forthcoming about helping
East Germany only if there is ``political pluralism across the
board.''
   Baker said freedom to travel must be followed by other steps
before there can be a serious discussion of a united Germany.
   In another television appearance, on ``MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour''
on public television, Baker said, ``This would never have happened,
of course, wim Zo_^=-L,4:y=y

   }hzte administration
was too cautious, BAker said, ``We are extraordinarily happy about
it.''
   Comments in official Washington all day mixed caution with
exaltation.
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, traveling
with the president, captured some of the exaltation in reporting on
a conversation with Bush during the flight to Dallas:
   ``We talked about East Germany and the thrill in our hearts and
minds of all people everywhere over what's happening with the
crumbling of the Berlin Wall,'' he said.
   ``We cannot house the world,'' said Kemp, ``but we can
definitely do our best to be compassionate'' and help West Germany
cope with the flood of refugees from the East.
   While some analysts predicted that some possible changes in
Europe could mean the breakup of NATO, U.S. officials like Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney did not go that far _ but conceded there
would be changes in the alliance.
   Meanwhile, important senators welcomed the changes in East
Germany and called for further liberalization, including free
elections.
   East Germany's ambassador, Gerhard Herder, said he found
President Bush's reaction to the events in Berlin ``encouraging''
but warned that any miscalculation in the Western reaction could
lead to ``bigger conflicts.''
   In a speech at the National Press Club, Herder promised that
East Germany would be ``a predictable partner'' for the West.
   He noted that the East German armed forces are only a short
distance away from the American, British and French forces
stationed in West Berlin.
   ``By any miscalculation, they could be involved. This could lead
to a conflict,'' he said.
   Asked whether he could foresee a unified Germany, Herder
replied: ``In my dreams, yes. But being a politician, I don't see
any prospect for a united Germany,'' because the two Germanies are
members of opposing alliances.
   The only action taken by the Bush administration has been an
offer of ``all possible assistance'' to the West German government
as it struggles to cope with the flood of refugees. The Pentagon
said it was making available housing for 980 people in three
off-base installations.
   ``Were we surprised by the speed of it?'' Baker asked in a
separate interview on CBS. ``You bet your life.''
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said in a statement, ``East Germany should
also hold truly democratic elections.''
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a former committee chairman, said
the East German authorities may be intent on getting rid of ``the
bad eggs'' before moving to restore the hard-line system.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the ``very positive''
changes, if they led to non-Communist governments in the East,
would mean ``less of a threat'' and that in turn ``might portend
some changes on our side.''
   One change, said retired Gen. Bernard Rogers, a former NATO
commander, would be fewer U.S. troops in Europe _ there are 340,000
now _ and a revision in the ``forward strategy'' that puts fighting
units close to the border.

   Four million Americans may have Alzheimer's
disease _ 1.5 million more than had been thought _ according to
findings that suggest the disease and its treatment will ``weigh
heavily on our future.''
   A study of 3,623 elderly people in Boston indicates one in 10 of
them probably had Alzheimer's disease, which robs people of their
memories and their ability to function, researchers said.
   The rates of Alzheimer's grew rapidly higher with advancing age,
as nearly half of those older than 85 suffer from it, said the
researchers, led by Dr. Denis A. Evans of Harvard Medical School.
   Based on the study's results, the National Institute on Aging
revised its estimate of how many people in the United States suffer
from Alzheimer's from 2.5 million to 4 million.

   A consumer group is calling for tighter
controls on toxic gasoline vapors, saying that motorists who pump
their own gas are being exposed to unhealthy levels of
cancer-causing benzene and other pollutants.
   Citizen Action, a Washington-based organization that focuses on
consumer and environmental issues, accused the oil companies
Thursday of ignoring health concerns by increasing levels of
benzene and other aromatic hydrocarbons in unleaded gasoline to
boost its octane rating.
   The American Petroleum Institute issued a statement that
disputed the claims and accused Citizen Action of raising
``unwarranted fears about motorists' exposure to gasoline.''
   The Environmental Protection Agency acknowledged that toxic
vapors from gasoline at the pump are a health concern, but an
agency spokesman suggested the claims raised by Citizen Action on
health impact may be exaggerated.

   House and Senate Democrats, with the help of a
maverick Republican senator, are setting the stage for a new
showdown with President Bush over child care subsidies.
   Negotiators from the two congressional bodies reached agreement
Thursday night on legislation that would increase direct federal
child care subsidies to low- and moderate-income families by $1.2
billion in 1990 and by up to $8.5 billion over the next five years.
   The accord was struck after Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, dropped
his demand that states be allowed to issue vouchers for a new $300
million program to pay for keeping schools open longer hours to
provide day care and establish a new education-driven program for
pre-school tots.
   ``At least we have a running shot now with a bill that the
president might not veto,'' said Hatch, who angered the
administration, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole and conservative
groups by joining with liberal Democrats last spring in putting
together the basic package.

   Opponents of smoking aboard airliners are on
the verge of winning their fight to forbid passengers from lighting
up on practically all U.S. flights.
   The Senate by voice vote Thursday passed a prohibition against
cigarette smoking on all but a handful of domestic flights.
Tobacco-state lawmakers, long convinced they were badly
outnumbered, made no comments on the prohibition.
   The House approved the ban, included in a $12 billion
transportation bill for the new fiscal year, on Oct. 31. The Senate
will continue debate on the spending measure Tuesday and will send
it to President Bush for his signature if no changes in the
legislation are made.
   ``Approval of this law is a milestone in the efforts to protect
those who don't want to put themselves at risk by inhaling other
people's smoke,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., the measure's
sponsor.

   A recent round of layoffs has been
unsettling, especially for the communities and individuals
involved, but it doesn't appear to signal a return to high
unemployment, economists say.
   Wang Laboratories Inc., Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Chrysler
Corp., Unisys Corp. and Campbell Soup Co. are among companies that
have announced major layoffs in recent days.
   But most economists don't predict a surge in layoffs, at least
for the next year.
   Of 50 economists surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators of
Sedona, Ariz., only a third see a recession starting by the end of
1990. Another third see one in 1991 and the rest don't predict a
recession until 1992 or beyond.

   Americans expect greater wealth in the 1990s,
but also greater crime. They see better days for their schools, but
worsening pollution in their skies. They think they'll be smoking
less, and doing drugs more.
   One of the most widely held expectations for the next decade is
for a Democrat to win the White House, a national survey by Media
General and The Associated Press has found. Among the
least-expected developments: the demise of communism.
   In the broadest measures, many respondents expressed optimism
about the future. Roughly six in 10 expected life for others to
improve in the next decade, and three-quarters saw their own lives
getting better.
   But there were sobering assessments on some issues. More than
six in 10 expected pollution and crime to worsen, and almost as
many saw more AIDS, homelessness and world hunger as the year 2000
approaches.
   The environment stood out as a chief concern. Twelve percent
expected pollution to be the nation's greatest problem a decade
from now; only drug abuse was named by more, 17 percent.
   Moreover, 65 percent expected pollution to worsen in the next 10
years. And almost half said the warming of the atmosphere because
of pollution, known as the greenhouse effect, could threaten human
survival.
   Education, conversely, was a bright spot: Fifty-eight percent
expected it to improve in the next decade. Personal wealth also was
a point of optimism, with 56 percent expecting their family's
financial situation to improve.
   But respondents divided about evenly when asked whether they
expected the U.S. economy to improve, worsen or remain about the
same. And 52 percent expected the federal budget deficit to worsen.
   Younger respondents in many cases were the most pessimistic, and
optimism often increased with age. For example, 52 percent of those
aged 18-24 expected the United States to become involved in a war
in the next decade, while just 41 percent of their elders shared
their fear. And among the oldest group, over 64 years old, just 27
percent expected war.
   Similarly, six in 10 in the youngest group expected drug abuse
to worsen and two-thirds of them saw acquired immune deficiency
syndrome as a growing problem, while nearer to half of the older
respondents said so.
   The most widely expected eventualities were a Democrat winning
the presidency, which 72 percent called likely; cigarette smokers
shrinking to a tiny minority of the population, which 59 percent
called likely; and much greater restrictions on abortion, which
were expected by 56 percent.
   The poll found a lowering of some expectations in the past
decade. In a 1979 survey by the Roper Organization, 51 percent
expected the four-day work week to become common in the 1980s; when
the question was repeated in the new poll, just 41 percent held
that expectation for the 1990s.
   Expectations also changed on energy issues. Fewer people now
expect new energy sources to end dependency on oil _ 49 percent,
compared with 60 percent in 1979. And more expect the role of
nuclear power to decline _ 45 percent now, compared with 33 percent
10 years ago.
   More people are dubious that racial and religious discrimination
could largely disappear _ 77 percent think not, compared with 66
percent in 1979. In both polls, nine in 10 doubted that poverty
will be almost eliminated.
   Other possibilities were expected by sizable groups, though not
majorities. Slightly more than one-third said it was likely the
Republican Party would win control of Congress in the 1990s; nearly
four in 10 expected a woman to be elected president; 42 percent
called it likely U.S. astronauts will reach Mars; and 42 percent
expected cures for cancer and for AIDS.
   On international affairs, 46 percent expected terrorism to
worsen, with the rest roughly divided between its improving or
remaining about the same. And regardless of pro-democracy movements
in many communist countries, 70 percent called it unlikely that
communism will largely disappear in the 1990s.
   The poll was conducted by telephone Sept. 14-24 among a random
sample of 1,071 adult Americans, and had a margin of error of 3
percentage points.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews Sept. 14-24 with 1,071 adults in the
continental United States. Phone numbers were selected randomly and
interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent
birthday, a random phenomenon.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that 19 of
20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the result if
every adult American were asked the same questions. The error
margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. What do you think will be the most important problem facing

<HEAD>Africa is Becoming Major Route for Heroin Smuggling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHEGE MBITIRU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's Islamic revolution and the war in
Afghanistan have made Africa a major smuggling route for Southwest
Asia's heroin. Most of it is finding its way to Europe, but some
goes to the United States.
   Africans latching on to the trafficking are finding the money is
too good to resist, particularly on a continent with a high
unemployment rate and serious ecomomic problems. The wholesale
price for a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of pure heroin is about $150,000,
and for an African trying to scrape by the temptation might be too
great.
   That is one reason the United States has begun to help African
authorities combat trafficking, even though most of the heroin
winds up in Europe. U.S. officials are concerned that if
trafficking takes greater hold in Africa it could bring new
instability to the continent.
   The heroin comes from Pakistan and Afghanistan, and Interpol,
the international police organization, says 236 Africans were
arrested and 1,160 pounds of heroin seized last year in Pakistan,
India, Africa, and Europe.
   That represents a sharp increase since 1984, when Interpol
recorded the arrests of only 11 Africans carrying 105 pounds of
heroin in Africa, Asia, and Europe.
   While Interpol is unable to estimate the amount of the heroin
moving through Africa, it says the number of Africans arrested in
1988 indicates it has been sharply on the rise.
   Previously, Southwest Asian nationals smuggled heroin to Europe
overland through Iran, Turkey and the Balkan countries. Some was
diverted to India and Pakistan and later smuggled to Europe by air
or sea.
   However, the overland route was disrupted by the Soviet military
intervention in Afghanistan in 1979 and a ruthless crackdown on
drugs by Iran's Islamic leaders.
   With the traditional route blocked, traffickers turned to Africa.
   But African governments were ill-equipped and too inexperienced
in the narcotics trade to deal effectively with the problem.
   Peter Masemo, head of Kenya's anti-narcotics squad, said, for
example: ``At first we didn't know what we were looking for.''
   In an effort to stop the heroin from reaching their streets,
Western governments, including Britain as well as the United
States, now are helping the African nations.
   In September, the Bush administration sent Thomas R. Pickering,
the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to persuade Nigeria to
renew an agreement under which the United States assists the West
African nation's anti-drugs effort. An agreement was signed in
Washington soon after.
   A month later Britain and Nigeria signed a similar pact.
   Interpol figures indicate the majority of the African
traffickers are from Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Mali and Gambia.
   ``But no African nation is unaffected by the trafficking of
Southwest Asia heroin,'' says Joseph E. Fortier, head of Interpol's
drugs subdivision.
   The heroin enters Africa by air and sea mainly through eastern
countries, with Kenya, Egypt and Ethiopia favored because of
frequent connecting flights to West Africa.
   In West Africa, the drug is repackaged and carried by individual
couriers or hidden in freight shipments to Western Europe or North
America.
   Interpol says the smugglers use all major airports in Western
Europe. However, an enterprising few have slipped through East
European airports, including Moscow, East Berlin, and Warsaw.
   The seriousness of the problem was underlined in June at an
Interpol-sponsored meeting in Nairobi. Narcotics agents from 25
countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and North America attended the
closed-door meeting.
   ``We concluded the situation was increasingly getting worse,''
said an African participant who spoke only on condition of
anonymity. ``We also felt African governments can't fight the drugs
menace alone. We need assistance.''
   Al Unger, a State Department spokesman in Washington, says the
United States spent at least $124,000 in 1987 and 1988 to help
fight the trafficking.
   The money bought vehicles, communications and drug-detecting
equipment, as well as sniffer dogs, and paid for the training of
narcotics agents, customs agents and judicial officers.
   The beneficiaries included Kenya, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, and
Cameroon. In addition, Sudan, Niger, Kenya and Togo each received
drugs testing kits worth between $200 and $300 each last year.
   The United States also is planning a $75,000 West African
contraband customs school for Benin, Guinea, Niger, Senegal, and
Togo. A similar one for English-speaking Nigeria and Ghana would
cost $40,000, Unger says.

   Herik Othieno, an
environmentalist, is pretty sure the greenhouse effect has come to
his Kenya homeland because malarial mosquitos native to the hot
lowlands have migrated to the cool highlands.
   ``With temperatures rising worldwide, there are strong
indications that their presence is one of the results of the
greenhouse effect,'' Othieno said in an interview here.
   For many Third World nations, troubled by fragile economies and
substandard agricultural sectors, the greenhouse effect's global
warming will have grave consequences, environmental experts warned
here recently at an international conference on the greenhouse
effect.
   While industrialized countries have the scientific potential to
find technological solutions to the problem and the money to pay
for them, most developing nations are unable to cope with it.
   ``Unfortunately, they do not have the means,'' said Celso Roque,
head of the Philippine delegation to the 68-nation conference.
   Some experts believe global warming, which amounted to a
1.5-degree (Fahrenheit) rise in the average worldwide temperature
over the past century, is caused mainly by the carbon dioxide
emissions from power plants, factories and cars in the
industrialized world.
   At the Noordwijk conference, delegates adopted a resolution
calling for stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions ``as soon as
possible.''
   But the two largest industrialized nations, the United States
and Japan, refused to commit themselves to the year 2000 as the
date by which stabilization should be implemented.
   Many scientists predict that if the emissions _ and those of
other gases associated with the greenhouse effect _ continue, the
pace of global warming could increase four to sevenfold in the next
century.
   ``I predict the Third World will be hardest hit by such a rise
in temperatures,'' said the American environmentalist Dan Becker of
the Washington-based Sierra Club.
   ``Think of their current unstable food situation _ it can only
get worse as their agricultural sectors collapse under
environmental pressure,'' Becker told a reporter outside the
conference room.
   Many experts, among them Kenya's Othieno, believe the greenhouse
effect will ultimately lead to a vast increase in desert areas.
   Some experts also predict that low-lying coastal and delta
nations such as Bangladesh could be inundated as the sea level
rises as a result of the melting polar ice caps.
   ``We may suppose that the absence of rains, and the
unpredictable character of the weather in general, are initial
signs of the greenhouse effect,'' said Othieno, a staff member of a
Nairobi-based environmentalist group called Energy and Environment
Organization.
   Roque of the Philippines painted a gloomy picture of a Third
World hit by droughts precipitated by the greenhouse effect.
   ``Crop lands will turn into deserts, there will be more forest
fires. ... Hydroelectric dams and irrigation systems will be
rendered useless,'' Roque told delegates.
   Continued global warming could result in an ominous change in
the oceans, he said. ``Ocean currents will be modified with
unpredictable consequences for world fisheries.''
   Many conference officials from developing nations said the
industrialized world, where 65 percent of all greenhouse-related
emissions originate, should take the lead in reversing the trend.
   ``The incessant large-scale burning of non-renewable fossil
fuels in the North is ecologically disgraceful,'' Roque said.
   Delegates here also agreed to set up a fund to help developing
nations cope not only with the consequences of climate change, but
also with one of its major causes _ destruction of tropical rain
forests.
   ``We must protect the scant natural resources we have in the
Third World,'' Othieno said.
   That involves more than just conservation, for there are also
pressing social and economic dimensions, Roque noted.
   ``Population growth drives the impoverished landless peasants
into forest lands, where they slash and burn the forests to eke out
a living,'' he said.
   ``The pressure to generate foreign exchange for the heavy debt
payments and the political necessity of providing employment
justify commercial logging.''

   For 45-year-old Savitri Devi, the routine
of cooking, drawing water from the well, cleaning her one-story
brick house and taking an afternoon nap soon will be broken _ but
only for a time.
   Later this month, millions like Devi in India's farming villages
will decide who should govern their country.
   The burden of choosing rests lightly on Devi's shoulders.
   ``I'll vote for whomever my husband votes for,'' she says in
Hindi, sitting in the warmth of the sun on a rope cot outside her
home.
   More than three-fourths of India's 498 million voters live in
villages, making the rural vote the most important electoral bank
for any party in the elections for Parliament and prime minister
Nov, 22, 24 and 26.
   Devi expresses resentment at the governing Congress Party, which
she blames for the high price of sugar and the cutting down of the
forest outside the village.
   The men of Sanoli, a village of 2,000 people 70 miles southwest
of New Delhi, talk of wider issues, but their political leanings
soon escalate into arguments.
   The village is in the northern state of Rajasthan and has
usually been considered a Congress Party stronghold.
   ``These people do not know what they are talking about,'' says
72-year-old Hari Krishan Sharma, the village priest, referring to a
group of villagers who derided his support for the Congress Party.
``I am a wise elephant surrounded by barking dogs.
   ``What will you give water to? To a tree firmly planted in the
soil or to a sapling which will be blown away in the next storm?''
   The question was intended to illustrate Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi's promise of stable government _ the firmly planted tree _
if he and his Congress Party are returned to power.
   But others sitting on a raised platform outside the village
temple were unconvinced.
   Budh Ram, a wiry mustachioed farmer, said two years of rule by
the opposition had given more to the village than the 39 years of
rule by the Congress Party.
   ``We voted the Congress to power in the last elections. The
candidate is my sister's brother-in-law. But he hasn't visited the
village once in these five years. He'll be routed this time,'' Ram
said.
   ``Only senile old men like him will vote for the Congress now,''
he said, gesturing toward Sharma.
   Usually divided opposition parties have united for the second
time in history to fight the Congress Party.
   The previous attempt was briefly successful, when the opposition
dislodged the Congress Party from power in 1977, ousting Rajiv
Gandhi's mother, Indira Gandhi, from the prime minister's office.
But the fragile unity soon disentegrated and midterm polls were
called in 1980, which were won by the Congress Party and Mrs.
Gandhi returned and was assassinated four years later.
   The opposition is focusing this year on its charges of
corruption and inept leadership by Rajiv Gandhi, who succeeded his
mother in 1984.
   The viewpoint has been brought to Sanoli by word-of-mouth or
read in newspapers by the few literate people in the village.
Television and radio are controlled by the state and little
anti-governement news is broadcast.
   ``The people tilling the fields go to sleep hungry,'' Ram said.
``The Congress lives luxuriously and spends fortunes in hotels.
Where has the money from Bofors gone?''
   The reference was to opposition charges that senior Congress
politicians and government officials received millions of dollars
in kickbacks from the Swedish firm, AB Bofors, for a $1.4 billion
contract to supply artillery to the Indian army.
   The charges have become a rallying cry for the opposition.
Gandhi has denied the charges and says he is not personally
involved.
   Another issue is the government's involvement in the ethnic
strife in neighboring Sri Lanka, where at least 1,100 Indian
soldiers sent to restore peace have been killed in fighting Tamil
rebels.
   The issue is live in Sanoli because five young men from the
village have died in Sri Lanka.
   ``Gandhi sent our children to Sri Lanka,'' said Sher Singh, who
runs a small grocery store. ``Why did we have to go to another
man's home? I don't blame the Sri Lankans. I'll kill anyone who
interferes in my home.''

   Baltimore and Washington once shared little
besides I-95, the American League and Eastern Time. Baltimore was
blue-collar muscle, Washington white-collar power; there were
Orioles and Colts fans, and there were Senators and Redskins fans.
   Now there is Allan Fleming, who lives in this community near the
divide in the Washington-Baltimore commutersheds. ``He's a real big
Orioles fan and a dyed-in-the-wool Redskins fan,'' says Fleming's
wife, Pepper.
   He's also a resident of BaltWash, one name for the continuously
populated region of 6 million people stretching from north-central
Virginia to eastern West Virginia to the Pennsylvania line.
   The 1990 census will almost certainly redefine greater
Washington and Baltimore as one Consolidated Metropolitan
Statistical Area _ ``the largest merger of metropolitan areas in
world history,'' according to Census Bureau demographer Richard
Forstall.
   When the century began, Americans lived in isolated spots of
farmland and open country, or huddled together in central cities
and towns. As it moves into its last decade, they are sprawling out
in all directions.
   ``Metropolitan areas are bumping into each other,'' says Peter
Muller, a University of Miami urban geographer. ``It's been
happening for years, but now you can really see it.''
   You can see it in the region between Boston and Washington,
where ``Megalopolis'' _ the vast city forecast by Jean Gottman 30
years ago _ now includes 25 continguous metropolitan areas and
one-sixth of the nation's population.
   The Census Bureau says the four most advanced sections of
Megalopolis are Boston-Providence, New York-Philadelphia,
Harrisburg-York, Pa., and Washington-Baltimore. Within each
section, substantial numbers of people live in one metro area and
commute to another.
   The metropolitan economies of Baltimore and Washington are the
most tightly entwined. Here in Columbia, 24 miles from the
Washington Monument, 14 from Baltimore's Inner Harbor, couples like
Bob and Susan Klukas rise each morning and head off in opposite
directions, she toward Baltimore, he toward Washington.
   Their big city loyalties are mixed. They read both the Sun and
the Post, but Susan says they're more apt to visit downtown
Baltimore, which is an easier drive.
   Fellow Columbians Pepper and Allan Fleming, on the other hand,
find themselves attending more social functions in Washington,
where he is an executive at The Washington Times.
   Residents of BaltWash exult in the area's great variety of
goods, services and attractions. You can take in opera at
Washington's Kennedy Center one night and visit the National
Aquarium in Baltimore the next day. When Washington's baseball
Senators and Baltimore's football Colts defected, the sting was
eased by the presence of the pro teams that remained.
   Each of the merging metro areas is becoming more economically
diverse. Washington is known for bureaucracy, but its immediate
suburbs have many high-tech industries. Baltimore's skyline is now
characterized not by smokestacks but office towers.
   Others see a darker side to BaltWash. When Columbia resident
Howard Knudson was growing up in the suburbs west of Baltimore,
there was still plenty of open space. Now, says his wife Jean,
``the traffic is awful, and every square inch has something on it _
houses, townhouses or apartments.''
   BaltWash _ or WashBalt _ is just one part of the emerging
Megalopolis. New York and Philadelphia are meeting in Bucks County,
Pa., Princeton, N.J., and along the highways leading to the
Delaware River. Northern New Jersey, Muller notes, ``is beginning
to fill in. There are no real breaks in the urban landscape.''
   Although the city of Boston has fewer than 600,000 people and
covers only 47 square miles, its metropolitan domain stretches
north into New Hampshire, west to Worcester and south to Rhode
Island. ``Boston has been doing this for so long,'' marvels
Forstall of the Census Bureau. ``It absorbed Cambridge in the 1800s
and never looked back.''
   A continent away, Los Angeles and San Diego are on a collision
course as new housing clusters pop up in the arid expanses between
them. The San Francisco Bay area has become one vast metropolis in
which San Franciscans comprise only 13 percent of the population.
   Specialists debate how far and fast this expansion will go, but
Rutgers urban affairs expert George Sternlieb says one thing is
clear: ``The United States is decentralizing faster than any
society in history.''
   Arthur C. Nelson, a planner at Georgia Tech, says his research
shows that if present trends continue, by 2020 or 2030 almost half
of the mainland could be classified ``exurban'' _ places where
people live on five-, 10- or even 30-acre tracts, and drive fairly
long distances to jobs, social engagements, and other destinations.
   The only land with nothing on or near it, he says, will be
government-owned or ``undevelopable,'' such as mountains and flood
plains.
   Nelson is struck by the speed with which industry is moving
beyond the urban periphery. Once, manufacturers needed to be near
the city's workers and rail lines, but now tax laws and land prices
encourage them to spread out, as long as they remain within a day's
truck ride of the city.
   That requires limited-access highways, of which the nation has
plenty. Federal transportation planner Douglass Lee says one-third
of the interstates carry fewer than 8,000 vehicles a day _ enough
to fill only a two-lane street. For every I-95, busy from Florida
to Maine, there is an I-88, virtually empty from Albany to
Binghamton, N.Y.
   Such routes do not serve American settlement; they spread it.
``Look at the map of the interstate system,'' says Rutgers
historian Robert Fishman, ``and you will see the future of the
American city.''
   In other words, the future lies in such places as Ulster County,
N.Y., and Loudon County, Va., where the city dweller now still can
find the balm of open space.
   The walls seem to be closing in. Gertrude Stein once observed,
from the vantage point of crowded Paris, that ``in the United
States there is more room where nobody is than where everybody is.
That is what makes America what it is.''
   Or was.

<HEAD>Public TV's `Sesame Street' Starts 21st Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the beginning there was Joan Ganz Cooney and
a secretary. Then came Big Bird, Bert and Ernie, the Cookie Monster
and more. They still ask if you can tell them, please, how to get
to ``Sesame Street.''
   Millions of kids _ many of whom now are adults _ know the way
well. The series starts its 21st year today on public TV, having
grown to a staff of 92, including 10 actors and 13 Muppet players.
   For some time now, its audience has been more than American. Its
English-language version is seen in more than 80 countries, and it
has 15 international co-productions, its makers say.
   But it's still aimed at kids aged 1 through 5, particularly
those of poor, inner-city families. And the goal of the one-hour
series is the same now as in 1969: To teach as well as entertain.
   Now costing $12 million annually to make, 80 per cent of that
from commercial licensing of its characters and 20 per cent from
PBS stations, according to its makers, it began with definite
marching orders.
   ``I said, `Let's do a kind of ``Laugh-In'' for kids,' '' recalls
Cooney, the founder and since 1988 chairwoman of the Children's
Television Workshop, maker of ``Sesame Street'' and subsequent
teach-the-tykes shows.
   Her walk to ``Sesame Street'' began when she was a TV consultant
for the Carnegie Corporation, a foundation she joined after writing
a study called ``The Potential Uses of Television in Preschool
Education.''
   When she left to start the show, she told its producers it
should have animation, puppets, a studio, ``and let's not have a
single host. Let's have at least four hosts who will be men, women,
black, white, Hispanic, and so on.''
   Having decreed a pre-Jesse Jackson Rainbow Coalition, she also
wanted each show periodically ``interrupted by `non-commercials' to
teach letters and numbers,'' the basic-education snippets that
still air on the show.
   And the installation of Jim Henson's Muppets, ``was a very
critical decision'' in the show's success, says Cooney, a former
reporter from Phoenix, Ariz., who also has been an NBC publicist
and public TV documentary maker.
   (Interestingly, Henson's Kermit the Frog, never was a regular.
He only was a guest visitor, a CTW spokeswoman says, and he still
hops in now and then.)
   There have been some additions and changes, the biggest of the
latter the expanded range of what Cooney calls ``curriculum aims.''
   Among other things, today's ``Street'' watchers get a taste of
math and science.
   And, Cooney says, they also see teen-agers, a student from
Japan, and people with various disabilities, from Down's syndrome
to hearing and vision problems. There also are segments on emotions.
   ``We've dealt with death, with love and marriage, with pregnancy
and childbirth, with adoption, with anger,'' she says. ``We also
have a goal of teaching children to cooperate ... we consciously
model the acceptance of all people, of treating people kindly.''
   Like Oscar the Grouch, Cooney can get a tad testy, but mainly at
those who say the fast pace of ``Sesame Street'' has led to the MTV
Generation of short attention spans. A bum rap, she submits.
   ``Street'' has longer pieces now, she says, with virtually every
show given a ``plotted story line all the way through'' that is
interrupted only for the educational ``non-commercials.''
   ``We didn't make MTV possible,'' she says. She thought she had
made it clear in many speeches, she adds, that ``we followed
`Laugh-In.' We followed the revolution of TV. We did not create the
revolution in television.''
   A recent development _ the Cable Monster _ and such
child-getting cable channels as Nickelodeon and its ``Bugs Bunny''
and ``Road Runner'' reruns have had an impact on the ``Street''
audience, but only in the afternoon, she says.
   ``Our `Sesame Street' morning audience is not affected, and
that's always been our biggest audience,'' she says. Not so in the
afternoon, when the pre-schoolers' older brothers and sisters come
home from school.
   They tend to take over the set. With cable added to their
viewing choices, the competition is strong, not only against
``Street'' but also CTW's older-kids math show, ``Square One TV''
and its science show, ``3-2-1 Contact.''
   As it starts this season,``Street'' will portray more
teen-agers, and have two new topics _ the environment and
geography. The latter, she says, is because ``we know our children
are not learning geography.''
   The former, already a semiregular story on network newscasts, is
joining the ``Street,'' Cooney says, because ``we feel that for
their survival, the children had better learn about the
environment.''

<HEAD>Kay Lenz Reprises Emmy-Winning Role as AIDS Victim</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

   Kay Lenz wanted to show the special problems
faced by women with AIDS in her role on NBC's ``Midnight Caller,''
and so she talked with those who know best.
   The actress, who won an Emmy for her portrayal of Tina Cassidy,
met with a support group for women with AIDS in San Francisco. The
episode, her third appearance as Jack Killian's former girlfriend,
will be telecast Tuesday. Gary Cole stars as Killian.
   ``We decided to integrate the support group into the script,''
she said. ``They will go on Jack's radio show to inform the public
about the specific problems of women. Everything these actresses
say is true because we got it right from the mouths of the support
group.
   ``The problem is that women don't have the political power that
men have. They don't have the financial power. No matter how
independent a woman is, it's part of a woman's nature to take care
of others. Women with AIDS often have to take care of themselves.
They're not prepared for this. Ninety percent of the women I met
are mothers.''
   Lenz added: ``Men with AIDS deal with friends and lovers. Women
deal with family members because often their children may have it.''
   Lenz won an Emmy last year as best guest actress in a drama
series for her role on ``Midnight Caller.'' She first played the
part in the series' pilot episode.
   The AIDS episode last year caused considerable controversy in
San Francisco, where the series is filmed. Lenz played a
heterosexual woman who is infected by a man. In the first version
of the script, the man is shot down in the streets. Protesters felt
this would make AIDS victims into targets. The script was rewritten
before it was filmed to eliminate the shooting.
   In the current episode Tina is near death and Jack takes her in
and comforts her.
   ``This is a very different show,'' said Lenz. ``We were taking a
chance doing it again. We consulted many people, and the writer,
Stephen Zito, did a lot of research. This show also talks about the
isolation and prejudice attached to AIDS. It comes from ignorance,
and from that comes abandonment and prejudice. If I so much as stub
my toe I want a hug. It would be hard for me to imagine being that
ill and being abandoned.
   ``It's the same kind of attitude people had about leprosy in
biblical times. I hope we can reach the people who turn the channel
whenever AIDS is mentioned ... I had a lot of ignorance about AIDS
myself before I did this role.''
   She said Jack and Tina have a wonderful relationship. ``They
love each other unconditionally,'' she said. ``I love that it shows
that people can have relationships. They may not work. She's lost
her job as a teacher. Jack takes her in. It's a debilitating
disease, but Jack's into denial. He doesn't want to accept that her
life will never be the same again, nor will his.''
   When she was first offered the role last year she talked to the
producers about changing the character's name. Lenz was formerly
married to actor David Cassidy. ``But they kept the name and it
didn't bother me at all.''
   Last summer, Lenz was seen as a police psychiatrist in the USA
Network movie ``Murder By Night.''
   She made her film debut in 1973 as a teen-age hippie in
``Breezy,'' which starred William Holden and was directed by Clint
Eastwood. She was in the miniseries ``Rich Man, Poor Man'' in 1976
and the series ``Rich Man, Poor Man-Book II.''
   Lenz has been a guest star on such shows as ``L.A. Law,''
``Moonlighting,'' ``Hardball,'' ``Hill Street Blues'' and ``Cagney
&amp; Lacey.''
   ``I like doing series work,'' she said. ``I'm always a different
character, although I'm usually a victim. I'm usually dying or a
prostitute or pregnant. It allows you to have another life besides
going to the studio.''

<HEAD>A New Economic Model For the 1990s.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's about time you received some reassuring
economic news, about stability and less volatility and growing
standards of living and other good things, and it comes from a
highly credible source.
   ``The decade of the 1990s stands a very good chance of being the
most prosperous of the century,'' says Jerry L. Jordan, who early
in the 1980s helped produce a U.S. economic forecast that was
remarkably on target.
   Ten years is a long time for any forecast, but Jordan believes
that there are vast and fundamental changes going on in the world
that bode well, not just for Americans but for people everywhere.
   Among the most basic of those changes, he says, is a return to
the market economy versus the corporate state _ a reliance on
trade, on people rather than governments, on what works rather than
ideology.
   Everywhere, he said, people and governments ``are repealing the
1930s.'' The model has changed, he said.
   Jordan is senior vice president and chief economist of Los
Angeles-based First Interstate Economics, part of the First
Interstate Bancorp, which has banking affiliates and licensees in
21 states and the District of Columbia.
   And he is a former member of President Reagan's first Council of
Economic Advisers, helping in that role to produce a report back in
1981 that in some respects became a blueprint for the economy of
the 1980s.
   One brief segment from that economic summary, published as the
``Economic Report of the President'' early in 1982:
   ``A critical element in this outlook is the assumption that
inflationary expectations will, in fact, continue to recede.
   ``If they recede at a relatively fast rate, market rates of
interest will decline significantly, wage demands will continue to
moderate, and the pro-inflationary biases that have developed
throughout the economy over the past decade will quickly
disappear.''
   It was right on the mark, but at the time it was made there were
many doubters.
   A large element in the economic fraternity, for example,
questioned whether an anti-inflationary policy could also be a
growth policy. The 1980s proved it could be. Now that policy is
espoused by the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
   It is for such reasons, and others not stated, that Jordan's
long-range economic forecast for the world is worth noting.
   Early in the forecast is this statement:
   ``The end of more than 40 years of cold war and the victory of
capitalism and democracy over socialism and totalitarianism in the
contest of ideas have set the stage for more efficient use of
global resources.''
   Practicality and common sense are giving way to the recognition
that market economies outperform centrally directed ones. The new
model is the market economy for the simple reason it has shown it
can outperform others.
   It is there for the world to see: Europe, North America and
Japan have become the three large economic and financial powers. A
few years ago it was unimaginable that certain other nations would
follow the model. Now it is so.
   ``In the coming decade, economic rivalries among the North
America, European and Asian enterprises in a global arena will move
us further down the path of economic restructuring.
   ``Deregulation, denationalization, privatization, and tax reform
will continue.
   ``Freer markets mean that natural comparative advantage will
bring about greater productivity at a time when demographic trends
also suggest a more experienced work force in major industrialized
nations.''
   Jordan's conclusion, therefore, is that the new model will be
widely copied, that productivity will grow and that standards of
living will rise more rapidly.
   Meanwhile, global markets for financial and real assets, and
also tradable goods, will constrain the activities of economic
policymakers, who sometimes have been known to succumb to political
influence.
   Instead, the foreign exchange, equity and bond markets will play
a policing role, ``helping to lower the amplitude of fluctuations
in inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, output growth, and
employment.''
   And, he adds, ``this less volatile environment will be conducive
to higher saving and investment.''

<HEAD>Pakistani Forces to Hold Their Largest Military Exercise</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two hundred thousand soldiers of the
Pakistani army and air force are to hold the biggest military
exercises in their 42-year history starting sometime in
mid-December.
   The plan has prompted neighboring India to strengthen its border
force. The two countries have fought three wars since they gained
independence from Britain in 1947 and still are not on the best of
terms.
   Brig. Riaz Ullah, chief of Pakistan's Inter Services Public
Relations Department, said the war games are code-named ``Zarbe
Momin'' _ Urdu for ``the blow of the perfect Moslem'' _ and will
test new tactics and weapons.
   Officials have not disclosed details or announced an exact
starting date.
   Riaz said the games will involve one armored division and seven
infantry divisions in central Pakistan, at least 120 miles from the
eastern border with India.
   The air force will conduct simultaneous operations under the
code name ``Highmark.''
   Indian war games along the frontier in January 1987, called
``Operation Brass Tacks,'' triggered a precautionary mobilization
of Pakistani forces.
   Riaz said the Pakistani exercises will be held in a north-south
corridor defined by the Indus and Chenab rivers in western Punjab
province. However, the area abuts an Indian-controlled section of
the disputed Jammu-Kashmir state.
   ``I don't think these will cause the tensions we saw in 1987,''
Riaz said.
   Dilip Sinha, the first secretary of the Indian Embassy in
Islamabad, said his government agrees.
   ``No, we don't see it as a threat,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, a senior Indian military officer in southern
Jammu-Kashmir said additional Indian troops and tanks were being
stationed along the border to ``deal with any eventuality.''
   The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Indian
security forces in Jammu-Kashmir would increase from 10,000 to
100,000 by the start of the Pakistani maneuvers.
   ``We do not want to be caught unaware in case of any possible
offensive,'' he said.
   Pakistan, which is predominantly Moslem, has fought three
unsuccessful wars with mainly Hindu India since their partition at
the end of British colonial rule in 1947.
   Wars in 1948 and 1965 were over Jammu-Kashmir. In 1971, the two
clashed over the establishment of Bangladesh as an independent
nation in what had been East Pakistan.
   Pakistani and Indian troops still trade artillery fire across
the desolate Siachen Glacier, 21,000 feet up in the Himalayas in
northern Jammu-Kashmir near the Chinese border.
   Pakistan occupies the western third of the 85,000-square-mile
state.
   The two sides are separated by a diagonal cease-fire line drawn
in 1949 that is still monitored by a United Nations military
observer group.
   Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, chief of the Pakistani army, has announced
that foreign military observers, including some from India, will be
invited to watch the exercises.
   ``Our exercise is above board, and not like the secret
preparations India made two years ago to conduct its massive
exercise, `Operation Brass Tacks','' Beg said.

   Almost four years after he stomped out of a
Cabinet meeting and resigned from Margaret Thatcher's government,
Michael Heseltine remains the man voted most likely to succeed her
as Britain's prime minister.
   Despite tumbling opinion polls, Mrs. Thatcher shows no signs of
slowing down after 10 years in power, however, and says she hopes
to lead the Conservatives into one more general election before
retiring.
   Heseltine, who is 56 years old and has a huge personal fortune,
can afford to wait.
   In the meantime, the lean, 6-foot-3 Heseltine with his
movie-star good looks is in big demand as a public speaker.
   He speaks with a slight lisp, suffers from the reading
impairment dyslexia, has great personal charm and, despite the
years out of office, ranks among the half dozen best-known
politicians in Britain.
   His thick mane of blond hair and sometimes swashbuckling
escapades earned him the nickname ``Tarzan,'' and it has stuck. He
once lifted the ceremonial mace in the House of Commons and swung
it around his head, and as defense secretary donned fatigues to try
out new weapons firsthand, usually in front of the television
cameras.
   Other Conservatives in Parliament _ who will eventually select
Mrs. Thatcher's replacement as the party leader _ in particular
want him to speak to their local party gatherings.
   That will one day enable him to ``call in the IOUs,'' the
Spectator magazine said.
   Heseltine has been careful not to attack Mrs. Thatcher directly.
   His usual response when asked whether he wants to succeed her is
the bland observation that there are 350 Conservative members of
Parliament who want to lead the party.
   He also has avoided public recriminations about the dispute over
an obscure helicopter-maker, Westland PLC, which led to his
resignation as defense secretary in January 1986.
   Heseltine favored a European consortium's rescue bid for the
ailing company over the eventual winner, the American Sikorsky
company. But when ordered by Mrs. Thatcher to clear his statements
with the Cabinet, he walked out.
   She, too, was nearly forced out, when the dispute escalated over
the leaking by government officials of documents designed to
discredit Heseltine's argument.
   Heseltine, who is pro-European, while Mrs. Thatcher is combative
toward the European Economic Community, and to the left of her
within the party, indulges in coded criticisms of her policies.
   He has called for more money to be put into inner city and
educational reforms and has said Mrs. Thatcher's property tax,
which taxes individuals rather than households, will become known
as an unpopular ``Tory tax.''
   He said the government's last interest rate increase was
necessary to combat inflation, but he told a recent luncheon of
American journalists that ``whether we should have got into that
situation is really the issue.''
   At the Conservative Party's annual conference, he told the
government ``not to let the medicine drag out, dissipating our
economic strength and dispersing our political support.''
   Perhaps most significantly, Heseltine believes Britain should
join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System,
which limits swings in nine other European currencies.
   Opinion polls indicate Heseltine is the voters' choice to
replace Mrs. Thatcher as the Tory leader.
   A National Opinion Poll conducted for the newspaper The Mail on
Sunday said 31 percent of 1,043 voters questioned believe Heseltine
would be the best person to succeed her. The next closest candidate
was Sir Geoffrey Howe, the deputy prime minister, with 17 percent.
   British Broadcasting Corp. television surveyed Conservative
lawmakers and found 22 percent would like Heseltine to succeed Mrs.
Thatcher, followed by 14 percent for party Chairman Kenneth Baker.
   Heseltine was born in Swansea, Wales, the son of an army
officer, and educated at a private boys' school and Oxford
University.
   At Oxford, he told friends he would be a millionaire by the age
of 30 and then go into politics. He made a fortune in the
publishing business before being elected to Parliament in 1966.
   He and his family own 51 percent of Haymarket Press, and British
news reports estimate he is worth 60 million pounds ($94 million).
He divides his time, with his wife, Anne, between an 800-acre
estate north of Oxford and an elegant townhouse in London's
exclusive Belgravia neighborhood. They have two grown daughters and
a son.

<HEAD>U.S. Farmers Can't Keep Up With Oatmania</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health-conscious Americans are on an oats kick
and U.S. farmers aren't keeping up with the demand.
   Oat bran has become ``a buzz word,'' says Agriculture Department
nutritionist Ruth H. Matthews. ``Everybody's got to have oat bran.
You've got to have oat bran in this and that. I've seen potato
chips with oat bran, and popcorn and everything else.''
   U.S. oats production rebounded this year from a drought-level
1988 output of 219 million bushels _ the lowest since the
Agriculture Department began records in 1866 _ to 371 million
bushels this year.
   But that won't be enough, and the United States will wind up in
1989-90 importing around 55 million bushels of oats. Last year,
when drought shriveled yields, imports jumped to 68 million bushels.
   Even before the current craze, the United States was importing
oats from Canada, Sweden, Finland and Argentina. Now the demand is
greater than ever.
   It was only a few years ago that medical researchers found
health benefits in foods rich in fiber. Combined with a reduction
in the consumption of fats, they can help guard against colon
cancers and high levels levels of serum cholesterol.
   Oats, long-recognized as a nutritious food, gained further
dietary fame as researchers found that certain kinds of fiber _
those that are soluble in water _ are even more effective.
   ``If you cook oatmeal in a pan, you know how sticky it is and
how difficult it is to clean,'' Mrs. Matthews said. ``Well, that
sticky product is the soluble fiber.''
   Oat bran, which is extracted from the oat seed, is even more
concentrated in fiber content.
   When farms were powered mostly by horses and mules _ a record of
25 million in the U.S. inventory in the early 1920s _ farmers grew
more than 40 million acres of oats each year.
   As recently as 1954, oats were harvested from 40.6 million
acres. But by the mid-1960s the crop was down to less than 20
million acres, and in the late 1970s dropped to below 10 million.
   Last year's drought cut the harvest to 5.6 million acres. This
year's harvest rose to more than 6.8 million acres, primarily a
result of improved weather in some key areas and relatively high
market prices.
   A major reason for the slide in oats production, however, has
been the federal crop program that makes barley and other grains
more profitable to produce.
   Oats are grown in most states but are concentrated in the North
Central region, including the Dakotas, Minnesota, Iowa and Nebraska.
   Since 1982, according to USDA economists Linwood A. Hoffman and
Mark Ash, government programs ``have created a competitive
disadvantage for oats'' by assigning a common acreage base to oats
and barley.
   Under the price support apparatus, farmers simply had a better
financial deal with barley instead of oats.
   Finally, Hoffman and Ash say in a recent analysis, Congress in
1985 set up the Conservation Reserve Program so that farmers could
take erosion-prone land from crop production for 10 years.
   ``In many instances, this land was planted to oats prior to
entry into the program,'' they said.
   Oats is not a kingpin crop in the United States when compared
with some others. In pre-drought 1987, for example, the value of
oats production ranked 16th among major U.S. field crops at $606
million. By comparison, corn was $14 billion; soybeans, $11.3
billion; hay, $9 billion; and wheat, $5.5 billion.
   Despite the growth in supermarket products, oats is still
basically a livestock feed grain, with only the higher-quality
portion going to food processors. About 300 million bushels are
expected to be used as feed in 1989-90, compared with around 110
million bushels as food and seed.
   Pete Riley of the USDA Economic Research Service said oats
prices averaged about $1.52 a bushel in the first five months of
the crop's current marketing year, which began June 1.
   The average for the full 1988-89 marketing year was $2.61 a
bushel, up from $1.56 in 1987-88, reflecting the drought-year
market bulge.
   Congress is putting together new legislation to replace the 1985
farm law that expires next year. One of the items under review is
the oats program and how more U.S. production can be encouraged.
   David L. Senter, national director of the American Agricultural
Movement, said the best way to avoid importing more oats ``is just
to improve the program so that farmers can economically afford to
grow 'em'' again.
   Senter said that when the current farm law was designed in 1985
there was virtually no concern about oats. Lawmakers, he said,
``got caught up in writing programs'' for other crops and oats
production ``did not receive the attention it should have.''

<HEAD>Memories and Music of `The Fess' Linger On</HEAD>

   Henry Roeland Byrd had a right to sing the
blues.
   The thin, old man with the shy grin and the dark glasses known
as Professor Longhair, or `Fess' for short, had plenty of hard
times _ songs sold for grocery money, music stolen, royalties not
paid, gigs worked for peanuts.
   He also had a way of pounding it out on a piano that started
feet moving, hearts thumping, fingers tapping and a whole bunch of
musicians searching for a new way of making music.
   ``It was a swing-stride piano,'' said pianist George Winston.
``He did it like no one else. He was influential on people who
didn't even know he was influencing them. He influenced Fats
Domino, Allen Toussaint, Dr. John. He influenced people who
influenced people who influenced people.''
   Almost a decade after Professor Longhair's death in 1980,
Winston's Dancing Cat label has re-released ``Rock N' Roll Gumbo,''
a Professor Longhair album originally released in France.
   ``House Party New Orleans Style,'' an LP recorded in 1971 and
released in 1987, won a Grammy that year.
   ``I was on a plane from Los Angeles to Orlando and they had this
movie on called `Dead Poets Society' and I couldn't believe it,''
said Dr. John, the performer generally credited with carrying on
Professor Longhair's music to the greatest degree.
   ``Fess' `Hey Little Girl' was on the soundtrack. I looked around
the plane and there were people just grooving in their seats to the
music and I said, `Oh, yeah, how about this.'''
   Dr. John and Winston both performed regular benefits for
Professor Longhair's widow before her death in October. The
benefits provided Alice Walton Byrd with an income during the years
after her husband's death.
   ``They were a wonderful way to help her. It was as if her
husband was still taking care of her through his music. And, of
course, it was a great way to celebrate the man and his music for
everyone involved,'' said Allison Minor Kaslow, who managed the
singer for the last years of his life and still administers
Professor Longhair Music Publishing Co.
   ``The man has been dead for 10 years and it's like he's still
alive. I hear his music more now than ever,'' said Connie Atkinson,
editor of Wavelength, a New Orleans music magazine.
   She said his influence on rhythm and blues and rock, which was
limited to New Orleans for years, has been extended worldwide now,
with his albums in constant demand in Europe.
   ``I don't like the term cult because that has religious
overtones, but that's about what it is. We call it the `Fess
Underground,''' said Kaslow.
   In 1950, ``Baldhead,'' Longhair's only recording to make the
charts, was released by Mercury. Later that year he signed with
Atlantic, and in 1953 recorded ``Tipitina,'' which years later
became one of his most famous songs. Initially, it had only local
success and soon the song and the Professor were both forgotten.
   In 1971, Quinten Davis and Kaslow were working on the second New
Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. Davis, who had some of
Professor Longhair's old 45s and 78s, had hooked Kaslow on the
music and they decided to try to get Longhair to perform.
   ``We heard he went into a record shop and Quint would drop in
there all the time and ask for Fess. One day he went in and there
he was sweeping the floor,'' Kaslow said.
   He had been supporting himself and his family at odd jobs and by
gambling, Davis recalled, and although he was physiclly in bad
shape, he had not lost anything as a performer.
   ``When he went on stage at the Jazz Fest it was a real cliche.
He started playing and all the musicians on the other stages quit
playing and came to hear him,'' Davis said.
   ``He was an old man, in bad shape when Allison and Quint found
him,'' Atkinson remembered. ``He couldn't walk, couldn't breath
well, his teeth were gone, but the longer he played, the younger he
got. The last time I saw him _ shortly before he died in 1980 _ he
ran over and jumped up on the stage.''
   Professor Longhair became a regular at the New Orleans Jazz
Fest, and by the mid-1970s played festivals in Newport, Chicago and
Europe. In 1976, he cut a new record, ``Live on the Queen Mary,''
at a party for Paul McCartney, who was an admirer. Longhair and his
band toured North America in 1979.
   In New Orleans, Tipitina's, a small bar near the Mississippi
River, became his regular home when he was not on the road. The
bar, which featured live music nightly, has retained its reputation
for rhythm and blues and jazz performances. A bust of the Fess sits
near the entrance, and fans are trying to create a Longhair Park in
the boulevard outside.
   In a city known for it's music, where distinctive styles produce
a sound unique to the region, Professor Longhair was one of a kind.
   ``He was influenced by the blues, and Cuban rumba music and New
Orleans Street music, but he went beyond all of those,'' Winston
said.
   ``He's been labeled blues, but he never considered himself as
playing one kind of music,'' Dr. John said.
   Professor Longhair, who developed his sense of rhythm through
tap dancing as a young man, translated that to the piano with a
boogie-woogie stride, and a sizzling left hand, then added calypso,
merengue and rhumba beats to old-time New Orleans rhythm and blues
and rock 'n' roll.
   ``He came from Bogalusa, out in the country, so he didn't grow
up with the usual New Orleans music background. He didn't read
music. He listened to the Spanish, the brass bands, the African,
the blues, all of it, and then put it together in his own way,''
Kaslow said.
   ``He had a wild and untamed way of playing. In the same way Bach
had inventions, Professor Longhair had five or six inventions that
changed the piano forever. You could build a life on any of them,''
said Allen Toussaint.
   Toussaint, a prolific songwriter known for his funky piano and
intricate arrangements, credits the professor for much of his style.
   ``I've loved him all my life and copied all of his recordings as
much as I could. His influence is enormous. I hear it second,
third, fourth hand on people who don't even know he influenced
them,'' he said.
   The ``Fess Underground'' shows every sign of growing and of
going above ground. And Dr. John says there's a good reason the
music will last:
   ``It was very hip in the '40s and '50s and '60s when he was
writing it, and its very hip now. It will be hip a long time.''

   Few stars remain from Hollywood's Golden Age.
Clark Gable, Cary Grant, Bette Davis _ all long gone. The survivors
_ James Stewart, Katharine Hepburn, Myrna Loy _ rarely make movies
anymore.
   But one popular collection of screen idols has endured, looks
undiminished by age: Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy. How old are
they? Only their illustrators know for sure. But they've been
around more than 50 years, and should last at least 50 more.
   Their studio is intact as well. Hollywood's happiest endings
still come from Walt Disney Pictures. Nothing like a cartoon to
stop time, and even pull it back a little. Only at Disney are glass
slippers, handsome princes and magic wands accepted without
reservation.
   The latest animated spectacular from the Disney machine is ``The
Little Mermaid,'' a feature that's bound to generate more big bucks
for the highly successful studio. Disney's last animated feature,
``Oliver and Company,'' has grossed about $50 million. A re-release
this year of ``Peter Pan'' has pulled in $30 million. Although
Disney officials wouldn't disclose how much ``The Little Mermaid''
cost to make, those in the industry put it between $10 million and
$15 million.
   Cynics better stay away from ``The Little Mermaid.'' They'll
never believe this one, something about a beautiful, blue-eyed
mermaid falling in love with a handsome prince, and goodness
defeating the evil sea witch.
   Of course, cynics wouldn't have sat through ``Snow White and the
Seven Dwarfs,'' ``Cinderella'' or ``Bambi,'' either. And as Disney
Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg explained, ``The Little Mermaid'' takes
a lot of its glitter from those golden oldies.
   ``I wanted us to make a film that had the look and feel and the
entertainment and lushness of `Pinocchio,''' he said in a recent
interview.
   ``If you talk with writers, directors, animators, designers,
effects people, layout artists _ across the board in this movie _
all the refreneces that I made, the goals I kept setting for them
were, `Can't we do something that is like `Pinocchio.'''
   ``The Little Mermaid'' is rated, naturally, ``G,'' for general
audiences. That's how Katzenberg sees it. Say the film is for
children and he'll grimace, his eyes widening, the jaw stretching.
Family entertainment means the entire family, he insists.
   ``They're fantastic stories, they're not children's stories.
They're great stories and they're made for the kid inside everyone
of us as opposed to made for children; there's a real distinction
there.
   ``We try to make it very intelligent, very smart, very
sophisticated. There is very little about the film that is
cartoonish. Even when it's animal characters that are speaking,
you'll notice it's very sophisticated.''
   Ask about romance, action, drama, and Katzenberg will talk
strategy, borrowing a page from film mogul Samuel Goldwyn, who
insisted the world needed laughter when his competitors were
serious, and lamented the disappearance of ``messages'' when others
turned out comedies.
   But animation belongs to Disney. Who would want to compete with
``The Ugly Ducking,'' ``Peter Pan,'' ``Fantasia'' and dozens of
others?
   It's a tradition Katzenberg wouldn't dream of touching, although
a little retouching doesn't hurt. For ``The Little Mermaid,'' based
on the Hans Christian Andersen story, that means the richest
colors; the brightest melodies, courtesy of ``Little Shop of
Horrors'' composer Alan Menken; and the most vivid illustrations,
often resembling the performers _ Buddy Hackett and Pat Carroll
among them _ who provide the voices.
   Nothing is left to chance. Everyone has to rehearse, even
mermaids.
   ``There's not a sequence in the film in which there are human
characters not staged and shot on film and used as references in
order to make sure that the human characters moved very much like
people move.
   ``We built an eight-foot tank, put a lady in it and had her swim
around a lot to get the sense of movement and hair _ how it moves
through the water, and the sense of weightlessness.''
   ``The Little Mermaid'' is just the beginning. Katzenberg talks
of a ``renaissance'' for Disney animation. So get ready to see
those ageless stars dusted off again. When the studio needed a lead
for its version of ``The Prince and the Pauper,'' to be released
late in 1990, Mickey Mouse got the call. Minnie Mouse, Goofy,
Donald Duck and Pluto will co-star.
   Also in the works are ``Beauty and the Beast''; ``An Arabian
Night,'' the story of Aladdin and his magic lamp; ``Swan Lake'';
and ``King of the Jungle.''
   And why bother with surveying the public. Numbers, box-office
numbers, speak louder than words.
   Seeing is make-believing has always been Disney's unofficial
motto.
   ``I want people going out of this movie saying: `God, I haven't
been affected like this, I haven't seen anything like this for
years, music that much fun and that much part of the movie,'''
Katzenberg said.
   ``It's a musical, it's a love story, it's emotional. You feel
very sad for this girl who loses everything, happy for her at the
end. What you're hoping to do is get a reaction. Each movie looks
for something different; some make you laugh, some make you cry.
Each one is a different thrill.''

   Wholesale prices rose 0.4 percent in October
as the biggest spurt in food costs in 22 months offset the positive
effects from moderating energy prices, the government reported.
   The 0.4 percent October rise in the Labor Department's Producer
Price Index on Thursday was down from a 0.9 percent September
increase. Some economists predicted the news will continue to
improve in coming months as a slowing economy takes more pressure

said the central bank needs to reduce inflation to about 3 percent
in 1990 and he expects to meet that goal in the first half of the
year.
   Inflation has been falling since the Fed began tightening credit
in 1988 to slow the economy. The Fed began easing credit in May and
nudged short-term interest rates lower earlier this week. Angell
made his comments Thursday.

   Farmers are completing a corn harvest
estimated at a three-year high of 7.59 billion bushels, up 54
percent from last year's drought-reduced crop and up 2 percent from
the forecast a month ago, the Agriculture Department said.
   Drought reduced the 1988 corn crop to 4.92 billion bushels, the
department said Thursday. In October, the department estimated this
year's production at 7.45 billion bushels, a 51 percent increase

enough and suggested a total ban on one form of the market
strategy: index arbitrage.
   Regan, head of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. before becoming Treasury
secretary under Ronald Reagan, on Thursday was part of a panel of
investment company executives that called for restraining program
trading, but split over what action Congress should take.
   ``The problem we're addressing is volatility, not the program
trading problem,'' Philip J. Purcell, chairman of Dean Witter

   Federal Reserve Board Governor Wayne D. Angell
says the central bank needs to reduce inflation to about 3 percent
in 1990 and he expects to meet that goal in the first half of the
year.
   Inflation has been falling since the Fed began tightening credit
in 1988 to slow the economy. The Fed began easing credit in May and
nudged short-term interest rates lower earlier this week.
   But Angell's comments, made to reporters after a speech Thursday
to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, appeared
to indicate the Fed might not be prepared to cut interest rates
further in the immediate future.
   Angell told the accountants he supports a pending House bill
that would mandate that the central bank eliminate inflation by
1994. Fed Chairman Allan Greenspan endorsed the proposal last month
in an appearance before the House Banking monetary policy
subcommittee.
   Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index had dropped to
an annual rate of 4.3 percent by September, a level Angell told
reporters still was too high.
   The bill calling for zero inflation was introduced by the
monetary policy subcommittee chairman, Rep. Neal L. Smith, D-N.C.
It does not include any penalty for failing to reach that level.
   It was supported at a subcommittee hearing Thursday by former
Fed Gov. Lyle E. Gramley, who called it a ``desirable'' statement
of priorities for monetary policy. He added, ``I would not hold out
hope that its passage would greatly simplify the achievement of a
noninflationary economy.''
   The subcommittee also is considering a bill introduced by Reps.
Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., and Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., designed to reduce
the independence of the Fed.
   That bill would require the Fed's policy-setting Open Market
Committeeto meet three times a year with the Treasury secretary and
the president's budget director and chief economic adviser, allow
the president to appoint the Fed chairman a year after taking
office, immediately disclose any changes in monetary policy
targets, permit Government Accounting Office audits of Fed
operations and require publication of the Fed budget.
   The Hamilton-Dorgan bill has been criticized as ``politicizing''
the central bank but Hamilton described it at Thursday's hearing as
a ``responsible way'' to make the independent Fed accountable to
the public.
   Gramley, however, said he generally opposes the Hamilton-Dorgan
bill because ``the Federal Reserve's independence from the
administrative branch needs to be preserved.''
   James Tobin, a Nobel laureate and economics professor at Yale
University, endorsed several of the Hamilton-Dorgan proposals
including presidential appointment of the Fed chairman a year after
taking office. Tobin said he would expand administration
participation in Fed policy-making to all meetings of the Open
Market Committee.
   But he rejected mandating immediate announcement of policy
decisions and said terms of the central bank governors should be
reduced from 14 years to 10, and board membership cut from seven to
five.
   Tobin also recommended that the president name the heads of the
district Fed banks, subject to Senate confirmation. The district
presidents now are selected by the directors of the member banks,
subject to approval by the Fed governors, and alternate as members
of the Open Market Committee.

<HEAD>Administration Rejects Price-Support Boost For Barley, Oats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has rejected as too
costly proposals to boost government price supports for barley and
oats, which have been in declining production despite increased
consumer demand.
   Health concerns have triggered consumer demand for cereal
grains, particulary for oat products, including oatmeal, bran and
flour.
   As a result of smaller harvests in recent years, the United
States has had to import oats from Canada and other foreign
suppliers to meet demand.
   Bills Congress is considering would cost the government $130
million in higher payments for barley and an additional,
unspecified amount for oats, said Keith Bjerke, administrator of
the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   Selected increases in target prices for barley and oats could
``lead to detrimental effects for producers and consumers of other
program crops and lead to expanded federal outlays,'' Bjerke told a
House Agriculture subcommittee.
   Target prices are goals set in the government's crop programs to
help determine direct subsidies to farmers when market prices are
down.
   Bjerke said Thursday the Agriculture Department is taking some
steps to stimulate oats production, which has not kept pace with
the demand generated by the grain's reported health benefits,
forcing the United States to import nearly 30 percent of its
production.
   Congress should wait to change target prices until it rewrites
the government's multiyear farm program next year, Bjerke said.
   Producers claim subsidies for barley and oats are relatively low
in comparison to price supports for wheat, corn and sorghum. The
cost of producing barley and oats actually exceeds the price
farmers can get, one economist testified.
   ``Farmers have had strong incentives to produce crops that have
high target prices relative to costs,'' said Martin Abel, who
represented the National Association of Barley Growers.
   ``Conversely, they have had much less incentive to produce crops
with low target prices relative to costs, namely barley and oats.''
   The subsidy for barley is too low because the Agriculture
Department calculates it by combining the market prices for malting
barley and feed barley, which brings up to 50 cents less per
bushel, producers say.
   Lagging oats production is blamed both on low target prices and
planting restrictions in the farm program that discourage farmers
from switching to oats from other crops.
   In addition, the Conservation Reserve Program, which pays
farmers not to plant crops on highly erodible land, has taken a
disproportionate amount of oats acerage out of production, said
John Bollingberg, a Bremen, N.D., farmer representing the American
Oat Association.
   The U.S. imported 60 million bushels of oats, or 28 percent of
its production, last year during the drought, he said in testimony
prepared for the committee. While U.S. oat production is expected
to rebound slightly this year, imports are still expected to reach
40 million bushels, he said.
   The government does not expect to make any deficiency payments
for oats next year because market prices are expected to be higher
than the $1.45 target price, Bjerke said.

   Viacom Broadcasting, a unit of the entertainment and media giant
Viacom International Inc., already owns and operates five
television and nine radio stations in various markets and has
purchases of two other radio stations pending.
   Command Communications was formed by Carl C. Brazell Jr. and

   The sale, announced Thursday, leaves Command with KRLD-AM in

Sillerman Companies has extensive interests in other radio
broadcasting companies as well as a non-voting stake in Command.
   Henry S. Schleiff, chairman and chief executive of Viacom's

three stations were made under Viacom's strategy of buying
properties in major radio markets nationwide.
   Bill Figenshu, president of Viacom Broadcasting's radio

format changes in any of the three stations.
   The purchase was expected to be completed later this year,
pending approval by the Federal Communications Commission and the
boards of the respective companies.

   Police on Thursday charged 10 men and two leading
British investment firms with fraud in a $1.3 billion stock sale
connected with Blue Arrow PLC's takeover of U.S.-based Manpower
Inc. two years ago.
   The British employment-service company's takeover of the much
larger Manpower, which has its headquarters in Milwaukee, Wis.,
created the world's largest temporary employment company.
   The charges apparently are related to the investment firm County
Natwest's failure to properly disclose a 13.4 percent Blue Arrow
holding it was left with after a sale of Blue Arrow shares flopped.
   County Natwest helped arrange the sale of Blue Arrow shares to
existing Blue Arrow shareholders to finance the takeover of
Manpower.
   The 10 defendants were charged with conspiracy to defraud and
were to appear before City of London Magistrates Court today,
police said. An unspecified number of them were arrested Thursday
and later released.
   The City of London is the city's financial district.
   The investment firms Natwest Investment Bank Ltd., County
Natwest Ltd. and UBS Phillips and Drew Securities Ltd. also were
charged with conspiracy to defraud, as well as with conspiracy to
contravene Section 13 of the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act
1958, police said.
   County Natwest and UBS Phillips and Drew officials declined
comment.
   The police, and the Serious Fraud Squad, a central governmental
unit charged with investigating financial crime, have been
conducting an investigation into the case, which is known as the
Blue Arrow affair.
   The investigation began after the Department of Trade and
Industry released a report in July on events related to the sale of
Blue Arrow shares.
   The report severely criticized National Westminster PLC, its
County Natwest unit and Union Bank of Switzerland's UBS Phillips
and Drew for their conduct.
   When the $1.3 billion sale of Blue Arrow shares failed, County
Natwest didn't disclose its 13.4-percent stake in Blue Arrow for
three months, in apparent violation of British regulations.
   A series of top-level resignations followed publication of the
trade department's report, including the chairman of National
Westminster, Lord Boardman, and three of his main board directors.
   Those charged Thursday from County Natwest were: Charles
Villiers, former chairman; Jonathan Cohen, former chief executive;
Stephen Clark, current financial director; David Reed, former
executive director, in charge of the corporate advisory department;
and Nick Wells, formerly a senior director in that department.
   Those charged from UBS Phillips and Drew were: Christopher
Stainforth, former executive director of corporate finance; Martin
Gibbs, former director of corporate director of finance; and
Timothy Brown and Paul Smallwood, directors in the firm's equity
sales division.
   Also charged was Alan Michael Keat, a partner in the law firm
Travers Smith Braithwaite and Co., which advised County Natwest in
the share sale.

   Investment company executives agree that
computer-driven program trading helps fuel wild swings in the stock
market, but they're split on what Congress should do about it.
   Former Treasury Secretary Donald Regan told a House panel
Thursday that a bill to limit computer-driven stock trading doesn't
go far enough and suggested a ban on one form of the market
strategy.
   He targeted index arbitrage, in which speculators try to take
advantage of inconsistencies between the stock and futures markets
by simultaneously buying in one while selling in the other.
   Critics claim index arbitrage widens stock price swings and
drives small investors out of the market.
   ``There is no good index arbitrage effect upon the market. The
volatility up is just as bad as the volatility down,'' said Michael
Roth, an executive vice president with USAA Investment Management
Company of San Antonio, Texas.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the
telecommunications and finance subcommittee, plans to introduce
legislation to restrict program trading during times of extreme
market turbulence.
   But Regan, the former head of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said, ``This
is more of a partial solution to the problem and, if enacted, may
not cure it.''
   He said the problem was stock index futures _ futures contracts
tied to the performance of large groups of stocks _ which have
``commoditized our stock market.''
   Regan suggested doing away with the commodity aspects of index
futures ``in order to lessen volatility, or we should make the
stock market derivatives have the same rules as stocks.''
   The panel members agreed that market volatility scares investors
out of the market and that makes it harder for U.S. companies to
raise capital through the sale of stock.
   And if you do that, said Lawrence Zicklin, managing partner of
the New York invesment firm Neuberger &amp; Berman, ``you reduce their
ability to compete'' with foreign corporations.
   Most of Wall Street's large investment houses recently have
revised their policies on index arbitrage.
   And the New York Stock Exchange has called on large,
institutional investors to curb program trading while ways to
handle the bursts of stock orders it generates are considered.
   But money managers who oversee pension funds and other
institutional investors, who do not belong to the NYSE, said they
would continue to use index arbitrage.
   Markey's plan would grant emergency powers to the Securities and
Exchange Commission to temporarily halt program trading during
extreme market turbulence.
   Markey is seeking to amend the Stock Market Reform Act of 1989,
which is pending before the subcommittee.
   That bill calls for giving the SEC authority to halt trading in
market emergencies; requiring reports of large securities and
options trades; and rules for assessing the financial stability of
the parent companies of broker-dealers.
   Markey said the subcommittee would vote Tuesday on passing the
bill along to the full House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   A similar bill that has no program trading ban is pending in the
Senate.
   But Philip J. Purcell, chairman of Dean Witter Financial
Services Inc., said the real problem is volatility, not program
trading.
   Although his firm has halted index arbitrage for customer
accounts, Purcell said, ``The public should recognize that any
steps taken to curb program trading will not cure volatility.''

<HEAD>NYSE President: Exchanges Looking at Possible Program Trading Abuses</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Stock Exchange has begun ``major
investigations'' into potential violations involving computerized
stock trading strategies, exchange President John J. Phelan Jr.
announced.
   Phelan said Thursday the probe involves trading in both the New
York securities and Chicago futures exchanges and focuses on an
illegal financial market strategy called ``front-running.''
   After a speech to corporate investor relations officials, Phelan
also said he was not concerned about reports that large
institutions have not scaled back their program trading despite a
Big Board request for voluntary restraint.
   The exchange Thursday also defended its method for measuring the
amount of monthly program trading after Business Week magazine
asserted the Big Board calculation erroneously doubles the figure.
   The NYSE last month instituted a series of reforms amid a
growing outrcy by some securities firms and lawmakers that a
computerized trading strategy known as index arbitrage had made the
market more volatile.
   Phelan said the NYSE and other regulators were examining the
possibility of ``front-running'' or other manipulative tactics in
the program trading strategy known as index arbitrage.
   In front-running, a broker buys or sells stocks or futures for
its own account ahead of a customer's order, using the knowledge
that the customer order is likely to affect prices in the market.
   Exchange officials confirmed that the study includes the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade. Officials are
looking at sharp price swings in the market last July that may be
related to program trading.
   ``There's a lot of concern that the type of trading actually
going on creates a lot of opportunity for abuse,'' NYSE spokeswoman
Sharon Gamsin said. ``We have not necessarily identified specific
situations we are looking at.''
   The Big Board defines program trading as any order for the
simultaneous purchase or sale of 15 or more stocks valued at more
than $1 million. Index arbitrage involves rapid trading of stocks
and stock-index futures traded in Chicago to profit from momentary
price discrepancies between the two.
   Index arbitrage defenders say the strategy helps stabilize
trading by linking the two markets, pulling prices closer together.
   Morris Markovitz, an stock-index futures trader at the
commodities firm Mercury Management Associates Inc., said possible
program trading manipulation should not be used as another excuse
to criticize the strategy.
   ``When you put poison in a cup of cocoa you don't ban the cocoa,
you ban the poison,'' he said.
   Business Week contends in its Nov. 20 issue, released Thursday
to the media, that the NYSE's method of calculating program trading
volume exaggerates the total. The Big Board divides program stock
sales and purchases by total volume, whereas trading by specialists
is divided by twice the total volume.
   NYSE spokesman Richard Torrenzano said the calculation accounts
for differences in the two types of trading. He said the exchange
has made public its methodology monthly since it began calculating
program trading volume in July 1988.
   ``The numbers we have published for the last 18 months are
correct,'' Torrenzano said. ``It appears Business Week doesn't like
the methodolgy we use. That doesn't make the numbers wrong.''
   Among its reforms, the NYSE requested that its member firms ask
customers to refrain from all types of program trading unless it
would have a ``stabilizing influence in the market;'' installed
slowdowns when the market declines rapidly; and limited access of
program trades to the NYSE's computerized order system.
   But market players said that large institutions show no signs of
abating their program trading. Stock-index funds such as Wells
Fargo Investment Advisers, Bankers Trust Co. and Mellon Capital
Management are among the largest stock-index arbitrage clients on
Wall Street.
   Phelan said he is not yet concerned because the voluntary
pullbacks were designed for periods of volatility.
   ``We're just trying to get in in,'' Phelan said after a speech
to the National Investor Relations Institute. ``We haven't hit
those periods of market illiquidity we talked about.''
   The impact of the battle over program trading should become
noticeable within two weeks, when the NYSE issues its first weekly
report on total program trading activity. Until now, the exchange
issued monthly figures.
   Debate over program trading intensified after the Oct. 13
190-point market drop and a rapid 80-point rise on Oct. 24. Major
Wall Street brokerages dropped index arbitrage and investors and
corporations lashed out at the strategy as scaring away individual
investors.
   Phelan said he supports legislation to help control volatility
but slowing the market down is preferable to banning program
trading _ which only Congress could do.
   ``There are millions of gallons of alcoholic beverages produced
in this country. That doesn't mean you have to be sloshed every
day,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Philippines President Corazon Aquino isn't
exactly hawking J.C. Penney Co. wares today, but the nation's
fourth-largest retailer is enjoying the attention brought by her
interest in its ``Festival of the Philippines'' promotion.
   Mrs. Aquino is scheduled for an afternoon tour of an exhibit
hall featuring some of the $110 million worth of Filipino products
Penney will market during the promotion next May.
   Since learning of the Texas-based retailer's plans, she has been
anxious to be involved in the campaign, said W. Barger Tygart,
Penney's director of merchandising.
   Penney has invited about 2,000 people to the reception at a posh
Dallas hotel. Joining Penney Chairman William G. Howell as hosts
will be multimillionaire developer Trammell Crow and Texas Gov.
Bill Clements.
   On Saturday, Mrs. Aquino, who is in the United States on a
political visit, will tour a Penney store in an upscale north
Dallas mall it anchors along with such stores as Neiman-Marcus and
Lord &amp; Taylor.
   The ``Festival of the Philippines'' is the latest international
promotion for Penney. Such events are becoming annual affairs for
the company, with previous promotions centering on Great Britain,
India and Italy.
   The Filipino promotion also reflects the new emphasis at Penney:
apparel and soft home furnishings.
   In 1983, Penney began eliminating automotive, electronics and
hard goods from its stores, a decision that cost $1.5 billion in
revenue, Howell said, but put the company ``more in sync with what
American consumers expect at J.C. Penney's.''
   ``J.C. Penney is truly positioned as the middle income
department store of the country,'' said Thomas Tashjian, a retail
analyst at Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles.
   ``The company is the largest occupant of mall space in the
country and what it has done is it has adjusted its merchandising
strategy to serve that mall customer,'' who is mainly female and
mainly looking for clothes, Tashjian said.
   Although founder James Cash Penney's original Golden Rule stores
focused on soft goods, ``they had taken a detour for a time into
hard goods ... when they saw Sears being very successful in hard
goods,'' Tashjian said.
   Apparel now accounts for 82 percent of Penney sales, with
women's apparel at 42 percent of total sales. In 1981, apparel was
63 percent, with women's at 30 percent. Home and leisure goods have
fallen from 37 percent in 1981 to 18 percent last year.
   Howell has predicted that by 1993, overall apparel sales will
make up 72 percent of total sales.
   Despite an industry-wide slump in apparel sales, Penney sales so
far this year have rebounded to $10.13 billion through Oct. 28, an
8.2 percent increase from the same time last year.
   With the busy holiday season upcoming, the company already has
reached 68 percent of last year's retail sales, and 66 percent of
its record 1987 sales.
   And when third-quarter earnings are released Tuesday, ``I don't
think we're going to disappoint anybody,'' Howell said in an
interview this week at the company's temporary headquarters in
Addison, a corporate suburb on Dallas's northern border to which it
moved from New York last year before it settles in nearby Plano.
Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.40 to $1.50 per share
compared with last year's $1.16.
   ``They're doing very well,'' said Jeffrey Edelman, a retail
analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York. ``Last year
they were cleaning out the store of merchandise they didn't want,
and this year they're filling it up with merchandise they want.''
   Led by Howell, analysts said, Penney's management has become
aggressive and pays more attention to market research than some of
its competitors. Howell frequently recites those findings in
explaining his company's operations.
   ``We're going to change, because the American consumer is going
to change,'' he said. But he believes Penney already is ahead of
its competition in the race for future sales.
   ``We have faith that we have a competitive advantage, that J.C.
Penney will be one of the survivors, with a triple threat of
retail, catalog and television,'' Howell said.
   While about 80 percent of Penney's sales come from in-store
purchases, its Shop Television Network on cable TV presents
well-known celebrities hawking J.C. Penney products. Its
shop-by-mail catalog provides the rest of its sales.

<HEAD>Luxury Train Completes Inaugural Run</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also on general news wires.</HEAD>

   The nation's first luxury passenger train in
decades rolled into town three minutes late, but its owner said the
enterprise wouldn't leave him a dollar short.
   ``This is kind of like the country club without the golf
course,'' said William Spann. ``If this doesn't work, the message
will be loud and clear: Americans don't care how they travel. I bet
a considerable sum of money they do.''
   The American-European Express completed its 17-hour inaugural
run to Chicago from Washington, D.C., on Thursday.
   The fur- and silk-clad guests rode in grand style by invitation,
but regular passengers will pay a grand and more for the privilege
of sinking into overstuffed chairs in the lush club car and tucking
in seven-course meals served from plates that ring when flicked
with a manicured fingernail.
   Kevin Keefe, associate editor of Trains Magazine and an expert
on passenger-train travel, said the American-European Express may
prove to be a financial success.
   ``It's ... an exciting prospect for people traveling by train in
the grand manner,'' he said in an interview from Milwaukee. ``It
harkens back to a time when traveling on a long-distance train .. .
was an experience to be savored.''
   He added: ``It's much fancier than what you get on Amtrak.''
   A jazz band blared ``Chattanooga Choo-Choo'' as the guests
disembarked at Union Station.
   Most seemed suitably impressed.
   ``Instead of the hurry-itis we usually have, I feel like I've
been on a little vacation,'' said North Carolinian Bonnie
McElveen-Hunter as she clutched her full-length fur to shield her
from a chilling Chicago wind. ``It's a return to yesteryear. We
need that.''
   ``This was the perfect opportunity to do something different,''
said Washington attorney Patrick Keeley.
   ``It was a European travel experience,'' said his wife, Regina,
who nonetheless acknowledged, ``putting on mascara was kind of
difficult.''
   American-European Express will run two five-car trains between
Chicago and Washington _ one going each way _ six days a week. The
first regular run will be Wednesday.
   Most of its rail cars were built in the 1940s and '50s, many by
the Pullman Co. The interior decorating is anything but plebeian.
   Pianist Bill Andrew will play requests on the grand piano in the
Art Deco-inspired club car, where the brass window trim is
complemented by ``faux tortoise'' leather wainscoting. Dinner is
served on fine china with damask table linens.
   As could be expected, luxury travel doesn't come cheap. A
double-occupancy fare runs about $1,042, while booking the train's
Presidential Cabin will cost $1,450.
   The fancy trains will be pulled behind Amtrak trains for a
``fancy fee'' _ an example of Amtrak's creativity in raising money,
Keefe said.
   Spann said American-European Express invested about $1 million
per car in refurbishing but expects to turn a profit.
   ``We have 26 rooms with an average price of $1,000,'' he said.
``On an average night, what you really want to achieve is somewhere
between $18,000 and $24,000 in sales. If you do that, you can pay
for this investment.''
   Spann said there are still a few wrinkles to iron out.
   ``There's no Kleenex in the rooms,'' he reflected. ``You spend
millions of dollars and forget the Kleenex.''

<TEXT>
   The high-technology industry is taking another hit
with the announcement by Wang Laboratories Inc. that it will cut
2,000 jobs in an effort to restore profitability.
   President Richard Miller announced the move Thursday, saying the
computer industry has lost its boom, forcing the company to undergo
a ``fundamental reordering'' and pay more attention to its
customers.
   But analysts, who welcomed the change, said Wang has contributed
to many of its problems and that bolder steps are necessary to make
the company more competitive.
   ``This is a necessary but not a sufficient step,'' said Barry
Willman, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. Inc.
   The cutback was the latest sign of a high-tech industry slowdown
that has contributed to a softening of the economy.
   ``Some fundamental things are happening that will drive all
(computer) companies to do things differently or they will fail,''
Miller said.
   Prior to Thursday's announcement, the company already had cut
about 5,000 jobs this year and announced plans to sell $200 million
in assets. Wang posted a loss of $62.1 million in the first quarter
that ended Sept. 30, and Miller predicted more losses for the
second quarter.
   Miller was appointed president of Wang in August, succeeding
Frederick Wang, who had been ousted from the job by An Wang, his
father, company founder and chairman.
   Miller said under the company's new approach, Wang will cut its
bureaucracy to get in closer touch with the needs of its customers.
   ``We are eliminating the layers between the field and
laboratory,'' he said. ``We will eliminate entire functions _
functions that I view as stifling.''
   For example, he said, the company's product development programs
often duplicate efforts, with no single group taking
responsibility. As a result, products often have been introduced
late.
   The reorganization of the company will mean the loss of about
2,000 jobs by Jan. 1, lowering the Wang workforce to just over
22,000, he said.
   About 1,000 of the layoffs will occur in Massachusetts, mostly
at the company's headquarters in Lowell, with the rest scattered
around the world.
   A severance package for these employees will result in a
one-time charge of $30 million in the company's second quarter,
which ends Dec. 31.
   Miller said the restructuring announced Thursday would cut
annual costs by about $115 million, but he stressed that the
company was not simply calculating how much needed to be cut in
order to be profitable.
   The high-tech industry recently has suffered other setbacks.
Data General Corp. announced last month it would eliminate 2,200
jobs, and Digital Equipment Corp. recently offered voluntary
severance to 700 workers.
   ``I think restructuring is becoming a common word in this
industry,'' Miller said.
   Miller said much of Wang's bureaucracy grew while the high-tech
industry was booming. But now the industry has reached a
``maturing'' stage with slower growth, he said.
   The bureaucracy ``just built up because of the luxury of very
big margins in a high growth industry,'' he said.
   But while Miller pointed to the fluctuations in the computer
industry for many of his company's problems, analysts said some of
the trouble _ particularly poor customer service _ has been unique
to Wang.
   ``They have had this problem with service and support for a long
time,'' said Steven Wendler, an analyst with Gartner Group Inc.
``Rick Miller is a breath of fresh air.''
   Also, Wendler said, after the company completes the cost-cutting
measures, ``the hemorrhaging, financially, will stop.''
   George Elling, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said during
the 1970s and early 1980s, Wang did not pay attention to customer
service because it became confident as a leader in word processing
equipment.
   ``They had something everyone wanted,'' he said. ``People were
willing to put up with poorer service.''
   ``Wang was too slow to recognize they needed to change,'' he
said, noting that other companies have adapted better to new
product demands.
   Part of the change, Miller said, will include more focus on
software and other computer applications.
   ``Most customers are not crying for new technology,'' he said.
``They are crying for new applications of technology.''

   A Hungarian edition of Playboy magazine will hit

   ``Playboy will satisfy the strong demand for an upscale

   The first edition, scheduled to go on sale Nov. 29, will carry
over December's contents of the American edition, including an
interview with Soviet world chess champion Garry Kasparov and the
first of a four-part series on the history of the magazine.
   But the Hungarian edition also will include works by Hungarian

<HEAD>Convenience Food, Perhaps Sale of Food Groups Ahead for Campbell</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto CX10</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A five-year plan for Campbell Soup Co. calls for
aggressive moves to grab more of the convenience food market and
the possible sale of some food subsidiaries, the company's interim
management team says.
   ``Business is an evolving thing,'' said Edwin Harper, who serves
with Herbert Baum as executive vice president. ``There are some
assets we don't really need.''
   Campbell owns Pepperidge Farm, Vlasic Foods, Mrs. Paul's
Kitchens, Godiva Chocolatier and Casera Foods.
   ``Some businesses in my opinion are near the borderline,'' Baum
added during a news conference here Thursday, the two officials'
first since being named to oversee Campbell's day-to-day operations
Nov. 1.
   Convenience-food marketing and plant-modernization will require
a $2 billion investment over the next five years, they said.
   Baum and Harper took over temporarily for R. Gordon McGovern,
the company's president and chief executive, who stepped down after
nine years. Campbell's board had been unhappy with the company's
performance in recent years, and there had been rumors that it
might be sold.
   Both Baum and Harper are candidates to succeed McGovern. Baum
said board Chairman Robert J. Vlasic has indicated the selection
process would be completed by early next year.
   In September, Campbell reported fiscal 1989 earnings of $13
million on sales of $5.72 billion compared to earnings of $274
million on sales of $4.87 billion the previous year. The company
attributed the earnings decline to a $343 million charge related to
a corporate restructuring that involved the closing of
manufacturing plants in New Jersey, Maryland and Tennessee,
eliminating 2,800 jobs.
   Harper called the restructuring ``a pretty thorough
housecleaning'' but both he and Baum indicated further cuts may be
needed.
   Campbell, based in Camden, N.J., is the nation's largest
soupmaker. It sells about 5 billion cans a year, which represents
about 65 percent of the $2.2 billion retail soup market.
   Harper, who was promoted from executive vice president and chief
financial officer, is overseeing Campbell's foreign operations. He
said the company is developing a strategy for modernization of its
facilities worldwide.

<HEAD>FAA Expands Scope of Inspections For Cracking on 747's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration has directed
airlines to expand inspections for possible cracks on all models of
Boeing 747 airliners with 15,500 or more flights.
   The FAA said in an emergency airworthiness directive that an
airline conducting a more limited inspection ordered last week
found ``multiple longitudinal skin cracks'' outside the specified
area.
   ``This new information indicates that the inspection
requirements of (the previous directive) must be extended to detect
all cracks. Such cracking, if not detected, could result in rapid
decompression of the airplane,'' said the directive, issued by the
FAA's Northwest Mountain Region office in Seattle on Thursday.
   The new inspection, by visual and electronic methods, includes
all of the nose section back to the passenger door, said Elizabeth
Reese, spokeswoman for Boeing.
   The directive also expands the number of planes that must be
inspected to include 123 planes worldwide and 59 in the United
States. The planes are from among the first 430 747s to roll off
Boeing's Everett production line, starting in 1968.
   Some 300 more 747's eventually will have to be inspected once
they reach the 15,500-flight milestone, or roughly three-fourths of
the plane's design life.
   The original directive, issued Nov. 2, ordered airlines to
inspect only an area of the upper part of the cockpit for minute
cracks, and applied to the 92 oldest Boeing 747s.
   The first directive also had excluded planes that had been
modified to help prevent cracking, but FAA spokesman Dave Duff said
cracks between 0.1 and 0.25 inches in length were found in at least
one 747 that had been modified.
   The modifications were begun in 1986 under Boeing's aging
aircraft program and included the replacement of the old aluminum
skin with a new aluminum alloy and reinforcement of the area.
   ``We're concerned about any cracking and if additional cracking
is found we'll expand the number of planes we're looking at,'' Duff
said.
   The inspections are to be made within 30 days, with any repairs
to be made before further flight is allowed.
   The order means that any 747s already inspected following the
Nov. 2 directive will have to be reinspected.
   Both directives were prompted by the discovery of 28 cracks
found on Sept. 27 in the front section of a 747-400 cargo freighter
owned by Federal Express.

<HEAD>Judge Approves $2.35 Million Pan Am Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has approved a $2.35
million settlement for 117 female flight attendants who sued Pan
American World Airways for using stricter weight standards for them
than for men.
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson said Thursday that the
settlement was fundamentally fair and highly favorable to the
attendants despite objections from six women whose damage claims
were fully or partially denied.
   The settlement will be shared by 117 women who were suspended,
fired or denied promotions because of the weight policy, said
Kathleen King, an attorney for the Independent Union of Flight
Attendants.
   Pan Am also agreed to liberalize weight standards for current or
future employees.
   The former policy used a 1959 insurance company table of heights
and weights, but judged men under the standard for large frames and
women under the standard for medium frames. A 5-foot-7 woman was
allowed to weigh 139 pounds under the medium standard, but would
have been allowed to weigh 150 under the large standard.
   The flight attendants' union sued Pan Am in 1984, and won a
ruling from Henderson three years later in a non-jury trial that
the policy was biased.
   The ruling was the first to find discrimination by an airline
that had weight policies for both men and women, Pan Am attorney
Richard Schoolman said at the time.
   Henderson ordered the airline to use a large-frame standard for
all employees hired while the policy was in effect, through the end
of 1984.
   Pan Am appealed Henderson's ruling, denying it had
discriminated. The appeal is being dropped as part of the
settlement, without any admission of discrimination.
   The settlement retains Henderson's previous order on weight
standards and also increases some of the standards adopted by the
airline in 1985, when it started setting weight requirements
according to an employee's individual build. In addition, women
hired after 1985 get another three-pound allowance at ages 35, 45
and 55.
   Although $2.5 million was less than the women might have gotten
in individual damage claims, Henderson said it was reasonable in
light of the time an appeal would have taken and the risk that the
entire amount would have been thrown out on appeal.

<TEXT>
   Talks are underway between the city and Chemical
Banking Corp. to try to persuade the company not to move 3,000 jobs
to New Jersey.
   ``I think we've made perfectly clear that Chemical is a very
important corporation here in the city of New York and that we will
make available our entire array of people and resources to keep
them in New York,'' said Stanley E. Grayson, the deputy mayor for
finance and economic development.
   He said Thursday that discussions began anew after Chemical
pulled out of the multibillion-dollar Times Square redevelopment
project last spring.
   The bank's lease at its Park Avenue headquarters and offices in
Rockefeller Center expire in 1994. Chemical officials have been
studying various options for 18 months, including a new building in
nearby Secaucus, N.J., said Charles Salmans, a bank spokesman.
   ``For some of our staff we have examined New Jersey sites as
well as New York sites,'' he said.
   The city has battled recently to keep companies such as Chase
Manhattan Corp. and NBC in the city. Earlier this year, Merrill
Lynch announced it would move 2,500 back-office employees to Jersey
City, N.J., and Exxon Corp. said it would move 300 employees from
its New York headquarters to Dallas.
   In an Oct. 25 letter to city officials, Chemical senior vice
president Peter Brooke said the bank has enjoyed below-market
rents, but would face ``an extraordinary increase in expenses'' if
it wanted to renew.
   ``Consequently, a plan has been developed which retains a small
`flagship' headquarters facility in Manhattan containing staff who
have an absolute need to be located there,'' the letter said. ``All
other staff would be located in a second facility in New Jersey.''
   Salmans said the letter was written in response to a request
from city officials for ``a listing of all of the areas of the bank
that might potentially be relocated to New Jersey.''
   The list adds up to about 3,000 of the 4,700 employees at the
two sites, Salmans said.
   ``No decisions have been taken, but we did reach a point where
we needed to get an understanding from officials of the city of New
York for what incentives might be available to us to factor into
how we looked at the cost of various alternatives,'' Salmans said.
   Grayson said Chemical officials have indicated a willingness to
move operations to a borough outside Manhattan.
   The bank also has discussed a non-binding option with Hartz
Mountain Industries to construct in Secaucus a building of a
million square feet or more, Salmans said.
   The state and city put together a $235 million package last year
to keep Chase from moving 5,000 jobs to New Jersey.
   Asked if Chemical might expect a similar deal, Grayson said, ``I
don't believe that is a responsible way for us to act, where the
last deal becomes a starting point for the next deal. With
discussion with firms, I think they very much understand that.''
   He said the final package would depend on the site chosen and
``what's in the best interest of the city.''

   Phoenix financier Charles H. Keating Jr.'s
claim that federal regulators wrongfully seized the Lincoln Savings
and Loan Association apparently will get a full hearing in court.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin on Thursday ordered the
first of a series of hearings Dec. 7-8 on Keating's lawsuit
challenge of the federal takeover in April of the insolvent S&amp;L.
The takeover is estimated to cost the taxpayers $2 billion.
   Sporkin, the former enforcement chief of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, said Keating and government witnesses are
likely to be summoned to the hearing. He said the session will
enable him to ``test a few things'' on whether the case merits a
full trial, which could take two years or longer.
   Sporkin had said Wednesday that ``I need a chance to figure
things out. ... Mr. Keating's going to take the stand. You're
entitled to a day in court.''
   Government attorneys had initially opposed Sporkin's suggestion
that Keating be heard in court, asking instead that the judge
dismiss the lawsuit on the basis of the administrative record used
by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in deciding to seize Lincoln.
   Under the arrangement ordered by Sporkin, testimony will be
taken on only a small sample of the real estate transactions
reflected by that 4,000-page record.
   James Murphy, an attorney for the Office of Thrift Supervision,
confirmed the government ``will call Mr. Keating and one or more of
our (bank) examiners.''
   Keating is chairman of the American Continental Corp., which was
Lincoln's parent company. The government argues American
Continental looted $94 million from Lincoln's depositors with bogus
land investments. Murphy called it ``one of the worst of the
worst'' cases of fraud and abuse in the nation's S&amp;L history.
   There have been estimates that the federal bailout of the thrift
industry may cost more than $150 billion.

<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. is
expected to announce on Tuesday a new generation of data-storage
devices that have been delayed for months by expensive technical
problems.
   The disk drives for mainframe computers account for about
one-tenth of IBM's $60 billion in annual revenue. The delay in the
new models past the original July announcement date was blamed for
contributing to IBM's 30 percent drop in third-quarter profits.
   Stephen Cohen, an analyst at SoundView Financial Group in
Stamford, Conn., said he understood from talking to IBM customers
that IBM has not entirely solved the technical problem, so
large-scale shipments probably won't begin until the second quarter
of 1990.
   The problem apparently comes from inconsistent quality in a part
from an outside supplier, Cohen said today.
   IBM spokesman Amos Kerisch confirmed today that IBM was holding
a news conference Tuesday about data-storage devices for mainframe
computers, but declined to comment further.

   The stock market rallied today in a session
delayed for an hour by a fire that disrupted computer systems used
by the New York and American stock exchanges.
   The 11 a.m. Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 15.78 at
2,619.47, recouping most of Thursday's 19.67-point loss.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
730 up, 346 down and 483 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 34.37 million shares at
midmorning.
   A fire at the Securities Industry Automation Corp. in lower
Manhattan's financial district delayed the usual 9:30 a.m. EST
opening of stock trading.
   SIAC, which is housed in a two-tower building of lower
Manhattan, process trades for the exchanges.
   When activity resumed at 10:30 a.m., prices almost immediately
headed higher.
   Analysts said a strong showing by bond futures contracts helped
renew the hopes for lower interest rates that helped push stock
prices higher earlier in the week.
   The Federal Reserve, apparently encouraged by continued signs
that inflationary pressures remain subdued, indicated on Tuesday
that it had decided to relax its credit policy a bit further.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Woolworth, up 1~ at 59{;
McDonald's, up \ at 31[; Aluminum Co. of America, up } at 69[, and
United Technologies, up { at 53}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.92 to 187.67. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .43 at 370.84.

   Trading opened an hour late today at the New
York and American stock exchanges because of a fire beneath a
building that houses a key computer system.
   Trading in certain stock-related futures contracts in Chicago
also was temporarily disrupted due to the difficulties in New York.
   A spokeswoman at the American Stock Exchange said a fire in a
lower Manhattan building that houses the Securities Industry
Automation Corp. made it impossible to process information,
delaying the usual 9:30 a.m. EST opening of stock trading.
   A spokesman for the Securities Industry Automation Corp., which
processes trades for the exchanges, said the fire did not affect
trading systems. John Lafayette, the spokesman, said that
uncertainty about the power supply led the company to suspend
operations and switch to an emergency power source at 9:15 a.m. EST.
   Still, trading did not begin on the American and New York stock
exchanges until 10:30 a.m.
   A Fire Department spokesman said the two-alarm blaze erupted in
an electrical vault below the building. The first alarm sounded at
8:04 a.m.
   The fire was under control by 9:48 a.m. and extinguished shortly
after. Firefighters searched each of the building's 53 floors, and
the spokesman said a haze of light smoke had filtered through the
building.
   The lobby and the second floor of the building were evacuated
and some tenants on higher floors had lost power.
   No injuries were reported.
   In addition to the stock exchanges, the Chicago Board of Trade
and Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which trade stock-index futures,
also suffered trading disruptions.
   Trading in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index futures
contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was delayed one hour
and reopened when stock trading began in New York.
   On the Chicago Board of Trade, trading in the major market stock
index futures contract opened as usual but had to be halted for 40
minutes until trading opened in New York.

   Grain and soybean futures opened higher this
morning on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Corn and soybeans showed surprising strength given a bearish
U.S. Agriculture Department crop report released Thursday. The
report showed that this year's corn and soybean crops are larger
than previously estimated.
   The strong opening may be due to speculative buying, according
to analyst William Biederman of Allendale Inc. in Chicago.
   Wheat prices were steady to slightly higher in light trading
despite disappointing export figures.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent lower to 2 cents higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.02{ a bushel; corn was
a { cent lower to a { cent higher with December at $2.37 a bushel;
oats were a { cent to 1\ cents higher with December at $1.43{ a

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Announces Cheaper International Toll-Free Feature</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. is making it cheaper for
businesses to offer international 800 service, which allows their
customers to call them toll-free from outside the United States.
   As of Dec. 11, U.S. customers of AT&amp;T will be able to receive
toll-free calls from 41 countries on regular telephone lines
instead of through special, so-called ``dedicated'' lines, the
company said Thursday.
   MCI Communications Corp. has offered long-distance toll-free
service on regular as well as dedicated lines for about a year,
said MCI spokesman Steve Johnson in Arlington, Va.
   ``AT&amp;T is trying to catch up to us,'' he said. ``AT&amp;T has been
responding to this capability that's been in place for more than a
year at MCI.''
   MCI offers toll-free service from 15 countries, he said.
   Another competitor, US Sprint Communications Co., offers
toll-free service only from Canada, although it plans to expand to
other countries by mid-1990, said spokesman Greg Finch.
   AT&amp;T subscribers currently pay $266.50 to install a dedicated
line, plus a one-time $99 fee for each country included and a
monthly service charge of $36.70.
   Through the new feature, subscribers will pay a one-time
start-up fee of $43.50, which includes service to one country, $99
for each additional country and a $20 monthly charge.
   Fees for the actual telephone time will remain the same,
however. For example, it currently costs $96 for the first 10 hours
of calls from France, and $90 for the next 24 hours.

<HEAD>Dividend Outlook Dims As Profits Lag</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If corporate profits keep lagging the way they
have in the last few months, many Wall Street analysts say they
will soon slow the rapid growth of dividends.
   Spurred on by the earnings boom of 1988 and early 1989, dividend
payments by the 500 companies in Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
composite index are expected to show an increase of 13 percent this
year.
   That would rank as by far the strongest showing of this decade,
just about tripling the current rate of inflation.
   But in 1990, S&amp;P analysts project that the rate of dividend
increases will drop back to the 5 percent to 6 percent range.
   ``Dividend hikes, a strongly supportive market influence this
year, will be less of a factor next year,'' S&amp;P said in its weekly
publication The Outlook.
   For much of the 1980s, dividends have been consigned to a
supporting role in the story of the market's ups and downs. Capital
gains have been the dominant theme in a bull market where prices of
many stocks chalked up gains of 200 percent, 300 percent or more.
   Companies that found themselves with buildups of cash they could
have devoted to dividend increases often opted for a different
course _ using the money to buy back chunks of their stock.
   But the crash of 1987 and this year's October massacre have
apparently helped inspire a revival of enthusiasm for dividends as
a sort of stabilizing influence in periods of uncertainty.
   In the weeks immediately following the 190-point of the Dow
Jones industrial average on Oct. 13 of this year, dividend-paying
stocks outperformed those without dividends by close to 2 to 1,
according to Joseph Barthel, analyst at Hopper Soliday &amp; Co.
   Dividends have always mattered to long-term investors hoping to
benefit from rising income (and hence inflation protection) on
their investment, or from participation in dividend reinvestment
plans for growth.
   Furthermore, dividends have gained a new status in the last
couple of years since tax reform did away with special breaks for
long-term capital gains, leaving both types of income subject to
the same tax rates.
   The trend in dividends, of course, is always heavily dependent
on which way corporate profits are headed.
   Lately, many Wall Street estimates of 1990 earnings have been
cut back after a disappointing crop of reports for this year's
third quarter and early indications that the fourth quarter will
also be weak.
   But analysts' opinions remain sharply divided over how long and
how severe the earnings slump will be.
   Michael Sherman, investment strategist at Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., contends that it probably will have run its course by the
middle of next year.
   ``We still expect profits to resume an upward path in the second
half of 1990 as inflation continues to subside, short-term interest
rates decline, and money supply growth, which has returned to an
expansionary level, makes itself felt in aggregate demand,''
Sherman says.
   On that score, analysts say, lower interest rates would be
helpful for the market outlook in a couple of important ways.
   First of all, they would stand to bolster prospects for earnings
and dividends by stimulating business activity. Secondly, they
would make dividend yields of stocks more attractive by comparison
with returns available on interest-bearing investments.

   Jacksonville Shipyards Inc. said it
will close in January, idling up to 1,500 workers, unless a buyer
is found within the next 60 days.
   The shipyard, owned by Green Bay, Wis.-based Terex Corp., began
notifying workers Thursday as required by the federal plant-closing
law.
   Terex said in a statement that it was negotiating with several
potential buyers but no firm bids had surfaced.
   ``We believe that a transaction may be concluded prior to the
end of the 60-day notice period,'' the statement said.
   Jacksonville Shipyards has been steadily losing money over the
past several years, according to Terex Controller Jim Kettinger.
   Terex acquired Jacksonville Shipyards in July when it purchased
the maritime and truck trailer divisions of Fruehauf Corp. for $231
million. Terex announced at that time it would sell the shipyards
but retain the truck trailer manufacturing division.
   Employment at the 106-year-old ship-repairing company fluctuates
between 1,000 and 1,500 workers.

<HEAD>Delay in Raising Debt Ceiling Had Little Impact on Bond Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Though news stories on the delay in raising the
federal debt limit last week had an apocalyptic tone, the
congressional procrastination caused little trouble in the bond
market and no long-term damage, experts say.
   ``I think it's overblown,'' said David Hale, chief economist for
Kemper Financial Services Inc.
   The delay in hiking the ceiling on the amount of money the
Treasury may raise meant investors couldn't buy U.S. savings bonds
for a week. It also meant state and local governments couldn't buy
the special Treasury securities they use to stash away proceeds
from bond sales.
   In addition, the debt-ceiling problem posed the threat of
depressing the bond market, since it compressed the sale of $30
billion in Treasury notes and bonds into a shorter-than-usual time
frame.
   Without the usual time period for ``when-issued'' trading in the
securities _ the trading of securities that goes on before they are
actually issued _ some experts said the new Treasury issues might
have had to offer higher yields to attract enough buyers. When bond
yields rise, their prices fall.
   But a countervailing force on bond prices was a move by the
Federal Reserve Board last week to ease interest rates, analysts
said.
   An auction of $10 billion in three-year notes Thursday seemed to
disprove the experts, with the notes selling at an average yield of
7.77 percent, the lowest for three-year notes since Feb. 2, 1988.
   The Treasury scheduled an auction of $10 billion in 10-year
notes for Monday and $10 billion in 30-year bonds for Tuesday.
   The impact on the bond market from the delay in raising the debt
limit should be short-term, experts said.
   ``We're really talking about the timing of the bond calendar in
a month,'' Hale said. Though the sale of some Treasury securities
was delayed, the same total amount will be available in the month,
he noted.
   Had Congress delayed a few more days in approving an increase in
the debt limit, the Treasury may have had to put off the redemption
of bills that matured last Thursday. It also could have forced the
government to delay the issuance of certain checks, such as those
to Social Security recipients.
   But once Congress agreed to raise the debt limit and President
Bush signed the bill Wednesday, things began to get back to normal
in the credit markets.
   Stephen Meyerhardt, a spokesman for the Treasury's savings bond
division, said investors couldn't buy the bonds from Nov. 1 to last
Wednesday while the Treasury was barred from raising more money.
   ``We did get lots of calls from people and banks saying `What's
going on?''' Meyerhardt said.
   He said the Treasury won't know until the end of the month how
the 5{ business days during which savings bonds weren't sold will
affect sales of these popular investments. The Treasury sells
anywhere from $15 million to $32 million worth of savings bonds a
day, he said.
   ``Whether or not people decided not to buy because of this,
there's no way for us to tell,'' he said.
   People who buy savings bonds through a payroll deduction plan
should see little or no effect from the delay in bond sales,
Meyerhardt said, since typically it takes up to a week for an
employer to get the bonds issued in normal times.
   There were reports that some state and local governments delayed
bond sales because they couldn't buy the Treasury's State and Local
Government Series bonds, or ``slugs,'' during the debt-ceiling
delay.
   When states and municipalities sell a bond issue, they typically
don't need all of the proceeds at once. The unneeded portion is
invested in the slugs.
   Government bond issuers are barred from putting bond proceeds
into normal investments, such as certificates of deposit, that
would result in them earning higher interest rates than allowed by
federal laws. Since they are non-profit entities, these laws bar
them from making money off the proceeds of bond sales.

   Ford Motor Co. Chairman Donald Petersen
today announced that he is retiring March 1. He will be succeeded
by Vice Chairman Harold Poling.
   Petersen, 63, has been chairman of the nation's second-largest
automaker since Feb. 1, 1985.
   Poling, who turned 64 last month, became vice chairman two years
ago and has been chief operating officer since the day Petersen
became chairman and chief executive officer. Poling said he would
hold the chairmanship for three years.
   ``I think that it's time for me to make a change in my life,''
Petersen said at a news conference. ``I plan to slow down
substantially for the rest of 1990.''
   Succeeding Poling as chief operating officer will be Philip E.
Benton Jr., president of the Ford Automotive Group. Executive Vice
President Allan Gilmour will follow Benton as head of the company's
vehicle-making organization.
   Petersen said Executive Vice President Stanley Seneker would
remain as chief financial officer of the company.
   In 1980, the first year that Petersen served as president of the
automaker, Ford lost $1.5 billion. Last year, Ford reported a
profit of $5.3 billion.
   Petersen joined Ford in 1949 and served extensively in the
company's vehicle planning and marketing operations before becoming
Ford's president in March 1980.
   Poling, who joined Ford in 1951, was the company's president in
February 1985 when he was appointed vice chairman in 1987. The
president's title was dropped at that time.
   Roger Smith, chairman of industry leader General Motors Corp.,
is expected to retire in 1990. Chairman Lee Iacocca's contract
expires in 1991 with No. 3 Chrysler Corp.
   The United Auto Workers union had no immediate comment on the
changes at Ford.

layoffs in recent days.
   But William D. Anderson, an economist at Penn State University's
College of Business Administration, sees evidence of only a
slowdown.
   ``I'm yet to be convinced that that slowdown is going to lead to
a recession,'' Anderson said.
   Many agree, at least for the near future.
   Only a third of 50 economists surveyed by Blue Chip Economic
Indicators of Sedona, Ariz., see a recession starting by the end of
1990. Another third see one in 1991 and the rest don't predict a
recession until 1992 or beyond.
   Ken Goldstein, a labor economist with the Conference Board, a
New York-based business group, sees the layoffs as part of a
continuum over the past 6{ years.
   ``Overall the number of layoffs doesn't seem to have
significantly increased,'' he said. ``What is unusual during the
last six or eight months is the number of layoffs that have been
highly publicized.''
   Goldstein attributes the publicity to nervousness about the
economy, a feeling he says that is ``not just limited to the
investment community.''
   An organized-labor economist who is among the nervous said
layoffs must be considered in re-examining trade and technology
policies.
   ``It's an economic problem in that we're losing a lot of
production and the associated earnings and income,'' said Markley
Roberts, assistant director of the AFL-CIO's Department of Economic
Research in Washington. ``And then in addition, you have the
tremendous dislocation ... that produces a whole lot of human costs
in terms of health and family.''
   Roberts is concerned about recent signs from layoffs.
   ``Purists would say you've got to wait for more numbers to come
in, but I feel certain we're on the verge of a slowdown or
recession,'' Roberts said.
   Historically, manufacturing is among the first sectors of the
economy hit during a downturn, but the past few years have left the
economy on a high plateau that can withstand some blows, Anderson
said.
   Unemployment in October and September was 5.3 percent, up from
5.1 percent in August but down from 5.4 percent in August 1988,
according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   The latest unemployment report showed a decline in manufacturing
jobs for the seventh straight month but a sharp increase in local
and state government hiring as well as in health services.
Employment in business services, finance and real estate was up
slightly or flat.
   Recent layoffs have been concentrated in a few industries,
notably auto manufacturing, computers and financial services.
   But they also have affected such far-flung companies as
aerospace and equipment supplier Trinova Corp. of Maumee, Ohio,
with 1,500 employees let go; the Los Angeles Herald Examiner
newspaper, which closed, eliminating 831 jobs; and the Braniff Inc.
airline, which could lay off up to 2,700 employees due to its
financial troubles.
   Elizabeth Baatz, a senior economist at Cahners Publishing Co. in
Newton, Mass., says the layoffs and voluntary severances in the
electronics industry _ including computer and office and
communications equipment makers _ do not indicate ``horrible times
ahead.''
   Electronics companies have held down on hiring even though
production has climbed sharply since the industry's 1985-86
recession, so they do not have many extra employees, she said. In
fact, employment remains below the 1984 peak.
   Everett Ehrlich, vice president for economic analysis for
Unisys, says the computer industry is a victim of its success in
making smaller, more powerful and less expensive equipment. It
takes fewer people to build and maintain the new machines.
   The result, he said, is ``the U.S. computer industry is not at a
precipice. The layoffs are a harsh human toll, but the layoffs
don't indicate that the industry is mature or that it's being
beaten by an influx of foreign machines.''

<HEAD>Remy Martin, Cointreau Plan Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The family-held French spirits groups E. Remy
Martin and Cie. and Cointreau SA said Friday they plan to merge in
a deal that will give them a competitive boost against foreign
giants in the beverage market.
   The move is aimed at creating a ``premium French spirits group
... drawing on the synergies between the two companies while
respecting the identity of each one,'' the companies said in a
joint statement.
   The merger would create a company with annual revenue of more
than 6 billion francs, or about $1 billion, the companies said.
   The plan is to unite Remy Martin's cognac, champagne and premium
wine holdings under the same umbrella as Cointreau's liqueur,
armagnac, rum, fruit juice and luxury food products.
   Beyond obvious advantages in distribution, this move also would
give the family group new financial muscle to help protect it from
big publicly-traded competitors like Seagram Co. Ltd. and Grand
Metropolitan Plc, which have been competing to acquire the
dwindling number of quality beverage products still available.
   In this respect, the planned merger resembles previous alliances
that created other French family-controlled groups like
Moet-Hennessy and LVMH Moet-Hennessy-Louis Vuitton SA.
   Under the plan, the holding company of the Heriard-Dubreuil
family will transfer its 51 percent interest in Remy to Cointreau
and Cie., a holding company which controls 100 of Contreau SA. Each
company will retain management autonomy after the deal.
   Other details of the asset swap have not yet been completed, but
the companies said the Heriard-Dubreuil family will emerge with a
slight majority over the Cointreau family in the newly formed group.
   The deal requires shareholder approval which is expected in the
coming months, they said.
   The decision to unite the two companies follows years of close
cooperation in distribution throughout the Pacific and the United
States. Cointreau family interests have also been long-term
shareholders in Remy Martin.
   Recent earnings data for Remy Martin and Cointreau were not
available since neither of the companies is publicly traded.

   Atari Corp., the computer and video
game maker, said it has agreed to sell 26 of its struggling
Federated Group consumer electronics stores to Silo Inc., a
Philadelphia-based electronics retailer.
   The tentative agreement, announced Thursday, calls for Silo to
take over 21 Federated stores in Los Angeles and Orange counties
and five in San Diego. Terms of the deal weren't announced.
   Silo already operates 10 stores in San Diego.
   Atari officials said discussions continue with potential buyers
for its 14 remaining stores in Texas, Kansas and Arizona.
   Federated Group had 91 outlets when Atari bought it in August
1987 for $67.3 million. The chain immediately began losing money.
After announcing a loss of nearly $85 million in March, Atari put
Federated up for sale.

<HEAD>Grains, Soybeans Higher Despite Crop Estimates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade, shrugging off increased
estimates of the nation's corn and soybean crop production.
   Corn prices were higher from the open as commercial buyers
entered the market on reports the Soviet Union may make a purchase
totalling 1.5 million metric tons.
   ``You can forget the production numbers,'' said analyst Mickey
Luth of Sherson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago. ``The figures have
no meaning at all. What matters is the news flow, producer sales
and export sales.''
   The crop report released Thursday by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture estimated the 1989 corn harvest at 7.59 billion
bushels, up 2 percent from the previous estimate, and soybean
production at 1.94 billion bushels, 1 percent above the October
estimate.
   Some analysts had predicted the crop report would trigger a
selloff, with export demand offering some support to prices.
   Soybean prices were higher on carryover strength from the corn
market and strong demand for soyoil. Prices also received support
from concern over delays in the planting of Brazil's soybean crop.
   Wheat prices were higher due to dryness in the winter wheat crop
areas.
   At the close, wheat was 1} cents to 5{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.05 a bushel; corn was \
cent to 1{ cents higher with December at $2.38 cents a bushel; oats
were } cent to 1\ cents higher with December at $1.43\ a bushel;
soybeans were 4 cents to 8{ cents higher with November at $5.76 a
bushel.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer
products giant, said Friday its after-tax profit rose 15 percent in
the third quarter from a year ago, partly due to a strong
contribution from newly acquired businesses.
   Unilever said its profit for the three months ended Sept. 30
came to 249 million pounds, or $396 million, compared with 216
million pounds, or $343 million, a year earlier.
   Earnings per share jumped to 14.14 pence, or 22 cents, from
11.57 pence, or 18 cents, a year earlier.
   Sales rose 16 percent to 5.06 billion pounds, or $8.05 billion,
compared with 4.36 billion pounds, or $6.9 billion, a year earlier.
   In the first nine months of the year, after-tax profit rose 16
percent to 701 million pounds, or $1.1 billion, from 603 million
pounds, or $959 million.
   Per-share earnings came to 39.40 pence, or 63 cents, compared
with 32.30 pence, or 51 cents.
   Sales rose 13 percent to 14.2 billion pounds, or $23 billion,
from 12.6 billion pounds, or $20 billion.
   Unilever said its European frozen products division did
particularly strongly, especially in ice-cream sales. It also
reported strong progress in Brazil and India.
   In North America, profit was enhanced by acquisitions and a
strong showing by the group's personal products and detergents
businesses.
   In the past year, Unilever has made various acquisitions in
cosmetics, toiletries and fragrances. In August, for example, the
company completed the purchase of several Faberge Inc. units for
$1.55 billion.

<TEXT>
   Banc One Corp. has announced a two-month delay in
closing its deal to acquire MCorp's failed banks from the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. because it's taking longer than anticipated
to review MCorp's loan portfolios.
   Banc One said Thursday that there have been ``no unusual
circumstances'' in the process, and the banking company hopes to
complete the acquisition by Jan. 17.
   The Columbus, Ohio-based banking company acquired Dallas-based
MCorp's 20 failed banks after federal banking regulators took them
over, saying they were insolvent.
   MCorp still owns five banks.
   The banks were merged into the Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank,
which Banc One agreed to acquire for $500 million.
   Banc One chairman John McCoy said in a prepared statement
Thursday that ``progress is being made in restructuring the bridge
bank under a management contract with the FDIC.''' He said the
company has installed its own management and information systems in
the bank and that the bank will be profitable in the first month
after the deal closes.
   The bailout is expected to cost the FDIC about $2 billion and is
the second most expensive in the agency's history. The bridge bank
was renamed Bank One Texas, and Banc One is managing it on the
contract with the FDIC until the deal can be closed.
   Banc One operates 53 affiliate banks and 563 branch offices in
Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished higher Friday as startling
reforms in East Germany and their uncertain affect on the economy
of West Germany fueled demand for the U.S. currency.
   Gold prices eased. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid for gold at 4 p.m. EST of $386.25 a troy ounce, down from
$386.30 late Thursday. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold lost
30 cents an ounce to close at $386.80.
   Traders said the dollar's biggest move came at the expense of
the West German mark. The dollar opened at 1.8520 marks and rose
steadily throughout the session, although it never broke through
the 1.8700-mark level.
   ``People are getting anxious to get out of marks,'' said Kevin
Lawrie, vice president at the Bank of Boston's New York office.
   ``They're not sure what the impact might be,'' he said,
referring to rapid-fire changes in East Germany, where travel
restrictions put into place 28 years ago have been lifted
permanently.
   The East bloc nation continued to shock the world Friday by
announcing the Berlin Wall would be opened in sections this weekend
to create more border crossing points.
   But for currency investors, the addage is: ``When in doubt, buy
dollars,'' Lawrie said.
   ``The historic events going on in East Germany have created a
`safe-haven' situation for the dollar,'' said Stephen Flanagan, a
vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   But, he noted, expectations that fresh economic data due out
next week would show continued weakening of the U.S. economy
limited the dollar's rise. ``There was reluctance to take the
dollar much higher,'' he said.
   Next week the government is scheduled to report on the trade
deficit, retail sales, business inventories and housing starts.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 142.75 yen, slightly higher than
Thursday's close of 142.70 yen. Later in London, the dollar traded
higher at 143.35 yen. In New York, the dollar finished at 143.40
yen, up from from 143.13 yen on Thursday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.5765 from $1.5863 late
Thursday. In New York, one pound cost $1.5773, cheaper for buyers
than Thursday's $1.5823.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.8670 West German marks, up from 1.8523;
1.6440 Swiss francs, up from 1.6250; 6.3255 French francs, up from
6.2810; 1,362.50 Italian lire, up from 1,354.25, and 1.1696
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1670.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.8625 West German marks, up from 1.8475;
1.6370 Swiss francs, up from 1.6212; 6.3135 French francs, up from
6.2545; 2.0950 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0815; 1,354.75 Italian
lire, up from 1,351.50, and 1.1694 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1675.
   Gold prices moved lower. In London the metal slipped to a late
bid of $386.00 a troy ounce, from $386.25 late Thursday. In Zurich,
gold fell to a closing bid of $384.50 an ounce from $387.30. In
Hong Kong gold closed at $386.24, down 48 cents from late Thursday.
   Silver prices slipped. On New York's Comex, the metal finished
at $5.26 a troy ounce, down from $5.28 on Thursday. Earlier in
London, silver fell to a late bid of $5.25 a troy ounce, from $5.33
late Thursday.

   Montedison SpA, Italy's largest chemical

compete more effectively in the increasingly global market.
   In August, Montedison offered to buy the remainder of another

it doesn't already own.
   Montedison's major shareholder is the Italian conglomerate
Ferruzzi Group, which owns around 46 percent of its outstanding

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Resorts International Inc., burdened
with massive debt, on Friday said it lost $34.9 million in the
third quarter and acknowledged it may be forced into bankruptcy
proceedings.
   The casino company, which owes investors $900 million, stopped
paying interest to bondholders in August. Resorts and bondholder
representatives have been negotiating a debt restructuring for
several months.
   Regardless of the outcome of those talks, Resorts said it
expects bondholders to file a petition to force the company into
involuntary bankruptcy by Nov. 15 _ the first anniversary of
entertainer Merv Griffin's purchase of the company.
   Under federal bankruptcy laws, bondholders have a year to
contend that company insiders wrongfully paid money to immunize it,
for their own benefit, from bankruptcy claims.
   Griffin initially put up $100 million to purchase Resorts from
developer Donald Trump. He later withdrew $50 million but gave
Resorts a $10 million credit line.
   ``We believe that there is ... probably a likelihood that a
petition would be filed by the 15th,'' said Alison MacDonald, a
Resorts spokeswoman in New York.
   Analysts said the bondholders' action was not unexpected.
   ``Certainly, the bondholders are trying to protect themselves by
having as much cash in the pot as possible,'' said Marvin B.
Roffman, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in
Philadelphia.
   In August, Griffin told bondholders of Resorts and its
subsidiaries _ Resorts International Finance Inc. and Griffin
Resorts Inc. _ that interest payments would be halted.
   Separately, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, Resorts lost
$34.9 million _ interest alone accounted for $32.5 million _ on
revenues of $124.3 million. In the year-ago quarter, the company
posted a loss of $339.8 million on revenues of $123.9 million.
Per-share figures were not available.
   The company blamed lower casino revenue for the quarterly loss
but noted that capital improvment projects should help improve some
operations next year.
   First the first nine months, Resorts said it lost $81.5 million
on revenues of $347.9 million, compared with $357.4 million lost on
revenue of $353.6 million for the same period in 1988.

   President Bush today proposed a $4.2 billion
spending package to help the poor buy houses and the homeless
receive shelter, and vowed to ``change the destructive practices''
that have blocked affordable housing in inner cities.
   Bush announced the program, which he called ``a comprehensive
agenda to help bring basic shelter and affordable housing within
reach of millions of Americans,'' in a speech to the National
Association of Realtors.
   It includes $4.2 billion in direct grants and expenditures over
three years and tax incentives costing an additional $2.7 billion.
   The president did not say how he would pay for the ``Home
Ownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere'' program. Jack
Kemp, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, told reporters
the money could come from a cut in the capital gains tax.
   Bush and the Congress are haggling over whether that tax should
be cut.
   The package, entailing federal programs tied to state and local
matching funds, includes $2.1 billion in grants to help residents
of low-income housing buy their units.
   Bush proposed that state and local governments or non-profit
groups pay $1 in matching funds for every $2 in federal HOPE
grants. The grants would be used to rehabilitate and purchase units
in public housing, vacant and foreclosed properties held by the
government and ``distressed'' properties cited by the Federal
Housing Authority.
   Bush also offered incentives to local communities that remove
bureaucratic barriers blocking the availability of affordable
housing, such as zoning restrictions.
   He would give $210 million in insurance and rental
rehabilitation grants for zones that best develop plans to remove
such tax and regulatory barriers in inner city areas.
   ``We will change the destructive practices which have kept FHA
out of the inner cities and distressed communities that most need
its support,'' he said. He assigned Kemp to name a panel that would
recommend ways to remove barriers to affordable housing.
   ``No city, state or town should receive a single penny of HOPE
funding until they have identified the barriers to affordable
housing in their own back yard and start taking steps to remove
them,'' Bush said.
   He said the centerpiece of his HOPE plan was ``to recapture the
American dream of home owneship for those who have been left
behind.''
   He also proposed:
   _ $728 million in federal housing funds, to be matched at the
state and local level, for new housing and support services for the
homeless.
   _ $1.08 billion to help tenant groups buy and convert federally
subsidized buildings to resident-owned cooperatives.
   _ Allowing first-time buyers to use Individual Retirement
Accounts for a home down payment without paying a penalty.
   _ $44 million for a demonstration project that would offer
housing and support services for elderly people who otherwise would
have to be institutionalized.
   HUD officials said the state and local matching funds would add
$1.7 billion in assistance.
   Bush also was attending a dinner to help Texas Gov. Bill
Clements retire $2 million in debt from his 1986 campaign and
helping dedicate a Texas memorial to Vietnam veterans before flying
home Saturday.
   In a speech last March 14, Bush said, ``When you look out the
window of the White House and see the ragged, pathetic figures
huddled over the steam grates of the Ellipse, I see an affront to
the American dream, a national shame.''
   He ordered Kemp then to come up with new ideas to get the
homeless off the streets of urban America.
   Earlier in the year, Bush proposed spending $644 million in
fiscal 1990 to carry out the McKinney Act, a program created to
find housing for the homeless.
   President Ronald Reagan was often criticized by homeless
activists for not seeking more funds for the homeless. Federal
funds for low-income housing were cut 75 percent during the Reagan
administration.
   District of Columbia officials believe there are 8,000 to 10,000
people living on the streets of the nation's capital. Nationally,
some researchers estimate 300,000 to 600,000 Americans are homeless
on any given night. Some activists say the homeless number 2
million or more.
   HUD has been enveloped in an influence-peddling scandal left
over from the Reagan years and Kemp has devoted most of his energy
to date to straightening out his department's procedures for
dispensing grants and contracts.

   A federal bankruptcy judge on Friday granted
Eastern Airlines an extension of the deadline for filing its
disclosure statement, which is intended to provide details of how
it intends to emerge from Chapter 11 reorganization.
   In a hearing, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland gave
Eastern until Dec. 29, a 45-day extension, to submit the disclosure
statement and a revised reorganization plan. The Miami-based
airline had requested that the Nov. 13 deadline for the disclosure
statement be extended for 60 days to Jan. 12.
   Eastern also had asked the court to extend to Jan. 12 its
exclusive right to submit a proposed reorganization plan. During
the exclusivity period, other parties to the case cannot make
reorganization proposals for Eastern, which recently submitted a
revised plan to its major creditors.
   Lifland told Eastern's attorneys that if the airline files its
disclosure statement by the new Dec. 29 deadline, it would
automatically receive a 60-day extension of the exclusivity period.
   Eastern's striking unions opposed the extensions, while
committees representing Eastern creditors and preferred
shareholders supported them.
   Eastern said the requests were motivated by the size and
complexity of its bankruptcy proceeding. Lifland previously had
granted Eastern two extensions of its exclusivity period and one
deferred deadline for filing the disclosure statement.
   The airline, which was struck by its pilots, Machinists and
flight attendants on March 4 in an ongoing walkout, has hired
replacement workers and is rebuilding as a smaller carrier.
   On Wednesday, Eastern posted a third-quarter net loss of $185.2
million after reportedly advising creditors' attorneys of a $200
million cash shortfall looming in its rebuilding plan.
   Also this week, the House gave final congressional approval to
legislation creating a congressional panel to investigate the
eight-month-old strike against Eastern, a measure the Bush
administration has threatened to veto.

   Stock prices closed out an erratic up-and-down
week Friday with a rally that featured a few issues benefiting from
the political news in Germany.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 21.92 to
2,625.61, finishing the week with a net loss of 3.90 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
901 up, 557 down and 494 unchanged.
   A fire-related power problem at the Securities Industry
Automation Corp. in lower Manhattan's financial district delayed
the usual 9:30 a.m. EST opening of stock trading by an hour. SIA

   When activity resumed, prices almost immediately headed higher.
   Analysts said a strong showing by bond futures contracts helped
renew the hopes for lower interest rates that helped push stock
prices higher earlier in the week.
   The Federal Reserve, apparently encouraged by continued signs
that inflationary pressures remain subdued, indicated on Tuesday
that it had decided to relax its credit policy a bit further.
   Germany Fund recorded one of the day's biggest percentage gains,
up 2} at 13{ as the West German stock market, where the fund

<HEAD>Group Buys 5 Percent Stake in Avon, Rekindling Takeover Speculation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   An investment group including Mary Kay Cosmetics
has amassed a 5 percent stake in Avon Products Inc., it was
disclosed Friday in an announcement that sparked speculation about
a renewed takeover advance on Avon.
   Avon earlier this year rebuffed overtures from Mary Kay Corp.
Vice Chairman John P. Rochon and rejected outright takeover
proposals from investor Irwin Jacobs and rival direct seller Amway
Corp.
   Avon's management repeatedly has insisted that the company is
better off remaining independent, free to carry out plans aimed at
improving the balance sheet.
   A limited partnership calling itself Chartwell Associates
notified Avon that as of Friday morning it held 5 percent of Avon's
outstanding voting stock, Avon said in a news release.
   Chartwell, in a letter, did not divulge its intentions, Avon
said.
   Avon spokesman John Cox said there hadn't been any direct
contact between Avon executives and members of the investment
group. He said Avon had no further comment to supplement its brief
announcement.
   Trading of Avon stock was temporarily halted Friday for the
announcement. The stock shot up when trading resumed, with the news
spurring speculative purchases as investors bet that a takeover
battle could be looming. Avon closed up $5.50 at $36.75 a share in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.
   The general partners in Chartwell were identified as members of
New York's Fisher family, which own significant real estate
holdings, and Argonaut Partners, headed by Rochon. The Getty Family
Trust was listed as the sole limited partner.
   Attempts to contact the partners for comment weren't immediately
successful.
   In the spring, Rochon revealed that he and some investor allies
had been interested in Avon for some time.
   He said in a letter dated May 25 that if Mary Kay succeeded in
acquiring Avon, the company would be run by Argonaut Partners,
which he described as an investment arm of Mary Kay Cosmetics, the
Dallas-based door-to-door beauty products marketer that is the main
unit of privately held Mary Kay Corp.
   The possibility of renewed takeover interest in Avon has been
rumored on Wall Street for weeks.
   News last month from the company that direct sales in the United
States probably would be disappointing in the important fourth
quarter shopping season _ due largely to sagging gift and jewelry
sales _ intensified the speculation.
   There has been talk that disaffected shareholders might put
pressure on Avon's management to take a hard look at any new
takeover offers that come along.
   The management evoked considerable stockholder consternation
when it turned down two previous offers this year. A $41-a-share,
or $2.85 billion, takeover bid from Minneapolis-based investor
Jacobs was spurned as was an earlier one from Amway for $39 a
share, or $2.1 billion.
   In the wake of the rejections, Avon implemented new cost
controls and speeded up the sales of certain subsidiaries, mainly
in health care services.
   More recently, Avon has said it is looking into the possibility
of divesting its retail fragrance division, comprising Giorgio
Beverly Hills and Parfums Stern.
   The cosmetics company's latest financial results show a
continuing turnaround in profitability that analysts say could
suffer a slight setback by the prospective slump in fourth-quarter
U.S. sales.
   Avon earned $34.6 million, or 46 cents a share, in the three
months ended Sept. 30 compared to a loss of $405.9 million, or
$7.78 a share, in the third 1988 quarter, when the company took a
$425 million after-tax charge for discontinued operations.

   The head of the 800,000-member National
Association of Realtors offered the organization's support Friday
to President Bush's $4.2 billion plan to help the poor and homeless.
   ``We're very much in favor of all the things he said,'' outgoing
president Ira Gribin said after Bush unveiled the plan in a speech
to the association.
   ``This was the kind of thing we were looking for,'' Gribin said.
``It sounds like he has bought into ... a lot of the things''
suggested by Jack Kemp, secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
   Kemp, who accompanied Bush to Dallas, was given a standing
ovation by the Realtors when introduced to the 4,800 people at the
meeting.
   Earlier Friday, Gribin had called on the Bush Administration to
provide leadership to re-establish affordable housing as a national
goal.
   ``This country is fundamentally moving away from an
affordability situation and the reaffirmation of a national housing
policy,'' Gribin, a real estate agent from Encino, Calif., told
reporters.
   ``We need to get back on that because otherwise your kids and my
kids and our grandchildren are not going to be able to own houses.''
   Parts of Bush's program mirrors suggestions made by the
Realtors, including allowing money to be withdrawn without penalty
from Individual Retirement Accounts to make down payments on homes.
   Earlier Gribin had suggested grandparents, in-laws and parents
be allowed to dip into IRA savings to help the next generation of
first-time home buyers. Gribin said the Realtors would continue to
work on legislation to broaden the IRA availability.
   Also, Gribin called for replacing current limits on Federal
Housing Administration loans with a sliding scale tying them to
house prices in specific regions.
   Congress recently passed legislation raising FHA loan limits to
$124,878. Gribin said the limit still is too low in 10 of the
nation's largest 13 metropolitan areas, locking out first-time and
low-income home buyers.
   A study by the Realtors showed that more than half of FHA- and
Veterans Administration-backed loans are for entry-level buyers.
   Gribin said the limit should be set at 95 percent of the current
median price in a given market.

<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Events raced ahead of would-be industrial
policymakers this past week as U.S. semiconductor companies made
deals with IBM and the Japanese.
   While Congress was holding hearings on the health of the vital
U.S. chip industry, the chip makers themselves were out fending for
themselves as best they could, with mixed results.
   The week's developments again raised the question of whether
government agencies and blue-chip industry panels were either quick
enough or patient enough to make a real contribution to the global
battle for industrial supremacy.
   Conservative skeptics say government-led industrial policy is
fated to failure, while supporters say it could work if Americans
only learned to do it right. So far, though, both sides agree that
the awkward early efforts are being outpaced by the real world of
business.
   Three things happened this past Wednesday that illustrated
different dimensions of the issue:
   _U.S. chip makers said they had reached an agreement with
Japanese electronics companies that eventually could allow the
Americans to make customized chips for the next generation of
Japanese televisions.
   _International Business Machines Corp. said it would license the
technology for making its most powerful computer memory chip to
Micron Technology Inc. of Boise, Idaho.
   _And in Washington, the head of the government-supported chip
consortium Sematech told a congressional committee that the U.S.
effort to regain supremacy in chips is in jeopardy. The statement
from Robert Noyce came as talk circulated that the Bush
administration wants to cut back on some research projects,
including Sematech.
   In part, the deal between U.S. chipmakers and Japanese companies
was a rare victory for U.S. government efforts to get a bigger
share of the Japanese chip market. But it also illustrated that the
United States continues to negotiate from a position of weakness.
   American companies will get from Japan the information they need
to design chips for the Japanese. But there is no guarantee that
Japan actually will buy American-made chips.
   The U.S. chip makers would like to make circuits for
American-made high-definition televisions as well, although the
Bush administration's decision not to make a full-fledged
commitment to HDTV could bog down development of that technology.
   ``Businesses are going to move forward whether the government
does or not,'' said Jeanne Alford, a spokeswoman for the
Semiconductor Industry Association.
   IBM made its deal with Micron Technologies to ensure that there
would be another source of U.S.-made memory chips. IBM said it also
intended to supply its technology to a chip-making consortium
called U.S. Memories Inc., of which it is a strong backer.
   Unfortunately for industrial policy mavens, U.S. Memories has
been slow to get off the ground since its inception in June.
Critics say a joint manufacturing venture won't work. And they say
that IBM through its deal with Micron has essentially made U.S.
Memories unnecessary, something IBM disputes.
   Most disheartening to the supporters of industrial policy were
impressions, perhaps unfounded, that the Bush administration's
commitment to Sematech and the U.S.-Japanese chip trade agreement
was waning at a critical time.
   Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., said his office had gotten leaks
saying ``high administration officials are conducting a
slash-and-burn campaign seeking to systematically eliminate most of
the major initiatives designed to return this country to the
industrial cutting edge.''
   ``What I find marvelous about our government is that they
criticize business for being short-sighted, then they show
incredible volatility in programs that take five years or more to
play out,'' said William Finan, a managing director of the
Washington consulting firm of Quick, Finan &amp; Associates.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Ford Motor Co. Chairman Donald Petersen, who guided the company
to record profitability during the late 1980s, announced he will
retire March 1. Vice Chairman Harold Poling is slated to take the
helm of the nation's second-largest automaker.
   _The Federal Reserve eased credit to counter a slowdown in the
economy, which was marked by layoffs at several major companies.
But the signs of weakness were countered by a Labor Department
report that wholesale prices rose 0.4 percent in October.
   _East Germany opened the Berlin Wall and gave its citizens
permission to freely cross the rest of its borders in a move that
experts said would have immediate benefits for American companies
in West Germany _ although the short-term prospects for U.S.
multinationals in East Germany were uncertain.

   The latest easing of credit by the Federal
Reserve has been greeted with something short of all-out elation on
Wall Street.
   Just about every Fed-watcher in the financial world agreed that
the Fed sent out signals this past week that it was relaxing its
credit policy further, continuing a series of moves in that
direction over the past several months.
   But analysts' readings of the motivations for that step were not
so unanimous.
   The first, and most popular, interpretation was that the Fed was
satisfied with the progress of recent efforts to keep inflation in
check, and saw a chance to cushion the potential impact of a
slowing economy.
   That view offered reassurance to investors who have been worried
that the recent dropoff in corporate earnings might be a portent of
more bad news to come on profits and a possible recession in early
1990.
   Some observers, however, suggested that it wasn't inflation that
was uppermost in Fed policymakers' minds, but rather concern in
some form about a possible deflationary situation.
   Since late summer many a wary eye has been focused on the market
for junk bonds, high-yielding securities used to finance buyouts
and other deals, amid signs that the lending boom of the late 1980s
might be ending.
   At the same time, a massive campaign continues to unscramble the
problems of the nation's network of savings institutions.
   And less specific worries lately have been voiced about the
potential effects of weak real estate markets in places such as the
Northeast, where the market for properties had been rising for a
long time.
   ``The Federal Reserve does not need a new credit crisis,'' said
James Grant in the issue published Friday of his newsletter Grant's
Interest Rate Observer.
   Grant posited the theory that ``inflation is guiding monetary
policy in most of the world's financial centers, but deflation is
calling the tune in ours.''
   Such talk, combined with worries about profit disappointments at
many companies, kept the stock market on the defensive in the past
week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 3.90 to 2,625.61.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.62 to 187.90;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
2.82 to 455.79, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was down 0.32 at 371.47.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 148.76 million shares a day,
against 148.18 million the week before.
   The potential hazards of ``leverage'' _ large amounts of debt in
many forms _ in the American economy have been debated on Wall
Street for years.
   But lately there have been several signs that concern about the
situation has been increasing.
   For one thing, the calm news on inflation of late would not
explain why the prices of gold and gold-mining stocks have rallied
in recent days. But heightened worries about deflation could well
account for the upswing in precious metals.
   Published commentaries by several brokerage firms have recently
broached the term ``financial distress.''
   ``Some of the words that define financial distress seem
appropriate today,'' observed Hugh Johnson at First Albany Corp. in
Albany, N.Y. ``They would include uneasiness, apprehension,
tension, stringency, pressure, uncertainty and fragility.''
   Some of the main concerns Johnson cites touch on a familiar
theme: ``As the economy slows, highly leveraged companies will have
difficulty making debt service payments, and `investors' will have
difficulty in arranging for financing to acquire companies.
   ``From time to time,'' he says, there are likely to be ``shocks
to the financial system.
   ``Fortunately,'' he adds, ``we feel that they, for the most
part, are manageable _ if many shocks do not occur simultaneously.
Financial distress and rising stock prices are not mutually
exclusive.''

<HEAD>Grain and Soybeans Prices Jump Despite Bearish Crop Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures surged higher Friday on the Chicago
Board of Trade as buyers shrugged off increased estimates of the
nation's corn and soybean crop production.
   On other markets, precious metals and copper declined, sugar
rose, energy futures were lower, and livestock and pork futures
were mixed.
   Wheat settled 1\ cents to 5} cents higher with the contract for
delivery in December at $4.04{ a bushel; corn was a \ cent to 1{
cents higher with December at $2.38 a bushel; oats were } cent to
1\ cents higher with December at $1.43\ a bushel; soybeans were 4}
cents to 8{ cents higher with November at $5.75} a bushel.
   Corn prices were higher from the opening of trading as
commercial buyers entered the market on reports the Soviet Union
may buy 1.5 million metric tons.
   ``You can forget the production numbers,'' said analyst Mickey
Luth of Sherson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago. ``The figures have
no meaning at all. What matters is the news flow, producer sales
and export sales.''
   The crop report released Thursday by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture estimated the 1989 corn harvest at 7.59 billion
bushels, up 2 percent from the previous estimate, and soybean
production at 1.94 billion bushels, 1 percent above the October
estimate.
   Some analysts had predicted the crop report would trigger a
Friday selloff, with export demand offering some support to prices.
   Soybean prices were higher on carryover strength from the corn
market and strong demand for soyoil. Prices also received support
from concern over delays in the planting of Brazil's soybean crop.
   Wheat prices were higher due to dryness in the winter wheat crop
areas.
   Precious metals prices dropped on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold was 40 cents to 50 cents lower with December at $388.60 a
troy ounce; silver was 4.4 cents to 4.9 cents lower with December
at $5.26 a troy ounce.
   Copper settled lower on the Comex amid uncertainty over the
amount of stocks in London Metal Exchange-approved warehouses.
There were forecasts earlier in the week of lower stocks, which
were replaced Friday by expectations of increased stocks.
   Copper was .60 cent to 1.25 cents lower with the contract in
December at $1.145 a pound.
   Supply concerns and worry that Brazil may have trouble meeting
its export obligations again boosted sugar prices on New York's
Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.
   Sugar was .17 cent to .24 cent higher with January at 14.50
cents a pound.
   Energy futures were lower in quiet trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Heating oil led crude oil and gasoline prices
lower in a drop attributed to seasonal pressures.
   ``Consumers usually put heating oil in the tank in October, just
as the weather is getting cold,'' said analyst Peter Beutel, of
Elders Futures Inc. in New York. ``They usually don't fill up again
until December. Making this usually a disappointing month for
heating oil.''
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 8 cents to 15 cents lower
with December at 19.84 cents a barrel; heating oil was .27 cent to
.47 cent lower with December at 58.45 a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .22 cent to .40 cent lower with December at 51.82 cents a
gallon.
   Livestock and pork futures were mixed in light trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle, although slightly higher, are in a holding pattern
because of a quiet cash market, said analyst Thomas Morgan of
Sterling Research Corp. in Arlington Heights, Ill.
   Hogs and pork belly prices were mixed, getting support from
lighter slaughter activity but coming under pressure from lower
cash prices, Morgan said.
   Live cattle were .07 cent to .17 cent higher with December at
74.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent lower to .17 cent
higher with November at 83.15 a pound; hogs were .30 cent lower to
43 cent higher with December at 47.95 a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .40 cent lower to .13 cent higher with February at 63.30 cents
a pound.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Little Changed in Light Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices finished little changed Friday in
light activity as many traders stayed out of the market for
Veterans Day.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond ended unchanged from
late Thursday, with its yield at 7.89 percent.
   Analysts said bond prices were little changed after the Federal
Reserve entered the market for a second day to drain reserves from
the banking system.
   The intervention, which began on Thursday, suggested that the
Fed does not want the key federal funds rate to fall below 8{
percent, said Elizabeth Reiners, vice president for money-market
research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``The Fed's move was a surprise. It will cause short-term yields
to rise because no one was forecasting'' the move, Ms. Reiners said.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 8] percent, unchanged from
late Thursday.
   Analysts said the Fed's draining action signaled a retreat from
a maneuver earlier in the week that had suggested the central bank
was relaxing its credit policy and encouraging lower interest
rates. On Monday and Tuesday, the central bank injected billions of
dollars of reserves into the market, pushing short-term interest
rates lower.
   Trading was light Friday, with many traders taking a long
weekend in observance of Veterans Day on Saturday.
   Bond prices also were unaffected by Friday's Treasury auction of
$10 billion in short-term debt, in the form of 36-day cash
management bills. The bills carried a discount interest rate of
8.14 percent and an equivalent coupon interest rate of 8.32 percent.
   ``You can't read too much into that,'' said Mitchell Held, chief
financial economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term government issues edged down 1-32 point, intermediate
maturities were unchanged to 1-32 point lower and longer-term
issues were 1-32 point lower to 1-32 point higher, according to
figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, slipped 0.22 to 1,193.35.
   In corporate trading, industrials rose. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of
80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, edged
up 0.11 to 338.63.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds was at 9219-32, up 1-32. The average yield
to maturity was 7.34 percent, unchanged from late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.96 percent as the
discount gained 2 basis points to 7.71 percent. Yields on six-month
bills were unchanged at 7.97 percent as the discount remained
stable at 7.57 percent. Yields on one-year bills were flat at 7.81
percent as the discount remained unchanged at 7.30 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.

<HEAD>Texas Eastern Officials Resign After Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three senior executives of Texas Eastern Corp., a
subsidiary of oil company Panhandle Eastern Corp., announced Friday
they are resigning at year's end.
   Officials of Houston-based Panhandle Eastern said the
resignations had been expected after the company purchased Texas
Eastern last April.
   Dennis R. Hendrix, president and chief executive officer of
Texas Eastern, and Paul M. Anderson, senior vice president, said
they plan to pursue other interests after Dec. 31, but will
continue to assist with post-merger related activities. Executive
Vice President Derrill Cody will join the Oklahoma City law firm of
McKinney, Stringer and Webster.
   ``The resignations are of a routine nature as a result of the
acquisition of Texas Eastern into the Panhandle Eastern system,''
said spokesman Mack Price. Many other Texas Eastern employees have
been offered early retirement or severance packages to be taken by
Dec. 31, he said.
   Sixty-year-old Panhandle Eastern acquired Texas Eastern in April
to begin operating one of the largest interstate natural gas
pipeline systems in the United States. The company's operating
units provide natural gas to the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and
Northeast regions.
   Price said that since the merger, Panhandle Eastern has been
working to sell Texas Eastern's assets other than pipelines.
   ``Those assets have included, so far, the exploration and
production activities of Texas Eastern, their refinery activities,
their interests in liquid petroleum gas, their real estate
interests like Houston Center, and other investment activities,''
Price said.
   Hendrix and Anderson will act as consultants in those
negotiations, he said.
   ``Panhandle Eastern's success in absorbing Texas Eastern is
based in large part on the efforts of Dennis Hendrix and his
associates. They have agreed to continue helping Panhandle where
they can, and we will continue to rely on them,'' said R.D.
Hunsucker, chairman and chief executive officer of Panhandle
Eastern.
   ``Hendrix, Cody, Anderson and others have been key participants
in the asset sales which have contributed to the significant
reduction in Panhandle Eastern's acquisition-related debt,'' he
said. ``Under arrangements made in conjunction with their
departures, several of these executives will retain major
responsibilities for the continued success of Panhandle's
divestiture strategy.''

<HEAD>U.S. Companies Watching Events In East Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opening of the Berlin Wall and lifting of
travel restrictions on East German citizens could have immediate
benefits for American companies in West Germany, although
short-term prospects for U.S. multinationals to expand into East
Germany are unclear, experts said Friday.
   Any move to the East by American and other multinationals won't
happen overnight without a change in the current political
structure of the communist nation, but sweeping changes could occur
in the next decade.
   ``Within the next five years, we will start to see noticeable
and significant flows of money and goods from west to east,'' said
Ed Yardeni, economist with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Woolworth Corp., the retailer that has done business in West
Berlin for 65 years, said the flow of thousands of East Berliners
across the border this week already had boosted sales of its West
German operations.
   ``They're already shopping at our stores. They've been very
crowded in the last 24 hours,'' said Roy L. Garofalo, Woolworth's
vice president of investor relations in New York.
   ``They're not wealthy people, but many may have savings because
there was nothing to buy in East Germany.''
   Woolworth has 225 general merchandise stores in West Germany,
including 24 in West Berlin.
   Woolworth stock rose $3.25 to $60.87{ a share Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange on what one analyst attributed to positive
sentiment about the political events in East Germany.
   Elsewhere on Wall Street, Germany Fund recorded one of the day's
biggest percentage gains. The fund finished up $2.75 at $13.50 a
share as the West German stock market, where the fund invests,
responded to the opening of the East German borders.
   Officials of Ford Motor Co., which has been in West Germany
since 1925, said they were watching closely as events unfolded.
   Vice Chairman Harold Poling, who will become chairman and chief
executive of Ford on March 1, said the world's second largest
automobile maker was looking at ``all the opportunities.''
   Ford has manufacturing and assembly operations throughout West
Germany that employ about 37,500 people.
   Analysts said the opening of East Germany and recent events in
Poland and Hungary point to tremendous opportunities for Americans
and other industrialists around the world. But any increased
business in the Eastern Bloc nations will depend on the timing of
political reforms, strategists said.
   ``They will need a new political structure before anyone will
know what to do,'' said Lawrence A. Veit, international economist
with Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co.
   ``It will be negative for the defense industry but positive, a
larger positive, for all other companies,'' Veit said.
   West German companies will have the competitive edge in the
Eastern Bloc once the reforms get under way, economists said.
Multinational companies already doing business in West Germany will
be positioned to enter the East German market behind the West
Germans but American companies will get a fair share of the market
if they move aggressively, Yardeni said.
   ``The rush to invest in Eastern Europe ... will depend on how
quickly Western money and Western capitalists are willing to move
in...,'' he said.
   Woolworth's Garofalo said that as recently as six weeks ago
Woolworth officials were in East Germany to explore future
opportunities.
   ``There was some writing on the wall even a few weeks ago,'' he
said.
   But any move into East Germany is still at least two years away,
Garofalo said.

<HEAD>Du Pont Denied Motion to Block Research Company's Dividends</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Delaware Chancery Court judge has
denied a motion sought by the Du Pont Co. to prohibit a research
company from paying its dividends. The companies are in a joint
venture that has gone sour.
   In a ruling issued earlier this week, Vice Chancellor Jack B.
Jacobs denied a preliminary injunction sought by Du Pont against
Hem Research Inc.
   Neither company returned telephone calls late Friday afternoon.
   Du Pont and Hem, which has headquarters in Philadelphia, formed
a joint venture in 1987 for the development, marketing and
distribution of a drug called ampligen, which they said would be
used in treating acquired immune deficiency syndrome and cancer.
   But in April, Du Pont filed suit in Chancery Court, seeking $30
million and an end to the joint venture. The suit alleged Hem
misrepresented the effectiveness of ampligen and sought the
preliminary injunction to block payment of dividends.
   Chancellor William Allen denied the request to end the joint
venture, saying Chancery Court had no jurisdiction over that issue.
   The court, however, indicated it could rule on the issue of the
dividends.
   Du Pont had claimed in its motion that Hem would become
insolvent if it paid its dividends and other business charges.
   Jacobs said Du Pont's argument was ``factually unsupported and
legally unsound.''
   ``Hem is not presently insolvent, and the proposed dividend and
other payments will not render it insolvent,'' Jacobs said.
   As of Dec. 31, 1988, Hem had a net worth of $8.5 million. The
proposed dividends and other payments were about $1.154 million.

<HEAD>Economist: McDonald's Promotion Pushing Pork Prices Slightly Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonald's Corp.'s nationwide promotion
of McRib barbecued pork sandwiches has helped prop up prices in the
nation's hog markets, an economist says.
   Economist Glenn Grimes at the University of Missouri says that
if the 8,000-restaurant fast-food chain makes the sandwich a
permanent part of the menu it would open a significant new market
for pork.
   But he adds that would translate into long-term support for
higher prices only if producers break with traditional practice and
refuse to increase hog production in response to the increased
demand.
   If past experience is any guide, he says, hog farmers will raise
more pigs in anticipation of increased sales to McDonald's.
   ``Five years from now, we'd have basically the same hog price if
they (McDonald's) did it or not,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   McRib made its debut in several test markets earlier in the
1980s and was revived last month for a nationwide test.
   McDonald's is not disclosing its plans for McRib once a
month-long national advertising campaign for the sandwiches ends
Nov. 20. But public relations consultant Russ Klettke said Friday
that ``the sales are going well. The feeling is very optimistic.''
   He said preliminary figures on the performance of the sandwich
are as yet unreliable, and that even if meaningful results were
available, the company would not want them made public because of
competition.
   When the promotion was launched last month, McDonald's said it
planned to serve 80 million of the four-ounce boneless shoulder
cuts, which are prepared in a hickory-flavored sauce with pickles
and onions on a home-style roll.
   Klettke said McDonald's not only would analyze the performance
of McRib but the impact of its sales on the sales of its other
sandwiches and whether there are regional trends in sales. He also
said analysts would consider whether the product might have
seasonal or year-round appeal.
   The promotion, which began Oct. 20, will run for four to six
weeks, depending on the market, even though the national
advertising ends after one month, Klettke said.
   Grimes, who specializes in the pork industry, estimates the
promotion is using 1.5 percent to 2.3 percent of the current supply
of hogs nationwide.
   Each 1 percent change in supplies influences prices of live hogs
by 1.85 percent to 2 percent, Grimes said. He estimated the added
demand for a limited supply of hogs is bidding up the price of live
hogs by about 1.25 cents to 1.85 cents a pound.
   The restaurant chain already serves bacon, sausage and Canadian
bacon as part of its breakfast menu. It also is experimenting with
pizza, which could have sausage, pepperoni or other pork toppings.

   Oil futures prices closed lower in thin volume
Friday as a late round of selling wiped out slight gains earlier in
the day.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange the December contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, fell 8
cents to finish at $19.84 a 42-gallon barrel. The contract for
January delivery closed down 11 cents at $19.67 a barrel.
   Both contracts had modest gains in the previous session, largely
on technical factors.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale
unleaded gasoline for December lost 0.40 cent to 51.82 cents a
gallon and January fell 0.26 cent to 52.54 cents a gallon.
   No. 2 heating oil for December ended 0.47 cent lower at 58.45
cents a gallon, while the contract for January delivery slipped
0.33 cent to 58.62 cents.
   Crude prices have moved in a fairly narrow range in recent days
as market players turn their attention increasingly to reports of
overproduction by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Analysts say that while investors are concerned about reports of
higher production and lower demand, they are reluctant to push
prices much lower in advance of the Nov. 25 meeting of the cartel
in Vienna, Austria.
   OPEC is expected to discuss production strategy for 1990 as well
as reallocation of output quotas at the meeting.

   Imperial Oil Ltd.'s proposed takeover of Texaco
Canada Inc. won't be approved until a better deal is worked out to
protect competition, the federal Competition Tribunal said Friday
in a preliminary decision.
   The deal, worth 5 billion Canadian dollars, would be the
second-largest corporate takeover in Canada's history. Imperial Oil
and Texaco Canada both are subsidiaries of U.S. companies: Imperial
Oil is owned by Exxon Corp. and Texaco Canada by Texaco Inc.
   Tribunal Chairman Barbara Reed said a deal Imperial Oil worked
out with the federal competition bureau to sell off 611 gasoline
stations and other assets didn't go far enough in several areas.
   However, she indicated that if Imperial and the bureau can work
out a better deal, the tribunal could still give the merger a green
light.
   ``We are not prepared to approve the consent order in its
present terms,'' Ms. Reed said in her decision _ the most dramatic
since the Competition Act was made stricter in 1986.
   A month-long hearing into the proposed takeover ended Wednesday
with a warning from the Consumers' Association of Canada that the
deal would cost motorists at the gasoline pump.
   Ms. Reed, who delivered the sometimes harshly worded verbal
decision, said she wanted to give Imperial Oil a quick indication
of where it stands. The deal has been awaiting federal approval
since it was struck in January.
   She criticized Calvin Goldman, former director of the bureau,
for his handling of the merger, especially for allowing Imperial
Oil and Texaco Canada to start operating like one company before
the tribunal ruled.
   The two companies have been running a joint advertising
campaign, for example.

   Bicoastal Corp., formerly Singer Co. headed
by onetime corporate raider Paul Bilzerian, filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection Friday following a tumultuous two years of
legal battles and divestments.
   A company annoucement said Bicoastal expects to file a
reorganization plan soon seeking to ``provide for the payment of
valid creditors and provide a method to resolve disputed claims.''
   Bicoastal said the filing does not affect its remaining
subsidiaries, which include makers of aircraft and nuclear plant
training simulators and weapons control systems.
   Officials at Tampa-based Bicoastal could not be reached late
Friday.
   Singer, renamed earlier this year, was acquired by Bilzerian in
January 1988 in a $1.06 billion takeover. Bilzerian sold off eight
of the company's 12 divisions, including some of the most
profitable, and sparked a flood of employee lawsuits and other
litigation, estimated to exceed $500 million.
   In June, Bilzerian was convicted on nine counts of securities
fraud, conspiracy to commit tax fraud and making false statements
to the government. Three months later, he was sentenced to a
four-year prison term and fined $1.5 million.
   It is uncertain how the bankruptcy filing will affect the
reported $75 million purchase of Mesa Limited Partnership's
interest in Bicoastal.
   The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that New York-based
Leucadia National Corp. agreed in principle to buy the stock and
notes Mesa acquired in connection with Bilzerian's takeover.
   Mesa, an Amarillo, Texas-based partnership headed by raider T.
Boone Pickens, loaned Bilzerian's group $150 million and negotiated
an option to take control of the Singer board if the company failed
by pay the entire loan plus interest by April 1, 1989. The date was
later extended to July 1.
   The pact could give Leucadia control of the board of Bicoastal,
a 138-year-old company that grew from a sewing machine manufacturer
to a major defense contractor.
   There was no answer at Leucadia's New York office late Friday.
   In May, U.S. District Court Judge Herbert Murray in Baltimore
placed an injunction against transfer of any major Singer assets
without court approval.
   Murray's action came after the government filed a $231 million
defense-contract overcharge suit.

   The union representing United Airlines' pilots
said Friday it has urged its members to support its continued
efforts to gain control of parent company, UAL Corp.
   The pilots' union also disclosed that since a pilot-management
bid for the airline failed last month, it has ``had conservations''
with Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis, who previously bid for
UAL, New York investor Saul Steinberg, the investment firm Coniston
Partners and ``other financial investors.''
   The union also said spoken with the machinists' union and would
have further discussions.
   The letter did not elaborate on any of the discussions and a
spokesman for the pilots' union did not return calls Friday.
   UAL declined to comment on the latest development, said
spokeswoman Sara Dornacker.
   In trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, UAL rose $4.25
a share to $189.50.
   The Air Line Pilots Association leadership released a letter,
sent Thursday, urging members to strictly enforce their existing
labor contract beginning Nov. 22, when a self-imposed deadline on
voluntary labor concessions expires.
   The pilots are seeking a new contract to replace the one that
expired in April 1988. However, the pilots leadership stated in the
letter that continued takeover moves toward UAL made it doubtful an
agreement could be reached soon.
   ``Given that the company is obviously `in play' we see no way
that management will get serious about an equitable new contract
... unless it knows who is going to own the company,'' the letter
said. ``In our view, the piece of trash that the company recently
passed across the table clearly proves that fact.
   ``Unless the entire world clearly understands what we contribute
or don't contribute to the operation of the airline we will have
little chance of getting either an equitable new contract or an
appropriate new (employee stock ownership proposal) to be put to
the Board and accepted.''
   It called on pilots to prepare to stop flying United's new 747
model 400s and working four extra hours a month. The pilots had
been doing both as a show of good faith during its participation in
a pilot-management bid for the airline.
   Pilots and management signed a merger agreement with UAL's board
in September. As a show of good faith, pilots said they would fly
United's 747 model 400s they previously would not fly and work an
85-hour work-month, rather than the 81 hours stipulated in their
contract. The pilots had refused to fly the model 400s because of a
dispute over how many crew members should be used.
   When the deal fell apart in October when the group was unable to
obtain financing for its $6.75 billion offer, the employee group
again approached the board with a framework for a restructured
transaction, but the board at that time terminated the
negotiations, the union said.
   ``We intend to work intensively over the next two weeks ... to
put together a new transaction so that the new owners of UAL will
in fact be the employees and not some unwanted outsider,'' the
pilots' union said in the letter.
   Earlier this week, the UAL board reportedly authorized chairman
Stephen Wolf to explore new means of mounting a buyout or
recapitalization of the company.
   On Wednesday, Coniston Partners, which has accumulated a 9.7
percent stake in UAL, met with machinists of United to detail their
intentions for the company. Coniston has said it intends to oust
most of UAL's board.
   The machinists had declined to join an effort by United pilots,
flight attendants and management for employee ownership of the
airline.
