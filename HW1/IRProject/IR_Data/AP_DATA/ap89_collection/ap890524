<HEAD>Report: Soviets Pulling Back From Threat to Stop Destroying SS-23</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviets have pulled back from a recent
threat to stop destroying a missile covered by last year's treaty
covering medium-range nuclear missiles, The Washington Post
reported in its Thursday editions.
   The missile is the SS-23, one of the weapons that will be taken
apart under the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces pact that went
into effect last year.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze had told journalists
in Bonn recently that Soviet destruction of the SS-23s might be
halted if NATO deployed a similar type of missile.
   The SS-23 has a range of slightly more than 300 miles, the
minimum distance set by the INF treaty. The United States and its
western allies are considering deployment of a new Lance missile
with a range just under the limit set by the treaty.
   The Soviets have gone ahead and moved almost two dozen SS-23s
from a storage site to an elimination site, the Post reported,
quoting unnamed U.S. and Soviet sources.
   All the SS-23s must be destroyed by Dec. 31, but ample time
remains to meet the deadline, the officials said. While the Soviets
haven't yet destroyed any of the 239 SS-23s deployed before the
pact took effect, they have destroyed training missiles and
launchers, the Post said.

   Navy investigators have found evidence to
support the possibility that murder or suicide was involved in the
explosion that killed 47 sailors aboard the battleship USS Iowa,
NBC News reported Wednesday.
   NBC quoted unidentified Navy sources as disclosing ``some
disturbing facts'' about a surviving sailor who stands to collect
$100,000 from the insurance policy of a gunner's mate killed in the
explosion April 19.
   Investigators found gunpower and blasting caps in a search of
the belongings of Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall Truitt, 21, two
years ago after he was arrested for stealing a car, NBC said. In a
search of his home after the explosion, investigators found one of
the burlap patches that gunners insert between bags of powder to
clean the barrels of the battleship's huge guns during firing, the
network said.
   Truitt was quoted in published reports last week as saying the
Navy created homicide or suicide scenarios involving him and
Clayton M. Hartwig, 25, to make them scapegoats for an explosion
investigators cannot otherwise explain.
   Truitt has denied any blame for the explosion, and has said that
in response to investigators' questions, he denied a homosexual
relationship with Hartwig.
   NBC said that because the Navy has failed to find an accidental
cause for the explosion, it believes it may have been caused
deliberately through placement of a detonating device in one of the
burlap patches, which normally would have been handled by Hartwig.
   However, his sister, Kathleen Kubicina, said Wednesday night
that reports that Hartwig helped load the fatal shell were
inaccurate.
   ``My brother wasn't on the duty roster that day,'' Mrs. Kubicina
said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press in
Cleveland. ``He was in the turret but he was not on duty that day.''
   She said she has talked to a Naval Investigative Service
investigator looking into the accident.
   Hartwig's family told NBC that he was depressed when his
friendship with Truitt broke down last year. The family also said
that at age 17, Hartwig threatened suicide when another
relationship ended, NBC said.
   NBC said other sources, which it did not identify, have learned
that before the Iowa went on maneuvers off Puerto Rico, Hartwig
wrote several letters that could be construed as farewell messages.
   Mrs. Kubicina said her brother was not a homosexual.
   ``He was a loner,'' Mrs. Kubicina said in an interview with The
Associated Press. ``He did a lot of reading.
   ``He wanted to be in the Navy,'' she said. ``My dad was a
gunner's mate on destroyer in World War II.''
   Mrs. Kubicina said earlier Wednesday that she is contesting the
fairness of Truitt collecting $100,000 from her brother's insurance
policy.
   A Naval Investigative Service agent told Mrs. Kubicina that
Hartwig's insurance policy, which listed Truitt as its beneficiary,
would not be paid until the Navy completes its investigation of the
explosion.
   She said NIS agents have visited her and her family four times
since the explosion to question them about Hartwig and his
relationship with Truitt.
   Earl Hartwig said his son and Truitt took out $50,000 policies
from the Navy credit union just before their battleship left
Norfolk for the Persian Gulf in 1987. The policies carried double
indemnities for accidental death, making Truitt's payout $100,000.
   Truitt had dropped Hartwig, however, as the beneficiary on his
policy, said Earl Hartwig.
   Mrs. Kubicina said a close friendship between the two men waned
because Truitt was married last year and his wife did not care for
Hartwig. She said Hartwig intended to change his beneficiary, too.
   ``I'm sure he had all intentions of changing it. I'm sure of
it,'' she said. ``He had made comments to myself and my parents.''
   The Hartwigs will receive a $50,000 payout on a separate
government life insurance policy.
   Atlantic Fleet headquarters in Norfolk, Va., referred questions
about the case to the Navy Office of Information in Washington. Lt.
Bruce Cole of the information office said the investigation of the
blast was continuing and ``nothing is categorically rejected.''
   The Atlantic Fleet would not provide information on how to
contact Truitt, who has denied any wrongdoing in connection with
the explosion.
   ``In my opinion, they have no idea what's going on, what caused
it,'' Truitt told the Newport News Daily Press and the Times-Herald
in a story published Sunday. ``I think they're trying to find an
easy way out.''
   Truitt said he is used to being a scapegoat and that he and
Hartwig often had been harrassed by fellow sailors ``because
neither one of us drinks. ... They razz you if you're not out there
with them getting trashed.''
   Mrs. Kubicina said she did not intend to raise the possibility
that the explosion was caused deliberately.
   ``I don't wany anyone to think, including Ken, that I think he
was a murderer,'' she said by phone from her home. ``I don't think
so. Truthfully, honestly, I don't know the man.''

   Kazuo Okuyama began his career with typical
Japanese movie fare: gangster and cute animal movies.
   Now the ambitious young producer hopes to inspire jaded Japanese
with the tragedy of an idealistic rebellion in 1936 which tried to
install a military government under the late Emperor Hirohito.
   Okayama's problem in making the film, due for release June 17,
has been that the attempted coup by 22 fervent young right-wing
military officers was quashed under orders of Hirohito himself, who
was then revered as a living god.
   The emperor isn't portrayed in the film, but his order against
the young rebels, whom Okuyama describes as martyrs, is depicted as
a misjudgment that ultimately led Japan into World War II, the
producer said.
   Reflections on the emperor's judgment and the question of his
responsibility for the war are acutely sensitive here, although
discussion of Hirohito's historical role has become freer since his
death Jan. 7 at age 87.
   Historians generally agree Hirohito was a figurehead, wielding
little real power. His most famous decision was Japan's World War
II surrender in 1945, when the government was deadlocked over the
issue.
   But Hirohito also ordered the 1936 leaders of the coup back to
their barracks after two days of assassinations and political
turmoil in the ``2-26 Incident,'' so called because it was launched
on Feb. 26.
   Several coup leaders committed suicide, and others were
imprisoned. On July 12, 1936, two civilians and 13 of the rebel
officers were executed by firing squad.
   Okuyama's movie, ``2-26'' tells the story of the young officers
who led about 1,500 soldiers and nine civilians in a bloody attempt
to overthrow the government and install a military regime under
Hirohito.
   The rebels claimed they sought to restore integrity to a nation
they believed was corrupted by a political elite living in luxury
while millions suffered Depression-era deprivation. Many of the
rebels, historians say, were sons of poor farm families who had
suffered hunger and seen their sisters sold into prostitution.
   But in the repressive atmosphere after the failed coup, an
opposing faction in the military used the incident to build its own
power, eventually establishing a militaristic regime that led Japan
into World War II.
   ``There was an energy and an intensity alive then that has been
forgotten in today's Japan,'' the 35-year-old producer said.
   ``One main reason I wanted to produce this film is because we
live in a similar era, when young women prostitute themselves and
revelations of political corruption surface every day,'' said
Okuyama. ``The only difference is that then we were poor and now
we're rich.''
   The film is coming out amid outrage over a scandal in which 14
prominent bureaucrats and businessmen have been arrested on
suspicion of bribery and other illegalities, and more than 150
people embarrassed by disclosures that they accepted unlisted
shares at discount prices from an employment information firm.
   ``I wanted to sound an alarm, to use the tragedy and drama of
the 2-26 incident to tell people what they don't want to hear about
political corruption and decay,'' Okuyama said.
   ``Influential people are gathering dirty money. Like the martyrs
of 2-26, people should care.''
   The film depicts the deaths of the coup leaders as a tragic loss
of courageous young men who died still true to their ideals.
   ``Even though the emperor doesn't understand that we were right,
history will answer for us,'' says one coup leader before putting a
bullet in his head.
   Okuyama said in an interview that he knew a decade ago that
there was material to make a good movie, but it just wasn't
possible because of a lack of funds, and sensitivities about the
emperor.
   The screenwriter didn't want to get involved, he said, but
``finally agreed on the condition we play down politics and aim the
movie more toward young people.''
   Corporate backers also feared a backlash from right-wing groups
that vociferously protest anything they interpret as disrespectful
toward the imperial family.
   ``When we get to the last print, just before distribution, we
plan to show the film to some of the major right-wing groups to try
to gain their understanding,'' Okuyama said.
   But he still expects some trouble. ``Actually, I'm very worried
just now, very afraid. But even if there's controversy, I think I
can explain what we're trying to do.''
   The film ends on a note the rightists should appreciate: a clash
of gongs and ``Tenno Heika Banzai,'' or ``Long Live the Emperor.''

<DATELINE>SIWA OASIS, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The temple of the Siwan Oracle, where
the superstitious young conqueror Alexander the Great was told he
was a god, sits in ruin on its hillside perch.
   Shali, a majestic 13th-century fortress that protected Siwans
from medieval Bedouin marauders, is a sandcastle of rubble,
stripped of its glory by neglect and the oasis' infrequent but
devastating desert rains.
   The village silversmith is gone, along with most of the
elaborate jewelry he crafted _ gigantic bangles that jingled from
the oasis' richly costumed women.
   Berber and Sudanese heritage have blended into Siwan life, along
with other tongues and cultures carried over Saharan sands to form
its roots and distinct language.
   So much made Siwa, only 85 miles from Libya, unique in Egypt,
and much of that is gone.
   But much is left.
   As it has for a thousand years, life in Siwa begins before dawn
with the muezzim calling Moslems to prayer from minarets of mosques
scattered through the oasis' date palms and olive groves.
   Then a donkey serenade begins. Hundreds bray, echoing through
the palms, followed by a chorus of roosters.
   Early-morning markets open to the cloppety-clop of donkeys
pulling kerussahs, family carts driven by caftan-wearing men or
boys. Wives and mothers covered head-to-toe in flowing blue
embroidered shawls called milayah sit behind with smaller children.
   Covered kerussahs provide the local taxi service, sharing bumpy
roadways with military trucks and, with increasing frequency,
tourist buses from Cairo.
   Camels never made it big in Siwa. Donkeys are cheaper.
   Until the early 1980s, virtually all sounds and sights in Siwa
would have been familiar to Siwans centuries earlier. But four
years ago a highway became the oasis' umbilical cord to Egypt and
the Arabic language.
   The three-hour, 190-mile drive from Mersa Matrouh on the western
Egyptian coast covers generally the same desert route over which,
2,000 years ago, people from around the Mediterranean _ Alexander
among them _ trekked for more than a week seeking the wisdom of the
famed desert oracle.
   More recently, buyers for chic boutiques in Cairo and Europe
have traveled it, taking with them the best jewelry and handicrafts.
   Siwans have been put on parade for an ever-growing number of
often scantily dressed visitors.
   Television invaded Siwa in 1986, and more than 1,000 sets were
sold the first week. Like their fellow Egyptians, Siwans go to bed
chatting about the latest plot twists of Falcon Crest or Knots
Landing.
   Young Siwans, now heading in increasing numbers for higher
education in Cairo and Alexandria, have far fewer traditions to
remember but many more influences to contemplate.
   But for Siwa's 10,000 inhabitants, the infusion and confusion
hasn't been all bad.
   A year-old U.S. aid project gives them clean water for the first
time. Extracted from salty subterranean pools, the desalinated
water costs 5 piasters (just over 2 cents) a jerrycan, which even
the poor can afford, instead of 75 piasters (30 cents) when water
was trucked from outside.
   Electricity supplies remain uncertain and sporadic, but
Czechoslavakian generators are being installed that promise a
constant power supply.
   One aid project is working to save Siwa's soul.
   More than a year ago, Marc Perron, then Canada's ambassador to
Egypt, asked Siwan officials what his country could do for their
changing oasis. Help us save our heritage, they said.
   ``Everybody talked for years about how to save Siwa, that its
cultural heritage must be saved, but nobody did anything about
it,'' said Heba el-Kholy, fund coordinator at the Canadian Embassy
in Cairo.
   The Canadian project aimed to build a traditional Siwan house in
the old way, using mudbrick and palm trunks and to teach young
women old skills.
   Now nearing completion, the two-story house going up in the
village garden will become a museum dedicated to Siwan culture and
a reservoir for handicrafts.
   Six miles away, in a poor desert village, Khadiga Ismail Sami
has spent the last year teaching five cheerful girls, aged 11 to
15, to embroider bridal scarves in the Siwan way. Siwan girls, who
marry about age 14, must have an extensive bridal trousseau,
including seven elaborate wedding dresses.
   Mrs. Sami is among nine women team leaders, each passing along
her sewing or basket-making artistry to five girls.
   The Canadian project has supplied each of Mrs. Sami's
apprentices material for bridal scarves, which can take several
months to complete.
   Once finished, she has the option of keeping them or selling
them back to the project for 5 Egyptian pounds (about $2) each.
   ``A bride has to have these scarves for her wedding,'' Mrs. Sami
said. ``If she has to buy them ready-made, she will have to pay 75
pounds ($30) for one scarf.''
   Miss el-Kholy, the Canadian co-ordinator, said she considers
both efforts a first step in saving Siwa's unique traditions.
   ``Young girls today prefer watching television to making
handicrafts,'' she said. ``But once we begin selling the products,
and the women can see the results, I believe the traditions won't
die.''

   The odds of two unrelated women sharing
the same birthdate and similar names are high enough.
   But they are partners to another quirk: they share Social
Security numbers.
   Elizabeth Carroll and Betty Gibson learned three weeks ago that
the Social Security Administration made a freakish mistake years
ago and assigned them the same number.
   Ms. Carroll, whose maiden name was Elizabeth Ann Smith, was the
first to learn about the mixup. When she was considering buying a
house, a mortgage company's printout of her credit history also
contained Ms. Gibson's, who was born Betty Ann Smith.
   Ms. Carroll took the question to the Social Security
Administration, which told her it stemmed from a clerical error in
the early 1970s.
   Ms. Carroll called Ms. Gibson to explain.
   ``I was dumbfounded,'' said Ms. Gibson. ``I couldn't understand
how two people could have the same Social Security number. I've had
this one since it was issued to me when I was a little girl.''
   Social Security officials declined to discuss the specifics of
this case, but did say such mistakes are rare.
   Frank Battistelli, a spokesman at the agency's Baltimore
headquarters, said he had heard of only one similar case.
   ``The other instance involved twins. By no stretch of the
imagination is this a commonplace occurrence,'' he said.
   Darryl Mull of the Social Security office in Atlanta said the
chances of two people receiving the same number are
``infinitesimal, but it does happen some times.''
   But that's of no comfort to the Ms. Carroll and Ms. Gibson.
   ``The thing that aggravates me is that I have to take time out
of my work schedule to solve their problem, their error,'' Ms.
Carroll said. ``I don't think that's fair. It's an error that
should never have occurred.''
   What happened is still unclear and the stories the women tell
differ with each other and the account provided by the Social
Security Administration.
   What is clear is that both women were born with similar names
and two years apart _ Ms. Carroll on Dec. 12, 1937, in Louisville
and Ms. Gibson on Dec. 12, 1939, in rural Alabama.
   Ms. Gibson, who moved to Kentucky at age 15, said she applied
for a number while seeking a job as a waitress at a Greyhound bus
station in Elizabethtown in 1954 or 1955. Ms. Carroll said she
applied for a number about the same time in Louisville.
   The only time Ms. Gibson said she applied for a new card was
when she got married in 1957. She says she never applied for
another new card in the early 1970s when Social Security officials
claim the error occurred.
   Ms. Carroll said she applied for a new card each time she got
married in 1962 and 1984.
   Ms. Carroll said Social Security officials told her that because
she had the number first she could keep her number and that Ms.
Gibson would have to apply for a new one.

<HEAD>Sunbathing Britons Bask in a Balmy May</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sun, so elusive in a British spring, has been
positively beaming down on the London area for so many rainless
days that people are in danger of forgetting where they put their
umbrellas.
   Much of the country is sharing the sunshine bonanza. So far, it
is the warmest May since 1964.
   London was the country's sweltriest spot Tuesday. The 84-degree
high made it the capital's hottest day in May since official
record-taking began in 1948.
   Temperatures of 82 degrees made the south coast towns of
Bournemouth and Southampton hotter at the weekend than Athens or
Tangier.
   It hasn't rained in London since a light shower fell May 13, and
the London Weather Center records .032 inches of rain so far _
against an average May rainfall of 2.02 inches.
   Raincoats hang at the back of the closet, Wellington boots are
buried by accumulating debris in the car trunk and eager barbecuers
have bought out the lawn furniture stocks in some stores and garden
centers.
   Opportunities like this do not arise very often for a nation of
picnickers. A good drenching is part of everybody's outdoor dining
experience, and the ability to hold on to your plate, your glass
and your humor while sprinting for shelter is a basic of British
sang-froid.
   Bookmaker William Hill says it faces a $170,000 payout if
temperatures exceed the 96.6-degree mark reached in 1976, and has
shortened its odds from 33-to-1 to 16-to-1.
   It would lose an additional $85,000 if the century's record high
of 98 degrees, set in 1911, is exceeded and has dropped odds
against this happening to 50-1, a spokesman said.
   Of course there is still a week left for a deluge, but nothing
can take away the 224 hours of sunshine so far. Average May
sunshine is 198 hours for the entire month, the weather center said.
   Londoners are taking all this in their stride.
   What is left of British reserve seems to have been shelved for
the time being as people of all ages walk around the capital with
large portions of their anatomy exposed to the sun.
   Barefoot, barelegged and occasionally bare-chested, they go to
the parks and the zoo, eating ice creams and pushing toddlers in
strollers.
   The people of the northern Calder Valley in West Yorkshire have
not had the same good fortune. On Friday, a two-hour rainstorm
caused flash floods and two towns had to be evacuated.
   A bolt of lightning struck 26-year-old Philip Blake as he walked
over a hill in North Wales on Tuesday, but his life apparently was
saved by a crucifix he wore around his neck. He suffered damaged
ear drums and burns.
   ``The burning cross has left a perfect mark at the top of his
chest,'' said a spokeswoman for Gwynedd Hospital in Bangor,
speaking anonymously.
   The Automobile Association said ``near monsoon'' rainstorms
Tuesday made driving treacherous and caused dozens of road
accidents across England's West Midlands.
   But for most of the nation, television weather forecasters are
running out of novel ways to express the good news and some have
begun to point out that a cold front edging south from Scotland
might get to northern England by Friday.

<HEAD>Daley at One Month: Off to Good Start, Critics Say, but Wait and
See</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Critics called him a pharoah and said he would
resurrect the machine politics of his late father, but one month
after his inauguration, even some detractors praise Mayor Richard
M. Daley for his political shrewdness.
   Since taking the oath of office on his 47th birthday April 24,
Daley has ordered a television-worthy cleanup of City Hall, which
he likened to a ``pig pen,'' and called for appointment of an
ethics watchdog with subpoena power to root out corruption among
all city employees _ even aldermen.
   He also cut more than $40 million from planned city spending,
and broke with tradition by ordering parked cars, some driven by
city honchos, towed from illegal spaces surrounding City Hall. Even
his press secretary found her car missing.
   And saying he didn't want to be the only survivor of a nuclear
attack, he pledged to sell a new, $50,000 bullet-proof mayoral
limousine ordered before he took office.
   Visible reforms make good ink, said Don Rose, a political
activist and long-time Daley critic who worked for Alderman Timothy
Evans, Daley's independent challenger in the April 4 election.
   ``Those are public relations, nice attention-getting moves,''
Rose said, calling some of the actions self-serving. ``I think I
have to say whatever the motives, he's gotten off on the right
foot.''
   But, Rose added, ``We haven't seen any of the real actions of
government yet, and I'm still very, very wary of what his policies
... are going to be.''
   Daley faces re-election in the spring of 1991, leading some
detractors to call the mayor's actions mere campaign tactics. But
Marj Halperin, a spokeswoman for the mayor, defends his moves.
   ``I keep wondering when people will finally understand that this
is real,'' she said Tuesday. ``These aren't things you do just for
show. These are things you do to manage the city responsibly and
effectively.''
   Daley, son of the late boss of Chicago, Richard J. Daley,
defeated Evans, who is black, and Democrat-turned-Republican Edward
Vrdolyak April 4 for the right to finish out the last two years of
the second term of the late Mayor Harold Washington, who died in
office in 1987.
   Washington was the city's first black mayor, and the City
Council elected Eugene Sawyer, a black South Side alderman, to be
interim mayor following Washington's death. Daley defeated Sawyer
in the Democratic primary in February.
   Evans, who called Daley a pharoah at the beginning of the
campaign, has criticized the mayor's performance as lackluster.
   ``Daley made a campaign promise that he would always look to
collecting revenue already owed to the city before he would raise
taxes,'' Evans said. ``Yet ... the first thing he did was to raise
water and sewer taxes.''
   The increase was drafted under Sawyer, but passed under Daley.
   ``We did reduce it from the previous administration,'' Halperin
said.
   Tom Roesser, president of the City Club of Chicago and a
political analyst close to the GOP, said Daley is doing what most
politicians do while facing the next election.
   ``I see nothing nefarious or hollow or not serious at all,'' he
said. ``I'm amazed, frankly, at how much reform he has brought.''
   David Orr, a white alderman who supported Evans, said he has
been pleased with Daley's reforms and a push for city efficiency.
   ``There's still a part of me that's surprised at his political
astuteness in the last few weeks,'' Orr said. ``I think it sets a
critical tone.''

<TEXT>
   The possibility of a wave of homeless
headed for its celebrity-soaked shores has Malibu in a dither over
the notion honorary Mayor Martin Sheen may have invited a tent city
encampment.
   Sheen declared the beach town where Sylvester Stallone and
Barbra Streisand live a nuclear-free homeless sanctuary.
   A nationally syndicated radio talk show host responded by
calling for a ``March on Malibu'' on Saturday, for which he says he
has 15 buses available as far away as Texas. By Tuesday, at least
one bus load of homeless people was organized, in Santa Barbara,
and that was enough to have the beach community fretting.
   ``If God had intended them to live in Malibu, he'd have made
them television producers,'' mused Los Angeles Times columnist Al
Martinez.
   The declaration sparking the turmoil read: ``I hereby declare
Malibu a nuclear free zone, a sanctuary for aliens and the homeless
and a protected environment for all life, wild and tame.''
   The attention Sheen has attracted to the beach town of 19,000
has put pressure on the Chamber of Commerce, which appointed him
honorary mayor earlier this month to promote a ``Shop Malibu''
campaign.
   ``The community is pretty upset,'' said Mary Lou Blackwood, the
chamber's executive vice president, who says she has handled
hundreds of telephone calls.
   Malibu is a town with no coin laundry, no car wash, no mortuary
and no car lot. It has trendy restaurants and three supermarkets,
where it's not unusual to see Sam Elliot, Amy Irving, Whoopi
Goldberg, George C. Scott or Dick Van Dyke.
   Few heads turn when Stallone roars by on his motorcycle. Malibu
is a place where Eddie Van Halen and Sammy Hagar can jam at the
Trancas nightclub without screaming throngs.
   Homes start at $500,000 and go up to $20 million, which is the
price tag on Miss Streisand's compound. Despite its
celebrity-enclave stereotype, most residents are working stiffs
with an average annual income of $60,000.
   Sheen neighbor Johnny Carson joked on the ``Tonight Show'' that
residents were offering to pay for valet parking for the homeless
and provide free sunblock. The honorary mayor responded to
criticism by declaring Malibu a free-speech zone.
   Carson said the following night: ``Mayor Sheen just declared
Michael Landon's hair a national forest.'' But many local
Malibuites aren't amused.
   The Malibu Inn and Restaurant's ``Dump Martin Sheen'' marquee _
changed Tuesday to ``Johnny For Mayor'' _ seemed to express
prevailing opinion. ``We should disassociate ourselves with him.
There is no community that welcomes the homeless,'' said manager
Tony Casson.
   Friends of Sheen, who has been heavily involved in anti-nuclear
weapons protests and the farm workers' grape boycott, pledged to
provide food and clothing if homeless people show up.
   ``We're not going to ask them to leave. We feel those people
have suffered enough and they are being used,'' said neighbor Maria
Olk. Supporter Judith Israel said: ``Homeless people aren't meat.''
   New York-based conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh,
who has been needling Sheen and the Hollywood ``left coast'' for
years, said his offer of one-way bus tickets to Malibu was a fair
comment on Sheen's declaration.
   ``I like to illustrate absurdity with the absurd,'' Limbaugh
said Tuesday. ``It is my intention to discredit Sheen. The march is
purely to embarrass Sheen and not Malibu.''
   Limbaugh, who embraces programs making the homeless self-reliant
rather than giving them handouts, said he telephoned the chamber to
ask where to take his homeless bus and a spokeswoman said,
``There's no place for them here,'' then hung up.
   ``See! There's no sanctuary. We are going to show them they
don't want you,'' said Limbaugh, conceding his reservations about
bringing homeless to Malibu. ``I don't want to be thought of as a
cheap theatrical stunt guy.''
   Sheen, who has been in Canada directing Gary Busey and son
Charlie Sheen in the movie ``Count a Lonely Cadence,'' said in his
latest missive from Vancouver: ``I regret that my concern for the
poor and the environment was so dishonestly misinterpreted and
misused to perpetrate a cruel hoax on 4 million Americans who are
already broken beyond any measure of understanding.''

   President Raul Alfonsin said
Tuesday he won't leave office early because President-elect Carlos
Menem will not agree on policies to stabilize the economy during a
transfer of power.
   ``We will get to the 10th of December with the extraordinary
effort of the Argentine people,'' Alfonsin said in a 14-minute
speech broadcast nationwide.
   His six-year term expires Dec. 10. Alfonsin's Radical Civic
Union and Menem's Peronist Party had been holding talks on the
possibility of an early transition because of the economic crisis.
   After Alfonsin's speech his Cabinet members submitted their
resignations. Press secretary Jose Ignacio Lopez said Alfonsin will
decide Wednesday whether to accept them.
   Menem told the independent news agency Diarios y Noticias
Tuesday night that his party did not break off the transition
negotiations that were initiated by Alfonsin last weekend. ``We
simply were not in agreement with the (economic) proposals of the
ruling party,'' he said.
   ``As I said before, I want the president to depart with every
honor, without resigning, as befits a man who has struggled for
democracy.''
   About 3,000 people gathered outside Congress Tuesday night for
what they called a ``hunger march.'' The demonstration was
organized by the United Left alliance to protest inflation and
increased utility rates approved last week by the government.
   ``There will be no pact or social peace arranged from above,
because now begins the struggle and mobilization of those from
below,'' Patricio Echegaray, secretary-general of the Communist
Party, told the crowd.
   Alfonsin said his Radical Civic Union will unveil its own
economic program by Sunday. ``It will be as hard as you can
imagine,'' he said, and suitable for ``an economy of war ... a
government in crisis.''
   The mood in Buenos Aires was somber as teachers and other public
employees planned strikes for higher wages, stores in the capital
marked up prices and some supermarkets rationed purchases.
   Menem, 58, defeated presidential nominee Eduardo Angeloz of the
Radical Civic Union in national elections on May 14. The Peronists
won virtual control of both houses of Congress.
   Instead of giving the economy a boost of confidence, the
election was followed by a plunge in value of the austral against
the dollar. Interest rates soared to record highs and other key
economic indicators grew worse.
   Inflation is projected at 50 percent this month. Wages are
shrinking, unemployment and public anger are rising, the national
budget is in deficit, reserves in the Central Bank are low and no
payments are being made on the foreign debt.
   Banks and foreign exchange houses were closed Monday and Tuesday
as the government increased public utility rates and raised taxes
to help balance the budget. Banks will resume restricted operations
Wednesday, but exchange houses will remain closed until Monday.
   Peronists rejected the tariff increases and insisted that the
national minimum wage be raised substantially and the federal
government bail out provinces _ almost all Peronist-governed _ that
could not meet their payrolls.
   Menem earlier indicated he might be willing to take office
early. Analysts said he backed out because he counted on the
seven-month transition to prepare his own economic program.
   ``He doesn't want to take over in the middle of a crisis he
didn't cause,'' said Angel Pena, chief economist at the
Mediterranean Foundation think tank. ``It could be worse in
December, but not necessarily.''

   School board members have decided not to
sponsor any more foreign-exchange programs because of fears of
terrorism.
   The decision was made because rioting and looting in the streets
of Caracas, Venezuela, coincided with a trip by Hempfield Area High
School students to a neighboring town this spring.
   ``We tried calling the State Department, but it's impossible to
make a determination (about instability). Venezuela has been stable
for so many years. It's so unpredictable,'' Superintendent Margaret
Smith said.
   Students in the Hempfield Area School District who want to
travel abroad still can do so by making their own arrangements,
officials said.

<HEAD>Most Americans Are Too Fat, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly two-thirds of Americans are too fat,
and more than a third are at least 10 percent over the recommended
weights for their height, body build and sex, a nationwide health
survey shows.
   The study, done for Prevention Magazine, determined that 64
percent of adults age 25 and over could stand to lose at least a
few pounds.
   But fewer than half of those people were trying to shed the
extra pounds when polled in November, the study by Louis Harris and
Associates says.
   The percentage of overweight Americans is the highest since the
magazine began keeping track in 1983, and is up from 59 percent in
1987 and 1986, 62 percent in 1985, 56 percent in 1984 and 58
percent in the first year of the survey.
   More than a third of Americans are at least 10 percent over the
weight recommended for their height, body build and sex by the
Metropolitan Life Insurance tables used by many doctors, the survey
found.
   Only about one-fifth weigh about what they should, and they are
more likely to be ``people in the East and West, suburban
residents, people in their 30's and 40's, college graduates,'' the
magazine said.
   Slightly more women than men are the proper weight _ 22 percent
compared with 20 percent _ and gender aside, only 29 percent of
people making more than $50,000 a year are appropriately trim, the
survey said.
   ``Weight control becomes more problematic when those who are
overweight do not feel overweight,'' the magazine said.
   One in five surveyed fell into that category, and only 48
percent of those who needed to shed pounds were actively fighting
the battle of the bulge, according to the survey.
   Despite the weight problem, the survey found some good news
about Americans' health, including more people who quit smoking and
cut down on high-cholesterol foods and more women who examined
their breasts monthly for signs of cancer.
   Overall, it found that people 65 and older are more likely to
take preventive health measures than those under 35.
   Among the findings:
   _48 percent said they try to avoid high-cholesterol foods, up 6
percentage points from 1987. However, fewer people are trying to
get enough vitamins and minerals, to avoid eating too much salt and
sugar and to eat fish twice a week, the survey said.
   _36 percent said they exercise strenuously, sustaining an
accelerated heart and pulse rate for at least 20 minutes, at least
three days a week. That proportion has remained stable over the
past five years.
   _63 percent reported that they feel under great stress at least
once a week, up from 55 percent in 1983. Stress is reported more
frequently by those in the lowest and highest income brackets, the
survey found.
   _Americans are continuing to kick the cigarette habit, with the
percentage of smokers declining to 26 percent, down from 30 percent
in 1983.
   _The rate of heavy drinkers _ 11 percent _ has changed little
since 1983, but the proportion of adults who say they never consume
alcohol rose 5 points over the period to 39 percent.
   _One out of 10 people under age 30 said they used drugs in 1988,
compared with two out of 10 in 1984.
   _The proportion of women who said they examine their breasts at
least once a month for signs of cancer rose to 51 percent, up from
37 percent five years earlier.
   The telephone survey of 1,250 randomly selected adults was
conducted last Nov. 9-23. Results had a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points.

<TEXT>
   A federal jury convicted 12 people Tuesday on
charges they operated an interstate drug ring that called itself
``The Company.'' The trial lasted 16 months.
   The U.S. District Court jury found all the defendants in the
case guilty of 65 of the 71 counts against them.
   Members of the ring were accused of making and selling
methamphetamines and operating a marijuana plantation and other
drug operations in northern California. They allegedly distributed
the drugs from northern Califorian through western Nevada and south
to San Diego.
   Richard Rupley Sr., the ringleader of the cartel based in nearby
Sparks, was convicted on all 15 counts.
   Rupley, John Bonnenfant and Dwain and Eddie Baker were found
guilty of conducting a continuing criminal enterprise, which
carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
   The jury acquitted the defendants on three counts, and said they
could not agree on a verdict on three other charges after 10 days
of deliberations.
   The defendants appeared undaunted by the trial's outcome,
chatting with each other as the verdicts were read and chuckling as
Judge Edward C. Reed Jr. mispronounced one defendant's name.
Bonnenfant and another defendant winked and waved at girlfriends in
the audience.
   Reed ordered the jurors, who first entered the courtroom on Jan.
19, 1988, to return Wednesday afternoon for the trial's final phase.
   They will determine whether the defendants should forfeit about
$2 million to $3 million worth of possessions seized during their
arrests.
   Prosecutors hope to get the cars, weapons and other items to
help defray the huge cost of trying the case, estimated at $8
million to $10 million.
   Twenty-four people originally were indicted in the case, but
half were removed before it went to trial after pleading guilty to
reduced charges in exchange for cooperating with the government.
   The charges against the defendants convicted Tuesday included
manufacture, possession and possesion for sale of methamphetamines
and marijuana; interstate transportation in aid of racketeering;
wiretapping, and unlawful use of a firearm.
   Except for the continuing criminal enterprise charge, most of
the counts carry a maximum sentence of 5 years in prison and some
permit a maximum sentence of 20 years.

<HEAD>Group Formed to Find Commercial Uses for Superconductors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A university and two giant companies that are
leaders in technology research have joined forces to try to beat
Japan in development of commercial uses for superconductors.
   The announcement by the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corp.,
International Business Machines and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology on Tuesday said the consortium's goal is develop
applications for the new technology.
   Superconductors are ceramic materials cooled to beyond minus 200
degrees Fahrenheit, at which point they can let electricity pass
through them without resistance.
   In theory, superconductors could let energy be stored and sent
without any loss of strength and more cheaply than is now possible.
Potential uses include faster computers and more powerful batteries
and motors.
   Both the United States and Japan are researching
superconductors, but the U.S. has the edge.
   The goal of the consortium is to make sure American firms,
rather than those from Japan, have the advantage in commercial
application of the research.
   ``This will be a consortium of open communication among the
researchers involved,'' the three organizations said in a joint
statement. ``The combining of their scientific knowledge and their
knowledge of applications will benefit the nation.''
   The new organization will be called the Consortium for
Superconducting Electronics. Researchers will remain at their
present locations but will share information.
   In January, the White House Science Council said such an
organization was needed if the United States wanted to avoid what
occurred in laser and videotape technology.
   Both were created in the United States but were commercially
exploited by Japan.
   The consortium announced that research efforts will be
concentrated in four areas, including signal distribution,
high-temperature materials and technology, advanced devices and
integrated circuits, and junctions.
   The consortium will focus on applying superconductor technology
to high-speed microelectronic devices for use in computers,
telecommunications and military systems, the New York Times
reported today.
   ``It is a model of how universities, government labs and
industry have to cooperate in the future to address a number of
issues,'' MIT Provost John Deutch told the Times.
   Ralph E. Gomory, IBM senior vice president for science and
technology, told the Times that the consortium would seek $4
million to $6 million in financing from a Defense Department
research agency, most of which would go to MIT.
   Robert C. Dynes, director of chemical physics research at AT&amp;T
Bell Laboratories, told the Times that consortium organizers
thought having big organizations involved would give the group
weight to attract other members.
   ``I don't regard this as the big guys banding together and
wiping out the little guys as much as giving the little guys an
ability to get in the same building as us,'' he said.

   A babysitter who pleaded guilty in 1985 in one of
Florida's most notorious child abuse cases has been released from
prison and deported to her native Honduras, immigration officials
said Tuesday.
   Ileana Fuster was convicted along with her husband, Frank, in
1985 on numerous charges of child abuse at the Country Walk day
care center in southwest Dade County.
   Mrs. Fuster, who had served only about four years of her 10-year
sentence, was released from the Florida State Prison for Women at
Lowell May 16, said Perry Rivkind, Miami district director of the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   She was placed in the custody of immigration officials and two
days later put on a plane to Tegucigalpa, Honduras, said Rivkind,
adding that the release was not announced at the time for Mrs.
Fuster's own security.
   Mrs. Fuster, 22, had written the INS from prison before her
release, asking to be permitted to remain in the country, Rivkind
said. But the INS director said she was illegally in the country
and a convicted felon.
   ``She'll never be able to return to the United States,'' he said.
   Mrs. Fuster pleaded guilty to 12 counts of sexual battery and
lewd assault charges, while her husband, who has never admitted
guilt, was convicted on 14 counts of sexual battery, lewd assault,
and aggravated assault.
   He is currently serving six consecutive life sentences, plus 110
years.

   A fire started accidentally by a plumber
Tuesday destroyed a Princeton home housing a large collection of
works by famed furniture maker and craftsman George Nakashima,
officials said.
   More than 100 pieces of woodwork and furniture by Nakashima were
destroyed, the New York Times reported Wednesday.
   Nakashima, 83, is considered by many to be the elder statesman
of American crafts.
   Only two pieces of the collection, owned by Dr. Arthur and
Evelyn Krosnick, survived. A picture frame and a boardroom table
were on loan for an exhibit of Nakashima's work at the American
Craft Museum in New York City.
   ``It is a great loss _ for them and for us,'' Nakashima told the
Times in an interview from his studio in New Hope, Pa. ``Some of
the pieces can be replaced, but many cannot. They are precise
pieces _ one of a kind, many of them.''
   The blaze began about 11:20 a.m. when an acetylene torch being
used by the plumber caught fire, said Princeton Township Police Lt.
Mario Musso. The plumber set the torch on the floor while he looked
for something to extinguish the flames, and while he was gone the
fire engulfed the basement and spread to the rest of the house,
Musso said.
   Princeton Fire Chief Mark Freda estimated damages to the home
and its contents at about $1 million. The house was in a secluded,
wooded area.
   Mrs. Krosnick and her housekeeper escaped without injury,
officials said. The plumber was treated for minor burns to his
hands and hair at a hospital and released.

<TEXT>
   The first film by 26-year-old American
director Steven Soderbergh, ``sex, lies and videotape,'' won the
Golden Palm award at the 42nd Cannes film festival, and Americans
took several other top awards.
   One of the low-budget movie's four stars, James Spader, won best
actor during Tuesday night's ceremonies and Meryl Streep was chosen
best actress for her performance in ``A Cry in the Dark,'' directed
by Fred Schepisi.
   American Jim Jarmusch's ``Mystery Train,'' the tale of three
characters connected by a ride on the same train, took the prize
for best artistic contribution.
   Gregory Peck, whose latest film ``Old Gringo'' officially closed
the 13-day festival, also won a special prize for lifetime
contribution to cinema.
   ``Well, I guess it's all downhill from here,'' said Soderburgh
as he accepted the festival's top prize. ``I don't know what to
say.''
   West German director Wim Wenders, president of the jury,
presented the award to Soderbergh, of Baton Rouge, La. Wenders said
the movie, a surprise choice among the 22 entries, brought the jury
``an enormous joy and a great confidence in the future of cinema.''
   The Jury's Special Prize went to two films: French director
Bertrand Blier's ``Trop Belle Pour Toi'' (Too Beautiful for You)
and Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore's ``Nuovo Cinema Paradiso''
(New Paradise Cinema).
   Emir Kusturica of Yugoslavia received the best director award
for his movie ``Dom Za Vesanje'' (Time of the Gypsies).
   The Jury Prize went to ``Jesus de Montreal'' by Canadian
director Denys Arcand. The film had been among those rumored for
the Golden Palm.
   Shot on a $1.2 million budget, ``sex, lies and videotape'' tells
the story of a seemingly happily married, prosperous couple, whose
lives are disrupted when a troubled friend returns to town,
upsetting a carefully constructed system of lies and sexual
betrayal.
   Spader portrayed the returning friend. Impotent, he videotapes
interviews with women about their sex lies as a substitute for real
intimacy. The movie, through well received, had not figured in
rumors for the Golden Palm.
   Blier's ``Trop Belle Pour Toi,'' starring Gerard Depardieu,
tells the story of a garage owner who betrays his beautiful wife
following a sudden, unexplained attraction for his less attractive
temporary secretary.
   ``Nuovo Cinema Paradiso'' a French-Italian entry, focuses on the
cinema and its demise.
   ``Old Gringo,'' directed by Argentine Luis Puenzo and also
starring Jane Fonda, officially closed the 13-day festival. Both
Peck and Ms. Fonda received standing ovations from the audience at
the Palais des Festivals.
   Booes could be heard from the audience when no one came forward
to collect the best actress prize for Streep, who was in town only
for the showing of her film on May 13. American actor Jack Palance,
on stage to help present the award, accepted Streep's prize.

<HEAD>Regulations Designed to Curb Worker Exposure to AIDS, Hepatitis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says 5.3 million workers would
be better protected from exposure to AIDS, hepatitis and other
viruses under new regulations requiring all blood and bodily fluids
to be handled as if they were known to be infected.
   The regulations, proposed Tuesday by the Labor Department, were
applauded by two unions that represent health-care employees and
other workers who would be affected, although one of the unions
suggested some minor changes.
   ``We sincerely hope that the department lives up to its
commitment to finalize the standard at the very latest by the end
of the year,'' said John J. Sweeney, president of the Service
Employees International Union.
   In addition to 4.7 million health-care workers, the government
said the regulations would protect 600,000 people working in law
enforcement, fire and rescue squads, corrections facilities,
research laboratories, blood banks and the funeral industry.
   The regulations would require employers to study any procedures
which could expose workers to blood or other potentially infectious
materials, identify workers who perform such tasks, and take
appropriate steps to reduce the risk of exposure, including a
written infection control plan and use of protective clothing.
   The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration
estimated that the regulations would prevent about 10,000
infections and 200 deaths a year among health-care workers. They
would replace general OSHA safety requirements for handling and
disposal of potentially contaminated items with measures designed
to deal specifically with AIDS, hepatitis and other diseases
carried by blood and bodily fluids.
   Preliminary OSHA estimates put the average annual cost of
complying with the regulations at $1,373 apiece for the
approximately 600,000 workplaces affected, ranging from $32,875 for
a hospital to $141 for funeral service establishments.
   A hospital industry group, the American Hospital Association,
said its staff was reviewing the proposal and had no immediate
comment.
   If unchanged after a period of public comment, the regulations
would require:
   _That all blood and certain bodily fluids be handled as if they
were infected with the AIDS-producing human immunodeficiency virus,
or HIV, the hepatitis B virus and other blood-borne viruses.
   _A number of controls for disposal of potentially infectious
materials, including leak-proof, puncture-resistant and clearly
labeled containers for the disposal of needles and other
potentially infectious materials.
   _Clear labeling and signs in areas where potentially infectious
materials are handled or stored.
   _Employers to offer free hepatitis B vaccines to workers who on
average are exposed to potentially infectious fluids once or more a
month. That represents a shift from the Reagan administration,
which during early consideration of the regulations opposed forcing
employers to pay for the costly vaccine.
   _Employers to provide, and employees subjected to possible
exposure to infectious materials to wear, protective clothing.
   One of labor's complaints was language allowing that provision
to be ignored if donning protective clothing ``would interfere with
the proper delivery of health care of public safety situations.''
   Jordan Barab, occupational safety and health director for the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said
labor supported allowing workers to decide to proceed without
protective clothing in life-threatening situations. But Barab said
the language in the proposed regulations was too vague and did not
specify whether such a decision should rest with an employee or
employer.
   Labor's second concern was that the regulations did not contain
language, often found in new OSHA regulations, requiring employers
to make engineering improvements to reduce potential hazards. Such
improvements, which often include development of new machines and
techniques of handling potentially hazardous marterials, are
considered more foolproof than requiring protective clothing.
   A draft of the regulations released in January required improved
engineering controls where possible.
   ``The proposal has been seriously weakened,'' said AFSCME
President Gerald McEntee.
   OSHA estimated workplace exposure results in 6,000 to 7,400
hepatitis B infections each year in the United States, causing up
to 400 hospitalizations and between 130 and 165 deaths. The agency
said it did not have such estimates for HIV exposure, but said
fewer workers were exposed to the AIDS-producing virus than were
exposed to hepatitis.

   The Mongolian marauder Genghis Khan should be
praised as the father of psychological warfare, Panamanian leader
Manuel Antonio Noriega wrote in a 1975 primer on techniques of
manipulating the masses.
   ``He, better than anyone, employed the technique of the rumor
.... and with it assured the conquest of half the world with only a
handful of men,'' Noriega wrote about the 12th century warrior in
an 80-page treatise called ``Psychological Operations.''
   The manual, obtained by the Panama City bureau of The Washington
Post, was the subject of a story in the newspaper's Wednesday
editions.
   Panama's de facto ruler wrote the book while he was a lieutenant
colonel in charge of Panama's military intelligence service. The
book quotes such diverse thinkers as Aristotle and Sigmund Freud,
and expresses admiration for such figures as Mao Zedong, Ho Chi
Minh and Fidel Castro.
   The manual, according to the Post, develops Noriega's theory of
a malleable and easily exploited ``mass man.''

   Sirhan Sirhan, serving life in prison for
assassinating Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was denied parole for the
10th time Tuesday despite saying he felt ``very remorseful'' about
the slaying.
   The state Board of Prison Terms made its decision after
deliberating for nearly an hour, saying Sirhan was unsuitable for
parole and calling Kennedy's 1968 murder one of the most shocking
crimes in U.S. history.
   ``You still constitute a danger to society,'' David Brown,
chairman of the three-member panel, told Sirhan, who will be
eligible for parole again in a year.
   In denying Sirhan's release, the board cited his unstable social
history and ``selective memory'' of the June 5, 1968 slaying and
events leading to it. The board also told Sirhan they wanted him to
complete a more extensive psychiatric evaluation.
   Sirhan, 45, showed no visible reaction to the decision, but
expressed his frustration at a news conference after the hearing.
   ``Oftentimes I feel like a dog at the dog races. When the race
is on, he's always chasing the rabbit ... whatever I do is not
enough,'' said Sirhan, who called the panel's reasons for denying
parole ``specious at best.''
   During the four-hour hearing at the State Correctional Training
Facility in this small community about 180 miles south of San
Francisco, Sirhan told the prison board he was sorry for Kennedy's
death.
   The senator from New York was shot with a .22-caliber pistol as
he walked through the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel in Los
Angeles shortly after winning the California Democratic
presidential primary.
   ``I feel very sad, very sorry, very remorseful ... that a human
life was taken,'' Sirhan, dressed in prison-issue blue denim shirt
and jeans, told the board. ``After 21 years .... I have become
quite convinced that my act was very wrong, morally and humanly,
toward Robert Kennedy, and especially toward his family and his
loved ones and his suporters.
   ``I realize the mistake of it and I wish from the bottom of my
heart ... that this crime, this horrible event, never occurred.
   ``I feel 21 years of this type of prison has been plenty of
punishment,'' he said. ``I wish I could reverse it and undo it but
I can't.''
   Sirhan, a Jerusalem-born Christian Arab, was sentenced to death
for Kennedy's murder but was spared the San Quentin gas chamber
after California's death penalty law was overturned in 1972 by the
state Supreme Court.
   His sentence was changed to life in prison with possibility of
parole, and Sirhan faced his first parole hearing in 1975.
   He is imprisoned at the State Correctional Training Facility.
   Sirhan last came before the board two years ago. At the time,
the panel recommended he undergo extensive psychiatric evaluation,
pursue vocational training, attend Alcoholics Anonymous sessions,
remain free of disciplinary problems, earn an associate's degree
and provide documentation of job offers.
   ``The American system of justice is going to let me go home in a
coffin,'' an angry Sirhan said then.
   On Tuesday, Sirhan and his attorney, Luke McKissack, asked that
the hearing be postponed so Sirhan could complete the psychiatric
evaluation, which began in March.
   McKissack, who engaged in frequent shouting matches with board
members, argued they should disqualify themselves as prejudiced
against Sirhan because they had taken part in a previous hearing.
   The board, however, denied his requests to postpone the hearing
and disqualify themselves.
   Sirhan, who cried out, ``I did it for my country'' seconds after
the shooting, told television interviewer David Frost in February
that he acted not ``out of personal malice towards the man but out
of concern for other people.''
   He compared his act to a Jew killing Adolf Hitler.
   Sirhan apparently was angered after Kennedy, a staunch supporter
of Israel, repeated his proposal that 50 Phantom jets be shipped to
the Jewish state.
   During the interview, Sirhan repeatedly apologized for the
killing.

<TEXT>
   Washington Cathedral, the ``great church for
national purposes'' that Pierre L'Enfant dreamed of as part of his
plan for the nation's capital, is at last nearing completion.
   Signaling the beginning of the final phase of construction, a
flatbed truck pulled up in front of the 14th century Gothic-style
structure Tuesday with one last load of Indiana limestone.
   The first load was delivered in 1910.
   The ceremonial placing of the final stone is scheduled for Sept.
29, 1990 - 83 years to the day from the laying of the cornerstone
in 1907.
   But most of the heavy work will have been completed by this
fall, said Dick Feller, canon clerk of the works, or head of
construction for the cathedral.
   ``This is a great day,'' said the Rt. Rev. John T. Walker,
Episcopal bishop of Washington.
   ``It's been a labor of love,'' said Peter Cleland, master mason,
who has worked on the project since 1953.
   L'Enfant, the man commissioned by George Washington to lay out
the capital on the Potomac, included the church in his plans, but
no steps were taken to build it until a group of citizens took up
the project in the 1890s.
   Work has continued with few interruptions since 1907.
Construction was halted during World War I and World War II and
because of a shortage of funds in the 1970s.
   But 83 years is by no means a long time for building such an
edifice, said the Rev. Leonard Freeman, communications director at
the cathedral.
   ``This is about middle range for building a cathedral,'' Freeman
said. ``A shorty might take 50 or 60 years. Some of them go 150
years or more without having been finished.''
   ``A modern building, you put up a steel frame and put things
around it, but that's not the way this was built,'' he said. ``This
was built physically in the same manner that they were built in the
Middle Ages.''
   That is, he said, ``stone on stone.''
   Anthony J. Segreti, president of Segreti Tepper Architects, the
Washington firm overseeing the job, said, ``There's quite a
difference working on this project and on a specification office
building downtown. This type of construction you don't see in this
day and age.''
   The first section, Bethlehem Chapel, was completed in 1912; the
central tower was finished in 1964, and the nave was ready for the
nation's bicentennial in 1976.
   The cathedral was the setting for the funeral of President
Eisenhower in 1969 and a national memorial service for President
Truman in 1972. It is the final resting place of Woodrow Wilson.
Martin Luther King Jr. preached his last Sunday sermon there, three
days before he was murdered.
   Each year, about 350,000 people visit the unfinished house of
worship, the sixth largest cathedral in the world. It is a tenth of
a mile long and 289 feet wide at its widest point.
   The stones from Bybee Stone Co. of Bloomington, Ind., which has
supplied the cathedral for about 10 years, weigh from 150 to 450
pounds. There were other suppliers before Bybee, but all the
limestone has come from Indiana.

   Governors get all kinds of mail, but the
postcard from a climbers' base camp on Mount Everest was a new
twist for Gov. Cecil Andrus.
   Climber Tom Whittaker, one of three Pocatello residents in a
party trying to scale the world's highest peak, advised the
governor the trek is going well ``despite high winds.''
   ``I'm having a blast,'' Whittaker said in the missive from the
23,500-foot base camp in Nepal. ``It's still a long way to the top,
but there are no complaints.''
   Before Whittaker and Jeff and Kellie Rhoads, all graduates of
Idaho State University, left for the climb, Andrus gave them an
Idaho state flag to plant at the summit.
   Whittaker said two members of the party had already recovered
from flu.

   Most U.S. Postal Service customers realize it's
going to take a few days for their mail to reach its destination,
but some New York City residents believe 23 days between pickups is
a bit much.
   Mortgage payments, parking ticket fines and ``a whole stack of
Mother's Day cards'' on Tuesday came tumbling from an overstuffed
mailbox that apparently hadn't been emptied for more than three
weeks, said Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y.
   The congressman's staff looked into the problem after
constituents complained they were receiving past due notices for
things they knew they had paid.
   Ackerman said all but one of the post cards his staff members
mailed from mailboxes in the Queens neighborhood to his Washington
office arrived, enabling them to pinpoint the forgotten mailbox.
   Four hundred pieces of mail were retrieved from the box,
including some stamped with the date by a postage meter.
   ``There was a whole stack of Mothers' Day cards,'' he said. ``I
guess some mothers are wondering why they were forgotten.''
   The congressman said he asked the local postmaster to write a
letter that people who might have incurred late payment penalties
could send to their creditors.
   They were also considering marking the mail as delayed,
although, Ackerman said, ``They don't have a stamp that says,
`Oops, We forgot your mailbox existed.'''

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Attorney General Griffin B. Bell has
been named by a special Exxon Corp. legal committee to head an
investigation into the Alaskan oil spill, according to published
reports.
   Bell's task will be to try to determine responsibility for the
nation's worst oil spill and recommend to Exxon's board whether
lawsuits should be filed against former or current Exxon officials,
the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.
   ``I'm going to interview everyone who knows anything about the
spill,'' the Journal quoted Bell as saying.
   ``It will be very exciting and very challenging,'' he said in an
interview published Wednesday in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
``We're going to get to the bottom of everything ... to make an
investigation of everything and (make a recommendation) as to what
ought to be done for the best interest of the shareholders.''
   Bell's investigation is expected to begin in about three weeks
and include questioning of Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl, who
said he would cooperate.
   Bell said up to eight lawyers could eventually be involved in
the probe.
   The tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on March 24 and spilled 10.9
million gallons of oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound.
   Exxon says it has spent nearly $100 million trying to clean up
the oil that has stained hundreds of miles of Alaska's southern
coastline and killed thousands of animals.
   Exxon's board set up the three-member committee of outside
directors after receiving letters from shareholders' attorneys
calling for such a probe.
   Bell, who was attorney general in President Jimmy Carter's
admininstration, in 1985 conducted a similar inquiry into a
check-kiting scandal at E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. Bell found that senior
managers weren't involved.
   Hutton eventually pleaded guilty to 2,000 counts of check-kiting
and agreed to pay $2.75 million in fines and legal fees.
   In other legal preparations, Alaska has hired a prominent
University of Georgia law professor to help represent the state in
its expected lawsuit against Exxon.
   Thomas J. Schoenbaum, director of the university's Dean Rusk
Center for International Law, joins the Alaska attorney general's
office and a an Alaskan law firm.
   Schoenbaum said he was hired about 10 days ago and will travel
to Alaska in about two weeks.

<TEXT>
   Surprise disclosures that Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini has undergone surgery come at a time of intense
struggle within Iran's fragile leadership structure over who will
succeed him.
   The public admission that the 89-year-old Imam, as he is known,
was even ill marked a major departure for Iranians, who for the
last three years have only glimpsed the Islamic republic's supreme
leader on television.
   The reports by the state television and radio networks that
Khomeini was in ``exceptional condition'' for his age, despite the
surgery on Tuesday to stop intestinal bleeding, appeared aimed at
reassuring Iranians the revolutionary patriarch was still at the
helm.
   ``I would like to inform listeners and viewers that his eminence
... is perhaps one of history's exceptions in his physical
structure and state of health,'' the chief surgeon, Dr. Hassan
Arefi, declared.
   That may have comforted Khomeini's followers. But it was also a
reminder of Khomeini's mortality and emphasized that the question
of who will rule Iran in the post-Khomeini era is wide open.
   On March 28, Khomeini dumped his designated successor, Ayatollah
Hussein-Ali Montazeri, in one of Iran's biggest political upheavals
since the 1979 Islamic revolution ended 2,400 years of monarchy.
   Political and religious leaders are grappling with changing the
revolutionary constitution to eliminate what Khomeini calls ``flaws
and imperfections'' and settle the leadership question.
   The recommendations of the 20-man Constitutional Committee that
Khomeini appointed will go before voters in a referendum in
mid-August _ the same time Iranians vote for a new president.
   Since Iran abruptly accepted a cease-fire in the 8-year war with
Iraq last summer, it has been gripped by political uncertainty.
   Anti-Western revolutionary radicals led by Prime Minister
Hussein Musavi and Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, who
favor tight control of the economy, are locked in a power struggle
with those seeking more free enterprise and links with the West.
   In March, Montazeri was forced to resign after criticizing
Khomeini's policies and questioning what the revolution had
achieved in its first decade.
   Montazeri's resignation followed Khomeini's sharp swing back to
fundamentalist radicalism. In February, Khomeini ordered Moslems to
seek out and kill British author Salman Rushdie for his novel,
``The Satanic Verses,'' charging it blasphemes Islam.
   The death call brought widespead Western condemnation of Iran,
smothering moves toward liberalization and efforts by Parliament
Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani and others to end Iran's self-imposed
isolation.
   The radical resurgence intensified a wave of executions of
political dissidents and purges.
   The power struggle is likely to intensify.
   ``Montazeri's resignation ... raises the question of how far
Ayatollah Khomeini is prepared to go in his current drive to root
out revisionism,'' commented Charles Snow, an analyst with the
Middle East Economic Survey weekly.
   ``It may be that the ayatollah is feeling his mortality and is
trying, like Chairman Mao in China, to ensure the future of his
revolution after his death by turning the radicals loose while he
is still alive,'' Snow said.
   The uncertainty is compounded by Khomeini's tactic of constantly
switching support for one faction or another so none becomes too
powerful.
   Against this backdrop, the deliberations of the Constitutional
Committee will have a far-reaching impact on Iran's future.
   Rafsanjani, the only declared presidential candidate so far,
wants to widen the powers of the office and scrap the premiership
to eliminate the competing power centers that have paralyzed
decisions on the economy and social reform.
   The hardliners favor a presidency which is largely ceremonial,
with power centralized in the prime minister.
   The debate is heating up, although the Tehran Times daily noted
Monday that Rafsanjani's campaign ``seems to be getting the nod
from the majority'' of the committee.
   All indications are that in the absence of any leader with
Khomeini's spiritual authority as vice-regent of the prophet
Mohammed, there will be a tilt toward installing a collective
leadership after he dies.
   Rafsanjani, as well as Khomeini's son Ahmad, whose political
ambitions are starting to show, will likely be on that leadership
council.
   If, despite the radicals' strength, Rafsanjani can change the
constitution his way and win the presidency, he would be expected
to make profound changes in Iran's power structure.
   Current President Ali Khamenei, whose second four-year term
expires in September, has asserted that concentrating power in the
presidency will not lead to a dictatorship and noted: ``You can't
run a country ... if there is too much dispersion of power.''

<TEXT>
   The rescue of Jessica McClure from an
abandoned Texas well gave ABC the most-watched television program
last week but NBC extended its record Nielsen ratings streak to 48
weeks.
   ``Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure'' told how the
people of Midland, Texas, rallied to save the 18-month-old child
when she fell 19 feet down an abandoned well on Oct. 14, 1987.
   The ABC Sunday night movie knocked the two-hour wrap-up of NBC's
``Miami Vice'' to 21st place in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings.
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' was second in the ratings. NBC's ``The Cosby
Show'' was third and NBC's ``Cheers'' was fourth.
   Two series ended the season last week in the top 10. NBC's
``L.A. Law,'' in which Ann Kelsey announced she was pregnant, tied
for fifth place with ABC's ``The Wonder Years.'' CBS' ``Knots
Landing,'' with the second part of its two-part cliffhanger
episode, was in seventh place.
   Other shows in the top 10: CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote'' in eighth
place, CBS' ``60 Minutes'' in ninth and NBC's movie about the
abortion rights battle, ``Roe vs. Wade'' in 10th.
   NBC's average prime time rating of 13.3 for the week extended
its winning streak to 48 weeks. CBS' average was 12.0 and ABC 11.6.
Each rating point equals 904,000 households with television. The
share is a percentage of sets in use.
   NBC's average since the season began Sept. 19 is 15.7; ABC's is
12.7 and CBS 12.5.
   Fox Broadcasting's ``Married...With Children'' was 47th, placing
it higher than 23 shows on the three networks.
   ``The ABC Evening News'' was the highest-rated news program last
week with 9.4. CBS had a 9.2 and NBC 8.2.

<HEAD>NRC To Study Concerns About Low-Power Nuclear Operation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nuclear power plants aren't designed for
low-power operation and could be strained by running at lower
levels, a panel of scientists warns.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Tuesday its staff will
review concerns by NRC's Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards
about low-power operation. The panel counsels the NRC on potential
industry hazards.
   As a safety precaution, nuclear power plants normally operate at
low power, or 5 percent of generating capacity, before they are
permitted to increase operation and begin generating electricity.
   In a May 11 letter to NRC Chairman Lando Zech, the panel said it
has no evidence that extended low-power operation is unsafe.
   But it said it knows of ``instances in which operation at low
flow has produced excessive wear in check valves and in which
operation at low power has produced excessive vibration in a
feedwater pump not designed for extended operation at low flow.
   ``Our principal concern stems from the memory that the operators
of the Chernobyl plant, Unit 4, were unaware of the dangers of
operation at low power, whereas a careful analysis would have
convinced them that this was undesirable,'' the panel said.
   The Soviet Union plant at Chernobyl was operating at low power
when an April 1986 accident killed at least 31 people and released
a radioactive cloud that spread over a wide area.
   Eleven American nuclear power plants now have construction
permits. Among the closest to receiving low-power licenses are
Limerick in Pennsylvania, Comanche Peak in Texas, Watts Bar in
Tennessee, and Seabrook in New Hampshire.
   Low-power testing can take several months, ``but it's not a
standard time period. It's a case-by-case thing,'' said NRC
spokesman John Kopeck.
   A utility official recently said he was ``uneasy'' about
operating at 5 percent power, ``although he did not believe there
was anything unsafe about it,'' the committee said in its report.
The panel did not disclose the name of the official, or of plants
where problems occurred.
   Robert Pollard, a nuclear safety engineer for the Union of
Concerned Scientists, said in an interview Tuesday that he was
familiar with the low-power problem. The UCS is a private,
non-profit group which has been critical of some nuclear power
plants.
   ``I've certainly heard of some of the types of problems the
letter mentions, particularly when you take the large centrifugal
pumps cooled by water flowing through them,'' Pollard said.
   When there is a slower flow through the system, the pumps and
some other parts ``don't get cooled as well,'' he said.
   But Pollard said he was miffed at the reference to Chernobyl
because the reactor was unstable at low power to the point that ``I
don't know of a similar parallel in the United States.''

   Flames swept through a downtown produce market
and mall Tuesday, chasing scores of people into the street and
darkening the city skyline with smoke.
   There were no reports of injuries from the blaze that destroyed
the Farmer's Market Produce Bazaar and damaged an adjacent
five-story building housing the Western Metal Supply Co., Fire
Department spokesman Larry Stewart said.
   Four of the 120 firefighters who battled the fire were treated
at the scene for minor injuries and heat exhaustion, Stewart said.
   The Metro Arson Strike Team estimated damage at more than $1.5
million.
   The fire was expected to burn for hours, but was contained, Fire
Capt Bob Landis said Tuesday evening.
   The fire broke out around 2:45 p.m., said the bazaar's building
manager, George May.
   May said blaze started at the top of a second-floor stairwell
and that he tried to put it out with a fire extinguisher but it was
out of control.
   The building was full of employees and shoppers when the fire
broke out, but was speedily evacuated, May said.
   The bazaar housed 30 shops, including two wholesale produce
markets, said May, declaring the building a total loss.
   The fire's cause was unknown, and arson investigators were
called in.

<HEAD>Safety Board Blames Airline, Sees Industry Deficiency In Aloha Accident</HEAD>

   Federal investigators blame Aloha Airlines for
an accident that ripped open an airliner fuselage 24,000 feet over
Hawaii but they say lax inspection of aging 737s was an
``industry-wide deficiency.''
   The National Transportation Safety Board, ending a 13-month
investigation Tuesday, blamed the accident on failure of
island-hopping Aloha's maintenance program to detect broken bonds
and fatigue damage in the Boeing 737's outer skin.
   The board voted 4-1 to lay primary blame on the airline and said
Federal Aviation Administration failures contributed to the April
28, 1988, accident that hurled the plane's chief flight attendant
out of the airliner to her death. With one engine out and its
passenger section exposed to the sky, the plane landed on the
island of Maui with 89 passengers and five other crew members.
   The independent safety board said the FAA failed to issue
sufficient orders to correct problems with the aging 737 fleet and
didn't adequately monitor Aloha's maintenance program before the
incident.
   Aloha's president, A. Maurice Myers, took exception to the
board's conclusion, saying multiple cracking found around rivets in
the fuselage skin was undetectable prior to the accident. He said
the airline had followed all Boeing and FAA safety orders.
   Myers said the accident was Aloha's first in four decades, and
the airline has voluntarily scrapped three old 737s and decreased
the average age of its fleet from 15 years to 10. The average age
of U.S. airliners approaches 13 years.
   The board said Aloha's maintenance program failed to detect
disbonding and fatigue in fuselage skin joints, including numerous
cracks around rivets that hold fuselage pieces together.
   The 19-year-old airliner had been flying between 12 and 18
flights a day in Hawaii's warm, humid climate, investigators said.
But the board noted that similar fatigue problems were found as
early as 1974 in other 737s, resulting in service orders from
Boeing and FAA directives.
   The board indicated that many airlines were not making required
inspections.
   ``Reports of fleet-wide cracks received by the FAA after the
Aloha Airlines accident indicate that a similar lack of critical
attention to lap joint inspection and fatigue cracks detection was
an industry-wide deficiency,'' it said.
   The FAA cited the Aloha accident last week when it issued broad
orders for mandatory replacements on aging Boeing 727s, 737s and
747s. Previously, the FAA generally required replacements only if
regular inspections detected excessive wear.
   Safety board member Jim Burnett called for an examination into
new FAA orders that are based on proposals from an aviation
industry task force.
   ``I have sensed generally that the FAA is moving in a competent
manner in tying to deal with the aging aircraft problem,'' Burnett
said. ``But I'm always suspicious of (FAA orders) that are drafted
by the industry, and we need to take a good careful look at them.''
   Board member Joseph Nall dissented from the board's vote on a
``probable cause'' for the accident. He proposed wording that would
not have laid primary blame on the airline, saying the fact that
cracks went undetected was ``a system problem'' involving the
industry, the government and the carrier.
   The board rejected a conclusion proposed by its staff that would
have sharply criticized the cockpit crew of Aloha Flight 243 for
procedures used in landing the heavily damaged plane. Staff
investigators said the speed of the landing threatened to split
apart the plane.
   Board members said they would include cautions about such
landing conditions in the full report to be released in several
weeks, but wanted to include balancing comment about the heroics of
the pilots and flight attendants.
   The NTSB has no authority to impose penalties and can only make
recommendations to government agencies, transportation companies
and others.

   Pulitzer Prize-winning historian
James MacGregor Burns is planning to fly from Leningrad, to London,
to New York, to Washington and attempt one-mile runs in each city _
all in a day.
   ``If I can do it in one day, it will remind us how close these
nations are geographically and hence must be economically and
politically,'' Burns said in a statement issued Tuesday by Williams
College, where he is a political science professor.
   College spokesman James Kolesar said the 70-year-old Burns will
attempt the feat Friday, traveling between the cities on regularly
scheduled flights.
   According to Kolesar, Burns, who was in Moscow this week, said
he would make the runs to commemorate the bicentennial of the
American Bill of Rights, to celebrate the coming of glasnost in the
Soviet Union and to show that ``we septuagenarians are still alive
and kicking.''
   His run in Leningrad will take him from the Winter Palace, where
the czars lived, to a revolutionary shrine. In London, he will run
from Buckingham Palace to parliament. In New York, his route takes
him from Federal Hall to the spot off Broadway where James Madison
drafted the first provisions of the Bill of Rights. And in
Washington, the route goes from the Washington Monument to the
Jefferson Memorial.

   Drummer Michael Clarke, an original member of
the 1960s rock group, The Byrds, has permission from a judge to
continue using the name of the band for one he has formed.
   Clarke was sued in U.S. District Court by three former band
members _ Roger McGuinn, Chris Hillman and David Crosby.
   They accused Clarke, Artists International Management Inc. in
Boca Raton and AIM agent Steve Green of false advertising and
unfair competition in using the name The Byrds.
   Judge William Castagna said last Thursday that he found little
to support the accusations and allowed the 45-year-old Clarke to
use the name.
   The judge said the former band members have known for at least
four years that Clarke had used the name in more than 300 concerts
but didn't try to stop him. The suit was filed more than a month
ago.
   The Byrds hit the top of the charts in 1965 with ``Mr.
Tambourine Man,'' then followed with other hits including ``Eight
Miles High,'' ``Mr. Spaceman'' and ``Turn! Turn! Turn!''

   British rock star Sting visited
Australia's hottest environmental trouble spot after meeting Prime
Minister Bob Hawke to promote a campaign to save Amazonian rain
forests.
   The former singer of the group Police went to the Eden rain
forests near the Snowy Mountains of southern New South Wales to
show his support for the conservation issue.
   Since February, 550 demonstrators have been arrested at the Eden
forests. Shortly after Sting's visit Tuesday, police arrrested for
trespassing 28 demonstrators who walked into a protected area of
the forests.
   Sting's visit caps a world tour that has included Britain, the
United States and Japan to raise awareness for the vanishing
jungles of Brazil.
   ``I don't pretend to be an expert on this problem here,'' he
said. ``But one thing I did learn while in Japan recently is that
they don't log their own forests. They don't need to, they log
yours.''
   Japan is a leading importer of logs from the U.S. Northwest and
other areas of the world.
   Hawke pledged $187,500 toward the protection of the Amazon rain
forests.

   A judge approved the sale of a Grandma Moses
painting owned by Sir Rudolf Bing to raise cash for the former
Metropolitan Opera director's care in a nursing home.
   State Judge Eve Preminger on Tuesday authorized the sale of
``Haying in Vermont'' at an auction today at Sotheby's. The judge
required a minimum bid of $35,000, based on an appraisal of the
painting.
   ``The money situation is absolutely desperate,'' said Kevin
Walsh, lawyer for Paul Guth, Bing's court-appointed guardian.
   Bing, 87, is suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
   Guth blamed the drain on Bing's estate on security guards who
were needed to keep Bing's wife, Carroll Douglass Bing, from
running off with him as she was accused of doing nearly two years
ago.
   Bing and his wife, a former mental patient, were married in a
civil ceremony in 1987.
   A judge is expected to decide soon whether to annul the marriage
as Bing's guardian has requested.

   When a farmer cuts down his wood lot and uses
the money for a trip to Florida, he knows he's used up an asset.
When Indonesia cuts down its tropical timber and consumes the
proceeds, that counts as national income.
   ``Our current measures of economic success are misleading,''
Robert Repetto, director of research for the World Resources
Institute, said Tuesday.
   ``A country could exhaust its mineral resources, cut down its
forests, erode its soils, pollute its aquifers, and hunt its
wildlife and fisheries to extinction but measured income would not
be affected,'' said Repetto.
   ``No business would last very long selling off its assets to
meet the current payroll,'' he pointed out, ``but many countries
are doing just that behind a screen of misleading statistics.''
   The institute is a private study group funded by foundations,
the United Nations, government agencies, corporations and
individuals.
   Repetto and four co-authors have written ``Wasting Assets:
Natural Resources in the National Income Accounts,'' which
concentrates on Indonesia. Repetto is now working on figures for
Costa Rica and China.
   Officially, Indonesia's production grew by 7 percent a year
between 1970 and 1984. Repetto says that when loss of forests, soil
and oil is taken into account, that figure falls to 4 percent.
According to the World Bank, Indonesia's population is growing at a
rate of more than 2 percent a year, so the average citizen would
see little improvement in living standards.
   Conditions have grown worse since 1984 with the drop in the
price of oil, Indonesia's major export. The bank calculates that in
1987 the average Indonesian earned $450, down from $500 the year
before.
   Repetto wants to make it clear that he is not just quarrelling
with other statisticians. The failure to take account of
disappearing resources also distorts calculations about the growth
of assets on which governments lay their plans for the future, he
said.
   ``It's a kind of deficit financing, too important to be left to
statisticians,'' he added in an interview. ``This is like the
lawyer in the depression who told his wife at dinner that he'd had
a pretty good day _ no clients, but he managed to sell his desk.''
   Repetto said he had presented his work to the United Nations,
which is revising its method of calculating a country's growth. The
U.N. method is the standard method in use. He reported that U.N.
officials were sympathetic but do not have the money to make as
complete a revision as he's seeking.
   Repetto suggested that the cost would not be high, pointing out
that he did the present study in six months with the help of four
graduate students. The calculations need not be made for all
countries, only those where natural resources are a major part of
total resources, he said.
   ``That would have been true of the United States in 1850,'' he
explained. ``Now our big resource is a skilled and educated
population. We maintain our forest and soil, so taking depletion of
natural resources into account would not change our figures that
much, or the figures of other highly developed countries.''

   The picturesque southern Maine resort town of
Kennebunkport reverberated with eerie squeals, squawks and beeps
last weekend.
   It wasn't the sound of waterfowl or other wildlife. It was part
of a paging system used by the White House to alert reporters on
the Bush watch of impending presidential activities.
   An army of nearly 500 reporters, both American and French,
overtook Bush's vacation home for his meeting with French President
Francois Mitterrand.
   Now that the weather has turned warmer, Bush is expected to
return quite frequently to his family house on a point jutting into
the Atlantic Ocean.
   During his most recent visit, the U.S. press corps set up work
quarters at a Lithuanian Franciscan monastery in town and rented
electronic pagers from the White House.
   With a single phone call, White House official Bruce Zanca could
activate all the voice-alert pagers at once to let news people who
had strayed from the monastery know an event was about to take
place.
   Then they would all converge at the monastery at once. And that
always meant a chaotic arrival scene since few journalists hung
around the monastery when nothing was going on.
   Every time Bush would leave his compound _ to jog, to play golf,
to go to a restaurant _ there would be an announcement over the
paging system.
   Since reporters almost outnumbered locals in town, each time the
pagers went off simultaneously, there was an enormous cacophony
throughout town. Entire restaurants would erupt in the strange
noise. Tourists would pause on the sidewalk and gawk. Hotel lobbies
would buzz with the crackling announcements.
   One time, the pagers even went off _ dozens of them at once _ in
the middle of a press briefing at the monastery by press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater, who first looked perplexed, then bemused.

   There are now bumper stickers on cars in the Maine resort town
that proclaim: ``KenneBushport.'' A helipad has been added to the
Bush compound where a parking lot used to be. And there is a police
checkpoint on the road overlooking Bush's house.
   Traffic is directed to stop at a partial barricade so an officer
can tell motorists to go ahead. The road is only closed at night
and when Bush is leaving the compound.
   Bush was born in Massachusetts, grew up in Connecticut and
usually claims Texas as his home state.
   But that doesn't stop Maine from claiming him as a native son.
Bush has been vacationing there all his life.
   A packet of tourist information put out by the state of Maine
includes a ``Dear Friends'' cover letter that says, ``It is my
great pleasure to welcome you to the home state of the president of
the United States.''
   The letter was penned by Doro Bush LeBlond, Bush's daughter, who
recently went to work for the Maine Office of Tourism.

   Bush has been heeding his self-imposed rule against answering
reporters' questions at picture-taking sessions _ but with some
flexibility.
   Bush, meeting with the president of Iceland, Vigdis
Finnbogadottir, in the Oval Office earlier this week, ignored
reporters' first two questions. A radio reporter tried a final
shot: ``Any word from (Chancellor) Kohl yet?''
   At the time, there was considerable interest in whether the West
German leader had contacted Bush to discuss the latest in a round
of proposed compromises to ease a U.S.-West German split on the
future role of short-range nuclear weapons in western Europe.
   Bush, never taking his eyes off the Icelandic president, said,
``This is a photo opportunity, therefore I don't tell them, yes,
I've heard from Chancellor Kohl, because otherwise it would ruin
the discipline.''

<HEAD>Bush Plans to Expand Commercial Bank Powers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will try to jump start
last year's failed campaign by the Reagan administration to expand
commercial bank powers, a senior Treasury official says.
   Robert R. Glauber, Treasury undersecretary for finance, told a
financial services lobby group Tuesday that the Bush
administration, like the Reagan administration before it, believes
banks can compete against their foreign competitors only by
offering currently forbidden services, such as securities
underwriting.
   Glauber's speech to the Financial Services Council was the first
substantive statement on the subject by a senior Bush
administration official. And in later remarks to reporters, Glauber
said he hoped the restructuring could be addressed next year once
Bush's plan to rescue the savings and loan industry is passed.
   Glauber, the top administration policymaker for banking and
financial issues, noted that banks in France, West Germany and
Great Britain are permitted to underwrite, buy and sell securities,
offer insurance, develop real estate and invest in industrial
companies.
   Partly as a result of that, foreign banks have outgrown U.S.
institutions, he said, noting that in 1970 seven U.S. banks ranked
among the world's largest. That share slipped to three in 1980 and
none currently, he said.
   ``Permitting ... a broad array of financial services and
products ... can only help U.S. firms stem the loss of customers to
less regulated foreign firms,'' he said.
   However, U.S. banks have been barred from securities
underwriting since 1933, when Congress passed the Glass-Steagall
Act separating commercial and investment banking.
   Opponents of repealing Glass-Steagall argue that investment
banking is too risky for institutions with federally insured
deposits. But Glauber said: ``Securities underwriting is no more
risky _ and probably less risky _ than commercial lending.''
   He did not specify exactly how the administration would extend
new powers to banks, but he spoke favorably of a bill passed by the
Senate last year. Similar legislation foundered in the House,
caught in a jurisdictional dispute between two committee chairmen.
   The Senate bill, versions of which have been reintroduced this
year in both chambers of Congress, permitted bank holding
companies, through subsidiaries and with certain safeguards, to
underwrite corporate bonds and most other securities except
corporate stock.
   In remarks to reporters following his speech, Glauber said he
believed Congress would pause this year after passing Bush's
savings and loan plan and then tackle proposals for restructuring
of the financial system next year.
   The legislation's prospects could be hurt because some members
of Congress are blaming ill-advised deregulation for the S&amp;L
industry's problems.
   But, Glauber said, ``it is ... clear that the model of the
thrift industry in the early 1980s _ with its lack of private,
up-front capital and ill-supervised reform _ is not the model to be
followed as we move forward.''

<HEAD>Rain Eases Drought, No Help For Wheat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain has helped take the edge off persistent
drought conditions in the central and southern Great Plains and has
slowed field work in the eastern Corn Belt and the Delta region,
say government crop watchers.
   But despite the rain, the outlook for winter wheat in much of
the plains continues to be poor. Harvest is under way in several
states, including Texas and Oklahoma.
   On Capitol Hill, lawmakers are putting together a 1989 version
of last year's huge $3.9 billion drought aid package. Although no
firm cost estimate has been tied to the current package, it would
contain many of the financial aid features of last year's measure.
   The latest report by the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility
said corn planting nationally was 84 percent complete by the end of
the May 15-21 survey week, lagging the normal pace by only two
percentage points. However, in the wetter areas of the eastern Corn
Belt, planting of the new crop lagged far behind.
   ``Planting was complete in Texas and nearly complete in Georgia,
Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska,'' the report said.
   But in Ohio, where 85 percent of the corn acreage is usually
planted by now, only 24 percent was seeded, the report said. In
Pennsylvania, 19 percent of the corn was planted by May 21,
compared with 62 percent in normal years.
   The weather facility, operated by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments, said the 1989 soybean crop was about 39 percent
planted, only two percentage points behind normal. However,
plantings lagged sharply in some areas, including Ohio, where only
6 percent of the estimated soybean acreage had been planted,
compared with a normal 56 percent.
   Cotton plantings, at 60 percent, were nine points behind the
usual rate. Although planting was complete in California, it lagged
in the Delta and Southeast.
   A related report by the USDA's 1989 drought task force headed by
Undersecretary Richard Crowder said that ``timely rains in the Corn
Belt are promoting rapid germination and establishment of this
year's crop.''
   But the report added that the impact of recent rain in winter
wheat areas will depend, in part, on future weather.
   ``If another (weather) front brings more rain as predicted,
moderate improvement in crop conditions could occur,'' the task
force said.
   The National Weather Service calls for ``moderate to heavy rain
in the Great Plains and Corn Belt in the next 5 to 10 days,'' it
added. ``The outlook through mid-June still calls for cool, wet
weather in the South and East, and warm, dry weather from the
eastern Dakotas into the central Corn Belt.''
   A new 30- and 90-day weather outlook is scheduled to be issued
by the Weather Service next week.
   Meanwhile, leaders of the House Agriculture Committee agreed
Tuesday to push through a broad package of assistance this week for
farmers suffering crop losses from continuing drought.
   The committee, under the agreement worked out by Democrats and
Republicans, will act on the legislation at a session Thursday. The
relief package will be brought before the House at an undetermined
date after lawmakers return from a Memorial Day recess.
   ``I think the chances that a bill will be passed and signed into
law by the president ... have dramatically improved,'' Rep. Pat
Roberts, R-Kan., said after the meeting of committee leaders,
including the panel's chairman, Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas.
   The aid package will mirror relief programs enacted by Congress
last year to aid producers in the Midwest and northern Great Plains.
   In general, federal payments would be made to farmers who suffer
losses of more than 35 percent on their crops.
   The relief would be available for all crops _ not just specific
hard-hit ones like wheat _ because of damages from drought,
freezing temperatures, hail, excessive moisture and other problems,
according to Scott Swenson, a spokesman for Rep. Dan Glickman,
D-Kan., chairman of the Agriculture subcomittee on wheat, soybeans
and feed grains.
   Lawmakers are considering the new drought package because the
Agriculture Department has said the 1989 winter wheat crop doesn't
qualify for any of the $3.9 billion in assistance approved in 1988.
   A group of senators last week introduced drought relief
legislation to extend last year's assistance programs to the winter
wheat crop. Similar proposals had been offered in the House.
   But Roberts said House committee leaders decided to go with a
``generic bill'' as a way of broadening support as well as ensuring
that adequate aid is available to spring-planted crops if the
drought worsens or spreads to other regions.
   According to USDA's current estimate, the 1989 winter wheat
harvest may hit an 11-year low of 1.43 billion bushels, including a
drop of more than one-third in Kansas, traditionally the nation's
leading producer.
   Under last year's relief program, farmers received federal
payments covering 65 percent of income lost from the crop damages
exceeding 35 percent, and 90 percent of income lost from damages to
that portion of the crop exceeding 75 percent losses.
   Swenson said a similar formula is planned in the House bill
although that could be changed later.
   Roberts said recent crop estimates by USDA made it clear that
the costs of any drought relief program shouldn't pose a budget
problem. The federal wheat subsidy program is expected to cost much
less this year because of higher market prices stemming from the
drought.

   A human guinea pig says she made friends
with mice and learned some English during her 130 days in an
underground cave to help researchers study the effects of isolation.
   Stefania Follini of Ancona, Italy, smiled and waved at reporters
and well-wishers as she emerged Tuesday afternoon from Lost Cave,
ending an experiment that began on Jan. 13.
   Would she do it again?
   ``Sure,'' said the 27-year-old interior decorator, who
volunteered for the experiment.
   Miss Follini, who lost 17 pounds during her solitude and now
weighs 90 pounds, appeared healthy and happy as she answered
questions from reporters.
   Although she had no contact with humans, except through
computers, Miss Follini said she didn't feel lonely during the
experiment and adopted two cave mice as pets. She named them
Giuseppe and Nicoleta.
   ``There was some difficulty in communicating with the mice,''
she said through an interpreter. ``But I was always right.''
   The experiment was designed to resemble interplanetary travel.
The University of Ancona in Italy, the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration and several U.S. universities took part in the
experiment.
   Miss Follini's only contact with the outside world was through
computer terminals linked between her 10-foot-square
plastic-enclosed underground habitat and the researchers' house
trailer above the cave.
   She had no clocks, her menstrual cycle stopped, and she lost
track of how many days had passed. When she was told Monday the
experiment was almost over, she thought she had been in the cave
about 80 days. She tended to sleep about 10 hours and stay awake 20
to 25 hours.
   Three video cameras and microphones monitored Miss Follini
constantly. Only the bathroom was out of sight of cameras. She said
she didn't mind the lack of privacy.
   ``I rarely thought about it,'' she said. ``Sometimes I felt it
was a strong presence, but generally I was not bothered by that.''
   When Miss Follini climbed out of the cave into the midday sun,
she appeared disoriented for a few seconds. But she quickly donned
sunglasses handed to her, then grinned and waved at the 60
onlookers.
   At the news conference, she said she thinks her isolation will
make her more thoughtful, outgoing and decisive. And she said her
outlook has improved.
   ``I consider myself more important,'' she said. ``I love myself
more and consequently I can love people and the world more.''
   Scientists plan to examine her intensively during the next few
months to find out if her isolation affected her mentally and
physically.
   For example, project coordinator Maurizio Montalbini _ who spent
210 days in a cave two years ago _ believes the isolation will help
Miss Follini's concentration. A NASA-affiliated research team at
the University of Texas Medical School in Houston plans to test
that Monday by monitoring Miss Follini's brain waves while she
solves computer-generated problems.
   Other scientists will be drawing blood and checking her immune
system, bones, muscles and coordination. Some believe her immune
system was suppressed, her bones lost calcium and her muscles
weakened.
   But Montalbini said he thinks Miss Follini might surprise
researchers. He said she kept her strength and flexibility by doing
calisthenics and judo and maintained her poise by keeping busy by
reading and decorating her living area.
   The researchers chose Lost Cave because it maintains a constant
climate of 74 degrees and 99 percent humidity and is relatively
close to Houston, home to NASA and many researchers.
   Before the experiment began, Miss Follini said she was taking
English textbooks with her and would answer questions in English.
She did understand simple questions and was able to answer in short
English phrases, but she didn't master the language in 130 days.
   ``When she was down there, she had English and Spanish books to
learn,'' said translator Rita Fraschini. ``But the English one was
difficult and boring, so she switched to the Spanish one, which was
funny.''

<HEAD>Equipment Makers Say Sharp Reduction of Auto Pollution is Possible</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The companies that make motor vehicle
anti-pollution equipment predict they can meet the tough emissions
standards proposed in a clean air bill favored by environmentalists
but denounced as too extreme by the auto industry.
   Strongly disagreeing with auto industry witnesses, the
Manufacturers of Emission Controls Association told a House panel
Tuesday that its companies could produce pollution control
equipment that would meet the proposed standards for 100,000 miles
of driving each vehicle.
   Bruce Bertlesen, executive director of the group, said the
association based its assessment on continuing progress in
developing better anti-pollution equipment, more advanced engine
controls and continued reduction of lead contamination in unleaded
fuel.
   ``The most serious challenge to meeting these more stringent
emission standards is maintaining emission control performance
during the useful life of the vehicle under real world
conditions,'' the association said. ``We believe the engineering
challenges can be resolved.''
   At a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce health
subcommittee, the association strongly endorsed emission testing
programs to ensure that owners keep their vehicles properly tuned.
   Bertlesen testified at the first hearing on legislation by Rep.
Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., subcommittee chairman, to reduce air
pollution at a time that virtually every U.S. city has failed to
meet federal air quality standards. While reducing pollution from
motor vehicles is a major part of the bill, it also attempts to cut
emissions from industrial sources and consumer products.
   But the debate over auto, truck and bus emissions standards is
likely to determine whether Congress _ as happened last year _ lets
a clean air bill die in a legislative stalemate.
   The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United
States, representing the ``Big Three'' U.S. automakers, told
Waxman's panel the best way to reduce pollution from motor vehicles
is by waiting for the normal phase-out of older cars still on the
road.
   Thomas H. Hanna, president and chief executive officer of the
association, said less than half the vehicles now in use were built
under the latest emissions standards. He blamed the older vehicles
for nearly 90 percent of the hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide
emissions, and more than 7 percent of the nitrogen oxides _ major
pollutants from motor vehicles.
   He predicted that a further tightening of emission requirements
would have ``a minimal air quality benefit compared to vehicle
fleet turnover.''
   Gregory Dana, vice president of the Automobile Importers of
America Inc., representing major manufacturers of foreign cars,
called Waxman's bill ``extreme and unreasonable'' and said the
legislation presents a challenge that is ``simply unattainable.''
   Waxman's bill would toughen tailpipe emission standards for
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides; set new requirements to reduce
hydrocarbon pollution from the evaporation of gasoline at the pump
and on the road; and require that emission controls last the full
useful life of an automobile.
   The tailpipe standards would kick in for passenger cars
beginning in the 1992 model year and become even tougher in the
2000 model year.
   An alternative bill, sponsored by nine House members as a
compromise between the auto industry and the environmentalists,
would toughen current standards but not nearly as much as the
Waxman bill. The nine lawmakers would use the best available
technology in requiring new emissions requirements starting in
1993, while the Waxman measure aims to force automakers to develop
new anti-pollution technology.
   Backing Waxman's position were environmental groups including
the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council, and
public officials representing state and county governments,
including Vermont Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin representing the National
Governors' Association.
   ``Mobile sources account for half, or more, of the air
pollutants that threaten public health in our cities, and we simply
must demand more of the motor vehicle manufacturers,'' she said.
``We need automobiles that drive us where we want to go, without
driving us to environmental destruction,'' she said.

   More than 300 federal prisoners at a
privately operated detention center refused to return to their
cells to protest living conditions and food quality, authorities
said.
   Law enforcement officers from 12 federal, state and local
agencies were dispatched to the Eden Detention Center in central
Texas to quell the disturbance, officials said.
   The inmates were upset with prison conditions and food and
refused to return to their dormitories, Concho County Sheriff Bill
Fiveash said. He said a few mattresses were burned, but the protest
was generally non-violent.
   The disturbance was reported shortly after 5 p.m., and appeared
to involve most of the 330 inmates. By 11:30 p.m., fewer than 100
inmates remained in the yard.
   ``We will not take any steps. We will let them sit in the yard
and wait,'' Jim Eyskens, a federal Bureau of Prisons officer based
in San Antonio, said of those inmates. ``I'm certain this will be
resolved without force.''
   Roy Burnes, the owner of the detention center, denied that
inmates burned mattresses. ``Nothing was burned,'' Burnes told The
Associated Press. He then said he didn't have time to talk and hung
up.
   Some civilian employees who had locked themselves inside were
escorted out.
   A prison official who refused to identify herself said no one
was in immediate danger.
   A fire in December caused more than $1 million in damage to the
prison. The detention center closed for 35 days afterward until a
new 60,000-square-foot addition could be built.
   Before the fire, the prison held 200 prisoners. The addition was
designed to hold 365 inmates, but the number of inmates was not
immediately known.
   Most of the prisoners the government has contracted with the
facility to hold are illegal aliens who are serving sentences of 18
months or fewer for federal crimes, said Greg Bogdan, a spokesman
for the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Washington.
   The 203 prisoners at the detention center at the time of the
fire had to be transferred to other centers in Texas. The section
destroyed by fire is being renovated and, when it is completed, the
prison will hold 500.
   In July 1987, prisoners at the facility signed a letter
complaining of violations of civil rights, Bureau of Prison
standards and sanitation. Prisoners said in the letter that they
were offered real meat only once a week. They later complained of a
lack of recreation facilities.
   A federal prison inspector recommended improvements in prison
employee training.
   Burnes later in 1987 said he planned to change the prison
population makeup from illegal aliens to white-collar, short-term
federal prisoners.

   Efforts to halt the rising number of
adolescent pregnancies in Southern states should be aimed at boys
as well as young girls, said a plan released today.
   ``Every three minutes, a girl aged 10-17 gives birth in the
United States,'' said the study. ``That stark fact spells tragedy
for mother, father and child, and it costs our communities
enormously in both human and economic terms.
   ``Southern communities are most affected because, as a region,
we have the highest rates of adolescent pregnancy and
childbearing,'' it said. ``Prevention is our best hope of ending
this epidemic and helping our children grow up before they have
children of their own.''
   The plan was compiled by the Southern Regional Project on Infant
Mortality, in cooperation with the Southern Governors' Association
and the Southern Legislative Conference.
   The 17 southern states in the study had a higher rate of
adolescent pregnancy than the rest of the country, the report
noted. In 1985, 47 percent of the nation's 178,000 births to girls
under age 17 occurred in 17 southern states, even though only 37
percent of girls under 17 live in the South. Among girls under 17
with second or higher order births that year, 49 percent were in
the South.
   In the southern states, the public costs of teenage
childbearing, in the form of food, welfare and medical assistance,
totaled $3.58 billion in fiscal 1987, the report said.
   ``When our children have children, we all lose,'' said
Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus, co-chairman of the group that produced
the report. ``Adolescent parents and their babies face hardships
they are not prepared for _ risks of poor health, incomplete
educations, poverty and welfare dependency.
   ``The rest of us lose them, their talents, abilities and
leadership, and we pay a lot more to treat the problem than we
would to prevent it,'' he said.
   Males should be included in all pregnancy prevention programs
because focusing solely on females ``ignores half the problem,''
the report said.
   It recommended promotion of education and life skills at the
earliest possible age through state and federal spending on early
childhood education programs and the expansion of Head Start.
   It also called for encouraging children to complete high school,
including taking ``family life'' courses designed by parents and
local school boards.
   In addition, the report called for better job prospects and more
community involvement for adolescents, improved health care for
young people, and help for parents.
   ``As the primary shapers of their children, parents mold the
value system of their children and this value system frames the way
in which these children view early sexual involvement and early
parenthood,'' the report said.
   The 17 states are Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Georgia,
Alabama, South Carolina, Florida, Texas, Delaware, Tennessee,
Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Missouri
and West Virginia.

<HEAD>GAO Said To Urge Review of Choices For New Military Reactors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department misled Congress last
year about key aspects of its plan for building new military
reactors in South Carolina and Idaho, the General Accounting Office
said in a report prepared for publication today.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, was scheduled to
detail its charges at a hearing of the House Armed Services nuclear
facilities subcommittee, which is examining the Bush
administration's plans for modernizing the nuclear weapons complex.
   The administration is pushing for financing to start development
of one new reactor at the Savannah River Site, near Aiken, S.C.,
and another at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, near
Idaho Falls.
   The reactors, estimated to cost a total of about $7.5 billion,
would produce tritium, a radioactive gas needed in the production
of nuclear warheads.
   The government's only existing tritium-producing reactors, also
situated at Savannah River, have been shut down since last spring
for safety reasons. They are scheduled to resume operation next
year, but their reliability is in doubt.
   The GAO, in a condensed preliminary draft of its study on the
reactor plan, said ``Congress was misinformed'' by the Energy
Department on how long it would take to get the new Idaho and
Savannah River reactors running, according to a congressional
source who saw the draft. The source asked not to be identified.
   The draft report said the department ``needs to reconsider'' its
decision, announced last summer, to put the new reactors in Idaho
and South Carolina. It also said the projects' cost accounting was
not clear.
   One alternative to these sites is the Hanford Nuclear
Reservation near Richland, Wash., where the Washington Public Power
Supply System's No. 1 plant could be converted to tritium
production. The GAO estimated this would cost about two-thirds as
much as building new reactors from scratch elsewhere, and
production could be started much earlier.
   The Energy Department has said a high-temperature gas-cooled
reactor at Idaho could be put into operation in about 10 years, but
the GAO said it would take 13{ years, the source said. The
technology for this type of reactor is not yet fully developed.
   The new Savannah River facility would be a heavy water reactor,
a technology already in use. The GAO said it would take about 12{
years to get this plant running, while the department has estimated
10 years.
   The Hanford reactor, which was built for commercial use but
abandoned because of a regional power surplus, could be converted
to military use within about seven years, the report said.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said last month that while it
is economically and technically feasible to convert the Hanford
plant to tritium production, that approach is a ``political
nightmare'' that he did not want to pursue.
   Watkins said one of the main sticking points with converting the
Hanford plant is whether it would violate the letter or spirit of
the nuclear non-proliferation agreement. He said the State
Department had reviewed that question and concluded that, strictly
speaking, conversion would not violate the treaty.
   ``The question is, who wants to get into the game of deciding
whether or not you should go forward and propose essentially a
commercial reactor generating nuclear material?'' Watkins said.
   Two prominent scientists, in testimony before the nuclear
facilities panel Tuesday, said it would be wasteful and premature
for the administration to move ahead now with construction of new
military reactors, regardless of their location.
   Carson Mark, a former designer of atomic weapons, and George
Rathjens, a former chief scientist in the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency, said the United States has more than enough
tritium to sustain its nuclear arsenal for several years.

   A convicted murderer was executed by
injection early Wednesday for the 1981 slaying of a woman who was
abducted and raped after her car broke down on a freeway.
   Stephen McCoy, whose final appeal was rejected by the U.S.
Supreme Court late Tuesday, was executed at 12:25 a.m. at the state
Department of Corrections' Walls Unit here.
   He gave no final statement. He coughed five times after the
injection was made about 12:15 a.m. and groaned twice.
   His brother-in-law, two friends and his attorney, Karen Zellars,
were among the witnesses.
   The nation's highest court denied him a stay by a 5-4 vote
without comment.
   The 40-year-old Houston electrician was the 31st Texas convict
and the 110th in the nation executed since the 1976 U.S. Supreme
Court ruling allowing states to resume capital punishment.
   McCoy was convicted in the slaying of Cynthia Johnson, 18, who
was abducted as she was returning home from a New Year's Eve party
on Jan. 1, 1981.
   According to trial testimony, McCoy and two other men abducted
the woman. McCoy raped her, then held her legs down while James
Paster and Gary LeBlanc strangled her with an electrical cord.
   Paster then drove a nail up the woman's nose to make certain she
was dead, said the man who prosecuted the case.
   ``The death penalty was made for people like Stephen Albert
McCoy to protect society from people like him and from people like
James Paster,'' said prosecutor George Lambright. ``It was the
cold-bloodedness of the acts.''
   McCoy insisted he was in another room when the woman was slain.
   ``I knew what was going on,'' he said in a death row interview.
``I just couldn't do anything about it.''
   Paster, awaiting death for another slaying, received a life
sentence for the Johnson killing. Last month, he was caught with
another death row inmate in an unsuccessful escape attempt.
   LeBlanc, who testified for the state, received a 35-year prison
sentence.
   McCoy was in prison serving five years for burglary when he was
charged with the Johnson slaying. McCoy, Paster and LeBlanc also
were linked to a 1980 murder-for-hire in Houston and the rape and
stabbing of a woman.
   Attorneys for McCoy raised nine issues in their appeal,
including objections to jury selection, McCoy's competence to stand
trial and ineffective legal assistance. There also was no evidence
presented at his trial to show McCoy was a continued threat to
society, according to Zellars.
   State attorneys called the appeal arguments frivolous.

   The popularity of unregulated shooting sports
like target practice in open fields isn't a good reason to permit
people to buy semiautomatic assault-style weapons, a law
enforcement official contends.
   ``In order to save lives, if we must sacrifice someone's minor
recreational endeavor in order to do that, I think that's a
sacrifice we can make in this country,'' said Baltimore County
Police Chief Neil J. Behan, the president of Police Executive
Research Forum.
   ``I think lives are far more important,'' Behan said Tuesday as
he helped launch a new ad campaign _ sponsored by Handgun Control
Inc. _ calling for a ban on semiautomatic assault-style firearms.
   The Bush administration imposed a temporary ban on imports of
such weapons in March, and President Bush last week called for a
permanent ban on imports that aren't intended for sporting use. He
also called for a ban on ammunition magazines with more than 15
rounds.
   The actions surprised the National Rifle Association, since
Bush, a lifetime NRA member, said earlier this year he opposed
limits on the weapons. His wife Barbara said they should be banned.
   The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is studying
whether the weapons are used for sports, a study that focuses on
regulations on hunting and target competitions.
   David Conover, an NRA lobbyist, contended that ``plinking,'' or
target practice in open fields, is a legitimate sport, even if
those who engage in it don't participate in formal competitions.
   A public outcry for limits on the weapons erupted after a man
armed with a semiautomatic version of an AK-47 opened fire in
January on a schoolyard in Stockton, Calif., killing five children.
The guns have also been widely used in drug-related shootings.
   Behan said the proliferation of semiautomatic assault-style
weapons, ``like the proliferation of handguns, it's now becoming a
national disgrace.''
   Crimes involving assault-style weapons have risen 78 percent in
the past two years, he said.
   ``The carnage is increasing,'' he said as he called for a ban on
domestically produced versions of the weapons as well as imported
ones, saying that two-thirds of the assault-style firearms in the
United States are made in this country.
   The Atlanta Constitution reported Sunday that an assault-style
gun is 20 times more likely to be used in crime than a conventional
firearm. While only 1 million of the 200 million privately owned
guns in the country are assault-style weapons, they were used in
one of every 10 crimes that resulted in a firearms trace last year,
the paper reported.
   Behan urged support for a bill sponsored by Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, that would place some of the same restrictions
on semiautomatic assault-style pistols and rifles that are now
imposed on automatic weapons, including FBI background checks and
fingerprinting of purchasers. The bill also would limit magazine
size to 20 rounds.
   Behan said he believes ``it's only a matter of time'' before
Congress bans the weapons, adding, ``In any legislative approach,
what wins is persistence.''
   San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy said law enforcement
officials can ``overcome the lobby of the National Rifle
Association.'' The NRA ``impacts on elected sheriffs just like it
does elected members of Congress. If we can stand the heat, so can
they,'' he said.
   The Police Executive Research Forum is an organization of chief
executives of the largest city, county and state law enforcement
agencies. Other organizations supporting bans on assault-style
weapons include the Fraternal Order of Police, the International
Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association
and the National Association of Police Organizations.

   President Bush, himself an avid picture-taker,
jokes that the press photographers who cover him helped get him
good publicity during the first part of his administration by
focusing on the family dogs.
   Bush personally presented the annual awards of the White House
News Photographers' Association Tuesday.
   The president told the black-tie dinner attended by more than
1,000 persons, ``Actually, I dropped in to see if my prints were
ready.''
   ``It's no secret that I am a great fan of White House
photographers. After all, those first 100 days were saved by those
puppy pictures,'' said Bush, referring to the puppies produced by
Millie, the family dog.
   The association selected Bruce Dale of National Geographic as
still photographer of the year and Steven C. Affens of WJLA-TV in
Washington as cameraman of the year. Affens has won that honor four
times in a row.
   The photographers gave Bush a framed copy of the Life Magazine
that ran 10 of his Polaroid shots of friends seated on the bed in
the Lincoln Room, and a new Polaroid camera so he can shoot away in
the Oval Office.

   Pressure is building on Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan to abandon his support for an
Oklahoma state official whom conservative, pro-life advocates
oppose for a top job in the department.
   But Sullivan continues to support Robert Fulton to head the
Family Services Administration at HHS, which manages the
government's major welfare programs, a spokesman for the secretary
said.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, suggested Tuesday that the secretary
stop pushing the White House to nominate Fulton, who is under fire
for his handling of the deaths of two dozen babies with the
crippling deformity spina bifida. The incidents occurred at an
Oklahoma state hospital while he headed the state's human services
department.
   Hatch said that while he is still looking into the allegations
against Fulton, ``I think there's lots of indication he might want
to put this in abeyance and back off.''
   ``I think it's going to be a cause celebre if he (Sullivan)
continues with it,'' Hatch said. ``I'm not sure he needs to get in
the middle of a great big fight over it right now.''
   Sullivan has run afoul of right-to-life advocates before with
comments that appeared to support abortion rights. To mollify his
critics, he agreed to recommend for nomination to several top jobs
at the agency people acceptable to pro-life groups.
   The welfare job was not among the jobs mentioned at the time and
its duties do not have much to do with abortion. However, a group
of conservative Republican senators say Fulton's actions in the
spina bifida matter show him to be too insensitive to the
right-to-life views.
   Fulton, who is now Oklahoma secretary of social services, is
criticized for failing to act promptly to end the Oklahoma state
hospital policy of withholding life-saving care from spina bifida
babies.
   Fulton says that shortly after he became director of the state
human services department, he learned of the policy and put into
effect regulations and policies designed to assure such denial of
treatment would not recurr.
   But critics say the protections he instituted were required by
federal law and they note that the doctors involved were never
sanctioned.
   Fulton and Sullivan met with half a dozen senators on Capitol
Hill earlier this month to try to allay their concerns. However,
following the meeting, Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., and five other
senators signed a letter to President Bush expressing their
continued opposition to Fulton.
   Hatch was not among them, but he said the spina bifida
allegations ``disturb me'' and need further review, as do new
concerns that are being raised.
   Among the new charges is one that Fulton lobbied against
requirements in a bill in Congress last year that required welfare
recipients to work for their benefits. That requirement is part of
the new welfare reform law HHS must put into effect.
   Fulton said the provision he lobbied for on behalf of his boss,
Oklahoma Gov. Henry Bellmon, is similar to the provision that
appeared in the final version of the bill and is now law. ``I've
been a supporter of workfare for a long, long time,'' he said.
   Hatch also said he is looking into a lawsuit filed against
Fulton for a policy he established as human services director that
allegedly discriminated against women. The case was referred by the
state Supreme Court to the State Merit Protection Commission, where
it is pending.

<HEAD>Radioactive Antibodies Seek and Destroy Cancer Inside the Body</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nuclear-tipped antibodies that seek and
destroy cancer inside the body show promise of giving doctors a new
way to attack tumors, researchers say.
   The goal is to blitz cancer cells with huge doses of killer
radiation. Doctors launch the attack with protein probes that hunt
down the cancer deep within the body.
   In initial experimental use, researchers found that the strategy
wiped out all detectable cancer in people who were not helped by
ordinary treatment. However, far more study will be necessary
before researchers know for sure whether this approach will cure
cancer.
   The findings were presented Tuesday by Dr. Oliver W. Press of
the University of Washington to the annual meeting of the American
Society of Clinical Oncology.
   Press is one of several researchers around the country who are
working with radioactive antibodies to combat cancer. However, he
said his group is using the highest doses of radiation yet tried.
   ``We're trying to blast them out of the water,'' he said.
   Antibodies are natural hunters produced by the body to find
germs, cancer and other dangerous invaders. Scientists can now
produce large quantities of antibodies that look for cancer, and
they have fitted them with powerful warheads of radioactive iodine.
   With this strategy, doctors believe they can deliver far higher
doses of radiation than would otherwise be possible and still spare
healthy tissue from harm.
   Press and colleagues have given the treatment to seven people
with the blood cancer lymphoma. All had failed an average of four
kinds of chemotherapy. The treatment wiped out all visible signs of
the cancer in five of them.
   ``The percentage of patients responding is much greater than we
would expect from conventional chemotherapy,'' said Dr. Bruce
Cheson of the National Cancer Institute.
   In other research presented at the meeting:
   _Dr. Donald S. Kaufman of Massachusetts General Hospital
reported preliminary evidence that a combination of three drugs
followed by radiation can eliminate bladder cancer. If this
approach works out, it would provide an alternative to surgical
removal of the bladder, which is now standard treatment.
   _Many doctors are reluctant to give chemotherapy to women with
early breast cancer, because most can be cured by surgery alone.
Dr. Alexander Paterson of Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton,
Alberta, has found that those who relapse often carry multiple
copies of an abnormal gene, known as an oncogene, inside their
tumors. Checking for this gene may help doctors target chemotherapy
to those who are most likely to benefit.
   _Dr. Gastan Rivera of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in
Memphis, Tenn., said a review shows that about two-thirds of all
youngsters with acute lymphocytic leukemia, the most common
childhood cancer, can now be cured. He attributed the improved
outlook for this disease, which was once almost uniformly fatal, to
continued improvement in chemotherapy.
   _Dr. James D. Levine of New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston
said a new treatment can overcome low levels of white blood cells,
which are a common side effect of treatment with the drug AZT in
AIDS patients. The therapy, called granulocyte-macrophage colony
stimulating factor, prompts the body to produce more blood cells.
   _Dr. Gregory Wolf of the University of Michigan said a
combination of chemotherapy and radiation shows promise of allowing
doctors to avoid removing the voicebox in victims of advanced
throat cancer. People who received the new treatment appear to have
as good a chance of survival as do surgery patients, and most
retain their ability to speak.
   _Dr. Harinder Garewal of the Veterans Administration Medical
Center in Tucson said initial studies suggest that a nutrient
called beta carotene can reverse precancerous growths in the mouth.
This condition, known as oral leukoplakia, is common in smokers.
Many vegetables are high in beta carotene, which the body converts
to vitamin A.

<HEAD>Prominent Scientists Oppose Administration Plan to Produce Tritium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prominent scientists are blasting as wasteful
and premature a Bush administration plan to expand production of a
key material for nuclear warheads.
   Carson Mark, a former designer of atomic weapons, and George
Rathjens, a former chief scientist in the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency, told Congress on Tuesday that the United States
has more than enough tritium to sustain its nuclear arsenal for
several years.
   Tritium is a radioactive gas used to boost the explosive power
of nuclear warheads.
   The two scientists were testifying before a special House panel
investigating the nation's tritium needs and the administration's
plans for modernizing its weapons facilities.
   Senior officials from the Pentagon and the State Department also
testified publicly, and intelligence agency officials later
appeared before the panel in a closed session.
   The only three U.S. reactors capable of producing tritium,
located at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, have been
shut down for safety reasons since last spring. The administration
has cited an urgent need to get them running by early next year.
   President Bush also has endorsed a plan developed by the Reagan
administration to build by 1998 two new tritium-producing reactors,
one at Savannah River and the other in Idaho, at a cost of
approximately $7.5 billion.
   Both Rathjens and Mark said it's not necessary to rush a restart
of the Savannah River reactors, which have been plagued by
structural and operator problems in recent years. The pair also
advised postponing the decision on whether to spend the huge sums
needed to build the two new-generation reactors.
   ``Until well into the next century, I don't believe we need to
worry about production'' of tritium, Rathjens said. ``We're not
balancing on a knife's edge.''
   Rathjens suggested the administration propose to the Soviet
Union a mutual moratorium on tritium production as a means of
advancing arms control. To forge ahead with construction of two new
tritium-producing reactors would ``send the wrong signal'' to the
Soviets and U.S. allies about American interest in disarmament, he
said.
   A new construction plan might lead the Soviets to think ``we are
contemplating at least a doubling of our weapons stockpile'' or
planning to produce a large number of neutron weapons, which
require more tritium per weapon, Rathjens said.
   He and Mark support House and Senate bills introduced last week
that call on the administration to negotiate a U.S.-Soviet ban on
the production of plutonium, also needed to make nuclear warheads.
The administration opposes the bills.
   ``We need to have those Savannah River reactors restarted as
soon as we can,'' Robert Barker, the defense secretary's top
adviser on atomic energy, told the panel. He submitted a written
statement, dated April 26, that said, ``We are near the point where
this tritium will be exhausted'' unless production is resumed.
   U.S. supplies of both weapons-grade plutonium and tritium are
classified.

   The dollar ended sharply higher against the
Japanese yen Wednesday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange reversed an earlier downward trend in the afternoon and
inched up.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
251.25 points the previous day, slightly rebounded to gain 35.21
points, or 0.10 percent, and finish the day's trading at 33,851.82
points.
   The dollar closed at 143.00 yen, up 1.05 yen from Tuesday's
close of 141.95 yen. The currency started trading at 143.15 yen and
moved between 142.45 yen and 143.70 yen.
   The dollar's strength continued in Tokyo following a similar
dollar-buying trend Tuesday in New York, where comments by Federal
Reserve Board Governor Robert Heller ignited the currency's
uptrend. The U.S. currency ended trading at 142.33 yen in New York.
   Heller, speaking at the National Economists Club, said
``inflation is not dead. You don't want to declare victory too
early.''
   The Fed should ``proceed in a prudednt fashion'' to continue to
observe inflation trends before making a monetary policy shift, he
said.
   Minori Takeuchi, a dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo, said the
Bank of Japan intervened in the market, selling the dollar
intermittently in the morning session, but the amount it sold was
unknown. The central bank does not comment on its monetary
activities.
   ``The dollar's surge never stops unless the United States shows
us its monetary policy because the market's demand for the dollar
is still so strong,'' she said.
   On the stock exchange, trading was thin mainly due to the yen's
weakness against the dollar and uncertainties over the possible
discount rate hike, said a dealer with Nomura Securities, Japan's
largest brokerage.
   ``The majority of market players think a 0.5 percent hike would
not be effective to stabilize the markets,'' he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Market sources have expected the central bank to raise its
official discount rate by at least 0.5 percent from its current 2.5
percent. Neither the bank nor the Finance Ministry has officially
commented on a rate hike.
   The dollar's recent surge and speculation for a substantial
discount rate increase have already discouraged investors'
stock-buying interest, the dealer added.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germans today celebrate 40 years
of a statehood that has brought them peace and prosperity, but many
feel a nagging guilt over the fate of their brothers in the east.
   The ``German Question'' _ reunification with East Germany _
still haunts West Germany despite its postwar emergence as a
financially strong and influential independent power.
   New generations on either side of the concrete and barbed-wire
border have diluted the fervor for reunification and added to the
traditional questions of ``whether?'' and ``when?'' the
consideration, ``at what price?''
   The appeal for a single Germany has gained momentum from the
recent East-West warming trend.
   Many West Germans have relatives in the other Germany, and about
one in five have visited the Communist eastern state over the past
decade, according to the Institute for Opinion Research in
Allensbach.
   But ``you get an entirely different picture when the German
question asks not just whether reunification is desirable, but
whether one is willing to see West Germany leave the NATO alliance
to achieve it,'' said the institute's Gerhard Herdegen in an
interview.
   Yet in a January survey, 51 percent of the West Germans polled
said they would be willing to trade NATO membership for
reunification.
   The appeal of neutrality and better relations with Eastern
Europe has also been reflected in Bonn's recent dispute with the
NATO alliance over the future of its short-range nuclear missiles.
   And it may gain momentum next month if Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev indicates during a planned visit a willingness to
consider eventual reunification, as has been predicted by some
officials.
   ``We are certainly not expecting him to signal readiness for
reunification, but he could indicate in some way that the subject
is open for further discussion,'' said Peter Hausmann, spokesman
for the Christian Social Union of Bavaria, which is aligned with
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democrats.
   Others have dismissed the rekindling of reunification talk to
the recent troubles between Bonn and the NATO alliance.
   ``After seemingly being filed to the archives, the subject of
German reunification rises again whenever German-American relations
are not doing so well, whenever Bonn does not do what Washington
believes is right,'' the centrist Westdeutsche Allgemeine newspaper
of Essen commented last week.
   It, too, suggested Gorbachev may signal some willingness to
accept a reunited Germany, banking on a neutral state posing less
of a threat to Moscow than as a member of the NATO alliance.
   Kohl, who faces a tough re-election campaign next year, has been
waxing optimistic on the reunification question.
   ``Not all of our dreams have been fulfilled,'' Kohl noted in a
statement on the eve of the 40th anniversary. ``We remain under the
order of our Basic Law to make complete the unity and freedom of
Germany. In recent years the hope has grown that this goal can be
achieved.''
   The federal government's program for observing the anniversary
notes ``the division remains a bitter reality for Germans.''
   But if West Germans have made a few tentative steps forward with
the political question of reunification, the advance has brought
them a closer look at the costs.
   Among the improvements noted in relations between the two
Germanys has been a major increase in the number of East Germans
allowed to emigrate to the west, which has strained the budgets and
patience of communities hosting the settlers.
   While West Germans remain committed in principle to
reunification, it would require an expensive overhaul of the aging
and outdated industries of the east and subsidies to boost living
standards _ perhaps at the expense of their own.

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Governing party chief Lee Huan was named
Taiwan's new premier today, succeeding Yu Kuo-hua, who has been
criticized as taking an overly cautious approach to economic and
political reform.
   A statement from the party said Lee's appointment was
unanimously approved by the 31 members of the policy-making Central
Standing Committee at a regular weekly meeting chaired by President
Lee Teng-hui, who had nominated Lee Huan.
   Yu, 75, will continue to serve as premier until later this month
when the lawmaking Legislative Yuan, which is controlled by the
Nationalists, will formally approve Lee Huan's appointment.
   Lee Huan, the party's 72-year-old secretary general, will name a
new Cabinet but observers expect him to retain most of the present
members because he helped groom them.
   Yu has been criticized for his conservative policies at a time
when the Nationalists are pushing a more flexible foreign policy to
regain international recognization for Taiwan. Younger members of
the party also consider him a liability in a parliamentary election
in December.
   Lee Huan was educated at Columbia University and Tankok
University in South Korea and is considered among the most liberal
senior Nationalist officials.
   He was a close aide to the late President Chiang Ching-kuo,
whose father Chiang Kai-shek led the defeated Nationalists to
Taiwan in 1949 when they lost a civil war to the Communists on the
Chinese mainland.
   Lee has been Nationalist secretary general since 1987 and helped
Chiang Ching-kuo end 38 years of martial law two years ago.
   A major newspaper, the United Daily News, said in an editorial
that Lee's appointment would usher in a new era of political
developments in Taiwan that would ``give higher priority to
political modernization than economic development.''
   Analysts believe this could help Lee, 66, who became president
last year when Chiang Ching-kuo died and has pursued a more
pragmatic foreign policy, including the first visit by Taiwan
officials to China since the Nationalists were overthrown 40 years
ago.
   Hu Fu, a political scientist at the Nationalist Taiwan
University, questionedd whether Lee Huan would push through any
drastic reforms.
   ``Lee Huan is not so rigid as Yu but he is not a reformer,'' Hu
said. ``Liberalization will move forward steadily but gradually.''
   The party statement did not say who would succeed Lee. But
newspapers have said James Soong, 47, the party's deputy secretary
general, is a leading candidate.

<HEAD>Doctors Call Marcos' Survival Surprising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE ELLIOTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos'
condition is not improving and his doctors say it's a miracle he's
still alive.
   ``He's the sickest I've ever seen him,'' Dr. Steven Berman, an
infectious disease specialist, told a news conference Tuesday.
   Doctors said Marcos is dependent on life-support equipment and
the prospects for his survival are slim. Marcos is unable to
breathe on his own and is undergoing constant kidney dialysis, they
said.
   ``He would die if he was off the ventilator. He would die if he
wasn't going to get dialysis. He would probably die if his cardiac
medicines were removed,'' Berman said. ``This is a multi-factoral
problem.''
   The 71-year-old Marcos, who has been hospitalized at St. Francis
Medical Center since Jan. 15, is suffering from massive bacterial
infection, kidney failure, cardiac failure, pulmonary failure and
pneumonia, the doctors said.
   ``It's a miracle he's survived so far,'' said Dr. Calvin Wong,
Marcos' cardiologist.
   Marcos' condition has been unstable and very critical since he
suffered kidney failure and underwent a surgical procedure Thursday
to prepare his veins for extended kidney dialysis.
   Dr. Roland Ng, a kidney specialist, said a kidney transplanted
into Marcos in 1984 stopped functioning because of the infection.
   Marcos has been on a respirator for three months.
   Transplant surgeon Dr. Livingston Wong would not specify how
long Marcos might live, but said it probably would not be long.
   ``I think if you asked any one of us we'd all say he has a low
probability of long-term survival,'' Livingston Wong said.
   Marcos' fever was 101 degrees Tuesday, but had climbed as high
as 104 degrees during the past few days, Berman said.
   Although the prognosis for Marcos remained poor, the doctors
would not rule out the possibility of recovery.
   The former leader's illness has prevented him from traveling to
New York City to face racketeering charges alleging he plundered
his homeland of more than $100 million and used the money to buy
real estate and art in the United States.
   His wife, Imelda, who also is charged, last week appealed to
Philippine President Corazon Aquino to allow her husband to die in
his homeland. The request was denied.
   The Marcoses have lived in Hawaii since February 1986, when they
were ousted in a civilian-military revolt that brought Mrs. Aquino
to power.

   A man was executed by injection early
today for helping to rape and strangle a woman who was abducted as
she awaited help in her disabled car following a New Year's Eve
party in 1981.
   Stephen McCoy gave no final tatement, although he smiled briefly
to four friends he had invited as witnesses. He coughed and his
chest heaved five times as the drugs began to take effect, then
uttered two low and long groans before he stopped breathing at
12:25 a.m.
   The 40-year-old Houston electrician was the 31st Texas convict
and the 110th in the nation executed since the 1976 U.S. Supreme
Court ruling allowing states to resume capital punishment.
   McCoy lost a final appeal late Tuesday when the court voted 5-4
against a stay. The action, which came without comment, was unusual
since the appeal was McCoy's first to reach the high court. It has
been routine for initial appeals to merit at least one reprieve.
   ``The significance of this is the courts very clearly are
indicating impatience with dilatory tactics within the process and
they intend to expedite the process,'' said state Attorney General
Jim Mattox.
   McCoy was convicted in the murder of Cynthia Johnson. The
18-year-old Conroe woman was abducted by McCoy and two other men
from her car, which had broke down on a Houston freeway as she was
returning home from a New Year's Eve party.
   According to trial testimony, McCoy raped the woman and then
held her legs down while James Paster and Gary LeBlanc strangled
her with an electrical cord. Testimony also showed Paster hammered
a nail up the woman's nostril to make certain she was dead.
   Miss Johnson would have turned 27 on Monday.
   Paster, awaiting death for another slaying, received a life
sentence for the Johnson murder. Last month, he was caught with
another death-row inmate in an unsuccessful escape attempt.
LeBlanc, who testified for the state, received a 35-year term.
   ``The death penalty was made for people like Stephen Albert
McCoy to protect society from people like him and from people like
James Paster,'' said George Lambright, who prosecuted the case.
   ``There was no remorse, no drugs, no alcohol, no real
explanation for the violence except they were just mean,'' Mattox
said.
   McCoy had insisted he was in another room when the woman was
slain.
   ``I knew what was going on,'' he said in an interview last week.
``I just couldn't do anything about it. ...
   ``I'm right with the man upstairs. I know this. He knows I'm
innocent. It's not that that bothers me about dying. It's to die
for something I didn't do and to look like a sicko doing it.
   ``Sometimes you make the wrong decisions. That's just the way it
goes. I'm happy with myself, happy with the Lord. I'm at peace with
myself. I know I didn't do it.''

<HEAD>Youths Riot, Attack Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WOLVERHAMPTON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 500 youths hurled gasoline
bombs at police in a racially mixed district of the central England
town of Wolverhampton following a drug raid in a tavern, police
said.
   The rioters Tuesday night also threw up a makeshift barricade
across a street, looted at least one store and set a local council
office on fire, said Deputy Chief Constable Paul Leopold of the
West Midlands police.
   In 1985, predominantly black and racially mixed areas of British
towns and cities including Wolverhampton were swept by a wave of
protests of police harassment. In the worst incident, a policeman
was hacked to death in the Tottenham district of north London.
   Social workers said the underlying cause of those riots included
high unemployment among young people, especially young blacks, and
poor housing in inner-city areas.
   Leopold told a news conference that the trouble began in Tuesday
night when police raiding the pub made 20 arrests, 12 for drug
offenses, and seized marijuana and crack cocaine.
   He said 250 officers _ members of the police drug squad and a
police support unit _ were attacked by the mob.
   The officers dispersed the mob in about two hours, he said.
   ``The conduct of these youths reacting to legitimate police
action in making a serious drugs raid is totally reprehensible and
inexcusable,'' Leopold said.
   In February 1987, 13 people were arrested, shops were looted and
windows smashed in rioting in the area following the death of a
local black man.
   The black man had collapsed after a struggle with two policemen
who were called to a shop when a clerk became suspicious that the
credit card the man was carrying might have been stolen.
   An inquest returned a verdict of accidental death.
   Last year, parcel bombs were mailed to two senior police
officers and to a former police official. Police said the bombs
were believed to be the work of a group calling itself the Black
Liberation Front.

   The state needs tougher laws to keep repeat
offenders in custody, said Gov. Booth Gardner after a man with a
long history of assaults on children was accused of raping and
mutiliating a 7-year-old boy.
   The arrest of Earl Kenneth Shriner, 39, has frustrated police,
prosecutors, mental health professionals and relatives who had
tried to keep him in mental hospitals or jails.
   Shriner was charged with attempted murder, rape and assault
after the boy was found in a wooded area, naked and bloody with his
penis cut off.
   The boy was in satisfactory condition Tuesday at Mary Bridge
Children's Health Center.
   Shriner's 38-year-old brother, John, said: ``He's my brother and
I love him. But God, he's driven the whole family nuts for 20
years.''
   If guilty, ``he should be put somewhere where he's safe and
where people are safe from him,'' said his mother, Delores.
   ``He's crying out for help,'' she said. ``He says he didn't do
this, but he has two personalities _ a loving son and then the man
who may have done this.''
   Gardner on Tuesday called for a change in the law so individuals
with a known risk for committing such crimes ``could be subject to
involuntary treatment and civil commitment under some code or
statute.''
   State Sen. Phil Talmadge said Tuesday he would ask corrections
and mental health officials why Shriner was free.
   ``I want to see their explanation,'' Talmadge said. ``This guy
by all accounts had no business being out on the street.''
   Shriner pleaded innocent Monday in Superior Court, two days
after the attack. Bail was set at $1 million and trial for July 17.
   Reports on Shriner through 1977 show authorities considered him
mentally retarded. In 1987, psychologists and psychiatrists at
Western State Hospital concluded he had a learning disability and
five disorders, including pedophilia and an anti-social personality.
   His troubles with the law began in 1965, when he was declared a
``defective delinquent'' after choking a 7-year-old girl. The term,
now abandoned, referred to juveniles prone to violence because of
mental or emotional problems.
   In November 1966, he was sent a school for the developmentally
disabled after he led authorities to the body of a 15-year-old
classmate. But he was considered too dangerous for the school and
was committed to Western State psychiatric hospital from 1968 to
1973.
   In 1976, he was acquitted in two assault cases, but the next
year he pleaded guilty to assaulting two 16-year-old female
hitchhikers. The judge ordered him committed to the sexual
psychopath program at Eastern State Hospital, but he was rejected
there and spent his entire 10-year sentence at the Washington
Corrections Center.
   Subsequent efforts to return him to Western State were rejected
by a judge, although late in his prison term Shriner was found with
lists of items he would need to maim or kill youngsters, officials
said.
   ``We did everything legally possible to keep him in custody,''
said Kathryn S. Bail, chairwoman of the Indeterminate Sentencing
Review Board.
   In November 1987, Shriner pleaded guilty to assault in the
stabbing of a 16-year-old boy and served 66 days of a 90-day
sentence.
   A subsequent evaluation at Western State found Shriner
dangerous, especially to youngsters, but there was no sexual aspect
to the case, said Frank Mendizabal of the state Department of
Social and Health Services.
   Last October, Shriner was sentenced to 67 days in jail after
pleading guilty to attempted unlawful imprisonment in an attack on
a 10-year-old boy who was tied to a post and beaten.
   ``I don't think there was anything more we could have done to
keep him out of reach any longer than we did,'' Prosecutor Jon
Ladenburg said.

<HEAD>Dollar Climbs Against Yen in Tokyo, Stocks Slightly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar climbed further against the yen today,
while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index erased early losses and
finished slightly higher.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 33,851.82, up 35.21
points, or 0.1 percent, from Tuesday, when it lost 251.25 points.
   The Nikkei lost another 34.12 points this morning, but then
investors reacted positively to the yen's apparent stabilizing
against the dollar, said Yoshio Shimoyama, a dealer with Nikko
Securities.
   But most market players stayed on the sidelines because of
lingering uncertainties over the currency market, a possible
central bank discount rate increase and Japan's political
situation, Shimoyama said.
   Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 650
million shares, down from Tuesday's 700 million.
   The dollar closed at 143 yen, up 1.05 yen from Tuesday's
141.95-yen finish. The dollar, at a 19-month high, now has gained
8.56 yen since May 11.
   It opened today at 143.15 yen and fluctuated between 142.45 yen
and 143.70 yen.
   The dollar's strong opening in Tokyo followed its rise in New
York overnight, triggered by comments by the U.S. Federal Reserve
Board's Robert Heller, traders said.
   Heller told the National Economists Club that ``inflation is not
dead. You don't want to declare victory too early.''
   Masafumi Koyama of the Bank of Tokyo said, ``Japanese investors
concertedly bought the dollar early in the morning. ... But the
dollar slipped (later) as some market players sold it for
profit-taking and position adjustments.''
   The Bank of Japan sold dollars intermittently in efforts to
check the dollar's rise, but it was not central bank intervention
that led the currency lower toward the end of trading, he said. The
central bank does not comment on its activities on exchange markets.
   ``Investors kept buying and selling the dollar as the rate
moved, trying not to keep much money in their hands,'' Koyama added.
   ``Still, the market has a strong demand for the U.S. money,'' he
said.
   Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama told the House of
Representatives today that credit policy should be considered on
the basis of various indicators, but declined to comment on an
expected increase of the official discount rate, Kyodo News Service
reported.

   Students and workers demanding democratic reform
are taking to the streets throughout China, from dusty Lanzhou in
the west to Harbin in the distant northeast.
   While the world focuses its attention on the student uprising in
Beijing, the upheaval is rapidly spreading in areas of the country
beyond the international eye and not normally associated with
political activism.
   Sources contacted at several provincial capitals say workers are
supporting the student demonstrations and sit-ins. They say the
rallies demand Premier Li Peng's resignation for declaring martial
law in Beijing.
   In China's largest city, Shanghai, up to 500,000 people have
paralyzed traffic in marches to the waterfront business district
and the People's Square.
   About 100,000 marched Tuesday night in the southern city of
Canton, a business center normally known for its lack of interest
in political matters.
   In Canton and the inland city of Changsha, people set off
firecrackers and cheered when they learned of a Hong Kong radio
broadcast that claimed Li had been forced out. The report not be
immediately confirmed.
   John Lowry, a teacher from Cincinnati, said 100,000 people were
on the streets in Changsha Tuesday night. He said sit-ins have been
going on continually in front of the railroad station and the party
and government headquarters.
   Residents are bringing the students hot food and medicine, he
said by telephone. ``Support from the workers is really quite
amazing.''
   Among the many people marching in support of the students was a
group of 20 blind people, Lowry said.
   In the Yellow River city of Lanzhou, people placed wreaths on a
central square for a woman student who reportedly died during a
hunger strike. An American source said students were going to
factories to talk to workers about their cause and workers were
leaving their jobs to meet them.
   All major universities in China's northeastern cities of Harbin,
Shenyang, Changchun and Dalian have been shut down by strikes, said
a Western source in the area.
   ``There's an atmosphere of tension which we didn't have a week
ago,'' the source said on condition of anonymity. ``Everyone is
sitting very, very tight'' waiting to hear what will happen in
Beijing.
   Class boycotts also continued in Nanjing, and at least 20,000
people have been on that city's streets every night since martial
law was declared in Beijing on May 20, an American there said.
   She said that since the government began jamming
Chinese-language broadcasts of the Voice of America on Sunday,
students frequently try to glean information from foreigners about
activities in Beijing.
   In Shenyang, handouts of the latest VOA reports are pasted on
walls, and students in Changsha said VOA and the British
Broadcasting Corp. are the only reliable sources of news.
   Sources said students have streamed back and forth to Beijing to
keep their colleagues in the provinces abreast of what students in
the capital are doing.
   In Shenyang, however, authorities have stopped selling train
tickets to Beijing to halt the flow of student supporters.
   Demonstrations have also been reported in Xian, Shenzhen,
Suzhou, Tianjin, Hefei, Guiyang, Urumqi, Hainan, Hangzhou, Hohhot
and dozens of other cities. In Ningbo, students broke into the city
government compound, and in Wuhan students last week stopped all
traffic on a bridge crossing the Yangtze River.
   Official newspapers in Beijing say little about disturbances
outside Beijing, Shanghai and a few other cities, but it appears
certain that few places have escaped the student-led upheaval.

   Three-time Country Music Association
Entertainer of the Year Hank Williams Jr. returned for an ``apology
concert'' and said ``some idiot'' drugged him before his aborted
May 6 concert.
   ``When you're a champion, they like to knock you down,''
Williams told the audience Tuesday night.
   Williams began his previous performance with rambling 20-minute
speech, made a false start on several songs, cursed the crowd and
stormed offstage.
   Williams, 39, who is known for his songs of hard drinking and
rowdy living, agreed to pay concert organizers $65,000. He later
offered to do Tuesday's concert at his expense.
   ``I hate drugs,'' Williams told Teusday night's sellout crowd of
10,000. ``I detest drugs. I'll have me a beer, and I'll have me a
drink, (but) drugs have killed too many people. ...
   ``I'm mad for them (the fans) and I'm mad for me,'' Williams
said.
   He told the crowd that ``some idiot'' had slipped ``a foreign
substance in my drink'' before the May 6 show.
   A report released Monday by Kathy Gangwisch, a spokeswoman for
Williams, said blood and urine tests taken four days after the
concert were positive for Valium, ``a foreign substance available
only by prescription and which Mr. Williams stated he did not take
or possess.''
   The city of Baton Rouge charged $5 a ticket for the concert.
Proceeds will go to a fund for the families of police and
firefighters killed in the line of duty.
   Williams' father, the country singer-songwriter, Hank Williams
Sr., died in 1953 at age 29 from the effects of alcohol abuse.

   The Czechoslovak government has barred Milos Hajek,
a historian and human rights activist, from attending a convention
in Italy on Stalinism, organizers say.
   The government said the visa was denied because his
participation ``would not be in harmony with the interests of the
Czechoslovak state,'' said officials of the Gramsci Institute,
which is named after one of the founders of the Italian Communist
Party.
   Hajek was one of three spokesmen last year for the Charter 77

   The institute said scholars from the Soviet Union and a number
of Eastern European countries are expected to attend the four-day
conference in Urbino that begins Friday.

<HEAD>Joan Jett's Lawsuit Against Playboy Dismissed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge dismissed a $6.5 million libel lawsuit
in which rock star Joan Jett claimed Playboy magazine hurt her
reputation by mistakenly identifying her as a woman posing
seductively in a bathtub.
   State Judge Eugene Nardelli threw out the lawsuit after Jett
twice failed to appear for court-ordered depositions with Playboy
lawyers, the New York Post reported today.
   The photograph appeared in Playboy's May 1982 issue. After Jett
filed the lawsuit, the magazine printed a correction, and the Retna
Photo Agency, which supplied the picture, destroyed it.
   Jett's attorney, Steven Kramer, said the photograph caused Jett
``to be shamed, held up to public disgrace in the community in
which she lives and injured her reputation.''
   But Nancy Wolff, representing Retna, said the lawsuit was
frivolous.
   ``The purpose seems to be to obtain continuing publicity for the
rock star Joan Jett while forcing the defendants to run up
unwarranted legal bills,'' Wolff said.
   The photograph actually was of a member of Jett's former band,
the Runaways. She was in a tub wearing fishnet stockings and a
fringed vest, with strategically positioned bubbles, the Post said.
   Jett, on a nationwide tour, could not be reached for comment,
the Post said.

   People don't usually arrive for a $3.29
fish dinner at the Long John Silver's Seafood Shoppe in a
limousine. But then most customers aren't the president of Iceland
sampling her country's largest export.
   President Vigdis Finnbogadottir proclaimed the meal of cod
fillets ``delicious'' before launching into a defense of the North
Atlantic country's environmental concerns.
   The International Whaling Commission imposed a four-year ban on
whaling in 1986, but Iceland has continued killing whales in what
it deems a research project.
   Finnbogadottir said Tuesday her country plans to complete
scientific research on the whales this year and send it to the
commission for evaluation.
   ``Do you think the Icelanders are so silly that they would be
killing the last whale on Earth?'' she said. ``We are a small
nation but we most certainly are not less intelligent than other
people in the world.
   ``Our interest is to keep the balance in the sea, to keep the
quality around us. We live in an unpolluted area and I hope we can
in the future set an example in this field.''
   Finnbogadottir was a guest of Jerrico Inc., the parent company
of Long John Silver's, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary.
The company is one of the world's largest buyers of North Atlantic
fish.
   ``We are selling you very clean fish that comes from unpolluted
waters in Iceland,'' she told reporters after lunch. ``We cultivate
the sea as you cultivate your meadows. We take a great care on
everything that is in the sea.''

   Two brothers who kept police at bay for seven
hours burned to death in a blaze apparently started by the
firebombs they were tossing at officers, authorities said.
   Autopsies showed John Limoli, 63, and his 62-year-old brother,
David, died of smoke inhalation, said Cuyahoga County Coroner
Elizabeth K. Balraj.
   There was no other evidence of injuries to the men, Ms. Balraj
said.
   The trouble began Monday night when neighbor Wayne Ramsdell
called police to report that John Limoli had threatened him.
   Mike Mills, 24, who lives with Ramsdell, said: ``The guy was
just flipping out. One second he was talking about the Jews getting
killed in World War II; one second he was asking if Wayne was a
Democrat or a Republican; and then he kept going on about the Bible
and God.''
   Several shots were fired from the house at police officers, but
no injuries were reported among police and officers did not return
the fire, a police spokesman said.
   ``Members of our SWAT team tried talking to John, but got no
response,'' police spokesman Lt. Al Jezior said. ``But we saw a
person we perceived to be John throwing makeshift firebombs out of
several windows, and also inside the house.''
   One of the bombs apparently ignited the house, authorities said.
   ``The fire was started by liquid that he had filled up in
bottles,'' said police Sgt. Roger Dennerll. ``He had approximately
six of them that he threw out the windows of the house.''
   According to Dennerll, some of the firebombs apparently bounced
off windows back into the house.
   Special Weapons and Tactics team officers later fired tear gas
into the house but were unable to drive the men out.
   A neighbor, Valerie Rice, said the two men complained frequently
and weren't well liked by neighbors.
   ``The most I knew about them really was they weren't easy to get
along with. They were lousy neighbors,'' Ms. Rice said. ``They
complained about a lot of different things about the neighborhood.''
   Neighbor Carolyn Hendrock said John Limoli had been upset for
three weeks because a neighbor had complained about a garage the
brothers had built. The neighbor had wanted the land surveyed, she
said.

   The brother of reputed mob boss John Gotti was
convicted of managing a multimillion-dollar heroin ring, ending a
six-year legal battle that included two mistrials.
   The jury returned its verdict against Gene Gotti on Tuesday
night, seven days after deliberations began and about three hours
after a federal judge dismissed a holdout juror who said he feared
for his family's safety.
   Gotti and co-defendant John Carneglia showed no emotion as the
jury pronounced them guilty of racketeering, possession with intent
to distribute heroin and conspiracy with intent to distribute
heroin.
   Carneglia also was convicted of an interstate travel violation.
Both men face up to 50 years in prison.
   Jurors were polled and then asked by U.S. District Judge John
Bartels whether anything the dismissed juror told them affected
their verdict, or whether the dismissal itself affected their
decision. All answered no.
   Bartels allowed the two to remain free on $1 million bonds
pending a full bail hearing June 20. No sentencing date was set.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert LaRusso said he was happy with
the verdict.
   ``The evidence was clear,'' he said. ``It was a matter of
putting the pieces together.''
   Ronald Fischetti, Gotti's attorney, said he was confident the
verdict would be reversed on appeal.
   The verdicts came three hours after Bartels dismissed the juror.
The juror, referred to only as juror No. 9, told the judge he was
scared by a visit last week from two men who asked if he was on the
Gotti jury.
   The juror said there were no explicit or implied threats from
the men. Bartels dismissed the juror and told the remaining 11 to
resume deliberations.
   When they came back 15 minutes later with a verdict, the judge
sent them back, saying, ``I don't think that you have had enough
time to deliberate without juror No. 9. I ask you to lay aside what
you might have heard from juror No. 9.''
   The jury earlier had sent a note to the judge saying all but
juror No. 9 had reached informal agreement on a verdict.
   Juror No. 9 was an alternate until just before deliberations
started, replacing one who was dismissed last Wednesday after it
was revealed that he lived in the same neighborhood as an FBI agent
assigned to the case.
   At the first trial, prosecutors alleged jury tampering by some
of the defendants, prompting an unusual proceeding involving nine
federal judges and ultimately a mistrial in January 1988.
   The second trial was declared a mistrial in July after a juror
was dismissed when cocaine was found in clothing brought to him
during deliberations and the 11 remaining jurors announced they
were hopelessly deadlocked.
   The third trial was reassigned to Bartels, who at 91 is one of
the oldest federal judges.
   The defense requested a mistrial this time after it was revealed
that one of the jurors was the cousin of a federal prosecutor who
worked at the courthouse. A second request involved accusations in
the news media that Bartels had fallen asleep during the
prosecutor's opening statements.
   Bartels rejected all mistrial motions.
   The case stems from a 1983 indictment.
   John Gotti is reputedly the boss of the Gambino organization,
the nation's most powerful Mafia family.

   Thunderstorms that splattered the Midwest with hail continued
today and up to a foot of snow was expected in Oregon and
Washington.
   Hail the size of golf balls fell Tuesday across Wisconsin,
Minnesota, Iowa and the Dakotas, and thunderstorms whipped winds up
to 70 mph, downing large tree limbs at Glen Ullin, N.D.
   Thunderstorms extended this morning from northeastern Nebraska
across Iowa to Wisconsin, and in western North Dakota.
   A severe storm watch was in effect for parts of the Dakotas,
southern Iowa and northeastern Missouri.
   Heavy weather also hit the middle Atlantic Coast on Tuesday.
   High winds downed power lines at Kenly, N.C., and golf
ball-sized hail fell at Greenville, with nickel-sized hail at
Gatesville.
   Showers and thunderstorms drenched New England and western
Pennsylvania this morning, with storms developing in the central
Gulf ahead of the same cold front.
   Scattered showers fell in the Northwest, with snow in the higher
elevations of the Cascade mountains. Weather service advisories
said up to a foot of snow was possible.
   Gusty winds swept the deserts of southern California, southeast
Wyoming and eastern Colorado.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 30
degrees at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 88 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from the upper Great Lakes to the central Plains; severe
thunderstorms from Kansas to Michigan; scattered showers from the
northern Pacific to the Rockies; showers and thunderstorms from New
England into the middle Atlantic region; and strong and gusty winds
over the Rockies.
   Highs were expected to be in the 60s and 70s from northern
California through the Rockies and northern Plains to the upper
Great Lakes and on the Atlantic coast; in the 50s across the
Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies; between 100 and 105 from

   More than 100 pieces of woodwork and
furniture made by craftsman George Nakashima were destroyed in a
house fire, authorities said.
   ``Everything's gone, a total loss,'' said Fire Chief Mark Freda.
`The house and everything in it was destroyed.''
   Nakashima, 83, is considered by many to be the elder statesman
of American crafts. Only two pieces of the collection, owned by Dr.
Arthur and Evelyn Krosnick, survived, The New York Times reported
today. A picture frame and a boardroom table were on loan for an
exhibit of Nakashima's work at the American Craft Museum in New
York.
   The blaze began Tuesday morning when an acetylene torch being
used by a plumber caught fire, said Township Police Lt. Mario Musso.
   He said the plumber set the torch on the floor and went to find
something to extinguish the fire. While he was gone, flames
engulfed the basement and spread to the rest of the house.
   Freda said damages to the home and the contents amounted to
about $1 million, but added ``estimates at this point are very
unreliable. No one I've talked to really knows what the contents
were worth.''
   Mrs. Krosnick and her housekeeper escaped without injury,
officials said. The plumber was treated at a hospital for minor
burns to his hands and hair and released.
   ``It is a great loss _ for them and for us,'' Nakashima said
from his studio in New Hope, Pa. ``Some of the pieces can be
replaced, but many cannot. They are precise pieces _ one of a kind,
many of them.''

<HEAD>Robert Kennedy's Assassin Denied Parole 10th Time</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SOLEDAD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's assassin, Sirhan
B. Sirhan, has an unpredictable capacity for violence and remains a
threat to society, a state prison board ruled in denying him parole
for the 10th time.
   Sirhan, 45, who is serving a life sentence for the 1968 shooting
of the Democratic presidential candidate, is not eligible for
parole again until next year.
   Board chairman David Brown on Tuesday called the shooting ``one
of the most shocking criminal assassinations in the history of the
United States.''
   It was ``an attack not merely on an individual's life but on the
political life of the country,'' he said.
   In his arguments to the panel, Sirhan apologized for the
slaying, said he was no longer a threat to society and that he
hasn't given up hope for freedom.
   ``I feel very sad, very sorry, very remorseful ... that a human
life was taken,'' the Jordanian-born Sirhan said. ``After 21 years
... I have become quite convinced that my act was very wrong,
morally and humanly, toward Robert Kennedy, and especially toward
his family and his loved ones and his supporters.''
   ``I realize the mistake of it and I wish from the bottom of my
heart ... that this crime, this horrible event, never occurred,''
he said.
   After the board turned him down, Sirhan accused it of prejudice,
saying the three panelists used ``specious'' arguments.
   The board told Sirhan it wanted him to complete a psychiatric
evaluation program he began in March.
   The board also rejected claims by Sirhan and his attorney, Luke
McKissack, that it was not impartial because its members had been
involved in a previous hearing at which they deliberated only three
minutes. This time the panel deliberated nearly an hour.
   Sirhan argued that he has done everything officials have asked
of him, has been a model prisoner, but is serving more time than
most prisoners with first-degree murder convictions.
   Sirhan's older brother, Adel, watched the hearing along with
reporters via closed circuit television at the State Correctional
Training Facility in this small community 180 miles south of San
Francisco.
   ``We were hoping for more lenient consideration this time,'' he
said glumly. ``Hopefully, next time will be better.''
   Kennedy, a U.S. senator from New York, was shot with a
.22-caliber pistol as he walked through the kitchen of the
Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles after winning the California
presidential primary.
   Sirhan, a Christian Arab, was sentenced to death for Kennedy's
murder but was spared from gas chamber after California's death
penalty law was overturned in 1972.
   His sentence was changed to life in prison with possibility of
parole, and Sirhan faced his first parole hearing in 1975.
   For the past six years, Sirhan has been in a maximum-security
section at the Soledad prison. His release has been blocked
repeatedly by parole panels that have cited reasons ranging from
the effect the crime had on the U.S. political system to Sirhan's
potential for future violence.
   Sirhan last came before the board two years ago. At that time,
the panel recommended that he undergo extensive psychiatric
evaluation, pursue vocational training, attend Alcoholics Anonymous
sessions, remain free of disciplinary problems, earn an associate's
degree and provide documentation of job offers.
   Sirhan told the panel he was not a man of violence. He blamed
the shooting on a volatile mixture of politics, youth, and alcohol.
   ``A lot of people don't realize Robert Kennedy was my hero,''
Sirhan said. He said he turned against Kennedy because of his
support of the sale of 50 fighter jets to Israel, then drank too
much, got a gun and shot him.
   Sirhan said he doesn't hate any politicians now and isn't a
threat to supporters of Israel. He said he understands Jews better
now because, like the victims of Adolf Hitler, ``I've been exposed
to gas chambers.''

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines has graduated its first class of
new pilots since the carrier's crippling strike began March 4.
   Attorneys for Eastern's pilots union, however, told U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in New York City that the pilot training raised
serious safety issues.
   ``Our pilot training is going very smoothly,'' company spokesman
Robin Matell said in Miami. ``This is a very heavily experienced
group.''
   Two new pilots are already flying and about 20 more completed
training this week, Matell said. Eastern said 452 new pilots have
begun training during the past two months, joining nearly 250
Eastern pilots who are crossing picket lines.
   Also Tuesday, Eastern gave American West Airlines until 5 p.m.
today to line up financing for its proposed $415 million purchase
of Eastern's lucrative Boston-New York-Washington shuttle.
   Under a rebuilding plan submitted to federal bankruptcy court,
Eastern says it needs about 1,700 pilots to return to about
two-thirds of its prestrike operations. Eastern has been flying
about 10 percent of its prestrike schedule of nearly 1,100 daily
flights that used 3,600 pilots.
   Eastern, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and
reorganization on March 9, says it can rebuild a smaller,
profitable carrier without its unions and after selling $1.8
billion in assets.
   Eastern unions want the parent Texas Air Corp. to sell the
airline. Attorneys for the pilots union, which has joined the
flight attendants in honoring the striking Machinists union picket
lines, filed a detailed attack Tuesday on Eastern's rebuilding plan.
   The airline can't possibly train enough new pilots to meet its
rebuilding goals, the union said.
   ``The training of these new pilots also raises certain serious
safety issues regarding the lack of experience among the pilot
crew,'' the union said.
   Union spokesman Hank Weber said the Eastern training has been
marred by a high dropout and failure rate, that training has taken
longer than usual, that Eastern is using instructors from sister
airline Continental and that training has been chaotic.
   Matell said the failure and dropout rate has been running at
normal levels.
   The first group of graduates averages 5,782 hours of flying
experience, compared with the prestrike average of 4,000 hours for
recruits, Matell said. The average age of the recruits is 38.3
years, with most coming from corporate duty or commuter airlines.
   During a brief hearing Tuesday in bankruptcy court, Eastern said
it would consider American West Airlines' offer for the shuttle
withdrawn if it could not meet today's deadline. Eastern already
has agreed to a $365 million offer for the shuttle from developer
Donald Trump.
   If America West arranges the financing, Judge Burton R. Lifland
must determine whether it is satisfactory before both offers for
the shuttle are considered further. Lifland must approve any sale
of Eastern assets.

   The new Miss Universe, Angela Visser of
the Netherlands, says she hopes her stay in the limelight will
stretch beyond her one-year reign.
   Miss Visser, 22, a beautician from Rotterdam, today said she
plans to use the title to advance a modeling career.
   ``The most important thing is for people to remember me after
this year is over,'' she told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview after she was chosen Tuesday night from among 76
contestants.
   Miss Universe 1988, Porntip Nakhirunkanok of Bangkok, Thailand,
presented the crown to the winner after swimsuit and evening gown
competitions and personal interviews.
   First runner-up was Miss Sweden, Louise Drerenstam, 19; second
runner-up, Miss U.S.A., Gretchen Polhemus, 24, of Fort Worth,
Texas; third runner-up, Miss Poland, Joanna Gapinsak, 21, and
fourth runner-up, Miss Mexico, Ardiana Abascal, 18.
   The other five finalists were: Miss Chile, Macarena Mina, 20;
Miss Venezuela, Lisa Ljung, 18; Miss Germany, Andrea Stelzer, 24;
Miss Jamaica, Sandra Foster, 19, and Miss Finland, Aasa Maria
Loewdahl, 20.
   Miss Visser, who wore a white gown with silver sequins, was
considered one of the top contenders at the competition, held at
the Fiesta Americana Condesa Hotel. She speaks five languages and
has studied piano and classical ballet.
   She says she enjoys writing poetry, listening to classical music
and playing tennis.
   Miss Visser has blond hair, green eyes and is 5-foot-9. She
aspires to a television or film career.
   She wins $300,000 in prizes and will spend the next year
traveling around the world.
   On Thursday, she is to travel to Mexico City to meet President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari. The next day, she moves into an
apartment in Los Angeles, where she will live during her one-year
reign.
   Miss U.S.A., Gretchen Polhemus, will be her roommate.
   ``Oh, it's great, you'll love it,'' Miss Polhemus reportedly
told her. ``I'll take you shopping.''
   Asked about the reaction of her parents, who attended the event,
Miss Visser said, ``We didn't cry. We just sat and talked about
normal things.''
   Hosts of the event included John Forsythe and Emma Samms of the
``Dynasty'' television program. It was beamed by satellite to more
than 60 countries and an estimated 600 million viewers.
   Rehearsals and taping began two weeks earlier in this Yucatan
resort.

   Comedian Gilda Radner said in an interview weeks
before her death that husband Gene Wilder always believed she would
be well and never displayed fear of the ovarian cancer that killed
her.
   ``I'm lucky I'm with a man who isn't superficial,'' she said in
the interview in June's Glamour magazine.
   ``I think he was really put to the test. But he loves and cares
about what's inside me _ who I am, rather than if I have hair.''
   She said in the March 31 interview she told Wilder, ``You have
handled this about the best that anyone could. After I finish this
every woman in the world will be after you. The trouble is, they're
all gonna have some major illness.''
   She said Wilder never broke down and cried or seemed afraid that
she might not recover.
   ``He's always had this total confidence that I would be well.
I've never seen any fear in his eyes. And I would be the first one
to pick up on it. Now he says back in the early days that he did
feel fear. You know what? He may just be a great actor!''
   Wilder ``always treated me normally. If he was mad at me, he was
mad at me. I don't think I could have stood it if anybody had
treated me as fragile or as though I had a limited time on earth,''
Radner said.
   Radner died Saturday.
   A book about her illness, ``It's Always Something,'' will soon
be published.

   The dollar was stronger against most foreign
currencies except the British pound in active European trading late
this morning. Gold prices fell.
   Dealers said the dollar remains well-supported above the
2-Deutsche mark level, despite concerted central bank intervention
Tuesday and overnight dollar sales by the Bank of Japan.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 1.05 yen to a closing 143 yen, a 19-month
high. Later, in London, it was quoted slightly lower at 142.45 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _2.0113 West German marks, up from 2.0079
   _1.7875 Swiss francs, up from 1.7820
   _6.8150 French francs, up from 6.7865
   _2.2740 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2570
   _1,459.35 Italian lire, up from 1,451.50
   _1.1992 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1975
   In London, the pound rose after the Bank of England signaled a
one percentage point increase in base lending rates to 14 percent.
One pound cost $1.5685 at late morning, slightly more expensive for
buyers than $1.5675 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $362.75 a troy ounce,
down from late Tuesday's $364.35. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $362.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $362.50 compared with $364.25 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose five cents to close at a bid
$364.02.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.17 dollars a

<TEXT>
   A Georgia congressman is to receive an honorary
degree from an Alabama college that he says turned him away 31
years ago because of his race.
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., is a native of Troy, Ala., and in 1958,
he applied to what was then Troy State College. In a statement from
his Washington, D.C., office, Lewis said Tuesday that his
application to the college was denied because he is black.
   Troy State University plans to present Lewis with an honorary
doctorate of law degree at its commencement June 2.
   ``I have received several degrees in the past few years, but
this degree is very special because it comes from the university in
my hometown and the school I always wanted to attend,'' said Lewis,
who also has honorary degrees from Princeton and other colleges.
   Bill Buchannon, public relations director for Troy State, said
in a telephone interview Tuesday night that university officials
did not know about the school's rejection of Lewis when it voted in
March to give him an honorary doctorate of laws.
   ``They're awarding it to him for being a Pike County, Ala.,
native from a basically outlying area of this town, who obviously
has made good in his state and on the national level,'' Buchannon
said. ``For that reason, our board thought he was deserving.''
   The board's resolution commending Lewis lists some of the
congressman's accomplishments, including his role in civil-rights
organizations and his former position on the Atlanta City Council.
It also outlines his education, which includes a bachelor's degree
from Fisk University, where Lewis went after being turned down in
Troy.
   He said it was the school's refusal to accept him that led him
to Montgomery, Ala., and to the civil-rights movement.
   After Troy State rejected him, Lewis wrote Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. in Montgomery, requesting help in getting into Troy State.
King replied with a bus ticket to Montgomery and an invitation to
come to talk about filing a lawsuit against the school.
   Soon after his talk with King, Lewis joined others pushing for
civil rights. Lewis decided not to sue Troy State and later went to
school in Nashville, Tenn., where he led sit-ins and demonstrations
calling for an end to racial discrimination.
   ``This honorary degree represents many of the advancements we
have made in the areas of education and civil rights in the past 30
years,'' Lewis said.
   Buchannon said he realizes the degree illustrates how far the
university and society have come in civil rights, but he emphasized
that the school chose to honor Lewis ``for his exemplar life.''

   Iran's parliament speaker, Hashemi
Rafsanjani, said today that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was well
and cheerful following surgery to stop intestinal bleeding, Tehran
radio reported.
   Rafsanjani said he visited Khomeini, 89, in the hospital today,
one day after the operation.
   ``He was in bed, and the doctors were around him. His health was
very good,'' he told the radio. ``He was very cheerful. I asked him
if he had any pain and he replied that he has very little and that
he is comfortable.''
   The radio was monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in
London.
   Khomeini's son, Ahmad, said Tuesday that his father was in
``very good condition'' after the surgery.
   Iranian television, monitored in Nicosia, later showed film of
Khomeini leaning on a stick, walking slowly into a Tehran hospital
accompanied by his son. It also showed Khomeini after surgery,
wrapped in a colorful shawl and rubbing a string of worry beads in
one hand, propped up on a hospital bed.
   Using Khomeini's title of Imam, or spiritual leader, his son
told Tehran radio: ``Some blood had been detected in the Imam's
digestive tract. The doctors and surgeons consulted among
themselves and concluded that the best course would be to operate.''
   Khomeini's previously unreported illness highlighted the
question of who will govern Iran after he dies.
   The revolutionary patriarch ousted his designated successor,
Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri, on March 28 for criticizing his
policies and appointed a 20-man constitutional committee.
   The committee's deliberations on changing the 1979 constitution
and clarifying the succession has taken place and amid factional
wrangling.
   Indications are that without any single figure with Khomeini's
combined spiritual and political authority, Iran will have a
collective leadership after he dies.

   An 11-year-old girl has become pen pals
with Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and is impressing her
schoolmates with letters and gifts from the embattled leader.
   Sarah York first wrote Noriega in March 1988, after seeing him
on television, saying she wanted to learn more about his country.
   After a correspondence, Noriega paid for Sarah and her mother,
Pauline, to visit in October. The girl said after the five-day trip
that she was writing then-President Reagan to say that Noriega ``is
a very good man.''
   Noriega, Panama's military chief and de-facto ruler, has been
accused of nullifying May 7 elections to prevent the defeat of his
handpicked candidate for the presidency. President Bush has sent
extra troops to Panama and is advocating Noriega's ouster.
   On Monday, Sarah received a package from the general containing
baseball caps and T-shirts bearing slogans in Spanish, copies of
three of his speeches and a desk calendar with a photo of the
twosome from Sarah's visit.
   It also included a handwritten note from Noriega that said:
``You are always in our thoughts. And we want to send greetings to
your parents and everybody at your school.''
   Sarah's classmates were impressed, she said, adding, ``They want
me to bring more stuff to show them.'
   Sarah was wearing one of the T-shirts on Tuesday at Negaunee
Middle School, where she is in the sixth grade.
   It said, in Spanish, ``Panamanian Youth Revolution and
Democracy.''
   Negaunee, with about 5,200 residents, is in Michigan's Upper
Peninsula, near Marquette.

   Premenstrual syndrome may contribute to
violence in women's prisons, and helping inmates cope with
depression, anxiety and other symptoms may prevent trouble, a
psychologist said.
   ``Prisons need to recognize if women suffer from PMS and train
people to teach about it,'' said Kate Harri, a Minneapolis
psychologist who specializes in PMS and has consulted with
prisoners.
   For unknown reasons, women who live together often begin to
menstruate at the same time each month, she told participants
Tuesday at the Third National Workshop on Female Offenders.
   ``Do you remember going to college, living in a dorm, cycling
with your roommate? Think about women in a prison,'' she said.
``Those women in a prison are going to cycle together.
   ``There are times when they have behavior disturbances. If you
have more than one woman who is premenstrual at one time, who has
PMS, then of course you're going to have behavior disturbances.''
   PMS is a hormonal condition in which a variety of symptoms
regularly occur in the same phase of the menstrual cycle, usually
the week before menstruation begins, and disappear, usually within
a few days.
   It can lead to mood swings and, in rare cases, acts of violence,
Harri said.
   Helping inmates deal with the disorder will speed
rehabilitation, she said.
   ``PMS is not a cause of criminal behavior, but it can be a
contributing factor to it'' she said. ``Some women become very
aggressive and out of control.''
   About 32,800 women were housed in state and federal prisons as
of December 1988, said Helen G. Corrothers, commissioner of the
U.S. Sentencing Commission.
   Millicent A. Pulkownik, a corrections officer at the State
Correctional Institute at Waynesburg, Pa., is one of about 500
people attending the four-day conference. She said she has noticed
many of the 200 women at the prison menstruate at about the same
time.
   ``You can just tell when everybody is going into cycle,'' she
said. ``There's a shortness of temper, a lower tolerance for
people.''

<HEAD>Two White Men Hanged, 7 Black Men Given Reprieves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two white men convicted of
murder were hanged today. In a separate case, two black men,
including a member of the outlawed African National Congress,
received reprieves to apply for a new trial.
   Lawyers for Human Rights, which appealed to President P.W. Botha
for stays of execution, said Minister of Justice Kobie Coetsee
issued stays late Tuesday for the blacks. They were convicted of
killing a black policeman in February, 1986 by placing a burning
tire around his neck.
   The lawyers' group asked for a retrial for one of the men, ANC
member Sibusiso Senele Masuku, 22, because, they said, new evidence
had been found that state witnesses may have been forced to give
false evidence against him.
   The other defendant given a reprieve was Oupa Josias Mbonane, 20.
   The two white men who were hanged at Pretoria Central Prison
were convicted in separate cases of murder and robbery of white
victims. One of them had not filed any appeals and had asked for
his execution date to be moved up, lawyers said.
   Four more men were scheduled to hang Thursday, and appeals for
reprieves were pending.
   Meanwhile, the appellate division of the Supreme Court in
Bloemfontein, Orange Free State, set aside the convictions of six
black men sentenced to death in June, 1987, for the 1985 slaying of
an 18-year-old black woman.
   One of the convicted men has since died of natural causes.
   The appellate court ordered the other three released from prison
today, saying the court that tried the four had been improperly
constituted.
   The ruling brought to 13 the number of condemned men whose death
sentences and convictions have been overturned since September.
   In an unrelated matter, police said an African National Congress
guerrilla shot himself to death after wounding a black woman and
shooting a policeman in the chest on Tuesday. Police did not
identify the dead man. They said the shootings occurred near
Nelspruit, in Natal province.
   The ANC is the largest guerrilla group fighting to oust the
white-dominated government.

   Fire broke out in a hotel in central Paris today,
killing two people and injuring 17, four of them seriously, fire
officials said.
   As many as 120 firefighters fought the blaze at the Ecole
Central hotel, the officials said. The two dead were not
immediately identified.
   Investigators said the fire apparently started in the kitchen on
the ground floor of the hotel and quickly spread throughout the
six-story building, in the city's third district, which includes
the old Marais section.
   The blaze was extinguished at 2 a.m., about 90 minutes after
firefighters were called.

<TEXT>
   A Christian Science couple must stand trial on
manslaughter charges for not seeking medical attention for their
dying son, the state Supreme Court ruled.
   David and Ginger Twitchell had argued that state abuse laws
protect spiritual healing, which Christian Scientists favor over
doctors and medicine.
   On Tuesday, Judge Herbert Wilkins ruled that the issue can be
dealt with by an appeals court only after a trial.
   The Twitchells' 2{-year-old son Robyn became feverish and
lethargic in 1986, according to police. They contacted a church
practitioner who came to their home to pray for his recovery. The
boy was pronounced dead at a hospital.
   The Twitchells' attorney has said the official cause of death
was complications from a bowel obstruction that stemmed from a
birth defect.

   The Customs Service delayed about 800
passengers for up to eight hours because it didn't have enough
inspectors in Orlando and had to divert their British Airways jet
to Tampa for processing.
   Customs officials refused to let the plane carrying 427 people
land at Orlando International Airport late Monday, saying the
agency can't afford to pay inspectors to work there after 10 p.m.
   An additional 386 passengers who expected to leave Orlando late
Monday aboard the same plane for Britain were stranded at the
airport until Tuesday morning.
   The decision to send the plane land to Tampa infuriated Orlando
airport officials, who are trying to boost its reputation for
international service.
   ``We had 800 unhappy campers waiting,'' said Bruce Boudreau, the
airport's deputy executive director. ``And we had an unhappy
airport staff.''
   After the jet landed in Tampa, passengers were processed and put
back on the plane for the 80-mile trip to Orlando.

<HEAD>Embattled Convention Head Resigns in Flap Over Remarks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the city's convention bureau has quit
under fire for making derogatory remarks about blacks and Hispanics.
   Don Vaughn on Tuesday resigned his $145,000-a-year job as
president and chief executive officer of the Greater Houston
Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau.
   ``I think it's in the best interest of Houston in order to move
forward both on the local and state level,'' he said, ``and I
believe that any further divisiveness in the community would not be
helpful to Houston and the convention industry.''
   He had been under fire from Mayor Kathy Whitmire and minority
groups, including the NAACP, since he told a state representative
last month that he didn't want black and Hispanic council members
reviewing his annual budget because they would not understand it.
   Vaughn has since apologized to local members of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   His remarks led the NAACP to threaten to take its lucrative
national convention elsewhere in two years unless the bureau makes
changes to help minorities.
   NAACP officials at its Baltimore headquarters and local
officials did not return calls for comment on Vaughn's resignation.
   The NAACP convention in 1991 is expected to attract 10,000
people and generate $6.8 million for the local economy, the bureau
said. Delegates are expected to occupy 3,000 hotel rooms during the
six-day convention.
   Vaughn's remarks about minorities came while he and Rep. Steve
Wolens were discussing a bill by Wolens that would give city and
county governments more scrutiny over convention bureau budgets.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Girl Wanted to Blackmail Rob Lowe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old girl whom Rob Lowe is accused of
filming in a pornographic videotape bragged to friends that she
planned to blackmail the star for $2 million, a newspaper reported
today.
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution cited an affidavit filed last
summer in Superior Court in the divorce of the girl's parents.
   The girl's mother filed a lawsuit May 12 seeking unspecified
damages from Lowe, the Brat Pack star of such movies as ``About
Last Night'' and ``St. Elmo's Fire.''
   District Attorney Lewis Slaton said Lowe, 24, could face
criminal charges for exploitation of a minor. The girl was 16 at
the time of the alleged incident.
   Documents filed in the lawsuit over the videotape have been
sealed, but newspaper lawyers argued Tuesday that they should be
made public.
   News reports have said that the girl, who turned 17 in April,
met Lowe at a nightclub in Atlanta during last summer's Democratic
National Convention.
   According to an affidavit from an acquaintance of the girl, the
teen-ager said she and another woman had sex with Lowe and ``they
all took turns filming each other,'' the newspaper reported.
   Another affidavit, from the girl's next-door neighbor, alleges
the girl planned to use the video to blackmail Lowe for $2 million,
the newspaper said.
   Lowe's public relations firm Tuesday said the actor has no
comment ``until the matter is resolved.''
   Judge Jerry W. Baxter closed the court record on the lawsuit
shortly after it was filed because ``the harm otherwise resulting
to the privacy of the parties in interest clearly outweighs the
public interest.''
   A hearing on the newspapers' request for access to the documents
has not been set.

   A speeding passenger train derailed and
most of its cars plunged into a ravine in northern Thailand,
killing eight people and seriously injuring 59, officials said
today.
   The train was traveling Tuesday night at 47 mph hour as it took
a hillside curve. It should have been going less than 30 mph, said
Phairot Rotjalermngam, public relations chief for State Railways of
Thailand.
   Thirteen of the train's 15 cars derailed, he said. The accident
occurred in Phrae province, about 300 miles north of Bangkok.
Soldiers were helping pull the wreckage out of the ravine today.
   State Railways officials said the Bangkok-bound express was
traveling from the northern city of Chiang Mai, about 80 miles
northwest of Phrae.
   Eight people were killed and 59 were hospitalized, Amporn
Larnlua, the railway's general manager for administration, told a
news conference.
   Another railways official said the driver and conductor were
among those killed.
   People from Australia, the Netherlands, Singapore and Malaysia
were among those reported hurt.
   Stephen Larter, 29, and his girlfriend, Karen Hewitt, 24, both
of Brisbane, Australia, were among those slightly hurt.
   In telephone interviews, Larter and Miss Hewitt said their rail
car was thrown into the ravine when the fast-moving train derailed.
   ``I felt a crunch, and then the carriage rolled and people just
flew,'' said Miss Hewitt. ``I ended up sitting on a fan on the
roof, and there were people underneath me.''
   She said three rail cars piled on top of each other, trapping
many passengers.
   ``It was horrific,'' she said.
   Larter said it was two hours before rescue teams arrived at the
thickly forested area.
   The Chiang Mai-Bangkok train is usually packed with passengers
and is often taken by foreign tourists.
   Chiang Mai is known for its hill people, trekking routes and the
nearby ``Golden Triangle,'' where the borders of Thailand, Burma
and Laos converge. It is one of the world's major opium growing
areas.
   Thailand's last serious train accident was in May 1988, when a
truck rammed into a train in Nakhon Sawan province 130 miles north
of Bangkok, killing 21 people.

at Lefevbre priory; Pickup 8th pvs, ``President Georges...''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Frenchman accused of committing crimes against
humanity as head of a pro-Nazi militia during World War II was
arrested today in southern France, police said.
   Paul Touvier, 74, was captured at a priory near Nice.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse said he was arrested
at St. Francis Priory, which is run by followers of Monsignor
Marcel Lefevbre, a fundamentalist priest. Lefevbre was
excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church last year after a
long battle with the Vatican over church doctrine.
   There had been persistent reports extreme-right Roman Catholics
were protecting Touvier.
   In Nice, police said Touvier was being questioned, but they
refused to provide further information.
   ``We see this with great satisfaction,'' Beate Klarsfeld,
France's best-known Nazi hunter, said of the arrest. ``It's a great
bravo for French justice.''
   In 1945 and 1947, Touvier was sentenced to death in absentia on
convictions of collaborating with the Nazis and executing and
torturing members of the resistance.
   Touvier was the Lyon head of the Milice, which worked closely
with the Gestapo during the Nazi occupation. At the time, the
Gestapo was headed in Lyon by Klaus Barbie, who in 1987 was
sentenced to life in prison for crimes against humanity.
   Touvier was not caught, and the sentences against him could not
be carried out because of a 20-year statute of limitations.
   President Georges Pompidou quietly pardoned Touvier in 1971,
restoring his rights as a citizen.
   Touvier went into hiding two years later when new charges were
raised. Charges of crimes against humanity were filed against him
in 1981, and an international arrest warrant issued.
   The new warrant lists six charges, including the slaying of
Victor Basch, the 81-year-old president of France's League for
Human Rights, who had taken refuge in the Lyon area.
   Investigators determined that when Basch and his wife were
arrested by Touvier's Milice in January 1944, they were ``judged
too old to be deported and they were killed on the spot.''
   Magazines and newspapers have published extensive accounts of
Touvier's protection by the Catholic hierarchy until 1967.
   The address on his official identity card was the archbishop's
headquarters in Lyon, and church officials reportedly lobbied for
the 1971 pardon.
   Since Touvier's return to hiding, there have been reports that
he came under the protection of fundamentalist Catholics with
extreme-right political views.
   Historian Henri Amouroux, a specialist on France's wartime
collaboration, said Touvier's trial would bring out ``the role the
church played in the protection he was accorded.''
   In an odd twist, a death notice for Touvier was published in a
Grenoble newspaper in 1984, giving thanks in the name of his family
for expressions of sympathy. It was never explained, and there were
frequent reports afterward that Touvier was seen in monasteries in
France, Italy or Switzerland.
   Touvier's brother Andre, 61, said in an interview that he was
surprised by news of the arrest, because he had been ``99 percent''
convinced his brother had died.
   ``In a certain sense, his arrest is a good thing. The inquiry
will show, even if he is not lily white, that people have
exaggerated and made a mythic figure out of him,'' Andre Touvier
said.

   Police are investigating a Japanese machinery
company that may have illegally exported to East Germany rare
materials for use in nuclear reactor rods, officials said today.
   The Tokyo-based Prometron Technics allegedly exported an
unspecified amount of hafnium to East Germany in 1986 and 1987
without clearance from the Japanese government, a police official
said on condition of anonymity.
   Executives of the company, which has a branch office in East
Berlin, allegedly carried the metallic chemical element in their
luggage when they traveled to the East bloc country, the official
said.
   Prometron Technics maintains technology swaps with East
Germany's Electrotechnic Export and Import Corporation and several
other East German companys, he said.
   Hafnium is principally used to make control rods for reactors on
nuclear-powered vessels and submarines. It is among a list of items
strictly regulated by the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral
Export Control, a Paris-based watchdog body that controls trade in
strategic items with the communist bloc.
   Police on May 9 searched the offices of Prometron Technics and
the home of the company president, Hirokuni Matsuda, the official
said.
   He said an investigation into whether the firm violated customs
laws and foreign exchange and control laws is still under way.
Violators face up to five years in prison.
   The case is the tenth involving Japanese firms accused of
violating the watchdog agency rules since 1985.
   In 1987, Toshiba Machine Co., a subsidiary of electronics giant
Toshiba Corp., sold sophisticated propeller milling equipment to
the Soviet Union in 1986 in violation of committee rules.
   U.S. officials charged the equipment helped the Soviets
manufacture quieter submarines, and thus undermined Western
security. The incident prompted the U.S. government to prohibit
Toshiba Machine exports to the United States for three years
beginning in 1988.

   The stars of the Bolshoi Ballet say the show must
go on even if they have to pirouette in hand-me-downs after their
luggage got lost.
   Ten crates of costumes and props that were supposed to arrive
ahead of the 30 Bolshoi dancers who are opening in Chicago on
Thursday disappeared in New York during transit, and the company is
having to make do with borrowed goods.
   A high-level diplomatic search continues for the baggage, sent
nine days ahead of time on Aeroflot, the Soviet Union's state-run
airline.
   ``We know the flight took off from Moscow, and we know it landed
in the United States,'' said Susan Arons, a spokeswoman for
Classical Artists International, which is sponsoring ``The Stars of
the Bolshoi Ballet'' tour.
   ``But we have no idea where the crates are,'' she said.
   A second shipment of ballet essentials has been sent from the
Soviet Union and is expected to arrive Friday night or Saturday,
Ms. Arons said.
   In the meantime, the dancers will borrow from the Ballet
Chicago, the Ruth Page Foundation and the Milwaukee Ballet, which
is sending its entire production of ``Giselle'' to Chicago by bus.
   ``It's like if the White Sox went out onto the field in Cubs,
Brewer and Indians uniforms,'' Ms. Arons said Tuesday.
   The borrowed costumes have meant extra rehearsals for fittings
and practicing of precision moves.
   ``The greatest problem is the toe shoes,'' said prima ballerina
Natalya Bessmertnova, speaking through an interpreter. ``We are
used to our shoes, and they are special shoes. Russian toe shoes
are different. Every dancer has a master who makes the shoes by
hand to fit perfectly to the foot.''
   ``Maybe some of us will have to dance in the costumes first and
then we will all have to switch, but we'll make the best of it,''
Ms. Bessmertnova said. ``We have already cried. Now we have to
laugh.''
   The dancers are scheduled to give four performances at Chicago's
Civic Opera House. Besides ``Giselle,'' the program includes
excerpts from other classical pieces such as ``Swan Lake'' and
``Sleeping Beauty.''

<TEXT>
   President Richard von Weizsaecker
today extolled the virtues of his nation on its 40th birthday,
praising the spirit that has made West Germany a world economic
power but warning against ``self-satisfaction.''
   At a celebration to observe West Germany's founding, Weizsaecker
said Germans, through their suffering and successes of the postwar
period, had earned the right to enjoy prosperity.
   He declared his nation's allegience to the West, twice praising
the United States for its help in rebuilding the West German state
from the ashes of the Third Reich.
   His clear embrace of the NATO alliance appeared to be a signal
to the increasingly left-leaning populace that notions of a neutral
German state are ill-advised and could jeopardize peace and
stability built over the past four decades.
   West Germany is embroiled in a dispute with the United States
and Britain over the fate of short-range nuclear missiles, and the
argument has strained relations among the traditionally close
allies.
   ``Under the conditions of the Cold War, it was easy to be
united,'' Weizsaecker told his audience at Bonn's Beethoven Hall.
``It becomes more uncomfortable when the world no longer gives
clear information on who is for us and who is against us.''
   Weizsaecker praised Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev for the
``breathtaking'' process of change he has introduced in his
country, but he tempered the accolades with a warning that no one
is sure of the Kremlin leader's future.
   He paid tribute to West German economic prowess but said West
Germans have much work ahead of them.
   ``The economy is blooming, science has won back its prominence
and education has become an example for the world,'' said the
69-year-old president, re-elected Tuesday to a second five-year
term.
   ``Yet we have no ground for self-satisfaction,'' Weizsaecker
said. ``We have not become angels under the Basic Law.''
   The Basic Law, adopted May 23, 1949, serves as the
constitutional foundation of West Germany and has won praise for
guiding the defeated nation from ruin to international respect.
   West Germany is the world's largest exporter and enjoys one of
the highest standards of living and a strong social security net.
   But Weizsaecker suggested West Germany's way of life is
threatened by resistance to social change.
   In particular, he decried the lot of German women, who bear the
brunt of a system that has been slow to develop day care or
flexible work scheduling, despite the fact that about two-thirds of
the nation's women work outside the home.
   ``As never before must the family make way for the work market,
instead of the other way around. This is regretted by all. And the
women bear the lion's share of the burden,'' the president said.

   Thousands of ethnic Turks demanding more
rights clashed with security forces across northeastern Bulgaria,
and at least two protesters died when troops opened fire, the
official BTA news agency said today.
   A third person died of heart failure during the clashes, and
three people believed to be ethnic Turks were injured, BTA said.
   Turkish newspapers reported today that 25 ethnic Turks were
killed in the clashes, which occurred in northeastern Bulgaria,
where most of the country's 900,000 ethnic Turks live.
   The unrest Saturday and Sunday appeared to be some of the worst
ethnic violence since the early 1980s, when Bulgaria's Communist
authorities restricted the Moslem religion, banned public use of
the Turkish language and tried to force ethnic Turks to adopt
Bulgarian-sounding names.
   In Ankara, Turkey, Foreign Ministry spokesman Inal Batu told
reporters the government had formally asked Bulgaria for
information about the unrest.
   In addition to the village of Todor Ikonomovo, where the
shooting deaths occurred, riots also broke out in some areas of the
regions of Razgrad and Varna, according to BTA.
   Foreign diplomats said they also heard reports of clashes
between ethnic Turks and security forces in Dulovo and Kaolinovo,
in northeastern Bulgaria.
   An emigre source in Vienna, Austria, said fatalities occurred in
those regions when police and troops opened fire on protesters.
   Authorities moved in tanks and helicopters after the clashes in
Razgrad, a diplomat said. Communications to the city were cut.
   ``Extremist-minded individuals, some under the influence of
alcohol, committed a gross violation of peace and tried to draw
groups of the population into acts of lawless violence,'' BTA said.
   It said that ``despite numerous appeals to abide by the law, a
group led by extremist elements attacked and ill-treated civil
servants _ police officers included,'' in Todor Ikonomovo, about
190 miles east of Sofia, the capital.
   ``An attempt to break into the village people's council and
seize the arms kept there resulted in a confrontation,'' according
to the report.
   It said security forces fired warning shots, and the casualties
occurred when bullets bounced off the pavement and hit protesters.
   A man died during riots in the town of Kaolinovo, and a post
mortem found that heart failure was the cause of death, the news
agency reported.
   An emigre source said the clash in Kaolinovo was prompted by a
petition that four ethnic Turks sent to Parliament last month
urging that the minority's ethnic rights be restored. The source
said the four were arrested May 1 and punished with labor on state
farms.
   Bulgarian authorities do not recognize the existence of a
Turkish minority in the country.
   BTA blamed the disturbances on ``inaccurate information provided
by some local authorities'' on recently liberalized travel laws,
which allegedly created ``misunderstandings among certain strata of
the population.''
   The new measures, passed by the federal Parliament this month,
make it easier for the country's 8.9 million citizens to get a
passport and journey abroad. They also apparently make it easier
for Bulgarian citizens to emigrate.
   The official report did not exactly how the alleged
``misunderstandings'' of the travel laws gave rise to the unrest.
   
   Emigre sources in Vienna said a protest hunger strike among the
ethnic Turks, which started May 6, had spread to several parts of
Bulgaria and involved up to 300 people at a time.
   Groups of people were reported taking turns in the fast for a
few days to publicize the plight of the Turkish minority prior to a
human rights conference starting in Paris May 30.
   Turkey ruled Bulgaria for 500 years before 1863 and there is a
long history of conflict. Periodic unrest has been reported since
1984 in ethnic Turkish areas. Reports of growing protest have
circulated among diplomats in Sofia for at least a month.

   With Gov. George Deukmejian's signing
of two bills today, California becomes the first state to ban
military-style assault weapons.
   The legislation the Republican governor planned to sign would
ban the manufacture and sale of more than 50 semiautomatic rifles,
pistols and shotguns on Jan. 1.
   Attempts to restrict such weapons had been blocked repeatedly by
the gun lobby, led by the National Rifle Association, until a
shooting rampage at a Stockton school four months ago left five
children and the gunman dead.
   The slayings by a deranged drifter carrying a semiautomatic
AK-47 rifle rallied the public support needed to push the measure
through.
   Under the legislation, people who owned the listed weapons
before June 1 may keep them by obtaining permits. Otherwise, the
guns can be possessed only with a special-needs permit, such as
those obtained by movie studios for machine guns.
   Possession would be a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in
jail and a $1,000 fine, or a felony, carrying up to three years in
prison. The bills would also increase the penalties for crimes in
which assault weapons are used.
   The bills would allow the attorney general to go into court to
add similar guns to the list.

   The 1865 explosion of the paddlewheeler
Sultana was a disaster to rival the sinking of the Titanic.
   The dead, many of them emaciated from Confederate prison camps,
totaled more than 1,500, but newspapers of the day gave scant
notice. The horror was lost in the greater gore of Civil War and
presidential assassination.
   Until now, there had been no marker here for the Union soldiers
who perished in the muddy Mississippi. But on Sunday, a six-foot
granite marker is being unveiled in Memphis' Elmwood Cemetery as a
reminder that the Sultana went down in flames just seven miles
north of the city's downtown riverfront.
   Built for 300 passengers and a crew of 76, the steamship was
carrying more than 2,300 people plus 100 horses and mules when
three of its four boilers exploded at 2 a.m. on April 27, 1865.
   Jerry Potter, a Memphis lawyer who has researched the disaster
for a dozen years and is writing a book on it, said Union officers
may have overloaded the paddlewheeler to inflate troop transport
payments.
   ``There were two other steamboats that were trying to get a
portion of the men. The only explanation I have been able to
uncover for why the Sultana got them all is bribery,'' Potter said.
   Potter and Hugh Berryman, a forensic pathologist at the
University of Tennessee in Memphis, estimated the death toll at
1,547, 44 more than the number of people lost when the ocean liner
Titanic hit an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic in 1912.
   Other counts of the Sultana victims have put the total between
1,400 and 1,450, but Berryman said those estimates failed to
include one of three trainloads of soldiers who boarded at
Vicksburg, Miss.
   The monument, financed by three Memphis residents, will be the
second of two major markers to the disaster.
   The other, in Knoxville, was put up in 1916 by Sultana survivors
who raised money for the monument.
   Researching the disaster has been difficult because newspapers
of the day were still primarily concerned with the assassination of
Abraham Lincoln two weeks earlier and with the end of the war.
   ``It was just lost to history because of the other events that
were going on at the time,'' Berryman said.
   The Mississippi has shifted its course since the Sultana went
down, and the steamboat's remains rest now under a soybean field
about a mile east of the river in Arkansas, Potter said.
   Excavating the boat could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars,
and would produce little of commercial value since the wreck was
salvaged two months after it burned, he said.
   Berryman, who wrote a paper on the Sultana last year for the
Journal of Forensic Sciences, said survivors told of watching
dozens of victims drown en masse, hands clasped together as they
grappled for survival.
   ``Many of these victims had been through some of the roughest
battles in the war, and those experiences paled in comparison to
what they went through that night,'' he said.
   Most of the victims had recently been freed from prison camps in
Alabama and were headed north to be released from the Army. Many
were crowded onto two decks directly over the paddlewheeler's four
18-foot boilers, one of which had developed a leak that was hastily
repaired.
   When one of the boilers blew, setting off two others, the upper
decks collapsed forming a funnel that dumped dozens of victims into
the fire, Berryman said.
   The 263-foot boat, made of wood and covered with flammable
paint, was equipped with 76 life jackets. Many of the survivors
also escaped by clinging to debris. One survivor floated to shore
on a dead mule.
   The Army investigated the disaster and a captain in charge of
loading the troops at Vicksburg was found guilty of mishandling his
duties. His conviction was overturned on appeal, however, and he
was honorably discharged.

   Libya threatened to walk out of an
Arab League summit today if any moves were made toward concessions
to Israel, but the Lebanese crisis proved the most divisive issue
for Arab leaders.
   Syrian leader Hafez Assad, rather than Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi, threatened to delay the closure of the extraordinary
summit, which was convened Tuesday mainly to welcome Egypt back
into Arab ranks after a 10-year ostracism. Assad today continued to
press his support for Lebanon's Moslem leader, acting Prime
Minister Salim Hoss, while Syria's strongest challenger in the Arab
world _ Iraq and its President Saddam Hussein _ outspokenly backed
Lebanon's Christian Maronite Gen. Michel Aoun.
   While the conflict is undecided, the summit remains closed to
the rival Lebanese delegations for the first time in Arab League
history.
   The leaders met behind closed doors Tuesday and today but failed
to resolve the issue. The summit was scheduled to close later
today, but Moroccan officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the dispute might force a delay until Thursday.
   King Hassan II of Morocco invited some of the quarreling leaders
to a private meeting in his palace late Tuesday. Several had not
met for years, and Hassan persuaded some of them to shake hands,
conference sources said. Those shaking hands included Gadhafi and
Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat, Assad and
Saddam Hussein, and everyone with Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak,
the sources said.
   Mubarak moved quickly to reassert Egypt's traditional domination
of the Arab world when he reoccupied Egypt's seat in the league for
the first time since 1979. That was the year Cairo was suspended
for signing its peace treaty with Israel.
   ``Lebanon has become a grave problem,'' the leader of the Arab
world's most populous state said at the opening session. ``It
exhausts us and is exhausting our consciences. We must work
together to overcome this crisis before the fire overcomes us all.''
   Gadhafi sat silently during Mubarak's 20-minute address, taking
notes.
   Morocco's national news agency MAP and Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported Gadhafi and Mubarak met privately Tuesday night
with Presidents Hafez Assad of Syria and Chadli Bendjedid of
Algeria, in what MAP described as a warm session of reconciliation.
   The Egyptian agency quoted its Information Minister Safwat
Sherif as saying the leaders openly discussed differences of
opinion and a ``spirit of understanding'' prevailed.
   Liby'a news agency JANA has warned Gadhafi would walk out if any
attempt were made to surrender to Israel by compromising on the
Arab demand for Palestinian statehood.
   No such surrender has been discussed.
   In his speech Tuesday, Mubarak asked the league to back the
efforts of its six-nation committee on Lebanon to restore Lebanese
national unity and end the civil war that is in its 15th year.
   In particular, Mubarak said, the committee should seek
withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon _ meaning both
Syrians and Israelis _ and help the country live peacefully under
its ``constitutional authority.''
   Mubarak gave Egypt's full backing to the Palestinian uprising in
the Israeli-occupied territories and backed the right of the
Palestinian people ``to choose whatever road they find suitable for
the achievement of their aspirations.''
   He also spoke of ``the great financial burden'' of the uprising
on the Palestinian people, echoing the PLO complaint that Arab
states have not lived up to their promise of financial aid.
   PLO spokesmen said only Saudi Arabia and Libya have paid
anything.

<HEAD>Walesa Accuses Government Of Violating Historic Accords</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa today
accused communist authorities of breaking a promise made in
historic accords by refusing to legalize the country's independent
student union.
   Angry students, meanwhile, called off a sit-in at Warsaw
University they had called to protest the rejection.
   They said the government refusal was a futile attempt to divide
students from Solidarity just before June 4 parliamentary
elections, and they promised to redouble campaign efforts for the
independent union's Parliament slate.
   Just hours after a Warsaw court refused Tuesday to register the
Independent Students' Association, the government struck a further
blow by banning a scheduled broadcast of Solidarity's election show
from state television.
   Registration of the student union, known as NZS, and opposition
access to television were both agreed to by Communist authorities
in the broad ``round-table'' agreements reached April 5 with the
Solidarity-led opposition.
   ``The rejection of the registration of NZS breaks the
round-table decisions,'' Walesa said in a statement released by the
Solidarity Citizens' Committee.
   The court said it rejected the student group's registration
application because NZS did not renounce the right to stage student
strikes.
   The government press office said it had no immediate response to
Walesa's charge and referred inquiries to state television and to a
court spokesman. Spokesmen at both institutions said no one was
available to comment.
   Walesa's statement included no reference to the cancellation of
the TV show but he promised that his free trade union movement
would pursue the issue of NZS with authorities.
   ``Solidarity will not abandon the matter of NZS registration,''
Walesa said. ``Solidarity will give NZS access to its offices and
to other means until it is registered.''
   Solidarity-endorsed senators and deputies to parliament also
will raise the matter after they are elected, Walesa pledged.
   Announcement of the television ban on the Solidarity program
came just as the show was to go on the air Tuesday night.
   An announcer read an official communique that said authorities
had blocked the show ``because the contents ... aim against the
round-table agreements.''
   The main thrust of the agreements was that Solidarity would be
reinstated after a seven-year ban if the opposition agreed to take
part in Poland's first democratic elections since World War II.
   Tuesday's 45-minute broadcast would have been the third such
Solidarity-produced TV show.
   Today's editions of the opposition daily newspaper Gazeta
Wyborcza said the program was to have included a discussion on the
law led by opposition journalist Wanda Falkowska as well as
interviews with Solidarity candidates for the two-chamber
legislature.
   The government communique said that state TV management, which
is headed by former government spokesman Jerzy Urban, had decided
to refer the program to an arbitration committee that includes
Solidarity activists.
   The committee, co-chaired by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and
Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, was set up to handle
disputes that arise in the implementation of the accords.
   ``The opposition presents many programs on radio and television
containing aggressive and bitter remarks,'' the communique said.
``There are however limits which may not be crossed, as they would
erase the constructive achievements attained at the round-table
...''
   At the round-table, the opposition agreed to take part in
``non-confrontational'' elections to the current unicameral
parliament, or Sejm, and a newly created Senate that is to be the
first freely elected legislative chamber in the East bloc.
   Only 35 percent of the Sejm is open to opposition candidates.
The remaining 65 percent is reserved for the ruling Communists and
their allies.
   The banning of the program was the lead item in today's editions
of Gazeta Wyborcza, while official newspapers did report on it.
   A Solidarity-produced radio broadcast was shortened May 17
because a censor barred a segment of it. And Gazeta Wyborcza, which
has just begun publishing, has come under sharp attack in the
Communist Party daily Trybuna Ludu.

   Reformers said today they are hopeful the new
parliament will be truly independent because the Communist Party
called a Kremlin meeting of its deputies and did not issue orders
on what policies to pursue.
   The Congress of People's Deputies, which opens Thursday, is the
country's first legislature chosen in contested elections in seven
decades.
   The decision of the Communist Party _ the only political power
in the 70 years _ not to dictate policy at a Tuesday gathering
offered hope for democratic decision-making, Moscow deputy Yuri
Andreyev said.
   ``This is very important,'' Andreyev said. ``There are no
decisions required of all the deputies.''
   About 80 percent of the congress' deputies are members of the
Communist Party, but party leaders cannot count on automatic
support among Moscow radicals or from the Baltic republics, which
want freedom from Kremlin control.
   Andreyev said the spirited discussion Tuesday indicated the
congress itself will be ``open and active.''
   ``We were surprised that so many deputies from Russia were so
free in expressing their opinions,'' said Marju Lauristen, a deputy
from the Baltic republic of Estonia.
   Party ideology chief Vadim Medvedev added to hopes, saying on
national television late Tuesday: ``I don't think we should limit
any discussions. We just have to live through them.''
   Today, hundreds of legislators met in strategy sessions to
hastily garner support for proposals to solve the political and
economic problems facing the Soviet Union. For the first time, they
must please the voters who chose 1,750 of the congress' 2,250
deputies. The remainder were appointed by official organizations.
   The formal duties of the congress are to meet annually, choose a
president and 542-member Supreme Soviet legislature, and approve
the president's recommendations for premier, head of the Supreme
Court and national prosecutor.
   But cooperatives want to repeal a decree that kicked them out of
profitable businesses, Armenians want a solution to ethnic problems
and Baltic leaders want economic independence.
   A group of Moscow reformers, including figures as diverse as
human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov and populist party
official Boris N. Yeltsin, will propose congress consider economic
and political reform. And Sakharov has gone as far as saying it
ought to replace the smaller Supreme Soviet as the legislative body.
   A poll reported in today's Moscow News said 89 percent of 1,100
city dwellers nationwide believed the congress should discuss the
economic, social and political situation in the country.
   ``The people expect very much _ unfortunately,'' said Yuri
Shcherbak, a Kiev deputy known for his writings on the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant disaster. ``The people expect us to be able to
solve everything immediately.''
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda today quoted a resident of
south-central Kemerovo as saying he hoped to ``make our life, our
country such that you can once again say without blushing,`I am a
citizen of the Soviet Union.'''
   The party's Central Committee on Monday proposed Gorbachev for
president, and little opposition is expected. However, a battle may
develop because reformers want Gorbachev to make a report on the
state of the Soviet Union before they vote for president.
   The official schedule gives the congress just two morning
sessions before the Supreme Soviet convenes on Saturday. The party
has planned for election of the president and Supreme Soviet as the
first order of business, followed by discussions.
   But the progressives are demanding discussions first, and then
elections. ``We have to pick the Supreme Soviet deputies after we
have seen in the discussions who is who,'' said Andreyev.
   Otherwise, he said, the congress will be no better than the old
rubber-stamp legislature, where officials blathered while deputies
wandered off to the caviar-and-sturgeon buffet and unanimously
approved legislation studied for all of 20 minutes.
   Few negative votes were cast in the previous 1,500-member
Surpeme Soviet that the new body is replacing. Reformers, speaking
to TV interviewers late Tuesday, said the party should not be
afraid of dissent.
   ``If there is democracy, then these factions are inescapable,''
historian Roy Medvedev said.
   Medvedev, a specialist on the repression of the Stalin era,
could not be published for years. But he has gained acceptance in
the freer atmosphere of Gorbachev's reforms and won a parliamentary
seat from Moscow.
   Writer Daniel Granin, another reformer, added the ``customary
unity of opinion is extraordinarily dangerous. We have lost a lot
because of it.''

   The movie theater seat Lee Harvey Oswald was in

Texas School Book Depository.
   The chair, spray-painted black to underscore its place in
history, was removed from the Texas Theater last week and given to
The Sixth Floor, an exhibit on the assassination of President John
F. Kennedy.
   Theater manager Maxine Burroughs said the theater owners are
considering other ways to mark the spot where Oswald sat only
moments after he shot to death police Officer J.D. Tippit six
blocks away.
   Oswald was arrested during a showing of ``War Is Hell'' 80
minutes after shooting Kennedy from the sixth floor of the book
depository on Nov. 22, 1963.
   The seat might be put on display, said Conover Hunt, director of
the assassination exhibit.

<HEAD>Arrested Man Claims to be Missing American in Fraud Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said today they arrested a
man claiming to be an American whose disappearance four years ago
led to allegations he faked his death to collect $2.8 million in
life insurance.
   The man, in custody in Auckland on shoplifting charges, claims
he is Milton Windsor Harris of Baton Rouge, La., police said. The
43-year-old man was charged under the name William Travis. Police
said he also used the alias Rodoleho Jose Mancano of Chile.
   The Auckland Star newspaper today quoted police spokesman Tony
Bouchier as saying the man's claim to be Harris was supported by
fingerprints and photographs sent from the United States.
   Harris, who used to fill vending machines with candy and earned
less than $10,000 a year, supposedly fell overboard while on a
ferry in New Zealand's Cook Strait in 1985.
   Lloyds of London insurers refused to pay $2.8 million in
insurance policies Harris took out in the 18 months before he
vanished.
   A witness said he saw Harris fall from the ferry. But Lloyds
produced witnesses who said they had seen Harris after his alleged
death, and it contended the insurance policies were an elaborate
fraud scheme.
   The mystery man faces three charges of theft and escaping from
custody following his arrest on Monday. He was scheduled to appear
in court June 7.
   Police would not comment on possible extradition. The insurance
case is still pending.

<HEAD>Eds: Subs 5th graf, Many of, to correct that Bush turns 65 next month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a wall of his cluttered office hangs the
faded letter that Claude Denson Pepper wrote, before leaving for
work one July morning in 1978, to his wife of 43 years as she lay
dying of cancer.
   ``Dearest Mildred,'' it said. ``You have not awakened. ... I
pray for the early time when we can go together as we have done for
so long. ... I love you with all my heart.''
   Claude Pepper, 88, never old enough nor lonely enough to quit,
has waited for more than a decade for that time, though it may
finally be at hand. As he lies seriously ill at Walter Reed Army
Hospital, the love letters are flooding in from a nation.
   ``Perk up,'' says one card scrawled by a shaky hand. ``You work
so hard, you're probably just exhausted.''
   Many of the well-wishers are Americans 65 and older. George
Bush, who will join their ranks next month, recently paid a bedside
visit. To senior America, the withered, dog-faced congressman from
Florida is a peerless hero, an ever-alert guardian of the fastest
growing and, in his view, the most commonly mistreated segment of
the population.
   The oldest member of Congress and chairman of the House Rules
Committee, Pepper is known both as Mr. Social Security and Mr.
Medicaid, for his efforts to establish and strengthen both
programs. And thanks to him, federal law now bans employers from
forcing workers to retire before age 70.
   His own advice to the older set was to ``keep on doing what
you're doing,'' but maybe at a slower pace.
   ``I was playing golf one day,'' he said a few years back, ``when
I noticed my partner's clubs were lighter than mine. I found I
could handle them easier. So I changed to less weighty clubs.
   ``So that's what you do in life,'' he said. ``When you come to a
time when there's a need for any sort of change, simply lighten
your clubs and go right ahead.''
   Despite heart surgery in 1976, despite relying on a pacemaker
since 1982, despite dismal hearing and vision _ he wears a hearing
aid in each ear and thick, horn-rimmed trifocals over his blue-gray
eyes _ he hasn't lightened that much of his load. Though
emotionally numbed for more than a year by the death of his wife,
Pepper charged back in the 1980s, keeping long office hours and
gallivanting around the country to push his own social legislation
in the face of Ronald Reagan's budget cuts.
   ``I've got a lot to do,'' he said. ``Except for my terrible
burden of loneliness, I enjoy life. It has always been good to me.''
   His legislative achievements, spanning full careers in both the
Senate and House, are legend, reaching far beyond his concern for
the elderly. He fought for the first minimum wage, 25 cents an
hour, in 1938. His first bill, that same year, extended federal
assistance to handicapped children. He was among the first members
of Congress to support equal rights and equal pay for women.
   Born in 1900 in rural Alabama, Pepper remains a pre-eminent
eyewitness to America's turbulent journey through the 20th century.
He was 5 years old, in 1905, when he first saw an automobile. He
witnessed the celestial passing of Halley's Comet in 1910, and
again in 1986. He met Orville Wright, and greeted the Apollo 11
crew on their return to Earth.
   He stared Adolf Hitler down in a Nuremberg beer hall, sized up
Joseph Stalin at the Kremlin, and earned Winston Churchill's
undying affection for casting the only vote in the Senate for the
Lend-Lease Act the first time around.
   It has long annoyed Pepper that some of the younger generation
presume to think that he champions the elderly because he is old
himself. He was 28 years old and a member of the Florida
legislature when he introduced a bill waiving fishing license fees
for senior citizens. He was in his 30s when he took up Franklin
Delano Roosevelt's crusade for Social Security. ``I was a New
Dealer,'' he has said, ``before there was a New Deal.''
   One of his first bills, in 1937, created the National Cancer
Institute, the first of several government centers to explore cures
for diseases that especially afflict the elderly.
   He was 36 when he was elected to the Senate, where he remained
for 14 years until his defeat in 1950 by fellow Democrat George
Smathers in an extremely bitter election. After an interim and
lucrative 12-year period in private law practice, Pepper has now
spent 26 years in the House.
   A homely man, 5-foot-7, with a bulbous red nose and the mournful
face of a bassett hound, Pepper has lived on his dreams. As a farm
boy in Dudleyville, Ala., he carved ``Claude Pepper, U.S. Senator''
into a tree trunk when he was 10 years old.
   While at the University of Alabama and Harvard Law School in the
1920s, he waited on tables in cafeterias and emptied coal ashes in
a power plant to earn his tuition. But he still managed to graduate
with top honors.
   He taught law at the University of Arkansas before moving to
Perry, Fla., to practice. He first race for the Senate ended in a
narrow defeat, but he was elected without opposition two years
later, in 1936. To this day, his staff and friends call him
``Senator.''
   When World War II broke out, Pepper, convinced that Hitler had
to be stopped, pushed for the draft and massive military assistance
to Britain. Isolationist fever still gripped most of the nation,
and women's groups assailed him as a warmonger and hanged him in
effigy.
   After the war, he got heat from conservatives, including Joseph
Kennedy, father of John F. Kennedy, for having visited Stalin.
Others were angry over his anti-segregation views, including his
efforts to repeal the poll tax in Florida.
   According to Robert Sherrill, author of ``Gothic Politics in the
Deep South,'' the campaign Smathers waged to defeat Pepper in 1950
was ``the most elaborate crusade of political annihilation ever
conducted in Southern politics.''
   Smathers' supporters attacked Pepper on the racial issue and
legend has it that Smathers would tell his less-educated audiences:
``Do you know that Claude Pepper is known all over Washington as a
shameless extrovert? Not only that, but this man is reliably
reported to practice nepotism with his sister-in-law, and he has a
sister who was once a thespian in wicked New York. Worst of all, it
is an established fact that Mr. Pepper, before his marriage,
habitually practiced celibacy.''
   Smathers denies ever making that speech; Pepper says it was
reported at the time. ``In the vilification contest, I was like a
hummingbird fallen into a nest of screech owls,'' said Pepper.
   When Pepper returned to Washington 12 years later as a freshman
congressman, Joe Kennedy's son was president of the United States.
``A lot more charming than the father,'' said Pepper. Now, Joe
Kennedy's grandson, Joseph II, is a House colleague. He called the
hospital the other day to say he was pushing Pepper's home care
bill.
   Claude Pepper remains, it seems, a man for his own generation.
And several others as well.

   A Japanese company says it has come up with a
new home video game that offers more color and sharper graphics
than Nintendo _ at about twice the price.
   NEC Home Electronics, a U.S. subsidiary of Japanese computer and
telecommunications giant NEC, announced Tuesday it would begin
selling the new video game system in the fall.
   The new game ``allows us to provide the user over 10 times more
color and 16 times bigger characters,'' said Keith Schaefer, senior
vice president of NEC Home Electronics.
   ``You will be able to see them cry, you can see the eye
movement, the muscle movement,'' he said. ``In the baseball games,
you will be able to see dirt on the players' uniforms when they
slide.''
   The new game will sell for about $200.
   Nintendo, which offers computerized video games played on
regular TV sets, holds about 75 percent of the $3.5 billion U.S.
market for such games.
   The New York Times today said the key to the NEC system is a
16-bit graphics processor that provides clearer and more detailed
images than those generated by Nintendo's smaller processor. The
system also will have an optional compact disk player attachment
that produces stereo sound.
   Nintendo does not release the size of its processor, but it is
believed to be 8 bits, the Times said.
   Officials at Redmond, Wash.-based Nintendo said they were not
worried. Nintendo games, which emerged after 1985, are believed to
be in 17 percent of U.S. households.
   ``(NEC's) software is offering improved graphics, but it's not
offering another level of play and challenge to the player,'' said
William White, Nintendo director of advertising.
   Nintendo plans to offer a 16-bit machine in Japan this summer
and may introduce it in the United States as early as next year,
White said.

<TEXT>
   A member of the state board that refused
to consider a pardon for an armed robber who built a family and
career during 10 years on the run says the woman can still hope for
parole.
   Kay Smith's attorney had argued that her release would send ``a
message of hope'' to people to trying to rehabilitate themselves.
   But board vice chairman Thomas Neal said Tuesday he felt the
state already provided ``mechanisms of hope, and the hope we
provide in this state is for parole.''
   The Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services rejected
Mrs. Smith's request for a pardon investigation by a 5-2 vote but
moved up her parole date from April 1990 to Dec. 15 because of the
work the 37-year-old woman has done in prison.
   If the investigation had been approved, the board would then
have considered actually granting a pardon.
   Mrs. Smith, who did not attend the hearing, had hoped to become
the first inmate other than a terminally ill one to be pardoned
since at least the 1940s, when the state Constitution was amended.
The governor has no power to grant pardons.
   In 1975, Mrs. Smith, then known as Pamela Rodgers, was convicted
in South Carolina on five counts of armed robbery and sentenced to
12 years in prison. She walked away from a work release program
three years later and hitchhiked to Maryland.
   Over the next 10{ years, she earned her high school diploma,
overcame drug and alcohol abuse, married Ray Smith, raised a foster
child and two sons and became a successful real estate agent.
   But Mrs. Smith's role as what others describe as a model citizen
ended last year when she was arrested as a fugitive. Her previous
husband, convicted of murder in Idaho, had tipped officials to her
whereabouts.
   Mrs. Smith was returned to South Carolina to finish her term and
serve an additional year for escape. Last fall, she was transferred
to the Women's Correctional Institution in Jessup, Md., so she
could be closer to home.
   Her husband, who drove all night from his Severn, Md., home to
attend the hearing, said afterward, ``It's going to be rougher now
than it was.''
   Overcome with emotion, he was unable to speak further.

   The struggle for China heated up today with
official reports of widespread military support for Premier Li
Peng, whose attempt to crush the pro-democracy movement has led to
mass demonstrations demanding his ouster.
   But Li faced new opposition within the policy-making Politburo
Standing Committee and from China's best-known author, who joined
the multitudes opposing the conservative premier.
   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said a Politburo meeting would be
called Thursday or Friday.
   Also today, China informed Western television stations it was
cutting off satellite transmissions as of midnight, ending their
ability to broadcast from China.
   Li declared martial law in Beijing on Saturday, ordering troops
to restore order in the city where more than 1 million people have
rallied in support of a student campaign for a freer China and an
end to official corruption.
   The student protests have galvanized the nation, inspiring the
largest spontaneous movement in Communist China's 40 years.
   Soldiers were deployed on Beijing's outskirts today but did not
move on tens of thousands of student protesters, now on their 12th
day of a sit-in at central Tiananmen Square.
   Over the weekend, throngs of city residents erected street
barricades to prevent an army advance, stalling convoys. Hundreds
of thousands of protesters also took to the streets in dozens of
other cities. All reportedly called for Li's ouster.
   Subway and bus service resumed in Beijing and traffic appeared
near normal today.
   Although the army's inability to enforce martial law has called
into doubt its willingness to follow Li's orders, the official
Xinhua News Agency said six of seven military regions supported the
decision to call troops to Beijing. Only the Beijing military
command was not mentioned.
   Liberation Army Daily, the military newspaper, today published a
letter from army headquarters urging soldiers sent to enforce
martial law to ``fully understand the nature of this struggle.''
   The letter said ``the turmoil created by an extremely small
number of people still has not been quelled. If their scheme
succeeds, then the 10 years of hard struggle for reform and the
work of establishing of modernizing socialism will be destroyed in
a moment.''
   On Monday, however, more than 100 senior army officers signed a
letter seeking an end to martial law, suggesting a deep split in
the military.
   Two government sources said today that Hu Qili, one of five
members in the policy-making Politburo Standing Committee, had
thrown his support to the relatively liberal Communist Party chief
Zhao Ziyang, who is battling Li.
   Hu is in charge of the state-run press. On Tuesday, some
official reports criticized Li's attempts to carry out martial law.
   Reports circulated that Zhao _ who had urged conciliation with
the students _ had offered to resign rather than order troops into
Beijing.
   In the first indication of Zhao's status in days, the foreign
minister told diplomats Tuesday that Zhao had returned to work.
   Early today, Xinhua mentioned Zhao for the first time since
before the martial law order and referred to him as party general
secretary.
   Wan Li, president of the National People's Congress, cut short a
U.S. visit Tuesday after meeting with President Bush. U.S.
officials said Wan, who has praised the students for their
patriotic fervor, was expected to call an emergency meeting of the
legislature and press for Li's ouster.
   In Shanghai, author Ba Jin, the chairman of the Chinese Writers'
Association, was one of 500 intellectuals and high-ranking party
members to sign a letter blasting the speech Li made Friday that
signaled the start of a crackdown.
   The letter also told the party to end press censorship and bring
its struggle into the open.
   ``For 40 years now the party has made a series of major mistakes
because life inside the party is not normal,'' the letter said.
``We must open the party to the supervision of the people.''
   The student movement started April 15 following the death of
ousted Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang, a favorite with
intellectuals.
   Students initially called for a freer society and press and an
end to official corruption, but after martial law was ordered they
demanded that senior leaders resign.
   The struggle centers around Li's conservative faction, which
opposes political reform, and a liberal group which has pushed some
democratic reforms of China's political system.
   ``They might allow him (Li) to go as a sacrifice,'' said one
source. ``He has handled the martial law situation very badly.''
   Deng Xiaoping, the 84-year-old senior leader, apparently backed
Li's effort to suppress the student movement. But now his position
is unknown.
   Another member of the conservative group is Li Ximing, the party
boss for Beijing.

   South Korean authorities today
indicted an American serviceman on charges he fired an air gun that
injured a Korean man, news reports said.
   Prosecutors in southern Chonju charged Sgt. John D. Wilson, 26,
of Henderson, N.C., with violating arms control laws and indulging
in violent acts, according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.
   Wilson, who is stationed in South Korea, was accused of firing
an air gun at Yun Chun-ho, 33, a farmer at Kunsan, a port city
about 130 miles south of Seoul, the agency said.
   Yun was slightly injured in the thigh when he tried to stop
Wilson from aiming the air gun at two passers-by. The Feb. 20
shooting occurred off base.
   If convicted, Wilson faces a maximum jail term of 10 years.
   Wilson was being held at Kunsan Air Base, pending the outcome of
investigations by U.S. and Korean authorities.

   Firefighters from as far away as California today
battled a swift wildfire that has scorched more than 75,000 acres
in the Everglades.
   Smoke from the fire, centered in Everglades National Park about
30 miles from downtown Miami, caused a haze over much of the Miami
area.
   ``I believe the fire is moving at 1 mph, which doesn't sound
very fast, but for a fire it is,'' said duty officer Catherine
Migliano of the state Division of Forestry.
   More than 250 people, including ``hotshot'' teams of seasoned
firefighers from California, have joined the battle, officials said.
   A slight shift in wind lessened the danger to a Miccosukee
Indian village of about 500 people in the park, said park
information officer Pat Tolle.
   ``The distance to the village is still some 10 to 12 miles from
the fire line itself,'' she said.
   Tolle said lightning started the fire May 16.
   ``The area burning right now, in the center of the park, hasn't
burned at all in 30 years, so it has a very heavy fuel load and a
rapid rate of spread,'' she said.

<HEAD>Woerner Says Possible NATO Missile Compromise Emerging</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said today
a possible compromise is emerging in the alliance's dispute over
short-range nuclear missiles in Europe.
   Woerner said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview
that he thought there was a greater than 50 percent chance of a
compromise being worked out before next week's NATO summit.
   The 16-member NATO summit, marking the 40th anniversary of the
founding of the alliance, opens in Brussels on Monday.
   The dispute involves West Germany's call for early negotiations
with the Soviet Union to reduce short-range nuclear missiles, which
have a range of less than 300 miles.
   The United States and Britain oppose such talks on the grounds
they could lead to pressure to eliminate short-range nuclear
missiles. They say the West needs nuclear arms in Europe to offset
a big East bloc advantage in conventional forces.
   President Bush said in an interview Tuesday with London's
Guardian and three other West European newspapers that he felt the
dispute might not be resolved before the summit.
   Woerner, interviewed from Brussels, was asked in the BBC
interview about a proposal, reportedly backed by the United States,
to link talks on short-range missiles to progress in talks on
conventional force reductions.
   Asked if he thought that was likely to emerge as a possible
compromise, Woerner said: ``Yes, that is really one of the crucial
questions _ which link do you establish between the conventional
arms control talks and the start of the negotiations on short-range
nuclear weapons?
   ``You can imagine several solutions. You just spelled out one of
the possible solutions. They are still working on that.''
   The BBC said this possible solution followed recent contacts
between Washington and Bonn. But it said there was already
opposition to it in West Germany, with some people fearing that the
conventional arms talks now being held in Vienna could drag on for
years.
   Woerner said he doubted this and maintained that the two sides
in the dispute were not so far apart.
   He said NATO could not afford a split at a historic moment when
so many changes are taking place in Eastern Europe.

<HEAD>Higher Excise Taxes Would Hit Rural Americans Hardest, Economists
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raising excise taxes to reduce the federal
deficit would impose an unfair burden on rural Americans, who
already pay one-third more of their earnings for such taxes than do
city dwellers, two economists said today.
   Economists James Long and Robert Ekelund of Auburn University in
Alabama said they found that rural households at every income level
up to $40,000 spend a bigger share of their earnings on excise
taxes on motor fuel, tobacco and utilities.
   ``This differential tends to be greatest at low-income levels,''
Long said at a news conference sponsored by the American
Agriculture Movement, which sponsored the study.
   ``If this Congress starts looking at an increase in excise taxes
as a way to balance the budget, we want to say, `No way,''' said
David Senter, national director of the 35-state farm group.
   Several members of Congress have suggested raising federal taxes
on gasoline, alcoholic beverages and cigarattes as ways of cutting
the budget deficit. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee, advocates a sharp increase in the
gasoline tax _ but only if President Bush agrees to go along.
   There are mounting indications that Congress will approve no
general tax increase this year, but lawmakers of both parties
already are talking of the need for higher taxes a year from now.
   Long and Ekelund concluded that the excise burden on rural
families is 49 percent higher on gasoline; 41 percent higher on
tobacco products and 21 percent higher on utilities, fuels and
public services.
   Rural Americans pay 7 percent less of their income on alcoholic
beverages than do others, but ``that difference would likely be
reversed when weighted for beer consumption,'' they wrote.
   Using the government's Consumer Expenditure Survey for 1984 as a
basis, the economists found, for example, that a rural family with
income between $10,000 and $20,000 paid $402 in federal excises,
while the urban family paid $335. At $20,000 to $30,000 income,
rural families outspent urban families $461 to $429. Rural families
between $30,000 and $40,000 were taxed for $523, compared with $486
for urban families.
   The study assumes families living outside an area with 2,500
population or more are rural. That covers about 40 million
Americans.

   Inmates protesting the food and other
conditions at a privately run prison refused to return to their
dormitories overnight and negotiated with authorities in the
courtyard today, officials said.
   ``We're in negotiations with the inmates and everything is
peaceful and calm,'' said Pat Whalen, a spokesman for the U.S.
Bureau of Prisons, which contracts with the Eden Detention Center
to hold federal inmates.
   Twenty law enforcement officers stood by outside as a
precaution. No injuries or vandalism were reported, officials said.
   The prison holds about 300 inmates, most of them illegal aliens
serving up to 18 months for federal crimes, said Greg Bogdan, a
Bureau of Prisons spokesman.
   Whalen was unsure how many inmates joined the ``stand-in,''
which began after dinner Tuesday night.
   Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman Mike Cox said the
disturbance initially involved a large number of prisoners but that
only 75 were outside today.

<HEAD>Congress is Drawn Into Child Custody Battle</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs pvs 4th graf, Wolf made, with 2 grafs updating with court
proceeding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is slowly being drawn into a custody
battle so bitter that a prominent plastic surgeon has been in jail
for almost two years on contempt charges after refusing to turn
over her child for a court-ordered visit with dad.
   ``Every time I read about this case I see everyone wash his
hands of it,'' Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., said Tuesday in urging
passage of legislation that would free Dr. Elizabeth Morgan from
her District of Columbia jail cell.
   ``If we don't act now, who will? This has been stalemated for 21
months,'' Wolf told a House subcommittee with jurisdiction over the
nation's capital.
   Today, in the latest round of legal arguments in the 3-year-old
case, a city appeals court was urged to overturn a lower-court
judge's ruling that has kept the physician incarcerated since
August 1987.
   ``Dr. Morgan is confined unconstitutionally because her
incarceration will not serve a coercive function,'' Morgan's
attorney, Stephen Sachs, told a three-judge District of Columbia
Court of Appeals panel. ``There is no substantive likelihood that
she will relent (and reveal her daughter's location) _ not today,
not tomorrow, not ever.''
   Morgan accuses her former husband, oral surgeon Eric Foretich,
of sexually abusing their 6-year-old daughter Hilary. Morgan was
jailed on contempt charges for refusing to disclose where she hid
the girl rather than allow her near her father.
   Foretich vigorously denies ever molesting his daughter.
   In an attempt to break the legal deadlock, he offered during an
interview outside the committee hearing room Tuesday to submit to
interviews with social workers and psychiatrists who would
determine whether he was fit to be with Hilary.
   Congressional involvement and Foretich's renewed effort at
compromise are only the latest twists in the protracted dispute
over the child.
   Normally, the 11-member House District of Columbia Committee
concerns itself with the city's schools, budget and police
department, much like a city council in many American cities.
   But in this case, Wolf is trying to propel the panel, and the
entire Congress, into what amounts to a private quarrel between
parents.
   Wolf's bill seeks to limit imprisonment for civil contempt
charges to 18 months. After that, the district would be required to
either file criminal contempt charges against a person in Morgan's
position, thus guaranteeing a trial, or dismiss the case.
   The bill would be made retroactive for 18 months so as to apply
to Morgan.
   Similar laws limiting civil contempt jailings are in effect in
Wisconsin and California.
   ``In this case, coercion has clearly proven to be ineffective,''
Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., said at the hearing. ``At what point do we
realize that this lady is really serious about this?'' D.C.
Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon has said he's continuing to
imprison the woman in an effort to coerce her into revealing her
daughter's whereabouts.
   The city council has no authority over the city's court system.
However, council member James Nathanson told the House panel he
opposed setting a time limit for contempt jailings.
   ``If you put a cap on the court's authority, some people will
decide they're willing to pay that price,'' Nathanson said. ``I
think that a court would be rendered less effective.''
   Nathanson suggested instead establishing a three-judge panel to
review all civil contempt cases extending past 12 months. Under
Nathanson's plan the panel, which would include the judge who
initially jailed the person, would have to unanimously favor
continued incarceration to keep the person in prison.
   Foretich blasted Wolf's bill, saying it offered no guarantees
that Hilary would be produced even if Morgan were freed.
   ``Hilary is the one we should be concerned with,'' Foretich
said. ``I have great concerns about her safety.''

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the nation.
   May 19
   Medford (Ore.) Mail Tribune on personal savings:
   Benjamin Franklin tapped the mood of the nation many years ago
when he coined the phrase, ``A penny saved is a penny earned.''
   In those days Americans ... worked hard, saved their money for
``rainy days'' and invested carefully in their futures.
   Today, Franklin might use a more pessimistic phrase to sum up
the nation's mood, something like, ``Never put off until tomorrow
something you can buy today.''
   The personal U.S. savings rate for the past four years has run
under 5 percent annually. By comparison, the annual rate for Japan
is 16.8 percent and West Germany's rate is 12.3 percent. ...
   Americans in the 1980s have indeed been living beyond their
means, both as individuals and as a nation. ...
   (Economists) look for the free-spending Baby Boom generation
born immediately after World War II to become increasingly thrifty
in the years ahead. That's because the early Boomers are entering
their 40s now and starting to think about growing older and about
retirement, which should mean they will soon be saving more of what
they make than is currently the case.

   The Record, Hackensack, N.J., on Bush's anti-crime proposal:
   President Bush said his administration is considering whether to
make permanent the temporary ban he announced on imported assault
weaons.
   More significantly, he rejected advice from his drug czar,
William Bennett, to also ban similar weapons that are domestically
produced ... (and) account for about 75 percent of the
semiautomatic assault rifles available in the United States.
   Many sportsmen are ... perfectly capable of enjoying a day in
the woods without a weapon equipped with a 20-round clip, a flash
suppressor allowing them to shoot unseen at night, a pistol grip
allowing a gunman to spray bullets from the hip, and other features
associated with semiautomatics
   Bush could have barred such features, which are necessary only
for soldiers, without in any way restricting the legitimate
semiautomatic weapons that have been used by generations of
sportsmen.
   Bush could also have proposed a uniform national waiting period
on firearms purchases, to allow the buyer's background to be
checked for criminal violations. That would have been leadership.
   Instead, Bush compromised. He offered a little to those pressing
for stricter controls on assault weapons and a lot to the powerful
lobbyist of the NRA (National Rifle Association).

   The Commerical Dispatch, Columbus, Miss., on Panama:
   Despite its reputation as a toothless talking shop, the
Organization of American States has started a process that, with
luck, should lead to the departure of Panama's drug-trafficking
dictator, Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   At its first emergency session since 1982, the 32-member
hemispheric body condemned Noriega by name for grave abuses and
called for a ``transfer of power'' in keeping with the will of the
Panamanian people.
   With its strong tradition of non-intervention ... that was as
close as the OAS could come to demanding that Noriega step down. ...
   Optimists will note that the last time the OAS voted that a
dictator had to go, in June 1979, Anastasio Somoza was out of
Nicaragua within months. But Noriega may be a harder case.
   By the time the OAS acted, Somoza faced a civil war. He had lost
outside sources of arms, while the rebels were getting weapons from
Venezuela and Panama, among others.
   By contrast, no armed opposition exists in Panama. Noriega is so
brutally ruthless that even peaceful protest can be lethal. A case
in point is his unleashing of thugs wielding iron bars to savagely
beat the winning candidates of the May 7 presidential election.

   Baraboo (Wis.) News-Republic on Panama:
   The time has long since passed for America to apply pressure on
her allies to support U.S. efforts to have the democratic elections
in Panama recognized by the Panamanian military.
   With more than half the world's oil flowing through the Panama
Canal, all countries should be taking an active role in supporting
the true winners of the election.
   Former President Reagan's botched attempts to have Gen. Manuel
Noriega removed from power prove that pressure from the U.S. alone
is not enough to produce the desired results.
   Intervention in the internal politics of another nation is
generally not a policy to be encouraged.
   However, considering the strong-arm tactics of the Noriega
forces, and the importance of the Canal to the Western Hemisphere,
some sort of intervention must be considered.
   If Noriega refuses to recognize the true winners of the May 7
election despite international pressure, then it is time for the
U.S. to seriously consider not honoring the contract it signed
under the Carter Administration to return the Canal to Panamanian
ownership.

   The Flint (Mich.) Journal on the demonstrations for democracy:
   At a time of unprecedented voter apathy in the United States,
the astonishing events unfolding in the streets of China, the
Soviet Union and elsewhere around the globe serve to remind us of
just how precious our democracy is.
   It is ironic, as President Bush said Sunday, that, ``while an
ideological earthquake is shaking asunder the very foundation of
communist societies, the West is being tested by complacency.''
   With depressing regularity in this country, too many public
offices go uncontested, too many citizens are ignorant of issues,
too few voters show up at the polls, too few know their
representatives. In contrast, in the Soviet Union today, tens of
thousands of citizens are demanding a truly democratic legislature.
   And while many in this country ignore news reports because ``the
news is depressing,'' and while some try to discredit the media,
information-hungry citizens in China and other less fortunate
countries are demanding a free press.
   Communist students and workers, young and old, are risking their
lives for the tremendous freedoms so many of us have come to take
for granted.
   They are demanding democracy. They are telling the world it is a
principle, a system, a philosophy worth fighting for, worth dying
for. It is something that Americans and other Western nations have
known and appreciated for 200 years.
   But who would have guessed a decade ago that democracy would
start spreading like wildfire to the communist strongholds of China
and the Soviet Union?
   If the seemingly unstoppable trend continues, as it appears it
will, the implications for a startlingly different _ and better _
world are tremendous. ...
   We would do well to remember that a strong, vibrant democracy _
the kind of democracy that enhances human dignity _ cannot coexist
for very long with apathy, complacency or carelessness.
   As the brave Chinese students are reminding us, democracy
requires courage, a well-informed citizenry and the participation
of a determined, freedom-loving people.

   Eagle Times, Claremont, N.H., on the demonstrations in China:
   America's long relationship with China is one of the most
complicated and convoluted in its history.
   Liberal democracy, that most untidy form of government, proves
to have a strange appeal that crosses cultural and linguistic
barriers.
   Now the world's oldest society, supposedly the most regimented
on earth, stands somewhere between anarchy and revolution.

   Walla Walla (Wash.) Union-Bulletin on prison censorship:
   Prison officials must have the authority to keep order in penal
institutions.
   But the U.S. Supreme Court went too far (last) week when it
overturned a federal appeals court ruling that limited authority of
prison officials to censor reading material of inmates. The court,
by a 6-3 vote, ruled that wardens can ban any publication at
federal prisons they believe is ``detrimental to the security, good
order or discipline of the institution or ... might facilitate
criminal activity.''
   The justices said the officials do not have the burden of
proving any of the publications threaten security, order or
rehabilitation in prison. This, it seems, is the point at which the
court went too far.
   The court's ruling means that a warden could stop the flow of
all reading materials to inmates at a prison without a reason. It
seems that inmates should be encouraged to read _ to better
themselves _ while serving their sentences.
   Giving such ultimate authority to prison officials is inviting
an abuse of power. Prison officials, if they can offer legitimate
reasons for banning material, should have the privilege.
   Is it too much to ask that sound reasons for censorship be
offered? What are prison officials afraid of?

   Topeka (Kan.) Capital-Journal on Bush's anti-crime proposal:
   At some point, well-intentioned efforts to strike at what are
correctly called the ``roots of crime'' with social programs must
be melded with the harsh reality that not all criminals can be
diverted from their livelihoods and should be put in prisons.
   That time is now.
   President Bush has faced up to that reality. ...
   Bush's plan to finance the prison construction _ mostly on land
already owned by the federal government through sale of unneeded
federal property _ is a good one.

   Daily News, Los Angeles, on the catastrophic illness plan for
the elderly:
   Woe to the elected representative who listens to the pros but
not the people. That's what quite a few members of Congress
apparently did last year when they passed a law setting up a new
plan for insuring the elderly against catastrophic illness. ...
   Now ... across the country, thousands of AARP (American
Association of Retired Persons) members are fighting mad at their
national leadership for supporting a requirement in the 1988 law
that all Medicare Part A recipients (those covered for in-patient
hospital care and other services) purchase catastrophic-care
coverage from the government.
   Glossed over during last year's health-insurance debate was that
virtually all federal retirees, and most private-sector retirees,
already have some form of private catastrophic coverage.
   Now, AARP members are particularly upset at being forced to pay
a wealth-based tax surcharge of up to $800 next year for the
long-term coverage, on top of premiums of $382.80 a year. ...
   Many members argue the legislation is also faulty because it
does not provide coverage for critical needs such as nursing home
stays, ... a benefit that many elderly people and their families
need most. ...
   It was a classic case of lawmakers lazily accepting the sales
pitches of six-figure Washington lobbyists and high-profile
spokesmen as gospel. ...
   Perhaps if Congress and others had done a little more of the
old-fashioned kind of research _ listening to their constituents _
it wouldn't be looking to revise or repeal the catastrophic care
law just a few months after it took effect.

   The News and Courier, Charleston, S.C., on OAS and Noriega:
   Rarely has the Organization of American States been able to
muster the votes or summon the courage to condemn a Latin American
dictator.
   Usually, it weasels out of taking a stand by arguing that it
must not interfere in the affairs of member nations. It is almost
unprecedented for a dictator to be condemned by name.
   The value of the OAS resolution is the message that it sends to
Panama. It is a convincing counter to Gen. (Manuel Antonia)
Noriega's claim that all the charges made against him are part of
U.S. plot to oust him and annul the Panama Canal treaties.
   Although Gen. Noriega will insist that the OAS resolution was
dictated by Washington, officers of the Panamanian Defense Forces
who, perhaps alone, hold the key to his ouster, will have their
loyalty (better said, the depth of their complicity in corruption)
put to the test. ...
   The next step is the visit of an OAS delegation, formed by the
foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala and Trinidad and Tobago,
which has been charged with working out an agreement ``through
democratic mechanisms'' to bring about ``a transfer of power in the
shortest possible time.'' The delegation must report back by June
5. Then the OAS must bite the nail.
   If Gen. Noriega thumbs his nose at the 19 Latin American
nations, as he has at the United States, then the OAS must act. We
will see then whether this much despised organization has the
courage as well as the votes to rid Panama of a despicable dictator
and an evil man.

   Watertown (S.D.) Public Opinion on adding Reagan's likeness on
Rushmore: Every now and then somebody comes along with a screwball
idea that is so preposterous, so outrageous, that it takes on a
life of its own. ...
   Such a situation, we suspect, is what is developing around an
idea submitted for your consideration by one R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr.
... Tyrrell's idea is to add a likeness of Ronald Reagan on Mount
Rushmore.
   Tyrrell is editor-in-chief of American Spectator magazine, a
monthly conservative review. ...
   Now there may be some merit to Tyrrell's desire to honor Reagan
in some grand way.
   But we see one tiny, little problem with his proposal. What
happens if liberals come back to power? What happens if the
country, in the grips of a liberal revival, wants to honor some
recently retired chief executive by sandblasting Reagan's face off
the mountain and replacing it with a liberal?
   We have a better idea, why not pick an existing national
treasure that doesn't have a face of its own? ... Why not make a
giant bust of Reagan and hoist it atop the Washington Monument?
   And besides, if the liberals come back to power, it wouldn't
cost much money or take much time to replace the Reagan likeness
with another.

   A federal judge today declared
unconstitutional the District of Columbia's curfew law for
juveniles designed to reduce drug-related violence in the nation's
capital.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Richey said the law ``subjects the
district's juveniles to virtual house arrest each night'' and ``is
a bull in a china shop of constitutional values.''
   He said the law fails to differentiate among those juveniles
likely to embroil themselves in mischief or among those activities
most likely to produce harm.
   ``Just as mere punishment will never cure the drug addict, so
mere martial tactics will never wean the district from its
addiction to violence and illegal trafficking in drugs,'' Richey
declared in a 35-page opinion.
   The curfew statute would make it illegal for people below age 18
to be on streets in the city from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m., with
exceptions for teen-agers returning home from work and those
traveling with parents. There would be exceptions for youths
returning home from school and church-sanctioned functions.
   Richey said the law would ``unconstitutionally burden'' the
First and Fifth Amendment due process rights of ``thousands of
innocent juveniles.''
   ``However laudable the objectives which motivated its adoption,
the act is invalid on its face and may not be enforced,'' he said.

   Indiana University has agreed not to
press for the ouster of the director of the Kinsey Institute on
human sexuality for two years.
   IU said in a statement Tuesday that the school and members of
the institute's board of trustees agreed not to investigate June
Reinisch during the cooling-off period. The university on Dec. 19
asked her to resign.
   The agreement will allow the institute on sexual behavior to
return to normal operations and attempt to resume its research,
said chancellor Kenneth Gros Louis.
   Reinisch was accused of heavy-handed management and failure to
produce the expected volume and quality of research. She has been
director more than six years.
   Reinisch has an unlisted home number and the institute was
closed today. She has denied any evidence existed to support
criticisms of her research or superviion.
   The university houses and partially funds the institute, which
was founded in 1947 by Alfred C. Kinsey. It is incorporated
separately from the university.

   President Bush, in his first direct contact
with a Chinese leader since the advent of student demonstrations,
called on Beijing to stop jamming Voice of America radio and
refrain from violence against protesters.
   Bush, who met Tuesday in the Oval Office with Wan Li, president
of China's National People's Congress, also expressed his
commitment to strong U.S.-China relations, and the two discussed
the recent Soviet-Sino summit, according to a White House statement.
   Wan then cut short his U.S. trip to rush home to a nation that
has been in turmoil since pro-democracy demonstrations spurred
thousands of students to rally in the streets of Beijing. U.S.
officials said they expected him to push for the ouster of Premier
Li Peng.
   The Bush administration expects Wan to call a meeting of the
People's Congress, China's legislature, which has the authority to
impose or revoke martial law, said one U.S. official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The White House statement quoted Bush as telling Wan that the
United States is committed to democratic movements and urging
Beijing not to employ violence.
   Democracy, said Bush, ``is the underpinning of our being as a
nation. I urge non-violence and restraint in your present
situation.''
   In an interview with foreign journalists at the White House on
Tuesday, Bush noted that the students who began the protests now
have support from workers and said ``it's a fascinating thing
that's going on there'' in China.
   ``Peaceful change, democracy, is the wave of the future. The
students have shown a great deal of courage, and restraint on both
sides,'' he said.
   In his meeting with Wan, Bush also complained about Beijing's
recent jamming of frequencies used by the U.S.-sponsored Voice of
America to broadcast Mandarin-language programming into China.
   ``I urge that Voice of America not be jammed, and that reporters
be given open access,'' Bush was quoted as saying.
   Demonstrators listened to VOA to keep informed during the five
weeks of demonstrations. The jamming, which began Monday, was the
first since before Sino-U.S. relations were restored in 1979.
   The Chinese also temporarily blocked U.S. news organizations
from transmitting their broadcasts from China, but lifted that ban
Tuesday.
   Bush told Wan that ``he remains personally committed to
expanding the normal and constructive relations the United States
enjoys with China,'' according to the White House statement.
   ``The world has a stake in China's economic progress, national
security, and political vitality. The United States hopes to see
the continuing implementation of economic and political reforms,
which undoubtedly will also help advance these goals,'' the
statement said.
   The Chinese embassy characterized Tuesday's White House meeting,
which was also attended by Secretary of State James A. Baker III
and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, as ``a broad
exchange of views on international issues and Sino-U.S. bilateral
relations in a sincere and friendly atmosphere.''
   Baker earlier in the day lauded China for ``going in the right
direction'' with its economic liberalization.
   The Chinese Embassy said that Wan's visit, ``for health reasons,
will end earlier than scheduled,'' bypassing planned side trips to
Florida and New York over the next several days.
   Upon returning to China, Wan was expected to urge the congress
to reject use of military force against demonstrators and to
formally oust Li, said the U.S. official. He said use of force
against the students could endanger economic ties between the
United States and China.

<TEXT>
   A candidate in the presidential
election said he told of massive fraud by both pro- and
anti-government parties today during a meeting with a delegation
from the Organization of American States.
   The Panamanian government presented its case against the United
States during a meeting Tuesday with the OAS delegation, sent in
the wake of the nullified election.
   ``The Panamanian government took the opportunity to present a
series of documents and actions that contributed to invalidate the
elections of 1989,'' presidential spokesman Jose Hernandez said.
   An OAS source who refused to be named said the meeting was
``difficult,'' but he did not go into detail.
   Sources said the delegation was attempting to arrange a meeting
with Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Defense Forces chief and de
facto ruler of Panama.
   Members of the OAS delegation said they had come to facilitate a
search for solutions to Panama's political troubles.
   Opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara and his two
vice presidential candidates were scheduled to meet with the OAS
delegation. They contend they won the May 7 vote by about 3-to-1
over Noriega's hand-picked candidate.
   The government, however, nullified the vote, and blamed
opposition fraud and U.S. interference in the election.
   The OAS group met this morning with Hildebrando Nicosia, the
Authentic Panamanian Party's presidential candidate. He received
only a small percentage of the vote.
   Nicosia said he described ``massive fraud committed by both
sides.'' He added, ``People are tired of instransigence on both
sides. The solution is for negotiations without prior conditions.''
   The OAS approved a resolution last week criticizing Noriega and
calling for ``a transfer of power in the shortest possible time.''
It sent a delegation consisting of the foreign ministers of
Ecuador, Guatemala and Trinidad and Tobago as well as OAS
Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares.
   Acting president Manuel Solis Palma's government said it hoped
the mission would ``establish the truth of the crisis as a conflict
between Panama and the United States,'' and it cited U.S. sanctions
as proof of malice.
   The government has proclaimed it will accept no interference in
internal Panamanian affairs and said some aspects of the OAS
resolution violate the OAS charter.
   Panama ``expounded its points of view about the events that
began 24 months ago,'' said Hernandez in a statement after Solis
Palma and members of his cabinet met with the OAS delegation.
   The first street demonstrations against Noriega's rule began in
June of 1987. Since then, Noriega has been indicted on U.S. drug
charges, charges he says are part of a U.S. plot to renege on its
commitment to give up the Panama Canal at the end of 1999.
   Members of the OAS delegation made no comment on the meeting
except for Ecuadorean Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez, who said
only, ``We have formed no impression.''
   At the airport after arriving Tuesday, Cordovez had said the
idea was to assist Panamanians in finding their own solutions and
to convey Latin American concern about the situation.
   Meanwhile, U.S. troops staged an amphibious landing exercise and
U.S. officials said armed convoys of troops were being dispatched
over Panamanian roads with instructions not to stop.
   Several times in the past Panamanian police have stopped U.S.
convoys, which they have no right to do, U.S. officials said.

   The last three months of a drought
killed about $93 million in spring crops, the government said
Wednesday.
   Agriculture Minister Abdul Munem told Parliament that 16 of 64
districts were hit by the drought that also claimed 150 lives.
   Munem said experts had estimated a spring harvest of 5.6 million
tons of rice and wheat, about one-fourth of the country's annual
needs of 18.5 million tons.
   The country produces 17 million tons of grain every year for its
110 million people and imports the rest. Bangladesh, one of the
world's poorest nations, has an annual per capita income of $160.
   Munem did not say how much crop was lost but experts had
predicted that more than half of the grain might be destroyed by
drought.
   Bangladesh alternates between dry and wet spells and last year
more than 1,400 people were killed in floods that inundated
three-fourths of the nation, the size of Wisconsin.
   Another 1,100 died in a cyclone in November. A tornado last
month killed 1,100 people.

   China's student uprising has brought to the
surface a long-concealed but intense rivalry for power between Zhao
Ziyang, general secretary of the Communist Party, and Premier Li
Peng.
   In simple terms, Zhao is the advocate of rapid economic reforms,
a liberal whose sympathies lie with the pro-democracy students. Li
is the economic conservative who prefers the status quo to risky
changes and who ordered martial law rather than give in to student
demands.
   But in Chinese politics, such categorizing can be dangerous and
factional rivalries often cross ideological lines.
   All meetings of the 17-member Politburo, the Communist Party's
top decision-making body, and its core group, the five-man Standing
Committee, are conducted in secret, and it is impossible to
determine how the sides are dividing up in the current showdown.
   Here, however, are a few of the main players:
   Deng Xiaoping _ Deng, 84, has given up his Politburo post and
now heads only the Central Military Commission. But he remains the
most powerful man in China. Deng has won international respect for
achieving spectacular economic progress in China with his
market-oriented reforms, but politically he is an oldtime
revolutionary with little tolerance for dissent.
   Deng is believed to be behind Li's decision to crack down on the
students and appears to have come out strongly against Zhao, his
longtime protege. It wouldn't be the first time Deng turned on the
man in line to succeed him. Two years ago Deng forced the
resignation of party chief Hu Yaobang, another relative liberal,
for failing to subdue student demonstrations. It was Hu's death
that sparked the current unrest.
   Yang Shangkun _ China's head of state, or president, is an
octogenarian military man who has been put in the reformist camp
because of his close association to Deng. However, it was Yang who
announced that troops would be brought into Beijing, and he appears
to be firmly behind Li.
   Wan Li _ The head of the National People's Congress is another
solid proponent of reform. But he has long come out second-best to
fellow reformer Zhao, and won't necessarily throw his full weight
behind Zhao. Wan may be waiting to move into the void if both Zhao
and Li fall.
   Hu Qili _ Hu, a member of the Standing Committee in charge of
party propaganda, also is regarded as having reformist sentiments.
But he has a reputation of drifting with the political wind and
could throw his support to either side.
   Yao Yilin _ A Standing Committee member, vice premier and
economic expert, Yao is in the conservative camp.
   Qiao Shi _ If the Standing Committee splits between the two
progressives Zhao and Hu and the two conservatives Li and Yao, Qiao
could be the swing vote. Qiao, who has a history of work in
security matters, has rarely made his political views known.
   Another uncertainty is how much influence senior leaders outside
the Politburo will have in deciding China's political future.
   Although many aging ideological hardliners have relinquished
their official posts, some continue to have considerable power
because of the personal loyalties they command. Among them are Chen
Yun and Bo Yibo, chairman and vice chairman of the Central Advisory
Commission, a halfway station for elderly leaders on their way to
retirement.
   If they demand a voice in resolving the political fight, Zhao
could be in trouble.

<TEXT>
   Syria sent warplanes over Christian-held
mountains on a reconnaissance mission Wednesday and its gunners
shelled ports north of Beirut to keep Christian military forces
from bringing in supplies.
   The 11-week-old artillery war between Christian army units and
an alliance of Syrians and Druse militiamen has killed at least 359
people, wounded nearly 1,400 and become a leading agenda item at
the Arab League summit in Morocco.
   A police spokesman said two MiG-17 jet fighters flew at medium
altitude over the mountainous southern flank of the 310-square mile
Christian enclave, then headed east toward the Syrian-controlled
Bekaa Valley.
   ``They didn't attack and the army didn't open fire at them,''
said the spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing rules.
   It was the third such flight in a week, he said, with the
apparent purpose of photographing positions of Gen. Michel Aoun's
Christian forces around Souk el-Gharb, a resort town southeast of
Beirut.
   Earlier in the day, Aoun's men exchanged machine gun fire with
the Syrians and Druse in the area. Souk el-Gharb commands a network
of roads leading to the Christian enclave and the general's
headquarters in the presidential palace at Baabda.
   Syrians fired 130mm shells from Moslem west Beirut spradically
throughout the day that landed between the Christian ports of
Jounieh and Byblos without causing casualties, the police spokesman
said.
   He described the military activity as ``part of the daily
routine that has been dominating the confrontation since May 11,''
when the Arab League called a truce in an attempt to end the
battles.
   ``If the summit comes up with resolutions accepted by the
general and the Syrians, then the cease-fire will be consolidated
and we will have a lasting truce,'' the spokesman said. ``If the
summit's resolution on Lebanon is rejected by either side, then
we'll have another round of violence.''
   The truce was declared by an Arab League committee that has been
trying to end the current fighting and find a solution to Lebanon's
14-year-old civil war.
   Lebanon's seat at the summit is vacant because other Arab
nations have not recognized either of the rival governments that
resulted from a political crisis last September _ Aoun's and a
Moslem cabinet led by Premier Salim Hoss.
   Aoun has said his goal is to drive the Syrians from Lebanon, and
he wants the summit to adopt a supporting resolution.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976 and has become the main power
broker during the long civil war.
   The latest fighting began March 8, two days after blockading
illegal ports operated by Moslem militias, which deprive the
government of about $100 million in duties every year.
   Walid Jumblatt's Druse militiamen started shooting in response
and Syrian forces soon joined them.

Palestinians jailed for riot. No Pickup</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HUSAN, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a pre-dawn raid today,
Israeli soldiers pounded on doors in this West Bank village and
took 24 Palestinian suspects away in blindfolds and handcuffs.
   ``We want to show the local citizens that we are in control,''
said 2nd Lt. Uziyah, 22, a red-bereted paratrooper.
   An American aid worker said soldiers kicked and slapped some
detainees.
   In the occupied West Bank, soldiers patrolling Bethlehem on foot
said they were shot at today, but no one was hit. It was the second
gun attack on Israeli forces in Bethlehem in two days.
   Meanwhile, a military court in Nablus jailed five Palestinians
in connection with a riot in which a Jewish guard accidently shot
and killed a 15-year-old Israeli girl.
   It was an emotional issue involving hikers from a Jewish
settlement, which first claimed the girl, Tirza Porat, was stoned
to death by villagers at Beita, on the West Bank.
   Israelis shot and killed two Palestinians during the April 6,
1988, incident, which began with villagers throwing stones at the
hikers.
   The defendants confessed and were convicted.
   Haled Hassin Abed Benishams, 19, was sentenced to four years'
jail for forcing the hikers into a violent situation and attempting
to stab the guard. His three companions were sentenced to terms of
18 months to two years for throwing stones and threatening the
hikers.
   In the Israeli town of Petah Tikvah, municipal officials said
they plan to build shacks for Arab laborers on the outskirts to
discourage them from entering the city.
   ``It's a catastrophe today. They are walking around everywhere.
They use the hallways as toilets,'' said city official Avi Lavi.
   Left-wing city councilor Avraham Oren said he has filed a police
complaint against Lev on grounds of racist incitement. ``The danger
is ... that this will create a wave of hatred,'' he said.
   The Petah Tikvah proposal is the latest in a series of
restrictions against Palestinian laborers in Israeli towns. Also in
past weeks, Israelis have begun stoning Arab workers, killing one
and injuring scores. The violence follows the killing of an Israeli
army sergeant blamed on Palestinians.
   Today's army raids were aimed partly at West Bank villages that
have declared themselves ``liberated'' Palestinian enclaves. More
than 30 have been raided since Sunday and scores of Palestinians
detained in the crackdown to arrest organizers of the uprising.
   ``We shake them up with such raids. ... They say `Hey, the
Israelis are here, and we can't do anything, not even throw a
stone,''' said Uziyah, whose full name could not be used under army
regulations.
   But he said he believes ony a political settlement will end the
17-month revolt against Israeli occupation that has claimed the
lives of 497 Palestinians and 22 Israelis.
   Lt. Col. Yehtiel, commander of operation in Husan, five miles
southwest of Jerusalem, said soldiers do not make indiscriminate
arrests and many of those sought are involved in blocking a nearby
highway or stoning Israeli motorists.
   Accompanied by several reporters, Uziyah's squad pounded on the
door of a single-story stone house. ``Open the door!'' he shouted
in Arabic as soldiers with automatic rifles flanked him.
   The house belonged to a man suspected of belonging to the Moslem
fundamentalist Islamic Jihad. No one was home. But soldiers went
into the house next door, belonging to the suspect's father, farmer
Jaber Taha Hussein.
   Hussein's wife screamed at soldiers who barged into her living
room and demanded identity cards from three of her sons. She
complained they already have arrested one.
   ``This is the third time you have searched this house. You are
besieging us!'' said the middle-aged woman.
   The soldiers left when they failed to find the man on their list.
   Twenty-four Palestinians arrested earlier were lined up in Husan
secondary school, blindfolded with hands bound behind their backs.
   On one wall, a large Israeli star of David emblem had been
painted with a swastika inside.
   Four Arabs were freed after questioning and the rest taken away
in a bus. None showed signs of beatings, and soldiers said they did
not use night sticks because the detainees did not resist arrest.
   In another pre-dawn raid today, however, aid worker Chris George
of Montclair, N.J., said he saw several people ``yelled at or
kicked.''
   George, 35, who works for Save the Children, was detained for
three hours with about 300 Palestinians after soldiers raided his
apartment overlooking Al Amari refugee camp.
   When he protested after a soldier kicked a young Palestinian
three times, ``I was told to shut up,'' he said. He said an elderly
man was slapped in the face and kicked in the back after he
complained of leg cramps.

   A teen-ager who says she had sex with Rep.
Don Lukens testified today she appeared uninvited at his home with
a 19-year-old girlfriend and that the three of them climbed into
bed together.
   Rosie Coffman said she met Lukens in 1985 and did not see the
58-year-old Ohio Republican again until Nov. 6, when she and
Michelle Foster visited him.
   ``My friend Michelle gave me a call. She said she had met a
congressman. She called him by the name of `Buz,''' Ms. Coffman
said, referring to Lukens' nickname.
   Ms. Coffman said the two took a cab to Lukens' Columbus
apartment. Lukens met them at the door in boxer shorts and gave Ms.
Coffman a $20 bill to pay the driver, Ms. Coffman said. Ms. Coffman
was 16 and Ms. Foster 19.
   ``I said `Do you remember me?' He said `Yes.' ... He said `Nice
to see you again,''' Ms. Coffman said.
   Lukens shook his head repeatedly during her testimony.
   Ms. Coffman said Lukens showed the two around his apartment and
took them to a guest room.
   ``He told us to get undressed and put on ... two black robes,''
Ms. Coffman said. She asked him why they could not wear two white
robes she saw in the room. ``He said those were for white people
... other kind of people,'' she said.
   Ms. Coffman and Ms. Foster are black. Lukens is white.
   Ms. Coffman testified that they got into bed with Lukens. ``He
started talking nasty,'' she said.
   The judge recessed the trial until the afternoon to let Ms.
Coffman regain her composure.
   The congressman is on trial on a charge of contributing to the
unruliness or delinquency of a minor for allegedly having sex with
the girl one day before she turned 17.
   If convicted of the misdemeanor, Lukens, who is divorced, could
receive six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Before Ms. Coffman testified, defense attorney Thomas Tyack
attacked the testimony of the girl's mother, Anna Coffman, and
tried to depict the woman as continually unemployed and desperate
for notoriety and money.
   Also today, Domestic Relations Judge Ronald Solove ruled that
Ms. Coffman's juvenile record is not admissable.
   During cross-examination, Tyack suggested that Mrs. Coffman was
lying when she said her daughter did not tell her she was going to
Lukens' apartment. He presented evidence she had told police and TV
station WSYX that her daughter did tell her.
   ``You knew where she was going and you didn't try to stop her,''
Tyack charged.
   ``I did not know the place she was going,'' Mrs. Coffman said.
   Mrs. Coffman also said she was paid $1,500 for an interview with
a local TV show. She previously testified WSYX paid for a two-day
stay at a Columbus hotel.
   Mrs. Coffman contacted Lukens and confronted him during a
meeting at a Columbus fast-food restaurant that was secretly
videotaped by WSYX. The 50-minute tape, in which Lukens was barely
audible, was shown to the jury Tuesday.
   ``I told him how old she was,'' Mrs. Coffman said, adding she
showed Lukens pictures of the girl. ``It didn't bother him a bit
because apparently he's been doing that all along.'' She said
Lukens told her he thought her daughter was 18.
   Mrs. Coffman testified Tuesday that she took her story to WSYX
because Lukens ``should be exposed for what he was.''
   ``A person with his power should not be in office,'' she
testified.
   She said she also called Lukens in 1985 to discuss ``him
contributing to her delinquency by getting her intoxicated'' and
told him the girl was 13.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers on Wednesday worked to clear
the wreckage of a speeding passenger train that derailed, killing
eight people and injuring 59 when six of its cars tumbled into a
ravine, officials said.
   The 15-car train derailed Tuesday night in northern Thailand as
it rounded a bend at 47 mph, but should have been traveling no
faster than 28 mph, said Phairot Rotjalermngam, spokesman for the
State Railways of Thailand.
   The train was heading from Chiang Mai to Bangkok when the
accident occurred in Phrae province, about 300 miles north of
Bangkok.
   Tourists from Australia, the Netherlands, Singapore and Malaysia
were among those reported hurt. The Chiang Mai-Bangkok train is
usually packed and is often taken by foreign tourists.
   Stephen Larter and his girlfriend, Karen Hewitt, both of
Australia, said they were injured when their car fell into the
ravine.
   ``I felt a crunch and then the carriage rolled and people just
flew,'' said Miss Hewitt, 24. ``I ended up sitting on a fan on the
roof and there were people underneath me.''
   Three of the cars were piled on top of each other, trapping
passengers, she said.
   ``It was pitch black and we couldn't see anything,'' said
Larter, 29. ``The thing we were most worried about was being hit by
another train, as we didn't realize we were right at the bottom of
the ravine.''
   It was two hours before rescue teams reached the thickly
forested area, he said. Villagers brought candles, food and
medicine.
   Soldiers of the 3rd Army Region helped move some of the wreckage.

<TEXT>
   Nearly one American household in three has
money left after paying taxes and normal household expenditures,
the Census Bureau reported Wednesday.
   This ``discretionary income'' was reported for 28.9 percent of
all households as of March 1987, the agency said. That's slightly
better than the 28.3 percent of households reporting discretionary
income four years earlier.
   And those households with discretionary income also had more
money left in 1987 than in 1983, with the spending money rising
from $11,032 to $12,332 over that period.
   The report, ``A Marketer's Guide to Discretionary Income,'' was
prepared by the Census Bureau and the Conference Board, a
non-profit business information service in New York.
   The report is compiled primarily for sales and marketing
officials interested in how consumers spend money.
   The increase in the number of households with discretionary
income, and the level of that income, means that the amount
Americans had in hand for spending beyond basic needs rose from
$262 billion in 1983 to $319 billion in 1987, according to the
report.
   This change reflects the improved economic conditions, the
report said, noting that an economic recession was under way in the
early years of the 1980s.
   In addition, the report said the increasing number of working
wives added to the discretionary income available for many
households.
   Education makes a significant difference, the report said, with
59.6 percent of families headed by someone with at least five years
of college having excess income.
   By comparison, 24.5 percent of households headed by a high
school graduate had discretionary income, and the rate was only
11.3 percent for those headed by someone who had not finished high
school.
   By age, households headed by someone 55 to 59 were most likely
to have discretionary funds, at 35 percent. Close were those aged
35 to 39 at 33 percent. The least likely to have extra money were
households headed by someone aged 15 to 24, at 18.7 percent.
   Likelihood of having discretionary income varied slightly by
household size, ranging from 30.9 percent of two-person households
to 26.4 percent of those with six or more people.
   As might be expected, the higher the household income, the more
likely there was to be some leftover money.
   Among households with incomes under $15,000, only 0.7 percent
had any discretionary income. The share with excess money climbed
to 21.5 percent in the $25,000 to $29,999 income bracket.
   Households with incomes of $75,000 and more all reported having
discretionary income.
   The report was based on the Current Population Survey, which
covers about 60,000 households across the country. After-tax income
was calculated and then compared to a series of household budgets
for various family sizes that had been calculated by the Labor
Department. That comparison was used to determine the share of
households with money left after covering their basic needs.

   The owner of a bridal shop padlocked in a
rent dispute is grateful to a judge who cleared the way for anxious
brides and prom-goers to get their gowns.
   ``It's been a nightmare for the girls as well as for me,'' said
Mildred M. Marsh, owner of the House of Bridal Elegance in White
Oak, a Pittsburgh suburb. ``I've had brides crying hysterically,
not knowinig what was going on.''
   Ever since her shop was padlocked Friday, Marsh said she has
received more than 50 calls from tearful brides and high school
girls who want their gowns.
   Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Robert Horgos ordered the
padlock removed Tuesday.
   Brandywine Agency Inc. closed the shop because it said Marsh
owed three months' rent. Marsh said she put the rent money in an
escrow account until landlord Robert Biros finishes renovations he
promised.
   At a hearing May 31, White Oak Magistrate Paul Kahn will decide
whether to continue to enforce the court order allowing Marsh
access to the store.

   Five teen-agers were arrested today on
charges they sexually assaulted a 17-year-old mentally retarded
girl, police said.
   Eight other teen-age males witnessed the hour-long attack March
1, and other arrests are possible, said Essex County Prosecutor
Herbert Tate.
   ``We are satisfied that this was a nonconsensual sexual assault
by these five males against this young woman,'' Tate said at a news
conference. ``She didn't understand the nature and quality of her
actions.''
   Tate said the high school students met the girl in a park in
Glen Ridge, an affluent New York City suburb, then went with her to
the home of two of the students, 18-year-old twins Kevin and Kyle
Scherzer, whose parents were not home.
   Tate said the girl was assaulted in the basement with a small
baseball bat and a broomstick. There was no sexual intercourse, he
said.
   He said the students and the girl knew each other, and the
youths knew she was retarded.
   All five awaited a court hearing today.
   The Scherzer brothers and Peter Quigley, 18, were arrested on
conspirary and sexual assault charges, and a 17-year-old and
another student who has since turned 18 were charged with juvenile
delinquency, Tate said.

<DATELINE>NETTUNO, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush and Clinton H. Jay were
comrades at arms once, half a globe apart at a time when the world
was at war.
   In the spring of 1944, Bush was not quite 20, a Navy officer and
an aviator in the Pacific. Jay was 31, an Army private from
Youngstown, Ohio, and an infantryman in the 3rd Division's bloody
drive on Rome.
   On Sunday, Bush will visit the U.S. military cemetery at
Nettuno, row after row of white marble headstones set in gentle
arcs on a manicured lawn. Jay is one of 7,862 soldiers buried
there, near the spot where he fell on May 28, 1944.
   ``They represent about 35 percent of those killed in Sicily and
the advance on Rome,'' said Joseph Bevilacqua, a retired soldier
and Vietnam veteran who became the cemetery's superintendent two
months ago.
   The bodies ofmost of those killed in the invasion at Anzio and
Nettuno were returned to the United States at the request of next
of kin. The names of 3,094 others still missing or buried at sea
are carved in the white Carrara marble walls of a memorial at the
end of a long grassy mall.
   Bush will lay a wreath, but officials say his brief Memorial Day
weekend remarks will focus on NATO, not the war.
   Still, Bevilacqua says the visit is an honor, a way to
acknowledge so many like Jay whose sacrifice is remembered usually
only by friends or family.
   Some families paid a higher price. There are 21 pairs of
brothers buried at Nettuno, most of them side by side. Two, Cpl.
Preston Kaspervick and 2nd Lt. William Kaspervick of Quincy, Ill.,
died 10 days apart in January 1944.
   Bush is coming to Italy on his way to the NATO summit in
Brussels, which marks the alliance's 40th anniversary. During his
European swing, he also will meet with Pope John Paul II and
political leaders in Belgium, Britain, West Germany and Italy.
   His most public appearance in Italy will be the stop at the
77-acre military cemetery near where Allied troops waded ashore at
2 a.m. on Jan. 22, 1944.
   Allied commanders hoped the bold stroke would relieve the fierce
stalemate at Cassino to the south and hasten the fall of Rome, 45
miles to the north.
   The battle-hardened British 1st and American 3rd, the first
divisions ashore, expected heavy resistance but were almost
unopposed. The astonished Allies had caught the Germans by surprise.
   ``It was so easy ... American troops are standing with their
mouths open and shaking their heads in utter amazement,''
Associated Press correspondent Don Whitehead wrote at the time.
   But while the Allies secured the beachhead, crack German
divisions fortified the heights beyond the shore. The bold stroke
was lost in a nightmare of rain, wind, mud, blood and high
explosive. There were 3,000 American casualties in January.
   A German counterattack pushed the Allies toward the sea. Then it
became a static war, three months of withering artillery barrages.
In the soldier's black humor it was simply called the ``Sitzkrieg.''
   The breakout finally came in May. On June 4, after 123 days of
fighting, the Allies entered Rome.
   The cemetery lies along the 3rd Division's path up from the
beach. Bevilacqua said it opened as a temporary cemetery two days
after the landings.
   ``There were Germans and Britons as well as Americans buried
here at first,'' he said. ``It was in the middle of the fighting.''
   Today the only reminder of the fighting is rows of Latin crosses
and Stars of David. Pink, long-stem chrysantemums lie near some
headstones.
   ``They are left by Italians,'' said Bevilacqua. ``Sometimes they
just like the name or maybe remember a name. Many of them were
befriended by Americans who landed here.''
   Many buried in Nettuno died heroically. Two men _ Sgt. Sylvester
Antolak of St. Clairsville, Ohio, and 1st Lt. Robert T. Waugh of
Ashton, R.I. _ received the Congressional Medal of Honor, the
nation's highest award for gallantry.
   Others died anonymously. There are 490 unknowns buried in 488
graves scattered throughout the cemetery. One is next to Jay.

   Forcing a son to call his mother and visit her is
no business of the courts, a judge ruled.
   The ruling Tuesday grew out of a dispute between Richard
Rosenbaum and his mother, Jean, a retired teacher. The son, who is
in his early 40s, filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction to stop her
from calling him and his wife.
   Judge Thomas J. O'Brien issued the injunction in 1985 but
ordered the son to telephone his mother at least once every three
months and meet with her once a year.
   The judge later dropped those requirements, but did order the
son to keep his mother informed of where he lives. Mrs. Rosenbaum
appealed the ruling.
   State Appeals Court Justice Anthony Scariano sided with the son.
   ``This is a sad and unfortunate situation,'' he said. ``However,
it takes more than a mere secular tribunal to command filial
devotion.''

   The tractor-trailer belches black smoke
as it rumbles up a mountainous pass, leaving behind a gritty
landscape obscured by gray haze: the Los Angeles basin at high noon.
   ``There's a good one,'' says California Highway Patrol Officer
Greg Dettinger and the smog patrol is off and chasing yet another
18-wheeled contributor to Southern California's choking smog.
   In Southern California, the CHP ``Smokeys'' are living up to
their nickname by pulling over the puffing tailpipes as well as the
speeders.
   ``We pull people over on the freeway and other people will go by
and blow their horns and give the thumbs up,'' said Sgt. George
Johnson, who is in charge of the patrols.
   As Dettinger was writing a citation, trucker Thomas Schwartz
conceded, ``Something has to be done, there's no doubt about it.''
   Southern California's skies are the most polluted in the nation
_ a result of surrounding mountains that trap the filth along with
stagnant weather and industries that operate in the area.
   The agency responsible for reducing the pollution, the South
Coast Air Quality Management District, took part of its cleanup
effort last yearto the streets by dispatching highway patrol
officers to stop polluting vehicles and issue orders to clean up or
pay up.
   Drivers can join the crackdown by calling a hotline to report
the license numbers of smoking vehicles. The culprits are sent
stern letters and must provide proof the problem is fixed.
   The air quality district has found people are eager to help
clean up the air by reporting others. More than 7,200 people phoned
the smog hotline to report smoking cars in March, said spokesman
Bill Kelly.
   The district's territory extends over 13,600 square miles from
the Pacific Ocean to Palm Springs, 110 miles east of Los Angeles,
then north to the Ventura County line and south to where Orange
County meets San Diego County.
   An estimated 11 million people live in the district, which
encompasses Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties and
non-desert areas of the vast San Bernardino County. In Los Angeles
County alone, there are 5.4 million licensed drivers.
   All that exhaust contributed to ozone levels that exceeded
federal health standards 176 days in 1988.
   Southern California's air is so fouled that in March, the agency
proposed a drastic change in driving habits. Under the plan, 40
percent of non-commerical and 70 percent of vehicles would be
required by 1998 to run on methanol, fuel cells or electricity
rather than on gasoline.
   Unlike the high-level ozone layer, which filters the sun's
harmful ultraviolet radiation, low-level ozone is dangerous.
   The pale-blue gas formed by a chemical reaction involving
nitrogen dioxide and hydrocarbons is one of the principal
components of smog.
   Vehicle exhaust is believed to cause up to 8 percent of lung
cancer in non-smoking urban residents. Research has shown ozone
aggravates respiratory ailments in children, the elderly and people
suffering from heart and lung diseases. It eats away at tires and
nylon, damages crops and has damaged the lungs of animals used in
experiments.
   Since July, when the program became full time, eight officers
driving cars marked with the winged-dove logo of the air quality
district have written more than 8,000 citations to smoking
vehicles, mostly diesel trucks.
   Jim Crape, a state engineer who works in Chino, carries a tape
recorder to take down license numbers of polluting vehicles.
   ``I turned in about 120 already,'' he said. ``We can't let it
keep going, because what is it going to be like when the population
doubles, triples? What? Are we going to wear gas masks?''

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has
agreed to impose ceilings on Soviet forces stationed in East
European countries, U.S. officials said today.
   In a parallel move, the officials said, Gorbachev suggested that
no country _ including the Soviet Union and the United States _ be
allowed to have more than 35 percent to 40 percent of the combined
manpower totals of NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   This would have the effect of diluting the forces of the Soviet
Union in Eastern Europe and overall, as well.
   The proposals were the latest in a series of arms control
initiatives by Gorbachev, and President Bush welcomed them today.
   ``The Soviets are now being forthcoming and we hope to achieve
the reductions that we seek,'' Bush said in a commencement speech
at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn.
   But he added: ``These reductions alone, even if implemented, are
not enough to eliminate the superiority the Soviet Union enjoys
now'' in Europe.
   The twin moves by Gorbachev were in response to longstanding
U.S. demands for reducing a large Warsaw Pact edge over the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization in non-nuclear strength. For instance,
Soviet tanks now account for nearly 70 percent of all NATO and
Warsaw Pact armor.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater sought to play down the
importance of the latest Soviet proposal, saying it was a response
to a plan proposed last March 9 by the United States and its NATO
allies.
   But Fitzwater said, ``The Soviets have provided details in a
meaningful way at the negotiating table. It is a serious proposal
and we look forward to the negotiations.''
   And Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said
``we view this as a serious and substantial proposal that is being
received as such.''
   Gorbachev's overture came less than a week before NATO holds a
summit meeting in Brussels attended by Bush and the leaders of the
15 other Western governments.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Soviets had also offered to reduce Warsaw Pact tank and armored
personnel carriers to just above NATO levels.
   Specifically, the Soviets said they would reduce their tank
total by 17,580 and personnel carriers by about 27,000, the
officials said.
   The Soviet position was outlined by Soviet negotiators in a
closed meeting Tuesday in Vienna with U.S. and NATO officials. It
was an elaboration of the cuts Gorbachev and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze had told Secretary of State James
A. Baker III about two weeks ago in Moscow.
   In exchange for NATO reductions, the Soviets offered to cut
Warsaw Pact tanks by 40,000, combat aircraft by 42,000, and
artillery pieces by 47,000. NATO has somewhat different totals in
each category.
   Gorbachev also proposed a reduction of 1 million troops in both
alliances and a 55 percent cutback in NATO's combat aircraft.
   By 1997, there would be equal levels of 1.35 million troops in
NATO and the Warsaw Pact, 1,500 strike aircraft, 20,000 tanks,
1,700 helicopters, 24,000 artillery pieces and 28,000 combat
vehicles.
   The two alliances opened negotiations in Vienna in February with
the aim of reducing non-nuclear forces across the vast expanse of
Europe _ from the Atlantic Ocean in the West to the Ural Mountains
in the Soviet Union.
   Besides seeking overall Warsaw Pact reductions, the United
States and its allies for years have tried to persuade the Soviets
to impose limits both on the forces they keep in Czechoslovakia,
East Germany, Poland and Hungary, and ceilings on each of the
allies' troops. These include Bulgaria and Romania, which are also
members of the Warsaw Pact.

   A United Airlines jet carrying 203 people
overshot a runway and rolled a short distance into the grass at
O'Hare International Airport today, authorities said. No injuries
were reported.
   The nosegear of the DC-10 from Philadelphia went about 10 feet
past the end of the runway after an otherwise normal landing, said
United spokeswoman Sara Dornacker.
   Everyone aboard left by mobile staircases and were taken by bus
to the terminal, she said. Evacuation chutes were not used, she
said.
   The cause of the mishap was not known, Ms. Dornacker said.
   The runway was closed while plane was removed.

   About 100,000 people Wednesday jammed the
neon-lighted, rainy streets of Hong Kong for a fifth straight day
to support the pro-democratic movement in China.
   Students, teachers, workers and clerks marched through Causeway
Bay, a major shopping district.
   The marchers paralyzed traffic for two hours, chanting:
``Support Beijing students!'' and ``Long Live People Power!''
   Chinese Premier Li Peng Saturday imposed martial law in Beijing
and described the student movements as ``turmoil.''
   Marchers also sang patriotic songs, including ``For Freedom,''
which was written and recorded Tuesday by about 100 singers to
support the Beijing students.
   ``We should have endurance,'' said a woman who also joined the
territory's largest march Sunday. She had left her husband and
young children at home to march.
   ``We hope to arouse the morale among the students in Beijing,''
said Yeung Chi-Keung, a high school teacher who led 200 students
for the march.
   ``This is also a good civic education for our students,'' he
said. ``No matter how much and how well we explain civic rights at
school, it is not as good as this first-hand experience.''
   At the rally, civic leaders spoke to the protesters and urged
Chinese Premier Li Peng to step down. They also called the Chinese
government to lift martial law and press restrictions.
   Earlier Wednesday, about 90 senior citizens chanting slogans
demonstrated outside the Xinhua News Agency, China's unofficial
representive in Hong Kong, a British colony to be turned over to
China in 1997.

   A dog catcher who shot a
groundhog for a neighboring town's annual Critter Dinner has been
forced to step down for firing his gun inside city limits.
   H.E. ``Spot'' Hudson said he was called last week to get a
groundhog out of a garage. The resident, in trapping the animal,
had injured it, so Hudson shot it and gave it to the town of Dunbar
for its wild animal dinner.
   ``I was an officer of the law. I had a right to,'' Hudson said.
   Mayor Richie Robb didn't think so and asked Hudson to step down
after nine years as dog catcher.
   ``It is illegal for citizens to do that. I think it was the
improper thing to do even if he was an officer of the law,'' Robb
said.
   Hudson usually set aside wild animals for Dunbar Mayor Frank
Leone, who holds a free Critter Dinner each February for senior
citizens.
   ``If you get young groundhog, it's excellent eating,'' Leone
said.

   Here is a transcript of President
Bush's commencement address Wednesday at the Coast Guard Academy.
   I want to congratulate each member of this year's class on
receiving your commission into such a proud service.
   You mention the Coast Guard and most people think about lives
saved at sea, daring rescue operations.
   But those daily acts of heroism are just one part of the vital
work that this Coast Guard performs.
   Right now, in Prince William Sound, the Coast Guard continues to
work around the clock in a major environmental cleanup.
   And let me, at this point, on behalf of a grateful nation,
commend Admiral Yost, through his personal commitment, his
involvement and the leadership that he has shown.
   He has served his country in the finest tradition of the United
States Coast Guard.
   And those of us who care about the environment _ and that is 250
million Americans, at a minimum _ he's showing us the way, and your
service, backing him up in every way.
   And I am very proud of what Paul Yost has done. (Applause.)
   Right now, off the Florida coast, Coast Guard patrols are
chasing down drug smugglers, helping to keep the drugs off the
streets.
   And that may be all in a day's work for the Coast Guard, but it
is absolutely vital to our national health, our well-being and our
security.
   I'm sure, on that long first day of swab summer, that you never
thought four years could pass so quickly.
   But they have, and you've worked hard.
   Billet night has come and gone, and you're ready _ Semper
Paratus, in the words of your motto _ ready to enter the Coast
Guard's service, to enter the world.
   And the truth is, that's what commencement is all about.
   The world is yours.
   And today's ceremony is really part of the change of command
from one generation to the next.
   Today, our world, your world, is changing, East and West.
   And today, I want to speak to you about the world we want to see
and what we can do to bring that new world into clear focus.
   We live in a time when we are witnessing the end of an idea: the
final chapter of the communist experiment.
   Communism is now recognized, even by many within the communist
world itself, as a failed system, one that promised economic
prosperity but failed to deliver the goods; a system that built a
wall between the people and their political aspirations.
   But the eclipse of communism is only one-half of the story of
our time.
   The other is the ascendancy of the democratic idea.
   Never before has the idea of freedom so captured the
imaginations of men and women the world over.
   And never before has the hope of freedom beckoned so many: trade
unionists in Warsaw, the people of Panama, rulers consulting the
ruled in the Soviet Union.
   And even as we speak today, the world is transfixed by the
dramatic events in Tiananmen Square.
   Everywhere those voices are speaking the language of democracy
and freedom, and we hear them, and the world hears them.
   And America will do all it can to encourage them.

<HEAD>Iranians Give Thanks For Successful Surgery on Khomeini</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Iran led one of many
prayer sessions held around the country Wednesday to give thanks
for the successful surgery on Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Tehran
Radio reported.
   President Ali Khamenei and others said the operation, to stop
bleeding in the Iranian leader's digestive tract, was a complete
success and the 89-year-old revolutionary patriarch is in good
condition a day after the operation.
   ``God willing, we will see the Imam for long years, healthier
and stronger, at the helm of the Islamic Republic,'' parliament
speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani said after visiting Khomeini.
   Doctors who performed the operation said Khomeini's heart,
kidneys, respiration, blood pressure and pulse all were normal,
said Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia.
   Rafsanjani was received by Khomeini along with close friends and
relatives in his hospital room Wednesday morning, the radio said.
   ``He was in bed, and the doctors were around him. His health was
very good,'' Rafsanjani was quoted as saying. ``He was very
cheerful. I asked him if he had any pain, and he replied that we
has very little and that he is comfortable. He is feeling very
well.''
   His previously unreported illness highlighted the question of
who will govern Iran after he dies.
   Khomeini ousted his designated successor, Ayatollah Hussein Ali
Montazeri, on March 28 for criticizing his policies and appointed a
20-man committee of leading political, clerical and legal figures
to settle the leadership question.
   Iran has been in political turmoil since last August's
cease-fire in the eight-year gulf war, with factions battling
openly for supremacy in a post-Khomeini era.
   Indications are that with no single figure combining Khomeini's
spiritual and political authority, Iran will have a collective
leadership after he dies.
   Rafsanjani and Khomeini's son, Ahmad, are prime candidates.
   Other possibilities include Ayatollah Ali Meshkini, radical
chairman of the 83-member Assembly of Experts which normally rules
on constitutional matters; Ahmad Jannati, a leading member of the
13-man Council of Guardians that rules on the Islamic correctness
of legislation; and Chief Justice Ayatollah Musavi Ardebili.
   Benazir Bhutto, prime minister of neighboring Moslem Pakistan,
sent a message to Khomeini saying she and her people pray for his
speedy and complete recovery, reported Iran's official news agency.
   ``May Allah grant you long life so that you continue to lead the
fraternal people of Iran on the path of progress and prosperity,''
the message said.

   Many scientists at a workshop set up to
investigate cold fusion say they will keep looking for evidence of
the process, but nearly all of them say they have seen no sign yet
it exists.
   The workshop on the claims of University of Utah chemist Stanley
Pons and his British colleague, Martin Fleischmann, has brought
together an estimated 500 physicists and chemists with a wide
variety of theories.
   Pons and Fleischmann startled the scientific world with the
announcement two months ago that they had achieved cold fusion in a
simple experiment using a palladium electrode and water made with
deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen.
   The conventional belief was that fusion as an energy source
could be attained only at high temperatures and by applying high
power.
   The announcement has been the subjects of several conferences
around the country, including the three-day workshop here. The
workshop, sponsored by Los Alamos National Laboratory, concludes
Thursday.
   ``There seems to be an intense scientific interest in the
possibility that a nuclear reaction takes place in a so-far
unanticipated site,'' said Norman Hackerman, retired professor of
chemistry at Rice and Texas universities.
   Pons and Fleischmann ignored the opportunity to attend the
workshop and defend their claims. They also canceled a meeting with
Utah officials who want to give them $5 million for their research.
   The observations at the conference included many like those of
physicist Nathan Lewis of the California Institute of Technology.
He flatly rejected the Pons-Fleischmann assertions.
   Hopeful commentary came from Texas A&amp;M University chemist John
Appleby. He suggested that fusion has sometimes occurred in his
team's experiment.
   Appleby declined to say in an interview that fusion occurred in
the Pons-Fleischmann experiments. If it is fusion, he said, it is
not occurring in the usual way.
   Fusion is a process in which light atoms combine to form heavier
elements, releasing energy.
   Appleby's encouraging findings included the discovery of large
amounts of tritium in the heavy water solution, along with a small
number of neutrons. Tritium can be a product of fusion.
   He also described different heat measurements using different
solutions, such as a lithium-based bath and a sodium solution that
shut down all reactions.
   ``We don't know what's going on, but it is not chemistry,''
Appleby said. ``There's a lot of confusion, rather than fusion,
going on.''
   Petar Tomas, a physicist with the Ruder Boskovic Institute in
Yugoslavia, said he found the Utah claims ``difficult to believe.''
But he proclaimed much of the theoretical physics presented at the
workshop ``positive'' and headed in the right direction.

   President Bush today welcomed new arms
reduction proposals by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev but
said they were ``not enough'' to redress the edge Warsaw Pact
forces maintain over NATO in Europe.
   He also challenged Gorbachev to disclose accurate figures on
Soviet military spending. ``Open the ledger,'' Bush said in a
commencement address to the Coast Guard Academy.
   Speaking only a day after the Soviet leader offered to impose
new limits on troops stationed in Eastern Europe and on Soviet
forces overall, Bush said, ``The Soviets are now being forthcoming
and we hope to achieve the reductions that we seek.''
   However, he said, ``these reductions alone, even if implemented,
are not enough to eliminate the superiority the Soviet Union enjoys
now.''
   Bush declared communism ``a failed system'' and said the West
was entering a new era based on economic and political success.
   ``There is an opportunity before us to shape a new world,'' Bush
said.
   He took note of the pro-democracy demonstrators who have
occupied Beijing's Tiananmen Square for more than 10 days and said
the United States ``will do all it can to encourage'' those who
``are speaking the language of democracy and freedom.''
   He wished Gorbachev success in attempting to restructure the
Soviet economy and said lasting peace was now more likely than ever
before.
   But Bush said it still was necessary to maintain a strong
nuclear deterrence with a new U.S. long-range mobile missile and
making other ocean-spanning land-based missiles transportable.
   ``We live in a time when we are witnessing the end of an idea _
the final chapter of the Communist experiment,'' Bush said. He
called Communism ``a failed system, one that promised economic
prosperity but failed to deliver the goods, a system that built a
wall between the people and their political aspirations.''
   He urged further reductions by the Soviet-led alliance and
reiterated his call for territorial overflights on both sides.
   Bush also played on the theme of open markets in his speech and
said ``if we succeed, the next decade, and the century beyond, will
be an era of unparalleled growth.''
   Bush said success also required an end to conflict and turmoil.
He said the United States and its allies were pursuing a strategy
of strength, economically, diplomatically and militarily.
   In the Soviet Union, the president said, a dramatic process is
unfolding.
   ``Make no mistake, our policy is to seize every _ and I mean
every _ opportunity to build a better and more stabile relationship
with the Soviet Union.''
   He said ``we want to see perestroika (economic restructuring)
succeed'' as well as the policy of openness, known as glasnost.
   White House aides said Bush rejected a prepared text and added
new sections hours before he was to speak.
   A NATO session Bush is attending in Brussels next Monday and
Tuesday with the leaders of 15 other Western governments is likely
to be dominated by how to respond to a series of arms control
initiatives by Gorbachev.
   In Washington, U.S. officials said Gorbachev had made proposals
to impose ceilings on Soviet forces stationed in Eastern Europe as
well as outlining possible reductions in Soviet conventional arms.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the latest Gorbachev
proposal represented the first time the Soviets had agreed to an
overall ceiling on conventional forces.
   ``We find this very promising,'' Fitzwater said. ``These are
major, major concessions that put them more in line with the NATO
proposal.''
   National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft said Gorbachev had
given Secretary of State James A. Baker III a general description
of the Soviet proposal during Baker's visit to Moscow earlier this
month but that ``they were vague. Now they've put more meat on it.''
   Scowcroft, who accompanied Bush to the Coast Guard academy, told
reporters the Soviet proposal ``looks like a serious proposal and
we will treat it as a serious proposal. We will look at it.''
   Meanwhile, Bush said in an interview with European journalists
released today that new Soviet proposals for reducing conventional
forces would be helpful, but it would be reckless for NATO ``to lay
down our weapons and turn them into plowshares.''
   Bush also expressed interest in a possible visit to
Communist-ruled East Germany. Asked what it would take to get him
to make such a trip, the president said: ``First, an invitation.''
   Addressing the Coast Guard graduates, Bush said that ``never
before has the idea of freedom so captured the imaginations of men
and women the world over _ and never before has the hope of freedom
beckoned so many.
   ``Trade unioninsts in Warsaw. The people of Panama. Rulers
consulting the ruled in the Soviet Union. And even as we speak
today, the world is transfixed by the dramatic events in Tiananmen
Square.
   ``Everywhere those voices are speaking the language of democracy
and freedom. And we hear them. And the world hears them. And
America will do all it can to encourage them.''
   In the interview with European journalists, he said that the
massive protests in China and political reform movements in other
parts of the world show ``the democratic way is on the march and it
is not going to be stopped.''
   Still, the president cautioned, ``I'm old enough to remember
Hungary in 1956 and I don't want to be a catalyst for encouraging a
course of action that would inevitably lead to violence and
bloodshed.''
   He said Gorbachev's recent offers, in reality, were no more than
responses to NATO proposals ``and then it's reported as though this
is an enormous step forward...So we need a little light in all of
this.''
   And, while giving the Soviet leader points for public relations,
Bush declared, ``You do not make foreign policy based on the
personality or charm of an individual in another country. You do it
on facts.''
   Bush indicated in the interview, with reporters from news
organizations from Britain, West Germany, Italy and Belgium, that a
compromise with West Germany on short-range missiles might not be
possible before the 16-nation NATO summit that begins on Monday.
   ``I have felt that we can resolve this issue before we get to
Brussels. I'm not sure now, but we'll keep working the problem,''
Bush said.
   Despite a transatlantic flurry of proposals and counterproposals
over the past few days, there is no agreement on proposed
superpower talks to reduce short-range missiles in Europe.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has called for such talks.
Bush opposes them, at least while Soviet-bloc nations retain an
advantage in tanks and troops.
   Bush spoke to reporters from Italy's Il Messaggero, Britain's
The Guardian, Belgium's De Standaard and West Germany's Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung.

   The thousands of youths camped in Tiananmen
Square are only the most visible portion of an increasingly
radicalized student population that is organizing for a long-term
political struggle.
   They plan to keep working for reforms, such as a free press and
an end to widespread official corruption, regardless of whether
Communist Party reformers win a power struggle with conservatives.
   ``If we get our immediate goals _ including a dialogue with the
government _ we will calm down a bit and be able to study. But our
movement won't be over,'' said Chen Zhangbao, an activist at
Beijing Normal University.
   On his and other Beijing campuses, students who did not join or
who left the 12-day-old Tiananmen sit-in were collecting supplies
for the students in the square, printing leaflets and speading word
on the streets of their reform movement.
   Some read announcements and speeches into loudspeaker networks
that now extend off-campus. Others kept an eye on the movements of
troops who were ordered Saturday to impose martial law in the city
center but were blocked on the outskirts by crowds of students and
supporters.
   Some students worked shifts on traffic control units around the
square. Some made posters.
   What the students weren't doing was going to class.
   ``We're still studying on our own, but ... we're pretty busy
working for the movement,'' said Chen, a Chinese literature major
who admits he hasn't cracked a book in a while.
   Chen works in his campus' ``propaganda department'' of what
students have come to call simply ``the movement'' _ short for
``the patriotic student democracy movement.''
   Each campus also has a secretariat, logistics department and
reception department for greeting out-of-town students coming to
Beijing to join the movement.
   One big project has been organizing four teams of about 500
students each from Beijing Normal University to take turns sitting
in the square for 12-hour shifts, Chen said. Other schools have
organized similar teams.
   ``We have to ensure that the students get some rest,'' he said.
``The government could delay for several weeks'' in responding to
student terms for leaving the square: the resignation of Premier Li
Peng, an end to martial law and a dialogue with the government on
reform.
   The hall in Chen's dormitory is piled with food and clothing
donated by local residents for the protesters in the square. The
sit-in began May 13 with a hunger strike by about 2,000 students,
grew to include about 70,000 students and thousands more
supporters, then shrank over the weekend after the hunger strike
ended.
   The students plan to continue the sit-in to dramatize their
demands, but say it is not their only focus.
   Thousands have volunteered to go to factories and residential
areas to hand out leaflets and lead political discussions.
   ``We want to reach as broad an audience as possible,'' said
Zhang Xiaojun, a 25-year-old math student who sat at a picnic table
with a map of the city in front of him, signing up students.
   Beijing University students also have organized ``propaganda
teams,'' said activist Ma Xieli.
   When the student movement began April 15 with the death of a
leading reformer, former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang, only a
few student leaders were able to articulate the reasons for their
dissatisfaction with the government.
   But the shared experiences of the past six weeks, including
dramatic confrontations with police and exhiliarating marches
joined by hundreds of thousands of local residents, have
politicized the student population. Many say they won't return to
the relatively drab routine of a Chinese college student, which
allows little opportunity for individual initiative.
   ``When we leave the square that doesn't mean we will have
finished the struggle,'' Ma said, even if the students succeed in
forcing a change of government. ``Our chief goal isn't for this or
that person to resign but to speed up the progress of democracy.''
   ``Regardless of what faction takes power, it will seek to
destroy our movement,'' said Chen. ``The party and government have
to think of their own interests.
   ``Democracy and freedom and science cannot be accomplished in
one or two years,'' he said. ``We can only struggle stage by stage.
I am willing to keep working, and I hope the next generation of
students will too.''

<TEXT>
   So today, I want to speak about our security strategy for the
1990s, one that advances American ideals and upholds American aims.
   Amidst the many challenges we'll face, there will be risks.
   But let me assure you, we'll find more than our share of
opportunities.
   We and our allies are strong _ stronger, really, than at any
point in postwar period, and more capable than ever of supporting
the cause of freedom.
   There's an opportunity before us to shape a new world.
   What is it that we want to see?
   It is a growing community of democracies anchoring international
peace and stability, and a dynamic free market system generating
prosperity and progress on a global scale.
   The economic foundation of this new era is the proven success of
the free market, and nurturing that foundation are the values
rooted in freedom and democracy.
   Our country, America, was founded on these values, and they gave
us the confidence that flows from strength.
   So let's be clear about one thing.
   America looks forward to the challenge of an emerging global
market, but these values are not ours alone.
   They are now shared by our friends and allies around the globe.
   The economic rise of Europe and the nations of the Pacific rim
is the growing success of our postwar policy.
   This time is a time of tremendous opportunity, and destiny is in
our own hands.
   To reach the world we want to see, we've got to work, and work
hard.
   There's a lot of work ahead of us.
   We must resolve international trade problems that threaten to
pit friends and allies against one another.
   We must combat misguided notions of economic nationalism that
will tell us to close off our economies to foreign competition just
when the global marketplace has become a fact of life.
   We must open the door to the nations of Eastern Europe and other
socialist countries that embrace free market reforms.
   And finally, for developing nations heavily burdened with debt,
we must provide assistance and encourage the market reforms that
will set those nations on a path towards growth.
   If we succeed, the next decade and the century beyond will be an
era of unparalleled growth, an era which sees the flourishing of
freedom, peace and prosperity around the world.
   But this new era cannot unfold in a climate where conflict and
turmoil exist, and therefore, our goals must also include security
and stability.
   Security for fully _ security and stability.
   Security _ this text is going crazy on this machine here _
(laughter).
   Security for ourselves and our allies and our friends, stability
in the international arena, and in the end to regional conflicts.
   Such goals are constant, but the strategy we employ to reach
them can and must change as the world changes.
   Today the need for a dynamic and adaptable strategy is
imperative.
   We must be strong economically, diplomatically, and as you know,
militarily, to take advantage of the opportunities open to us in a
world of rapid change.
   And nowhere will the ultimate consequences of change have more
significance for world security than within the Soviet Union itself.
   What we're seeing now in the Soviet Union is indeed dramatic.
   The process is still ongoing, unfinished.
   But make no mistake, our policy is to seize every _ and I mean
every _ opportunity to build a better, more stable relationship
with the Soviet Union, just as it is our policy to defend American
interests in light of the enduring reality of Soviet military power.
   We want to see perestroika succeed, and we want to see the
policies of glasnost and perestroika _ so far a revolution imposed
from top down _ institutionalized within the Soviet Union.

   The Cold War is over, but global security now is
threatened by the buildup of ballistic missiles in developing
countries, a research institute said Wednesday in an annual report.
   The International Institute for Strategic Studies also raised
doubts about whether Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will
succeed with his reforms, or even survive.
   ``While skepticism about Gorbachev's sincerity was subsiding
among Western leaders, questions about his ability to succeed, and
even to stay in power, abound,'' said the report.
   ``Open opposition and challenges have been replaced with
grumbling beneath the surface,'' it said. ``This does not
necessarily make Gorbachev's situation any less dangerous.''
   Institute director Francois Heisbourg told a news conference
that 1988 was ``the year in which the Cold War ended.''
   ``We move from a highly polarized and very threatening world ...
(into one) which will be much less stable, much more messy, albeit
with a much more relaxed East-West relationship,'' Heisbourg said.
   On the proliferation of missiles, including those capable of
carrying nuclear warheads, the survey said that within the last two
years, new ballistic missile programs have been revealed throughout
the Third World posing ``global risks.''
   ``In all, more than 20 developing countries have ballistic
missiles programs,'' said the survey.
   Argentina, Brazil, India, Iran, Iraq and Israel have several
missile development programs, while North Korea, South Korea, Libya
and Taiwan each have highly secret missile programs, the survey
said.
   It also listed Afghanistan, Algeria, Cuba, Egypt, Indonesia,
Kuwait, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, North Yemen and South Yemen
among 21 developing countries known to have acquired ballistic
missiles.
   ``While no developing country except China appears capable of
producing an intercontinental weapon before the end of the century,
space-launch vehicles under development in Brazil, India, Israel
and Argentina could form the basis for long-range missiles in the
future,'' the survey said.
   Arsenals of other developing countries varied from the
Soviet-made, 44-mile range Frog-7 held by Algeria and Kuwait, to
sophisticated weapons with ranges of more than 1,242 miles acquired
by Saudi Arabia from China last year and being developed
domestically by India, the survey said.
   India's Agni missile will reportedly be capable of having a
range of 1,550 miles, the survey said. ``Missiles of such range are
difficult to justify unless they carry nuclear weapons,'' it added.
   The most common ballistic missile in the Third World was the
Soviet Scud-B, with a 175-mile range, it said. These missiles were
used in Afghanistan and during the Iran-Iraq war.
   The survey said the U.S.-led Missile Technology Control Regime,
signed by seven Western nations in 1987, appeared merely to have
slowed some missile programs, but not halted the proliferation.
   ``Countries like Brazil and India have had to postpone launch
schedules and redouble their domestic research effort,'' said the
survey.
   ``Other countries, such as Argentina and Egypt, have moved to
take advantage of unlicensed, black-market technology. Israel's
domestic research and development is so far advanced that it is, in
effect, immune.''

<HEAD>Powers, Duties of New Soviet Congress Still Uncertain</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The exact powers and duties of the Congress of
People's Deputies remain uncertain as reformers scrambled Wednesday
to unite forces and promote their own agendas.
   Under political reforms championed by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev that created the congress, the 2,250-member body is
supposed to meet once a year to elect a smaller, working
legislature and a handful of top officials, including the Soviet
president.
   But progressive deputies are demanding the congress debate the
country's critical problems, including the economy and environment,
and human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov has even called for it
to supersede the smaller legislature, the Supreme Soviet, as the
chief law-making organ.
   The exact role the congress assumes for itself won't be known
until the deputies gather at the Kremlin Palace of Congresses. As
foreseen in the laws and constitutional amendments that created the
congress, its duties include:
   _ Electing the Soviet president, who will assume more power. The
president will be in charge of general administration of the
country and will chair the Defense Council, make proposals to the
Supreme Soviet, negotiate with foreign countries and sign treaties
and make laws.
   _ Electing from among its members the the 542-member Supreme
Soviet. That body will meet for two four-month terms yearly as the
country's working legislature.
   _ Making changes in the Soviet Constitution.
   _ Reviewing the president's choice for premier, the chairman of
the Supreme Court and the prosecutor-general.
   Among the new parliamentarians who will convene Thursday morning
at the Kremlin for the inaugural session of the congress, there are:
   _ 750 deputies elected by Soviet voters from geographical
districts of equal population throughout the country.
   _ 750 deputies elected by voters to represent the 15 constituent
Soviet republics as well as the autonomous territories and regions
that are official homelands for the Soviet Union's more than 100
ethnic groups.
   _ 750 deputies directly chosen by officially sanctioned
organizations ranging from the Communist Party, labor unions and
the Soviet Academy of Sciences to the national associations of
booklovers and stamp collectors.

   Paul Jasperson, who sued a nail salon two
years ago claiming he was refused a pedicure there because he
suffered from AIDS, has died of the disease, his attorney said. He
was 37.
   Jasperson, who died May 15, filed suit against Jessica's Nail
Salon in January 1987, contending the business violated a West
Hollywood ordinance that prohibited discrimination against people
with AIDS.
   A court found the salon did refuse the pedicure, but refused to
issue an injunction barring such action.
   Jasperson's attorney, Gloria Allred, said Monday she would
pursue an appeal on his behalf.
   Ms. Allred said Jasperson proceeded with the lawsuit ``at great
risk to his own health ... in order to help win rights for others.''
   Jasperson is survived by his parents and two brothers. A
memorial service is scheduled Saturday.

<TEXT>
   And we want to see perestroika extended as well.
   We want to see a Soviet Union that restructures its relationship
toward the rest of the world, a Soviet Union that is a force for
constructive solutions to the world's problems.
   The grand strategy of the West during the postwar period has
been based on the concept of containment _ checking the Soviet
Union's expansionist aims in the hope that the Soviet system itself
would one day be forced to confront its internal contradictions.
   The ferment in the Soviet Union today affirms the wisdom of this
strategy.
   And now, we have a precious opportunity to move beyond
containment.
   You are graduating into an exciting world where the opportunity
for peace, world peace, lasting peace, has never been better.
   Our goal _ integrating the Soviet Union into the community of
nations is every bit as ambitious as containment was at its time,
and it holds tremendous promise for international stability.
   Coping with a changing Soviet Union will be a challenge of the
highest order, but the security challenges we face today do not
come from the East alone.
   The emergence of regional powers is rapidly changing the
strategic landscape.
   In the Middle East, in South Asia, in our own hemisphere, a
growing number of nations are acquiring advanced and highly
destructive capabilties, in some cases, weapons of mass destruction
and the means to deliver them.
   And it is an unfortunate fact that the world faces increasing
threats from armed insurgencies, terrorists, and as you in the
Coast Guard are well aware, narcotics traffickers; and in some
regions, an unholy alliance of all three.
   Our task is clear: We must curb the proliferation of advanced
weaponry.
   We must check the aggressive ambitions of renegade regimes.
   And we must enhance the ability of our friends to defend
themselves.
   We have not yet mastered the complex challenge.
   We and our allies must construct a common strategy for stability
in the developing world.
   How we and our allies deal with these diverse challenges depends
on how well we understand the key elements of defense strategy.
   So let me just mention today two points in particular:
   First, the need for an effective deterrent, one that
demonstrates, to our allies and adversaries alike, American
strength, American resolve.
   And second, the need to maintain an approach to arms reduction
that promotes stability at the lowest feasible level of armaments.
   Deterrence is central to our defense strategy.
   The key to keeping the peace is convincing our adversaries that
the cost of aggression against us or our allies is simply
unacceptable.
   In today's world, nuclear forces are essential to deterrence.
   Our challenge is to protect those deterrent systems from attack.
   And that's why we'll move Peacekeeper ICBMs out of fixed and
vulnerable silos, making them mobile, and thus harder to target.
   Looking to the longer term, we will also develop and deploy a
new highly mobile single-warhead missile, the Midgetman.
   With only minutes of warning, these new missiles can relocate
out of harm's way.
   Any attack against systems like this will fail.
   And we're also researching, and we're committed to deploy when
ready, a more comprehensive defensive system, known as SDI.
   Our premise is straightforward: Defense against incoming
missiles endangers no person, endangers no country.
   We're also working to reduce the threat we face, both nuclear
and conventional.

   A federal judge on Wednesday told
lawyers squabbling over a planned marijuana rally in North Adams to
agree on a site suitable for the crowd expected or risk a court
order.
   ``I hate to issue an order requiring the town to use one of
those fields,'' Chief U.S. District Judge Frank Freedman told
attorneys for the city of North Adams and for the rally organizers.
   The North Adams Parks and Recreation Commission denied a permit
to a marijuana law reform group that wanted to stage a May 28 rally
in North Adams. The group advocates decriminalizing marijuana.
   The commission argued that city parks could not accommodate the
3,000 people that the Massachusetts Cannabis Reform Coalition said
it expected for the rally.
   ``It's not who they are,'' commission Chairman Donald Esposito
said. ``The only thing I'm interested in is protecting the city's
fields.''
   Richard Evans, an attorney representing the coalition, filed a
complaint May 15 alleging that the group's constitutional rights to
free speech and assembly were being violated.
   ``The plaintiffs are residents of North Adams who wish simply to
exercise their rights to a meeting on a serious topic of interest,
both nationally and locally,'' Evans said.
   He called the crowd estimate of 2,000 to 3,000 people ``a little
optimistic'' and said plaintiffs would be willing to accept a limit
of 1,000 people at the rally.

<TEXT>
   A man told police he killed a fellow
veteran who tried to prevent him from committing suicide.
   ``I wish it had been me instead of him,'' said Richard Papineau,
40, who was arraigned as a fugitive Tuesday. He is charged in New
Hampshire with murdering Frank Thibeault, who was shot to death in
the woods in Winchester, N.H.
   Papineau was arrested Monday at Northampton State Hospital, a
psychiatric facility where he had been held to determine whether he
could stand trial on unrelated charges of assaulting his former
wife and girlfriend.
   A former Marine who received the Bronze Star in Vietnam, he told
police, the Union-News in Springfield and The Recorder in
Greenfield that he killed Thibeault.
   He identified the victim as a patient at the Veterans
Administration Hospital in Northampton and said the killing
occurred after the two drove to New Hampshire on April 24, the
newspapers said.
   ``I still wish it had been me instead of him, just like I wish
it had been me instead of the guys in Vietnam,'' he said. ``I've
been living with them for 22 years. Now there is one more name on
that list and I will live with them until I check out.''
   Papineau said he was distraught over a restraining order that
kept him away from the apartment shared by his girlfriend and his
former wife. He said he stopped by the side of the road and, after
walking into the woods, put a gun to his head.
   ``I had the barrel in my face. I was sitting on a rock,''
Papineau said. Thibeault ``came up behind me and said, `I'm not
going to let you do this,' and grabbed me. I kind of freaked. The
gun went off and he went down.''
   ``The next thing I knew, the gun was empty and I was just
standing there,'' he said.
   Papineau, who was discharged from the Marines in 1968 for
``acute anxiety neurosis,'' has been in and out of mental hospitals
since torching a Buddhist shrine in the Berkshire Hills six years
ago while on a weekend pass from a VA hospital.
   He and two other men said they set the fire to draw attention to
a lack of treatment programs for Vietnam veterans.

   The largest and longest study yet on the
anti-aging effects of Retin-A confirms that the acne cream does
smooth wrinkles, but reducing doses apparently reduces its
effectiveness, researchers say.
   ``There is no question that the more you use, the more you
improve,'' said University of Arizona researcher Clayton Owens.
``In those people who used the strongest doses, what we saw was a
decrease in fine wrinkling, in roughness and in uneven coloring.''
   The University of Michigan found a year ago that Retin-A _ a
synthetic form of Vitamin A known as tretinoin, long used to treat
acne _ dramatically reduced the ravages of aging and sun damage in
a short-term study of about 30 people.
   Since then, nationwide studies have been under way on how well
it works and whether it is safe. The federal government has yet to
approve it for this use, but it's available by prescription from
physicians.
   Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a strong
statement condemning indiscriminate use of Retin-A to treat
wrinkles.
   FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young has said there is no conclusive
evidence the drug reduces wrinkles. ``Long-term animal studies and
well-controlled clinical trials involving larger numbers of
patients in various age groups are needed to assess the risks and
benefits,'' he said.
   The Michigan study used a high dose of the drug and patients
suffered significant known side effects of Retin-A, peeling,
burning, redness and overall irritation of the skin.
   A six-month study of more than 300 patients last year at the
University of Arizona, Duke University, New York University and the
University of Minnesota used lower and varying doses of the drug to
learn whether side effects could be eased while still getting the
positive anti-aging effects, Owens said. Analysis of the six months
of Retin-A use still is under way, he said.
   Divided into four groups, the 300-plus patients used daily doses
of Retin-A ranging from the highest tretinoin concentration of 0.05
percent, to a moderate dose of 0.01 percent, to a weak dose of
0.001 percent, to a zero-dose placebo group. The Michigan study
used concentrations twice as high, at 0.10 strength.
   Nearly 90 percent of patients using the 0.05 dose showed at
least some improvement, with half showing moderate to strong
improvement, said Owens. Those using lower doses showed some
effects of the Retin-A, but the results were much weaker and
``questionable,'' he said.
   The patients in the study were from 50 to 70 years old and were
chosen because they showed moderate, not severe, signs of
sun-damaged skin: mostly fine, but also some coarse wrinkling, also
blotchy coloring and rough texture.
   All of these factors were visibly and statistically rated, as
were the side effects. In addition, the length and depth of
wrinkles were measured in plastic impressions, and skin biopsies
are still being analyzed microscopically.
   Patients used the Retin-A daily, along with sunscreens and
moisturizers.
   ``The biggest improvement was in the skin pigment, in evening
out the skin's color and getting rid of blotches and brown spots,''
said Owens. ``The next biggest improvment was in fine wrinkling _
the cross-hatches below the eye and in the crow's-feet area. After
that, we saw improvement in texture _ in smoothing out rough skin.''
   There was also some improvement in deeper, coarser wrinkles in
some patients, but since that problem was not prevalent in most of
the patients, it was difficult to measure that impact
scientifically, he said.
   Owens also said the side effects of Retin-A were less than
expected.
   ``Most people had mild to moderate side effects _ mostly peeling
and some redness. By and large, the side effects were tolerated
well. Usually, the effects would last a few days, then go away,
then come back for a few days. After a few months, the skin seems
to get used to the drug. Only three or four people had constant
irritation, but nobody had any serious problems.''
   So what is the best dosage of Retin-A to halt the ravages of
time?
   ``I know this will sound like a cop-out,'' Owens answered. ``But
that is something that has to be determined between the patient and
the doctor. People react differently to the stuff. The doctor has
to assess your skin type. He will know when the irritation is too
much, and if you are using enough to get good results. That is why
Retin-A will remain a prescription drug for some time.''

<TEXT>
   Students voted Wednesday to end a
university sit-in against government refusal to legalize their
independent union, and said they would concentrate on electing the
Solidarity parliament slate June 4.
   They said a Warsaw court's rejection Tuesday of the application
to register the Independent Students Association, known as NZS, was
a futile attempt to divide students from Solidarity just the before
the elections.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said Poland's communist
authorities broke a pledge by not making NZS legal. The court
ruling was pronounced the same day an episode of Solidarity's
weekly television program was canceled.
   ``The rejection of the registration of NZS breaks the round
table decisions,'' he said in a statement released by the
Solidarity Citizens Committee. ``It causes justified anxiety of NZS
activists.''
   Walesa's independent union and NZS were recognized after their
formation in 1980 but outlawed in 1982 under martial law.
   The ``round table'' accords the government and opposition signed
April 5 provided for them to be made legal again, but a question
arose about the NZS charter. The agreements also promised
Solidarity access to television.
   At a news conference Wednesday, Solidarity spokesmen said their
surveys indicate the union's candidates will do well.
   ``According to our preliminary studies concerning Warsaw our
candidates have sufficient advantage to win the elections,'' said
Jan Litynski of Warsaw. ``The nervousness of the propaganda
apparatus stems from this.''
   He said the Solidarity candidate in central Warsaw had a 7-1
edge on Jerzy Urban, the former government spokesman running as an
independent.
   A freely elected Senate is being added to the unicameral
parliament, called the Sejm, and 35 percent of the Sejm seats are
being contested. The other 65 percent are reserved for the
Communists and their allies.
   Janusz Onyszkiewicz, national Solidarity spokesman, counseled
``moderation and reason'' before the elections.
   ``The students' strong reaction is psychologically
understandable,'' he said. ``We think students will find effective
means of action that will assure legalization of NZS and also take
into account the general political consequences of their actions.''
   About 300 students took part in a noon rally at Warsaw
University and said they would end the sit-in Thursday.
   They began the protest Tuesday and were joined by students in
other cities. Whether those sit-ins also would end was not clear.
   Warm applause greeted Walesa's statement when it was read at the
campus rally.
   Walesa was in Gdansk, where he is an electrician at the Lenin
Shipyard and led the strike in which Solidarity was born. During a
campaign rally at the shipyard, which the government has ordered
closed, he and Solidarity candidates said the union was committed
to saving it.
   One of the chants workers directed at the government was:
``Lenin is yours, but the shipyard is ours!'' It is scheduled to
close at the end of 1990.
   Slawek Gorecki, an NZS spokesman, said the court decision was a
government attempt to divide students from Solidarity, but they
would continue to support the Solidarity election campaign.
   ``This provocation has failed and has even consolidated'' NZS
and Solidarity, he said. ``Though there were differences between
us, this ... will help clear them up.''
   Many students believe Solidarity did not press hard enough for
the legalization of their union.
   Zbigniew Bujak, Solidarity leader for the Warsaw region, told
the students the court decision ``was done to divide us'' before
the election, ``to cause trouble just when we have the chance for
the biggest victory in postwar Poland.''
   The government press office said it had no immediate response to
charges that the April agreements had been violated, and referred
inquiries to state television authorities and the court. Spokesmen
at both institutions said no one was available to comment.
   Just before the Solidarity program was scheduled to be broadcast
Tuesday, an announcer read a statemtnt saying authorities had
canceled it ``because the contents ... aim against the round-table
agreements.''
   The 45-minute broadcast was to have been the third weekly
program produced by Solidarity. It consisted of a discussion of
human rights by Solidarity candidates for Parliament who are
lawyers.
   Onyszkiewicz, the national Solidarity spokesman, said the
government apparently objected to references in the discussion to
abuses by riot police and other security forces.
   He suggested Solidarity shows be submitted to regular censors,
who have rules about what should be cut, rather than being canceled
entirely if the authorities are displeased.

   The INF treaty demonstrates that willingness.
   In addition, in the past decade, NATO has unilaterally removed
2,400 shorter-range theater warheads.
   But theater nuclear forces contribute to stability, no less than
strategic forces.
   And thus it would be irresponsible to depend solely on strategic
nuclear forces to defer conflict in Europe.
   The conventional balance in Europe is just as important and is
linked to the nuclear balance for more than 40 years.
   And look at your history books to see how pronounced this
accomplishment is.
   For more than 40 years, the Warsaw Pact's massive advantage in
conventional forces has cast a shadow over Europe.
   The unilateral reductions President Gorbachev has promised give
us hope that we can now redress that imbalance.
   We welcome those steps because, if implemented, they will help
reduce the threat of surprise attack.
   And they confirm what we've said all along _ that Soviet
military power far exceeds the levels needed to defend the
legitimate security interests of the U.S.S.R.
   And we must keep in mind that these reductions alone, even if
implemented, are not enough to eliminate the significant numerical
superiority that the Soviet Union enjoys right now.
   Through negotiation, we can now transform the military landscape
of Europe.
   The issues are complex.
   Stakes are very high.
   But the Soviets are now being forthcoming and we hope to achieve
the reductions that we seek.
   Let me emphasize _ our aim is nothing less than removing war as
an option in Europe.
   The U.S.S.R. has said that it is willing to abandon its age-old
reliance on offensive strategy.
   It's time to begin.
   This should mean a smaller force, one less reliant on tanks and
artillery and personnel carriers that provide the Soviets'
offensive striking power.
   A restructured Warsaw Pact, one that mirrors the defensive
posture of NATO, would make Europe and the world more secure.
   Peace can also be enhanced by movement towards more openness in
military activities.
   And two weeks ago, I proposed an open-skies initiative to extend
the concept of openness.
   That plan for territorial overflights would increase our mutual
security against sudden and threatening military activities.
   In the same spirit, let us extend this openness to military
expenditures as well.
   I call on the Soviets to do as we have always done.
   Let's open the ledgers, publish an accurate defense budget.
   But as we move forward, we must be realistic.
   Transformations of this magnitude will not happen overnight.
   If we are to reach our goals, a great deal is required of us,
our allies and of the Soviet Union, but we can succeed.
   I began today by speaking about the triumph of a particular,
peculiar, very special American ideal: freedom.
   And I know there are those who may think there is something
presumptuous about that claim, those who will think it's boastful,
but it is not for one simple reason.
   Democracy isn't our creation.
   It is our inheritance, and we can't take credit for democracy,
but we can take that precious gift of freedom, preserve it and pass
it on as my generation does to you and you, too, will do one day.
   And perhaps, provided we seize the opportunities open to us, we
can help others attain the freedom that we cherish.
   As I said on the Capitol steps on the day I took this office,
president of the United States, ``There is but one just use of
power, and it is to serve people.''
   As your commander in chief, let me call on this Coast Guard
class to reaffirm with me that American power will continue in its
service to the enduring ideals of democracy and freedom.
   Congratulations to each and every one of you, thank you and God
bless the United States of America.
   Thank you all very much.

   Dick Clark is justifiably proud of
his place in rock 'n' roll history, but he admits he wouldn't have
minded being a headliner instead of a host.
   ``My only regret is that I didn't study more on the piano,''
Clark said in a recent interview. ``I've gotten awards where I'm
mentioned in the same company of musicians, and while it makes me
proud, it also humbles me.''
   Still, he said, ``I may not be a king of rock 'n' roll ... but I
certainly was there playing midwife.''
   Clark, who hosted ``American Bandstand'' on television for more
than 30 years, will play host to The Spinners, The Guess Who, The
Association and The Drifters in the ``American Bandstand Concert
Tour'' at Bally's Grand Hotel Casino on Saturday.
   The tour is one of Clark's first performing jobs since he gave
the reins of ``American Bandstand'' over to his hand-picked
successor, David Hirsch, 26, earlier this year.
   Clark, who was 26 when he took over ``Bandstand'' and now is 59,
concedes that he stepped down reluctantly.
   ``It's one of those things I didn't want to say goodbye to,'' he
said. ``But I was getting out of an age range with the kids that I
was comfortable with.''

   A 17-year-old girl who allegedly took part in a
pornographic videotape with actor Rob Lowe reportedly told her
next-door neighbor that she planned to blackmail the star for $2
million.
   The neighbor's statement was contained in a court affidavit
filed last summer in Cobb County Superior Court as part of the
girl's parents' divorce, The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta
Constitution reported Wednesday.
   The girl's mother filed a civil lawsuit in Fulton County on May
12 seeking unspecified civil damages from Lowe, and prosecutors are
considering possible criminal charges against the 24-year-old Brat
Pack star for exploitation of a minor. The girl was 16 at the time
of the alleged incident.
   News reports have said the girl, who turned 17 in April,
apparently met Lowe in Atlanta during last summer's Democratic
National Convention.
   An acquaintance said in an affidavit filed in the Cobb County
case that the girl said she and another woman had sex with Lowe
``and that they all took turns filming each other,'' the newspapers
reported.
   Television stations that have aired edited portions of the tape
have said it depicts the girl and another woman having sex, with
Lowe directing them off camera. The stations also say the tape
contains scenes of the actor and a male companion having sex with a
third woman.
   Lowe's public relations firm issued a statement late Tuesday
that Lowe ``will have no comment until the matter is resolved.''

   Lawmakers resumed their battle today over
whether the government should spend an additional $822 million this
year to combat drug traffickers and provide $1.2 billion for
veterans programs.
   On a 219-201 vote, majority Democrats in the House overcame a
procedural effort by Republicans to block consideration of the
spending bill and the chamber began considering the spending
proposal.
   The House debated the issues nearly a month after a $4.7 billion
domestic spending bill that contained money for anti-drug and
veterans program failed to clear the chamber s
considered it too costly.
   Now, the House will have another crack at the proposals, which
have been altebecause lawmakerred slightly in form but have retained their
propensity for attracting controversy.
   A spat between the House and Senate over the veterans spending
appeared likely to drag on. House members from both parties and

   The top army command published a letter Wednesday
strongly supporting conservative Premier Li Peng, who is locked in
a bitter battle for power with rival factions opposing his
crackdown on student protesters.
   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told diplomats a meeting of the
ruling Communist Party's policy-making Politburo would be called
Thursday or Friday, perhaps signaling the behind-the-scenes power
struggle between Li and Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang was
coming to a head.
   Wan Li, head of China's parliament, cut short a visit to the
United States and flew home Wednesday for what he said were
``health reasons.'' But U.S. officials thought he was hurrying back
to demand Li's ouster.
   China's political crisis was touched off by student protests for
a freer society and cleaner government that began in mid-April.
Tens of thousands of students remained in a tent city at Tiananmen
Square, the symbolic center of power in China, for a 12th day
Wednesday to press the demands.
   Protest marches continued throughout the nation, with
demonstrations reported Wednesday in Shanghai and Changsha, the
capital of Hunan province.
   Li declared martial law in Beijing on Saturday to restore order
to the city where more than 1 million residents have demonstrated
in support of the students.
   The crackdown, apparently made with the approval of senior
leader Deng Xiaoping, triggered widespread calls for Li's ouster.
   Troops deployed on the outskirts of Beijing since Friday were
prevented from moving on the square by throngs of people who
surrounded the convoys and built street barricades. The crowds
pleaded with the soldiers not to attack and they retreated into
barracks, leading to speculation that Li could not control the
military.
   However, the army Headquarters of General Staff and General
Political Department published a letter Wednesday in the military
newspaper strongly supporting Li's hard-line position against the
students.
   The letter was dated Monday, the same day more than 100 senior
army officers called for an end to martial law, and it indicated an
apparent split in the military.
   ``In this serious political struggle that affects the future
fate of the nation ... the troops will face every kind of
difficulty and test in their task of ending the disturbance and
restoring normal order,'' the letter said.
   It urged the troops to study a tough speech Li made Friday and
an April 26 People's Daily editorial criticizing the students, in
order to ``fully understand the nature of this struggle and the
mission of enforcing martial law.''
   ``A extreme minority of people are fanning the flames, creating
turmoil, with the goal of negating the leadership of the Chinese
Communist Party and the socialist system,'' it said. ``In the face
of this great struggle between truth and falsehood, we must
maintain a clear mind.''
   Widespread military support of the crackdown was reported by the
official Xinhua News Agency. It said six of seven army commands,
the air force and navy approved. Only the Beijing command was not
mentioned.
   The official China News Service reported 26 of 31 provinces
announced support for the government's decision to maintain social
order in Beijing by calling in troops.
   The 3.2 million-member People's Liberation Army is likely to be
crucial in resolving the ongoing political standoff. The
grassroots-style military played a key role in the revolution led
by Mao Tse-tung that created communist China, and it also was used
in previous power struggles, most recently in the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution.
   Contradictory rumors continued to swirl about the fate of
China's top leaders. Zhao was reported to receive backing from Hu
Qili, a member of the five-person Politburo Standing Committee in
charge of propaganda, and Ba Jin, the country's most famous living
writer.
   Adding an ominous note was China's decision to cut off for a
second time satellite transmissions by Western TV networks.
   Western broadcasters were told their ability to transmit from
China ended as of midnight Wednesday (11 a.m. EDT Wednesday). An
earlier ban on transmitting videotape was lifted the day before.
   President Bush called on Beijing to stop jamming Voice of
America radio and refrain from violence against protesters. Bush,
who met Tuesday with Wan, also expressed his commitment to strong
U.S.-China relations, and the two discussed the recent Soviet-Sino
summit, the White House said.
   Although Tiananmen remained the focus of the protest, many of
the students from Beijing University who began the sit-in at the
square May 13 have returned to school to do organizational work.
   A large proportion of the students now in Tiananmen have arrived
from out of town to be at the center of the historic pro-democracy
movement.
   ``I have come to Beijing to take part in a great revolution,''
said Ji Xiujie, a 20-year-old university junior from Sichuan
province.
   The fifth day of martial law passed with life returning to
normal in the capital. Fewer barricades were up to snarl traffic
after most troops withdrew from street deployment Monday night.
   Xinhua reported 172 of 174 Beijing bus routes were in operation
by Wednesday morning. Subway service also resumed. Main shopping
streets were crowded and markets were well-stocked with food and
daily items.

   The House ethics committee today took a
``fresh look'' at charges against House Speaker Jim Wright, but the
panel's chairman said he didn't know whether any minds were changed
by arguments advanced a day earlier by Wright's lawyer.
   The committee held a morning session lasting two hours and
agreed to meet again later in the day, although there was no word
on when a vote would be taken on whether to proceed with the two
main allegations against the embattled speaker.
   Wright insisted he wasn't thinking of relinquishing his office,
even temporarily, no matter what the committee decided.
   But the speaker met with his lawyer-adviser, Clark Clifford, and
ethics committee attorneys met with another member of Wright's
legal team, fueling speculation that a deal was being discussed
that could involve a change at the very top of the House leadership.
   Wright personally proclaimed his innocence Tuesday night. At the
same time, he spoke about the possibility of losing his job,
telling reporters that if he became politically crippled he
``wouldn't want to be speaker.''
   Some of Wright's fellow Democrats have said that the speaker
should give up his leadership post if he unable to clear his name
swiftly on charges he engaged in financial dealings that violated
House rules.
   Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., the ethics committee chairman, told
reporters this morning as the closed-door meeting began that
members would take ``a fresh look'' at the charges it brought
against the speaker, in the wake of arguments presented at the
hearing Tuesday.
   ``I don't know if any minds were changed yesterday,'' Dixon
said. He also declined to predict when the committee might rule on
Wright's motion to dismiss charges against him.
   The two most serious groups of allegations contend that the
Texas Democrat used bulk sales of his book repeatedly to evade
rules limiting outside income and that he improperly took gifts
from a developer friend who had a direct interest in legislation.
   Wright has discussed the possibility of resigning before he
raised the issue Tuesday night, but his latest comments came with
his situation at an especially critical point.
   Pressure is mounting on his Democratic colleagues, who are torn
between loyalty to the speaker and concern that his political
troubles may be unresolvable.
   ``The political pressure is so intense that until this matter is
resolved the House of Representatives is paralyzed,'' said Rep.
Bill Richardson, D-N.M.
   The ethics panel, in its rare televised session Tuesday, heard
arguments from lawyers representing the speaker and from the team
of investigators whose report led to 69 allegations that Wright
violated House rules.
   The speaker's lawyer, Stephen Susman, argued that the committee
was stretching House rules in charging the speaker. Special outside
counsel Richard J. Phelan countered that ethics should not be
judged on narrow legalisms.
   Susman said today on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' he believes
Wright can prevail ``if he gets his day in court, if he can get on
the witness stand and put Mrs. Wright on the witness stand to
testify what she did to earn her keep.
   ``Whether he's politically a dead man or not I don't know,''
Susman said, but added that he sensed a ``feeling in Congress and
the American public that `wait a second. we're going a little too
fast here. Maybe we shouldn't be putting Jim Wright on this
railroad.'''
   Normally, dismissal motions such as Wright's are a routine part
of a case. However, House Democrats have grown increasingly
uncomfortable with the speaker's situation and some have suggested
that he must turn things around now or he should step down.
   ``He needs a victory. That's clear. Only by succeeding on one of
the charges can House members and the public take another look at
the entire case,'' said Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., a member of
Wright's defense team.
   Lawmakers will be reading the committee's decision like tea
leaves to determine the speaker's future.
   Susman said he might consider a 6-6 tie within the committee on
one of the charges as a victory. That would not dismiss a charge,
but it could mean there is no majority within the committee for
moving it to the next step in its process _ a trial-like
disciplinary hearing where Wright himself might testify.
   If the committee held that hearing, it would then make a report
to the full House, possibly recommending punishment.
   Rep. Jim Slattery of Kansas, a possible gubernatorial candidate
who has come under attack from Republicans who portray him as a
Wright ally, issued a statement Tuesday seeking to distance himself
from the troubled speaker.
   ``If the speaker is not exonerated by the ethics panel and if
the ethics committee concludes that Speaker Wright has violated
House rules, then I think he should resign.''
   During Tuesday's hearing, members of the committee discussed the
political angst that's come from their work.
   Rep. Charles Pashayan of California, a Republican member, said
he was ``disheartened'' that some lawmakers were prejudging the
case.
   ``It is the duty of Jim Wright as a member of Congress ... to
come before this committee and present himself,'' he said,
promising to take a ``fresh look'' before rendering a verdict.
   The speaker did not attend the arguments but his wife Betty did.
   Wright spoke to reporters briefly as he left the Capitol, and
said he was optimistic.
   ``I think we clearly had the better side of the legal
argument,'' he said, accusing Phelan of ``distorting facts.''
   Asked whether he believed he could survive as speaker, he said,
``That remains to be seen. ... If I can't be not just a respectable
speaker, but an effective speaker, then I wouldn't want to be
speaker.
   ``I want to be an effective person in America, and I've had that
privilege. Most of all I want to protect my good name and that of
my wife and my colleagues,'' he said, referring to Phelan's
contention that one of the gifts to Wright was a no-work job for
his wife.
   Torricelli closed out the speaker's arguments before the
committee Tuesday, saying the ethics panel has succeeded even if
Wright is not found guilty.
   ``If our work is to convince the American people of its
integrity and its honesty, we will not serve that purpose by taking
the life of one man, his career, his place in history, and throwing
it overboard as just so much excess baggage,'' he said. ``You've
done your duty. You've made the powerful accountable.''

   A dispatcher jotted down the wrong
telephone number when a terrified woman called 911 to report a
break-in, prompting police to send a patrol car to the wrong town
while the woman was being raped, authorities said.
   Police also revealed Tuesday that the woman spent several
chilling minutes on the phone with emergency dispatchers while the
rapist listened and brandished a knife.
   The woman had called to report a prowler early Sunday morning,
but the intruder burst into her home in mid-call. She then
pretended to be talking to her mother while trying to convey
information to the dispatcher.
   When the dispatcher asked for a phone number, the victim
``rattled it off, saying something like, `Oh, you know my number,
Mother, it's ...,''' Midvale police Capt. Dan Pearson said.
   However, the dispatcher copied down the number incorrectly. And
when she read it back to the victim for confirmation, the victim
affirmed it was correct.
   Moments later, the victim hung up.
   The incorrect phone number corresponded to an address in Sandy,
about two miles northwest of Midvale, and two police officers were
dispatched. When they found nothing amiss at the Sandy address,
they reported the call to be unfounded and no further action was
taken.
   An hour and a half later, the rapist left the victim and she
phoned again for police assistance. Police found her home the
second time.
   The victim was able to get a vehicle license number and a
33-year-old man was arrested Sunday and booked into the Salt Lake
County Jail.
   Dale Floyd Garrett of Kearns was charged Tuesday with aggravated
rape, aggravated burglary and aggravated kidnapping. Bail was set
at $50,000.
   The incident occurred during the transition to an enhanced 911
system in the Salt Lake City area. Sandy and Midvale are Salt Lake
suburbs.
   Under the new system, Pearson said, the possibility of similar
mistakes occurring will be virtually eliminated because a caller's
telephone number and address will automatically appear on a
dispatcher's computer screen.
   Under the old system, calls have been lost and numbers garbeled
``time and time again,'' Pearson said. ``That's why we pushed for
the new system.''

<HEAD>Auditors Criticize Energy Department Plan For New Military Reactors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department gave Congress ``improper
and unrealistic'' estimates of the cost of building new military
reactors in South Carolina and Idaho, federal auditors told a House
panel Wednesday.
   Officials of the General Accounting Office also said the
department had understated the time it would take to complete the
reactors, which the Bush administration says can be in operation
within 10 years for $6.8 billion.
   In testimony before a special panel of the House Armed Services
Committee, J. Dexter Peach, the GAO's assistant comptroller
general, raised doubts about other key aspects of the
administration's plan, which was announced last August. The
administration is seeking $300 million in next year's budget for
design work.
   The reactors would produce tritium, a radioactive gas used to
make nuclear warheads.
   One reactor is to be built at the department's Savannah River
Site, near Aiken, S.C., and the other would be new at the Idaho
National Engineering Laboratory, near Idaho Falls. The department
wants them in production by 1998 as replacements for three
35-year-old Savannah River reactors which have been shut down for
repairs.
   Peach said recent breakdowns at the existing Savannah River
reactors, which are the nation's only source of tritium, make the
need for new reactors ``more acute,'' but he raised doubts about
the new technology to be used at the new plants.
   ``There is some high risk associated with getting the technology
to work,'' he said.
   Peach also questioned the Energy Department's cost calculations
for the 18 different options it considered. He said the department
had taken cost estimates for full-sized reactors and ``scaled them
down'' for use in figuring the cost of smaller reactors.
   ``In our judgment, DOE's scaling assumptions were not realistic
and resulted in improper and unrealistic cost estimates for the
various options,'' Peach said.
   Peach's public remarks were less harsh than the language used in
private reports to the panel's members and its staff, according to
sources who asked not to be identified.
   These sources said panel members were told in private briefings
by GAO officials who are working on the agency's review of the new
reactor program that the Energy Department had ``misinformed'' the
Congress and was guilty of ``manipulation'' of figures used in
calculating the construction cost and timetable.
   The GAO review is not yet complete, and no official report has
been published.
   When asked about the accusations made by other GAO officials,
Peach did not disavow the charges but said his main concern was
that the Energy Department had not yet provided Congress with
enough information to make a decision on the plan's merits.
   A department official acknowledged to the panel that it could
take 1{ years longer than the 10-year estimate offered to Congress
for getting the new reactors running.
   The GAO says it would take at least 12{ years to get a
heavy-water reactor into production at Savannah River and 16 years
to begin tritium output at a modular high-temperature gas-cooled
reactor proposed for the Idaho site. It disputed the department's
$6.8 billion cost estimate for the two reactors but gave no
estimate of its own.
   The agency said a shorter and less costly alternative would be
to convert the partially completed WNP1 commercial nuclear plant at
the Hanford Reservation, near Richland, Wash., to tritium
production. This could be done in seven years for $2.2 billion.
   Ronald W. Cochran, acting director of the department's new
reactor program, said he could give no firm cost estimates for the
proposed reactors until design work is finished next year.
   Cochran also said Energy Secretary James D. Watkins was leaving
open the possibility of converting the WNP1 reactor to tritium
production but is concerned about public and congressional
opposition.

   Buses and subways were running Wednesday and a
line formed once again outside Kentucky Fried Chicken, a sign that
pro-democracy protests have not brought everyday life to a halt in
the capital.
   But residents said the upheaval had changed their level of
awareness and interest in current events.
   As one 33-year-old shopper put it, daily life in Beijing
continues much as it did before martial law was imposed Friday, but
``the people aren't the same.''
   The Beijing International School, attended by most children from
the English-speaking foreign community in Beijing, announced it
would resume classes Thursday.
   School was called off a week ago because roadblocks set up by
citizens trying to keep troops out of the city created traffic
problems hazardous to children.
   On Wednesday, most blockades were down and traffic appeared near
normal. The official Xinhua News Agency reported 172 of 174 Beijing
bus routes were in operation. The subway also returned to normal
service.
   The blockades _ made of buses, road dividers, garbage cans and
trucks _ brought public transportation to a virtual halt for three
days. Many people relied on bicycles to get around, but others
found it impossible to go to work.
   The fashionable shopping street Wangfujing, just a few blocks
east of Tiananmen Square _ the center of the protests _ was crowded
with buses, street cars and shoppers.
   Department store shelves were full and stands were brimming with
lunch boxes, roasted Beijing duck, popsicles and other popular food.
   ``The supplies of rice, oil, sugar and other things has been
normal,'' said a 65-year-old Agriculture Engineering University
professor visiting Wangfujing.
   Earlier in the week, officials had warned of imminent shortages
of basic supplies if the roadblocks remained.
   Music blared from stores selling cassette tapes, while customers
shelled out $46 for medicinal deer tail at the Yong Ren Tang
Drugstore.
   At the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant on the southwest corner
of Tiananmen Square, about 30 people were lined up at the counter
at 11:30 a.m. An assistant manager said business was returning to
normal after sales dropped by about half during the height of the
demonstrations.
   A market about 2{ miles east of Tiananmen boasted hills of
cabbage and other vegetables, and a 31-year-old clerk insisted
prices had not gone up as a result of the upheaval.
   ``Before, I would just read the evening newspaper,'' said the
store clerk. ``But now I read the People's Daily, the Beijing Daily
and other papers'' for the latest developments.
   A retired worker said his interest has expanded beyond economic
news. ``Now I read the news about politics, the student movement
and the situation in other provinces,'' he said.

<HEAD>GAO and Pepper Reports Blast Private Long-Term Care for Elderly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private nursing home insurance is so poorly
regulated by states that federal rules may be necessary to protect
America's elderly from ripoffs, the General Accounting Office said
Wednesday.
   In a report prepared at the direction of 88-year-old Rep. Claude
Pepper, the GAO said many states allow insurers to sell policies
with less protection than recommended by model plans developed by
the national organization of state insurance commissioners.
   ``While such provisions can result in lower policy premiums,''
the report said, ``they can adversely affect policy holders by
decreasing the likelihood that needed services will be covered and
increasing the risk of policy terminations for reasons other than
non-payment of premiums.''
   Pepper, chairman of the health and long-term care subcommittee
of the House Select Committee on Aging, is hospitalized in serious
condition at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, which he entered more
than six weeks ago for treatment of an undisclosed stomach illness.
   The 88-year-old Florida Democrat issued through aides his own
report in conjunction with the GAO report.
   ``The GAO report underscores my subcommittee's findings that
long-term care insurance is simply not a good buy and adequate
consumer protections are not in place at the state or federal
level,'' said Pepper's statement. ``As currently designed, nursing
home policies offer seniors a false sense of security.''
   Pepper said private long-term care insurance can help fill gaps
in a yet-to-be developed Medicare-like federal nursing home
program, but should be banned from sale as primary coverage for
long-term care.
   ``In the absence of such a ban, only those private long-term
care insurance policies certified as meeting federal minimum
standards should be allowed to be sold,'' his statement said.
   Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., chairman of the Ways and Means health
subcommittee, has introduced a bill to establish such minimum
federal standards. The measure, patterned on model legislation
recommended by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
also would provide criminal sanctions against fraudulent sales
practices.
   The GAO report said only one-half of states have adopted
legislation to regulate long-term care insurance, and even those
``vary in the degree to which they meet NAIC's recommended minimum
standards.''
   ``To help assure that new policies provide at least a minimum
level of consumer protection, the Congress may want to consider the
desirability of enacting federal legislation,'' the GAO said.
   An estimated 1 million long-term policies are in effect now
compared to about 125,000 only two years ago.
   Long-term care expenditures, mostly for nursing home stays, are
expected to exceed $46 billion this year, with individuals paying
about half the total. Average yearly nursing home costs exceed
$25,000.

   Gov. George Deukmejian signed
legislation today restricting the sale and possession of assault
weapons in California, a first-in-the-nation law stemming from a
schoolyard massacre.
   The two bills signed by the Republican governor virtually ban
the sale of more than 50 specified semiautomatic assault rifles,
pistols and shotguns after Jan. 1 and sharply restrict their
possession.
   Deukmejian said at the signing ceremony that law enforcement
officers ``need all the help we can give.''
   One gun-owners group immediately attacked the governor's action,
vowing to mount a recall drive against him and Assemblyman Mike
Roos, author of one of the bills. ``Hundreds and thousands of gun
owners throughout this state have called or written to George
Deukmejian. Their message has been ignored,'' said Larry Kempton of
Victorville, president of the California Gun Rights Committee.
   Attempts to restrict such weapons had been blocked repeatedly by
the gun lobby, led by the National Rifle Association, until a
shooting rampage at a Stockton school four months ago left five
children and the gunman dead.
   The slayings by a deranged drifter carrying a semiautomatic
AK-47 rifle rallied the public support needed to push the measure
through.
   Under the legislation, people who owned the listed weapons
before June 1 may keep them by obtaining permits. Otherwise, the
guns can be possessed only with a special-needs permit, such as
those obtained by movie studios for machine guns.
   Possession would be a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in
jail and a $1,000 fine, or a felony, carrying up to three years in
prison. The bills would also increase the penalties for crimes in
which assault weapons are used.
   The bills would allow the attorney general to go into court to
add similar guns to the list.

<HEAD>President Calls For Western Unity in Face of Thaw</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The West German president called
Wednesday for unity within the NATO alliance and warned politicians
against letting the pursuit of votes sway policy.
   In an address marking the nation's 40th anniversary, President
Richard von Weizsaecker criticized a ``majority mandate'' style of
leadership in a reference apparently aimed at Chancellor Helmut
Kohl.
   Kohl is at the center of a dispute with NATO over the fate of
short-range nuclear weapons based on West German soil. Bonn has
insisted on immediate superpower talks to remove the short-range
missiles in defiance of the alliance's plan to upgrade the rockets.
   Kohl's position was seen to follow a general drift to the left
among West Germans, who believe recent improvements in East-West
relations warrant some relaxation of military policies. It was seen
as an attempt to reverse a major slide in popularity for Kohl's
conservative Christian Democratic Union.
   ``It is not high-handedness that is the greater danger, but
rather an attempt, in pursuit of votes, to simultaneously fulfill
too many wishes,'' Weizsaecker told politicians, diplomats and
celebrities attending the festivities.
   He called for unity within the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. The alliance begins a meeting Monday and the
short-range missile crisis will be high on the agenda.
   ``Under the conditions of the Cold War it was easy to be
united,'' Weizsaecker said of the alliance. ``It becomes more
uncomfortable when the world no longer gives clear information on
who is for us and who is against us.''
   Weizsaecker praised Soviet reforms and called for new thinking
in the West as well. He warned, however, that despite the warming
trend in East-West relations, it would be unthinkable to stray from
the alliance.
   ``We in West Germany are irrevocably embedded in the European
Community and the Atlantic Alliance,'' Weizsaecker said. ``A
superpower we are not, but neither are we the plaything of
another.''
   Parliament President Rita Suessmuth, who also addressed the
gathering in the flower-decked Beethoven Hall, said the continuing
division of Germany marred the celebrations.
   ``In spite of the gratitude we feel today, we cannot be
satisfied with the situation of a nation divided by walls and
barbed wire,'' Mrs. Suessmuth said. On Tuesday, the 69-year-old
Weizsaecker was re-elected to a second five-year term. In his
acceptance speech, he praised West German economic prowess but said
much work lies ahead.
   ``We have no ground for self-satisfaction,'' Weizsaecker said.
``We have not become angels under the Basic Law.''
   The Basic Law, adopted May 23, 1949, is the constitutional
foundation of West Germany and has won praise for guiding the
defeated nation from ruin to international respect.
   West Germany is the world's largest exporter and enjoys one of
the highest standards of living. But Weizsaecker suggested the
nation's way of life is threatened by resistance to social change.

<HEAD>Four-Year-Old Boy Dies Saving Brother</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANTON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 4-year-old boy died while saving his
infant brother from a fire in the family's mobile home, according
to the firefighters who found them.
   Richard Henry and 7-week-old Darrin Henry weren't breathing when
prisoners working as volunteer firefighters found the boys under a
bed while searching a smoke-filled back bedroom Tuesday at a
trailer park west of Canton, in central Mississippi, authorities
said.
   ``It appeared that the 4-year-old had put the infant under the
bed first,'' said Allen Nations, who trained as a firefighter and
emergency medical technician with the Canton Fire Department while
serving a 19-year sentence at Madison County Community Work Center
for drug convictions.
   Officials said Richard died from smoke inhalation. Darrin was
quickly revived but was in critical but stable condition today at a
Jackson hospital.
   ``They believe he's going to be all right,'' said Arthur Luckett
of Canton, the boy's uncle.
   Everette Adcock, who helped find the children under the bed,
said he had been taught in training that children often go under
beds or into closets to escape smoke.
   ``I felt under the bed and the first thing I felt was the
infant's head,'' said Adcock, who is serving a four-year sentence
for burglary. ``I feel like I did something right today.''
   A Fire Department spokesman said it would take several days to
determine the casuse of the blaze. No other injuries were reported.

   American pharmaceutical laboratories are
chalking up strong gains in use of biotechnology to develop new
drugs and appear to be maintaining their lead over the Japanese,
industry and government officials said Wednesday.
   Major targets of the effort aided by sophisticated genetic
engineering techniques include cancer and AIDS.
   ``Five years ago there were predictions that Japan would
overtake us in biotechnology by the end of the decade,'' said
Gerald J. Mossinghoff, president of the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association. ``That has not happened. There is
enormous vitality in today's biotechnology research and development
in the United States,'' he added.
   Mossinghoff said 70 genetically engineered drugs and vaccines
are currently in human clinical tests in this country, while 10
others on which clinical testing has been completed are at the Food
and Drug Administration for review before they can be marketed.
   He also said that of 182 biotechnology health care patents
issued in the United States last year, 155 had American owners _
far ahead of Japan with 15 patents and Western Europe with nine.
   Mossinghoff was joined at a news conference by Henry I. Miller,
a special assistant to FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young.
   Miller said a survey recently conducted by the FDA of Japanese
pharmaceutical research and development ``reveals that despite a
high level of activity in Japanese industry, the U.S. does, indeed,
appear to be ahead of its Japanese counterparts in new
biotechnology pharmaceuticals.''
   ``Japanese production of new drugs with biotechnology techniques
is robust, but the U.S. holds roughly a two to one lead in both
numbers of companies involved and numbers of products,'' the FDA
official said.
   Genetic engineering involves manipulating the genes that
determine the fundamental physical characteristics of an organism.
   A survey released by the industry association found that cancer
is still the main focus of pharmaceutical biotechnology research.
More than half _ 45 _ of the products involved in clinical tests or
undergoing FDA review are targeted at cancer or cancer-related
conditions.
   It also reported that 14 genetically engineered products _
almost twice as many as were listed in the association's first such
survey last July _ are being tested for AIDS or AIDS-related
illnesses.
   Mossinghoff said the association was concerned about efforts by
states to get involved in ``duplicative and unnecessary
regulation'' of biotechnology, despite the existence of ``a
comprehensive regulatory scheme at the federal level.''
   He said that in 1988, 10 state legislative measures were
introduced and three passed _ in Hawaii, Maine and Wisconsin.
   Currently, Mossinghoff said, a biotechnology-related bill is
awaiting the governor's action in Wisconsin while additional
measures are pending before legislators in Wisconsin, New Jersey,
New York, Oregon, Texas and Washington state.

<HEAD>Judge Bars D.C. from Enforcing City Curfew Law</HEAD>

   A federal judge on Wednesday barred the
District of Columbia from enforcing a juvenile-curfew law aimed at
curbing drug-related violence in the nation's capital.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Richey said the law which would keep
people below age 18 off the streets from 11 p.m to 6 a.m. violates
the constitutional rights of thousands of the city's juveniles. The
curfew would begin at midnight on Friday and Saturday.
   The Temporary Curfew Emergency Act of 1989 ``subjects the
district's juveniles to virtual house arrest each night'' and ``is
a bull in a china shop of constitutional values,'' said Richey.
   ``However laudable the objectives which motivated its adoption,
the act is invalid on its face and may not be enforced,'' he said
in a 35-page opinion. He said the law would ``unconstitutionally
burden'' the First Amendment and Fifth Amendment due process rights
of ``thousands of innocent juveniles.''
   ``We cannot throw the baby out with the bathwater in our efforts
to deal with the problems that beset us,'' he added.
   The curfew statute was signed April 14 by Mayor Marion Barry. It
contains exemptions from the curfew for teen-agers returning home
from work and those traveling with parents. There also would be
exceptions for youths returning home from school and
church-sanctioned functions.
   ``The act, even with its exemptions, prohibits every innocent
juvenile in the District of Columbia from moving about the city as
he or she pleases at night,'' said the judge. ``Every juvenile in
the District of Columbia would be arrested if he or she sought to
wander the monuments at night, or if he or she sought to gaze at
the stars from a public park.''
   The local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union obtained
a temporary restraining order April 20 against the law and the
district government agreed to an extension until the court reached
a final decision.
   The law ``was more of a response to political pressure than it
was a realistic approach to the problems,'' Arthur Spitzer, legal
director of the local ACLU chapter, said after the court decision.
The ACLU was representing a group of minors who would have been
affected by the curfew, several parents of minors and individuals
affiliated with religious organizations.
   Barry wasn't immediately available for comment on the ruling.
   The curfew would have been in effect for 90 days, and the mayor,
if satisfied with it, could have asked the city council that it be
continued.

   With songs like ``Smoke Is No Joke,'' and a skit
that turned the big bad wolf into a wheezing wimp, the first group
of first-graders graduated with honors Wednesday from a national
anti-smoking program.
   Seven-year-old Elizabeth Gomes, wearing a mortar board made of
red construction paper and a proud grin, promised she would never
be a smoker.
   ``If I smoke, I'll get sick,'' she said, noting that her father
smokes and she is trying to get him to stop.
   The ``Smoke-Free Class of 2000'' program started last fall in
28,000 schools with the aim of ensuring the 800,000 first-graders
are non-smokers through their high school graduations. It is
sponsored by the American Cancer Society, the American Heart
Association and the American Lung Association.
   The goal is to reach children before cigarette advertising does.
   Most smokers first try cigarettes between the ages of 12 and 14,
according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
   By the sixth grade, 7 percent of boys and girls call themselves
regular smokers, said Martha Wood of the state Department of Public
Health.
   Nearly 20 percent of American teen-agers smoke cigarettes,
according to NIDA. About half of the high school seniors who smoke
say they want to quit, but follow-up studies show 73 percent are
still daily smokers eight years later.
   ``As the age where kids begin to smoke gets lower and lower, we
want to begin the education process earlier,'' said Judy Gelman,
spokewoman for the American Lung Association of Massachusetts.
   On Wednesday, the 70 first-graders at the Joseph P. Tynan school
seemed to have heard the non-moking message.
   They staged a skit about a dozen little pigs and a wolf who's a
heavy smoker. The wolf threatens to huff and puff and blow their
house down, but coughs and wheezes instead.
   ``Who's afraid of the wolf that smokes? Not me!'' the children
sang.
   Before an audience of parents, teachers and kindergartners, who
will participate in the program next fall, the children also
performed a song called ``Smoke Is No Joke.''
   Among the lyrics: ``Smoking is dumb, real cool cats don't try
it; Smoking won't do a thing for you, real cool cats pass by it.''
   Each child was given a handshake and an honorary degree from
state Rep. Lucile Hicks, who sponsored a successful bill that
banned smoking on the floor of the Massachusetts House of
Representatives.
   The Tynan school was chosen for the model program because it is
ethnically mixed and has one of the largest first-grade classes in
Boston, but the smoking issue has a special significance in its
South Boston neighborhood.
   ``In surveys that have been done, there was a significantly
higher rate of heavy smoking, and smoking in general, in South
Boston,'' said Terry Lehman, executive director of the Lung
Association in Massachusetts.
   The teaching materials, which are being distributed free to
participating schools, tell first-graders that smoke is air
pollution. They also teach that other people's smoke makes eyes
water, and hair and clothing smell bad.
   The anti-smoking program is a five-day program of 20-minute
lessons designed to be part of an overall health curriculum.
   The Walt Disney Co. has agreed to produce the educational
materials for next year, as the inaugural program and the kids move
on to second grade, Gelman said.
   ``We hope through publicity that all schools will adopt it,''
Gelman said of the program, which reached about half of the
first-grade classrooms in the country during its first year.

<HEAD>US Calls Chinese News Restrictions Regrettable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said Wednesday China's
renewed restriction of news broadcasts transmitted by satellite
``is regrettable,'' and called for an end to the jamming of the
Voice of America and open access for journalists.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Chinese
authorities informed Western networks they would not be able to
transmit by satellite after 1 a.m., or noon Washington time on
Wednesday.
   ``It is regrettable,'' Ms. Tutwiler said of the satellite
restriction.
   The move ends the networks' ability to broadcast pictures
directly from China.
   Satellite transmissions had been banned after martial law went
into effect on Saturday. The news organizations were prevented from
using their own satellite installations to transmit their reports.
   But foreign broadcasters were allowed to transmit news reports
for a brief time on Tuesday on the satellite operated by the
Chinese television network, CCTV.
   ``The unimpeded reception of radio broadcasts and unrestricted
satellite transmissions are, in our view, among the elements of a
free press, and we hope they will be supported and sustained in
China,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   The spokeswoman reminded reporters that President Bush had urged
non-violence and restraint during his White House meeting on
Tuesday with Wan Li, the chairman of the Chinese People's Congress.
   She said the president ``urges that not only the satellite feeds
but the Voice of America not be jammed and that reporters be given
open access.''
   Many of the demonstrators have relied on foreign news radio
broadcasts for updates on events in their own country throughout
the five weeks of protests.
   The spokeswoman added that the State Department's warning that
American citizens delay travel to China is still in effect. The
department has also advised Americans in China to avoid the
demonstrations.
   She termed the situation in China ``tense ... but calm.''
   The U.S. Embassy has been in touch in with American businesses
in China ``to keep them appraised of the situation of what's going
on,'' but Ms. Tutwiler said she was unaware that anyone had been
advised to transfer personnel out of the country because of the
unrest.

<HEAD>Ten Years Later, Chicago Crash Still Worst Domestic Air Disaster</HEAD>

   A gleaming American Airlines DC-10 taxied down
the runway for takeoff 10 years ago Thursday, lifting off into a
nightmarish niche in U.S. aviation history.
   Flight 191 was over in seconds, the jetliner and its inhabitants
instantly reduced to scattered debris in what remains the nation's
worst air crash.
   The plane lost an engine on takeoff, banked sideways out of
control and slammed into a nearby field, exploding into a jet-fuel
inferno. All 258 passengers and 13 crew members died, as well as
two people on the ground.
   ``Just the sound of a jet _ it just brings it back every time I
hear a plane go by,'' said Raymond Devito of Mokena, who had driven
his girlfriend, Debra Ann Moruzi, 21, of Joliet, to O'Hare
International Airport.
   Ms. Moruzi and a girlfriend were booked onto Flight 191 to Los
Angeles, the first leg of an eagerly awaited trip to Hawaii. After
they boarded, Devito went to an observation deck to watch the
takeoff.
   As the plane moved down the runway, Devito noticed white smoke
coming from one engine. Once the plane was airborne, he saw flame
and black smoke along a wing.
   Then the plane was down in a column of black smoke, and Devito
was scrambling over fences and across runways to the site. Nothing
resembling a plane was left.
   ``To this day, it's something that's hard to comprehend, how a
big plane like that could disintegrate into little pieces,'' said
Devito, 34, a real estate salesman. ``I ... didn't see a sign of a
person, a piece of luggage, a magazine.
   ``Nobody had to tell me there were no survivors.''
   The field is green now, but Chicago Police Sgt. Kenneth J.
Burger, who was at a training facility nearby, can still find the
furrow plowed by the DC-10's left wing in the flight's chaotic
final seconds.
   ``I would never forget,'' said Burger.
   After the crash, he and other officers ``went through the smoke
and came out the other side and there was no plane,'' he said.
   More than 200 lawsuits were filed after the crash. American
Airlines and the plane's builder, McDonnell Douglas Corp., have
paid damages estimated at more than $70 million.
   The National Transportation Safety Board laid primary blame for
the crash on American, citing ``maintenance-induced damage'' _ a
10-inch crack in the engine mount _ that caused the left engine to
tear loose.
   At issue was American's practice of removing the engine and the
pylon that attached it to the plane as a unit, rather than in two
pieces.
   The board said the accident ``resulted directly from improper
and abusive maintenance practices.''
   The NTSB also criticized McDonnell Douglas' design as vulnerable
to maintenance damage.
   And it said the Federal Aviation Administration had been remiss
by not learning that a similar crack had recently been repaired in
a Continental Airlines DC-10.
   ``One thing we did do is get very specific about what has to be
reported to us and what doesn't,'' FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said
Wednesday from Washington.
   Elaine Bendell, a spokeswoman for McDonnell Douglas in Long
Beach, Calif., said no changes have been made in the DC-10 pylon
design, except for a shift to flathead rather than raised-head
bolts.
   Officials for Dallas-based American declined to comment. ``It's
a sensitive issue,'' spokesman Tom Stack said in Chicago. He added
that the airline would prefer to ``let the public record speak for
itself.''

   Police say the description they have of a
robbery suspect is the most thorough they've ever had, because the
victim had just measured the man for a suit before he was robbed.
   Philip D. Smith, 31, owner of a tailoring and design shop, was
bound and gagged with duct tape and slightly injured in Tuesday's
robbery.
   He told police his assailant was 5-foot-9 or 5-foot-10, about
165 or 170 pounds, 14{-inch neck, 18-to-19-inch shoulders, 39-inch
chest, waist 34 to 35, sleeves 25{ inches from the shoulder, and
41-inch hips.
   The description of a companion was not so thorough, just around
6-foot-4 and at least 275 pounds.
   After being measured for the suit, Smith said, the smaller man
pushed him into a back room and, with the help of his friend, bound
and gagged him after a struggle.
   The two then ransacked the rear of the shop, taking off with a
camera, a watch and $24 from the cash register, Smith told police.
He was freed after he managed to get the attention of the
storekeeper next door.
   Smith said he was given 13 stitches for a cut lip and suffered a
possible broken nose and several bruises.
   ``What killed me was that they were so nice'' while discussing
the suit, Smith said.

<HEAD>Reformers Hope to be Allowed Independence in New Parliament</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gestures from the Kremlin have given hope to
delegates of the new Soviet parliament that they will have an
independent voice in solving pressing economic and social problems
when its first session convenes Thursday.
   Early indications had been that Communist Party leaders intended
to direct the decisions of the parliament, known as the Congress of
People's Deputies, but they have been backing off lately.
   The leadership called a meeting Tuesday of its majority in the
congress, rousing fear that the program would be dictated. Instead,
the session was thrown open to non-party deputies and a free
discussion followed, said Yuri Andreyev, a member from Moscow.
   Andreyev, a construction engineer, described the meeting as a
rehearsal for similar outspoken sessions in the congress.
   ``There are no decisions required of all the deputies,'' he
said. ``This is very important.''
   Kremlin leaders also dropped earlier proposals for a party slate
to fill the 542 seats in a smaller working legislature to be
elected by the congress, said Andreyev and Marju Lauristin, a
deputy from Estonia.
   Vadim Medvedev, the party ideologist, said on state television
Tuesday night: ``I don't think we should limit any discussions. We
just have to live through them.''
   On Monday, a meeting of deputies from the Russian republic
rejected a partial slate of 147 names for the legislature submitted
by party leaders, said Sergei Stankevich of the Moscow Deputies
Club.
   Since no slate was offered at the Tuesday meeting of Communist
Party deputies from all 15 republics, the leadership appears to
have taken notice.
   As the opening session approached, reformers among the 2,250
members were busy looking for each other.
   Meetings were scheduled all over Moscow. Volunteers made copies
of the latest proposals and posted them.
   The Communist Party, the only legal political group for 70
years, is far better organized and enjoys such advantages as
copying machines in a country that banned them for decades because
of underground publishing.
   Although party members are an overwhelming majority in the new
congress, Mikhail S. Gorbachev's cautiously reformist leadership
cannot count on support from either the conservative wing or those
who want greater change.
   Ms. Lauristin said ``we were surprised that so many deputies
from Russia were so free in expressing their opinions'' at the
party meeting Tuesday. She is a middle-aged professor considered an
extremist by many Russians because she favors independence for
Estonia.
   Hundreds of deputies have arrived with with specific proposals
that range from a committee to oversee the KGB secret police to
sovereignty for Estonia and the other two Baltic republics, Latvia
and Lithuania.
   Many Soviet citizens frustrated by empty stores and unkept
promises to fill them have put their faith in the congress.
   Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, quoted one on Wednesday
as saying he hoped it would ``make our life, our country, such that
you can once again say without blushing, `I am a citizen of the
Soviet Union.'''
   Tass quoted Vitautas Ramanauskas, a Lithuanian deputy, as
saying: ``A fierce struggle against the bureaucratic system is
still ahead. If we do not crush it now, I see no way out of the
predicament tomorrow.''
   Technically, the congress has limited duties: electing the
president, presumably Gorbachev; approving a few top government
appointments, and electing a smaller, full-time Supreme Soviet from
its own members.
   It includes many reformers, however, who want the congress
itself to address major problems. Among them are human rights
activist Andrei Sakharov and Boris Yeltsin, the maverick former
Moscow party chief who got into trouble by pushing for faster
change.
   A poll reported in Wednesday's Moscow News said 89 percent of
1,100 city dwellers from around the country believed the congress
should discuss the economic, social and political situation.
   Under the official schedule, the congress has just two morning
sessions before the Supreme Soviet it elects convenes on Saturday.
The party has planned election of the president and Supreme Soviet
as the first order of business, followed by discussions.
   Reformers want discussions first, then the elections.
   ``We have to pick the Supreme Soviet deputies after we have seen
in the discussions who is who,'' or the new system will be no
better than the old rubber-stamp legislature, Andreyev said.
   He said a compromise agenda was being debated that would put
Gorbachev's election and speech at the beginning, followed by
discussions and election of the Supreme Soviet.

<HEAD>Fire In Shoshone Forest Has Officials Concerned About Fire Season</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CODY, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A unusual spring fire in a national forest
next to Yellowstone National Park, still recovering from last
year's huge fires, has forest officials nervous about this year's
fire outlook.
   The fire in the southern end of the Shoshone National Forest
only covered about a quarter-acre, forest fire officer Bernie
Spanogle said Tuesday.
   ``But normally you don't get something like that happening this
early,'' he said.
   The fire near Dubois, southeast of Yellowstone, so concerned
Shoshone officials that beginning next month rangers will monitor
fuel conditions in the southern end of the forest, he said.
   ``It could be a real problem area,'' Spanogle said. ``Once you
get fire in it, it could be hard to stop. ... We have a potential
of having some large fires down there.''
   Last summer, forest fires started in northwestern Wyoming in
late June and continued through the fall, charring more than 1
million acres in Yellowstone, Grand Teton National Park, and the
Shoshone and Bridger-Teton national forests.
   The conflagrations prompted the Interior Department last July to
abandon the ``let burn'' policy, which calls for most naturally
caused fires in the park to burn untended as long as they don't
threaten structures or people.
   Federal officials still are reviewing that policy and through
this fire season all blazes _ natural and man-caused _ in national
forests and parks will be attacked from the outset.
   Despite the relatively low fire danger conditions now being
reported in Wyoming forests, the long Memorial Day holiday weekend
kicks off the summer tourist season and rangers will be urging
campers to be careful with fires, said Spanogle.
   ``As it stands right now, we will have no (fire) restrictions on
the Shoshone National Forest, but I will sure urge that any campers
who have live fires (to) be very careful,'' he said.
   In the Bridger-Teton National Forest, spokesman Mark Van Every
said fire danger currently is low.
   ``Contrary to last summer, we're in pretty good shape ... We got
a pretty good snowpack this past winter,'' he said.
   In Yellowstone, officials say heavy winter snow and a moist
spring should produce a ``very, very lush'' early summer.

   The apartment building that 550 pounds
of dynamite couldn't destroy offered stiff resistance Wednesday to
a wrecking ball.
   Three families evacuated from their nearby homes before the
failed demolition attempts prepared to spend at least one more
night in a motel.
   A larger wrecking crane was brought in after the 10-story
Hartford Park housing project building's walls buckled, but did not
break, when a 2-ton wrecking ball slammed against them.
   The tower was battered but largely intact after two attempts
failed to bring it down Sunday.
   ``It's a hard building,'' said Tom Santanelli, a wrecking crane
operator. ``It's coming apart good, but I can't see what I'm
doing.''
   Santanelli said the job will take three weeks but the building
should be low enough that the three evacuated families can return
Thursday.
   Stephen J. O'Rourke, executive director of the Providence
Housing Authority, said the authority paid more than $400 to put
the families up for two nights at a downtown hotel before moving
them to a less luxurious motel in Johnston on Tuesday.
   O'Rourke said he told the owners of a delicatessen and a coin
laundry that have been closed by the demolition to file a claim for
lost business with the insurance company that covered David Evans,
the explosives expert who failed to raze the building.

<HEAD>New Gorbachev Arms Proposals Mounts Pressure On Bush Before NATO
Summit</HEAD>

   New arms control proposals by Mikhail S.
Gorbachev put pressure Wednesday on President Bush and 15 allied
leaders to come to terms with a series of eye-catching Soviet moves
to reduce nuclear and conventional arsenals.
   With a NATO summit meeting due to open Monday in Brussels, the
Soviet leader virtually accepted Western demands that ceilings be
set on troop levels in each East European country as well as on
Soviet forces overall.
   Bush administration officials said the Soviet leader had agreed
to negotiated ceilings on Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia, East
Germany, Hungary and Poland, and to an overall limitation on the
Red Army.
   That is, the officials said, Soviet forces could not exceed 35
percent to 40 percent of the combined strength of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.
   The two military alliances are in negotiations in Vienna over
reductions in tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear armories
across the expanse of Europe. The new Soviet proposals were
outlined on Tuesday in a closed meeting in the Austrian capital,
said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Soviet negotiators also reiterated Gorbachev's proposals for
drastic cutbacks in troops and in several weapons categories. The
Soviet president and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze had
given the figures to Secretary of State James A. Baker III in
Moscow two weeks ago.
   Bush, in a speech Wednesday at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in
New London, Conn., said, ``The Soviets are now being forthcoming
and we hope to achieve the reductions that we seek.''
   Referring to the specifics in the Soviet proposal, though, he
said: ``These reductions alone, even if implemented, are not enough
to eliminate the superiority the Soviet Union enjoys now.''
   Still, the moves by Gorbachev in response to long-standing U.S.
demands were welcome news _ even though they add to the task
confronting Bush and the other Western leaders in Brussels.
   The alliance already is divided over whether to negotiate
reductions in short-range nuclear missiles. West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl leads the countries pushing for U.S.-Soviet talks,
while Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher are the
strongest foes of negotiations over the issue.
   The United States and Britain argue that nuclear missiles are
necessary _ and must be made more menacing _ in order to deter
Soviet attack from a Warsaw Pact that holds an edge in manpower and
in some weapons categories.
   Gorbachev's latest moves, however, reinforce the opposing
argument that Soviet reductions are eroding any need for
ground-based Lance nuclear missiles as a deterrent.
   Presure has been building on NATO since Gorbachev announced late
last year the Soviets would withdraw 5,000 tanks and 50,000 troops
from Central and Eastern Europe and cut Soviet forces by 500,000
overall.
   In January, he said defense spending would be slashed 14.2
percent, although Soviet officials said later it was difficult to
calculate how much was being spent on armed forces.
   And two weeks ago he told Baker he would unilaterally withdraw
500 Soviet nuclear warheads from Eastern Europe.
   Bush, in his speech Wednesday, urged the Soviets to ``open the
ledgers'' and provide accurate military spending figures. He also
renewed his proposal for aerial inspections of troop concentrations.
   Last month, Roald Sagdeyev, a leading Russian rocket scientist
and prominent reformer, said the Kremlin would publish defense
figures and space budgets by the end of the year.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater sought to play down the
importance of the latest Soviet proposal, saying it was a response
to a plan proposed last March 9 by the United States and its NATO
allies.
   But Fitzwater said, ``The Soviets have provided details in a
meaningful way at the negotiating table. It is a serious proposal
and we look forward to the negotiations.''
   Bush's response was a holding action until the NATO summit
meeting. Soviet proposals for cuts in non-nuclear forces require a
response from the alliance itself, not the United States alone.
   Still, Bush signaled a shift in tone.
   ``The president felt he appeared too negative before, and he's
trying to appear more positive now,'' said his national security
adviser, Brent Scowcroft.

<HEAD>Progress In Male Contraceptive Being Made, Doctor Says</HEAD>

   Encouraging progress is being made on developing
a reversible birth-control method for men, the first non-permanent
male contraceptive since the condom was invented about 200 years
ago, a researcher says.
   Twenty-two Seattle-area men and their sexual partners are among
about 250 couples worldwide participating in a study in which the
men are injected with an anabolic steroid that shuts off sperm
production, Dr. C. Alvin Paulsen said at a news conference Tuesday.
   The purpose of the injectable contraceptive is to provide a
reversible, alternative method to vasectomy, and also to take some
of the burden of birth control off women, said Paulsen, a
University of Washington professor of medicine and a major
researcher in male contraception.
   The product, if successful, may be marketable in about 10 years,
he said. ``This is a drug-seeking, dose-seeking exercise,'' Paulsen
said of the human test program.
   The injections are a combination of the male hormone
testosterone and a compound that helps the hormone stay active in
the body for seven to 10 days. When enough of the drug is injected,
the brain senses it, signaling the testes to stop sperm production.
   The injections of the synthetic hormone testosterone enanthate
or TE are well below the steroid dosages that some athletes use,
Paulsen said.
   Dr. John McCracken senior scientist at the Worcester Foundation
for Experimental Biology in Shrewsbury, Mass., said Wednesday that
the male injectable contraceptive seems to be effective because
research so far indicates that TE does maintain male sexual drive.
The foundation is where the original female birth control pill was
formulated by Dr. Gregoy Pincus in 1960.
   ``The depression of male libido has been the problem in the past
with male contraceptives,'' McCracken said in a telephone interview.
   Dr. C. Wayne Bardin, director of the Center of Biomedical
Research in New York, said the study needed a much larger sample of
people to determine if the injections would be effective.
   Six of the Seattle participants have finished a year-long series
of injections without making their partners pregnant in that time.
   Researchers had hoped about half of the couples participating
worldwide would go a full year without a pregnancy. So far, about
three-fourths of the participants who have reached the full-year
stage, about 70 men in six countries, have gone without a
pregnancy, said Paulsen.
   After 16 weeks of weekly injections, those men who develop no
sperm are asked to discontinue all forms of contraception except
for the weekly injections. The weekly injections then are continued
for a year.
   Paulsen said TE cannot be taken orally because the liver would
destroy the drug's effectiveness. Other methods besides injections
have not been tested yet, he said.
   Paulsen said side effects of TE include a weight gain averaging
about six pounds and, in some cases, acne may occur in men who were
acne-prone in their younger years.
   The UW is one of nine institutions worldwide, and the only one
in the United States, working to develop an injectable male
contraceptive, Paulsen said. The research is sponsored by the World
Health Organization, the National Institutes of Health and U.S.
Agency for International Development's Contraceptive Research and
Development Center in Norfolk, Va.
   The nine other participating centers are in Australia, China,
Sweden, France and Scotland.

   New Yorkers may soon be able to donate money
to the homeless the same way they contribute to wildlife programs _
by checking a box on their state tax returns.
   The proposal before the legislature is patterned after the
state's ``Return a Gift to Wildlife'' tax check-off, which annually
raises $2 million for wildlife programs.
   ``I believe that New Yorkers are at least, if not more,
concerned for the homeless men, women and children who are
endangered species on city streets as they are for Kemp's ridley
sea turtle,'' said sponsor Sen. Frank Padavan.
   The turtle is an endangered species indigenous to the Long
Island Sound.
   Under the proposal, money raised would go to the state's
Homeless Housing and Assistance Program, which makes grants to
local governments and non-profit housing providers.

   Two dozen embassy wives ate an American Indian
lunch of quail, wild rice, cornbread and pumpkin cake Wednesday at
the Capitol, where Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell invited them to
enjoy the ``wonderful, rewarding experience'' of visiting an Indian
reservation.
   ``The Indian people are known for their hospitality,'' said
Campbell, a Colorado Democrat who is the only Indian member of
Congress.
   ``If you have time, go out and visit our brothers and sisters in
Indian country,'' he said, adding: ``You will have a wonderful,
rewarding experience.''
   A group of American Indian women wearing the traditional
clothing of Navajos, Choctaws, Kiowas, Seminoles, Payutes and other
tribes presided over the get-acquainted lunch for ambassadors'
wives from Afghanistan to Zaire, many of whom also wore their
native dress.
   The lunch was sponsored by the non-profit American Indian
Heritage Foundation, which provides emergency assistance to needy
Indians and promotes public awareness of native American culture.
   Campbell, whose father's ancestors were Northern Cheyenne from
Montana, said he knew little about his mother's family, which came
from Portugal's Azores Islands. Campbell warmly greeted the wife of
Portuguese ambassador Joao Eduardo M. Pereira Bastos, who said she
knew the little town where Campbell's maternal forebears once lived.
   The embassy wives applauded Rob ``Swift Arrow'' Rose, a young
North Carolina Cherokee who performed an intricate hoop dance, and
Dora Roanhorse, a Navajo from Chinle, Ariz., who is Miss Indian
U.S.A. She performed a ``swan dance'' which she said reflected
``the Indian philosophy of being in harmony with nature.''
   Campbell told the lunch guests that American Indians bear no
resemblance to the Hollywood stereotype of the warring ``noble
savage'' or the drunken bum. Like the peoples of foreign countries,
he said, ``we're all concerned about our children, our homes and
our livelihoods, and we're proud of our homelands.''
   Wil Rose, the foundation's chief executive officer, invited the
embassy wives to attend a major auction of American Indian arts and
crafts here in November to raise money for construction of an
Indian cultural and performing arts center in Washington.
   ``All the people of the world can benefit from exposure to the
values and diversity of American Indian culture,'' Rose said.

<HEAD>Dolphins' Illness Created By Stress From Crowds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three bottlenose dolphins that developed ulcers
shortly after arriving at the National Aquarium had something in
common with many of the tourists watching them: They didn't like
crowds.
   Kibby, Mimi and Aphrodite became ill from the stress of being
unable to escape the hordes of people lining their tank, a
researcher said Wednesday. They recovered within six months after
being sent home to Florida.
   Unfortunately, ``the farthest point they could get away to in
the tank was still within their `flight distance,''' the distance
to which they would flee from the crowds, if they could, said
Michael K. Stoskopf, chief of medicine at the aquarium from 1981 to
1988 and a professor of comparitive medicine at Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine.
   His study is awaiting publication by the Animal Welfare
Information Center of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   In July 1982, barely a year after the aquarium opened, the
dolphins were flown home to Grassy Key, Fla., where they have been
on exhibit at the Dolphin Research Center.
   The multimillion-dollar dolphin tank was never used for dolphins
again.
   But the lessons they taught scientists guided the selection of
beluga whales as the dolphins' replacements, and the manner in
which the belugas were moved from the wild to captivity, Stoskopf
said.
   ``We learned things about the animals that will help to make not
only their lives in captivity better, but may also make their lives
in the wild better,'' Stoskopf said.
   Stoskopf and his associates watched the dolphins' behaviors and
where they took place, looking for relationships between behavior
and possible stress factors in the tank.
   ``We looked at everything we thought could be stressful to them,
such as the configuration of the tank, temperature, being watched
by the public, light levels and noise from the pumps,'' he said.
   The results showed ``the real problem with the exhibit was the
people.''
   When the aquarium was crowded, almost 98 percent of the dophins'
activity was in parts of the tank away from people. As the number
of visitors increased, the animals began showing abnormal
``stereotypic'' behaviors.
   Crowds at the newly opened aquarium were three times what had
been expected, said Robert L. Jenkins, the aquarium's director of
operations and husbandry.
   ``The building was open until 2 a.m., and then it had to be
cleaned. The lights never went out,'' he said.
   The dolphins retreated as far as they could, but researchers
found that by fleeing from the crowds, the mammals congregated in a
spot where noise from the tank's pumps was loudest.
   For replacements, officials settled on beluga whales, arctic
mammals that are accustomed to very long or very short periods of
daylight.
   ``We also thought it would be better to acclimate the animals
slowly to a new home,'' Stoskopf said. The dolphins had been
brought to the aquarium too soon after being captured, with little
time to adjust to captivity or people.
   The belugas, Anore and Illamar, spent their first year in a
quiet tank at the New York Aquarium and were introduced slowly to
larger numbers of people. Today they ``seem to be very happy,''
Jenkins said. They were joined last summer by a third whale.

<HEAD>Bush: Gorbachev's Latest Proposal Good, but not Good Enough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Wednesday that
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's latest proposal to reduce
conventional arms in Europe could make the world safer but was not
enough to erase the Warsaw Pact's ``massive advantage'' over NATO.
   Bush, in a commencement address at the Coast Guard Academy, said
Gorbachev's offer confirms ``what we've known all along _ that
Soviet military power far exceeds the levels needed to defend the
legitimate security interests of the U.S.S.R.''
   Officials in Washington said Gorbachev on Tuesday proposed the
imposition of ceilings on Soviet forces stationed in Eastern Europe
and outlined possible reductions in Soviet conventional arms as
well.
   More broadly, Bush told the newly commissioned officers that,
internationally, he sees ``the ascendancy of the democratic idea.''
   The world, he said, is ``witnessing the end of an idea: the
final chapter of the communist experiment.
   ``Communism is now recognized, even by many within the communist
world itself, as a failed system, one that promised economic
prosperity but failed to deliver the goods, a system that built a
wall between the people and their political aspirations.''
   And, in some of his most pointed comments yet on the situation
in China, Bush took note of the pro-democracy demonstrators who
have jammed Beijing's Tiananmen Square for nearly two weeks and
said the United States ``will do all it can to encourage'' those
who ``are speaking the language of democracy and freedom.''
   But the bulk of Bush's speech dealt with relations with the
Soviet Union and the prospects for mutual arms reductions in
Europe, now the subject of negotiations between NATO and the Warsaw
Pact in Vienna.
   ``The Soviets are now being forthcoming, and we hope to achieve
the reductions that we seek,'' Bush said. But he challenged
Gorbachev to disclose accurate figures on Soviet military spending.
``Open the ledger,'' Bush said.
   Bush told the graduates that ``for more than 40 years, the
Warsaw Pact's massive advantage in conventional forces has cast a
shadow over Europe.''
   Now, he said, ``The unilateral reductions President Gorbachev
has promised give us hope that we can now redress that imbalance.
We welcome those steps because, if implemented, they will help to
reduce the threat of surprise attack.''
   But he reiterated the U.S. position that NATO must maintain a
strong force of European-based nuclear weapons to counter the
Warsaw Pact's conventional arms superiority.
   Earlier this month, Gorbachev proposed _ but the United States
rejected _ talks aimed at mutual reductions of European-based
nuclear weapons.
   Bush said it would be ``irresponsible to depend solely on
strategic (long-range) nuclear forces to deter conflict in Europe.''
   Bush leaves Friday for next week's 40th anniversary meeting of
leaders of NATO, with the future of the alliance's nuclear force an
still-unresolved point of contention between the United States and
West Germany.
   The Bonn government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl wants the Bush
administration to take the Soviets up on their request for talks on
short-range nuclear weapons and is also pushing to reverse plans to
modernize the arsenal of short-range nuclear weapons on German soil.
   The United States says the Soviets have such an advantage in
those weapons that cuts beyond what Gorbachev unveiled two weeks
ago must be made before talks can begin on mutual reductions.
   As for Gorbachev's newest proposal to reduce conventional arms,
Bush's advisers took a largely positive stance.
   ``We find this very promising,'' said spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater. ``These are major, major concessions that put them more
in line with the NATO proposal.''
   Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, said
Gorbachev had given Secretary of State James A. Baker III a general
outline of the Soviet proposals when the two met earlier this
month. Then, Scowcroft said, ``They were vague. Now they've put
more meat on it.''
   Also on Wednesday, the White House released the transcipt of an
interview between Bush and European journalists.
   In the interview, Bush said the massive protests in China and
political reform movements in other parts of the world show ``the
democratic way is on the march and it is not going to be stopped.''
   Still, the president cautioned, ``I'm old enough to remember
Hungary in 1956 and I don't want to be a catalyst for encouraging a
course of action that would inevitably lead to violence and
bloodshed.''
   In the New London speech, Bush said that ``never before has the
idea of freedom so captured the imaginations of men and women the
world over _ and never before has the hope of freedom beckoned so
many.
   ``Trade unionists in Warsaw. The people of Panama. Rulers
consulting the ruled in the Soviet Union. And even as we speak
today, the world is transfixed by the dramatic events in Tiananmen
Square.
   ``Everywhere those voices are speaking the language of democracy
and freedom. And we hear them. And the world hears them. And
America will do all it can to encourage them.''
   Bush, reflecting the fast-changing developments on the arms talk
front, made extensive revisions in his speech, both before and
after attending a banquet for White House photographers Tuesday
night and this morning as he flew here in a small Gulfstream jet.
   The last-minute revisions may have contributed to Bush's
stumbling over one passage, where he repeated the word ``security''
three times and finally told the audience, ``The text is going
crazy on this machine'' _ his prompter.

   Democratic congressional leaders, unable
themselves to convince President Bush to sign legislation raising
the minimum wage above what he has proposed, brought three low-wage
workers to Capitol Hill on Wednesday and gave them a shot at
changing the president's mind.
   ``Raise the minimum wage so we can live a little better and have
a little more,'' said Eula Malone of Atlanta, who said a custodial
company she works for has paid her the minimum wage for 18 years.
   ``We're not asking for you to give us anything,'' she said. ``We
want to work for it.''
   The unusual forum was hosted by the House Democratic Caucus,
which traditionally holds private meetings to plot strategy and
hear from people who would be affected by pending legislation.
Wednesday's session was opened to reporters as part of the
leadership's effort to pressure Bush to sign the measure.
   Bush has promised the bill that has cleared Congress, which
would raise the minimum wage from $3.35 an hour to $4.55 by October
1991, will be vetoed when it reaches his desk. The president
proposed a $4.25 hourly minimum wage by 1992.
   Democrats urging Bush to change his stance frequently remind the
president that the last time the minimum wage was increase was in
January 1981.
   Mrs. Malone put it more simply.
   ``We haven't had a raise since President Carter was in there,''
she said.
   Also at the forum was Verlie Reed, a receptionist at a
Philadelphia community center whose hourly pay jumped from $3.35 to
$3.70 because Pennsylvania increased its state minimum wage.
   ``We're still working on a poverty income,'' she said. ``I think
it's a disgrace, it's not right and something needs to be done.''
   House Democratic leaders, who applauded each of the three
witnesses at the hearing, also fired a few salvos at Bush.
   ``This scandalous neglect of hard-working American workers has
contributed to the rise of a new underclass in our society _ the
working poor and working homeless,'' said Rep. Bill Gray, D-Pa.,
the caucus chairman.
   ``We're trying to do justice to millions of American workers who
depend on the minimum wage,'' added House Majority Leader Thomas
Foley of Washington.

<TEXT>
   Arab leaders remained bitterly
divided Wednesday over a proposal to send a joint police force to
Beirut to replace Syrian troops that support Moslem forces in
Lebanon's 14-year civil war.
   Despite that rift, and another argument over the Palestine
Liberation Organization, the summit of the 22-nation Arab League
appeared significantly to smooth relations between some of the Arab
world's most bitter foes.
   President George Bush sent a message to Morocco's King Hassan
II, the conference chairman, expressing hope the summit would
``strengthen the possibility'' of an Arab-Israeli peace settlement.
   Bush asked Arab leaders to support the peace initiatives of both
Israel and PLO leader Yasser Arafat.
   He also stressed U.S. support for league efforts to halt the
fighting in Lebanon.
   The summit convened Tuesday to welcome Egypt back to the Arab
fold after a 10-year ostracism for making peace with Israel. It was
to end Wednesday, but Moroccan delegates said the dispute over
Lebanon threatened to delay the closing by 24 hours.
   Leaders met behind closed doors and at private meetings Tuesday
and Wednesday but made no progress. The summit convened for only
five minutes before it adjourned.
   Another session for heads of delegations only was set for early
evening.
   Lebanon's civil war had been dormant for nearly four years when
fighting erupted March 8 between Syrian-backed Moslem forces and
Christians supported by Iraq.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak moved quickly to restore his
country's leading role in Arab politics by offering a proposal on
Lebanon jointly with King Hussein of Jordan.
   They proposed that all 15,000 Syrian soldiers withdraw from the
Moslem sector of the Lebanese capital, to be replaced by a joint
Arab police force that also would deploy in Beirut's Christian
sector, conference sources said on condition of anonymity. About
25,000 Syrian soldiers police the rest of Lebanon.
   They suggested the force be drawn from all Arab League member
states, except traditional rivals Syria and Iraq.
   ``There is no talk about the size of the force yet. First, they
(Syria and Iraq) must agree to the idea,'' said one source.
   Other sources said the reluctance of some Arab League members to
send troops to Lebanon could undermine the plan.
   Arab leaders also had planned to discuss recent developments
concerning the PLO. Arafat, like Bush, wants the Arabs to back his
peace overtures, including his recent recognition of the state of
Israel.
   Bush's message said: ``The Casablanca summit offers the Arab
League the possiblity of strengthening the prospectives of a peace
settlement by approving the measures taken by the leader of the PLO
... by recognizing Israel's right to exist and renouncing terrorism
unequivocally.''
   It also asked the Arabs not to hinder Israel's plan for
elections in the occupied territories.
   ``The summit can give encouragement to the elections,'' Bush
said. ``Or, if it cannot achieve this, it can at least avoid
measures which would only add to the obstacles which we face
already.''
   Syria, Arafat's main Arab foe, is expected to express
reservations over the PLO leader's peace moves, conference sources
said.
   Hassan invited some quarreling leaders to a private meeting at
his palace late Tuesday. Among those he persuaded to shake hands
were Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi and Saddam Hussein of Iraq,
Syrian President Hafez Assad and Saddam, and everyone with Mubarak.
   Gadhafi had threatened a boycott because of Mubarak's presence.
But he surprised reporters and observers Wednesday by arriving with
the Egyptian leader and Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid in
Mubarak's limousine.
   An Algerian delegate, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Bendjedid reconciled Mubarak and Gadhafi during a 3{-hour meeting.

<HEAD>House Panel Endorse Federal Regulation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House panel Wednesday endorsed a bill
allowing federal regulation of the prices charged an increasingly
confused and angry traveling public by the proliferation of new
phone companies for operator services.
   The bill, approved by the Energy and Commerce telecommunications
and finance subcommittee on a voice vote, would require the
operator-services companies to clearly identify themselves, provide
rates to callers, not charge for incompleted calls and ensure that
credit-card callers are billed at their long-distance companies'
rates if they so choose.
   The bill was amended to force such companies to file a list of
their prices with the Federal Communications Commission. If the FCC
finds a company's rates to be unreasonable, the company then must
justify their charges.
   The bill also would require the FCC to determine whether the
operator-services industry as a whole is charging just and
reasonable rates. If not, the FCC would decide how to establish
rate regulation for the industry.
   The bill now goes to the full Energy and Commerce Committee,
where it is expected to pass and be sent to the full House.
   Operator-services companies typically lease long-distance lines
from the major long-distance carriers and then contract with such
operations as airports, motels, hospitals and schools to provide
service. In most cases, the companies pay airports and other
customer a commission on each call handled from their phones.
   The FCC has received 2,000 complaints about operator-services
companies, mostly regarding prices, which sometimes can be two or
three times the rates charged by the long-distance carriers
themselves.
   But the FCC in February said there was not enough evidence that
companies were charging excessively and instead told the companies
to post their names and telephone numbers on pay phones, stop
blocking callers from using the long-distance carrier of their
choice and stop billing customers from cities other than where the
calls are made.
   The House bill includes similar provisions. But Rep. Matthew
Rinaldo, R-N.J., said the bill also orders the pricing
investigation because of the FCC's ``wholly inadequate'' response
to the raft of complaints.
   The subcommittee chairman, Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said the
bill was a response to ``a litany'' of complaints from consumers
``who innocently picked up pay phones and made calls which resulted
in charges 250 percent higher than their regular long-distance
rates.''
   ``For the first time in its 100-year history the public pay
phone has become an instrument of confusion and frustration,''
Markey added. ``A constituent recently told me she was afraid to
use her local phone booth because she did not know what to expect
in her next month's phone bill. This morning's action should end
the fear and the guesswork.''

<HEAD>Millions of Idled Crop Acres Being Put Back to Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers are putting millions of idled crop
acres back to work this year, according to new signup figures for
1989 commodity programs announced Wednesday by the Agriculture
Department.
   Under this year's programs, farmers will idle 29.2 million
acres, little more than half of the 54.2 million acres contracted
to be taken from crop production under the 1988 programs, officials
said.
   Despite the decline from last year, the prospective 1989 idled
acreage would represent an area larger than the state of
Pennsylvania.
   To be eligible for federal price support and related benefits,
farmers are required to take a percentage of their base acres from
crop production and put the land in conservation uses that help
protect the soil.
   Last year's drought cut production severely, triggering higher
grain prices and a drain on U.S. stockpiles. The department eased
idling requirements for this year's crops in an effort to rebuild
inventories.
   The idled or ``diverted'' acres signed up for 1989 included:
corn, 10 million acres, down from 28 million signed up for 1988;
sorghum, 2.8 million acres, down from 4.1 million; barley, 2.1
million acres, down from 2.9 million; and oats, 300,000 acres,
unchanged.
   In all, feed grains acres signed up to be idled under the 1989
programs totaled 15.2 million acres, down from 28.2 million
contracted last year.
   Additionally, wheat farmers signed up to idle 9.5 million acres
this year, compared with 22.8 million acres in 1988; cotton, 3.4
million acres, up from 2.1 million; and rice, 1.1 million acres,
unchanged.
   The USDA report said farmers enrolled 168.1 million acres of
feed grain, wheat, cotton and rice in the 1989 program, which
represented 76.3 percent of the 220.3 million acres in the national
base area for those crops. The idled acres are part of the 168.1
million acres that were enrolled.
   Last year's gross enrollment was 187.8 million acres, which
represented 83.4 per cent of the 1988 national base of 225.2
million acres.

<HEAD>Farmland Prices Rising for Third Consecutive Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices of farmland nationally are going up for
the third consecutive year and may rise more than many analysts
were saying a few months ago, an Agriculture Department report
showed Wednesday.
   The farmland forecast was included briefly in a report on
agricultural income and finance by the department's Economic
Research Service. It said values ``continue to rise and could
advance 7 percent to 9 percent this year.''
   A tentative forecast made last December called for a farmland
value gain this year of around 2 percent to 4 percent.
   The agency announced last month that farmland values, including
buildings, rose nationally in 1988 by 6 percent to an average of
$597 per acre, the second consecutive increase. Farmland prices
sank to a 19-year low of $548 per acre in 1986 before turning up in
1987.
   ``With real estate now accounting for about three-quarters of
the farm sector's total assets, movements in land values
dramatically affect net worth,'' the report said. ``Coupled with
stable debt, higher land values could add $40 billion to the wealth
of the farm sector.''

   On the night he vanished, film producer Roy
Radin stepped into a limousine with a drug dealer after arranging
for actor Demond Wilson to follow him with a gun, Radin's former
assistant testified Wednesday.
   But the signals for the actor to follow an apparently frightened
Radin got mixed up at the last minute, Radin's assistant, Jonathan
Lawson, testified in a hearing on the so-called ``Cotton Club
murder.''
   Lawson said he saw another, unidentified car take off in pursuit
of the limousine, and never saw Radin again.
   Lawson testified at a preliminary hearing in Municipal Court to
determine if the drug dealer, Karen DeLayne Greenberger, and three
men should stand trial for the 1983 kidnapping and murder of Radin.
   Prosecutors allege Radin was killed because of a disagreement
over how to split anticipated profits from the movie ``The Cotton
Club'' with Ms. Greenberger and former Paramount Pictures
production chief Robert Evans.
   Lawson said that on the last night of Radin's life, the
33-year-old New York businessman had a series of arguments with
Mrs. Greenberger, who was known then as Laynie Jacobs. He said they
argued over missing cocaine and over Miss Jacobs' share in profits
from ``Cotton Club.''
   She had introduced Radin to Evans and the two were negotiatng a
deal for the movie about the legendary Harlem nightspot of the
1930s.
   ``There was a discussion of her remaining as part of the `Cotton
Club' deal, and she expected to get her ($50,000) finder's fee for
making the introduction,'' Lawson testified.
   ``Roy said something about, `Yes, if it all goes through.'''
   Lawson said he had planned to drive Radin and Ms. Jacobs to La
Scala restaurant in Beverly Hills for dinner. Wilson, formerly the
star of television's ``Sanford and Son,'' was waiting outside with
a gun, ready to follow Radin's car.
   But Ms. Jacobs arrived in a limousine and insisted Radin ride
with her to the restaurant, Lawson testified. He said he walked
outside and tried to signal Wilson, but was unsure that Wilson saw
the signal.
   ``As I turned, lights came on on a car parked up from the hotel.
It pulled away from the hotel and pulled into the traffic lane the
limousine was in,'' Lawson testified.
   That was the last time Lawson saw Radin, whose bullet-riddled
body was found a month later in a dry riverbed 65 miles north of
Los Angeles.
   Another witness has said the plan was for Mrs. Greenberger to
lure Radin into the limousine, stop at some point, get out and let
two men who were following replace her in the car.
   Prosecutors allege that Mrs. Greenberger hatched the murder
conspiracy along with three former bodyguards of Hustler magazine
publisher Larry Flynt. They are William Molony Mentzer, Alex Lamota
Marti and Robert Ulmer Lowe. Lowe is fighting extradition in
Maryland.

   The Agriculture Department predicted Wednesday
that barnyard animals in the 21st century may include genetically
engineered livestock that are naturally resistant to disease.
   Beef cattle destined for consumer dinner tables may be able to
thrive on low-grade crop residues and fibrous plants that are
barely digestible now. And chickens may be grown in closed,
disease-free environments.
   The predictions are part of a project by the department's
Agricultural Research Service to highlight some of the possible
changes that agency scientists see over the next 25 to 50 years.
   ``Of course, there are no guarantees that what the scientists
envision will become reality,'' said R. Dean Plowman, administrator
of the agency. ``But based on the research they're involved in
right now, it's certainly within the realm of possibility.''

<HEAD>Quayle Expects Revolution in Military Affairs Over Next Decade</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WEST POINT, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle told
graduating cadets at the U.S. Military Academy on Wednesday that a
revolution in military affairs will require ``new military
organizations and new methods of warfare.''
   Quayle told the 1,011 cadets that their job was to ``maintain a
military establishment that is respected by friend and adversary
alike'' and said that because of their training he was confident
they would meet that challenge.
   The vice president said he expects a revolution in military
affairs over the next 10 to 15 years that will ``require us to
develop new operational concepts, new military organizations and
new methods of warfare.''
   A new strategic planning tool created by the Defense Department,
called Competitive Strategies, will help ``identify, develop and
field the weapons systems we need to be competitive with our major
adversary and to understand how those weapons might be used
operationally,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle was sheltered by a canopy during his 10-minute speech
while the cadets and their families stood and sat in a steady and
often-heavy rain.
   He said the best and shortest speech he could come up with would
have only two words: ``Beat Navy.'' The crowd responded with
thunderous applause.
   He noted that two graduating cadets from Indiana who he had
appointed to the academy made the dean's list, ``something I was
unable to do.'' Quayle's academic record, which reportedly was
below average, was questioned extensively during the 1988
presidential campaign.
   The vice president also praised the cadets' parents for their
support, understanding and encouragement and called families ``the
bedrock of our society.''
   ``This is particularly evident on occasions such as these, which
are in effect celebrations of our families and of their role in
instilling values in succeeding generations of young Americans,''
Quayle said.
   After the diplomas were handed out, the cadets gave the
traditional hat toss.

   More than 20 percent of the costs consultants
charged to the Pentagon in 1988 were deemed ``questionable,'' with
fees for advertising and lobbying mixed into the bills, according
to a Defense Department audit released Wednesday.
   ``If the taxpayers knew they were footing the bill for large
defense contractors to pay for lobbying, lawsuits, advertising and
constant reorganizations, there would be an uproar,'' Sen. David
Pryor, D-Ark., said in releasing the report.
   The Defense Contract Audit Agency, in a study of 118 audits,
found that of the $269 million in consultant costs charged to the
Pentagon, contracts worth $53.7 million were considered
``questionable.''
   Among the charges were $2.2 million for executive or legislative
lobbying and about $440,000 for unallowable public relations and
advertising. The highest cost was $33.8 million for ``lack of
adequate agreement@work product.''
   These costs were incurred because a defense contractor did not
have a written agreement with the consultant.
   ``This type of loosely monitored buddy system is what created
the need for last year's Ill Wind investigation,'' Pryor said. ``I
can only hope that the Defense Department learns from these DCAA
audit reports and improves its management of its contractors.''
   The audit agency recommended that defense contractors correct
the deficiencies in their system of estimating, approving and
accounting for consultant costs.
   The Pentagon is reviewing federal acquisition regulations
covering the definition, allowability and documentation
requirements for consultant costs.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 500 leaders of the Puerto Rican
community met Wednesday at the start of a convention aimed at
improving what they called ``desperate social conditions'' facing
the 2.5 million Puerto Ricans in the United States.
   ``They're living in dire poverty, families are shaking at the
seams,'' said Zorlo Torres, president of the National Congress for
Puerto Rican Rights. ``We've made very little progress in this
country over the last 50 years.''
   Congress members issued a report outlining the status of Puerto
Ricans in the mainland United States showing that 38 percent of the
families live at or below the official poverty line. The report
also said 44 percent of Puerto Rican families are headed by single
mothers, the majority of whom live at the poverty level.
   ``Those of us who are here, those of us who were born here, feel
we are not sharing in the American dream,'' said Angel A.
Amy-Moreno, a professor and historian and a member of the local
Congress chapter.
   ``Some of us live in the worst conditions in this country,'' she
said.
   Torres and Amy-Moreno were among the Puerto Rican leaders who
addressed the start of the fifth National Puerto Rican convention
Wednesday.
   The majority of Puerto Ricans in the United States live in New
York City or nearby. Other large groups are concentrated in New
Jersey, Illinois, California, Connecticut and Massachusetts.
   The report contained mostly discouraging news about life among
Puerto Ricans on the mainland. Among the other findings:
   _Official unemployment for Puerto Ricans is almost double that
of the general working age population in the United States.
   _AIDS is the leading cause of death among Hispanic men in New
York City, where most Puerto Ricans in the United States are found.
   _Puerto Rican families have incomes that are less than half
those of non-Hispanics.
   _Few Puerto Ricans own property and spend much of their incomes
on rent.
   _Only 53 percent of Puerto Ricans over 25 have attended four
years of college, compared with 75 percent for the U.S. general
population.
   ``Puerto Ricans, as well as other Latinos and African Americans,
have benefited the least from the expansion which has characterized
the economy since the recession of the early 1980s,'' the report
concluded.
   But Torres said there are signs of progress, some of which were
sparked by the National Congress, formed in Philadelphia in 1981.
The Congress now has more than seven chapters countrywide.
   ``We've provided a forum for Puerto Ricans to discuss the most
pressing problems facing the community and how to deal with them,''
said Torres.
   Puerto Ricans in this country have tried to better their lot
with labor, convention officials said. Many Puerto Rican workers at
a major Wall Street firm have joined with other minority employees
to demand equal opportunity and more hiring of Hispanics.
   The United Third Bridge, a group of Puerto Rican workers within
Local 3 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, has
taken the union to court for failing to defend them against
discrimination in construction.

<HEAD>Bill Would Require Colleges To Say How Many Athletes Graduate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill requiring colleges to disclose how many
of their athletes graduate could improve education standards for
student athletes, a congressman and former pro basketball player
said Wednesday.
   Rep. Tom McMillen, D-Md., a sponsor of the ``Student-Athlete
Right to Know Act,'' called the effort ``a relatively innocuous
consumer information bill, designed to provide the students and
parents with valuable information about the school they are
considering.''
   McMillen played for the University of Maryland before playing
professionally with the Atlanta Hawks and Washington Bullets.
   In testimony submitted to a House subcommittee, he said the
disclosure bill itself will not ensure that athletes get the
education they deserve but could help ``to move us back towards the
primary goal of educating young people and to developing basic
standards for student-athletes.''
   The right-to-know measure, sponsored by former New York Knicks
star Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., in the Senate, would require
schools receiving federal assistance to report on the graduation
rates of their athletic-scholarship recipients and compare their
rate with that of the general student population.
   Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., chairman of the House Education and
Labor subcommittee on postsecondary education, heard testimony on
the bill last week and again at the hearing Wednesday.
   The Rev. Timothy Healy, president of Georgetown University in
Washington, offered a number of recommendations including reducing
the college basketball season by five weeks and not allowing
freshmen to play.
   He said every school should publish graduation rates and require
that graduation rates for athletic teams must be equivalent to
rates for the entire school. Healy also recommended consideration
of another idea, to limit athletic scholarships based on players'
failure to graduate.
   ``Anything would be better than we have today,'' Healy said in
his testimony.
   The chancellor of the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, Martin
Massengale, said the staff of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association has drafted its own version of right-to-know
legislation. He said NCAA members will consider it at a convention
in January.
   There are several serious issues to be resolved, including which
institutions should have to report and what type of data they need
to submit and to whom, Massengale said in testimony submitted to
the House panel.
   He also said it is unclear whether data should be reported by
race ``as suggested in the Bradley-McMillen bill,'' adding many
institutions would find such a requirement offensive, and in some
cases it night cause legal problems.
   ``These are all legitimate questions, even for one who believes
in the fundamental concept of disclosure,'' Massengale said.

   In what could have been a sequel to ``Moscow on
the Hudson,'' New Yorkers formed bread lines on Wednesday to buy
loaves of real Russian rye flown in from the Soviet Union.
   ``We're selling it at a rate of one loaf every two minutes;
right now, the line is very long,'' said Miraed Peake Smith,
spokeswoman for Bloomingdale's, where 1,100 loaves arrived Tuesday
night.
   ``One person came in and bought 14 loaves,'' she said. Among the
buyers were employees from the Soviet mission to the United Nations.
   ``The bread is good. It's not a gimmick,'' Ms. Smith said. ``But
Americans also seem to be fascinated with Russian items.''
   Yes, but they're still Americans, and any resemblance to Moscow
ends at the rear of the bread line. Competition broke out before
the bread had even arrived in the United States, and a chain of
bakeries is already planning to undercut Bloomingdale's price _ a
hefty $6 for each two-pound loaf.
   The dense bread was made in Moscow on Sunday, shipped Sunday
night, arrived Monday via Aeroflot, underwent federal inspections
and arrived at Bloomingdale's on Tuesday.
   ``That's what we're planning to do every week, assuming it
continues to sell well,'' said Ms. Smith.
   Two varieties are offered from Moscow's Factory No. 10: Rjanog,
a sour rye, recommended with Russian tea, and Borodinsky, a sweeter
bread with coriander seeds. They stay fresh three to four days in a
regular bread box and will ``last forever'' when frozen, Ms. Smith
said.
   Millionaire entrepreneur Fred Kayden, 58, struck the deal that
brought the ``peace bread'' to Bloomingdale's, the Waldorf-Astoria
hotel, the Russian Tea Room and the Rye Town Hilton (which wasn't
renamed for the bread; it's in the town of Rye just north of New
York City).
   When Kayden announced the import plan in March during a
taste-test at the Waldorf, he said it would be sold at 15 Zaro's
Bread Basket stores in the New York area.
   Therein lies the capitalist rub.
   Kayden and Zaro's had a falling out. Stuart Zaro, president of
the New York bakery, said it was over money. Kayden was vague about
the reasons, but said his talks with Mosinter, an economic
association of the Moscow City Council, had bogged down because of
the Soviet bureaucracy.
   Zaro's made its own contract with Mosinter. Kayden stopped
negotiating with that agency and quickly made a deal for
Bloomingdale's through International Farm Products, a new
Soviet-West German venture run by ``one of the new breed of
perestroika entrepreneurs.''
   ``It's an interesting metaphor for the future. I negotiated 7{
months with the Moscow bureaucracy and in 7 days I made a deal with
a Soviet entrepreneur,'' said Kayden.
   Zaro said the Soviets have promised him 2,000 loaves on
Saturday. He'll sell it for $1 less than Bloomingdale's.
   ``Let's see what happens Saturday; I don't see how it will get
through,'' said Kayden. ``The bottom line is that the Russian black
bread is sitting in Bloomingdale's now.''
   Both retailers said they'll seek more deals with the Soviets.
   Kayden said he was working on more imports for Bloomingdale's _
he wouldn't give specifics. Zaro said his father, Philip, who is
company chairman and Kayden's next-door neighbor, will leave for
Moscow on Tuesday to discuss selling a product or opening a store
there.
   The competitors also will have a product name in common: ``peace
bread.''
   ``It has nothing to do with what went on between us and
Kayden,'' said Zaro. ``It obviously is referring to the two
nations.''

   They may not rank up there with the works
of Picasso or Matisse, but Michael Angelo Vidal Jr.'s Etch-A-Sketch
masterpieces are drawing rave reviews at the Burbank Central
Library.
   ``It's incredible,'' said Michael Lewis as he gazed at an
elaborate drawing of a knight battling a scaly dragon outside a
brick medieval castle. ``I've been doing Etch-A-Sketch since I was
little and all I can draw is a face.''
   While the art world reels from an insatiable demand for big-name
creations such as ``Yo Picasso,'' the self-portrait which recently
sold for $47 million, the visionary Vidal is plotting a new
artistic course.
   Equipped with a standard toy-store-issue Etch-A-Sketch, Vidal
meticulously moves the horizontal and vertical knobs on the red
5-by-7 inch ``magic screen'' filled with metallic powder.
   Soon, Voila! The little black squiggle that has kept kids quiet
in the back seat for three decades becomes another Vidal Original.
   Michael Angelo Vidal (and that's his real name) wasn't always an
accomplished Etch-A-Sketcher.
   ``It was always easy for me to draw complicated work. I thought
I could get into any medium _ pencils, paint, oil. But here was
this Etch-A-Sketch and I couldn't get it to work for a darn,'' said
Vidal, 38, of Burbank.
   But the freelance carpenter and artist mastered the
Etch-A-Sketch so it now takes him 15 minutes to draw a portrait,
although up to 25 hours for a more complex work. He said he has
bought several hundred of the toys over the years, and several of
the drawings on display are more than a decade old.
   ``I've sold several pieces of artwork _ anywhere from eight to
10 of them _ mostly to friends and acquaintances,'' he said.
   ``It's unique. I get more response out of this medium. You have
to use two hands to use this. It's a toy, and everyone is aware of
this toy. And I can carry it with me.''
   Although his pictures of a housing development, reptiles, the
Beatles and Darth Vader haven't yet made it to the Louvre or the
National Gallery of Art, the sketchings are prompting open-mouth
amazement at the Burbank library, where they are on sale at prices
ranging from $200 to $5,000.
   ``It's incredible,'' said Bill Kahikina, repeating a common
utterance by viewers of the Etch-A-Sketch art. ``All I could do is
draw a square.''
   The etchings are exhibited flat in a glass case, propped up ever
so slightly because of the delicate nature of the toy. The board
erases when it is shaken or turned over _ a feature that's nice for
kids, potentially disastrous for Vidal.
   Once, he recalled, he had to brake sharply in his car and an
Etch-A-Sketch fell off the seat. ``It was a loss,'' Vidal said.
   Special care will be taken next month when the Vidal etching
collection is moved down the street for its next engagement at the
Brand Art and Music Library in nearby Glendale. Could the Los
Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art be next?
   Etch-A-Sketch went on the market in 1960 for $2.98. It has
become one of the most popular children's toys ever, having sold
more than 50 million since its introduction and continuing to sell
about 2 million a year at its current $8.99 cost, said Lowell
Wilson, vice president of development and marketing for The Ohio
Art Co., which manufactures the toy.
   ``We're now into our third generation of Etch-A-Sketch. Mothers
bought them for their children and now those children are mothers
buying it for their children,'' Wilson said.
   Vidal is not alone in his hobby. Wilson said there is an
Etch-A-Sketch art club with 25,000 members. Most are children
between 3 and 10 years old, but there are also many adult members
who are accomplished etchers.
   ``These people are amazing,'' Wilson said. ``People have
detailed Mount Rushmore, detailed dollar bills. It's definitely an
art form.''
   Vidal couldn't agree more.
   ``There's a technique to it. It has great detail. You have to be
an artist to draw them,'' he said. ``I do consider it serious art.''

   The fuel-economy standard for 1989 passenger
cars will remain at 26.5 miles per gallon, the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration said Wednesday in rejecting a
petition for reconsideration of the regulation.
   The petition filed by two Washington-based advocacy groups, the
Center for Auto Safety and Public Citizen, asked NHTSA to allow the
corporate average fuel economy standard to revert to 27.5 mpg, the
level set by a 1975 law intended to reduce dependence on foreign
oil.
   The advocacy groups failed to make a case that ``the standard
should have been set at a level other than 26.5 mpg,'' NHTSA's
order said.
   In their petition, the organizations argued that contrary to
NHTSA's findings, Congress' fuel-economy goals remaned unmet. The
organizations said NHTSA erred in determining that General Motors
Corp., the world's largest automaker, could only meet at 26.5 mpg
standard and in blaming declining GM sales on the fuel-economy
standards.
   The petition put NHTSA in a position of defending the 26.5 mpg
fuel-economy standard after Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
said last week he would allow the standard to revert to 27.5 mpg
for the 1990 model year. Skinner said then he hoped the stiffer
standard would encourage the automakers to make more efficient cars.
   ``If the agency had applied the same standards to 1989 as it did
to 1990, it would have kept the standard at 27.5 mpg,'' said
Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety. ``Today's
decision is simply inconsistent with last week's decision by
Secretary Skinner. One of the two decisions has to be wrong, and
we're sure Secretary Skinner was wrong this week and right last
week.''
   The fuel economy standards require each automaker's fleet of
passenger cars, on average, to attain a certain gas mileage.
   The 1975 law set a gradually rising scale of fuel economy that
must be met, with the goal of reaching 27.5 mpg, but also allowed
NHTSA's parent agency, the Transportation Department, to loosen the
minimum standard through administrative order to account for
economic and technical factors.
   The standard was loosened under that provision to 26 mpg in 1986
at the request of the automakers, and remained there until 1989.

<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 3 grafs to UPDATE with Touvier charged with crimes
against humanity. Pick up 4th pvs, `Touvier, 74...'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of France's most notorious Nazi collaborators
was arrested Wednesday and charged with crimes against humanity
after spending most of four decades in hiding.
   Paul Touvier, captured at a priory in Nice, faces trial for
crimes he allegedly committed while leading the pro-Nazi French
militia in Lyon, where he worked closely with Gestapo chief Klaus
Barbie.
   Touvier, 74, was captured Wednesday morning in Nice and flown to
Paris for questioning, police said. He was taken in a guarded fire
department ambulance to the Palais de Justice where he was charged,
and then transferred to a prison in Fresnes, south of the capital.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse, quoting neighbors
who witnessed the arrest, said Touvier was taken into custody at
St. Francis Priory, which is run by followers of excommunicated
Monsignor Marcel Lefevbre. The Vatican expelled the right-wing
fundamentalist priest last year after a long battle over church
doctrine.
   ``We see this with great satisfaction,'' said Beate Klarsfeld,
France's best-known Nazi hunter. ``It's a great bravo for French
justice.'' Mrs. Klarsfeld was instrumental in tracking down Barbie,
who in 1987 was sentenced to life in prison for crimes against
humanity.
   Touvier was arrested when France was liberated, but he escaped.
He was convicted twice and sentenced to death in absentia for
executing and torturing members of the resistance.
   He managed to stay hidden until the sentences against him
expired under a 20-year statute of limitations. In 1971, President
Georges Pompidou quietly pardoned Touvier.
   New charges were raised two years later, however, and the
collaborator again became a fugitive.
   Touvier's protection during the early postwar period by senior
members of the Roman Catholic hierarchy has been extensively
documented, and historian Henri Amouroux said his trial would bring
out ``the role the church played.'' Monsignor Charles Duquaire, who
was private secretary to the archbishop of Lyon during the
occupation, urged Pompidou to pardon Touvier, who had lived in a
succession of monasteries in the southern French region.
   One account, by the Lyon journalist and historian Pierre
Merindol, said Duquaire was fulfilling a pledge in return for
Touvier securing the release of 42 hostages about to be shot by the
Germans in retaliation for an act of sabotage.
   When asked to comment on the arrest, Cardinal Albert Decourtray,
current archbishop of Lyon, said he hoped ``the respect for others
will prevail over lies and settling of accounts.''
   Written accounts suggest Touvier could expose prominent
Frenchmen as collaborators. Similar fears were expressed before
Barbie's trial, but no revelations were made.
   The new arrest warrant against Touvier lists six charges,
including the killing of Victor Basch, president of France's League
for Human Rights.
   Investigators determined that when Basch, 81, and his wife, were
arrested by Touvier's militiamen in January 1944 they were ``judged
too old to be deported and they were killed on the spot.''
   A death notice for Touvier was published in a Grenoble newspaper
in 1984, giving thanks in the name of his family for expressions of
sympathy. It was never explained, and there were frequent reports
afterward that Touvier was seen in monasteries in France, Italy or
Switzerland.
   Touvier's brother Andre, 61, said in an interview he was
surprised by the arrest because he had been ``99 percent''
convinced his brother was dead.
   ``In a certain sense, his arrest is a good thing. The inquiry
will show, even if he is not lily-white, that people have
exaggerated and made a mythical figure out of him,'' Andre Touvier
said.
   Robert Nant, who was an 18-year-old resistance fighter when he
says he was captured by the militia and tortured by Touvier for 10
days in May 1944, said the collaborator should be brought to trial.
   ``He's 74 years old, time passes, but Touvier still has an
account to settle with justice today,'' Nant said.

   The chief arms control negotiator under
President Reagan said Wednesday he was rebuffed in January when he
urged the Bush administration to negotiate cuts in short-range
nuclear missiles with the Soviets.
   ``It was my view that it is important to capture, to the extent
that you can, the political initiative,'' said Paul H. Nitze, who
left office May 2.
   President Bush, headed for a summit of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization next Monday, is trying to end an alliance crisis
involving the short-range missiles.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose party faces tough
elections next year, wants Bush to open immediate negotiations, but
Bush is pressing Kohl to agree to modernize the existing 88 Lance
missile launchers in Europe.
   Nitze, in a speech at the National Press Club, said Bush's
course would gain no advantage for the United States and was
putting the Germans in an impossible political position.
   ``It appeared to me that we could well take the iniative and
propose to Kohl that we ask the Soviets to join us in prompt
neogiatiations on short-range missiles,'' said Nitze.
   ``This propsal would be contingent on the German government
agreeing to adhere to its previous position opposing the total
elimination of short-range missiles, and to support us as we
attempted to secure equal ceilings on such missiles to a level
around 200 or 300 such missiles on each side,'' he said.
   ``I thought that the time was right in January to take this
iniative to (Secretary of State James A.) Baker. But it was
rejected by him,'' said Nitze.
   ``The Soviet Union has a great superiority in such weapons
today. And without an agreement providing for one-sided reductions
by the U.S.S.R. to U.S. levels, it will be able to maintain such
superiority indefinitely in the future,'' Nitze said.
   ``An exchange betweeen us in short-range missiles would be
totally and one-sidely destructive for ourselves and our allies,
primarily the Germans,'' he said.
   ``If the point is our ability to be able to initiate a nuclear
attack regardless of its effectiveness, we have in the European
area a variety of nuclear weapons of every significant range. The
true deterrent to Soviet attack in Europe on ourselves or our
allies must be the great power and diversity of our strategic
nuclear forces deployed at sea or based in the United States,'' he
said.
   Nitze said he anticipates an agreement will be worked out. ``In
the past 40 years, NATO has always appeared to be in more or less
in dissarray,'' he said.
   ``The manifest and continuing threat from the East, and the
essential reality of the U.S. contribution to both the conventional
and the nuclear deterrrence to that threat were evident and tended
to overcome the centrifugal forces in the alliance in every crisis
situation,'' he said.
   ``The view that the threat from the East has diminished to the
unimportant is already widespread. Few credit that shift to the
continuing strength and unity of NATO when that was needed,'' Nitze
said.

<HEAD>Roughly 40 Percent Drop in Yellowstone's Northern Elk Herd</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hard winter and
extended hunting season produced a decline of almost 40 percent in
Yellowstone National Park's northern elk herd, according to
biologists.
   Harvest of the animals during regular and late-season hunting
accounted for 14 percent to 16 percent mortality, and 24 percent to
27 percent of the herd died from winter exposure, the biologists
said.
   Earlier this year Yellowstone biologist Frank Singer had
estimated that roughly one-third of the northern herd would die
either from hunting or the winter weather. However, by early March
nearly one-fourth of the herd had already died.
   A report issued by the biologists Tuesday said last year's
forest fires and drought were followed by a winter of snow that
ranged from 95 percent to 110 percent of normal. Three separate
arctic cold fronts contributed to the winter kill, the biologists
said.
   Studies of carcasses this spring indicated that most of the dead
elk were either elderly or calves.
   ``A large number of the survivors are prime-age reproductive
animals,'' the report said.
   They said elk died in greater numbers than mule deer and
antelope because no mule deer or antelope winter range was burned
by the fires.
   The biologists based their figures on aerial counts of the herd,
Yellowstone's largest. In early winter the population was estimated
at 18,506 to 20,358 head, while on Jan. 26 the number fell between
17,207 and 19,059.
   Counts in April following Montana's late-season elk hunt outside
the park placed the herd's population between 11,801 and 13,137
animals, according to the biologists. The counts suggested that
almost 5,000 elk died from winter kill alone.
   Singer and fellow biologist Tom Lemke, of the Montana Department
of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, said in their report that it is
impossible ``to separate the effects of drought and the fires of
1988 upon elk,'' since both factors affected summer and winter
range.
   Yellowstone officials said Wednesday they haven't established
any average mortality rate for the herd because they have conducted
serious elk research only in the past couple years.

   There is such a thing as a free lunch in
this industrial Miami suburb. There also are free school buses,
free van trips, free boat rides, free housekeepers _ the list goes
on and on.
   In fact, with 120 full- and part-time employees serving Medley's
547 residents, the townfolk pay nothing for just about all their
municipal services.
   Their secret? It's no secret, really. Medley has a tax base that
would be the envy of any town: three businesses for every two
residents.
   Businesses provide 98 percent of Medley's tax earnings,
according to Mayor Tobie Wilson. An estimated $400,000 a year, or
10 percent of the annual budget, goes into free services for
residents.
   All residents in Medley, a dusty town jammed against the
Everglades, are entitled to a free hot lunch every weekday. One
resident, Alvaro Arango, has accepted the offer every weekday for
the past eight years.
   In addition to the free school bus rides for children and free
van rides to the supermarket and beauty parlor, there are free car
trips to the doctor's office and free pickup of medical
prescriptions.
   Residents get free boat rides on the Miami River. They pay
nothing to swim in the town pool, lift weights in the gym, even
receive health care and housekeepers in their homes. Kids can play
video games all day long at the town's game room and never spend a
quarter.
   And more services are on the way. Medley officials are planning
to set up low-cost housing for less-privileged residents. Their
efforts will be reported in the town's free weekly newspaper,
delivered door to door.
   ``There's a lot of local stuff in there the people like to
read,'' Wilson said. ``If people know what's going on, they usually
complain less.''
   Did he say complain?

   Florida legislators may be winning the
war on taxes during the 1989 session, but many admit they're losing
the battle of the bulge.
   With the Legislature approaching its scheduled June 2 deadline,
the last two months of wining and dining is taking a heavy toll on
waistlines, House and Senate members say.
   An 18-page legislative social calendar shows lawmakers have as
many as eight chances a night for free chow, sponsored by groups
ranging from the Florida Funeral Directors Association to the
state's School Food Service Association.
   ``I usually lose weight when I'm up here, but not this year,''
said Sen. William ``Doc'' Myers, who, at 370 pounds, is the largest
person in either body of the Legislature.
   Rep. Jack Tobin, who dropped 80 pounds two years ago, has swung
back up to 250 pounds.
   ``There's just an awful lot of receptions and cocktail
parties,'' Tobin said. ``When you go, you indulge.''

   Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney's daughter will spend the summer working in Yellowstone
National Park's backcountry, thanks to a phone call from her mother
to the park superintendent. Mary Cheney initially received a form
letter rejecting her summer job application for Youth Conservation
Corps crew leader. But after Lynne Cheney talked to superintendent
Bob Barbee, a seasonal ranger's job was approved for the college
junior.
   Mrs. Cheney, chairwoman of the National Endowment for the
Humanities, said Wednesday she never considered her clout, or her
husband's, when she called Barbee to inquire about a job for her
daughter.
   ``I wasn't calling as somebody in Washington, I was calling as a
mother,'' she said from her Washington office after her role in the
job offer was reported Wednesday by The Washington Post.
   Yellowstone officials said it's not unusual for them to review
rejected job applications.
   ``We get phone calls from people many, many times. From
congressional (staff members) who had one of their constituents who
called them to check into things,'' park spokeswoman Marsha Karle
said when asked about the turn of events.
   ``We do it on a frequent basis, where we'll go back and look at
things again.''
   Mary Cheney is scheduled to start her eight-week job next month.
She'll be paid $6.74 an hour and will spend most of the time in
Yellowstone's backcountry working with Youth Conservation Corps
crews as a camp counselor, Karle said.
   Yellowstone hired almost 300 seasonal rangers from about 2,000
applicants, Karle said.

<TEXT>
   Congress must change the War Powers Act,
witnesses told a House panel Wednesday with some suggesting
measures to strengthen consultations between the executive and
legislative branches and others calling for repeal of the
Vietnam-era law.
   Rep. Larry J. Hopkins, R-Ky., told the House Armed Services
subcommittee on investigations that the law is flawed, but he
cautioned against repealing it.
   ``We have an obligation as lawmakers ... when we see something
wrong to right it, when something is broken, fix it,'' said
Hopkins, the ranking Republican on the panel.
   Enacted in 1973 over the veto of then-President Nixon, the law
requires a presidential report to Congress when U.S. military
personnel are sent into situations of ``imminent hostilities.''
Under some instances, the troops must be withdrawn after 60 or 90
days unless Congress votes to allow them to remain.
   Hopkins said the United States was fortunate that the War Powers
Act was not invoked in the Persian Gulf in 1987 when former
President Reagan allowed Kuwaiti-owned oil tankers to sail under
the American flag and sent U.S. Navy warships to protect them from
Iranian attack.
   According to Hopkins, Iran could have taken advantage of the
limited time the troops could remain in the gulf.
   The Kentucky Republican mentioned legislation he introduced last
year that would remove the provision automatically withdrawing
forces and strengthen consultation between Congress and the
president.
   The measure has been referred to the subcommittee for
consideration, Hopkins said.
   Morton Halperin, who served on the National Security Council
during the Nixon administration, said he opposes the time limit of
the War Powers Act and urged Congress to alter the law.
   ``Do not be deterred by critics who say it's fine, leave it
alone,'' said Halperin, who is the director of the Washington
office of the American Civil Liberties Union.
   But Robert F. Turner of the University of Virginia Law School
called for repeal of the War Powers Act, describing the law as
``irrelevant, illegal, incompetent, irresponsible and insensitive
to the safety of U.S. Armed Forces.''
   Turner, associate director of the school's Center for Law and
National Security, said the law was unconstitutional because it
gives Congress powers delegated to the president.
   In a sharp attack, Turner also said Congress ``cannot keep
secrets. Congress cannot act with speed and dispatch,'' and should
not have the authority of the executive branch, he added.
   The War Powers Act has been the subject of an ongoing battle
between the White House and Congress. In November 1983, Congress
voted to override Nixon's veto of the bill with supporters arguing
that Nixon's Vietnam War policies were usurping Congress'
constitutional right to declare war.
   Hopkins said President Bush recently indicated to him that he
would be willing ``to open it up for some discussion'' on the War
Powers Act.

   Hampered by rules against motorized vehicles,
firefighters are battling a fire in the heart of Everglades
National Park that has burned more than 75,000 acres in an area
that hadn't burned in 30 years, officials said Wednesday.
   ``This has become a logistical nightmare,'' said park
information officer Pat Tolle. ``You have no roads. Federal laws
prohibit the use of motorized vehicles, so this has become a major
firefighter's nightmare. What looks flat when you're sitting in
your car is the worst hiking.''
   She said about 257 people, including ``hotshot'' teams of
experienced firefighters from California, were battling the blaze,
which has charred more than 75,000 acres. They use five helicopters
to move personnel and dump water.
   South Florida has been plagued by brush and grass fires during
an unusually dry spring. Residents of metropolitan Miami have grown
accustomed to a blanket of smelly smoke that sometimes covers the
area, as it did Wednesday.
   Tolle said the Everglades blaze is typical of early rainy season
fires in the park. It was sparked by lightning May 16, and if rain
in the area had been more evenly distributed, it might not have
burned as long as it has.
   ``But rain is not yet general,'' she said. ``It may dump 6
inches here and none across the road. And the lightning struck out
to the side in areas where it's really dry.''
   The fire is roughly 30 mile southwest of downtown Miami. Ms.
Tolle said that particular area hadn't burned over for about 30
years, giving the fire plenty of fuel.
   Officials had been worried that a Miccosukee Indian village in
the park might be threatened, but the wind changed direction
Wednesday morning.
   ``The distance to the village is still some 10 to 12 miles from
the fire line itself,'' Tolle said, adding that some precautionary
steps were being taken at the village ``as much to reassure the
residents of their safety'' as to get ready for fire action.
   About 500 people live in the village along U.S. 41, known as the
Tamiami Trail, the southernmost route across the Everglades region.
   The wind shift may have been part of a weather change that could
bring firefighters some help, according to the National Weather
Service office in Coral Gables.
   ``There is a chance that we will get some rain on it and if it
does occur it will be a heavy rain,'' said meteorologist Bob Pifer,
citing a combination of unstable air and warmth.

<TEXT>
   A jury awarded the wife of British mass killer
Peter Sutcliffe, the so-called ``Yorkshire Ripper,'' a record
$942,000 in libel damages Wednesday against a satirical magazine,
Private Eye.
   Ian Hislop, editor of Private Eye, said the bimonthly may have
to fold and declared, ``If this is justice, I'm a banana.''
   Sonia Sutcliffe, whose truck driver husband was jailed for life
in 1981 for killing 13 women and attempting to kill five more,
hurried from the court with a blanket over her head.
   The 200,000-circulation Private Eye was ordered to pay the
damages for alleging that Mrs. Sutcliffe sold her story to a
tabloid newspaper for $392,000 after carousing with its reporters
at a hotel.
   ``We are totally flabbergasted,'' said Hislop. ``I think this is
very nearly the end of Private Eye. We cannot possibly pay that
amount of damages. We are going to launch a Ripper Balls Fund and
try to raise some money (for an appeal).''
   Hislop, whose gossipy, muckraking magazine is often sued,
complained the award was 100 times the average compensation paid to
three of Sutcliffe's victims.
   The award to 38-year-old Mrs. Sutcliffe, who is legally
separated from her husband, was the highest in Britain given by a
jury in a libel suit.
   The previous record was $831,000 awarded to novelist Jeffrey
Archer in 1987 against The Daily Star, a London tabloid newspaper
that said he gave money to a prostitute. He said he never met her.
   Pop singer Elton John won a record $1.84 million libel
settlement from Britain's top-selling newspaper, The Sun, last
year, but in an out-of-court settlment.
   Private Eye also will have to pay $157,000 in court costs.
   During the week-long hearing, Mrs. Sutcliffe appeared composed
as she told how she was pressured to tell her story after her
husband's arrest.
   ``The press seemed to be everywhere, banging on the doors,
shouting through the doors and banging on the windows,'' she said.
``They pushed notes through the windows offering money and shouted
`I'll top any offer.'''
   But she said she decided never to tell her story because she
believed newspapers only wanted details of her sexual relations
with her husband.
   Sutcliffe, who is held at a hospital for the criminally insane,
killed the women over five years in the north England county of
Yorkshire. At his trial, he said he believed God had ordered him to
kill prostitutes.
   Private Eye first alleged in 1981 that Mrs. Sutcliffe had made a
deal with London's Daily Mail newspaper.
   In 1983, it repeated the allegation. This year, after receiving
her libel writ, it published two more articles that Mrs. Sutcliffe
said implied that she knew about her husband's crimes.
   During the trial, Private Eye accepted there was no deal with
the Daily Mail but argued the gist of the story was true. It said
Mrs. Sutcliffe had negotiated with newspapers and was prepared to
capitalize on her husband's crimes.
   Private Eye, launched in 1961, is Britain's best-known satirical
magazine with its chatty mix of gossip and satire along with
reporting on scandal and corruption.
   Libel and legal fees have often bitten into its profits, and its
founder and first editor, Richard Ingrams, once gave his recreation
in Who's Who as ``litigation.''
   Peter Carter-Ruck, Britain's top libel lawyer, said the award
showed juries were now determined to punish newspapers and
magazines, as opposed to compensating the aggrieved.
   ``I think this award is disastrous,'' he said, adding that while
big national newspapers could afford to pay huge damages, smaller
publications will simply go out of business.

   Minor maintenance could have prevented a
near-disaster involving an oil tanker that crashed into a concrete
catwalk and stopped just short of a major oil transfer station in
San Francisco Bay, a crewman said.
   The Exxon-chartered oil tanker, the Overseas Juneau, was laden
with 17 million gallons of crude oil at the time of the April 14
accident. The Coast Guard and state Board of Pilot Commissioners
are investigating the accident.
   Boatswain John Ballentine, 32, said Tuesday that inadequate
maintenance prevented the crew from dropping anchor and slowing the
ship as it approached a Chevron refinery at twice its normal speed.
The tanker demolished a 100-foot section of catwalk.
   ``Another 50 feet down the dock and it would have been the
largest explosion in America,'' Ballentine said outside the pilots
board meeting. He said the anchors had not been greased properly.
   Swift action steered the bow of the boat away from the loading
station and prevented a disastrous explosion inside the partially
filled tanks, he said.
   An official of the company that owns the ship denied
Ballentine's charges and said the anchors had been greased properly.
   The ship had been en route to Alaska to help replace the
crippled Exxon Valdez after it ran aground in Alaska's Prince
William Sound on March 24, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of
oil in the nation's worst spill.
   No one was injured in the April accident and the only damage to
the ship was a large amount of concrete debris on deck. The ship
continued on to Alaska and is now headed back to California.
   The board said the accident is under investigation and declined
to discuss the matter or take testimony from Ballentine. The Coast
Guard says the cause has not been determined.
   The tanker was operated by Marine Overseas Corp. of New York and
chartered by Exxon. Capt. Robert Johnston, vice president of
operations for Maritime Overseas, refused to discuss the accident
but denied Ballentine's charges of improper maintenance.
   ``I'm sure it will come out in the inquiry that the anchors were
properly greased,'' Johnston said.
   Ballentine said he quit his job aboard the ship as a result of
the accident. Johnston said the boatswain had cited a medical
reason for leaving.
   The Chevron refinery, which processes 365,000 barrels of oil a
day, is the largest plant in the San Francisco Bay area, and is
linked to a major crude oil pipeline, said Leslie Estes, of the
Central Coast Regional Studies Program.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Oil Spill Liability Bill</HEAD>

   A House subcommittee on Wednesday approved a
bill giving the federal government authority to determine damages
to be paid by oil companies after spills.
   The measure approved by the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries
Coast Guard subcommittee bars states from enacting stricter damage
laws than the federal standard.
   The issue of state versus federal standard has been the chief
hurdle over the past 13 years blocking legislation to simplify
existing oil spill laws. The oil industry has favored having the
federal government set damages.
   While the House has repeatedly passed bills allowing federal
standards, the Senate has insisted that states be permitted to have
stricter standards.
   The chief Senate supporter of that position has been Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, who has introduced a
liability bill.
   The March 24 oil spill of the Exxon Valdez in Alaska has given
new impetus to attempts to reach a compromise.
   ``I think for the first time we have an incredible momentum for
a bill,'' said Rep. W. J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, D-La., chairman of the
House subcommittee.
   He explained that changes in wording may make the House measure
more acceptable to past opponents.
   States can now tax oil companies to obtain the money needed to
clean up spills. If the bill is approved, the federal government
would create by a clean-up fund bankrolled by a 1.3 cent per barrel
tax on all imported oil.
   The bill is one of several in Congress spawned by the Exxon
Valdez accident, the nation's worst-ever oil spill. The giant
tanker hit a well-marked reef, pouring 11 million gallons of crude
oil into pristine Prince William Sound.
   The subcommittee also the Prince William Sound Oil Spill
Response Act, which calls for better surveillance of vessels in
Prince William Sound and stronger safety measures in case of a
spill.
   The bill says a person's license to operate a vessel in the
sound could be revoked if the individual was convicted of violating
alcohol abuse laws. It states that licenses will not be issued or
renewed if the person is a chronic alcohol abuser.
   Exxon announced March 31 that it had fired the Exxon Valdez
captain, Joseph Hazelwood, after federal investigators reported
that his blood alcohol level was well above the Coast Guard maximum
10 hours after the accident. It was revealed that Hazelwood had a
history of drunken driving convictions.
   In addition, the legislation authorizes a total of $15 million
to study the environmental impact of the spill.
   It also authorizes another $5 million to the Coast Guard to
improve its response to oil spills in Arctic waters and $3 million
to the Maritime Administration for studies on the safety of tankers
operating in Alaskan waters.
   In a third bill passed Wednesday, the subcommittee answered a
problem being created by the administration's ``zero tolerance''
drug interdiction program.
   Commercial vessels siezed because illegal ``personal use'' drugs
are found on board can be returned to their owners during the Coast
Guard's investigation.

   Science is at the point where human
diseases can be attacked on the molecular level, doctors said
Wednesday at the opening of a $50 million center devoted to joining
laboratory work and patient care.
   More than 20 international scientists, including five Nobel
Prize winners, gathered at ceremonies and a symposium at the
Beckman Center for Molecular and Genetic Medicine at Stanford
University.
   ``I don't think it's too far off base to say that the new era of
genetic and molecular medicine will offer changes as significant to
medical sciences as occurred more than 100 years ago when
scientists discovered that bacteria were the underlying cause of
disease,'' said Nobelist Paul Berg, director of the center.
   David Korn, dean of Stanford's medical school, said the center
has attracted at least 40 ``world-class medical scientists'' and
would have an annual budget of $20 million to $40 million.
   The center, adjacent to Stanford Hospital, has brought together
such researchers as molecular scientists and doctors specializing
in pediatrics, infectious diseases and other areas.
   ``The right mind, looking at a frustrating clinical problem can
often come up with an insight, which if transferred back into the
right scientific environment, can open up a whole new field of
research,'' Korn said.
   Other Nobel laureates at the symposium were David Baltimore of
the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Michael Brown and
Joseph Goldstein of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
School and Arthur Kornberg of Stanford.
   Controlling genetic diseases, such as sickle cell anemia and
certain cancers, through molecular genetics were among the papers
presented at the three-day symposium.
   ``All along we've said that this line of research will lead to
significant advances and benefits in medicine,'' said Berg. ``Now I
think they are very close at hand. In the next decade, the impact
of molecular genetics in medicine will be mind-boggling. I expect
we'll see a succession of major breakthroughs in understanding and,
ultimately, in dealing with human disease.''
   Researchers in molecular and genetic medicine seek to understand
human disease or physiology in terms of molecules and genes, Berg
said.
   ``The idea of the program is to reach out and encompass
everybody who shares that same philosophical perspective,'' he said.
   The center and a few others like it will speed up application of
research work because they provide ``a very necessary channel of
communication between the patient and the laboratory,'' Korn said.
``It really is a two-way street. It isn't only from the laboratory
to the bedside.''
   Molecular biologists are probing genetic susceptibility in
people to particular forms of arthritic disease and identifying
certain kinds of cells that cause arthritic damage. The researchers
are trying to inactivate those specific harmful cells without
shutting down the whole immune system.
   The same strategy is being used in infantile diabetes and
multiple sclerosis.
   There also is evidence that certain genetically designed growth
hormones would allow doctors to push radiation therapy and
chemotherapy to higher levels than ever in fighting cancer. The
hormones would be used to protect and rescue the bone marrow from
obliteration by the therapy.
   Another area of research is the search for a tiny group of
powerful cells that, when activated by a hormone, specifically go
after kidney cancers without injuring anything else.
   ``Talk about magic bullets! This is a kind of magic bullet that
everybody's been looking for,'' Korn said.
   Still another frontier of research is the study of how cells in
the nervous system communicate with each other on a molecular level.
   Korn cautioned against misinterpreting scientists' enthusiasm
for breakthroughs in the laboratories, or successful tests with
some patients, with promises of imminent cures for cancer and other
diseases.
   ``I do think this is a revolution and I do think that molecular
biology is going to have as profound effects on medicine as
anything that's happened in the history of biological science,'' he
said. ``But I'm not going to tell you that one year from now we
will have cures for a lot of diseases.''

   Three Democratic lawmakers, saying too many
former Pentagon officials are going to work too soon for private
defense firms they had dealings with while they were in the
government, proposed on Wednesday to toughen the so-called
revolving door regulations.
   Democratic Reps. Charles E. Bennett of Florida, Barbara Boxer of
California and Les AuCoin of Oregon introduced legislation to
prevent defense companies with more than $10 million in contracts
from hiring senior defense personnel for two years after those
officials leave government service.
   The lawmakers defined senior officials as those receiving no
less than $68,700 a year and specifically mentioned the defense
secretary, general counsel and the services' secretary and chief of
staff.
   In all, there are 1,580 civilians and 1,073 general officers who
fit the legislation's definition, the lawmakers said. The
statistics were based on information from the General Accounting
Office, the investigative arm of Congress; and the Defense Manpower
Data Center, a private group.
   The three House members complained that, according to fiscal
1987 data, the latest figures available, 39 percent of former
senior Pentagon officials worked on the same contract for a defense
company that they had handled while at the Pentagon.
   The GAO reported that about 70 percent of former defense
officials violate the law by failing to report their new jobs with
defense contractors.
   ``The question before us today is whether the American people
will be asked to throw up their hands and resign themselves to
having their chicken coops guarded by some very hungry foxes,''
AuCoin said at a news conference.
   Bennett called the legislation a ``simple bill'' that for two
years would prevent ``somebody in a high-ranking position from
sitting at one side of the negotiating table and then jumping to
the other side.''
   Current law prevents former officials from working for a company
on the same contract they supervised while in government service.
The officials could work for the company on other matters.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and other Bush administration
officials have complained that the revolving door laws have made it
difficult to attract qualified people from the defense industry to
work for the government.
   Asked whether the regulations are preventing the best and the
brightest from serving the government, Boxer said the country
doesn't need people ``cashing in on government service.''
   ``Certain people will not do it and good riddance,'' she said.
``We don't want them in government.''
   Boxer said the former officials would be prevented from working
for two years at about 1,300 defense companies of the 40,000. They
would not be restricted from working for universities and think
tanks.
   Boxer is co-chairman of the Congressional Military Reform
Caucus, Bennett is a senior member of the House Armed Services
Committee and AuCoin is a member of the House Appropriations
subcommittee on defense.

   Soviet veterans of the fighting in Afghanistan
on Wednesday shared their sorrows with Americans who are mourning
friends and relatives killed in the Vietnam War.
   The 15 ``Afghantsi,'' as they are known in the Soviet Union,
began their U.S. visit with a trip to the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial, which memorializes those killed and missing in America's
longest war.
   Dressed like other tourists, the Soviets blended into the
throngs of Americans solemnly looking at the 58,156 names etched
into the low, black granite wall and the flowers, letters, flags
and medals left at its base.
   The two wars _ America in Vietnam and the Soviet Union in
Afghanistan _ are often compared in terms of the trauma they caused
the two superpowers and the alienation and other psychological
problems faced by veterans.
   The Soviet visit is part of an attempt to gain insight into how
American veterans coped with their postwar psychological problems.
They also want to learn about developments in artificial limbs and
other aids for the handicapped, said John Wheeler, president of the
Center for Study of the Vietnam Generation.
   The memorial and the U.S. mourners ``have ignited our fires,
made our pulses beat faster...we have felt ourselves like those who
fought in Vietnam,'' said Alexander Karpenko, a 27-year-old veteran
with a burn-scarred face and forehead.
   Karpenko, wearing a Detroit Tigers baseball cap given him by an
American, said he was injured in the explosion of his armored car
in a 1981 guerrilla ambush while he helped guard an Afghan army
convoy from Kabul to Ghardez.
   Nikolai Knerick of Moscow, who fought in Afghanistan from
1982-84, described as ``a spiritual experience'' his coversation
through an interpreter with Lewis Puller, a legless veteran of a
1968 ambush at Danang.
   The Soviet ``Afghantsi'' put up their own memorial and began
their own rehabilitation programs, with the help of World War II
vets, he said. Now they are ``waking up the government for social
and medical rehabilitation,'' Knerick said.
   Puller, 43, recalled that he and his late father, famed Marine
Lt. Gen. Lewis B. ``Chesty'' Puller, ``disagreed on everything
politically,'' to which Knerick replied, ``that was
understandable.''
   The Soviets said they have organized the Union of Afghanistan
Veterans under Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's liberalized
policies.
   The Soviet veterans, accompanied by psychologists, were invited
by U.S. Vietnam veterans who visited them last year on a survey of
Soviet war rehabilitation problems. The visitors are staying in
private homes.
   They will be shown veterans' hospitals and counseling centers
and told how American Vietnam veterans ``had to organize and fight
the government to get justice, how we work with Viet veterans now
in Congress, how we used the court system'' in such matters as
compensation for victims of Agent Orange, said Skip Roberts,
executive director of the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation.
   The Soviets plan to take part in the city's weekend observance
of Memorial Day, the national holiday honoring U.S. war dead. They
then will visit homes in Cleveland, Ohio; Missoula, Mont.;
Bainbridge Island, Wash.; San Francisco, Los Angeles and Santa
Barbara in California, and New York.

   A mother's 21-month jail stay should end
because further incarceration won't end a bitter child custody
battle or persuade her to reveal where she has hidden her daughter,
a city appeals court was told Wednesday.
   Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, a prominent plastic surgeon, was sent to
the District of Columbia Jail on civil contempt charges in August
1987 after refusing to produce her daughter Hilary for
court-ordered visits with Eric Foretich, Morgan's ex-husband and
the girl's father.
   Morgan said she hid the girl because Foretich had sexually
abused her; Foretich has denied those charges. Morgan has been in
prison ever since, and the six-year-old Hilary's whereabouts are
unknown.
   ``She will not trade her freedom for her daughter's safety,''
Stephen Sachs, Morgan's attorney, told a three-judge District of
Columbia Court of Appeals panel that was reviewing a lower court
judge's decision to keep Morgan behind bars.
   Civil contempt of court jailings are designed to coerce an
inmate into providing information, property or persons the court
seeks, but Sachs argued that since Morgan has not cooperated and
has not been charged with a crime, her jailing violates her due
process rights.
   ``Dr. Morgan is confined unconstitutionally because her
incarceration will not serve a coercive function,'' Sachs said.
``There is no substantive likelihood that she will relent (and
reveal her daughter's location) _ not today, not tomorrow, not
ever.''
   While in jail, Morgan has been forced to shut down her
once-thriving plastic surgery practice, and Sachs said her debts
now exceed $1.5 million.
   ``She has demonstrated her resolve,'' Sachs argued. ``This is
not Dr. Morgan's word we're asking the court to rely on. These are
hard facts here.''
   The hearing came one day after Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va.,
introduced a bill that would limit civil contempt of court jailings
in the nation's capital to 18 months. The bill would also apply the
law retroactively to Morgan's case, which would lead to her freedom.
   A House District of Columbia subcommittee plans to schedule
additional hearings on the matter before voting on it.
   Foretich, who attended Wednesday's appeals court ruling, said
afterward that he was willing to sit down with Sachs and negotiate
a settlement that would lead both to Morgan's freedom and the safe
return of his daughter.
   If the appeals court frees Morgan, there are no guarantees that
he will see his daughter again, Foretich said.
   ``Until we know my daughter is safe, the only tether we have to
her is Dr. Morgan's incarceration,'' said Foretich. ``I don't
derive any pleasure from seeing her in jail, but I need to know
where my little girl is.''
   Appeals court rulings in such cases can take up to two months.
None of the judges on the panel offered any indication when a
ruling would be issued.

   Troops opened fire on ethnic Turks
demonstrating in northeastern Bulgaria for more rights, and at
least two protesters were killed, state media said Wednesday.
   Exile sources in Vienna, Austria, and a diplomat in Sofia
indicated there were many more casualties in the violence last
weekend, although they could not give figures. Turkish newspapers
said as many as 25 people were killed in the clashes.
   Northeastern Bulgaria is home to most of the 900,000 ethnic
Turks in the Balkan country.
   The weekend disturbances were among the worst since a campaign
in the early 1980s by Bulgarian authorities to get ethnic Turks to
adopt Bulgarian-sounding names, restrict their Moslem religious
rites and bar the Turkish language in public.
   The unrest in Bulgaria highlighted the recent rise in ethnic
tensions throughout Eastern Europe. From the Soviet Union to
nonaligned communist Yugoslavia, ethnic minorities have rebelled
against discrimination and the denial of rights often enumerated in
national constitutions.
   The state-run news agency BTA said Wednesday that two people
were shot and killed by security forces and a third died of heart
failure during the clashes in the village of Todor Ikonomovo.
   Three other people, also believed to be ethnic Turks, were
injured in the village 187 miles east of Sofia, BTA said.
   In addition to the Todor Ikonomovo, riots also broke out in some
areas of the regions of Razgrad and Varna, according to BTA.
   The diplomat in Sofia, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the demonstration in Razgrad involved between 4,000 and 5,000
people, and 200 arrests were made.
   Authorities moved in tanks and helicopters after the clashes in
Razgrad, the diplomats said, and communications to the city were
cut. It was not known if they had been restored by Wednesday.
   He said he also heard of clashes between ethnic Turks and
security forces in Dulovo and Kaolinovo in the northeastern part of
the country.
   In Ankara, Turkey, Foreign Ministry spokesman Inal Batu told
reporters the government had formally asked Bulgaria for
information about the unrest.
   In Washington, the State Department condemned the crackdown on
ethnic Turks.
   ``We deplore Bulgaria's blatant use of force in attempting to
silence the long-repressed ethnic Turkish minority,'' a statement
said. ``We have repeatedly raised our objections in both bilateral
and international fora to the Bulgarian treatment of its ethnic
Turkish minority.''
   BTA did not refer to ethnic Turks in its report because
officially there is no Turkish minority in Bulgaria.
   ``Extremist-minded individuals, some under the influence of
alcohol, committed a gross violation of peace and tried to draw
groups of the population into acts of lawless violence,'' it said.
   It blamed the disturbances on ``inaccurate information provided
by some local authorities'' on recently eased travel laws, which
allegedly created ``misunderstandings among certain strata of the
population.''
   The new laws, passed by the Bulgarian parliament this month,
make it easier for the country's 8.9 million citizens to get a
passport and travel abroad. This would also include ethnic Turks
seeking to make trips to neighboring Turkey.
   The report did not say exactly how the alleged
``misunderstandings'' of the travel laws gave rise to the unrest.
   Emighre sources in Vienna said a protest hunger strike among
ethnic Turks that started May 6 has spread to several parts of
Bulgaria and is estimated to involve up to 300 people at a time.
   Turkey ruled Bulgaria for 500 years before 1863, and there is a
long history of conflict. Periodic unrest has been reported since
1984 in ethnic Turkish areas, and reports of growing protest have
circulated among diplomats in Sofia for at least a month.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's international debt
strategy has cleared a key hurdle by winning endorsement from the
board of directors of the International Monetary Fund, Treasury
Undersecretary David Mulford disclosed Wednesday.
   The approval was considered crucial to implementation of the
plan because both the IMF and its sister organization, the World
Bank, have key roles to play in the debt-reduction strategy, which
was unveiled by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady on March 10.
   Under the Brady plan, Third World debtor nations could tap
resources of the IMF and the World Bank to use an incentive to
encourage commercial banks to voluntarily forgive a portion of the
$1.2 trillion in debt being carried by developing countries.
   Mulford said the IMF agreement came at a closed meeting Tuesday
of the 22 members of the IMF's board of executive directors.
   ``In general terms, the agreement for the most part endorsed the
proposals put forward by the United States,'' Mulford said.
   The Brady plan envisions both reduction of total debt and
reduction of the interest burden countries must pay each year.
   Mulford said the IMF endorsed both of these concepts. He
predicted similar approval when the top executive body of the World
Bank takes up the proposal Tuesday.
   Mulford said he hoped the agreement to go forward with the Brady
plan would help in upcoming negotiations between debtor countries
and commercial banks, in particular in the current talks with
Mexico.
   Mulford told reporters that the precise sums could not be given
on the amounts that would be available for debt relief as nobody
knows how many countries will ask for help.
   Previously, the administration has used estimates that over the
next three years the plan could wipe out about $70 billion of the
$340 billion owed by 39 of the most heavily indebted countries.
   That estimate was based on an assumption that the IMF and the
World Bank would contribute together $20 billion to $25 billion to
back the debt-reduction effort.

   A high-tech smuggling operation based in Belgium
sought U.S. computers to bolster the Soviet air defense system
after a West German pilot landed in Moscow's Red Square on a lark,
a federal official said Wednesday.
   The disclosure by Patrick O'Brien, the Customs Service's top
agent in Miami, came as five people and two corporations were
indicted by a federal grand jury in a smuggling case involving $1.8
million worth of sensitive computer equipment.
   The federal government based its case on information from a
Dutch citizen caught working last year as an operative for the
Belgian-based network, O'Brien said.
   The informant, Eddy Haak, was told by others in the network
dealing on behalf of Soviet bloc countries that U.S. computers were
needed ``to shore up their air defense after they found that it was
ineffective and in disrepair. They discovered this when a West
German pilot landed in Red Square,'' O'Brien said after the
indictment was announced.
   Nineteen-year-old pilot Mathias Rust evaded Soviet air defenses
as he flew a small Cessna aircraft into Soviet air space, buzzed
the Kremlin and landed before a startled crowd in Red Square on May
28, 1987. He was imprisoned in the Soviet Union for 14 months.
   His unhindered penetration of Soviet air space resulted in a
shakeup of the Soviet military and, according to O'Brien, secret
orders for U.S. computers that could be used to prevent a
recurrence.
   Customs agents infiltrated the U.S. end of the smuggling ring
after Haak was lured to the United States and arrested, O'Brien
said. The indictment covers deals made with undercover Customs
agents who replaced the smugglers, O'Brien said.
   The indictment charges violation of the Export Administration
Act, which limits the export of sensitive U.S. materials, and
conspiracy to export two Digital Equipment Corp. VAX 8820 computer
systems via Canada to Bulgaria, a routine channel for Soviet bloc
procurements.
   The indictment named Steve Smylie, 39, and his wife, Carole, 36,
of Houston and their Technology International Consultants Inc.;
Warren Wetstein of Toronto and his Asset Conversion Specialists
Inc.; and computer company employees Jerry Blalock, 52, of Houston
and Rick Parish, 44, of Dallas.
   The four Texans were taken into custody last week, and Wetstein
is being sought in Canada, O'Brien said. The name of the suspected
Belgian ringleader has not been released.
   If convicted, the defendants face up to 15 years in federal
prison and up to $6.5 million in fines. The companies face up to
$6.8 million in fines.
   The computers listed in the indictment, described by Digital as
top-of-the-line, general-purpose equipment, were seized last week
in Colorado Springs, Colo., as they were being prepared for export.
   Haak, named as the intended buyer, recently was convicted in

   The House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday
narrowly defeated a Republican attempt to blunt the key capital
reform in President Bush's savings and loan bailout plan.
   The amendment, which failed on a 17-17 vote, would have allowed
some institutions to use administrative appeals to delay the
imposition of tougher capital standards for up to 18 months.
   Eleven Republicans and six Democrats supported the weakening
amedment, offered by Reps. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., and Lawrence J.
Smith, D-Fla. Three Republicans and 14 Democrats voted no. The
committee chairman, Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, abstained.
   The vote was the latest in a series by both the Judiciary panel
and House Banking Committee in which Bush has attracted more
Democratic than Republican support for preserving his proposed
reforms.
   The banking committee adopted its version of S&amp;L legislation
three weeks ago. The full House will likely consider it early next
month, along with alternatives to specific sections passed by other
committees.
   The House bill and legislation passed by the Senate last month
then would have to be reconciled in a conference between the two
chambers before a final product can be sent to the president's desk.
   ``We're very happy to see strong capital survive,'' said
Assistant Treasury Secretary David W. Mullins, one of the
architects of Bush's S&amp;L plan. ``But we have no illusions. We'll
have to fight it again and again and again. It's like one of those
cheap movies. The monster keeps coming back,'' he said.
   The key reform in the banking panel's bill would require S&amp;L
owners to risk $3 of ``real money'' or ``tangible'' capital for
every $100 they lend. Senate-passed legislation would require $1.50
in tangible capital for every $100 lent.
   Both versions would eliminate an accounting break known as
``supervisory goodwill.'' In the early 1980s, S&amp;L regulators
authorized some healthy S&amp;Ls to count goodwill as capital in
exchange for assuming the losses of ailing institutions.
   Hyde argued that it is unfair to ``change the rules in the
middle of the game'' and said that 152 institutions would have to
be considered insolvent unless they are permitted to continue
counting goodwill as capital.
   He would have required financial regulators to conduct hearings
under the Administrative Procedures Act for S&amp;L owners who believed
the government was reneging on an agreement by changing the rules
for counting goodwill.
   ``My amendment says ... you get a chance at due process before
we hold the funeral,'' he said.
   In other action, the Judiciary committee defeated on a voice
vote an attempt by Rep. William J. Hughes, D-N.J., to halve the
maximum proposed jail term for financial institution fraud from 20
years to 10 years and to eliminate sentencing guidelines calling
for jail terms for first offenders.

<HEAD>Congressmen Vow To Investigate Army's Handgun Contract</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two congressmen said Wednesday they would
investigate Pentagon selection of an Italian gunmaker over Smith &amp;
Wesson to make the military's chief handgun.
   The Army, for the second time in four years, selected Beretta
USA, a subsidiary of Armi Beretta SpA, over Smith &amp; Wesson of
Springfield, Mass. Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co. of Southport, Conn., also was
rejected by the Army.
   The Army on Monday said sample weapons submitted for testing by
Smith &amp; Wesson and Sturm, Ruger failed to meet minimum performance
requirements and the Beretta USA M-9 tested significantly better.
   ``I cannot say at this time that the tests were rigged, but my
hunting dog nose tells me that something might be amiss here,''
said Rep. Silvio O. Conte, R-Mass. ``I will not give up until I am
certain Smith &amp; Wesson is given a fair shake.''
   Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass, said he and Conte ``will scrutinize
every aspect of this competition. If there is a hint of any
irregularity, we'll insist on a full explanation and appropriate
corrective action.''
   ``We have not seen the test results yet, but I will insist upon
a full accounting by the Defense Department,'' he said.
   The latest competition was ordered by Congress after Conte and
former Democratic Rep. Edward P. Boland of Springfield, complained
that Beretta was unfairly awarded a contract in 1985 to build its
M-9 pistol as the replacement for the military's venerable Colt .45.
   The General Accounting Office agreed with the lawmakers that
Smith &amp; Wesson was improperly shut out of the final bidding process
for the original $75 million contract to build 315,000 pistols.
   The new contract competition is worth $9.9 million to build
56,705 guns, the Army said.
   ``The General Accounting Office on two separate occasions found
against the Army in favor of Smith &amp; Wesson,'' Conte said. ``The
(House) Government Operations Committee agreed that Smith &amp; Wesson
has previously been treated unfairly in technical
disqualifications, and here we are again. You can rest assured that
I will look into every aspect of this evaluation.''
   The Army, in its statement Monday, did not specify the problems
with the Smith &amp; Wesson or Sturm Ruger guns. Army officials said
they would brief the companies Thursday at the Aberdeen (Md.)
Proving Ground.
   The contract award comes in the wake of a series of problems
with the 140,000 Beretta pistols already delivered.
   Beretta, which opeates a plant in Accokeek, Md., where the guns
are assembled, agreed last summer to suspend deliveries while it
corrected a problem that led to a dangerous cracking of the gun's
chamber slide. Deliveries resumed earlier this month, according to
Beretta officials.
   The Army ordered reduced usage of the guns after a fifth
accident in which a chamber slide cracked, sending fragments toward
the shooter's chest.
   In March, the Navy said its SEAL commando forces would not
switch to the Beretta 9mm because of the slide failures.

   Southern leaders said Wednesday their new plan
to reduce the region's high rate of teen-age pregencies will go
beyond urging boys and girls to abstain from sex.
   ``To prevent adoloscent pregenancies in America, you have to do
a lot more than just educate adolescents about the dangers of
pregnancies,'' Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus said.
   ``You've got to start with early childhood education; you've got
to work on things such as life goals, self esteem, hope for the
future,'' he said. ``You've got to involve the community, you've
got to involve the parents, you've got to involve the boys as well
as the girls.''
   Mabus co-chairs the Southern Strategic Planning Group on
Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention, created a year ago by the Southern
Governors' Association and the Southern Legislative Conference.
   The report proposes a detailed blueprint for government,
business, church and civic leaders.
   ``Adolescents are more likely to get pregnant if they don't have
high expectations, don't think they will finish their education,
don't think there's a good job waiting, don't think their life
holds a lot for them,'' Mabus said.
   The panel proposed teaching life skills at the earliest possible
age through state and federal funding of early childhood education
programs; family curricula starting in kindergarten; corporate
incentives to keep kids in school; expanded public and private
efforts to improve jobs; help for adults who want to be better
parents; and better health care for young people.
   The report said 47 percent of the 178,000 births to U.S. girls
under age 17 in 1985 occurred in 17 Southern states, even though
only 37 percent of girls under 17 live in the region. Among girls
under 17 with second or higher order births that year, 49 percent
were in the South.
   New statistics gathered for the Southern Regional Project on
Infant Mortality show that Georgia led the region in 1987 with
29.62 pregnancies for every 1,000 girls between the ages of 10 and
17.
   North Carolina was second, with an adolescent pregnancy rate of
29.42, followed by South Carolina at 27.76, Mississippi at 26.92,
Arkansas at 26.02, Tennessee at 25.32, Alabama at 25.27, Virginia
at 25.18, Maryland at 25.41 and Missouri at 21.20.
   In six of those 10 states, the adolescent pregnancy rate was
higher in 1987 then in 1986, indicating that the decade-long trend
of slowly declining adolescent pregnancy rates in the South may be
reversing.

<HEAD>Governor's Signing Makes California Gun Law First In Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG WILLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California enacted the nation's first
statewide restrictions on the possession or sale of assault weapons
Wednesday when Gov. George Deukmejian signed two bills sparked by a
schoolyard massacre.
   The bills ban the sale of 55 semiautomatic assault rifles,
pistols and shotguns beginning Jan. 1. But they allow people who
currently own those weapons lawfully to keep them if they register
with the state.
   The legislation was prompted by a Jan. 17 attack at a Stockton
elementary school in which a deranged man with an AK-47 assault
rifle killed five children and wounded 30 other people before
taking his own life.
   The attack prompted similar bills in several states, including
Rhode Island, Louisiana, Michigan and Colorado, but California's
are the first to be passed and signed into law. The Louisiana bill
failed in committee Wednesday, and lawmakers there say it is
unlikely any gun control legislation will be adopted this year.
   Several cities, including Los Angeles, have enacted local
restrictions.
   ``These bills are not going to bring back to life the five
beautiful children who were killed on the schoolyard in Stockton,''
Deukmejian said during a Capitol bill-signing ceremony. ``I hope
they will help our courageous law enforcement community in fighting
violent crime.''
   Deukmejian, a Republican who is a longtime foe of gun control
measures, said he would also sign legislation requiring a 15-day
waiting period for all gun sales, but stressed that he still
opposes any further gun control.
   ``This legislation only bans specified weapons that are not
needed by individuals for their self-protection or recreation
purposes. They can still go hunting, they can still go target
shooting with many other guns,'' Deukmejian said.
   Despite those assurances, Deukmejian's signing of the two bills,
written by two Los Angeles Democrats, Senate President Pro Tem
David Roberti and Assemblyman Mike Roos, sparked immediate recall
threats.
   A lone picket stood in front of the Capitol with a sign saying
``Impeach Anti-Gun Traitors'' during the bill signing, and a
gun-owners group announced a recall drive against Deukmejian.
   The governor said he wasn't surprised or worried about the
recall threats.
   Roberti said he hoped California's restrictions will ``be a
leadership action (showing) what can be accomplished in
Washington.''
   ``I pledge this is just a beginning,'' said Roos. ``Today
clearly shows California's watershed position for the country when
it comes to crime control and control of violent weapons that
people unfortunately have had too easy access to.''

   In a further signal of improving relations,
Secretary of State James A. Baker III will meet in Rome this
weekend with South African Foreign Minister Roelof Botha, the State
Department said Wednesday.
   The meeting is part of an expansion of contacts planned by Bush
administration officials with leading South Africans both in and
out of government.
   A senior U.S. official, asking not to be identified, said the
mood between the two countries has improved partly as a result of
the U.S.-mediated agreement last December under which Cuba agreed
to the phased withdrawal of its forces from Angola and South Africa
consented to end its colonial role in Namibia.
   ``There is a greater atmosphere of confidence,'' the official
said.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler disclosed that
Baker will meet with Botha during a stopover in Rome prior to
attending the NATO summit meeting in Brussels.
   Last week, President Bush met with three anti-apartheid
activists, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond
Tutu. The administration also is planning to invite the leader of
South Africa's ruling National Party, F. W. de Klerk. Regular
meetings also are planned with representatives of the country's
main anti-apartheid group, the African National Congress.
   The new assistant secretary for African affairs, Herman Cohen,
hopes to visit South Africa within the next two months.
   The goal of the intensified U.S. diplomacy is to determine
whether the United States can help promote meaningful discussions
among South Africans toward the establishment of a system that will
give the majority black population political rights for the first
time.
   ``To the extent that the two sides can get together on a
framework, so much the better,'' a U.S. official said.
   He added that the December agreement negotiated by Cohen's
predecessor, Chester Crocker, is progressing well, with the
independence process in Namibia moving ahead and the Cuban troop
withdrawal being carried out on schedule.
   There are also inconclusive signs that Angola's Marxist
government may be interested for the first time in negotiating an
end to the 14-year civil war with U.S.-backed rebels.
   U.S.-South African relations were set back sharply by the
economic sanctions Congress imposed in 1986 and officials
acknowledged that the relationship is still ``traumatized'' by that
action.
   President Reagan vetoed the sanctions but was overridden by
Congress.

   President Bush has sent a new letter to the
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on the short-range missile
dispute in NATO as Bush's national security adviser said Wednesday
that ``time is running out'' for resolving the rift in the alliance.
   Bush sent the letter to Kohl late Tuesday evening and the German
leader intends to respond to the U.S. proposal ``as soon as
possible,'' a diplomatic source in Washington said.
   Officials on both sides of the Atlantic have been scrambling to
heal the rift in advance of a summit meeting of leaders of the 16
NATO countries in Brussels, Belgium, next week.
   The disagreement may continue to fester until the meeting, which
is Bush's first as the leader of the Western alliance and is
designed to mark the 40th anniversary of the founding of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   The leaders will gather amid a series of arms control proposals
by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that have enticed many in
Western Europe to question the need for updating NATO's nuclear
stockpile.
   Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, commented to
reporters as the president delivered the commencement address at
the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn.
   Asked if there had been progress in negotiations with the West
Germans, Scowcroft responded, ``Not measureably.''
   Queried whether that meant that the president would travel to
the summit without a solution, he said, ``Time is running out.''
   The national security adviser added that both sides were ``still
talking'' and that the United States had not given up on finding a
way out of the problem.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler confirmed
that the United States had responded to the West Germans, but she
refused to give any details of the U.S. reply.
   ``We're not negotiating in public; I just can't get into the
specifics,'' she said.
   She repeated Secretary of State James A. Baker III's expression
that the United States is ``hopeful'' that a compromise can be
reached prior to the summit meeting in Brussels.
   The controversy stems from a push by the United States and
Britain to update aging Lance surface-to-surface nuclear missiles,
most of which are based in West Germany.
   Public opinion in West Germany has turned against such a move,
and Kohl has pressed for an early round of U.S.-Soviet talks on the
missile, in part as a means of shoring up his domestic political
position.
   Baker told West German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg last
week that the United States accepted the idea of such negotiations
in principle, but has opposed opening any such talks until Warsaw
Pact forces are reduced. The Americans have also demanded that the
Germans oppose the total elimination of the weapons.
   If the short-range Lances were modernized, their range would be
tripled to just below 300 miles. All U.S. and Soviet missiles with
ranges between 300 and 3,000 miles were banned under a 1987 treaty.
   The U.S.-built Lances now can hit targets from about 75 miles
away.

<HEAD>Italian Printer Honored for Saving Jews from Holocaust</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERICH SMITH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nervous, white-haired printer from Italy
was honored Wednesday for having the courage to stand up to the
Nazi Holocaust and save thousands of Jews from death by printing
false documents for them.
   Trento Brizi and his town of Assisi are examples of what
ordinary people can do in the face of tyranny, said Harry Waldman,
chairman of the Graphic Arts Association, in a wreath-laying
ceremony at the city's Holocaust Memorial.
   The association invited Brizi to Philadelphia to receive its
third annual Freedom of the Press Award. The award, for
demonstrating commitment to a free and uncensored press and to the
basic human rights of all people, has gone to The Wall Street
Journal and Knight-Ridder newspapers in the past.
   With Brizi, 80, came the Rev. Aldo Brunacci and Mayor Edo
Romoli, representing the clergy and townspeople of Assisi.
   Assisi became an underground haven in 1943 as the Nazis were
intensifying their campaign to round up Jews in territories they
controlled.
   Assisi, the centuries-old home of St. Francis, had no Jewish
population of its own but became a haven for the hunted people. At
one point, according to Waldman, nearly half the people of Assisi
were hiding Jews sought for the concentration camps.
   Brizi, wounded in the war, came home to help his father, Luigi,
in the family print shop. The Rev. Ruffino Niccaci, an underground
leader, asked them to print false identity papers and transit visas
that would allow those in hiding to escape to safe lands.
   The father and son team used names from the Rome telephone book
and designed fake city seals as they thought they might look. They
counterfeited seals of cities under Allied control, making it
difficult for the Nazis to check them.
   They ran their printing shop by day and worked on the documents
by night, eventually printing documents for more than 5,000 Jewish
and political refugees. No one was ever captured with their false
documents, according to the printers' association.
   Brunacci helped distribute the fake papers, hiding them inside
the frame of his bicycle. The Assisi underground eventually
involved almost 500 priests, half the townspeople and the
cloistered nuns of the Convent of San Quirico.
   The nuns broke a 700-year-old tradition of not allowing men
inside the convent to hide Jewish refugees.
   ``Eighty to 85 percent of the Italian Jews survived because this
kind of thing was happening all over Italy,'' Waldman said. ``In
the rest of Europe, 80 percent of the Jews were killed.''
   Brunacci and Rabbi Max Hausen placed the floral wreath bearing
the message ``Assisi Remembers,'' at the foot of the 20-foot statue
of twisted, intertwined arms and legs.
   Luigi Brizi died in 1969, his deeds never officially recognized.
Trento Brizi, who still operates the family business, accepted a
plaque but didn't speak at the morning ceremony.
   ``I was nervous when I got up this morning, but I'm all right,
now,'' he said through an interpreter as television cameras bustled
around him and city traffic roared by.
   He said he clearly remembers working in the night, hiding what
he and his father were doing from the Nazi occupiers.
   ``At that time, none of us was really sure how it would all come
out,'' he said.
   Why did he and the people of Assisi take such a great risk to
save the Jews?
   ``We felt we had to do something,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soviet Ideology Chief Speaks About Multiparty System</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vadim Medvedev, the Kremlin's top ideologist, was
quoted Wednesday as saying he saw no contradiction between a
multiparty system and a communist state, but that the Soviet Union
is not ready for such a system.
   Medvedev, secretary for ideology in the Soviet Communist Party
Central Committee, said in an interview in the daily Le Monde it
was necessary ``to maintain the force for integration that the
(Communist) party represents in the present state of development,
in the extreme complexity and diversity of perestroika.''
   Perestroika, the Russian word for restructuring, has been the
hallmark of the rule of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Medvedev was quoted as saying that ``efforts to weaken'' the
party ``by putting other political forces and organizations up
against it'' were aimed at ``blocking perestroika.''
   Asked why Soviet television did not at first report on the
massive demonstrations in Tiananmen Square during Gorbachev's visit
to Beijing, Medvedev said the Soviets did not want to give the
impression they were ``trying to influence internal events in the
host country.''
   On the process of ``diversification'' underway in such East bloc
nations as Poland and Hungary, Medvedev was quoted as saying that
Moscow approved of what was taking place and was encouraging the
changes.
   ``We consider it irreversible,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Medvedev also said he believed in the market as a factor in the
economy and that socialist states should not reject lessons learned
from capitalism just because it was another system.
   He refused to discuss rivalries within the ruling Politburo,
saying only that ``lively discussions'' took place. He denied there
were different factions within the Politburo.

   A teen-ager who says she had sex with U.S.
Rep. Donald Lukens testified Wednesday that the congressman paid
her $40 and gave her a birthday gift after going to bed with him
last year.
   Rosie Coffman said Lukens knew she was not 19, as she had
professed to be. She was 16 at the time.
   ``When I told him that I was 19, he looked and sort of laughed
and said, `No, not really,''' Ms. Coffman testified on the third
day of Lukens' trial.
   The 58-year-old Republican, who is divorced, is charged with
contributing to the unruliness or delinquency of a minor, stemming
from the alleged meeting at his Columbus apartment last November.
   If convicted of the misdemeanor, Lukens could be sentenced to
180 days in jail and fined $1,000.
   He appeared agitated when Ms. Coffman described in graphic
detail a sexual encounter that she said she had with Lukens. At one
point, he clenched both fists and hit his knees. He repeatedly
shook his head and scowled.
   Ms. Coffman said she first met Lukens in 1985 and did not see
him again until the night of Nov. 6, 1988, when she and a friend,
Michelle Foster, visited him at Ms. Foster's suggestion. Ms. Foster
was 19.
   Lukens greeted the two at the door wearing boxer shorts, and
gave Ms. Coffman a $20 bill to pay their cab driver, Ms. Coffman
said. She said Lukens recognized her but not Ms. Foster.
   Ms. Coffman said took them to a downstairs guest room.
   ``He told us to get undressed and put on ... two black robes,''
Ms. Coffman said. She asked him why they could not wear two white
robes she saw in the room.
   ``He said those were for white people ... other kind of
people,'' she said.
   Ms. Coffman and Ms. Foster are black. Lukens is white.
   Ms. Coffman testified that she and Ms. Foster got into bed with
Lukens. ``He started talking nasty,'' she said.
   Lukens then sent Ms. Foster out of the room, Ms. Coffman said.
She testified that she then performed oral sex on Lukens and had
intercourse with him twice.
   She said Lukens gave her two $20 bills and paid Ms. Foster $30.
   Ms. Coffman said Lukens also gave her a glass of brandy and two
gifts _ a pink lace fan and a silver pillbox _ and gave Ms. Foster
a bottle of perfume and a diamond pendant.
   Ms. Coffman testified later in the day that she went to Lukens'
apartment to talk to him about how she felt about him in 1985, when
she first met the congressman. A court order has prevented either
side from examining what happened in 1985 at length. Testimony has
only included allegations that Lukens gave her alcohol at that time.
   She said that ``when I got to the door (and made) eye contact, I
felt the same feeling I had inside for him from the first time I
was over there. It was like, should I say love and hate?''
   Earlier Wednesday, defense attorney Thomas Tyack attacked the
testimony of the girl's mother, Anna Coffman, and tried to depict
her as continually unemployed and desperate for notoriety and money.
   WSYX-TV broadcast on Feb. 1 a secretly recorded videotape that
apparently shows Lukens offering Mrs. Coffman a government job
after she asked him why he was ``messing around'' with her
daughter. The Nov. 11, 1988, meeting at a Columbus restaurant was

   WSYX reporter Ted Hart, who arranged the videotaping of the

   Texas death row inmates expressed worry
Wednesday after a fellow prisoner was executed for a 1981
abduction, rape and slaying because his case sailed through appeals
courts without even a temporary stay.
   Stephen McCoy, a 40-year-old electrician from Houston, was
pronounced dead at 12:25 a.m. Wednesday, seven minutes after a
lethal mixture of drugs was injected into his arms.
   McCoy lost a final appeal late Tuesday when the U.S. Supreme
Court voted 5-4 to deny a stay without further comment. The appeal
was McCoy's first to reach the high court and it has been routine
for initial appeals to merit at least one reprieve.
   ``The significance of this is the courts very clearly are
indicating impatience with dilatory tactics within the process and
they intend to expedite the process,'' said state Attorney General
Jim Mattox, who witnessed the execution and predicted the pace of
executions in Texas would accelerate.
   McCoy's execution was the 31st in Texas and the 110th in the
nation since the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing states to
resume use of the death penalty. Texas has had the most executions,
followed by Florida with 21 and Louisiana with 18.
   ``We anticipate the length between the time of conviction and
execution will grow shorter,'' Mattox said. ``Legitimate issues
(for appeals) are getting fewer and fewer.''
   ``Things never look good for death row inmates,'' condemned
prisoner Lester Bower said Wednesday. ``Things look especially poor
now. We're running out of generic issues to bring to the Supreme
Court.''
   ``The fact he could not (get a stay) changes the seriousness of
everyone,'' added Jim Vanderbilt, another inmate.
   ``They sure zipped it through fast,'' said prisoner James
Beathard. ``It's a bad precedent.''
   McCoy was convicted in the murder of Cynthia Johnson, 18, who
was abducted by McCoy and two other men from her car after it broke
down on a Houston freeway as she was returning home from a New
Year's Eve party.
   McCoy, who had insisted he was in another room when the woman
was slain, made no final statement. He smiled briefly to four
friends he invited to the execution. He coughed and his chest
heaved five times as the drugs began to take effect, then uttered
two long, low groans before he stopped breathing.

<HEAD>French Doctors Partially Withdraw Claim About Toxic Gas in Soviet
Georgia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French humanitarian group said Wednesday it was
withdrawing part of its claim about the use of toxic gas during
street protests in Soviet Georgia last month in which 19 people
were killed.
   A statement issued Tuesday by Medecins sans Frontiers (Doctors
Without Borders) said autopsies on 16 victims identified
Chloropicrine as one of the gases.
   On Wednesday, the organization said its doctors were denied full
access to Soviet autopsy reports, but laboratory analysis of the
substance allegedly used in Tbilisi to disperse 10,000 protesters
April 9 revealed Chloropicrine.
   ``Chrloropicrine is a highly toxic substance used widely during
World War I in combat,'' Dr. Benoit Nemery, a Belgian toxicoligist,
told reporters in a telephone connection with a news conference at
the group's Paris headquarters.
   ``It is highly probable that it was used, but until we have the
results of a biological analysis performed on an organ of a victim
it is impossible to say with complete certitude,'' he said.
   Doctors Without Borders said a Georgian doctor invited Dr. Barry
Rumack of Denver, Colo., representing Physicians For Human Rights,
to analyze a small container of gas the Georgian said had been used
on the protesters.
   The four-member French team worked with American and Georgian
doctors and representatives of the Georgian Health Ministry.
   Chloropicrine was approved in the Soviet Union for use as a tear
gas until 1981, when it was reclassified as a ``suffocant'' or
asphyxiating gas for combat use, the French organization said.
Soviet authorities have denied toxic gas was used to disperse the
protesters.
   Members of the French team said they learned through Soviet
doctors that two victims showed no signs of external physical
trauma and death probably was due to inhaling gases, but both
victims had burned lungs and the doctors concluded ordinary tear
gas would not cause such damage.
   The doctors said they examined and questioned hundreds of
witnesses and victims. They said many people had been admitted to
hospitals with symptoms common to trauma victims.
   ``Children came staggering in, unable to walk straight,
complaining about intense fatigue, nauseau, dizziness,
irritability, anxiety, depression and indigestion,'' said Dr.
Pierre Barel, a lung and heart specialist.
   ``Waves of people'' began pouring into doctors' offices and
hospitals on May 17, he said, which was 40 days after the event.
Barel said not all of them had been gassed.
   ``That corresponds to the end of the period of mourning for
(Russian) Orthodox,'' he said. ``They ... showed some of the same
symptoms of the people who had been in the streets on April 9.''
   Hundreds of other people were admitted to hospitals long after
the clash, believing they were suffering from secondary effects of
the toxic gas, but Barel said they showed no evidence of nerve
damage.

   The U.N. Economic and Social Council voted
Wednesday to hold an anti-crime conference in Cuba. The United
States cast the only dissenting vote and has said it would boycott
the meeting.
   Fifty-one of the 54 members of the council, one of the six major
U.N. organs, voted to hold the conference in Cuba. Two delegations
were absent.
   The U.N. Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment
of Offenders is to begin Aug. 27, 1990, with the purpose of
promoting cooperation against all forms of crime.
   Arthur Zegelbone, a spokesman for the U.S. Mission, said
American opposition was based partly on Cuba's failure to sign the
Montreal and Hague conventions against aircraft hijackings. He said
Washington also was concerned about human rights violations in Cuba.
   A U.N. human rights report last year said Fidel Castro's
government holds political prisoners and commits human rights
abuses, mainly against religious groups.
   The U.N. observers found far fewer prisoners than Washington had
said, however, and Cuba claimed to be vindicated by the report.
   Amnesty International, a human rights organization based in
London, said Cuba held at least 600 such prisoners at the end of
1987.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering has said the United States
would boycott an anti-crime conference in Havana.
   The Economic and Social Council coordinates economic and social
work of the United Nations and its specialized agencies.

<HEAD>Etan Patz Case Still Active 10 Years Later</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten years ago Thursday, 6-year-old Etan Patz,
walking alone for the first time to his school bus, vanished from
the streets of lower Manhattan. Police and his parents still get
reports of purported sightings of him.
   But despite extensive publicity, a $25,000 reward and
photographs of the boy plastered all over the city, Etan has not
been found.
   The case, No. 8367, is still open, and there have been thousands
of leads, so many of them credible that investigators have been to
every state and some foreign countries.
   But ``the odds are very, very much against Etan being alive,''
said Lt. Robert Davis of the Police Department's Missing Persons
Squad.
   ``It has never happened in the history of this department that a
person missing that long has been found alive,'' said Davis, who
was one of the many officers who canvassed the Soho neighborhood
where Etan vanished.
   Most children abducted by strangers, which is what the police
believe happened to Etan, are killed ``right away,'' Davis added.
   Etan's parents, Stanley and Julie Patz, whose faces were almost
as familiar around the city as their missing son's because of their
willingness to be interviewed, said Wednesday they had decided not
to talk with reporters about the anniversary.
   The thousands of interviews the couple had granted ``have not
been helpful and it's intrusive, it cuts into our privacy,'' Patz
said.
   The Patzes have two other children, Shira, now 18, and Ari, 12.
   Patz told The Associated Press he doesn't agree with the police.
``I think he's still alive, but there's not much evidence to
support that, it's an article of faith,'' he said.
   Davis said his squad still receives ``two to three sightings a
week on Etan,'' from all over the country. The lieutenant predicted
his squad will get more calls because of news stories about the
anniversary.
   The Patz family also receives calls from cranks and psychics
about their son. ``There's a hard core out there,'' Patz sighed.
   ``We live with it every day, this is just a worse week than
others,'' he added. The parents speak weekly with Detective Robert
Shaw, who handles the case, police said.
   Interest in the case still remains strong. ``It has captured the
public's imagination like no other case,'' said Davis.
   When asked why, he shook his head. ``If I could answer that, I
think I could solve the case,'' he said.

   Federal programs allowing livestock grazing
and hay cutting on land taken out of production under this year's
crop acreage programs have been expanded in Kansas, Nebraska and
Iowa, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter announced Wednesday.
   ``I'm encouraged by the rain that has fallen in the Midwestern
and Great Plains growing areas in the past week,'' Yeutter said.
``In many places the drought has broken. However, the additional
relief actions taken today will help reduce livestock sell-offs in
areas where haying and grazing conditions are still not adequate.''
   Yeutter said he will allow statewide emergency haying and
grazing of cropland normally held out of production under 1989
commodity programs in states where 75 percent of the counties have
been designated as already eligible for haying and grazing.
   States which meet that requirement are Kansas, Nebraska and
Iowa, he said. Other states will be added when they meet the 75
percent criterion. Yeutter also relaxed the department's forage
sales policy so producers in eligible counties can sell forage from
the conservation land at full market prices instead of at levels
only to recover harvest costs, which is the current policy.
   ``Rain is predicted for much of the Midwest and Great Plains
areas in the next several days, which could prove to be extremely
beneficial for those growing areas,'' he said. ``The USDA drought
task force will continue to monitor ... situations on a daily basis
and forward additional recommendations to me if and when the
situation warrants it.''
   In his latest actions, Yeutter stopped short of approving
requests from some farm leaders who wanted him to open up for
haying and grazing millions of acres taken from production under
the 10-year Conservation Program. Dozens of states were made
eligible to cut hay from CRP land in last year's drought, but none
has been approved for 1989.
   Kelly Shipp, Yeutter's press secretary, said: ``We have not
ruled out opening up CRP. It's just at this point we think that it
is prudent to watch that very carefully.''
   Asked if some additional states might be near the 75 percent
level required for statewide haying and grazing approval on idled
program land, Shipp said that Missouri would be the closest, with
around 50 percent or so of the counties currently eligible.

<HEAD>U.N. Rebukes South Africa's Claim of Namibia Rule</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United Nations on Wednesday rebuked
South Africa for claiming it has primary authority over Namibia
until the country gains full independence in November.
   In a private briefing with the Security Council,
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar stressed that the United
Nations has ultimate authority over military affairs in Namibia,
diplomats who attended the meeting said on condition of anonymity.
   The U.N. chief drew a clear line between South Africa's
responsibility for local law enforcement and the Security Council's
authority over any potential call-up of the territorial militia or
the South African army, they said.
   In a letter to the United Nations, South African Foreign Minster
R.F. Botha said that responsibility for the administration of
Namibia through independence is the primary task of the South
African-appointed administrator-general. That includes
responsibility for maintaining law and order in the territory,
Botha said in his letter, dated May 19.
   South Africa agreed to a U.N.-mediated independence for Namibia
that began April 1 and is to culminate in elections Nov. 1. But the
process was interrupted the day it began when hundreds of armed
guerrillas from the South-West People's Organization crossed into
Namibia from Angola. In subsequent fighting, 316 guerrillas and 27
South African security force members were killed.
   Both said the administrator-general, Louis Pienaar, ``has the
right to use such measures and means as he would deem appropriate
to counter activities of an aggressive, violent or intimidatory
nature emanating from whatever quarter.''
   But African diplomats said they were concerned Pienaar would
feel free to recall the army to handle any new incursions by SWAPO,
the main rebel group in the territory.
   Under accords signed in December by South Africa, Cuba and
Angola, Pretoria pledged to cooperate with the plan to make Namibia
an independent black majority-ruled nation.
   Under the U.N. timetable, the 50,000 South African soldiers in
Namibia were to withdraw by July 1, leaving only 1,500 troopers
confined to base. South Africa's U.N. Mission said Wednesday that
their numbers in Namibia will be cut to 1,500 a week before the
July 1 deadline.

   Intense thunderstorms Wednesday brought large hail and brief
heavy rain to sections of Minnesota and northern Missouri, and
temperatures climbed to record highs in Texas and Florida.
   Hail as big as golf balls fell in Minnesota at Staples, near
Olivia, at Melrose and at Pequot Lakes. In Missouri, hail the
diameter of quarters was reported near Macon.
   Showers and thunderstorms also developed across Florida.
One-inch hail fell in Homestead.
   An area of low pressure off the coast of New Jersey produced
showers and some thunderstorms across eastern New York state and
New England. Rain was locally heavy with Hartford, Conn., getting
nearly 4.5 inches of rain in 24 hours. Poughkeepsie, N.Y., got 1.02
inches of rain in the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT.
   Showers fell along the northern Pacific Coast, with snow across
the Cascade Mountains.
   Temperatures climbed to 100 degrees across western Texas,
reaching a record for the date of 100 at Lubbock and 107 at
Midland. Florida also heated up with a record 94 degrees at Miami
and 95 at West Palm Beach.
   But cool air chilled the Pacific Northwest. Yakima, Wash., had a
record low of 30 degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 32
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 105 at Lubbock,
Texas. Wednesday's low in the 48 contiguous states was 19 degrees
at Truckee, Calif.
   For Thursday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the Great Lakes to the Ohio Valley, the middle Mississippi
Valley, and the eastern Gulf Coast. Showers were forecast from the
Pacific Northwest into eastern Montana.
   Highs in the 50s and 60s were predicted from the central and
northern Pacific Coast to the northern and central Rockies, much of
the northern Plains, northern Minnesota and upper Michigan; in the
90s from the desert Southwest to southern New Mexico, much of Texas
and the lower Mississippi Valley, and in Florida and southern
Georgia; between 100 and 105 degrees in southwestern Texas and
southern Arizona; and generally in the 70s and 80s in the rest of
the nation.

<TEXT>
   A joint panel on sensitive areas in
Polish-Soviet history says the Soviet foreign minister's comments
after Poland was invaded in 1939 were ``contradictory to
international law and offensive to Poland.''
   A report called ``Origins and Beginning of World War II'' was
published Wednesday in the Communist Party newspaper Trybuna Ludu,
which said it appeared simultaneously in Pravda, the Soviet party
newspaper.
   It includes a reference to the Aug. 23, 1939, Hitler-Stalin
non-aggression pact and the secret protocol attached to it defining
how the Nazis and Soviets would divide Poland.
   World War II began with the German invasion of Poland Sept. 1,
1939, the day after the Supreme Soviet ratified the agreement.
Soviet soldiers invaded from the east Sept. 17.
   Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov told the Supreme Soviet a
month later that the two armies had wiped out ``this grotesque
product of the Treaty of Versailles,'' the report said.
   Molotov's statement was ``contradictory to international law and
offensive to Poland,'' the report declared. ``The present Soviet
leadership and the scientific community of the Soviet Union
distance themselves decisively from it.''
   Western historians learned of the secret protocol from captured
Nazi documents. The report published Wednesday said the original
could not be found in Soviet or other archives.
   It also said a Soviet goverment statement handed to the Polish
ambassador Sept. 17, 1939, declaring the Polish state to be no
longer in existence was ``discrepant with the norms of
international law.''
   That statement said Soviet forces entered Poland only to protect
the inhabitants of Western Byelorussia and the Ukraine.
   ``The course of events connected with the movement of the Red
Army in September 1939 to the west requires more detailed
historical studies,'' the joint report said.
   Wojciech Ziembinski, a Roman Catholic journalist and historian,
said the report only complicates the process of resolving
historical discrepancies.
   ``This does not satisfy the Polish nation in any case and
certainly does not satisfy Polish historians. This document will
receive my reply, although I don't know how it will be with the
censorship,'' said Ziembinski, who has written extensively on
Polish-Soviet relations in World War II.
   Two years ago, authorities banned an article by Ziembinski on
Nazi-Soviet cooperation in partitioning Poland.
   For Poles, the sorest points of mutual history are the murder of
more than 4,000 Polish officers in the Katyn Forest and the
internment of at least 10,000 more in Soviet prison camps.
   Official Polish and Soviet histories say the Nazis killed the
officers in 1941, but many Poles and Western historians believe the
Soviets killed them in 1940.
   The commission, established two years ago, has yet to deliver
its findings on the Katyn massacre, but a Soviet popular magazine
recently raised the possibility that the Soviets were responsible.

<HEAD>Governor Signs Future Ban on Vehicles Cooled By CFCs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vermont on Wednesday became the first
state to ban vehicles that use ozone-depleting chemicals in their
air conditioning.
   ``Americans are ready to take tough actions to protect our
fragile environment, even if it requires changing our own behavior
or giving up certain luxuries,'' Gov. Madeleine Kunin said in
signing the legislation into law.
   ``By enacting this important legislation, Vermonters are
demonstrating that we are willing to act immediately to protect the
stratospheric ozone layer,'' she said.
   The ban covers the sale or registration of 1993 models that use
chlorofluorocarbons, a class of chemical blamed for destroying the
ozone layer that protects the Earth from the sun's harmful
ultraviolet rays.
   Car air conditioning systems are the single largest source of
ozone depletion from the United States.
   The legislation takes other, more immediate steps to reduce CFC
emissions:
   _ Starting in 1991, equipment used to service air conditioners
in vehicles must recycle the CFC coolant, rather than release it
into the atmosphere.
   _ As of March 1, 1990, CFC recycling equipment must be used to
service building air conditioners and large refrigeration units if
such equipment is ``portable and suitable for those purposes.''
   _ The sale of CFC recharge kits will be prohibited so that
consumers cannot circumvent the law's recycling requirements by
servicing their own cars' air conditioning systems.
   _ The sale of CFC-based fire extinguishers, consumer cleaning
sprays and CFC-propelled party streamers and horns is also
prohibited.
   Despite years of research into a replacement coolant, the
nation's Big Three automakers have said they doubt they can meet
the 1993 deadline.
   ``There is no way any manufacturer will be able to modify its
entire car line for Vermont in essentially three years,'' Ford
Motor Co. spokeswoman Beryl Goldsweig said earlier this month.

   Five high school students were charged
Wednesday with sexually assaulting a 17-year-old mentally retarded
girl while eight other students watched, authorities said.
   Two of those arrested were charged as juveniles, and Essex
County Prosecutor Herbert Tate said additional arrests were
possible.
   ``We are satisfied that this was a non-consensual sexual assault
by these five males against this young woman,'' Tate said at a news
conference. ``She didn't understand the nature and quality of her
actions.''
   Tate said the hour-long assault took place March 1 after the
students met the girl in a Glen Ridge park and brought her to the
nearby home of two of those charged, 18-year-old twins Kevin and
Kyle Scherzer, whose parents were away.
   The girl was assaulted with a small baseball bat and a
broomstick in the Scherzer basement, Tate said. There was no sexual
intercourse, he said.
   Kevin Scherzer was released on $25,000 bail, Kyle Scherzer was
freed on $20,000 bail, and Peter Quigley, 18, posted $15,000 bail.
   A 17-year-old and another student who has since turned 18 faced
similar charges, but in juvenile court, where the disposition of
their cases were not made public.
   The Scherzers are co-captains of the school football team, and
Kyle Scherzer is captain of the baseball team at Glen Ridge High
School.
   Glen Ridge is a wealthy suburban community of about 8,000 people
about five miles northwest of Newark.

   Soldiers reported they were fired at Wednesday
in Bethlehem, and five Palestinians were sentenced to prison for
their roles in a stone-throwing riot in which a Jewish guard
accidentally killed an Israeli teen-ager.
   The shooting attack was the second reported against Israeli
security forces in Bethlehem in two days. No one was hurt in either
incident.
   The attacks have fueled concern over Palestinian threats to step
up violence against Israeli targets by using guns. A police van was
hit in Monday's shooting.
   Soldiers on Wednesday carried out two in a series of more than
30 pre-dawn raids on West Bank villages this week, in which dozens
of suspected Palestinian activists have been arrested.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens accused Secretary of State James A.
Baker III of harming the chances of Israel's peace plan and
breaking the practice of not speaking publicly about U.S.-Israeli
disagreements.
   In a Nablus military court, five Palestinians were convicted and
jailed in connection with the death of 15-year-old Tirza Porat.
   The death caused a furor in Israel last year because of the
conflicting explanations of what happened. Jewish settlers claimed
the girl was stoned to death or shot by Palestinians who attacked
her and fellow settlers while they were on a hike in the West Bank.
   But the army later said she was shot accidentally by an Israeli
guard who was hit by a stone during the April 6, 1988 rioting in
Beita village.
   In court, the five defendants confessed to crimes in the
incident, in which the Israelis shot and killed two Palestinians.
   Haled Hassin Abed Benishams, 19, was sentenced to four years'
jail for forcing the hikers into a violent situation and attempting
to stab the guard. His companions were sentenced to terms of
between 18 months and two years for throwing stones and threatening
the hikers.
   In El-Azariya near Jerusalem, two settlers from nearby Maaleh
Adumim were slightly injured late Wednesday night when their car
came under an Arab stone-throwing attack.
   Hundreds of angry settlers demonstrated after the attack, the
second in the area in four days. They tried to stage a revenge raid
on El-Azariya but were blocked by troops, the national news agency
Itim said.
   A firebomb was thrown at a settler's car as it passed the West
Bank village of Biddya, 16 miles east of Tel Aviv. No one was
injured, but the car was totally gutted by the flames, Israel radio
said.
   The army on Wednesday asked for an additional $233 million to
put down the 17-month uprising against Israeli occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. It is the same amount that was cut when
the military's $5.89 billion allotment was approved in February.
   In the latest army offensive, Arab reports said, troops
Wednesday deported to Jordan six women and 10 children because the
women overstayed permits allowing them to visit their Palestinian
husbands.
   They were discovered in a raid at Al Amari refugee camp. The
army confirmed several people were expelled to Jordan.
   Chris George of Montclair, N.J., an aid worker with Save the
Children, was detained for three hours because he lives near the
camp.
   George, 35, said he saw several of 300 men detained in a
schoolyard kicked and slapped, and heard screams from a bus after
soldiers took three Palestinian refugees into the vehicle.
   The army said soldiers ``had to use some force'' when one
detainee tried to grab a soldier's gun.
   Elsewhere in the territories, Israeli soldiers shot and wounded
13 people in clashes with stone-throwing Palestinians, Arab
hospital officials said.
   Since the start of the revolt, 497 Palestinians and 22 Israelis
have been killed.
   Arens returned home Wednesday from a visit to Washington and
Europe to promote an Israeli peace plan aimed at ending the
uprising.
   He told reporters he was concerned about Baker's statement
Monday urging Israel to stop building Jewish settlements in the
occupied territories and to forget about annexing them.
   ``Mr. Baker's speech may make it more difficult ... to get
European support for the plan,'' said Arens. ``The things that were
expressed publicly were harmful to the state of Israel.''
   The plan calls for electing Palestinians to negotiate with
Israel on self-rule in the territories, with talks in three years
on the final status of the occupied lands. Palestinians oppose the
plan because it does not offer independence or Israeli withdrawal.

<HEAD>House Debates Higher Anti-Drug, Veterans Spending</HEAD>

   The House voted Wednesday to pump an extra
$822 million into federal efforts this year against illegal drugs,
but decided not to increase anti-drug spending even more by taking
money out of the Star Wars research budget.
   On a party-line 227-197 vote in which the chamber's majority
Democrats prevailed, the House finally passed a $3.7 billion
domestic spending measure for fiscal 1989 that included $822
million for anti-drug efforts. The legislation was a pared-down
version of a $4.7 billion bill the House refused to pass a month
ago.
   But on a 213-205 vote, lawmakers rejected a measure that would
have transferred to next year's drug programs any 1990 spending for
Star Wars missile defense research above this year's $3.7 billion.
President Bush has sought nearly $900 million more for Star Wars in
fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1.
   On a 409-0 vote, the House then reiterated its support for a
$1.2 billion measure for hard-pressed veterans programs, a bill
that has bounced back and forth between Congress' two chambers
because of a dispute between them over pet projects. The vote sent
the legislation back to the Senate, which has approved a smaller
version.
   The Democratic effort to bolster anti-drug initiatives was
opposed by the Bush administration and put Republicans in the
politically embarrassing position of having to vote against higher
drug spending. House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., called
the two measures containing the drug funds ``a two-headed
malodorous swamp animal.''
   Nonetheless, GOP lawmakers argued the extra money for drug
programs could wait until next year and would add even more red ink
to the federal deficit. They also insisted that spending for
anti-missile research should not be whittled down.
   ``Nobody's opposed to putting more money for drugs,'' said
Silvio Conte of Massachusetts, ranking Republican on the House
Appropriations Committee. ``What we are opposed to is the
irresponsible way we're doing it.''
   But Democrats argued that Congress should provide money for the
Anti-Drug Abuse Act enacted last year and finance a struggle
against drug traffickers that President Bush emphasized during his
campaign last year.
   ``Let's put our resources behind this war,'' said Rep. Jim
Chapman, D-Texas.
   The domestic spending bill contained $822 million for new
prisons, extra law officers and other anti-drug initiatives. It
included $893 million for the Guaranteed Student Loan program for
college students, $423 million for state-run foster care programs,
$342 million for the costs of battling last year's Western forest
fire, and money for other programs.
   It also contains a provision that would grant the Latrobe
Brewing Co. a temporary exemption from a federal law that requires
alcoholic beverage containers to carry health warnings. Latrobe had
complained that the painted labels on the beer it brews, Rolling
Rock, would be too expensive to alter. The measure was sponsored by
Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., whose district includes Latrobe, Pa.
   On April 26, a $4.7 billion version of the measure failed to
gain House approval after lawmakers voted down a plan by Democratic
leaders to pay for the bill by cutting domestic and defense
programs by 0.57 percent.
   The separate measure to transfer spending from Star Wars to
federal drug initiatives was sponsored by a trio of Democratic
liberals: Les AuCoin of Oregon, George Miller of California and
Marty Russo of Illinois. It would freeze 1990 Star Wars spending at
the 1989 level of $3.7 billion, and transfer the amount by which
that program was to grow _ $862 million _ to next year's drug
efforts.
   Last Thursday, the House took the $1.2 billion for veterans out
of the domestic spending bill after Republicans, the Bush
administration and veterans groups complained that disputes over
other portions of the legislation were bogging down the veterans
funds.
   The House then passed the separate $1.2 billion veterans bill,
which provides money for health care, a cost-of-living benefits
increase and other programs run by the Department of Veterans
Affairs.
   Several hours later, however, the Senate approved a different
version of the bill, providing only enough money for veterans
initiatives through June 15, or about $75 million. The Senate then
left on its Memorial Day recess, which lasts until May 31.
   Senators argued that by saving most of the needed veterans money
for a later bill, they could attach to that measure spending for
programs they favor. Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., of the Senate
Appropriations Committee singled out $6.6 million needed this year
for a program that subsidizes airlines serving remote communities.
   Members of the House objected to this Wednesday, claiming that
veterans would suffer so the Senate could win approval for programs
it favors.
   ``The Senate won't release the veterans as hostages,'' Conte
said.
   The $1.2 billion for veterans was also included in the House's
larger domestic spending bill. House members argued that by putting
the money in both measures, it enhanced their bargaining position
for upcoming negotiations with the Senate on the legislation.

   A joint panel on sensitive areas in
Polish-Soviet history says the Soviet foreign minister's comments
after Poland was invaded in 1939 were ``contradictory to
international law and offensive to Poland.''
   A report called ``Origins and Beginning of World War II'' was
published Wednesday in the Communist Party newspaper Trybuna Ludu,
which said it appeared simultaneously in Pravda, the Soviet party
newspaper.
   It includes a reference to the Aug. 23, 1939, Hitler-Stalin
non-aggression pact and the secret protocol attached to it defining
how the Nazis and Soviets would divide Poland.
   World War II began with the German invasion of Poland Sept. 1,
1939, the day after the Supreme Soviet ratified the agreement.
Soviet soldiers invaded from the east Sept. 17.
   Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov told the Supreme Soviet a
month later that the two armies had wiped out ``this grotesque
product of the Treaty of Versailles,'' the report said.
   Molotov's statement was ``contradictory to international law and
offensive to Poland,'' the report declared. ``The present Soviet
leadership and the scientific community of the Soviet Union
distance themselves decisively from it.''
   Western historians learned of the secret protocol from captured
Nazi documents. The report published Wednesday said the original
could not be found in Soviet or other archives.
   It also said a Soviet goverment statement handed to the Polish
ambassador Sept. 17, 1939, declaring the Polish state to be no
longer in existence was ``discrepant with the norms of
international law.''
   That statement said Soviet forces entered Poland only to protect
the inhabitants of Western Byelorussia and the Ukraine.
   ``The course of events connected with the movement of the Red
Army in September 1939 to the west requires more detailed
historical studies,'' the joint report said.
   Wojciech Ziembinski, a Roman Catholic journalist and historian,
said the report only complicates the process of resolving
historical discrepancies.
   ``This does not satisfy the Polish nation in any case and
certainly does not satisfy Polish historians. This document will
receive my reply, although I don't know how it will be with the
censorship,'' said Ziembinski, who has written extensively on
Polish-Soviet relations in World War II.
   Two years ago, authorities banned an article by Ziembinski on
Nazi-Soviet cooperation in partitioning Poland.
   For Poles, the sorest points of mutual history are the murder of
more than 4,000 Polish officers in the Katyn Forest and the
internment of at least 10,000 more in Soviet prison camps.
   Official Polish and Soviet histories say the Nazis killed the
officers in 1941, but many Poles and Western historians believe the
Soviets killed them in 1940.
   The commission, established two years ago, has yet to deliver
its findings on the Katyn massacre, but a Soviet popular magazine
recently raised the possibility that the Soviets were responsible.

   Three sets of remains from Vietnam have been

of U.S. servicemen killed in the Vietnam War, military officials
announced Wednesday.
   The remains of Air Force Col. Edward H. Johnson of Newburg,
Ore., and Capt. Randall J. Craddock of Norman, Okla., and Navy Lt.
Cmdr. William F. Coakley of Lenox, Mass., were among 38 sets of
remains repatriated by Vietnam on Dec. 15, according to the U.S.
Pacific Command.
   Seventeen sets of remains have been identified so far, and
efforts continue to positively identify the remainder, officials
said.
   Johnson and Craddock were listed as missing in action on Dec.
21, 1972. Coakley was listed as missing on Sept. 13, 1966.

<TEXT>
   Mauritanian troops are gathering on the border with
Senegal, and the African neighbors may go to war, Mauritania's
interior minister said Wednesday.
   Djibrill Ould Abdallahi said in an interview on the French
television network Antenne 2 that Mauritania was ready to make war
if ``Senegal makes it.''
   ``When a frontier that seemed to be settled is thrown into
question and troops mass on the other side, one is obliged to do
the same thing,'' he said, without providing any details on
Senegalese troop movement.
   He said Mauritania massed troops on the border along the Senegal
River, although he declined to give their precise location or
number.
   Asked if war was possible, said it was.
   He said France was partially responsible for the conflict
because it transferred people from one country to the other during
colonial rule.
   Anti-Senegalese violence in Mauritania and violence against
Mauritanians in Senegal in recent weeks has left an estimated 260
people dead. The dispute between the countries has long historical
and racial roots, but the latest confrontation was sparked by a
minor border incident near the river in April.
   Tens of thousands of Mauritanians and Senegalese were
repatriated in a massive airlift.

   The House on Wednesday approved legislation
hailing the demonstrations in China as ``one of the most
significant movements for democracy in modern history.''
   The resolution, adopted on a voice vote, also calls on China's
government to resolve the crisis without violence and enter a
dialogue with protest leaders. It says the government should end
martial law and not arrest, jail, prosecute or otherwise punish
those who have led and taken part in the pro-democracy movement.
   In addition, the resolution seeks the immediate release of
``those Chinese citizens still imprisoned for the nonviolent
expression of their political beliefs.''
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., chief sponsor of the resolution,
said that while the United States has only limited influence on the
Chinese government, it is important for China's leaders to know
that ending the demonstrations with a violent crackdown and mass
arrests would adversely effect future U.S.-Chinese relations ``in
no small way.''
   ``Once you let the genie of freedom out of the bottle of
repression it is no easy task to get it back in again,'' Solarz
told the House.
   ``We say to the people of China, we have watched with awe and
admiration your disciplined demonstrations,'' Solarz said. ``We
call on the Chinese government to resolve this crisis in a peaceful
manner.''

<HEAD>Foley Center of Speculation as Successor</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: To update with member saying Foley near unanimous choice as
Wright successor, subs 2nd graf previous with three grafs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   House Majority Leader Tom Foley of Washington
was the center of speculation Wednesday as the odds-on favorite to
succeed Jim Wright as speaker should the embattled Texas
congressmen be forced to relinquish his leadership post.
   ``There is near unanimity of support for Tom Foley,'' said Rep.
Pat Williams, D-Mont.
   But as sources said Wright's lawyers were negotiating a deal
under which he would step down in exchange for dropping the most
serious ethics charges against him, there was no guarantee that
Foley, who has spent 25 of his 60 years in the House, would gain
the top House post without opposition.
   Foley, a former prosecutor from Spokane, emerged as a Democratic
leader in 1974 when younger House Democrats overturned the
long-standing seniority system. He became chairman of the
Agriculture Committee that year, and moved into the leadership in
1980 when he was made majority whip, the third-ranking position.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri was mentioned as one possible
Democratic oopponent for Foley, but in the supercharged political
atmosphere of a House in transition, there was no shortage of names
mentioned for other leadership posts _ vacant or otherwise.
   ``I don't think the Angel Gabriel could beat Tom Foley,'' said
one congressman who insisted on anonymity.
   But there also was talk of a ``clean sweep'' ticket that would
seek to oust all members of the current leadership, including Foley
and majority whip Tony Coelho of California.
   If Wright were to leave the speaker's post, the chamber's 260
Democrats would then choose a successor.
   Lawyers for the speaker were discussing an arrangement under
which Wright would resign his post in exchange for the ethics
committee dropping the most serious charges against him, said
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   One House member who has been a Wright supporter said _ speaking
only on condition of anonymity _ that he had found no evidence on
the House floor that anyone was maneuvering overtly to garner
support for a leadership race.
   Coelho, the third-ranking member of the House leadership, has
his own ethics problems. The congressman has acknowledged that he
failed to disclose a $50,000 loan from a savings and loan in
California that he used toward purchase of $100,000 worth of junk
bonds.
   Mentioned as the possible slate to replace the current
leadership were Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri for speaker; Rep.
Ed Jenkins of Georgia for majority leader; and Rep. Bill Gray of
Pennsylvania for whip.
   Such a bid would be considered highly unlikely and none of those
named would acknowledge any such ambition.
   Gephardt, an unsuccessful candidate for the 1988 Democratic
presidential nomination, is a former chairman of the House
Democratic Caucus and is widely respected by his colleagues.
   ``I don't want to answer hypothetical questions,'' responded
Gephardt when asked if were planning to run for speaker _ a
response considered significant for its lack of a direct denial. He
was also mentioned as a potential candidate for majority leader if
Foley succeeded to the speakership.
   Gray succeeded Gephardt as caucus chairman, after serving as
chairman of the House Budget Committee. He is the only black in the
current leadership.
   Jenkins' strength in speculation was based on his Southern base.
Should Wright resign, there would be no southerner in the
leadership ranks.
   Othere names circulating as potential leadership candidates were
two powerful committee chairmen _ Rep. Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois
of the Ways and Means committee and Rep. John Dingell of Michigan,
who heads the Energy and Commerce Committee.
   If Wright were to resign, said Dingell, ``I would expect the
majority leader, Tom Foley, to be a candidate, and I support him.''
   If Foley chose not to seek the speakership, ``I would consider
my own options at the appropriate time,'' said Dingell.
   Rostenkowski was described as happy with his chairmanship and
unlikely to bid for the leadership. His background in Chicago
machine politics also was considered a detriment should he change
his mind.

   Author Alex Haley, who began writing in
his spare time while a cook aboard Coast Guard cutters, was awarded
the Coast Guard Academy's first honorary degree at its 108th
commencement exercises Wednesday.
   President Bush, who delivered the commencement address,
conferred upon Haley, 67, the honorary degree of doctor of humane
letters.
   Haley, author of ``Roots,'' retired from the Coast Guard in 1959
after 20 years of service, leaving with the rating of chief
journalist.
   He completed two years of college before joining the Coast Guard
as a mess cook in 1939. While serving aboard various cutters during
World War II, he worked late many nights writing stories and
letters to family and friends.
   He also wrote some of his shipmates' love letters to their
girlfriends, collecting a dollar a letter.
   The Coast Guard created the journalist rating for him in 1952.
   Haley has often referred to the Coast Guard as his alma mater,
so ``we wanted to make it official,'' said Lt. Paul A. Preusse, a
Coast Guard spokesman.
   It was the first honorary degree awarded by the academy, the
school said.
   Haley said it was 50 years ago that he was heading off to the
Coast Guard to enlist, and that ``this is a marvelous way to end up
that golden anniversary.''
   A resident of Norris, Tenn., Haley sails as a passenger on
international cargo ships for three or four months each year, using
the time to write.

<TEXT>
   The Turkish breakaway state on Cyprus
claimed ownership Wednesday of sixth century mosaics already
involved in a tug-of-war between an Indianapolis art dealer and the
Republic of Cyprus.
   The self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus asked
U.S. District Court for permission to intervene in a lawsuit filed
in March by the Greek Cypriot republic and the Greek Orthodox
Church of Cyprus.
   Experts believe the case could lead to a landmark decision on
worldwide dealing in national art treasures.
   Cyprus claims art dealer Peg Goldberg of suburban Carmel
purchased the rare mosaics illegally and they should be returned to
the church.
   Turkish Cyprus asked Judge James E. Noland to delay the civil
trial, which is scheduled to begin next Tuesday. Noland did not
rule immediately.
   ``As far as we're concerned, there cannot be a full adjudication
of these issues without the input of the people who have control
over that land mass,'' said Joseph D. Youssouf, a Freehold, N.J.,
attorney representing the Turkish occupation state.
   Turks have governed the northern third of the Mediterranean
island since Turkish forces invaded in 1974. The Turkish occupation
state is not recognized by any nation except Turkey.
   ``You can say that something doesn't exist but if you can prove
that it does: has a flag, a national anthem, a population and
regulates the territory from which these four mosaics were stolen
... we are a real party in this case,'' Youssouf said.
   Goldberg, a county commissioner in Hamilton County north of
Indianapolis, bought the mosaics for $1.1 million in July 1988 from
a Turkish dealer in Switzerland. She claims she has legal title to
them under Swiss law.
   The rare mosaics are made of glass and were once part of a much
larger work in the church of Panagia Kanakaria in the Cypriot
village of Lythrankomi. The 2-foot-square mosaics depict the heads
of the Christ child, the apostles James and Matthew and an
archangel. Experts say they are among only a handful of artworks
surviving from the first centuries of Christianity.
   The Republic of Cyprus and the Church of Cyprus claim agents of
the Turkish occupation state surreptitiously ripped the mosaics
from the walls of the church in 1979.
   Court records show the mosaics were allowed to leave Cyprus
under an export document purportedly signed by Osman Orek, who
acted as prime minister for Turkish Cyprus. Orek denies signing the
document and will testify in Indianapolis if allowed to do so,
Youssouf said.
   Turkish Cyprus is asking for the return of the mosaics for
restoration in the church, unspecified damages and court costs.

   Suspected Basque separatists set a car bomb
that killed three policemen and injured five other people Wednesday
in this northern Basque city, a provincial spokesman said.
   The bomb exploded as a police bomb squad inspected a stolen car
parked outside a dealership. The dealership had been damaged three
hours earlier by a small bomb, said a spokesman for the Vizcaya
province Civil Governor's office.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility. But the spokesman
said police suspected the Basque separatist group ETA, which seeks
independence for the three-province northern Basque region.
   The explosion killed two police officers and a member of a bomb
squad of the Ertzainza, the police force of the autonomous
government of the Basque region, the spokesman said. The five
injured included four police officers and a firefighter, the
spokesman said.
   The car was stolen at gunpoint late Tuesday by two men in
Amorebieta, a town 12 miles northeast of Bilbao, the spokesman said
on condition of anonymity. The car's owner was found tied to a tree
outside the town, he said.
   In its 21-year campaign for independence, ETA has claimed
responsibility for killing more than 600 people, mainly police,
military and Civil Guard officers.
   So far this year, ETA has claimed responsibility for four
killings. All occurred since April 4, when ETA ended a moratorium
on attacks on government targets after breaking off three months of
peace talks with Spanish officials.

<HEAD>Gun Control Bills Faring Poorly In Louisiana Legislature</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Assault Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill to require registration of
semiautomatic assault rifles was killed Wednesday, and Louisiana
lawmakers said it was unlikely the ``Sportsman's Paradise'' would
adopt any gun legislation this year.
   Gun control proponents said rural legislators had failed to
appreciate the problems of violent crime in New Orleans and other
metropolitan areas.
   The House Committee on Criminal Justice deferred action on the
bill, effectively killing it.
   Sponsor Rep C.R. Jones said he at least wanted to get the
attention of the committee ``that something needs to be done.''
   Rep. Diana Bajoie gave up earlier on her bill to prohibit the
sale and possession of assault weapons.
   ``I sense the mood of this committee but sooner or later we're
going to have to keep these weapons out of the hands of people who
use them for the wrong reasons,'' Bajoie said.
   Backers of bills to set waiting periods for handgun buyers said
they expect no better luck when their measures are considered
Thursday.
   What gun control advocates failed to consider is that Louisiana,
where license plates read ``Sportsman's Paradise,'' is a largely
rural state where hunting and owning guns are ways of life, said
Rep. Ed Scogin.
   ``You outlaw guns and only the outlaws will own them,'' said
Scogin.
   Jones said that a few months ago, a teen-ager in New Orleans
stole a shipment of Israeli-made Uzi assault weapons from a boxcar.
   ``He was selling them in the projects for $80 apiece,'' said
Jones. ``A 16-year-old has been charged with killing someone with
an Uzi.''

   Actor and former football star O.J. Simpson
must pay $700, perform 120 hours of community service and continue
psychiatric counseling for his no-contest plea to wife beating, a
judge ruled Wednesday.
   Simpson, who didn't appear in court, was also placed on two
years' probation by Municipal Court Judge Ronald Schoenberg.
   Simpson, 41, entered a no-contest plea Monday to one count of
spousal battery through his attorney, Howard Weitzman. The maximum
sentence for spousal abuse is one year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   ``O.J. just decided it was in everybody's best interest not to
contest the charges any longer,'' Weitzman said at the time. The
plea is not an admission of guilt, but allows the defendant to be
judged as guilty.
   Schoenberg ordered Simpson to perform 120 hours of community
service through the Action Bureau organization in Santa Monica, pay
a $200 fine and give $500 to a Santa Monica shelter serving
battered women.
   He was also ordered to undergo twice-weekly counseling, said
city attorney's spokesman Mike Qualls. Simpson has been undergoing
counseling since January, he said.
   Simpson, a former professional football running back who won the
Heisman Trophy while at the University of Southern California,
allegedly screamed ``I'll kill you'' as he slapped and kicked his
29-year-old wife of four years, Nicole, in a pre-dawn New Year's
Day argument.
   In a statement released Wednesday, the Simpsons said the City
Attorney's office had turned the incident into a ``media event and
public crusade at our expense and personal embarrassment.''
   The Simpsons said they wanted to ``set the record straight from
the distortions and misleading news reports that our family has
been subjected to.''
   ``Upon returning home New Year's Eve, we got into an argument
which escalated and the police were called. Fortunately, neither
one of us required medical treatment,'' the couple said. ``The very
next day, we talked about it and took steps to put this behind us.
   ``We have never been separated and our marriage is as strong as
the day we were married, if not stronger.'

   A United Airlines jet carrrying 203 people slid
off a runway and rolled onto grass Wednesday after landing at
O'Hare International Airport, officials said.
   There were no injuries or damage, according to spokeswomen with
the city's aviation department and United.
   The nose of the DC-10 from Philadelphia went about 10 feet past
the end of the runway after an otherwise normal landing, Sara
Dornacker of United said.
   Rain on a newly painted portion of the runway apparently
contributed to the slide, she said.
   Everyone aboard left the craft by mobile staircases, Ms.
Dornacker said. Evacuation chutes were not used.
   The runway, closed while the plane was removed, opened about an
hour after the 8:52 a.m. incident, according to the Federal
Aviation Administration.
   The plane was back in service Wednesday afternoon, Ms. Dornacker
said.

   The perjury trial of former U.S. Rep. Pat
Swindall moved closer to opening arguments Wednesday as attorneys
finished questioning potential jurors.
   The attorneys next will choose from a group of 33 jurors, and
opening arguments could come Thursday in the trial in which
Swindall stands accused of lying to a federal grand jury
investigating money laundering,
   Forty-seven potential jurors were questioned over two days
regarding their knowledge of the heavily publicized case and their
feelings about the former Republican congressman.
   U.S. District Judge Richard C. Freeman dismissed 14. Thirteen
said they possibly could not put aside their unfavorable
impressions of Swindall and be impartial jurors, and the 14th was a
former law partner of Swindall.
   At least eight of the 33 people in the jury pool said they, too,
had unfavorable opinions about Swindall but could put them aside
and decide the case on the basis of the evidence.
   The potential juror pool also includes one woman, a former
Swindall fund-raiser, who said she ``admires'' Swindall but
promised to be open-minded.
   Defense attorneys have asked the judge to move the trial because
of extensive publicity, but Freeman said he would rule only after
hearing from potential jurors.
   Swindall is accused of lying under oath in early 1988 to a
federal grand jury investigating his dealings with Charles
LeChasney, an associate and now-admitted money launderer, and a
federal agent posing as a money broker for probable drug dealers.
   Swindall was indicted Oct. 17 on 10 counts of lying to a federal
grand jury, each of which carries a penalty of 10 months to five
years in prison on conviction.
   The indictment contends Swindall lied in concealing from the
grand jury his discussions of how to cover up the sources of an
$850,000 loan to be used to pay for his home. Swindall returned
uncashed a check for the first installment of the loan.
   Swindall, a two-term Republican congressman, lost his seat
representing Atlanta's eastern suburbs to Democrat Ben Jones last
November.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega told an
international delegation Wednesday that the United States is to
blame for Panama's political crisis.
   ``We told them our truth,'' the general, Panama's de facto
leader, said in a brief statement after meeting with Organization
of American States delegates for 2{ hours.
   Noriega, commander of the armed forces, told a news conference
the three-hour meeting had been ``postive'' and gave the Defense
Forces ``an opportunity to express their idea about the economic
aggression .... and the foreign intervention that caused the
deterioration'' in Panama.
   ``Each officer spoke of his concept of this reality,'' he went
on. ``We talked about the intimidation, of outrages, of excessive
foreign presence and intimidation by air, sea, land, submarine ....
even the ozone layer has suffered intervention,'' he joked.
   President Bush sent about 2,000 extra U.S. troops to Panama
after the government nullified the May 7 presidential election and
Noriega supporters beat up opposition candidates.
   When he was asked what he planned to do, Noriega thought a
second and said, ``That's the million dollar question.''
   An aide said Noriega told the delegation his resignation is an
issue that would be decided by the Defense Forces, not by an OAS
request.
   International observers say the election was won by opposition
candidate Guillermo Endara over Noriega's candidate, Carlos Duque.
The government said Duque won.
   The delegation, led by OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares,
included foreign ministers Diego Cordovez of Ecuador, Mario
Palencia of Guatemala and Sahadeo Basdeo of Trinidad and Tobago.
   Earlier, the delegates met with leaders of the opposition and
the Roman Catholic Church. Opposition leaders told the delegation
they wanted their election victory recognized and Noriega retired.
   ``We want democracy and justice for the people of Panama,''
Endara said after meeting with the delegation.
   Endara and his two vice-presidential candidates, Ricardo Arias
Calderon and Guillermo Ford, were accompanied by 300 cheering
supporters as they marched several blocks from a church to the OAS
delegation's hotel.
   About 25 riot police wielding bullhorns peacefully dispersed the
crowd. Opposition spokesmen said one bodyguard and an Arias
Calderon aide were arrested.
   Acting president Manuel Solis Palma said no new elections were
possible before Sept. 1, when his term as ``minister in charge of
the presidency'' is supposed to end.
   Solis Palma told a meeting of bureaucrats that new balloting
could not be held because of the expense and ``because of the
psychological condition of the Panmanian people after the trauma of
the elections.''
   He suggested he would continue in office, citing an
administrative code that says a person must serve until he is
replaced.
   ``Juridically, there is no problem, but politically we will have
to define a transfer of power,'' he said, adding, ``It could
possibly be the succession of one person by another of the same
group.''
   After the nullification, the OAS passed a resolution criticizing
Noriega and calling for ``a transfer of power in the shortest
possible time.''
   ``We want recognition of our electoral victory and the
retirement of General Noriega,'' Arias Calderon said Wednesday.
   ``We will not betray the people. The May 7 vote is a mandate
from God,'' said Endara. ``The OAS listened but didn't want to
comment. They said they would like to meet again.''
   The march Wednesday marked the fourth time the opposition has
defied a government ban on demonstrations in effect until June 5,
when the OAS commission is due to file its report.
   On Tuesday night, the Panamanian government presented its case
against the United States during a meeting with the OAS delegation.
   Solis Palma's government has said it hoped the mission would
``establish the truth of the crisis as a conflict between Panama
and the United States'' and cited U.S. economic sanctions as proof
of malice.
   The government also has proclaimed it will accept no
interference in internal Panamanian affairs and that some aspects
of the OAS resolution violate the OAS charter.
   The first street demonstrations against Noriega's rule began in
June of 1987.
   Since then Noriega has been indicted on U.S. drug charges,
charges he says are part of a U.S. plot to renege on its commitment
to give up the Panama Canal at the end of 1999.

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright, his political career
of 35 years in shambles, bargained through lawyers Wednesday to
resign his leadership post in exchange for the dismissal of some of
the ethics charges confronting him.
   Wright denied that he was considering stepping down and issued a
statement saying he would ``press ahead'' with his defense. Even
so, Democrats were looking beyond his departure to selection of a
succcessor _ and apparently closing ranks behind Majority Leader
Tom Foley of Washington.
   Wright's representatives shuttled through a daylong series of
meetings with key members of Congress in a bid to nail down an
unprecedented agreement stripping him of his post as leader of the
House and second in line of succession to the presidency within a
week. The extraordinary drama of political abdication overwhelmed
normal business at the Capitol, even though it was played out
almost exclusively behind closed doors.
   ``What I know is that negotiations are taking place that deal
with resolving this issue very soon,' said Rep. Bill Richardson,
D-N.M. ``They involve dropping one of the charges in exchange for
the speaker resigning the post, and it's something that will
probably be settled in the next 24 to 48 hours.'' Other sources
suggested it would be next week before the issue was resolved.
   Richardson said he understood Wright would retain his House seat
under the terms of the discussions. But there was no word on
whether the Speaker would seek re-election from his Fort Worth
congressional district in 1990.
   Other sources said the deal involved dropping
conflict-of-interest charges that Wright accepted gifts of housing
and a car and salary for his wife. If those charges were dropped,
Wright could step down as early as next week, the sources said.
   But sources said the committee was not receptive to any
arrangement that would clear Wright of charges that he evaded House
limits on outside income through bulk sales of his book,
``Reflections of a Public Man.''
   One congressman familiar with the talks, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said a majority of the ethics committee favored some
sort of negotiated settlement. But the ethics committee adjourned
late Wednesday until June 1 without acting on Wright's case, and
sources said the negotiations were continuing.
   Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., the panel's chairman met at one
point during the afternoon with Foley to discuss Wright's situation.
   At the same time, the timing of any resignation was uncertain,
and Rep. John Myers of Indiana, the ranking Republican, said, `` I
personally am opposed to any arrangements, deals, plea bargaining.''
   ``It's kind of a dance _ a very tentative kind of dance,'' said
one House member, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   In the background, the politics of succession flourished.
   ``There is near unanimity of support for Tom Foley'' as speaker,
said Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont. ``There would be no campaign'' for
the top leadership post, he said.
   Even so, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri was careful not to
dampen speculation that he might seek the speaker's job, and a long
list of contenders was mentioned to take Foley's rung on the
leadership ladder and vie for other spots. The party's whip, Tony
Coelho of California, caucus chairman Bill Gray of Pennsylvania,
deputy whip David Bonior of Michigan, Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana
and Gephardt headed the roster of potential candidates.
   House Republican Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., who normally has
avoided comment on Wright's plight, said: ``I guess if I had that
kind of a problem, I wouldn't be around here. If the conditions
were exactly the same and I were dragging my party into the kind of
area that I see .... I'd have no alternative but to step aside.''
   Wright, who spent his day in a serious of meetings with his
supporters and his leadership team, left the Capitol early in the
evening without speaking to reporters.
   The speaker also issued a statement saying: ``I very firmly
believe that my position is right. I hope and trust that the
committee will consider the matter on its merits and dismiss the
charges.
   ``I eagerly await the time and opportunity when my side of this
whole question may be heard clearly by my colleagues and the
American people. To this end, I shall press ahead.''
   Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., a member of Wright's defense
team, met with ethics committee counsel Richard J. Phelan and made
the initial offer, the sources said. The proposal ran into
opposition from ethics committee Republicans and still was being
negotiated, said the sources, who commented only on condition they
not be named.
   The ethics committee _ made up of six Democrats and six
Republicans _ met for much of the day in private, deliberating
Wright's motion to dismiss the two most serious allegations. The
chairman, Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., promised a ``fresh look,''
but there was no indication any of the committee members had been
persuaded.
   Other signs were ominous for Wright, as fellow Texas Democrats
began to talk openly of growing odds against his keeping his post.
   The most serious allegations facing Wright are that he used bulk
sales of an autobiographical book to evade rules limiting outside
income and that he improperly took gifts from a developer friend
who had a direct interest in legislation.
   Earlier Wednesday, entering a luncheon with Texas Democrats,
Wright was asked about widespread speculation that he was
considering stepping aside as speaker until the ethics case is
resolved.
   ``No, I'm not,'' he answered.
   Asked whether his political position was eroding, he said, ``I
don't feel that at all.''
   However, a fellow Texas Democrat in the House, Mickey Leland,
said, ``There is some hint Jim might step aside, at least
temporarily, until this whole thing is resolved.''
   Wright met with Clark Clifford, an elder statesman of the
Democratic Party and a member of Wright's legal defense team, for
1{ hours Wednesday morning, and Torricelli later met with ethics
committee attorney Phelan.
   When asked whether there was a deal in the works to drop some of
the charges against Wright in return for his stepping down, the
speaker's spokesman, Mark Johnson, declined comment.
   ``There's no question the speaker is in serious trouble,'' said
Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas. ``The speaker's problems have
translated into institutional problems for all of us. The
institution is getting a black eye.''
   Stenholm said some of his constituents now are telling him the
evidence against Wright is overwhelming and that ``where there's
that much smoke, Charlie, there's gotta be a spark somewhere.''
   He added: ``There obviously have been some mistakes made, some
rules if not broken, bent severely.''
   ``Public opinion is weighted against him at this time,'' added
Leland. ``I think the die is cast. There is still a glimmer of hope
he might survive. But the cards are stacked against him.''
   Rep. Philip Sharp, D-Ind., who previously called for a
leadership change, embraced the idea of Wright stepping down at
least temporarily and appointing a replacement. ``There is a state
of continuing erosion of public confidence in the House, and I
don't think that's a good state for anybody,'' Sharp said.
   On Tuesday night, Wright had told reporters: ``I want to be an
effective person in America, and I've had that privilege. Most of
all now I want to protect my good name and that of my family and my
wife and my colleagues.''
   The ethics committee's two senior members indicated there was
nothing new in the fiery arguments they heard a day earlier from
Wright's lawyer, Stephen Susman, during a televised hearing.
   ``My mind wasn't changed,'' said Myers, the committee's senior
Republican. ``There were no new points raised, absolutely no new
points.''
   Dixon said, ``I think Mr. Susman indicated in his remarks that
he was not optimistic that any or all of them would be dismissed,
but I do think we have a responsibility to reassess that and give
it a fresh look.''

<TEXT>
   Nearly 200 teachers went on strike
Wednesday in the first serious display of worker discontent since
January, when the government announced a tough austerity plan to
fight 20,000-percent inflation.
   Educators at two schools split from the national union and gave
the leftist Sandinista government a deadline to answer demands for
pay raises and other improvements.
   The pro-Sandinista National Educators Association of Nicaragua,
known as ANDEN by its Spanish initials, struck a conciliatory note.
The nationwide labor union backed most demands but warned
``pro-imperialist and rightist pseudo-leaders'' against instigating
strikes.
   ``This is the crucial moment to reach our vindication and we
can't lose it,'' said teacher Cesar Cuevas. ``This is the awakening
of the teaching profession.''
   Monthly salaries now range from $21.62 for high school teachers
to $81.08 for college professors.
   Cuevas is a member of the negotiating committee from the Mexico
Experimental Center, one of two schools in Managua that gave the
government until Thursday afternoon to answer the teachers' demands
for better pay and working conditions.
   The Mexico Experimental Center, a high school, has 120 teachers,
while the other school, Maestro Gabriel, has 112 teachers.
   In San Rafael del Sur, a town 30 miles south of Managua, the
entire force of 198 teachers was on ``indefinite strike until our
situation has been solved,'' said Orlando Estrada Garcia, principal
at the Ricardo Morales Aviles elementary school.
   ``Today they came (from the Education Ministry) with an offer
which we didn't think is correct,'' said Estrada. ``The 5,000
cordobas we earn daily doesn't cover anything. You buy a soft drink
and a piece of bread and there goes your 5,000 cordobas.''
   Estrada said the 47 teachers at the school earn an average
150,000 cordobas monthly and they are demanding a tripling of the
salary, ``although even 600,000 cordobas a month would barely cover
a family's basic needs.''
   At the current rate of exchange of 7,400 cordobas to the dollar,
150,000 cordobas equals $20.27 and 600,000 is worth $81.08.
   Olivia Sanchez de Solis, principal of the Jose Ignacio Estrada
high school in San Rafael del Sur, said representatives of the
teachers would meet with government officials on Thursday.
   The government also has been meeting with teachers in Managua to
negotiate a solution, but already it has said that granting pay
raises would undo its anti-inflationary measures.
   Inflation in 1988 reached more than 20,000 percent.
   ANDEN issued a communique saying the teachers had legitimate
grievances but a pay raise would ``make inflation explosive and
would not contribute to the logic of the (government's) economic
measures.''
   Barricada, the official newspaper of the ruling Sandinista
National Liberation Front, accused right-wing politicians and the
U.S. Embassy of trying to ``manipulate'' the teachers' discontent.

   A runaway Conrail car loaded with coal
smashed into a passenger train returning from the airport
Wednesday, injuring at least 17 people, officials said.
   The coal car collided with the single-car airport train at 5:18
p.m., according to Donna Alson of the Southeastern Pennsylvania
Transportation Authority. The engineer threw the train into reverse
but was unable to outrun the coal car, SEPTA spokeswoman Pat Fallon
said.
   The coal car broke loose from a string of standing cars,
according to Conrail spokeswoman Pat Linsey. She said Conrail was
investigating the accident.
   The injured were treated at hospitals and released, hospital
spokeswomen said.

<TEXT>
   The teachers strike in the nation's
second-largest district went into its 11th day Wednesday without
the inflammatory statements that had prompted state legislators to
admonish negotiators to stop bickering.
   Negotiators for the teachers' union and the school district
expressed optimism about reaching an agreement as they headed into
talks late in the day.
   ``I am hopeful that we will emerge with a contract and people
will go back to work tomorrow,'' school board President Roberta
Weintraub said. ``I think that the time has come for the offer the
board has made to be accepted ... I am very optimistic, I certainly
expect that we'll have some good news.''
   United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson told
reporters that a private meeting both sides had with state
legislators in Sacramento on Tuesday spurred resumption of talks.
   ``I think that it brought a sense of realism to both sides that
... there is serious concern about what is going on in Los Angeles
and the powerful legislators, influential people, want this thing
settled,'' Johnson said.
   Johnson also told reporters, ``I think there is an expectation
that there will be some movement and possibly a settlement
tonight.''
   In another development, a striking teacher was booked Wednesday
on assault charges of throwing a rock at a substitute teacher.
Sheriff's deputies said the rock missed the teacher's car and
struck a 12-year-old girl. She was treated at a hospital for a cut
on her head, said sheriff's spokesman Deputy Dan Cox.
   The teachers are seeking a 26 percent raise over three years.
   School board members have said they boosted their offer to a 24
percent pay raise over three years, with the second year raise
contingent on receiving state surplus funds. Otherwise, it will
drop to 5{ percent.
   Teachers earn between $23,440 and $43,319 a year, depending on
experience and level of education.
   Education in the district has slowed to a crawl since the union
representing 22,000 of the district's 32,000 teachers went on
strike May 15.
   Most classes wind up June 23, but some schools operate
year-round.

   A.A. ``Abe'' Schechter, the first news
director for NBC-TV and the first executive producer of the
``Today'' show, and his wife, Fritzi, died Wednesday in a car
accident. He was 81.
   Mrs. Schechter, who was 82, was driving the couple's car when it
ran off a Long Island highway and struck a tree, Southampton Town
police said.
   Schechter was the author of ``Go Ahead Garrison,'' published in
1940, and co-wrote ``I Live on Air,'' both books describing his
exploits in journalism.
   In the second book, published in 1941, he told of the time he
directed an NBC Radio reporter to set up for what was intended to
be the first broadcast from the base of the Egyptian pyramids at a
time when remote broadcasts were rare and difficult.
   The radio reporter arrived to find a CBS reporter already on the
air from the opposite side of the pyramid. He phoned Schechter for
directions and was told ``then go to the top of the pyramid.'' The
order became a catch-phrase for producers to dramatize the
importance of being first.
   Schechter was born in Central Falls, R.I. He worked at The
Providence (R.I.) Journal and the New York World as a reporter
before he became an editor in New York with The Associated Press.
   In 1932, he was hired by NBC to organize and run the network's
news department, which he did until 1942.
   During World War II, he was attached to the staff of Gen.
Douglas MacArthur, supervising radio and press communications for
war correspondents.
   From 1945-50, he was a vice president of the Mutual Broadcasting
System, which he left to work briefly at Crowell Collier Publishing
Co.
   He then returned to NBC to help create the ``Today'' show and
became its first executive producer.
   He left in 1952 to start a public relations company, A.A.
Schechter Associates Inc., which in 1973 was acquired by Hill and
Knowlton Inc.
   Schechter was a member of the board of directors at Hill and
Knowlton until his 1979 retirement.
   The Schechters, who had homes in Westhampton, N.Y., and Palm
Beach, Fla., are survived by two daughters.

   A Dallas man who was allergic
to nuts died after eating a Brazil nut and an almond he was given
by a female companion, authorities said.
   Darryl Reid, 38, ate the nuts Monday while driving near Heffley
Creek just north of here and about 270 miles northeast of
Vancouver, said Coroner Bob Graham.
   When Reid and the woman, whom Graham did not identify, stopped
for gas, she bought a bag of nuts and began eating them as they
resumed driving, the coroner said.
   ``She offered him a Brazil nut,'' said Graham. ``Then she
offered him an almond.
   ``Then he turned to her and told her `I'm allergic to nuts.' ''
   They returned to Heffley Creek, but by the time an ambulance
arrived, Reid's heart had stopped from the allergic reaction, said
Graham.
   He said he knew of only one other similar case in the region, a
youth who died five minutes after eating a chocolate bar containing
nuts.
   Reid apparently offered no explanation to the woman, a casual
acquaintance, for eating the nuts.
   ``I guess he was just driving along with his mind in neutral,''
said Graham. ``They were offered to him and he took them.''

   Hoards of homeless won't be dispatched in
bus loads to this celebrity beach retreat in spite of actor Martin
Sheen's official welcome for them in his capacity as honorary mayor.
   ``There will not be any buses. Things have spiraled to such a
degree they are out of my control,'' Rush Limbaugh, a nationally
syndicated radio talk show host who had threatened to organize a
homeless ``March on Malibu,'' said Wednesday.
   Sheen's declaration offering Malibu as a nuclear-free, homeless
sanctuary triggered Limbaugh's proposal to arrive Saturday with
busloads of indigents. But the continuing uproar gave Limbaugh
second thoughts.
   ``Call me a coward, call me a wimp, but I am doing what is
right,'' he said in a telephone interview from New York. ``The
bottom line is that I will not be able to guarantee their safety.''
   Limbaugh, a conservative, has been needling Sheen and what he
calls the Hollywood ``left coast'' for years, and Limbaugh had
maintained busing homeless to Malibu was a fair response to Sheen's
declaration.
   But on Wednesday he said, ``I don't have to bring a bunch of
homeless down there to prove my point. The left just loves evidence
that we conservatives are heartless and cold.''
   Olivia Thornton, the Chamber of Commerce president who picked
Sheen as honorary mayor, expressed relief.
   Meanwhile, Los Angeles homeless activist Ted Hayes said
Wednesday he felt Limbaugh had a point.
   ``Why doesn't Martin take them in his house? How can he go
around the country and tell everybody they should do something and
then he has no plan in his own neighborhood?'' he asked.
   The declaration sparking nearly two weeks of turmoil in Malibu
read: ``I hereby declare Malibu a nuclear free zone, a sanctuary
for aliens and the homeless and a protected environment for all
life, wild and tame.''
   Hayes sees a positive side to the Malibu brouhaha, although he
believes Sheen's days as honorary mayor are numbered.
   ``Malibu can set an example for all the other affluent
communities,'' he said. ``I think Martin Sheen was a godsend for
the chamber of commerce. Everyone knows there are homeless, now
it's time for a yes-in-my-backyard campaign.''
   Sheen, who has been in Canada directing Gary Busey and son
Charlie Sheen in the movie ``Count a Lonely Cadence,'' wasn't
available for comment on the latest developments, his publicist
said.
   The actor, who once portrayed a homeless activist himself in a
movie made for television, has said his remarks were misunderstood
and distorted.

   The House ethics committee is deciding whether
to dismiss charges against House Speaker Jim Wright in a volatile
atmosphere where anything less than a win for the speaker could
doom his career.
   The Texas Democrat proclaimed his innocence Tuesday night, but
spoke about the possibility of losing his job, telling reporters
that if he became politically crippled he ``wouldn't want to be
speaker.''
   Wright has discussed such a possibility before, but his latest

Pressure is mounting on his Democratic colleagues, who are torn

troubles may be unresolvable.
   ``The political pressure is so intense that until this matter is

   Nuclear-tipped antibodies that seek and
destroy cancer inside the body show promise of giving doctors a new
way to attack tumors, researchers say.
   The goal is to blitz cancer cells with huge doses of killer
radiation. Doctors launch the attack with protein probes that hunt
down the cancer deep within the body.
   In initial experimental use, researchers found that the strategy
wiped out all detectable cancer in people who were not helped by
ordinary treatment. However, far more study will be necessary
before researchers know for sure whether this approach will cure
cancer.
   The findings were presented Tuesday by Dr. Oliver W. Press of
the University of Washington to the annual meeting of the American
Society of Clinical Oncology.

   Nearly two-thirds of Americans are too fat,
and more than a third are at least 10 percent over the recommended
weights for their height, body build and sex, a nationwide health
survey shows.
   The study, done for Prevention Magazine, determined that 64
percent of adults age 25 and over could stand to lose at least a
few pounds.
   But fewer than half of those people were trying to shed the
extra pounds when polled in November, the study by Louis Harris and
Associates says.
   The percentage of overweight Americans is the highest since the
magazine began keeping track in 1983, and is up from 59 percent in
1987 and 1986, 62 percent in 1985, 56 percent in 1984 and 58
percent in the first year of the survey.

   Federal investigators blame Aloha Airlines for
an accident that ripped open an airliner fuselage 24,000 feet over
Hawaii but they say lax inspection of aging 737s was an
``industry-wide deficiency.''
   The National Transportation Safety Board, ending a 13-month
investigation Tuesday, blamed the accident on failure of
island-hopping Aloha's maintenance program to detect broken bonds
and fatigue damage in the Boeing 737's outer skin.
   The board voted 4-1 to lay primary blame on the airline and said
Federal Aviation Administration failures contributed to the April
28, 1988, accident that hurled the plane's chief flight attendant
out of the airliner to her death. With one engine out and its
passenger section exposed to the sky, the plane landed on the
island of Maui with 89 passengers and five other crew members.
   The independent safety board said the FAA failed to issue
sufficient orders to correct problems with the aging 737 fleet and
didn't adequately monitor Aloha's maintenance program before the
incident.

reassuring Iranians the revolutionary patriarch was still at the

   Gestures from the Kremlin have given hope to
delegates of the new Soviet parliament that they will have an
independent voice in solving pressing economic and social problems
when its first session convenes Thursday.
   Early indications had been that Communist Party leaders intended
to direct the decisions of the parliament, known as the Congress of
People's Deputies, but they have been backing off lately.
   The leadership called a meeting Tuesday of its majority in the
congress, rousing fear that the program would be dictated. Instead,
the session was thrown open to non-party deputies and a free
discussion followed, said Yuri Andreyev, a member from Moscow.
   Andreyev, a construction engineer, described the meeting as a

   Women who experienced natural menopause before
age 45 tended to die sooner than other women in a new study,
suggesting early menopause may indicate the body is aging faster
than normal.
   Women whose menopause had occurred before age 40 showed a 95
percent higher risk of dying during the six years of the study than
did women of similar ages whose menopause came ages 50 to 54,
researchers said.
   For women who had reported menopause at ages 40 to 44, the risk
was 39 percent higher.
   Results suggest that age at natural menopause may be an
indicator of the body's aging rate and general health, researchers
from the University of Minnesota and Loma Linda University in

   In what could have been a sequel to ``Moscow on

loaves of real Russian rye flown in from the Soviet Union.
   ``We're selling it at a rate of one loaf every two minutes;
right now, the line is very long,'' said Miraed Peake Smith,
spokeswoman for Bloomingdale's, where 1,100 loaves arrived Tuesday
night.
   ``One person came in and bought 14 loaves,'' she said. Among the
buyers were employees from the Soviet mission to the United Nations.
   ``The bread is good. It's not a gimmick,'' Ms. Smith said. ``But
Americans also seem to be fascinated with Russian items.''
   Yes, but they're still Americans, and any resemblance to Moscow
ends at the rear of the bread line. Competition broke out before
the bread had even arrived in the United States, and a chain of
bakeries is already planning to undercut Bloomingdale's price _ a
hefty $6 for each two-pound loaf.
   The dense bread was made in Moscow on Sunday, shipped Sunday
night, arrived Monday via Aeroflot, underwent federal inspections
and arrived at Bloomingdale's on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Gospel Missions Serving Widened Range Of Homeless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDRA WALEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gospel rescue missions, long a champion
in the inner city for the homeless, are responding to a whole new
range of needs that were practically unthinkable even a decade ago.
   Expansion in the role of these downtown missions was highlighted
at the recent annual convention of representatives of about 300
such missions in cities across the country.
   It long has been a stereotype that they mostly serve older
alcoholics and drug abusers. However, young adults, women and
children are just as likely to seek help these days.
   That has put a growing load on rescue missions to meet needs not
met by state or other agencies.
   ``In the last 10 to 15 years, things have changed drastically,''
said the Rev. Stephen Burger, president of the International Union
Of Gospel Missions. ``We've been called on to do things we hadn't
done before.''
   A look at some of the issues raised at the IUGM's 76th annual
conference here earlier this month tells part of the story: AIDS,
children's nutrition, unschooled minors, battered women, drugs.
   It used to be almost unheard of to have to worry about children
in the missions, Burger commented at the close of the five-day
conference. But women and children now are the fastest growing
proportion of those served, now amounting to about 40 percent.
   Burger, nephew of retired Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren
Burger, in August will become executive director of the non-profit
Protestant organization which oversees some 300 rescue missions in
the United States and Canada.
   He says there has been a vast upheaval in the social fabric of
this country. ``Today there are millions of homeless in America _ a
population that continues to grow and become more diverse,'' he
says.
   No city has been left untouched by the homeless problem, he
notes, suggesting a look at the shuttered up steel-mill towns of
Pennsylvania, or a place like Astoria, Ore. (population 15,000).
   ``I thought of that as a picturebook place and here they were
with the fishing industry falling apart, the lumber industry
falling apart, alcoholism on the rise. And all of a sudden,''
recalls Burger, ``we have a homeless problem.''
   Astoria is one of a number of cities across the country which
have turned to the IUGM in setting up programs for the homeless and
what Burger calls the ``near-homeless,'' or those people whose
whole condition is unstable and regularly move in and out of the
system.
   He says there is agreement on causes of the homeless crisis: the
disintegration of the family, changing values, drug and alcohol
abuse, a changing economy.
   What is not so clear are what the solutions will be.
   But there is reason to hope, Burger says. ``The church has
become awakened to the possibilities.''
   He says there are more volunteers, and churches which over the
years have tended to move away from the inner city are getting more
involved.
   He says one key is to persuade people to pitch in.
   ``Part of the problem is we've challenged but we haven't told
them what to do. You have to provide the vehicle to get people
downtown,'' a formidable task, Burger says, when there are already
so many demands on people's daily lives.
   Another key, he adds, is creating innovative programs to help
those trying to rebuild shattered lives.
   ``Even those of us in this work can get a fortress mentality ..
. and not see the new needs _ the mentally ill, the Hispanics, the
folks being dumped out of hospitals, the elderly being kicked out
of homes being turned into condos,'' Burger says.
   ``Government can provide funding, but it can't get involved with
people on a personal level to help overcome years of abuse,
alcoholism. ...''
   Burger says the thinking now must be: ``How do you get that
person to see, with God's help, what they can do'' as well as
``What are you doing to keep people out of the mission.''
   Under the Bush administration, the homeless could fare better,
he believes.
   ``I think the problem is quite obvious at this point and it
seems (Secretary of Housing and Urban Development) Jack Kemp has a
real commitment,'' Burger says.
   For others out in the communities wanting to commit themselves
to the homeless issue, Burger plans to develop videos of model
programs across the country.

   For more than two years, planning had gone on for a special

   The affair was canceled after Roman Catholic Bishop Augustine

   This was supposed to be National Tap Dance
Day, but Congress never got around to proclaiming it. It's had
trouble getting around to a lot of things this year.
   This was going to be the historic, high-powered 101st Congress.
So far, the bicentennial session has been long on ceremony and
heavy on intramural disputes.
   Chief among them now is the ethics case against House Speaker
Jim Wright of Texas, the top Democratic official in the government,
struggling to hold onto his job.
   As he tried to get the major charges dismissed, Wright's lawyer
suggested to the ethics committee that the tough line against the
speaker is part of the fallout from other episodes _ such as Senate
rejection of the nomination of John G. Tower, a former Republican
senator from Texas, to be secretary of defense; and the continuing
effort to deal with the savings and loan crisis.
   Along with those issues came one in which Wright himself played
the leading role, the 50 percent congressional pay raise originally
programmed to go through without a vote. It was derailed and
defeated after a public outcry led the speaker to put it to a roll
call.
   Wright's own ethics case is a distraction or worse, although
other Democratic leaders insist it has not diverted the House from
conducting its regular business. Wright himself takes a somewhat
different line, insisting the charges are unfounded and should be
dropped so that Congress can concentrate on the work of governing.
   Three major measures that have passed this session are a $1.17
trillion federal budget for the fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1,
a measure providing limited aid to the Nicaraguan Contras and a
$4.55 hourly minimum wage bill.
   The budget wasn't really legislated; it was negotiated with the
administration, at the urging of the Democratic leaders of Congress
and of President Bush. To make the deal, the negotiators put aside
contentious tax and spending questions until next year.
   ``It's no more smoke and mirrors than in the past,'' said Sen.
Pete Domenici of New Mexico, senior Republican on the budget
committee. And he said the process that produced the budget
agreement is itself a stride toward a better way of doing things in
the future.
   The Contra package was a negotiated deal, too, and it is subject
to an intricate system of congressional vetoes.
   The minimum wage increase will be an issue, not a law, for a
while yet. The Democratic Congress raised the rate past the level
Bush said he would accept, but by margins that are not wide enough
to override a veto. The lines are drawn on that one, and despite
his preference for compromise and bipartisanship, Bush can't afford
to back down.
   That doesn't add up to much of a season as Congress takes its
Memorial Day recess. Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said his
college-age son was driving to work with him the other day when
they spotted a bumper sticker on the car ahead: ``America Deserves
a Better Congress.''
   ``I said `What do you think of that, son?' He said, `Well, I
think they're right.'''
   Early in the session, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., introduced
his joint resolution to designate today as National Tap Dance Day,
this being the birthday of Bill ``Bojangles'' Robinson, born in
Richmond, Va., in 1878.
   He proposed to honor Robinson, ``King of the Tap Dancers,'' and
``to refocus the attention of the nation on American tap dancing.''
   Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., introduced the resolution in the
House, and added some more Bojangles lore.
   ``He coined the phrase `everything is copasetic,' which means
it's going along just fine,'' Conyers said. ``Unfortunately, this
phrase no longer holds true for the art form he brought to near
perfection.''
   Nor for the resolution, which never got to the floor for the
routine approval that is customary on such commemorative measures.
   But then, not much is copasetic in Congress these days.

   Treat Williams, who made a name for himself
playing offbeat characters in often obscure films earlier in his
career, has been on a mainstream roll lately.
   Williams played a hippie in the film version of the musical
``Hair,'' a cop tugged by divided loyalties in ``Prince of the
City,'' a charming airliner hijacker in ``The Pursuit of D.B.
Cooper,'' and a seedy Casanova in ``Smooth Talk.''
   In ``Third Degree Burn,'' premiering Sunday on HBO, he plays a
more accessible character, a hard-luck private detective. He also
plays a Drug Enforcement Agent in next season's NBC miniseries,
``Desperados: The `Kiki' Camarena Story'' and a reporter in the
theatrical film ``The Heart of Dixie.''
   ``I've had a tendency in the past to play characters more on the
edge of normalcy,'' he said. ``In my younger years I was more into
character work and not leading men. As I've gotten into my late
30s, I'm playing characters in the mainstream of life, not on the
edge of life like my character in `Smooth Talk.'
   ``The screenplays that writers are writing for men in their late
30s are more interesting. The characters are more interesting, life
is more complex, and they are more complex. They've lived longer
and had more experiences. The simple fact of the mechanics of the
business is that you try to find the best role in the best story
directed by the best director that you can among all the options
available to you.''
   The movie ``The Heart of Dixie'' also stars Ally Sheedy,
Virginia Madsen and Phoebe Cates. It takes place in Alabama but was
filmed in Oxford, Miss.
   ``I spent two months on the picture but I didn't work that much
on it,'' Williams said. ``I got to travel and see a lot of the
South.''
   Williams is now preparing for a Broadway musical version of
``Elmer Gantry,'' Sinclair Lewis' story of a 1930s evangelist who
turned out to be a charlatan. It will be his first musical since
``The Pirates of Penzance.''
   Meanwhile, he is completing his role as DEA Agent Ray Carson in
``Desperadoes.'' Steven Bauer and Craig T. Nelson also star in the
miniseries, which is being filmed in Los Angeles and Spain. Since
it deals with political corruption in Mexico it could not be filmed
there.
   In ``Third Degree Burn,'' Williams plays Scott Weston, a former
policeman who supports himself by investigating small-time divorce
cases. He's hired to check up on Anne Scholes, played by Virginia
Madsen.
   ``Scott has an Achilles heel which sets the plot in motion,''
said Williams. ``He has a tendency to sleep with other men's wives.
He becomes involved with the woman he's investigating. He becomes
ensnared in a trap that includes murder and spends most of his time
trying to figure out how he got there.
   ``It's a film noir,'' said Williams. ``I hope it doesn't seem
imitative. I'm sure every story has been told at least once. We
were trying to tell a contemporary story, but it certainly falls
into the category of film noir.''
   The movie, directed by Roger Spottiswoode, was filmed in Tucson
and Seattle.
   Williams, who lives in Vermont, usually flies to locations in
his own two-engine Piper Seneca. ``I have as much flying time as
most airline co-pilots,'' he said. ``I call it TWA for Treat
Williams Airlines.''
   He began flying while at the Kent School in Connecticut.
   ``My high school coach lost my ring,'' he explained. ``He said
he couldn't pay me the $35, but since he was a flying instructor he
would give me two free lessons. I soloed when I was 17 and bought
my first plane when I was 21 and doing `Grease' on Broadway.''
   Williams was married last June to Pamela Van Sant, a modern
dancer and actress. They were married by one of his former
classmates, now an Episcopal minister and headmaster of the Kent
School.
   He calls his place in Vermont a ``farmette.'' It has an 1826
farmhouse and on one side is a dairy farm and on the other side is
a horse farm.
   ``It's a beautiful place,'' he said. ``We have an extraordinary
view of the Equinox Mountains and the Green Mountains.''

<HEAD>Arming Yourself Against Investment Scams</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the legitimate investment world has boomed in
the 1980s, so has its dark underside, where the ripoff artists ply
their trade.
   Stories abound of operations selling ``gold'' that is actually
dirt, penny stocks at pumped-up prices, packages of government
securities that never existed, and tax shelter deals that can't
stand up to the slightest scrutiny.
   Of course, financial scams are just about as old as the history
of money. A lot of the ploys in use today are merely recycled
versions of schemes dreamed up long ago.
   But the volatility of all securities markets in this decade, and
the fast-buck atmosphere it has helped foster, seems to have
created an especially fertile breeding ground for financial phony
business.
   ``We've never been this aware of so many frauds in things such
as penny stocks, coins, gold piles and so forth,'' said Raymond F.
DeVoe Jr., an analyst at the Wall Street firm of Legg Mason Wood
Walker Inc.
   One apparent cause of this, DeVoe says, is the proliferation of
new investment vehicles that Wall Street has devised to offer to
pension fund managers and other sophisticated clients.
   ``Some of the financial creations of the last few years are so
bizarre that even professionals don't completely understand them,''
he observes.
   ``Because the legitimate financial creations are so complex, it
is very hard to tell them from the phony ones.''
   All this leaves many individuals who have money to manage in a
tough spot: How to protect themselves while still attempting to
invest their money productively.
   Harold Finlay at the Cleveland-based investment firm of
Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben suggests three basic rules: ``Beware of
very high yields. Know the person with whom you do business. Don't
make hasty decisions.
   ``It seems laughable that many people spend more time selecting
a necktie or dress than investing their life savings,'' Finley
observed in the firm's monthly publication Investor News.
   A prime tool of the scammer's trade is the telephone. The North
American Securities Administrators Association acknowledges that
many above-board investments are promoted over the phone.
   But it has published a list of tips for dealing with what you
suspect is a ``boiler room'' operation selling questionable or
fraudulent goods.
   Among the association's most compelling recommendations: The
harder a telephone salesperson presses, the wiser it is to resist.
If a caller turns abusive, hang up.
   Don't fall for any claims of spectacular rewards or promised
``guarantees'' until you can verify the legitimacy of the deal and
have a clear picture of all the risks involved. If you can't
understand an investment, don't buy it without the counsel of a
trusted and knowledgeable adviser.
   Never give your credit-card number to a stranger on the phone.
Be especially suspicious of propositions involving delayed delivery
of the investment in question.
   Likewise, look warily at any deal in which the seller proposes
some unusual arrangement to collect your money, such as sending a
messenger to pick up your check. ``Some con artists try to avoid
mail fraud charges by using overnight courier services,'' NASAA
points out.
   A deregulated financial world is also a let-the-buyer-beware
world requiring a good deal of healthy skepticism.
   That means mustering the strongest doubts when the caller's
voice is most persuasive, or when the name of the purported
business is most impressive-sounding. Fly-by-night boiler rooms
have been known to call themselves ``national exchanges,''
``research institutes,'' ``bureaus,'' in fact almost anything but
what they really are.

<HEAD>Housing _ A Time To Buy?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With asking prices below their highs of a few
months ago, with large numbers of unsold houses on the market and
with interest rates falling, an investment opportunity may be
developing in single-family housing.
   While such opportunities are more common in housing than in most
markets, partly because housing is made up of a greater percentage
of amateur versus professional sellers, as in cars, they are
transitory.
   In fact, as soon as such opportunities appear, they begin to
vanish. That's the housing market for you, up and down more sharply
than other markets, and always exaggerating the usual economic
cycle. Bust to boom and back to bust.
   The most important element in the opening for buyers is the
general decline of interest rates, which many forecasters expect
will continue right through the year.
   Interest rates are key, since interest is the biggest housing
expense for those who take out 20-year or 30-year mortgages,
sometimes equalling the total cost of all other factors, including
land and the structure itself.
   When you have a combination of lower rates and relatively softer
prices _ asking prices that are below their earlier highs or that
are negotiable _ you have a buying opportunity. Now add to that a
big inventory of unsold units.
   Earlier this year, the National Association of Realtors
estimated the inventory of unsold homes at more than 2.9 million
units, or a nine-month supply of existing homes and 7.5-month
supply of new houses.
   What that means is a lot of unhappy sellers. While they could
rationalize the inattention given to their offerings during the
winter, when weather and mood keep people from shopping, they are
now in the prime selling months.
   Another factor enters the picture: The news about housing has a
rather dismal cast of late. Just a month or two ago, for example,
sellers and buyers were loudly lamenting the deadly duo of rising
prices and interest rates.
   In many areas those factors have changed _ in some they have
been reversed _but the mood lingers, keeping many potential buyers
from the market. It is, of course, a situation that can change
overnight. It has happened before.
   Still another factor is involved in the potential investment
opportunity. If the price of the house purchased today is to have
greater market value tomorrow, it would help tremendously if future
housing were in short supply.
   There is no proof that such a situation will develop, but it
should be noted that the number of residential building permits
issued in 1989 could be the lowest in seven years. Future demand,
therefore, might not be met.
   The National Association of Home Builders forecasts 1.02 million
single-family housing starts this year, a figure that would make
1989 the weakest homebuilding year since 1983. Lomas Mortgage USA,
a large mortgage lender, estimates new housing permits this year at
1.394 million, 21 percent lower than in 1986.
   Building activity today creates tomorrow's markets, and if
building this year is weak it could tip tomorrow's buyer-seller
balance. Those who buy today, that is, conceivably could find
market values higher a few years hence.

<HEAD>Count of Women Clergy Doubles In Decade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of American women ordained to the
church's ``full ministry'' _ preaching the word and administering
the sacraments _ has about doubled in the last decade.
   They total 20,730, as statistically projected, nearly twice the
10,470 of 1977. They now constitute 7.9 percent of the clergy in
denominations ordaining women.
   That percentage also has about doubled, from 4 percent, and
seems likely for a further steep increase as indicated by the boom
in women enrollment in seminaries.
   The figures were gathered by Constant H. Jacquet Jr. of the
research office of the National Council of Churches. His report
says women still face some discrimination, but adds:
   ``There has been an increasing acceptance of women clergy in
local church situtations especially by younger people and by those
of higher educational attainment.
   ``Women have also gained acceptance as pastors once they have
been given the opportunity to demonstrate their competence in
preaching and pastoral care at the local level.''
   Among mainline denominations, the Lutheran Church in America
(merged in 1988 into the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America)
had the highest percentage of women heads of local pastoral staffs,
more than half its clergywomen.
   American Baptist also ranked high in this category. Among
mainliners, Lutherans and the United Methodist Church had the
highest perentage of women clergy serving in local congregations
generally.
   Getting on the staff of a local church, particularly as chief
pastor or head of staff, is considered a key measure of acceptance
of women clergy. It also is seen as a common obstacle.
   ``Women clergy appear to be more easily accepted in church
employment outside the local church at various denominational
administrative offices, in ecumenical conciliar positions and in
many institutional roles,'' the report says.
   Among 221 denominations included in the survey, 84 of them
ordain women and 82 do not, with uncertainty about it in 49 others.
Six do not ordain clergy at all.
   The proportion of denominations ordaining women had grown little
since 1977, when 76 ordained women and 82 did not. However, those
ordaining women had now become a slight majority, 84 to 82.
   With totals projected as of 1986, the Assemblies of God led the
field in numbers of women clergy, 3,718 of them, up from 1,572, or
137 percent. Others among the next ranked l0, and their decade's
increase or decrease in women clergy, were:
   Salvation Army, 3,220, up from 3,037, or 6 percent.
   United Methodist Church, 1,891, up from 319, or 496 percent.
   Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), 1,519, up from 370, or 310 percent.
   United Church of Christ, 1,460, up from 400, or 265 percent.
   Episcopal Church, 796, up from 94, or 747 percent.
   Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), 743, up from 388, or 91
percent.
   Lutheran Church in America, 484, up from 55, or 780 percent.
   International Church of the Foursquare Gospel, 666, down from
804, or 17 percent.
   Southern Baptist Convention, 450, up from 20, or 2,150 percent.
   American Baptist Churches, 429, up from 157, or 173 percent.
   Apart from those numerical rankings, other large percentage
gains in women clergy were by the Reformed Church in America, which
went from one to 42 of them, up by 4,100 percent.
   Also, the American Lutheran Church (now also merged into the
Evanelical Lutheran Church in America), increased women clergy from
18 to 306, or 1,600 percent, while the Menonites went from four to
48, up 1,100 percent.
   In the smaller Mormon branch, the Reorganized Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints, women's ordination was authorized only
in 1984, and since has shot up from none to 860, the report says.
   In some instances, the numbers of women clergy dropped. The
Church of the Nazarene count fell from 426 to 355, a 17 percent
drop.
   Like the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, some
larger, conservative Protestant churches do not ordain women,
including the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod.
   The present fundamentalist administration of the Southern
Baptist Convention opposes women's ordination, but the report shows
the denomination's women clergy, up from 20 to 450, have multiplied
more than 20 times.
   Congregations in that denomination are autonomous and may ordain
without higher approval, but few have hired women pastors.
   Until recent times, the increase in women clergy was relatively
slow. It took 27 years for the 1950 total of 5,591, most of them
among Pentecostals or para-church groups, to double by 1977.
   Now that most mainline denominations ordain women, the totals
have zoomed, doubling again in one decade. The report says:
   ``There is every reason to believe that the percentage of women
ordained will continue to increase ... as women gain wider
acceptance in the various denominations based on demonstrated
performance and on the changing attitudes of those currently
opposing equal roles for women.''

   The council of the recently merged Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America recommends that it continue membership
in the U.S. National Council of Churches and the World Council of
Churches.
   The recommendation goes before the denomination's governing
assembly here Aug. 23-30. Such membership has been maintained
tenatively by the 5 million-member denomination until the assembly
acts.
   In the denomination's formation last year, one of the merging
bodies, the American Lutheran Church, did not belong to both
ecumenical bodies, as did a merging partner, the Lutheran Church in
America.
   However, subsequent samplings indicate strong majorities favor
such memberships.

<HEAD>The Original `Babes in Arms' Returns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Babes in Arms'' is the Rodgers and Hart
musical that people think they know _ and don't.
   What everybody recalls is the folklore that has obscured this
classic ``Come on kids, let's put on a show'' musical that
introduced such standards as ``My Funny Valentine,'' ``The Lady Is
a Tramp,'' ``Johnny One Note,'' ``I Wish I Were in Love Again'' and
``Where or When.''
   They remember the vastly different _ and softer _ Andy
Hardy-style movie starring Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney and not
the Broadway musical which opened two years earlier at the Shubert
Theater with a cast of young unknown performers that included
Alfred Drake, Mitzi Green, Wynn Murray, Dan Dailey, the Nicholas
Brothers and Ray Heatherton, father of Joey.
   It is a concert revival of the original Broadway version that
will grace Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher Hall June 5. Performers
include Judy Kaye, Gregg Edelman, Judy Blazer, Jason Graae and a
singing group called J.Q. and the Bandits. Some of the book will be
performed, but Anita Morris will serve as narrator to tie together
some of the plot developments.
   The concert, a benefit for the Starlight Foundation which helps
critically ill children, will be presented and conducted by Evans
Haile, a Juilliard-trained musician who has conducted at the
Seattle Opera and other opera companies. He will lead the New
Jersey Symphony in Hans Spialek's original orchestrations.
   ``This show has a unique place in musical theater history,''
says Haile. ```Babes in Arms' is a score that has five standards
but hasn't been done in New York since its premiere. And the
original book is much more interesting in a lot of ways than the
later versions because it deals with social issues.''
   The story for ``Babes in Arms,'' which Rodgers and Hart also
wrote as well as the music and lyrics, is set during the
Depression. It concerns the children of out-of-work vaudeville
performers who put on a revue so they will not be sent to a work
farm. The show flops but the kids are saved in Act 2 when a
trans-Atlantic flyer, a Frenchman named Rene Flambeau, crashes in
the area and helps the teen-agers out of their financial
predicament.
   ``There is a whole argument about socialism vs. capitalism in
the musical,'' said Haile, explaining what was in the original
script. ``One of the other big issues in the show is that when the
children find an underwriter for the show they are trying to put
on, they discover he's a bigot and won't let the two black kids
(played in the original by the Nicholas Brothers) go into the
show.''
   That was the musical's first act finale. When the curtain came
up the on the second act, the kids were on the work farm and the
black performers did not reappear in the show.
   The show boosts several lesser known Rodgers and Hart songs such
as ``You Are So Fair'' and ``Imagine,'' as well as two long ballet
sequences, originally choreographed by George Balanchine. The music
from both will be performed at Lincoln Center although in abridged
versions, particularly the ``Johnny One Note'' ballet which
consists of some 12 minutes of the song repeated in the same key.
   Even stage versions of ``Babes in Arms'' that audiences have
seen over the last three decades have been different than the
original, says Ted Chapin who oversees the rentals of Rodgers and
Hart musicals as manager of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Library.
   In the 1950s and '60s, according to Chapin, Richard Rodgers
encouraged revised versions of three or four Rodgers and Hart shows
which were basically not being produced at all. That quartet
included ``Babes in Arms.''
   ``I can only surmise that in the 1950s he felt the way to get
the Rodgers and Hart shows performed more, was to do more
up-to-date versions,'' Chapin said. ``With `Babes in Arms,' George
Oppenheimer wrote a new book that was what everybody thought `Babes
in Arms' was from the beginning _ a summer stock musical, kids in
the barn on Cape Cod trying to put on a show.''
   ``Babes in Arms'' has had very few major revivals over the last
half century. The St. Louis Municipal Opera performed it in 1940;
Julie Wilson starred in a production at the Royal Poinciana
Playhouse in Palm Beach, Fla., in 1959; and the Goodspeed Opera
House had its own version with Andrea McArdle of ``Annie'' fame in
1979.
   ``The revised version by Oppenheimer that we rent does very well
in high schools, but more and more, as people are becoming aware of
originals, they are asking for originals,'' Chapin said. ``There
has been interest but it has never been followed through with
`Babes in Arms.' Mark Bramble (co-author of the book for ``42nd
Street'') wanted to do a production in London based more on the
original but that didn't work.''
   Haile's concert presentation could awake interest in ``Babes in
Arms'' again. Already several recording companies have indicated
they might want to record the show.

<HEAD>Bette Midler Stars in Remake of Stella Dallas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's 1937, and Barbara Stanwyck playing the
outcast Stella Dallas watches from outside as her daughter gets
married. It is one of Hollywood's classic tear-jerking scenes.
   Flash forward to 1989.
   The feisty, funny Bette Midler is starring in a remake that the
production team says updates the old concepts of high society but
keeps the basic story intact. So, instead of Stanwyck needing to
chase after a rich husband to make her unsuccessful attempt to move
upward, Midler can grumpily tell her friend how she told off the
rich guy and doesn't need his money.
   The new version, called ``Stella,'' was filmed in Toronto this
spring for a planned release in the winter.
   The handkerchiefs, though, will still be needed. At the end,
just as her predecessor did, Midler will be watching from outside
at her daughter's elegant New York wedding.
   ``I think the old movie was really about class distinction,''
said director John Erman said in an interview. ``This movie is
really about opportunities.''
   This will be the third version of the Stella Dallas story, based
on a novel by Olive Higgins Prouty. Samuel Goldwyn made a 1925
silent film, starring Belle Bennett, Ronald Coleman, Jean Hersholt
and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. He produced the King Vidor version in
1937 starring Stanwyck, who was nominated for an Academy Award.
   The Samuel Goldwyn Co. held the rights. Now, Samuel Goldwyn Jr.
is co-producing the new movie with Touchstone Pictures, which has
an exclusive arrangement with Midler. Touchstone will domestically
distribute the movie, and Goldwyn's company has international
distribution.
   Goldwyn traces the idea to remake the movie back to 1986. He
said he didn't intend to get involved in a co-production but the
chance to get Midler as the film's star was too good to pass up.
   ``She's really become a reason to redo the picture,'' he said.
   As for the script, Goldwyn said that the original movie's
reliance on the class system wouldn't totally work today but the
emotional scenes still do.
   Among the ``set pieces,'' as he called them, are the birthday
party for the daughter to which nobody comes and the famous ending.
   He, and others involved in making the movie, say there's no
doubt that some sort of class system still exists even if it is not
as ironclad as in the earlier part of the century.
   The new version ranges from 1969 to the present. Midler plays a
bartender in a small upstate New York town, who meets rich New
Yorker Steven Dallas while he is a medical student in the area. She
gets pregnant, he backs off, she brings up their daughter without
any help. That, of course, is just the start.
   ``It's Bette's picture all the way,'' said actor Stephen
Collins, who plays Steven Dallas.
   The ``trick of the plot'' is to show that Steven and Stella
simply don't belong together.
   ``So nobody's a bad guy,'' Collins said, taking a break from
tuning fellow actor John Goodman's guitar. ``They're having a great
affair, but realistically marriage is not in the cards for them.''
   As for the famous scene where Midler will be watching her
daughter get married, Collins said, ``If anybody in this day and
age can make that scene fly, she could.
   ``If it works, it'll be similar to `Beaches,' _ a really good
cry and the kind of story people really like going to the movies
for.''
   The burly Goodman, off from the smash hit television series
``Roseanne,'' is playing Midler's oldest friend, hard-drinking Ed
Munn.
   ``I have to make it work for myself,'' he said when asked about
the difficulties of updating the story. ``I can't think of what's
gone on before.''
   Erman, who directed such television movies as ``The Two Mrs.
Grenvilles'' and ``An Early Frost,'' said the key update is that
Stella and Steven choose not to be together.
   ``We've all worked very hard to make sure this is credible and
plausible,'' he said. ``I frankly think that if you had done this
with an actress who didn't have the range that Bette has, then it
might seem more like a soap opera.''

   Dale Brittain has no illusions that the
forestry program he supervises for young inmates will help all of
them, but authorities say a little respect and some incentives can
go a long way toward helping some.
   ``When you're at the bottom and have never had anything,
anything is important to you,'' Brittain said. ``These boys come
from a rough background. Some of them you're going to change, some
of them you're not.''
   Inmates who participate in the BRIDGE program range in age from
18 to 25 and learn such skills as carpentry, forestry, logging and
fighting forest fires in the state's three mountain districts.
   BRIDGE is an acronym for Building, Rehabilitating, Instructing,
Developing, Growing and Employing.
   Brittain credits the program's success to incentives.
   There's ``gain time'' _ for every eight hours a BRIDGE inmate
works, a day is subtracted from his sentence. The inmates wear
special uniforms with logging boots and get a break from prison
food by eating at restaurants near worksites.
   At the program's administrative offices at the Burke Youth
Center, there is a display of photographs of the participants, with
the inmate of the month at the top. That's another incentive,
Brittain said, because some of the inmates have never had an
8-by-10 photograph of themselves.
   ``They're not Boy Scouts,'' added Carl Johnson, who directs the
BRIDGE program from Raleigh. ``They did something wrong. But if you
treat them well, you get something back.''
   The participants in Avery County are constructing buildings that
will house up to 50 inmates in the program.
   Pointing to five young inmates skimming the bark off a pine tree
at a makeshift sawmill, Gary Poole, a Division of Forest Resources
project leader, said, ``That's a good crew right there. They
actually hunt work to do.''
   Nearby, several young men used hammers and handsaws to put the
finishing touches on one of three buildings resembling vacation
lodges that are perched on a hillside in the Blue Ridge Mountains.
   Inmate Tony Walker, who is serving a three-year sentence for
breaking and entering, had never seen a sawmill before but took to
the work quickly.
   ``It's a lot better than sitting around all day,'' said Walker,
22, who entered the program about four months ago and has about
seven months left. ``They treat you just like you're at work.''
   Some inmates are chosen to work on the ``helitack crew,'' which
fights forest fires from a bright yellow Army helicopter equipped
with a collapsible water bucket.
   While they're building the camp facilities, the program's 26
inmates are temporarily housed at the Burke Youth Center.
Instructors from nearby Mayland Community College have provided
training in carpentry and masonry, but no professional contractors
have been hired.
   ``A lot of it we just beat and bang and learn ourselves,''
Brittain said.
   Harry Layman, director of the Division of Forest Resources, said
the young prisoners have a chance to develop skills, such as
carpentry and plumbing, and they are also attracted to the program
because they are treated less like inmates.
   ``Our nicest compliment on the program was one young man gave up
his parole to stay in the program,'' Layman said. ``The kids begin
to feel part of something. We treat them with respect.''
   Since the program was begun in 1986, it has taken in 206
inmates. About dozen have re-entered the prison system, Brittain
said. Others have been hired by the state forestry division and
private employers.
   The youths volunteer for the program and are carefully screened,
Brittain said.
   Layman compared the program with the Civilian Conservation Corps
begun by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Depression.
   ``It's using the forest as remedial,'' he said. ``There is
something healing about taking them out in the woods and letting
them work with nature.
   ``We cut down the logs, then build the camp ourselves with our
forestry supervisors and the inmate labor,'' he said.
   Layman said the program was begun after a fire in Burke County
destroyed 47 homes built on ``little switchback roads.'' He said it
was born a union of the state's prison and forestry divisions.
   The program is one of just two east of the Mississippi, state
forest officials said. The other is in Florida. Modeled after
similar programs in California and Oregon, the BRIDGE program uses
only young, minimum-custody prisoners.
   Melvin Bruton, 21, has been in the program 19 months. He has
earned 674 hours of gain time _ enough for more than 2{ months off
his sentence _ and has nearly completed a 13-year prison term for
breaking and entering.
   ``You hear of forest fires on TV,'' said Bruton. ``They offered
it to me, and I thought it would give me a change from regular
prison.''
   Bruton has learned carpentry, landscaping and the operation of
heavy equipment, such as bulldozers and a ``knuckleboom loader''
used by the logging industry. He also spent 18 months on the
helitack team.
   ``I've learned so much,'' he said. ``I didn't know nothing
before I came in.''

   ``We're looking in broom closets for space,''
says a New Jersey prison official. If his voice and others in
corrections sound strained and their attempts at solutions seem
desperate, no wonder. There's no more room in America's prisons,
but the inmates keep coming.

   The U.S. prison system is like a stopped up
pipe. Built to contain a stream of criminals, the plumbing is
overflowing.
   Spillover inmates end up in tents in Florida and on surplus
troop barges in New York City. In Texas, POW-style camps may be
built.
   Some states have installed jury-rigged emergency valves to free
prisoners ahead of their time. But last year, when courts freed a
wave of Philadelphia inmates, they committed a wave of new crimes.
And 10 days after one Florida prisoner got an early release he was
charged with killing two cops.
   The states swamped the worst are trying to bail themselves out
with new prison construction. California, 70 percent over the brim,
is spending $3.2 billion on building. President Bush wants an extra
$1 billion in 1990 for federal prisons, which are 55 percent over
capacity.
   Authorities say these vast amounts and desperate measures are
not enough to ease the jam and the threat of riot that goes with
it. They propose shorter sentences for non-violent criminals, and
more use of work release, probation, restitution, halfway houses
and electronically monitored house arrest.
   ``The entire system is filled beyond capacity. It's clogged,''
said Anthony Travisono, executive director of the American
Correctional Association.
   ``It's like trying to mop the bathroom floor without turning off
the spigot on an overflowing bathtub,'' said Gordon Bonnyman, a
civil rights lawyer in Nashville, Tenn.
   Recent mandatory sentencing rules and a jump in drug-related
prosecutions have packed prisons, officials said, but the flood of
inmates is not new. This year was the 14th straight that opened
with the U.S. prison population at an all-time high. The number
imprisoned has nearly tripled since 1975.
   The 627,402 people behind bars at the start of this year were
60,504 more than the system was designed to hold, according to the
Justice Department.
   Are the streets safer?
   ``There's not a criminologist or a sociologist in the country
that can say as a result of more incarcerations we have lowered the
crime rate,'' said Herb Hoelter, director of the National Center on
Institutions and Alternatives. ``We've been blackmailed by our fear
of crime.''
   If so, it's expensive blackmail. The annual tab for locking
people up is $16 billion a year. In some places the $20,000 cost to
imprison an inmate each year could send a student to Stanford or
Harvard, or pay a cop's salary.
   An average new prison costs $40 million. Last year, the system
grew by 42,967 inmates, which translates to the need for 86 new
prisons.
   States are building furiously. This year, $9 billion is being
spent for construction. An additional $6 billion is on states' wish
lists.
   But if the number stayed the same, and every projection says it
will keep accelerating, it would take eight years just to build
cells for all the inmates who need them, the Correctional
Association said.
   Even corrections officers say new prisons won't solve
overcrowding.
   ``Nobody has been able to build their way out of the
overcrowding problem. Once built, a prison bed will soon find an
inmate,'' said Larry Meachum, commissioner of the Connecticut
Department of Corrections.
   If all 24,000 beds that Bush wants to add to federal prisons
were available immediately they would eliminate only the overflow;
the 48,039-inmate system is 55 percent over capacity.
   New York City may put prisoners in shelters for the homeless.
Recently, 75 inmates at Rikers Island slept in a single room with
one toilet. The city is housing prisoners on two surplus ferryboats
and two converted British troop barges. A five-story, 625-foot long
floating jail is being built.
   California, with the largest inmate population in the country at
80,721, is spending $3.2 billion on more space. It has built 21,000
new beds since 1984.
   Americans ``expect criminals to serve hard time, to suffer,''
said Robert Johnson, professor of justice at American University in
Washington, D.C.``They want these people off the streets, but
they're not inclined to think through what it will cost.''
   The cost could be another Attica or Soledad, some officials
warn. ``The potential for explosion is always there in an
overcrowded prison,'' said Samuel Sublett, president of the ACA.
   Thirty-five states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico are
under court order to relieve overcrowding; all but Alabama,
Arkansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New
Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Vermont and Wyoming, according to the American Civil Liberties
Union.
   Twenty-seven have population caps set by federal courts.
   Until 1988, Florida housed 1,046 inmates in 12-person tents. The
state is building 9,376 new prison beds at a cost of $109 million.
And to comply with a cap, the state has an early release program in
which inmates serve only 35 percent of their sentence.
   One convict, Charlie Street, was accused of killing two Miami
police officers in November, 10 days after he was released from
prison and served eight years of a 15-year sentence for attempted
murder.
   ``The system is broken,'' said Florida Attorney General Robert
Butterworth in a speech to the American Jail Association. ``What we
have now is a legal escape system. We just open the door for them.''
   Philadelphia prisons twice released inmates last year to meet a
court order. Of 256 inmates released in June, 106 were arrested
within six months and accused of 156 new crimes.
   ``That's 156 crimes that shouldn't have happened.'' said
District Attorney Ronald Castille. ``We're sending a message to
criminals that they're not going to jail here. You can't imagine
how frustrating it is.''
   Because of a court-ordered cap, Texas closed its system to new
inmates in April, the 31st time since 1987 the doors were shut.
That just burdens county jails. One judge authorized Tarrant County
to build POW-style camps that could be patrolled by the National
Guard.
   In Connecticut, parole was outlawed in 1981, and a 1984 state
law mandates emergency release if the prison population is at 110
percent of capacity for 30 days.
   To avoid opening prison doors, the number of people in a
parole-like program called supervised home release has increased
from 700 to 3,400 in the last 18 months.
   Nine states have military-style boot camps where young felons
trade their sentences for a few months of pre-dawn wakeups, pushups
and hard labor under bombastic drill sergeants. Critics doubt the
discipline will help and fear it might just make criminals meaner.
   Fifty overflow inmates from the District of Columbia were blamed
for death threats, fires, food fights and sabotaged toilets after
they arrived at a prison in Spokane, Wash. Guards threatened to
strike.
   Last week, 10 Massachusetts prison guards charged in a lawsuit
that overcrowding was so severe their lives were in danger.
   Arizona Gov. Rose Mofford, too, has reason to worry. Her state
spent $100 million in five years for 4,500 new prison beds and
still pays $28,000 a day to house an overflow of 700 inmates in
county jails.
   The money, she said, has ``begun to restrict the state's ability
to educate our children, provide health care for the elderly,
disabled and low-income citizens and fulfill other state
obligations.''

   If you sometimes think the daily grind is a
dog-eat-dog world, you ought to see what goes on between the fungi
and the pathogens.
   Of course, says the Agriculture Department, there are good
fungi. But there are also bad fungi. Pathogens? They're the tiny
things like viruses that cause diseases _ and they're mostly bad.
   The idea of using nature's own organisms to fight, hold back and
destroy plant diseases has been around a long time. And the
department's Agricultural Research Service says the search
continues for biological ways of protecting crops.
   Recent reports from the agency show the task to be slow and
painstaking. Fungi and bacteria exist naturally in the same soil
that nourishes corn, wheat, rice, cotton, soybeans and even
backyard tomatoes.
   One of the tasks of the scientists is to sort out those
organisms and choose through experiments the ones that can help
protect crops.
   ``Twenty years from now, we'll have many more biological
controls like fungi to use,'' says Deborah R. Fravel, an agency
plant pathologist. ``They may not be as common as chemicals , but
they certainly will be increasingly important. I don't think
biological controls will ever completely replace chemicals, but
they will help reduce the amount of chemicals used.''
   Half a dozen beneficial fungi are being studied at the agency's
Biocontrol of Plant Diseases Laboratory in nearby Beltsville, Md.,
where Fravel works. Each is under scrutiny for its ability to fight
pathogens such as the bad fungi, bacteria, microscopic worms called
nematodes and even viruses.
   ``The idea is that we can enhance what's out there in nature,''
Fravel said. ``A lot of management practices in use right now, such
as adding organic matter to the soil, actually are biocontrols
because organic matter feeds the organisms already in place.''
   Fungi used in biocontrol fight plant pathogens in several ways:
parasitism, or actually feeding on the pathogen; antibiosis, or
producing some sort of compound that is toxic to the pathogen; and
through competition, the most common action.
   For example, she said, ``Plant roots leak carbon sources such as
sugar. The biocontrol organisms get to those carbon sources before
the pathogens do, so the pathogens can't get anything to eat and
can't grow. Or the biocontrol organisms may simply occupy all the
space around the root so the pathogen can't get in.''
   Fravel and her colleagues are conducting tests in some New
Jersey eggplant fields to see how well a beneficial fungus _
Talaromyces flavus _ fights Verticillium wilt disease. In previous
field tests, the fungus in combination with a reduced amount of
chemical fumigant reduced wilt disease in eggplant crops by as much
as 75 percent.
   Jack A. Lewis, a soil scientist at the Beltsville laboratory,
said work recently began on encasing two other fungi _ Trichoderma
and Gliocladium _ in pellets, which then are mixed into infected
soil or potting material to test their effectiveness.
   ``The pellets contain food for the biocontrol fungi,'' Lewis
said. ``The organism grows out of the pellet and spreads through
the soil, where it attacks the pathogen and kills it.''
   A number of other fungi also are being studied as possible
weapons, including some that might be targeted against pathogens
that help cause the rotting of seed and the seedlings of cotton,
sugarbeets and many vegetables and ornamental plants.
   Still other fungi are being used experimentally against some of
their bad relatives noted for causing stalk rot in corn.
   Plant pathologist Nader G. Vakili, who works at the USDA
agency's Cereal and Soybean Improvement Research Unit in Ames,
Iowa, said the good fungi enter and live inside the corn plant,
where they eat away at the rot fungi.
   Vakili sprayed spores of Melanospora damnosa on corn plants in
test plots. In the first year, the beneficial fungus infected only
about one-half of 1 percent of the stalk rot fungus, Fusarium
moniliforme, in the stalks. But after five years, as the good
fungus built up in the soil, 50 percent to 80 percent were infected.
   The results suggest that strains of biocontrol fungi could be
selected for compatability with specific lines of corn, he said.
The corn would be bred to support large numbers of the fungi
organisms.
   ``In the U.S. alone, stalk rots reduce yields by some 500
million bushels annually,'' Vakili said.
   But fungi are not the only weapons being looked at by USDA
scientists. Chemist Jeffrey S. Buyer and two colleagues have
produced and tested a monoclonal antibody, a custom-built protein,
that will seek out and fasten onto iron-hoarding compounds called
siderophores.
   Virtually all bacteria and fungi, good and bad alike, produce
siderophores to meet their own iron needs, Buyer said. Sometimes,
but not always, these compounds help control pathogens.
   ``Right now, we have no good methods to study the compounds in
their natural state or determine why they sometimes do and
sometimes don't help control disease organisms,'' Buyer said.
   The new antibody, which is headed for greenhouse tests this
summer on roots of barley seedlings, hopefully will seek and bind
to siderophores so they can be measured and studied more fully.
   Eventually, it may be possible for farmers and home gardeners to
make bad microbes anemic by loading the soil with certain
beneficial bacteria that will deprive the pathogens of their iron
supply.

   Charles Robinson had one of your better
supporting roles on TV as Newdell, Dabney Coleman's intimidating
makeup man on ``Buffalo Bill.''
   When the critically acclaimed comedy failed to reach a wide
audience and was canceled by NBC, Robinson landed on his feet in
yet another great supporting role, on NBC's ``Night Court.''
   ```Buffalo Bill' was a wonderful show,'' Robinson said. ``But
unfortunately it didn't make it. I thought maybe my career was
over. Then I heard I might go to `Night Court.' Three days later I
got the call.''
   Robinson joined the ``Night Court'' cast in September 1984 when
the show began its first full season. He has been with the hit
comedy ever since as laid-back court clerk Mac Robinson.
   The series features a parade of defendants through the
unconventional night-time New York court session. It's sometimes
difficult to separate the itinerant loonies from the officers of
the court.
   Harry Anderson stars as the hip judge, John Larroquette has won
four Emmys as the licentious prosecutor, Markie Post is the perky
defense attorney and Richard Moll and Marsha Warfield are the
bailiffs.
   ``Mac's a more difficult character to play than Newdell was on
`Buffalo Bill,''' Robinson said. ``He's a wonderful guy, but it's
hard to play a guy like that. Newdell had all those colors, he was
unpredictable. Newdell could show up in a dashiki. What do you
dress Mac in? Khakis and a sweater.
   ``Mac's the normal person on the show. He stands back and
observes the others. But he also participates in the craziness. He
can say something that shocks me. He has better control than the
others. I love playing Mac. It takes a lot of discipline. He's
always on the verge. He senses what's going on and can be touched
by it. Newdell would step away, but Mac sees them as part of his
family.''
   ``Night Court'' is a variation on the concept of ``Barney
Miller'' and was created by Reinhold Weege, a former producer of
``Barney Miller.'' The show had a tough shakedown and was not an
immediate hit.
   It has also undergone a lot of cast changes. Anderson,
Larroquette and Moll are the only members of the original cast.
Selma Diamond began as the caustic, wisecracking bailiff, and after
her death from lung cancer in 1985 she was replaced by Florence
Halop. Halop also suffered from lung cancer. She died in 1986 and
was replaced by Warfield.
   Karen Austin was the first court clerk and Paula Kelly was the
first defense attorney.
   ``They're taking Mac in a new direction,'' said Robinson. ``Mac
has always wanted to be an attorney, and they're sending him back
to school.''
   Mac also got married on the show, to an Asian woman named Quon
Lee, played by Denice Kumagai. ``I think a lot of it's based on my
own life,'' he said. ``My wife is from the Philippines.''
   Robinson grew up in Houston, Texas, where he organized a singing
group called the Drells and worked in local theater.
   ``I always wanted to entertain,'' he said. ``When I was 5, I
wanted to be a minister. Then I started singing with various
groups. But after a while I got discouraged. I wasn't thinking
about acting, but I was watching television and saw Bill Cosby and
said, `I bet I can do that.'''
   He studied at a Houston workshop, but felt he wasn't getting
anywhere and quit. ``Chris Wilson, the (workshop) director, called
me and asked me to come back and I never quit again,'' he said.
``She gave me a scholarship. After about five years I moved to Los
Angeles.''
   He also trained with Cecil Pickett, a well-known Houston drama
teacher and father of actress Cindy Pickett. ``He challenged me,''
Robison said. ``When I was young my attitude was that I knew it
all. He would see if I wasn't giving my all. I'd drive home in
tears. Finally, I decided to listen. He was so important to my

<HEAD>Most American Companies Reacting Cautiously to Chinese Turmoil</HEAD>

   U.S. companies operating in China are reacting
to the tumultuous political events there by delaying visits and
telling expatriate workers to avoid street protests, but few are
taking people out of the country.
   Most companies believe it's premature to even consider
divestment or withdrawal, particularly because the protests aren't
anti-foreign and violence has been rare.
   But many were surprised at how quickly the government's seeming
stability weakened because of the demonstrations for democratic
reforms gripping Beijing.
   ``So much depends on what ultimately happens here,'' Jerome
Cohen, a lawyer and expert on doing business with the Chinese, said
in a telephone interview from his Hong Kong residence.
   ``I'm still holding open the possibility that a new surge of
modernization, a more open China, could come out of this,'' he said.
   Roger Sullivan, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, a
Washington-based association of American companies with interests
in China, said business requests for information have multiplied to
50 or 60 daily since the crisis intensified, vs. two or three a day
ordinarily.
   But Sullivan said he knew of no companies that were rethinking
their long-term plans in China.
   ``There's a lot of hand-wringing going on. But companies are
intelligent enough not to make decisions in that environment,'' he
said. ``Companies don't react to something like this until they see
the longer-term implications.''
   The unprecedented demonstrations come against a background of
broadening U.S. business operations in the world's most populous
country, with ventures as ranging from open-pit coal mining to
nuclear power.
   The United States is a leading foreign investor in China and one
of its most important trading partners. More than 600 U.S.-Chinese
joint ventures have been established since the countries normalized
relations a decade ago.
   Telephone interviews Tuesday with business consultants and
executives in the United States, China and Hong Kong suggested many
visits to Beijing had been delayed until the political crisis
stabilizes.
   Most postponements were attributed to a U.S. State Department
travel advisory and uncertainty over whether the demonstrations
would turn violent.
   ``Everybody is just tentatively rescheduling things,'' Cohen
said.
   Some companies also curtailed Beijing operations.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., for example, closed its
office temporarily over the weekend and offered its 27 U.S.
staffers the option of sending family members out. Spokesman Rick
Wallerstein said it was unclear whether any had left.
   ``We've closed the office just because we don't want our people
coming in to work in light of that situation,'' he said. ``We've
also asked them to stay in their residences as much as possible,
avoid public gatherings and not carry cameras around with them.''
   Among other U.S. companies with offices in Beijing, Bechtel
Group Inc. said three expatriate employees temporarily had left the
country and United Technologies Corp. said one had, partly because
the protests paralyzed traffic in much of the capital, making
ordinary work nearly impossible.
   ``It's really not business as usual there,'' said Larry Miller,
a spokesman for Bechtel. ``So we sent our three non-Chinese
employees to Hong Kong on a temporary basis, until normal business
conditions return to Beijing.''
   Others _ including International Business Machines Corp. and
Chrysler Corp.'s jeep joint-venture _ were said by sources in
Beijing to have evacuated an undetermined number of staffers and
dependents. But spokesmen for those companies said they were
unaware anyone had left due to the crisis.
   Nevertheless, IBM spokesman Tim Sheehy said the computer giant's
50 expatriates in Beijing were taking what he described as prudent
precautions.
   ``We just make sure the employees are using good sense,'' he
said. ``If you can't get to work, don't come to work.''
   Preston Torbert, a partner and Chinese legal expert at the
Chicago-based law firm Baker &amp; McKenzie, which has offices in
Beijing, said he was unaware of any clients withdrawing plans for
investment or business negotiations.
   Torbert also said many business representatives in Beijing were
rooting privately for the protesters' cause of greater freedom and
democracy.
   ``In fact, people are excited to be there,'' he said. ``It's
such an exciting moment. What are you going to tell your
grandchildren, that you left?''

<HEAD>As Atlantis Failed, Casino President's Status Went With It</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jeanne Hood once could count herself
among Atlantic City's most powerful women, the only female casino
president in this oceanside gaming resort.
   But the president of Elsinore's Atlantis Casino Hotel lost her
status as she presided over the demise of the financially troubled
casino.
   ``Everybody liked her quite a while ago. She seemed like she was
working toward everyone's benefit,'' pit clerk Charles Hersh, one
of more than 1,200 laid-off casino employees, said Tuesday on his
way to the unemployment office.
   ``Everyone used to be fairly well impressed with her intentions,
but in hindsight, everything she did was bad,'' he said.
   The state Casino Control Commission on Monday closed the
Atlantis, which had run up $150 million in debts. Regulators are
considering a bid by developer Donald Trump to buy the Atlantis for
$63 million and convert it into a luxury non-casino hotel.
   About 600 hotel and restaurant employees still on the Atlantis
payroll are anxiously watching the outcome of Trump's purchase
agreement, which is being challenged by the casino's
state-appointed conservator.
   Mrs. Hood wasn't around for the casino's final day of gaming on
Sunday, her 63rd birthday. Atlantis spokesman Robert Arrow said
Tuesday that Mrs. Hood is in Las Vegas. Repeated attempts to reach
her directly or through a spokesman were unsuccessful.
   During the casino's chaotic final two years, Mrs. Hood was a
study in contrasts. She dressed elegantly, but said she drove to
the local mall in a Honda she kept in the Atlantis parking garage.
   During an employee strike in 1987, pickets chanted ``Jeannie
Hood, she's no good'' while faithful workers talked with reporters
inside about her loyalty to the company.
   And though her fondest dream was to see news reports stop
referring to the Atlantis as the ``financially struggling casino,''
Mrs. Hood failed to accomplish just that.
   Marvin B. Roffman, a gaming analyst for Janney Montgomery Scott
Inc. of Philadelphia, said strained relations between Mrs. Hood and
workers often were reflected in the treatment of customers.
   ``Their level of tips was at half the level of the other houses,
but a lot of them stayed because they could not get similar jobs in
other casinos. Most casino jobs in Atlantic City today are
entry-level,'' he said.
   In Mrs. Hood's defense, Roffman said she inherited an
ill-designed and ill-managed casino from her arrival in late 1985.
The three-level casino floor was never popular with customers, and
the Atlantis is burdened with a heavy debt structure.
   The Atlantis also failed at a marketing campaign aimed at
middle-class customers that steered away from high-rollers who pump
money into gaming halls.
   Mrs. Hood succeeded her husband David as president of the Four
Queens Casino Hotel in Las Vegas, Nev., which also is owned by
Elsinore Corp., after his death in 1977. She has said the promotion
was a matter of convenience as employees accepted her as readily as
her popular spouse.
   Mrs. Hood added the job of president of Elsinore's Atlantic City
operations eight years later when the president quit. A month after
her arrival, Playboy Enterprises Inc., a former partner that was
owed money on a promissory note, filed an involuntary bankruptcy
petition against the Atlantis.
   The casino promptly filed for bankruptcy itself, seeking
protection from its 15,000 creditors. Mrs. Hood has candidly
admitted she had no idea what bankruptcy meant at the time.
   In the ensuing years, Mrs. Hood lived full-time at the Atlantis,
returning to her Nevada home occasionally for family visits.
   ``I have the touch and feel of the property,'' she said in a
1988 interview. ``I have my arms around it.''
   But in the casino's final weeks, Mrs. Hood could only watch as
the state handed control to a conservator and then ordered the
Atlantis closed. On one of her final walks through the casino, many
employees called her unflattering names. Mrs. Hood reacted by
smiling and waving.

<HEAD>Dukakis Unveils Anti-Takeover Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has proposed
erecting some of the nation's toughest barriers to hostile
takeovers in an effort to protect the Massachusetts miracle from
corporate raiders.
   The former Democratic presidential candidate said Tuesday the
barriers would include mandatory severance pay for workers laid off
during takeover battles and a higher percentage of share ownership
required for control.
   Dukakis said he hoped the package would inspire similar measures
across the nation. He had called for anti-takeover action during
last year's presidential campaign.
   ``In the absence of federal action ... the states have got to
move _ and we're going to move,'' he said.
   The governor outlined the legislation in Cambridge's Technology
Square, outside the headquarters of Polaroid Corp., which recently
staved off a $3.1 billion hostile bid from Shamrock Holdings Inc.
of Burbank, Calif.
   Dukakis said Polaroid's experience helped shape the bill.
   The instant photography company, which is incorporated in
Delaware, made use of a Delaware law that bars completion of a
takeover for three years unless the raider either gets approval of
the target company or buys 85 percent of its stock.
   By placing millions of its shares in friendly hands through an
employee stock ownership plan, Polaroid made it virtually
impossible for Shamrock to reach the 85 percent level.
   The Massachusetts law would go further, raising the threshold to
90 percent. The law would also be triggered earlier _ delaying a
takeover as soon as a hostile bidder acquires 5 percent of a public
company's stock, rather than 15 percent, as in Delaware.
   The bill was drafted by a 27-member commission appointed by
Dukakis and including labor leaders, corporate executives, lawyers
and legislators.
   Some provisions, such as the severance pay, are expected to draw
opposition from business lobbyists. Merger specialists also
predicted that the 5 percent threshold would be challenged in court
as an unconstitutional intrusion on federal authority over
interstate commerce.
   ``It's an admirable effort, but the question is going to come
down to state regulation versus federal regulation, and I think
there's going to be a lot of debate about it,'' said Thomas J.
Dougherty, a partner in the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher &amp; Flom. ``They're going to be in and out of court.''
   Dukakis maintained the legislation was not designed to ban all
takeovers, or even all hostile takeovers.
   Rather, he said, ``the aim is to force takeover artists to be
socially responsible'' and block them from buying companies, laying
off workers and then selling the companies piecemeal at big profits.
   Among the legislation's provisions is a requirement that an
acquiring company assume all of the takeover target's labor
contracts.
   In addition, boards of directors would be given explicit
permission to consider the interests of employees, customers and
communities in deciding whether to reject a takeover offer. That
would help insulate directors from lawsuits by shareholders who
favor selling out quickly for the highest price.
   From the time a raider acquires 5 percent of a company's stock
until two years after the takeover is completed, all employees who
are laid off without good cause would be entitled to two weeks
severance pay for each year they had been employed.
   Also, the legislation would make it easier for corporations to
set up shareholder rights plans, or ``poison pill'' defenses, which
boost the price of a takeover by giving shareholders an automatic
right to buy additional shares.
   Proponents of the takeovers that have reshaped corporate America
in the 1980s contend that hostile bids have shaken up entrenched
managers and forced companies to pay more attention to providing a
good return to stockholders.
   But Dukakis said in Massachusetts the most common takeover
targets are not weak companies, but well-run firms whose stock is
undervalued because executives focus on long-term opportunities not
quarterly profits.
   ``It's our best corporate citizens that are being attacked _
it's the Polaroids, the Primes, the Gillettes, the Stop 'n'
Shops,'' he said, referring to a string of Massachusetts companies
that have faced takeover battles in recent years.

   Pan Am Corp. isn't taking seriously a
statement by a New York man who says he heads a group formulating a
proposal to acquire Pan Am and NWA Inc. simultaneously for $4.9
billion.
   The printed statement released in New York on Tuesday said a
company called Trans Global Holdings Inc. was in the final stages
of creating an investor group that might bid up to $130 a share for
NWA and up to $7 per share for Pan Am for the $4.9 billion total.
   In addition, the company would acquire up to 300 new aircraft
for more than $22 billion, the statement said.
   Michael Stern, who was identified as chairman of Trans Global,
declined to elaborate but said in a telephone interview that the
announcement was not a hoax.
   Jeff Kriendler, a Pan Am spokesman, said Stern has shown
previous interest in acquiring Pan Am but has not made a legitimate
bid.
   ``He never has been able to demonstrate any financial support
and in view of that history we would not view this proposal as
being credible either,'' Kriendler said.
   NWA, parent of Northwest Airlines, has been contacted by Stern
but has not received a bid from him, said Kevin Whalen, a spokesman
for the nation's fourth-largest carrier.
   To limit the impact of the Trans Global announcement and provide
time for traders to review it, the New York Stock Exchange halted
trading in shares of the two airlines for about 25 minutes Tuesday
afternoon.
   NYSE spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin later termed Stern's news release
as appearing ``somewhat less than credible.''
   NWA stock closed up $2.12{ at $106 a share. Pan Am rose 37{
cents to $4.75.
   The Trans Global statement said further information could be
forthcoming by next week, but did not indicate who would finance
the plan.
   The statement said a ``major Wall Street investment banking firm
and a major domestic banking institution had indicated an interest
in participating'' in the joint bid. But Stern declined to identify
the institutions and would not provide details about himself when
questioned by telephone.
   The news release described Trans Global as a ``privately held
New York-based holding company.''
   The release said a former senior official of the U.S.
Transportation Department, who was not identified, had expressed
interest in acting as the group's legal adviser. It also stated the
bid would include up to $600 million of equity and would not result
in the breakup of either airline.
   Northwest, which has been a takeover target since late March,
has invited interested buyers to submit bids by May 30. Pan Am
announced May 9 that it might submit an offer, but it was
continuing to seek financing.
   Mike Hamilton, an airline industry analyst for Piper Jaffray &amp;
Hopwood Inc. of Minneapolis, said he never had heard of Trans
Global.
   Curt Kruse, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association at
Northwest, said he had no information on the Trans Global bid.
   ``There's a lot of little outfits coming out of the woodwork
here to try to get their moment in the sun,'' Kruse said. ``(Trans
Global) could be the sultan of Brunei for all we know.''

<HEAD>S&amp;L Sues Government Over Attempt to Leave FSLIC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Great Western Financial Corp. claims that
federal regulators unfairly thwarted the savings and loan company's
plan to leave the thrift industry's federal insurance fund.
   The widely watched tussle between the large thrift and the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board demonstrates the anger felt by
managers of healthy S&amp;Ls who blame sloppy or dishonest rivals for
the present crisis in the fund that insures customers' deposits.
   Great Western, the nation's third-biggest thrift, stands to lose
$20 million this year because of the Bank Board ruling. That amount
is the difference in the cost of coverage by the Federal Savings &amp;
Loan Insurance Corp. and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. _ the
fund for banks.
   Great Western filed suit against the government in federal court
Tuesday, one day after the Bank Board rejected its proposal to
merge two subsidiaries in a deal that would, in effect, take the
company's big California operation out of the FSLIC.
   The suit calls the decision ``arbitrary and capricious'' and
contends Great Western met the legal requirements for changing
insurance funds.
   ``The Bank Board's erroneous refusal to approve the application
unjustifiably imprisons Great Western Bank within the ailing FSLIC
system,'' the company said in announcing the suit.
   Bank Board spokesman Mark Adams said officials had expected the
suit, and stood by their decision.
   Great Western Financial, a Beverly Hills-based S&amp;L holding
company, sought to merge its California subsidiary, Great Western
Bank, into another subsidiary, Great Western Bank of Bellevue,
Wash. (Despite the use of bank in the names, both institutions are
chartered as savings and loans.)
   The Bellevue institution already has fled the FSLIC. The
California S&amp;L is barred from such a switch by state law, but by
merging into the smaller Washington institution would be able to
change insurance funds.
   Great Western Financial, with $35 billion in assets, has 280
retail S&amp;L branches in California, Washington state, Florida,
Arizona and New York.
   Its chairman and chief executive, James Montgomery, has been
outspoken in his belief that healthy thrifts are being unfairly
tapped to make up losses incurred by the one-third of the industry
that is in trouble.
   The FSLIC is strapped by a wave of failures and federally forced
mergers among thrifts pummeled by failing real estate markets in
some states and, according to some critics, by fraud and
mismanagement that regulators overlooked.
   FSLIC insurance, which once cost about the same as FDIC
insurance for banks, has nearly doubled in price because of
surcharges imposed to replenish the fund because of the wave of
failures and mergers.
   In order to preserve the insurance fund, Congress in 1987
imposed a moratorium on departures from the FSLIC. But Great
Western is among some 30 thrifts that could qualify for exemptions
to the moratorium because they stated an intent to leave the fund
before the moratorium was approved.
   Among those thrifts that have applied to leave the fund is the
nation's biggest thrift-holding company, H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co. of Los
Angeles, parent of Home Savings of America.

<HEAD>Four Plead Guilty In Penny Stock Fraud Scheme</HEAD>

   In the latest crackdown on penny stock
fraud, four former employees of a defunct brokerage have pleaded
guilty in connection with a scheme prosecutors say bilked customers
nationwide of $67 million.
   ``These are not mere technical violations of securities laws,''
U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. said Tuesday. ``They were blatant
frauds that cost investors millions of dollars.''
   The Paramus-based company, F.D. Roberts Securities Inc.,
systematically manipulated stock prices that bilked thousands of
customers across the country, Alito said.
   Before declaring bankruptcy last February, the company also had
offices in Boca Raton and Tampa, Fla., and in California.
   Robert Humphrey, F.D. Roberts' former national sales manager,
admitted in U.S. District Court here to conspiring with other top
management at the firm to use dozens of fraudulent techniques to
sell the stocks.
   Humphrey faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $1
million. He specifically pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy
to commit securities fraud, and three counts of securities fraud.
   Also pleading guilty to related charges were Kenneth Eisen, the
former manager of the firm, and Pamella Rutherford, a broker, both
of Boca Raton; and Glenn Siesser, a broker, of Highland Beach, Fla.
   Eisen and Rutherford pleaded guilty to one count each of
securities fraud. Seisser pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.
   All face maximum sentnces of five years in prison and fines of
$250,000.
   U.S. District Judge Nicholas H. Politan will sentence them Aug.
22.
   Alito said the first step in the scheme was for F.D. Roberts to
locate or create companies, which usually existed only on paper and
had few or no assets.
   The companies would then make an initial public offering of the
stock. F.D. Roberts would then purchase the stock in nominee
accounts that its officals referred to as ``dirt-bag'' accounts,
Alito said.
   F.D. Roberts' stockbrokers would then conceal their ownership in
the accounts while they touted and sold the securities at inflated
prices, Alito said and Humphrey admitted in court.
   The sales manager hired a young, inexperienced sales staff with
little or no training in securities. The employees used
high-pressure, badgering telephone sales techniques to sell the
stock.
   Alito said up to 250 of the brokers worked at any given time,
some of them making up to $250,000 a year.
   Alito said he would seek restitution for the investors, but he
added officials are not sure where all the money generated by the
F.D. Roberts is.

<HEAD>Southmark To Sell Integon Insurance Unit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Debt-laden Southmark Corp. has agreed to sell its
largest insurance subsidiary for $135.5 million as it pares down
its holdings and looks for cash.
   Southmark, which is in violation of agreements with holders of
about $1.1 billion in bonds, said Tuesday it had reached agreement
in principle to sell its 89 percent stake in Integon Corp. for
$5.21 a share to a partnership of Jupiter Industries Inc. in
Chicago and Head Insurance Investors LP.
   Integon's other stockholders will receive no less than $22.72
million, or $7 a share, for their holdings under the agreement.
   In addition, Southmark also will receive $30 million in
preferred stock in exchange for the $35 million in preferred stock
it currently holds in Integon.
   Southmark has been shopping Integon, based in Winston-Salem,
N.C., and its other insurance holdings since January when its two
top officers were ousted by outside directors.
   ``The proposed sale of Integon is another step in our efforts to
downsize Southmark through selective asset sales,'' said Chairman
Arthur G. Weiss, brought in to run the company after Chairman Gene
E. Phillips and Vice Chairman William S. Friedman were forced out.
   Southmark spokeswoman Susan Seiter said the sale will help the
company's cash flow, but will not bring it into compliance with net
worth provisions of the outstanding bonds.
   Southmark said two weeks ago stockholders' equity had fallen
from $701 million on June 30, 1988 to a negative $428 million on
March 31. Although the change opens the door for creditors to begin
proceedings to force Southmark into bankruptcy, they have not done
so and Southmark says it can continue to pay interest on the bonds
for some time.
   The sale is subject to further discussions among the parties,
including obtaining fairness opinions and regulatory board approval
of the various companies.
   Integon, with assets of more than $1.4 billion, last week
reported first-quarter income of $4.89 million, compared with last
year's $580 million loss in the first quarter.
   The company markets a diversified line of life insurance and
annuity products, especially property and casualty insurance and
private mortgage insurance through nine subsidiaries. Although most
operations are in the Southeast, it is licensed in 47 states and
the District of Columbia.
   The sale also comes in the midst of a bitter fight for control
of Southmark, which two weeks ago announced a $1.04 billion
quarterly loss due primarily to an $829 million writedown of its
real estate assets.
   Herbert Parks, a Greensboro, N.C., developer and real estate
investor, is leading a proxy fight to win three seats on
Southmark's seven-member board of directors.

<HEAD>Producers Anxious To See Bush Import Plan</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Conference scheduled to begin at 10 a.m.; Lead prospects uncertain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steelmakers are trying hard not to look
prosperous as they wait for President Bush to unveil his plan for
extending restraints on steel imports.
   Prices are up, but not as high as they were when President
Reagan established five-year quotas on steel imports in late 1984,
domestic producers say as they gather in Washington for their
annual meeting starting today.
   Supplies of certain products are tight, but not because of
Reagan's Voluntary Restraint Agreements. The market is working as
it should, they say.
   ``And they probably made $3 billion last year, so it's kind of
hard to claim injury,'' said Charles Bradford, steel analyst for
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   ``Under the trade rules, they have to be injured'' by imports to
get trade protection, he said.
   ``They have a real problem,'' Bradford said. ``But since Bush
promised, you'd better believe they are going to get it.''
   An extension of Reagan's VRAs was a last-minute campaign promise
by Bush, and during their meeting steel executives are expected to
call on the president to fulfill his pledge promptly.
   Legislation enabling the president to enter another round of
quota agreements with steel-producing nations has 57 co-sponsors in
the Senate, nearly twice the number who sponsored the 1984 quota
bill. The American Iron and Steel Institute counts 231 House
members as co-sponsors.
   With the broad support in Congress for renewal of VRAs, the
industry's big questions concern the duration and strength of the
Bush program, not whether there will be another round of quotas.
   Among options being discussed in Washington is a two-year
version of Reagan's five-year plan. Another option is a four-year
plan that would relax restraints on individual countries as they
eliminate unfair trade practices, according to Richard Bryers,
legislative director for U.S. Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa. No version has
emerged as the most popular.
   Bush is expected to unveil his quota plan as early as June.
   There is little debate that the industry has healed during the
last 4{ years, although some authorities argue the turnaround was
less the result of import quotas as of industry streamlining,
equipment upgrading and the weakening of the dollar.
   Average employment edged higher by about 6,000 jobs to 168,900
workers in 1988, the first yearly increase since 1979, according to
the American Iron and Steel Institute.
   Following losses of $12 billion from 1982 to 1986, the industry
had operating profits of $1 billion in 1987 and $3 billion in 1988.
   Exports are rising, reviving an outlet that was largely closed
to U.S. producers for much of the 1980s.
   The improvement is largely a result of a swing in the value of
the dollar compared with other currencies. When the dollar was
strong against other currencies, U.S. goods were more expensive
overseas and imports were cheaper in the United States.
   Bethlehem Steel Corp., the second-largest U.S. producer, this
month agreed to raise wages and benefits in a tentative agreement
with the United Steelworkers that is being criticized on Wall
Street as too generous.
   The agreement also could set a pattern for talks between the USW
and other steelmakers. Just two years ago, Bethlehem explored its
options under a possible bankruptcy filing.

<HEAD>Government Pushes Interest Rates Up 1 Point to 14 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government, in its continuing fight against
resurgent inflation, today pushed up interest rates a full
percentage point to 14 percent, the highest level in more than four
years.
   Weakness in the British pound triggered the increase, the first
since November.
   The Bank of England signaled the rise in British commercial
banks' base lending rate by announcing it was raising its own money
market rate to 14 percent, effective today.
   Britain's four major commercial banks, Barclays Bank PLC,
Midland Bank PLC, National Westminster Bank PLC and LLoyds Bank
PLC, responded by raising their base rate one point to that level.
   After its announcement, the Bank of England underlined its
support for the pound by intervening against the dollar, foreign
exchange dealers said.
   Both moves helped lift sterling about one cent against the
dollar but the pound quickly fell back from highs reached
immediately after the rate announcement.
   The pound stood at $1.5665 at late morning in London, down from
a high of $1.5750 after the rate increase, but up from $1.5645 in
New York late Tuesday.
   Stock prices fell sharply on London's Stock Exchange. The
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 26.2 points, or
1.2 percent, to 2,125.4, by late morning.
   The government was ``obviously reacting because it is concerned
about the fall in the pound,'' said Tim Fox, an economist at
Midland Bank.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, speaking at the Conservative
Party's Women's National Conference, repeated that high interest
rates were necessary to bring down inflation, which is running at
an annual rate of 8 percent, compared with 3.9 percent a year ago.
   She said that while the effects of high interest rates might be
uncomfortable, continued high inflation would be worse.
   A Treasury official, who wasn't identified in accordance with
British practice, said the government ``has always made it clear
that we will take no risks with inflation.''
   He said that while consumer demand is slowing, the government
couldn't ignore the fall in the currency.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, the Treasury's top
official, has repeatedly stated over the past few months that the
government was prepared to defend sterling because a decline in the
currency would increase inflationary pressures.
   The 8 percent annual inflation rate for April raised
expectations that inflation would climb higher, rather than peak at
that level, as Lawson had forecast in March. Some analysts have
said that the government might raise interest rates as far as 15
percent before they come back down again.
   The interest rate rise might not be passed on to mortgage
holders this time. Officials from building societies, which are the
major lenders of mortgage money in Britain, have indicated recently
that they might hold off on increasing mortgage rates, especially
if they view a base rate rise as a short-term measure.
   Mortgage rates were last increased in January to between 13.5
percent and 14.2 percent.
   Building societies, flush with funds, aren't keen to suppress
the mortgage market, which has already been depressed by previous
rate rises.
   The last time interest rates stood at 14 percent was in March
1985. The interest rate increase was the 10th since June, when the
base rate stood at 7.5 percent, a decade low.
   The commercial banks' corporate customers can obtain loans at
one percentage point above the base rate.

<HEAD>London Shares Fall Sharply, But Off Lows By Midday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices were sharply lower but recovering
from an earlier plunge by midday Wednesday as the bearish effect of
a rise in British interest rates was offset by indications economic
growth has slowed.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off 26.7
points, or 1.2 percent, at 2,124.9, by about 12:15 p.m. in London.
It was above the morning low of 33.3 points down, which came a few
minutes after the Bank of England signaled a rise in base rates to
14 percent from 13 percent.
   The central bank prompted the interest rate hike after the
recent plunge in the pound started to threaten the British
government's anti-inflationary strategy.
   But the late-morning news that British retail sales volume fell
a surprising 1.4 percent in April gave some comfort to the market,
suggesting that previous measures to slow the economy were having
the desired effect.
   Paul Walton, an equity analyst at the London investment firm
Warburg Securities, said 14 percent base rates probably would be
sufficient to counter inflation, without denting corporate profits
too much.
   ``This will be the final turn of the screw,'' Walton said.
   Volume came to 306.9 million shares by midday, compared with 245
million shares at the same time Tuesday.

   International telephone rates for the
first minute to 27 countries will drop by as much as 9 percent on
June 1, ITT Communications Services has announced.
   The rate reductions will apply during the standard daytime
period, which covers the hours of business for the country being
called, Amy Arutt, a company spokeswoman, said Tuesday.
   Calls from the continental United States will fall 9 percent for
the first minute to Germany, Guatemala and Panama.
   Telephone service will be reduced 8 percent for the first minute
to Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El
Salvador, Finland, France, Guam, India, Ireland, Japan, Monaco, The
Netherlands, Peru, the Phillipines and Venezuela.
   A 7 percent cut will be in effect for calls to Australia,
Singapore and Taiwan, while rates drop 6 percent to Argentina,
Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
   Ms. Arutt said the lower rates were in line with similar
telephone decreases elsewhere in the industry, and would be used to
increase international calling by customers.

<HEAD>Aetna to Resume Writing New Policies Following Prop. 103 Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aetna Life and Casualty officials say the
company will resume writing new property and casualty insurance
policies in California.
   The announcement follows a moratorium on new policies that began
after the California Supreme Court upheld most of Proposition 103
two weeks ago.
   The Hartford-based insurance company reversed itself because the
Department of Insurance is interpreting the measure in a way
``consistent with the court ruling, which clearly permits a fair
return on our business and permits us to petition for relief from
Proposition 103 rate rollbacks,'' said Aetna spokesman Jason Wright.
   Aetna was the only insurer to stop writing new policies after
the court ruling. It continued to renew policies of existing
customers.
   The court ruled that the 20 percent rate rollback imposed by
Proposition 103 is constitutional but it said insurers must first
be allowed to earn a ``fair return'' on their investments.
   The Department of Insurance has since issued a detailed form
that insurers must complete by June 3 if they want to be exempted
from the rate cut. Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie has
promised that decisions will be made by November.
   Aetna is the ninth-largest property and casualty insurer in
California. Auto insurance makes up a small portion of the
company's business.

<HEAD>OPEC President: Increase Output If $18 Benchmark Desired</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The OPEC president said an increase
in the cartel's output is needed if members want to maintain an
$18-per-barrel benchmark price through 1989, according to an
interview published Wednesday.
   ``If we wish to maintain the current level until the end of the
year, then we must increase the production quotas,'' said Rilwanu
Lukman in an interview published in the Saudi Arabian weekly
magazine al-Yamamah.
   The ministerial council of the 13-nation Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries holds its biannual meeting June 5 in
Vienna to consider production and pricing policy for the July to
December period.
   The cartel's 18.5 million barrel-per-day production ceiling for
the first six months of the year has been largely responsible for
arresting a downslide in prices and raising them beyond OPEC's
targeted $18 price.
   At times, the price has overshot that level by $2 to $3, though
oil industry analysts also attribute this hike to major oil
accidents in the North Sea and Alaska.
   Lukman, who is also Nigeria's oil minister, referred to demand
by some OPEC members for an increase in the overall quota between
one and 1.5 million barrels per day.
   ``We want a moderate and gradual increase in prices, not a
sudden one, and we therefore have to study the market to decide on
the best production level for the second half of the year,'' he
said.
   Lukman said that OPEC should have a ``moving ceiling'' which it
can raise or lower to maintain the price levels it sought.
   But he also noted that in case output had to be considerably
hiked, it would only be the OPEC member states with high reserves
and production capability that could accommodate such demand. He
listed in this respect Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab
Emirates, Iraq and Iran.
   Producers outside the cartel could harm the OPEC price system if
they did not cooperate on output levels, he said.
   ``We definitely need assurances from them that they will
cooperate with us and work together with us, not doing anything
that would harm the market,'' he said.

<HEAD>Eastern Gives America West Extra Time To Line Up Financing</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: ADDS 2 grafs at end to UPDATE with Eastern president's remarks;
No pickup</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   America West Airlines has been given a deadline
to line up financing commitments for its proposed $415 million
purchase of Eastern Airline's lucrative Northeast shuttle or see
its offer fail.
   Eastern on Tuesday gave America West until 5 p.m. today to
arrange the financing or Eastern would treat the offer as
withdrawn. Strikebound Eastern already has agreed to a $365 million
offer for the shuttle from developer Donald Trump.
   Eastern attorney Harvey Miller announced the deadline during an
abbreviated hearing before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland.
All parties in Eastern's bankruptcy case _ including the airline's
unions and creditors _ were expected to discuss the competing
offers for the Washington-New York-Boston shuttle.
   But Tuesday's court session lasted 20 minutes, and followed a
brief hearing Monday when Miller told Lifland that Eastern still
had questions about America West's financing for the shuttle
purchase.
   The parties were to return to court Thursday morning. If America
West has arranged its financing commitments by this afternoon's
deadline, Lifland must determine whether they are satisfactory
before both offers for the shuttle are considered further. Lifland
must approve any sale of Eastern assets.
   America West also must win approval from the Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey as a tenant at LaGuardia Airport. The Port
Authority's board of governors is scheduled to meet Thursday
afternoon.
   If America West is unable to line up financing, the parties will
consider only the Trump offer, Miller said.
   Trump's agreement with Eastern expires at midnight Friday and he
said Monday he would not raise his bid or extend the offer past the
deadline.
   America West, based in Phoenix, is offering Eastern $415 million
for the shuttle and $336 million for 10 Boeing 757s. Alternatively,
America West would buy only the shuttle's gates and landing slots
in the three airports for $375 million, without 21 Boeing 727s that
are included in Trump's deal.
   The 21 727s, which are older than the 757s, have an estimated
value of up to $80 million.
   Eastern filed for Chapter 11 protection from its creditors after
the Machinists union struck the airline March 4. Pilots and flight
attendants are honoring the walkout, forcing Eastern to cut back
its flight schedule by 90 percent.
   Two investor groups, one headed by Chicago commodities trader
Joseph Ritchie and the other led by former Piedmont Airlines
chairman William Howard, have submitted formal bids for the entire
airline.
   Chicago-based Midway Airlines Inc. on Tuesday indicated it had
contacted Eastern to express its interest in buying certain
properties, including facilities at the Philadelphia airport and
Eastern routes from Philadelphia to Montreal and Toronto.
   The unions want the airline sold as one entity. But Texas Air
Corp., Eastern's parent, wants to sell $1.8 billion of the
airline's assets and operate as a smaller carrier.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes said today in Atlanta the carrier
must become streamlined before it can be saved, and said pilots who
walked out in sympathy with striking Machinists may not have jobs
when the airline recovers.
   Bakes told a group of travel industry representatives that while
there are no plans to liquidate Eastern, the airline would need to
part with the $1.8 billion in assets to become financially solvent.

   The stock market inched lower in moderate
trading today, with little new economic data to move the market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 7.34 points to
2,470.67 at noon EDT. The blue-chip indicator was 5.69 points lower
an hour earlier.
   Declining issues outpaced advancers by about 4 to 3 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 691 issues down, 541 up and 576 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 83.93 million shares, down from
Tuesday's midday level of 92 million shares.
   Analysts said the market could be in for a relatively slow day,
with stocks giving up some recent gains as investors take a
breather and keep a close watch on the U.S. currency.
   The dollar continued its advance against the Japanese yen but
was mixed against major European currencies.
   ``After the 5 percent rally of the last couple of weeks it's
natural for the market to pause for rest and relaxation. That's
some of what we're going through,'' said Dennis Jarrett, technical
analyst with Kidder, Peabody Group Inc. ``The positive is that
there's not a lot of heavy selling going on.''
   Market participants also were beginning to set their sights on
the Memorial Day holiday, some market observers said.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks were
down 0.29 to 177.32.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was off
0.63 at 350.33.

   Ford Motor Co. confirmed Wednesday it had
notified dealers to offer Lincoln Continental buyers $1,000 rebates
to fight a move by General Motors Corp. on its Cadillac luxury cars.
   The incentive ``is purely a competitive action,'' Ford spokesman
Ray Windecker said. The offer, the first time Ford has had rebates
on the Continental, took effect last week. The company has a 56-day
supply of Continentals on hand, which is not unusual, he added.
   GM has been offering $1,000 or $2,000 rebates on some of
Cadillacs since May 17. Those incentives expire May 31, a week
before other GM offers run out.
   The Continental rebates continue indefinitely, while other Ford
incentives expire at month's end. Other incentives give buyers the
choice of cash or low-interest financing.
   Meantime, Ford also said Wednesday that rebates for some of its
smaller cars, including the Ford Escort and Festiva and the Mercury
Tracer, will be increased by at least $100 each.

<HEAD>British Pharmaceutical Company Posts 19 Percent Profit Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beecham Group PLC, a major British pharmaceutical
company, Wednesday reported a 19 percent profit increase for its
fiscal year, with the best growth coming from prescription drugs.
   Beecham, which has proposed merging with SmithKline Beckman
Corp. of the United States, said its after-tax profit for the 12
months ended March 31 came to 301 million pounds, or about $473
million, up from 252 million pounds, or $396 million, in the prior
year.
   Earnings per share were 39.73 pence, or 62 cents, and 33.34
pence, or 52 cents, in the same respective years.
   Revenue grew 1 percent to 2.51 billion pounds, or $3.94 billion,
from the prior year's 2.48 billion pounds, or $3.89 billion.
   The earnings results coincided with Beecham's mailing to its
shareholders of the formal document setting out the terms of its
merger agreement with SmithKline.
   The merger, on which Beecham shareholders are to vote June 20,
would create a combined company with annual sales of more than $6.7
billion, ranking it second only to Merck and Co. of the United
States among world pharmaceutical companies.
   Beecham said prescription drugs contributed strongly to its
profit, with the best growth coming from sales of newer, higher
margin products such as the antibiotics Augmentin and Timentin. But
sales of Amoxil, Beecham's long-standing antibiotic which is facing
generic drug competition, were flat.
   Beecham didn't break out results for its fourth quarter or the
second half of its fiscal year. It isn't required to do so under
British law.

<DATELINE>SCHAUMBURG, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. International Trade Commission
plans to investigate a cellular telephone patent-infringement
complaint filed by Motorola Inc. against Tandy Corp. and Nokia
Corp., Motorola officials say.
   ``We are gratified by the ITC's action and its continued concern
for intellectual property rights,'' Robert N. Weisshappel, a
Motorola vice president said Tuesday. ``We look forward to a quick
resolution of these proceedings.''
   In April, Motorola filed a complaint with the ITC against Nokia
and Tandy, seeking to stop imports into the United States of
cellular phones that Motorola contends infringe seven of its
patents.
   Motorola has asked the ITC to stop Nokia and Tandy from
importing the disputed telephones, primarily from South Korea.
   Motorola officials said they expect the ITC to hold hearings on
their request for preliminary relief in July, and further hearings
on their request for permanent relief in December.
   Motorola, based in this northwest Chicago suburb, also filed a
complaint in U.S. District Court in Chicago seeking a permanent
injunction and unspecified monetary damages, citing patent
infringement.
   Named in the ITC action are Nokia Corp. of Helsinki, Finland;
Nokia-Mobira Oy of Salo, Finland; Nokia, Inc. of Basking Ridge,
N.J.; Nokia-Mobira Inc. of Largo, Fla.; Tandy Mobira Communications
of South Korea, and Tandy Corp. and A&amp;A International, both of Fort
Worth, Texas.
   ``The ITC's vote is no indication of infringement, but to
proceed with the investigtion,'' Jim Sheets, a deputy general
council for Tandy, said today.
   ``We claim that what they say is without foundation,'' said
Nokia spokesman Dave Scott. ``We are confident our cellular
telephones do not infringe on any of Motorola's patents, and will
vigorously defend ourselves against their claims.''
   Motorola is one of the world's leading manufacturers of
electronics equipment, systems and components for world markets.
Its products include two-way radios, pagers, cellular telephone
systems, defense and aerospace electronics, and equipment for
processing and handling information.

   All Nippon Airways Co. Ltd. said today it
ordered 10 Boeing 767-300 airliners and took options to buy 10 more
in a deal potentially worth $1.5 billion.
   The first plane was scheduled for delivery to ANA in 1990, with
deliveries through 1995, airline spokesman Tim Winship said here.
   Boeing and its sole U.S. competitor in the civilian airliner
market, McDonnell Douglas Corp., are awash in big orders prompted
largely by growth in the international airline business. In
February, ANA ordered 20 747-400s for $3.2 billion.
   The Japanese airline, which sets up its 767-300s to carry about
275 passengers, plans to use the planes for medium-range foreign
and domestic flights, Winship said.
   The value of the order would reach $1.5 billion if all 10
options are exercised and engines and spare parts are included, the
airline said.

<HEAD>British Government Pushes Interest Rates to Four-Year High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government raised interest rates by a full
percentage point Wednesday, hiking them to a four-year high in a
counterattack against newly resurgent inflation that has been
worsened by a drop in the British pound.
   The Bank of England signaled the change by raising its base
lending rate to 14 percent, and major commercial banks responded by
boosting their prime lending rates one point to that level.
   It was the 10th increase since last June, when rates stood at a
decade low of 7.5 percent, but economists called the latest action
particularly meaningful. The last time interest rates stood at 14
percent was in March 1985. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
government has sought to curb an annual inflation rate which has
moved up to 8 percent in April, compared with 3.9 percent a year
earlier.
   Stephen King, an economist with James Capel and Co., said
Wednesday's rate hike is ``an important statement that the
government is not going to accommodate any inflationary pressures
growing in the economy.''
   After announcing the increase, the Bank of England also
intervened in the foreign exchange market by selling dollars for
pounds, underscoring its support for the British currency, dealers
said.
   Both moves helped lift sterling about one cent against the
dollar but it quickly fell back from highs reached immediately
after the rate announcement. The pound closed at $1.5695 in London,
up from $1.5675 dollarslate Tuesday.
   Prices fell sharply on London's Stock Exchange. The Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down 18.9 points at
2,132.7.
   But shares were off their lows on news that British retail sales
volume fell an unexpected 1.4 percent in April, providing evidence
that the previous interest rate rises were having some effect of
curbing strong consumer spending.
   A Treasury official, who wasn't identified in accordance with
British practice, said that while consumer demand was slowing the
government couldn't ignore the fall in the currency. A weaker pound
fuels inflation by making imports more expensive.
   Mrs. Thatcher, speaking at the Conservative Party's Women's
National Conference, said that while the effects of high interest
rates might be uncomfortable, continued high inflation would be
worse.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, the Treasury's top
official, said in a radio interview: ``Overheating is on the way to
subsiding. It is only a matter of time before inflation is coming
down.''
   But opposition Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock attacked the
government's move, saying the higher interest rates could broaden
the country's trade deficit, which stood at $2.7 billion in March.
   Economists predict the British economy will grow between 2.5
percent and 2.8 percent this year, vs. 3.8 percent in 1988.

   The U.S. dollar rose Wednesday against all key
currencies except the British pound in nervous European trading.
Gold prices fell.
   Currency dealers said the dollar steadied in late trading after
fluctuating over a broad range throughout the day.
   After concerted central bank intervention Tuesday and overnight
dollar-selling by the Bank of Japan, no central bank besides the
Bank of England was sighted in the European open market Wednesday.
   ``It's been very confusing today,'' said a trader at a major
U.S. bank in Frankfurt, West Germany. ``It's been up and down, up
and down. It's hard to figure what's going on.''
   The British pound, which has lost 14 percent in value against
the dollar this year, edged up to $1.5695 from $1.5675 late Tuesday
after the Bank of England hiked the base lending rates from 13
percent to a four-year high of 14 percent.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 1.05 Japanese yen to a closing 143.00 yen,
a 19-month high. Later, in London, it eased to 142.78 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Tuesday:
2.0115 West German marks, up from 2.0079; 1.7887 Swiss francs, up
from 1.7820; 6.8250 French francs, up from 6.7865; 2.2670 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.2570; 1,455.75 Italian lire, up from 1,451.50;
and 1.1985 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1975.
   Gold bullion fell in London to a late bid of $362.75 a troy
ounce from $364.25 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold fell to
$362.60 an ounce from $364.25 bid late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose five cents to a closing bid of
$364.02 an ounce.
   Silver bullion lost most of Tuesday's gains, dropping to $5.18 a
troy ounce from $5.26.

   Share prices fell sharply Wednesday on the London
Stock Exchange following a rise in key British lending rates.
   But the market finished near its highest levels of the day as
the pound strengthened and traders speculated that Thursday's
British trade report wouldn't bring any bearish surprises.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 18.9
points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 2,132.7, slightly below its
best level of the day.
   The index plunged as much as 33.3 points shortly after the Bank
of England signaled the rise in interest rates in the morning.
British banks raised their base lending rates by 1 percentage point
to 14 percent.
   The Financial Times 30-share index fell 13.4 points to 1,774.0,
and the Financial Times 500-share index fell 9.68 points to close
at 1,214.97.
   Volume fell to 468.3 million shares from Tuesday's 557.5 million
shares.
   The rise in British interest rates came after the recent plunge
in the pound had started to threaten the British government's
anti-inflationary strategy. The 100-share index has lost 72 points,
or 3.3 perent, since the beginning of the week on worries that
rates were about to go higher.
   ``The currency markets have really forced it (the rate rise)
upon us,'' one London equities dealer said.
   The market found some comfort, however, in news that British
retail sales volume fell an unexpected 1.4 percent in April,
suggesting that previous measures to slow down the economy were
already having the desired effect.

<TEXT>
   With Republicans taking the lead, the House
Judiciary Committee voted today to cut by half the increased civil
penalties that President Bush wants to impose on fraudulent savings
and loan operators and embezzlers.
   Voting 17-14, the committee adopted an amendment by Rep. William
J. Hughes, D-N.J., to reduce the proposed new civil penalties to
$500,000 for each violation and to a maximum of $2.5 million
against any one individual.
   As part of his $90 billion S&amp;L bailout package, Bush had sought
to raise the civil penalties for defrauding banks, thrifts and
other financial institutions backed by federal deposit insurance
from the current maximum of $5,000 to $1 million for each violation.
   Hughes said his amendment, which was backed by the American
Bankers Association but opposed by the administration, was intended
to make the civil penalties ``remedial rather than punitive.''
   Opponents, however, said the effect will be to reduce the
government's ability to recover billions of dollars in federal
deposit insurance funds that might be lost in the future to insider
loans, fraud and embezzlement _ the major contibutors to the
current S&amp;L crisis.
   ``The taxpayers are going to have to fork up $300 billion
because of a bunch of high rollers,'' said Rep. Romano L. Mazzoli,
D-Ky. He referred to the interest costs over the 30 years for the
taxpayer share of Bush's bailout plan.
   ``I don't think we should be worrying about remedializing
them,'' Mazzoli said of fraudulent S&amp;L operators. ``We should worry
about punishing them.''
   Five of the Judiciary Committee's 21 Democrats, including
Hughes, and 12 of its 14 Republicans supported the amendment.
   Although Bush got all he wanted and more from the Senate and the
House Banking Committee in seeking to make S&amp;L owners put more of
their own money at risk, he faced new opposition to that as well
today from members of his own party.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said he would offer an amendment today
before the House Judiciary Committee to make S&amp;L regulators go
through lengthy hearings before making thrift operators put up
billions of dollars in new capital.
   Robert Glauber, Bush's No. 2 official at the Treasury
Department, called Hyde's measure ``a grave error.''
   Bush's proposal, approved by both the full Senate and the House
Banking Committee, would raise from the current five years to 20
years the maximum sentence for bank and S&amp;L fraud and embezzlement.
The maximum fine would rise from $5,000 to $1 million.
   Fraud has been blamed by the General Accounting Office,
regulatory officials and the Justice Department as the single
biggest contributor to what has become the nation's largest
financial crisis since the Depression.
   The legislation is the price the administration is demanding for
a $90 billion bailout of the industry.
   Bush jumped into the fray Tuesday, asking House leaders in a
letter ``to hold absolutely firm against any attempt to weaken
those vital elements ... which protect the American taxpayer from
additional costs.''
   ``Now is the time for the House to act,'' Bush said in identical
letters to House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, Democratic Leader Tom
Foley of Washington, Democratic Whip Tony Coelho of California,
House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Illinois and House GOP Whip
Newt Gingrich of Georgia.
   ``Bipartisan majorities in both the Senate and House have
defeated determined special interest lobbying against the tough
capital standards needed to protect American taxpayers from a
repeat of this tragedy,'' he said.
   Hyde denied his measure is an attempt to weaken the capital
standards adopted earlier this month by the banking committee.
   ``We're not touching the capital requirements at all,'' he said.
``An effort will be made to provide for hearings under the
Administrative Procedures Act so that S&amp;Ls affected by the new
capital structure requirements will have an opportunity to get due
process.''
   But Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., a member of both the judiciary
and banking committees, described the proposal as a ``back-door
attempt to undercut the ability of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation to enforce the capital standards.''
   ``If we create a whole scheme of appeals and litigation to
prevent the FDIC from enforcing the standards, then we'll have
another run on the taxpayers because we won't have real money
representing these institutions.''
   The 51-member banking committee approved the bill three weeks
ago, two weeks after it was approved by the full Senate. The House
Ways and Means Committee last week changed Bush's proposal to make
the $50 billion taxpayer share of the bailout part of the federal
deficit over the next three years.
   After the House Judiciary Committee completes its action, the
bill still has to go before the House Government Operations
Committee and the House Rules Committee before reaching the House
floor for action there _ now anticipated the second week of June.

   The Big Three automakers reported sales of cars
and light trucks rose 2.3 percent in mid-May compared with the same
period last year.
   Sales during the latest mid-May period were helped by incentives
programs by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
The Big Three's incentive plans expired just as the mid-May period
began a year ago.
   The companies said they sold cars and trucks at an average daily
rate of 37,126 during the May 11-20 period this year, compared with
an average daily rate of 36,299 during the same time last year.
   Car sales rose 2.3 percent and sales of light trucks were up 2.2
percent.
   On May 11, 1988, large portions of the Big Three's incentive
packages expired. The selling rate during the first 10-day period
of May 1988 was stronger than what proved to be the annual rate,
partly because people accelerated their buying plans to take
advantage of the incentives.
   This year, the Big Three initiated incentive programs in late
March or early April. Ford's expires May 31 and GM's June 5.
Chrysler's incentive program runs indefinitely.
   So far this year, the Big Three have sold cars and trucks at an
average daily rate of 34,501, down 5.3 percent from the rate of
36,412 during the period last year.
   Between New Year's Day and May 20, car sales have fallen 7.7
percent and truck sales have dropped 1 percent on a year-to-year
comparison.
   Cars sold by Ford at an average daily rate of 7,616 during the
period this month, compared with 7,410 last year, a 2.8 percent
increase. Car sales so far this year were running 0.5 percent
behind last year's rate. Ford's mid-May truck sales were 6.1
percent higher than the rate during the period last year and, for
the year, were running 2.9 percent behind last year's pace.
   GM said its cars sold at a daily rate of 11,895 during mid-May
this year, up 2.6 percent from the daily rate of 11,592 during the
period last year. GM's year-to-date car sales were down 9.6
percent. Truck sales in mid-May were up 4.6 percent and down 0.1
percent for the entire year.
   Chrysler said its cars sold in mid-May at a daily rate of 3,378
this year, or 0.2 percent ahead of the 3,372-car-per-day rate
during the period last year. So far this year, the No. 3

<HEAD>European Parliament Adopts Quota Limiting U.S. Programs</HEAD>

   The European Parliament on Wednesday
adopted proposals for a law that would cut the number of U.S.
television programs shown in Europe, despite intense lobbying from
the United States.
   The proposed law will most likely be adopted by the governments
of the 12 European Economic Community members at a meeting in
Luxembourg June 14.
   The proposal was designed to coordinate broadcasting regulations
in the 12-nation EEC and includes provisions to reserve a majority
of transmission time to European works and to limit the amount of
advertising allowed on television.
   Parliamentarians adopted a strongly-worded amendment to try to
ensure that at least 50.1 percent of entertainment programs
broadcast be European-produced by 1993.
   Last week, Carla Hills, the U.S. trade representative, sent a
letter to Lord Plumb, president of the European Parliament, to
express Washington's strong objections to the proposal.
   ``The enactment of such a measure is unjustifiable and would
almost certainly have a disastrous effect on the U.S. industry's
substantial European earnings,'' Mrs. Hills wrote.
   ``Whatever benefits this television directive might promise to
bring to Europe will undoubtedly be outweighed by its extremely
negative impact on our bilateral trade relations,'' she said.
   Mrs. Hills warned that if the measure were adopted, she would
``have no choice but to consider how to proceed in response to it
under...`special 301' provisions.''
   These provisions allow the United States to issue a list of
nations that have erected the most harmful barriers against U.S.
products. The administration would have 18 months to negotiate the
removal of the barriers and if it failed, it could slap 100 percent
levies on imports from these trading partners.
   Members of the U.S. delegation said legislators had listened to
their arguments but said the TV law was ``a matter of political
concern.''
   The measure is part of steps being taken by the European
Community in its drive to form a single market _ allowing the free
flow of goods, people and money among the dozen nations _ by the
end of 1992.

   If you believe the optimists of Wall Street, the
stock market is sending out a happy message for the American
economy these days.
   The crash of 1987 is fading fast into history, without having
caused much trouble outside the world of Wall Street itself.
   And the economy, which hasn't suffered an official recession in
seven years, appears to be sailing into the 1990s with its momentum
intact and no slump in sight.
   But the six-month-old rally in stock prices that has helped
engender this kind of enthusiasm still has its skeptics. In fact,
they maintain, investors in the securities markets have drifted
into a dream world that could be setting them up for another rude
shock.
   From the middle of November through the end of last week, the
Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose almost 23 percent,
surpassing the 2,500 level for the first time since a week before
the Black Monday crash of Oct. 19, 1987.
   The average, which is the oldest and best known measure of
market trends, has moved within striking distance of the high of
2,722.42 it reached on Aug. 25, 1987.
   By some gauges that include dividends as well as the level of
stock prices, the market already has recouped all its 1987 losses
and has reached new peaks, maintains Norman Fosback, editor of the
investment advisory letter Market Logic in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
   Any way it's measured, it has been a remarkable comeback _
especially considering that it took stocks 25 years to recover from
the crash of 1929.
   The rally has drawn support from a spreading belief that the
Federal Reserve Board has found a way to steer the economy safely
past the threat of rising inflation without causing any serious
slump in production, consumption or investment.
   It also has bolstered the case of ``new wave'' economists who
believe that the system, for a variety of reasons, is now able to
withstand the forces that used to drive it into a cyclical decline
every four years or so.
   ``The new wave is on a roll,'' declares one of its most
prominent proponents, Edward Yardeni at the investment firm of
Prudential-Bache Securities.
   ``Of course, inflation is still a problem. But there are many
recent developments that should help to offset such business cycle
pressures as high capacity utilization and low unemployment, which
in the past pushed inflation higher.''
   Meanwhile, corporate earnings, a primary long-term determinant
of stock market trends, have risen sharply in the past couple of
years.
   ``The market has far firmer foundations now than when it last
moved to this general level in mid-1987,'' Fosback says.
   But a vocal group of dissenters calls this kind of reasoning not
only dubious but dangerous.
   ``Players in the stock market are dancing to a tune only they
can hear,'' says Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenburg,
Thalmann &amp; Co.
   ``When tight money bites in earnest, repercussions will ripple
through the entire economy. In many ways, the atmosphere in Wall
Street reminds us of the summer of 1987, just prior to the market
meltdown.''
   Says Raymond F. DeVoe Jr., an analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker
Inc.: ``The slowdown in the economy currently under way is supposed
to make a `soft landing' without going into recession.
   ``Several new bull market scenarios call for `the nicest
recession you've ever seen' that would lower interest rates and
cause foreign money to come surging into the U.S. stock market.
   ``In our view this all sounds like `deja voodoo' _ the best of
all possible worlds. There is a recession out there somewhere in
time and all the `new era' or `new wave' rhetoric won't make it go
away.''

   Stock prices turned mostly higher in moderate
afternoon trading today, rebounding slightly from an earlier slump.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 3.11 to 2,481.12
at 3 p.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was 3.12 points lower an

   Analysts said the market was in a consolidation phase with some
investors taking profits amid mostly even-keeled buying and selling.
   ``The market is chugging along with no serious pressure,'' said
Larry Wachtel, equities broker for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
``People don't really want to get out but don't want to make
commitments. On the other hand every time the market pulls back,
newcomers step in.''

<HEAD>Despite Big Problems in the Airline Business, Strong Season Predicted</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   From labor travails to terrorist threats to rising fuel prices
to aging planes, the nation's airlines face daunting challenges as
their busiest season of the year begins this Memorial Day weekend.
   Nonetheless, many industry analysts and travel agents expect a
strong summer for air travel, as stable fares at home and a more
valuable dollar abroad lure vacationers.
   ``I think it's going to be a record summer,'' said Louis
Marckesano, an airline analyst for Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., a
Philadelphia securities firm.
   The airline industry has been turned on its head, with
competition growing fiercer and takeover raiders swarming over
profitable Northwest Airlines.
   But the industry's biggest trauma this year, a bitter labor
strike at Eastern Airlines, hasn't resulted in the mass
inconvenience to travelers that originally was feared. In fact,
it's turned out to be a boon for Eastern's leading competitors.
   Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Pan Am Corp. and USAir Group
Inc., especially, are reaping windfall profits from the woes of
Eastern, which has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since
March 9. Together, the rivals have captured an estimated $6 million
to $7 million a day in revenue lost by Eastern, which has been
virtually grounded by the walkout that started March 4.
   The extra profits have given many big airlines a cushion against
surging fuel prices, sparing them from having to hike fares,
Marckesano and others suggested.
   Eastern's sister carrier Continental Airlines announced last
month that it was raising its ``MaxSaver'' discount fares by up to
18 percent. But Continental, often a price leader, recently
retracted the fare hike after other carriers failed to match its
initiative.
   That could signal an end, at least for a while, to what had been
a trend of rising fares. Air tariffs have increased as much as 20
percent this year over 1988, some analysts reckon.
   ``I don't think there are going to be vast increases in fares,''
said Andrew Geller, who follows the industry for Provident National
Bank in Philadelphia. ``(The airlines) have tested almost the
limits of fares.''
   The halt to the fare spiral has occurred despite a dramatic rise
in prices of jet fuel caused partly by the Alaskan oil spill and
expectations of possible short oil supplies.
   Jet fuel, one of the biggest costs in the airline industry, has
jumped to about 65 cents a gallon from 58.7 cents in February,
before the March 24 Exxon tanker spill that delayed shipments of
crude oil to refineries.
   Projections by Avmark Inc., an aviation consulting concern,
suggest jet fuel costs will rise even more in years ahead, hitting
at least 80 cents a gallon by the end of the century.
   Since they're not raising fares, many carriers are resorting to
more creative ways of making money.
   The most important strategy is the use of sophisticated
reservations computers to determine the lowest possible number of
cut-rate tickets that should be offered on each flight. That's why
it's often difficult or impossible to get a discount seat on a
high-demand, New York-Los Angeles Sunday afternoon flight, and easy
to fly cheaply midweek from Salt Lake City to Pittsburgh.
   The apparent slowdown in the economy, credited in part to higher
interest rates that have discouraged consumers from spending,
doesn't appear to have dampened air travel.
   ``It may darken the skies a bit, but I don't see any big storm
clouds,'' said Robert Joedicke, an analyst at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in New York.
   He expects passenger traffic this summer to be at least as good
as last year within the United States and ``stronger than a lot of
people think'' overseas.
   ``Our business is up fairly substantially for this summer over
last year,'' said David Perelman, president of DMS Travel in
midtown Manhattan. Bookings to Europe are running 15 percent to 30
percent above last summer, while domestic travel is up slightly, he
estimated.
   The anticipated growth in foreign travel is largely due to the
rebounding dollar, analysts say. The U.S. currency has been surging
in value against the Japanese yen, West German mark and British
pound in recent weeks. This means it takes fewer dollars to
vacation in Japan and Europe than it did a year ago.
   In addition, international airlines like Pan Am are sharply
discounting fares to Europe this summer. Pan Am's foreign passenger
traffic rose 1.9 percent in December 1988 from a year earlier. But
it dropped 8.6 percent in January and 14.0 percent in February _
largely as a result of the Dec. 21 crash of a U.S.-bound flight
over Scotland that has been blamed on a terrorist bomb. The
disaster scared many potential fliers away.
   Pan Am's overseas traffic has been picking up and is expected to
post an increase for May, spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said in New
York.
   Air terrorism isn't the only fear of flying that has kept
travelers away. Some would-be passengers are still wary of the
stories about aging planes that break up in midair, despite the
recent flurry of orders for new aircraft by many big carriers
seeking to rejuvenate their fleets.
   There are constant reminders. This past Tuesday, for example,
the National Transportation Safety Board laid the major blame on
Aloha Airlines' maintenance program for failing to detect fatigue
damage to the fuselage of a 19-year-old Boeing 737 that split open
over Hawaii slightly more than a year ago.

<HEAD>Market Drifts Lower As Growing Conditions Improve</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean future prices drifted lower
Wednesday in moderate trading on the Chicago Board of Trade as
rainfall in growing areas improved the prospects for good crops.
   ``The price of the new crop corn and soybeans were reflecting
enhanced soil moisture,'' said Ted Mao, an analyst for Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Soybean futures suffered as some private forecasts suggested
that the National Weather Service 6- to 10-day outlook will
indicate above-normal rain in crop areas.
   But wheat prices were up on news from exporters that Egypt
bought about 300,000 metric tons of U.S. soft red winter and soft
white wheat.
   Corn prices were mostly lower, but up from the day's low because
of technical support and spillover from a rally in soybean futures.
   ``As is the case in general, the market tends to overdo
itself,'' Mao said. ``We went from inflated levels to levels low
enough that we assume we will have an above average crop. The
growing season is still a long one.''
   At the close, wheat was 2{ cents lower to 3} cents higher with
the price for delivery in July at $3.92\ a bushel; corn was 3\
cents to 5} cents lower with delivery in July at $2.61}; oats were
1 cent to 2 cents lower with July at $1.73{ a bushel; soybeans were
2 cents to 8 cents lower with July at $6.96{ a bushel.

   Turmoil within the airline industry has some
passengers a little nervous, but they're still flying and generally
want the government to stay out of the business.
   Random interviews with travelers by AP reporters at big airports
nationwide suggested the underlying demand for airline seats
remains strong as the country heads into the traditional Memorial
Day summer kickoff.
   At the same time, there's a high level of awareness by the
traveling public on issues confronting the airline industry.
There's a bitter Eastern Airlines strike, Northwest Airlines is on
the auction block and aging aircraft is a frequent topic.
   Flying ``is probably less safe because some of the jets are a
lot older,'' said Mike Osborne, a St. Louis businessman passing
through Chicago's O'Hare International Airport this week.
``Structurally they're beginning to have problems, I guess.''
   Many carriers are rushing to buy airplanes to expand and replace
their fleets. This past Tuesday, the National Transportation Safety
Board reported an ``industry-wide deficiency'' in the inspection of
the popular but aging Boeing 737 airplanes.
   ``Everybody's on strike,'' Richard Siska, a St. Louis
businessman said in Chicago. ``You've got management doing work
that they're not qualified to do, and it's the passengers who take
the risks.''
   Despite the concerns, ``flying is still safer than driving,''
said Jason Manning, a jewelry salesman traveling through
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
   ``It's safer than driving a car,'' said Jeff Reistroffer, 32, a
Fairbanks, Alaska, resident arriving at Los Angeles International
Airport on Wednesday.
   ``If you're going down the freeway, two cars at 50 mph, one
driver sneezes, it's all over. A pilot can sneeze and he can go all
over the place _ there's a lot of leeway.''
   Employees, meanwhile, have mixed feelings about the changes in
their industry.
   ``I haven't noticed any difference in the attitude here at
Northwest,'' said one pilot in Atlanta. ``My job has not changed
one iota.''
   But a Northwest flight attendant in Chicago said, ``I feel
secure that Northwest wants to stay in the airline business, but
buyout possibilities make me a little nervous.''
   An American flight attendant in Chicago said, ``I make less
money because of deregulation. The girls who have been flying for
more than 10 or 15 years are making 30 to 40 (thousand dollars a
year), and those who've been flying for 10 years or less only make
10 to 20 (thousand).''
   American's two-tier wage scale, where it takes 12 years to reach
top pay, is a frequent target of union criticism and was one of the
important issues in recently concluded contract negotiations.
   A businessman at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport agreed
the government shouldn't reassert its regulatory authority over the
airline business, which it largely relinquished 10 years ago.
   ``Prices are going up, there's no question. A lot of it is to
cover their operating expenses,'' he said. ``But because of
deregulation many airlines are marking down their prices to
compete. Passenger traffic is up, but I think they are
concentrating on improving their aircraft and upgrading
maintenance.''
   ``The airlines are doing just fine now and competition will
establish the price,'' he said.
   Cynthia Kensy, an Air Force airplane mechanic travel through
Chicago, was one of the few who said more regulation is needed.
   ``It's letting people get a little loose with what they do,''
Ms. Kensy said. ``Safety, service, they're all sliding a little bit
here and there.''
   The changes in the industry are having some effect on the
airports, depending on their connections with specific airlines.
   Atlanta, for example, is a major hub for Eastern and, ``at times
it certainly has been more hectic due to the Eastern strike,'' said
a Delta employee.
   But at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, the main effect
of the Eastern strike is expected to be a boost in public relations
value.
   DFW spokesman Joe Dealey said the reduction in Eastern's
operations in Atlanta should allow the Texas airport to leapfrog
over Hartsfield to become the world's second or third busiest
airport.
   DFW last year ranked third in operations behind O'Hare and
Hartsfield and fourth in passengers behind those and Los Angeles.

will also receive use of a limousine, a deluxe hotel suite, a
``beauty makeover,'' shopping sprees, a luxury automobile and
$10,000 in cash.
   Other prizes include automobiles, television sets, airline
tickets, Sears gift certificates and NBC merchandise worth $2
million.
   People can enter the contest by answering questions about NBC
programs in a questionnaire that will appear in Sears advertising
supplements. Sears will also mail an eight-page brochure about
NBC's shows to 20 million customers with Sears charge cards.

<HEAD>Woman Awarded $3.1 Million From Stockbroker, Investment Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Atlanta woman who says her stockbroker used
her investment account to generate more than $1 million in
commissions for himself has been awarded $3.1 million by an
arbitration panel.
   In one of the biggest securities case awards ever, the National
Association of Securities Dealers disclosed Tuesday that an
arbitration panel ordered that Nancy L. Cooper, 42, be paid $1
million by broker D. Elliott Dahle Jr. and $2.1 million by Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc., his former employer.
   Dahle declined comment on the award. Mrs. Cooper also declined
comment.
   Shearson Lehman spokesman Steven Faigen in New York said the
brokerage would appeal the decision.
   Mrs. Cooper charged that Dahle traded in her account to generate
commissions _ a process called ``churning'' _ and breached his
fiduciary duty, purchased stock on credit without her permission
and bought investment products that were unsuitable.
   NASD also ordered Dahle and Shearson jointly to pay attorneys'
fees and other expenses involved in the litigation, which lasted
more than seven months.
   Mrs. Cooper's attorney, Marion Smith II, said the woman's actual
monetary loss totaled about $200,000 on stocks and an undetermined
amount on the limited partnerships.
   In addition, lost investment opportunities cost Mrs. Cooper more
than $2 million, according to NASD arbitration documents filed
Tuesday in federal court.
   Mrs. Cooper's father was one of the founders of Oxford
Industries and Lanier Business Products, two Atlanta-based
companies.
   Over a period of several years, Dahle became such a trusted
adviser of Mrs. Cooper's that she approved whatever he recommended,
even though she was not sophisticated about investments, according
to the NASD complaint.
   Smith said that about half of all the stocks Dahle purchased for
Mrs. Cooper were sold in less than 30 days.
   Mrs. Cooper's complaint charged that Dahle generated $132,972 in
commissions in 1985, $852,202 in 1986 and $17,272 in 1987 by
trading in her account.

   Stock prices closed slightly higher in moderate,
uneventful trading today with little news to spur investors.
   The market opened lower behind weakening bond prices after the
Bank of England said it would raise its base lending rate from 13
percent to 14 percent.
   Stocks began to firm slightly after midday taking a cue from
rising bond prices, then moved narrowly for the remainder of the
session.
   ``The market was pretty uneventful overall,'' said Eugene
Peroni, technical analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott.
   Analysts said the market spent most of the day in a
consolidation phase with some investors taking profits amid mostly
even-keeled buying and selling.
   ``After the 5 percent rally of the last couple of weeks it's
natural for the market to pause for rest and relaxation,'' said
Dennis Jarrett, technical analyst with Kidder, Peabody Group Inc.
   Despite concern on Tuesday that the dollar was rising too fast
against Japanese and European currencies, many analysts said the
market continued to view the strengthening U.S. dollar as positive.
   The dollar advanced against the Japanese yen as well as against
major European currencies.
   The stocks of potential takeover targets, such as Avon, were
active. Oil stocks as well as steel and high tech issues also
showed broad-based gains.

Accord</HEAD>

   OPEC nations supplied slightly more oil
to the world market in April than allowed in a production accord
designed to lift crude prices, the organization said Wednesday.
   It was the first time this year that the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries reported a supply level above the
ceiling set in an agreement covering output for the first six
months of 1989.
   Private analysts have detected a recent pickup in production by
OPEC nations.
   Subroto, secretary-general of the 13-nation oil organization,
urged the producers to try ``to sustain the present hard-won
stability in the market.''
   ``Production restraint by all producers, both inside and outside
OPEC, is still necessary in view of the fragility of the present
price structure,'' he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by
the OPEC News Agency.
   The statement said 12 of the 13 members poured 17.54 million
barrels a day into the international market last month.
   The production agreement for the first half of 1989 sets a
supply target of 17.51 million barrels a day for the 12 members.
   OPEC said total production by the dozen nations amounted to
18.47 million barrels a day in April. Figures were not available
for the United Arab Emirates, it said.
   ``The so-called OPEC overproduction to which the media has been
calling attention has not been supplied to the market, but has gone
into building stocks, in a concerted effort by member countries not
to destabilize the market,'' the cartel said.
   ``During January to April, the 12 countries added nearly 70
million barrels to their stocks _ 38.3 million barrels to stocks
held abroad and 31.6 million to those within national boundaries,''
it said.
   Analysts have attributed the recent increase in production
partly to an effort by OPEC nations to stake out positions in
advance of a key meeting next month in Vienna. At that gathering,
the oil chiefs will agree on a production level for the second half
of the year and set individual quotas for each country.
   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, analysts say, want a bigger
share of the overall ceiling negotiated by the producers.
   The International Energy Agency, in its Monthly Oil Market
Report, estimated OPEC output at 20.5 million barrels a day in
April, up from 19.8 million barrels the previous month.
   The current accord, worked out in late November, set a
production limit of 18.5 million barrels a day for the entire
cartel. OPEC measures a nation's quota by figuring crude production
and the amount of oil put into, or drawn out, of stocks.
   The output ceiling, well under December levels, was set in an
effort to boost prices to a target of 18 dollars a barrel.
   Prices soared beyond that benchmark, although the rally has
eased a bit recently. West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
American crude, has been trading in the range of 19 dollars to 20
dollars a barrel.
   The price surge has been attributed not only to OPEC's
production cuts but also to accidents in oil-producing areas that
have reduced the supply in the world market.

<HEAD>Mid-May Sales Up Slightly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Car and truck sales rose a modest 2.7 percent in
mid-May from the same period last year, manufacturers reported
Wednesday, although analysts noted the sales compared with a
year-earlier period that may have been slower than usual.
   During the May 11-20 period, sales of cars and light trucks made
by the eight major U.S.-based automakers rose to a rate of 39,360 a
day from a pace of 38,334 during the same period last year.
   Last year many buyer incentives expired May 11, prompting some
consumers to hasten purchase plans in order to take advantage of
the deals. That effectively borrowed purchases from later sales
periods.
   In the May 11-20 period this year, wide-ranging incentive
programs by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp.
and some of the other major automakers were in effect.
   But analyst Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors Service Inc. in
New York said consumers seemed to be ignoring the bait.
   ``I don't know what it's going to take to bring customers back
to the showrooms,'' she said. ``I think demand is just tired at
this point.''
   Tom Webb, a senior economist with the National Automobile
Dealers Association in McLain, Va., said: ``Basically, what sales
have shown is that the underlying demand is less than what most
people expected. Given those sales, there's going to have to be
some further (production) cuts. They would be modest, though.''
   Automakers have been trimming their inventories by offering
incentives to spur sales and by cutting production.
   Ford spokesman Bill Carroll said that on May 31, when the
company's current incentive program expires, he expected another,
more limited incentive package to be announced.
   GM's program ends June 5 and Chrysler's continues indefinitely.
   The incentive programs were prompted by slower-than-anticipated
sales during the first three months of the year.
   Through May 20, car and truck sales by the eight makers were 3.6
percent behind the pace during the same period last year, which was
the second-best in automotive history. Car sales were down 5.4
percent and truck sales were down 0.3 percent.
   Ford sold cars at an average daily rate of 7,616 during May
11-20 this year, up 2.8 percent from the 7,410 rate a year earlier.
Car sales for the year to date period were 0.5 percent behind last
year's rate. Ford's mid-May truck sales were 6.1 percent higher
than the rate during the period last year and, for the year, were
running 2.9 percent behind last year's pace.
   GM cars sold at a daily rate of 11,895 during mid-May this year,
up 2.6 percent from 11,592 during the year-earlier period. GM's
year-to-date car sales were down 9.6 percent. GM truck sales in
mid-May were up 4.6 percent and down 0.1 percent for the year to
date.
   Chrysler said its cars sold in mid-May at a daily rate of 3,378
this year, up 0.2 percent from the 3,372 daily rate during the
year-earlier period. For the year to date the No. 3 automaker's car
sales were 15.6 percent behind last year's rate. Truck sales were
off 6.4 percent in mid-May and 0.4 percent ahead of the year to
date pace a year earlier.

   Gladys Stern held a peanut butter
jar in one hand and in the other she clutched the notice that
Publix Super Markets Inc. was abandoning green stamps. She took it
hard.
   Stern was on the front lines of making Fort Lauderdale the top
green stamp redemption area for Sperry and Hutchinson Co. since the
mid 1980s. For years, Stern had been turning S&amp;H green stamp books
into toasters, a breakfast set and dozens of other gadgets and
knickknacks.
   ``And now no more? Are they serious? Who decided this?'' she
said.
   The decision by S&amp;H's largest customer to drop green stamps from
its South Florida stores this Saturday reflects the troubles and
transitions at the 94-year-old trading stamp stalwart, which is
banking on high-technology ventures such as plastic shopper ID
cards to adapt to changing consumer habits. They say the days of
pasting stamps in saver books may be numbered.
   In the past two decades, green stamps have gone the way of the
beauty shop-groomed housewife. They now are largely a symbol of
nostalgia.
   In 1969, more than 77 percent of supermarkets and 20 percent of
service stations gave out green stamps. Today, the sticky green
strips are available in less than 7 percent of check-out lines and
in less than 1 percent of the gas stations.
   ``People just don't go home and lick stamps anymore,'' said Bill
Schroter, spokesman for Publix, which accounted for 35 percent of
green stamp sales nationwide last year. ``There's been a steady
decline in interest in green stamps.''
   Publix, the nation's ninth-largest supermarket chain with 361
Florida stores, cut green stamps in 1986 from its southwest Florida
stores and followed suit in northern Florida the following year.
The high concentration of elderly green stamp loyalists in South
Florida kept the program going until this month, said Schroter.
   ``Many of our younger customers didn't even know what green
stamps were,'' he said. ``It's a thing of the past that doesn't fit
in well anymore.''
   Like other supermarkets around the country, Lakeland-based
Publix have been experimenting with other shopper incentives, such
as a frequent-buyer award system the using a credit card-type
device to log visits.
   Market researchers at New York-based S&amp;H agree their traditional
following has been eroded by the popularity of discount coupons and
an increase in working couples too busy to deal with stamp books.
   Since the heydays of the late 1960s, when stores paid more than
$360 million for the postage-size presents, there are now less than
2,000 supermarkets, truck stops and other outlets that pay to carry
the stamps, and S&amp;H's revenue is down to $130 million, according to
published reports.
   S&amp;H declines to give figures on sales and jealously guards
details about its new projects.
   ``It's no secret we've been losing stores. The question is how
are we going to react,'' said a senior S&amp;H executive who spoke on
the condition of anonymity.
   The New York-based holding company Leucadia National Corp.
acquired S&amp;H in 1986 along with its purchase of PHLCORP Inc.,
formerly Baldwin United Corp.
   With little change in operations since the last century _ with
the exception of self-adhesive stamps in 1986 and the addition of
upscale items to its catalog _ the company plans to make startling
changes perhaps has early as this year.
   Shoppers across the nation may soon see S&amp;H cards with magnetic
strips to record purchases. The points will be tendered for gifts
of cash. A full green stamp book is currently worth $1.20.
   In a recent article in Advertising Age magazine, S&amp;H marketing
director George Simpson said 95 percent of customers at Weis
Markets in Pennsylvania accepted the plastic cards, and 87 percent
used them to build points for rebates or items.
   Also, the company is studying use of a sophisticated data base
to record the type of items purchased or garner demographics, such
as sex and age.
   ``We're going electronic,'' the S&amp;H executive said. ``We're not
standing still.''

   The dollar resumed its climb against all key
currencies except the British pound and Swiss franc Wednesday,
breaking the 143-yen level overseas and hitting a 1{-year high vs.
the Japanese currency in domestic trading.
   ``It's like a train. You can't step in front of it or you'll get
run over,'' said one investment banker, Jay Goldinger of Beverly
Hills-based Capital Insight Inc.
   Meanwhile, gold prices were up domestically after losing in
Europe and rising in Hong Kong. Republic National Bank of New York
said the late bid for a troy ounce of gold was $362.40, up 55 cents
from Tuesday's close.
   Currency dealers said trading was volatile here and overseas,
with the dollar starting out weak after a mixed performance Tuesday
but ending stronger in the absence of significant central-bank
intervention or signs of policy changes geared toward stabilizing
exchange rates.
   The British government boosted interest rates, which helped the
sagging pound. But dealers said there was no indication that either
West Germany or the United States would change their rates, and
they said that helped strengthen the dollar.
   Traders said the dollar firmed after reports of West German
Bundesbank officials dismissing speculation that they would hold an
emergency policy-setting meeting to possibly raise interest rates
to support the mark.
   Further helping the dollar, they said, were President Bush's
comments that he was concerned about the dollar's rise but remained
confident exchange rates could stabilize through coordination
between the Group of Seven. The G-7 includes the United States,
Britain, Germany, France, Japan, Italy and Canada.
   The dollar has risen sharply in recent days for several reasons,
including the comparably high U.S. interest rates, growing
inflation overseas and perceived weakness among the G-7 in
foreign-exchange policies.
   After concerted central bank intervention Tuesday and
dollar-selling by the Bank of Japan on Wednesday, no central bank
besides the Bank of England was evident in the European open market
Wednesday.
   The British pound, which has lost 14 percent in value against
the dollar this year, edged up to $1.5695 from $1.5675 in London
late Tuesday after the Bank of England hiked a key lending rate
from 13 percent to a four-year high of 14 percent.
   Sterling fetched $1.5700 in New York, up from $1.5645.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 1.05 Japanese yen to a closing 143.00 yen,
a 19-month high. It eased to 142.78 yen in London, and closed at
142.775 yen in New York, up from 142.30 Tuesday. Traders said the
New York close was the highest since October 1987.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday,
included: 2.0137 West German marks, up from 2.0110; 1.7855 Swiss
francs, down from 1.7915; 1.20845 Canadian dollars, up from
1.19945; 6.8225 French francs, up from 6.8100; and 1,459.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,457.50.
   Dollar rates in Europe compared with late Tuesday: 2.0115 West
German marks, up from 2.0079; 1.7887 Swiss francs, up from 1.7820;
6.8250 French francs, up from 6.7865; 2.2670 Dutch guilders, up
from 2.2570; 1,455.75 Italian lire, up from 1,451.50; and 1.1985
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1975.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $364.50 a troy ounce from $363.80 Tuesday.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $362.75 an ounce from
$364.25 late Tuesday. It fell in Zurich to $362.60 an ounce from
$364.25.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose five cents to a closing bid of
$364.02 an ounce.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex silver bullion for
current delivery rose marginally to $5.178 a troy ounce from $5.173
Tuesday. Silver bullion lost most of Tuesday's gains in London,
dropping to $5.18 a troy ounce from $5.26.

<TEXT>
   Crude oil futures prices rose sharply in brisk
trading Wednesday, a reaction to tight inventories reported by the
American Petroleum Institute.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the key U.S. crude, ended at $19.66 a 42-gallon
barrel, up 62 cents after a 43-cent gain Tuesday. The June contract
expired Monday and finished at $20.93, with a gain of 33 cents from
Friday's close.
   Prices for crude oil contracts for delivery after July all
posted sharp gains.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale home
heating oil for delivery in June rose 2.11 cents to 49.61 cents a
gallon after rising 0.52 cent on Tuesday. The June contract for
unleaded gasoline rose 2.59 cents to 66.83 cents following
Tuesday's gain of 0.34 cent.
   Analysts said prices rallied early on the inventory figures,
which were released after the market closed on Tuesday. The API
reported a 3.13 million barrel decline in U.S. crude oil
inventories in the week ended May 19, indicating high demand and
usage.
   Gasoline stocks fell 2.61 million barrels and heating oil
inventories declined 1.58 million barrels for the week, the
institute reported.
   Analyst James Steel of Refco Inc. also said supply reductions
from the North Sea due to high winds that hindered repair work on
rigs boosted the London market Wednesday and carried over to New
York. He said North Sea supply was off 31 percent for the week
ending Wednesday.
   Gasoline prices were given a boost by added demand as the
Memorial Deay holiday weekend approaches, said Andrew Lebow, an
analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.

   The stock market shook off an early slump and
closed higher Wednesday in a generally quiet session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed up 5.86 points at
2,483.87.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 8 to
7 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 762 issues up, 661 down and 534 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 178.60 million
shares, down from 187.69 million in Tuesday's session.
   The market opened lower following a weakening of U.S. bond
prices after the Bank of England said it would raise its base
lending rate from 13 percent to 14 percent.
   Stocks rebounded slightly after midday, following a rally in the
bond market.
   Analysts said the market was trendless for most of the day, with
some investors taking profits amid mostly balanced buying and
selling. Late in the day, however, traders said selling dried up.
   ``The market was pretty uneventful overall,'' said Eugene
Peroni, technical analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott. ``The
perceptions were mixed with respect to what the Fed is going to
do.''
   ``Most of the interest was in stocks thought to be potential
takeover targets,'' Peroni said. ``But there really was not any one
focal point for the market today.''
   Tuesday's session focused on activity in the currency markets,
with stocks declining amid speculation over whether the Federal
Reserve would push U.S. interest rates lower to stem the rising
dollar or whether Japan would raise its discount rate to support
the falling yen.
   Many analysts said Wednesday that despite earlier concerns that
the dollar might be rising too fast _ which could have negative
implications for the U.S. trade deficit _ the market continued to
view the stronger dollar as an overall positive. The dollar
strengthened further against the Japanese yen and major European
currencies on Wednesday.
   Market activity is expected to slow over the next two days going
into the long Memorial Day holiday weekend and then resume an
upward trend next week, traders said.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 208.58 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $6.702 billion, or 0.21
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.36 to 177.97.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Avon rose 1] to 35~
amid new takeover speculation.
   Oil stocks also showed broad-based gains with Texaco up 1 to

<HEAD>Mitterand Pledges $2.7 Billion In French Debt Forgiveness To 35 Nations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAKAR, Senegal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   French President Francois Mitterrand said
Wednesday that he will ask the National Assembly to approve the
writeoff of more than than 16 billion francs, $about 2.7 billion,
in debt owed to France by 35 impoverished nations.
   Mitterrand made the announcement at the opening of a summit of
the heads of state of French-speaking countries.
   Mitterrand announced last year at the summit of the seven
leading industrial nations that France was prepared to write off
debt service payments owed it by the world's poorest countries. He
repeated his commitment at the last Franco-African summit in
Casablanca, Morocco, earlier this year.
   At the Casablanca summit, Mitterrand indicated France was
prepared to take additional steps and write off not only the debt
service payments but all of the outstanding bilateral debt owed by
certain countries.
   ``I told the summit in Casablanca that I would go farther and
today I am keeping this promise,'' Mitterrand told the 16 heads of
state Wednesday at the Francophone Summit.
   Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, responding to Mitterrand's
announcement at the summit opening, said, ``You have created the
event of the summit before it even begins.''
   Major creditor governments agreed at the annual joint meeting of
the International Monetary Fund and World Bank last September in
Berlin to include debt service write-offs as one of three options
for easing the debt burdens of the world's poorest countries.
   Officials in Paris said France has written off almost 800
million francs, about $133 million, of official bilateral debt
service payments since the Berlin agreement. Finland is the only
other country so far to have chosen the debt write-off option.
   France had a strong colonial influence in Africa earlier this
century and has maintained its privileged relationship with many
African states.
   The debt problems of both middle-income and poor countries are
expected to be high on the agenda when leaders of the so-called
Group of Seven _ the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France, Canada and Italy _ meet in mid-July in Paris for an
economic summit.

<HEAD>Energy Prices Rise As OPEC Meeting Nears</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices climbed Wednesday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, reflecting increased confidence that the OPEC
nations will agree on production quotas for later this year.
   On other markets, grain and soybean prices drifted lower,
precious metals finished mixed, and livestock and pork prices
plunged.
   There had been speculation in the energy market that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would be unable to
agree at its June meeting on production quotas for the second half
of the year. There is greater confidence now, reflected in prices,
that an agreement will be reached, said Robert Baker, an energy
analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 44 cents to 62 cents
higher with the contract for delivery in July at $19.66 a barrel;
heating oil was 1.75 cents to 2.11 cents higher with June at 49.61
cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.13 cents to 2.59 cents
higher with June at 66.83 cents a gallon.
   Baker said the sharp rise in energy prices also can be
attributed to a report from the American Petroleum Institute that
total oil stocks in the United States are down 9 million to 10
million barrels.
   Traders also reacted to reports that Norwegian helicopter pilots
servicing Norway's North Sea oil platforms could go on strike. A
prolonged strike would cut deeply into Norway's 1.5 million barrel
daily North Sea oil production, Baker said.
   Grain and soybean futures drifted lower on the Chicago Board of
Trade as rain continued to fall in growing areas.
   ``The price of the new crop corn and soybeans were reflecting
enhanced soil moisture,'' said Ted Mao, an analyst for Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Soybean futures suffered as some private forecasts suggested
that the National Weather Service 6- to 10-day outlook will
indicate above-normal rain in crop areas.
   Wheat prices were up with news from exporters that Egypt bought
about 300,000 metric tons of U.S. soft red winter and soft white
wheat.
   Corn prices were down, but up from the day's low because of
technical support and spillover from a rally in soybean futures.
   Wheat settled 2{ cents lower to 3} cents higher with July at
$3.98} a bushel; corn was 3 cents to 5} cents lower with July at
$2.62; oats were 1{ cents to 2 cents lower with July at $1.73{ a
bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 7{ cents lower with July at $6.97\
a bushel.
   Precious metals prices were up a fraction in fairly quiet
trading on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   ``The precious metals market is still concerned about the
strength of the dollar,'' said Fred Demler, a metals analyst with
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   ``The market is oversold, but the feeling is prices will
continue on the down side,'' Demler said.
   Gold settled 20 cents to 60 cents higher with June at $364.70;
silver was unchanged with June at $5.181.
   Copper, which has given up nine cents this week, was down again
Wednesday .50 cent to .70 cent with May at $1.08 a pound.
   Increases in exchange inventories, high world-wide production
and low industrial consumption is pushing down copper prices,
Demler said.
   Livestock futures were sharply lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   The drop in the cattle market was caused by stop-loss selling
and computer fund liquidation, said Paul Hare an analyst with
Linnco Futures Inc. in Chicago.
   The drop was assisted by a weak cash market outlook.
   Pork futures reacted negatively to heavy movement of bellies
into storage and heavy hog marketings this week.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent to 1.10 cents lower with June at
69.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .65 cent lower
with May at 76.72 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent to .62 cent
lower with June at 48.45 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
1.17 cents to 1.70 cents lower with July at 33.10 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Avon Shares Bid Higher on Report of Possible New Bid</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after lead, ADDS 5 grafs to end with congressman
asking FTC to investigate Avon stock purchases; EDITS to conform; No pickup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock speculators renewed their interest in Avon
Products Inc. Wednesday, bidding the cosmetics company's shares
higher in response to a report that Avon may be the target of a
hostile takeover attempt.
   Separately, a congressman asked the Federal Trade Commission to
investigate Avon stock purchases prior to a failed bid by Amway
Corp. on grounds that investor Irwin L. Jacobs and Amway executives
may have sought to skirt antitrust laws.
   Avon stock closed up $1.37{ to $35.87{ in composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 3.13 million shares changing
hands. Composite trading volume in Avon stock on Tuesday amounted
to 962,100 shares.
   The catalyst for the heavy trading appeared to be a report
published in USA Today that said Jacobs and an unidentified ``major
company'' plan to launch a joint bid for Avon at $40 a share.
   A secretary in Jacobs' office in Minneapolis said he was out of
town and unavailable to comment.
   The newspaper said Jacobs and the company are in the process of
completing financing and other details of the hostile offer.
Jacobs' partner was said to be a company other than Mary Kay Corp.,
a Dallas-based cosmetics seller that reportedly has expressed an
interest in Avon.
   Jacobs owns 10.3 percent of Avon's common stock through a
partnership with Amway. Amway, an Ada, Mich.-based direct selling
firm last week withdrew its $39-a-share offer for Avon after Avon's
board rejected the proposal.
   USA Today said if Jacobs and his partner prevail over Avon,
Jacobs would meld part of Avon's business into his Watkins Products
Inc., which sells vitamins, beauty products and foods door-to-door.
   Avon spokesman John Cox said the company had no comment on the
report.
   One Wall Street arbitrager said the report was treated with some
skepticism and didn't trigger as much buying as it might have if
the memory of the losses sustained when Amway withdrew its proposal
weren't still fresh in speculators' minds.
   Avon stock surged to a 52-week high of $41.25 shortly after
Amway's May 10 bid amid hope that the bid might be increased. When
Amway pulled out the stock sank.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, on Wednesday asked the FTC to investigate Avon
stock purchases by Jacobs and Amway executives prior to Amway's bid.
   Antitrust laws require that a proposed merger must be reported
if the acquirer holds 15 percent or more of the target's voting
stock.
   ``In the case of the attempted Avon takeover, Mr. Jacobs and
Amway appear to have sought to avoid this requirement by arranging
for the purchase of Avon stock in the name of the A-J
Partnership,'' Dingell wrote in a letter to FTC Chairman Daniel
Oliver.
   A-J Partnership was the vehicle used by Jacobs and Amway to
launch their takeover bid.
   Jacobs and Amway have said there was nothing illegal or improper
about their stock transactions.

<HEAD>Scientists Picket Over Computer Software Lawsuits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the nation's top computer
scientists, angry over a wave of lawsuits seeking to copyright
basic computer software, picketed Wednesday outside the
headquarters of Lotus Development Corp.
   The scientists said Lotus and a handful of other computer
companies are trying to lock up rights to software that is as
fundamental to computers as a steering wheel and pedals are to a
car.
   ``If there were copyrights like this on cars, then every
manufacturer would have to give you a different way to steer,''
said Richard Stallman, a programmer at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. ``If you learned to drive a Ford, you wouldn't know
how to drive Chevrolets.''
   Chanting slogans through a bullhorn, Stallman led about 150 MIT
professors, graduate students and programmers from Boston-area
computer firms in a march from Cambridge's Technology Square to
Lotus's headquarters.
   Under gray skies and intermittent rain, they picketed for about
an hour, carrying signs saying ``Innovation Not Litigation,''
``Don't Ruin Our Industry'' and ``No Writs For Bits.''
   The rash of lawsuits includes complaints filed by Apple Computer
against competitors Microsoft and Hewlett Packard, and by Ashton
Tate against Fox Software.
   Lotus, which makes the best-selling computer accounting program
Lotus 1-2-3, is suing competitors Paperback Software International
and Mosaic Marketing Inc.
   All of the suits allege illegal copying of a ``user interface,''
technical jargon for what is often called the ``look and feel'' of
a computer program, including its basic commands, menus and
displays.
   Lotus and many other software companies contend that unless
their products enjoy strong copyright protection, they will not
have an economic incentive to develop new programs.
   ``Our argument is that out-and-out copying of other people's
work stifles creativity and innovation,'' said Lotus spokeswoman
Betsy Kosheff. ``Copyright law allows you to take other people's
work and build on it, but not to steal it.''
   The protest grew out of an advertisement placed in an MIT
student newspaper last month by Stallman; Gerald J. Sussman, a
professor of electrical engineering; and Marvin Minsky, founder of
MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
   They warned that the lawsuits could freeze out new companies,
make computers harder to use and, ultimately, retard the industry.
   ``Until quite recently, people invented things, everybody gave
each other all their software, we had fun and people made money
anyway,'' Sussman said Wednesday. ``I'd like to see that come
back.''
   Stallman, a prominent programmer who developed EMACS, a widely
used system for editing computer programs, said it is in the public
interest to have computer programs share basic attributes, so users
do not have to learn each program from scratch.
   The lawsuits, he charged, will lead to ``inefficiency and
gratuitous incompatibility,'' with ``a heavy cost for the economy.''
   Among the protesters were Brian Kocher, president of the
Association for Computing Machinery; Hal Abelson, a MIT professor
who helped develop the Logo educational computer language; Ray
Solomonoff, an eminent Boston mathematician; and Patrick Winston,
head of MIT's Artificial Intelligence lab.
   Stallman said the protesters have formed a new organization, the
League for Programming Freedom, to try to pressure Lotus and other
firms to drop the lawsuits.
   In leaflets handed out at the pickets, the group urged people to
boycott the firms bringing the lawsuits and to buy competing
products instead. They also advised programmers not to go to work
for Lotus, Apple and Ashton Tate.
   Copyright lawyers said the rash of ``look and feel'' lawsuits
began in late 1986, after a federal judge in California ruled that
a small software company, Unison World Inc., had infringed a
competitor's copyright on a program for making customized greeting
cards.
   Since then, several companies have won similar cases, but ``each
case, rather than settling the law, has tended to unsettle it and
raise more questions,'' said Thomas M.S. Hemnes, a partner in the
Boston law firm of Foley, Hoag &amp; Eliot.
   Hemnes and other attorneys said the issue of how much of a
computer's basic programming can be patented eventually may be
decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.

<HEAD>House Members Blast Unsolicited Fax Attacks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   House lawmakers Wednesday lashed out at ``fax
attacks'' by advertisers who bombard facsimile machines with
unsolicited material, and they said telephone merchandisers who use
computers to dial phone numbers at random could endanger public
health and safety.
   The lawmakers said advertisers were shooting themselves in the
foot with intrusive sales pitches that in the case of facsimiles
use up their receivers' paper and for mobile and pager-phone users
often make them pay for the calls.
   On top of that, citizens have a right to privacy, said Rep.
Barney Frank, D-Mass., the author of one of three bills that would
restrain the use of ``junk fax'' advertising and computer
auto-dialers.
   Frank told a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce
telecommunications and finance subcommittee that it was ``stupid''
to assert that restrictions on unsolicited telepone messages would
violate the senders' First Amendment rights.
   ``We're saying that you can't use technology to burden other
people,'' Frank testified. ``We're not putting anybody out of
business; we're not interfering with anybody's rights.''
   The subcommittee chairman, Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said
unsolicited telemarketing ``increasingly crosses the line between
helpful and unacceptably obtrusive.''
   He noted that in Massachusetts 200,000 phone customers _ 7
percent of the state's total _ said yes recently when asked if they
wished to be excluded from such calls.
   Computers can dial 1,000 phone numbers a day with pre-recorded
messages, Markey said.
   ``Each day they are used by more than 180,000 solicitors to call
more than 7 million Americans. Unfortunately, these machines are
often programmed to dial sequentially whole blocks of numbers,
including hospitals, fire stations, pagers and unlisted numbers.''
   ``This not only makes the machine an equal opportunity nuisance,
but an equal opportunity hazard,'' Markey said.
   Frank's bill would make it illegal to make interstate
computer-dialed calls to anyone who told their phone company they
didn't want such messages. It would require advertisers to pay the
costs for phone companies to maintain lists of such customers.
   A bill co-sponsored by Markey, Frank and Reps. Matthew Rinaldo,
Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Pete Stark, D-Calif., would require
the same for unsolicited messages to facsimile machines.
   A bill by Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., would make auto-dialed
solicitations illegal unless the calls were placed between 9 a.m.
and 5 p.m. weekdays; the messages gave the name and telephone
number of the caller; and the computer automatically disconnected
the call five seconds after the called party hangs up or refuses to
hear the message.
   Rinaldo said telephone lines have become ``life lines'' for
businesses and citizens, particularly the elderly. Abuses of phone
lines ``not only are inconvenient and costly to consumers, they
even could endanger the lives of our citizens.''
   Tying up emergency phones lines with auto-dialers that won't
disconnect ``clearly has the potential for disaster,'' Rinaldo
said. ``There may be legitimate purposes for which auto-dialers can
be used. However, they should not be permitted to endanger the
usefulness of the telephone.''
   Richard Barton, a vice president with the Direct Marketing
Association, told the subcommittee his group was ``sympathetic to
the concerns expressed by the bills.''
   He said his group opposes sequential dialing by telemarketers
and it favored standards that would require immediate disconnects.
But he said it would be very difficult to define, as Markey's bill
requires, ``unsolicited'' messages and what constitutes a
``pre-existing'' business relationship that would allow
transmission of unsolicited material to offices.
   He said there also were about 1,000 directories of facsimile
machine phone numbers and it would be ``difficult and costly'' to
purge them of names.
   He urged the subcommittee to let the marketplace decide if
unsolicited facsimile ads were going to be anything more than a
short-lived phenomenon.
   Professor Robert Ellis of the Indiana University School of Law
said many businesses want to receive ads from sellers they deal
with regularly. He said restrictions could ``chill'' normal
business correspondence.

<HEAD>All Nippon, American Eagle Announce Aircraft Purchases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   All Nippon Airways Co. Ltd. has ordered 10 Boeing jetliners and
taken options to buy 10 more in a deal estimated at $1.5 billion,
while regional carrier AMR Eagle Inc. said separately Wednesday it
plans to buy up to 100 Saab turboprop commuter aircraft in an
agreement analysts valued at $750 million.
   All Nippon, Japan's largest carrier and the eighth-largest in
the non-communist world, said in Los Angeles it was ordering and
taking options on Boeign 767-300 jetliners.
   The airline, which sets up its 767-300s to carry about 275
passengers, plans to use the planes for medium-range foreign and
domestic flights, said spokesman Tim Winship.
   The first plane is scheduled for delivery in 1990, with
deliveries through 1995, said Winship.
   In February, ANA ordered 20 Boeing 747-400s worth about $3.2
billion.
   The value of the latest order would reach $1.5 billion if all 10
options are exercised and engines and spare parts are included, the
airline said.
   AMR Eagle, the regional airline partner of Ft. Worth,
Texas-based American Airlines, AMR Eagle Inc., on Wednesday
announced plans to purchase up to 100 Saab 340B turboprop aircraft.
   AMR Eagle placed 50 firm orders and took options for another 50
Saab 340Bs, which can carry 34 passengers each on trips of 700
statute miles or more.
   Also in the agreement with the Saab Aircraft Division of
Saab-Scania AB are 50 options for the Saab 2000, a 50-seat
aircraft. Deliveries would extend into the 1990s.
   ``These aircraft will meet our needs well into the next century
and provide our passengers with the finest plane of its size
available,'' Robert E. Martens, president of AMR Eagle, said in a
prepared statement.
   The company announced the agreement at a news conference at AMR
headquarters. Terms of the deal were not released.
   Industry analysts estimated the agreement for the 100 Saab 340Bs
at about $750 million and AMR Eagle itself indicated earlier this
month it was about to order 100 new commuter aircraft in a deal
worth several hundred million dollars.
   The acquisition is the fourth major purchase by the American
Airlines system this year.
   AMR will receive its first 15 Saab 340Bs in January 1990. They
initially will be based at the airline's Nashville and
Raleigh-Durham hubs. More deliveries are scheduled for 1991, when
the airline will receive 24 planes, and in 1992, with a shipment of
11 aircraft.
   Delivery is scheduled in 1992 and 1993 for the 340Bs on option,
while the Saab 2000 options are scheduled between 1994 and 1997.
   Martens described the aircraft as fuel efficient and said they
are an important part of American Eagle's internal expansion plan.
With the purchase, American Eagle becomes the largest single
purchaser of Saab 340Bs in the world.
   With the first delivery of 50 Saab aircraft, American Eagle's
fleet will total just under 200. The American Eagle network carries
6.5 million passengers annually to 137 destinations in the United
States and the Caribbean.

<HEAD>First City to Bid On MCorp Banks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First City Bankcorp of Texas plans to submit a
bid for the 20 former MCorp banks taken over by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. earlier this year.
   First City Chairman A. Robert Abboud said his institution has
financial agreements in place to make the purchase should the FDIC
accept the offer.
   ``We are going to submit a bid,'' Abboud said Tuesday. ``I
think, as well as anyone, we know the mechanics and the fragilities
of presenting such a bid. We will be competitive.''
   Abboud led a group that completed a $1.6 billion purchase and
restructuring of Houston-based First City last year that included a
pledge to raise $500 million of private capital to go with $970
million of FDIC assistance.
   Federal officials seized 20 of MCorp's 25 banks in March,
claiming they were insolvent. The FDIC wants to sell the banks.
   Abboud said First City also has made a ``rudimentary
examination'' of National Bancshares of Texas and Texas American
Bancshares. Although he did not rule out bidding on those two
banks, he said First City is concentrating on MCorp.
   The 20 former MCorp banks, with assets of $13.09 billion, now
operate as Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank. MCorp holds the five
other banks and is operating them under protection of Chapter 11
bankruptcy.
   Abboud said he understands that May 31 is the deadline for
making bids on the Dallas-based bridge bank. The sale is expected
by July 4.

   To critics, the Vancouver
Stock Exchange has been a huckster's paradise, duping investors and
sucking up capital that could be better used elsewhere.
   To defenders, the exchange fills a valid and serious economic
function. They say it's where entrepreneurs turn to raise the
start-up capital they need, a marketplace based in the region's
mining and resource industries now moving into high technology and
other innovative businesses.
   The exchange has had its fair share of scandal and controversy
since its founding in 1907, and a new round of criticism from such
high profile business publications as Barron's and Forbes has
placed it back in the spotlight.
   ``We do specialize in venture capital, and that by nature is
risky,'' Joyce Courtney, the exchange's spokeswoman, said in an
interview. ``People have long memories ... and it seems that people
remember us by the bad company we've kept.''
   The exchange claims to be the third most active, in volume, in
North America after New York and Toronto.
   The focus on ``junior companies,'' as the exchange prefers to
call its start-up offerings, and the generally inexpensive price
tags on their stocks push the volume up. A typical trade is 2,000
shares worth a total of $2,000.
   Courtney calls the offerings on the exchange ``the start-up, the
emerging, the young.''
   Two-thirds of the companies on the Vancouver exchange still are
in precious metal mining. The other third, and the fastest growing
area, is in such venture capital fields as high-tech, agriculture
and franchising.
   ``We're still really Canada's mining exchange, but our world is
changing too,'' Courtney said.
   ``It's still buyer beware, and people don't like to hear that,''
she said. ``The venture market is not for everybody.''
   ``I think a lot of the misunderstanding is because we have less
stringent listing requirements,'' she said. ``People misunderstand
that, and we get labeled the Wild West and the Casino of the
North.''
   Indeed, Donald J. Hudson, the exchange's president, said
first-time visitors almost invariably express surprise that the
exchange is not a small operation but employs 320 people in several
floors spread through a downtown skyscraper.
   ``We've taken the position that the world and Canada doesn't
need another blue-chip stock exchange,'' he said. ``Our view is
that we've been in the venture business and we should make that our
prime thrust.''
   Hudson said that doesn't mean emphasis will be taken away from
the traditional resource-exploration stocks.
   ``But we are certainly going to do whatever we can to encourage
listings outside the resource fields,'' he said.
   On March 1, the exchange overhauled listings rules and policies,
requiring more complete disclosure about the companies issuing
stocks.
   It added special requirements for companies outside of the
resource-exploration area, partly because some of their stocks have
raised alarm-bells about the potential for hype.
   Among the hard-to-assess stocks that have cropped up on the
exchange, for example, are those from companies claiming to offer
cosmetic franchises, treasure hunts and a new way to hull rice.
   Hudson said it can't be denied that ``incidents'' have taken
place with companies listed on the exchange and, ``they tend to be
spectacular.''
   ``The way to stop all that is, stop having incidents,'' he said.
   As recently as April, former stockbroker Dale Ciochetti was
sentenced to three years in prison and fined some 300,000 Canadian
dollars, or $252,000, for for fraud in the rise and fall of
International Tillex Enterprises Ltd.
   The New York-based insurance company was underwritten at 20
Canadian cents a share in January 1985 and rose to 77 Canadian
dollars a share in 1986 before the exchange suspended trading.
   ``You can't have it both ways,'' Hudson said when asked why
fraud cases continue to surface if the exchange is making a more
serious effort to regulate itself than it has in the past.
   He objected to those who say proper enforcement doesn't exist
and then say it's all bad when a case is found as a result of
enforcement.
   ``Two years from now we won't have the court cases coming along
with the frequency they've been coming along,'' Hudson said.
   Securities commissions operate at provincial level in Canada,
and British Columbia's historically has been weak.
   Hudson said trading on the Vancouver exchange has not recovered
fully since October 1987, hit harder in value than in volume.
   ``I don't think we have bounced back,'' he said. ``Trading has
been, how shall I describe this, slow.''
   He ascribed it to worldwide trends and the slide in the price of
gold, which has weakened the price of many mineral and mining
stocks.
   Record volume of 4.8 billion shares worth $5.6 billion at
current exchange rates in 1987 declined to 3.5 billion shares worth
$2.7 billion last year. The exchange's index of all listed issues
dropped from 1150.02 at the end of 1987 to 792.72 at the end of
1988.
   Elsewhere, analysts say a loss of confidence in the exchange
also has played a part.
   John Woods, publisher of the daily newsletter Vancouver
Stockwatch, forecast 1989 as a stable year and said the overhaul of
regulations is ``a big step in the repair job that the exchange had
to do to stop its slide into oblivion.''
   Woods said no regulations can erase all bad cases on any
exchange, but the new policies should eliminate what he called the
``joke companies'' that had proliferated in Vancouver over the past
five years.
   ``You have to conclude that the VSE has been weakened,'' he
said. ``It is not in a good position to recover fast.''

   The Philippines, which has debts of more than
$30 billion, has been offered another $1.17 billion in loans by the
International Monetary Fund, officials said Wednesday.
   The offer was approved Tuesday at a closed door meeting of the
board of executive directors, representing the 151 member
governments that own the fund.
   Officials said $819 million will be available over three years.
Disbursement of each installment depends on the country fulfilling
promises about the management of its economy.
   Another $351 million will be available in case the Philippines
suffers a drop in its earnings from exports.

   Capital Cities-ABC Inc. is ending publication of
High Fidelity and Modern Photography magazines and has sold their
subscription lists and trademarks to Diamandis Communications Inc.,
Diamandis said Wednesday.
   Terms were not disclosed.
   ABC Publishing will end publication of the monthly magazines
with the July issues, according to Diamandis.
   Subscribers to both magazines will be offered the opportunity to
get refunds or transfer their subscriptions to similar magazines
published by Diamandis _ Stereo Review or Popular Photography.
   Several calls were placed to ABC Publishing for comment on why
it was closing the magazines and selling the subscriber lists, but
they were not returned.
   High Fidelity has a circulation of more than 327,000 and Modern
Photography was at more than 689,000, according to Diamandis.
   Stereo Review and Popular Photography are the leaders in their
categories, with circulation of 504,582 and 726,572 respectively,
Diamandis said.
   Peter Diamandis, head of the company bearing his name that is
the U.S. subsidiary of Hachette SA of France, said he expected that
no more than 10 percent of the subscribers to the magazines
subscribe to both of them.
   Diamandis publishes about 20 major magazines, including Audio,
Car Stereo Review, American Photographer, Car and Driver, Elle,
Memories and Woman's Day.

<HEAD>Coleco Nearing Sale to Hasbro</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bankruptcy court hearings on a proposal
to allow Hasbro Inc. to buy most of ailing Coleco Industries Inc.
for more than $85 million were adjourned for one week, a Coleco
lawyer said Wednesday.
   Daniel Golden said all pending matters will be taken up in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in New York next Wednesday.
   He declined to discuss details of a hearing Wednesday or the
proposal, citing an agreement on a news blackout reached last month.
   A Hartford newspaper reported this week that details of the plan
in Avon-based Coleco's 10-month-old bankruptcy case were still
being negotiated. John O'Neill, Hasbro's chief financial officer,
declined Wednesday to discuss the plan, but said he expected an
announcement would be made soon.
   ``We continue to work inside the bankruptcy court,'' he said.
``We would imagine that something will happen soon. However, we do
not anticipate at this point making an announcement.''
   Coleco officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
   On Tuesday, an estimated $200,000 of Coleco's surplus furniture,
office machines and manufacturing equipment was auctioned off,
symbolizing the demise of the company that introduced Cabbage Patch
Kids dolls.
   The sale, conducted by a New York auction house in a warehouse
adjacent to Coleco's Avon offices, was held to help the foundering
toy manufacturer reduce its equipment in storage and raise cash to
stay alive.
   But unnamed sources told The Hartford Courant the plan to sell
most of Coleco's assets to the Pawtucket, R.I.-based Hasbro will
likely mean the disappearance of Coleco and loss of the remaining
150 jobs.
   The Courant said the deal would involve selling most of Coleco's
assets to Hasbro, ending Coleco's 57 years as an independent
company.
   Sources told the newspaper Coleco's committee of unsecured
creditors would drop a $71 million lawsuit against the company's
largest creditors, New York businessmen Isaac Perlmutter and
Bernard Marden. Perlmutter and Marden, in turn, would reduce their
$80 million claim against Coleco.
   The lawsuit contends that Perlmutter and Marden cheated Coleco
out of millions of dollars through a complex scheme of trading
television advertising time for products.
   Coleco grew to be one of the nation's largest toy companies in
the past decade but demand for its Cabbage Patch Kids dolls wanted
and new products didn't make up lost sales. Coleco had debts of
$540.3 million when it filed for bankruptcy last July.
   Coleco's first reorganization plan, filed in January, was
rejected by the creditors' committee.
   In March, Coleco said it was considering selling the company
outright. But several weeks later Coleco said it would instead
propose a new reorganization plan offering a larger repayment to
creditors.
   The company had not filed that new plan when creditors announced
April 19 they had negotiated a deal to sell most of Coleco to
Hasbro for more than $85 million in cash.

<HEAD>CNW Defers Action On Japnonica, Sets Deadline for Bids</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CNW Corp. urged its shareholders Wednesday to
delay selling stock to Japonica Partners while the railroad company
searches for other potential buyers.
   A committee of CNW directors set a June 2 deadline for
submitting bids for the company, which operates the Chicago and
Northwestern Transportation Co., a 6,000-mile railroad serving nine
states.
   Japonica, a New York-based investment group, has offered
$44-a-share for outstanding CNW stock and already owns 8.8 percent
of the company.
   The CNW committee said it will not take a position on Japonica's
hostile takeover attempt while it talks with other potential
bidders.
   ``We decided not to take a position on Japonica's tender offer
at this time because we are continuing to investigate whether there
are alternatives ... that would maximize stockholder value,'' said
C.J. Gauthier, chairman of the directors' committee.
   ``The committee is also seeking more information on Japonica's
ability to finance its tender offer,'' he said.
   The committee's financial advisers are having discussions with
other potential bidders, as well as with Japonica.
   ``We expect to know more about where matters stand after the
deadline for bids has expired,'' Gauthier said. ``We urge
stockholders to defer acting on the Japonica tender offer until the
committee has made a further announcement.''
   Shareholders re-elected CNW directors on Tuesday by a nearly
2-to-1 margin, but management's recommendation for an executive
incentive plan was rejected.
   Japonica had urged shareholders at last week's annual meeting to
reject both the incentive plan and management's slate of directors.

   Eastern Airlines boss Frank Lorenzo said
Wednesday the imminent sale of Eastern's prized Northeast shuttle
was critical to his plan to restructure the strikebound carrier and
would give the plan further momentum.
   ``Without the shuttle sale, you can forget about our
alternatives,'' Lorenzo said in an interview with The Associated
Press shortly before a federal bankruptcy judge approved a deal to
sell the shuttle to developer Donald Trump.
   ``The shuttle is the most easily salable, separable asset of
Eastern Airlines,'' said Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent
Texas Air Corp.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland approved in principle
Trump's $365 million offer for the shuttle.
   Earlier, America West Airlines withdrew a higher offer for the
New York-Washington-Boston shuttle after deciding it couldn't meet
a 5 p.m. deadline set by Eastern to arrange financing for the
purchase.
   Miami-based Eastern filed for Chapter 11 protection from its
creditors on March 9, five days after its Machinists union struck.
Pilots and flight attendants have honored the walkout, forcing
Eastern to cut back its flight schedule by around 90 percent.
   The federal bankruptcy court must approve any sale of Eastern
assets.
   The shuttle was Eastern's only consistently profitable operation
before the strike.
   Eastern's unions wanted the airline sold as a single entity. But
Texas Air sought to sell the shuttle and another $1.4 billion or so
of the airline's assets separately and rebuild as a smaller carrier.
   Lorenzo said the sale of the shuttle would give momentum to his
plan to reshape Eastern. He said he believes Lifland _ who has
repeatedly urged that Eastern resume flying at full strength _ is
leaning toward approving the restructuring plan.
   ``He (Lifland) is now gradually ... realizing that nobody out
there is going to invest the hundreds of millions of dollars that
are now necessary to bring this airline up'' in its original form,
Lorenzo said.
   Under Eastern's plan, Lorenzo said, Eastern would be rebuilt as
a smaller carrier ``that is concentrated on more protected
markets'' such as Atlanta and destinations in the Northeast.
   Several potential suitors have approached Texas Air about buying
all of Eastern, but the company has not received any proposals it
considered viable.
   Lorenzo indicated Trump had an edge over America West in the
shuttle fight, partly because the Trump deal was ``certainty''
while details of the America West bid such as financing remained up
in the air up through the deadline.
   Lorenzo also called Trump the logical owner for the shuttle
because he was ``willing to pay for the franchise value.''
   ``The shuttle is a diamond,'' he said.``Anybody who's willing to
look at the Plaza Hotel and pay the price for that as a diamond, is
going to look at our Plaza Hotel, which is the shuttle.''
   Trump bought the landmark Manhattan hotel for $395 million about
a year ago.
   ``If somebody were to buy (the shuttle) just based on earnings,
you would have a hard time with $365 million,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dissident Investor Named To Board, Ending Proxy Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southmark Corp., saddled with $1.1 billion in debt
and struggling to avoid bankruptcy, reached agreement with a
dissident investor Wednesday that ended a proxy fight.
   Southmark agreed to add Herbert Parks, a Greensboro, N.C.,
developer and real estate investor, and two associates to an
expanded board of directors.
   Parks had first sought to gain control of the company from
chairman Arthur G. Weiss. He had complained that Weiss was
incapable of managing the troubled financial services company as it
tried to recover from losses suffered mainly because of Texas' real
estate depression and thrift troubles.
   Although Parks had first sought to replace Southmark's entire
seven-member board with his own nominees, he was forced to cut back
to three nominees because of federal regulations governing thrifts
owned by Southmark.
   ``Our concern from the start has been to ensure that Southmark
is managed for the best interest of all its shareholders,'' said
Parks, who owns about 4.5 percent of the Dallas-based company's
outstanding common stock.
   ``This agreement satisfies us that that will be the case,''
Parks said in a joint statement with Weiss.
   The three nominees will be seated immediately on Southmark's
board, which will be expanded from seven to 10 members. The
management team will remain unchanged.
   Parks also agreed not to seek control of the company or to
participate in a proxy battle for at least two years. In return,
Southmark agreed to reimburse the Parks Group an unspecified amount
for certain expenses.
   Southmark last month reported a $1.04 billion quarterly loss,
due mainly to an $829 million writedown of its real estate assets.
The company said the loss left the company with a negative $428
million in stockholders' equity and placed it in default on $1.1
billion worth of mainly high-yield bonds issued to build up its
portfolio.
   Bondholders could begin proceedings to force the liquidation of
the company, but so far have declined to do so. Weiss said the
company will begin meeting with bondholders June 7 to discuss the
company's restructuring.
   Southmark pays about $30 million in interest on the bonds each
quarter and so far has made all its payments, spokeswoman Susan
Seiter said. The next payment is due July 15, and Ms. Seiter said
Southmark's board has not decided whether it will be able to make
that payment.
   On Tuesday, Southmark announced an agreement in principle to
sell its 89 percent interest in Integon Corp., its largest
insurance subsidiary, for $135.5 million.
   In the past few months, the company also has sold off other
holdings for a total of $167 million, all but $7 million in cash.
