   A federal judge Wednesday temporarily
halted logging on five timber tracts that is being contested by
conservationists seeking to preserve the northern spotted owl in
western Oregon.
   U.S. District Judge Helen Frye's temporary restraining order came
in response to a motion filed Tuesday by environmental groups
fighting the federal Bureau of Land Management's plans to log mature
forests near spotted owl nests.
   Bob Rivers, acting Bureau of Land Management state director, said
its district representatives had been told to notify logging
companies to cease operations as soon as possible. A sixth tract
affected by the judge's order has not yet been awarded.
   ``The Bureau of Land Management, in reckless disregard for the
spotted owl, selected these six timber sales as a target of
opportunity to make their point through chainsaw justice,'' said
Wendell Wood of the Oregon Natural Resources Council, one of the
plaintiffs.
   Rivers would not comment on Wood's remarks.
   Meanwhile, in Seattle, nine conservation groups sued the U.S.
Forest Service Wednesday to try to stop logging on publicly owned
stands of old-growth timber that are habitat for the northern
spotted owl.
   The environmental groups contend a Forest Service plan for
spotted owls doesn't protect the species. The plan, approved in
December, said 374,000 acres of mature and old-growth timber in 13
national forests in the Pacific Northwest should be designated as
owl habitat. That is in addition to the wilderness areas and other
tracts protected from logging.
   The northern spotted owl lives in the remnants of the Pacific
Northwest's ancient old-growth forests. The Fish and Wildlife
Service is being challenged in court over its 1987 refusal to
designate the owl a threatened or endangered species.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco earlier
this month lifted an injunction it earlier imposed on cutting timber
near spotted owl nests on Bureau of Land Management land in western
Oregon. The appeals court sent the case back to Frye's court. A
request to reinstate the injunction is pending before Frye.
   On Wednesday, Frye set a Feb. 17 hearing on that motion.
   In response to the appeals court's injunction, the Bureau of Land
Management cut its projected timber harvest on the former Oregon &amp;
California Railroad lands it manages in western Oregon by about 25
percent. The BLM announced the six timber tracts after the
injunction was lifted.

<HEAD>U.S. Subway Vigilantes To Go Ahead With London Chapter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Guardian Angels say that with the backing of
the director of two Charles Bronson movies and a British businessman
they will start training recruits in London next week _ despite
official opposition.
   Curtis Sliwa, leader of the New York-based group that wants to
send civilian patrols into the London Underground, had threatened to
abandon the plan unless the crime-fighting group could find training
space.
   He said police and some government officials had ``dug their
heels in'' and refused to allow the Angels to train in public places.
   Police and lawmakers have said law enforcement on the subways
should be left to professionals, not civilians.
   After discussing the Angels' plight on a highly popular British
Broadcasting Co. television talk show, Sliwa said Wednesday that he
had received two offers of help _ from Bill Fagan, owner of a chain
of public recital halls throughout London, and from director Michael
Winner.
   Winner directed ``Death Wish'' and ``Death Wish II'', both
starring Bronson as a tough vigilante who settles the score with
cold-blooded criminals.
   Sliwa said Fagan offered the Angels the use of a hall evenings
``with no strings attached'' for a three-month training course and
Winner guaranteed that if there were any problems, he would pay for
a training facility.
   ``It gives us a mandate to continue,'' Sliwa said.
   The Guardian Angels had also received hundreds of calls from
people who offered gardens, rooms, attics and backyards for
training, Sliwa said.
   He said 60 young people, one-third of them women, had applied to
become Angels and would on Monday begin a training program in basic
self-defense, first aid, performing citizens arrests and ``human
relations.''
   ``We're going to give it a go for the three months of training,
and hopefully by early May be able to produce a Guardian Angel unit
of young men and young women from the greater London area to go down
into the Underground and give you a permanent, regular presence of
Guardian Angels,'' he said.
   Supporters of the Angels say a sharp rise in assaults and
robberies in London's subway system indicate the 2.2 million
passengers who use it every day can't be protected without deploying
many more uniformed police.
   The Guardian Angels, who turn 10 years old on Monday, became
famous for patroling New York's subways and have branched out into
60 cities in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

<HEAD>U.S. Veterans Begin Building Medical Clinic for Vietnamese</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of former U.S. soldiers, hoping
to ``deliver an olive branch of peace,'' have begun to build a
medical clinic in rural Vietnam, information received today from the
veterans said.
   Although a number of veterans groups have returned to Vietnam,
the clinic at Vung Tau in southern Vietnam is the first known
development effort by former U.S. servicemen.
   A news release from the Veterans-Vietnam Restoration Project said
a ground-breaking ceremony for the 10-room facility occurred
Saturday with veterans Ruben Gomez and Gordon Smith and Vietnamese
medical official Dr. Nguyen van Rep taking part.
   Plans call for a dozen veterans, who include carpenters,
electricians and architects, to spend about 10 weeks building the
clinic with their own hands. The cost of the project is estimated
between $60,000 and $100,000.
   At the ceremony, the veterans said they had begun ``to deliver an
olive branch of peace to the people of Vietnam.''
   ``It is hoped the group's efforts may soften the hard edge of
American policies towards Vietnam, and eventualy lead to a better
understanding and improved relationships,'' the release said.
   Gomez, a 47-year-old computer software technician from Santa
Cruz, Calif., served as a combat infantryman in Vietnam. Smith, 38,
of Monterey, Calif., saw Vietnam duty with the air force and is
currently a building contractor.

<HEAD>Scientists Criticize Newspaper Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several government and university
scientists contend a recent series of newspaper stories exaggerated
the threat to humans from selenium in food.
   Executive Editor Gregory Favre of The Sacramento Bee, which
published the series on Dec. 4-5, said the newspaper was ``confident
of the accuracy of our reporting and of our analysis.''
   The critics are led by Richard Jacobs of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration and Gerhard Schrauzer, a chemistry professor at the
University of California at San Diego, who said the Bee stories
``needlessly raised fears concerning the safety of the foods we eat
....''
   The stories, summarized in an account distributed to papers
nationwide by The Associated Press, said selenium had been found in
food from supermarkets across the nation at levels high enough to
slowly poison millions of high-risk Americans such as the very
young, the old and the chronically ill.
   Schrauzer criticized the stories for ``reporting doubtful data on
the selenium levels of common foods'' and ``grossly exaggerating the
toxicity of selenium ....''
   Selenium, a natural element in soil, is essential to life in
small concentrations but can be toxic at higher levels.
   ``Reports contending that millions of Americans are at risk of
selenium poisoning are unfounded and irresponsible,'' Schrauzer
said, ``as are the claims that the foods regularly consumed by
Americans contain unsafe levels of the element.''
   The Bee reported that illnesses ranging from stomach upsets to
death occurred in rural western residents who had been exposed to
significant amounts of selenium. The newspaper said that at least
one person, an Oregon rancher, died of the disease, while others
suffered paralysis, loss of hair, skin rashes, hypertension and
other maladies attributable to selenium.
   Favre said the newspaper believes its stories were accurate and
hopes ``that the FDA and other government agencies will not turn
their backs on a potential health hazard'' because of any dispute
over the Bee's data.
   ``The laboratories the Bee used in the testing process are
recognized by many states as among the finest labs for this type of
test. We are confident that the results they found and which we
published are accurate.''
   The Bee said it hired private laboratories to study the selenium
content in foods in ``dry weight'' form, with all moisture removed.
The newspaper then figured average daily intake by translating the
dry weights into equivalents of fresh foods as they would be
consumed.
   The scientists criticizing those articles have focused
principally on the calculations which the Bee used to translate the
dry weights into average meals, rather than on the selenium levels
found in tests conducted for the Bee.
   Bee reporter Tom Harris, who wrote the stories, defended the use
of dry-weight calculations, saying there has been a ``dramatic
evolution'' in the scientific community's opinions on which system
to use, and that the once-universal wet-weight method is giving way
to the more scientifically accurate dry-weight system.
   A major problem with wet-weight calculations, Harris said, is
that they lead to underestimation of intake.
   But Thomas Jukes, a biophysics professor at UC Berkeley, who says
he participated in the discovery that selenium was essential to
life, said the stories ``need to be scrutinized and revised based on
the actual content of selenium in foods, which they miscalculated.''
   Anna Fan, chief of the state Department of Health Services'
office of food toxicology in Berkeley, also said the Bee's
assessment of dietary selenium intake ``is not consistent with
scientific literature for the last 10 to 15 years.''
   Jacobs, supervising chemist of the federal FDA's San Francisco
office, said the Bee's conclusions were ``without scientific merit.''
   ``There is no evidence to suggest millions of people are getting
too much selenium in their diet,'' Jacobs said.
   The primary problem with the story, he said, was not the Bee's
data, but its ``misleading'' interpretation of that data.
   The story used an example of a person eating 6 ounces of dry eggs
in a meal, implying that 6 ounces would be a normal serving, Jacobs
said. But the fresh equivalent of 6 ounces is 11 extra-large eggs, a
10-fold exaggeration of what someone would consume at a typical
meal, he said.
   ``Similar reductions in calculated intakes can be made for other
foods from (the Bee) article....,'' Jacobs said.
   Harris said he based the formula for determining how much someone
would consume in dry-weight equivalents on information gathered from
several credible scientists and nutritionists, and that his data
indicates that 6 ounces dry weight would equal 2{ to 3 extra large
fresh eggs.
   However, nutritionist Joanne Ikeda of UC Berkeley, who was not
consulted by the Bee and is not among critics who have come forward,
said that 6 ounces of dry eggs are equivalent to 12 extra-large
fresh eggs.

   The Plaza Hotel was in for a jolt when four
mopheads from Liverpool settled in a 12th floor suite for a short
winter's stay in February 1964.
   They dove into room service: J&amp;B Scotch with Coca-Cola. They
binged on ``jam butties'' (butter and jelly sandwiches), corn flakes
and ice cream, and left bowls full of stubbed out ``ciggies.'' The
first morning, 37 sacks of mail arrived. And girls.
   Lots of girls.
   Screaming, screeching, silly schoolchildren who would kill their
grandmothers for a glimpse of John, Paul, George and Ringo.
   The lasses dressed as chambermaids and tried to sneak into the
suite. They posed as record company representatives. Anything. They
stormed the hotel's revolving doors only to be dumped
unceremoniously on the street with legions of their shrieking
sisters.
   It was the first magical mystery tour for The Beatles. They
landed at Kennedy Airport on Feb. 7 to make their legendary first
appearance on ``The Ed Sullivan Show'' on Feb. 9.
   For 15 days, the country became inflamed with Beatlemania, and it
would be years before the fever would die down.
   They were cocky and sure at their news conferences. At one, John
Lennon was asked how much money he expected to earn during the tour.
His response: ``About half a crown. Depends on the tax. How much
have you got?'' And to what did they owe their success? ``Good press
agent,'' John replied.
   Ringo Starr was asked what he thought of Beethoven. His reply:
``Great. 'Specially his poems.''
   It was a lark.
   No one at that moment realized the rich gift and legacy to emerge
from the four musicians. They went on to sell more than any group in
pop history. Indeed, after their appearance on ``The Ed Sullivan
Show,'' the Beatles sold 2.5 million records in the United States in
less than a month.
   Lennon is dead now, shot outside his Manhattan apartment building
on Dec. 8, 1980.
   George Harrison lives with his second wife, Olivia, and
9-year-old son, Dhani, in a fortress-like Gothic mansion with spires
and turrets at Henley-on-Thames in western England. He has lived out
of the limelight for nearly 20 years, but reemerged somewhat in 1987
to give his first full concert in 15 years in July at Wembley Arena
and to record a hit single, ``Got My Mind Set On You,'' which topped
the U.S. Cash Box music chart in January 1988.
   He also has recorded with Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison and Tom Petty in
a tongue-in-cheek group known as the Traveling Wilburys, and he is
co-owner and an executive producer of the independent British film
company, Handmade Films (``The Missionary,'' ``Life of Brian'').
   Starr spent five weeks in an American alcoholism clinic last fall
with his wife, actress Barbara Bach. They live in a secluded estate
near Ascot in southern England. He became the first Beatle
grandfather when his 20-year-old son, Zak Starkey, eldest of three
children from his first wife, Maureen, became a father on Sept. 7,
1985.
   Paul McCartney is working on an album, which includes some songs
co-written by Elvis Costello, to be released later this year. He has
too many commitments to consider the 25th anniversary, his spokesman
Bernard Doherty said. ``There have been a number of anniversaries in
recent years. There will be lots of anniversaries coming up. He's
still very busy making music.''
   McCartney said in a live radio phone-in on the BBC's Russian
Service last month that the Beatles will never be revived because
``to find a replacement for John is impossible.''
   McCartney has four children. His family lives on a fortified
forest estate in Sussex in southeast England.
   But in 1964, the Beatles had scarcely begun. Although wildly
popular on the continent, the fabulous four and their records did
not catch on in the United States until Jan. 17 when ``I Want to
Hold Your Hand'' hit No. 1 on the Cashbox chart.
   Within a year, they grossed $1.6 million in the first week's
showing of their movie, ``A Hard's Day Night,'' and Lennon's kooky
book, ``In His Own Write,'' climbed best seller lists overnight. In
rapid succession, they made six hit albums, including 1967's anthem
to the Summer of Love, ``Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band.''
   ``Sgt. Pepper'' sold 2.5 million records in its first three
months and stayed on the charts for a staggering 113 weeks. Capitol
Records estimates the album's worldwide sales at 15 million since
1967.
   This alternately melancholy, terrifying and exhilarating record
captured as no other the complex textures of its time: a
supercharged, corrosively contradictory summer when hippies grooved
at the Monterey Pop Festival, black emotions exploded in riots in
Detroit and Newark and a war grew bloodier in Vietnam. Youthful
listeners somehow heard all of this in ``Sgt. Pepper,'' an album
whose themes included Eastern culture, sweet and terrifying
psychedelic fantasies, the widening gulf between young and old and,
above all, loneliness.
   ``To me, the Beatles created an excitement about being in the
business itself,'' says songwriter and performer Christopher Cross.
``They stick out to me as the greatest thing in pop music. Paul
McCartney has always been, and remains, my biggest influence of all
time because of song structure. He and John taught me how to write
songs.''
   Cross, who won four Grammy Awards in 1981 for his song and LP,
``Sailing,'' was 12 when he saw the Beatles on ``Ed Sullivan.''

<TEXT>
   The CBS press release heralding the Beatles' first appearance in
the United States was, in retrospect low-keyed. It identified them
as ``The Beatles of London'' _ a ``wildly popular quartet of English
recording stars.'' They were billed on the show with the comedy team
of Mitzi McCall and Charlie Brill, impressionist Frank Gorshin, a
tumbling act called the four Fays and 37 members of the cast from
the Broadway musical, ``Oliver.''
   Sullivan, more animated than usual, handled the squealing
audience as a father would a hyperactive child. He gently shushed
them and made the girls promise to stay in their seats. He told the
audience Elvis Presley had sent a wire wishing the Beatles ``a
tremendous success'' in our country, introduced a commercial for
Aero Shave and then swept his arm through the air as the curtain
parted.
   There was Paul, 21, wide-eyed and boyish, feverishly working the
bass guitar and singing ``All My Loving'' at one microphone. George,
20, was on lead guitar. John, 23, on rhythm guitar, harmonized at
another microphone. Ringo, 23, sat high above them on a platform,
pounding out beats on the drums.
   Paul soloed on ``Til There Was You'' from the Broadway show,
``The Music Man.'' Later, after a magician did card tricks and
Georgia Brown sang songs from ``Oliver,'' the Beatles returned with
the Lennon-McCartney song, ``She Loves You.''
   They were fresh and school boy neat in their Edwardian jackets,
shirts and ties. Their hair, considered outrageously long at the
time, fell in agreeable bangs across their foreheads and stopped
somewhere mid-neck. The Beatle hair style eventually became as
conservative as a crewcut.
   After the Sullivan show, the Beatles played the Washington
Coliseum in Washington, D.C. On Feb. 12, they played Carnegie Hall,
where fans drowned their music in screams.
   Three years later, the Beatles began to show signs of weariness
and drifting apart. Exhausted from years of concert touring,
McCartney and Lennon had each done some independent film work;
Lennon met his future wife, Yoko Ono, in a London art gallery in
1967, around the time they recorded ``Sgt. Pepper.'' Harrison went
off to India to study sitar under Ravi Shankar. Two months after
``Sgt. Pepper'' was released, Brian Epstein, the Beatles' manager
and stabilizing influence, died. With him went much of the spirit
that had held the group together.
   In 1970, a year after the critically acclaimed ``Abbey Road'' was
released, McCartney came out with a solo LP and a self-interview
critical of the other Beatles. The LP and movie, ``Let It Be,'' came
out and by the end of the year, the group dissolved.

<TEXT>
   A bare light bulb throws rays of hope
on the faces of some of Armenia's earthquake children who now study
math and the virtues of communism inside a tent.
   For the 20 fourth graders in a green army tent that is now
Leninakan's School No. 7, school bells are ringing again.
   The corpses and the coffins are gone. So are sobbing relatives
and the rescue workers who searched for the living amid the dead. A
coal-fired furnace in the tent offers warmth.
   The children and other survivors don't need to look far for
reminders of Dec. 7, the day two months ago that the earth shook and
introduced a new lesson _ one on survival. Their former school lies
in ruins just over a hill.
   They are among tens of thousands of people who never left the
area, or have returned since the earthquake smashed northwestern
Armenia with a blow measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale.
   Of the half-million people left homeless, 100,000 women, children
and the elderly were evacuated. Those who remain are trying to cope.
   Some complain the government is not doing enough to help them get
clothes and solid roofs over their heads. Others doubt the
reconstruction will be finished in two years, as authorities
promise. Still others alleged that government officials were keeping
donated relief goods for themselves.
   Those who remain live in tents, mobile homes and the few
remaining habitable buildings. They shop for food in surprisingly
well-stocked stores and receive government benefits.
   After recovering 25,000 bodies _ 15,000 in Leninakan alone _
workers have moved on to clearing and rebuilding. The Kremlin says
the quake cost $16.1 billion.
   Broken concrete and twisted pipes have been dumped along roads
leading to Armenia's second-largest city.
   ``We Will Build Up Our Native Leninakan in Two Years,'' vows a
sign at one city entrance, placed under a bronze bust of Vladimir I.
Lenin, the founder of the Soviet state for whom the city was named.
   About 100 construction workers are building themselves temporary
dormitories in Leninakan. Martin Akopyan said his Siberian brigade
hopes to finish the dorms by the end of February, and start on homes
for the general population.
   Among those hoping for permanent quarters are Asmik Tosunyan and
three other people living in a one-room mobile home donated by West
Germany. The 6-foot-by-18-foot room has just one mattress, two
chairs and a propane stove, but no electricity or running water.
   Narina Ophsepyan, 18, was not so lucky. Since the earthquake
toppled her nine-story apartment building and killed her parents,
she has lived in an unheated tent with no water.
   ``I asked for a house but they said, `Where are we going to find
one?''' she said as she shivered on a Leninkan street.
   She and several other residents of Leninakan and Spitak, the city
closest to the epicenter, complained they have received none of the
millions of dollars' worth of clothing donated from abroad and other
Soviet republics. She accused ``the bosses'' of keeping it for
themselves, or selling it.
   Yuri I. Khodzhamiryan, a deputy premier of Armenia, said there
isn't enough clothing to go around. Asked about the charges, he
said: ``Everywhere there are bad people.''
   Officials say 6 million square yards of housing must be built,
more than 2 million in Leninakan itself. New schools and factories
also are planned.
   ``They say it will be done in two years, but God knows when they
actually will finish,'' said an angry Spitak man without a job and
home who refused to give his name.
   Vladimir I. Reshitilov, a Soviet construction minister and head
of the Leninakan branch of a government earthquake commission, said
it is ``completely realistic'' to build minimal housing and social
facilities in two years, but he acknowledged complete restoration
will take longer.
   Officials insist construction will be monitored carefully to
prevent shoddy workmanship, which officials says contributed to the
death toll. A commission is investigating why many new buildings
collapsed in the quake, while older structures were only damaged.
   New buildings will be no higher than four stories and located
away from heavy seismic areas, said Alexander G. Krivov, deputy
chairman of a committee on architecture and city building. More
detailed building codes, like those in the United States, are being
drawn and construction workers will be required to follow them
scrupulously, he said.
   Norik G. Muradyan, the Communist Party chief in Spitak, lost 11
relatives in the disaster and said officials are taking no chances
in reconstruction.
   ``We know now that quality, that's life,'' Muradyan said in his
makeshift office, a trailer donated by the British. ``Because of
that, we are obliged not only to rush, but also to inspect
everything.''
   Slipshod practices are evident, however. Along railroad tracks,
wooden building panels and plasterboards are stacked high, warping
in the weather and unprotected from rain and snow that could cause
rot.
   Authorities have determined it won't be safe to rebuild on the
site where Spitak stood, at the confluence of three quake faults.
The city, where 23,000 lived and 3,200 died in the quake, will be
rebuilt a few miles to the southwest.
   Today, the old city appears frozen in time, a museum of horror.
Hundreds of collapsed houses lie where they fell, seemingly
untouched since Dec. 7 in the shadow of beautiful, snow-covered
mountains.
   Eventually the rubble will be cleared and a park, small factories
and railroad station may be built there, officials said. But for
now, all energy is being poured into the new location, a picturesque
valley with fresh bulldozer tracks on recently cleared fields.
   A sign at a tent city for construction workers proclaims it ``our
human duty'' to rebuild Spitak.
   Muradyan takes the proclamation to heart and says his work is
good therapy.
   ``When you are left alone, there is always grief _ both in your
soul and mind _ and tears in your eyes,'' he said softly. ``But when
you are working for the sake of children and their future and for
the sake of your homeland, you must put everything aside and work
like a devotee to your people.''

<HEAD>Bush Budget Has Nod to Campaign Promises, but Defers Tough Decisions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush tonight unveils a budget plan
keyed to his campaign promises of ``kinder and gentler'' programs
without new taxes, but it leaves difficult decisions on reducing the
federal deficit for later.
   The president, in a 9 p.m. EST speech before a joint meeting of
Congress, will call for a nation more competitive abroad and more
compassionate at home.
   To those ends, he will propose more federal spending in fiscal
1990 for clean air and clean coal technology, for science and space,
for AIDS research and aid to the homeless, education and child care,
according to administration and congressional sources.
   Bush claims that those costs will be offset by about $4 billion
in new revenue from a controversial cut in the capital gains tax _
another campaign promise _ and $2 billion by holding the expansion
of the military budget to the rate of inflation.
   ``You will have a very detailed and precise descriptions of the
priorities of the Bush administration,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the
White House press secretary.
   Left deliberately unclear, however, will be how much Bush
embraces the many budget cuts he left unchanged from the first-draft
spending plan former President Reagan submitted last month.
   Bush will distance himself from any of the individual, unpopular
cuts by inviting Congress to help set each program level in
accordance with his ``flexible freeze'' plan to limit overall
spending in general categories.
   Reagan suggested terminating dozens of domestic programs and
cutting back many others in order to reduce the deficit below the
$100 billion maximum allowed by the Gramm-Rudman law.
   Bush's calculations include the total savings from those Reagan
cuts in contending that he, too, is meeting the deficit target. He
may claim a deficit as low as $90 billion by including sales of
government assets that do not count toward the Gramm-Rudman goal,
said one source who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   GOP lawmakers briefed Wednesday by Bush's budget director,
Richard Darman, said the Bush plan proposes lumping programs
together in ``boxes,'' within which some would have to be cut in
order to expand others.
   Democrats didn't wait for Bush's speech to begin criticizing his
plan to cut the capital gains tax, saying it is a tax break for the
rich and will increase the deficit, not reduce it as the president
claims.
   ``At a time when virtually every segment of our country is being
asked to sustain a sacrifice of one form or another ... it is simply
unacceptable to be considering tax breaks for the very wealthiest
segment,'' said Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee.
   Many private economists dispute Bush's claim that the rate cut
will increase government revenues by spurring business investment
and activity.
   Nonetheless, the Bush budget will claim about $4 billion in new
revenue from the plan, which would be implemented gradually and
eventually cut the rate to 15 percent for productive assets held for
two years or more. Capital gains now are taxed at either 28 percent
or 33 percent, depending on income.
   Bush, a former Texas oil man, also will propose new tax breaks
for the oil and gas industry. Additional energy production in
selected offshore areas and in the Alaska wildlife refuge _ both
opposed by environmentalists _ also are part of the plan, sources
said.
   Other Bush proposals aimed at business and trade growth will
include:
   _Restoring a research and development tax credit for business.
   _Urban enterprise zones, using special tax breaks to lure
companies to depressed areas.
   _Expanded support of research and science, including the space
station and shuttle and the proposed superconducting supercollider
physics laboratory.
   Bush will focus part of his speech and proposals on the
environment, promising more spending on the Superfund program for
toxic waste clean-ups, clean coal technology, clean water and
wetlands programs, and a greater emphasis on global environmental
problems such as the greenhouse effect.
   A few selected domestic programs in his budget would be increased
as part of his ``kinder, gentler nation'' promise. Sources said they
include:
   _Increasing the Head Start preschool education program by $250
million.
   _A merit award program for schools, and increased subsidies for
black colleges.
   _A renewed and expanded tax credit for adoption, two years after
the 1986 tax bill eliminated a deduction to offset those costs.
   _Rejection of Reagan's proposed $1.7 billion cut in the Medicaid
health program for the poor.
   _A child care tax credit of $1,000 for low-income families.
   _Full funding of the McKinney homeless assistance act.
   _$25 million to start a national program for youth in public
service.
   _Increased spending for the battle against drug abuse, although
not the full amount authorized by Congress.
   _Increased spending on AIDS research.
   The Bush budget revisions will also reflect the $1.9 billion cost
to the taxpayer next year of his program to bail out the ailing
savings and loan industry.
   He'll also embrace Reagan's plans for upgrading aviation safety,
and add $350 million to the $1.4 billion Reagan sought for clean-ups
needed at the government's nuclear plants, the sources said.
   Reagan asked Congress to increase military spending 2 percent
over inflation in fiscal 1990. Bush will propose an inflation-only
increase next year, with a 1 percent increase over inflation in 1991
and a 2 percent increase in 1993.
   Bush will revise Reagan's economic assumptions slightly to
reflect his higher projection for short-term interest rates in 1989
than the 6.3 percent projected in the Reagan budget.
   Since taking office, Bush and his budget chief Darman have been
urging Capitol Hill leaders to join in high-level budget talks to
shortcut the balky congressional budget process.
   Under regular procedures, the president's budget gets modified by
the House and Senate into a final budget resolution, which then
serves as an overall guide for legislation produced later by the
appropriations and tax-writing committees.

<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 angry Cypriot soccer fans
besieged the winning Scottish team after a World Cup qualifying
match, stoning the Scots' locker room and injuring nine people,
police said.
   Four Cypriot fans were arrested on rioting charges in the
violence that erupted after the Glasgow Rangers scored a goal to
clinch a 3-2 victory in the final 10 seconds of a see-saw game.
   A police spokesman said club-swinging riot squads broke up the
mob after fans started hurling cans and stones at the locked metal
doors of the Scottish team's locker room at Tsirion Stadium in this
southern port.
   The spokesman said the team later drove straight to Larnaca
Airport under police escort.
   Police said eight officers were injured and the East German
referee was ``slightly injured'' when he was punched by a mental
patient on parole as he followed the players off the field.
   One police car and a bus were damaged, witnesses said.
   There were no reports of injuries or arrests among an estimated
1,500 Scottish fans who flew in for the game.

<HEAD>Farmers Able to Borrow Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers are able to borrow money again, and the
Agriculture Department says it's a good sign that the battered
agricultural economy is well on its way to recovery.
   ``The large paydown in farm debt held by major farm lenders
appears to be over, and debt is expected to grow 1.5 percent to 3.5
percent in 1989,'' the department's Economic Research Service said.
``Farm loan demand strengthened in the past year and should continue
to expand in 1989.''
   Moreover, the agency said Wednesday in a report, commercial banks
that specialize in farm finance are doing well compared with the
mid-1980s. By last summer, their returns on equity were up 40
percent from 1987 and more than 150 percent above 1986.
   ``The improving farm economy will save more agricultural banks
from failure in 1989,'' the report said. ``Failures, after setting a
post-Depression record of 75 in 1987, fell to 41 in 1988, and may be
the same to sharply fewer in 1989.''
   Total bank failures, including agricultural institutions, may
``be closer to 100'' in 1989 instead of more than 200 in each of the
previous two years, the report said.
   At the height of the recent financial crunch, as plummeting land
values cut sharply into assets, thousands of farmers owed so much
that they couldn't qualify for additional credit to pay bills.
   With the lid on further credit, farmers often liquidated or
culled livestock herds, sold commodities held in storage and took
other steps to reduce debts. As this paydown took effect, banks and
other lending institutions have eased back.
   As a result, the report said ``creditworthy farmers should have
ample access to operating credit'' for spring planting and other
production expenses this year.
   ``Farm lenders are optimistic about financial conditions despite
the (1988) drought and do not think it will sidetrack the farm
recovery,'' the report said.
   Major farm lending groups reported stronger portfolios in 1988
and fewer farm loan delinquencies, loan charge-offs and
foreclosures, it said. An exception was the department's Farmers
Home Administration, which makes loans to the least creditworthy
producers, but ``indications are that it too is coming to grips''
with its problems, the report said.
   A major reason for the favorable farm financial outlook this year
was said to be the continued strength in crop and livestock
commodity sales.
   ``Better economic fundamentals also underlie long-run trends in
agriculture,'' the report said. ``Farmland markets have improved and
the farm sector balance sheet (of assets and liabilities) has
stabilized.''

   Farm and ranch inventories of cattle and calves
edged down again to a 28-year low of 99,484,000 head on Jan. 1 from
99,524,000 a year ago, according to new Agriculture Department
estimates.
   But the decline has slowed and there were indications many beef
producers have started rebuilding their herds. A year ago, the U.S.
cattle herd was down 2.4 percent from the 102 million head that had
been estimated Jan. 1, 1987. This year's decline was less than 1
percent.
   ``This slowed the recent downtrend in cattle inventories that
began six years ago and was the second consecutive inventory below
100 million head since 1961,'' the department's Agricultural
Statistics Board said Wednesday.
   The estimate was in line with recent predictions of USDA
analysts, who say the shrinkage in the overall cattle herd may be
starting to rebound. As producers hold back breeding stock to
rebuild herds, beef output is expected to decline in the short run.
   Overall, according to USDA forecasts, 1989 beef production may
decline 5 percent to 7 percent from last year to the lowest level
since 1980.
   But large supplies of pork and poultry are expected and that
could leave this year's total meat output at only slightly below the
record level of 1988. Even so, retail beef prices are expected to
set records this year.
   As of Jan. 1, the number of beef cows and heifers that have
calved totaled 43.9 million head, up 1 percent from a year ago, the
first increase following six consecutive years of decline.
   Beef cows were reported at 33.7 milion head, up 2 percent from
Jan. 1, 1988, and dairy cows at 10.2 million head, down 1 percent.
It was the smallest inventory of U.S. milk cows since 1872, the
report said.
   The 1988 calf crop was estimated at almost 40.9 million head, up
2 percent from 1987.
   Analysts said the value of all cattle and calves as of Jan. 1 was
estimated at about $60.4 billion, up 16 percent from $52 billion a
year earlier. The average value was reported at $607 per head,
compared with $523 the previous year.

   An annual inventory report by the Agriculture
Department shows that the nation's flock of sheep and lambs
increased slightly in 1988 for the third consecutive year.
   
   The increase was only a small fraction of 1 percent, however,
boosting the U.S. flock to an estimated 10,802,000 sheep and lambs
on Jan. 1 from 10,784,000 on Jan. 1, 1988.
   Despite the recent gains, the Jan. 1 count was one of the
smallest in U.S. history, according to USDA records going back for
more than a century.
   In 1970, for example, there were 20.4 million sheep and lambs in
the nation's flocks. And in 1867, when USDA began counting sheep,
there were about 46.3 million head. The industry peaked in 1942 at
56.2 million.
   ``Primarily the decline stems from less demand for wool as more
synthetics and cheaper substitute materials were introduced and the
declining demand for lamb in consumer diets,'' the report said.

   Janet Mondlane, educated in a one-room
schoolhouse near Downers Grove, Ill., was 17 and dreaming of
becoming a doctor in Africa when she met an African revolutionary at
a summer church camp.
   He changed her life.
   It was 1951, and Eduardo Mondlane, who became the founder and
first president of the Mozambican Liberation Front, was 31 and
lecturing at church camps as part of his scholarship to Oberlin
College in Ohio.
   ``I am a product of Eduardo Mondlane,'' says his widow, 55, who
heads the Red Cross in Mozambique, still wracked by war and famine
14 years after independence from Portugal and 20 years after her
husband's assassination.
   ``I grew up in this little town near Chicago. Until I was 7 I
lived out in the country,'' the former Janet Rae Johnson recalled in
an interview. ``Life was calm, very stable, not many ideas were
passing through.''
   She said, ``Eduardo was able to write on a blank sheet and he
wrote on it until the time he died.''
   On Feb. 3, 1969, Mondlane was killed by a parcel bomb at his
office in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, where the revolutionary movement
_ known by its Portuguese acronym, Frelimo _ was headquartered
during the war against the Portuguese.
   ``During the whole long struggle every now and then you had to
pick up the children and leave the house in the middle of the night
because word came that someone was coming to attack,'' Mrs. Mondlane
said.
   ``I'm not at all a violent person. As a matter of fact I'm rather
a pacifist. But my life has been very much linked with war,
unfortunately.''
   Her work as head of the Mozambican Red Cross involves providing
emergency aid for millions of refugees displaced by fighting between
the Frelimo government, which took power in 1975 under a Marxist
constitution, and guerrillas of the Mozambican National Resistance,
supported for many years by the white-minority governments of South
Africa and what then was Rhodesia.
   Mrs. Mondlane said she is not a Marxist but is a member of the
Frelimo Party and a deputy in the People's Assembly, the national
legislature.
   Today's Mozambique is not what she had expected, she said.
   ``I never counted on so much war, that's for sure. We thought
that it would be possible to develop the country. It hasn't been.''
   A major decision of her life was relinquishing her American
citizenship.
   ``The rest of my family is in the States. It's a question of do
you break these ties or don't you, really throw in the lot or not?
   ``I decided yes, this is really my country. I really dedicated my
life to this country since I met Eduardo, and that's a long time ago.
   ``I went to the church camp in (Lake) Geneva, Wis., and there was
Eduardo. We students were supposed to go to a different lecture
every day. I went to the lecture Monday on Africa and stayed there.
I was just mesmerized.''
   She and Mondlane exchanged letters for the next 18 months. After
high school graduation she went to Marianhill College in Ohio to be
near him, then they both transferred to Northwestern University in
Evanston, Ill.
   ``Blacks and whites didn't get married then,'' she said. ``The
process took five years, trying to work through things with my
family. There was a lot of hullabaloo from his missionary friends
about marrying instead of going to the Congo.''
   Mondlane went to work for the United Nations and didn't return to
Africa until 1961.
   After nine months as a professor at Syracuse University in New
York, Mondlane went to Tanzania, where three Mozambican exile groups
united in 1962 under his leadership and began the guerrilla war.
   After her husband's death, Mrs. Mondlane helped fund schools and
medical posts in the northern provinces that Frelimo controlled
until independence came in 1975.
   ``What I'd like to do is go and work on my farm (in the
countryside) but here I am still working here, doing the same thing
I was doing all my life,'' said Mrs. Mondlane.

<TEXT>
   Soon after Gen. Alfredo Stroessner was
ousted in a coup, residents of the working class neighborhood
``Barrio Stroessner'' strung some rope around the neck of a statue
of the dictator and pulled it down.
   Stroessner's cult of personality, which in 34 years saw a city,
international airport and even a popular polka named after him, is
crumbling as Paraguayans try to erase remnants of the man who was
ousted Friday by Gen. Andres Rodriguez.
   At President Stroessner International Airport, an employee using
a spatula and bucket of warm water worked to remove the ubiquitous
posters of the one-time president and ``Only Leader,'' as he often
was described.
   Gone, too, is the large flashing neon sign that for years at
night blinked out in red letters the message ``Stroessner: Peace,
Work and Well-Being'' from atop the Bank of Industrial Development
next to a downtown park.
   Government employees still slip and refer to ``President
Stroessner'' instead of ``President Rodriguez,'' but the
ever-present photos of the stocky, shrewd ex-army commander-in-chief
have disappeared from their offices.
   The newspaper Ultima Hora offered a tongue-in-cheek sale of
``framed pictures and paintings in various sizes, poses and
expressions of a known ex-military president.''
   ``The offer is limited and will not be repeated,'' the phony ad
said.
   The Roman Catholic Church-run Radio Caritas held a poll to
determine what new name to use for the airport, the neighborhood
``Barrio Stroessner'' and the city Presidente Stroessner, located
about 200 miles east of the capital across the Parana River from
Brazil.
   One caller suggested the airport be dubbed ``Freedom Airport'';
another, ``February 3rd Airport'' to mark the day of the coup.
Others suggested ``Barrio Stroessner'' become ``Barrio John Paul
II'' to commemorate the pope's visit to Paraguay in May.
   Government officials are reluctant to criticize the Stroessner
years too harshly, telling reporters they prefer to look to the
future. Rodriguez himself set the tone Monday by saying his former
boss and friend ``was not a dictator.''
   ``The Stroessner government had different stages and within those
stages there were 32 or 33 years of a great government,'' says new
Foreign Minister Luis Maria Argana.
   The public reaction is more varied and harder to gauge, but as
opposition leader Domingo Laino notes acerbicly, few in the army
stood by Stroessner in his moment of need, no one rallied to his
side while he remained a prisoner in Paraguay, and the majority of
people who saw him off at the airport were there to jeer.
   ``There's no doubt about it, the majority of the people are
euphorically enchanted,'' said the Rev. Eugene Connolly, who came
from Brooklyn, N.Y., 19 years ago to serve in Colonel Oviedo, a city
80 miles east of Asuncion. ``It will take a couple of weeks until
they are over this.''
   That view is not unanimous. A parking lot attendant said: ``He
was a good man. We'll have to wait to see what comes next.''
   But interviews with Paraguayans like Hilaria Sandoval indicated
why the end of a 34-year authoritarian was almost an anticlimax.
   ``Now you can talk and nobody will arrest you,'' said Ms.
Sandoval, a vegetable vendor who carries carrots, onions and spinach
door-to-door on her head.
   ``I think Gen. Rodriguez's coup was a magnificent act,'' she
said. ``I would like to vote for the general for president in the
next elections.''

<HEAD>Jerry Brown Back in Political Spotlight</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To the delight of Republicans and
discomfort of some Democrats, Jerry Brown is back in the political
spotlight, campaigning for the once-obscure post of chair of the
California Democratic Party.
   The political comeback of the former governor and two-time
presidential candidate follows six years of self-imposed political
exile _ part of it spent in seclusion writing in Mexico and Japan
and part working in Mother Teresa's hospital in Calcutta and on a
CARE hunger project in Bangladesh.
   Brown's latest campaign will conclude with voting Saturday among
the 2,800 delegates credentialed for the California Democratic
Party's annual convention. Another liberal Brown, Ronald H. Brown,
is expected to be named chairman of the national Democratic Party on
Friday.
   Brown, 50, once dubbed ``Gov. Moonbeam'' by his critics, has
lined up endorsements from an impressive array of party leaders and
is regarded as the favorite over investment banker Steve Westly, 32,
of Menlo Park. Westly is the current vice chair of the party and
traditionally would be unopposed for chairman.
   Brown's critics note that as governor from 1975 through 1983, he
shunned the party, and they contend he would use the chair's office
not to serve the party but as a stepping stone to advance his own
political career.
   They also say one of his weaknesses as governor was neglect of
the sort of administrative detail that is a major part of the state
chair's job, and that Brown's election would give new life to what
have become stale Republican attacks against controversial aspects
of Brown's governorship, from Medflies to his appointment of Rose
Bird as chief justice. Ms. Bird was recalled by voters in 1986,
largely because of her opposition to the death penalty.
   Brown acknowledges and dismisses such criticism, saying that the
18 primary and general election campaigns he has conducted over the
past two decades give him the experience, contacts and fund-raising
ability to revitalize the party.
   ``I think that issue of negative baggage is overstated. People
don't replay history forever,'' Brown says, making jokes
exaggerating his past political problems.
   ``I guess I feel a little bit like Typhoid Mary,'' he joked in
one interview shortly after announcing his candidacy late last year.
``I walk in and people want to step back a little. Ohhhhh boy, it's
going to be Hayden and Bird, Willie Brown, death penalty, Cesar
Chavez, Farm Workers, Whewww!''
   But Brown's image is not a joke to some Democrats.
   ``He has too much baggage to help the party recoup,'' says
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos of San Jose, a Democrat generally
supportive of Brown during his governorship.
   And Assemblyman Richard Katz, a San Fernando Valley Democrat who
has formed an exploratory committee for a race for lieutenant
governor in 1990, doesn't want Brown to become a fresh campaign
issue.
   ``I don't see any evidence that he's changed. What has Jerry
Brown done in the last six years to show he's in touch with the
people of California? He seems to think he has to go to Calcutta to
see people in need,'' Katz says.
   Brown says his goals will be to rebuild what he describes as a
decaying Democratic Party, particularly in fund-raising, and he says
that goal, not his own career, will be his focus as chairman.
   But if he succeeds in strengthening the Democratic Party, the
people now criticizing his bid will want him to run for office, but
he adamently declines to specify any future office.
   Brown has gone out of his way in his comeback bid to admit past
mistakes. In a long introspective article he wrote for The
Sacramento Bee the week before formally announcing his campaign for
chair, he specifically addressed his rocky relationship with the
party he now wants to lead.
   ``One thing I did not do (as governor) is build a strong
Democratic Party or even an enduring political organization. I knew
where I was going, but too often I was going there by myself,''
Brown wrote. ``I had become so immersed in campaigning and running
that I neglected the people around me.''
   Brown acknowledges that his bid for the unpaid post of party
chairman is his bid to re-enter politics, but he denies that his
re-entry will be at the expense of the party. And he pledges to
serve the full four-year term, which presumably would take him out
of 1992 Senate or presidential races.
   ``I'm back, back to build the party, and back to stay,'' Brown
told convention delegates in Red Bluff last week.

   As thousands of American teen-agers
struggle with the complexities of basic algebra, a 17-year-old
English girl is being wooed by Harvard and several other
universities to lecture and continue her mathematical research on
such subjects as quantum groups and statistical mechanics.
   Ruth J. Lawrence, of Oxford, England, is manipulating some of the
most complex concepts in mathematics. Her work has taken her to the
outer fringes of theoretical physics and mathematics, such subjects
as knot and string theory, and the connections between the world of
particle physics and mathematics.
   She entered Oxford University six years ago and by age 13 had her
degree. Today she is working on her doctorate and has long since
caught the attention of the world's top mathematicians.
   Lawrence has already taught students at Oxford on a tutorial
basis. If she accepts a position at an American university it will
be mainly to conduct research. But she said she might lead a seminar
or deliver an occasional lecture. In addition to Harvard and
Berkeley, Princeton's Institute for Advance Study is interested in
bringing Lawrence in for a year.
   It all began not in some exclusive British school but in
Lawrence's own home in Oxford, where her father, Harry, a computer
consultant, gave Ruth her entire pre-Oxford education.
   ``I was always dealing with adults so when I got to Oxford I
fitted into the atmosphere. ... He didn't use any textbooks. He
taught me totally himself,'' she said Wednesday while visiting
Harvard with her father.
   Lawrence got top scores on her Oxford entrance exam. It was at
that point, her father said, ``it was obvious to me that she was a
little better than most.''
   Once at Oxford, Lawrence studied under Sir Michael Atiyah, Royal
Society Research Professor at Oxford and ``one of the great
mathematicians of the world,'' according to John Addison, chairman
of the mathematics department at the University of California at
Berkeley, one of the schools recruiting Lawrence.
   Lawrence seems to have taken her rapid rise in stride. She is
much more interested in talking about the vast unknown in the world
of mathematics than dwelling on her accomplishments.
   ``When I was taught mathematics in the beginning I was interested
in it. I just liked it. I didn't think it was anything special,''
Lawrence said.
   Now, Lawrence says, ``The age thing really does not matter for
more than the first two seconds. ... I talk to mathematicians as
mathematicians and I think they talk to me in the same way.''
   Addison, Berkeley's math chairman, has been tracking Lawrence's
career for the past seven years. ``Word was certainly getting around
in the mathematical field that there was this very unusual
prodigy,'' Addison said.
   Lawrence just spent four weeks in California attending a
prestigious mathematics conference at the Mathematical Science
Research Institute, also in Berkeley. The discussion among
scientists and mathematicians from around the world focused on the
relationship between physics and mathematics, Lawrence's area of
concentration.
   Addison interviewed Lawrence for a possible research position at
Berkeley and found her ``a very nice person. Sometimes prodigies end
up being kind of strange or egotistic. I didn't sense that.''
   Harry Lawrence said he taught his daughter at home so she could
reach her highest potential. He is using the same method in teaching
his other daughter, Rebecca, 15, who is something of a piano
prodigy, with one British Broadcasting Corp. concert under her belt.
   To the inevitable question of whether Ruth feels she has missed
out on childhood she answers unequivocally: ``I've had a very
enjoyable childhood. I've had so many opportunities I wouldn't have
had if I'd gone the ordinary route.''

   Gary Coleman, who starred in the
television series ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' is suing his parents and
former business adviser, alleging they took too big a share of his
earnings.
   The lawsuit filed Tuesday in Santa Monica Superior Court also
claims that W.G. and Edmonia Sue Coleman and the adviser, Anita
DeThomas, caused his assets to be managed unwisely. It said Coleman
believes his parents were unduly influenced by Ms. DeThomas.
   His lawsuit did not specify what compensation he was seeking but
stated that Ms. DeThomas got more than the 5 percent she was
entitled to and his parents more than the 20 percent they should
have received as his personal managers.
   The defendants could not be reached for comment because there
were no telephone listings for them in the Los Angeles area.
   Coleman, who turned 21 Wednesday, started acting when he was 5
years old and portrayed lead character Arnold Jackson on ``Diff'rent
Strokes,'' a series designed for him in 1978. He also appeared in
the movies ``The Kid from Left Field,'' ``On the Right Track'' and
``Playing With Fire.''
   On Monday, Coleman's ``Diff'rent Strokes'' 23-year-old co-star,
Todd Bridges, pleaded innocent to attempted murder for a Feb. 2
shooting that police described as a drug-related assault.

Union four years earlier in search of ``artistic liberty.''
Vishnevskaya, a former singer with the Bolshoi Opera, also was

<HEAD>Lawmakers Want Ban On Tennessee Liquor In North Carolina</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An environmental dispute between North
Carolina and Tennessee took a new twist when two legislators here
decided to ``fight fire with firewater'' by proposing a ban on
Tennessee liquor.
   State Sen. Dennis Winner said he wanted to let Tennessee leaders
know that their decision to stop a North Carolina company from
dumping wastewater into the Pigeon River would have economic
ramifications in both states.
   ``I'm not trying to knock them to their knees,'' Winner said.
``The basic problem is they don't think they have anything to lose.''
   Winner and state Sen. Bob Swain introduced a bill Wednesday that
would ban the sale in North Carolina of any liquor manufactured in
Tennessee or purchased from a Tennessee vendor.
   ``There's no revenge involved,'' said Swain, tongue in cheek. ``I
just think ol' Tennessee liquor is bad for people.''
   The bill is the latest salvo in an increasingly bitter feud
between the states over Tennessee's refusal to grant Champion
International Co. a permit to discharge wastewater into the Pigeon
River at its Canton paper mill.
   The Pigeon flows from North Carolina into Tennessee, skirting the
northeastern border of Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
   In response to concerns by residents of Cocke County, Tenn.,
officials in Tennessee announced Dec. 23 they would not grant a
variance allowing the North Carolina plant to continue dumping into
the river.
   A Champion official announced this week that operations at the
mill would be scaled back as a result of Tennessee's decision,
threatening the jobs of 1,000 people.
   Nonetheless, a spokesman for Tennessee Gov. Ned McWherter said
the decision not to grant the variance is final.
   ``What North Carolina does, I guess, is North Carolina's
businesss,'' said Ken Renner, the spokesman. ``About the only
similarity between Tennessee whiskey and Pigeon River water is
they're about the same color.''
   The liquor bill quickly inspired jokes and puns in the halls of
North Carolina's Legislative Building, including talk of ``fighting
fire with firewater.''
   A spokesman for the North Carolina Alcoholic Beverage Control
Commission estimated that more than 1 million bottles of Tennessee
whiskey are sold in the state each year.
   Winner said he chose to target Tennessee liquor to avoid
conflicting with the U.S. Constitution's provision forbidding states
from restricting interstate commerce.
   The courts have ruled that the 21st Amendment allows states to
regulate liquor traffic within their borders and that it supersedes
the interstate commerce clause, he said.
   A spokesman for the Jack Daniels distillery in Lynchburg, Tenn.,
said he was only vaguely familiar with the Champion controversy, but
the proposed liquor ban was troubling.
   ``We're not too happy, I don't guess,'' said spokesman Roger
Brashears. ``It don't make us too pleased.''

   An anti-terrorist program is protecting the
nation's electric power suppliers even though planners doubt a
coordinated attack ever will be launched against the energy network,
an industry official says.
   The program is about six months old and involves an ``ongoing
working relationship'' with the FBI, Michehl Gent, president of the
North American Electric Reliability Council, told a Senate hearing
on Wednesday.
   He said the program, which was 2{ years in the making, was
adopted even though ``skepticism was rampant'' among its creators
that terrorists would carry out a multi-site attack on U.S. energy
supplies.
   Natural events such as hurricanes present a greater threat to
U.S. power systems, said Gent, whose organization represents
virtually all U.S. and Canadian suppliers of electricity.
   The Department of Energy has been advising U.S. companies
privately of a growing threat of ``techno-terrorism'' attacks on
vital domestic energy facilities and it is pressing them to fortify
their defenses.
   Gent said his group had agreed with DOE and National Security
Council officials not to talk about the program because of fear of
tipping off terrorists. He said his testimony before the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee ``is the first, and I hope the last,
public utterance of our program.''
   He said he would be willing to discuss specifics of the program
in a closed committee session, which Committee Chairman John Glenn,
D-Ohio, said could be done.
   Glenn said oil and natural gas pipeline representatives had
declined to appear before the panel out of fear that sensitive
security information would be revealed.
   The committee concluded two days of hearings on the vulnerability
of U.S. telecommunications and energy resources to terrorism. In
testimony Tuesday, the committee was told the increasing
sophistication of U.S. telecommunications systems and their
concentration at fewer sites made them more vulnerable to terrorist
attack.
   The committee also was told the federal government was
ill-prepared to deal with a terrorist assault on private
communications.
   A DOE official Wednesday said that in the past two years his
department ``has taken decisive steps to substantially strengthen
and reorganize the nation's ability to respond to non-nuclear energy
emergencies.''
   Those steps include an Energy Emergency Management System within
DOE and an Interagency Group on Energy Vulnerability, said Edward V.
Badolato, DOE's deputy assistant secretary for energy emergencies.
   ``We filled a vacuum,'' Badolato said, adding that he wanted to
ensure that ``we'd never have to go before this body or the American
people and say that we had information, even general information,
that something was being perpetrated by enemies of the United States
on our energy infrastructure and we stood idly by and didn't do
anything about it.''
   He said DOE, like the State Department, put out ``several''
advisories in 1987 that there were foreign terrorist threats that
could involve the United States. He did not elaborate.
   ``I take the threat seriously, the potential threat seriously.,''
Badolato said. ``Since 1980 there have been approximately 8,000
attacks against energy systems around the world. We've been lucky in
the United States. But the individuals who do this are only a plane
ride away.''
   Another witness, Robert K. Mullen, said there had been 283
documented cases of sabotage against American energy systems since
1980.
   But Mullen, a terrorism expert, said he saw no evidence of an
increasing terrorist threat in the United States and that most
previous acts of sabotage had been incidents such as shooting at
power lines or arson against gasoline station owners or operators.

<HEAD>Bush's Rescue Plan Juggles Numbers for Sake of Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is sending Congress a 30-year,
$200 billion plan to rescue the savings and loan industry that is
carefully crafted to avoid inflating the federal budget deficit next
year.
   The proposal, submitted as part of the 1990 budget, spreads the
costs over 30 years and shifts some of the budget outlays into the
current 1989 fiscal year.
   As a result, Bush is making it easer to keep his ``no new taxes''
pledge in the first year of his presidency by including an immediate
$200 million savings in 1990.
   The president would spend only $1.9 billion in tax dollars in
1990 on the biggest government bailout ever, compared with $2.1
billion proposed by the outgoing Reagan administration. Reagan
called for outlays of $18.5 billion in fiscal years 1990 through
1993, $3.1 billion more than Bush would spend in his first four
budgets.
   But Bush would increase spending this year to $11.1 billion, up
from $8.7 billion in the Reagan budget.
   ``That is the accounting sleight of hand that is in the Bush
plan,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House
Banking Committee. ``It's not that taxpayers are going to be paying
any less, but that it shows up less on the budget.''
   Treasury Department officials who devised the Bush plan declined
several requests for interviews Tuesday and Wednesday.
   The president's plan is complex. Tax revenue and increased
deposit insurance premiums paid by banks and thrifts would be used
to make good on $40 billion in assistance pledged by S&amp;L regulators
last year and to pay off $50 billion in additional money borrowed
through 30-year bonds sold over the next three years.
   The Office of Management and Budget, a White House agency, this
week released financing details showing $126 billion in spending
from 1989 through 1999. According to the figures, the government
would continue to spend $3.8 billion a year after that in interest
on the bonds, bringing total spending to more than $200 billion over
30 years.
   The administration had said that solving the S&amp;L problem would
cost $90 billion, but that amount did not account for the interest
charges.
   Budget Director Richard Darman said the public would shoulder $40
billion of the cost over the first decade and 54 percent, or more
than $100 billion, of the burden over 30 years.
   In the first decade, an additional $20 billion would be raised as
an increase in the deposit insurance premiums paid by banks. The
money would stay in the bank fund, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., but would count as revenue in the general budget and allow
the government to spend that amount in tax dollars without adding to
the budget deficit.
   Private analysts make two criticisms of the president's proposal
_ that it doesn't provide enough money and that it's based on overly
optimistic interest rate assumptions.
   ``I don't think there is enough money in this plan, but I think
it is a very good and substantial down payment,'' said Robert Litan,
a banking expert with the Brookings Institution. ``I can understand
why they don't want to acknowledge that now, but this is too
little.''
   Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.,
said Bush is assuming he can sell the 30-year bonds at an interest
rate of 7.6 percent, nearly 1.5 percentage points lower than the
current market.
   ``Of course it's a rosy scenario,'' Ely said.

   A train crew member was crushed to death
and three others were injured when a 28-car freight train carrying
automobiles and trucks derailed near a stockyard, authorities said.
   Sixteen of the rail cars left the track Wednesday near the West
Fargo Stockyards, said Al Morin, a spokesman for Burlington Northern
Railroad.
   What caused the derailment was under investigation.
   The names of the victims, identified as members of the train's
crew, were withheld pending notification of relatives, the Cass
County sheriff's department said.
   Witnesses said the dead crew member was crushed in the accident.
   The injured were taken to St. Luke's Hospitals-MeritCare in
Fargo. None was in critical condition, said Kathy Borge, a hospital
spokeswoman.
   Morin said night crews worked to clear and repair one of the two
side-by-side tracks where the train derailed so that rail traffic
could resume this morning.
   The train, originating in Dilworth, Minn., and bound for the
Pacific Northwest, had 12 cars carrying automobiles and one loaded
with trucks, Morin said.
   The National Transportation Safety Board was called in to
investigate the accident, he said.

   The Food and Drug Administration will hold a
public hearing to more closely examine the controversial issue of
AIDS antibody testing kits which could be used in the home.
   The FDA has been concerned about the accuracy of such tests and
whether adequate counseling can be incorporated into a home-testing
system for the fatal disease.
   ``The whole Public Health Service is very much concerned that you
have a system that gives adequate results and that the results can
be explained to people,'' said Paul Parkman, director of the FDA
office that regulates the materials used in the test kits.
   The FDA last April turned back requests by manufacturers who
wanted to market an AIDS test kit, and the agency said research on
such kits would have to be done in hospitals, clinics and other
traditional health care settings.

<NOTE>SEC Proposes to Crack Down on High-Pressure Phone Tactics</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is
seeking new regulations that would crack down on stockbrokers who
use high-pressure telephone tactics to sell penny stocks.
   The SEC rule, proposed by a 5-0 vote on Wednesday, would not
entirely ban unsolicited ``cold calls,'' but would require brokerage
firms to sign a written agreement with a new customer before
completing a transaction.
   Brokers would also have to interview new customers to determine
if they were suitable for risky investments and keep the suitability
documents on file for inspection by regulators.
   The stocks typically sell for less than $3 a share. Some are
issued by legitimate companies, but many are sold by companies with
an erratic earnings history.

<NOTE>Manufactured-Home Producer Settles Federal Suit for $945,000</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest producer of manufactured
homes has agreed to pay $945,000 to settle a federal suit charging
it failed to meet federal construction and safety standards in
building some 20,000 homes.
   The agreement with Fleetwood Enterprises Inc. settles a suit
filed by the government last year alleging that the manufactured
homes Fleetwood built in 1983 and 1984 failed to meet such
standards, the Department of Housing and Urban Development said
Wednesday.
   Glenn Kummer, president of Fleetwood Enterprises in Riverside,
Calif., said that in making the payment the company ``hasn't
admitted that the homes violated any standards.''

   Vice President Salvador Laurel's visit
to Ferdinand Marcos' bedside in Hawaii is widely seen as a bid to
revive his dying political fortunes and angle for right-wing support
as he seeks the presidency.
   On Saturday, Laurel returned from Honolulu carrying what he said
were secret messages from the ailing Marcos for President Corazon
Aquino.
   Laurel appealed to Mrs. Aquino's ``Christian values'' to allow
the ex-president to come home to die. But Mrs. Aquino refused to see
Laurel, reflecting the low esteem in which she holds the vice
president.
   Furthermore, many political commentators accused Laurel of
``grandstanding'' in the sensitive national question of whether to
allow the 71-year-old Marcos to return from exile in Hawaii.
   ``The nakedness of Laurel's ambitions leaves little room for
respect,'' wrote The Manila Chronicle. ``It has become clear that
the man is so obsessed with winning power that he would grab at
straws to support his bid.''
   Laurel has so little influence with Mrs. Aquino that it seemed
virtually impossible that he would be able to persuade her to relent
and allow Marcos to return home.
   The government says Marcos and his associates embezzled up to $10
billion during his 20-year rule and Mrs. Aquino has refused to
discuss his return until he gives back the money.
   Several congressmen and political commentators believe Laurel
intended through the trip to ingratiate himself with Marcos'
followers, especially those in northern Luzon island, and use them
as a base of support in the 1992 presidential campaign.
   Inheriting the Marcos mantle would enable Laurel to outflank
other potential center-right candidates, such as Sen. Juan Ponce
Enrile, who might appeal to those who would not support Mrs. Aquino
or anyone seen as her favored candidate.
   Mrs. Aquino has said she will not seek re-election.
   ``With the demise of Marcos, the so-called `solid north' is in
need of someone to rally around,'' said Rep. Florencio Abad.
   The 60-year-old Laurel would seem an ideal ``reconciliation
candidate'' to bring together a nation still deeply divided three
years after Marcos was ousted in a popular uprising.
   Laurel announced he would run for president against Marcos in
1985, but stepped aside under pressure to become Mrs. Aquino's
running mate.
   A member of an elite political clan, Laurel maintains links to
the business community and the military.
   But a series of political blunders has reinforced his deeply
entrenched public image as an opportunist.
   After a bloody August 1987 coup attempt, Laurel traveled to
military bases, ostensibly to investigate soldiers' complaints.
   Before the television cameras, he would shout, ``Do you want
Communists out of government?'' That brought cheers from the troops
but contempt from more liberal-minded urban voters, who joked that
Laurel was becoming a ``Filipino McCarthy.''
   In September 1987, he resigned as foreign secretary, citing
widespread differences with Mrs. Aquino on the 20-year-old Communist
insurgency and other issues. A year later, he demanded she resign
and call new elections, but she refused.
   Instead of winning sympathy by his moves, Laurel's popularity
plunged. Manila newspapers and television stations rarely report his
activities and his speeches draw only modest audiences.
   Despite Laurel's personal campaigning, his nephew, Benjamin
Laurel, was defeated in the January 1988 race for governor of
Batangas province, the Laurel family stronghold.
   Since formally breaking with the administration in August,
Laurel's attempt to organize a broad-based opposition movement have
faltered.
   He complained last year to foreign reporters that he was
virtually ignored by the media. His principal public forum in the
capital has been occasional interviews by Tagalog-language radio
stations.
   ``It would be a gross understatement to say that Doy has an image
problem,'' wrote columnist Ed Olaguer, referring to Laurel by his
nickname.

   A ``giant pressure cooker'' at an aerospace
plant blasted off like a rocket through the ceiling Wednesday night
and crashed in a parking lot, killing one person, police said.
   Three others working in the Kaiser Space Products building
escaped without injuries, authorities said.
   Robert Renkemeyer, was standing near a steam-driven pressure
kettle used for curing aerospace parts when it exploded and ``the
lid blew off,'' killing the 66-year-old consultant from Pensacola,
Fla., said Kaiser President Bill Sidney.
   ``It's impossible to know how the pressure vessel blew up,''
Sidney said.
   The 14,000-poundlid blasted through the roof and landed in a
parking lot 50 or 60 feet away, said Fire Department spokesman
Charlie Stimmel. The west and south walls of the building also were
blown out.
   ``The pressure vessel had 1,000 pounds per square inch of
pressure and was being fed 310-degree steam when it blew. Right now
we're thinking it was some type of pressure buildup,'' Stimmel said.
   Earlier, Police Sgt. Robert Williams said the object launched
through the roof was a rocket nose cone.
   The plant supplies rocket nozzles to NASA, the Air Force and
private satellite operations.

<HEAD>Husband Begs Court To Allow Abortion For Comatose Wife</HEAD>

   The husband of a comatose woman begged an appeals
court to let him end his wife's pregnancy to save her life, and said
in an interview that anti-abortionists who oppose him are ``ripping
my guts out.''
   ``I implore this court not to permit these two strangers to delay
my decision,'' Martin Klein said in an affidavit submitted to a
state appeals court Wednesday.
   Klein, a 34-year-old accountant from the Long Island suburb of
Upper Brookville, wants to be named guardian of his wife, Nancy, so
he can authorize an abortion that several doctors said could aid in
her recovery.
   But anti-abortion activists John Short and John Broderick have
sought to block him, saying that aborting the fetus will not improve
Mrs. Klein's chances and will harm her psychologically. They have
applied to become her guardian to prevent the abortion.
   Klein was awarded the guardianship Tuesday in a state trial
court, but the decision was stayed pending an appeal by Short and
Broderick.
   At the appellate hearing, Klein's attorney, Sidney Schutz, called
Short and Broderick ``intruders, strangers'' with no right to decide
Mrs. Klein's fate.
   But Mary Spaulding, Short's attorney, countered that it was a
conflict of interest for Klein to be named guardian. She said the
abortion would violate his wife's wishes.
   Mrs. Klein ``had planned this pregnancy, she was looking forward
to this pregnancy and was happy about it,'' Ms. Short said. ``The
issue is not the right to an abortion, but the right to procreate
and have children.''
   In his affidavit, Klein said: ``For nine years, my wife and I
have lived a happy and devoted life together. I know her wishes and
priorities, including her own survival and recovery in view of the
welfare of our 3-year-old daughter.''
   The five-judge appeals panel is due to make its decision by the
end of the week. Short, founder of the Long Island Right-to-Life
group, pledged to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court if the
panel ruled against him.
   ``At least the fetus is one day older,'' Short said. ``If we keep
it going, she will be a newborn, alive child. If Nancy Klein dies
and the baby lives, she will have an extension of herself in the
baby.''
   In an interview with The Associated Press before the hearing,
Klein referred to Short and Broderick when he said: ``I just want to
get this issue behind us. They're ripping my guts out.''
   ``Everyone has a right to their beliefs,'' he added, ``but why
don't they ever talk about my wife, and about her life?''
   He said he visits his wife daily at North Shore University
Hospital in Manhasset, where she has been in a coma since a Dec. 13
car accident. Mrs. Klein, 32, is about 17 weeks pregnant.
   ``I tell her about friends who have called,'' Klein said,
acknowledging that he's not sure his wife can understand him. ``I
tell her about our daughter, and just generally about how my day
went.''
   ``I'm just taking one day at a time,'' he added. ``Inside, I'm
tearing up, but I'm trying to keep a smile on my face. Hopefully,
everything will work out.''
   In the lower court ruling, Judge Bernard McCaffrey said that ``as
of this time an abortion is not medically necessary'' to save Mrs.
Klein's life.
   But McCaffrey said the issue before the court was Mrs. Klein's
constitutional rights. If she were competent, he said, she would
have the absolute right to an abortion up to the 24th week of
pregnancy.
   Five medical experts testified that pregnancy increased the risks
for the comatose patient and could possibly threaten her life. But
two medical experts testified the pregnancy was not life-threatening.
   Short has said he and Broderick are the only parties addressing
the issue of Mrs. Klein's psychological health.
   ``Were she to recover, being told that her child is alive,
psychologically, could only be a benefit,'' he said. ``Telling her
that they killed her child, psychologically, could be a disaster.''

   Jack Lusk is neatly dressed, polite,
enthusiastic, drives carefully and speaks English. So what's he
doing behind the wheel of a New York cab?
   The new 37-year-old chief of the city's Taxi and Limousine
Commission is moonlighting as a driver in hopes of setting new
standards for courtesy and reminding drivers that hacking is a
service industry.
   ``The riders have been terrific,'' Lusk told a reporter who was
invited to ride with him Wednesday. ``If you give people a good
quality ride, they will pay for it.''
   Lusk was unfailingly polite and cheerful and tried to make eye
contact with each passenger. Everyone got a warm hello and he
repeated the destination to confirm it.
   ``Do you need some help getting in?'' he asked solicitously of an
elderly woman struggling to seat herself. Before she answered, he
flung open his door and sprinted around the cab to close the door
for her.
   Wearing a yellow button-down shirt and camel V-neck sweater, Lusk
winced at the suggestion he's a good deal more clean cut than the
typical taxi driver.
   ``I'd like the whole industry to be clean cut,'' said Lusk, whose
regulates about 35,000 drivers and 12,000 vehicles.
   He said the agency's mandatory, three-week training program,
which he completed, must be beefed up along with standards for the
English proficiency test, which only 7 percent of applicants fail
even though many are recent immigrants.
   And what about the traffic?
   ``I'm constantly impressed by the number of close calls,'' he
said after slamming on the brakes when a car stopped short in front
of him.

   The seven impersonators all would be ``The King,''
and they did their best to keep alive the memory of Elvis Presley at
a downtown tavern.
   ``I'm a big Elvis fan,'' said security guard Dan Haley, 27, who
appeared at the weekly amateur show Tuesday at Choice's bar.
   ``He was an original. He introduced sex into music. It was sad
later in his life when he got fat and into drugs, but in his prime
he was one of the best.''
   The impersonators sang ``Don't Be Cruel'' and other Presley tunes
and ate one of his favorite snacks, jelly doughnuts, to celebrate
the singer's amazing popularity 11{ years after his death.
   ``I wish he was alive,'' said bartender Dave Fanning, 25. ``His
music is not going to die.''
   Haley and Fanning each sported a pompadour, white jumpsuit, cape
and boots. They arrived at the bar in a limousine with two other
impersonators who wore sunglasses and Hawaiian leis.
   Among the other impersonators was six-year-old Billy Nielsen, who
sang ``Blue Suede Shoes'' and tried his best to look like Presley.
   Billy's mother, Kelly, 29, said she's a big Elvis fan but her son
is ``even a bigger fan.''
   ``That's all he listens to,'' she said, ``my Elvis records.''

   The Energy Department's $81 billion plan to
modernize and clean up nuclear weapons plants over 20 years would
save the nation's production of war devices but fail to remove all
environmental hazards, the head of General Accounting Office says.
   ``Modernization activities would essentially be completed by
2010, and the nation would have a revitalized weapons complex,''
Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher told a congressional hearing
Wednesday. ``However, problems in the environmental area would still
be with us.''
   Bowsher told the House Budget Committee it would take up to $155
billion over 30 years to modernize the industry, clean up closed
plants and protect the environment from radioactive contamination.
   Material for nuclear weapons is produced at reactors and other
facilities in a dozen states, but has effectively stopped because of
safety concerns at reactor sites in Washington state, Nevada and
South Carolina.
   Energy officials told another congressional committee last week
they hope to get the tritium-producing reactor at the Savannah River
site in South Carolina back in operation before the end of the year,
but may not be able to do it that soon. The reactor has been out of
operation since August when an unexplained power surge caused it to
shut down and other potential hazards were discovered.
   The Energy Department, in an unsigned statement submitted to the
House committee, said the department ``has produced and maintained
an effective nuclear deterrent that is the cornerstone of our
national defense.''
   But the department acknowledged that past decisions have focused
on meeting short-term national security needs rather than
environmental and safety concerns.
   It said the practice at many of the facilities of dumping waste
into open, unlined pits and ponds has led to ``a major challenge in
restoring the soil and groundwater underlying some inactive waste
sites.''
   Bowsher, in his testimony, said, ``In our opinion, the
(department's) plan does not adequately address the cleanup of
existing facilities and decontamination of facilities as they are
retired from service.''
   He said if problems affecting the nuclear complex are not
addressed soon, ``the country's ability to produce and maintain a
nuclear weapons arsenal is in serious jeopardy.''
   Bowsher said the major difference between his congressional
watchdog agency's estimate of $105 billion to $155 billion and the
Energy Department estimate of $81 billion to modernize and clean up
the plants is over how much it will take to decontaminate and
protect the environment.
   Bowsher said the nuclear weapons complex is ``one of the more
potentially dangerous industrial operations in the world'' and some
nuclear production sites may be ``irreversibly contaminated.''
   He said Energy Department plans to spend $315 million in fiscal
1990 on environmental cleanup represent ``only a small down
payment'' on the $40 billion to $70 billion needed.

   The Boeing 707 that crashed in the Azores
Islands, killing all 144 people aboard, had recorded no serious
mechanical problems and relatively few flight hours for a
20-year-old jet, officials said.
   The craft, one of two Boeing 707s owned by Independent Air Corp.,
had logged 12,500 cycles, or takeoffs and landings, and less than
50,000 hours in the air.
   ``If properly maintained, there should not be a problem because
of hours or number of cycles,'' said Jack Barker, a Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman in Atlanta. ``Other aircraft involved in
the news have had as much as 50,000 cycles, a great many more.''
   The Caribbean-bound charter jet, carrying 137 vacationers from
Italy and a seven-member American crew, crashed into a fog-shrouded
mountain Wednesday as it approached an airport in the Portuguese
archipelago for refueling.
   A.L. Pittman, president of Independent Air, headquartered in this
town 25 miles southeast of Nashville, told reporters that for
employees of the air charter service ``it's like losing a member of
your family.''
   ``Generally everybody knows everybody else in a company this
size,'' Pittman said. ``There have been some tears here today in
shock.''
   The crew members were: Leon Daugherty, 41, of Nashville, the
captain; Sammy Adcock, 36, Nashville, 1st officer; Jorge Gonzalez,
34, Rex, Ga., the flight engineer; and flight attendants Yvette
Murray, 26, of Marietta, Ga., Angela Urban, 24, West Palm Beach,
Fla.; and Helen Ziegler, 45, Warner Robins, Ga., and Sabrina
Cromarty of Atlanta.
   Ms. Murray and the captain were planning to be married May 20,
according to her father, Tom Murray of Atlanta.
   The plane had seven service difficulty reports during the past
six years, according to records at the FAA's aeronautical center in
Oklahoma City, spokeswoman Bobbie Mardis said.
   A report filed in January 1983 said the plane's No. 2 engine was
shut down due to turbine failure. Another that month said a switch
in the main landing gear failed and was replaced. Further details on
the incidents were not immediately available, Ms. Mardis said.
   Two reports filed July 1987 showed problems with the plane's
altimeter and air speed monitors. In the latter case, the plane
returned to Atlanta for repairs.
   The latest report, filed in December, indicated that during
inspection a mechanic noticed a crack in an engine fan duct. The
duct was replaced and the plane was returned to service.
   Barker said Wednesday night that he had not seen the reports and
did not know their contents, but he said any faults with the plane
would not be considered a problem, ``not if they've been repaired.''
   He added that the FAA had fined Independent Air $18,000 in 1984,
but he did not know why.
   Pittman said one of the company's two jetliners lost oil pressure
Jan. 21 as it flew into Denver and was repaired for eight to 10
hours before it resumed flying. He did not know if the jet was the
one that crashed Wednesday.
   ``I'm not aware (of the service difficulty reports) so I'd have
to say they are fairly minor,'' said Orien Dickerson, the company's
vice president and co-founder. ``We have the same stringent
monitoring program as Delta, American and all the major airlines.''
   Independent Air is 15 years old and flies 400-500 charters per
year, mostly in the Caribbean and Europe.

   Flight attendant Yvette Murray and pilot
Leon Daugherty often worked together and boarded a chartered jet
with plans of building a life together.
   Wednesday, they died together.
   Ms. Murray, 26, of Marietta, and Daugherty, 41, of Nashville,
Tenn., were planning to be married May 20, according to Ms. Murray's
father, Tom Murray of Atlanta.
   But their Boeing 707 crashed into a mountain in the Azores on
Wednesday, killing all 144 aboard.
   Both worked for Independent Air Corp. of Smyrna, Tenn. The
charter plane, bearing 137 Italian tourists and an American crew of
seven, was flying from Bergamo, Italy, to the Dominican Republic,
and would have continued without passengers to Jamaica.
   Murray said his daughter was undaunted about flying despite
recent crashes and maintenance problems in the airline industry.
   ``She loved flying, it was a big thing for her,'' he said.
``Because she was going to be married, she didn't think they'd let
her continue flying.
   ``She probably would have been out of this thing in a month or
so.''
   The couple had planned to live in Acworth, near Atlanta.
Daugherty had bought a house there, Murray said.
   ``He also bought her a horse two weeks ago. He was so kind to
her,'' Murray said.
   ``She was a very nice, sweet girl,'' said the pilot's mother,
Robbie Daugherty of Nashville. ``We were close.''
   Mrs. Daugherty said her son had worked as a pilot for several air
freight companies before he joined Independent Air. He owned his own
plane, and flew helicopters in the Tennessee National Guard.
   ``He called me Sunday from Jamaica and asked me to tell the Guard
he couldn't fly because of his job,'' Mrs. Daugherty said.
   Ms. Murray grew up in Tampa, Fla., and had worked as a waitress
and a cellular phone saleswoman before becoming a flight attendant,
her father said.
   ``She was a beautiful little girl,'' Murray said.

<TEXT>
   A black man who died in police custody
was the victim of drug use and not police brutality, as some
activists have claimed, officials said.
   Despite the autopsy finding, about 55 demonstrators marched
outside Town Hall for an ninth straight night Wednesday to protest
what they alleged to be brutality against 22-year-old John ``Tony''
Jackson.
   ``It's the same answers that they had before,'' said Frank
Osborne, Jackson's uncle and leader of the nightly marches.
``They've diverted the traffic, that wasn't the issue. We have to go
further.''
   The ``death, in my opinion, was caused by cardiac arrhythmia,
brought on by cocaine use,'' Morris County Medical Examiner Dr.
Ernest E. Tucker said. ``As far as police brutality is concerned, I
couldn't find any evidence of police brutality. ...
   ``I am calling this a homicide on the grounds that whoever
supplied the drugs is responsible for his death,'' he said.
   County Prosecutor Lee Trumbull said his office and local police
will investigate the case as a homicide.
   ``In terms of police brutality ... that case has ended,''
Trumbull said. `We now have a homicide investigation under way.
   ``Unequivocally, the Morristown Police Department or any
individual member is not a suspect,'' he said. ``I would like to see
the community as vigorous in attempting to identify the source of
the drugs that killed Tony Jackson as they've been in protesting.''
   David Manahan, mayor of this affluent township about 30 miles
west of New York, welcomed the findings. But the mayor, who has
asked U.S. Justice Department mediators to look at the case,
criticized Trumbull for not talking with leaders in the black
community before releasing the medical examiner's report at a news
conference.
   ``The main problem here has been one of trust and mistrust, and I
think an opportunity was lost in the press conference,'' he said.
   Cardiac arrhythmia, as described by Tucker, occurs when a
person's heart quivers and cannot pump sufficient quantities of
blood. The person faints and loses consciousness because blood
cannot reach the brain.
   Traces of cocaine, heroin, quinine and codeine were found in
Jackson's blood and urine. Tucker said the drugs were taken in the
hour before death.
   Jackson had puncture marks on both arms but Tucker said he did
not know if they were from medical efforts to revive Jackson or from
the victim's own drug injections.
   The autopsy also showed Jackson had a laceration above the right
eyebrow and a bruise on the scalp, but Tucker said they caused no
damage to the skull or brain and did not contribute to his death.
   Jackson also had a history of bronchial asthma but that did not
play any rose in his death, Tucker said.
   Jackson died Jan. 28 after he ran away from police who tried to
arrest him on a traffic warrant. Police caught him after he bumped
into an officer in the low-income housing project where he lived.
   Afterward, Jackson complained of shortness of breath, police
said. Witnesses said he cried out for help and collapsed soon after.
Police took him to Morristown Memorial Hospital, where he was
pronounced dead.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index, edging up
only slightly, set a record high for the fifth consecutive trading
day today, while the dollar declined marginally against the Japanese
yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 32,078.43 after a
13.31-point, or 0.04 percent, gain from its previous record closing
of 32,065.12 on Wednesday.
   The index had gained 178.64 points in early trading but
institutional and foreign investors, major buyers in the morning,
started taking profits in the afternoon, dealers said.
   Electricals, including Sony and Toshiba, were among the gainers
in active trading. First section volume was estimated at 1.6 billion
shares.
   The dollar closed at 129.39 yen, down 0.11 yen from Wednesday's
close of 129.50 yen. After opening at 129.40 yen, the currency
stayed in a tight range of 129.35-129.43 yen.
   Market players remained on the sidelines ahead of President
Bush's budget address to Congress Thursday night, dealers said.

   It is highly unlikely Charles Manson
will ever be freed, the chairman of the state parole board said
after the panel refused to release the notorious mass murderer for a
seventh time.
   ``He's still at war with society and definitely a danger ... but
anything is possible,'' Albert Leddy, chairman of the three-member
Board of Prison Terms, told reporters after announcing Wednesday
that Manson will remain at San Quentin Prison at least three more
years.
   Manson, leader of a cult-like ``family'' that in 1969 went on a
grisly month-long murder spree, killing actress Sharon Tate and
eight other people, was denied parole by a unanimous vote.
   Manson declined to attend the hearing after complaining about
being held in handcuffs and a waist chain that was too long. The
panel offered to let him come in without chains, pending approval by
the warden, but he declined, said spokesman Vernell Crittendon.
   ``He is vicious and he is terrible,'' Steven Kay, a deputy
district attorney from Los Angeles, told the panel. ``He certainly
is one of the most vicious killers we have ever had in the history
of our country.''
   Leddy said parole for Manson was rejected because of the nature
of the slayings, many of which involved torture and mutilation; an
extensive criminal history dating to childhood; an unfavorable
psychiatric report; disciplinary problems in prison; and no
indication his behavior would change if he were released.
   Outside the prison walls, three men and a woman dressed in black
demonstrated in favor of Manson's bid for parole, waving signs, one
of which read, ``Find A New Boogieman, Give Charlie A Break.''
   ``It's sort of a human rights thing,'' explained demostrator Tina
Williams of San Francisco. ``Everybody in America should be allowed
a fair hearing and he didn't get one.''
   Kay told the board he doubted Manson was seriously interested in
being paroled. On previous occasions, Kay said Manson indicated he
would like to be paroled to Death Valley with spiders and snakes, or
else be sent to outer space.
   At his last parole hearing three years ago, Manson said he was a
``force of darkness'' and had been spending his time fashioning
scorpion dolls to unleash ``torment'' into the world outside.
   Kay also told the board that since the conviction of Manson and
many of his followers, the state has received 352,000 letters and
petitions from people opposed to their paroles.
   Leddy said it is ``highly unlikely'' the murderer ever will be
freed.
   Manson was convicted of masterminding the 1969 Los Angeles
slayings of Miss Tate, coffee heiress Abigail Folger, hairdresser
Jay Sebring, Polish filmmaker Voityk Frykowski, Stephen Parent,
musician Gary Hinman, stuntman Donald ``Shorty'' Shea and Leno and
Rosemary LaBianca.
   Manson, saved from the gas chamber by a state Supreme Court
decision overturning California's death penalty law, is serving a
life prison term.

   In a courtyard where only enormous
wooden and rusting beams keep the walls from collapsing, the
money-changers ply their trade.
   In this sensitive and openly tolerated black market, the value of
currency can change with a small gesture of the hand or inflection
of the voice.
   Today there is no sign of panic. The U.S. dollar is changing
hands for 210 afghanis, compared to 238 a week ago when Soviet
soldiers were still seen in full force.
   Now the Soviets are all but gone, and the money-changers say
there's a feeling their departure will lead to peace and that the
perenially warring Afghans will settle down to their traditional way
of handling things _ by making a deal.
   Whether that's a realistic attitude remains to be seen, but the
Red Army's departure is having a buoyant effect.
   ``We didn't need them here,'' said one money-changer, Mohammad
Yahir. ``We have problems, but we can solve them ourselves, God
willing. I think it will be OK.''
   One by one, Soviet bases around this city of 2 million people
have been handed over to Afghan government forces.
   Several hundred Soviet soldiers are still hanging on to guard the
Kabul airport, but they are to leave by next week.
   The rest of the thousands of Red Army troops who were around the
capital three weeks ago are home or on their way, either in convoys
heading up the snowy Salang Highway to the Soviet border or on huge
military transport planes.
   Moslem guerrillas have launched few rocket attacks on Kabul, and
the government shelling of guerrilla hideouts in the mountains has
tapered off.
   On the surface at least, Kabul is calm.
   The markets bustle with women clad in traditional chadris, the
all-enveloping veil that cascades in pleats from a skullcap, with a
coarse mesh panel over the eyes.
   Children slide down the icy hills and fly kites in the street.
   Smoke-belching buses and horn-blaring taxis jam the narrow
streets.
   Carts filled with fresh bananas and oranges from neighboring
Pakistan and pomegranates and apples from other parts of Afghanistan
mask for a few seconds the stench of impoverished humanity.
   On Chicken Street, the main venue for foreigners and the wealthy,
merchants sell everything from centuries-old carpets and antique
muskets to Swiss watches and German beer.
   ``Goods are still coming in. There is plenty of food and other
goods. All you need is the money to pay,'' said a merchant who
identified himself only as Tamoor.
   The Soviet armored personnel carriers that a few days ago stood
at the end of Chicken Street are gone. In their place are Afghan
soldiers, clutching a Soviet-designed Kalashnikov rifle in one hand
and prayer beads in the other.
   Few signs remain of Moscow's nine-year military intervention
except for the Volga and Moskvich cars, fur hats, vodka and Russian
caviar _ which has nearly tripled in price since the final Soviet
withdrawal started in early January.
   Afghans openly voice their hostility toward Soviets and look upon
foreigners with suspicion.
   ``Where are you from?'' Qurban Ali asked a group of Westerners.
   ``England,'' one of them answered.
   ``Forgive me,'' Ali said, motioning the group inside his carpet
shop. ``I thought you were Russian.''
   For the city's 350,000 poor people, things are not so comfortable.
   A Soviet airlift and attacks on guerrillas blocking the Salang
Highway have eased shortages of flour, but lines persist at the
shacks where bread is sold. The poorest people survive on diets of
bread, rice and tea.
   Heating oil and fuel are even scarcer, making a bitter winter
even harder.
   A liter of gasoline sells on the black market for 175 to 500
afghanis ($3.20 to $9.10 at the official exchange rate), compared to
30 afghanis (55 cents at the official rate) for the scarce and
tightly rationed government supplies.
   ``I had to walk seven kilometers (four miles) to work today,''
said a government interpreter. ``It's best to live near the trolley
lines. They run on electricity.''

<HEAD>Provisional Government Investigating Stroessner Finances</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new government of coup leader Gen.
Andres Rodriguez is investigating allegations of financial
irregularities involving public funds controlled by deposed
President Alfredo Stroessner.
   Stroessner, ruler of this landlocked South American country since
1954, was ousted from power Friday in a coup engineered by
Rodriguez. About 50 people died in the takeover, and Stroessner was
sent in exile Sunday to Brazil.
   Charges of corruption under Stroesser were widespread. Opposition
politicians, once persecuted and now allowed to speak freely, have
called for the creation of a commission to recover funds misspent
under the old regime.
   Attorney Pedro Abilio Rolon filed a suit Monday charging three
former government ministers and Stroessner's long-time personal
secretary, Mario Abdo Benitez, of using public funds and accepting
bribes to obtain mansions, apartments and autos. Rolon sought an
embargo on their local bank accounts.
   That action was followed Tuesday by Gen. Juan Antonio Caceres,
former minister of public works, who alleged that Stroessner
personally controlled at least two accounts funded by public money.
   On Wednesday, the Central Bank announced it was going to
``control withdrawals'' from accounts ``of some government
institutions.''
   Caceres noted Stroessner, 76, had signature power over funds
exceeding $4 million _ revenues from highway tolls and gasoline
taxes.
   Caceres said he didn't know what Stroessner used the money for,
but that in general, the funds were not available for use by his
ministry.
   A Paraguayan businessman with close contacts in the banking
industry said government officials loyal to Stroessner wrote and
hurriedly tried to cash checks written on government accounts
immediately following his ouster.
   Aldo Zuccolillo, publisher of the newspaper ABC Color, which was
closed by Stroessner but hopes to reopen this month, said the
Central Bank measure was ``good, intelligent.''
   ``This was taxpayers' money being administered as though it were
a personal checking account,'' Zuccolillo said, adding, ``There must
be dozens more accounts like this linked to other government
ministries in state-run companies.''
   The Central Bank said the reason for the measure, which could
cause delays in the payment of some government checks, was ``to
obtain better control and greater clarification of the destination,
and correct application, of public funds.''
   Luis Ortiz, secretary to new Economy Minister Enzo de Bernardi,
said the bank would review ``all checks written by government
officials who no are longer government officials.'' De Bernardi is
in charge of the bank.
   In a separate development, he told reporters Paraguay's foreign
debt amounts to $2 billion, and there don't appear to be funds to
keep making payments. The last payment was made in December, he said.
   ``The Treasury needs funds and if we do not find them, we'll have
to talk with our creditors,'' he said.
   Foreign Minister Luis Maria Argana declined to blame Stroessner.
   ``He was a great president for many years,'' said Argana, who
under Stroessner served as president of the Supreme Court.
``Unfortunately, during the last two years, he was surrounded by a
group of totally irresponsible, greedy politicians totally lacking
in patriotism.''

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in more than 40
years, an independent daily newspaper has begun publishing in this
Soviet bloc nation, the latest sign of an increasing tolerance for
openness in Hungarian media.
   The first issue of Mai Nap (Today) contained an article that said
the 1956 uprising should be commemorated with ``a national and
historic holiday.''
   Publication of the article plunged the 24-page tabloid, which is
competing with Budapest's official Esti Hirlap, into a controversy
over the revolt that was crushed by Soviet tanks.
   Imre Pozsgay, a leading reformer in the Communist Party's ruling
Politburo, last month called it a popular uprising.
   Party leader Karoly Grosz and several senior officials opposed to
Hungary's fast-moving reform movement rebuked Pozsgay, insisting on
maintaining the official line that the rising was a
counterrevolution to destroy communism.
   On Monday, the state-run MTI news agency carried statements by
official and independent groups backing the widely popular Pozsgay.
   The policy-setting Central Committee is to discuss the issue on
Friday at a session that could result in major leadership changes.
   Last weekend, the daughter of Imre Nagy, the premier who led the
revolt, and widows of two Nagy colleagues who were executed with him
for roles in the uprising called for a public reburial of the three.
   It was in this atmosphere that Mai Nap began serializing the
hitherto unpublished memoirs of the late Zoltan Vas, a senior party
official.
   In the memoirs, Vas stands up for Nagy and for Nagy's aim ``to
set up a typically Hungarian economic and political new socialist
state system _ and a new page in the history of Hungarian
socialism.''
   The memoirs quote Janos Kadar, the longtime party leader
installed by the Soviets in 1956, as denouncing the
``counterrevolution'' as an ``armed uprising against state order and
institutions.''
   Vas, as quoted by Mai Nap, said in the memoirs, ``In my view,
even if Kadar then so saw Oct. 23, 1956 (the start of the uprising),
this day is a national and historic holiday of the Hungarian people
like March 15, 1848.''
   That date marked the start of the Hungarian uprising against the
Hapsburg monarchy. Like the 1956 revolt against communist rule, it
was suppressed.
   According to Mai Nap, officials detained Vas in February 1973 on
the grounds his memoirs contained anti-Soviet sedition. When Vas
told investigators a copy had been deposited abroad, he was soon
freed, the daily reported.
   The independent tabloid, which also featured many photographs and
sports stories, costs 1.7 cents a copy, well above the price of Esti
Hirlap.

<TEXT>
   Navajo Chairman Peter McDonald, accused
of taking kickbacks in tribe transactions, said his observance of
Indian tradition in accepting ``gifts'' was minor compared to the
excesses of Washington politicians.
   In a 25-minute hookup with tribal radio station KTNN Wednesday,
Peter MacDonald lashed out at former first lady Nancy Reagan,
Congress in general and members of the Senate Select Committee on
Indian Affairs, which is investigating allegations of bribery in his
administration.
   ``I don't need designer dresses loaned to me like Nancy Reagan.
Nobody is offering me $5,000 a night for speaking engagements,''
MacDonald told radio listeners during a visit to Crownpoint, N.M.,
for a shopping center dedication.
   He declined to answer reporters' questions later.
   MacDonald was acquitted in 1977 of federal fraud and
income-tax-evasion charges. According to testimony before the Senate
committee, the 60-year-old chairman of the nation's largest tribe
has profited from kickbacks in a variety of official Navajo
transactions, including the $33.4 million purchase of the Big
Boquillas Ranch.
   MacDonald said the Senate probe was racist and aimed at
undermining tribal sovereignty.
   ``They are the gentlemen who are investigating my ethics of
serving without one scrap of evidence that the favors I have
received somehow mean I have sold out the tribe,'' he said. ``This
is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong.''
   ``Yes, I have accepted gifts, but that is not a crime,'' he said.
   McDonald has been invited to testify but has not appeared before
the committee, which began its inquiry last year after The Arizona
Republic published articles alleging waste and corruption on
reservations and in federal Indian programs.
   The investigation threatened tribal sovereignty because the
government was near to denying Navajos the right to enter into
binding contracts, MacDonald said.
   An estimated 170,000 of the nation's 200,000 Navajos live on the
25,000-square-mile reservation that covers much of northeastern
Arizona and sprawls into northwestern New Mexico and southeastern
Utah.
   Bryon T. ``Bud'' Brown, a Phoenix real estate broker, has
testified under a grant of immunity that he paid MacDonald $25,000
to amortize a bank loan, gave him $50,000 in cash and made a $50,000
BMW automobile available as his share of the $7.2 million profit
realized by Brown's friend on the sale of the Big Boquillas.
   Brown had arranged for businessman Tom Tracy to buy the ranch
from Tenneco West Inc. for $26.2 million. A few hours later, the
tribe paid $33.4 million for the 491,000-acre spread in western
Arizona.
   The account was corroborated before the committee by McDonald's
son, Peter McDonald Jr., also testifying under immunity.
   MacDonald told listeners too much emphasis had been placed on how
the land was acquired, ignoring that the land could generate a
profit.
   ``Because I supported and devoted the greatest land acquisition
in the history of the Navajo people, I'm supposed to have sold out,
to have betrayed my people. Well, let me tell you this: I didn't
need any favors from Bud Brown.''

   A substance made from two natural proteins blocks
AIDS virus infection in the test tube and may prod the body into
fighting the virus, scientists reported today.
   One protein, called CD4, is already in human testing for its
ability to block infection. But it may stay in the bloodstream
longer if fused to the other protein, researchers said.
   In addition, this hybrid could bind to special sites on white
blood cells in the test tube, suggesting that in people it may
trigger an immune system attack on the virus and AIDS-infected blood
cells, researchers said.
   Results of experiments with the hybrid, called CD4 immunoadhesin,
appear in today's issue of the British journal Nature. The work was
done by scientists from Genentech Inc., of South San Francisco, the
National Cancer Institute and the New England Deaconess Hospital in
Boston.
   CD4 is normally found on the surface of some blood cells. The
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome binds to CD4
as an inital step in infecting those cells.
   Recent studies suggest that unattached CD4 can act as a decoy
that uses up the specialized binding sites on the AIDS virus,
leaving the virus unable to infect blood cells.
   But in their Nature report, researchers said animal studies
suggest that CD4 may be eliminated quickly from the human
bloodstream. Half of any given amount may be gone within a half hour
to two hours, a measure called half-life, they said.
   Researchers fused the CD4 molecule to part of another human
protein called an antibody. In rabbits, this hybrid stayed in the
bloodstream up to nearly 200 times longer than CD4, the researchers
said.
   In people, its half-life may be about three weeks, they said.
   The hybrid also blocked AIDS infection of blood cells in the test
tube, researchers said.
   The research is ``a very logical approach'' for extending
half-life, but that may also be achieved in other ways, said Robert
Schooley of Harvard Medical School.
   Schooley, who is testing CD4 in humans, also cautioned that the
usefulness of using CD4 alone or attached to other substances has
not yet been determined.

   The Ginza, Tokyo's glitzy commercial center, has
become the most expensive street in the world, relegating
Manhattan's East 57th Street to second place, according to a survey.
   The rental survey was conducted by the Hirschfeld Companies Inc.,
a New York-based retail real-estate marketing firm, and released
Wednesday.
   Although the Ginza edged East 57th Street out of the first-place
spot it held last year, Manhattan thoroughfares still managed to
garner four of the top 10 places.
   The survey found that retailers on the Ginza pay an average rent
of $650 a square foot.
   The rest of the top 10 were:
   _ East 57th Street ($435)
   _ Fifth Avenue between 50th and 59th streets ($375)
   _ Madison Avenue between 62nd and 72nd streets ($335)
   _ Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, Calif. ($225)
   _ Nathan Road in Hong Kong ($200)
   _ Bond Street in London ($180)

   A man who used a variety of disguises to commit
a string of robberies in recent months was arrested at a novelty
shop where he returned to replenish his supply, authorities said.
   After his arrest, Steven Fleenor, 30, confessed to robberies at a
bank and four restaurants in the St. Louis area, detectives said
Wednesday. More than $22,000 was taken in the robberies, Sgt. Dan
Saitz said.
   The suspect posed as a woman, a bald man with a mustache and an
elderly man with false teeth. But detectives used a false mustache
abandoned during a thwarted bank robbery and police chase Jan. 31 to
identify the source of the disguises as Gibbol's Novelties and
Costumes.
   The detectives asked the owner of the shop to notify police if
the suspect returned, and he did, on Tuesday.
   ``He said he was with a local theater group connected to a small
church,'' manager Conrad Dunn said. ``He was real pleasant, a real
nice guy.''
   Fleenor was charged Wednesday with five counts of robbery, two
counts of armed criminal action and two counts of auto theft,
authorities said.

<HEAD>Freshman Applications Down at Top Colleges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Freshman applications are down at top colleges
around the country for the first time in years, the likely outcome
of a dwindling number of high school graduates and ever-higher
tuitions, admissions officers say.
   The decline in graduating high school students is considered the
prime culprit, according to more than a dozen admissions officers
interviewed since Feb. 1, the deadline for fall freshman
applications at many of the nation's most competitive schools.
   ``Since this is happening to everyone, the best guess is that
it's demographics,'' said Michael C. Behnke, admissions director of
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where applications are
down 10 percent from a year ago.
   But some officials suspect that students and their families may
finally be reacting to tuition increases that have consistently
exceeded the nation's overall inflation rate throughout the 1980s.
   ``I think there's a great possibility that tuitions are a part of
it,'' said Linda Davis Taylor, admissions director of Amherst
College, where applications are off by 4 percent from last year. ``I
don't know of any topic that's being discussed more by boards of
trustees.''
   The number of high school seniors has dropped steadily from 3
million in 1980 to 2.76 million in 1988, and is expected to bottom
out at 2.44 million by 1992.
   An unexpected increase in the ranks of older students and higher
percentages of high school students attending college helped offset
that decline in the number of 18-year-olds. Thus, to the surprise of
many, college enrollments grew from 12.1 million to 12.5 million
since 1980, and were up at 54 percent of the nation's colleges and
universities, according to an annual survey by the American Council
on Education.
   But college officials believe that the drop in applications for
next fall's freshman class is the first sign that the long-expected
decline in enrollment is about to arrive.
   Harvard University spokesman Peter Costa estimates a 5-10 percent
drop in applications, the first such decline in at least two
decades. Brown University and most other Ivy League schools are
reporting similar declines.
   Stanford University's fall applications have dropped 6 percent,
from 15,828 to 14,869, according to Lynne Madison, assistant dean of
undergraduate admissions.
   At University of California at Berkeley, applications are also
down, from 21,944 to 20,835 for next fall's entering class.
   ``I consider this a yellow light. We all kind of anticipated
this,'' said Bradley Quin, admissions director of Lafayette College
in Easton, Pa., where applications are down about 5 percent. ``I
don't mean to imply that we're not concerned. This is a competitive
business, and it's going to make it that much harder to increase the
quality of our classes.''
   Apart from the population changes, school officials say students
may also be cutting down on the number of schools they apply to
following a decade in which multiple applications increased sharply.
   An annual survey of entering freshmen by the American Council on
Education and the University of California at Los Angeles found that
a record 37 percent applied to at least three colleges in fall 1988,
compared with 26 percent in 1980.
   That increase has generally been attributed to students wanting
to improve their odds of getting into a top school, and to shopping
around for the best financial aid deals as tuitions have soared.
   But students are apparently starting to think twice about
submitting a dozen or more applications now that application fees
have hit $40, $50 and more.
   ``When you start talking about $50 fees, you get more
selective,'' said Sanford Rivers, associate director of admissions
at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.

<HEAD>High Society Dance Teacher Dead at 68</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frank ``Killer Joe'' Piro, the dancer who taught
high society everything from the cha-cha to the hully-gully, has
died of kidney disease at age 68.
   Piro, who got his nickname because he easily outlasted partners
on the dance floor, died Tuesday at a hospital in Manhattan.
   For decades, the short, sinewy dancer performed on stage and
television, taught at his Manhattan studio and made nightly rounds
of parties and clubs. Always a step ahead of fashion, Piro taught
the mambo, the cha-cha and the merengue, then the twist, the frug,
the frog and the watusi.
   His students included the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and Luci
Baines Johnson, daughter of President Lyndon Johnson, not to mention
other dancers such as Dame Margot Fonteyn and Ray Bolger.
   Piro was born in East Harlem, the son of an Italian tailor. He
said he took up dancing at a neighborhood social club to meet girls.
   He dropped out of school after eighth grade, working at
construction jobs and plastics designing. Meanwhile, he kept winning
Harlem dance contests, including the 1942 National Jitterbug
Championship at the Harvest Moon Ball.
   After serving in the Coast Guard during World War II, Piro
entered and won dance contests at the Palladium so often, he said,
they offered him $15 a week to teach dancing _ and stop competing.
   He is survived by his wife, Lucienne; a daughter, a stepson and
two sisters.

<HEAD>Study: Out-patient Alcohol Detoxification Effective</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many alcoholics can be treated for their addiction
just as effectively _ and much more cheaply _ at outpatient clinics
rather than hospital treatment wards, a study today concludes.
   The report found that people suffering from mild to moderate
symptoms of alcohol withdrawal stay off booze just as long when
treated as outpatients. Those who went into the hospital were more
likely to get through the initial program, but after six months
those treated as outpatients were doing just as well.
   The study, directed by Dr. Motoi Hayashida, was conducted at the
Veterans Administration Medical Center in Philadelphia and published
in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   ``We conclude that out-patient medical detoxification is an
effective, safe and low-cost treatment for patients with mild to
moderate symptoms of alcohol withdrawal,'' the researchers wrote.
   The conclusions were based on 164 men who had volunteered for
treatment of alcohol withdrawal. They were randomly assigned to the
out-patient program or to hospital admission.
   Those treated as outpatients were given the drug oxazepam and
asked to report to a hospital clinic each day, where their blood
alcohol levels were measured and they were asked whether or not they
had been drinking.
   The cost for the outpatients ranged from $175 to $388, while for
those in the hospital it ranged from $3,319 to $3,665.
   Seventy-two percent of the outpatients and 95 percent of those
admitted to the hospital successfully completed detoxification.
However, after six months, there was no significant difference
between the two treatment approaches. About half of the men in both
groups said they had stayed sober.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Gerald L. Klerman of New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center said that several comparison studies
are being conducted to look at alcohol treatment programs.
   ``The results indicate that the majority of patients with mild to
moderate withdrawal symptoms do not require hospitalization but can
be treated safely and effectively as outpatients, with considerable
cost savings,'' he wrote.

<HEAD>Gov't Allows Former Somoza Officers To Leave After Nearly 10 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After nearly a decade of political
asylum in the Venezuelan Embassy, two former high-ranking officers
in the army of the ousted Somoza regime were permitted to leave and
flew to Guatemala.
   Col. Carlos O. Gutierrez and Capt. Mario Guerra Palacios arrived
in Guatemala City Wednesday night aboard a commercial flight from
Managua. They were greeted by a Venezuelan diplomat and taken to a
nearby hotel.
   Diplomatic sources in Guatemala told The Associated Press the
pair would remain in Guatemala a few days and that they planned to
seek political asylum in the United States. The sources spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The two fled to the Venezuelan Embassy in July 1979, the same
month the leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front took power
after a popular uprising ousted President Anastasio Somoza.
   Gutierrez, 62, and Guerra, 42, were members of the now-disbanded
National Guard, as the army was known under Somoza.
   Known as ``The Ranger'' because of his U.S. military training,
Gutierrez was one of Somoza's trusted officers. He had suffered two
heart attacks in confinement, and said in a 1986 interview that the
only way out was if the United States ``comes in and wipes these
Communists out.
   ``Either that, or we will end up dying here,'' he had said.
   Guerra kept himself busy by studying radio and television repair,
and completed a correspondence course in electronics in 1986.
   In Managua, the opposition newspaper La Prensa on Wednesday
quoted unidentified sources as saying the Foreign Ministry gave the
two a one-year ``exit permit'' instead of the customary safe-conduct
pass.
   Repeated telephone calls to the Foreign Ministry and the
Venezuelan Embassy in Managua went unanswered. Reporters were kept
away from several Venezuelan diplomats gathered at Managua's Cesar
Augusto Sandino International Airport before the pair left.
   Allowing the officers to leave was seen as a gesture of goodwill
toward the United States by the Sandinista government, which is
trying to cope with a rapidly deteriorating economy. Inflation
reached 20,000 percent in 1988.
   The government has blamed economic problems on eight years of war
with the U.S.-backed Contra rebels; Hurricane Joan, which struck the
Atlantic coast last October; and a U.S. trade embargo since 1985.
   President Daniel Ortega is scheduled to attend a summit of
Central American presidents next week in El Salvador. The meeting,
postponed many times, was called under a regional peace plan signed
by Ortega and the presidents of El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala,
Costa Rica in August 1987.

<TEXT>
   Heavy snow and strong winds buffeted states along the Great Lakes
today, causing whiteouts and traffic accidents as drifts up to 10
feet deep piled up. Snow fell in California and Utah.
   The Great Lakes storm left more than a foot of snow in parts of
northern Michigan on Wednesday night and drifts 6 to 10 feet deep.
Snow advisories were in effect today in much of the state.
   In northeast Ohio, blowing, drifting snow made snow removal
difficult if not impossible. Blowing snow caused whiteouts and many
traffic accidents in the area, which was under a winter storm
warning.
   Snow squalls developed over western New York, and up to 6 inches
of snow was forecast.
   A snow advisory was issued for northwest Pennsylvania.
   Snow began falling Wednesday night in the northern mountains of
Southern California, and rain fell along the coast. A winter storm
warning was in effect for mountains from the San Bernardino Range
northward and in the Owens Valley. Snow advisories were posted for
the Antelope Valley, northern foothills and valleys above 1,500
feet, the northern Sierra Nevada and the Lake Tahoe Basin.
   Snow also fell in St. George and Cedar City, Utah. A winter storm
warning was in effect for the mountains of southern Utah and a
winter storm watch was issued for mountains to the north tonight and
Friday.
   Today's forecast called for widespread rain across much of
central and Southern California; snow in the Southern California
mountains and much of Nevada; lake-effect snow along the eastern
shores of lakes Erie and Ontario and across eastern upper and
northern lower Michigan; and gusty winds from eastern Wyoming to the
upper Great Lakes and much of New England.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 20s and 30s in much of
the nation; in the teens in southern Idaho and from the upper
Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes and New England; in the 40s
and 50s from the Pacific Coast to the southern Rockies, western and
southern Texas, the lower Mississippi Valley and the southern
Atlantic Coast; and in the 60s and 70s in southern Arizona and
central and southern Florida.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 22
degrees below zero in Craig, Colo., to 74 degrees at Key West, Fla.

<HEAD>Shiite Moslem Amal Appear In Control Of South Lebanon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TYRE, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fresh from victory over their rivals in the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the militiamen of the Shiite Moslem Amal
appear to control south Lebanon.
   The country's south is divided into strips:
   First, there is the Israeli-controlled security zone along the
border, then an area patrolled by the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon,
then the Amal zone running up to Sidon, 35 miles north of the
Israeli border.
   Leaders of Amal say their control over south Lebanon means they
can also control attacks on Israeli soldiers in the security zone
Israel proclaimed near its border in south Lebanon. But they would
not strike at targets in Israel.
   ``No one is allowed to hold weapons or wear military clothes in
south Lebanon except Amal,'' said Ali Kreiss, the local Amal
political chief. ``Amal is responsible for the security of everyone
in south Lebanon.''
   The U.N. peacekeepers, numbering 5,800, have been in Lebanon
since a 1978 Israeli invasion. Israel set up its security zone in
1985.
   Kreiss said Amal's responsibility for security in south Lebanon
was laid out in agreements signed over the last three months with
the Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Before the agreements, hundreds were killed in fighting with the
PLO for control of Palestinian refugee camps, and with Hezbollah for
mastery of south Lebanon and Beirut's Shiite southern suburbs.
   The agreement means Amal has rid itself of ``direction from
outside, from other countries,'' Kreiss said, indirectly sneering at
Hezbollah dependence on Iran. He claimed Syrian backing for Amal did
not represent influence but ``relations.''
   Kreiss said four longstanding Amal tenets were included in the
agreement: All Lebanon must remain unified, Amal must have charge of
the south's security, no attacks may be carried out on U.N. forces,
and no foreigners may be kidnapped.
   To underscore the last point, Amal security chief Mohammed Harkus
had his men take Western journalists on a tour of Tyre, including
ancient Roman ruins.
   Led by a jeep with wailing siren, a convoy of four cars pushed
through snarled traffic.
   A small measure of Amal's control was that the siren persuaded
drivers to give way. Militias most often fire automatic rifles in
the air to clear traffic.
   Along the roads, Amal checkpoints monitored traffic and the
militia's green symbol was plastered on walls, along with posters of
the late Amal leader of south Lebanon, Daoud Daoud, who was killed
in last September's Amal-Hezbollah fighting.
   In Tyre, a city of 50,000 10 miles north of Israel's border,
people appear less grim than when Hezbollah's power was on the rise
and one cafe advertised live music. The Tehran-backed hard-liners
had banned music, ordered booze off store shelves, and papered walls
with posters of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   A stop for coffee by the journalists, at an outdoor cafe, drew
curious Lebanese unaccustomed to seeing foreigners in anarchic south
Lebanon.

<DATELINE>CLARKSVILLE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man accused of murdering 14 family
members in a 1987 Christmastime rampage had a ``love-hate
relationship'' with one of his daughters that might explain some of
the killings, a prosecutor said.
   R. Gene Simmons, 48, should be sentenced to death for strangling
and shooting his relatives, prosecutor John Bynum said in his
opening statements Wednesday.
   Bynum said the prosecution would present a note written by
Simmons that authorities found in a bank safe deposit box.
   ``It will show you and indicate to you a motive as to why Mr.
Simmons killed some of these people,'' specifically his oldest
daughter, Sheila; her husband and 6-year-old daughter, Sylvia; and
Simmons' wife, Becky, 46, said Bynum.
   ``It will describe a love-hate relationship with this daughter,''
Bynum told the jury. Relatives say Simmons fathered Sylvia.
   The defense attorney, Robert E. ``Doc'' Irwin, told the jury to
forget past publicity about the case.
   ``I want to ask you to be the most careful and most courageous
jury that ever sat in this county, perhaps in this state, in behalf
of the defendant,'' Irwin said.
   Bynum described how investigators found the bodies of Simmons'
wife, seven children, two of their spouses and four grandchildren at
the Simmons house north of Dover, 25 miles southeast of Clarksville.
   They found five bodies in the house on Dec. 28, 1987, and the
next day found seven bodies in a grave and the bodies of two babies
in the trunks of cars.
   Authorities found the bodies after arresting Simmons for a
40-minute shooting spree that left two dead and four wounded in
Russellville.
   Simmons has been convicted and sentenced to death for the two
Russellville murders. He has asked to be executed as soon as
possible, but an opponent of capital punishment has appealed the
sentence.
   Bynum said ballistics tests showed that a pistol Simmons handed
over to former Russellville Police Chief Herb Johnston upon his
arrest was the same one used to kill five relatives.
   Irwin told the jury there was no evidence to link Simmons with
the pistol before he handed it over and no evidence on Simmons'
whereabouts during the period when the deaths occurred.
   ``He would have to be around those people to kill them,'' the
attorney said.
   About 100 spectators crowded into the courtroom at the Johnson
County Courthouse, where the trial was moved from Russellville
because of publicity about the case.
   A dozen relatives of the victims sat on two benches in the front
of the courtroom. Several wept as Bynum told the jury the names of
those slain and how they died.

<TEXT>
   Amos 'n' Andy, the comic characters who
made ``holy mack'rel'' an American catch phrase but deeply offended
many blacks, may be coming out of retirement for a Broadway revival.
   A federal appeals panel has cleared the way for writer Stephen
Silverman to produce a stage show based on the famous pair, who were
featured on one of the most famous radio and television shows of its
era.
   The duo's Broadway debut still could be stopped if CBS, which
owns many of the rights to the characters, takes the case to the
U.S. Supreme Court. George Schweitzer, senior vice-president of
communications for CBS, said the network was reviewing that option.
   But Silverman, who wrote the script for ``Fresh Air Taxi,'' a
musical stage show that takes its name from the company Amos and
Andy ran, said he was going ahead.
   ``I've rewritten the script and now I'm looking for a producer,''
he said Wednesday, two days after the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals
overturned a lower court decision on trademark rights to the
characters.
   The ``Amos 'n' Andy'' show was introduced on radio in the 1920s,
when the black characters were all played by whites.
   Andy Brown, Amos Jones, Algonquin J. Calhoun, Kingfish, Sapphire
and the show's other characters came to television on CBS in 1951
and were portrayed by blacks.
   CBS pulled the show off the air in 1964 in response to complaints
by black viewers who were offended by the ethnic stereotyping of the
characters.
   Silverman, a former newspaper columnist who wrote the recent
``The Fox that Got Away'' and an upcoming biography on director
David Lean, said he first thought of an ``Amos 'n' Andy'' musical in
1981.
   He said he tried to contact CBS over use of the characters but
was continually rebuffed or ignored.
   In a lawsuit filed in 1984, Silverman argued that CBS had
abandoned its trademarks by no longer using the characters.
   In August 1987, U.S. District Judge Gerard Goettel ruled in favor
of CBS, saying that although the network had not used the properties
or revealed plans for their use, it wanted to hold the option.
   But the three-judge appeals panel noted that when the issue came
to court, the ``Amos 'n' Andy'' trademarks hadn't been used for 21
years.
   The judges ruled that the trademarks cannot be protected if use
was discontinued for more than 20 years. ``A bare assertion of
possible future use is not enough,'' the panel said.
   The judges did uphold the network's rights to all scripts
produced after 1948, when CBS purchased the rights from the show's
originators.
   But the ruling allows Silverman or anyone else to use any
characters connected with the show before 1948, as well as such
phrases from the show as ``Holy Mack'rel,'' ``Ain't dat sumpin'' and
``Scuse me for protrudin.''

<HEAD>Hudson Thought He was Cured of AIDS, Attorney Claims</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rock Hudson never told his homosexual lover
that he had AIDS because the actor thought he had been cured of the
fatal disease, an attorney for Hudson's estate said.
   ``I don't think he believed he had the AIDS virus in his blood
anymore,'' attorney Robert Mills said during closing arguments
Wednesday in an $11 million lawsuit filed by Marc Christian,
Hudson's former lover, against the actor's estate.
   Mills rebutted claims by Christian that Hudson had deliberately
hid his illness from his lover, saying, ``You don't tell someone you
have something that you don't believe you have.''
   Christian, 35, an aspiring musician who lived with Hudson in the
last two years of his life, contends he is entitled to compensation
for the ``enhanced fear'' he suffered when he found out that his
lover had AIDS.
   But Mills said that Hudson, who had been undergoing treatment in
France with an anti-AIDs drug, was told by a doctor there that he
was ``free of AIDS'' shortly before a final bout with the disease
that killed him.
   The attorney also argued that Christian lied when he said he had
sex with Hudson about 160 times between 1983 and 1985. Mills said it
would have been impossible for Christian not to have contracted the
disease under those circumstances, and suggested the tryst between
the two men ended long before Hudson was diagnosed as having AIDS.
   He said Christian has tested negative repeatedly in tests for
exposure to the AIDS virus.
   Earlier, Christian's lawyer, Harold Rhoden, told jurors that when
Hudson and Christian became lovers in 1983, ``This was a different
world as far as AIDS was concerned'' and Christian had no fears.
   ``If they had met today, there might be an argument that he
should have known better,'' Rhoden said in his final argument to the
jury. ``But they met in 1982. All the world knew was that homosexual
men were dying in New York and San Francisco. All there was was
speculation about what this thing was that was killing gay men.
There was talk of gay cancer.''
   In 1983, when the men became lovers, Rhoden said, ``There was no
reason to use a condom. There was no reason for Marc Christian to
believe he could get AIDS from Hudson.''
   Hudson, who played the leading man to such actresses as Doris
Day, Elizabeth Taylor and Linda Evans in movies and TV, died on Oct.
5, 1985, a few months after his battle with AIDS became public.
   Christian claims that he wasn't told about Hudson's disease until
the public announcement that the star was dying.

   A man who pleaded guilty to killing the
owner of a candy company by hitting him over the head with a giant

prison.
   Donald Morris Smith, 22, was sentenced Tuesday to 50 years for

   Dr. R. Patrick Dorion, a pathologist at Nash General Hospital,
said Doak died from a combination of the head wounds and
strangulation.

   Jurors began considering 29 charges
including attempted murder, burglary and arson against a man accused
in a series of sniper attacks.
   The jury asked Superior Court Judge Dominic F. Cresto to explain
which of approximately 75 exhibits, including a gun, bullet
fragments and casings allegedly used in the snipings, related to
each of the various charges against suspect Peter T. Trepanier.
   Before retiring to a downtown hotel Wednesday evening, the jury
also asked Cresto to repeat the definition of ``assault with intent
to commit murder.''
   Trepanier, 25, is charged with six counts of assault with intent
to commit murder and six counts of conspiracy to commit murder in
connection with nighttime sniper attacks in northern Rhode Island
between Dec. 8, 1986, and Jan. 8, 1987.
   He also is charged with seven counts of conspiracy to commit
burglary, seven counts of burglary and three of first-degree arson
in connection with a string of housebreaks and fires in the late
spring of 1987.
   He faces a maximum penalty of life in prison if convicted on the
arson charges.
   In his closing argument, defense lawyer John J. Hardiman said the
prosecution had produced no evidence linking Trepanier to the
shootings. He said Trepanier confessed to a friend because he was a
``jokester, a prankster'' and wanted to get attention.
   Prosecutor Eva Marie Mancuso said Trepanier had committed the
sniper attacks in a reckless manner, and ``reckless is intent to
murder.''
   ``Who picked up the rifle each and every time and looked in the
scope and pulled the trigger and watched the people fall?'' Mancuso
asked the jurors.
   Russell Ducharme II, a high school classmate, faces virtually the
same list of charges and will be tried later.

   The dollar fell in European trading early today
amid uncertainty over the U.S. government's ability to reduce the
nation's budget deficit, traders said. Gold prices rose.
   Dealers said the dollar fell sharply in the first hour of
trading, and its slide triggered further dollar-selling. But they
predicted the currency would soon recover.
   President Bush is to present his fiscal 1990 budget proposals to
Congress later today.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.11 Japanese yen to a closing 129.39 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 128.68 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.8605 West German marks, down from 1.8720
   _1.5821 Swiss francs, down from 1.5916
   _6.3335 French francs, down from 6.3725

   _1,356.50 Italian lire, down from 1,364.25
   _1.1825 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1847
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7536, compared with
$1.7423 late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $394.25 a troy ounce, up
from $390.25 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $394.10.
   In Zurich, the noon bid price was $394, up from $390.85 bid late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose to a closing bid of $395.58,
compared with $395.07 a week ago. Financial markets in Hong Kong

<HEAD>Famed Conductor Asks For Reprieve From Contract Due To Health</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Famed conductor Herbert von Karajan has asked for a
reprieve from his contract with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra
because of failing health, officials said today.
   The 80-year-old conductor wrote Berlin culture authorities that
he is unable to keep up with the pace demanded by his contract and
wants to rest at his home near Salzburg, Austria.
   ``He needs to reduce his workload and has submitted the
recommendations of three doctors to that effect,'' said Ludwig von
Pufendorf, Berlin secretary for cultural affairs.
   Pufendorf said Karajan's request was ``nothing dramatic'' because
the Austrian conductor has been ill for years.
   But with the letter, Karajan conceded for the first time that his
ability to conduct has been affected by a stroke, failing vision,
circulatory problems and at least five operations he has undergone
in the last 12 years.
   Pufendorf said Karajan's obligations with the Berlin Symphony had
been reduced to 6 concerts per year from 12 as earlier was required.
   Karajan has conducted the Berlin Philharmonic since 1954 and
holds the honorary title of lifetime director.
   He is also lifetime director of Vienna's Friends of Music Society
and has regularly conducted the Vienna State Opera and Salzburg and
Lucerne music festivals.
   Karajan underwent a nine-hour operation in 1976 and had surgery
again in 1979. He has been visibly hindered since a 1983 operation
on his spinal column and two later operations to remove tumors.
   He has required a supporting chair behind the conducting pulpit
for more than a year and is reported by orchestra members to be so
far-sighted that he cannot read music anymore and conducts from
memory. He also suffers from a hearing problem.
   Karajan asked in the letter to Berlin cultural affairs senator
Volker Hassemer for a break from his concert duties, noting he
continues to suffer circulatory problems as a result of the stroke
and influenza contracted last year.
   ``Karajan's health is not what it used to be,'' Hassemer said.
   ``His life is a heroic exertion against illness and pain,'' a
Vienna music critic commented.

<HEAD>Asher Edelman's Brother Indicted In Alleged Tax Scam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York financier and a Florida businessman
have been indicted for allegedly faking more than $38 billion in
trades in U.S. government securities in a massive tax fraud scheme.
   ``There were no real transactions. It was all pieces of paper
going back and forth,'' U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said Wednesday.
``It was an entirely fictitious operation.''
   Romano said the case, which allegedly involved $511 million in
illegal tax writeoffs, was at least as large as any previous case of
its type.
   Jon Edelman, 43, of Rye, N.Y., and Bernhard F. Manko, 48, of
Lighthouse Point, Fla., were charged with conspiracy to defraud the
Internal Revenue Service and numerous counts of making false
statements to the IRS or aiding others to do so.
   Edelman, the brother of prominent takeover strategist Asher
Edelman, issued a statement calling the charges ``unfounded, unfair
and unjust.'' ``I am confident that I will be completely vindicated
by the jury that will hear my case,'' he said.
   Manko's lawyer, Pamela Rogers Chepiga, said she hadn't yet
reviewed the indictment but ``based on what has come to our
attention during this long investigation, we believe Mr. Manko will
be entirely vindicated.''
   The investors were unwitting participants in the scheme and
aren't under investigation, Romano said, although ``they may have to
undergo civil audits'' to determine whether they owe back taxes.
   The investors include billionaire John Kluge, the chairman of
Metromedia Co.
   Kevin O'Brien, an attorney for Kluge, confirmed his client and
Kluge's wife, Patricia, had invested in two Edelman-Manko
partnerships. He said IRS audits of the partnerships ``have been
going on for years'' and that a settlement with all the partners to
cover back taxes was being implemented.
   Among other investors listed in the indictment was a Perry Ellis.
Prosecutors would not confirm if it was the late fashion designer,
and calls to a spokesman for Ellis's company were not returned.
   Asher Edelman was not implicated in the alleged scheme. Through a
spokeswoman, Maureen Connelly, he issued a statement: ``This is a
distressing and difficult time for our family. I will do everything
in my power to assist my brother because I do not believe he would
engage in any unlawful activity.''
   Jon Edelman and Manko were accused of creating more than $38
billion in ``pre-arranged, rigged and fraudulent'' transactions in
government securities to generate losses for investors in numerous
limited partnerships, which the investors could write off against
their taxes. The scheme involved at least 15 partnerships between
1982 and 1986, the indictment charges.
   Both Manko and Edelman were charged with conspiracy, which
carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   Manko was charged with 24 false statement counts and Edelman was
charged with 25 similar counts, each of which carries up to three
years in prison and a $5,000 fine.
   The pair also was accused of creating false trading and financing
confirmations, causing the distribution of fraudulent sales
literature and misleading lawyers who prepared offering materials
and signed tax opinion letters for some of the limited partnerships.

<TEXT>
   Coal miners at Poland's largest power plant
suspended a three-day strike today and Lech Walesa appealed to
workers not to strike while he tries to negotiate Solidarity's
reinstatement.
   ``Give a chance to the round table,'' The chairman of the free
trade union movement said in an interview on state radio just hours
after the miners ended the stoppage that had threatened to shut down
the Belchatow plant's generators.
   ``Lech Walesa is appealing for a chance for the round table. We
have been waiting for so many years, we can wait a few days more,''
he said.
   Walesa had dispatched an envoy to help settle the dispute.
   He joined a working group on trade union issues that began talks
today as part of historic ``round table'' talks between the
opposition and government that opened Monday and are expected to
last up to six weeks.
   ``Belchatow is just another proof that we should reach agreement
on the most important things as soon as possible, and restore the
organization called Solidarity,'' Walesa said in the radio interview.
   The decision to suspend the strike at Belchatow until Feb. 28
followed a visit to the mine 90 miles southwest of Warsaw by an
envoy for Walesa and management's agreement to provide most of the
pay raise sought by strikers, state radio reported.
   The strike had reduced coal supplies at Belchatow to about two
days' reserves. The strip mine at the complex fuels the plant's
generators, which produce one-fifth of Poland's electricity.
   State radio said management raised pay by $41 a month, compared
to the $59 monthly raise sought by the 4,000 strikers. On average,
workers at the plant earn $145 monthly.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban had on Wednesday had accused
Walesa's envoy, Aloyzy Pietrzyk, of encouraging the strike at a
rally attended by thousands of workers rather than trying to ease it.
   ``I must express decisive anxiety for the sense of the round
table talks and chances for agreement. Agreement is not possible
under strike pressure,'' Urban said.
   Today's working group was co-chaired by Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a top
Solidarity adviser, Romuald Sosnowski, deputy chairman of the
official trade union alliance OPZZ and Aleksander Kwasniewski,
minister of sports and tourism.
   Solidarity hopes the negotiations will culminate in the
restoration of its legal status after a seven-year ban. The
government seeks to persuade its leaders to join parliament as a
minority party.
   The Polish economy, beset by a $39 billion foreign debt, is in
ruins.
   There are chronic shortages of basic goods and supplies,
inflation was at 60 percent last year, and the declining value of
real wages has produced increased worker unrest, including 39
strikes last month.
   Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszcak first proposed the
negotiations in August during the country's worst labor unrest since
the authorities crushed Solidarity in a December 1981 military
crackdown. The only independent labor movement ever allowed in the
Soviet bloc was outlawed the following year.
   The government has sought the promise of a two-year strike
moratorium in return for reinstatement of Solidarity. But Walesa,
while acknowledging that strikes don't help the economy, insists
that workers have the right to strike over poor pay and working
conditions.
   He has repeatedly warned Communist authorities of the potential
of further unrest if economic and politial reforms are not
implemented quickly.
   State television said 4,000 of the 12,500 workers at the
Belchatow plant were on strike. The Solidarity Information Service
in Warsaw put the number at 8,000.
   Signs of labor tension appeared elsewhere in the country today.
Workers at the coke department of the Nowa Huta steel mill near
Krakow have been refusing since Feb. 1 to work overtime, Solidarity
spokesmen reported. Last year, riot police broke up a strike at the
plant, Poland's largest steel mill.
   Walesa was planning to travel to Krakow later today to talk with
workers from Nowa Huta.

<TEXT>
   A Harvard MBA accused of bilking her employer of
$44,000 in moving expenses hired a thug to break her lawyer's leg
with a baseball bat because she didn't like his handling of the
case, prosecutors charged.
   Marsha L. Allen, 36, of South Orange, N.J., pleaded innocent
Wednesday to assault and conspiracy charges in the attack. She was
jailed on $100,000 bail.
   Ms. Allen is accused of paying $500 to a hit man to attack her
lawyer, O.T. Wells in 1987. The assault on the street put Wells in
the hospital for four days with a broken shin and caused a mistrial
in the larceny case.
   A second mistrial was declared Tuesday when her new lawyer, C.
Vernon Mason, learned of the attack and withdrew from the case.
   Ms. Allen, a Harvard Business School graduate, was charged with
grand larceny and forgery for billing Equitable Life Assurance Co.
for $44,000 in moving expenses that had already been paid by her
previous employer, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph.
   On the eve of jury selection in the case, she complained about
the quality of Wells' legal representation, but the judge proceeded
with the trial. Prosecutors had nearly rested their case when the
bat attack occurred.
   Authorities refused to say whether the attacker had been caught
or whether he had become a witness against Ms. Allen.
   If convicted in the larceny case, she could receive up to 2 1@3
to seven years in prison. The assault and conspiracy charges carry a
maximum of five to 15 years.
   Wells, 57, said Wednesday he was shocked to hear of Ms. Allen's
indictment. ``As a defense lawyer,'' he said, ``I'm outraged.''

   Thursday's Child, a sloop on pace to smash
the 135-year New York-San Francisco sailing record, did not have far
to go as it entered waters off Southern California today.
   The modern three-man, 60-foot racing yacht was seeking to beat
the record of 89 days and eight hours for the 14,500-mile journey
around treacherous Cape Horn at the tip of South America. Set in
1854 by the legendary three-masted clipper ship Flying Cloud, it is
the oldest existing speed record.
   Thursday's Child was expected to reach the latitude of San Diego
early today and was on target to enter San Francisco's Golden Gate
on Friday ``or Saturday morning at the latest,'' spokesman Tony Lush
said Wednesday after a radio conference with the crew.
   The vessel left New York Nov. 23 and must reach San Francisco by
2 a.m. PST on Feb. 21 to break the record. A Friday arrival would do
that by 10 days.
   The race is against what was called ``the liveliest creation of
man,'' a clipper ship praised in its day as a thing ``of satisfying
beauty ... absolutely fitted for the purpose it is designed to
fill.''
   The 225-foot Flying Cloud required 100 men to hoist 35 sails up
its masts. Thursday's Child is 165 feet shorter and has only two
sails, but it boasts the latest in push-button satellite navigation
equipment.
   Courtney Hazelton, 32, a professional sailor, is its skipper.
Owner-master Warren Luhrs, 44, and Lars Bergstrom, 54, who helped
design the boat, also are aboard.
   Lush said all were in good health with adequate water and food
supplies.
   Even a five-day interruption at the Falkland Islands in the South
Atlantic to repair damage from a below-waterline collision with an
unknown object failed to knock the vessel off record pace.
   The boat was enjoying unusual southeasterly winds of up to nearly
30 mph, according to weather forecaster Sharon Alden. She estimated
the favorable winds would persist at least another day.
   The prevailing wind along the West Coast is from the northwest,
which slows northbound sailboats.
   The Flying Cloud was one of the class of clipper ships whose
development was spurred by the California and Australian gold rushes
and the China tea trade. Their nickname is believed to derive from
the phrase ``going at a clip.''
   Five other sailboats have been sunk since 1982 while trying to
navigate the chaotic waters and stiff winds at the tip of South
America.

   It didn't look like happy trails for CBS, but
``Lonesome Dove'' has ridden to the rescue.
   The success of CBS' four-night Western has not only boosted
morale at the third-place network, but sent audience shares of CBS,
ABC and NBC soaring into the 80s in a season that has been averaging
percentages in the 60s.
   On his CBS talk show Tuesday, Pat Sajak told his audience they
might find it a little warmer than previously.
   ``With the success of `Lonesome Dove,''' he said, ``CBS has
turned the heat back on in the studio.''
   ``Lonesome Dove'' has more than met CBS' guarantee to
advertisers. Televisions in an estimated 25.7 million homes were
tuned to CBS for the series' first installment.
   Instead of the less-than-30 share the network expected, the
miniseries is headed for an average share closer to 40. The share is
a percentage of televisions in use.
   ``It's performing significantly better than we anticipated,
though obviously we had great hopes for it because of the quality,''
said David Poltrack, CBS' vice president for marketing. ``The recent
patterns of television viewing would create a healthy skepticism in
terms of response, and we're very pleased.''
   The audience reception shows that networks can still put on good
programs and people will watch.
   ``Lonesome Dove,'' Tom Shales of The Washington Post enthused,
``is enough to give one new respect for the miniseries, new respect
for Texas, new respect for CBS, and even new respect for television.
There is almost never anything this good on network TV.''
   ``It is the best Western ever on the small screen,'' wrote Art
Chapman of the Fort Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram. ``It is the best
miniseries we have seen in 10 years. And it is the best overall show
of the last few seasons.''
   The four-part series that concluded Wednesday night is based on
Larry McMurtry's 1985, Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name.
   The tale of life, death and love on a Texas-to-Montana cattle
drive had an all-star cast, including Oscar winners Robert Duvall
(``Tender Mercies'') and Anjelica Huston (``Prizzi's Honor''); Emmy
winner Tommy Lee Jones (``Executioner's Song''), Diane Lane, Robert
Urich, Ricky Schroder, Danny Glover, D.B. Sweeney, Chris Cooper and
Glenne Headly.
   ``What it tells you is basically that quality will bring out
audiences,'' said Poltrack. ``Now on the other hand, you don't run
out and make 10 miniseries based on this, because you have to
realize you're dealing with Pulitzer Prize-winning book, an
extraordinary production, extraordinary acting. ``I think the Robert
Duvall performance will go down in history as one of the great
television performances of all time. When you have that kind of
combination you're going to be successful.''
   Alan Wurtzel, ABC's vice president for research, said: ``I would
say it's a little dangerous to draw any conclusions about the future
of either Westerns on television or the future of the long
miniseries on television, based on one case. ... I think if there's
nothing else you learn in television it's that there's always the
exception to the rule.''
   Last season, the networks began fretting about the loss of
viewers to cable options and videocassettes. The slide stopped, at
least for this week.
   Sunday night's premiere of ``Lonesome Dove'' had a 28.5 rating
and a 42 share and was the highest-rated show of the week, according
to the A.C. Nielsen Co., whose weekly ratings compilations run
Mondays through Sundays. Each rating point represents 904,000 U.S.
homes with televisions. Monday and Tuesday's installments drew a 37
share each.
   ABC and NBC might be losing the time period to ``Lonesome Dove,''
but the competition is not doing badly, and a hit for one is
ultimately good for all three networks.
   ``It's always been my contention, as far as the network business
is concerned, three healthy networks are really preferable. I would
just like to be the healthiest of the three, but it's really to no
one's advantage to have one or two networks not performing well,''
said Wurtzel.
   Poor programming on any network chases viewers to cable and video
alternatives, he said.
   But there's also a sense of tipping the hat when a competitor
comes up with something really special. ``Lonesome Dove,'' Wurtzel
said, ``is an excellent, very, very well-done show, and I think it
deserves to get viewers.''

<HEAD>Soviet Magazine Criticizes Communist Party, Gorbachev</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Leningrad magazine has published a daring attack
on the Soviet Communist Party, including unusually pointed criticism
of the way President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is running the country.
   Sergei Y. Andreyev, the author of the essay in the January
edition of Neva, said Gorbachev's reforms have failed to solve the
Soviet economic crisis.
   The article is one of the harshest and most detailed attacks yet
on the Communist system, Gorbachev and ``perestroika,'' his reform
program.
   Andreyev said in the literary and political magazine that
Gorbachev's reforms are seriously hampered by what he called a ``new
class.''
   ``All decisions of the upper powers are carried out only to the
extent that they are advantageous to the new class,'' Andreyev said
in the 28-page essay.
   He said the new class is a ``production and managerial
apparatus'' that includes 14 million party bureaucrats, government
ministers and managers.
   Andreyev's use of the term ``new class'' appeared to be a
reference to Milovan Djilas' book ``The New Class,'' which
criticized the Communist system.
   The Yugoslav politican and writer, who broke with Yugoslavia's
leadership, said in the 1957 book that the Communist system had
produced a new class of privileged leaders instead of a classless
society.
   Gorbachev himself has launched a war on bureaucrats who interfere
in day-to-day decisions about production, and he has tried to
transfer some of their power to local officials and factory managers.
   But Andreyev said Gorbachev hasn't gone far enough and that the
government and party have become subservient to the new class.
   Andreyev, 34, is a biologist and plant director who said he
represents a new political club called ``Alternative.'' His article
mocks the party's claim of popular support and uses the colloquial
``gensec'' as an abbreviation for general secretary, Gorbachev's
post in the party.
   The new class, he wrote, is largely responsible for the lack of
major improvements in the Soviet economy and for impediments to
democracy that have arisen since Gorbachev came to power in March
1985 and the next month launched his perestroika program.
   ``We must admit the economy is in a crisis. ... For the years
since the memorable April plenum of the Communist Party Central
Committee, the economy didn't get on track. ... The crisis, in this
way, is deepening,'' he said.
   Perestroika is moving slowly not because of some mysterious
forces, but because of ``well-organized sabotage,'' he said.
   Gorbachev has acknowledged that perestroika is not moving as
quickly as he had hoped, but he has reaffirmed his commitment to
reform and said the people support his reforms.
   Andreyev, however, said the current leadership is partly to blame
for the country's economic woes. ``The good promises made from high
rostrums hang in the air and are far from fostering the
strengthening of faith in the possibility of perestroika,'' he said.
   The article also criticized Gorbachev's political reforms under
which a new more powerful legislature and presidency are to be
created this year.
   Andreyev said the offices of Communist Party general secretary
and president _ or head of the legislature _ should not be held by
the same man, as Gorbachev proposes, because the lawmakers are
supposed to check his work.
   Andreyev also said Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or
openness on some issues, has not yet been expanded to include
criticism of the country's leader. The general secretary, he said,
is still viewed as ``an inaccessible and exemplary figure'' and that
feedback from the people he governs is essential.

   A giant pressure cooker used for curing
parts at an aerospace plant exploded and blew its 14,000-pound lid
through the roof, killing a worker, authorities said.
   Three other people in the Kaiser Space Products building escaped
injury in the explosion Wednesday, said Kaiser President Bill Sidney.
   The victim, Robert Renkemeyer, 66, of Pensacola, Fla., was
standing near the hydroclave, a steam-driven kettle, when it blew
up, Sidney said.
   Renkemeyer, an equipment consultant, was a representative of the
company that built the device.
   ``It was the first time we ran it (the hydroclave) at full
pressure,'' Sidney said.
   The lid landed in a parking lot 50 or 60 feet away, Fire
Department spokesman Charlie Stimmel said. Two walls of the building
also were blown out.
   The plant supplies rocket nozzles to NASA, the Air Force and
private satellite operations.

   Environmentalists trying to protect the
northern spotted owl cheered a federal judge's decision halting
logging on five timber tracts.
   ``This is a temporary reprieve only, but a significant first step
toward saving these ancient forest treasures,'' said Vic Sher, a
lawyer with the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund.
   U.S. District Judge Helen Frye issued a temporary restraining
order Wednesday that halts logging on five Bureau of Land Management
sites in Oregon. The judge cited the potential for irreparable harm
to the environment and scheduled another hearing on the matter for
Feb. 17.
   The order came in response to a motion filed Tuesday by
conservation groups battling plans to log old-growth forests near
spotted owl nests.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is being challenged in court
over its refusal to list the owl as a threatened or endangered
species.
   Bob Rivers, acting BLM state director, said bureau officials were
instructed to notify the timber companies to cease operations as
soon as possible.
   Wendell Wood, a spokesman for the Oregon Natural Resources
Council, said one timber company spent the weekend working in
subzero weather to log 40 percent of the one of the areas.
   Wood, whose group is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit,
charged that the bureau, in selling logging rights to the property,
had acted ``in reckless disregard for the spotted owl'' and was
promoting ``chainsaw justice.''
   Rivers declined to comment on Wood's remarks.

   Jewish settlers stoned Palestinian cars in the
West Bank and reportedly fired guns in the air after an Israeli
settler burned to death. Authorities had said he died in a firebomb
attack, but today they expressed doubts.
   Palestinians closed shops and businesses on the second day of a
general strike marking the beginning of the 15th month of the
uprising against Israeli occupation.
   The strike came after a day of widespread violence that claimed
the lives of up to six Palestinians, including two in a prison riot.
   Arab reports today said Nidal Zuhdi Deeb, 17, became the second
inmate to die as a result of wounds sustained when troops opened
fire to quell the riot at Megiddo prison in northern Israel on
Wednesday. Another prisoner died Wednesday.
   Also Wednesday, settler Albert Gerassi, 38, died when his car
went up in flames near the West Bank settlement of Alfei Menashe, 10
miles northeast of Tel Aviv. News of his death caused angry
reactions Jewish settlers.
   Settlers from nearby Ariel flocked to the main road and stoned
Arab-owned cars, distinguishable by blue license plates. Others
hurled rocks at houses and fired guns in the air.
   Israel radio said several cars were damaged and a Palestinian
couple was injured when their vehicle was forced off the road into a
ditch.
   ``If there is no change, they (Arabs) must understand that there
may be a Jewish uprising as well,'' said Meir Indor, a spokesman for
the Jewish settler's council. ``We can also throw firebombs into
civilian cars.''
   But the army and police said today investigators found no glass
fragments or other evidence of a firebomb. ``We were looking for
remains (of a firebomb), and we didn't find any, and there are
doubts,'' said an army official.
   The daily Davar newspaper said the incident raised suspicions
Palestinians were using a new method of attack. Other newspapers
said the fire may have been started by a short circuit.
   At Alfei Menashe, settlers held a stormy meeting Wednesday night
with the army's West Bank commander, Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna.
   ``You simply have to resign,'' shouted one settler amid loud
cheers.
   About 70,000 Jewish settlers live in the West Bank, along with
about 850,000 Palestinians.
   Fifteen Israelis have died in previous violence during the
Palestinian uprising which began on Dec. 8, 1987. The Palestinian
death toll is 379.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir chastized settlers for their
actions.
   ``This encourages them (Palestinians) to continue and increase
their attacks because they see their enemies getting angry and
appearing to lose their equilibrium,'' he said on Israel army radio.
   In Nablus, hospital officials said 8-year-old Mohammed Talal
Bisharat died today of head injuries suffered last weekend in an
explosion. Relatives said he and another youth were injured when an
explosive object was hurled at them from a military jeep in Froush
Beit Dejan. His 13-year-old cousin, Anwar Bisharat, was injured in
the incident.
   The army said the youth apparently played with something that
exploded. A spokeswoman rejected the claim the object was thrown
from an army jeep.
   ``No Israeli soldiers were in the area. It is has nothing to do
with Israeli soldiers,'' she said.
   Hospital officials said five Palestinians died Wednesday, three
shot in clashes with the army in the West Bank, one in a prison riot
in Israel and another as the result of wounds received earlier this
week in Gaza. The army confirmed four died.

   A gunman firing from a
motorcycle shot to death a Roman Catholic pedestrian today, police
said, near a central Belfast square notorious for sectarian killings.
   Two helmeted men rode up to 33-year-old Tony Fusco in a street
off Smithfield Square, and one of them fired several shots from
close range, said police Sgt. Michael Glover.
   Fusco lived in the Falls, a Catholic district in west Belfast,
and police found a motorbike apparently abandoned by the assailants
in the adjoining Shankill, a Protestant district.
   Fusco had no connection with the security forces and his killing
bore the hallmarks of a sectarian attack, Glover said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility.
   On Jan. 18, two masked gunmen killed a Roman Catholic worker in a
store in Smithfield Market near the Protestant and Catholic enclaves
of west Belfast.
   More than 2,700 people have been killed in nearly 20 years of
political and sectarian violence in the British-ruled province.
   The Irish Republican Army is fighting to end British rule and
unite the province with the Irish Republic.

<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man has been convicted of murdering and
robbing a pregnant woman who gave birth to a brain-damaged girl by
Caesarean section moments before dying.
   A jury deliberated less than four hours before convicting Charles
Kenneth McCovey, 44, of second-degree murder and aggravated robbery
for shooting Anna Holmes in front of her three children last April.
   Mrs. Holmes, 31, who was eight months pregnant, had gone to a
video store with her three children to select videos for a pajama
party.
   She died moments after doctors delivered her daughter by
Caesarean section about an hour after the shooting.
   The child suffered brain damage because of her mother's injuries,
a fact that was kept from the jury by 3rd District Judge Raymond Uno.
   McCovey, who admitted using alcohol and amphetamines at the time
of the crime but said he didn't intend to kill Mrs. Holmes, cried
after the verdict.
   ``I thought the jury would believe his version of what happened
because it was true,'' defense attorney Andy Valdez said. ``I think
Chuck had more confidence than we did.''
   Deputy Salt Lake County Attorney Tom Vuyk, who had sought a
first-degree mu, said, ``The
jury has spoken and we accept their verdict.''
   Valdez said he was relieved by the verdict and had been worried
by publicity over the Florida execution of Ted Bundy and a recent
Utah Supreme Court ruling upholding a death sentence against another
of his client's, Ronnie Lee Gardner.
   ``The last first-degree homicide trial I had, I lost, and my
client is on death row. So this is a great relief,'' he said.
   In closing arguments, Vuyk said that McCovey intended to kill
Mrs. Holmes.
   ``He placed a gun _ a .38-caliber pistol _ to the back of her
head and pulled the trigger ... that bullet entered her skull
because he pulled the trigger,'' Vuyk said. He also recounted that
the victim's then 11-year-old daughMcCovey say ``that'll take care of her''
or ``that's the end
of her'' after her mother was shot.
   Valdez said McCovey had no reason to kill the woman and had
insisted his gun discharged accidentally.
   ``He's living his own self-imposed sentence, ladies and
gentleman. He didn't intend to kill her,'' he said.
   Sentencing was set for March 13. McCovey faces a maximum sentence
of five years to life on each conviction.

<HEAD>N.H. Supreme Court to Rule on Belching</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New Hampshire Supreme Court is being
asked to decide when a burp is intentional and willful, especially
when it wrecks the results of a blood-alcohol test given to a
suspected drunken driver.
   James Jordan, whose two burps during a Breathalyzer test in April
cost him his license for three months, maintains he didn't mean to
belch and even tried to hold back.
   Breathalyzer results are skewed by burping, which contaminates
the mouth with alcohol from the stomach.
   Jordan's lawyer, James Sayer, argued Wednesday that police
applied a subjective standard in finding that Jordan was trying to
ruin the test results and had no right to take his license.
   Assistant Attorney General Stephen Judge agreed that no criteria
exists to determine whether belching is willful but that evidence
supported the police.
   When Jordan was brought to the police station, he burped. Police
told him he would have to wait 20 minutes, warning that any further
burping would be considered a test refusal and result in suspension
of his license.
   Jordan burped again.

<HEAD>Cambodian Resistance Leaders Offer Peace Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian resistance leaders today called for the
reconciliation of the warring factions of Cambodia in a peace plan
they said would keep the Khmer Rouge from returning to power.
   A Cambodian resistance official said he hoped the infamous Khmer
Rouge leader, Pol Pot, would have no part in a future Cambodian
government.
   Under the proposal, 2,000 United Nations personnel would
supervise the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, who have occupied
Cambodia since they invaded the Southeast Asian country in 1978.
   Troops from the United Nations Peacekeeping Force also would be
stationed in Cambodia after the Vietnamese left to keep the Khmer
Rouge from monopolizing power, prevent a civil war and protect
Cambodia from the possibility of another Vietnamese invasion.
   The leaders also called for establishment of a provisional
government during the withdrawal that would include the three
resistance factions and the Vietnamese-backed government.
   An army made up of 10,000 men from each Cambodian faction also
would be formed. Any group with more than 10,000 men would be forced
to demoblize them. General elections would follow.
   The plan was presented by Khieu Samphan, acting head of the Khmer
Rouge and vice president of the resistance coalition; Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, son of resistance leader and former Cambodian king Prince
Norodom Sihanouk; and Son Soubert, son of guerrilla leader Son Sann.
They appeared at a packed news conference in Sihanouk's residence in
Beijing.
   Sihanouk, who is in Beijing, did not take part.
   ``We do not want a bad peace in Cambodia, we do not want to be
another Lebanon,'' said Ranariddh. ``Without national
reconciliation, we have no hope in our country.''
   Khieu Samphan said the proposal differed from an earlier plan put
forward by Sihanouk in that it attempted to address Vietnamese
concerns about a return to power of the Khmer Rouge after Vietnam
withdraws its troops.
   Vietnam also rejected the earlier plan because it said the
proposal would result in civil war in Cambodia.
   ``Under the new plan, those obstacles have been removed,'' said
Khieu Samphan. ``Now let us see if Vietnam really has the intention
of pursuing a political settlement.''
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 and toppled the
pro-Chinese Khmer Rouge, who killed hundreds of thousands of people
in a three-year reign.
   But faced with a worsening economy and pressure from its backer,
the Soviet Union, Vietnam says it will withdraw its troops from
Cambodia by September, provided the four warring parties can arrive
at a political settlement.
   Hanoi says 50,000 troops remain in Cambodia. American officials
put the number much higher.
   China also has given in to Soviet pressure to talk to the
Vietnamese.
   Last month in Beijing, in their first negotiations since 1979,
China and Vietnam agreed that China, the major backer of the
resistance coalition, would cut its aid to the guerrilla factions as
Vietnamese forces returned home.
   Last week, the Chinese and Soviet foreign ministers discussed the
Cambodian conflict for the second time in two months.
   They agreed that Vietnam's withdrawal must be supervised by an
international agency but failed to agree on the nature of the
supervision or on the make-up of a coalition government during the
Vietnamese withdrawal. They also set May 15-18 as the dates for the
first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years.
   Tosay's proposal will be discussed during a second round of
informal peace talks with Vietnam in Jakarta, Indonesia, beginning
Feb. 19.
   The first round was held last summer.
   Ranariddh said today he opposed the return to power of Pol Pot,
whose measures to establish radical agrarian communism resulted in
massive killings.
   ``If I had to vote for Mr. Pol Pot, it would of course be
`nyet,''' he said. ``But we feel the Cambodian people should be
allowed to decide.''
   He denied charges that the resistance coalition was delaying
peace in Cambodia. ``How could we as victims be obstacles to
peace?'' he asked.

   Republicans rallied today to defend Defense
Secretary-designate John Tower, whose confirmation vote has been
delayed while the FBI investigates allegations about his drinking
and his financial ties with military contractors.
   ``For those who have known him for a very long time, it's very
significant that they have never seen him incapacitated, never seen
him drunk,'' Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., a member of the Senate
Armed Services Committee that is considering the nomination, said on
NBC's ``Today'' show.
   ``And indeed neither have all the waiters who have been
interviewed in response to all of the many flake allegations that
have been thrown in over the transom,'' Wilson said.
   He said he has reviewed ``as much of the FBI files as are
available to date and there is nothing in there that in any way
shakes my complete confidence that John Tower is the smart, tough
secretary of defense that we need.''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said of the nomination
on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that ``I don't think it's in a bit
of trouble. I think that these rumors are going to be checked out,
as they should be. They're going to be proved false and we'll
confirm John Tower, hopefully in the next couple of weeks.''
   ``The experience of people, including the chairman of that (Armed
Services) committee, have been that they have never seen John Tower
impaired because of drinking. ... They have never seen him drunk,
they have never seen him unable to perform duty, never seen him fail
to show up for an appointment,'' Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., said
on ``CBS This Morning.''
   The committee chairman, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said Wednesday
following a meeting with White House counsel C. Boyden Gray that he
still had ``serious concerns'' that would prevent him at this point
from voting in favor of Tower's nomination.
   ``Each of the charges that have been leveled against him and
investigated subsequently have all proved groundless, baseless,''
Wallop said.
   But Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., appearing with Wallop, noted
that the White House asked that the vote be put off until the FBI
completed its investigation.
   Wirth said ``to suggest that there are a whole lot of just silly
accusations ... simply is not the information that we're getting
from the White House. ... Clearly they must believe that there is
something in these reports or they would not have asked us to put
off the vote.''
   Nunn and Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on
the Armed Services Committee met for two hours Wednesday afternoon
with Gray to discuss the FBI investigations and then closeted
themselves with Tower for 90 minutes.
   The Washington Post today quoted an unnamed administration source
as saying Tower presented the lawmakers with statements from his
doctors that he does not have a disabling alcohol problem.
   President Bush, meantime, stood by his nomination of the former
Texas senator to head the Pentagon.
   ``If somebody has something other than rumor and frenzied
speculation, please get it to the FBI or get it to the White House
staff, or certainly get it to the committee in the Senate. But let
us be fair enough that we do not deal in rumor after rumor,'' Bush
said Wednesday.
   Nunn said ``there are still some matters yet to be received'' in
an FBI review of allegations that Tower is a heavy drinker and
womanizer.
   A separate FBI review of ``new allegations of a financial nature
... will take another week or 10 days'' to complete, Nunn said,
adding that it ``has to be completed before the committee can
proceed to a vote.''
   The Senate begins a week-long recess on Friday, meaning the
committee could not vote before Feb. 21 to reject the nomination or
send it to the full chamber.
   A Republican on the committee, John McCain of Arizona, said the
new allegations linked Tower to a Pentagon purchasing fraud
investigation known as ``Ill Wind,'' which has centered on payments
by defense contractors for classified information on lucrative
military contracts.
   ``It has to do with this procurement scandal, the `Ill Wind'
thing,'' said McCain.
   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the
main new allegation ``relates to Senator Tower's activities while he
was in the Senate,'' but did not elaborate.
   Another administration official said the FBI background inquiry
focused on contributions to one of Tower's Senate campaigns by a
contractor now under investigation in the Pentagon purchasing fraud
investigation.
   But the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, emphasized
that the FBI had found no evidence of wrongdoing by Tower and said
politicians can't control who gives money to their campaigns.
   During four days of testimony before the committee, Tower denied
any financial wrongdoing. But Nunn and other senators have voiced
concern whether Tower could avoid conflicts of interests after
receiving more than $1 million as a consultant for major defense
contractors since he left the Senate four years ago.
   The administration had been pushing for a vote this week, but
dropped that after Nunn and Warner met Tuesday night with Bush.
   Nunn said he ``told the president frankly that I have serious
concerns, and I also stated that if a vote was held immediately as
some have urged, I would vote no because of these concerns.''
   The chairman said he had not polled the committee, but the
second-ranking Democrat on the panel, Sen. James Exon of Nebraska,
said he agreed with Nunn. Wirth, too, said he could not vote at this
time to approve Tower.

   The slaying of an army captain
led to a clash between government troops and Moslem radicals in
which as many as 100 extremists were killed, civilian sources said
today.
   The soldiers and the radicals, who were armed with spears and
arrows, fought Monday in Talangsari, a southern Sumatra village,
according to Maj. Gen. Sunardi, chief of the south Sumatra regional
military command.
   In the first report on the fighting, Sunardi said the battle
occurred follwing an attempt by the military to free army Capt.
Sutiman. The general said the extremists had taken the officer
hostage and later killed him.
   However, civilian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the army captain was killed in a clash with the extremists
earlier Monday.
   They said Sutiman and other army commanders were attacked by the
rebels when they came to meet with the extremists, who held a rally
Sunday. They said the military reinforcements attacked later Monday
in retaliation.
   Sunardi said the radicals battled with spears and bows and
arrows. The civilian sources said the battle involved about 300
members of the radical group in the village, including women and
children.
   At least 27 radicals were killed, Sunardi said. The civilian
sources put the death toll at more than 100 and said two of the dead
were soldiers.
   The civilian sources said about 55 extremists also surrendered to
soldiers, who razed four buildings used as the headquarters of the
radical group, known as the Fisabillilah Mujahedeen Command.
   Most of the radicals fled into the jungle, Sunardi said.
   He said the military officer was seized by the radicals when he
went to the area Sunday to investigate reports of an ``Islamic
deviationist group.''
   Sunardi said the movement uses Islam to mislead the people in an
effort to destablize the government.
   In September 1984, 30 Moslem radicals were killed in Jakarta in a
clash with the military.

<TEXT>
   The family of a Navy recruit who panicked
and drowned during rescue training has filed a $20 million claim
against the Navy.
   The death in March of Lee Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis., led to
charges against instructors and reform of training practices at the
Navy Rescue Swimmer School here.
   The claim accuses the Navy of negligence in allowing Mirecki back
into the class after he had been diagnosed as having a phobia about
being held under water. It also charges the Navy of intentionally
inflicting emotional distress on the family by first reporting that
Mirecki's death was an accident.
   The family, dissatisfied with the initial report, got help from
congressmen in getting an investigation that led to charges.
   Ross Goodman, an attorney for Mirecki's family, said the claim
was sent Wednesday to the commander of the Naval Air Station in
Pensacola. He said the Navy has six months to respond. If it does
not respond, the family can file a lawsuit, he said.
   Cmdr. Dennis Hessler said the claim would be forwarded to the
Navy legal services office on the base. He would not comment further.
   Witnesses said Mirecki, who had a phobia about being held under
water, was dragged back in despite his pleas to quit the training. A
pathologist concluded that he was literally scared to death,
suffering heart failure and drowning.
   An instructor was convicted by court-martial of negligent
homicide. Four other instructors received administrative punishments
of fines or demotions. The officer in charge was acquitted of
dereliction of duty.
   As a result of the case, instructors are no longer allowed to
come into physical contact with students and must immediately cease
drilling trainees who panic, ask to quit or show signs of excessive
fatigue, the Navy said.

<TEXT>
   A company sold state agencies more
than $300,000 worth of meat mixed with pet food, beef lungs, chicken
necks and other illegal additives, Missouri's attorney general
charges in a lawsuit.
   ``When you read through this, it is frankly a modern-day horror
story,'' William Webster said of the suit seeking $800,000 in
damages from West Meat Co. of St. Louis. The suit was filed
Wednesday in state court.
   West Meat has had contracts with more than 25 state facilities,
including hospitals, prisons, the Highway Patrol Academy and the
Missouri School for the Blind.
   Webster said he had no reports of health problems related to the
allegedly tainted meat. He said the state stopped using the meat in
October and forced West Meat to pick up more than 60,000 pounds
already shipped.
   ``Between February 1986 and October 1988, the state paid West
Meat Co. more than $300,000 for meat products we believe may well
have been adulterated,'' Webster said.
   The suit said the company added pet food, spoiled meat, beef
blood, suet, beef lungs, chicken necks, kidneys, adrenal and
salivary glands, and deer and chicken meat to ground beef, pork
sausage and Polish sausage.
   ``The federal government does not allow any of these elements to
be mixed with the meat products shipped to the state,'' Webster
said. ``And the state contract is specific in its requirement for
ground beef to be 80 percent lean and 20 percent fat, with nothing
added.''
   A lawyer for the company, John Kilo, had no immediate comment
today.
   The suit charges the company, its president, Joseph A. West, and
a plant manager with fraud, violations of merchandising laws and
breach of contract.
   ``We're not alleging health and safety problems, although I'm
sure that's why the (U.S. Department of Agriculture) has these
standards,'' Webster said.
   Webster said the suit would not stop USDA from taking legal
action against the company.

   Ronald H. Brown, preparing to take over as
Democratic Party chairman, told party officials today they face
``tough adversaries'' and must work to define party positions more
forcefully on issues such as defense, crime and drugs.
   Brown, who will become the first black to chair a major political
party, told the Association of State Democratic Chairs, ``I am going
to be a common-sense, pragmatic chairman.''
   He told the state party leaders, ``We've got a difficult job
ahead, we've got tough adversaries. ...They don't care much about
truth or about decency.''
   Taking over amid concern about erosion of the party's Southern
base, Brown said, ``I don't want to be chairman of a party that
writes off any region of the country.''
   ``We have to be willing to define ourselves as a party,'' he
said. ``You can't possibly win if you let your adversary, your
opponent, define you.''
   Brown said that 30 and 40 years ago ``people could always say
what we stood for and whom we stood with.''
   Citing defense, crime and drugs as issues of primary concern to
voters, Brown said Democrats ``have got to be willing to speak
forcefully on those issues.''
   Ending his four-year term as party chairman, Paul G. Kirk Jr.
told the Democratic executive committee on Wednesday, ``we can't
afford for a moment to write off the South'' and expect to win
presidential elections.
   ``We have had our clock cleaned in the South in the past several
presidential elections,'' he said.
   Pollster Peter Hart told the group that in the 1988 election,
Republican George Bush won all 155 electoral votes in the South
against Democrat Michael Dukakis
   ``You can't start out any game behind 155-0 and be competitive,''
Hart said, blaming the loss in large part on the Democrats'
preference for programs over values.
   Kirk said he believed the South could be won by ``the right
messenger with the right message.''
   Those assessments of the party's failure to attract support in
the South came as the Democrats gathered to elect Ronald H. Brown as
Kirk's successor. Brown will be the first black to be chairman of a
major political party.
   He easily defeated four rivals for the post and will be unopposed
when the Democratic National Committee votes on Friday.
   Despite the ease of Brown's victory in the chairmanship race,
there were lingering questions about the impact his election will
have on the party in the South.
   ``Will it help?'' asked Atlanta-based pollster Claibourne Darden.
``The answer is no. What can Ron Brown do to help the Democratic
Party? Bring the liberal vote to it? It's already there.
   ``Bring the black vote to it? It's already there.''
   Merle Black, professor of political science at the University of
North Carolina, said Republicans would use Brown's election to put
out the message to Southern whites that ``the Democratic Party now
is the party of blacks.''
   Still another analyst of Southern politics, Larry Sabato of the
University of Virginia, said Brown's election could cause problems
for Democrats in the region ``not so much because he's black, but
that he's tied to the twin devils, Ted Kennedy and Jesse Jackson.''
   Brown is a former aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts
and was a top adviser to Jesse Jackson in the closing stages of his
1988 campaign.
   Hart told the Democrats they also must learn to appeal to white
Protestant voters and the middle class. ``We have to be able to talk
to them,'' he said.
   He said white Protestants make up about 48 percent of the
electorate and that the Democratic ticket lost their votes by a 2-1
margin. About 40 percent of the electorate are middle-class voters
and they went Republican by a margin of 55-to-44, Hart said.
   As for the South, Hart said, it wasn't enough for the Democrats
to hold their nominating convention in Atlanta and pick Texas Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen as the vice presidential nominee.
   The Republican ticket prevailed by running on values such as
law-and-order and a strong defense, while the Democrats ran on
programs, he said.
   ``We've got to be able to get from programs to values,'' he said.
   He also said the Democrats tend to ``ignore what we don't do
well'' and for that reason failed to make a strong case for national
defense.

<TEXT>
   Salvage workers today
trudged across a muddy mountainside searching for bodies and clues
to explain why a pilot steered his Boeing 707 straight into the
peak, killing all 144 people aboard.
   At least 90 bodies have been recovered, along with one of the
jet's two flight recorders, said Olivia Baptista, a spokeswoman for
the Vila do Porto town council.
   ``There are no survivors,'' she said in a telephone interview
with the Associated Press in Lisbon. She said 40 to 50 bodies were
found today and 50 were found Wednesday, shortly after the crash.
   The smell of oil hung in the damp air, and a light rain fell on
debris that included playing cards, a book of fairy tales and
vacation clothing, still neatly folded.
   The U.S. charter plane, carrying 137 Italian vacationers and a
seven-member American crew, was preparing for a refueling stop on
Santa Maria island when it slammed into 1,794-foot-high Pico Alto
mountain. It was headed to the Caribbean.
   Civil aviation officials said the 20-year-old jet had a history
of minor service problems.
   Access to the wooded crash site was very difficult, said Jose
Martins Freitas, chief of the Azorean resuce services. ``The ground
is slippery, and it's foggy,'' he said.
   The Italian government sent a plane to the Azores with medical
personnel and firefighters to help salvage efforts, and the Vatican
said today Pope John Paul II issued a message of sympathy for
relatives of victims.
   Witnesses said the plane hit a slope, bounced over a road, lost
an engine and crashed into the mountain. Bodies were spread in an
area with a 1.8-mile radius about 24 miles northeast of the airport.
   Construction worker Jose Barro said he and the village priest,
heard the crash and ran to the site. ``We tried to find someone
alive to get them out,'' he said. ``But we only found dead bodies.''
   Mayor Jose Humberto Chaves of Vila do Porto said the aircraft was
making ``normal maneuvers'' preparing to approach the airport's main
runway but should have been at 3,000 feet and was ``much too low.''
   The jet's pilot had not reported any trouble in a radio
conversation with the airport three minutes before the crash, the
Portuguese news agency LUSA reported. Earlier unconfirmed reports
said the pilot had requested a runway be cleared for an emergency
landing.
   ``The plane was very low, everything seemed perfectly normal,
then it turned and flew straight into the mountain,'' said Manuel
Vairos Figueredo, mayor of the fishing village of Santa Barbara near
the airport.
   ``There was a tremendous explosion. The plane burst into flames
and trees around it caught fire. Nobody could possibly have
survived,'' Vairos Figueredo said.
   Santa Maria is the easternmost of the Azores, a Portuguese
archipelago 750 miles west of Portugal. The crash site is about 8{
miles from Vila do Porto, capital of the 40-square-mile island.
   The jet belonged to Independent Air Corp., a Smyrna, Tenn.-based
company. It said the plane was flying from Bergamo, Italy, to the
Dominican Republic. It was chartered by the Dominican firm Dominair
by six Italian travel agencies.
   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration reported fog in the area
with a visibility of five miles below 500 feet and scattered clouds
at 500 feet.
   The craft was one of two Boeing 707s the company owns, said A.L.
Pittman, president of Independent Air. He said it had 12,500 cycles,
or takeoffs and landings, and fewer than 50,000 hours in the air.
   FAA spokesman Jack Barker said that was not excessive.
   In Seattle, Boeing spokesman Tom Cole said the plane began
service in 1968.
   FAA records show seven service difficulty reports on the plane
over the past six years, agency spokeswoman Bobbie Mardis said.
   She said they dated from January 1983, when a report said the
plane's No. 2 engine was shut down due to turbine failure.
   Several travelers quoted by Italian news media said they had
flown on Independent Air Corp. 707s on previous trips to the
Caribbean and complained about problems with seats, tray tables and
air conditioning in the jets.
   Italian state radio said the tourists aboard the flight paid
``bargain'' prices for the package tour vacation in the Caribbean,
``maybe too cheap.''

<HEAD>Magistrate Declares Union Carbide's Ex-Chief An Absconder</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BHOPAL, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court today declared Warren Anderson, the
former chairman of Union Carbide Corp., an ``absconding offender''
in an effort to extradite him from the United States to face charges
in the Bhopal gas leak.
   Chief Judicial Magistrate R.C. Mishra issued a warrant Nov. 15,
1988 for Anderson's arrest to answer homicide charges filed by the
Indian government.
   Repeated summons have failed to bring Anderson to Bhopal, Indian
government counsel U.S. Prasad told Mishra in requesting the former
executive be declared an absconder. Mishra granted the request,
which is designed to make it easier for the Indian government to
initiate extradition proceedings.
   India and the United States do not have an extradition treaty,
but individual extraditions are possible.
   The proclamation issued by Mishra orders Anderson to appear
before the Bhopal magistrate at 11 a.m. on March 31.
   Charges of culpable homicide were filed in November against
Anderson; Union Carbide Corp. Of Danbury, Conn.; Union Carbide
Eastern Inc. Of Hong Kong; Union Carbide India Ltd.; and eight
officials of the Indian subsidiary.
   Anderson was chairman of Union Carbide on Dec. 3, 1984, when
methyl isocyanate leaked out of a tank at a Bhopal pesticide plant
operated by the Indian subsidiary. The liquid turned into a lethal
gas when it hit the air and wafted over nearby shantytowns in the
middle of the night.
   More than 2,000 people died almost immediately, either in their
sleep or as they tried to flee. More than four years later, gas
victims are still dying, according to government reports.
   Officials say the overall death toll is more than 3,300.
   The government lists 20,000 people as gas-affected survivors, and
more than 500,000 people have sought compensation for alleged
exposure to the gas or psychological harm caused by the disaster.
   The Indian government is seeking $3 billion in damages from Union
Carbide, but the suit has bogged down in a variety of Indian courts.
   Anderson came to Bhopal soon after the gas leak and was arrested
after stepping off the plane. He subsequently was released on bail
of 25,000 rupees, worth about $2,085 at the time.

<HEAD>Affirmative Action Promise Releases State Money For Symphony</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislators freed $1.25 million for the
ailing Detroit Symphony Orchestra after it pledged to try to hire
more black musicians.
   The 100-member orchestra has only one black musician, even though
its home city is two-thirds black, and until recently hasn't tried
to recruit more, its chairman, Robert S. Miller Jr., said at a
legislative hearing Wednesday.
   Miller said he made no specific promise to hire a black musician
but that he hoped the orchestra would hire one before the end of the
year.
   Last year, the Legislature appropriated $2.5 million to help the
financially struggling orchestra. The orchestra got half the money
immediately, but lawmakers reserved the rest until they reviewed its
efforts to hire minorities and solve its financial problems.
   On Wednesday, an appropriations subcommittee freed the rest of
the money on a unanimous vote.
   ``I'm convinced major change has taken place and will continue to
take place in the orchestra,'' said Rep. Morris Hood, who sharply
criticized the orchestra's record on hiring blacks in a meeting last
week.
   Miller said that the orchestra would be ``out of business''
without the money.
   ``One is we can't afford to lose this money. Secondly, if we were
to be denied this money, the reason would be we didn't live up to
affirmative action goals,'' he said. ``I couldn't go to any
corporation or individual and say, `Please keep us in business, the
state just cut off our water because we're racist.'''
   Miller said symphony executives were developing a five-year plan
to take care of the money problems.
   But hiring more blacks could be more difficult because there are
relatively few black classical musicians, the symphony has only
about a half-dozen openings each year and it uses a blind audition
in which musicians are screened from the judges when they play, he
said.
   As many as 100 musicians apply for each opening in the symphony
and only one to three are black, Miller said. Musicians earn about
$50,000 a year.
   ``This is the big leagues and every kid on the sandlot wants to
play in the major leagues and Detroit is one of those,'' he said.
``In the music world, this is a high-paying, glamorous job.''

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today banned a
neo-Nazi organization, and police found a cache of weapons and Nazi
propaganda, including Adolf Hitler posters, during a sweep of the
party's headquarters.
   The ban of National Rallying blocks it from fielding candidates
in next month's municipal elections and comes amid a fear of a
resurgence of right-wing extremism in West Germany.
   West Germany's ARD television network showed police carrying
knives, guns and a box filled with ammunition from the Frankfurt
home of neo-Nazi Michael Kuehnen, head of the party. His home serves
as the party's headquarters.
   ``The police action had obviously caught the neo-Nazi leaders
completely off guard,'' ARD said, noting that Kuehnen was not home
at the time of the morning raid.
   The broadcast showed police in a workshop of the house, where
Kuehnen and his supporters allegedly filed down bullets so they
would cause more severe injuries.
   ``This blow against the neo-Nazis should be a renewed sign and an
unmistakable warning signal,'' Interior Minister Friedrich
Zimmermann said in a statement. He said the country ``is not about
to become a roaming ground for right-wing extremists.''
   The organization's goals have included expulsion of foreign
workers and people seeking asylum in the country. It has about 170
members.
   Zimmermann said police staged coordinated raids on apartments
belonging to the National Rallying in Bavaria, North Rhine
Westphalia and Hesse states.
   Bavarian officials said in a statement their searches turned up
an air rifle, two steel helmets, a gas mask, three pistols for
firing blanks and Nazi propaganda.
   Zimmermann said National Rallying was banned because ``it damages
with its open profession of neo-Naziism the reputation of the
Federal Republic.''
   In a later statement, the Interior Ministry said the group
espouses revolutionary aims to change West German society and thus
``attacks the free democratic constitutional structure.''
   The group had registered candidates for elections in Frankfurt
and in Langen, and members indicated they would also seek support in
other communities in the March voting in Hesse state.
   Its German initials ``NS'' are identical with the best-known
German abbreviation for Hitler's Nazi Party.
   The Nazi Party has been banned since West Germany was founded in
1949.
   Under West German law, the Interior Ministry may ban any
organization which it determines is spreading Nazi propaganda.
   There have also been calls for the ministry to ban another
neo-Nazi group known as the Free German Workers' Party, which the
Interior Ministry says has about 500 members. The Free German
Workers' Party is under investigation in connection with arson
attacks against foreign workers in West Germany.
   The interior minister accused Kuehnen and his followers of
building up neo-Nazi groups nationwide. Kuehnen also has been active
with right-wing extremists from several countries in planning
celebrations for the 100th anniversary of Hitler's birth on April 20.
   Under the ban, National Rallying cannot carry out any activities
as a group, including fielding candidates for an election. The name
National Rallying is also banned from use.
   Violations carry criminal penalties for individuals involved.
   The government in December 1983 outlawed Kuehnen's Action Front
National Socialists-National Activists group. He served a 3{-year
prison sentence for neo-Nazi activities and was released in March
1988.
   National Rallying was formed last summer.
   In addition to Kuehnen's group, the extreme right-wing Republican
Party also has shocked many West Germans with a strong showing in
West Berlin elections last month.

   A rare Southern California snowstorm
threatened crops, wreaked havoc on freeways, and stranded motorists.
Millions of people were absolutely delighted.
   ``I think it's very cool,'' said 11-year-old Laura Ruhland of
Santa Clarita, 35 miles northwest of Los Angeles. ``The trees
outside all look like Christmas.''
   The storm, the latest product of a relentless arctic cold front,
blew snow and ice across Southern California on Wednesday after
smashing low-temperature records throughout northern and central
California and around the nation.
   Rising temperatures and rain in Southern California turned
Wednesday's winter wonderland into today's morning mush.
   Temperatures rose moderately in most parts of the nation, but the
Alaskan front refused to die. Strong wind and cold weather poured
into the Great Lakes, leaving snow drifts 10 feet high in northern
Michigan. Snow also fell early today in Utah, Nevada and New York.
   The Alaskan weather has been blamed for at least 92 deaths
nationwide since moving into the lower 48 states on Jan. 31.
   Cold weather was blamed for the deaths of 26 people in northern
Mexico, where temperatures have dipped into the teens. Citrus
growers conducted an emergency harvest of oranges, grapefruit and
tangerines but said it was too early to tell how much of Mexico's
citrus crop had been damaged.
   Residents of the once-snowy Los Angeles communities of Granada
Hills and Tarzana and the nearby city of Thousand Oaks woke up to
rain.
   The Antelope Valley, 60 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles,
was the only southland area reporting a second day of snowfall
today. It got 3 to 4 inches.
   The cold sent natural gas use to record levels and killed citrus
and floral crops, threatening to raise the cost of an orange or a
Valentine's Day bouquet.
   Near-freezing temperatures early today forced street people into
shelters, and the cold apparently claimed a transient's life in
Fontana, 50 miles east of Los Angeles.
   An accident on an icy road killed one person in Redlands, about
65 miles east of Los Angeles.
   Blowing snow shut Interstate 5, California's main north-south
highway, about 40 miles north of Los Angeles. Hundreds of truckers
were stranded there and at other road closures, the Highway Patrol
said. Northbound lanes remained closed this morning.
   The Antelope Valley Freeway, which runs northeast from the San
Fernando Valley to Palmdale, was also closed for much of the day.
Today cars were escorted through the snow.
   Snowfall Wednesday measured up to half a foot in suburban Granada
Hills, Simi Valley, West Hills, Thousand Oaks and Tarzana, closing
schools and freeing students to frolic with makeshift sleds and
snowmen. Many schools reopened today.
   In Granada Hills, about 25 miles northwest of downtown, children
used trash can lids and cardboard boxes as sleds.
   ``It was all black and ugly and horrible,'' said young Mary Ellen
Crosby. ``Now it is all white and glistening and beautiful.''
   Winter-weary tourists who had flocked to Palm Springs for fun in
the sun were thoroughly disheartened as temperatures hovered at 45
degrees and errant snowflakes melted into hot tubs and swimming
pools.
   ``I was hoping to play a little tennis, but the weather's
disappointing,'' said Spencer Videon, a 50-year-old businessman from
Aspen, Colo.
   In Las Vegas, smart money was betting more snow would fall today,
after the gambler's mecca was dusted with a light snowfall
Wednesday. The city got a dusting of snow overnight.
   The Department of Energy postponed an underground nuclear test
scheduled Wednesday at the Nevada Test Site. Monitoring aircraft
wouldn't have been able to track any accidental release of radiation
while it was snowing, said DOE spokesman Jim Boyer.
   In central California, snow was reported in Bakersfield and
elsewhere in the San Joaquin Valley.
   Asparagus growers in the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys
reported frost damage. Small farmers who grow leaf lettuce also were
hurt, but Southern California growers generally were spared, said
Clark Biggs, a California Farm Bureau Federation spokesman.
   ``They didn't get real cold temperatures in citrus areas
overnight,'' Biggs said. ``We've had damage but you couldn't call it
disastrous.''
   Still, many growers and packers said lemon groves were hard hit
by the cold wave, with some early estimates saying up to 35 percent
of the crop may have been damaged.
   California is the nation's top producer of lemons, a crop valued
at $152 million in 1987. It will take about a week to 10 days for an
accurate assessment of the frost's damage.
   Wholesale prices of oranges already have risen slightly in
reaction to the cold. And flower growers in northern California said
their crop was badly hurt.
   ``The damage is done. The freeze has damaged the crops out there
and I don't expect them to recover at all,'' said George Ginilo,
agriculture commissioner in San Mateo County. The county's 1987
floral crop was valued at $165 million and serves wholesalers on the
West Coast and in New England.
   While some major suppliers of California flowers predicted a
shortage, it was unclear whether it would affect the market by
Valentine's Day. The Farm Bureau Federation said prices may be
``slightly higher.''

<HEAD>Two Rights Activists On Hunger Strike, Likely To Face Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two leading Bulgarian dissidents are in
ill health following 29 days of a hunger strike, sources said today.
   The Bulgarian and Western sources identified the two as Petar
Manolov, 47, who lives in Plovdiv, 60 miles southeast of the
Bulgarian capital Sofia, and Ilya Minev, 71, from the town of
Septemvri east of Plovdiv.
   They are leading members of the dissident Independent Association
for the Protection of Human Rights.
   The sources, who spoke by telephone to The Associated Press and
refused to be identified further, said both men are likely to face
trial on various charges in an attempt by authorities to disrupt the
association.
   Newspaper articles in the state-run Bulgarian press this week
hinted that authorities are preparing to put Manolov, secretary of
the association, and Minev, its chairman, on trial.
   In a lengthy article Feb. 7, the Bulgarian Communist Party daily
Workers' Daily commented:
   ``Is there a state committed to the rule of law that will not
call to account the conspirators who make it their objective to
overthrow the lawfully established government and to undermine the
foundations of the social order?''
   On Jan. 11, authorities raided Manolov's home and seized some
written material, including association documents, Bulgarian emigres
in Vienna said.
   Workers' Daily published what it said was the program of the
association. The program, as reported by the newspaper, calls on
members to ``organize a massive movement, which in just a few
months' time will already be in a position to assume the reins of
government.''
   The newspaper suggested that if Minev is tried, he will be
charged under an article of the constitution prohibiting
organizations that ``propagate a fascist or other anti-democratic
ideology'' and are ``directed against the socialist system of ...
Bulgaria and the rights of citizens.''
   Manolov would face charges of publishing pornography in a poem he
wrote, the newspaper indicated. The text of the poem was not given.
   According to one source, Manolov was visited by two doctors this
week who described his condition as serious. The report could not be
independently confirmed. The condition of Minev was not known.
   Manolov's telephone was disconnected, the same source said. The
Associated Press tried to reach Manolov by telephone from Vienna.
There was a free signal but it sounded distorted and no one picked
up the telephone.

   Sally Michael, the Agriculture Department's acting deputy

nomination was confirmed unanimously by the Senate.
   Reporters had not received advance word of Yeutter's swearing-in

   The arrest and indictment of a male go-go dancer
in a string of 24 rapes over five years has eased tension in the
victimized neighborhoods, a community leader says.
   ``The heat is off,'' said Irving Chudner, president of the West
Park Community Council, which held a training session in November on
how to fend off a rapist.
   Ronnie Shelton, 27, was indicted Tuesday on 152 counts, including
rape, kidnapping, burglary, robbery, assault and grand theft. James
O'Meara, an assistant county prosecutor, said it was the biggest
indictment he had ever seen.
   Shelton was already in jail on 27 charges, including rape, after
failing to post $200,000 bail, said his attorney, Jerry Milano.
   The dancer was arrested Dec. 30 in New York City after he was
photographed at an automatic teller machine using a bank card
belonging to one of the rape victims, police said.
   Authorities said the rapes took place between 1983 and last
November. Most of the victims were women in their 20s who were alone
at home, police said.
   The assailant often took the victim's bank card and forced her to
reveal the personal identification code necessary to withdraw money,
police said.

<HEAD>Judge Rules YMCA Is Taxable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A YMCA should pay taxes because the doctors,
lawyers and others who use the facility are not legitimate subjects
of charity, a judge ruled.
   Allegheny County Judge Ralph Smith Jr. ruled Wednesday that the
$7.5 million downtown YMCA does not meet the state's legal
definition of a charity and is not entitled to a tax exemption as a
charitable institution.
   The ruling could require it to pay more than $200,000 in property
taxes a year.
   The YMCA said it will appeal.
   The YMCA does not have to serve the poor exclusively to be
tax-exempt, said Bob Boisture, associate general counsel for the
national YMCA in Washington.
   ``Its basic mission is community service that extends to all
income levels,'' he said. ``If the IRS found an elite, upscale
operation, that would be taxed under current law, and we think that
is the right dividing line.''
   Boisture said the Pittsburgh case isn't viewed as a ``major
trend-setting case around the country.''
   ``It's only one case,'' he said. But he added, ``We're not going
to lie down and play dead when we get a ruling that says a Y is
taxable. We're going to appeal that and also go to the Legislature.''
   The judge cited a 1985 state Supreme Court case that said an
institution is a ``purely public'' charity if it advances a
charitable purpose, donates a substantial portion of its services or
benefits a substantial group of people who were legitimate subjects
of charity.
   Organizations that relieve the government of some of its burden
or operate free of the profit motive also can be classified as
charities, according to the law.
   ``He seems to have ignored all of the evidence regarding the
thousands of people annually who benefit for free from the numerous
programs and the more than 40 organizations and thousands of
children who use the Y each year,'' said YMCA attorney Richard
Wently.

<TEXT>
   A woman had an amiable conversation with
her ex-husband shortly before he apparently locked himself and their
two children in his truck, doused everyone with gasoline and set a
fire, police said.
   Benny Bilbrew, 29, and his children, Benny Carl, 6, and Fecia, 5,
were dead by the time rescuers arrived.
   Elsewhere in Mississippi, a Grenada teen-ager was in critical
condition today after her boyfriend poured gasoline on her head and
set her on fire, police said.
   In the Flowood fire, investigators believe the children may have
been dead before Bilbrew set the blaze Wednesday in the parking lot
of the hospital where his former wife worked, said George McKay, an
arson investigator for the Rankin County sheriff's department. All
three bodies were burned beyond recognition.
   Bilbrew's ex-wife, Connie, a cafeteria worker at the Woman's
Hospital, told authorities he called her 1{ hours before the bodies
were found.
   ``There was nothing indicating what was ahead,'' said police Lt.
Johnny Watkins. ``He was not violent on the phone and there was
nothing out of the ordinary.''
   However, Watkins said Mrs. Bilbrew told police the couple
divorced about two years ago but lived together for about a year
until they split up again a few weeks ago.
   There were no witnesses to the setting of the fire, but McKay
said he thought the children ``had met their demise before they ever
came to this parking lot.''
   ``I don't know anybody's children who wouldn't scream and holler
... if someone was rendering these children helpless. Someone would
have heard them scream. There are people in this parking lot all the
time and on the road,'' he said.
   McKay said hospital personnel noticed the fire only after the
explosion of some shotgun shells in the locked, burning truck. He
said no gun was found in the truck, although a knife was recovered.
He also said no gasoline container was recovered.
   Mrs. Bilbrew was inside the hospital when the fire occurred, and
Watkins said she had to be sedated after being informed of the
deaths. He said she wouldn't be questioned at length until Friday at
the earliest.
   Watkins said the woman had custody of the children, but they had
been visiting their father, a self-employed concrete worker, since
Monday because an ice storm had closed schools this week.
   In the Grenada incident, a 17-year-old whose name was not
released was in critical but stable condition at a Memphis, Tenn.,
hospital, with burns from the waist up, said said Grenada police
Capt. Joe E. Durr.
   The girl and her boyfriend ``had argued the night before and he
drove to her house shortly before noon Wednesday to collect clothing
and other items,'' Durr said. ``It was then that he allegedly poured
the gas on her and lit it.''
   Morrell Sykes, 21, of Duck Hill, was freed on $10,000 bail after
being charged with aggravated assault.

   Israel today demanded the removal of a Norwegian
U.N. commander who compared the expulsion of nearly 80 people from
Israeli-controlled territory in south Lebanon to steps Nazis took in
World War II.
   Lt. Col. J.E. Karlsen, commander of the Norwegian battalion in
the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL, made the comparison
last week in a private meeting with Israeli officials.
   He was protesting the expulsions of 79 Lebanese from the Israeli
security zone, which he said were carried out by Israeli-backed
Christian forces and Lebanese working for the Israeli Shin Bet
security service. His remark was leaked to the press, and Israel's
Foreign Ministry complained at the time.
   However, the ministry now wants him removed because he was quoted
by a newspaper as saying his comparison succeeded in drawing
attention to the expulsions, a Ministry spokesman said on condition
of anonymity.
   ``In light of the fact that the battalion commander is repeatedly
uttering his despicable opinions, Israel expects the UNIFIL command
to draw the proper conclusions regarding the officer,'' a Foreign
Ministry statement said.
   The dispute over Karlsen, 43, began Thursday when Israeli and
U.N. officers met to discuss the expulsions.
   ``In World War II, my fellow countrymen sacrificed their lives in
the struggle against the Nazis, who were trying to expel Jews from
Norway. Nowadays, you behave in south Lebanon exactly as the Nazis
did,'' newspapers later quoted him as saying at the meeting.
   After Nazi forces invaded Norway in 1940, they expelled people
from much of the north to create a military zone. They burned homes
and other buildings.
   Israel set up the 6-to-10-mile deep security zone north of its
border in 1985 when it withdrew the bulk of its forces from Lebanon,
ending a three-year occupation that followed Israel's 1982 invasion.
   The zone is patrolled by Israeli soldiers and the South Lebanon
Army, an Israeli-backed militia largely made up of Lebanese
Christians. Most of the population of the area is Shiite Moslem.

   House Speaker Jim Wright said today he's known
for a month that the public wouldn't accept enactment of a
congressional pay raise without a vote, but couldn't convince his
colleagues.
   Wright defended his handling of the pay raise proposal,
overwhelmingly defeated Tuesday.
   ``I've known for weeks that ultimately there would be a vote,''
Wright told reporters. ``I tried to suggest ... there would be a
vote. I've known for four weeks that 50 percent wasn't going to
wash.''
   The raise would have become law Wednesday unless both houses
voted to stop it. The Senate did so last week, but Wright had
devised a plan to let the raise become law, and schedule a vote
today to scale it back to 30 percent, along with a ban on speaking
fees.
   Raise opponents, however, forced Wright to schedule a vote
Tuesday and House members, under tremendous public pressure,
rejected the increase 380-48 when confronted with taking a public
position. The Senate passed the same language later in the day, 94-6.
   Wright told reporters today that ``it was already too late'' to
avoid a vote when he devised his 30 percent strategy a week ago. But
he added, ``If I had called for a vote sooner, members would have
said I gave away their pay raise.''
   Wright also said reforms in the practice of members of Congress
accepting honoraria would not be considered anytime soon, nor would
the House take up another pay plan in the near future _ whether for
judges, lawmakers or the executive branch.
   Had the congressional pay raise debate turned out differently,
House members would most likely have been voting today to deny
themselves honoraria, as the speaking fees are known.
   They may also have been deciding to limit the time members could
spend at a conference in Hawaii or elsewhere to give a single
speech. And they may well have been closing a loophole that permits
House members in office before 1980 to convert leftover campaign
cash to their personal use.
   The reforms vanished with Tuesday's vote on the pay raise.
   Both the House and Senate were moving to restrict outside income
if they could get a pay raise. Not any longer. The reforms now would
mean a loss of income, and members are in no mood to take a pay cut.
   ``I don't see us tackling it (honoraria) very soon,'' said a
House leadership aide, requesting anonymity, who described the
chances for reform as ``somewhere between negligible and nil.''
   The Senate, in fact, voted unanimously last week to ban speaking
fees, but made the action contingent on congressional salaries
rising from $89,500 to $135,000.
   The salaries were due to rise at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday if both
houses had not stopped it, and the Senate honoraria ban would have
kicked in at the same time.
   In the House, bipartisan negotiators had fashioned a package that
included the honoraria ban, the travel restrictions, ending the
campaign cash loophole and other outside income restrictions.
   House Speaker Jim Wright had devised a strategy to let the 51
percent raise become law Wednesday, and have the House vote today on
scaling it back to 30 percent while also voting on the outside
income package. The plan collapsed under relentless public pressure
against the raise.
   Common Cause, the self-styled citizens' lobby, will continue to
fight the honoraria system, said its president, Fred Wertheimer. The
group supported the defeated pay raise plan along with an honoraria
ban.
   ``Our view is, this is not legitimate money,'' he said. ``The
system is corrupt and unacceptable. We will press to end the system.
It's going to be a fight. I can't tell you how long it's going to
take. I do not think the system will survive in the long term.''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., perhaps predicted the
future when he said this week: ``No one has raised his hand for a
pay cut, so I hope we can go on as we have been.''
   Dole was the Senate's honoraria champion in 1987, with $106,050
in speaking fees, more than any other senator that year. He gave
$80,000 of the amount to charity.
   The Senate allows its members to retain $35,800 a year in
honoraria and the House permits retention of $26,850. That earning
capacity would be lost if the system was ended without a
corresponding pay raise.
   Although senators unanimously voted last week to ban honoraria if
the pay raise had become law, many House members suspect senators
like the system that gives them $9,000 more in compensation than the
House.
   ``A lot of people want to see what happens in the Senate'' before
tackling honoraria in the House, Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.,
said Wednesday.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Introduce Bill for New Mexico Nuclear Waste Depository</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressmen from New Mexico and Idaho
introduced legislation today to pave the way for the opening of the
nation's first permanent nuclear waste repository.
   The bill, sponsored by Reps. Joe Skeen, R-N.M., and Richard
Stallings, D-Idaho, also was designed in part to avert the forced
shutdown of a plutonium processing plant in Colorado that is a vital
link in the nationwide nuclear weapons complex.
   The legislation would authorize the transfer of more than 10,000
acres of federal lands in southern New Mexico to the jurisdiction to
the Department of Energy. It also authorizes payments of $250
million to New Mexico for costs related to building the Waste
Isolation Pilot Plant.
   The repository is being mined from salt beds deep beneath the New
Mexico desert and was to open last October. It developed water
leaks, and the Energy Department has not set a new date for opening
the site.
   The delay in opening the repository has caused a major problem
for the states of Idaho and Colorado. Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus late
last year barred the shipment of wastes from Colorado's Rocky Flats
plutonium processing plant to temporary disposal sites in his state.
   Colorado, in turn, has said it will close the Rocky Flats plant
in May unless a new waste storage site is found for the contaminated
materials that are building up at Rocky Flats just outside Denver.
   Andrus has said he would reconsider his barring of waste
shipments to Idaho if legislation were introduced to speed the
opening of the New Mexico repository.
   ``This was the last piece of the puzzle,'' said Stallings. He
added, however, that he was not sure Andrus was ready to reconsider
the ban.

   Volkswagen of America Inc. must pay $114,000
to a woman injured in a crash that a jury blamed on the gas pedal
and brake being too close together, a state appeals court has ruled.
   A three-judge panel Wednesday reinstated a verdict in favor of
Germaine Gibbs of Elizabeth.
   She was injured along with her three children when an Audi 5000
smashed through their apartment in 1983. The car's driver, Harold
Horowitz of Elizabeth, told police the automobile lunged forward
suddenly.
   Ms. Gibbs' attorney, James Hely, contended that Audi knew the
accelerator and brake pedal had been put too close together and
sometimes caused drivers to step on both simultaneously, prompting
the car to lunge forward.
   A Superior Court jury in March ordered Volkswagen to pay Ms.
Gibbs $100,000 in punitive damages and $14,000 in compensatory
damages.
   The judge set aside the punitive damages, finding there was no
proof Volkswagen knew the car had problems and failed to correct
them.
   But the appellate court reinstated the full amount.
   ``While the evidence to support punitive damages was not
overwhelming, we are satisfied that a jury could reasonably have
concluded that Volkswagen was guilty of deliberate acts of omissions
with knowledge of a high degree of probability of harm or reckless
indifference to the consequences,'' the court said.
   John Bennett, a spokesman for Volkswagen in Troy, Mich., said the
company may seek another appellate hearing.
   In 1983, Volkswagen told the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration that it would take corrective measures to ``prevent
inadvertent activation of brake and gas pedals at the same time,''
according to court papers filed by Hely.
   Internal Volkswagen documents and a government report conclude
that the pedals were close enough that the accelerator often is
pushed when the driver tries to brake, Hely said. The documents show
Volkswagen knew about the problem as early as 1979.
   Volkswagen declined to comment about the internal documents filed
by Hely.
   The Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based consumer group,
has charged that more than 1,650 accidents have resulted from Audi
5000s that inexplicably surged forward. More than 400 people have
been injured and five killed in those accidents.
   Audi has had poor sales since the unintended acceleration charges
arose. U.S. sales were 60,000 cars in 1986, 41,000 in 1987 and
23,000 in 1988, said David Healy, an auto industry analyst for
Drexel Burnham Lambert.

   Osamu Tezuka, one of Japan's leading cartoonists and
animators, died of stomach cancer Thursday. He was 60.
   Tezuka, a medical doctor from Osaka, published his first cartoon
in 1946 while he was a medical student at Osaka University.
   His masterpiece _ ``Tetsuwan Atom,'' or ``Astroboy'' _ swept the
nation when it was publshed in a magazine starting in 1951. The
cartoon was shown on Japanese TV in the 1960s and the 1980s. It also
was shown in the United States.
   Tezuka's cartoons and films, often dealt with medical ethics,
life and science, said Akiko Fukumura, spokeswoman for Tezuka
Productions.
   His works won many prizes during his 40-year career. Among them
were two experimental films, ``Jumping,'' a winner of the
International Animation Festival in Zagreb, Yugoslavia in 1984, and
``Broken-down Film,'' which won the 1985 International Film Festival
in Hiroshima.
   Tezuka is survived by his wife, Etsuko, and three children. A
private funeral will be held Sunday, with a a public memorial at a
later date.

<HEAD>Geothermal Field Could Be Biggest in Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A geothermal field on the southern island of Kyushu
could produce 250 megawatts of electricity and become the largest in
Japan, a construction company said Thursday.
   Fujita Corp. said one well that it drilled a year ago in Oita on
Kyushu had been proved to be the largest producer of steam and hot
water in the world, issuing 120 tons of steam and 100 tons of hot
water an hour, enough to produce 20 megawatts of electricity.
   Spokesman Hitoshi Miyagishima said Fujita was digging several
more wells in the geothermal field and had a plan to build 30 wells
to produce 250 megawatts of electricity with an investment of $1.2
billion.
   But he said Fujita had not approached the local utility about
building the plant, nor had it asked the national government for
financial aid.
   If the field is fully developed, it would more than double the
current national total of 215 megawatts of electricity from
geothermal sources, Fujita said. Press reports said Japan still
would trail the United States because one field there has a
generating capacity of 1,900 megawatts.
   Japan, despite its many volcanos and hot springs, has not devoted
much effort to exploring geothermal energy until recently. Its main
drive has been into nuclear reactors, which supplied 29 percent of
the country's electricity in 1987. The government has approved a
plan to double the output of nuclear power plants by the year 2000.
A nuclear reactor usually produces more than 1,000 megawatts of
electricity, or more than four times the output of the projected
geothermal field in Kyushu.

<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito's funeral rites Feb. 24 will last
more than 13 hours, the palace said Thursday.
   Palace officials released a final draft of the funeral day
schedule, beginning with an early morning religious ceremony at the
palace and finishing with another at 8:50 p.m. at the imperial
mausoleum, 28 miles outside Tokyo.
   The estimated 10,000 guests,including dignitaries from 134
nations, will begin assembling hours before the start of the
67-minute state funeral, scheduled to begin just before noon in the
Shinjuku Imperial Gardens in central Tokyo, the officials said.
   The day has been designated a public holiday.
   After one minute of silence, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, the
leaders of the two houses of Parliament and Supreme Court Chief
Justice Koichi Yaguchi will address the funeral gathering.
   Foreign heads of state or government or their representatives
will then line up to pay last respects to Hirohito.
   Hirohito, who died of intestinal cancer Jan. 7 at age 87, served
as the high priest of Japan's Shinto religion, and four of the five
scheduled rites will be religious in nature.
   Controversy has been growing regarding governmental funding of
the funeral. Leftist opposition leaders, academics and citizen
groups have charged that the government is violating a
constitutional separation of church and state.
   But palace officials, in unveiling funeral preparations, said
most funeral guests would not be involved directly in religious
ceremonies or would be allowed to decide for themselves if they
wanted to take part.
   The Sojoden-no-gi, the main Shinto funeral rite lasting 47
minutes, is to proceed in a sanctuary adorned with sacred trees and
a Shinto archway just before the state funeral starts.
   Imperial family members will attend, while the mourners,
including the prime minister and other government leaders, will
observe the ceremony from two tents facing the sanctuary.
   The state funeral will be followed by a 95-minute procession to
the western Tokyo suburb of Hachioji and a Shinto entombment
ceremony extending until 8:20 p.m.
   ``The state funeral ends when the procession reaches its
destination. ... From there on it's up to participants to decide for
themselves if they will continue to take part,'' one official said.

   A man who grew up thinking that his mother had died
in a farmhouse fire was reunited with her after learning that she
had spent 64 years in a sanitorium.
   ``This has been unexplainable joy,'' Paul Daniluk said. ``God has
permitted me to know and be able to express my love to my mother.''
   Daniluk, 68, of Denver, was 4 in 1925 when he and his father
survived the fire in upstate New York. He grew up thinking his
mother, Agnes, died in the blaze, but she had actually been
diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia and put in a county
sanitorium.
   She apparently suffered severe trauma during the fire, and her
husband was ashamed to admit her condition or whereabouts to others,
according to the family.
   Anton Daniluk remarried in 1948 and he and his second wife died
in 1976.
   ``When he was dying, my sister spent time with him, and he would
say something about Agnes and the fire. She couldn't tell exactly
what he was saying, but now she knows,'' said Richard Daniluk,
Paul's son.
   Daniluk mentioned to his daughter, Tanya, his memories of the
fire and his mother. In one scene, he was sitting with his father on
a bench in a red-brick building with white wood trim and shiny
floors while in the background, a woman swept the floor.
   ``Dad said the building reminded him of a hospital or
institution,'' Tanya recalled in a story in Thursday's Denver Post.
   So, trying to track down details on her grandmother, she began
calling New York hospitals, starting with Albany. She asked the
information operator if she knew of a hospital in a red-brick
building with white trim.
   The operator gave her the number of Binghamton Psychiatric
Center. They called three days after Christmas.
   ``My brother and I were talking, and I asked him, `What if she's
still alive?''' she said. ``He said that was impossible, because she
would have had to have been more than 100. Well, he was close. We
(dialed) the number and asked if they had a patient named Agnes
Daniluk. And the receptionist said, `Just a minute, I'll ring that
floor.'''
   They reached a supervisor and explained who they were and who
they were looking for.
   ``We all broke out in tears,'' Tanya said. ``God just led us to
her.''
   Mrs. Daniluk, it seems, had been led to believe her son had died
in the fire. Hospital officials warned the family not to expect too
much from the woman, now 95.
   She had become violent during her hospitalization and in 1955 was
given a prefrontal lobotomy, an operation used at the time for
certain treatments. But after a recent visit they were left with no
doubts.
   ``When she was happy, she'd clap her hands to the tune of a
polka. There's no doubt she knows,'' Tanya said.
   ``She may not know we're her grandchildren, but she knows it's
family,'' Richard said.
   Agnes, a ward of the state since 1925, is too fragile to be moved
to Denver and will remain at the hospital, the family said.
   ``She is well taken care of,'' Richard said. ``The people there
are really her family. They care for her as if she were their own.''

<TEXT>
   A delegate to parliamentary talks with
North Korea on Thursday urged the communist nation to retract its
decision to call off a meeting between the two nations because of
joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises.
   ``Along with all people who yearn for fruitful results of the
dialogue, we feel very much regretful (about the North Korean
decision),'' said Rep. Chae Mun-shick, a former National Assembly
speaker.
   He called on North Korea to continue the talks ``in the interest
of national harmony and unification.''
   Chae heads a South Korean delegation to parliamentary talks with
North Korea. The talks cover a non-aggression pact and other
measures aimed at easing tension between the nations.
   Delegations of lawmakers from both sides have met seven times to
prepare for a joint meeting of their full legislatures. Another
round of talks was to be held Friday.
   North Korea announced Wednesday that the Friday meeting must be
postponed until after the joint ``Team Spirit'' training exercises
are over.
   Chae said the joint exercises are defensive and have been
conducted annually since 1976.
   ``In fact, our side has informed North Korea in advance of the
exercises and even invited them to observe the open and defensive
nature of the training,'' he said.
   He said North Korea also conducts joint military exercises with
the Soviet Union.
   Chae noted the North Korean radio broacast came only 30 minutes
after the breakdown of another set of talks between the nations
aimed at preparing the first meeting of their prime ministers.
   ``This all gives me the impression that they had a pre-planned
scenario to embarrass our side and dump responsibility on us,'' he
said.
   The military exercises have been conducted in various parts of
South Korea since 1976 to train the joint command system of the two
countries in the event of an invasion. North Korea invaded South
Korea in 1950, starting a three-year war.
   This year's ``Team Spirit'' exercises began last week with about
200,000 troops taking part. The maneuvers usually last about two
months.
   Wednesday's talks bogged down over North Korea's insistence the
exercises be halted. The two sides are scheduled to meet again March
2.

<TEXT>
   Jamaicans voted today in an election
that was expected to unseat Prime Minister Edward Seaga and return
socialist Michael Manley to power. One person was reported killed
and six injured in scattered violence.
   A police spokesman said Glenna Williams, 25, a homemaker, died
when a gunman fired at party supporters accompanying a local
candidate in Kingston.
   The spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said another person was
stabbed and five were wounded by gunshots in separate incidents
today.
   Williams' killer fled, said the spokesman, who did not give any
of the victims' party affiliations.
   Shortly before the polls opened at 7 a.m., a man was shot at a
Kingston polling station. The police spokesman said he was shot in
the chest and was in serious condition.
   The independent RJR Radio station identified the man as Keith
Kettle and said he was shot in the backside by a .357-caliber Magnum
revolver wielded by one of eight Seaga supporters who converged on
the polling station.
   RJR began its 7 a.m. newscast with a prayer from the Rev. C.
Everett Bailey, who reminded listeners it was the beginning of Lent
and said, ``Let no one of us be guilty before God of aiding or
abetting any violence.''
   Twelve people have been killed and scores wounded since the
campaign opened Jan. 15.
   Manley, who since the 1970s has moved toward the political
center, was rated a 14-point favorite _ 57 percent of the vote to 43
percent _ in the last opinion poll Sunday.
   Seaga was seeking a third consecutive term, something no Jamaican
government has achieved since universal suffrage in 1944.
   Pollster Carl Stone of the University of the West Indies said
Manley's People's National Party would probably capture 48 of the 60
seats in Parliament. The pollster has correctly predicted the winner
of every Jamaican election since 1972.
   Today is Jamaica's first nationally contested election since 1980.
   Manley boycotted the last election, in 1983, in a dispute over
voter registration lists, giving Seaga's center-right Jamaica Labor
Party all 60 parliamentary seats.
   There were allegations of voting irregularities on both sides.
   Manley said he witnessed ``verbal harassment'' of supporters at
one station during a morning tour of polling places. That station
also lacked the red ink voters are supposed to dip their fingers in
to prevent double voting, he said.
   ``They were just openly breaking the law, creating an atmosphere
of hostility,'' Manley said. But he added the irregularities were
not widespread, ``just the odd incident so far, but one is
monitoring the thing.''
   Sen. George Ramacon of Seaga's party accused Manley's party of
ballot stuffing in at least one constituency.
   Military helicopters flew over the capital of 1 million on
election eve as part of a nationwide security operation involving
10,000 soldiers and police.
   Violence has been confined mainly to Kingston's slums, where
heavily armed gangs have traditionally controlled large voting
blocs, and rural areas far from the big tourist hotels on the north
coast.
   Seaga and Manley signed a peace accord in August in an attempt to
prevent violence, but throughout the campaign they accused each
other of breaching it.
   The charismatic Manley, 64, educated at the London School of
Economics, was prime minister from 1972 to 1980. He has projected a
moderate, pro-U.S. image in contrast to his previous far-left
leadership.
   Manley said he would restore relations with neighboring communist
Cuba during his first year in office but only on a restricted and
formal basis. Seaga broke relations with Cuba upon taking office in
1980.
   Seaga, 58, who was born in Boston and educated at Harvard, has
been one of the United States' closest allies in the Caribbean.
   He has helped restore Jamaica's battered economy, but higher
taxes and devaluation of the Jamaican dollar have cut deeply into
the purchasing power of most wage earners and the standard of living
of Jamaica's 2.4 million people has continued to fall.

<HEAD>Lawyer Known for Adopting Third-World Children Charged with Sexual
Abuse</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PORT ANGELES, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer who adopted at least 16
children, mostly from Asia and Central America, has been charged
with sexual abuse amid indications of ``wanton sexual activity'' at
his home, a prosecutor said.
   A 12-year-old blind girl from Guatemala told investigators she
was molested repeatedly by Theadore E. Ripley, 46; his adopted son,
Kori Ripley, 30, a former reserve sheriff's deputy; and at least one
juvenile in the home, according to documents filed in Clallam County
Superior Court.
   Police are also investigating claims of sexual abuse by several
children in the Ripley household, which once was praised in a
nationwide broadcast by author and minister Norman Vincent Peale,
the documents said.
   In the documents, county Prosecutor David H. Bruneau wrote that
``such disclosures by multiple victims and multiple abusers show a
pattern of wanton sexual activity within that residence, and
certainly tend to corroborate the continuing disclosures by the
victim of the sexual abuse of her.''
   The elder Ripley will plead innocent when he is arraigned Friday
on a charge of second-degree statutory rape, said his attorney,
David Johnson. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in
prison and a $20,000 fine.
   ``Ted adamantly denies the charges. We're hoping for a speedy
resolution of the case and we're confident that ultimately the truth
will come out,'' Johnson said.
   Ripley remained free on personal recognizance but was barred by
court order from trying to visit the girl.
   Denise Thomas, social work supervisor in the local Child
Protective Services office, said the girl had been declared a ward
of the state and placed in a foster home, but three minor children
remain with the Ripleys.
   State officials have begun an investigation of the household,
including a review of the license for Adoption Advocates
International, an adoption agency at the Ripley home.
   Last month Kori Ripley pleaded innocent to a charge of sexual
assault in 1984 on the Guatemalan girl, who had been living with
Ripley and his wife, Merrily, since infancy. Trial was set for March
17.
   Mrs. Ripley, who runs the adoption agency, has not been charged
in the latest case and is not mentioned in any of the associated
court papers.
   In July a juvenile boy living in the Ripley home was convited of
assaulting the same girl and was sentenced to 22 weeks in a juvenile
institution. It was that case that led to the charges against Kori
and Theadore Ripley, Bruneau said.
   Peale praised the Ripleys in a nationwide broadcast for adopting
children from other countries and bringing them to the United
States, according to newspaper accounts which said there were 18
children in the household in February 1980.

<HEAD>U.S. Sales to Europe May Reach Level of Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales by Americans to 12 West European
countries will reach the level of imports by the end of this year if
present trends continue, a Commerce Department official said
Thursday.
   ``That's not a prediction, it's a projection,'' Franklin J.
Vargo, deputy assistant secretary for Europe, told reporters.
   He told the House Small Business Committee that U.S. exports to
the European Economic Community rose more than 25 percent last year
while U.S. imports rose 5 percent, changes which cut the U.S. trade
deficit with the community to $13 billion from $24 billion in 1987.
   Another year of those trends and the deficit will disappear, he
said.
   He pointed out that U.S. companies and their affiliates sold more
than $600 billion worth of goods to the 12 countries last year,
three times as much as to Canada and four times as much as to Japan.
For many years after World War II, U.S. exports to western Europe
exceeded imports. In recent years, that trend has reversed.
   The 12 countries in the community are Britain, West Germany,
France, Italy, Denmark, Ireland, Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg,
Spain, Portugal and Greece. They are now trying to turn their
association into a single market, almost as integrated as the United
States, by the end of 1992. Some Americans see that movement as a
threat of a ``Fortress Europe'' which would keep out American goods.
   ``On balance 1992 should benefit the United States,'' Vargo told
the committee.
   He said faster growth should furnish a better market for U.S.
goods. But he said there are many problems remaining, especially in
the common standards being set by the 12 governments for imported
products and the possibility that tests of U.S. products to see that
they meet those standards will be required on European soil.
   Frank S. Swain, the Small Business Administration's chief counsel
for advocacy, urged American companies to set up a subsidiary in one
of the 12 countries.
   ``The consensus is that the EEC single internal market will
materialize, if not by 1992, then shortly thereafter,'' he said in
testimony for the committee.
   ``Establishing a subsidiary in the EEC would be the safest
option, although it also could be the costliest choice initially,''
he said.

<HEAD>`New Class' Sabotaging Gorbachev's Reforms, Article Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``new class'' of Communist Party and government
bureaucrats is sabotaging President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms,
and the Soviet leadership is unable to combat it, a daring magazine
article says.
   Direct criticism of Gorbachev's reform program has remained
largely off limits, despite his policy of greater openness in
society. But Sergei Y. Andreyev's article in the Leningrad monthly
Neva is one of the harshest and most detailed attacks yet on the
communist system and Gorbachev's policies.
   The party general secretary _ the post Gorbachev holds along with
the presidency _ remains ``an inaccessible and exemplary figure''
and his attempt to make the system democratic still leaves the
people politically powerless, Andreyev wrote.
   ``All decisions of the upper powers are carried out only to the
extent that they are advantageous to the new class,'' Andreyev said
in the 28-page essay in the January issue of the literary and
political magazine.
   He said the new class is a ``production and managerial
apparatus'' of 14 million party bureaucrats, government ministers
and managers.
   Gorbachev himself has launched a war on bureaucrats who interfere
in day-to-day decisions about production and has tried to transfer
some of their power to local officials and factory managers. He
often blames bureaucrats for the slow pace of reform.
   But Andreyev said Gorbachev hasn't gone far enough and that the
new class controls the government and party.
   ``Both the Soviet (government) and party organs have turned out
to be subordinate to its interests,'' he said, adding that the model
government of the people has been replaced by the ``dictate of the
new class.''
   Andreyev, 34, is a biologist and plant director who said he
represents a new political club called ``Alternative.'' He mocks the
party's claim of popular support and uses ``gensec'' in referring to
the general secretary. The abbreviation may be used in colloquial
speech but isn't seen in the state-run press.
   Andreyev's use of the term ``new class'' appeared to be a
reference to Milovan Djilas' book ``The New Class,'' which
criticized the Communist system. The Yugoslav politican and writer,
who broke with Yugoslavia's leadership, said in the 1957 book that
the Communist system had produced a new class of privileged leaders
instead of a classless society.
   The new class, Andreyev wrote, is largely responsible for the
lack of major improvements in the Soviet economy and for impediments
to democracy that have arisen since Gorbachev came to power in March
1985 and the next month launched his program of reforms known as
``perestroika.''
   ``We must admit that the economy is in a crisis. ... For the
years since the memorable April plenum of the Communist Party
Central Committee, the economy didn't get on track. ... The crisis,
in this way, is deepening,'' Andreyev said.
   He said politicians no longer tell the producers what to do, but
that ``new class'' uses party bodies to give orders to the society.
   Perestroika is moving slowly not because of some mysterious
forces, but because of ``well-organized sabotage,'' he wrote.
   Some Soviets have written letters to the editor claiming factory
managers and others are sabotaging Gorbachev's reforms by
withholding food and consumer goods from store shelves.
   The 57-year-old Kremlin chief has admitted perestroika is not
moving as quickly as he had hoped, but reaffirmed his commitment to
reform and said the people support his program.
   Andreyev, however, said the current leadership is partly to blame
for economic woes because it hasn't kept its promise to let
unprofitable businesses go bankrupt.
   ``The good promises made from high rostrums hang in the air and
are far from fostering the strengthening of faith in the possibility
of perestroika,'' he said.
   The article also criticized Gorbachev's political overhaul under
which a new, more powerful legislature and presidency are to be
created this year. Andreyev said the offices of Communist Party
general secretary and president _ or head of the legislature _
should not be held by the same man, as Gorbachev proposes, because
the lawmakers are supposed to check the work of the top political
figure.
   Despite the party's claim that it serves the people and is in the
``vanguard of society,'' the general population ``practically never
had access to the real levers of power and doesn't have it now,
either,'' he said.
   On the world scene, the Soviet brand of socialism has a
``demoralizing influence'' and is perceived as ``capable of leading
only to collapse,'' he said.

   The wife of spy Jonathan Pollard has
refused medication, slowed her intake of food and worsened an eye
injury by rubbing it, the medical director of a federal
prison-hospital testified today.
   ``In the long term, it is Mrs. Pollard that needs to seek
psychological care,'' Dr. Martha Grogan of the Federal Medical
Center said at a hearing on whether Anne Henderson-Pollard is
getting adequate care for several painful conditions.
   Jonathan Pollard, 34, was convicted in 1987 of supplying
classified U.S. documents to Israeli agents and is serving a life
sentence in a prison in Marion, Ill. His wife, 28, is serving five
years as as an accessory to his possession of the documents.
   Henderson-Pollard, who according to court papers suffers from
gastrointestinal disorders, an ovarian cyst and endometriosis, which
can cause chronic pelvic pain, has filed a lawsuit seeking the
appointment of an independent medical consultant to examine her and
determine what care is needed.
   Grogan testified that Henderson-Pollard has refused to be
examined in order to be referred to specialists. She said that
Henderson-Pollard is confused and that it is not in the woman's
interest for the medical center give in to her demands.
   Henderson-Pollard's lawyer, Hamilton Fox, asked Grogan, ``Would
you allow her to lose her sight if she refused to be treated by
you?''
   Grogan answered that it's a simple matter to get a referral and
that's how the medical center operates.
   Henderson-Pollard's father, Bernard Henderson, said his daughter
had been treated for conditions that prevented food from passing
through her system.
   ``I've seen my beautiful, young daughter who's a shell now,'' he
said. `She walks stooped over and weighs only about 91 pounds.''

<HEAD>Tax-Writer Says No to Bush's Capital-Gains Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee, on Thursday promised all-out
opposition to President Bush's proposal to reduce the tax on capital
gains.
   ``I'm not about to tell the wage earners in Chicago that they
should pay a higher tax than stockbrokers,'' Rostenkowski said in a
speech to the National Press Club.
   ``I personally will strongly resist any efforts to undo (the
1986) tax reform, including the return to a preferential tax rate
for capital gains,'' Rostenkowski said.
   He spoke eight hours before Bush was delivering a package of
budget recommendations that was expected to include a call for lower
taxes on capital gains, which are profits from the sale of stocks,
real estate and other assets.
   There is strong support in Congress, principally among
Republicans but even among some Democratic liberals, for taxing
capital gains at a lower rate than applies to wages and other
income. Capital gains and most other income now are taxed at rates
of either 15 percent, 28 percent or 33 percent.
   Seventy percent of capital gains are taken by people with incomes
above $100,000 a year.
   Rostenkowski has emphasized on other occasions that restoring a
preference for capital gains would threaten the landmark 1986 tax
overhaul, which was characterized by a significant cut in tax rates
for most Americans and a reduction or elimination of several
deductions and credits.
   Rostenkowski sounded another familiar theme at the press club:
Despite Bush's campaign pledges, any realistic plan for reducing the
budget deficit must include tax increases, he said.
   ``If President Bush is willing to put all spending and revenues
on the table, he will find a Congress willing to make the tough
choices that real deficit reduction requires,'' he said.
   The veteran lawmaker said that then-President Reagan had also
made a no-tax pledge but that during his eight years in office,
``Reagan raised more taxes than any peacetime president.'' Reagan
signed more than a dozen tax increases.
   Rostenkowski said the 1990 budget left by Reagan was based on
highly optimistic projections on how the economy will perform.
   ``Does anyone really believe that real growth will be 3.2 percent
this year? Or inflation at 3.8 percent? Or short-term interest rates
at 6.3 percent?'' Rostenkowski asked. ``Those are the numbers in the
last Reagan budget.
   ``I hope I don't see them in President Bush's budget,'' he said.
``I don't want to raise taxes, but I won't participate in a sham.''

   They tried to throw the book at Goldilocks for
her antics while the Bears were away _ breaking and entering, theft
and destruction of property.
   The Semmes, Bowen &amp; Semmes law firm staged a trial Wednesday at
the Herring Run Middle School based on the childhood favorite to
illustrate how the criminal justice system works.
   The jury of 83 sixth- and eighth-grade students heard testimony
on how Mama, Papa and Baby Bear took a walk in the woods on a cold
night while their soup cooled. They returned to find Baby Bear's
chair in shambles.
   ``Baby Bear's chair was ruined,'' Father Bear testified.
   On cross-examination, he admitted he might have left the door
unlocked.
   In her own defense, Goldilocks claimed she was searching for
leaves for a science project and got lost. ``I was cold and hungry.
I pressed against the door and it opened. I just wanted to use the
phone. I didn't mean to do anything wrong,'' she testified.
   One thing led to another, she said, ``And the next thing I knew,
there were these three screaming bears.''
   Teachers Robert Barnes and Macon Thornton played the bears and
Goldilocks was portrayed by Muriel Ashley, a school system public
relations employee who very conveniently had long, curly blond hair.
   Semmes attorney Kristine Howanski was the prosecutor while Yvonne
Harris, the firm's librarian, acted as the defense lawyer. Attorney
Bernard Justis was the judge.
   The verdict: Innocent on breaking and entering and theft, but
guilty of destruction of property.
   ``I wish I had never sat in that chair,'' Goldilocks lamented.

   Speaker of the Legislature Bill Barrett had
kept his birthday a secret from colleagues for 10 years, but when he
learned some senators had found out, he confessed Thursday that it
was his 60th birthday.
   ``But there's still no cake today,'' Barrett said in making the
announcement at the start of the legislative day. Senators
traditionally bring cake, cookies or other treats to the Legislature
on their birthdays.
   Barrett's admission led to an impromptu roast by lawmakers.
   Sen. Elroy Hefner noted that February is a great birthday month
for American statesmen: ``Washington, Lincoln and Barrett.''
   Sen. Doug Kristensen, who provided cupcakes for his colleagues on
his birthday on the first day of the session, said he was almost run
over by the speaker on his way to work.
   ``I didn't eat breakfast because I thought he was hurrying out to
buy cake or something,'' Kristensen said.
   However, Sen. Spence Morrissey saved the day by revealing that he
had brought cakes and doughnuts for the 49 senators.
   ``I got you covered,'' he told Barrett.

   Michael J. Fox received 5,000 threatening
letters from a woman who was upset he got married, a district
attorney investigator said Thursday.
   Tina Marie Ledbetter, 26, was arrested in Westlake Village last
week but was released after posting $100,000 bail, said the
investigator, Gary Schram. Ledbetter faces a possible charge of
making terrorist threats, officials said.
   Fox, 27, who won two Emmys for his portrayal of the insufferable
conservative son of liberal parents on the NBC series ``Family
Ties,'' married his former co-star on the show, actress Tracy
Pollan, last July. They are expecting their first child.
   Fox began receiving unsigned letters last February and they
continued after his marriage, said Al Albergate, spokesman for the
Los Angeles County district attorney's office.
   ``The letters threatened the lives of Fox, his wife and their
yet-to-be-born child,'' Albergate said.

   Academy Award-winning actress Patricia
Neal will be on hand when her first film in seven years has its
premiere in her hometown April 28.
   ``An Unremarkable Life,'' also starring Shelley Winters, will
open at Knoxville's Tennessee Theater and will serve as a
fund-raiser for the Patricia Neal Rehabilitation Center for stroke
victims, the Knoxville Journal reported Wednesday. Winters, herself
a two-time Oscar winner, also plans to attend.
   ``I hadn't done a film in, I guess, seven years,'' the
63-year-old actress told the Journal in a telephone interview from
her New York apartment. ``This role came up. I liked it, but we
couldn't come to terms financially. Then they came back with a
better offer and I grabbed it. It's a fabulous part.''
   In the film, directed by Amin Q. Chaudri, Neal and Winters play
sisters who share a house. When Neal's character falls in love, her
sister has trouble adapting to the prospects of being alone.
   Neal won an Oscar for her performance in ``Hud'' in 1963 before
suffering a series of strokes in the 1960s. She recovered and went
on to receive an Oscar nomination in 1968 for her role in ``The
Subject Was Roses.''

   The state's Supreme Court has denied a
motion that could have meant a reduction in the prison sentence of
singer Johnny Paycheck, convicted in a 1985 barroom shooting.
   Without comment, the court on Wednesday rejected a motion that
sought to prohibit Paycheck's sentencing under an Ohio law that sets
mandatory prison terms for certain felonies.
   Although Paycheck was sentenced to a term of seven to 9{ years
Monday in Highland County Common Pleas Court, lawyers said granting
of the motion could have made the singer eligible for a reduced
sentence.
   Paycheck, 50, will not be eligible for parole for more than 5{
years as a result of the December 1985 shooting in a Hillsboro
tavern.
   Paycheck, whose real name is Donnie Lytle, is being held in the
Highland County jail pending transfer to the state prison system
next week.

   Roemer had arrived from Baton Rouge by helicopter and was whisked

<TEXT>
   A council summoned by Afghan
guerrillas meets Friday, charged with choosing a government to
replace the Marxist regime, and the main question is whether
moderates or Islamic fundamentalists will prevail.
   The 526 delegates to the council, called a shura, include Moslem
guerrillas who have fought the Afghan and Soviet armies for a
decade, ministers who served the former monarchy, scholars and other
exiles.
   They are scheduled to meet for three days at a religious complex
on the outskirts of Islamabad. Guerrillas with assault rifles
patrolled the grounds Thursday and all cars were examined at the
gate.
   Insurgent leaders organized the council and gave it the specific
task of choosing an administration to oversee elections in
guerrilla-controlled areas of Afghanistan and in the refugee camps
Pakistan and Iran.
   More than 5 million Afghans, about one-third of the population,
have fled to the two neighboring countries since the civil war began
after a communist coup in April 1978. Most went to Pakistan.
   Azim Nasser-Zia, a spokesman for the moderate National Islamic
Front of Afghanistan, said he feared fundamentalists among the seven
major insurgent parties based in Pakistan would would resurrect an
earlier guerrilla government they had controlled.
   ``We don't want an extremist-dominated government ... because
they won't do anything about an election,'' he said. ``We will
boycott it if they insist on the revival of the Ahmed Shah
government.''
   Ahmed Shah, a leader of one of the fundamentalist parties, was to
have been president of a provisional regime the guerrillas chose a
year ago, but it never became functional.
   Nasser-Zia's party supports elections, which would be held over
six months and choose a parliament of 350 members. Millions of
ballots have been printed.
   The political strategy assumes the government in Kabul will fall
soon after the Soviet military withdrawal is completed next week.
   Red Army soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to help
fight the Moslem insurgency and an estimated 115,000 were in the
country when the withdrawal began May 15 under a U.N.-mediated
agreement. It is to be completed by Feb. 15.
   Political leaders of the groups based in Pakistan and Iran, where
the guerrilla alliance has eight parties, still were discussing a
formula for representation on the eve of the shura.
   Those based in Iran, predominantly Shiite Moslems like their host
country, were dissatisfied with 60 seats originally allotted by the
Sunni Moslems based in Pakistan, who claimed 420. The other 46
places on the shura are reserved for Afghan exiles and ``good
Moslems'' who have stayed at home.
   Afghanistan is more than 80 percent Sunni Moslem and about 17
percent Shiite.
   Qaribur Rehman Saeed, a spokesman for the Pakistan-based
alliance, said Thursday the coalition in Iran would be assigned 80
seats but he could not predict how many would demand places at the
council.
   ``We have problems, big problems,'' Saeed told reporters at the
meeting site.
   Years of quarreling among rebel groups made many Afghans
skeptical that the the leaders can put their differences aside and
reach consensus.
   Witnesses said a rally of about 3,000 moderates in Peshawar, the
Pakistani frontier city where the seven-party alliance is based,
ended violently Wednesday when fundamentalists threw bricks into the
crowd and attacked the stage area.
   The rally was organized by Afghans who favor the return of former
King Zahir Shah, who was deposed in 1973 and lives in Italy.
   Whatever government the shura chooses, the real power will be
held by a supreme council of guerrilla leaders and their appointees,
spokesman for the Pakistan-based parties said.
   The groups based in Iran have not yet been included in that
council and, since doing so would increase the fundamentalist
influence ``this is a ... gamble for us and for everyone else,''
said the moderate Nasser-Zia.

<TEXT>
   Afghanistan's military chiefs on
Thursday ordered the evacuation of five villages north of the
capital in preparation for an offensive against Moslem guerrillas
trying to topple the government.
   The country's top general, Mohammad Assef Delawar, said
authorities planned to move residents from the villages of
Shakadara, Karabargh, Kalakan, Bagram and Mirbachakot.
   Delawar said the evacuation had not yet begun. He gave no
schedule and did not say how many people would be affected.
   The villages are about 45 miles north of Kabul along a stretch of
the Salang highway, the route departing Soviet soldiers are using to
return home before their Feb. 15 withdrawal deadline.
   ``We are evacuating for security reasons, not to harm them,''
Delawar said. ``These people (the guerrillas) are highway robbers
and plunderers. If the people are not able to move them out, the
armed forces will help them. We will defend them.''
   Heavy shelling and bombings have been heard in the area in the
past week.
   In Moscow, Soviet TV said Thursday night that Soviet convoys on
the Salang Highway heading home have been shelled only once, and one
Soviet soldier was killed. No date was given for the attack. Earlier
in the day, however, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov
said, ``Rebels have not interfered with the withdrawal of Soviet
troops.''
   Most of Delawar's 20-minute news conference was spent on
political rather than military issues.
   He and other Afghan military officers refused to disclose the
strength of the armed forces, although foreign diplomats have
estimated the number at about 140,000.
   Asked about the ability of the armed forces to defend the country
after the Soviet's leave, the general said, ``The army is mighty
enough to defend the cause of peace and the people. We have enough
people and adequate weapons and our army is qualified to defend the
country.''
   Delawar refused comment on the morale of his troops.
   There have been reports some soldiers posted along the Salang
highway have defected and that two helicopter crews defected
Wednesday in Pakistan.
   Concerns about the Afghan army's ability to defend the capital
prompted Western nations to pull out their diplomats. Some diplomats
have predicted Kabul will collapse within months after the Soviets
are gone.
   ``This is not the first time the opposition has claimed they will
conquer Kabul. We want to make it clear that the government will
survive. No one can conquer Kabul,'' Delawar said.
   Earlier this week, the government said weapons had been handed
out to 30,000 members of the ruling People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan to help them defend their homes and neighborhoods.
   The Soviets entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to back the
government in its war with Moslem guerrillas. Under a U.N.-mediated
accord signed last year, they are to have all their troops out by
Feb. 15.

<HEAD>Publicist Says Actor Improving, Eager To Get Back To Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Actor Gary Busey is making good progress and
is eager to get to work on a film that was put on hold until he has
recovered from a near-fatal motorcycle crash, his publicist said.
   ``Hopefully he will be able to go back to work and get back in
the saddle soon,'' Carla Schalman said Wednesday.
   Busey, 44, underwent brain surgery after the Dec. 4 crash in
Culver City. He was thrown from the bike and struck his head against
a curb. He was not wearing a helmet and has actively campaigned
against proposals to make helmets for motorcycle riders mandatory.
   Ms. Schalman said an independent feature film, ``Howling at the
Moon,'' was put on hold when Busey was injured. The movie describes
the last day in the life of frontier lawyer John Wesley Harding.
Busey was cast to play the lead, Ms. Schalman said.
   Busey, who was initially treated at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,
was transferred to a private facility for rehabilitation therapy.
The name of the facility has been withheld to afford Busey some
privacy, Ms. Schalman said.
   She said the actor was deluged with cards, letters and gifts
shortly after the crash, but she was unsure if he had responded to
them.
   ``The main focus has been on physical therapy, getting better and
back in the swing,'' she said. ``He's making really good progress.
He seems excited about that progress. He's been talking on the phone
and taking exercises.''
   Ms. Schalman said she didn't know when he would be released.
   She said she had not talked to Busey to see if he had changed his
mind about the helmet law. ``The helmet law hasn't come up yet. His
concern, his doctors' main concern and everyone's main concern has
been getting him back well and recovered.''
   Busey gained fame after performing the title role in the 1978
movie, ``The Buddy Holly Story.'' His other film credits include
``Lethal Weapon,'' ``A Star is Born,'' ``Carny'' and ``The Bear.''

<HEAD>ABA Adopts Guardianship Reform Plan in Response to AP Series</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Bar Association has adopted a plan to
overhaul the nation's guardianship system for the elderly by
tightening judicial procedures, requiring more accountability and
educating judges and guardians.
   The ABA's House of Delegates, on a voice vote Tuesday, approved
the reforms drafted by guardianship experts last summer in response
to an Associated Press series, said Nancy Coleman, director of the
ABA's Commission on Legal Problems of the Elderly.
   The AP report, ``Guardianship of the Elderly: An Ailing System,''
found widespread abuse through guardianship, the court-administrated
system designed to protect the elderly.
   Ms. Coleman said that the ABA policy will be used to help states
draft guardianship reforms as well as generate education
requirements for judges and those who serve as guardians of the
elderly. By itself, it will not change guardianship laws.
   ``People looking to make changes can use what is now ABA policy
as a platform for measuring change,'' she said. ``In daily practice,
lawyers and judges could use it as a basis for making changes in
their courts.''
   The House of Delegates, the policy-making body for the nation's
largest lawyers' organization, recommended a broad range of changes,
from new court procedures to stricter standards for judges,
attorneys and guardians. The package also encouraged the legal
system to rely more on alternatives to guardianship when appropriate.
   Under guardianship, old people determined to be incompetent by a
court can lose most of their rights, such as deciding where they
will live, how they'll spend their money and what kind of medical
care they'll receive.
   The ABA delegates called for reforms to make the guardianship
process more understandable to the elderly, including easy-to-read
court petitions and better training for court officers.
   The package also called for stricter criteria for placing people
under guardianship and closer scrutiny of the wards and their
finances once they are placed under guardianship.
   The original proposal had included mandatory legal representation
for those facing guardianship and a set of rules for attorneys
representing guardians and those facing guardianship. Those sections
were dropped at the urging of members of the bar's Section on Real
Property Probate and Trust, who called for further study.
   The recommendation came out of a national conference on
guardianship last July called in response to the 1987 AP
investigation, which looked at the guardianship system in all 50
states and found that many old people are placed under guardianship
without legal counsel, often without a day in court.
   Once the elderly are placed under guardianship, the courts often
lost track of them, leaving the wards and their money prey to abuse.
AP reporters found many instances of money misspent and the elderly
mistreated.
   The series received the bar association's Silver Gavel Award in
1988.

<HEAD>Wild Golden Eagle Dies After Clinging To Life More Than Week</HEAD>

   A wild golden eagle that had clung to
life for more than a week after being shot with buckshot died
Thursday, a veterinarian said.
   ``He was a very magnificent animal, and it's just a shame,'' said
Dr. Loran Wagoner, a partner at the Skyline Animal Clinic who had
performed emergency surgery on the bird Tuesday. ``Words just can't
express how you feel when you put all the effort into it and they
die.''
   The eagle, a 10-pound adult male with a 6-foot wingspan, was
discovered Tuesday by state Highway Department workers near Sharon
Grove in southern Kentucky. Wagoner said it apparently had been shot
about a week earlier and was suffering from malnutrition.
   He and three other veterinarians installed intramedullary pins to
hold the eagle's broken bones together and were trying to restore
the enfeebled bird's strength sufficiently to transfer it to the
Louisville Zoo for full recovery.
   ``The surgery went very successfully, and the bird fully
recovered from the anesthetic,'' Wagoner said. ``In fact, during the
day yesterday, the bird continually got stronger. By yesterday
afternoon, he was occasionally striking at the hand of the person
that was feeding him.''
   However, Wagoner said when he came to feed the bird about 9:30
p.m. Wednesday night, ``I noticed what seemed to be neurological
signs developing. I called the veterinarian at the Louisville Zoo,
and he wasn't sure if this was the case. It was just a wait-and-see
type of thing.''
   The bird died a few hours later.
   Shooting a golden eagle or a bald eagle carries a federal penalty
of up to a $100,000 fine or one year in prison. The state Department
of Fish and Wildlife has asked for the public's help in identifying
the shooter.

   A former state highway official agreed to
testify against others and then changed his plea Thursday to guilty
to federal charges of extortion and filing false income tax returns,
prosecutors said.
   Sam Waggoner resigned in December as one of the three members of
the Highway Commission in the face of the impending charges.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ruth Harris told U.S. District Judge Tom
S. Lee that Waggoner had helped in the investigation of other
unspecified cases and his ``continued cooperation will include
testimony before grand juries and at trials.''
   Lee said Waggoner's sentencing would be scheduled later on the
extortion charge involving his acceptance of approximately $127,000
in cash from a construction company and three counts of filing false
tax returns for 1984-86, during which the IRS says he underreported
his income by $190,500.
   Waggoner, who was a highway commissioner for 21 years, remains
free on a $5,000 personal recognizance bond. He also posted a
$205,000 bond to cover back taxes, interest and penalties.
   Harris recommended Waggoner, 67, be sentenced to two years on the
extortion charge and placed on five years' probation on the income
tax charges, as well as a $40,000 fine. Waggoner must pay all back
taxes plus interest and penalties.
   She said the extortion charge carries a maximum penalty of 20
years in jail and a $250,000 fine. Filing false income tax returns
carries a three-year jail term and a $100,000 fine for each count.
   Waggoner announced his Dec. 31 resignation in a Dec. 21 statement
which said: ``I am resigning because I have made a mistake, and I
must now pay the price for that mistake.''
   On Wednesday, Lee sentenced a second highway commisioner, Bob
Joiner, 59, to a six-year prison term on a federal extortion charge.
He also received a five-year suspended sentence and was ordered to
pay a $100,000 fine on a tax evasion charge.
   The three members of the Highway Commission are elected only from
the district which they represent and act autonomously in matters
concerning road construction and maintenance within their district.
There has been considerable public discussion about changing the
system to make the commission a statewide board, but so far the
Legislature has taken no action to change the system.
   In the meantime, special elections have been held to replace
Waggoner and Joiner.

   The pilot and first officer of the Boeing
707 that crashed in the Azores, killing all 144 people on board,
were described by friends and family Thursday as enthusiastic,
dedicated aviators.
   ``He just loved motion,'' said Craig Abington, a pilot and major
with the Tennessee Army National Guard who had known pilot Leon
Daugherty since 1975.
   ``Most of his efforts were invested in the flying business. He
really loved it,'' he said.
   In all, seven crew members, all American, and 137 Italian
tourists died when an Independent Air Corp. charter jet slammed into
a mountain Wednesday in the Azores Islands. The plane, en route from
Italy to the Dominican Republic, was approaching landing for a
refueling stop.
   Daugherty, 41, of Nashville, was engaged to one of the four
flight attendants who died, 26-year-old Yvette Murray of Marietta,
Ga.
   Also killed were first officer Sam Adcock, 36, of Nashville;
flight engineer Jorge Gonzalez, 34, of Rex, Ga.; and flight
attendants Sabrina Cromarty of Atlanta; Helen Ziegler, 56, of Warner
Robins, Ga.; and Angela Urban, 24, of West Palm Beach, Fla.
   John Matthews, a pilot and friend of Adcock's for five years,
said he was ``real easy to get along with. He was very professional
and loved to fly.''
   Daugherty had logged about 8,000 hours in the air and had worked
for Smyrna-based Independent for about two years after stints in the
Navy and Army, said Maj. Hooper Penuel, the Tennessee guard's public
affairs director. Daugherty joined the guard in 1974.
   Abington said Daugherty was still active with the guard.
   ``He just loved airplanes and helicopters and cars and
motorcycles,'' he said. ``You can't just use an adjective here or
there for a person like that.''
   Two of the Georgians killed in the crash, Gonzalez and Mrs.
Ziegler, were last-minute replacements, called in after regularly
scheduled employees were unable to make the flight.
   Gonzalez, 34, was the sole support for his mother, wife, sister
and son, all of whom are natives of Colombia.
   Mrs. Zeigler, 56, a flight attendant, had made the same flight
many times before, said her husband, Kenneth, himself a former pilot
for Independent Air.
   ``When she left, I said to her, `Helen, you shouldn't have to go
out again. It's just not right,''' said Ziegler. ``But she would
never turn down a flight. That wasn't even supposed to be her
flight. They said they needed her and she went.''
   ``This is so final. We had been married for 35 years,'' he said.
``You just don't find people like that anymore. She was a very
strong person. She kept our whole family together.''
   E.H. Raney of Shelbyville said his 27-year-old daughter, Shan
Raney, was the Independent flight attendant who was supposed to have
made the fatal trip. ``She had gotten the flu and couldn't go to
work,'' Raney said. ``But she's terribly upset because she lost a
lot of friends on the plane.''
   Ms. Murray's father, Tom Murray of Atlanta, said his daughter
loved to fly and was not afraid, despite recent reports of crashes
and maintenance problems in the airline industry. Flying ``was a big
thing for her,'' Murray.
   ``Because she was going to be married, she didn't think they'd
let her continue flying,'' he added. ``She probably would have been
out of this thing in a month or so.''

<HEAD>Private Factory Forced to Go Public After Attacks, Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The owner of a private factory was forced to give
his business to the state after peasants, wanting part of his
profits, attacked the plant and officials jealous of his success
sued him, a newspaper said Thursday.
   The report in the official China Youth News illuminated some of
the problems faced by individual firms in China, which has been
experimenting with private enterprise the last few years.
   Some businessmen have incurred the people's wrath because they
fire people as they attempt to break the ``iron rice bowl,'' China's
tradition of lifetime employment. Others have been attacked because
local residents are jealous of their success.
   The story of Ren Jianfa falls into the second category.
   In 1982, Ren scrimped and borrowed about $9,500 to open an
ironworks factory in Jiangyin, a small city in the eastern province
of Jiangsu.
   After two years, Ren had repaid his debts, ``set down some roots
and even cleared a profit,'' the story said. ``But as the sound of
the hammer brought profits, so it also brought troubles.''
   First, a representative of local government called on him, saying
he had to start sharing his profits because his factory was on
public land. Ren had already agreed to pay the electrical, water and
electric plowing fees of 100 households.
   ``But this little problem was just a sign of things to come,''
the article said.
   One day a fisherman couldn't catch anything in a river near the
factory.
   ``He alleged the hammers of Ren Jianfa's factory had scared away
his fish,'' the paper said.
   The man gathered about 60 of his friends and they attacked the
factory, smashing its windows, cutting its power supply and blocking
its docks. Production stopped.
   ``Even though Ren had thousands of dollars, he couldn't get any
help, because his factory was privately owned,'' the paper said.
``So Ren Jianfa took one step back in order to go two steps forward
and gave the factory to the state-run production team.''
   In so doing, Ren united his interests with those of a collective.
   Ren signed a contract with the production team, ``changed from
`boss' to factory manager, and under the umbrella of a state-run
business, looked forward to the future.''
   Soon, government officials from Wuxi, a nearby city, came to the
factory, ``saying they had received a tip. They wanted to see his
books.'' It appeared another government agency also wanted a piece
of Ren's profits.
   ``This fellow gave his factory to the production team but didn't
give it to us,'' the newspaper quoted officials in the other agency
as saying. ``We've got to send this guy to jail.''
   Within days 100 people had signed on to sue Ren.
   ``But in court there was nothing but silence,'' the report said.
``What crimes did Ren commit? Nobody really knew.''
   The only ``crime'' was that Ren had gotten rich.
   The suit was dropped but the marathon struggle over interests had
kept the factory silent six months.
   In summing up, the story said Ren Jianfa was no Lei Feng, a
Chinese military hero known for his selflessness.
   ``But,'' it said, ``he understands that if you want to succeed
here you have to have dauntless strength.''

   The judge at Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial
today sent the jury home until next week after the Justice
Department succeeded in temporarily bringing the case to a halt.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an administrative stay,
halting all proceedings, after the Justice Department, acting on
behalf of U.S. intelligence agencies, said more stringent controls
are needed over classified material North intends to present in his
defense.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said he would ``close up
shop'' because a three-member panel of the appeals court issued the
stay and has given him no indication when it will rule further on
the matter.
   Gesell said the appeals court ``has asked me not to go forward
until they have had a chance to look at'' the papers filed in the
case.
   The three-judge panel said the administrative stay was ``to
permit the court sufficient opportunity to consider the pending
motion.''
   The judge said he would reconvene Monday morning to assess the
situation.
   ``It is imperative that the trial be suspended pending the
outcome of the pending appeal,'' said the Justice Department's
motion for a stay.
   The department said it was making the motion ``because of the
national security equities involved and the highly sensitive
classified information that may be compromised if this case is
permitted to proceed to trial without correction of the procedures
that the district court proposes to employ.''
   Minutes after the jury of nine woman and three men, all of them
black, was chosen, Gesell declared his intention to permit the
prosecution to begin opening arguments.
   After a brief recess, Gesell returned and disclosed the appeals
court's action shortly after the jury and six alternates were chosen.
   The panel of Chief Judge Patricia Wald and Circuit Judges Douglas
H. Ginsburg and David Sentelle said in a brief order that the stay
``should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits'' of
the Justice Department's request.
   Earlier, Gesell had denied a motion by the Justice Department for
a stay of the trial pending the outcome of its appeal seeking to
have more stringent controls on classified material that North plans
to present in his defense.
   In denying the motion, Gesell said ``the attorney general's
belated general appearance is wholly misplaced. ... The attorney
general's attempt to appeal is ... at odds with the purposes of the
laws establishing the independent counsel,'' who is prosecuting the
case.
   Ron Noble, a Justice Department deputy to criminal division chief
Ed Dennis, immediately went to the U.S. Court of Appeals in an
attempt to get the trial stopped.
   Gesell said he would check with the appeals court ``and ask
whether any instructions await me.''
   At issue is whether national security will be threatened by
disclosure of classified information during North's trial on charges
of shredding evidence and lying to Congress in an attempt to cover
up the Iran-Contra affair.
   The Justice Department stepped into the case Wednesday by
demanding censorship control over classified documents that the
defense wants to enter as evidence. That position was also opposed
by independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, who is prosecuting North, a
former White House national security aide.
   The judge called the department's intervention in the case ``one
of the most frivolous motions I have ever seen.''
   Gesell said the only person who may make an appeal in the case is
the independent counsel, but Noble responded that ``the government's
position is that the right to appeal is the attorney general's.''
   In a written order denying the stay, Gesell wrote that the Ethics
in Government Act places all investigative and prosecutorial
functions in the ``exclusive control'' of Walsh. ``Independent
counsel Walsh opposes the motion,'' he noted.
   His irritation with the Justice Department's belated intervention
in the case came to the fore on Wednesday when he said constant
interruptions by government intelligence agencies threaten to turn
the proceedings into a ``cuckoo clock trial.''
   The department, prodded by the National Security Agency and CIA,
is seeking authority to screen and block disclosure of classified
material.
   ``There is some information that cannot be put back in a
bottle,'' Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stephen Saltzburg said
Wednesday.
   But Gesell said prior rulings in the case already have addressed
the issue and installed security safeguards _ without damaging
North's right to a fair trial.
   ``This is not a trial of national security; it's a trial of
Oliver North,'' the judge said.
   Gesell said he wasn't going to tolerate a ``cuckoo clock trial''
which would be constantly interrupted by reviews of classified
material before it is introduced in the courtroom.
   The Justice Department wants a court order saying that North
cannot disclose any classified information unless it is explicitly
approved by the court and if the government has no objection to the
disclosure.
   In arguments before Gesell on Wednesday, the Justice Department
said North has failed to meet standards required by the Classified
Information Procedures Act.
   It said notices from North, which are supposed to spell out what
classified material he plans to use at trial, have been ``either
totally useless or at best minimally informative.''
   Further, it said, ``the court has not ruled on what particular
classified information is relevant to the issues that will be tried,
and whether it is admissible on some or all issues.''
   Gesell was angry over the delay as jury selection neared
completion.
   ``You can't ride this horse in both directions,'' the judge said.
``You can either move to protect national security or you can move
to a fair trial. Congress says that if push comes to shove, a trial
judge has one option, to move toward a fair trial.''
   Gesell ruled on Jan. 19 that North could introduce classified
information if it tends to show that his purpose was not to break
the law, or if it tends to show that statements made by government
witnesses are false or misleading.
   He also authorized North to divulge information about coverup
attempts by other officials, and about the Reagan administration's
attempts to have other countries provide military assistance to the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels after Congress banned U.S. aid.

<HEAD>Troops Round Up 175 Palestinians in Hebron Soccer Stadium</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soldiers rounded up about 175 Palestinians in
the West Bank on Thursday and forced them to sit blindfolded and
bound for up to 16 hours in a soccer stadium, Arab and Israeli
witnesses said.
   Riots erupted outside the Megiddo Prison for a second straight
day after Arab reports circulated that a second Palestinian had died
of wounds sustained in a riot there Wednesday, Israel radio reported.
   Police said an Israeli settler killed when his car went up in
flames in the West Bank on Wednesday appeared to be the victim of a
terror attack, but an investigation was continuing.
   ``It is reasonable it was terrorist,'' West Bank police commander
Haim Malcha said on Israel radio. ``Even though the results are
preliminary, it seems unreasonable there was any other cause.''
   Israel radio said laboratory tests determined the car was not hit
by a gasoline-filled bottle or firebomb because no glass fragments
were found.
   But the tests uncovered a large quantity of flammable liquid in
the driver's seat, the radio said. It said police suspected the car
was either hit with a flaming plastic bottle or that gasoline was
thrown at it.
   The settler, Albert Jerassi, 38, was the 16th Israeli to die
since the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories began
Dec. 8, 1987. At least 379 Palestinians have died, most from Israeli
gunfire.
   Arab reports said 17-year-old Nidal Zuhdi Deeb died after being
shot by troops trying to quell Wednesday's disturbance at Megiddo
Prison in northern Israel. The army said it was checking the report.
   The radio said Thursday's riot was quickly subdued by prison
guards and there were no casualties.
   In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, troops shot and wounded nine
Palestinians, including a 9-year-old girl and a 10-year-old boy from
Gaza's Mughazi refugee camp, Arab doctors said. Both were struck in
the head with rubber-coated steel bullets, they said.
   The army did not confirm any of the shootings.
   Troops with lists of suspects began rounding up Palestinians
overnight in the West Bank city of Hebron, detaining about 175 in a
soccer stadium where they were forced to sit cross-legged on the
ground until 2:30 p.m. Thursday, Arab witnesses and an Israeli
photographer said.
   Many were in their pajamas and had their hands tied behind their
backs. Some were blindfolded.
   The Palestinians apparently were suspected of planning an action
against Israeli authorities in Hebron, Israeli sources said.
   Arab witnesses said the detainees were given water but no food.
One of the Palestinians was slapped twice by a soldier, they said.
   Dozens of the detainees were later moved from the soccer field,
apparently to detention centers for questioning, the witnesses said.
The rest were sent home.
   Also Thursday, the army sealed three Palestinian homes and
demolished a fourth belonging to Palestinians accused of attacks on
Israelis.
   One of the residences sealed belonged to Said Dadu, who allegedly
threw explosives at the home of Trade and Industry Minister Ariel
Sharon in the Arab quarter of the walled Old City.

   Here is information about the jurors in Oliver
North's trial. They were chosen from a pool of 45 picates to the pilots
that it may be in their
interest to honor a (Machinists) picket line,'' said Air Line Pilots
Association spokesman Ron Cole. ``There appears to be a feeling on
the company's part that there is no incentive to negotiate with us,
with pilots crossing the picket line. That could be very poor
judgment on the company's part.''
   Cole said his union was making unspecified preparations in case
pilots decided to honor the picket lines, but no final decision
would come until an actual strike by the Machinists.
   The Machinists, meanwhile, were voting on whether to authorize a
strike, and militant talk pervaded the ranks.
   ``We're ready to rock 'n' roll,'' Frank Majors, a 21-year veteran
line mechanic, said after voting to authorize the strike at
Machinists Local 702, across the street from company headquarters.
``It's matter of principle, mainly. It's just time.''
   Majors referred to the demand for $150 million in union wage cuts
by the management that was installed after the Texas Air Corp., led
by Chairman Frank Lorenzo, acquired Eastern nearly three years ago.
   Union officials predicted overwhelming approval of a strike,
which could come if no settlement is reached in their 16-month-old
contract dispute by midnight March 3.
   The head of the local Eastern's Machinists, Charles Bryan, said
Thursday that Eastern is trying to ``contract out or take the work
away'' from Eastern employees in violation of federal labor law.
   ``They are now telling all employees to cease production, wrap
up, package and box up the parts and send them out for other people
to repair them,'' Bryan said. ``We're probably going to be in
federal court to have that stopped.''
   The company has said it would have no comment on the strike vote
that began Monday in Eastern locals nationwide. The vote will
conclude Feb. 14 in Atlanta.
   A National Mediation Board negotiator is continuing efforts to
gain an agreement between the two sides, although no recent progress
has been reported.
   ``We have had tremendous turnout,'' said Frank Ortis, the
4,000-member Miami local's vice president. ``At 6 a.m., they were
lined up at the door waiting to come in. In 1{ hours, we ran 900
people through here.''
   As shift changes came, Machinists wearing red union T-shirts
marched from the airport to the local hall. The 8,500 Machinists
comprise 30 percent of Eastern's workforce.
   The Miami Herald reported Thursday that System One, the
data-processing unit of Texas Air, is ready to supply volunteer
backup workers to handle baggage, aircraft cleaning and other such
chores in the event of a strike.
   The Miami local vote Thursday followed two days of sporadic job
actions by the Machinists at Miami International Airport. The
Machinists said they were protesting forced overtime.
   Company spokesman Robin Matell said 100 Machinists involved in a
mass walkout Tuesday were given 10-day suspensions and that more
such discipline was possible. Eastern said its contract with
Machinists includes mandatory overtime if conditions necessitate the
extra hours of work.
   The number of employees participating in Tuesday's three-hour
walkout swelled at one point to up to 1,000, and the company said
there were two smaller, shorter walkouts Wednesday.
   Eastern's flight schedule hasn't been disrupted, the company said.
   Ortis said some union members received suspension notices by mail
while others were ordered to surrender identification badges when
they reported for work. He said the union will appeal the
suspensions.

<HEAD>Hezbollah Pulls Out of Southern Lebanese Villages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JBAA, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian-backed Moslem militiamen on Thursday
pulled out of captured villages in the south under terms of a peace
accord that ended their nine-month fight with Syrian-allied forces.
   The fundamentalist fighters of Hezbollah, or Party of God, took
refuge in hideouts in mountains near Israel's security zone. But
there was no immediate move by their Shiite rivals, the Amal
militia, to take over the villages of Jbaa and Ein Bouswar.
   Some angry villagers said they want both militias to stay out.
   Ahmad Raad, a member of Jbaa's municipal government, walked out
of his bomb-scarred house and shouted: ``We don't want militiamen
any more: Neither Amal nor Hezbollah.
   Fatima Qobeissie, a housewife, yelled: ``The militias have ruined
our village! We don't want them back!
   ``Three rockets hit our house, but luckily we were hiding in a
bomb shelter,'' she said. ``Who's going to compensate us for our
losses?''
   The withdrawal was part of a peace treaty reached last month
under supervision of Syria and Iran.
   The pullout came 39 days after the radical Hezbollah seized Jbaa
and Ein Bouswar in an assault on Amal last month. Amal recaptured
most of the mountainous region in a string of counter-offensives but
failed to dislodge Hezbollah from the mountaintop villages near
Sidon.
   Hezbollah official Saeed Mattout said in Jbaa that his forces
withdrew before dawn to bases on Mount Safi near the western end of
the security zone.
   Israel set up the buffer zone, which runs up to 10 miles deep
into neighboring Lebanon, when it withdrew most of its occupation
army from south Lebanon in 1985.
   Mattout said Hezbollah may maintain bases on Mount Safi under the
Damascus agreement.
   Jamal Qalqas, an Amal representative, toured the two villages
after Hezbollah militiamen withdrew and called on civilians who
evacuated the area during the fighting to return home.
   At least 173 people were killed in the fighting that broke out in
south Beirut Dec. 31 and spread to the Shiite-dominated south. It
was the latest eruption in a power struggle for control of Lebanon's
1 million Shiites, the country's biggest sect.
   Hezbollah advocates creating an Iranian-style Islamic republic in
Lebanon.
   The more secular and nationalist Amal favors a multisect
government in Lebanon in which Moslems would hold an equal share of
power with traditionally dominant Christians.
   In the Chouf mountains southeast of Beirut on Thursday, gunmen
shot and killed a senior aide of Walid Jumblatt, a Druse Moslem
military leader, police said.
   Anwar Fatayeri, political bureau member of Jumblatt's Progressive
Socialist Party, was gunned down in an ambush on a road nine miles
from Beirut. No one claimed responsibility.

   Organizers of a world famous dog show ordered the
Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to remove
photographs of dead dogs from an exhibit, calling them shocking and
upsetting.
   One picture showed a pile of dogs killed by injections because
their owners could not be found. Another was of a bulging garbage
bag captioned, ``This doggy bag contains a dead doggy.''
   The society used the photographs in full-page newspaper
advertisements Sunday to launch a campaign for a dog registration
plan to deter people from buying pet dogs and then abandoning them.
   It had included the photos in the society's exhibit at the Crufts
Dog Show, the 103-year-old exhibition that began Thursday, hoping to
enlist the support of dog lovers.
   The charity said that since government licenses for dogs were
scrapped last year, it has had to slaughter 1,000 healthy dogs daily
because their owners cannot be traced.
   ``We do not like this horror-comic approach,'' said Martin
Sinnatt, secretary of the Kennel Club that runs the Crufts show.

   Nevada leads the country in suicides, and has
asked the federal officials to study why more than twice as many
young people than the national average take their lives here.
   ``Suicide doesn't just happen,'' state Health Officer Joseph
Jarvis said at a news conference. ``If we can understand why it
happens to some people and not others, maybe we can begin to prevent
it.''
   Jarvis asked Gov. Bob Miller to request the study by the Centers
for Disease Control. They study is expected to take six to nine
months.
   ``We probably won't be able to come up with all the answers, but
if we can answer one question, I would consider it a success,'' CDC
researcher Patrick Meeghan said at the news conference Wednesday.
   He and Patrick O'Carroll, both of the Atlanta-based center's
intentional injuries section, will look at suicides and attempted
suicides for trends that might contribute to Nevada's unusually high
rate.
   An average of 29 of 100,000 residents age 15 to 24 kill
themselves each year, compared to the national rate of 13 per
100,000 in that age group. The state recorded 1,631 suicides 1982-87.
   ``Until we do the study, we don't know if there's something
special in Nevada that makes the rates high,'' Meeghan said. ``This
gives us an opportunity to shed some light on the issue.''

<HEAD>Lawmakers Unveil Bill Aimed At Opening Permanent Waste Site</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Joe Skeen, R-N.M., unveiled a bill
Thursday aimed at clearing the way for opening the nation's first
permanent nuclear waste repository.
   The legislation, co-sponsored by Rep. Richard Stallings, D-Idaho,
was designed also to end a political impasse between the Energy
Department and the states of Idaho and Colorado that threatens to
force the closing of a key nuclear weapons facility.
   The bill would give jurisdiction of more than 10,000 acres of
federal lands in southern New Mexico to the Energy Department, which
is seeking to gain safety clearance to open the Waste Isolation
Pilot Plant.
   The waste dump had been scheduled to open last October, but
technical problems and questions about the long-term integrity of
the repository have delayed the opening.
   The delay prompted Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus late last year to seal
his state's borders against shipments of hazardous wastes from the
Rocky Flats plutonium processing plant near Denver. Colorado, in
turn, said it would close the plant in May unless a new storage site
is found for the contaminated materials that have been accumulating
at Rocky Flats since Andrus imposed his ban.
   Rocky Flats is the only plant capable of processing plutonium for
nuclear weapons.
   Andrus has said he would reconsider his ban on waste shipments to
Idaho if certain conditions were met, including the introduction of
legislation to speed the opening of the New Mexico repository.
   Stallings told a news conference it was not clear whether Andrus
was ready to reconsider.
   Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., said he planned to introduce a bill
later this month that would place stricter environmental conditions
on opening the repository.
   Skeen said he and other congressmen with an interest in the waste
issue would work with Richardson to draft a compromise bill to try
to get the pilot plant open by the end of the year. A key point of
dispute is how much waste material should be allowed into the site
during an initial testing period.
   Skeen said the matter could not be resolved until the Energy
Department furnished more information about its plans for the
five-year testing program.

   A Japanese man who allegedly came within two
days of blowing up a Manhattan building avoided suspicion by buying
ingredients for his deadly bombs on a monthlong terrorist shopping
spree to art supply, sporting goods and discount stores in 11
states, documents reveal.
   Yu Kikumura, reputedly a member of the Japanese Red Army who
received terrorist training in Lebanon's Bekka Valley, entered the
United States illegally last March 8 and then made his zigzag,
7,000-mile trek in a used Mazda.
   Court papers show he stayed at motels, bed and breakfast rooms
and campgrounds, his travels apparently financed in part by money
drawn from a Swiss bank account.
   ``He didn't tell jokes, he didn't laugh, in fact, he looked like
a guy with a lot of problems, with a lot of troubles on his mind,''
Carmen Brown, whose Huntington, W.Va., campground was one of the
many places Kikumura stayed during his trip, said in a telephone
interview with The Associated Press.
   His odyssey ended at a New Jersey Turnpike reststop on April 12,
two days before officials said he intended to bomb a Navy recruiting
center housed in a Veterans Administration building in retaliation
for the 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya.
   New Jersey State Trooper Robert Cieplensky said he noticed
Kikumura acting erratically. As Kikumura drove off, Cieplensky
stopped him and found in the back seat a package containing three
bombs _ hollowed-out fire extinguishers filled with gunpowder, lead
shot and with switchs and triggers. He also found a map which
authorities later said showed possible other targets, including
three New York City college campuses.
   ``I would hope that at some point he would have made another
mistake,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney John Lacey, who helped
prosecute the case. ``But based on his experience and background, I
have very little doubt that he would have succeeded in killing
people with those bombs.''
   On Tuesday, Kikumura, claiming the allegations against him were
fabricated, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for explosives and
weapons charges and carrying false documents, including a
passport.Kikumura's attorney, civil rights lawyer William Kunstler,
said an appeal was planned.
   Investigators used receipts found in Kikumura's car to piece
together his movements in the month before his arrest. His travels
took him to roadside motels through America's heartland, across its
colonial byways and into the Bible Belt. The documents show he spent
time in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Michigan,
Illinois, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia and
Pennsylvania.
   Along the way, he bought items such as gas cans, a diet scale,
flash bulbs, electrical wire and tape, cements, epoxy glue and fire
extinguishers.
   ``The materials he bought to make the bombs are most always used
for legitimate purposes,'' Lacey said. ``And when he traveled around
to buy the different materials, it decreased the risk of somebody
piecing together what he was doing.''
   Kikumura's favorite store was K mart, authorities said.
   ``Turn Mr. Kikumura loose near a K mart and a sporting goods
store and in a matter of hours, literally, he can make what was
found in his car today,'' U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. said
during Kikumura's sentencing hearing this week.
   Alito made a rare appearance in court to present the evidence
against Kikumura, who had a record for explosives charges and is
reputedly a member of the notorious Japanese Red Army, a radical
leftist group formed in the 1960s to promote world revolution.
   On May 1, 1986, Kikumura had been arrested at Amsterdam's
Schiphol airport with two pounds of TNT and several bomb detonators.
He spent four months in jail after the courts found that authorities
had conducted an illegal search at the airport.
   His whereabouts over the next few months are sketchy. But from
August 1986 until his arrival at New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport last March 8, he used a stolen and altered
passport to travel through Italy, France and Switzerland,
authorities said.
   Prosecutors also said an informant has provided evidence that
Kikumura spent some time at a terrorist training camp in Lebanon's
Bekka Valley.
   Two days after his arrival in the United States, Kikumura was
sent by a roommate service to the Manhattan apartment of Chris
Brande.
   ``He was quiet and polite,'' Brande, an accountant, told the AP.
``Looking back now I can see a few strange things, like he said he
was a tourist but I never saw a camera.
   ``He didn't look like a terrorist type, whatever that type is. He
just seemed like a nice guy.''
   Kikumura bought a used Mazda 626 at Central Motors in the Bronx
within a week of his arrival in the United States, and he set out on
his tour.
   On March 16, he was in Gloucester, Mass. He traveled west on
March 22 on Interstate 80 through New Jersey and Pennsylvania and
stayed overnight at the Williams House bed and breakfast in Avon
Lake, Ohio. The next night he stayed at Barnicks Bed and Breakfast
in Diamondsdale, Mich.
   The Harrison Hotel in Chicago was his home the night of March 24.
Two days later, he was in Mark Twain's hometown of Hannibal, Mo. He
also stayed March 28 in the Biltmore Hotel in Union City, Tenn., and
on March 29 at Clardy's Guest House in Murfreesboro, Tenn.
   It didn't make his first known bomb-parts purchase, until March
30, when he stopped in an art supply store in Nashville, Tenn., to
buy two cans of aluminum powder.
   The next day he went to K mart in Lexington, Ky., and in two
visits bought gas cans, a diet scale, coffee-maker accessories, a
special glue, contact cement, electrical wire and electrical tape.
   On April 1, he arrived at the Browns' campground.
   Mrs. Brown said she and her husband, Herbert, noticed bruises on
Kikumura's hands and a split lip. Prosecutors theorize he may have
been injured by a slight blast when mixing the highly combustable
powder used in the bombs.
   While in Huntington, Kikumura went to an electronics store and
bought a toggle switch, circuit tester, phone jacks, phone plugs and
wire.
   He left for New York on April 3 and stopped at Smiley's Motel in
Hurricane, W.Va., on his way back to Manhattan.

<HEAD>Error Delays 450,000 Tax Refunds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A human error in running a computer has delayed
450,000 federal tax refunds by a week, but the IRS said Thursday
there is no comparison with the computer problems that made a
disaster of the 1985 filing season.
   ``The situation was uncovered immediately and remedial steps were
taken so that no taxpayers were inconvenienced,'' IRS spokesman
Frank Keith said of the latest problem.
   ``People are going to get their refund checks in the
four-to-six-week time frame that is typical at this time of the
year,'' said Ellen Murphy, IRS director of public affairs. But
checks for those who filed in the second or third week of January
will be mailed Feb. 17, rather than Feb. 10 as had been planned.
   Millions of tax refunds were delayed for several weeks in 1985
because of problems with a new $103 million computer system. Keith
was asked whether taxpayers should be worried that the new problem
might be the first warning of a recurrence.
   ``Absolutely not,'' he said.
   This year, he said, there was no problem with the computer itself
or the instructions fed into it. ``The refund checks were in the
correct amount, the bills that would have been generated were in the
correct amount.
   ``We learned from the 1985 problems and we wanted to make sure
that whatever was needed to be done was done ... that no taxpayer
would receive an erroneous notice,'' Keith said.
   The IRS deliberately delayed mailing the 450,000 refund checks,
as well as any tax-due notices arising from returns filed early this
year, until the human error could be corrected.
   That error was made at the IRS computing center in Martinsburg,
W.Va., where all master files on individual taxpayers are kept and
where refund checks are authorized.
   The problem occurred because the IRS late last year announced
that taxpayers in six states _ Virginia, Indiana, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama and Minnesota _ should file their returns to a
different service center this year in order to even the workload
among the 10 centers where returns are processed.
   Virginia taxpayers, for example, used to file to Memphis, Tenn.;
now, they file to Philadelphia.
   But those changes were not taken into account at the Martinsburg
center. Thus, if a Virginia taxpayer had a question about his or her
account or refund, the computer would have generated a notice
directing the taxpayer to correspond with the Memphis center, rather
than Philadelphia.
   To avoid such erroneous notices, the IRS simply delayed the
checks.
   With the exception of that problem, Ms. Murphy said, the filing
season is going well.
   Through Feb. 3, she said, 8.45 million returns had been filed _
down 7.6 percent from the same time last year _ and 2.75 million had
been processed, an increase of almost 14 percent. The figures are in
line with recent years, when _ for reasons that neither the IRS nor
outside experts can explain _ the number of taxpayers filing early
in the season declined each year.
   Through Jan. 27, the IRS had certified 95,000 refunds totaling
$72 million, an average of about $751 per check. The number of
refunds was down 12.6 percent and the average refund was up 4.2
percent.
   The IRS expects 109 million returns this year and, as in most
years, about 75 percent will qualify for refunds.
   A check of early returns shows many taxpayers who do not itemize
deductions are failing to claim the standard deduction. The agency
will correct that error, but any refund will be delayed.
   Another common error is a failure by a filer _ usually a young
person with a part-time job _ to check a box indicating whether he
or she can be claimed as a dependent by another. Also near the top
of the mistake list are mathematics errors, failure of low-income
working families to claim the earned-income credit, and failing to
use taxable income to calculate taxes owed.

   President Bush and the leaders of the 15
other NATO nations probably will hold a summit in Brussels in May, a
source in the Western alliance said Thursday.
   No final decision has been made on a date or place for the
anticipated summit but the source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said ``May is most likely.''
   Bush has been expected to have an early meeting with other
leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organizations to discuss
pressing NATO issues and mark the alliance's 40th anniversary.
   On a trip through Western Europe, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III will meet in the Belgian capital Feb. 16 with the NATO
secretary-general, Manfred Woerner of West Germany, and
representatives of the member nations, officials said.
   A specific date for the summit probably will be set soon after
Baker's trip, the source said, adding: ``We don't have a signal from
Washington that it's going to be in May,'' but ``we're putting
together ... possible dates that it could be.''
   There has been speculation the summit would take place in London
in early June, when foreign ministers of the NATO countries are
scheduled to meet, but the source said some NATO delegations prefer
alliance headquarters in Brussels as a site, especially because of
the anniversary year.
   The gathering comes at a time when the West must respond to
dramatic changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union has captured
public attention, particularly in Europe, with promises to reduce
Soviet troop strength and military spending.
   His pledges appear have reduced the public perception of the
threat from the East, causing concern in NATO about continued
support for defense spending.

   Lewis F. Powell Jr., a retired Supreme
Court justice, is steadily improving from his bout with pneumonia,
but doctors have not determined when he can leave the hospital, a
spokeswoman said Thursday.
   Powell, 81, is being treated with antibiotics after developing
pneumonia Tuesday.
   ``He's been resting. He's real alert, and he looked great,'' said
Cindy Hamilton, a spokeswoman at Baptist Medical Center.
   Powell also has been exercising by walking in the hospital
corridors.
   The justice, who spent 15 years on the Supreme Court, was in
Jacksonville as a member of a panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals. He complained of dizziness Monday and was taken by
ambulance to the hospital, where he was admitted for an acute
respiratory infection.
   Powell retired from the nation's highest court June 26, 1987,
citing concerns about his health as one reason. He had suffered from
prostate cancer.

   House Speaker Jim Wright said Thursday that he
knew a month ago that the proposed 51 percent congressional pay
raise would be put to a vote, that it was too large and ``wasn't
going to wash,'' but his colleagues wouldn't listen.
   While defending his handling of the issue, the Texas Democrat
also indicated that the House would not return to the politically
sensitive subject anytime soon, not even for the judges or top
federal executives whose increases are linked to congressional pay.
   When asked if the pay issue would resurface, Wright said, ``I
hope not real soon. I can count.''
   The proposed 51 percent pay raise, under heavy public attack,
died Tuesday when the House, by 380-48, and the Senate, by 94-6,
passed legislation rejecting the increase and President Bush swiftly
signed the measure.
   At a news conference, Wright said he tried to convince stubborn
colleagues the proposed raise was too large, and that public
pressure would not let them avoid a vote on the pay plan that had
been set to automatically become law Wednesday.
   On Monday, opponents of raising congressional salaries from
$89,500 to $135,000 won a procedural vote, forcing Wright to
schedule a vote on rejecting the raise before Tuesday's midnight
deadline.
   ``I've known for weeks that ultimately, there would be a vote,''
Wright said. ``I tried to say to my colleagues there would be a
vote. I had known for four weeks that 50 percent wasn't going to
wash.''
   But Wright said legislators weren't willing to listen because,
``if I had called for a vote sooner, members would have said I gave
away their pay raise.''
   Asked if he would have done anything differently, Wright said
that ``I would have probably have done the House a service if I had
been able to prevail on colleagues to see three weeks earlier'' that
letting the raise become law without a vote ``was not going to be
accepted.''
   ``I didn't succeed in that. So be it,'' he said. ``Post-mortems
are not really productive.''
   Before he gave in, Wright had planned to seek a smaller raise
with steps that would have allowed the 51 percent increase take
effect followed by a vote to scale it back to 30 percent the next
day. That plan also called for a vote on eliminating acceptance of
speaking fees.
   But Wright said he knew such a plan was too late and ``wasn't in
the cards'' even before he proposed it.
   ``There was a time when a proposal to do away with honoraria and
reduce the increase to 30 percent was justifiable and would have
been acceptable, but by the time I advocated it, it was too late,''
he said.
   Wright denied that the episode weakened his power, saying members
are assuring him every day ``that this isn't true.''
   The speaker said Bush asked him if he should propose a smaller
increase than the 51 percent and the speaker said he replied, ``I
tried that and it didn't work to well for me.''

   About 170 tons of arms confiscated from a
Danish freighter might have been destined for rebel movements in
Bolivia and Colombia, the Italian news agency ANSA said Thursday.
   Police boarded the Jenstar on Wednesday and seized 5,217 cases of
Czechoslovak rifles, pistols, submachine guns and amunition valued
at about $8.8 million, the agency said.
   Tiziana Parenti, the investigating magistrate assigned to the
case, told ANSA the shipment was believed to be part of a larger
plot to arm revolutionary movements in Bolivia and Colombia.
   The magistrate said the operation may involve shipments worth up
to $29.4 million.
   The agency said police found two manifests on the ship: one was
for Italian authorities and it listed the cargo as machine parts;
the other listed the arms and destinations in South American, ANSA
said.
   The boat brought the cargo from Hamburg, West Germany, to Savona,
where it was to be loaded on another ship and sent to it final
destinations, according to the agency.
   Police arrested six Danish crew members aboard the ship, ANSA
said. Another five suspects _ four Belgians and an Italian _ were
arrested at the Genoa airport, according to the agency. The charges
included illegal transportation of military arms, munitions and
equipment, ANSA said.

<TEXT>
   The Episcopal Church is mustering full pomp and
ceremony to install Barbara Harris as the first woman bishop in a
2,000-year Christian line dating to the apostles.
   The worldwide attention expected for Saturday's events goes far
beyond anything the Episcopal Church usually confronts and reflects
a debate that has simmered within church ranks and now threatens to
spill over into Christianity at large.
   Some 8,300 tickets have already been distributed for the
consecration. Demand has forced church officials to move the
ceremony from St. Paul's Cathedral in Boston to the cavernous Hynes
Convention Center, which has room for spectators, a chorus of 130,
television cameras and a large contingent of journalists.
   Though no one is announcing any last-minute effort to block the
appointment, a good many of the attendees can be expected to hold
their breath when the ritual requires presiding Bishop Edmund
Browning to intone: ``If any of you know any reason why we should
not proceed, let it now be made known.''
   The 58-year-old former head of a left-wing religious publishing
company has been a subject of some controversy within the church
since Sept. 24, when the Episcopal Diocese of Boston elected her
suffragan, or assistant bishop.
   Women have been priests in the Episcopal Church since 1976. But
becoming an bishop is a question of much higher magnitude. Harris
would become the first woman to reach that height in any of the
three major branches of Christianity _ Roman Catholicism, Eastern
Orthodoxy and Anglicanism _ that trace bishops in a direct line back
to the Apostles of Jesus.
   After the election last September, debate quickly ensued across
the country among 118 church committees responsible for confirming
the election.
   A traditionalist faction of the Episcopal Church, led by the
Evangelical and Catholic Mission in Austin, Texas, rallied in
opposition to Harris' elevation. Now, prelates and observers on both
sides of the issue are concerned that the stakes may be even larger
than the unity of the Episcopal Church, which is a branch of
worldwide Anglicanism.
   The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Anglican churches have
been involved for more than a decade in discussions over easing
their centuries-old differences. ``And they have made great
progress,'' said James Solheim, a spokesman for the Boston Episcopal
diocese. ``For Roman Catholics, the idea of a woman standing at the
altar representing Christ is totally unacceptable.''
   Pope John Paul II in December issued what Solheim called
``ominous noises'' about the impending consecration of Harris. The
pope warned of ``painful and deplorable consequences'' of the
Episcopal Church going forward with the consecration of a female
bishop. ``The constant line of tradition, common to all the
churches, cannot be so easily interupted,'' he said.
   ``This has great ecumenical consequences,'' said Bishop Donald
Davies of the Evangelical and Catholic Mission in Austin.
   A female bishop might be acceptable if all of Christianity
approved in an official way, he said. ``But we're a small church. In
taking the leadership in this, we just denigrate the progress we've
made in having communion throughout the world.''
   Barbara Clementine Harris this week was the calm at the center of
the storm, recovering from a head cold on a church retreat. She
could not be reached for comment because she has no access to a
telephone at the retreat, Solheim said.
   Some of the opposition to her elevation stemmed from her
decidedly leftist political views which she conveyed in the
publication, The Witness, issued by the Episcopal Church Publishing
Co. in Philadelphia, where she has been an Episcopal priest since
1980.
   The periodical has published articles supporting homosexual
rights and the Nicaraguan Sandinista government and criticizing the
church for failing to fully bring women into church leadership.
   The Rev. Jerome Politzer, president of the traditionalist Prayer
Book Society in America, described Harris as ``pro-Marxist. Her
writings are snide and sarcastic. She is unfit to be a bishop.''
   Some also have questioned Harris' qualifications because of her
lack of a college degree and full seminary training.
   A black woman and a veteran of the civil rights marches of the
1960s, Harris has been outspoken for civil rights and feminism and
she is unapologetic about her views.
   But at a recent news conference in Boston, Harris sought to ease
concerns by saying her work for the Boston diocese would focus on
sacramental and pastoral duties rather than involvement in political
affairs.

   A gunman firing from a
motorcycle shot and killed a Roman Catholic pedestrian Thursday near
Smithfield Market, a central Belfast square known for sectarian
slayings, police said.
   The Ulster Volunteer Force, an outlawed Protestant group, claimed
responsibility in a telephone call to the British Broadcasting Corp.
   Two helmeted men on a motorcycle rode up to Tony Fusco in a
street off the square, and the motorcycle's passenger fired several
shots from close range, said police Sgt. Michael Glover.
   Fusco, 33, lived in the Falls, a Catholic district in west
Belfast. Police found a motorcycle apparently abandoned by the
assailants in the adjoining Shankill, a Protestant district.
   The Ulster Volunteer Force said Fusco was a member of the mainly
Catholic Irish Republican Army. The outlawed IRA's legal political
wing, Sinn Fein, denied it. Glover said Fusco had no connection with
the security forces.
   Two masked gunmen shot and killed a Catholic worker Jan. 18 in a
store in Smithfield Market, which is situated near the Protestant
and Catholic areas of west Belfast several hundred yards north of
City Hall.
   More than 2,700 people have been killed in nearly 20 years of
political and sectarian violence in the British-ruled province.

<HEAD>Haitians Strike to Demand That Leader Step Down</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Workers closed schools, businesses,
and some public transportation Thursday in a general strike called
by the opposition to demand the resignation of Haitian ruler Lt.
Gen. Prosper Avril.
   It was the second day of the strike, but the government blunted
its impact Wednesday by closing schools and services with a paid
holiday. Thursday was not a holiday.
   The government also ordered the arrests of seven opposition
leaders who called for the strike. By Thursday, there were no
reports that the seven had been arrested.
   Among those sought were Jean-Auguste Mesyeux and Gabriel Miracle,
co-leaders of Haiti's largest union. Their group, the Autonomous
Central of Haitian Workers, has organized two successful general
strikes since November.
   Meanwhile, about 16 politicians met with government
representatives Thursday, the first day of an eight-day forum to
discuss general elections.
   Major opposition leaders Louis Dejoie and Sylvio Claude boycotted
the forum, protesting Avril's failure to exclude supporters of
former dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier.
   They said Haiti's constitution already provides for an
independently appointed Electoral Council and bars Duvalierists from
taking part in elections.
   In attendance were Edouard Francisque and Lamartiniere Honorat,
former officials of the 29-year Duvalier family dictatorship, which
a popular rising overthrew in 1986.
   Avril has pledged to allow free elections but has given no
timetable.
   He came to power in a Sept. 17 coup by rank-and-file soldiers who
ousted former ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, demanding a return to
democratic rule.

   Eight Mariel Cubans ordered deported by special
federal review panels were flown back to their homeland Thursday,
the Justice Department said.
   The Cubans were being flown aboard a government plane from
Birmingham, Ala., to an airport outside Havana, said Joe Krovisky, a
Justice Department spokesman.
   The eight are among 33 who have been ordered deported since
December, when Justice Department panels began reviewing the cases
of 400 Cubans who entered this country illegally during the
so-called Mariel Flotilla of 1980.
   Another 400 or 500 Cubans will be placed on the review list once
they finish serving prison terms.
   Many convicts and mentally ill people were among the 125,000
people who came from Cuba during the Mariel Flotilla.
   The repatriation review boards were set up last year in the wake
of riots by Cuban detainees held at federal prisons in Atlana and
Oakdale, La.
   A total of 23 Cubans have been sent back to Cuba since the review
process resumed in December.
   Repatriation efforts were begin briefly in 1984 but suspended at
the insistence of Cuban President Fidel Castro.
   Krovisky said the Justice Department planned to make flights
every two weeks as each review panel, sitting for that period,
completes its work.
   Three parole and two repatriation panels are schedule to convene
every two weeks, the department said.

   Three Hindus were found guilty of
converting to Christianity, and they were sentenced to one year in
prison by a court in Nepal, the world's only Hindu kingdom, it was
reported Thursday.
   The constitution declares that Nepal is a Hindu state, and
Nepalese law bans converting from Hinduism to any other religion.
   The sentence was announced Wednesday by the district court at
Bhadrapur, 190 miles southeast of Katmandu, according to the
Nepalese news agency RSS.
   Christian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said about
200 Nepalese are awaiting trial on charges of converting from
Hinduism.
   In October, police arrested two foreigners from the London-based
Christian organization Operation Mobilization. They are to stand
trial Feb. 28 on charges of ``preaching Christianity and causing
disturbances to Hinduism.'' If convicted, they could face up to six
years in prison.
   The two, David McBride, 33, of Columbia, Pa., and Mervyn Budd,
26, of London, Ontario, Canada, were being held at Phidim, 150 miles
east of Katmandu.

<HEAD>Hospitals Very Short of Supplies, Nurse Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY B. DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supplies are so short in Veterans
Administration hospitals that nurses are scrounging thee little
souvenir bars of soap and shampoo bottles from hotels to bring to VA
patients, a nurse told Congress on Thursday.
   Supply accounts are frequently raided to pay salaries and avoid
layoffs, an outside medical administrator told the House Veterans
Affairs Committee.
   Claudette Morissey, a nurse at the Brooklyn, N.Y., veterans
hospital and prsident of the Nurses Organization of the Veterans
Administration, said in testimony submitted to the hearing, ``At one
VA hospital in the south, nurses were frustrated by the refusal of
(the) prosthetics (department) to supply wheel chair cushions for
patients on the long term care unit.
   ``The nurses obtained a $25 donation, went to the local
upholstery store and purchased a large foam mattress, and with an
electric knife borrowed from the mother of one of the nurses, cut
the foam to make wheel chair cushions for their patients.''
   She did not identify the hospital, nor the hospital in other
anecdotes:
   ``Nurses in one hospital brought in souvenir hotel soaps and
shampoos for the patients, and in another, brought and cut large
bars of soap in small pieces for patients to use.''
   At her own hospital, she said, ``We cannot properly monitor
diabetic patients when there are no lancets to do finger sticks, no
Chem Sticks for blood samples and no insulin syringes to use to give
insulin if it is needed. This is the situation I have faced over the
past month at my facility and I thank God there has been no crisis
because of it.''
   A Soviet report last week of hospital patients getting AIDS from
unsterilized needles ``is a startling reminded to us in this country
that mistakes can happen when the system starts to cut corners and
workers perform daily under inordinate pressure as we do in the
VA,'' she said.
   At congressional hearings last September, VA officials said they
faced a $600 million to $1 billion shortfall in their $10.54 billion
budget for medical care in the current fiscal year.
   Edward Derwinski, President Bush's nominee for head of the VA and
secretary of veterans affairs when the VA becomes a cabinet
department next month, said Tuesday he had met with Budget Director
Richard Darman.
   Declining to say if he thought a supplemental appropriation is
needed for the current fiscal year, Derwinski said the meeting with
Darman ``didn't result in any figure changes, but I hope it'll
increase his sensitivity.''
   L. Thompson Bowles, vice president for medical affairs at the
George Washington University Medical Center, a member of a VA
advisory committee and a consulting surgeon to two VA hospitals,
said, ``By moving funds from other accounts, the Department of
Medicine and Surgery was able to remain near the congressionally
mandated 194,720 employment level,''
   Kenneth I. Shine, dean of the University of California at Los
Angeles Medical School, told the committee that next year's medical
budget should be $12.42 billion, a 14 percent, or $1.48 billion,
increase over this year's total, instead of the $186 million
increase proposed in President Reagan's budget. Four veterans
organizations have endorsed a similar amount for next year.

<TEXT>
   The spiritual leader of the group believed
holding most of the American hostages in Lebanon said he hopes their
ordeal will end ``shortly,'' according to a letter released Thursday.
   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah wrote to Peggy Say, sister of
American hostage Terry Anderson, ``I hope your human suffering will
end shortly and I promise to do all my best to help you.''
   Anderson, 41, of Lorain, Ohio, was kidnapped March 16, 1985,
while serving as chief Middle East correspondent for the The
Associated Press.
   He is the longest-held hostage in Lebanon among 15 Westerners,
including nine Americans, three Britons, one Irishman, one Italian
and a Belgian.
   Fadlallah, 53, is the spiritual leader of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God. It is made up of Shiite Moslem
fundamentalists and is believed to be an umbrella group for
underground factions that have claimed the abduction of most
Westerners missing since 1985.
   Mrs. Say, who is in Damascus to meet with Syrian officials
cooperating in the effort to obtain the hostages' freedom, gave
reporters here a copy of the message she received recently.
   Fadlallah's letter, dated Dec. 31, said, ``We hope the
governments involved will take into account the humanitarian aspect
of the hostages issue and the grief of their relatives.
   ``We, as religious people, will strive hard to solve this tragic
problem with respect for the good ties which link us to the American
people.''
   Syrian officials said they would arrange a meeting between Mrs.
Say and Fadlallah, now in Iran, if he transits Damascus on his way
back to Lebanon.
   ``We would like to emphasize that regardless of the rulers'
interests, our relations with other peoples should be friendly and
based on good faith,'' Fadlallah said in his letter.
   The religious leader, who has disavowed any responsibility for
the kidnappings, wrote in response to letters from Mrs. Say, the
Journalists' Committee to Free Terry Anderson and other humanitarian
and media groups in the United States.

<HEAD>Brown Says He's Committed to South's Importance to Party</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Incoming Democratic Party chairman Ronald H.
Brown, moving swiftly to calm dissenters to his election, told
Southern party officials Thursday he is ``absolutely committed'' to
the region's importance.
   ``The South is crucial to the future of the Democratic Party,''
Brown told a meeting of the Southern Caucus of the Democratic
National Committee.
   On the eve of his unopposed election to the chairmanship, Brown
preached unity and the importance of reaching out to all elements of
the party.
   Many southerners opposed his election because of past ties to
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and Jesse Jackson.
   ``I say let's give him a chance,'' said John Baker, chairman of
the Alabama Democratic Party, who once threatened to boycott the
national party if Brown became chairman.
   ``A lot of Democrats feel excluded, feel rejected,'' said Baker.
``They feel there's no room in the party for them because they are
moderate or conservative in philosophy.''
   The Alabama chairman said it would be ``helpful, first of all, if
he'd (Brown) acknowledge that we've got that problem.''
   A 47-year-old partner in one of the capital's largest and most
politically active law firms, Patton, Boggs and Blow, Brown will be
the first black to head a major political party.
   He will succeed Paul G. Kirk Jr., whose election four years ago
was opposed by many southerners concerned about his service as a top
aide to Kennedy.
   But Kirk ended his term with high marks for unifying the party
and many of the Democrats who had opposed him in 1985 pleaded with
him to seek re-election. But Kirk turned them down and is returning
to his law practice.
   Brown made the rounds of regional caucuses and also spoke to the
Association of State Democratic Chairs.
   He told the state party leaders, ``We've got a difficult job
ahead, we've got tough adversaries. ...They don't care much about
truth or about decency.''
   Addressing the concerns of Southerners, Brown said, ``I don't
want to be chairman of a party that writes off any region of the
country.''

   A fire broke out during taping at a
television studio in the south, killing at least 36 people and
injuring one of India's best-known actors and at least 54 other
people, news reports said Thursday.
   The fire on Wednesday destroyed the studio near Bangalore, 1,100
miles south of New Delhi, United News of India said.
   The studio was filled with actors and technicians making a
television show at the time. The injured included Sanjay Khan, a
well-known actor and director, who received burns over 60 percent of
his body, the news agency said.
   There was no word on the cause of the fire.
   In Bombay on Thursday, a large fire swept through the Sahar
international airport, disrupting flight schedules for more than six
hours, officials said.
   No casualties were reported in that blaze, which began in some
duty-free shops in the airport terminal building, a senior airport
official said on condition of anonymity. The entire airport was
evacuated, officials said.
   There was no word on what started the fire.
   At least 20 firefighters fought the fire for six hours, news
agencies said. There was no immediate report on damages.
   Flights could not land until the fire was brought under control
because safety regulations require that firefighters be on standby
for all landings in case of emergencies.

   CBS' ``Lonesome Dove'' wound up 14th on the list
of all-time highest-rated network miniseries.
   CBS estimated, based on figures from the A.C. Nielsen Co., that
about 40 million viewers tuned in each night of the four-night
Western epic that revived network television, at least for the week.
   CBS Entertainment President Kim LeMasters got a tip of the hat _
literally _ from competitors at an industry luncheon here Thursday.
Brandon Tartikoff of NBC and Brandon Stoddard of ABC presented
LeMasters with a cowboy hat at the annual International Radio and
Television Society newsmakers luncheon at the Waldorf Astoria.
   ``Lonesome Dove'' had an average, four-night rating of 26.1 and a
39 share, far above the below-30 shares that network had guaranteed
to advertisers, delighting the third-place network and contributing
to combined three-network shares that soared into the 80s on some
nights. The season-to-date average for the three networks had been
68.
   Each rating point represents 904,000 households with televisions.
The share is a percentage of sets in use.
   The top three network miniseries remain ``Roots,'' ``The Thorn
Birds'' and ``Winds of War,'' all of which aired on ABC.
   ``Lonesome Dove'' became CBS' third-highest-rated miniseries
behind ``Master of the Game,'' which ranks 11th on the all-time-high
list, and ``Scruples,'' at 13th. The list does not include two-part
movies.

   ``The central California maneuver area will allow the units to

<HEAD>Neighbors of Children's Hospital Critical of Helicopter Use</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Helicopters serving one of the few Midwest
hospitals to perform heart transplants on children are drawing flak
from neighbors who say the aircraft are overused and pose a
potential safety hazard.
   However, a hospital official countered Thursday that Children's
Memorial Hospital has taken great pains to keep the helicopters'
disturbance to a minimum since it began using them a couple of years
ago.
   Herbert Malkind, planning committee chairman of the Park West
Community Association, said the hospital has failed to obey zoning
laws and an agreement with community groups to use the helicopters
only for emergencies, trips longer than 40 miles and for its own
staff.
   Malkind testified Wednesday before a hearing officer gathering
material on the hospital's application to be certified as a
pediatric heart transplant center by the Illinois Health Facilities
Planning Authority.
   ``The helistop is controversial in Lincoln Park from the
standpoint of safety concerns and noise problems,'' Malkind said of
the surrounding affluent North Side neighborhood.
   ``We think it's a very good hospital, we really do,'' Frank
Giarrizzo, a Lincoln Park resident who also attended the hearing,
said Thursday. ``We just say, `Live up to the agreements, follow the
laws.'''
   The suggestion that Children's has violated its agreements or the
law is ``totally untrue,'' said Edward Horner, president of the
Children's Memorial Foundation and a representative of the hospital
at the hearing.
   Because donor hearts remain viable for just four hours outside
the body, they must be flown into Children's, requiring more
helicopter flights, he said.
   However, he said the hospital goes out of its way to keep
helicopter use to a minimum and noted that the total number of
helicopter landings and takeoffs actually dropped last year compared
to 1987, from 201 to 195.
   There is no restriction on the number of helicopter flights
allowed, Horner said.
   Children's has performed five heart transplants since its first
one last May. ``Our estimate is we do not believe more than 12 of
these (transplants) could or would be done a year, based on the
difficulty of getting donor hearts,'' Horner added.
   He said quarterly reports on helicopter use, distributed to
community groups, clearly reflect the hospital's proper use of the
vehicles.
   ``We took extraordinary efforts to involve the community'' when
the helicopter service began, he said Thursday. Sound testing
equipment was placed in homes and businesses and community hearings
were held to address safety and noise, said Horner.
   He said he believes only a few people are complaining, and that
they are not representative of most of the neighborhood.
   Giarrizzo said area residents do not oppose certification for
Children's, but believe the hospital should be required to tighten
up its use of helicopters before it is granted official status as a
transplant center.
   In addition to the many homes around the hospital, a school and a
church are right across the street, Giarrizzo said.
   Safety concerns center on the hospital's use of twin-engine
helicopters, which carry more fuel than the single-engine
helicopters Children's originally agreed to use and could presumably
cause greater damage in the event of a crash, he said.
   The hospital's bid for certification ``has very little to do with
helicopters,'' said Horner.
   ``It has a whole lot to do with the societal obligation of
Children's, which transcends Lincoln Park. It's a societal
obligation that an institution of this ilk must fulfill.''
   Children's cardiology service treats about 4,000 young people a
year, about 10 percent of whom require heart surgery of some sort,
making the hospital one of the largest of its kind in the country,
Horner said.
   The board of the planning authority is to act on Children's
application for certification at its March 2 meeting, said authority
executive secretary Ray Passeri.

<TEXT>
   A new campaign by the Plymouth division of
Chrysler Motors to promote the ``scenic byways'' program in national
forests got the green light Thursday at the Agriculture Department.
   A three-way partnership was worked out with the California-based
Forest Education Foundation, Plymouth and USDA to help upgrade
designated scenic stretches of highways into major tourist
attractions.
   F. Dale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service, said the 191
million acres of national forests _ if gathered in one place, an
area larger than Texas _ offer ``some of America's most spectacular
scenery.''
   ``This partnership will allow us to showcase the beauty of these
areas for the American public, nearly half of whom spend part of
their leisure time driving for enjoyment,'' he said.
   Robertson told a news conference the venture is the first major
national cooperative effort undertaken by his agency with a private
corporation. The agreement is for three years and could be renewed.
   The scenic byway program began last year with the designation of
a 26-mile stretch of U.S. Highway 64 in southeastern Tennessee. So
far, 30 have been designated, covering 1,676 miles, and others are
being identified for addition to the system.
   One goal is to upgrade the highway areas to make them more useful
and entertaining for motorists. Projects can include interpretive
signs, improved road maintenance, pullouts at scenic overlooks,
parking areas, some rest area facilities and short-loop walking
trails.
   According to an information folder by the non-profit foundation,
Plymouth will publicize the byways through ``an ambitious
promotional program which includes 20 exhibitions at heavily
attended regional consumer shows, discreet signage in 3,500 Plymouth
dealerships, and in 700 high-traffic retail locations and ski
areas.''
   The promotion also includes a national sweepstakes with a
Plymouth as grand prize, which was on display in USDA's indoor
patio, a 4-door mid-size Acclaim with a window sticker listing all
the options and a price of $14,224.
   Robertson said the Forest Service's involvement with Plymouth and
the foundation is strictly on behalf of the byways program and that
the company ``will not be using our logo'' on any of its products or
is receiving any endorsement by the agency.
   But Robertson and Pat Smorra, general marketing manager for
Plymouth, dodged reporters' questions about details of the financial
arrangement between the agency and the company.
   Smorra said that he was ``not announcing the exact dollars we're
putting into (the program), but it is extensive in terms of
communication efforts, as well as promotional efforts.''
   Robertson said the budget proposed for the Forest Service in the
1990 fiscal year that will begin Oct. 1 calls for $1.5 million for
``challenge cost-share projects,'' which includes the byways program.
   ``So we would anticipate at least that amount in 1990 _ and
perhaps some more of our budget _ going into it,'' he said.
   The funds call for matching dollars, at least, from approved
participants to carry out the cost-share projects.
   ``There is some up-front cash from Plymouth, but I'm not free to
say (how much) right now,'' Robertson said.

   Authorities on Thursday
found the cockpit voice recorder of a chartered U.S. jetliner that
slammed into a mountain and killed all 144 people aboard, and they
recovered the remains of all but two of the dead.
   Rescuers called off the search for the two bodies still missing,
saying it would be impossible to find them on the heavily forested
slopes of Pico Alto mountain where the jet crashed Wednesday.
   Antonio Alves of the Civilian Aviation Authority said it was
hoped the recorder would help explain why the pilot steered the
Boeing 707 directly into the mountain while trying to land in a fog.
The seven-member American crew and the 137 passengers _ Italian
tourists headed to a Caribbean vacation _ were killed.
   In Lisbon, Cmdr. Jose Pastor of the aviation authority said the
pilot, Capt. Leon Daugherty, had acknowledged the airport control
tower's authorization of a safety altitude of 3,000 feet during the
landing approach.
   Pastor said the plane struck the mountain at an altitude of about
1,700 feet.
   ``There was no _ repeat no _ communication of an emergency
landing request by the pilot,'' he said. Earlier reports indicated
the pilot may have asked to make an emergency landing.
   Alves said it appeared the aircraft had been on the proper course
to land. It was to refuel on Santa Maria island before continuing on
to the Dominican Republic.
   Alves said the cockpit voice recorder had been recovered, but the
flight data recorder, which contains information on the aircraft's
flight parameters, had not yet been found.
   Jose Martins Freitas, head of the Azores rescue service, said he
didn't believe it was possible to find anything more remains at the
crash site on the slippery, dense slopes of the 1,794-foot Pico
Alto, the highest point on the island. Rescuers found 50 bodies on
Wednesday.
   The smell of oil hung in the damp air, and a light rain fell on
debris that included playing cards, a book of fairy tales and
vacation clothing, still neatly folded.
   Members of a six-man team from the U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board, including representatives of Boeing and the Federal
Aviation Administration, were expected to arrive to help with the
investigation.
   The jet was owned by Independent Air Corp. of Smyrna Tenn., which
was expected to send representatives to Lisbon for talks with
aviation officials.
   The 20-year-old jetliner had a relatively low number of flight
hours and no history of serious problems, company president A.L.
Pittman said. The craft, one of two Boeing 707s the company owned,
had logged 12,500 cycles, or takeoffs and landings, and fewer than
50,000 hours in the air.
   Jack Barker, a spokesman for the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration, agreed the figures were not excessive. He said
Independent Air was fined $18,000 in an FAA enforcement action in
1984, but he said it was not possible to learn why immediately.
   The mayor of Vila do Porto, Jose Humberto Chaves, said the FAA
checks the airport, used primarily as a mid-Atlantic refueling stop,
every six months and that an average of three flights a day stop
there. Santa Maria is about 750 miles from the Portuguese mainland.
   The airport, reportedly the largest in the Azores, has no radar
but uses an instrument landing system to guide pilots.
   The remains of the dead were being moved from a makeshift hanger
at the airport to freezers at a food processing plant in Vila do
Porto to await the arrival of an Italian Air Force C-130 transport
plane carrying coffins from Pisa, Italian investigating magistrate
Andrea Vardano said.
   There was no immediate information on the identification of the
remains of the crew members or when they would be transferred to the
United States.
   The seven crew members were identified as: Daugherty, 41, of
Nashville, Tenn; Sammy Adcock, 36, of Nashville, 1st officer; Jorge
Gonzalez, 34, Rex, Ga., the flight engineer; and flight attendants
Yvette Murray, 26, of Marietta, Ga., Angela Urban, 24, West Palm
Beach, Fla.; Helen Ziegler, 45, Warner Robins, Ga. and Sabrina
Cromarty, of Atlanta.
   Italian Embassy secretary Anna d'Angelo said a memorial service
for victims was scheduled Sunday in Lisbon.

   A four-month drought that has dried up fresh
water reserves will keep its grip on northern Spain at least 10 more
days, a forecaster said Thursday.
   The drought, caused by a persistent high-pressure zone that has
affected much of Europe, has reduced rainfall in northern Spain to
between 25 percent and 35 percent of normally dry levels in the last
four months.
   It has also delayed germination of some grain crops.
   The chairman of the National Meteorological Institute, Manuel
Bautista Perez, said a 10-day forecast predicts light rains will
stop this weekend and no more rain is in sight during the period.

   Jesse Jackson flatly denied Thursday any
interest in running for mayor of the District of Columbia and said
he would never move to unseat Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr.
   ``I've expressed no interest in the job,'' Jackson said after
leading an anti-drug rally at a city high school. ``Under no
condition would I run against Marion Barry.''
   Asked later if he would run if Barry decided not to seek
reelection in 1990, Jackson said, ``I have expressed no desire to be
mayor.''
   Instead, Jackson said he plans to continue taking his anti-drug
message to school children around the country and press the Bush
administration on its promise to make fighting drugs a top priority.
   Jackson, who owns a home here, has been mentioned as a possible
mayoral candidate since December, when Barry's repeated visits to
the hotel room of a drug suspect triggered the worst political
crisis in Barry's 10 years as mayor.
   Recent polls show Barry's popularity has dropped and remains low
since a federal grand jury began probing his ties to the drug
suspect, former city employee Charles Lewis.
   Barry has not yet said publicly if he will seek another term.
   Speculation over Jackson's possible candidacy grew after he said
in early January he was worried about Barry's health. The mayor also
said that the two had a ``moving, tearful'' prayer session after
Jackson telephoned him from Africa.
   Jackson also refused to comment when asked Thursday whether he
was still concerned about Barry's health and personal habits.
   During his speech, Jackson made no mention of Barry's troubles,
and characterized his formal civil rights ally as a close personal
friend.
   Barry, who arrived for the rally about 15 minutes late, was
greeted with a mixture of cheers and catcalls from the 1,000
students in the school's auditorium. By contrast, Jackson received a
standing ovation.

<HEAD>Democrats, Republicans Dividing on Tower</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats said Thursday that Defense
Secretary-designate John Tower's nomination will rise or fall on the
answers to outstanding questions, but Republicans rallied to his
side, one complaining of a ``feeding frenzy'' of allegations.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, the Armed Services Committee chairman who has said
he would formally oppose the nomination if a vote were held now,
said he'd be ready to work with Tower if the confirmation goes
through, no matter how he himself had voted.
   However, Nunn, D-Ga., also renewed his public doubts, saying,
``There are questions that still have not been answered to my
satisfaction. I do not foreclose the possibility that there may be
satisfactory answers ... but I have not received them yet,''
   Nunn has delayed a committee vote on the nomination at least
until Feb. 21 _ the Senate will be in recess until then _ so the FBI
can review allegations of a financial nature against the former
Texas senator. Other questions involve Tower's use of alcohol, Nunn
said.
   His position was echoed by several other Democrats on the
20-member Armed Services Committee which Tower once headed.
   One of them, Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., said, ``I told Sen.
Nunn that my instincts are very much like his: If the vote were held
tomorrow, I could not vote for Sen. Tower.''
   Republicans, meanwhile, hurried to Tower's defense.
   ``What bothers me is there is a feeding frenzy here,'' said Sen.
Trent Lott, R-Miss. ``I am worried that we begin to judge this
nomination on the weight of the allegations instead of the weight of
the evidence. ... Ninety-eight percent of this stuff is totally
unfounded.''
   Republican Sens. Pete Wilson of California, Malcolm Wallop of
Wyoming and John McCain of Arizona also commented in favor of Tower.
   And the White House also pressed Vice President Dan Quayle into
service, telephoning senators on Tower's behalf.
   David Beckwith, Quayle's spokesman, said the vice president, a
former member of the committee, called about a half-dozen members
from each party to ``assure the senators that (President) Bush was
standing behind'' his nominee.
   Nunn called the lengthy review of Tower's personal and
professional life ``painful,'' but said if the Senate approves him,
``I for one will be leading the way to try to work with him,
whatever my vote may end up being.''
   The FBI's background inquiry centers on contributions to one of
Tower's Senate campaigns by a defense contractor now under
investigation in the Pentagon procurement probe, code-named
``Operation Ill Wind,'' according to an administration official who
spoke on condition he remain anonymous.
   But the official said there is no evidence of wrongdoing by Tower.
   Records on file at the Federal Election Commission show that in
June 1983 Tower received a $500 campaign contribution from Charles
F. Gardner, a retired Unisys Corp. employee under investigation in
``Ill Wind,'' an investigation of alleged corruption in the
Pentagon's $150-billion-year purchasing system.
   Gardner's donation to the Tower campaign was within the $1,000
limit for individual contributions. Telephone calls to Gardner's
home were unanswered Thursday.
   Also Thursday, Nunn said he was upset at having to take the blame
for delaying the Tower vote, a postponement he said was made at the
request of White House counsel C. Boyden Gray.
   ``On the one hand, we're being told to wait because there is a
serious allegation initiated by the administration; on the other
hand, we're being told that we should vote immediately or that we're
being criticized for bringing up new allegations. ... So that is a
little frustrating.''
   B.Jay Cooper, a White House spokesman, said Bush wanted a vote as
soon as possible, but realized that was impossible until the FBI
report was finished.
   Since Bush selected Tower, the ex-senator has been dogged by
allegations and rumors that he was a womanizer and excessive
drinker, which Tower denies.
   None of the previous allegations, some spawned by his ex-wife
Lilla Burt Cummings and most checked out by the FBI over the past
two months, pose a problem to Tower's nomination, White House
officials say.
   But Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.Mex., said there was ``no question''
the delay ``is hurting his prospects.''
   Democratic Sens. Carl Levin of Michigan, Richard Shelby of
Alabama and James Exon of Nebraska have also expressed reservations
about voting for Tower until they see the FBI's completed report.
   Lott acknowledged that Tower is not ``Snow White'' when it comes
to drinking alcohol, but said, ``I'm convinced he's not an
alcoholic, that he does not now have a drinking problem.'' Tower has
said he drinks modestly, usually a little wine.
   A number of senators declined to talk about the Tower nomination,
including Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who served with Tower in the
Senate for 24 years.

<HEAD>U.N. Observers Say Cementing Iran-Iraq Truce is Slow Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.N. military observers trying to cement
a fragile cease-fire between Iran and Iraq say rival forces still
glare at each other from less than 25 yards away in some parts of
the front.
   The peacekeepers constantly patrol the tense front lines, which
stretch from the snowy Kurdistan mountain in the north to the
southern deserts. They travel on foot or in military vehicles
painted white.
   ``The temperature in the north today was minus 31 Centrigrade,''
said Lt. Col. John Fisher, a New Zealander with the U.N. Iran-Iraq
Military Observer Group in the southern sector of the 730-mile front
between the neighboring nations. ``But here in the south, it was 31
plus. In the north, our observers operate on skis or snowshoes.''
   He said the process of cementing the cease-fire is slow work.
   ``We're still involved in negotiations with both sides about
disengagement,'' said Fisher.
   In the six months since the Aug. 20 U.N.-sponsored cease-fire
took effect, the U.N. observers have negotiated with both sides to
achieve a buffer zone up to 1\-mile wide, Fisher told a group of
foreign correspondents Wednesday.
   The U.N. observers' base camp, which comprises neat rows of
portable cabins pained white, is about 25 miles south of Ahvaz,
capital of Iran's oil-rich Khuzestan province and one of the most
heavily damaged regions during the war.
   A long drive through the region indicated that life is generally
back to normal in the region.
   Ahvaz, a sprawling market town and oil center, bustled during the
day. At night, its wide tree-lined avenues were ablaze with
thousands of colored lights strung from lamp posts and buildings for
the 10-day celebrations marking the 10th anniversary of the Islamic
revolution.
   In the flat, dusty countryside near the front, women tilled and
watered the fields while men repaired war-damaged buildings or built
new houses to replace those lost in heavy Iraqi bombing.
   In the area around the small town of Susangerd, once occupied by
Iraqi soldiers, Iran's special Construction Crusade brigades were
busy. Helped by villagers, the teams of bearded young men of the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps were digging new irrigation
canals or extending existing ones with earth-moving machinery.
   The concrete canals, which could serve as anti-tank ditches if
fighting breaks out again, run for miles along the border.
   Despite the cease-fire, both armies still have large forces along
the cease-fire line.
   Fisher acknowledged that in some stretches, the rival forces are
still only 25 yards apart.
   He also said truce violations have occurred as reported.
   ``On the whole,'' he added, ``it's been very quiet. I see no
reason why it shouldn't continue like this.''
   He declined comment on a statement by Iranian Foreign Minister
Ali Akbar Velayati that the Iraqis recently seized 39 square miles
of Iranian territory.
   The Iranians say the Iraqis still occupy a total of more than 380
square miles of their territory.
   With U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar striving to
break the deadlock in the talks aimed at a permanent settlement,
Fisher commented: ``The future is in the hands of the politicians.''
   The Iranians have said that resuming talks that broke down in
November was futile unless Iraq withdraws from Iranian soil. Iraq
rejects any preconditions.
   The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday extended the U.N.
observers' mandate for another six months. It repeated its calls for
Iran and Iraq to withdraw their forces to the pre-war border, one of
the key provisions of the cease-fire resolution passed in July 1987.
   At least 1 million people were killed or wounded in the war,
which began with an Iraqi invasion in September 1980 after several
border skirmishes. Some estimates of the dead alone surpass 1
million, and the economic cost totals hundreds of billions of
dollars.
   Fisher said new officers have been arriving to replace those in
the 409-member U.N. force from 26 countries.
   Diplomats in Baghdad reported Wednesday that 10 officers from
Iran and 10 from Iraq will meet in a no-man's land in the central
sector this month in an effort to advance the cease-fire provisions.

<HEAD>UNITA Envoy Seeking More U.S. Weapons, Raises Doubts About Cuban
Pullout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An envoy for the rebels fighting the Angolan
government said Thursday he is seeking additional U.S. anti-aircraft
and anti-tank missiles to combat a predicted offensive by
Cuban-backed troops.
   Tony da Costa Fernandes, who holds the rank of brigadier general
in the Union for the Total Independence of Angola, also urged the
United States to improve the monitoring of Cuban troop pullout from
Angola against any attempts by Cuba to cheat.
   Fernandes said at a news conference that he was ``satisfied with
the meetings'' he has had with U.S. officials about his
organization's requests.
   But he also criticized parts of the U.S.-sponsored agreement
signed last December that calls for the pullout of all Cuban troops
from Angola and grants independence to neighboring Namibia from
South African rule.
   ``There are flaws in the agreement that are not of our liking,''
he said.
   Fernandes urged the United States to use ``sophisticated means''
to monitor the troop withdrawal, claiming that Cuba had sent in
fresh troops to replace some of the 3,000 who were pulled out under
the agreement last month.
   He said there were no accurate figures for Cuban troops, who have
been helping the Marxist Angolan government since it gained
independence from Portugal in 1975. Troop estimates from a variety
of sources have ranged from between 50,000 and 60,000.
   Under the agreement, Cuba has promised to provide accurate
figures by April 1, once the 90-member U.N. observer group is in
place. The commander of the force, Brazilian Gen. Pericles Ferreira
Gomes, says his 10-nation group will rely on Angolan and Cuban
figures during the withdrawal.
   But Fernandes said that could lead to cheating. He said the
27-month pullout timetable means Cuban troops will remain in Angola
one year after Namibian independence, giving Cuba a chance to send
some of the troops to its ally Namibia.
   Based on troop movements and weapon stockpiling, Fernandes
predicted that Cuban-backed Angolan troops would launch two or three
offensives against UNITA in southern Angola between May and July,
before the Aug. 1 deadline for the Cubans to move northward of the
15th parallel.
   He said UNITA needs long-range artillery pieces, anti-aircraft
and anti-tank missiles. The United States already provides UNITA
with shoulder-fired Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and TOW anti-tank
missiles as part of a covert aid package estimated at $15 million
annually.
   Fernandes said UNITA needs more arms because the Soviets recently
delivered to Angola 12 Cuban-flown MiG-25 fighter jets and some
Mi-35 helicopter gunships.
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, says
Fernandes met with several people in the State Department but she
declined to elaborate. ``We provide appropriate and adequate
assistance to UNITA,'' she said, but said policy bans discussion of
covert aid.
   Much of UNITA's arsenal, which is mostly of Soviet origin, was
brought in through South African-controlled territory. But this has
stopped under terms of the tripartite agreement, along with the $80
million South African annual aid package, he said.
   In a separate interview, Fernandes said UNITA had ``increased the
capability of all airfields'' to accommodate long-range aircraft,
indicating that these bases would be used to resupply the
organization now that its land lines have been blocked.
   He also said UNITA has a two-to-three year stock of military
equipment it received through South Africa and from three African
countries which he declined to name.
   Despite reports to the contrary, UNITA enjoys ``moral and
diplomatic support'' from about 15 other African states, he added.
   At the news conference, Fernandes said he had asked the United
States to send a signal to several African nations, such as Senegal
and Kenya, of support for a dialogue between UNITA and the Angolan
government.
   Such a signal would spur these governments to put pressure on
Angola to negotiate a cease-fire and power-sharing agreement with
the rebels, he said.
   UNITA will not accept a government offer for clemency because
``we are not criminals,'' Fernandes said, preferring to increase its
military struggle to place additional pressure on the government to
negotiate.

   Child care experts Thursday criticized
President Bush's proposed $1,000 child care tax credit as being too
low and insufficient to address the range of problems faced by most
parents.
   ``It's really irrelevant to the child care needs of the United
States,'' said Edward F. Zigler, director of the Bush Center in
Child Development and Social Policy at Yale University.
   Zigler, speaking as the House Labor and Education Committee
opened a series of hearings on child care, called the proposal ``a
non-solution.''
   ``And the amount of money is too low. In an era where child care
costs $3,000 and $4,000 a year, $1,000 doesn't do much for that,''
said W. Norton Grubb, a professor of education at the University of
California at Berkeley.
   The committee estimates full-time child care costs at an average
$3,000 annually per child. That means a family with two children, in
which both parents work at minimum wage, spends more than half its
income for child care.
   Zigler, a strong proponent of school-based day-care, said the
Bush proposal doesn't address the obstacles faced by single-working
mothers or move to eliminate the ``two-tier'' care system he said is
developing between low-income families and others who can afford
private care.
   Grubb said Bush's failure to include a system of regulation in
the proposal would result in poor families spending the money for
other needs.
   ``The money in that proposal is not restricted to child care.
Most of the funds in that proposal, if enacted, would not go for
child care. They would go for food, housing, utilities, clothing and
other necessities like that,'' said Grubb.
   Deborah Phillips, a University of Virginia professor of
psychology, told the panel the proposal doesn't address the quality
of day care. She said quality should not be sacrificed because
government policy frames it ``as a luxury issue in child care.''
   Meanwhile, Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, ranking Republican on the
Finance Committee, said he will introduce a bill to expand existing
child care tax credits for families with incomes under $25,000 and
assist states in improving current programs.
   Packwood's proposal would provide a maximum tax credit of $960
for one child and $1,920 for two or more children. The credit would
be fully refundable and could be made available through payroll
withholdings.
   Current law provides for tax savings of $720 for one child and
$1,440 for two or more children and it is not refundable.

   It's been more than a year since the last State
of the Union report to Congress but President Bush's address to a
joint session Thursday night was billed merely as a speech about his
budget priorities.
   The Constitution requires that the president ``shall from time to
time give to the Congress information of the State of the Union and
recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge
necessary and expedient.''
   The last State of the Union address to Congress was given by
Ronald Reagan on Jan. 25, 1988. At the time, the White House said it
was the last State of the Union address Reagan would make i person
but that he would deliver a written report before leaving office in
January 1989.
   As it turned out, Reagan did not prepare a written State of the
Union report. Instead, Reagan gave what was called a farewell
address from the Oval Office that was broadcast to the nation last
month.
   Discussing Bush's address, ``We do not consider this a State of
the Union address because it's largely focused on the budget and not
the State of the World affairs,'' said White House deputy press
secretary B. Jay Cooper.
   Despite the White House disclaimer, the House and Senate last
week adopted a resolution ``providing for a joint session of
Congress to receive a message from the president on the State of the
Union.''
   Although there has not been an official State of the Union
address in more than a year, Cooper noted there have been three
major presidential addresses, including Reagan's farewell, Bush's
inaugural speech and Bush's budget address.

   The nation's orange harvest for the 1988-89
season is estimated at about 215 million boxes, virtually unchanged
from the previous forecast a month ago but 7 percent more than last
season, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The Florida crop, based on Feb. 1 indications, was estimated at
150 million boxes, unchanged from last month but 9 percent more than
in 1987-88.
   California production was forecast at 61 million boxes, the same
as in January but 4 percent more than a year ago. The Arizona crop
was forecast at 2 million boxes, unchanged from January and up 10
percent from last season. The Texas harvest, at 1.85 million boxes,
was indicated at 6 percent more than the January forecast and up 29
percent from 1987-88.

   The Soviet Union has bought another 600,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, the Agriculture
Department said Thursday.
   Christopher E. Goldthwait, acting general sales manager for the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was part
of an authorization of more than 2 million tons under the Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Goldthwait said the wheat is for shipment in March. Counting some
left over from a previous EEP arrangement and 2 million tons
authorized Jan. 25, the Soviets have more than 1.4 million tons
still available under the program.
   With the latest sale, the Soviet Union has bought about 2.6
million tons of wheat for delivery in the sixth year of a long-term
supply agreement, which was extended last fall to run through Dec.
31, 1990.
   A metric tons is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 600,000 tons are equal to about 22 million bushels
worth around $90 million at recent U.S. farm prices.
   The EEP arrangement lets private exporters sell wheat and other
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in
order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   Sales for delivery in the sixth year of the agreement also
included about 10.2 million tons of corn, along with 450,000 tons of
soybeans, 1.4 million tons of soybean meal, and 508,900 tons of
grain sorghum.
   Goldthwait said the 600,000 tons of wheat were sold by Ferruzzi,
USA Inc., 100,000 tons; Continental Grain Co.a, 250,000; Louis
Dreyfus Corp., 200,000; and Central States Enterprises Inc., 50,000.
   The companies will get subsidy of $23.01 per ton, or about 63
cents per bushel under the EEP arrangement.

<HEAD>Dukakis Campaign Has Yet to Report Final Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis' presidential campaign has not
yet filed federal reports covering more than $3.1 million in
expenses incurred during the final month of last year's race for the
White House, aides to the Massachusetts governor said Thursday.
   Jack Corrigan, a former campaign aide to Dukakis who now works in
the governor's office, said expenses were not reported because the
money went out in the form of vouchers that allowed staffers to
withdraw cash, and the campaign's accountants were awaiting the
documents needed to report what the money bought.
   Because of the pace of events in the closing weeks of the
campaign, not all of the paperwork has made its way through,
Corrigan said.
   ``The events of the last month are not reflected,'' he said in a
telephone interview from Boston.
   According to the report filed Feb. 2 at the FEC, Dukakis had more
than $3.9 million on hand with nearly $1.3 million in unpaid debts,
indicating that the campaign had a surplus of some $2.6 million.
   However, Corrigan said the report did not include more than $3.1
million in vouchers that were paid but not listed because the
supporting documents were not yet available. Figured with the money
owed to the campaign and the cash on hand, the campaign should wind
up within $3,500 of being broke, he said.
   The 1984 presidential campaign of Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, was
fined by the Federal Election Commission for failing to report
expenses in a timely manner during that campaign, according to FEC
records.
   An attorney for the Dukakis campaign, Carol Darr, said she would
look into the current matter and ``we will correct it immediately''
if anything is wrong. ``We have been extremely careful all along,''
she said.
   Following an audit of the Glenn campaign, the election commission
charged it with violating the law for failing to report $312,495 in
expenses in a timely manner. Last year, the Glenn campaign agreed to
pay a $30,000 fine, a relatively large sum to be levied by the FEC,
but that also included penalties for other related violations.
   Although the commission has told campaigns that using bank drafts
is an acceptable practice, it has warned them against taking too
long to report the expenses.
   ``Draft transactions are reported in the period in which the
draft is paid by the bank,'' the commission said in a manual
provided for presidential campaigns.
   Ms. Darr said she was not familiar with the commisison ruling in
the Glenn case or the warning in the manual on bank drafts.
   ``Stuff like this is very technical,'' she said.

   A high school senior was in critical
condition Thursday, the day after police said her distraught
boyfriend poured gasoline over her head and set her on fire.
   ``She is burned pretty badly from the waist up,'' said police
Capt. Joe E. Durr.
   Morrell Sykes, 21, of Duck Hill was free on $10,000 bond after
being charged with aggravated assault.
   Sykes and the 17-year-old girl, ``argued the night before and he
drove to her house shortly before noon Wednesday to collect clothing
and other items,'' Durr said. ``It was then that he allegedly poured
the gas on her and lit it.''
   The teen-ager, whose name was not released, remained in critical
condition Thursday afternoon in the burn unit at the Presley Trauma
Center in Memphis, said hospital spokeswoman Dorise Madison.
   Sykes turned himself in Wednesday afternoon, Durr said. He said
Sykes' hands were burned and he was treated at a Grenada hospital.
   Durr said officers were able to talk with the girl at the Grenada
Lake Medical Center before she was flown by helicopter to the
Memphis hospital.
   The incident in Grenada occurred shortly before an incident in
Jackson, about 100 miles to the south, in which a man apparently
locked himself and his two children in a pickup, poured gasoline
over their bodies and set them on fire. All three died.

<TEXT>
   A group of Arab Americans announced a campaign
Thursday against a leading Jewish human rights group over a letter
alleging that Arabs on college campuses are ``poisoning the minds of
our young.''
   The American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee accused B'nai
B'rith International of sending ``hate literature'' to its members
in a fund-raising letter designed to combat anti-Semitic propaganda
and cult influence on Jewish college students.
   B'nai B'rith issued a statement questioning why the Arab
organization was continuing its campaign ``after B'nai B'rith has
publicly admitted that it was in error in using a phrase that may be
considered offensive.''
   ``The ADC is apparently anxious to keep the matter alive and
festering in order to score cheap points and damage the relationship
between Jews and Arabs in the United States,'' said the statement.
   The Jewish organization said that the letter, composed by an
outside mailing house, was a mistake and that unmailed copies had
been withdrawn two weeks ago. The organization has apologized
privately to the Arab group but has rejected demands that it reveal
how many such letters were sent, saying only that it was not a mass
mailing.
   The letter was signed by Seymour Reich, who serves as president
of B'nai B'rith International and who was chosen last month as head
of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations.
   The American-Arab committee has asked Reich to tell all the
original recipients that he dissociates himself from the first
letter, and B'nai B'rith spokesman Art Shulman said Thursday Reich
had done so. Reich's new letter says the views stated in the
previous one ``do not reflect our views. The incident was an
unfortunate mistake,'' Shulman quoted the second letter as saying.
   Nonetheless, the Arab group has asked the Internal Revenue
Service to examine the tax exempt status of B'nai B'rith, which is
based on the organization's description of itself as an educational
institution, said committee spokesman Faris Bouhafa. A similar
request has gone to the Postal Service, which grants such
institutions preferred rates, he said.
   ``Every day we are subjected to a deluge of anti-Semitic
propaganda'' on college campuses, the original letter said. ``This
is a deliberate and well-organized campaign to undermine the basic
beliefs and values of our young people _ our children and
grandchildren,'' it said.
   ``The Arab presence on the college campus is poisoning the minds
of our young people,'' the letter said.
   ``While cults and cultists are lurking around every corner, B'nai
B'rith'' is ``there to battle against the very real threats to
Judaism.''
   Bouhafa said his organization objects to the letter's association
of Arabs with cultists and to ``the association of legitimate
political activity on the part of Arab Americans with
anti-Semitism.''
   The committee has asked 575 civil rights and religious
organizations to sign an open protest letter to Reich.
   ``For an organization known for its anti-discrimination efforts,
it is dismaying to see discrimination against another ethnic
group,'' said a letter to Reich from the Women's Division of the
United Methodist Church.

<HEAD>Hospital Limits Clergy Visits After Patients Complain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hospital has stopped telling clergy the religious
backgrounds of new admissions after some patients complained they
were startled to see priests or rabbis walk into their rooms.
   ``It frightens people when a priest walks in with a rosary,''
said Carolyn Lipp, a spokeswoman for Humana Hospital Biscayne.
``They think they're dying and that we're holding something back.''
   The policy, instigated three weeks ago, instructs administrators
to release patients' names only if the patient approves beforehand.
However, clergy who frequent the hospital complain that the new
procedure makes it impossible for them to minister to the sick.
   Hospital officials and religious representatives discussed the
policy at a special meeting Wednesday.
   Ms. Lipp said the hospital has stopped handing out a daily list
that gives a rundown of every patient and his or her religious
denomination because it may violate privacy laws and because of
patients' complaints.
   The hospital also discovered that some of those soliciting lists
were impostors more interested in the free lunch clergy receive at
the hospital.
   Since the policy took effect, clergy have seen the number of
calls they receive drop sharply, down to one or two a day.
   ``You don't throw the baby out with the dirty water just because
there have been a few complaints,'' said Rabbi Solomon Schiff,
director of chaplaincy for the Greater Miami Jewish Federation.
   ``Visits by qualified clergy have always been regarded as
something that assists the patient in his or her recovery,'' he said.
   Ms. Lipp said the real difficulty for the clergy is that only
about 10 percent of the patients wish to have a visit.
   ``What they don't understand and what they are not accepting is
that most of these people don't want to see them,'' she said.
   Many people go to church only once a year or not at all, she
said, and don't feel comfortable in the presence of clergy. ``You're
sick. You're not at your best. Maybe you're here for something very
personal,'' Ms. Lipp said. ``They don't want to see some strange
minister.''
   But to assuage the clergy, the hospital agreed to emphasize the
question during admissions and have patients sign a card accepting
or rejecting religious visitors.
   Ministers at other hospitals, however, see the move as a bad
trend.
   ``This sounds to me like an anti-religious move,'' said the Rev.
Charles Clements of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami. ``It
certainly causes complications in ministering to the sick if you
can't find them.''

   Friends and family Thursday mourned the 137 Italians
killed when a chartered jet hit a mountain in the Azores.
   Pope John Paul II sent ``sentiments of ... spiritual closeness''
to relatives of the victims.
   The Boeing 707, chartered from an American company, was bound
from Bergamo, Italy, to the Dominican Republic and crashed on the
approach for a refueling stop. All 144 people aboard were killed,
including the crew of seven Americans.
   Mayor Paolo Pillitteri of Milan, home of many victims, expressed
``condolences for the tragic deaths of my fellow citizens'' and
established an agency to help families and friends.
   In Trento, vendors at an outdoor market placed flowers and
newspaper accounts of the crash in the place normally occupied by
Ottilia and Bruna Baratto, sisters who were killed in the crash, the
news agency ANSA reported.
   Francesca Falcini of Milan mourned her sister Cristiana, who
substituted for her because Francesca's work kept her home, the
agency said.
   Many people blamed the charter company, Independent Air Corp.,
and airline deregulation in the United States.
   Mayor Pillitteri said the crash ``once again reveals the problem
of security of flights so essential in our society.''
   A member of Parliament's transport committee, Pino Lucchesi, said
the ``tragedy is a reflection of the consequences the excessive
deregulation of airline traffic can bring.''
   Erica Mattei said her daughter Andrea, a tour operator on the
flight, had expressed worry about the soundness of the aircraft, on
which she had flown to the Dominican Republic twice before, ANSA
reported.
   A Milan television reporter, Paola Ferrari, said she flew on the
plane late last year and there was condensation inside, some baggage
was wet at the end of the flight and the oxygen masks popped out
when it landed.
   ``I had wanted ... to protest to the agency that organized the
vacation (and) write an open letter to the newspapers, but then work
commitments absorbed me and today I am here crying about not having
done it,'' she said.

<HEAD>Detainee's Hunger Strike Spreads, Lawyers Start Solidarity Fast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Thursday it
will not let a hunger strike by 300 black inmates change its policy
of imprisonment without trial.
   The hunger strike is perhaps the strongest challenge to the
policy of detention without trial since President P.W. Botha
declared a national state of emergency in June 1986.
   Meanwhile, a U.N. report released in Geneva charged the
government with ``state terrorism'' against the black majority. The
138-page report said that children continue to be victims of torture
and other inhuman treatment.
   The report said news accounts of the problem are being distorted
by censorship and other media restrictions as well as by official
South African propaganda.
   Leliel Mikuin Balanda of Zaire, who headed the group that drew up
the report, told reporters Thursday that the situation in South
Africa was getting ``worse and worse.''
   In another development, two members of Inkatha, a powerful Zulu
political group, were sentenced Wednesday to hang for the murders of
seven teen-agers in 1987, one of the worst incidents during a
two-year power struggle in Natal Province.
   Emmanuel Khanyile, 34, and Wilfred Phewa, 31, were convicted and
sentenced in Durban Supreme Court.
   The youths were forced into a minibus on March 16, 1987, taken to
a cemetery, then beaten with hammers and stabbed, according to
testimony. The killers allegedly suspected the youths were
supporters of the United Democratic Front, an anti-apartheid
coalition that has been feuding with Inkatha.
   Also Thursday, a bomb exploded in a moving police van, slightly
injuring two white officers and a schoolboy walking nearby, police
said. There was no claim of responsibility.
   More than 40 civil rights lawyers pledged to fast 48 hours until
noon Saturday in support of the hunger strikers' demands to be freed
or tried.
   The lawyers said seven detainees had been hospitalized after
going 18 days without food.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok rejected a request by some of
the lawyers to meet them Thursday at Johannesburg's Diepkloof
Prison, where the strike began Jan. 23.
   He said the government ``cannot allow itself to be blackmailed by
way of hunger strikes.''
   Vlok indicated the government might reevaluate its stance ``if
some of the hunger strikers near death.
   ``We will look at it again when we are standing at the
crossroads,'' Vlok said.
   Civil rights workers said 105 detainees at St. Albans Prison in
Port Elizabeth _ many of them held since 1986 _ joined the hunger
strike Monday. About 170 detainees at Diepkloof are fasting, as are
detainees in the port city of Durban and in Witbank, a mining town
near Pretoria, the lawyers said.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying periods during the state of emergency. Vlok, at a news
briefing Thursday in Cape Town, said fewer than 1,000 people remain
in detention.
   Vlok said of the detainees, ``No one is being held without good
reason.'' He said the government chose not to charge the detainees
because of the difficulty obtaining convictions.
   The Human Rights Commission, formed by anti-apartheid activists
last year, said Vlok will be responsible ``should even one of the
detainees die.''
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
   Badly designed fuel filler pipes on 5 million
Ford Motor Co. cars pose a fire danger that already has caused more
than 200 deaths, a lawyer-founded group said Thursday.
   A Ford spokesman said the company is not aware of any hazardous
condition that would warrant a recall of older models.
   Officials of the Institute for Injury Reduction told a news
conference they want the company to spend $250 million to recall and
fix the fuel tank assemblies on the cars, a variety of models made
since 1965.
   Institute president Benjamin Kelly said the hazardous design has
been the subject of several suits around the country, most ending in
settlements.
   Ford spokesman Jerald terHorst said requiring automakers to
modify older models to include each improvement in the product would
mean that ``innovations and improvements would soon come to a halt.''
   He said the company has confidence in the safety of its cars'
fuel systems.
   David E. Perry, an insitute member from Corpus Christi, Texas,
said if Ford fails to act, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration or Congress should step in to force a recall.
   Perry said he has been involved in nine cases involving fires in
Ford-made cars, all ending in settlement. He said Ford has never
acknowledged liability and has settled on the condition that amounts
it paid not be disclosed.
   He said Ford has acknowledged in court documents that 221 people
have died in crashes involving fuel tank fires in Ford-made cars
since 1965 and the institute believes from 50 to 100 more deaths
have occurred with about 3,000 people injured.
   The defect, he said, is caused by a design that has the fuel tank
filler pipe rigidly attached to the vehicles' fender, causing the
hose to be pulled out in a rear-end collision. This causes gas and
highly combustible vapors to escape and be easily ignited by sparks
and heat generated in a crash, Perry said.
   He said the danger can be avoided by lengthening the pipe,
attaching it to the fuel tank and providing a ``breakaway'' device
so it will detach from the outside panel, at a cost of about $50 per
car.
   The institute said the systems was installed in full-size Fords,
Mercurys and Lincolns built from 1965 to 1985; in some full-size
1986 Fords and Mercurys; in 1974-79 Lincoln Mark IV and Mark V
models, and in some Thunderbirds, Cougars, Pintos, Bobcats,
Mustangs, Capris, Fairmonts, Zephyrs and Granadas built from 1970 to
1981.
   The institute, which describes itself as a non-profit research
and educational organization concerned with reducing injuries
resulting from product defects, estimated that 20 million cars were
built with the fuel tank design and that 5 million of them are still
on the road.

<TEXT>
   Gov. William A. O'Neill and more than 100
judges gathered Thursday to honor Richard C. Noren, the Superior
Court judge who killed himself after withdrawing his bid for a
second term on the bench.
   Noren was eulogized as a renaissance man, a good judge and a
considerate friend who spent his last hours writing thank-you notes
to those who had supported him in his highly public battle for
reappointment.
   Noren, 47, withdrew from consideration for a second eight-year
term last week after appearing twice before the General Assembly's
Judiciary Committee, which questioned him about his 1986 drunken
driving arrest, his drinking habits and his truthfulness.
   Three days later, he poisoned himself with car exhaust fumes in a
barn near the Woodstock farmhouse in rural northeast Connecticut
where he had lived since his youth.
   A crowd of about 900, including more than 100 judges and scores
of attorneys and court officials, applauded when Harry S. Gaucher
Jr., a friend and attorney, began his eulogy by saying, ``Richard
Carl Noren was a good judge.''
   Noren had requested such a eulogy in his emotional second
appearance before the Judiciary Committee, saying, ``I have often
said, not entirely facetiously, that I should like to have on my
tombstone the epitaph, `He was a good judge.'''
   The state Supreme Court and Appellate Court canceled sessions so
judges could attend the service at a conference center, and most of
the state's 139 Superior Court judges also cleared their schedules
to attend.
   ``Dick was as close to portraying the renaissance man as anyone I
have known,'' said Noren's college roommate, Henry Greene, now a
District of Columbia Superior Court judge. ``He was a historian, a
raconteur, an antiques expert.''
   Noren, a graduate of Harvard College and George Washington
University Law School, was clerk of Superior Court in Windham from
1971 to 1980 before being named a judge. His first term would have
expired Friday.
   There was a sentiment among many of those in attendance that
Noren's death reflected the amount of stress judges feel from the
state's reappointment process, said Chief Court Administrator Aaron
Ment.
   ``What's happened is that we now have a procedure that is similar
to trying to negotiate a minefield,'' said Ment. Some judges feel
that ``the integrity of the system _ the independence of the
judiciary _ is being eroded.''

<HEAD>State Department Official Says No Double Standard In Air Terror Warnings</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf, The posted, to clarify that the threat, not the
notice, was a hoax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The State Department's top terrorism expert
said Thursday that officials were wrong to post notices of threats
against American flights on embassy bulletin boards without also
telling the traveling public.
   The posted notice relayed rumors of a threat against Pan Am
flights from Frankfort, West Germany to the United States and
appeared days before a bomb exploded on Pan Am flight 103 over
Scotland Dec. 21. All 259 people on board were killed. The threat
was later determined to be a hoax.
   ``It is not our policy to alert government officials and not the
general public to such a threat,'' L. Paul Bremer, the State
Department's ambassador-at-large for counterterrorism, told the
House Foreign Affairs Committee. ``There is, and can be, no double
standard.''
   Bremer, appearing at the second congressional hearing of the day
on efforts to tighten aviation security, called the threat to
Frankfurt-U.S. flights a ``gruesome coincidence.''
   The notice ``should not have been posted,'' he said. Officials
have acknowledged that the warning was posted in the Moscow embassy
and possibly other missions as well.
   Bremer said officials at the Moscow embassy have said they found
the policy on warnings ``not as clear as we thought it was.'' He
said if a threat is specific and serious, authorities recommend
cancellation of the flight. Otherwise, a public travel advisory is
issued.
   Relatives of people killed in the unsolved explosion told the
earlier hearing that Congress should speed federal efforts to
tighten security against terrorist airplane attacks.
   Federal aviation and anti-terrorism officials defended the
government's policy of not publicizing bomb threats against
airlines, saying U.S. airlines and airports receive an average of
three threats a day.
   Relatives of those killed in the Pan Am crash said the government
must do more in notifying passengers about terrorist threats and in
installing sophisticated equipment to detect explosives and weapons.
   ``I bring no particular expertise to this committee other than
possibly sadness, grief and tears,'' said a steady-voiced Robert P.
Berrell, an automobile dealer from Fargo, N.D., whose 20-year-old
son, Steven, a student at Syracuse University, was among those
killed in the crash.
   An additional 11 victims were killed in Lockerbie, Scotland, when
flaming debris from the Boeing 747 plummeted to earth.
   ``When threats as specific as this are received, interested
passengers must be notified,'' Berrell told members of the House
Science, Space and Technology's transportation subcommittee.

<HEAD>Former Atlantic City Officials Indicted In Alleged Casino-Bribery

   A state grand jury has indicted two former
Atlantic City officials and a city employee on bribery charges in
connection with casino linen contracts, authorities said Thursday.
   The indictment charges that former Atlantic City planning board
member James Bradley misused his office in 1985 and 1986 by
pressuring the Sands Hotel &amp; Casino to award a service contract to
Atlantic Linen. Also charged is the firm's owner, W. Oscar Harris,
former director of the city's housing authority.
   City employee Alonzo Bailey Jr., a former chauffeur for Atlantic
City Mayor James L. Usry, also was named in the alleged conspiracy.
   ``The grand jury alleged that Bradley, Harris and Bailey
pressured several hotel casinos for the linen contracts by peddling
Bradley's influence with the Planning Board to either expedite or
delay pending proposals and applications by the hotel casinos for
the establishment or expansion of parking facilities,'' said Robert
T. Winter, director of the state Division of Criminal Justice.
   The indictments were returned Feb. 1 but remained sealed until
Thursday.
   A second indictment charges Bailey and Byram Ali, an official at
the Atlantic City Bureau of Inspections, with bribery, official
misconduct and conspiracy.
   Winter said the two men are charged with accepting a $250 bribe
from an undercover detective in exchange for a promise they would
expedite the approval of a city construction contractor license for
the detective.
   The indictment says that when Bailey was negotiating for a linen
service contract with Del Webb's Claridge Casino Hotel, he told
casino officials that if they wanted approval from the city board
for expanded parking, ``We're going to have to be compensated.''
   The indictment also charges Harris conspired to have his company
bid for contracts as a minority owned firm, and then subcontract all
work to non-minority companies.
   The indictment alleges that when Claridge President Roger Wagner
did not award the contract to Harris' company, Harris warned, ``some
people get put in plastic bags like that.''
   The three men also are charged with attempting to pressure the
Showboat Hotel Casino for its linen service contract.
   Bradley and Ali could not be reached for comment because they
have unlisted telephone numbers. No number could be obtained for
Bailey and there was no answer at Harris' home.
   If convicted, Bradley, Harris and Ali face a maximum of 30 years
in prison and fines of up to $300,000, and Bailey faces a maximum
prison sentence of 60 years and $600,000 in fines.

<HEAD>Coordinator Of Nationwide Village Elections Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two gunmen killed the chief
coordinator of next month's nationwide village elections in a late
night ambush in front of the victim's home, police said Thursday.
   Sgt. Rodolfo Disierto said Vicente Gerochi Jr., 54, an official
of the Commission on Elections, was gunned down in his car Wednesday
night after pulling up in front of his home in suburban Quezon City.
The gunmen escaped.
   Gerochi was manager of the commission branch in charge of the
March 28 election, when voters will choose 294,000 members of
village councils across the country.
   Commission officials said they did not know the motive for the
killing but said Gerochi's house was strafed by unknown assailants
during regional elections in January 1988.
   Police investigator Reynaldo Medina said the assailants flagged
down a taxi in Manila about two hours before the killing and asked
to be driven to the victim's home.
   They told the driver to keep his engine running and later asked
and received water from the victim's maid to keep the motor cool
while they waited for Gerochi, Medina said.
   After eating dinner at a sidewalk cafe, they calmly returned to
the house, shot Gerochi and then fled in the same taxi, he said. The
driver, Rosario Fernando, told investigators he was forced at
gunpoint to take the assailants back toward Manila, where they
disembarked and fled.
   Fernando then reported the shooting to police. Medina said the
driver told authorities that the gunmen spoke with an accent usually
associated with Moslem areas of the south.
   The military had sought a postponement of the elections until
May, saying they needed time to prevent Communist rebels from
disrupting the balloting.
   But President Corazon Aquino opted for the March date under
pressure from the Senate.
   In another development, 50 Communist rebels raided a police
station and robbed a bank in the small town of Looc on Bohol island,
380 miles southeast of Manila, the military reported Thursday.
   The report said one government militiaman was killed in the
Wednesday raid. The rebels made off with five rifles, four
typewriters and about $11,000 in cash.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity founder Lech Walesa interceded
to end a strike at Poland's largest power complex Thursday and asked
restive workers to give his negotiations with the government a
chance.
   At a rally in a Roman Catholic church for employees of the huge
Nova Huta steel mill, Walesa spent more than an hour explaining the
talks with communist authorities through which Solidarity hopes to
become legal again.
   He urged workers to put aside local grievances long enough for
the negotiations, which began Monday in Warsaw, to bear fruit.
Strikes crippled the Nova Huta mill last spring and summer.
   A strike of coal miners at the Belchatow power complex 90 miles
southwest of Warsaw, which supplies one-fifth of Poland's
electricity, was ended with the help of a mediator sent by Walesa,
but other labor tension continued.
   The Solidarity Information Service said workers in the Nowa Huta
coke department were refusing overtime, and the official news agency
PAP said the same was true of ambulance staffs in Poznan province,
western Poland.
   PAP said about 460 workers at a machine plant near Czestochowa
started a strike Thursday for higher pay, cuts in administrative
staff and better working conditions.
   Government delegates and representatives of the opposition met
for seven hours Thursday in a working group on trade union issues
and expressed optimism that technical details for restoring
Solidarity's legal status could be worked out.
   Among major questions remaining are whether a ``social contract''
can be made on economic and political reforms, and the form of new
parliamentary elections. Authorities have made agreement on those
topics, being negotiated by other working groups, a condition for
legalizing the union.
   Janusz Onyszkiewicz, national spokesman for Solidarity, told
reporters the union wants a separate law making it legal again and
expressed satisfaction with the prospects.
   ``It's not formal approval'' so far, ``but it's optimistic
because the authorities asked for technical details,'' he said. ``So
they treat (our position) as a serious thing and will consider it as
such.''
   Alexander Kwasniewski, a government minister who took part in the
meeting, said the discussion now revolves around how the
legalization would occur.
   Walesa founded Solidarity in Gdansk, where he still works as a
shipyard electrician, during the labor turmoil of 1980 and the
government initially accepted it as the first independent trade
union in the Soviet bloc. It was suppressed after the declaration of
martial law in December 1981, however, and later outlawed.
   After attending the first part of Thursday's negotiations in
Warsaw, Walesa left for the evening Mass and rally in Nowa Huta, on
the outskirts of Krakow in southern Poland.
   He is making a two-day tour of the southern region to reassure
skeptical workers about the negotiations with the government.
   Speaking to a crowd of about 3,000 people after Mass in the
Mistrzejowice church, which was lined with Solidarity banners, he
declared:
   ``I don't believe in the government, but there is a possiblity
for pluralism. As Lech Walesa I must do everything, or take every
opportunity peacefully, to build a better Poland.''
   The union leader, who won the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, has
apologized to audiences lately for ``too elegant'' by wearing a suit
and tie to the negotiations. He appeared at the rally in a sportcoat
and jeans.
   When members of the audience shouted out grievances against the
steel mill management and behavior of local authorities, Walesa
appeared impatient.
   ``Each one of us has grievances and reasons to strike, and we
have to get out of this,'' he said. ``If there is a chance at the
round table, we have to take it.''
   Solidarity can address specific problems when it is allowed to
function legally, he said.
   Walesa's initial appeal, in an interview with state radio, was
broadcast as the working group on unions began its meeting.
   He called the Belchatow strike ``another proof that we should
reach agreement on the most important things as soon as possible and
restore the organization called Solidarity.''
   Wildcat strikes could be avoided if an organized union spoke for
the workers, he said, and told Solidarity's supporters: ``Lech
Walesa is appealing for a chance for the round table. We have been
waiting for so many years, we can wait a few days more.''
   The unprecedented talks, first proposed during severe labor
unrest in August and expected to last up to six weeks, are intended
to create a national consensus for solving Poland's severe economic,
social and political problems.

   The State Department announced Thursday that
10,000 extra visas will be issued in both 1990 and 1991 to
immigrants from 162 countries on a random basis.
   Eligible for the lottery are citizens of the Soviet Union, Poland
and several other countries whose refugee quotas are filled. The
application period is March 1 through March 31. Unlike the last such
lottery in 1986, the visas will not be issued on a first-come,
first-serve basis.
   Instead, the applications will be fed to computers and the
selections made on a random basis. Immigrants from all the eligible
countries will have an equal chance.
   Unlike refugees, who are generally given haven for political
reasons, immigrants are required to have close relatives in the
United States or have a scarce profession. However, the 20,000 to be
admitted under the special program will not have to meet those
requirements.
   Only screening for mental or criminal liabilities will be
conducted, U.S. officials said.
   The only countries excluded are those that used more than 5,000
immigrant slots in fiscal 1988. These are China, Colombia, Dominican
Republic, El Salvador, Guyana, Haiti, India, Jamaica, South Korea,
Mexico, the Philippines and the United Kingdom.
   The excluded include Taiwan and also natives of Anguilla,
Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands,
Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Monteserrat, Pitcairn, St. Helena, Turks and
Caicos Islands.
   A lottery for 10,000 visas was held in 1986. About 1.4 million
applicants lost out.
   The State Department announcement contained strict rules for
applicants. Among them is that all applications must be typewritten
and that husbands and wives may apply separately.
   Last month, in a move to admit more Soviet and East European
refugees, former President Reagan decided to increase this fiscal
year's quota by 7,000 by lowering the quota of Vietnamese refugees,
many of whom are former political prisoners.
   The decision brought to 25,000 the number of Soviets who will be
permitted to enter the United States. While the added slots will be
taken mostly from the quota for refugees from Vietnam, U.S.
officials stressed the president has considerable flexibility to
alter the totals later on.
   Thousands of Soviet refugees, many of them Jews, are in Vienna
and Rome, waiting for permission to come to the United States, and
the quota for them to enter this country is full.
   The lottery announced Thursday will give them a chance to enter
the country as immigrants _ but the chance will be no greater than
that of applicants from the 161 other countries that are eligible.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Thursday
outlawed West Germany's most notorious neo-Nazi organization, and
police discovered a small cache of weapons and Nazi propaganda in a
search of the party headquarters.
   During coordinated raids across the country, police confiscated
knives, guns, ammunition, posters of Adolf Hitler and
swastika-covered banners from members of the Nationale Sammlung.
   ``The Federal Republic is not about to become the roaming grounds
for right-wing extremists,'' Interior Minister Friedrich Zimmermann
said in announcing the ban.
   The group's leader, neo-Nazi Michael Kuehnen, said he was
considering legal action to fight the ban.
   Founded last summer, the Nationale Sammlung had fielded
candidates for next month's elections in Frankfurt and suburban
Langen and said it hoped to run in other locations as well. Its
platform included renaming a railway station after Hitler.
   The ban forbids Nationale Sammlung members from carrying out any
activities as a group, including fielding candidates for an
election, and it bans them from using the name publicly.
   It coincides with a growing concern in West Germany of a possible
resurgence of ultra-rightist tendencies.
   Late Thursday, the ZDF television network quoted Guenther
Schleicher, head of the Hesse state Office for the Protection of the
Constitution, as alleging that cases of murder and bank robberies
have been linked to neo-Nazi parties in West Germany.
   Schleicher also estimated about 2,000 neo-Nazis are in West
Germany, although other officials have put the figure closer to
1,500.
   ``Germany, they're coming,'' Stern magazine said in a headline on
this week's cover. Another headline sarcastically referred to the
extremists as ``the nice Nazis from next door.''
   A poll published Sunday by the Welt am Sonntag newspaper said
another extreme right-wing group, the Republican Party, would win
11.5 percent of the vote nationwide if federal elections were held
now.
   The Republicans, headed by a former Nazi Waffen SS soldier,
captured 7.5 percent of the vote in last month's elections in West
Berlin. That sends 11 party members to the local legislature and
gives the Republicans two seats in Parliament beginning next year.
   Further to the right of the Republican Party are the neo-Nazis,
who are split into about 10 different groups. The most notorious is
Nationale Sammlung, which has about 170 members.
   The interior ministry said Nationale Sammlung had expressed
revolutionary and combative aims to change West German society. It
also accused Kuehnen and his followers of building up neo-Nazi
groups nationwide.
   The organization supports expulsion from West Germany of foreign
workers and asylum seekers.
   Kuehnen has also been active with right-wing extremists from
several countries in planning celebrations for the 100th anniversary
of Hitler's birth April 20.
   Contacted in Munich, Kuenhen said in an interview he would fight
the ban in court. ``I see certain legal possibilities,'' said
Kuehnen, who has served three prison terms for Nazi activities.
   West Germany's ARD TV network showed police carrying knives, guns
and a box filled with ammunition from Kuehnen's Frankfurt home,
which serves as the party's headquarters. Kuehnen was not home
during the raid.
   The broadcast showed police in a workshop of the house, where
Kuehnen and his supporters allegedly filed down bullets so they
would cause more severe injuries.
   Gottfried Milde, the interior minister of the state of Hesse,
said most of the raids were in Hesse, which includes Frankfurt.
   The other states where police staged raids included Bavaria and
North Rhine-Westphalia, the federal interior ministry said.
   Searches there turned up an air rifle, two steel helmets, a gas
mask, three pistols for firing blanks, and Nazi propaganda.
   Zimmermann said authorities were seizing any property they could
find that belonged to the NS group, whose initials are identical to
the best-known German abbreviation for Hitler's Nazi Party.
   The Nazi Party has been banned since West Germany was founded in
1949.
   Under West German law, the Interior Ministry may ban any
organization it determines is spreading Nazi propaganda. Violations
of the ban carry penalties of up to five years in prison.
   There have been calls for the ministry to ban another neo-Nazi
group, the Free German Workers' Party, which the interior ministry
says has about 500 members. The party is under investigation in
connection with arson attacks on foreign workers in West Germany.

<HEAD>Three Officials of Stroessner Regime Arrested</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PEDRO SERVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said they arrested two of
deposed President Alfredo Stroessner's government ministers Thursday
and caught the former central bank president trying to flee with a
large amount of cash.
   No charges were specified, but the detentions appeared to be
connected with alleged financial irregularities under Gen.
Stroessner, who ruled for nearly 35 years and was overthrown last
week. Stroessner is in exile in Brazil.
   Cesar Romeo Acosta, 75-year-old former head of the central bank,
was arrested while trying cross the border to Argentina and confined
to a police hospital, the authorities reported. They said said he
was carrying $20,000, many traveler's checks and 12,000 West German
marks.
   Police also reported the detentions of Adan Godoy Gimenez, former
minister of public health, and Carlos Ortiz Ramirez, who was
Stroessner's education minister.
   Officials in the provisional government of Gen. Andres Rodriguez,
a longtime associate of Stroessner who ousted him Feb. 3, have been
saying all week that officials of the former regime apparently
enriched themselves with public funds.
   Central bank officials said Wednesday they would examine checks
written by some ``government officials who are no longer government
officials.''
   With the dictator gone, exiles are returning from neighboring
Brazil and Argentina and such opposition politicians as Domingo
Laino are interviewed on television.
   Rodriguez, who has called elections for May 1, is receiving
dissident factions of the ruling Colorado Party.
   ``It seems like a dream to see Laino on television,'' said
journalist Fernando Cazenave. ``It seems like a fantasy to hear
leaders of the Popular Colorado Movement were received by the
president of the republic. All this has never happened in this
country.''
   Leaders of the dissident Popular Colorado Movement, including
Miguel Angel Gonzalez Casabianca and Mario Mallorquin, were exiled
in 1960. After they were allowed back in 1983, police agents on
motorscooters followed them everywhere.
   Opposition leaders hardly ever appeared on television while
Stroessner was in power. The general's son Gustavo owned one of the
two stations in Asuncion and his good friend Nicolas Bo owned the
other.
   Stroessner closed the largest newspaper, ABC Color, in March 1984
and called publisher Aldo Zuccolillo ``an enemy of the government.''
Soon after the coup, Zuccolillo was featured in a story in the the
Colorado Party paper.
   Critics say only the faces have changed and the system of
Colorado Party rule under a military president remains the same. But
Rodriguez has appointed a capable Cabinet, set an election date and
made overtures to the Roman Catholic Church, which Stroessner
alienated.
   U.S. Ambassador Timothy Towell spent an hour Thursday with
Foreign Minister Luis Maria Argana, then told reporters: ``We've
heard the words. We hear the commitments. Now is the time to see how
they implement them.
   ``We will be judging the quality of our relationship on the
degree in which they move forward in all these areas.''

   They have no place of their own to eat or sleep, to take a bath
or wash their clothes. Their children have no place to study or play.
   No, these are not just derelicts or ne'er-do-wells or social
misfits. They represent many families of the working poor who have
low-paying jobs and work each day, but simply cannot pay for the
inflated price of housing
   America can do better than that. We must do better!
   Of course, we cannot expect to vanquish all these evils
immediately, but if we have the will we can make significant
progress against all three deficits this year.
   We in the Congress, and surely all Americans everywhere, are
anxious to help our new president fulfill his promise of a ``kinder,
gentler America.'' I want very much to help George Bush qualify to
be known as ``the education president.''
   We in Congress are eager to help him attain the goals he has
expressed of wider access for all Americans to Head Start services,
to safe and wholesome child day care in an age when both parents
must work, to affordable housing and to a cleaner environment.
   By working hard together, we must drive the scourge of drugs from
our streets and our schools as Mr. Bush pledged in his inaugural
speech. Congress made significant progress last year in this truly
bipartisan goal. We developed a good battle plan for the war against
drugs. But when it came to paying for the war, the government ran
out of money. Right now we're financing not a war, but a skirmish.
   That's not good enough. Our society can afford to pay for
vigorous anti-drug efforts. Truth is, we can't afford not to. That's
our first line of defense.
   That, and the education of our children _ more vital to our
national security than Star Wars.
   Since 1980, the federal investment in education has actually
declined by 12 percent. Is it any wonder that American students _
better fed and surely just as smart _ do worse in mathematics and
language, and geography, and science, than students do in most other
industrial nations?
   That's not good enough. We can do better than that. And we will.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, in his maiden policy initiative
to Congress, on Thursday proposed a $1.16 trillion ``common sense''
budget for fiscal 1990 that calls for less military but greater
domestic spending than sought by President Reagan.
   The plan, which features a one-year freeze on scores of federal
programs, calls for roughly $5 billion more spending than the budget
submitted by former President Reagan last month and carries out
Bush's oft-stated opposition to new taxes.
   ``Higher taxes ... are not the solution to the deficit problem,''
Bush's 193-page budget outline declares.
   But, while the measure supports many of the campaign vows made by
Bush in his 1988 presidential campaign _ more help for the homeless,
for education, for child care and for cleaning up the environment _
it also leaves much of the federal budget up to negotiation with
Congress.
   Initial reaction from lawmakers was cordial.
   ``The Democratic Congress wants to work with this president in
every way that we can,'' House Speaker Jim Wright said in a taped
response for the television networks.
   ``We'll give him our sincere cooperation. That does not mean
obedience. It does mean our honest help and our very best advice.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush was ``happy with
the budget and eager to get on with the Bush initiatives.''
   Bush's first presidential speech, televised nationally at 9 p.m.
EST, was expected to mix campaign promises with expressions of
budget restraint and new overtures toward bipartisanship.
   But his budget was vague on exactly where all the money would
come from to pay for initiatives.
   ``It is not as much as he promised but it is a start,'' Bush's
budget director, Richard G. Darman, told a White House briefing.
   The budget director said that there was room for even more
savings in federal spending if Congress decided to go along with the
dozens of programs that Reagan sought to terminate _ actions that
for the most part the new Bush budget does not embrace.
   The new budget did not detail which programs should be cut beyond
the general proposal for a spending freeze.
   Bush is ready to negotiate with Congress on a final budget ``all
day and all night if that's what it takes,'' Darman said.
   His budget, described as a ``common-sense approach to
budgeting,'' calls for a one-year freeze on defense spending at the
levels of inflation.
   And, it projects a federal deficit in the fiscal year that begins
next Oct. 1 of $94.8 billion _ well within the $100 billion limit
set by the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law. If the sale of
government assets are included, the deficit would be even lower _
$91.1 billon. Bush's budget amendments call for an overall budget
surplus of $3.8 billion by 1993.
   The plan seeks to put in motion a variety of campaign promises,
including a proposed $1,000-per child tax credit for low-income
families, a $3,000 tax deduction to help cover the costs of
adoptions, an expansion of the Head Start program and a new plan to
give grants to the nation's best high schools.
   It would also provide nearly $1 billion more in the upcoming year
to fight ``the scourge of drugs'' and would restore some $1.7
billion in cuts sought by Reagan in the Medicaid program for medical
assistance for poor people.
   Bush's proposal would also reduce to 15 percent from the current
level of 28 percent to 33 percent the tax on most capital gains _
the profits from the sale of real estate, stocks or other assets.
   This proposal had drawn opposition in advance from congressional
Democrats, who vowed to fight it as a tax benefiting mostly the rich.
   And there are other strains in Bush's efforts to extend an
``offered hand'' to Congress. His speech comes as the Senate Armed
Services Committee is engaged in a protracted and divisive
confirmation struggle over Bush's nomination of former Sen. John
Tower as defense secretary.
   Bush has said he stands firmly behind his nominee, despite
recurring allegations of womanizing and excessive drinking that
continue to stall the confirmation process.
   The budget plan presented few surprises. Most of its elements had
been reported in the past.
   Bush repeated Reagan's long-sought appeal for a constitutional
amendment to balance the budget and authority to veto individual
lines in spending bills.
   Bush, who promised a ``kinder but gentler nation'' in his
campaign, also proposed an overall increase of 70 percent in federal
spending on ``the tragedy of men, women, and children living without
homes.''
   Much of the revenues needed to fund Bush's new initiatives would
come from spending freezes on a host of federal programs _ including
all government military and civilian retirement benefits.
   However, Social Security benefits would not be affected under the
plan.
   The president claims his capital gains proposal would generate $4
billion or so in revenue by stimulating new business investment, but
many economists have disputed this and the proposal has already
encountered stiff Demcoratic opposition.
   In fact, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, on Thursday promised all-out opposition to
Bush's proposal to reduce the capital gains tax.
   Even so, Democratic leaders generally seemed ready to give Bush
the benefit of the doubt in his first speech to a joint session of
Congress.
   ``I don't think there's any particular effort on the part of the
Democratic Party to do anything expect to applaud what the president
is about to say and to continue the kind of spirit that the
president has been working very hard on ... in trying to develop a
relationship with Congress,'' said Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla.,
   Under regular procedures, the president's budget gets modified by
the House and the Senate into a final budget resolution, which then
serves as an overall guide for legislation produced later by the
appropriations and tax-writing committees.
   Bush's plan modifies a $1.15 trillion budget Reagan submitted
shortly before leaving office. The Reagan plan called for a 2
percent increase in defense spending over inflation, proposed scores
of cuts in domestic programs and projected a federal deficit of
$92.5 billion.

   Working together Congress will pass a clean air bill this year to
protect that precious commodity upon which all human life depends.
   A kinder, gentler America? That's old time Democratic religion.
We embrace it enthusiastically!
   We know, and you know, that these goals cannot be achieved by
words alone, or by symbolic gestures. They require money _ the
commitment of resources sufficient to win the battle against these
common enemies.
   On the question of how these vital initiatives will be paid for,
the Democrats in Congress will insist on fairness.
   We would have to reject any kind of ``flexible freeze'' that
would bend with flexibility for the rich and powerful but freeze out
the middle income families of America.
   We will oppose attempts to cut Medicare.
   We are ready to meet with President Bush any time he wishes and
seek common solutions. Our House Budget Committee will begin its
formal hearings in a very few days. The president's representatives
are invited. We are determined to complete our work on time, and
pass our appropriations bills on time, again this year _ as we did
last year.
   We do have limited resources and urgent challenges. But there are
some things we can do without spending public money.
   We must raise the minimum wage, held down for eight long years _
because those who work honestly for wages in America must never
receive less than they would on welfare.
   We can ask that polluters pay more of the cost of cleaning up the
poisons which they create and from which they profit.
   We must encourage American corporations to reinvest in America _
in plants and factories and jobs and strength, not in leveraged
buyouts and paper profits.
   We should require that corporations insure the health of their
employees _ so that the hard earned family savings of a decade or
more cannot be wiped out by the illness of a single child.
   When it comes to shaping a kinder, gentler, fairer nation the
real question is not whether we have the words but whether we have
the will. For ultimately we will be judged by what we have done.
   In the years ahead, long after this night is forgotten and the
phrases have faded and our page of history has turned, let it be
said of us that we have refreshed America's sense of common concern;
that we renewed America's basic strength; that together we reached
out for America's future and put our faith and our investment in the
American people.
   In our earnest efforts to help the new president build this
future, the House and Senate will work together. The Senate
Democratic majority is represented tonight by the chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee _ our recent nominee for vice president of
the United States _ Senator Lloyd Bentsen.

<HEAD>Cold And Wet In California, Great Lakes Areas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A shot of cold arctic air flowing across the Great Lakes created
snow in parts of New York and Michigan on Thursday and a low
pressure system off California swept rain through the valleys and
snow on the mountains.
   Temperatures warmed over portions of the Plains and the South
remained mild.
   In California, snow fell over the northern mountains, the
Antelope Valley and the Owens Valley in Southern California, where a
winter storm warning was in effect Thursday. Twelve inches of snow
were dumped on Olancha, Calif.
   Strong winds, gusting to nearly 60 mph overnight, were
diminishing over the San Joaquin Valley.
   Snow also fell over portions of Utah, some of it in areas that
usually do not receive much snow. Four inches of new snow were
recorded at Santa Clara, in southern Utah.
   Over the Great Lakes, cold arctic air moving across the lakes'
warmer waters created lake-effect snow. Snowfall over western New
York on Thursday morning included 5 to 6 inches at Batavia, and 5
inches at Sodus.
   Temperatures were warming Thursday over portions of the Plains,
with readings in the 20s and 30s from the central and northern
Plains, across the middle Mississippi Valley and the Tennessee
Valley, to the middle Atlantic Coast.
   Readings remained in the single digits and teens over much of the
upper Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes, and much of New England.
Strong winds combined with the cold temperatures over New England
and created wind chill readings between 20 and 30 degrees below zero.
   But temperatures were in the 60s and 70s through the Florida
peninsula.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 5
degrees below zero at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 78 degrees
at Homestead Air Force Base and Key West, Fla.
   The low in the nation Thursday morning was 30 degrees below zero
at West Yellowstone, Mont.
   Friday's forecast called for rain along much of the southern and
central Pacific Coast, with snow over mountainous areas, as well as
over the Great Basin and western portions of the central Rockies;
lake-effect snow through upper Michigan and much of the lower Great
Lakes region; and snow scattered over northern New England.
   High temperatures were forecast in the teens and the 20s through
much of the central Rockies, southern Idaho, and from much of the
northern Plains across the upper Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes
and the upper Ohio Valley to New England; in the 30s and 40s from
the northern half of the Pacific Coast across the Great Basin, the
northern Rockies; the central Plains and Oklahoma, much of the
middle Mississippi Valley and Arkansas, the lower Ohio Valley, the
central and southern Appalachians to the middle Atlantic Coast and
much of the Carolinas; in the 50s and 60s from the central and
southern California Coast across the southern Plateau, the southern
Rockies, Texas, the Gulf Coast region and much of Florida to the
Georgia and South Carolina coast; and in the 70s in the Florida Keys.

   A federal appeals court denied a Justice
Department attempt Thursday to stop Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial
on national-security grounds, but the Bush administration vowed to
continue trying to put the proceeding on hold.
   Possible airing of state secrets, as the former National Security
Council aide defends himself, has threatened all along to scuttle
the trial. Two major charges against North were dropped last month
for that reason.
   Assistant Attorney General Edward S.G. Dennis said ``the risk to
national security would be significant'' under current rules laid
down by the trial judge. He said the government would lack control
over ``disclosure of very sensitive, classified information.''
   ``It would be a complete crapshoot,'' Dennis said.
   He said the government could seek reconsideration of the ruling
by the appeals court or go directly to the Supreme Court.
   Dennis, who heads the Justice Department's criminal division,
spoke with reporters after the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused
to block the trial's start.
   On Thursday night, the department said it will ask the three
judges on the appeals court panel to reconsider its decision Friday
morning.
   ``They had before them a lot more'' material from independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh ``than they had from us,'' said department
spokesman Loye Miller. Walsh said the department doesn't have the
authority to intervene in such a fashion and he opposes the Justice
Department's attempt to block the trial.
   Miller also said the appeals court had before it the order from
the North case trial judge, who earlier in the day rejected the
Justice Department's request to stop the proceedings.
   By the time the appeals court acted, U.S. District Judge Gerhard
A. Gesell had already sent the newly picked jury home for the
weekend with instructions to return, ready for swearing in, at 9:30
a.m. Monday.
   The government's objections to the procedures adopted by Gesell
must be heard before the trial begins because harmful disclosures
``could come as early as the opening statements,'' Dennis said.
   In a two-sentence order, the appeals court dissolved its
temporary stay of the proceedings, saying it was denying the
department's motion to stop the trial ``substantially for the
reasons'' cited by Gesell. The judge had ruled that the attorney
general did not have authority to intervene in the prosecution,
which is being handled by Walsh.
   Two hours earlier, not having heard from the appeals court,
Gesell had sent the jury home, saying he had to ``close up shop''
until Monday because of the government appeal.
   ``What we are going to do is shut down, catch up on our sleep,''
he said.
   The Justice Department had appealed a Gesell ruling that
department officials could not routinely censor classified
information before it was presented in court.
   Gesell ruled that the attorney general's only authority to enter
the case at this stage is to take the drastic step of affirming in
an affidavit that disclosure of certain classified information would
damage national security.
   Under that provision, the court would be required to order North
not to make the disclosure.
   But Dennis said ``we think that's premature. We could file such
an affidavit when there is specific information that's at issue.''
   Earlier Thursday, the jury was selected, with lawyers from each
side eliminating prospective jurors from a panel of 45 without
stating a reason. All of the people on the panel had said in open
court they had read, heard or seen little or nothing of North's
testimony before two congressional committees in the summer of 1987.
   Nine of the 12 criminal charges lodged against North focus on
accusations that he concealed from Congress and former Attorney
General Edwin Meese III his efforts on behalf of the Contras
fighting the leftist government of Nicaragua.
   North also is accused of illegally accepting installation of a
security system at his home, converting to his own use at least
$4,300 in traveler's checks from a Contra leader, and conspiring to
illegally use a tax-exempt foundation to raise money for the rebels.
   Gesell said he would not swear in the jury until the appeals
court ruled. The rule of double jeopardy, which protects North from
being tried twice on the same charges, comes into play once a jury
is sworn.
   The all-black jury is typical of the District of Columbia
community, which is heavily involved in federal government affairs
and which is, racially, about 75 percent black.
   The Justice Department said in requesting Thursday's stay:
   ``Because of the national security equities involved and the
highly sensitive classified information that may be compromised if
this case is permitted to proceed to trial without correction of the
procedures that the district court proposes to employ, it is
imperative that the trial be suspended pending the outcome of the
pending appeal.''
   Gesell called the department's attempt at intervention
``frivolous.''
   Walsh, the independent counsel who brought the case against
North, told the appeals court that the Justice Department had no
right to intervene _ that such authority rested with the independent
counsel.

   A new president's first budget is always a
collision between campaign rhetoric and reality, and the budget
George Bush put forward Thursday could spell a quick end to his
honeymoon with Congress.
   Bush the campaigner wanted to be the education president, stop
the drug scourge, house the homeless and clean up the environment.
   And he promised that all the good things he wanted for the
American people could be accomplished without raising taxes.
   The critics charged that Bush would fail. Either the promises
would go unfulfilled or the president would end up increasing taxes.
   But in a melody with a familiar refrain, Bush came up up with a
way out of his quandary. He said he will raise more revenue by
cutting taxes. Strains of ``That Old Black Magic'' by Ronald Reagan.
   The tax Bush has in mind is the capital gains levy, which taxes
the profits earned from the sale of assets, such as stocks.
   The Bush budget projects a $5 billion increase in revenues for
the 1990 fiscal year, which begins next Oct. 1, through enactment of
the cut in the capital gains tax.
   Bush's capital gains tax helps the new president achieve a
projected 1990 deficit of $91.1 billion, slightly bettering the
$92.5 billion deficit Reagan put forward one month ago in his final
spending blueprint.
   That is accomplished through the $5 billion projected revenue
gain from the cut in the capital gains tax and $2.6 billion in
reductions Bush proposed making in Reagan's 1990 military spending
request.
   Currently the profits on sales of assets are counted just like
other income, which means for high-income people a top tax rate of
either 28 percent or 33 percent.
   Bush wants to cut the capital gains rate in 1990 to 15 percent
for assets held one year or longer and projects the change would
increase revenues by $5 billion as people sold assets to take
advantage of the lower rate.
   But that revenue estimate comes with a big catch, many economists
believe. It will lower government revenues for other years.
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., a Lexington,
Mass., economic consulting firm, said that much of the revenue would
be lost in the current year, thus ballooning the size of the 1989
deficit, which is already projected to soar to $161 billion.
   ``I guarantee that you would lose about the same amount of
revenue in 1989 that you will gain in 1990,'' Wyss said. ``If you
know that the capital gains rate is going down on Jan. 1, you won't
be selling a lot of stock at a profit in June.''
   Democrats on Capitol Hill have another complaint. They say the
capital gains tax cut, which was one of Bush's campaign promises, is
nothing but the old Republican ``trickle down'' theory to benefit
the rich. They contend that 85 percent of all capital gains are
earned by the wealthiest 5 percent of Americans.
   They aimed their fire at the proposal in barbed remarks stripped
of the bipartisan good feeling which surrounded Bush's inaugural
address.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., said that
at a time of huge budget deficits it was ``simply unacceptable to be
considering tax breaks for the very wealthiest segment of the
American population.''
   The capital gains tax wasn't the only target drawing fire.
Critics complained that in many other areas the amount of money Bush
is proposing to spend is minuscule when compared with the magnitude
of the problem.
   Even before Bush's joint address, his aides were busy lowering
expectations, contending that in a time of tight budgets it was
tough to fund new initiatives.
   Bush's budget director, Richard Darman, told reporters at a
briefing on the budget that the president had at least made a start
toward fulfulling his pledge for a ``kinder, gentler'' nation.
   ``Is it as kind and gentle as everyone would like to be
immediately, I think probably not. But we can't do absolutely
everything at once,'' Darman told reporters. ``We will not be
claiming to have solved all problems.''
   During the campaign, Bush said the deficit problem would simply
melt by 1993 or 1994 if Congress would enact his ``flexible
freeze,'' whereby the overall rise in government spending is held to
the increase in inflation each year. Some programs could climb
faster than the inflation rate but only if other areas were pruned
back.
   But the pruning is likely to be as difficult for Bush as it was
for Reagan.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said
Thursday he was upset that Bush had decided to leave in his budget a
proposal also in Reagan's final budget to curb Medicare spending by
$5 billion next year by trimming payments to doctors and hospitals.
   Such a cut, Bentsen said, ``leads to very serious problems
because you have a lot of hospitals losing money on Medicare now and
a lot of hospitals closing, particularly rural hospitals.''

   Next year alone, thanks to economic growth, without any change in
the law, the federal government will take in over $80 billion more
than it does this year. That's right _ over $80 billion in new
revenues, with no increase in taxes. Our job is to allocate those
new resources wisely.
   We can afford to increase spending _ by a modest amount, but
enough to invest in key priorities and still cut the deficit by
almost 40 percent in one year. That will allow us to meet the
targets set forth in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law.
   But to do that, we must recognize that growth above inflation in
federal programs is not preordained, that not all spending
initiatives were designed to be immortal.
   I make this pledge tonight: My team and I are ready to work with
the Congress, to form a special leadership group, to negotiate in
good faith, to work day and night _ if that's what it takes _ to
meet the budget targets, and to produce a budget on time.
   We cannot settle for business as usual. Government by continuing
resolution _ or government by crisis _ will not do.
   I ask the Congress tonight to approve several measures which will
make budgeting more sensible. We could save time and improve
efficiency by enacting two-year budgets. Forty-three governors have
the line-item veto. Presidents should have it, too.
   At the very least, when a president proposes to rescind federal
spending, the Congress should be required to vote on that proposal _
instead of killing it by inaction.
   And I ask for Congress to honor the public's wishes by passing a
constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget. Such an
amendment, once phased in, will discipline both Congress and the
executive branch.
   Several principles describe the kind of America I hope to build
with your help in the years ahead.
   We will not have the luxury of taking the easy, spendthrift
approach to solving problems _ because higher spending and higher
taxes put economic growth at risk.
   Economic growth provides jobs and hope. Economic growth enables
us to pay for social programs. Economic growth enhances the security
of the nation. And low tax rates create economic growth.
   I believe in giving Americans greater freedom and greater choice
_ and I will work for choice for American families, whether in the
housing in which they live, the schools to which they send their
children, or the child care they select for their young.
   I believe that we have an obligation to those in need, but that
government should not be the provider for first resort for things
that the private sector can produce better.
   I believe in a society that is free from discrimination and
bigotry of any kind. I will work to knock down the barriers left by
past discrimination, and to build a more tolerant society that will
stop such barriers from ever being built again.
   I believe that family and faith represent the moral compass of
the nation _ and I will work to make them strong, for as Benjamin
Franklin said: ``If a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His
notice, (can) a (great nation) rise without His aid?''
   And I believe in giving people the power to make their own lives
better through growth and opportunity. Together, let's put power in
the hands of people.

   Three weeks ago, we celebrated the Bicentennial Inaugural, the
200th anniversary of the first presidency. And if you look back, one
thing is so striking about the way the founding fathers looked at
America. They didn't talk about themselves. They talked about
posterity. They talked about the future.
   We, too, must think in terms bigger than ourselves.
   We must take actions today that will ensure a better tomorrow. We
must extend American leadership in technology, increase long-term
investment, improve our educational system, and boost productivity.
These are the keys to building a better future.
   Here are some of my recommendations:
   _I propose almost $2.2 billion for the National Science
Foundation to promote basic research;
   _I propose to make permanent the tax credit for research and
development;
   _I have asked Vice President Quayle to chair a new Task Force on
Competitiveness;
   _I request funding for NASA and a strong space program _ an
increase of almost $2.4 billion over the current fiscal year. We
must have a manned space station; a vigorous, safe space shuttle
program; and more commercial development in space. The space program
should always go ``full throttle up'' _ that's not just our
ambition; it's our destiny.
   I propose that we cut the maximum tax rate on capital gains to
increase long-term investment. History is clear: this will increase
revenues, help savings, and create new jobs.
   We won't be competitive if we leave whole sectors of America
behind. This is the year we should finally enact urban enterprise
zones, and bring hope to our inner cities.
   But the most important competitiveness program of all is one
which improves education in America. When some of our students
actually have trouble locating America on a map of the world, it is
time for us to map a new approach to education.
   We must reward excellence, and cut through bureaucracy. We must
help those schools that need help most. We must give choice to
parents, students, teachers, and principals. And we must hold all
concerned accountable. In education, we cannot tolerate mediocrity.
   I want to cut the drop-out rate, and make America a more literate
nation. Because what it really comes down to is this: the longer our
graduation lines are today, the shorter our unemployment lines will
be tomorrow.
   So tonight I am proposing the following initiatives:
   _The beginning of a $500 million program to reward America's best
schools _ ``merit schools'';
   _The creation of special presidential awards for the best
teachers in every state _ because excellence should be rewarded;
   _The establishment of a new program of National Science Scholars,
one each year for every member of the House and Senate, to give this
generation of students a special incentive to excel in science and
mathematics;
   _The expanded use of magnet schools which give families and
students greater choice;
   _And a new program to encourage ``alternative certification'' _
which will let talented people from all fields teach in the
classroom.

<HEAD>Hospitals Very Short of Supplies, Nurse Says</HEAD>

   Supplies are so short in Veterans
Administration hospitals that nurses are scrounging thee little
souvenir bars of soap and shampoo bottles from hotels to bring to VA
patients, a nurse told Congress on Thursday.
   Supply accounts are frequently raided to pay salaries and avoid
layoffs, an outside medical administrator told the House Veterans
Affairs Committee.
   Claudette Morissey, a nurse at the Brooklyn, N.Y., veterans
hospital and prsident of the Nurses Organization of the Veterans
Administration, said in testimony submitted to the hearing, ``At one
VA hospital in the south, nurses were frustrated by the refusal of
(the) prosthetics (department) to supply wheel chair cushions for
patients on the long term care unit.
   ``The nurses obtained a $25 donation, went to the local
upholstery store and purchased a large foam mattress, and with an
electric knife borrowed from the mother of one of the nurses, cut
the foam to make wheel chair cushions for their patients.''
   She did not identify the hospital, nor the hospital in other
anecdotes:
   ``Nurses in one hospital brought in souvenir hotel soaps and
shampoos for the patients, and in another, brought and cut large
bars of soap in small pieces for patients to use.''
   At her own hospital, she said, ``We cannot properly monitor
diabetic patients when there are no lancets to do finger sticks, no
Chem Sticks for blood samples and no insulin syringes to use to give
insulin if it is needed. This is the situation I have faced over the
past month at my facility and I thank God there has been no crisis
because of it.''
   Donald R. Smith, VA spokesman, said he could not address
allegations made at specific facilities in the VA system of 172
hospitals and more than 220 out-patient clinics.
   ``Where we have specific allegations, we would defer to the local
hospital for comment,'' said Smith. ``I wouldn't want to speak to
the allegations of one nurse or one who represents a group of nurses
as something that exists throughout the system.''
   He said, however, that VA director-designate Edward Derwinski
told the committee earlier this week that he would seek more money
as a supplemental budget for 1989 and in the 1990 budget.
   ``He is aware of problems caused by the budget crunch,'' said
Smith. ``He met with President Bush yesterday (Wednesday) and I am
sure the problems of the hospitals were discussed.''
   A Soviet report last week of hospital patients getting AIDS from
unsterilized needles ``is a startling reminded to us in this country
that mistakes can happen when the system starts to cut corners and
workers perform daily under inordinate pressure as we do in the
VA,'' she said.
   At congressional hearings last September, VA officials said they
faced a $600 million to $1 billion shortfall in their $10.54 billion
budget for medical care in the current fiscal year.
   Derwinski, who will become secretary of veterans affairs when the
VA becomes a cabinet department next month, said Tuesday he had met
with Budget Director Richard Darman.
   Declining to say if he thought a supplemental appropriation is
needed for the current fiscal year, Derwinski said the meeting with
Darman ``didn't result in any figure changes, but I hope it'll
increase his sensitivity.''
   L. Thompson Bowles, vice president for medical affairs at the
George Washington University Medical Center, a member of a VA
advisory committee and a consulting surgeon to two VA hospitals,
said, ``By moving funds from other accounts, the Department of
Medicine and Surgery was able to remain near the congressionally
mandated 194,720 employment level,''
   Kenneth I. Shine, dean of the University of California at Los
Angeles Medical School, told the committee that next year's medical
budget should be $12.42 billion, a 14 percent, or $1.48 billion,
increase over this year's total, instead of the $186 million
increase proposed in President Reagan's budget. Four veterans
organizations have endorsed a similar amount for next year.

   I have said I'd like to be ``the education president.'' Tonight,
I ask you to join me by becoming ``the education Congress.''
   Just last week, as I settled into this new office, I received a
letter from a mother in Pennsylvania, who had been struck by my
message in the inaugural address. ``Not 12 hours before,'' she
wrote, ``my husband and I received word that (our) son was addicted
to cocaine. (He) had the world at his feet. Bright, gifted,
personable ... he could have done anything with his life. (Now) he
has chosen cocaine.''
   ``Please,'' she wrote, ``find a way to curb the supply of
cocaine. Get tough with the pushers. (Our son) needs your help.''
   My friends, that voice crying out for help could be the voice of
your own neighbor. Your own friend. Your own son. Over 23 million
Americans used illegal drugs last year _ at a staggering cost to our
nation's well-being.
   Let this be recorded as the time when America rose up and said
``No'' to drugs. The scourge of drugs must be stopped. I am asking
tonight for an increase of almost a billion dollars in budget
outlays to escalate the war against drugs. The war will be waged on
all fronts.
   Our new ``drug czar,'' Bill Bennett and I will be
shoulder-to-shoulder leading the charge.
   Some money will be used to expand treatment to the poor, and to
young mothers. This will offer the helping hand to the many innocent
victims of drugs _ like the thousands of babies born addicted, or
with AIDS, because of the mother's addiction.
   Some will be used to cut the waiting time for treatment. Some
money will be devoted to those urban schools where the emergency is
now the worst. And much of it will be used to protect our borders,
with help from the Coast Guard, the Customs Service, the departments
of State and Justice, and yes, the U.S. military.
   I mean to get tough on the drug criminals. Let me be clear: this
president will back up those who put their lives on the line every
day _ our local police officers.
   My budget asks for beefed-up prosecution, for a new attack on
organized crime, and for enforcement of tough sentences _ and for
the worst kingpins, that means the death penalty.
   I also want to make sure that when a drug dealer is convicted,
there is a cell waiting for him. He should not go free because
prisons are too full.
   Let the word go out: if you are caught and convicted, you will do
time.
   But for all we do in law enforcement, in interdiction and
treatment, we will never win this war on drugs unless we stop demand
for drugs.
   So some of this increase will be used to educate the young about
the dangers of drugs. We must involve parents. We must involve
teachers. We must involve communities. And my friends, we must
involve ourselves.
   One problem related to drug use demands our urgent attention and
our continuing compassion. That is the terrible tragedy of AIDS. I
am asking for $1.6 billion for education to prevent the disease _
and for research to find a cure.

   If we're to protect our future, we need a new attitude about the
environment. We must protect the air we breathe. I will send to you
shortly legislation for a new, more effective Clean Air Act. It will
include a plan to reduce, by date certain, the emissions which cause
acid rain _ because the time for study alone has passed, and the
time for action is now.
   We must make use of clean coal. My budget contains full funding,
on schedule, for the clean coal technology agreement we have made
with Canada. We intend to honor that agreement.
   We must not neglect our parks. So I am asking to fund new
acquisitions under the land and water conservation fund.
   We must protect our oceans. I support new penalties against those
who would dump medical waste and other trash in the oceans. The age
of the needle on the beach must end.
   In some cases, the gulfs and oceans off our shores hold the
promise of oil and gas reserves which can make our nation more
secure and less dependent on foreign oil. When those with the most
promise can be tapped safely, as with much of the Alaska National
Wildlife Refuge, we should proceed. But we must use caution and we
must respect the environment.
   So tonight I am calling for the indefinite postponement of three
lease sales which have raised troubling questions _ two off the
coast of California, and one which could threaten the Everglades in
Florida. Action on these three lease sales will await the
conclusions of a special task force set up to measure the potential
for environmental damage.
   I am directing the attorney general and the administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency to use every tool at their disposal
to speed and toughen the enforcement of our laws against toxic waste
dumpers. I want faster cleanups and tougher enforcement of penalties
against polluters.
   In addition to caring for our future, we must care for those
around us. A decent society shows compassion for the young, the
elderly, the vulnerable, and the poor.
   Our first obligation is to the most vulnerable _ infants, poor
mothers, children living in poverty _ and my proposed budget
recognizes this. I ask for full funding of Medicaid _ an increase of
over $3 billion _ and an expansion of the program to include
coverage of pregnant women who are near the poverty line.
   I believe we should help working families cope with the burden of
child care. Our help should be aimed at those who need it most _
low-income families with young children. I support a new child care
tax credit that will aim our efforts at exactly those families _
without discriminating against mothers who choose to stay at home.
   Now, I know there are competing proposals. But remember this: The
overwhelming majority of all preschool child care is now provided by
relatives and neighbors, churches and community groups. Families who
choose these options should remain eligible for help. Parents should
have choice.
   And for those children who are unwanted or abused, or whose
parents are deceased, I believe we should encourage adoption. I
propose to re-enact the tax deduction for adoption expenses, and to
double it to $3,000. Let's make it easier for these kids to have
parents who love them.
   We have a moral contract with our senior citizens. In this
budget, Social Security is fully funded, including a full
cost-of-living adjustment. We must honor our contract.

   We must care about those in ``the shadows of life,'' and I, like
many Americans, am deeply troubled by the plight of the homeless.
The causes of homelessness are many, the history is long, but the
moral imperative to act is clear.
   Thanks to the deep well of generosity in this great land, many
organizations already contribute. But we in government cannot stand
on the sidelines. In my budget, I ask for greater support for
emergency food and shelter, for health services and measures to
prevent substance abuse, and for clinics for the mentally ill _ and
I propose a new initiative involving the full range of government
agencies. We must confront this national shame.
   There is another issue I decided to mention here tonight. I have
long believed that the people of Puerto Rico should have the right
to determine their own political future. Personally, I favor
statehood. But I ask the Congress to take the necessary steps to let
the people decide in a referendum.
   Certain problems, the result of decades of unwise practices,
threaten the health and security of our people. Left unattended,
they will only get worse _ but we can act now to put them behind us.
   Earlier this week, I announced my support for a plan to restore
the financial and moral integrity of our savings system. I ask
Congress to enact our reform proposals within 45 days. We must not
let this situation fester.
   Certainly, the savings of Americans must remain secure _ insured
depositors will continue to be fully protected. But any plan to
refinance the system must be accompanied by major reform. Our
proposals will prevent such a crisis from recurring. The best answer
is to make sure that a mess like this will never happen again.
   The majority of thrifts in communities across this nation have
been honest; they have played a major role in helping families
achieve the American dream of home ownership. But make no mistake:
Those who are corrupt, those who break the law, must be kicked out
of the business; and they should go to jail.
   We face a massive task in cleaning up the waste left from decades
of environmental neglect at America's nuclear weapons plants.
Clearly, we must modernize these plants and operate them safely.
That is not at issue _ our national security depends on it.
   But beyond that, we must clean up the old mess that's been left
behind _ and I propose in this budget to more than double our
current effort to do so. This will allow us to identify the exact
nature of the various problems so we can clean them up _ and clean
them up we will.
   We have been fortunate during these past eight years. America is
a stronger nation today than it was in 1980. Morale in our armed
forces is restored. Our resolve has been shown. Our readiness has
been improved. And we are at peace. There can no longer be any doubt
that peace has been made more secure through strength. When America
is stronger, the world is safer.
   Most people don't realize, that after the successful restoration
of our strength, the Pentaon budget has actually been reduced in
real terms for each of the last four years. We cannot tolerate
further reductions.
   In light of the compelling need to reduce the deficit, however, I
support a one-year freeze in the military budget _ something I
proposed last fall in my flexible freeze plan.
   This freeze will apply for only one year _ after that increases
above inflation will be required. I will not sacrifice American
preparedness; and I will not compromise American strength.

<HEAD>Bush Calls for $2 Billion Cuts in Farm Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush called on lawmakers Thursday
night to ``reform'' farm payment programs by reducing them by $2
billion next fiscal year, and the Democratic chairmen of both
agriculture committees quickly said he was cutting too hard.
   Bush's overall fiscal blueprint for Department of Agriculture
programs appeared similar to what an outgoing President Reagan
proposed a month ago, but some lawmakers expressed puzzlement over
the fine print.
   Rep. Virginia Smith, R-Neb., said the spending assumptions on
which Bush based his outline were at sharp odds with Reagan's and
that ``we will have much negotiating to do with the
administration.'' She said farmers facing more drought could not
take deeper cuts.
   ``Ultimately, Mother Nature and the U.S. Congress will have the
last word,'' the Appropriations Committee lawmaker said.
   Reagan also had proposed $2 billion in cuts in payments by the
government-owned Commodity Credit Corp. next year. But he sought to
soften the blow for farmers by making $900 million of those payments
this fiscal year.
   The Commodity Credit Corp. provides income-support payments to
cotton, rice, wheat and feed grains producers as well as
price-support loans that guard farmers against market slumps by
making the government the buyer of last resort.
   Farm payments ballooned to more than $26 billion in 1986 but
currently are costing taxpayers less than half of that as the farm
economy continues to rebound from its doldrums of the early and
mid-1980s.
   Bush's budget book said that ``provisions of current law were
designed during the height of the farm crisis.''
   ``It is now time to reform our farm programs and not wait until
the current farm bill expires nearly two years hence,'' it said. It
added that Bush has called on Agriculture Secretary Clayton K.
Yeutter to ``work with the Congress to develop a specific set of
initiatives designed to reduce federal farm expenditures by $2
billion in 1990.''
   It reviewed an array of possible means of cutting the
expenditures, ranging from a speeded up lowering of target prices
used to calculate income-support payments to reducing the number of
acres eligible for payments.
   On Capitol Hill, Rep. E. (Kika) de la Garza, D-Texas, chairman of
the House Agriculture Committee, issued a statement, saying he would
``make every effort possible to work harmoniously with my fellow
Texan, President Bush.''
   ``However, as it is currently proposed, the administration's 1990
budget still makes unreasonable demands upon agriculture which has
already given $30 billion in cuts from proposed budgets over the
last eight years.''
   ``We in agriculture are prepared to make a fair contribution, but
this administration is asking us to take cuts which represent
considerably more than our fair share of the budget-balancing
burden,'' de la Garza said.
   ``I would remind everyone that if we cut out the entire amount
proposed for agricultural spending, it would still make only an
almost infinitesimal impact on the total budget situation,'' he
added.
   Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.,
said the farm cuts envisioned would be double the automatic cuts
prescribed if Congress failed to reduce the deficit under the
Gramm-Rudman Act.
   ``An agricultural budget cutting twice as deep as the
Gramm-Rudman sequester is not a kinder and gentler budget,'' Leahy
said.
   ``When the 1990 reagan budget was released, I expressed my hope
that it was designed to make the Bush budget kinder and gentler,''
Leahy said. ``I also expressed my fear that the Reagan farm cuts
would undermine a tough U.S. negotiating position in the GATT
talks,'' he said. ``I am very disappointed that the Bush budget is
neither kinder to the farmer nor tougher on our competitors in the
GATT negotiations.''
   The GATT is the 97-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
which governs much of global commerce. Talks on updating the
agreement have been going on for the last two years.

   I should be clear on the conditions attached to my recommendation
for the coming year:
   _The savings must be allocated to those priorities for investing
in our future that I have spoken about tonight;
   _This defense freeze must be part of a comprehensive budget
agreement which meets the targets spelled out in the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law without raising taxes, and which
incorporates reforms in the budget process.
   I have directed the National Security Council to review our
national security and defense policies and report back to me within
90 days to ensure that our capabilities and resources meet our
commitments and strategies.
   I am also charging the Department of Defense with the task of
developing a plan to improve the defense procurement process and
management of the Pentagon _ one which will fully implement the
Packard Commission report. Many of the changes can only be made with
the participation of the Congress _ so I ask for your help.
   We need fewer regulations. We need less bureaucracy. We need
multiyear procurement and two-year budgeting. And frankly, we need
less congressional micromanagement of our nation's military policy.
   Securing a more peaceful world is perhaps the most important
priority I'd like to address tonight. We meet at a time of
extraordinary hope. Never before in this century have our values of
freedom, democracy, and economic opportunity been such a powerful
political and intellectual force around the globe.
   Never before has our leadership been so crucial, because while
America has its eyes on the future, the world has its eyes on
America.
   It is a time of great change in the world _ and especially in the
Soviet Union. Prudence and common sense dictate that we try to
understand the full meaning of the change going on there, review our
policies carefully, and proceed with caution. But I have personally
assured General Secretary Gorbachev that, at the conclusion of such
a review, we will be ready to move forward. We will not miss any
opportunity to work for peace.
   The fundamental fact remains that the Soviets retain a very
powerful military machine, in the service of objectives which are
still too often in conflict with ours. So let us take the new
openness seriously. Let us step forward to negotiate. But let us
also be realistic. And let us always be strong.
   There are some pressing issues we must address: I will vigorously
pursue the Strategic Defense Initiative. The spread and even use of
sophisticated weaponry threatens global stability as never before.
   Chemical weapons must be banned from the face of the Earth, never
to be used again. This won't be easy. Verification will be
difficult. But civilization and human decency demand that we try.
   And the spread of nuclear weapons must be stopped. I will work to
strengthen the hand of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Our
diplomacy must work every day against the proliferation of nuclear
weapons.
   And, around the globe, we must continue to be freedom's best
friend. We must stand firm for self-determination and democracy in
Central America _ including in Nicaragua. For when people are given
the chance, they inevitably will choose a free press, freedom of
worship, and certifiably free and fair elections.

   We must strengthen the alliance of industrial democracies _ as
solid a force for peace as the world has ever known. This is an
alliance forged by the power of our ideals, not the pettiness of our
differences. So let us lift our sights _ to rise above fighting
about beef hormones to building a better future, to move from
protectionism to progress.
   I have asked the secretary of state to visit Europe next week and
to consult with them on the wide range of challenges and
opportunities we face together _ including East-West relations. And
I look forward to meeting with our NATO partners in the near future.
   I, too, shall begin a trip shortly _ to the far reaches of the
Pacific Basin, where the winds of democracy are creating new hope,
and the power of free markets is unleashing a new force.
   When I served as our representative in China just 14 years ago,
few would have predicted the scope of the changes we've witnessed
since then. But in preparing for this trip, I was struck by
something I came across from a Chinese writer. He was speaking of
his country, decades ago _ but his words speak to each of us, in
America, tonight.
   ``Today,'' he said, ``we are afraid of the simple words like
goodness and mercy and kindness.''
   My friends, if we're to succeed as a nation, we must rediscover
those words.
   In just three days, we mark the birthday of Abraham Lincoln _ the
man who saved our union, and gave new meaning to the word
opportunity. Lincoln once said: ``I hold that while man exists, it
is his duty to improve not only his own condition, but to assist in
ameliorating (that of) mankind.''
   It is this broader mission to which I call all Americans. Because
the definition of a successful life must include serving others.
   To the young people of America, who sometimes feel left out _ I
ask you tonight to give us the benefit of your talent and energy
through a new program called ``YES,'' for Youth Entering Service to
America.
   To those men and women in business _ remember the ultimate end of
your work _ to make a better product, to create better lives. I ask
you to plan for the longer-term and avoid the temptation of quick
and easy paper profits.
   To the brave men and women who wear the uniform of the United
States of America _ thank you. Your calling is a high one _ to be
the defenders of freedom and the guarantors of liberty. And I want
you to know that the nation is grateful for your service.
   To the farmers of America, we appreciate the bounty you provide.
We will work with you to open foreign markets to American
agricultural products.
   To the parents of America, I ask you to get involved in your
child's schooling. Check on their homework. Go to the school, meet
the teachers, care about what is happening there. It is not only
your child's future on the line, it is America's.
   To kids in our cities _ don't give up hope. Say no to drugs. Stay
in school. And yes, ``Keep hope alive.''
   To those 37 million Americans with some form of disability _ you
belong in the economic mainstream. We need your talents in America's
work force. Disabled Americans must become full partners in
America's opportunity society.

   The yacht Thursday's Child has been slowed
by poor winds in its quest to break a New York-to-San Francisco
speed record that has stood for 135 years, the sloop's ground
support said Thursday.
   ``It would be miraculous if they made it by Friday,'' said
spokeswoman Nancy Lush, from the St. Francis Yacht Club, where
Thursday's Child will berth after reaching the finish line marked by
the Golden Gate bridge.
   The racer reported by radio at midday Thursday it was 300 miles
south of the Golden Gate, making only 6 knots in unfavorable winds,
she said.
   The 60-foot, 10-ton state-of-the-art racing sloop entered
California waters before dawn. If it made the Golden Gate by Friday,
Thursday's Child would crack the 1854 mark set by the clipper Flying
Cloud by 10 days.
   But the support group estimated that at the current rate, the
arrival probably would be on Saturday.
   The three-member crew, who left New York on Nov. 23, closed in on
the world's oldest existing speed record, duplicating a 14,500-mile
passage around fearsome Cape Horn at the tip of South America. The
legendary three-masted Flying Cloud made the journey in 89 days, 8
hours.
   After hitting gale-force winds up to 40 knots earlier in the day,
Thursday's Child apparently hit shifting winds to the north, forcing
it into a time consuming tacking drill across the wind in order to
continue north, said Steve Black, part of the boat's ground support.
   Black said the three crewmen were all well. They are skipper
Courtney Hazleton, 32; owner and master Warren Luhrs, 44, and Lars
Bergstrom, 54, who helped design the vessel, which features the
latest in push-button satellite navigation equipment.
   Earlier this week Hazleton called the adventure ``some of the
finest sailing I ever had. I would do it again at the drop of a
hat.''
   Even if Thursday's Child succeeds in breaking the record, the
vessel's mark may be vanquished before it can even be written in the
history books. Black said three other boats are now at sea trying to
better Thursday Child's time.
   The merchantman Flying Cloud, with its 17-story masts that could
carry 35 sails, was the marvel of its day. It was reputed the
fastest of thousands of sailing vessels that raced each other across
the Atlantic and Pacific, often with perishable cargoes.

   To the families of America watching tonight in your living rooms:
Hold fast to your dreams, because ultimately America's future rests
in your hands.
   And to my friends in this chamber, I ask for your cooperation to
keep America growing while cutting the deficit. That is only fair to
those who now have no vote _ the generations to come.
   Let them look back and say that we had the foresight to
understand that a time of peace and prosperity is not a time to
rest, but a time to push forward. A time to invest in the future.
   And let all Americans remember that no problem of human making is
too great to be overcome by human ingenuity, human energy, and the
untiring hope of the human spirit. I believe this. I would not have
asked to be your president if I didn't.
   Tomorrow, the debate on the plan I have put forward begins. I ask
the Congress to come forward with your proposals, if they are
different. Let us not question each other's motives. Let us debate.
Let us negotiate. But let us solve the problem.
   Recalling anniversaries may not be my specialty in speeches _ but
tonight is one of some note. On Feb. 9, 1941, just 48 years ago
tonight, Sir Winston Churchill took to the airwaves during Britain's
hour of peril.
   He had received from President Roosevelt a hand-carried letter
quoting Longfellow's famous poem: ``Sail on, Oh Ship of State! Sail
on, Oh Union, strong and great! Humanity with all its fears, with
all the hopes of future years, Is hanging breathless on my fate!''
   Churchill responded on this night by radio broadcast to a nation
at war, but he directed his words to Roosevelt. ``We shall not fail
or falter,'' he said. ``We shall not weaken or tire. Give us the
tools, and we will finish the job.''
   Tonight, almost a half-century later, our peril may be less
immediate, but the need for perseverance and clear-sighted fortitude
is just as great.
   Now, as then, there are those who say it can't be done. There are
voices who say that America's best days have past. That we are bound
by constraints, threatened by problems, surrounded by troubles which
limit our ability to hope.
   Well, tonight I remain full of hope. We Americans have only begun
on our mission of goodness and greatness. And to those timid souls,
I repeat the plea _ give us the tools; and we will do the job.

<HEAD>Iran's Leaders Say Seeking Gulf War Victory Was Mistake</HEAD>

   Iranian leaders said they may have made a
mistake by trying to win a military victory over Iraq and said the
U.S. Navy's intervention in the Persian Gulf was a setback that may
have decided the war.
   President Ali Khamenei, Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani and
Chief Justice Musavi Ardebili also said in interviews with the
official Islamic Republic News Agency that the Islamic revolution is
still a long way from reaching its objectives.
   The interviews, monitored in Nicosia in recent days, came as Iran
celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution with the
leadership divided over what direction Iran should go.
   The comments on the war and Iran's strategic failures were the
first by senior figures to shed light on the inner workings of
Tehran's military planning and its eventual decision to accept last
year's cease-fire in the 8-year-old gulf war.
   Ardebili noted that the naval intervention in the gulf by the
U.S. and several European navies to protect shipping from Iranian
attack was a severe jolt for Tehran.
   ``We saw that the United States was prepared to send its navy
into the Persian Gulf and pull the world along with it,'' he said.
``We had not taken that into account.''
   He noted: ``I am among those who believe that the war should have
been stopped after the liberation of Khorramshahr.''
   The Iraqis were driven out of that southern Iranian port city on
the Shatt al-Arab waterway in 1982, nearly two years after they
invaded Iran following border skirmishes.
   The Iranian news agency did not say whether Ardebili indicated he
had opposed Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, whose objective was to
defeat Iraq and topple President Saddam Hussein, in 1982 or sought
to convince him to end the war after the Iraqis were driven back
across the border.
   The news agency quoted Rafsanjani as saying of Iran's aim of
military victory: ``We took too big a bite.
   ``Yes, we wanted something, but were not able to get it, and that
was military victory. If we had moved with a bit more planning maybe
it would not have been so far off.''
   Ardebili said that Iran accepted the U.N. cease-fire resolution
last year after the Iranian leadership ``had done some calculations
on our capabilities'' after a series of Iraqi offensives that left
Iranian forces in disarray.
   The news agency reported few comments by Khamenei on the conduct
of the war. But when asked whether the revolution had achieved its
goals, he was quoted as saying: ``It's true we have not reached our
destination and we might not even be halfway there.
   ``But we have started to move in the right direction and this is
very important. So the revolution can by no means be branded a
failure.''

<HEAD>Former Minister Leaves Grilling Without Egg on Her Face</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former junior health minister Edwina Currie emerged
smiling Wednesday from a grilling by fellow lawmakers over her
remark that most British egg production was affected by food
poisoning bacteria.
   ``She stonewalled every question and acted like a grande dame,''
said lawmaker Ann Winterton, a fellow Conservative Party member,
after the session of the House of Commons Select Committee on
Agriculture.
   For nearly eight weeks Mrs. Currie resisted the committee's
summons to appear before it to explain her remark which outraged
poultry farmers and led to tons of unsold eggs.
   In an off-the-cuff remark in a brief TV interview she said:
``Most of the egg production in this country, sadly, is now infected
with salmonella.''
   Her notorious words came during a scare over dangers from eating
eggs, when one possible cause of infection mentioned was bad feed
given to chickens.
   As farmers filed lawsuits against the government seeking
compensation, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ordered Mrs. Currie
to resign nine days before Christmas.
   Mrs. Currie told the committee she hadn't meant that most eggs
were affected by salmonella bacteria, as one committee member
suggested. She said that was a misrepresentation by the media.
   Mrs. Currie said she still believed that a significant number of
birds in a significant number of laying flocks were infected. So
many eggs were eaten every day that even if only a small proportion
of them were affected by the bacteria, they amounted to a very large
number, she said.
   Mrs. Currie, 42, showed up before the bipartisan committee after
it threatened to force a House of Commons motion compelling her to
appear. The Times of London said this procedure was last used 350
years ago.
   The government is paying out nearly nearly $7 million in
compensation for 108 million eggs destroyed and some 450,000
slaughtered chickens. It also launched an $865,000 advertising
campaign to reassure people they could eat eggs without fear _
although it was best to hard-boil them for little children, the
elderly and the sick.

   President Bush tonight unveils a budget plan
keyed to his campaign promises of ``kinder and gentler'' programs
without new taxes, but it leaves difficult decisions on reducing the
federal deficit for later.
   The president, in a 9 p.m. EST speech before a joint meeting of
Congress, will call for a nation more competitive abroad and more
compassionate at home.
   To those ends, he will propose more federal spending in fiscal
1990 for clean air and clean coal technology, for science and space,
for AIDS research and aid to the homeless, education and child care,
according to administration and congressional sources.
   Bush claims that those costs will be offset by about $4 billion
in new revenue from a controversial cut in the capital gains tax _
another campaign promise _ and $2 billion by holding the expansion
of the military budget to the rate of inflation.

   ``Everything seemed
perfectly normal'' as a Caribbean-bound Boeing 707 turned and flew
straight into a fog-shrouded island mountain, a witness said. All
144 people aboard were believed killed.
   The U.S. charter, carrying Italian vacationers and a seven-member
American crew, was approaching Santa Maria island's airport for
refueling Wednesday when it hit 1,794-foot Pico Alto mountain and
burst into flames.
   Its pilot had not reported any trouble in a radio conversation
with the airport three minutes earlier, the Portuguese news agency
LUSA reported.
   Witnesses said the jet hit a lower slope, bounced over a road,
lost an engine and crashed into the mountain. Bodies were spread
over a wide and rugged wooded area about 24 miles northeast of the
airport.

   Organized crime will dominate all gambling on
Indian reservations in 10 years unless the federal government acts
swiftly, a former Mafia figure who ran tribal bingo games contends.
   ``Anytime there's easy money, the mob will jump in,'' said the
witness, who wore a gray hood and testified behind a screen in his
appearance Wednesday before a special investigative unit of the
Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs.
   The witness, whose voice was altered electronically to disguise
his identity further, said the Bureau of Indian Affairs has been
useless and the FBI is uninformed when it comes to infiltration by
La Cosa Nostra on reservations.
   Anthony Daniels, deputy assistant director of the criminal
investigation for the FBI, had told the panel earlier that
``allegations of LCN involvement sometimes exceed actual fact.''

   The husband of a comatose woman begged an appeals
court to let him end his wife's pregnancy to save her life, and said
in an interview that anti-abortionists who oppose him are ``ripping
my guts out.''
   ``I implore this court not to permit these two strangers to delay
my decision,'' Martin Klein said in an affidavit submitted to a
state appeals court Wednesday.
   Klein, a 34-year-old accountant from the Long Island suburb of
Upper Brookville, wants to be named guardian of his wife, Nancy, so
he can authorize an abortion that several doctors said could aid in
her recovery.
   But anti-abortion activists John Short and John Broderick have
sought to block him, saying that aborting the fetus will not improve
Mrs. Klein's chances and will harm her psychologically. They have
applied to become her guardian to prevent the abortion.

   It didn't look like happy trails for CBS, but
``Lonesome Dove'' has ridden to the rescue.
   The success of CBS' four-night Western has not only boosted
morale at the third-place network, but sent audience shares of CBS,
ABC and NBC soaring into the 80s in a season that has been averaging
percentages in the 60s.
   ``Lonesome Dove'' has more than met CBS' guarantee to
advertisers. Televisions in an estimated 25.7 million homes were
tuned to CBS for the series' first installment.
   Instead of the less-than-30 share the network expected, the
miniseries is headed for an average share closer to 40. The share is
a percentage of televisions in use.

<HEAD>Britain's Disabled Still Face Problems Getting along in Society</HEAD>

   Twenty years ago, Bert Massie had trouble getting
served in restaurants. Fire regulations were cited by proprietors to
keep him out of movie theaters and nightclubs. On trains, he rode in
the baggage or mail car without light, heating or access to a
restroom.
   Things aren't that bad these days for Massie, a 39-year-old polio
victim who has been using a wheelchair since childhood. But welfare
groups say many disabled people in Britain are faced with poor
facilities, unemployment, poverty and public indifference.
   ``There has been a transformation,'' Massie said in an interview.
``That's not to say there's not a lot more to do.''
   He recalls going into a cafe in northern England in the late
1960s and being told by the manageress, ``We don't serve
wheelchairs.''
   ``I told her the wheelchair wasn't hungry.''
   Nowadays, he said, restaurants automatically remove a chair at a
table to make room for his wheelchair; movie theaters and nightclub
workers carry him upstairs if necessary; British Rail, given one or
two days' notice, will provide a space in a first-class compartment
for a second-class ticket.
   But branch-line trains, or locals, with non-sliding doors still
relegate wheelchair users to the car or compartment at the end of a
train that is used by crewman known as the train guard.
   All public buildings built since 1987 must be
wheelchair-accessible. But many existing offices, hotels, shops,
restaurants, pubs and theaters in London, like other European
cities, have steps and lack suitable elevators and toilets.
   ``I think a lot of people are in the margin. ... I don't think
disabled people yet are treated as totally equal citizens,'' said
Massie, an assistant director in the Royal Association for
Disability and Rehabilitation, a national umbrella body for 440
disability groups.
   Critics say the government does not adequately cover the extra
costs of being disabled, leaving many caught in what opposition
Labor Party legislator Jack Ashley called ``a poverty trap.''
   Ashley, who is deaf, said in an interview: ``Because many of them
are poor, they clearly aren't able to integrate into society as much
as they ought to be able to and we want better financial provision
for them.
   ``Poverty is something which is almost part and parcel of
disability.''
   Ashley is chairman of the All-Party Disablement Group in
Parliament.
   Disabled rights groups want a tax-free national disability income
of $70 to $225 a week.
   A 1985-88 government survey found that 6.2 million adults in
Britain, or one in nine, have at least one disability that
significantly impairs their activity. Almost 70 percent are over 60.
   The report said disabled people under 65 earned an average net
income of $171 a week, compared with $238 among the general
population. Most disabled people live on state aid, it said.
   The Conservative government said it spent $12 billion last year
on disability benefits, 90 percent more in real terms than in 1979
when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher took power.
   But critics charge the government is cutting back, slowing down
funds for remodeling private houses and preventing disabled people
from moving out of state institutions.
   ``There is a constant battle making sure what has been won will
not be lost,'' Massie said.
   Disability groups estimate that about two-thirds of disabled
people available for work are unemployed. The law obliges companies
to hire a quota of disabled people, but statistics indicate that
only 27 percent comply.
   The 1944 law says ``it is not an offense to be below quota''
unless an employer rejects a suitable disabled person.
   ``In certain cases, there are not enough disabled people to fit
those jobs,'' said Employment Department spokesman Mike Webb. ``Any
firm can ask for exemption and it is almost always granted.''
   The government said it is committed to integrating disabled
children into mainstream schools, and pays 554,000 adults $40 a week
in ``mobility allowance,'' enabling many to buy cars.
   Alice O'Flynn, 52, a stroke victim who also uses a wheelchair,
said she has to get by on a weekly income of $165.
   ``I think we're put on the scrapheap,'' she said. ``It can be
difficult at times. I have to go without.''
   Britain's National Health Service provides free wheelchairs,
artificial limbs and hearing aids.
   Specially adapted buses operate between major railroad stations
and to airports, and two London sightseeing buses have recently been
fitted with elevators. By the year 2000, all taxis must have access
for wheelchair users. London's subways and buses are largely
inaccessible to wheelchair users, and some sports stadiums lack
parking for the handicapped. The handicapped, however, are allowed
to park in no-parking areas for up to two hours.

<HEAD>Abortion Law under Attack in Italy as More Doctors Object</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten years after Italy legalized abortion, the law is
under attack by those who maintain it is too loose and has failed to
stop ``back alley'' abortions.
   After bitter debate and street protests by pro-and-con forces,
Parliament approved the Socialist-designed abortion law in May 1978
over the objections of the Roman Catholic Church. Three years later,
the anti-abortion Movement for Life, led by a Christian Democrat
politician, tried to overturn the law by a popular referendum, but
lost 67.3 percent to 32.7.
   Now the Movement for Life and other anti-abortion forces close to
the church are clamoring for changes that would drastically restrict
the cases in which abortion is permitted.
   ``They don't want a referendum now,'' says Luigi Laratta, who
heads the Italian Association for Demographic Education, roughly the
equivalent of Planned Parenthood. ``But in a couple of years, there
will be the climate for it.''
   Laratta was referring to the increased political clout of such
conservative groups as Communion and Liberation. The group, founded
by a Milanese priest as a foil to leftist groups, enjoys
considerable support from the Christian Democrats, Italy's dominant
political party.
   A telephone survey by Panorama, a leading newsweekly, found that
51.6 percent of those polled thought the law was just, while 47.5
percent did not and 0.9 percent didn't know. Of those who considered
themselves ``practicing'' Catholics, 59.3 percent said the law was
not just and only 39.2 said it was just; 1.4 percent of them didn't
know.
   Among the champions for restrictions on the current law is Health
Minister Carlo Donat Cattin, a Christian Democrat.
   Even some of the law's original supporters say the time has come
to correct what many see as abuses that both widen loopholes for
midterm abortions and make it difficult for a women to obtain a
legal one.
   The law requires public hospitals and those that accept patients
paid for by the government to have doctors available to perform
abortions. It forbids private clinics from doing them.
   In a major concession to anti-abortion forces, it allows doctors,
nurses and orderlies at public hospitals who object to abortion to
be excused from performing them or assisting in them.
   Both sides agree doctors have abused the clause to further their
careers. The critics say some doctors invoke the clause in order to
devote more time to practicing other procedures and gaining
experience that could lead to a better-paid post at a private clinic.
   Estimates put the percentage of objecting doctors at 60 percent
to 70 percent. Some public hospitals in the south, Italy's poorest
and most conservative region, were forced to stop performing
abortions because all of their doctors became objectors.
   The result is that many women either must put up with long
waiting periods or go to private clinics and pay as much as $730 for
an illegal abortion. Others turn to ``mammane,'' women who perform
abortions secretly in their homes, often in unsanitary conditions or
with crude instruments that harm the woman.
   Eliminating clandestine abortions was the aim of the law.
   In 1986, an estimated 125,000 illegal abortions were performed in
Italy, compared to 196,490 legal procedures.
   The 1978 law permits abortions in the 13th through 20th week of
pregnancy only if the mother's health is jeopardized or the fetus
has deformities. But anti-abortion forces charge that the
restriction is frequently ignored. Communion and Liberation has
called for the establishment of ethics committees in public
hospitals to decide whether to approve midterm abortions.
   The debate over abortion exploded when Health Minister Cattin
ordered the seizure of patients' records at a Milan hospital where
two ``objector'' doctors claimed a woman had been allowed to abort
in her fifth month for a fetal deformity they judged not very
serious.
   Cattin's actions sparked cries of violation of patients' rights
of privacy and calls by the communists for his resignation.
   Laratta and others who want to keep the abortion law say the
state must do more to promote contraceptive use.
   Some 2 million abortions have been performed legally in Italy,
now a country of 56 million people, since the law was passed, and
the number of abortions has been slowly decreasing in the past few
years. Italy did not approve use of government health insurance for
payment of birth control bills, intrauterine devices (IUDs) and
diaphrams until 1981.
   Birth control use in Italy is low but on the rise. Laratta says
in 1984, only 3.3 percent of women in Calabria, in the deep south,
used ``secure'' methods such as the pill or an IUD, while the figure
for the industrial north was about 10 percent to 11 percent. Latest
figures put the use of these methods in the south at about 12
percent and overall Italy at less than 20 percent.

<HEAD>New Centers Sprouting in Japan as Tokyo Fills to Its Limits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSAKA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Japanese are beginning to look away from
Tokyo as the nation's power center and toward places like Osaka or
Kumamoto in the far-off south for new development and economic
influence.
   The new thrust: Japan is not just Tokyo.
   For many Japanese now crammed into the capital city, it could
mean a return to their roots in the countryside for good jobs and
less stressful living.
   Here in the heart of this industrial city a dozen new skycrapers
tower over the Osaka Castle, a 400-year-old landmark, casting their
shadow on a serene historic site but at the same time looming as a
new symbol of decentralization in Japan.
   The complex, called Osaka Business Park, is one of dozens of
large-scale development projects launched by local business groups
in a campaign to reverse the flow of economic power to Tokyo.
   Not only mighty regional centers like Osaka but smaller and more
remote towns also have begun their own development projects that are
luring high-tech industry and beckoning their talented offspring
home from Tokyo.
   One such place is Kumamoto, 560 miles southwest of Tokyo, about
as far away from the capital as you can get without leaving Japan
proper. It is the first of 26 locations designated as a
``technopolis'' by the Ministry of Internatinal Trade and Industry.
   The model city there already has research facilities and is to be
expanded to encompass two cities, 12 towns and two villages and
cover nearly 40 square miles.
   It's tranquil, ``affluent and easy-going'' says Morihiro
Hosokawa, the local governor. It also has an abundance of flat,
cheap land.
   The area already has persuaded major corporations like Honda
Motors and Matsushita Electric to set up branch offices. It is also
the home of Kyushu NEC, which claims to be the world's largest
producer of integrated circuits.
   For decades, Tokyo has been at the pinnacle of Japan's highly
centralized society, drawing much of the best the nation had to
offer. But as its concentration of political power and its growing
role as a world financial center stretch its physical and spiritual
limits, more Japanese are beginning to think the capital's dominance
should be reduced.
   Planners also warn that another earthquake in Tokyo like the one
that killed 143,000 people in 1923 could devastate the country's
centralized infrastructure and severely damage both the Japanese and
world economies.
   Osaka, Japan's business and industrial center before World War
II, is in the western Kansai region about 250 miles southwest of
Tokyo.
   Community and business leaders there have begun a massive
development program for the region of more than 13.5 million people.
The project calls for the building of Japan's first 24-hour
international airport, a Kansai Science City for students,
researchers and their families, and the Asia and Pacific Trade
Center, planned with the hope of displacing Hong Kong as a major
distribution center for Asia once the British colony reverts to
Chinese rule in 1997.
   By the year 2000, direct investment in the projects will total at
least $122 billion, analysts say, with indirect investment possibly
doubling that figure.
   During Japan's postwar rush to reindustrialize, few questioned
Tokyo's dominance. With the best schools, jobs and entertainment,
Tokyo drew millions who dreamed of better lives as well as hundreds
of companies wanting to be near government agencies, banks,
financial markets and up-to-date information.
   As a result, more power has become concentrated in Tokyo than in
almost any other single city in the world.
   Thirty million people live in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area
_ a quarter of Japan's population crowded into 2 percent of its area
_ triggering the highest land prices in the world; choice commerical
real estate was selling for $6.7 billion an acre last year. For
those unable to afford to live in Tokyo itself, commuting to work
can take more than four hours a day.
   While Tokyo's attraction still hasn't faded, people in rural
areas and cities like Osaka have begun emphasizing their own local
strengths and diversity.
   ``Cultural and technological over-centralization is dangerous,
and if we don't do something about it, it's likely to create cracks
in our society,'' says Kazuro Kuriyama, head of research for the
Kansai Economic Federation, a grouping of Kansai businesses.
   For many Japanese, regional revitalization means a return to
traditional values at a time when so many people no longer live with
their relatives or in their hometowns.
   Towns are reviving and promoting local festivals, crafts and
delicacies, while TV shows such as ``Rediscover Japan'' and
``Wonderful Trip Around Japan'' introduce the lifestyle and customs
of local communities.
   Beer companies are introducing ``local flavor'' brews designed to
appeal to local pride and taste, and the post office plans to
release a new series of regional stamps.
   Even the national government is encouraging a shift away from
Tokyo.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita has said the government will
distribute 100 million yen ($800,000) to each of 3,200 or so
villages, towns and cities for use in improvement projects.
   The Cabinet also is moving 79 secondary government bodies out of
Tokyo.

   Karen Russell's frantic screams rattled
windows up and down Valley Spring Lane, but no Samaritans on this
quiet suburban street abandoned their Thursday night suppers to come
to her rescue.
   Even Miss Russell's friends and colleagues _ standing just yards
from the violent poolside assault _ kept perfectly still.
   Finally, when he had seen enough, Dave DeCoteau looked at the
fallen woman, put his hands in his pockets, and smiled a thin smile.
``OK,'' he said. ``Let's move on.''
   As the director of the low-budget horror film ``Beverly Hills
Corpse,'' DeCoteau's mission was to produce dead bodies as quickly
as possible _ such efficiency is the only way cheap movies can make
a profit. The ugly death of Miss Russell, slain by corpse-like hands
rocketing out of a swimming pool, left one less butchering to film.
   Sparing every imaginable expense _ actors brought their own
costumes, crew members earned minimum wage and almost everything but
the 16mm film itself was borrowed _ the makers of ``Beverly Hills
Corpse'' were able to film half a dozen garrotings and impalings in
only five days.
   A visit to the ``Beverly Hills Corpse'' set illuminates a
different, frequently overlooked side of Hollywood. Unlike
flamboyant, high-budget productions that swim with celebrities and
hype, this film reflects true, unknown blue-collar labor _ much
work, little acclaim.
   Where directors Steven Spielberg and Francis Ford Coppola might
use a dozen or so camera setups in a day, DeCoteau (``Nightmare
Sisters,'' ``Creepozoids,'' ``Lady Avenger'') raced through 57 moves
in one 13-hour shoot. In the time it takes ``serious'' movie makers
to shoot just one 15-minute sequence, the 90-minute ``Beverly Hills
Corpse'' was already in the can.
   ``OK. Let's move on,'' is the battle cry of this brand of film
making.
   The plot of ``Beverly Hills Corpse'' is admittedly witless. A few
studly young men stroll into a house, chat with two women who don't
wear much clothing, have sex with them, and then pretty much
everybody dies.
   The movie does not pretend to be anything it is not. Said
screenwriter Ross Perron, asked if he minds his scripts being called
exploitive: ``Why should I mind? They are.''
   Its lack of sophistication aside, ``Beverly Hills Corpse'' could
become more profitable than, say, ``Tequila Sunrise'' or a large
percentage of the major studio releases now costing an average $17
million apiece.
   Made on a budget of only $50,000, ``Beverly Hills Corpse'' can,
with any measure of domestic and international videocassette sales,
realize a net gain.
   The dilemma on the set, then, was to keep costs so low they're
subterranean, but still spit out a movie that, if little else, was
in focus. Though shots were hurriedly lighted and most scenes were
captured in only one or two camera takes, DeCoteau's genius rests on
an aptitude to make really cheap films look only semi-cheap,
delivering them on budget and on time. Only 26, he has directed or
produced 12 B titles.
   ``Beverly Hills Corpse'' relied upon a good-natured, well
choreographed ensemble of young technicians and struggling actors
united by the challenges of guerrilla film making. A motorcycle used
in one scene was appropriated from sound mixer D.J. Ritchie. ``We
cannibalize everything,'' said co-producer and first assistant
director Fred Kennamer. ``We used my car in `Assault of the Killer
Bimbos.'''
   Given a rare chance to work in a highly competitive business, the
cast and crew of ``Beverly Hills Corpse'' willingly accepted pay far
below union rates and read dialogue so wooden the script gave them
splinters.
   ``All of us are stars on the way up. This is just a stop along
the way,'' said Mike Jacobs Jr., who is featured in ``Beverly Hills
Corpse'' as a rock singer named Eric who _ through some fluke of the
script _ actually walks away alive at the end of the movie.
   Out-of-work actress Lillie Fields (she played a nameless
screaming woman in the 1988 remake of ``The Blob'') shared Jacobs'
optimism. On the set not as a performer but as the ``craft
services'' supervisor, Ms. Fields spent one recent afternoon
refilling the carrot-stick tray at the film's small snack table.
   ``It's nice working here,'' said Ms. Fields, a theater graduate
of the University of Illinois who recently moved to Southern
California, ``because you make friends and they might have friends
and then they can say to their friends, `Hey, I have this friend who
needs a SAG card.'''
   Membership in SAG, the Screen Actors Guild, is a Hollywood
paradox: You can't act in a big feature film without a SAG card, but
you can't obtain a SAG card unless you've acted in a big feature
film.
   But for those actors and crew members who see ``Beverly Hills
Corpse'' as a step up to a more glorious future, there are others _
like actress Linnea Quigley _ who more or less revel on the lower
rungs.
   Miss Quigley, whose resume includes ``Hollywood Chainsaw
Hookers,'' ``Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama,'' ``Blood
Nasty'' and the upcoming ``Assault of the Party Nerds,'' has
established herself as the Meryl Streep of the slice-and-dice genre.
Ask her to go topless (or more) or die a horrible death, and she'll
meet the challenge gamely.
   Said makeup artist Cindy Warren: ``She always knows her lines.
She's always on time. And she never messes up.''
   Yet it seems incongruous for Miss Quigley to appear in movies
featuring countless decapitations and other abuses: She is a
vegetarian and animal rights activist. ``I won't do a movie where
there's violence toward animals,'' she said.
   And though usually semi-nude on camera, she calls herself ``shy''
and says, ``I wouldn't feel safe at a nude beach.''
   Ultimately, though, it is Miss Quigley's and Miss Russell's naked
bodies, not their death scenes or acting talents, that will bring
``Beverly Hills Corpse'' whatever riches it might gather when it
debuts on videocassette later this summer.
   The film, lacking both requisite quality and financial backing,
will never make it to movie theaters. Like many of its independently
produced kin, its future will be decided at video stores both here
and abroad: With rentals costing a buck a night, home video fans
have much more tolerance for lesser films.
   And since there are no ratings for videos, there's no such word
as ``unsuitable.''
   ``Most foreign markets won't accept adult movies,'' said
screenwriter Perron. ``So horror movies (with nudity) fill the niche
_ they pass right by the censors.''
   While Perron talked, the real art of slasher film making was
being discussed in the next room, where makeup artist Warren
conferred with special-effects expert Rick LaLonde.
   They wanted to make sure an upcoming throat slashing went well.
As the two held up their own concoctions of fake blood, Ms. Warren
suddenly looked very serious and said, ``Do you want the more
jugular blood or the capillary blood?''
   On such fine points, bad horror movies become better.

<BYLINE>A Solo ``Shirley'' Heads For Broadway</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pauline Collins is Broadway-bound in a solo play
that took London by storm last winter, but it's a mixed blessing for
the British actress to go it alone in a foreign country.
   ``The sad thing is, you've got no one to nudge from the stage and
say, `Isn't this good or bad or whatever,''' said the lone performer
in Willy Russell's ``Shirley Valentine,'' opening Feb. 16 at the
Booth Theater.
   On the plus side, Collins is appearing in material she admires, a
luxury not always available to actors.
   ``First of all, I really love the play; I left (the London run)
feeling I hadn't had enough,'' said the actress, best-known to
Americans as Sarah, the downstairs maid in the popular British TV
series ``Upstairs, Downstairs.''
   Written by the author of ``Educating Rita'' and the current
London musical ``Blood Brothers,'' ``Shirley Valentine'' is a
lengthy, essentially comic soliloquy about a bored Liverpudlian
housewife who at age 42 decides to do something about her ``unused
life.''
   Collins emphasized that ``Shirley Valentine'' is more than a
series of barbed, knowing one-liners.
   ``This is a play. That's the extraordinary thing about it,''
Collins said over coffee in the spacious north London home she
shares with her husband, actor John Alderton, and their three
children.
   ``Shirley Valentine'' premiered in 1986 in Russell's native
Liverpool, with local actress Noreen Kershaw. It opened on London's
commercial West End last January, winning Collins the best actress
award from Drama Magazine and a nomination for this year's Laurence
Olivier Awards. A separate production opened in Sydney, Australia,
on Dec. 30.
   In the fall, Collins beat out such candidates as Cher to repeat
the part in the movie version with added characters played by Tom
Conti and Julia McKenzie. Due for release next September, it is
directed by Lewis Gilbert, who filmed ``Educating Rita.''
   The $750,000 Broadway production is being staged by its London
director, Simon Callow, the British movie and stage actor (``A Room
With a View,'' ``Amadeus'') making his New York directorial debut.
   Collins, who grew up near Liverpool, is confident that the
British references and phrases in ``Shirley Valentine'' won't limit
its appeal.
   ``There's always that which is undone in all of us, that little
bit more you ought to do,'' Collins said of Shirley's dilemma, as
the character takes solace from drudgery in her wit and dreams of
escape.
   The role is partly a lighter variant of Collins' previous West
End assignment, replacing Julia McKenzie as the anguished
middle-class housewife in Alan Ayckbourn's ``Woman in Mind.''
   But she feels ``Shirley Valentine'' has helped widen her acting
range.
   ``It allowed me to move into an area closer to my own age,
because I think when you have a round face, you tend to be caught in
a peculiar nebulous youth for a long time,'' said Collins, dark
shoulder-length hair framing her full cheeks.
   ``Because of the way the world is moving now, there's a greater
interest, and indeed a greater market, for plays about middle-aged
people,'' said Collins, 48, who spent years playing pert and
youthful comic leads in such vehicles as Oscar Wilde's ``The
Importance of Being Earnest'' and Bernard Slade's ``Romantic
Comedy.''
   ``There are a lot of middle-aged people about with money to spend
who want to see themselves on screen and stage and even as models.''
   Television roles occupy much of her time. In the spring, she and
her husband will appear in six one-hour episodes of a new show,
``Forever Green,'' about a London couple who uproot to the country.
Frequent collaborators, the couple were seen on American TV in the
show ``No, Honestly,'' but they resisted offers to remake the series
appearing as two Americans.
   Facing her first Broadway appearance, Collins knows the stakes
are high. ``The line between success and failure is very much
stronger there; you're either a success, or you ain't,'' she said.
   But she is philosophical about the much-vaunted power of the New
York critics.
   ``There's no point wasting energy worrying about that,'' Collins
said. ``All I can do is put the best I can into it and hope they
like it. If they don't, then presumably their power will close it,
so I won't be suffering too long.''

<HEAD>Berlin Festival Exposes Scars of War 50 Years After Its Outbreak</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifty years after the outbreak of World War II, the
1989 Berlin International Film Festival has paused for reflection on
the conflict that divided Europe and is probing the scars it
inflicted throughout the world.
   The 39th annual film event has set no specific war theme for this
year's contest and will in fact exhibit some prominent entries
delving into unrelated subjects, such as Alan Parker's ``Mississippi
Burning'' and Barry Levinson's ``Rain Man.''
   But the festival, which opened Feb. 10, has coupled the Golden
Bear competition with a retrospective marking what would have been
the 100th birthday of German-American producer Erich Pommer, and a
showing of films made in 1939 that appear to have inspired European
filmmakers to take another look at those troubled times.
   As a tribute to Pommer, who fled Nazi Germany the year Adolf
Hitler took power and returned after the war to rebuild the nation's
film industry, the festival will screen 34 of the prolific
producer's works, including ``The Blue Angel'' starring Marlene
Dietrich, and several films directed by his lifelong associate Fritz
Lang. Pommer died in Los Angeles in 1966.
   The wartime thread running through the festival is enhanced by
the memorial series ``Europa 1939,'' which resurrects 50 films
produced that year in 10 European nations, giving audiences a full
taste of the society, culture and politics of a continent on the
brink of disaster.
   An accompanying forum for young filmmakers likewise breathes in
the historical atmosphere of Europe a half century after Hitler's
march began. Max Ophuls' critically acclaimed documentary, ``Hotel
Terminus'' recounts the role of Lyon Gestapo chief Klaus Barbie.
American filmmakers have offered ``Lodz Ghetto,'' about the largest
Jewish ghetto set up by the Nazis, and ``Vienna Is Different,''
confronting Austrians' historical consciousness following the
exposure of Austrian President Kurt Waldheim's Nazi past.
   The 12-day festival combines the international competition for
the award for best new feature film with a number of other contests,
premieres, exhibits and markets to draw thousands of the film
industries most prominent directors, producers, cinema operators and
film buffs to Berlin.
   Among the dozens of films to be shown for the first time outside
their country of origin are Woody Allen's ``Another Woman,'' and the
first-ever joint film production by East Germany and West Germany,
``The Break,'' which follows the chaotic lives of a handful of
Berliners in 1946.
   While East Germany has failed to embrace the broader freedoms
``glasnost'' has brought to the arts in much of the Soviet bloc,
West German filmmakers and other artists are hoping ``The Break''
signals a new willingness among their socialist countrymen to work
together in cultural and entertainment fields.
   Twenty-two full-length feature films are entered in the main
competition, with U.S. filmmakers out front with four entries.
   In ``The Summer of Aviya,'' directed by Israel's Eli Cohen, a
young girl learns to cope with the mental instability of her mother,
a survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp.
   Japanese director Yoji Yamada conveys in ``Hope and Pain'' the
post-war resettling of some school children and their eventual
rebellion against the imposed American order.
   ``American Stories,'' from Chantal Akerman of Belgium, relates
tales told by those who fled war-torn Europe from their perspective
as immigrants in New York, and China's ``Evening Bell'' by director
Wu Ziniu recounts a last-ditch attempt by Japanese troops to escape
capture in the final days of World War II.
   Entries from the United States include ``Mississippi Burning,'' a
fictionalized account of the murder of three civil rights workers in
the 1960s; ``Talk Radio,'' Oliver Stone's story of a late-night talk
show host driven by ambition to exploit his lonely listeners; ``The
Accused,'' Jonathan Kaplan's account of a gang rape and its legal
aftermath; and ``Rain Man,'' about the relationship that evolves
between an autistic man and his self-seeking younger brother.
   Running throughout the festival will be 30 new full-length West
German films and 46 from other nations, as well as the European Film
Market offering more than 350 films for sale.
   Of the top 10 box-office successes in West German cinemas this
month, seven are American comedies or thrillers.
   The only West German film offered at the festival that has been
enjoying much popular success is ``Herbstmilch'' (``Autumn Milk''),
a sad but beautifully filmed true-life story of a young woman's
hardships in wartime Bavaria.

<HEAD>Recollections of Wartime Bavaria Stir Nostalgia for Simple Life</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The bittersweet recollections of a Bavarian farm
girl deprived of youth by her mother's early death and the hardships
imposed by World War II have for more than four years been stirring
a nostalgia for the simple life of bygone years.
   Anna Wimschneider's true-life story, ``Herbstmilch'' (``Autumn
Milk'') is a major motion picture in West Germany. As a subtitled
commercial offering during the 39th Berlin International Film
Festival, it will seek an audience worldwide.
   ``Herbstmilch'' was directed by Joseph Vilsmaier and released
last month by Senator Films in Munich. It will make its
international debut at the film festival.
   The movie, shot entirely on location in the scenic Bavarian
countryside around Wimschneider's village near Pfarrkirchen, adopts
the harsh and simple style of the 1984 best-selling novel in its
portrayal of life 50 years ago.
   Anna's naive bliss as the barefoot and carefree eldest daughter
among seven children in the southern German countryside comes to an
abrupt end when her 39-year-old mother dies after the birth of an
eighth child. Eight years old and grieving, Anna is forced to take
over the exhausting farm chores and child care that sent her mother
to an early grave.
   The young girl's father comes off in the film as a harsher man
than the author recalls him to have been, beating her for bad
cooking and for falling asleep at the sewing machine where late each
night she sews by lamplight to earn money to feed the family.
   She finds a short-lived happiness in the courtship of a local
farmer's son, Albert Wimschneider, and marries him at age 21. But
the brief respite from hunger and hard work is broken when Albert is
called off to the front and Anna must care for the farm and her
husband's family under the cruel eye of a hateful mother-in-law.
   Told entirely from the perspective of isolated villagers who see
Adolf Hitler's politics and the emergence of World War II from afar,
the film brushes only gently against the still-tender subject of the
hopes inspired among poor Germans that the Nazi regime would bring
glory and prosperity.
   Wimschneider casts herself and her family as devoted Catholics
skeptical of the Fuhrer, occasionally defying the social order by
refusing to give the ``Heil Hitler'' salute in town.
   The few scenes in the film on the Nazi administration of Bavaria
depict the local party chief as a self-indulgent villain and the
people of Pfarrkirchen as unquestioning but innocent followers.
   Vilsmaier also grew up near Pfarrkirchen, though a full
generation after Wimschneider.
   ``The director was from the same part of Lower Bavaria as Anna
Wimschneider, which no doubt made this project an important and
personal one for him,'' said Heinz Badewitz, who put together the
series of 30 new West German films being shown at the Berlin
festival. ``There is a new generation of filmmakers that wants to
examine history and its effects on the present.''
   The film and Wimschneider's book have drawn some criticism,
however, for the uncritical account of the Nazi influence and
Bavarians' willingness to be led into a war that shattered the
continent.
   The presentation that one reviewer described as ``dangerously
sympathetic'' is likely a large part of the film's attraction for
German viewers sometimes discomfited by the fever of retrospection
in this 50th anniversary year of the start of World War II.
   Vilsmaier, whose Czechoslovak wife, Dana Vavrova, plays the role
of Anna, focuses more on the lifestyle of wartime Bavaria than on
the political and psychological questions still troubling the nation
that propelled Hitler in the Holocaust and his destructive march
through Europe.
   The film and the book both close with a comment by the
69-year-old Wimschneider that sums up the nostalgia shared by many
West Germans who remember the harshness of the war years while
carefully avoiding recollection of the horrors:
   ``Now is the wish I have had since childhood fulfilled,'' she
says. ``When I want to sleep in, I can sleep as long as I want.''

<DATELINE>FRAMINGHAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When General Motors Corp. idles its
sprawling assembly plant here in August, one of the main engines
driving this New England town's economy will shift into neutral.
   About 1,200 employees already are on furlough, and 2,000 more
will be laid off. Framingham will lose its largest employer, which
last year paid $830,000 in local taxes, spent $19 million with local
suppliers and had a payroll of $59 million.
   Sharon McWey, a 28-year-old single mother who earned $13.18 an
hour at the plant, wonders who will pay the bills if she or her
5-year-old daughter gets sick.
   Leonard Milo, owner of a Framingham hardware store, worries he
may have to lay off some of his 11 employees. ``One thing affects
the next,'' he said. ``You can't keep everyone on when you're losing
a customer that did $100,000 worth of business.''
   GM says the troubled plant, which has gone through at least five
shutdowns since 1977, may one day reopen. But industry analysts
doubt it, and many workers no longer can tolerate the
on-again-off-again nature of the operation.
   The same painful uncertainty is felt in Leeds, Mo., Pontiac,
Mich., Norwood, Ohio, and other communities nationwide where the No.
1 automaker has been reducing production capacity for the first time
in its 80-year history.
   GM, which has suffered a steady erosion in its share of the U.S.
car market over the past several years, announced last April that it
would start closing plants in an effort to bring capacity into line
with sales.
   The reaction on Wall Street has been enthusiastic; GM's stock
rose $1.25 to $73.375 a share on the day of the announcement and has
since climbed to about $93.
   But the impact on Main Street has been severe.
   ``Talk to any shop owner, any pizza place, any package store in
this town,'' said Kenneth R. Mercer, a 34-year-old Framingham native
who worked at the GM plant for four years. ``It's not just the 3,000
jobs. It's a whole domino effect.''
   GM says the 40-year-old Framingham plant is one of four in North
America making Buick Centurys and Oldsmobile Cutlass Cieras, all of
which have been running at well below capacity. Eliminating
Framingham, GM says, will make the other three _ in Oklahoma City,
Ste. Therese, Quebec, and Ramos Aripze, Mexico _ more efficient.
   Framingham, meanwhile, is feeling recriminations.
   Some workers blame Local 422 of the United Auto Workers for
refusing to agree to work-rule changes that might have saved the
plant and their jobs. Some union activists accuse executives of
mismanaging the plant.
   If there is a consensus, though, it is that the plant's fate was
sealed on a single night two years ago _ June 17, 1986 _ when GM
asked for a zoning change to allow the 54-acre facility to expand
and build plastic-body mini-vans.
   Framingham, population 65,100, calls itself ``the largest town in
America,'' because it is the largest community still run by an
old-fashioned New England town meeting.
   With the Yankee independence that town meetings are known for,
residents peppered GM officials that June night with questions about
noxious emissions, storage of plastic resins and truck traffic.
   Jim Hanscom, Framingham's director of public works, remembers the
answers as incomplete and the GM officials as haughty.
   ``It appeared they thought they were above questions,'' he said.
   After a lengthy debate, GM fell three votes short, 69-39, of the
two-thirds majority needed for a zoning change.
   This month, the automaker began retooling its North Tarrytown,
N.Y., plant to make the plastic mini-vans originally slated for
Framingham. On Feb. 1, GM announced that the Framingham facility
would shut down indefinitely because ``it does not have any new
product to manufacture.''
   Some residents saw the announcement as spiteful. But the
president of the local Chamber of Commerce, Michelle L. Flaherty,
said the town has only itself to blame.
   ``What infuriates me is that this plant had a product two years
ago that would have ensured its continuation into the 1990s, and the
town turned it down,'' she said. ``That's something we have to face
up to.''
   In other moves to reduce manufacturing capacity last year, GM
laid off 4,000 workers at a Firebird-Camaro factory in Norwood,
Ohio; 2,500 at a stamping plant in Hamilton, Ohio; 2,350 at a Fiero
plant in Pontiac, Mich.; and 1,300 at a Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac
facility in Leeds, Mo.
   Even with those closings, GM still has excess capacity and
probably will have to shut at least two more plants to meet its
stated goal of using 100 percent of its U.S. car-making capacity by
1992, said Thomas O'Grady, an analyst with Integrated Automotive
Resources Inc. in Wayne, Pa.
   Framingham may be better off than some other affected
communities, because it has a diverse economic base that includes
computer manufacturing, stationery making and a 375-room hotel.
   In addition, the unemployment rate in Massachusetts, at 3.3
percent, is the lowest of any major industrial state. To help
workers exploit job opportunities in the Boston area, GM and the UAW
have opened a retraining center, and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has
announced a $250,000 state grant to help fund it.
   The Framingham plant reopened in May, after a November 1987
shutdown that put 3,700 out of work. When it reopened, more than
1,000 workers with 20 years or more of experience were among those
called back. Hopes began anew.
   ``Because there have been so many layoffs, the perception in
everyone's mind is that, `I'll get called back,''' said Arthur T.
Grniet, a 24-year veteran of the plant, after the latest layoff
announcement.
   But some workers, frustrated by the recurring layoffs and
startups that afflict the auto industry, are trying to ensure that
the coming shutdown is the last they have to endure.
   ``I know I'm going to make less money and everything,'' said
Julio Goncalves, 42, who was laid off and recalled four times in
nine years at the plant.
   ``But enough is enough. I've got to find another job and get on
with my life. ... Even if they reopen again, I don't think if I'm
going to come back.''

   Moslem guerrillas who have been
fighting the Afghan communist regime are deeply divided, with widely
differing visions of the kind of government and nation they want to
build.
   The seven main Afghan guerrilla groups and dozens of small or
splinter groups range from moderate traditionalists sympathetic to
the old Afghan monarchy to fundamentalist Islamic revolutionaries.
   But the main problem, most leaders say, is who will come to power
after the expected fall of the communist regime now that the Soviet
Union has pulled its forces out of Afghanistan.
   ``There is much hope, but there is also much doubt about the
future of Afghanistan,'' said Masoud Khalili, a senior guerrilla, in
one of a series of interviews with The Associated Press.
   ``The Russian invasion was the greatest challenge in Afghan
history,'' said Abdul Hadi Arghandewhal, another guerrilla official.
``Now there is an equal challenge to rebuild Afghanistan,''
   Rival guerrilla groups have clashed in the past and show no sign
of mending their divisions despite an outward show of unity.
   Several guerrilla groups reportedly have been stockpiling weapons
for years for use in any internal struggle for power.
   The guerrillas say they agree on forming a democratic Islamic
government under an elected head of state and legislature. Beyond
that broad outline, they are vague.
   ``We want to make everyone a part of the future, but not everyone
can be a (government) minister,'' said Abdul Haq, a guerrilla
military commander.
   Many Afghans dismiss suggestions that they will wind up with a
radical Islamic state comparable to the one Shiite Moslems created
in neighboring Iran. Most Afghans belong to the rival Sunni sect.
   But moderate Afghans fear the future may hold little toleration
for different or modern ideas if some of the more radical guerrilla
organizations control any future government.
   ``Afghans are Moslems, but most do not want to live under a
government that tells them how to live or how religious they must
be,'' said one Afghan exile.
   Any struggle for power will be complicated by Afghanistan's
historic disunity and instability. The nation is deeply divided
between ethnic, tribal, linguistic and religious groups that have
competed for power for centuries.
   Past Afghan governments exerted little real control outside the
cities and large towns. A major task in rebuilding Afghanistan now
will be finding ways to ease the divisions and promote a common
sense of nationalism or face chronic feuding, guerrilla leaders say.
   ``This is a major problem that the war has made worse. We must
solve it, but we cannot do it with slogans,'' said Abdul Rahim, a
guerrilla official.
   A prolonged struggle for power could erupt between the rival
guerrilla parties, the many different ethnic and regional groups and
the semi-autonomous guerrilla military commanders who actually
control many parts of Afghanistan, according to some analysts.
   ``Civil war is possible if the leaders do not come up with a
solution to Afghanistan's problems,'' Haq said.
   Afghanistan could be divided into small, warring states under
rival guerrilla commanders in the same way Lebanon was broken up
among rival power groups, analysts say. Any central government in
Kabul, the capital, would be as ineffective and divided as the
Lebanese government, they said.
   ``I hope Afghanistan will become like Japan after the war, not
like Lebanon,'' Haq said.
   The thousands of guerrillas from rival groups must be disarmed to
ensure the restoration of stability and allow construction of an
effective civilian government, Afghan analysts say.
   But they add that it will be hard to persuade guerrillas who have
fought for years to surrender their weapons and power, especially
when there will be few jobs or other rewards in the desperately poor
nation.
   ``We must succeed with the pen as we succeeded with the gun,''
Haq said. ``The mujahedeen (Islamic holy warriors) must go school,
the people must go back to farming. It will not be easy.''
   Other guerrilla officials say Afghans are exhausted from a decade
of war and would turn against any of the guerrilla groups that start
a struggle for power. But only the main guerrilla groups, they
acknowledge, have military power.
   The threat of chaos and disunity will increase if Afghanistan's
neighbors and the superpowers compete for influence in the country,
guerrilla officials and analysts say.
   Pakistan and the United States, which armed and backed the
guerrillas, hope a new government will be friendly to them. At the
same time, the Soviet Union is likely to be troubled by a government
unfriendly to it. Iran also wants a voice in the future of
Afghanistan to counter U.S. and Pakistani influence in the strategic
nation.
   Iranian-supported Afghan Shiite guerrillas also are also expected
to seek a strong voice in a future Islamic government despite
opposition from Sunni guerrilla groups, who are in the majority.
   ``We must remember that we are all Afghans. Only that way can we
solve our problems,'' said Khalili.

   In a courtyard outside a modest
physical therapy ward, 8-year-old Mohammad Nazir practices hairpin
turns at top speed in his new wheelchair. Six months ago, doctors
amputated his legs above the knees after he was wounded in fighting
in Afghanistan.
   ``He's one of the lucky ones,'' said Wolfgang Mertens, who works
for a West German foundation that helps young victims of war.
   ``After more surgery, Mohammad will someday be able to walk again
with the help of artificial legs. Many of the other children have
serious bone infections. Many will lose more limbs.''
   Nazir is among 46 Afghan children who have been flown to West
Germany within the past month for treatment with the help of
Friedensdorf International, a group that has been helping children
wounded in wars for more than 20 years.
   Thirty-one badly injured Afghan children arrived in West Germany
on Feb. 2 after a two-day ordeal that Friedensdorf's director,
Ronald Gegenfurtner, described as ``one of the most difficult we
have ever made.''
   The children and their four guardians arrived at Frankfurt
Airport on an airline passenger jet by way of India, Kuwait and
Switzerland.
   ``It was the only way to get them out,'' said Gegenfurtner,
referring to the necessity of booking seats on a jetliner ill-suited
to accommodate wounded children.
   There was no space for stretchers and the children could lie only
as flat as the seatbacks would allow, Gegenfurtner said.
   ``These children have suffered terribly and there are thousands
more just like them in Afghanistan in desperate need of help,''
Gegenfurtner said at his office at Friedensdorf, or Peace Village,
on the outskirts of Oberhausen.
   Gegenfurtner said that among the children was a 14-year-old girl
whose leg was shattered by shrapnel during a rocket attack.
   ``She had already lost one leg and the wounded leg developed a
serious infection,'' Gegenfurtner said. ``We hope we can save the
leg because otherwise she'll end up a beggar on a Kabul street.''
   Gegenfurtner had high praise for the doctors in Afghanistan, but
said they were working under impossible conditions.
   ``The doctors there are working around the clock. But they can't
create antibiotics by magic.''
   He said crates of antibiotics are stacked up and idle at border
staging points, unable to be delivered because of the fighting and
bureaucratic delays.
   The Afghan children were taken to hospitals across West Germany
immediately after their arrival. Their treatment is paid for by
donations. Many doctors perform surgery without charge, Gegenfurtner
said.
   After they are released from the hospital, the children
convalesce at Peace Village, a cluster of cottages and
rehabilitation facilities on a quiet, green hill outside industrial
Oberhausen.
   Friedensdorf was founded in 1967 and immediately began helping
children wounded in the Vietnam War.
   Gegenfurtner said the village continues to help Vietnamese
children, whom doctors say are suffering from the effects of the
dioxin-laced defoliant Agent Orange.
   The foundation also has helped children from Lebanon, Nicaragua,
Guatamala, Pakistan and several African nations.

   The Aviation Trust Fund's surplus has grown to $6 billion, a
reserve that its critics complain has helped the Reagan
administration hide some of the federal deficit. If the trust fund
were handled that way by a private trustee, complained Kelleher of
Southwest, ``he would have been indicted for misappropriation of
funds.''
   An effort to separate the aviation fund from the overall federal
budget failed last year, but the airlines have vowed to try again in
the new Congress.
   But the airlines are not free of fault either, according to their
critics.
   Most of the capacity problems that exist today _ as well as many
of the problems envisioned for the years to come _ stem largely from
the strategies the airlines have devised under deregulation.
   Their concentration of flights at ``hub'' airports has caused
massive peaking of traffic in and out of cities such as Chicago,
Denver, Atlanta and Dallas-Fort Worth. Since 70 percent or more of
the passengers in many cases are only passing through these
airports, layover time is minimized and a large number of planes
must land and depart in a short time.
   On the other hand, airports at smaller cities often beg for more
business.
   ``We don't have a lack of airport capacity. We have a lack of
airport capacity the way we use it today,'' argues Charles Barclay,
executive director of the American Association of Airport
Executives, a trade group representing airport managers.
   Barclay maintains that many airports in mid-sized cities are
underused and are often ignored as possible hubs. Officials in
Columbus, Ohio, have offered $30 million over 10 years to any major
airline that would start a hub there, but there have been no takers,
he says.
   The airlines argue that they need significant local traffic to
make a major hub successful.
   As traffic increases, Barclay predicts, pressure will mount for
carriers to seek out the smaller cities as well.
   The airlines also have been criticized for not following up on
their own rhetoric on the construction of new airports. They cite
the example of the proposed Denver airport.
   Planners foresee no fewer than 12 runways, although half that
many would be built initially for the scheduled opening in the
mid-1990s.
   But both United Airlines and Continental Airlines, who are the
major carriers at Denver, have balked, arguing the plan is too
grand, too expensive and unneeded at this time, especially in light
of the region's economic downturn.
   Airports are largely financed through the issuance of bonds,
which are paid off from fees assessed to the airlines. Continental
claims the new Denver airport would add $36 to the price of a
ticket, compared to the $4 surcharge at the current Stapleton
International Airport.
   Mayor Frederico Pena, who has staked his political career on
getting the airport built, makes no secret of his anger toward the
airlines.
   ``Either we have a crisis in air transportation in this country
or we don't,'' he said.
   The irony of the airlines' position in Denver has not been lost
on Washington bureaucrats.
   Jim Burnley, transportation secretary under Ronald Reagan, called
the airlines' stand in Denver as well as the industry's lukewarm
attitude toward developing a third major airport in the Chicago area
``irresponsible and hypocritical'' at a time when the industry talks
of a capacity crisis.
   ``It's time those who come to conferences in Washington and sound
off about the perceived shortcomings of the federal government in
this area to get their own houses in order if they want to see
capacity of the system grow in the years to come,'' Burnley said in
an interview.
   Spokesmen for both Continental and United insist the two airlines
continue to favor construction of a new Denver airport, but the
question is one of cost.
   ``We'd like to build one that we can afford and we'd like to
build it in the time frame that we need,'' Martin Shugrue, president
of Continental, said in an interview.
   Airline reluctance to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into a
new airport may be understandable, suggest industry analysts, in
light of other costs facing the air carriers. As of last October,
the scheduled air carriers had orders and options for 1,301 new
aircraft worth $59 billion and the airlines are still ordering new
jetliners, according to Airline Economics Inc.
   And there are competitive questions that come into play at an
airport such as Denver, where United and Continental dominate, or
Chicago, where American and United are supreme.
   ``If you own the hub,'' says FAA Administrator Allan McArtor,
``you're not too interested in adding capacity so somebody can come
in and share your nest. That's just a fact of life.''
   That may be one reason why the industry has yet to develop a
master plan as to where any new airports should be built. Gabe
Philips, executive vice president of the Air Transport Association,
the airline trade group, says such a master plan ``would be
difficult to get agreement on'' because of the costs involved.
   Nevertheless, insist the airlines, the greatest barrier to the
construction of new runways and airports is not the industry, but
local opposition _ or the ``NIMBY folks'' as they have been called.
   The ``not in my back yard'' philosophy is not likely to go away
soon, says Henry Duffy, president of the 40,000-member Air Line
Pilots Association.
   And if new airports and runways are not built, Duffy predicts the
government will have no choice but to restrict traffic where there
isn't enough capacity.
   ``We'll have de facto re-regulation whether we call it
re-regulation or not,'' Duffy says.
   The answer, in the view of many industry executives, is for the
federal government to become more aggressive in pushing for new
airports or airport expansion where the lack of capacity is seen as
impeding commerce.
   Burnley calls suggestions that a new runway or airport might be
forced on a community as ``hopelessly naive'' and adds:
   ``You're simply not going to be able to politically run roughshod
over the rights of neighbors of airports. The Congress would not let
us do that.''

   The chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board
said he expects many banks to acquire thrifts under the government's
savings industry rescue plan, but he doesn't believe the program
signals the death of the industry.
   M. Danny Wall also told a meeting of international bankers
Wednesday that the government actively would seek restitution from
fraudulent thrift barons, whose actions have contributed to the
industry's losses, said to be accruing at $500 million a month.
   He said the $90 billion bailout plan announced this week by
President Bush does not signal the demise of a financial institution
created in the 1930s to help Americans buy single-family homes.

   President Bush is proposing to rescue the
savings and loan industry with a 30-year, $200 billion financing
plan that would ease the pain in his administration and shift the
cost to the future.
   In fact, Bush, despite proposing the biggest government bailout
ever, will achieve an immediate $200 million savings in the 1990
budget he submits to Congress on Thursday, making it easier to keep
his ``no new taxes'' pledge in his first budget.
   Bush would spend only $1.9 billion in tax dollars in 1990,
compared with $2.1 billion proposed by the outgoing Reagan
administration. Reagan called for outlays of $18.5 billion in fiscal
years 1990 through 1993, $3.1 billion more than Bush would spend in
his first four budgets.

   The arctic cold wave that blew through
California this week sent shivers through the state's
multimillion-dollar floral and citrus industries, ruining part of
the lemon crop and possibly boosting the price of a Valentine
bouquet.
   As the weather moderated in the state's major growing regions

   The brother of takeover strategist Asher Edelman
and another businessman were indicted for an alleged
multibillion-dollar phony tax shelter scheme that netted $511
million in improper tax writeoffs for unwitting investors.
   Asher Edelman was not charged with any wrongdoing or implicated
at all in the alleged scheme charged Wednesday against his brother,
Jon.
   The two defendants, Bernhard F. Manko, 48, of Lighthouse Point,
Fla., and Jon J. Edelman, 43, of Rye, N.Y., were accused of creating
more than $38 billion in ``pre-arranged, rigged and fraudulent''
transactions in government securities to generate tax losses for
investors in numerous limited partnerships.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission has
proposed new rules that would crack down on stockbrokers who use
high-pressure telephone tactics to sell penny stocks.
   The stocks can be thinly traded and it is often difficult for an
investor to accurately judge their value. Brokers sometimes take
extra-large commissions on penny stock sales.
   The SEC rule, proposed Wednesday, would not entirely ban
unsolicited ``cold calls.'' However, it would require brokerage
firms to sign a written agreement with a new customer before
completing a transaction.

20 times more negative film than the finished product requires,
which means an average movie might use 180,000 to 240,000 feet of

<HEAD>USW Wants Early Negotiations With Steel Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Steelworkers officials say they will ask
four major steelmakers for an early start to contract negotiations
and will demand a share of the industry's renewed profits when the
talks begin.
   ``Our people have made great sacrifices for a great many years.
We might as well get at it,'' USW President Lynn Williams said
Wednesday.
   Contracts covering about 43,700 union members are due to expire
July 31 at Bethlehem Steel Corp., Inland Steel Industries Inc.,
Armco Inc. and National Steel Corp., the third- through
sixth-largest producers respectively.
   ``We're prepared to meet on a schedule that's mutually
satisfactory,'' said Bethlehem spokesman Henry Von Spreckelsen.
   The union has agreed to two consecutive rounds of contract
concessions since 1983.
   ``Our members are working in 1989 for 1982 wage rates at best,''
the USW said in a 36-page statement approved by a 400-member
strategy committee.
   The USW will negotiate separately but concurrently with the
companies. The talks will cover 20,500 workers at Bethlehem, 11,600
at Inland, 7,000 at National and 4,700 at Armco. The USW represents
only a portion of the workers at Armco.
   The contract with the largest producer, USX Corp., runs to early
1991. Second-ranked LTV Corp. and Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp.
both are in Chapter 11 reorganization and will negotiate when they
emerge from bankruptcy court.
   ``Our union's fundamental goal is ... to raise the standard of
living for our members in every possible way by negotiating improved
income, cost-of-living protection, better benefits and working
conditions and more secure employment,'' the committee statement
said.
   After losing $12 billion from 1982-86, the U.S. steel industry
made profits of more than $3 billion in 1987-88 and is expecting
another good year in 1989.
   ``Our members have made an enormous contribution to the success
of the industry,'' Williams said. ``The success they've had should
be justly and fairly shared with our members.''
   He said union negotiators will emphasize a basic wage increase
over profit sharing.
   ``They're entitled to have some guaranteed improvement'' in pay,
Williams said.
   The union also wants restrictions on mandatory overtime and the
hiring of non-union contractors.
   Williams said all the companies are requiring excessive overtime
rather than hiring additional employees, which increases pension and
benefit expenses.
   ``We think that's wrong,'' he said.
   The companies' claim that overtime is necessary because skilled
workers are not readily available is ``a reflection of the failure
of the industry to maintain its training and apprentice programs,''
Williams said.
   For similar reasons, non-union contractors are used to maintain
equipment and clean plants, he said.
   USW attorneys said they've found cases where companies have
contracted for janitorial services at $50 to $70 per hour and
maintenance services at $75 to $100 per hour when USW members could
have done the work for half as much or less.
   ``Some of these prices blow your mind,'' said chief Counsel
Bernie Kleiman.
   According to Bureau of Labor Statistics figures released by the
union, from December 1982 to October 1988 the average hourly
earnings of steelworkers, including overtime earnings, rose 2.5
percent, from $14.40 to $14.76, while those of coal miners rose 20.8
percent, from $13.20 to $15.95, oil refinery workers rose 22.2
percent, from $13.49 to $16.49, and auto workers rose 24 percent,
from $12.98 to $16.09.

<HEAD>Bank Board Chairman Supports Bank Takeovers Of Thrifts In Rescue
Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The multibillion-dollar savings and loan crisis
doesn't mean the death of the industry, but more banks may assume
the role of thrifts, the chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board says.
   ``You have to understand in this country we have had a very high
commitment to home ownership,'' a goal aided by savings and loans,
M. Danny Wall told a meeting of international bankers Wednesday.
   Wall also said the government actively would seek restitution
from fraudulent thrift executives, whose actions have contributed to
the industry's losses, said to be accruing at the rate of $500
million a month.
   He said the $90 billion bailout plan announced this week by
President Bush does not signal the demise of a financial institution
created in the 1930s to help Americans buy single-family homes.
   Wall, who is from South Dakota, said there were ``thousands of
banks'' in that part of the country whose business was much the same
as thrifts, which traditionally have catered to individual
depositors or mortgage seekers.
   ``Over time, I'm convinced we should allow those kinds of
institutions to borrow from federal home loan banks,'' he said.
   Wall said the plan for dealing with the hundreds of troubled
thrifts includes a reversal of a Federal Reserve ban on allowing
bank holding companies to own thrifts.
   Under the plan, which must be approved by Congress, banks would
be allowed to absorb insolvent thrifts immediately and acquire
healthy institutions beginning in 1991.
   ``We are overruling the Fed, legally,'' Wall said, adding that he
expected banks to enter the thrift industry as soon as they are
allowed to.
   Wall told a meeting of the Institute of International Bankers
that the expected infusion of investment money from banks would
invigorate and perhaps save the thrift industry.
   One of the possible results of the plan is the eventual merger of
the banking and savings and loan industries. Savings institutions
have lower capital requirements than banks, a practice that would be
modified under the government plan.
   Wall said he supported Bush's proposals, which include abolishing
the three-member Federal Home Loan Bank Board that regulates the
nation's 3,100 thrifts. The bank board's regulatory apparatus would
be placed under the supervision of the Treasury Department.
   The plan also would place the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., which insures thrift deposits, under authority of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures deposits at
commercial banks and regulates the 8,000 state-chartered banks.
   Wall also pledged to crack down on thrift institution fraud, and
cited a $50 million infusion of money under the Bush plan to beef up
federal prosecution of such crimes.
   He said the bank board, which does not have the power to
prosecute cases, last year obtained $100 million in settlements,
excluding a $50 million malpractice settlement with a Philadelphia
law firm involved in the failure of a Florida thrift that has yet to
be paid.

<HEAD>Philippines Opposes Mediation Of Nuclear Plant Suit Against Westinghouse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HELEN J. SIMON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philippines President Corazon Aquino says
Westinghouse Electric Corp. wants to cover up alleged bribes to her
predecessor by using an international body to secretly settle a
lawsuit over a $2.3 billion nuclear plant.
   ``Defendants ... don't want a public accounting in their own
country,'' Mrs. Aquino said Wednesday in a statement issued through
the Philippines embassy in Washington. ``They would rather have a
secret arbitration in Switzerland where evidence of their action
would be kept secret.''
   The Philippines filed court papers Wednesday in U.S. District
Court here opposing arbitration.
   In December, the Aquino government sued Westinghouse, a
subsidiary and plant designer Burns and Roe Enterprises Inc., an
Oradell-based engineering firm.
   The government says the contract for the nuclear power plant
should be canceled because of allegations that bribes were paid to
former President Ferdinand Marcos. Other allegations include
substandard work and construction of the plant, located on the
Bataan Peninsula about 60 miles west of Manila, near an earthquake
fault.
   Westinghouse says the lawsuit is politically motivated and that
independent analysts have verified the safety of the 620-megawatt
plant, which was completed in the final months of the Marcos
administration in 1985 but never put into operation.
   In mid-December, it filed a motion asking U.S. District Court
Judge Dickinson Debevoise to stay the lawsuit pending arbitration by
the International Chamber of Commerce in Geneva, Switzerland.
   In its 70-page memorandum, the Phillipines says a contract clause
calling for an arbritrator to resolve differences between the plant
builders and the Philippines is invalid because the state-run
National Power Corporation was forced to sign the agreement although
it opposed it.
   ``Rather than competing for the project on the merits, the
defendants conspired together to pay multimillion dollar bribes for
the benefit of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos to assure they
were awarded the contracts for work on the project,'' the memorandum
says.
   The payments were allegedly arranged through Herminio Disini, who
was married to the first cousin of Marcos' wife, Imelda, and wired
to secret Swiss bank accounts, it said.
   ``We deal here with a criminal scheme of bribery, graft and fraud
carried out by the defendants at the highest level of the Philippine
government,'' the document says. ``It is this criminal scheme that
invalidates the arbitration clauses upon which the defendants base
their motions.''
   Westinghouse officials, who said they only briefly reviewed the
new documents, said they contained no new information.
   ``They are trying to avoid arbitration ... by saying there was
some type of fraud,'' Westinghouse attorney Louis J. Briskman said.
``There is no evidence showing fraud by Westinghouse.''
   The memorandum was accompanied by four volumes of evidence
documenting the government's claims.
   Although the volumes were not immediately available, a statement
from Philippine Justice Secretary Sedfrey Ordonez said they included
over a dozen sworn statements from top Marcos officials opposing the
construction of the plant, including the head of the power
corporation.
   Also included are statements from a former Burns and Roe
executive and Westinghouse sales representative who allegedly
participated in the scheme, and documents seized in Hawaii after
Marcos fled the Philippines, Ordonez said.
   ``The Hawaii documents prove that President Marcos' favoring of
Westinghouse at the expense of the government and NPC was not
disinterested, but was done by Marcos to protect his financial stake
in the transaction,'' Ordonez said.
   Marcos has since been indicted on unrelated federal racketeering
charges in the United States but has not appeared before the court
due to illness.
   Westinghouse plans to file a response in March, continuing to
push for arbitration, and the judge is expected to make his ruling
sometime after that, Briskman said.

<HEAD>Audi Loses In Car-Owner's Appeal Of Product Liability Case Involving

   A product-liability judgment that requires
Volkswagen of America Inc. to pay $100,000 in damages for
acceleration problems with its Audi 5000 is another public relations
setback for the automaker, an analyst says.
   A three-judge panel of the Appellate Division of Superior Court
on Wednesday reinstated a lower court jury verdict that awarded
punitive damages to Germaine Gibbs, of Elizabeth. She was injured
along with her three children when an Audi 5000 smashed through
their apartment in 1983.
   The car's driver, Harold Horowitz of Elizabeth, told police the
automobile lunged forward suddenly. Ms. Gibbs' attorney, James Hely,
said the ruling demonstrates Audi's liability for a design defect.
   Auto industry analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
said the ruling only adds to public relations problems for Audi,
which has been dealt poor sales reports because of an unintended
acceleration case it eventually won.
   ``The monthly sales numbers for Audis have been dismal since all
of the publicity around the unintended acceleration arose last
year,'' Healy said.
   He said Audi's U.S. sales were 60,000 cars in 1986, 41,000 cars
in 1987 and 23,000 cars in 1988.
   Ms. Gibbs' attorney shared Healy's belief that the ruling was
poor for public relations.
   ``Because the truth comes out in this opinion about how they
covered up and how they made a correction that was obvious they had
to make, it really reflects terribly on the company and how they
handled this matter,'' Hely said.
   Hely had contended in lower court arguments that Audi knew the
accelerator and brake pedals were put too close together and
sometimes caused drivers to step on both simultaneously, prompting
the car to lunge forward.
   A civil jury last March decided Volkswagen was responsible for
the design problem, awarding Ms. Gibbs $100,000 in punitive damages
and $14,000 in compensatory damages.
   But Superior Court Judge A. Donald McKenzie sided with company
attorneys and set aside the higher award, finding there was no proof
Volkswagen knew the car had problems and failed to correct them.
   The appeals court's 16-page decision reverses McKenzie.
   In January, Ms. Gibbs asked the appeals court to reinstate the
punitive award, while Volkswagen simultaneously asked the appeals
court to also set aside the $14,000 award.
   The company said the appeals court opinion is directed only at
the lower court judge's discretionary powers.
   ``The appellate court apparently based its decision on the
feeling that the judge in the lower court had abused his discretion.
We disagree with that,'' said John Bennett, a spokesman for
Volkswagen in Troy, Mich.
   ``We feel the judge acted within his discretionary rights and we
are looking very carefully to see what additional remedies we might
have,'' he said.
   Volkswagen told the National Highway Traffic and Safety
Administration in 1983 that it would take corrective measures to
``prevent inadvertent activation of brake and gas pedals at the same
time,'' according to court papers Hely filed in arguing the case
last month.
   Internal Volkswagen documents and a government report conclude
the car would lunge when the accelerator and brake pedal were
pressed simultaneously, and the pedals were arranged close enough
that the accelerator often is applied when the driver tries to
brake, Hely said.
   The documents show Volkswagen knew as early as 1979 of the defect.
   Volkswagen declined to comment about the internal documents filed
by Hely, saying they were not properly introduced because they were
not authenticated.
   Volkswagen attorney Chuck Dolan said McKenzie improperly allowed
introduction of the documents, even though it was Dolan who provided
them to the court.
   Bennett said the company's options include trying to obtain
another appeals court hearing.
   Hely said he expected the appeals court decision to stand, and
that the Supreme Court would not grant a motion for the justices to
hear the case.
   Bennett stressed that the case did not involve unintended
acceleration, which involves the car lunging forward uncontrollably
when it is placed in gear.

<HEAD>Sources: Chicago Board Of Trade Won't Ban Dual Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade, in an effort to
restore confidence in its ability to regulate itself, is considering
a number of changes in trading procedures, sources said.
   But the BOT, the world's largest commodities exchange, does not
intend to stop brokers from making transactions for customers as
well as their own account, according to the sources.
   Chairman Karsten Mahlmann said BOT directors are reviewing other
trading practices and have voted to spend $1 million to improve the
computerized trade-monitoring system, according to people who
attended his private, one-hour meeting with members Wednesday.
   Mahlmann also announced during the meeting that the exchange's
directors have voted to increase the maximum fine for offenses to
$250,000 from $75,000, the sources told The Associated Press.
   BOT officials have scheduled another membership meeting today, at
which they are expected to announce plans to develop a computerized
system for after-hours trading.
   The practice of traders making transactions for customers and
dealing for themselves is a controversial one known as dual trading.
   The BOT directors' unanimous endorsement of dual trading was seen
by some as a sign the exchange will not bend to criticism at a time
when the futures industry is under intense scrutiny by the FBI and
U.S. prosecutors.
   The government has launched a massive investigation into
suspected fraud at the BOT and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and
dual trading is one of the practices under examination.
   The undercover probe, which was disclosed Jan. 19, is tied to
allegations that as many as 100 traders and brokers at Chicago's
futures exchanges cheated customers out of millions of dollars in
executing their orders to buy and sell contracts for future
deliveries of commodities, ranging from soybeans to foreign
currencies.
   Critics contend that dual trading creates opportunities for
unscrupulous traders to cheat customers. But supporters of the
practice say it provides a financial incentive for independent
traders to work in the exchange's pits, thereby increasing the
efficiency of the futures markets.
   ``I believe in dual trading,'' said one exchange member who spoke
only on condition of anonymity. ``I believe it should happen and
should continue to happen.''
   Commodities exchanges are overseen by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, a federal agency, but the creation and
enforcement of many trading rules is left up to the individual
exchanges _ a policy that is favored by BOT leaders.
   BOT officials would not comment publicly on Wednesday's meeting.
But one exchange source said privately that some of the exchange's
largest users, including agricultural concerns and pension-fund
managers, had lobbied in favor of retaining dual trading.
   Mahlmann said other trade practices _ including curb trading, in
which traders execute a few buy or sell orders after the closing
bell _ are under review, sources said.
   They said Mahlmann told members that the exchange's computerized
trade-monitoring system, which creates a minute-by-minute record of
trades, was about 95 percent accurate.
   Mahlmann said that with scheduled improvements, the system should
be able to reconstruct trades with 100 percent accuracy, the sources
said.

<HEAD>EPA Sues Kaiser For Alleged Pollution Violations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES L. ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency has
sued Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. for allegedly violating
pollution standards at its Trentwood plant east of Spokane.
   If found liable, the company could be subject to civil penalties
of as much as $25,000 per day of violations for each of eight
emission points, EPA's regional office in Seattle said in a news
release.
   A Kaiser spokeswoman, Susan Ashe, called the complaint, filed in
U.S. District Court in Spokane, ``totally inappropriate, completely
unnecessary and most regrettable.''
   According to the civil suit announced Wednesday, the federal
government seeks a permanent injunction against Kaiser prohibiting
violations of visible emissions standards caused by releases of
particulate matter.
   Also sought is an order directing the Trentwood plant to comply
immediately with clean air regulations developed by the Washington
Department of Ecology and approved by EPA, said EPA regional
spokesman Bill Jacobson.
   The complaint accuses the Kaiser plant of exceeding emissions
standards for particulate matter ``on numerous occasions since
1984.''
   The Trentwood plant rolls and ships such products as beverage can
lids and heat-treated sheets, plates and coi formal notice, giving the
company 30
days to correct the problem, said Jacobson. The complaint alleges
that smoke stacks from the same plant furnaces continued to violate
federal and state standards after the 30-day grace period expired.
   Ms. Ashe, the Kaiser spokeswoman, said in a prepared statement
that the company has spent nearly $500,000 ``redocumenting that
particiulate matter within these occasional bursts of smoke from our
remelt area were well below every health standard by which one
measures.''
   Kaiser also announced last month that it would install $1.8
million in pollution-control equipment to reduce emissions from the
casting area.
   Since the regional EPA office was aware of these steps, Kaiser
was shocked when the civil suit was filed, Ms. Ashe said.
   In essence, the debate centers around the so-called ``opacity
standard'' developed by the state. Industries are restricted in the
amount of time that their smoke stacks can exceed 20 percent opacity
_ basically, seeing 80 percent of what one should be seeing.
   EPA uses that opacity standard as an indicator of how much
particulate matter is in the air. When an opacity standard is
violated, EPA assumes that the federal particulate air standard is
violated as well.
   Kaiser and others have argued that opacity standards do not truly
measure the health or environmental impact of material escaping from
stacks. EPA contends the opacity standard is the best available way
to measure particulate matter.
   Ms. Ashe said Kaiser has been working in good faith in the past
year with the county Air Pollution Control Authority, the state
Ecology Department and the regional EPA office on an equitable
solution to what it calls ``an arbitrary visual emissions standard
that has no relation to scientific fact or to health.''
   The aluminum company had also sought a local variance and a
change in state law to permit any industry or regulatory agency to
undertake studies that would lead to the establishment of a
scientifiically sound standard.
   ``We suspect that this regrettable decision (to sue) by the
Department of Justice was reached in Washington, D.C. without even
checking at the state and local level to find out how much progress
has been made,'' Ms. Ashe said. ``Someone far removed from the scene
appears to just want to chalk up a mark on the wall as an
enforcement undertaken.''
   Jacobson, however, said the civil action originated in EPA's
regional office in Seattle.
   ``It was our idea. We pushed it and there was concurrence from
headquarters,'' he said.
   Ms. Ashe said Kaiser would seek to meet with all the parties
involved in an attempt to settle the dispute. If that fails, the
company is prepared to vigorously contest the action in court, she
added.

   Italy's Olivetti Co., a leading information
technology company, will strengthen its presence in the American
market through its purchase of ISC Systems Corp, a bank automation
concern, company executives and analysts said.
   The Spokane company announced Wednesday it has agreed to be
acquired and subsequently merged with Bunker Ramo Corp. of Shelton,
Conn., a wholly owned subsidiary of Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co., of
Ivrea, Italy.
   The deal will create one of the leading computer systems
suppliers serving the financial services industry, analysts said.
   ``This acquisition reinforces our worldwide position in banking
automation,'' Vittorio Cassoni, Olivetti's managing director and
chief operating officer, said in a prepared statement. ``It greatly
expands our market share in North America, complementing our leading
role in Europe and Japan.''
   The merger transaction, valued at approximately $174 million,
calls for the purchase of all outstanding shares of ISC common stock
at $12.25 per share in cash.
   The combined companies, which will have headquarters in Spokane,
had revenues of approximately $250 million in 1988, of which ISC's
share was $175 million.
   The merger would give the new company the third-largest market
share among firms selling automated financial services systems,
behind IBM and NCR, said John Lindeblad, current president and chief
operating officer of ISC Systems, who will remain in that capacity
in the new company.
   About 25 percent of Olivetti's sales of more than $6 billion in
1988 were to the banking industry, but little of that was in the
United States, said Ted DeMerritt, ISC Systems chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Analysts who follow ISC Systems said the merger offers a good fit
of companies in both domestic and international markets.
   Daniel Nelson, an analyst with Ragen MacKenzie in Seattle, said
Olivetti could gain from ISC's presence in Asia, while ISC would get
a toehold in the European market dominated by Olivetti. The Spokane
company, which has a large share of the domestic savings and loan
market, also stands to benefit from its association with Bunker
Ramo's commercial banking ties, he said.
   ``There are probably some synergies involved,'' agreed Dain
Bosworth analyst William Whitlow in Seattle. ``They can take ISC
software and couple it with Bunker Ramo hardware and tie it all into
Olivetti mainframes. It's probably a better package and it gives
Olivetti a better product to market.''
   James D. Lindner, president and chief executive officer of Bunker
Ramo, will become chairman and CEO of the as-yet unnamed company.
DeMerritt will become vice chairman.
   ISC Systems is a leading supplier of Pinnacle branch automation
systems to savings and loans, credit unions, and commercial banks in
the U.S. It also markets its products in Latin America, the United
Kingdom, Asia and Canada.
   Bunker Ramo supplies branch automation systems, mostly to
commercial banks.
   ISC Systems announced Dec. 22 it would begin discussions with a
possible suitor. The announcement coincided with a restructuring
that could eliminate as many as 120 jobs at its Spokane operations,
where 750 people were employed as of Jan. 1.
   DeMerritt said the merger will mean the loss of some jobs and
reshuffling of others. The reorganization announced before the
merger will continue, he said.
   ISC Systems spokesman Wes Lynch said the restructuring, expected
to be completed by June, will result in a workforce of between
630-650 people.
   The acquisition and merger is pending approval by ISC
shareholders and federal regulatory agencies, DeMerritt said.
   ISC was founded in 1977 and its products serve more than 2,700
financial institutions, employing 1,700 worldwide.
   Bunker Ramo, which employs about 600 people in the U.S., was
purchased by the Olivetti Co. in 1986. Its systems are found in 750
financial institutions.

   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. says it is
temporarily halting savings and loan rescues until Congress comes up
with more money for the S&amp;L deposit insurance fund.
   In a statement Wednesday, the FDIC said it will halt all deals
until it is finished taking control of 224 insolvent institutions
over the next month under orders from President Bush. After that, it
will only deal with cases that can be supported by the cash of the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
   On Tuesday, FSLIC officials said perhaps three or four
liquidations would be completed this quarter, but rescue deals would
not go forward. The FDIC's Wednesday statement confirmed those
comments, made at a briefing for reporters.
   The FDIC typically insures deposits at commercial banks, but was
ordered Tuesday by the White House to oversee the ailing S&amp;Ls until
the government can decide whether to sell the institutions or close
them and pay off depositors.
   S&amp;L regulators rescued or propped up 223 institutions last year,
mostly by issuing promissory notes to investors buying failing
thrifts, and by pledging to cover future losses. The deals have been
criticized as more expensive to taxpayers in the long run.
   Now, no notes or loss guarantees will be considered. All
investors who had been negotiating to buy ailing savings and loans
from the FSLIC will have to deal with the FDIC, the announcement
said.
   In another development, the president of a quasi-public agency
created to sell loans and property from failed savings institutions
announced his resignation.
   Gerald P. Carmen, former head of the General Services
Administration and a political ally of former President Ronald
Reagan, resigned effective next month as head of the Federal Asset
Disposition Association.
   FADA, established in 1985, had been severely criticized for
conflicts of interest and mismanagement. In a statement, Carmen said
he had turned the agency around in his year at the helm.
   The agency currently manages about 2,500 assets worth $3.8
billion, spokesman Dave Bunton said. He said John Wills, currently
executive vice president, will serve as acting president.
   FADA's fate under Bush's S&amp;L reorganization plan is unclear, he
said.

<HEAD>U.S. Blocks EEC Quest For Probe Into Food Import Curbs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States blocked a demand Thursday by the
European Economic Community for an official probe into U.S. duties
on European food imports, imposed to retaliate for an EEC ban on
U.S. hormone-treated meat.
   The EEC, which charges that Washington's measures violate
international trade rules, made its bid at a regular two-day council
meeting of the 96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   GATT sets global trade rules and is a forum for resolving trade
disputes. It traditionally operates by consensus.
   EEC delegate Tran Van-Thinh urged a quick probe and warned of a
further deterioration in the latest transatlantic trade dispute, a
meeting source reported on condition of anonymity.
   Many delegations backed the EEC's criticism of the U.S. measures
in a council debate Wednesday.
   But at Thursday's session, U.S. envoy Michael Samuels rejected
the EEC request for an investigation by a panel of neutral GATT
experts, saying it was premature.
   Senior U.S. and EEC trade officials are scheduled to hold talks
on the issue in Washington next week. The discussions could become
more complicated if GATT were to begin an investiation, he said.
   Canada, Chile, Brazil and Nicaragua also supported the EEC call
for a panel.
   The EEC's import ban on hormone-treated meat went into effect
last Jan. 1, affecting U.S. sales of beef and veal valued at more
than $100 million. The EEC said meat treated with hormones could
pose a health risk, which Washington disputes.
   In response, Washington immediately slapped high duties on
imports of European food products including boneless beef, ham and
pork shoulders.
   EEC foreign ministers approved a plan Jan. 23 to impose
100-percent duties on imports of U.S. walnuts and dried fruit. But
the ministers delayed implementation to give more time for
negotiations and said they would review the situation Feb. 20 before
making a final decision on retaliation.
   Barring a quick settlement, the U.S.-EEC row is likely to
resurface at an emergency GATT Council meeting Feb. 21.
   GATT officials scheduled the session at the request of Brazil,
which wants to renew pressure for a ruling on whether 100-percent
U.S. tariffs on Brazilian drugs, paper products and consumer
electronics violate trade rules.
   Washington imposed the sanctions last year because it said
Brazilian laws insufficiently protect foreign pharmaceutical patents.
   On Wednesday, some 50 countries backed Brazil, leaving the United
States isolated.
   But Samuels vetoed the Brazilians' second request for an
investigation, noting that the new U.S. administration is still
formulating its position on the case.

<HEAD>Oil Field Services Firm Reports Fourth-Quarter Earnings Plunge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Halliburton Co. said Thursday its earnings plunged
36 percent in the final quarter of 1988 due to the reorganization of
its logging and geophysical businesses.
   The oil field services firm reported net income of $11.8 million,
or 11 cents a share, on revenue of $639 million. That compares with
earnings of $34.1 million, or 32 cents a share, on $456 million in
revenue in the same 1987 quarter.
   ``Lower worldwide drilling activity during the last three months
of 1988 put pressure on our oil field services group's
profitability,'' Halliburton President Thomas H. Cruikshank said.
   Cruikshank said about 335 fewer drilling rigs were active
worldwide during the fourth quarter of 1988 than a year earlier.
   ``We believe this weakness in oil field service markets will
continue during the first half of 1989,'' he said.
   Halliburton reorganized its logging and geophysical business
units in the fourth quarter by forming Halliburton Geophysical
Services Inc. and Halliburton Logging Services Inc.
   The company said the restructuring cost $27.2 million in the
quarter. Halliburton said it expects savings by reducing duplicate
efforts, cutting staff and realigning international operations.
   For the full year, Halliburton reported earnings of $93.6
million, or 89 cents a share, on revenue of $2.17 billion. That is
nearly double 1987 earnings of $48.1 million, or 45 cents a share,
on revenue of $1.55 billion.

<HEAD>Warner Posts 9.8 Percent Profit Increase in 4th Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warner Communications Inc. said Thursday its
fourth-quarter profit rose 9.8 percent, driven by best-ever
performances for the period by its filmed entertainment and its
cable and broadcasting divisions.
   Warner, which also reported strong gains by its recorded music
operations, said it earned $101.1 million, or 63 cents a share, for
the final three months of 1988, compared with $92 million, or 59
cents a share, in 1987.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose 17.6 percent to $1.20 billion from
$1.02 billion a year earlier.
   For the year, Warner earned a record $423.2 million, or $2.65 a
share, up from $328.1 million, or $2.09 a share, in 1987.
   Full-year revenue rose to $4.21 billion from $3.40 billion a year
earlier.
   The 1988 figures included an after-tax gain on investments of
$33.2 million while the 1987 results reflected a $39.6 million gain.
   Steven J. Ross, chairman and chief executive, said, ``The
worldwide demand for our entertainment products has never been
stronger and the outlook for our businesses in the future remains
bright.''
   He said the filmed entertainment division posted its best fourth
quarter ever, reflecting strong results from television syndication,
international theatrical film rentals and video sales. Its new film
releases during the quarter included ``Accidental Tourist,''
``Dangerous Liaisons'' and ``Tequila Sunrise.''
   Warner's cable and broadcasting business posted record operating
income for the quarter and the year, and music division results were
up 50 percent for the quarter and reached a record for the year.
   Warner acquired the money-losing programmer Lorimar Telepictures
in January, too late for inclusion in Warner's 1988 results.

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened nearly
unchanged today on the Chicago Board of Trade in light activity
ahead of this afternoon's grain supply-and-demand report from the
Agriculture Department.
   ``Boy, it's dead in here,'' said market analyst Walter Spilka of
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   There was no confirmation of Wednesday's rumors that the Soviet
Union had canceled some of its U.S. soybean purchases. Those rumors
had triggered a sharp decline in soybean futures prices on Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, the USDA said this morning that it had accepted a
Soviet bid for 600,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices. The business had been expected, so the confirmation had
little effect on prices.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 2 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.28\ a bushel; corn was \ cent
lower to } cent higher with March at $2.65\ a bushel; oats were {
cent lower to { cent higher with March at $2.09 a bushel; soybeans
were 1{ cents lower to 1\ cents higher with March at $7.46{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were sharply lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange following Wednesday's USDA cattle
inventory report, which showed the U.S. cattle herd to be about 2
million head larger than most analysts had expected.
   Most cattle futures prices plunged the permitted daily limit of
1.50 cents a pound at the opening and remained severely depressed
after about 1{ hours of trading.
   Live cattle were 1.40 cents to 1.50 cents lower with February at
73.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 1.50 cents lower across the
board with March at 82.92 cents a pound; live hogs were .45 cent to
1.22 cents lower with February at 42.15 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .55 cent to .97 cent lower with February at 37.75 cents
a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Inc. began the final
process of acquiring RJR Nabisco Inc. today upon the expiration of
its record $24.53 billion tender offer for the stock of the food and
tobacco giant.
   The New York investment banking concern said stockholders had
tendered more than 215.6 million RJR Nabisco shares, or about 96.8
percent of the Atlanta-based company's outstanding common stock.
   The exact number of shares tendered would be determined in a
count over the next few days, said Ruth Pachman, a spokeswoman for
Kohlberg Kravis.
   Under terms of the tender offer, Kohlberg Kravis will pay $109 a
share in cash for about 74 percent of RJR Nabisco's outstanding
common stock. In a second step after the acquisition is completed,
Kohlberg Kravis will issue preferred stock and converting debentures
for the remaining shares.
   Checks for the cash portion of the offer were expected to be
mailed later this month.
   On Wednesday, RJR Nabisco was dropped from two Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp. stock averages, reflecting its eventual transition from a
publicly held company into a private one.
   In addition, Tiger International Inc., a pending acquisition of
Federal Express Corp., was dropped from S&amp;P's composite index of 500
stocks, S&amp;P said.
   The companies were replaced after the close of New York Stock
Exchange trading by First Union Corp. and King World Productions on
the S&amp;P 500 Index. RJR was replaced on the S&amp;P 100 Index by MCI
Communications Corp.
   Ms. Pachman said RJR stock would continue to be traded on the
NYSE until the acquisition was completed. Tiger also continued to
trade on the NYSE.
   Kohlberg Kravis won a record bidding struggle for the nation's
19th largest industrial company on Nov. 30, making it the largest
takeover in history.

   United Technologies Corp. will no longer
allow reporters to attend the company's quarterly meetings with Wall
Street securities analysts.
   Franklin A. Parisi, the company's vice president for
communications, said United Technologies' executives want to give
analysts their undivided attention at a quarterly meeting Monday.
   The company scheduled a second meeting with reporters to be held
Tuesday afternoon.
   In the past, quarterly meetings have drawn 12 to 15 news
reporters and 100 to 125 analysts who are told about the company's
financial performance and about prospects for the future.
   Parisi said the decision to close meetings to reporters was
unrelated to an incident at the last analysts meeting in July. A
company executive told reporters in July that United Technologies
would not comply with a Pentagon directive requiring contractors
under investigation to certify that they had not obtained inside
information on weapons contracts. The statement was retracted the
next day.
   Offices of two company subsidiaries, Pratt &amp; Whitney and Norden
Systems, were searched in connection with a federal investigation of
defense industry fraud.

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Braniff Inc. will move its headquarters from
Dallas to Orlando beginning in May, Braniff Chairman William McGee
announced today.
   The headquarters move had been expected since the airline was
purchased by a Philadelphia and New York investment group last
summer, and speculation on the location had centered on Kansas City,
Mo., and Orlando, where Braniff has hubs.
   ``As a `new' airline, we have an opportunity to use our
headquarters location to make a statement about our desire to
participate in the growth of one of the fastest-developing regions
in the U.S.,'' McGee said.
   ``Although Kansas City is and will remain our largest hub, our
decision to locate our headquarters here signals our commitment to
the growth of Central Florida as well,'' McGee told a news
conference in Orlando.
   Braniff moved its principal hub operation from Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport to Kansas City last year.
   The relocation of Braniff headquarters to Orlando will involve
the transfer of about 125 professional and administrative personnel,
McGee said.
   Braniff has about 720 employees in the Orlando area, and McGee
said he expects employment there to grow by more than 425 jobs in
the coming year.
   The company earlier this month leased more than 26,000 square
feet in an abandoned terminal at the Orlando airport.
   BIA Acquisitions, an investor group formed by PaineWebber Inc.,
bought Braniff in June for about $100 million and became the
airline's third owner since its 1982 bankruptcy reorganization.
   The new owners immediately began an effort to rejoin the ranks of
the nation's largest carriers, and the airline recently announced
the purchase of 50 Airbus A300 planes, a $3.5 billion deal that
would nearly double Braniff's fleet.

   Federal authorities contend that the merger of Jackson Jordon
Inc. of Schaumberg, Ill., and Canron Inc. of Toronto would violate
antitrust laws.
   The companies are two of only three worldwide that produce
automatic tampers, which are used to align and level railroad tracks.
   The government also contends that documents filed by the
companies indicate either Jackson Jordon's plant in Ludington,
Mich., or the Canron plant in Columbia, S.C., would close if the
deal is allowed to go through.
   Also named as a defendant in the lawsuit is Ivaco Inc. of
Montreal, Canron's parent.
   Ivaco is the largest producer of tampers in the United States,
while Jackson Jordan is the third largest. The only other company
making the parts is Plasser &amp; Theurer Co. of Austria.

<HEAD>Consumer Debt Continues To Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It seems inevitable that if interest rates
continue to rise, as conceivably they could, many American consumers
will have their confidence factors squeezed.
   But nobody, including the chairman of the Federal Reserve, can be
sure.
   So far that confidence has been almost immune to actual,
potential and threatened events, including the great stock market
crash of l987, which created a shiver so tiny that it had dissipated
by Christmas.
   Since then, consumers have gone on their merry way, spending and
borrowing with confidence while professional economists regularly
talk about such things as inflation, recession, rising interest
rates and other ogres.
   None of these has daunted the great American consumer, suggesting
that it might take something of an economic earthquake to slow the
propensity to spend. In December, consumer debt rose $5.4 billion to
a total of $667.3 billion.
   That increase, 9.9 percent on an annual basis, wasn't a fluke. In
November, consumer credit rose at an 8.5 percent annual rate. In
October the rate was 7.2 percent. Borrowing for cars and retail
items rose. Credit card debt rose too.
   The increases are explained variously by analysts as a natural
byproduct of job security, rising personal income, faith in the new
administration, belief that prices are ``right,'' the absence of
runaway inflation and the like.
   All these and more are the ingredients of confidence, and that
confidence, at least superficially, seems ready to penetrate all
obstacles, including a 10-month effort by the Federal Reserve to
restrain economic growth.
   Will it, though? The test of that confidence is now, when higher
taxes and high interest rates combined might toss a wet towel of
reality at some borrowers.
   Credit-card interest rates, for example, already are high,
historically and in comparison to most other rates. Many issuers of
cards charge close to 20 percent. Some charge even more, not
counting annual fees.
   Should there be further increases, mainly from the Fed's
insistence that interest rates are an effective and necessary
restraint on the economy, levels will be reached that once were
considered intolerable.
   Making them worse still will be higher taxes. True, President
Bush seems determined to avoid any new taxes this year, but an old
one continues to add pressure. Whereas 40 percent of installment
debt was tax-deductible last year, only 20 percent will have that
status in 1989. Debt is increasingly costly.
   A psychological factor enters the picture: The realization of how
costly that debt will be might not be impressed upon people for
another year. That is, the true impact might not come until
borrowers complete their 1989 taxes.
   It is a seemingly deadly combination until you reflect that
nothing over the past year, including the Internal Revenue Service
and the Federal Reserve, has been able to penetrate the consumer's
armor and shake up that confidence.
   Early returns suggest strong spending will continue in 1989.
Aided by balmy weather, major retailers reported January sales gains
of 6 percent to 10 percent, and a large part of such sales
historically are on a credit basis.
   Meanwhile, automotive dealers are ready for a big spring selling
season, adding to the temptation to use even more credit. After that
comes the lure of vacations and the cost of wedding and graduation
gifts.
   Temptation is out there, and over the past year it has been
strong enough to defy restraint. It provokes the question of just
what will undermine consumer confidence if high taxes and interest
rates are unable to do the job.

<HEAD>FASB Proposes New Rules To Record Pension Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board today
announced a controversial proposal to change the way companies
account for pension benefits, a plan which could significantly
impact company profits.
   The proposed new rules, scheduled to take effect in 1992, would
require U.S. companies to deduct promised post-retirement medical
and insurance benefits as they are earned, or while an employee is
still working for the company.
   It would eliminate the ``pay-as-you-go'' accounting method
currently used by most companies. As such, companies in many cases
under the new rule would have to deduct from their income statements
the amount of the earned benefits, instead of simply deducting the
amount the companies actually paid in a given year.
   Critics of the proposal have complained that it would impact
financial results too greatly, as well as being difficult to manage.
   The new rules would deal only with financial reporting of benefit
obligations but does not address the funding of pension benefits,
FASB officials said.
   The plan comes at a time of soaring health care costs, longer
life expectancy and earlier retirements which are posing economic
problems for many companies, according to FASB Chairman Dennis R.
Beresford.
   Beresford said the proposal would make financial statements more
informative and complete and would enhance disclosure of promised
benefits.
   ``It will require companies to publicly acknowledge their
existing commitments to investors and other users of financial
statements who in turn can evaluate the implications of those
promises,'' Beresford said.
   He also said the proposed accounting would not change the nature
or extent of the current pension promises.
   ``The cost of providing the promised benefits is the same before
and after the proposed accounting is implemented,'' Beresford said.

<HEAD>Northwest Orders 10 Airbus A330 Jetliners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten Airbus A330 jetliners worth a total $860
million have been ordered for Northwest Airlines, which plans to use
the high-tech aircraft in the North Atlantic and on high-volume
domestic routes, NWA Inc. said Thursday.
   NWA, Northwest's parent, said the order was the largest to date
of the A330s, valued at $86 million each.
   The A330 is a two-pilot, two-engine aircraft seating 303
passengers in a configuration of three different fare classes.
   The first A330 will be delivered in July 1994 with the remaining
nine airplanes to enter the Northwest fleet by the end of 1994, NWA
said.
   ``We have a strong commitment to the Airbus A330,'' said Steven
G. Rothmeier, NWA's chairman and chief executive officer. ``The A330
is state-of-the-art technology with efficient Pratt &amp; Whitney
engines that provide superior operating economies with great
customer comfort and appeal.''
   The A330 will incorporate the technological advances that Airbus
has pioneered with the A320, including fly-by-wire flight control
and enhanced avionics, the company said.
   Northwest has ordered 100 of the smaller A320s for domestic use
and 20 of the larger A340s for international travel.
   Northwest also selected Pratt &amp; Whitney's PW4000 to power the new
A330s. The engine order is worth $250 million, Pratt &amp; Whitney said.

<HEAD>Maxwell Exercises Option to Buy Thomas Cook Travel USA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. said Thursday that a
company controlled by British publisher Robert Maxwell has agreed to
buy Thomas Cook Travel Inc. USA, one of the nation's biggest travel
agencies.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The sale is subject to
federal regulatory approval.
   Separately, Thomas Cook Group Ltd. of Britain said it had reached
a licensing agreement with Maxwell that permits him to continue
using the Thomas Cook name in connection with the travel agency.
   Maxwell obtained an option to buy the agency last fall when he
agreed to pay $750 million for Dun &amp; Bradstreet's airline guide
publishing business. That purchase was completed in December.
   He is making the travel agency buy through his Pergamon Group PLC.
   ``We are determined to grow the business both internally and
through an aggressive acquisition policy that will establish Thomas
Cook Travel Inc. as a dominant force in the U.S. travel business,''
Maxwell said in a statement.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the world's largest marketer of business
information and services, had acquired the U.S. agency from Thomas
Cook Group's parent, Midland Bank PLC, in March 1985.
   Maxwell said the agency is the fourth largest in the United
States, handling $365 million in airline reservations sales and
getting $45 million in commission revenues in 1987. It operates 60
full-service offices.
   As part of his licensing agreement with Thomas Cook Group,
Maxwell agreed to cooperate internationally with Thomas Cook Group
as part of a worldwide network providing travel services.
   Maxwell, who has extensive media interests in Europe, has been
expanding rapidly in the United States, buying the publishing giant
Macmillan Inc. for nearly $2.6 billion last year.

<HEAD>Conference Board: Expansion Will Continue But Growth To Slow</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For release 6:30 p.m. EST</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's economy will continue to expand in
1989 but growth will slow slightly, according to a report by a panel
of economists to be released Friday.
   The panel of 13 economists sponsored by the Conference Board
projected that real gross national product will rise about 2.5
percent this year, down from about 2.7 percent in 1988.
   The group also projected that inflation would rise to 5 percent
from 4.2 percent, the prime interest rate would hold steady at about
10.5 percent and unemployment would increase slightly to 5.5 percent.
   ``Under present circumstances, a slowdown this year should be
looked upon not as a signal of economic weakness but as a
necessity,'' said Edgar R. Fiedler, economic counselor at the
Conference Board, a worldwide organization of corporate executives.
   ``Faster growth of the economy would seriously heighten anxiety
about the financial markets, which in turn would be manifested in
the form of higher interest rates, more inflation and perhaps an
earlier recession,'' he said.
   The panel said the economic expansion of the last seven years
will be fueled by capital spending and international trade. Spending
on plant equipment is projected to climb 6 percent to 7 perent, down
from a 10 percent rise in 1988.
   But members of the panel said they foresee no progress in
reducing the federal budget deficit, instead projecting it will
increase to $158 billion in fiscal 1989, up from $155 billion.

   Stock prices slumped today as interest rates rose
in the credit markets.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 14.28 to 2,328.93 by
2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 8 to 5 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 539 up, 891
down and 474 unchanged.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, fell more than $10 for each $1,000 in
face value.
   The Treasury was scheduled to auction $9.5 billion of new 30-year
bonds today as the final step in its quarterly financing.
   An issue of 10-year notes sold on Wednesday was met with what
analysts described as a cool reception, suggesting that interest
rates would have to move up to increase demand.
   The interest-rate outlook has also been unsettled by the prospect
of a large new amount of government borrowing to help finance a plan

<TEXT>
   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange dropped
sharply Thursday in erratic trading punctuated by concerns about
interest rates.
   Caution prevailed following the market's recent strong surge, and
participants were unwilling to push prices above the psychologically
significant 2,100-point level on the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index.
   Persistent fears of rising rates in the United States, which
could forestall a hoped-for decline in Britain's interest rates,
focused attention on U.S. President George Bush's presentation of
the fiscal 1990 budget.
   At the close, the FT-SE 100-share index was down 17.1 points, or
0.8 percent, at 2,079.1. The index dropped as much as 19.7 points as
market makers knocked prices lower in early business. There was
little selling pressure hitting shares, dealers said.
   Selective buying at lower levels pulled the FT-SE index up to its
best level late in the morning, when it was up 0.8 points. But the
market took another dive after Wall Street opened for business with
fresh losses.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index was down 11.8 points
at 1702.9. Overall volume was brisk, as 830.1 million shares were
traded, little changed from 830.9 million shares on Wednesday.
However, a good portion of this reflected trading between market
makers, dealers said.
   The Financial Times 500-share index closed at 1,175.23, down 7.30.

   Colgate-Palmolive Co. reported more than a
three-fold increase in 1988 fourth-quarter earnings Thursday, partly
because of the big consumer-products firm's sale of the Kendall
health care subsidiary.
   The company said earnings totaled $126.7 million, or $1.85 a
share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, up from $38.4 million, or
56 cents a share in the corresponding 1987 quarter. Sales rose 5.9
percent to $1.21 billion from $1.14 billion.
   Earnings for the entire year totaled $317.8 million, or $4.64 per
share, a five-fold increase over the $54 million, or 78 cents per
share for 1987. Sales totaled $4.7 billion last year, up 8.4 percent
from 1987's $4.36 billion.
   In addition to a $125 million gain on the Kendall sale,
Colgate-Palmolive's financial figures were affected by a $42
million, or 61 cents a share, accounting charge to cover a one-time
payment under a new royalty and research agreement at the Hill's Pet
Products division.
   Excluding those two special items, the company said
fourth-quarter earnings totaled $43.7 million, or 64 cents a share,
up 13.9 percent from 1987's final three months. For the full year,
earnings minus the special factors totaled $234.8 million, or $3.43
per share.
   Reuben Mark, Colgate-Palmolive's chairman, president and chief
executive officer, said the improvement reflected the effectiveness
of cost reduction programs, plus particularly strong performances by
overseas operations and Hill's Pet Products.

<HEAD>Market Probe Doesn't Faze Chicagoans: They've Seen Scandal Before</HEAD>
<HEAD>Laserphoto</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This is a town that's witnessed judges on the take
and politicians on the make and a school of scandal whose roster has
drawn from the courts, the cops, even City Hall.
   Now the feds are creating a stir in Chicago's business arena with
a massive fraud investigation of the high-stakes, frenzied futures
exchanges, the world's largest commodity markets.
   But in a city that once was Al Capone's turf and has recently
seen police convicted of protecting drug dealers, judges booted off
the bench for taking bribes and aldermen put behind bars, talk of
skulduggery in the risky business of financial futures elicits more
knowing smirks than disapproving scowls.
   ``Since the political process has sanctioned corruption so long,
the fact that it occurs in business is no great surprise to
Chicago,'' said Dick Simpson, a former alderman. ``Chicagoans are
not much surprised (that) people are stealing with big bucks as
opposed to a $500 bribe. It's not shocking to the Chicago
mentality.''
   ``It's like a spectator sport,'' said Simpson, an associate
professor of political science at the University of
Illinois-Chicago. ``It'll be interesting (for people) to see if 50
traders go to jail or 20, or if it's a millionaire or some runner.
It's like watching a bullfight or a football game. There isn't
condemnation. There isn't outrage that it would be a crime.''
   Nobody has yet been indicted in the probe of the Chicago Board of
Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where millions of dollars are
made and lost on future prices of items ranging from soybeans to
foreign currency. The investigation purportedly involves charges
that as many as 100 brokers and traders systematically cheated
customers and profited in illegal deals.
   In the probe, dubbed Operation Sour Mash and Operation
Hedgeclipper, FBI agents reportedly posed as traders, leased luxury
apartments and wined and dined brokers, recording conversations with
hidden tape recorders and wireless microphones disguised as pens and
rings.
   The probe of the trading pits follows a history of Chicago
scandals and scoundrels, ranging from men who wore cleats _ eight
members of the 1919 Chicago White Sox who threw the World Series _
to men who donned judicial black robes and fixed court cases.
   At times it seems as if the city of Big Shoulders has become the
home of greased palms.
   ``Things that happen here all the time would bring down a
government in Europe,'' said political strategist Don Rose, who's
worked in several mayoral campaigns. ``One thing that contributes to
Chicago's reputation for corruption...is the higher tolerance (for
it).''
   Though citizens are sometimes jaded, Rose said, they still get
annoyed. ``We accept it and we make jokes about it (corruption),''
he said, ``but I think basically deep down we don't like it.''
   Neither do prosecutors, who've successfully used federal laws to
combat local fraud.
   Since 1972, 13 aldermen have been convicted of federal corruption
charges. Two were convicted and two others await trial in Operation
Incubator, which used FBI mole Michael Raymond to uncover influence
peddling in City Hall.
   There's also been Operation Phocus, a probe of shakedowns
involving city licensing, Operation Lantern, which investigated
alleged payoffs in city purchasing, Operation Deadfall, in which 30
police officers admitted they took small bribes to steer corpses to
certain funeral homes, and Operation Greylord, the probe of the
nation's largest court system in which 81 people, including 13
judges and 46 attorneys have been convicted or pleaded guilty.
   Those cases don't even take into account vote fraud during the
heyday of the political machine when Chicago earned a dubious
reputation as a place where names from tombstones sometimes found
their way to the voting booth.
   The machine's quid pro quo philosophy _ favors for votes _ left
open all kinds of opportunity for fraud, Simpson said.
   In fact, Chicago Tribune columnist Mike Royko said in ``Boss,''
his book about the late Mayor Richard Daley, that there were so many
deals involving ranking machine members it was suggested Chicago
change its slogan from Urbs in Horto, or ``City in a Garden,'' to
Ubi Est Mea, or ``Where's mine?''
   But much has changed: the machine has weakened, many abuses have
been curbed and court orders have diluted the once-powerful
patronage army. Some also say Chicago's image is distorted and its
problems are no worse than other big cities.
   Still, constant exposure to public corruption affects the way
people view Chicago's business world, said Terry Brunner, director
of the Better Government Association, a local watchdog group.
   ``Very few Chicagoans look at a bunch of Chicagoans ripping off
international markets as all that bad,'' he said. ``We've adapted to
things in this city (and) laugh it off (thinking) who's getting
hurt? It isn't us. It's the fat cat investors, the big corporations.
It's boys will be boys. I don't get any big sense of `Isn't that
awful?'''
   One reason is few people have a financial interest or understand
the commodities markets, with its clubby atmosphere and chaotic
shouting, jostling and flashing hand signals.
   ``Unless one is involved in one of those markets and had some
concern about being ripped off, there's less concern than if a
politician is on the take,'' Rose said.
   In this era of Wall Street scandal, there's also mistrust and
even disdain for traders.
   ``The reputation of these people is right up there with dope
dealers,'' Brunner said. ``You hear about these people buying
unbelievable houses and cars because of killings they made in the
market...They're such high rollers. There's absolutely no sympathy
out there.''
   As for the trading floors themselves, Simpson said, many expect
fast-and-loose action in such a make-or-break atmosphere.
   ``For most people on the outside,'' he said, ``it looks like a
big poker game. It's like if you suddenly found out in Las Vegas the
poker table wasn't completely on the up and up.''
   But even if the investigation results in evidence of widespread
fraud, many say the impact will be on the trading industry, rather
than Chicago.
   ``I tend to think of this as a generic financial scandal rather
than a Chicago scandal,'' Rose said. ``I don't think (people) look
at .... (Ivan) Boesky as a New York scandal,'' he said, referring to
the notorious speculator whose prosecution for inside trading led to
a broad crackdown on security abuses in Wall Street.
   Yet others say Chicago can't afford any more trouble because it
hurts the city, particularly its efforts to recruit investors.
   ``It affects the image, which Chicago doesn't need,'' said
Patrick Healy, former head of the Chicago Crime Commission and now
executive director of a firm that investigates white-collar crime.
``Chicago can take its place among any other city of the world
without this kind of nonsense.''
   Healy says it's frustrating because outsiders seem to be more
interested in Chicago's seamy side than its world-class attractions.

   A free computer program that can generate 22
million insults has won the seal of approval of an organization
devoted to the art of curses, slurs and maledictions.
   The program, Insults, combines and re-combines about 400 choice
words to produce PG-rated phrases like: ``You revolting box of fresh
bug parts,'' and, ``You skaggy bucket of infested parrot droppings.''
   Dale McKinnon, the author, said Thursday he had upgraded Insults
several times since its publication in 1983 and won the Maledicta
Seal of Approval with the current release, which was completed last
month.
   ```Insults' is a fountain of millions of high-quality insults,''
Dr. Reinhold Aman, president of the International Maledicta Society
of Waukesha, Wis., said in a statement endorsing the program.
   Insults, which is only for IBM and IBM-compatible personal
computers, is available free on computer bulletin boards and from PC
clubs. McKinnon said he charges $5 for handling if people order it
through his Salt Lake City computer consulting service, Modern
Advisory Institute.

   Stock prices took a spill today as interest rates
rose in the credit markets.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 20.71 to 2,322.50 by
3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 537 up, 928 down and
471 unchanged.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, fell more than $10 for each $1,000 in
face value.
   The Treasury was scheduled to auction $9.5 billion of new 30-year
bonds today as the final step in its quarterly financing.
   An issue of 10-year notes sold on Wednesday was met with what
analysts described as a cool reception, suggesting that interest
rates would have to move up to increase demand.
   The interest-rate outlook has also been unsettled by the prospect
of a large new amount of government borrowing to help finance a plan
to straighten out the problems at many savings institutions.
   Losers among the blue chips included Coca-Cola, down { at 47};
General Motors, down 1 at 92]; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down
{ at 31{, and Union Carbide, down ] at 29].
   First Union climbed 1 to 22{ and King World Productions gained 1|

composite index, prompting buying by index funds set up to match the
performance of the index.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.35 to 166.34. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 1.37 at 325.86.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 188.08 million shares with an

   Wheat and oat futures prices closed lower Thursday
on the Chicago Board of Trade while corn and soybeans finished
little changed in dull trading ahead of an Agriculture Department
grain supply-and-demand report.
   The report, scheduled for release after the close, was expected
to contain lower estimates for Soviet grain and Argentine soybean
production and a higher estimate for the Brazilian soybean crop.
   Analysts said there were no significant supply-and-demand
developments during the session and prices drifted with no firm
direction.
   The slight decline in wheat prices was due mainly to
profit-taking by a few large trading houses, analysts said.
   At the close, wheat was 1} cents to 3{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.25 a bushel; corn was unchanged
to 1\ cents higher with March at $2.64} a bushel; oats were } cent

<HEAD>State Holding Company Approves AT&amp;T Partnership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy's giant industrial state holding company on
Thursday approved a proposed partnership agreement between American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and Italy's telecommunications equipment
maker Italtel.
   The holding company, Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale
(IRI), said its executive committee unanimously approved the
proposal.
   Earlier this week, Societa Finanziaria Telefonica Stet PA, the
sub-holding company for IRI in the telecommunications industry,
approved the partnership between its subsidiary Italtel and the
giant U.S. telecommunications group.
   IRI, as the controlling shareholder of Stet, needed to give its
own green light to the proposed joint venture.
   The approval by IRI was widely expected and the proposal now
awaits final approval by the Italian Government. Minister of State
Industry Carlo Fracanzani, despite initial reservations about the
deal, is expected to give his approval.
   The victory for AT&amp;T concluded 14 months of preliminary talks
between Italtel and four foreign contenders for the lucrative
partnership. Offers by Siemens AG of West Germany, Alcatel NV of
France and Sweden's Telephon AB LM Ericsson were rejected by Italtel.
   By entering into a partnership with Italtel, AT&amp;T stands to win a
big slice of the $26.5 billion in orders for equipment and
technology the Italian phone company SIP SpA has planned over the
next four years.
   Italtel, following government approval, is expected to
immediately start the conclusive round of negotiations in the hope
the partnership can become operative before the summer.

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Textron Inc. on Thursday reported a 28
percent increase in fourth-quarter income, but said earnings fell
8.5 percent in 1988, mainly reflecting an after-tax loss related to
an adverse arbitration ruling.
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, income amounted to $64
million, or 74 cents a share, up from $50 million, or 55 cents a
share, in 1987's corresponding quarter. Revenue totaled $1.98
billion and $1.84 billion in the same two quarters.
   Profit, after taxes, for all of last year was $234.4 million, or
$2.67 per share, compared with $256.3 million, or $2.92 per share in
1987. Revenue came to $7.3 billion in 1988 and $7.2 billion in 1987.
   Last year's results included a $37.7 million after-tax loss
stemming from a $28 million adverse arbitration ruling involving a
former insurance subsidiary of Avco Financial Services insurance
business, and from a $9.7 million loss due to the early redemption
of high interest debt rate.
   The increase in 1988 income reflected higher operating profits in
the commercial products area and in the propulsion segment as
Textron's Lycoming division recorded record revenue and profit
following a mid-year seven-week work stoppage, the company said.
   The Providence-based Textron is a multi-industry company with
operations in three sectors: aerospace technology, commercial
products and financial services.

   High short-term interest rates are pulling
investors' cash into money market mutual funds, pumping the funds'
assets up to new highs, the Investment Company Institute said
Thursday.
   Assets of the nation's 453 money market mutual funds grew $2.26
billion in the week ended Wednesday as they set a record for the
fifth consecutive week, the institute said.
   The rise, to $287.62 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed an $18.5 million increase in the funds' assets
the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund
trade group.
   The increase was most pronounced for funds run by brokerage
firms, where individuals and institutions often park their money in
preparation for longer-term investment opportunities, said Jacob
Dreyer, the institute's vice president and chief economist.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 224 general purpose funds rose $649.3 million to $90.87
billion, assets of 92 broker-dealer funds increased $1.78 billion to
$122.51 billion, and assets of 137 institutional funds fell $171.4
million to $74.24 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.37 percent from 8.40 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 8.37 percent from 8.36 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 31
days, down from 32 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
6.35 percent as of Wednesday from 6.33 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, was unchanged at 5.14 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.41
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 8.37 the
previous week. Yields were 8.67 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.63
percent; 8.74 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.70 percent; and 8.81
percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.80 percent.

<HEAD>Fourth-Quarter Earnings Down 78.8 Percent; Restructuring Cited</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PEGGY ANDERSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. reported record
fourth-quarter revenue Thursday but a 78.8 percent drop in earnings,
attributing the results to one-time costs in the behemoth retailer's
fight to spruce up its image.
   Sears' earnings of $117.4 million, or 32 cents a share, for the
three months ended Dec. 31 compared with $554.4 million, or $1.46
per share, for the century-old company in the year-earlier period.
   The fourth consecutive quarterly earnings decline was attributed
to a $500 million outlay for the massive restructuring announced
last fall. The company is attempting to streamline and overhaul its
market approach to offer low pricing, more contemporary displays and
outside brand names.
   One analyst said he considers the fourth-quarter showing a
prelude to a major upswing for the company.
   ``Sears lacked two ingredients to growth,'' said analyst John
Landschulz with Cowen &amp; Co. in Chicago. ``One was competitive
pricing. The other was a power format _ a really aggressive
marketing tool. I think these changes address both these key
weaknesses.''
   Sears has not yet begun an all-out promotional campaign to alert
consumers to its metamorphosis. But Edward A. Brennan, company
chairman and chief executive officer, also predicted an improved
balance sheet, calling 1988 ``a year of major transition.''
   The fourth-quarter plunge reflected after-tax accounting charges
of $442 million for the restructuring of Sears Merchandise Group and
$58.6 million for a loss on the sale of Sears' Allstate group life
and health insurance, the company said.
   Fourth-quarter revenue totaled a record $14.56 billion, up 9
percent from $13.36 billion for the year-earlier period.
   Sears has said the restructuring includes the planned sale of the
landmark Sears Tower and Coldwell Bankers commercial real estate
subsidiary, plus the buyback of 10 percent of its 380 million
outstanding shares.
   The company said it would concentrate on consumer-oriented
businesses _ retailing, insurance, residential real estate and
financial services.
   Before the restructuring charge, the company said, fourth-quarter
earnings totaled $618 million or $1.65 per share.
   For the year ended Dec. 31, earnings totaled $1.45 billion or
$3.84 per share, 11 percent down from $1.63 billion or $4.30 per
share in 1987. Revenue totaled a record $50.25 billion, up 9.5
percent from $40.95 billion in 1987.
   Sears said 1988 results include the adoption of new income tax
and insurance accounting standards, and discontinuance of Allstate's
group life-health operations and Coldwell Banker's commercial
division.
   Revenue for all previous periods was restated for the
discontinued operations and the new accounting standard, the company
said.
   Sears Merchandise Group reported a fourth-quarter loss of $113.5
million after the $442 million restructuring charge. Before the
charge, the group's fourth-quarter income was $328.5 million, down
from $414.9 million in 1987.

   A falling dollar and rising interest rates sent
stock prices broadly lower Thursday, pinning the Dow Jones
industrial average with its largest loss since the first session of
1989.
   Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips fell 20.17 to 2,323.04, for
its biggest point drop since it lost 23.93 on Jan. 3.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
504 up, 1,003 down and 461 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 224.22 million
shares, up from 189.42 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 256.79 million shares.
   The dollar fell in foreign-exchange trading, and prices of
long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction
from interest rates, dropped more than $15 for each $1,000 in face
value.
   The Treasury auctioned $9.5 billion of new 30-year bonds Thursday
as the final step in its quarterly financing.
   That and an issue of 10-year notes sold on Wednesday met with
what analysts described as a cool reception, suggesting that
interest rates would have to move up to increase demand.
   The interest-rate outlook has also been unsettled by the prospect
of a large new amount of government borrowing to help finance a plan
to straighten out the problems at many savings institutions.
   Analysts said traders in all the markets turned cautious as they
awaited President Bush's budget message scheduled for Thursday night.
   Trading activity on the Big Board was swollen by dividend-related
transactions in three stocks _ Houston Industries, down \ at 28;
Philadelphia Electric, unchanged at 20~, and Allied-Signal, down ]
at 35.
   Losers among the blue chips included Coca-Cola, down { at 47};
General Motors, down { at 92~; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down
\ at 31}; International Business Machines, down | at 126], and
Philip Morris, down 1| at 109\.
   First Union climbed 1 to 22{ and King World Productions gained 1{
to 26{. The stocks were added to Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
composite index, prompting buying by index funds set up to match the
performance of the index.
   Miniscribe dropped 1 to 4~ in the over-the-counter market. The
company, which makes disk drives, said it expects to report a loss
for the fourth quarter of last year.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $24.71 billion, or 0.84
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slumped 1.56 to 166.13.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 3.15 to 342.16, and the
500-stock composite was down 2.59 at 296.06.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 1.58 to 406.39. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 325.36, down 1.87.

   The dollar dropped sharply Thursday as traders
speculated that President Bush would say nothing new in his budget
message about cutting the federal deficit.
   In its biggest one-day decline in weeks, the dollar lost roughly
1.2 percent of its value against such currencies as the West German
mark, Japanese yen, British pound and Swiss franc.
   The sharp drop came after several steady sessions in which
dealers had been reluctant to trade actively because of uncertainty
about what Bush would say in his Thursday evening address.
   On Thursday, traders guessed the speech would be negative or at
best neutral for the dollar and decided to sell before others did,
said Marc Cohen, a vice president at Republic National Bank of New
York.
   ``It's almost the market attempting to anticipate the
anticipation of others,'' Cohen said. ``Everybody saw somebody
making it for the door and said, `Wait.'''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.11 Japanese yen to a closing 129.39 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 128.53 yen. In New York, the dollar sank to
127.93 yen from 129.38 yen late Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7540, compared with
$1.7423 late Wednesday. In New York, the pound rose to $1.7645 from
$1.7440.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8475 West German marks, down from
1.8698; 1.5675 Swiss francs, down from 1.5895; 1.1836 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1844; 6.2875 French francs, down from 6.3640;
and 1,347.5 Italian lire, down from 1,363.6.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday's
rates, included: 1.8585 West German marks, down from 1.8720; 1.5801
Swiss francs, down from 1.5916; 6.3225 French francs, down from
6.3725; 2.0990 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1140; 1,355.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,364.25; and 1.1832 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1847.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose to a closing bid of $395.58 a troy ounce,
compared with $395.07 a week ago. Financial markets in Hong Kong
have been closed for the Chinese lunar new year celebrations.
   In London gold was trading at a late price of $394.25 a troy
ounce, compared with $390.25 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich,
Switzerland, the bid price was the same as in London, $394.25, well
up from $390.85 bid late Wednesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $394.40 a troy ounce from $396.20. Later, Republic
National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $393.25 an ounce from
$394.25.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a bid price of $5.90 a troy
ounce from $5.88 bid late Wednesday. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery fell to $5.891 a troy ounce from $5.917.

   A government report showing a larger-than-expected U.S. cattle
herd knocked cattle futures prices to the mat Thursday on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange but analysts were skeptical of the
report's accuracy.
   On other markets, cotton futures prices fell sharply; grains and
soybeans were mixed; precious metals futures declined; and energy
futures were mixed.
   Prices for all cattle futures except the February live cattle
contract plunged the permitted daily limit of 1{ cents at the
opening bell and stayed limit-down for the rest of the session. The
contract for February delivery of live cattle settled 1.40 cents
lower at 73.97 cents a pound while the near-month feeder cattle
contract, for delivery in March, settled at 82.92 cents a pound.
   Pork futures prices fell in sympathy with the cattle market. Live
hogs finished .50 cent to 1.05 cents lower with February at 41.90
cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .12 cent to 1.13 cents lower
with February at 37.57 cents a pound.
   The sell-off was triggered by Wednesday's semi-annual USDA cattle
inventory report, a head count of the nation's cattle herd. The USDA
reported there were 99.5 million cattle and calves in the United
States as of Jan. 1, only a few thousand fewer than the previous
year.
   The industry consensus expectation was for the herd to total
fewer than 98 million cattle. The USDA report implied that after six
years of thinning cattle numbers, producers were starting to rebuild
their herds.
   But many analysts said they did not believe the report,
especially its implication of an extremely high birth rate in the
second half of 1988.
   ``We had a 92 percent calving rate, the highest in 15 years, in a
year when you had the driest, hottest summer since 1932,'' said Tom
O'Hare, an analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   ``This looks like one of those aberrational things where you've
got to wonder what's going on here,'' he said. ``There are just too
many contrary things to come into (the report) to really believe
it.''
   Analysts said the bulk of the futures selling appeared to have
come from speculative commodity funds, not cattle producers or beef
processors, possibly an indication that the beef industry also was
skeptical of the USDA numbers.
   Cotton futures prices fell sharply on the New York Cotton
Exchange on expectations that another USDA report would be bearish
for the cotton market.
   And so it was. In a monthly supply-demand report issued after the
close of trading, the USDA estimated the U.S. cotton stockpile on
Aug. 1 would stand at 9.2 million bales, compared with the January
estimate of 8.8 million bales and the Aug. 1, 1988 stockpile of 5.8
million bales.
   Cotton settled .80 cent to 1.75 cent lower with March at 57.64
cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures were mixed on the Chicago Board of
Trade in dull trading ahead of the same USDA supply-demand report.
   In the report, the government lowered its estimate for 1988-89
Argentine soybean production to 9 million metric tons from 11
million metric tons and lowered its 1988-89 Argentine corn
production forecast to 6 million metric tons from 8 million.
   The USDA also lowered its 1988-89 Soviet grain production
estimate by 5 million metric tons to 195 million.
   Analysts interpreted the report as neutral to slightly bullish
for grain and soybean futures.
   Wheat settled 1} cents to 3\ cents lower with March at $4.25\ a
bushel; corn was \ cent lower to 1\ cents higher with March at $2.65
a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 3{ cents lower with March at $2.06 a
bushel; soybeans were 1\ cents lower to } cent higher with March at
$7.46 a bushel.
   Gold and silver futures retreated modestly in
technically-inspired trading on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled $1.10 to $1.30 lower with April at $398 a troy
ounce; silver was 2.4 cents to 3 cents lower with March at $5.915 a
troy ounce.
   Energy futures prices finished narrowly mixed on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in an uneventful session.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 10 cents lower to 9
cents higher with March at $17.39 a barrel; heating oil was .46 cent
lower to .27 cent higher with March at 48.61 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .30 cent to .58 cent lower with March at 48.36
cents a gallon.

<HEAD>With AM-Eastern-Machinists Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp., the nation's largest airline
company, reported a $224.4 million fourth-quarter loss Thursday,
attributing the results to travails that ranged from federal safety
probes to labor-management turmoil at its Eastern and Continental
subsidiaries.
   The October-December performance compared with a $265.6 million
loss in the year-earlier period, and widened the overall 1988 loss
to $718.6 million _ 54 percent greater than the $466.2 million Texas
Air lost in 1987.
   Miami-based Eastern reported losses of $101.7 million for the
quarter on revenues of $844.4 million. That compared with a loss of
$143.4 million on revenues of $1 billion in the same period a year
earlier.
   Houston-based Continental incurred a fourth-quarter loss of $99.2
million on revenues of $1.1 billion. During the same period in 1987,
Continental lost $78.8 million on revenues of $1.1 billion.
   Fourth-quarter revenue for the parent company totaled $2 billion
vs. $2.1 billion in the year-earlier quarter. For all of 1988, Texas
Air revenue totaled $8.6 billion, the same as the year earlier.
   Eastern lost $335.4 million on revenues of $3.8 billion for all
of 1988. In 1987, Eastern lost $181.7 million on revenues of $4.4
billion.
   Continental lost $315.5 million on revenues of $4.7 billion for
all of 1988, vs. a $258.1 million loss on revenues of $4.1 billion
in 1987.
   In a statement, Texas Air said the 1988 results ``reflected the
numerous and unprecedented challenges faced by both Continental and
Eastern during the past year'' and that future results at the two
airlines ``will reflect the fact that these challenges are being
successfully met.''
   In 1988, both airlines were subject of an unprecedented
investigation by the Department of Transportation and the Federal
Aviation Administration, which determined the two carriers were run
safely.
   The probe, however, concluded that labor turmoil at Eastern must
be defused before it creates risks to passengers.
   The turmoil intensified this week with Eastern's militant
machinists, who were voting on whether to authorize a strike next
month.
   Last week, Continental's president, Martin Shugrue, quit after a
year on the job, becoming the carrier's sixth former president in as
many years.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All three measures of the nation's money supply
advanced in late January, the Federal Reserve Board reported
Thursday.
   The Fed said its narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose
$900 million to a seasonally adjusted $787.1 billion in the week
ended Jan. 30 from $786.2 billion in the previous week.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose $600 million to a
seasonally adjusted $3,072.0 billion from $3,071.4 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased $900 million to a
seasonally adjusted $3,920.6 billion from $3,919.7 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The Fed last year set a provisional target for 1989 of 3 percent
to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent growth in
M3. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,067.8 billion, a 4.3
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13
weeks. M3 averaged $3,911.4 billion, up 5.2 percent, while M1 rose
2.0 percent to an average of $787.8 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported discount window
borrowing, exclusing extended credit, averaged $698 million a day in
the week ended Wednesday, up from $263 million in the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $288.0 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, down from
$290.7 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Japanese Automakers Introduce New Sports Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. on Thursday unveiled a
new two-seat roadster, a throwback to the 1960s aimed at a part of
the U.S. car market with no competition.
   The M-5 Miata is scheduled to go on sale in Mazda dealerships
nationwide this July. At a base price of less than $14,000, the
Miata is targeting a segment of the car market largely vacated. One
reason is the rising expense of imports, a result of the dollar's
lower value in recent years.
   Honda Motor Corp., another Japanese automaker, said it planned an
introduction of its new two-seat Acura sports car. At a reported
price of $55,000, it's at the other end of the price scale from the
Miata.
   The carmakers disclosed their plans at Chicago's annual auto
show, an important forum for rivals vying for a chunk of the
lucrative U.S. market. Officials from all major manufacturers have
been holding press briefing prior to the show's official opening
Saturday.
   Mazda also unveiled a new version of its RX-7 sports car with a
redeveloped rotary engine that boosts horsepower while improving gas
mileage. The changes also pushed up the RX-7's base sticker price by
about $1,000 to about $17,000, said George McCabe, vice president
for sales and marketing Mazda Motor of America Inc., the automaker's
U.S. arm.
   There are no U.S. or imported two-seat sports cars in Miata's
price range. Mazda officials said Miata, a front-engine, rear-wheel
drive car, was designed specifically for the U.S. market.
   McCabe said the company planned to import about 20,000 Miatas
this year, and boost that to about 40,000 annually after that.
   The two-seat sports car market has been shaky in the U.S. during
the past several years, McCabe said, dropping from 2.4 percent of
the entire car market in 1986 to 1.3 percent last year.
   He said Mazda thinks interest in the car remains, but the rising
prices have made the cars less affordable.
   Among domestic carmakers, Ford officials said Thursday they plan
a newly designed Lincoln Town Car, descriibing it as a rounder
version of the hugely successful top-of-the-line luxury model. They
declined to disclose the cost.
   The Town Car for 1990, which is nearing production, will retain
its traditional interior size and trunk space but it could be longer
than current models despite being built on the same platform, said
Robert Rewey, vice president for sales of Ford's North American
operations.
   Base prices for the 1989 Town Car range from $25,562 to $29,709.
The 1989 Town Car Signature V-8 engine remains for 1990. A new
standard feature is air bags on the driver's and passenger's side of
the front seat.
   Rewey also suggested Ford might produce a successor to the Ford
Escort and the Mercury Tracer. No date was set.

<HEAD>Mood Uncertain As KKR Tender Offer For RJR Nabisco Ends</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ RJR Nabisco Inc. employees and local
business leaders were still wondering about the company's future
Thursday as the record $24.53 billion tender offer for the food and
tobacco giant expired.
   Frank Doss, a 22-year veteran of the company's R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co. subsidiary, voiced a concern held by many workers: How
would Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., RJR Nabisco's new owner, repay
the massive debt it took on to buy the firm?
   ``I'm concerned about layoffs and possible cuts in benefits,''
Doss said.
   Kohlberg Kravis is acquiring RJR Nabisco through a leveraged
buyout, which involves heavy borrowing. LBO debt is repaid through
the sale of a company's assets or with its cash flow, and
cost-cutting and job reductions often result.
   RJR Nabisco workers also worried about who would eventually run
the company and whether the tobacco division's headquarters would be
moved from Winston-Salem.
   The possible economic and social impact of the buyout could be
far-reaching in Forsyth County, where an estimated $1.5 billion in
RJR stock is held by individuals and where thousands of jobs are
linked to the fate of R.J. Reynolds.
   Kohlberg Kravis' tender offer for RJR Nabisco stock expired
Thursday morning, and the investment firm said it had been tendered
approximately 97.2 percent of the outstanding common shares.
   Doss and another RJR Reynolds worker, Larry Jones, who has put in
14 years at the tobacco company, said they tendered their RJR stock
before Thursday's deadline. They also could have sold their shares
of the stock, which closed at more than $100 a share on Wednesday.
   ``People were selling their stock and others were buying it,''
Jones said. ``So I guess that says something about the faith they
have in it.''
   Kohlberg Kravis also announced Thursday that J. Paul Sticht, a
former RJR Industries Inc. chairman, had been appointed acting chief
executive officer, replacing F. Ross Johnson, who resigned.
   A group led by Johnson made the first move toward buying RJR
Nabisco back in October and then fought a losing battle against
Kohlberg Kravis.
   Ever since the takeover fight began, stories circulated of
production-line workers who would become millionaires as stock
prices nearly doubled. Those stories were tempered somewhat by the
rumors of layoffs and cutbacks.
   Thursday's developments passed with little notice in the streets
around the tobacco company's headquarters. RJR Reynolds spokesman
David Fischel said it was not considered a landmark day at the
division.
   ``I'd say most of the excitement right now is centered at the
banks and stock brokerage firms,'' he said.
   Fred Nordenholz, president of the Winston-Salem Chamber of
Commerce, said he expected there would be more fireworks before the
deal was finalized.
   ``When you're involved in battle, the adrenalin begins to pump
when the first shots are fired,'' he said. ``We're waiting to see
what happens.''
   It was not immediately known when the acquisition would be
completed.

   Energy futures prices were mixed in subdued
trading Thursday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 10
cents to $17.39 a barrel after losing 21 cents in Wednesday's
session. Contracts for delivery later in the year were mixed.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the March contract
for unleaded gasoline declined 0.58 cent to 48.36 cents a gallon,
while domestic heating oil fell 0.46 cent to close the day at 48.61
cents a gallon.
   Other contract months were mixed.
   Analysts said prices remained in a narrow trading range
throughout the session with volume relatively light.
   Prices have fluctuated in recent weeks, as uncertainty set in
following several weeks of steadily rising prices. Investors have
been reluctant to take positions as they await more information on
the market's direction, analysts said.
   Prices had been climbing steadily since last November when the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to lower its
production. However, energy analysts said the market softened in
recent weeks partly on technical factors after the rapid rise and as
investors await word on whether OPEC is adhering to its agreement.

<HEAD>Kodak Wants To Cut Costs By 15 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. said Thursday it wants
to cut its non-essential costs by 15 percent and may do so by
trimming its work force, selling businesses or ending product lines.
   ``I think it would be inaccurate to call this a job reduction
plan,'' said Kodak spokesman Paul Allen. ``We're asking unit
managers to start looking very closely at their businesses and start
making some decisions from the viewpoint of profitability.''
   Allen said costs directly related to raw materials and production
won't be subject to the cutbacks, but that all of the company's
products and business units will be reviewed to determine whether
they're worth keeping.
   ``Over the last eight years Kodak has made a lot of strategic
acquisitions,'' Allen said. ``What we haven't done is a lot of
strategic divestment.''
   The announcement came a day after Kodak reported record sales and
earnings in 1988.
   Kodak's 1988 profit rose 19 percent to a record $1.4 billion, or
$4.31 a share, compared with $1.2 billion, or $3.52 a share, in
1987. Sales rose 28 percent to a record $17.03 billion, up from
$13.3 billion in 1987.
   The results were boosted by the contribution of Sterling Drug
Co., which Kodak acquired in February 1988.
   Allen said the comprehensive look at the company is part of the
changes that have taken place at Kodak since the company began a
massive reorganization in 1984.
   In a presentation to employees Wednesday, part of an ongoing
series, Chairman Colby Chandler outlined the study but didn't say
which businesses, products or employees would be affected.
   Stock analysts said that even the company may not know for sure.
   ``It could include some of the things in the electronics area, or
office equipment, or batteries,'' said Peter Enderlin, an analyst
with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York. ``It doesn't have
to be businesses in trouble. Some of the joint ventures they have
are still very small and may have a lot of potential but aren't
worth the trouble to Kodak.''

<HEAD>Braniff to Move HQ to Orlando, Expand Facilities in Kansas City</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IKE FLORES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Braniff Inc. announced Thursday it will move
its headquarters from Dallas to Orlando and expand support
facilities in Orlando and in Kansas City to the tune of $40 million
and 1,400 jobs in the next year.
   Kansas City will remain the airline's primary hub, Braniff
Chairman William G. McGee told an Orlando news conference. But the
carrier wants to participate ``in one of the most dynamic growth
areas of the country'' by moving its corporate base to Orlando.
   The airline, which began operating in Central Florida a year ago
with the acquisition of Florida Express, will build new maintenance
facilities at both Kansas City and Orlando as well as a headquarters
building in Orlando, McGee said.
   ``This aggressive expansion program coupled with our already
announced plans to increase our fleet by a net of 22 additional
aircraft this year will fuel a 35 percent company-wide growth in
employment over the next 12 months,'' McGee said.
   He estimated the annual economic impact of the expansion program
at $250 million in Kansas City and $50 million in Orlando.
   The headquarters move is to begin in May and involve about 125
professional and clerical workers now at Love Field in Dallas. The
airline also will build a $10 million maintenance facility in
Orlando.
   The company wants to ``reinforce our commitment to the growth and
prosperity'' of the Kansas City hub by building a $10 million
maintenance operation there, reopening a reservations center,
expanding the number of airport gates and increasing daily flight
departures to 105 by mid-summer, McGee said.
   The number of employees in Kansas City will climb from 1,475 to
2,000 by mid-summer, he said, and jump from 720 to 1,165 in Orlando
during the coming year.
   Some 450 Braniff employees will remain in Dallas, mainly in
financial and administratrive jobs, company officials said.
   The chairman called Braniff a ``niche carrier'' that is ``fast
becoming a major carrier'' with good growth potential in a highly
competitive industry. ``We expect to turn a profit in 1989,'' he
added.
   Braniff filed for bankruptcy protection in 1982 with nearly $1
billion in debt. It started flying again in 1984 as a low-cost,
no-frills carrier.
   The airline was acquired by investors last summer, shifted most
of its flight operations to Kansas City and began trying to attract
more business travelers by increasing its daily departure schedules.
It then ordered more than $2 billion worth of new airplanes.
   ``We will need these (new) facilities and the new personnel to
support our growth plan,'' McGee said.
   The Philadelphia-based investor group controlling the company is
CoreGroup, headed by Jeffrey R. Chodorow and Arthur Cohen.
   Braniff serves 31 destinations from Kansas City and 16 from
Orlando. It has more than 4,000 employees, including 440 pilots, and
operates 53 aircraft.

   Chicago Board of Trade executives informed members
Thursday of plans for an electronic trading system that would
operate during hours when the trading floor is closed, sources said.
   Exchange Chairman Karsten Mahlmann said the system was designed
to give foreign investors easier access to the Board of Trade's
burgeoning market for U.S. Treasury bond futures, according to
exchange members who attended the closed-door meeting.
   But industry observers said the move into computerized trading by
the world's largest futures exchange appeared to be prompted by a
federal investigation of suspected fraud at the Board of Trade and
the rival Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   The proposal apparently represents a 180-degree turn in
philosophy for the Board of Trade, which last fall decried a similar
system being developed by the Chicago Merc as inefficient, prone to
abuse and a poor substitute for the traditional ``open-outcry''
method of futures trading.
   A Board of Trade spokesman said he could not comment on the
meeting.
   One veteran trader who attended the meeting said Mahlmann touted
the proposed system as ``the closest thing to the open-outcry
system'' and thus superior to the Globex system being developed by
the Merc.
   Like Globex, the Board of Trade's system would use a computer to
match orders to buy and sell contracts for future deliveries of
financial instruments.
   Also like Globex, the system would be open to other futures
exchanges that wish to list their products for trading.
   But unlike Globex, which the Merc is developing in partnership
with London-based Reuters PLC, the Board of Trade system would be
developed and owned entirely by the exchange and its members.
   The exchange plans to hold several smaller meetings with traders
over the next three weeks to explain the system before putting it to
a membership vote March 2, according to traders who attended the
meeting.
   Mahlmann said the Board of Trade would retain its 21-month-old
night trading session for Treasury bond futures, a successful effort
to attract more business from Japan.
   Details about the electronic system were sketchy and many
traders, who spoke on condition of anonymity, left the meeting
confused.
   ``If the floor vote were held today I don't think it would
pass,'' said one trader. ``Not because people are against it in
principle, but there are just too many questions about it.''
   Industry observers linked the exchange's change of heart about
electronic trading to the recently disclosed investigation of
futures trading.
   ``What this whole scandal has done is to bring up the time when
computerization is the norm,'' said Daniel Siegel, a professor of
finance at Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School of
Management.
   ``As soon as you mechanize, you're removing the human element,
and the human element is what this latest furor is all about,''
added Robert E. Whaley, an associate professor and co-director of
the Futures and Options Research Center at Duke University's Fuqua
School of Business in Durham, N.C.
   Electronic trading systems use computers to match buy and sell
orders. Several foreign futures exchanges already operate such
systems.
   All commodities trading in the United States now is done by
professional traders who crowd into recessed pits on exchange floors
and execute customer orders through a combination of shouts and hand
signals.
   Abuse of this ``open-outcry'' trading method is the apparent
target of a Justice Department investigation revealed on Jan. 19.
   Federal authorities reportedly are investigating allegations that
as many as 100 traders and brokers systematically cheated customers
out of millions of dollars while executing their orders in the
futures markets.
   The Merc's Globex is seen as a way to make its financial futures
markets more convenient for overseas customers.
   Last September, Board of Trade President Thomas Donovan urged the
federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission not to approve Globex,
contending in a letter that the proposed system was ``inherently
susceptible to manipulation, prearranged trading and other abuses.''
   The CFTC approved Globex last week. The New York Mercantile
Exchange, which trades crude oil and platinum futures, and the
Sydney Futures Exchange of Australia have agreed to list some of
their products for Globex trading.

   President Bush, making his first appearance
before Congress, proposed a $1.16 trillion budget Thursday night
that would increase money for social programs but freeze Pentagon
spending. He promised to ``work day and night'' with Congress to put
America's fiscal house in order.
   In a prime-time, nationally broadcast appearance, Bush proposed
slashing $2.6 billion from the defense budget proposed by former
President Reagan to help offset costs of the expanded domestic
programs.
   Bush, in prepared remarks to the heavily Democratic Congress,
also voiced his personal support for making Puerto Rico the nation's
51st state and called on Congress ``to take the necessary steps to
let the people decide in a referendum.''
   And he said he would set up a new Task Force on Competitiveness,
chaired by Vice President Dan Quayle. Saying, ``The most important
competitiveness program of all is one that improves education in
America,'' he traced a number of schooling initiatives.
   The Bush speech was not a State of the Union address _ Reagan
produced one on paper before leaving office last month _ but it
stood for one, touching upon key foreign policy issues as well as
the entire range of domestic concerns.
   The president's budget plan, which features a one-year freeze on
scores of federal programs, calls for roughly $5 billion more
spending than the budget submitted by Reagan last month and carries
out Bush's oft-stated vow of not seeking any increase in taxes.
   He said his offer to freeze Pentagon spending was conditioned on
reaching an overall agreement with Congress that included budget
reforms. He proposed that the government go to a two-year budget
process, rather than one year, and asked like Reagan before him for
the power for a line-item veto. Bush's first presidential speech
mixed campaign promises with expressions of budget restraint and new
overtures toward bipartisanship.
   Initial reaction from congressional leaders was cordial. ``The
Democratic Congress wants to work with this president in every way
that we can,'' House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said in a taped
response to Bush's speech that was carried on television networks.
   ``We'll give him our sincere cooperation. That does not mean
obedience. It does mean our honest help and our very best advice,''
Wright said.
   Bush reiterated a vow from his inaugural address to extend a hand
to Congress. ``My team and I are ready to work with the Congress, to
form a special leadership group, to negotiate in good faith, to work
night and day _ if that's what it takes _ to meet the budget targets
and to produce a budget on time.''
   Among Bush's major proposals were:
   _ An increase in funding for the space program of $2.4 billion
over the current year.
   _ Indefinite postponement of three oil drilling leases ``which
have raised troubling questions,'' two off the coast of California
and one in Florida ``which could threaten the Everglades.''
   _ A $1,000-per child tax credit for low-income families and a
$3,000 deduction to help defer the cost of adoptions.
   _ The first installment toward $500 million in grants for the
nation's best schools, rewards for teachers, and an expansion of the
Head Start program.
   ``I have said I'd like to be `the education president.' Tonight,
I ask you to join me by becoming `the education Congress,''' he said.
   Bush devoted the bulk of his speech to domestic issues, talking
about the expanded programs he had promised during his presidential
campaign.
   But he also said that ``securing a more peaceful world is perhaps
the most important priority I'd like to address.''
   He said it was a time of ``great change in the world,'' and while
the United States should be encouraged by signs of reform in the
Soviet Union, the Kremlin clings to ``objectives which are still too
often in conflict with ours.''
   He promised to ``vigorously pursue'' development of a space-based
missile defense shield, the so-called Star Wars concept, and
declared that chemical weapons ``must be banned from the face of the
Earth.'' He also said the United States must persevere in its
support of anti-communist freedom fighter movements around the globe.
   ``The hands remain extended, the sleeves are rolled up, America
is waiting, and we must produce. Together, we can build a better
America,'' Bush said.
   He noted that he had first entered the House chamber 22 years
ago, when he was sworn in as a freshman congressman from Texas.
   Referring to the chairs behind him where the House speaker and
the vice president sit, Bush said, ``Eight years ago, I sat in that
chair as President Reagan spoke of punishing inflation and
devastatingly high interest rates, people out of work, American
confidence on the wane. Our challenge is different.''
   Noting the record six-year peacetime expansion, Bush declared,
``We are headed the right way. But we cannot rest.''
   Bush called for a new aggressive push in fighting ``the scourge
of drug abuse,'' including a $6 billion budget to fight drugs,
nearly a $1 billion increase over current spending.
   ``Let this be recorded as the time when America rose up and said,
`no' to drugs ... The war will be waged on all fronts.''
   Borrowing a line from former Democratic presidential candidate
Jesse Jackson, Bush said, ``To kids in our cities _ don't give up
hope. Say no to drugs. Stay in school. And yes, `keep hope alive.'''
   In remarks addressed to his television audience ``watching
tonight in your living rooms,'' Bush said: ``hold fast to your
dreams, because ultimately America's future rests in your hands.''
   ``And to my friends in this chamber, I ask for your cooperation
to keep America growing while cutting the deficit. That is only fair
to those who now have no vote _ the generations to come.''
   His budget was vague on exactly where all the money would come
from to pay for initiatives.

   President Bush called on Congress Thursday
night to cut taxes on capital gains, whose benefits go primarily to
people making more than $100,000 a year, and to enact a new tax
break for low-income families.
   In a move that could be viewed as violating his ``no-new-taxes''
pledge, the president also recommended an extension of the 3 percent
tax on telephone service, which is due to expire at the end of 1990,
and to eliminate a scheduled reduction in taxes on airline tickets
and cargo.
   He also proposed a $2-billion-a-year tax cut for corporate
research costs; a Social Security tax increase of about the same
size on 2 million employees of state and local governments; and new
tax incentives for the oil industry and for parents who adopt.
   Bush, in his outline for ``Building a Better America,'' endorsed
most of the miscellaneous revenue measures that then-President
Reagan sent to Congress last month. But the new president apparently
abandoned a Reagan proposal that would have had the Internal Revenue
Service charge taxpayers a fee when they call for advice on filling
out their tax returns.
   By far the hottest issue in the revenue package is the proposal
to cut the capital-gains tax. Bush added fuel to this long-running
debate by claiming that his proposal would not cost the treasury a
dime but would, in fact, raise more than $16 billion over the next
five years, but lose $20.1 billion the following three years.
   ``Restoring the capital-gains differential will increase
entrepreneurial activity and employment, paving the way for
discoveries of new products, processes, and whole new industries,''
Bush said.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the tax-writing House
Ways and Means Committee, vowed all-out opposition to a
capital-gains cut.
   ``I'm not about to tell the wage earners in Chicago that they
should pay a higher tax than stockbrokers,'' Rostenkowski told the
National Press Club. ``I personally will strongly resist any efforts
to undo (the 1986) tax reform, including the return to a
preferential tax rate for capital gains.''
   Capital gains, which are profits from the sale of stock, real
estate and other assets, traditionally were taxed at lower rates
than wages and other income, under the assumption that most such
investments are good for the economy. Congress repealed that
preferential treatment in 1986 as part of the price of reducing
individual tax rates in the landmark tax overhaul.
   Thus, capital gains and wages now are taxed the same: at rates of
15 percent, 28 percent and 33 percent.
   Bush proposed to phase in a new capital-gains preference that
would produce a maximum rate of 15 percent on most gains; for those
at the lower end of the income scale, the rate would be 8.25
percent. Coins, paintings and other collectibles would not qualify
for the preference.
   In general, couples with incomes under $20,000 and single people
under $10,000 would pay no tax on any qualified capital gain.
   IRS estimates from returns filed in 1987 _ the last year for
which complete figures are available _ show that taxable capital
gains of $135 billion were reported on 12.9 million of the 103
million returns filed that year.
   More than one-third of that gain was recorded by only 34,818
taxpayers with incomes over $1 million a year. Their gain: $46.5
billion. The 1.15 million taxpayers with incomes over $100,000 had
70 percent _ $95 billion _ of the gain. About 3.7 million taxpayers
with incomes under $20,000 had less than 7 percent of the gain.
   Other Bush revenue proposals:
   _Make permanent the 3 percent tax on local and long-distance
telephone service, which otherwise would expire Dec. 31, 1990. This
would cost taxpayers $6 billion in the following three years.
   _Authorize a new tax credit of up to $1,000 a year for each child
under age 4 in an estimated 2.5 million working families with
incomes under $13,000. The credit, designed to assist with
child-care expenses, would be available even if the family owes no
tax. The family could choose between this credit and the existing
dependent-care credit, which can be worth up to $1,440 a year.
   _Require 2 million state and local government workers hired after
March 31, 1986, to pay a tax for Medicare coverage. Many already are
eligible for Medicare because of a prior job or a working spouse.
The tax, collected as part of the Social Security levy, is 1.45
percent of the first $48,000 of annual earnings.
   _Retain the full federal tax on airline tickets, air cargo and
aviation fuel. A new law would cut them by half next year because
Congress contends the government is not spending the money quickly
enough for airport and airway improvements.
   _Give the oil and gas industry tax credits for the first $10
million of expenditures each year on such intangible oil-drilling
expenses as labor and pipe, and for spending required to use
sophisticated ``tertiary'' techniques to produce oil. Rules that
hinder the sale of proven oil properties to independent producers
would be repealed. Independent producers would be allowed to deduct
from the minimum tax 80 percent of certain exploratory intangible
drilling costs.
   _Permit a deduction of up to $3,000 for expenses of adopting a
child with special needs, such as a physical handicap.
   _Make permanent a 20 percent credit for increased corporate
spending for research, and permit international corporations to
deduct 67 percent of total research spending against domestic income.
   _Give businesses $1 billion worth of tax incentives over four
years for locating in economically distressed areas.

   President Bush proposed Thursday to change the
direction of the federal budget by moving money away from military
growth and toward social progams that make up his vision of a kinder
and gentler nation.
   The $1.16 trillion spending plan he sent Congress would boost
federal money in fiscal 1990 for cleaning up the environment, for
AIDS research, for aid to the homeless and for education.
   ``This budget represents my best judgment of how we can address
our priorities, consistent with the people's view,'' Bush said in an
address to Congress. ``There are many areas in which we would all
like to spend more than I propose, but we cannot until we get our
fiscal house in order.''
   Richard Darman, the president's budget director, said Bush was
making ``a very credible start'' toward the kinder, gentler society
he has said repeatedly he wants.
   Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, said, ``The Bush administration has signaled an end to
the defense buildup and has indicated they're willing to flow some
defense expenditures into meeting domestic needs like education.''
   Overall, the Bush plan rests heavily on the foundation laid down
by former President Reagan's budget last month.
   He embraces Reagan's call for cost-cutting in entitlement
programs, including $5 billion from Medicare and lesser amounts from
farm price supports and federal employee benefits.
   The Bush plan would reject a few of Reagan's least popular
proposals, such as cutting the school lunch program and imposing a
new fee for veterans' home loans, Darman indicated.
   The vast majority of Reagan's budget was carried over by Bush,
who as part of his no-growth ``flexible freeze'' policy, set a
ceiling for these hundreds of programs roughly equal to what Reagan
proposed. But Bush appealed to Congress to join him in shifting
money between programs within this group so long as the totals still
meet deficit-reduction goals.
   Among the Reagan proposals lumped into this group are
terminations of 82 popular domestic programs. Bush's document
allowed him to avoid specifically endorsing each one while still
claiming the overall savings.
   Bush claimed he met his pledge of no new general tax increase,
but he did propose continuing two taxes that are scheduled to expire
or decline _ the 3 percent federal tax on local and long distance
telephone calls and the 8 percent tax on airline tickets.
   The Bush budget document says the federal deficit would be
reduced to less than $91.1 billion next year, just slightly lower
than the $92.5 billion in Reagan's proposal and within the $100
billion fiscal 1990 limit of the Gramm-Rudman law.
   The Bush White House estimates the deficit in the current fiscal
year, which ends Sept. 30, will be about $163.3 billion _ more than
$2 billion higher than Reagan was estimating just last month.
   The new president would trim back his predecessor's plan to
increase military spending faster than the pace of inflation.
Instead, military outlays of $298.2 billion this year would just
keep up with inflation and increase to $300.3 billion. That would
free $2.6 billion for other programs, compared to Reagan's plan.
   Bush proposed reducing the tax rate on capital gains to as low as
15 percent on productive assets held more than two years. That's
less than half the current top capital gains rate. He predicted
that, rather than reducing federal revenues as many economics
predict, this move would increase them by $4.8 billion because the
rate cut would expand the economy and the tax base.
   Although many in the Democratic-controlled Congress oppose the
capital gains proposal as a break for the rich that would cost money
in the long run, many favor some areas where Bush says he wants to
put the money.
   Bush was proposing to increase subsidies for energy development
and scientific research, under the theme of international
competitiveness. Among his proposals:
   _More than $300 million in new tax breaks for the oil and gas
industry; allowing new drilling in selected offshore areas and in
the Alaska wildlife refuge.
   _Restoring a research and development tax credit for business.
   _Urban enterprise zones, using special tax breaks to lure
companies to depressed areas.
   _Expanded support of research and science by endorsing Reagan's
support for the space station and shuttle and the proposed
superconducting super collider physics laboratory.
   Bush proposes to spend the $515 million set aside by Congress
last year to begin construction of the space station, to be in orbit
in the late 1990s. Congress had put strings on the money by ordering
that the new president must first approve its use.
   In seeking to make good on his campaign assertion that he is an
environmentalist, Bush was promising more spending on the Superfund
program for toxic waste cleanup, clean coal technology, clean water
and wetlands programs, and a greater emphasis on global
environmental problems such as the greenhouse effect.
   Selected domestic programs would be increased as part of his
``kinder, gentler nation'' theme, including:
   _Increasing spending on the the Head Start preschool education
program by $149 million.
   _A new merit award program for schools, increased subsidies for
black colleges.
   _A renewed and expanded $3,000 tax deduction for adoption
expenses.
   _Rejection of Reagan's proposed $1.7 billion cut in the Medicaid
health program for the poor.
   _A child care tax credit of $1,000 for low-income families.
   _$21 million to start a national program for youth in public
service.
   _Increased spending for the battle against drug abuse, $236
million more than Reagan.
   Bush's budget was released in a manner that discouraged
comparisons with Reagan's proposals. Instead, the president decided
to compare his figures with those of the current fiscal year, a
technique which makes his spending increases look larger because the
old figures don't factor in inflation.
   For example, Bush claims as his initiatives a 13 percent boost in
research to find a cure for the AIDS virus and a 19 percent increase
in the space program. But his figures are the same as Reagan's.
   The Bush budget includes the $1.9 billion cost to taxpayers next
year of his program to bail out the ailing savings and loan
industry. Reagan has proposed $2.1 billion.
   Bush embraces Reagan's plan for upgrading aviation safety and
adds $350 million to the $1.4 billion Reagan sought for cleanups
needed at the government's nuclear plants.
   He does not touch Social Security.
   Bush planned to reveal further details of his spending plans
later this month, and the 193-page document released Thursday does
not sell itself as a comprehensive budget. ``It represents the new
administration's statement of priorities _ the outline of a
blueprint for building a better America,'' it says in its preface.
   The president's budget will be modified by the House and the
Senate into a final budget resolution, which then serves as an
overall guide for legislation.

<HEAD>Bush Calls For Action On Acid Rain, Other Environmental Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush called on Thursday for quick
action in Congress to combat acid rain and for a re-examination of
off-shore oil drilling projects in several environmentally sensitive
areas.
   Bush, proposing his first budget to Congress, said he is
committed to ending ``the long debate on acid rain'' by proposing
legislation aimed at revising the Clean Air Act to significantly
reduce industrial emissions that cause the problem. ``The time for
action has come,'' declared the president's budget summary.
   ``If we're to protect our future, we need a new attitude about
the environment. We must protect the air we breathe,'' Bush said in
a nationally televised address.
   In his speech, Bush touched on other environmental issues that
had been a frequent theme during his presidential campaign.
   ``We must not neglect our parks. So I am asking to fund new
acquisitions under the land and water conservation fund,'' he said.
``We must protect our oceans ... The age of the needle on the beach
must end,'' he said, referring to hospital wastes that washed up on
beaches in the Northeast last year.
   The proposed budget sks for $710 million _ nearly triple last
year's amount _ in the next fiscal year to develop clean coal
technology as part of the effort to deal with acid rain, which
damages lakes and vegetation.
   But Bush suggested some of the most important environmental
issues go beyond national boundaries. To solve those problems, he
announced he will convene an international conference to discuss
such issues as global warming, ocean pollution and the loss of
tropical rain forests.
   The budget also call for $191 million, a 43 percent increase, for
research to examine the effects of pollutants on global warming
through a so-called ``greenhouse'' effect.
   On off-shore oil drilling, Bush said he remains committed to
continuing the sale of oil and natural gas leases if they are
``prudent and environmentally sound.''
   But Bush singled out three regions _ two off the California coast
and one off the southern Florida coast _ where the administration
plans to postpone lease sales pending reviews by a special task
force that is to report to the president by Jan. 1, l990.
   The action is a break from the Reagan administration which had
sought to push ahead with the controversial leases despite
objections of environmentalists and residents of the regions.
   The president said oil and gas lease sales covering 1.2 million
acres off the northern California coast, which were scheduled for
later this year, would be ``indefinitely postponed'' pending the
environmental review, as would a lease sale off the southern Florida
coast.
   The sale of leases covering another 5 million acres off the
southern California coast, scheduled for l990, also would be
reviewed.
   The action on the oil leases was immediately hailed by Sen. Pete
Wilson, R-Calif., who said it ``demonstrates that Bush is a man of
his word'' because he had promised review of the California leases.
   Bush also promised to pursue an aggressive hazardous waste
cleanup effort with increased emphasis on enforcement and action
against those who dump wastes illegally.
   But the budget produced no additional funds for the Superfund
toxic waste cleanup program beyond the $175 million increase
outlined in the fiscal l990 budget submitted by former President
Reagan last month. The Superfund program would receive $1.75 billion
for the fiscal year.
   The budget called, however, for sharp increases in spending by
the Energy Department for cleanup and improved operations at the
department's nuclear weapons plants.
   Cleanup costs at the plants for fiscal l990 were placed at $401
million, a 150 percent increase in spending over this year.
   The Bush budget also calls for:
   _ A commitment to halting ocean pollution.
   _ Establishment of a ``national goal'' to maintain the country's
wetlands.
   _ A promise to increase research into ways to reduce the growing
volume of garbage.

   President Bush on Thursday proposed to hold
down the exploding Medicare spending in fiscal year 1990 while
offering Medicaid services to more poor women and children and
increasing spending for AIDS research, the homeless and adoption
services.
   Bush's spending plan for Medicare, the federal health insurance
program for the elderly and disabled, runs close to the same course
as the plan former President Reagan proposed to Congress last month.
   Under Bush's proposal to Congress, the cost of the Medicare
program would grow by $8 billion, to $92.5 billion next fiscal year,
a 9.5 percent increase in a program that has grown an average of 15
percent per year for the past decade.
   The president's plan would save an estimated $5 billion in
Medicare costs by limiting increases in payments to hospitals,
physicians and other health care providers. It also would reduce
payments to hospitals for new construction and supplemental payments
to teaching hospitals.
   For Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the
poor, Bush restored Reagan's proposed $1.7 billion cutback and added
$3.3 billion to maintain the level of current services under the
program. The increase would boost spending 9.7 percent from the
current $34.3 billion to $37.6 billion.
   Costs of the Medicaid and Medicare programs are among the fastest
growing segments of the federal budget because health care costs
have been increasing far faster than the general inflation rate.
   Bush abandoned Reagan's proposal to cut Medicaid payments to the
states. But he proposed to require states to raise mandatory
Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women and children to 30 percent
higher than the poverty level, up from the poverty level, and to
offset the expansion with cuts in administrative expenses.
   Ellen Nissenbaum of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a
nonprofit group that researches policy issues affecting the
low-income, said the proposed Medicaid policies would shift the
financial burden to the states.
   ``States, which administer Medicaid, would end up having to make
other cuts in Medicaid protection for poor children and their
families in order to finance Bush's Medicaid expansions, unless
states were willing to pump significantly more money of their own
into the program,'' she said.
   Bush also wants $20 million in fiscal years 1990 and 1991 for
grants to states with high infant mortality to develop health and
nutrition programs to combat the problem.
   The president proposed no cuts in Social Security, which will
cost $260 billion in 1990. In January 1990, recipients _ about 39.5
million people, some 650,000 more than this year _ would receive a
cost-of-living increase estimated at 3.6 percent.
   Spending on AIDS research and educational programs would rise 13
percent to $1.4 billion next year.
   The president also said a national AIDS program will be
established in the Public Health Service to coordinate and
consolidate AIDS funding, which is now spread among 23 separate PHS
agencies and ``vulnerable to bureaucratic competition and
rivalries.''
   Almost 85,000 Americans have been diagnosed as having acquired
immune deficiency syndrome since June 1981, and more than half, or
almost 48,600, have died. The Reagan administration said reported
cases of the fatal disease in this country are expected to reach
365,000 by the end of 1992 _ with 80,000 new cases and 65,000 deaths
projected for that year alone.
   Bush also addressed his campaign commitment to ``adoption not
abortion'' by proposing a $10 million increase in spending on
adoption services, which would raise funding 7.8 percent to $138
million.
   In addition, the president proposed a tax deduction of up to
$3,000 to cover adoption costs that are not reimbursed through other
programs.
   Bush also wants to raise spending for the homeless by 29 percent,
from $500 million currently to $645 million next year. As part of
the increase, he proposed a $50 million program to help homeless
families move from welfare hotels to transitional or permanent homes
and provide services and shelter for the homeless mentally ill.
